Welcome to Computing Fundamentals: Digital Literacy Edition! This book 
helps prepare you for success in a world that is filled with computers. At work, at 
school, at home, in stores, and as you travel, computers help make things run more 
smoothly.
Think about the average day in your life—all the places you go and all the things 
you do. How many of them involve a computer of some type? Probably quite a 
few. For example, you might wake up in the morning to the sound of a digital 
alarm clock. As you eat breakfast, you might browse the day’s news on your home 
computer or a tablet PC. The vehicle you ride in to work or school probably has 
at least one computerized component in it, and perhaps as you travel you talk to 
a friend on your cell phone. When you get to work or school, your supervisor or 
teacher might use a computer to assign work to you, or to teach a lesson. On the 
way home, you might stop at a restaurant where a cashier inputs your order into 
a computer-based ordering system that then relays your order to the kitchen staff. 
Before you go to bed, you might watch a DVD movie using a DVD player and a 
digital TV, both with computers in them.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
In this chapter, you will learn the basics that most computer systems have 
in common, whether it’s a desktop PC, a smartphone, or the software 
in your car that tells you it’s time for an oil change. You’ll find out how 
computers represent, encode, and process data, and how they commu-
nicate with one another. Many of the topics that this chapter covers in 
overview form are explored in greater detail later in the book.
Understanding Information Systems
An information system is a complete interconnected environment in 
which raw data—quantifiable facts and figures—is turned into useful 
information. An information system includes the following parts: people, 
hardware, software, procedures, and data (see Figure 1.1).
◾	 People: If you think about it, the only reason computers exist is to 
help people accomplish their goals. Therefore when planning an 
information system, it’s critical to understand what the people hope 
to get out of it. Do they need certain information? Do they need 
for the computer to activate a device that performs a task? Are they 
looking to be entertained or educated? The first step in planning an 
information system is to analyze the requirements of the people.
◾	 Hardware: When most people think of computers, they immedi-
ately think of hardware, the physical parts of the computer system. 
The hardware includes circuit boards with silicon chips and transis-
tors mounted on them, input devices like the keyboard and mouse, 
and output devices like printers and monitors.
◾	 Software: Computer hardware just sits there idle unless it has 
software, which is a program that tells the hardware what to do. 
There are many different levels of software, including the operat-
ing system (like Windows or Mac OS) and applications (like a word 
processing or accounting program).
◾	 Procedures: The software doesn’t run itself (usually). People must 
interact with the computer to tell it what software to run. For 
example, before you can write checks with your accounting soft-
ware, you must start up the software, open the file that stores the 
data for the business, and issue the command that opens the check-
ing account register. You can learn procedures from the online 
Help system in the application, from a printed user manual, from a 
training class, or by trial and error.
◾	 Data: Computer programs operate upon the data they receive. For 
example, in your accounting software, you enter data about the 
checks you are writing—the date, the amount, the recipient—and 
the program stores that data so you can recall it later.
information system An interconnected 
environment for managing and processing data 
using a computer.

Information Systems Manager
An Information Systems (IS) manager looks at the “big picture” of 
a company’s computer systems. As you discover in this chapter, an 
information system consists of people, procedures, software, hard-
ware, and data. The IS manager is the person who brings them all 
together to get results. An IS manager might oversee an initiative 
to satisfy an information need, such as for production managers 
to receive daily reports. This initiative might include assembling a 
team of programmers, identifying the required hardware and soft-
ware, developing procedures for handling the information request, 
and delivering the data to the managers in an easy-to-use format.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Personal Computers
When most people think about computers, they picture a personal 
computer, or PC. This type of computer is called personal because it is 
designed for only one person to use at a time. Personal computers fall 
into several categories that are differentiated from one another by their 
sizes. The most common sizes are:
◾	 Desktop PC: A com-
puter designed to be 
used at a desk, and 
seldom moved. This type 
of computer consists of a 
large metal box called a 
system unit that con-
tains most of the essen-
tial components, with a 
separate monitor, key-
board, and mouse that all 
plug into the system unit 
(see Figure 1.2).
◾	 Notebook PC: A por-
table computer designed 
to fold up like a note-
book for carrying, as 
shown in Figure 1.3. 
The cover opens up to 
reveal a built-in screen, 
keyboard, and pointing 
device, which substitutes 
for a mouse. This type of 
computer is sometimes 
called a laptop. A smaller 
version of a notebook 
PC is sometimes referred 
to as a netbook (which 
is short for Internet book, 
implying that this type of 
computer is primarily for accessing the Internet rather than running 
applications).
◾	 Tablet PC: A portable 
computer that consists of 
a touch-sensitive display 
screen mounted on a 
tablet-size plastic frame 
with a small computer 
inside, as in Figure 1.4. 
There is no built-in 
keyboard or pointing 
device; a software-
based keyboard pops up 
onscreen when needed, 
and your finger sliding 
on the screen serves as a 
pointing device.
personal computer A computer designed to be 
used by only one person at a time.
desktop PC A computer designed to be set up 
at a desk and not often moved, with input and 
output devices separate from the system unit.
system unit The main part of the computer, 
containing the essential components.
notebook PC A portable PC where the screen 
and keyboard fold up against one another for stor-
age and transport; also known as a laptop.
pointing device An input device such as a 
mouse or touchpad that enables users to move 
an onscreen pointer to select content and issue 
commands.
netbook A small notebook PC designed primarily 
for accessing the Internet.
tablet PC A lightweight slate-style computer with 
a touch screen, designed for easy portability.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
◾	 Smartphone: A mobile 
phone that can run com­
puter applications and 
has Internet access capa-
bility (see Figure 1.5). 
Smartphones usually 
have a touch-sensitive 
screen, and provide voice 
calls, text messaging, and 
Internet access. Many 
have a variety of location-
aware applications, such 
as a global positioning 
system (GPS) and map-
ping program and a local 
business guide.
Multi-User Computers
Multi-user computers are designed to serve groups of people, from a 
small office to a huge international enterprise. Here are some common 
types of multi-user computers:
◾	 Server: A computer dedicated to serving and supporting a network, 
a group of network users, and/or their information needs. Many 
networks employ servers to provide a centrally accessible storage 
space for data, and share common devices like printers and scanners. 
A small network server may look similar to a desktop PC, but may 
have a different operating system, such as Windows Server or 
Linux. A large server that manages a wide-ranging network may 
look similar to a mainframe. A group of 
servers located together in a single room 
or facility is called a server farm, or server 
cluster. Large Internet service provider (ISP) 
companies maintain extensive server farms.
◾	 Mainframe: A large and powerful com-
puter capable of processing and storing large 
amounts of business data. For example, a 
mainframe might collect all the sales data 
from hundreds of cash registers in a large 
department store and make it available to 
executives. The modern mainframe unit itself 
is a large cabinet, or a series of cabinets, 
each about the size of a refrigerator (see 
Figure 1.6). A mainframe may be stored in 
its own air-conditioned room in a business 
or school, and may have multiple employ-
ees monitoring and maintaining it. In earlier 
decades, smaller and less expensive multi-
user computers called minicomputers were 
employed in many businesses, but mini-
computers are no longer widely used.
smartphone A cellular phone that includes com-
puter applications and Internet access capability.
global positioning system (GPS) A device 
that determines your current position by communi-
cating with an orbiting satellite and provides maps 
and driving directions.
server A computer that is dedicated to perform-
ing network tasks such as managing files, printers, 
or email for multiple users.
server farm A group of servers located in the 
same physical area.
mainframe A large and powerful computer 
capable of serving many users and processing 
large amounts of data at once.

capabilities of a cell phone with a small touch-
sensitive tablet screen.

◾	 Supercomputer: A supercomputer is the largest and most powerful 
type of computer available, occupying large rooms and even entire 
floors of a building. Supercomputers are often employed in fields 
such as cryptanalysis (code breaking), molecular modeling, weather 
forecasting, and climate mapping. Supercomputers typically are 
used in high-tech academic, governmental, and scientific research 
facilities. Figure 1.7 shows a supercomputer.

type of computer, surpassing the capability of 
a mainframe, typically used in research and 
academics.

Put It to Work
Mapping the Human Genome
Supercomputers played a critical role in the Human Genome Project 
(HGP), a multi-national research project that sought to define the 
unique genetic sequences that comprise the 23 chromosome pairs 
of human DNA. The project began in the 1980s, and by April 2003, 
99% of the human genome had been mapped with 99.99% accu-
racy. Work continues on genomes today, with thousands of human 
genomes completely sequenced and many more mapped at a more 
basic level. The power of a supercomputer was essential for process-
ing the enormous amount of data. The data that this project collected 
may help researchers develop cures for diseases like cancer, as well 
as promote advances in biotechnology and molecular medicine.

Quick Review
	 1.	 What is a brief definition of “personal computer”?
	 2.	 What key characteristics of a desktop PC distinguish it from a notebook PC?
	 3.	 What are the differences between a server, a mainframe, and a supercomputer?
Understanding Software Types
Software tells the hardware what to do, but different kinds of software 
accomplish that at different levels. The following sections provide an 
overview of the types of software a computer might include.
BIOS
The most basic software is the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). 
This software is stored on a read-only chip on the motherboard so that 
it doesn’t accidentally get changed or corrupted. This important soft-
ware helps the computer start up and performs some basic testing on the 
hardware.
Operating Systems
The operating system (OS) manages all the computer’s activities after 
startup. The operating system serves several purposes:
◾	 It provides the user interface that humans use to communicate 
commands and receive feedback.
◾	 It runs applications, and enables humans to interact with them.
◾	 It controls and manages the file storage system.
◾	 It communicates with the hardware, instructing it to take action 
to accomplish tasks. For example, the OS tells the printer to print a 
document, and tells the monitor what image to display.
Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system; Figure 1.8 
shows the Windows 7 interface. Other operating systems include Mac 
OS and Linux for desktop and notebook PCs, UNIX for mainframes 
and servers, and Android for tablets and smartphones. Special versions of 
Windows and Mac OS also power tablets and smartphones. Each operat-
ing system has its own unique set of features, benefits, and drawbacks, so 
it pays to learn as much as you can about the operating systems available 
and choose a computer that will run the operating system that best fits 
your needs. You will learn much more about operating systems in general 
in Chapter 4, “Operating System Basics,” and more about the Windows 7 
interface in Chapter 5, “Introduction to Windows 7.”
software The programs that tell the computer 
what to do.
BIOS The software that initializes and tests the 
system at startup.
operating system Software that maintains the 
computer’s interface, manages files, runs applica-
tions, and communicates with hardware.

Step by Step
Identifying Your Windows Version
Each version of Microsoft Windows 
is available in various editions; 
Windows 7 comes in several editions, 
including Home Basic, Professional, 
and Enterprise, for example. Use this 
procedure to determine what version 
and edition of Windows you have on 
your computer: 
	 1.	Click the Start button. Right-
click Computer, and choose 
Properties. (Right-click means to 
press only the right side of your 
mouse.) An information page 
appears.
	 2.	Look under the Windows Edition 
heading. The version and edi-
tion of your Windows operat-
ing system appear there. If a 
service pack is installed, that 
information also appears.
This book uses Windows 7 for all its 
examples.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
Utilities
In addition to the main components of an operating system, utility 
software may also be available, either provided free with the OS or 
added on. Utility programs assist with a wide range of system mainte-
nance and security functions, such as checking storage disks for errors, 
blocking security and privacy threats, and backing up important files.
Application Software
Application software is software that is designed to do something 
productive or fun, something of interest to a human user. The OS keeps 
the computer running, but the applications give people a reason to use 
the computer.
Most computers come with some application software already installed. 
You can purchase additional software, and many applications are available 
for free. The software may be provided on a CD or DVD disc, or may be 
downloaded and installed via the Internet.
Productivity software helps you accomplish practical tasks such as man-
aging your money, charting numeric data, writing documents, storing 
data, and sending email. Perhaps the best known example in this soft-
ware category is Microsoft Office, a suite of applications that includes 
a word processor, a spreadsheet application, a database application, an 
application for creating business presentations, and an email and contact 
management system. A suite is a group of applications that are designed 
to work well together and that share some common interface characteris-
tics. Notice in Figure 1.9 that each of the three applications has a similar 
toolbar across the top.
Figure 1.9  These Microsoft Office applications—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—share a 
common interface.
utility software Software that performs some 
useful service to the operating system, such as 
optimizing or correcting the file storage system, 
backing up files, or ensuring security or privacy.
application software Software that helps a 
human perform a useful task for work or play.
productivity software Software that helps a 
human perform one or more business or personal 
enrichment tasks.
Microsoft Office A productivity suite of applica-
tions commonly used in businesses for word 
processing, spreadsheets, databases, presentation, 
and email.
suite A group of applications designed to 
complement each other’s capabilities and work 
together closely, often with a consistent interface 
between the applications.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
In addition to general suites like Office, dozens of other types of 
productivity software perform functions specific to certain profes-
sions, like accounting, customer relationship management (CRM), and 
appointment scheduling. On the technical side, software is available to 
help engineers and technicians create technical drawings and blueprints, 
develop new computer software, operate manufacturing and testing 
machinery, and much more.
Using Online Apps
Using Online Apps
Did you know that you can also use some software without installing it on your computer? Software as a Service 
(SaaS) is a new way of thinking about accessing and paying for software. Rather than buying a software product 
once, installing it on your computer and “owning” it forever, with the SaaS model you pay a usage fee for the 
software, which remains the property of the company. The software and any associated data are stored online. The 
company provides free updates for as long as you keep renewing your usage. Microsoft Office can optionally be 
rented this way through the Office 365 program, and many other applications are also being offered as services. 
SaaS has many benefits. The cost is typically lower than for buying the software outright, and updates and new 
versions are free and automatically provided.
Software as a Service (SaaS) A model of 
software sales that leases access to the software 
rather than selling a copy outright to the user.
Applications can also assist in education and training. For example, 
applications can train employees to perform new tasks or to use new 
productivity software, and can test their understanding of the training by 
administering and auto-scoring quizzes. In schools, applications can be 
used to simulate laboratory experiments and experiences, to assist with 
note-taking and review, and to help instructors create multimedia learn-
ing materials that students can use at their own pace. Some classes are 
even delivered entirely online through web-based software.
Applications can also entertain. You can find a wide variety of appli-
cations related to virtually any interest—cooking, sports and fitness, 
photography, science, and thousands more topics. Thousands of games 
are designed for every age group and interest, from simple matching 
and memory games to epic fantasy adventures to realistic first-person 
shooting games.

Computer System Components
Every computer system is made up of multiple electronic components. 
These components fall into four broad categories that serve different 
purposes in the information processing cycle, shown in Figure 1.10. 
You will learn more about the information processing cycle in Chapter 2, 
“The System Unit.”
Figure 1.10  The information processing cycle.
◾	 Input: Components that help humans put data into the computer. 
Examples include a keyboard, mouse, and touch screen.
◾	 Processing: Components that move and process the data inside the 
computer. The motherboard and its processor and memory chips 
fall into this category.
◾	 Output: Components that provide the results of the processing to 
humans. The monitor is the primary output device; other examples 
include printers and speakers.
◾	 Storage: Components that store software and data until it is 
needed. Storage components include hard drives, USB flash drives, 
and DVDs.
As you learned earlier in this chapter, the system unit is the main box 
that constitutes the computer. Some devices are external—that is, they 
are outside the system unit—and some are internal. On a desktop PC, 
most input and output devices are external; on a notebook, tablet, or 
smartphone, they are an integral part of the device but external devices 
can be added. Figure 1.11 shows the computer’s main components and 
their roles in information processing.
information processing cycle The four-step 
process that data moves through as it is processed 
by a computer. Consists of input, processing, 
output, and storage.

How Data Is Represented on a Computer
The smallest unit of data in a computer is a bit. A bit is a single binary 
digit, with either a 1 (on) or 0 (off) value. Eight bits can combine to 
make a byte, which is an 8-digit binary number, as shown in Figure 1.12.
Figure 1.12  Computers combine eight binary digits (bits) to make a byte.
Modern systems work with thousands, millions, and even billions of 
bytes at a time. Table 1.1 lists the names for certain multiples of bytes.
bit A single binary digit, with a value of either 
1 (on) or 0 (off).

Input Devices
An input device provides a way to get data into the computer. The oldest 
and most common input device is a keyboard. A desktop PC has an exter-
nal keyboard, while a notebook PC has a built-in keyboard. Tablets and 
smartphones have a software-based keyboard that pops up onscreen when 
needed.
Computers that use a graphical interface usually employ a pointing 
device. The pointing device moves an onscreen pointer (usually an 
arrow) to align with objects onscreen, and then the user presses a but-
ton on the pointing device to do something to the pointed-at object. A 
mouse is the most common pointing device, but there are many other 
types too, such as trackballs, touchpads, and touch-sensitive screens. You 
will learn more about input devices in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and 
Storage.”
Processing Devices
The motherboard is the large circuit board inside the computer that 
everything else plugs into. The key components located on the moth-
erboard are the processor (also called the Central Processing Unit, or 
CPU) and the memory (also called Random Access Memory, or RAM). 
To support these components, the motherboard has electrically conduc-
tive pathways called buses that carry the data from place to place, and 
a chipset, which is a controller that directs the bus traffic. Figure 1.13 
shows a motherboard removed from the computer case so you can see it 
more clearly.
Chapter 2 covers these components in more detail and explains how they 
work together.
keyboard An input device that allows users to 
type data into a computer using a standard set of 
typing keys.
motherboard A large circuit board inside a 
computer that controls the operations of all other 
components.
processor The chip in the computer that 
performs math calculations, processing data. Also 
called the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
memory Temporary electronic storage that holds 
the values of data bits using transistors.
bus A conductive pathway built into a circuit 
board, used to move data.
chipset The controller chip on a circuit board.
NOTE
Both memory and storage capacities are measured in bytes. For example, a computer might have 8GB RAM 
(memory) and a 500GB hard drive.

slots to the left of the CPU will hold the small circuit boards containing memory.
Output Devices
Information comes out of a computer through an output device such as a 
monitor. When you move the mouse or type a character on a keyboard, 
you see the results instantly on the monitor. The monitor helps you com-
municate with the operating system; without the monitor, you wouldn’t 
know if the OS had received and understood your instructions or if the 
application had accepted the data you input. Besides monitors, other 
output devices include printers (for producing hard-copy output) and 
speakers (for providing audio feedback).
Storage Devices
Storage devices enable software and data to be preserved and reused. 
Storage can be either removable or non-removable. (Non-removable stor-
age is actually removable too if you have the right tools and knowledge, 
but in this case the distinction refers to being easily removable or not.)
The most common type of storage is an internal hard drive, which is a 
sealed metal box inside the system unit. Hard drives are usually internal, 
making them non-removable. Some hard drives are removable, though; 
external hard drives easily connect to and disconnect from a port on the 
outside of the system unit. Other removable storage devices include USB 
flash drives and optical discs (CDs and DVDs). Chapter 3 covers storage 
devices in more detail, and explains the technologies behind them.
monitor A display screen on which a computer’s 
output appears.

puter data using either mechanical or solid-state 
technology.

How Computers Communicate
Early computers did not communicate easily with one another. Data was 
typically carried between computers on floppy disks and other low-capacity 
removable disks, or using slow dial-up modems. Network connections 
were difficult to set up and transferred data very slowly. Nowadays, how-
ever, communication technology has advanced greatly, and there are many 
choices for making computers connect to one another.
Ethernet Networking
Most computers today are part of one or more networks. A network is 
a group of computers that share resources (such as printers or Internet 
service) and/or data (such as files). The most common network stan-
dard is Ethernet. Ethernet networks can be either wired or wireless (or 
a combination of the two), but the term Ethernet is most often applied 
to the wired kind of connection. Figure 1.14 shows an Ethernet port on 
the side of a notebook PC. Most PCs have a network adapter, which 
provides network connectivity services and a port into which you can 
plug an Ethernet cable.

Figure 1.14  Ethernet is the most common type of network connection. Most computers 
have an Ethernet port.
Wireless Ethernet is more often called Wi-Fi, or 802.11. Most portable 
devices such as tablets and phones use wireless connections and do not 
have the capability for wired networking. Chapter 8, “Networking and 
Internet Basics,” explains networking technology in more detail.
In a small network, such as in a home or small business, one end of an 
Ethernet cable plugs into the computer, and the other end plugs into a 
controller box called a router that manages the network traffic between 
the connected devices. If you have broadband (always on) Internet 
access, the device that brings that service into your home or business is 
frequently called the router, and then the router shares the Internet con-
nection among all the computers.
network Two or more computers connected to 
share data and resources.
Ethernet The current dominant standard for local 
area networking devices.
network adapter A hardware component that 
enables a computer to connect to a network.
Wi-Fi Wireless Ethernet. A means of connecting 
computers and other devices wirelessly. Another 
name for it is IEEE 802.11, its technical standard.
router A connection box for Ethernet networks 
that physically joins the devices in the network 
(wired) or provides wireless connectivity (wireless), 
and enables a connection to an outside network 
such as the Internet.
broadband A fast, always-on network connection.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
If you have a Wi-Fi wireless router and a wireless network adapter in the 
computer, the computer can connect to the router via radio frequency 
(RF) waves, so no cables are required.
Bluetooth Networking
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless alternative to wireless Ethernet  
(Wi-Fi), used primarily to connect wireless devices directly to specific 
computers. For example, you might have a Bluetooth wireless headset for 
your cell phone, or a Bluetooth speaker for your MP3 player. Bluetooth’s 
limited range (10 meters) makes it impractical as a replacement for 
Wi-Fi, but it provides an easy and economical way for one device to con-
nect with another within a limited space without Ethernet hardware.
The Internet
The Internet is the world’s largest network. When you use the Internet, 
your computer becomes a member of this giant network, and you can 
communicate with any other computer on the Internet, to the extent 
that its owner has chosen to make it available. For example, you can 
exchange email messages, download files, and view web pages stored 
anywhere in the world.
Individual computers don’t connect directly to the Internet, however; 
they go through an Internet service provider (ISP), a company that 
provides a connection to the Internet for a fee. Your ISP may be your 
local phone or cable TV company, or at work or school it may be a ser-
vice that your employer or school partners with. An ISP provides a device 
(a modem or terminal adapter) that translates your computer’s requests 
into Internet-compatible data.
Internet service provider (ISP) A company 
that maintains a direct connection to the Internet 
and leases access to it to individuals and 
companies.
Privacy and Security
Wireless Router Security
A wired router is fairly secure by nature because you have to have physical access to it to plug a cable into it. 
A wireless router, however, is not secure because anyone within transmission range can connect to it. Wireless 
routers come with optional security features you can enable that will assign a code (like a password) that is required 
for a computer to connect to it. The first time that computer connects to the router, a prompt appears for the code; 
after the first successful connection, the code is stored and the computer can connect to the router automatically.
If you do not enable security on your wireless router, you should make sure that you do not have file sharing enabled 
on any of your computers. Otherwise an unknown person could not only use your Internet connection without permis-
sion, but could also view, change, copy, and even delete your important data files. An intruder might also be able to 
gather enough information about you from your data files to steal your identity.

Chapter 1: Computer Basics
Summary
Understanding Information Systems
An information system is a complete interconnected environment in which raw data—quantifi-
able facts and figures—is turned into useful information. An information system includes the fol-
lowing parts: people, hardware, software, procedures, and data.
Identifying Computer Types
A personal computer (PC) is a computer designed for only one person to use at a time. Examples 
include desktop PCs, notebook PCs, tablet PCs, and smartphones. Other computers support 
multiple users at once, including servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
Understanding Software Types
Software tells the hardware what to do. The operating system (OS) manages the computer’s 
activities. An operating system provides a user interface, runs applications, manages files, and 
communicates with hardware.
Application software is software that is designed to do something productive or fun. 
Productivity software helps you accomplish practical tasks; one example is the Microsoft Office 
suite. A suite is a group of applications designed to work together. Software may be bought on 
CD or DVD, downloaded and installed, or may be leased as Software as a Service (SaaS).
Computer System Components
The information processing cycle consists of these four parts: input, processing, output, and 
storage. Each component in a computer contributes to one or more parts of that cycle.
Input devices move data into a computer. Examples include a keyboard and mouse. A mouse is 
a type of pointing device; pointing devices move the onscreen pointer and select objects onscreen.
Processing components manipulate the data inside the PC, and include the motherboard and its 
processor, memory, chipset, and buses.
Output devices deliver the results of the processing to the user. The monitor (display screen) is 
the most common output device; others include speakers and printers.
How Computers Communicate
Most computers are part of one or more networks. The most common network standard is 
Ethernet, which can be wired or wireless. Wireless Ethernet is called Wi-Fi. To connect to a net-
work, the computer needs a network adapter (wired or wireless). A home network uses a router to 
connect the computers to one another and to connect to a shared broadband Internet connection 
if available.
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless alternative to Wi-Fi, used primarily to connect wireless devices 
directly to specific computers.
The Internet is a huge worldwide network. To participate in the Internet, individuals and companies 
must contract with an Internet service provider (ISP) for access.

Think It Over
Software as a Service
Suppose you had the chance to buy a productivity suite like Microsoft Office for a certain price 
and keep that version indefinitely, or to subscribe to a service that enabled you to use Office for as 
long as you continued paying the subscription fee. Suppose that the subscription cost was 1/30th 
per month of the cost to buy it outright. Which would be a better value for you, and why?
What if it were a game that you could either buy or subscribe to? Would you rather buy it outright 
and be able to play it forever, or would you rather subscribe to it?
Shopping for Tablet PCs
Suppose you are shopping for a tablet PC for use in your classes. Using the Internet, research 
at least one model of iPad, one tablet that has the Windows OS, and one model that uses the 
Android OS. Then answer the following questions:
◾	 Which tablet has the fastest processor and the most memory?
◾	 Which tablet OS has the most apps available for it? 
◾	 Which model has the longest battery life?
◾	 Which tablets have the capability of attaching external keyboards?
◾	 Which tablet has the largest screen size and the highest resolution?
◾	 What features do you personally find most important, and which model would serve those 
needs best?
Sharing Wi-Fi
Suppose your family pays for broadband Internet service, and you have a wireless router that 
allows everyone in the family to share the Internet connection. The wireless router has security 
on it, so that a code is required to connect to it. This prevents your neighbors from using your 
Internet connection without permission. A neighbor asks for the code so he and his family can use 
your Internet connection. What do you say? Explain how you came to your decision.
◾	 No, it would be unfair to the ISP for you to use the Internet without paying for it. You must 
pay for your own separate connection.
◾	 Yes, you can use it, but you must pay me for part of the expense of the service.
◾	 Yes, you can use it for free. Here is the code.
◾	 Some other answer (explain).

The System Unit
Learning objectives
◽	 Recognize how data is processed
◽	 Understand processors
◽	 Understand memory types and functions 
◽	 Identify and use ports and buses
The heart of any computer is its system unit. As you learned in Chapter 1, 
“Computer Basics,” the system unit is the main body of the computer, containing 
the essential components it needs to function.
If you have ever shopped for a computer, you probably noticed that some ­models 
cost much more than others—many times more. The quality and features of the 
components inside the system unit are the primary reason why cost varies so widely. 
Two computers can look identical from the outside but be very different in their 
capabilities and performance levels.
In this chapter, you will learn what happens inside the system unit, and what role 
each key component plays in making the computer fast and efficient at performing 
the tasks you ask of it. When you understand these things, you will be able to deci-
pher a computer’s technical specifications with confidence and select the models 
that have the best balance of cost and features for your situation.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Understanding CPUs
Every computer has at least one processor, also called a central process-
ing unit (CPU). The CPU contains millions of tiny transistors and 
pathways that take in data and instructions, process (calculate) the data 
according to the instructions, and output the results of the calculations. 
A computer may also have smaller processors used in specific subsystems, 
such as a graphics processor.
Every CPU includes the following components:
◾	 The control unit manages the flow of data through the CPU. It 
directs data to and from the other components within the CPU.
◾	 The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) component does the actual pro-
cessing. It receives data and instructions and delivers a result. For 
example, if it received the numbers 3 and 5, and the instruction 
Sum, it would return 8.
◾	 Registers are holding areas for both data and instructions. There 
are many different registers, each with its own special purpose. 
For example, there are registers that hold data, registers that hold 
instructions, registers that store logical states (yes/no), temporary 
values that serve as increment counters, and so on.
Physical Composition of a CPU
Physically, a CPU is a very small and thin sheet of semiconductor material 
(usually silicon) with a complex array of tiny transistors and buses stamped 
into it with a die. Semiconductor material is used for CPUs because it does 
not affect the flow of electricity one way or another: The semiconductor 
neither conducts nor impedes the electrical flow. The components inside 
the CPU are so small that you need a microscope to see them.
The CPU is fragile, so it is protected by a sturdy ceramic and metal 
casing; some models are mounted on miniature square circuit boards. 
The underside of this casing contains either tiny pins or tiny metal dots, 
central processing unit (CPU) The main 
processor in a computer.
semiconductor Material that is electricity-neutral, 
neither a good conductor nor a flow preventer.
Careers in IT
Bench Repair Technician
A bench repair technician is like a mechanic for comput-
ers. As the word bench implies, this technician works 
primarily at a workbench in a repair shop, although mobile 
repair technician positions are also available. Bench repair 
technicians can diagnose system problems with comput-
ers that customers bring in for repairs, including both 
hardware problems like defective parts and software prob-
lems like virus infections. This position requires either a 
two-year degree in Computer Technology or a professional 
certification such as CompTIA’s A+ certification. It is a 
good job for someone who prefers working mostly with the 
computers themselves rather than with their users.

precisely spaced, that align with connectors on the CPU socket on the 
motherboard. Each pin or dot is a separate communication line, carrying 
a different piece of data. Figure 2.1 shows both sides of a CPU designed 
for a desktop PC, for example. CPUs come in different sizes and have to 
match the socket type on the corresponding motherboard.

Figure 2.1  A typical CPU, back and front.
Most modern CPUs have multiple cores, so they can complete multiple 
tasks simultaneously, as if they physically were more than one CPU. A 
core consists of a separate set of the essential processor components (con-
trol unit, ALU, and registers). Most models of the Intel i7 processor have 
four cores, for example. All the CPU’s cores are located on the same chip.
In theory, the CPU is capable of executing a function with every tick of 
the system clock (called a clock cycle). However, in practice, the CPU 
sometimes is idle because there is a delay between the request for data to 
be retrieved from memory and its delivery. A delay caused by waiting for 
another component to deliver data is called latency.
To help minimize latency, CPUs have caches. A cache is a small amount 
of very fast memory located near (or within) the CPU. Data that the 
CPU has recently used, or is predicted to need soon, is placed in the 
cache for temporary holding. That way, if the CPU calls for the data, it’s 
more readily available and there is less delay.
CPU Performance Factors
The most obvious performance factor for a CPU is its maximum speed, 
measured in billions of hertz, or gigahertz (GHz). Although the actual 
speed is dictated by the motherboard’s system clock, each CPU has an 
advertised maximum speed, which is the highest speed at which the 
CPU’s manufacturer assures that it will reliably function.
core A set of the essential processor components 
that work together (control unit, ALU, and regis-
ters). A CPU may have multiple cores.
clock cycle One tick of the system clock.
latency A period of waiting for another compo-
nent to deliver data needed to proceed.
cache A small amount of fast memory located 
near or within the CPU.
hertz One cycle per second, a measurement of 
activity speed.
gigahertz One billion hertz.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
A CPU’s word size also makes a difference. The word size is the num-
ber of bits that the CPU (or a single core of the CPU, if multi-core) can 
accept as input simultaneously. Most desktop and notebook PCs have 
64-bit CPUs, but some tablets, netbooks, and smartphones have 32-bit 
CPUs; see Figure 2.2.
Figure 2.2  A 64-bit CPU has twice the word size of a 32-bit CPU, so the 64-bit CPU can 
theoretically input and output date at twice the rate. In actual use, many other factors also 
play a part, so the performance boost is less than 2x.
word size The number of bits that the CPU can 
accept as input simultaneously.
TIP
Windows 7 comes in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions. When selecting a copy of Windows for a 
device, keep in mind that 32-bit CPUs can only run the 32-bit version of Windows. 64-bit CPUs can run either 
64-bit or 32-bit versions of Windows, but run better with the 64-bit.
Because modern CPUs have many technology improvements in them, 
speed and word size alone do not form a reliable benchmark of a CPU’s 
capability. Another way to look at performance is how many instructions 
per second the CPU can process.
The two largest manufacturers of CPUs are the companies Intel and 
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Their CPUs are roughly equivalent in 
performance level, but the internal architectures of the CPUs are differ-
ent. A motherboard will support one or the other, but not both. Some 
people prefer one brand over the other, and claim that one brand or 
model is superior for using a certain kind of software. Such claims are a 
moving target, though, as each company continues to develop new and 
better CPUs.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
Understanding Memory
Like the memory in the human brain, computer memory stores data. 
Also like human memory, there is both short-term (temporary) and 
long-term (permanent) memory storage. Some memory is dynamic, 
in that it stores data only until the computer is turned off. Dynamic 
memory (also called volatile memory) must be constantly refreshed. 
Static memory (also called non-volatile memory) retains whatever you 
put in it indefinitely.
Another way to classify memory is whether it can be overwritten with 
new data or not. Random Access Memory (RAM) can be rewritten 
freely; Read-Only Memory (ROM) cannot (at least not in the same 
way that RAM can; see the following Note). All ROM is static, but RAM 
can be either dynamic (more common) or static.
How Computers Use Memory
Computers use different types of memory in various ways. Here are some 
of the most common memory uses:
◾	 System memory: The main memory in a computer 
system, such as the RAM installed on the PC’s 
motherboard, is dynamic RAM (DRAM). System 
memory is installed in slots on the motherboard, 
perpendicular to the motherboard itself.
dynamic memory Memory that does not 
retain its data unless it is constantly electrically 
refreshed.
static memory Memory that retains its data 
without electricity being constantly applied.
Random Access Memory (RAM) Memory 
that can have its values changed freely, an unlim-
ited number of times.
Read-Only Memory (ROM) In general, 
memory that cannot be rewritten. However, there 
are exceptions to that in newer types of ROM.
◾	 Component memory: Many components have a 
small amount of memory built in for their own use. 
For example, a printer might have RAM that holds 
the information about the page it is printing, and 
a display adapter might have memory to hold the 
data about the image it is displaying on the monitor. 
Component memory is typically DRAM unless the 
component’s function requires it to be otherwise 
because that’s the least expensive kind.

◾	 ROM-BIOS: A motherboard has an EEPROM chip that contains 
the low-level startup instructions for the hardware. To prevent cor-
ruption that would prevent the system from starting up, this chip is 
not rewritable except with a special utility program.
◾	 Caches: The caches in a CPU are a type of static RAM (SRAM).
◾	 USB flash drives, memory cards, and solid-state hard drives: 
These devices use a type of EEPROM to store data. This type of 
EEPROM is also called flash memory; its enhanced technology allows 
data to be written and rewritten to it multiple times.
Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM 
(EEPROM) ROM that can be erased and repro-
grammed with electricity.
NOTE
Windows also uses virtual memory to help prevent a computer from running out of memory. Virtual memory 
is a file on the hard drive used as an extension to main memory. This file is called the paging file or swap 
file. When the physical memory gets full (or nearly full), Windows moves some data to the paging file on the 
hard drive. When a program requests that data, Windows moves something else out of memory, swaps the 
old data back in again, and then responds to the request.
virtual memory Memory that is simulated 
by swapping data out of memory and storing it 
temporarily on the hard drive.
paging file The area of the hard drive set aside 
for use as virtual memory. Also called a swap file.
Physically, system memory comes mounted on small rectangular circuit 
boards called dual inline memory module (DIMM). These circuit 
boards fit into memory slots on the motherboard. There are differ-
ent types and speeds of DIMMs, so you must match the memory 
to the motherboard’s requirements. Figure 2.3 shows two different 
types of DIMMs. For notebook computers, small outline DIMMs 
(SO-DIMMs)  are used instead; they do the same thing as DIMMs but 
are a different size and shape.

Understanding System Memory
Each computer has a certain amount of system memory, also called 
RAM or main memory. It is dynamic RAM (DRAM), so it loses its con-
tents if it is not constantly being electrically refreshed.
System memory forms a workspace that the operating system uses. When 
you open an application, that application is placed in system memory, 
and when you open a data file, it is placed there too. When you make 
changes to a data file, those changes wait in memory until you write 
them to a more permanent storage area by saving your work. The more 
system memory you have, the more applications and files you can have 
open at once.

RAM (DRAM) on the motherboard.

Chapter 2: The System Unit
Memory capacity is described in bytes (usually megabytes or gigabytes). 
SDRAM DIMMs come in different capacities, such as 2GB or 4GB. An 
average desktop PC might have 4GB to 8GB of system memory, which 
might be installed in either two or four DIMM slots.
TIP
The 32-bit version of Windows can support only 4GB of RAM. If your computer has more than that, make sure 
you have the 64-bit version of Windows or some of your RAM will be unused. Sometimes the motherboard has 
a limit on the amount of RAM that can be recognized, so check this before you rush out and buy more RAM.

Understanding Motherboards
Both the CPU and the memory plug into the motherboard (see 
Figure 2.4). Motherboards vary in many ways, including the CPUs and 
memory they support, the technology used in their chipset, the expan-
sion slots they have, and the external ports they support.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
The motherboard’s capabilities are determined by its chipset. The 
chipset contains the controllers that direct the traffic along the mother-
board’s buses, specify which memory and CPUs the motherboard can 
accept, and route data to expansion slots and ports as needed.
The form factor of the motherboard is its physical size and shape. It is 
significant because the motherboard must be able to physically fit into 
the system unit case.
Expansion Slots
Expansion slots are plastic slots on the motherboard. Inside the slots are 
metal contacts that connect with metal contacts on smaller circuit boards 
called expansion cards that fit into them. You can buy many different 
expansion devices, adding capabilities that might not be built into the 
motherboard, or adding a more feature-rich version of a built-in device. 
For example, you might add a Wi-Fi adapter to a desktop PC with an 
expansion card, or a dial-up modem, or you might replace the on-board 
display adapter built into your motherboard with a model that has a 
faster graphics processor.
Different motherboards have different numbers and types of slots. Each 
slot type has its own separate bus, delivering its own combination of 
width and speed.
A typical motherboard might have three or more expansion slots: con-
ventional Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) slots (an older type 
of slot, for backward compatibility with older devices) and several newer 
PCI Express (PCIe) slots. Figure 2.5 shows some slots in a mother-
board; this one has one x1, one x4, and two x16 slots (which are all dif-
ferent sizes of PCIe slots), as well as one regular PCI slot.
Notebook PCs are more likely than desktops to have a wide variety of 
built-in components, so there is less need for expansion slots. Because 
there’s not much room for them internally, There might be an exter-
nally accessible expansion slot called an ExpressCard (or PC Card or 
CardBus) slot. ExpressCards are small circuit boards encased in a metal 
cartridge.
There also might be a removable panel on a notebook PC with a PCI 
Express Mini Card socket, into which you can install a small expansion 
board that uses the motherboard’s internal PCIe bus. One common use 
for this type of socket is to add a Wi-Fi adapter. Figure 2.6 shows a PCI 
Express Mini Card and its connector.

(mostly obsolete).

version of the PCI motherboard slot. Different 
numbers of channels are used in different sized 
PCIe slots, such as 16, 4, or 1.

Built-in Components
Motherboards can also have built-in components for video, audio, and 
networking. Having these components built in means that you don’t 
need to buy separate circuit boards for those capabilities, and you don’t 
need expansion slots for such cards.
Each of those three built-in components has its own external 
ports built into the motherboard. The display adapter may 
have a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) connector, a Video 
Graphics Adapter (VGA) connector, or both. DVI is the newer, digital 
type of monitor connector used with digital monitors (which include 
most flat-screen LCD monitors); VGA is the older, analog type used 
with the boxy older CRT style of monitor and with some older or 
inexpensive LCD monitors.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
The audio component support results in several small (3.5mm) 
round external connectors for plugging in speakers, headphones, 
and microphones. They are usually color-coded: pink for microphone, 
green for speakers or headphones, and blue for line input.
The Ethernet support results in an RJ-45 jack as an external 
connector. An RJ-45 jack looks like a telephone connector but is 
slightly wider and has eight metal contacts in it, rather than the two or 
four of a telephone connector.
Other Common External Connectors
The motherboards typical of newer systems have only a few types 
of external ports. Universal Serial Bus (USB) is the most 
common multipurpose port type; many devices use USB ports, including 
keyboards, mice, and printers. There are different generations of USB, with 
different speeds.
A motherboard can also support IEEE 1394A ports, also 
called FireWire ports. FireWire is a competitor to USB. It has 
not caught on quite as widely, but it is used for some external hard drives 
and digital video equipment.
Older systems may have a variety of other external ports, for backward 
compatibility with older devices. Motherboards with these older ports 
are still available today, but they are becoming less and less common. 
The most common legacy ports are:
 	 PS/2 port: This is a small round port that was used for 
mice and keyboards before USB became popular. They 
are usually color-coded: purple for the keyboard and 
green for the mouse.
	Parallel (LPT) port: This is a 25-pin connector, with the 
holes arranged in two rows. It was used for printers before 
USB became the dominant interface for printers. The 
port on the computer is a female connector, meaning it 
has holes; the connector on the cable that plugs into it is a 
male connector, containing pins that fit in the holes. This 
type of connector is sometimes called a DB-25 connector.
	
Serial (COM) port: This is a 9-pin connector (DB-9), 
with the pins arranged in two rows. It is a male connec-
tor on the motherboard, and the cable that plugs into it 
is female. This type of port used to be an all-purpose port 
for a variety of external devices, much like USB is today.
Drive Connectors
Most motherboards have two types of drive connectors. The older type 
is Parallel ATA (PATA), and it is used with older hard drives and most 
CD and DVD drives. This type of connector has 40 pins arranged in two 
rows, and uses a ribbon cable to connect the device to the motherboard.
The newer type is Serial ATA (SATA), a more compact connector that 
uses a thin round cable. SATA is used with newer hard drives. You will learn 
more about drive connectors in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and Storage.”
Universal Serial Bus (USB) A general-purpose 
port for connecting external devices to a PC.
IEEE 1394A A connector used to connect 
certain types of devices to a computer that require 
high-speed connection, such as some external 
hard drives and video cameras. A competitor to 
USB. Also called FireWire.
PS/2 A connector used to connect some older 
keyboards and mice to a computer. PS stands for 
Personal System. This connector was first intro-
duced with the IBM PS/2 computer in 1987.
parallel port A port used to connect some older 
printers to a computer. It is sometimes called an 
LPT port, which stands for Line Printer.
serial port A port used to connect some 
very old external devices to a computer. It is 
sometimes called a COM port, which stands for 
communications (although actually many types of 
ports operate serially, not just this one).
Parallel ATA (PATA) A type of connector used 
for older disk drives and optical drives such as CD 
and DVD drives.
Serial ATA (SATA) A type of connector used for 
newer disk drives.
ATA Short for AT Attachment. The IBM PC AT was 
an early type of computer (1984) that was among 
the first to support modern hard drive technology.

Step by Step
Exploring Your Motherboard
Use this procedure to see what components and connectors your motherboard has. Use a desktop computer for this 
exercise.
	 1.	Shut down the computer, and open up the system unit. You may need a Phillips screwdriver. Ask your instructor for 
assistance if needed. Do not touch anything inside the system unit.
	 2.	Locate the following components. Ask your instructor to confirm that you are correct:
◾	 CPU (may be under a heat sink)
◾	 System memory
◾	 Built-in USB ports
◾	 Other built-in ports (name them if you can)
◾	 Expansion slots (identify the type if you can)
	 3.	Trace each cable from the motherboard to the components to see how components such as the hard drive and 
power supply attach to the motherboard.
	 4.	Close the system unit’s case and replace any screws you removed.
Quick Review
	 1.	 If you see a DVI port built into a motherboard, what type of capability can you assume is built into the motherboard?
	 2.	 What is PCI Express (PCIe)?
Understanding Power Supplies
The power from your wall outlet is alternating current (AC), and is 
either 110 volt (v) or 220v, depending on the country in which you live. 
Computer components require direct current (DC) and require much 
lower voltages. A power supply has two jobs:
◾	 It converts AC to DC power.
◾	 It decreases the voltage to the amount required for each 
component.
In a desktop PC, a power supply is a large silver metal box mounted in 
one corner of the system unit, with many bundles of colored wires and 
connectors emerging from it (see Figure 2.7). The wire colors are signifi-
cant; each wire color carries a different voltage. Each connector has the 
appropriate wires running to it to deliver the exact voltage required for 
each connected device. The most common wire colors are red, yellow, 
and black. The connector shown in Figure 2.8, for example, uses one red 
wire, one yellow wire, and two black wires. The power comes in on the 
red and yellow wires, and the black wires are for grounding.
A desktop PC’s power supply has a fan in it, and when you start up the 
PC, the fan starts up too. The fan pulls hot air out of the power sup-
ply, and has a side benefit of circulating air through the entire system 
unit too.

AC power from a wall outlet to DC power and

In addition to the 
several types of 
connectors that go 
to internal devices 
such as drives, the 
power supply also 
has one big con-
nector, containing 
20 or more wires 
arranged in two 
rows. Figure 2.9 
shows an example. 
This connector 
plugs directly into 
the motherboard, 
and powers all its 
components that do 
not have separate power connectors.

built in. The power 
cord typically con-
tains a transformer 
block (sometimes 
called a brick) that 
decreases and con-
verts the voltage.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
Summary
Understanding CPUs
A central processing unit (CPU) contains a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and 
registers. The CPU operates at the pace dictated by the system clock, executing billions of opera-
tions per second. One tick of that clock is a clock cycle. When the CPU sits idle during a clock 
cycle because it is waiting for data it needs, that wait time is called latency. To minimize latency, 
CPUs have multiple caches.
Physically, the CPU is a semiconductor wafer of silicon. Most modern CPUs have multiple cores; 
each core has its own control unit, ALU, and registers. A CPU has a maximum speed, measured in 
gigahertz (GHz). A CPU’s word size is the number of bits it can accept as input simultaneously. 
Modern CPUs in personal computers are usually either 32-bit or 64-bit. Windows is available in 
both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. CPU performance can be described in the number of instruc-
tions per second it can process, but it is more reliably measured using benchmarking software.
Understanding Memory
Memory can be either dynamic (losing its data when it loses power) or static (retaining its data). 
Random access memory (RAM) can be freely rewritten, and can be either static or dynamic. 
Read-only memory (ROM) is always static.
System memory resides on the motherboard and is used as a work area for the operating system. 
Some components also have their own memory. Virtual memory is hard drive space that simu-
lates extra memory by allowing the operating system to swap data into and out of the real memory 
into a swap file.
Physically, system memory comes in dual inline memory modules (DIMMs).
Understanding Motherboards
The motherboard’s capabilities are determined by its chipset. A motherboard’s form factor is its 
physical size.
Motherboards have expansion slots, each type of slot having its own bus on the motherboard. 
Peripheral Component Interface (PCI) is an older type of expansion slot; a newer type is PCI 
Express (PCIe), which comes in a variety of sizes based on the number of channels, such as x1, 
x4, or x16. Some notebook computers have ExpressCard slots or PCI Express Mini Card slots.
Some of the ports that a motherboard may have built in include Digital Visual Interface (DVI) 
and Video Graphics Adapter (VGA) for video, 3.5mm analog plugs for audio, and RJ-45 for 
Ethernet networking. Internally, a motherboard has connectors for disk drives, including Parallel 
ATA (PATA) and Serial ATA (SATA).
A Universal Serial Bus (USB) port is a general-purpose expansion port. IEEE 1394A, also called 
FireWire, is an alternative to USB, and is used on some external hard drives and digital video cameras. 
Older ports that a system might have include PS/2, parallel (LPT), and serial (COM).
Understanding Power Supplies
The computer’s power supply converts AC to DC power and decreases the voltage to the amount 
required. The colors of the wires on the connectors on the power supply are significant, indicating 
different voltages. On a notebook PC, a transformer block built into the power cable provides 
the same functions as the power supply in a desktop PC.

Completing a System Inventory
Using the features described in this chapter, create a description of your system’s motherboard, 
as completely as you can describe it. If you can find its model number (usually stamped on the 
board itself), look it up online to see if its specs are available. If not, do your best to deduce its 
characteristics by looking at what ports are built in and by using the System Information utility in 
Windows.
Exploring Power Voltages
To do this exploration, you will need a desktop PC and a voltmeter (or a multimeter that measures 
DC volts). Your instructor may need to guide you through the process.
	
1.	Turn on your meter and set it to DC volts. You should have a red probe and a black probe.
	
2.	Open the system unit case, and locate the large connector that joins the power supply to the 
motherboard.
	
3.	Turn on the PC.
	
4.	Insert the black probe down into one of the sockets where a black wire connects, so that the 
probe touches the bare metal wire.
	
5.	Insert the red probe down into one of the sockets where a red wire connects, so that the 
probe touches the bare metal wire.
	
6.	Read the display on the meter. It should be approximately +5v.
	
7.	Repeat Steps 4–6 with several other wire colors, and record the readings you get.
	
8.	Turn off the meter and put it away.
	
9.	Turn off the computer, and close the system unit case.
Think It Over
Is Faster Always Desirable?
Is it important to you, when buying a new computer, to have the fastest and best CPU available, 
even if it costs more? Does it make more financial sense to pay more now for a CPU that will 
become obsolete less quickly a few years in the future? Or is it better to buy a lesser CPU, even if 
you have to replace the computer sooner because it will no longer be powerful enough to run the 
latest programs in a few years?
Shopping with Expandability in Mind
If you were buying a computer today, what expansion slots and ports would be important for your 
new computer to have, and why? That is, what device would you plan to install later that might 
need those slots or ports?

Careers in IT
Database Administrator
Businesses store large amounts of data, and that data is often much 
more valuable than the hardware on which it is stored. Information 
about customers, orders, product inventory, suppliers, and market 
trends must be readily and reliably available for the business to 
thrive. A database administrator is an expert in managing, summariz-
ing, and safeguarding large amounts of data. Database administrators 
also plan and create well-organized database systems for storing new 
and existing data. For this career, a bachelor of science or associate 
of science degree in an information technology-related field would be

Whenever you type a letter in a word processor, or issue the command 
to open or close the word processing program, you use an input device. 
Input devices allow the user to communicate with the operating system 
and applications. In this section, you will learn about several types of 
input devices.
Keyboards
A keyboard enables you to enter typed data—letters, numbers, and sym-
bols. A keyboard can be a separate device that plugs into the system unit 
(as with a desktop PC) or a built-in keyboard (as with a notebook PC).
There are many sizes and types of keyboards, but most English-language 
keyboards use the same key arrangement, called QWERTY. The name 
comes from the first six letter keys on the top row, from left to right. 
Figure 3.1 shows a QWERTY keyboard.

computer to accept commands or data from a 
human user.

language keyboards.

Figure 3.1  The QWERTY keyboard layout.
This type of keyboard has a number of specialty keys as well as the num-
bers, letters, and symbols. Specialty keys include:
◾	 Function keys (F1 through F12) perform special actions when 
pressed. The action assigned to each key depends on the operating 
system or application you are using.
◾	 Toggle keys turn a feature on or off each time they are pressed. 
For example, the Caps Lock key toggles between upper- and lower­
case letter typing mode, and the Num Lock key toggles between 
the numeric keypad on the keyboard (if it has one) providing num-
ber entry or functioning as a set of directional arrows.
◾	 Modifier keys change the meaning of other keys when they are 
pressed in combination with them. For example, the Shift key, 
when pressed in combination with a letter, makes that letter upper-
case. Other keys, such as Ctrl and Alt, can be used with other keys 
to issue special command shortcuts. For example, a common key-
board shortcut in Windows 7 is Ctrl+C (press both keys simultane-
ously) for copying selected content.
NOTE
On a notebook computer, an Fn key may be present; it’s an extra modifier key that allows you to access 
special functions assigned to certain keys. For example, you might see a sun symbol and an up arrow on one 
of the function keys. You could hold down Fn and press that function key to increase the brightness of the 
display. Check the manual that came with your notebook computer to find out more about the actions you can 
take with the Fn key.
◾	 Positional keys such as the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down 
keys, as well as the directional arrow keys, scroll the display or 
move the insertion point in applications.
A wireless keyboard does not require a cable connection to the com-
puter, allowing for greater ease of use. An ergonomic keyboard is a 
keyboard that is designed to minimize the stress on the user’s body (see 
Figure 3.2). It may have a built-in palm or wrist support, for example. 
A bilingual keyboard has characters in more than one language on its 
keys, so when you switch to a different keyboard layout in the operating 
system, the characters on the keyboard match what you are typing.
insertion point The flashing vertical line that 
indicates where typed text will appear.

the computer wirelessly rather than with a cable.

designed with features that help reduce stress on 
the user’s hands and wrists.

Step by Step
Using a Virtual Keyboard
Devices that don’t have physical keyboards, like tablets and smartphones, use a virtual keyboard, which is a software 
replica of a keyboard that pops up on the touch screen. Even if you have a regular keyboard, you can still try out a virtual 
keyboard in Windows if you like. Follow these steps to use the virtual keyboard in Windows 7:
	 1.	Click the Start button and type key and then click On-Screen Keyboard. A window appears showing a virtual 
keyboard.
	 2.	Open an application in which you can type text, such as Notepad. To open Notepad, click the Start button, type 
notepad into the Search field, and then click Notepad.
	 3.	Experiment with the keyboard by clicking keys to type the letters.
	 4.	When you are finished, click the Close (X) button in the upper-left corner of the On-Screen Keyboard window.
	 5.	Close the application you opened in Step 2 without saving your changes.

keyboard on the screen that users can tap or click 
to simulate typing.
Pointing Devices
A pointing device is a piece of hardware that enables you to move an 
onscreen pointer in a graphical user interface like Microsoft Windows. 
A mouse is the most common pointing device. It is a palm-sized object 
that you move across a flat surface to move the pointer on the display. A 
mouse has one or more buttons on it; you press the buttons to act upon 
whatever the pointer is pointing at.
A mouse can be either mechanical or optical. A mechanical mouse 
has a chamber on its underside with a rubber ball in it. As you roll the 
mouse across a flat surface, the ball turns, activating sensors inside the 
chamber that translate the ball’s movement to onscreen pointer activ-
ity. An optical mouse has a light-emitting diode (LED) and a sensor on 
its underside, as shown in Figure 3.3. The light bounces off the surface

and the sensor measures it, and those measurements are reported back 
to the computer to tell the pointer how to move. Mechanical mice need 
frequent cleaning; optical mice are maintenance-free and have virtually 
replaced the mechanical type.

Figure 3.3  The underside of an optical mouse contains a  
red light and a sensor that measures its reflection from  
the surface the mouse is used on.
Like a keyboard, a mouse can have a wire (cord) connecting it to the 
computer, or it can be wireless. A wireless mouse communicates with 
a transceiver connected to a USB port to exchange data with the com-
puter, or uses a technology called Bluetooth to communicate via radio 
waves. A wireless mouse requires a battery, whereas a wired mouse draws 
the small amount of power it needs from the computer via its cord.
Other pointing devices are also available. For example, a trackball is a 
stationary device with a ball on top (or on the side) that you roll with 
your fingers. See Figure 3.4. A trackball requires less space on a desk to 
operate and some people find it more comfortable to use than a mouse. 
Many notebook computers have a built-in touchpad, which is a small 
rectangular touch-sensitive pad with buttons below it. See Figure 3.5. 
You can drag your finger on the pad to move the onscreen pointer, and 
press the buttons to click.

operations.
A joystick, shown in Figure 3.6, is a specialized pointing device used 
primarily in gaming. It consists of a vertically mounted stick that can be 
tilted in any direction. A set of buttons on the base of the joystick enable 
you to perform actions, such as shooting or jumping in a game.

Drawing Tablets
A drawing tablet, also called a digitizing tablet, is a specialized type 
of touchpad designed for drawing. The user draws on the tablet with a 
pen-shaped pointer called a stylus, and the drawing shows up onscreen. 
Professional graphic artists use drawing tablets to draw directly into 
a computer program to create both technical and artistic drawings.

Scanning Devices
A scanner digitizes hard-copy photos and documents and stores them 
electronically. Scanners work by shining a bright light on the surface of the 
page and measuring the amount of light that bounces back from it using 
a photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD). Lighter areas bounce 
back more light than darker areas. For color scanning, multiple sensors are 
used, each one picking up a different color: red, green, and blue.

digital (computerized) form.
charge-coupled device (CCD) The light-
sensitive sensor in a scanner that records the 
amount of light bounced back from the image.
Sensory Input
Many portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have new types of input technology that detect direc-
tion, motion, and/or location. For example, some devices have a global positioning system (GPS) to detect your 
location, an accelerometer to tell how fast you are moving, a compass to report what direction you are facing, 
and a gyroscope to report the orientation of the device. It is the gyroscope, for example, that tells a phone or 
tablet when you turn it on its side so it can change the orientation of the screen.
New Technologies
NOTE
A scanner can be a stand-alone device, or it can be a component in a multi-function device (MFD) that com-
bines the functions of a printer, copier, and scanner into one unit.
multi-function device (MFD) A device that 
combines the functions of a printer, a copier, and 
a scanner into one unit, and also a fax in some 
models.
Most scanners are flatbed models, as in Figure 3.8, where you place 
the image on a flat piece of glass and then a sensor and light bar moves 
beneath it to capture the image. A flatbed scanner may optionally have 
a document feeder on it so multiple pages can be queued for scanning. 
There are also smaller portable scanners that either feed in one sheet at a 
time past a stationary sensor and light bar, or that you hold in your hand 
and manually move across the image to be scanned.
When you scan text, you can use optical character recognition (OCR) 
software to convert the scanned image to text that you can work with in 
a text editing program.

CAUTION
OCR software is not perfect; it sometimes makes mistakes in conversion, so you must proofread scanned 
text carefully.
One very simple type of scanner is a bar code reader, shown in 
Figure 3.9. Bar codes are vertical stripes of varying widths and spaces 
that represent numeric values. The most common type of bar code is a 
Universal Product Code (UPC), the bar code that identifies a product 
that consumers buy at a store.
A bar code reader examines the bars and inputs their numeric values into 
the computer. A bar code reader can be hand-held, like a gun-type unit that 
a warehouse worker might use to look up an item, or stationary, like the 
scanner in a grocery store checkout kiosk. Bar codes are used everywhere 
that numeric accuracy is important for tracking physical items. For example, 
they are used in many manufacturing businesses to track parts, finished 
products, and orders. Shipping services use them to track the packages as 
they move from their origin to their destination, and retail stores use them 
at the cash registers to scan purchased items and look up their prices.

QR code (which stands for Quick Response) is a new type of scanner-
readable code that is replacing UPCs in many places. It’s a two-dimensional 
barcode. Whereas a standard bar code is read in only one direction (ana-
lyzing the width and spacing of the bars), a QR code is a square panel 
with encoded data in both directions. QR codes can store more data than 
bar codes, making them more useful for providing information about an 
item. Figure 3.10 shows an example of a QR code being scanned by a 
smartphone.

smartphones (with an appropriate app installed)  
as well as by specialized scanners.

code, containing more information than a tradi-
tional bar code.
Scanning QR Codes
Many smartphones with cameras have QR readers built into them, so your phone can serve as a QR scanner. 
When you scan a QR code that you see on an advertisement, for example, you might be taken to the company’s 
website or to a coupon for the product. If you have a smartphone, see if it has a code reader app. If it doesn’t, 
download a free one. Then locate a QR code (look in magazines, on billboards, on subways, and anywhere else 
that companies advertise) and scan it with your phone to see what happens.

Another type of scanner used in many businesses is a magnetic card 
reader, shown in Figure 3.11. You use one of these every time you swipe 
a credit card to pay for a purchase, for example. Magnetic card readers 
read the encoded data on the magnetic strip on the back of your credit 
card or ID card and transfer that data into a computer. Some credit 
cards have a radio frequency identification (RFID) chip in them that 
enables you to pass them in front of a radio frequency card reader to read 
the card’s data without it physically touching a reader. RFID chips are 
also used in security systems to allow employees access to secure areas of 
a building if they are wearing an RFID-equipped ID badge.

Security and Privacy
Fingerprint Readers
A fingerprint reader is a type of biometric scanner— 
that is, a scanner that scans something about a 
human body that is used to identify that person. 
Many computer systems use fingerprint readers as 
a form of user authentication. The fingerprint of the 
person logging in is compared to a database of pic-
tures of the fingerprints of authorized users. Other 
types of biometric scanners include facial recogni-
tion, voice recognition, and retina scanners.

Certain industries use specialized scanners to simplify data entry. For 
example, companies that grade standardized testing use an optical mark 
recognition (OMR) system that detects the presence of a pencil or ink 
mark on certain spots on a standardized form. Banking institutions save 
time and cut down on entry errors by using a magnetic-ink character 
recognition (MICR) system to read the routing and account numbers 
on checks and deposit slips, as in Figure 3.12.

Capture Devices
The scanners you have learned about so far read existing data and scan 
existing photographs and documents. Image capture devices, on the 
other hand, capture new content.
A capture device can capture either still images or motion video. Some 
devices do both, but most are designed primarily for one type or another. 
A digital camera is designed primarily for still photos, and looks much 
like a film camera; a digital video camera is designed primarily for motion 
video. See Figure 3.13. Both work using the same basic technology; the 
digital video camera captures many frames (individual still images) per sec-
ond and stores them in a single file. When you play back the still images in 
chronological order, the image appears to be moving. Digital video cam-
eras can also capture sound to accompany the video clips, which can be 
played back synchronously with the images. Many modern smartphones 
have built-in cameras that can take still photos and record video clips.

to a computer to transfer, edit, and save the video clips. Other cameras 
are webcams, as in Figure 3.14, which are simple video cameras that 
lack their own storage and capture controls. They remain permanently

directly on the computer’s storage drives. They rely on video capture 
software on the computer to start and stop the capture process. Webcams 
are often used for online video chatting through services such as Skype.

Audio Input Devices
Most personal computers support audio input, either through a built-in 
audio adapter on the motherboard or through an add-on sound card. A 
computer’s audio ports may support speakers, headphones, microphones, 
and both analog and digital external audio device input. An example of 
an external audio input device is a home stereo system; an external digital 
audio device might be a digital piano keyboard.
If you have a microphone and voice input software, you can speak into 
the microphone to issue commands to the computer and to input text 
into a word processing program. Some people with disabilities use voice 
input to control the computer as a substitute for a keyboard or mouse, 
and some people who have a lot of text to enter but don’t type very 
quickly may find voice input more efficient than trying to type all the 
text. People who use audio input frequently find that it is worthwhile 
to buy a high-quality microphone headset, as in Figure 3.15, because it 
provides more accurate voice pickup.
There are two kinds of voice input software: voice recognition and speech 
recognition. Voice recognition software recognizes spoken words that 
match words in its database. It does not pay attention to the tone or 
inflection of the speaker’s voice. People who speak with a heavy accent 
may have difficulty with such software. Voice recognition is included with 
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. Speech recognition software 
is teachable software that learns an individual’s pronunciation and vocal 
inflection. Each user trains the software by reading long passages of text 
into the microphone; the software records what each word sounds like 
when that person pronounces it, and can also learn new words.
audio adapter Also called a sound card. A com-
ponent of a computer system that accepts and 
processes audio input and delivers audio output.

Selecting and Using Output Devices
Output devices make the computer’s processed information available to a 
human user. Without output devices, there would be little reason to have 
a computer, because it wouldn’t produce anything you could use. The 
most common types of output devices are display screens, printers, and 
speakers.
Display Screens
A display screen is a video screen that the computer uses to provide 
information to a human user. A display screen can be built into a device, 
as it is with smartphones, tablets, and notebook PCs, or it can be a sepa-
rate unit (a monitor), as it is with the majority of desktop PCs.
Display screens create their images by filling in tiny dots called pixels 
with different colors. The pixels are so small and so close together that 
the human eye sees them as continuous color gradients rather than indi-
vidual blocks. Monitors differ in the technology they use to illuminate 
those pixels.
Built-in display screens are thin and flat, and most of them use liquid 
crystal display (LCD) technology. Most modern stand-alone monitors 
are also LCD, like the one shown in Figure 3.16. This technology has 
two polarized filters, with a liquid crystal substance between them. One 
filter is at an angle, so light doesn’t pass through it automatically. When 
electricity hits a crystal, it twists, refracting the light so that it passes

Color displays have separate filters for red, green, and blue. Some new 
mobile devices use organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, 
which uses organic matter that lights up in response to an electrical 
current.

Figure 3.16  An LCD monitor has a thin, flat screen.
Flat-screen displays vary in the number of transistors used to create the 
display image. In an active matrix, each individual pixel in the display is 
actively maintained by a separate transistor. Almost all LED screens today are 
an improved variant of an active matrix called thin-film transistor (TFT). 
In a passive matrix (which is cheaper to manufacture), each pixel maintains 
its state on its own until it decays or is refreshed. An OLED screen may be 
active matrix or passive matrix, depending on the model.

NOTE
A high-definition TV (HDTV) can also be used as a computer monitor by connecting the computer to one of its 
high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) input ports.

displays at least 1920 × 1080 resolution (also 
known as 1080p).

(HDMI) A type of connector used to connect an 
HDTV to another device, such as a computer or a

Cathode ray tube (CRT) is an older monitor technology that uses 
a large vacuum tube and electron guns to create a display image on a 
phosphor-covered glass. See Figure 3.17. The electrons strike phosphors 
on the monitor glass and briefly light up. The display is refreshed many 
times per second to maintain the image. The phosphors are arranged in 
triads: red, green, and blue, as shown in Figure 3.18. Depending on what 
color a particular pixel should be, different phosphors illuminate within 
that triad. CRT monitors are heavy and bulky compared to LCDs, and 
have mostly been replaced by LCD monitors. You may still see one in use 
with an older computer, however.

Figure 3.17  A CRT monitor is housed in a large plastic  
boxlike case.
You also may encounter a few specialized monitor types. For example, 
some e-book readers have a special type of screen called electronic paper 
(e-paper). This type of screen retains its image but is unpowered except 
when the display changes, so it uses much less power than a device with 
an LCD screen. A digital or smart whiteboard is a large writing board in 
a conference room or other meeting area that is connected to a computer, 
so that whatever is written on the board is also saved on the computer. 
Digital tools and buttons also appear on the screen for interacting with 
the data collected, as shown in Figure 3.19.

A display screen has a maximum resolution, which is the highest display 
mode it can support. Display modes are expressed as horizontal number 
of pixels × vertical number of pixels, such as 1600 × 900. On an LCD 
monitor, maximum resolution is sometimes called native resolution. 
See Figure 3.20.
resolution The number of pixels that comprise a 
display, horizontally and vertically.
maximum resolution The highest display 
mode (the greatest number of pixels) a display 
can support. 
TIP
One quirk of LCD monitors is that if you use any resolution that is lower than the native one, the display may 
not appear as sharp and crisp. Therefore, you should run an LCD in its native resolution whenever possible. 
If the icons and text are too small to read, adjust the text and icon size in the operating system’s settings.
When selecting a display mode in the operating system, you should 
choose one that matches the aspect ratio of the display screen. The 
aspect ratio is the ratio of width to height—in other words, the relative 
dimensions of the screen. Some monitors have a traditional 4:3 aspect 
ratio, but many LCD screens use a wide-screen 16:9 aspect ratio instead.
All display screens have a maximum refresh rate, the number of times 
each pixel is refreshed per second. The operating system’s display mode 
determines the actual refresh rate that is used. On a CRT, using a high 
refresh rate (greater than 80 Hz) makes the monitor flicker less, result-
ing in less eyestrain for the user. On an LCD monitor, the refresh rate 
is somewhere around 60 Hz but is not as important because an LCD 
monitor is not prone to flickering.
A display screen relies on the computer’s display adapter to tell it what 
to do. The display adapter, in turn, takes its orders from the operating 
system to specify the display mode (resolution, refresh rate, and color 
depth). The display adapter requires its own memory, which it uses to 
hold the color information for each pixel as it operates, and which it uses 
to render 3D objects and control special video effects in certain applica-
tions. If the display adapter is built into the motherboard, the display

display screen, such as 4:3 (standard) or 16:9

display is refreshed per second.

Resolutions and LCD Monitors
Most LCD displays look fuzzy 
at any resolution other than 
their highest one. However, the

Printers
Printers generate hard copy—that is, physical printed pages you can 
hold in your hands. Over the years, there have been many different 
printer technologies, each with its own characteristics and benefits. In 
this section, you’ll learn about several printer types and find out what 
differentiates one printer from another.
Printer Features
When selecting a printer, there are a number of factors to consider:
◾	 Initial cost: How much does the printer cost?
◾	 Per-page cost: How much does it cost to print a page, taking into 
account the price of the consumables? How much does the ink, 
toner, or ribbon cost, and how many pages will it print before you 
have to replace it? Are there other parts in the printer that wear out 
and have to be replaced after a certain number of pages?
◾	 Resolution: How many individual dots per inch (dpi) does the 
printed image consist of? A higher resolution results in a sharper 
image, as shown in Figure 3.21. A low-resolution printer might 
output at 300 dpi, while a high-resolution printer might output at 
1200 dpi.
◾	 Speed: How many pages per minute can the printer output? A typi-
cal printer might output at somewhere between 10 and 20 pages 
per minute for black-and-white and slightly less than that for color.
◾	 Color: Does the printer print in color, or just in black-and-white? 
If it prints in color, can it print photos well? Some printers are 
designed specifically for photos and have special inks for them 
and/or use special glossy paper for photos.
hard copy Physically printed pages of a docu-
ment or a printed photo; the opposite of soft 
(electronic) copy.
consumables Printing supplies that must be 
replaced with use, such as paper and ink.
dots per inch (dpi) A measurement of printed 
image quality, the number of individually colored 
dots in one row (or column) of one inch of the 
printed file. A printout can have a different horizon-
tal and vertical dpi, although this is not common.

Figure 3.21  A high-resolution printout uses more pixels per inch, resulting in smoother lines and finer details.
◾	 Paper handling: Does it have multiple paper trays, so you can have 
two sizes of paper loaded at once? How much paper can it hold 
at once? How well does it print on heavy cardstock or envelopes 
without bending or creasing them? Does the printer have any spe-
cial paper-handling features, such as the capability to print on both 
sides of the paper (duplexing) without the user manually flipping 
the paper over? What is the largest size paper it can accept?
◾	 Interface: Most printers use the USB interface to connect directly to a 
computer. Can the printer also connect to a network? Does it require 
a cable to connect it to the network, or can it connect wirelessly?
◾	 Multi-function: Is it just a printer, or can it perform other tasks too, 
like scanning, copying, and/or faxing? A multi-function device (MFD) 
can save you money and space if you would otherwise have to buy 
separate machines for those functions.
Inkjet Printers
An inkjet printer sprays liquid ink onto a page through a set of very 
small nozzles (ink jets). The depending on the model, an ink jet printer 
uses either heat or electricity to make the ink squirt out of the nozzles. 
Figure 3.22 shows an inkjet printer.
Most inkjet printers are color models, having four separate ink cartridges: 
black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. Some models designed for photo print-
ing have even more cartridges for greater photo realism, and may also 
have a memory card slot so you can print photos directly from the card 
rather than having to go through a computer.

Figure 3.22  An inkjet printer.
Inkjet printers are popular in homes and small businesses because the 
cost of the printer is very low, so it’s economical to get started. However, 
the ink cartridges are expensive and don’t last for very many pages, so 
high-volume printing on an inkjet printer can be very expensive. The 
special glossy paper needed for best-quality photo printing can also be 
expensive.
CAUTION
If an inkjet printer sits idle for weeks at a time, the ink in the nozzles dries out, and you may see quality 
problems with your printouts. Running the printer’s self-cleaning cycle may restore the print quality, but doing 
so wastes some ink, driving up the cost per page even higher. Unfortunately there is not much you can do to 
prevent this; it’s just something to be aware of when selecting a printer technology.
Laser Printers
Laser printers are popular in business because they are fast, they handle 
high-volume printing well, and the cost per page is low. They also pro-
duce good quality, high-resolution output, and both color and black-
and-white models are available. The main drawback is the initial cost, 
which can be higher than for other printer types. Figure 3.23 shows a 
laser printer.
A laser printer prints by creating an image of the page on a rotating drum 
using varying levels of electrical charges. The drum is negatively charged, 
and then a laser neutralizes the charge in some spots. When the drum 
rotates past a reservoir of toner (a powdered mixture of colored plastic 
particles and iron), the toner is attracted to the neutralized areas, and 
clings to the drum. Then the paper rotates past positively charged paper, 
and the toner is pulled off the drum and onto the paper. A fuser element 
heats the paper, melting the plastic particles in the toner so that the par-
ticles stick to the paper permanently.

Specialty Printers
In addition to the printer types discussed so far, a variety of special-
purpose printers exist. You may see some of these printers in businesses, 
schools, and government offices.
Thermal printers transfer images to paper using heat. For example, some 
cash registers use a special thermal-coated paper for receipts; the cash 
register contains a simple direct thermal printer that heats certain areas 
of the paper so that it turns black and forms the text for your receipt. A 
thermal wax transfer printer melts a wax-based ink onto paper in tiny 
dots, using dithering to create different colors. It’s a high-cost, medium-
quality printout that was popular before color laser printers became eco-
nomically feasible for ordinary users, but is seldom seen today. A thermal 
dye transfer printer, sometimes called a dye sublimation printer, heats 
ribbons containing dye and then diffuses the dye into specially coated 
paper. The print quality is outstanding, but the paper and the dye are 
both expensive. Some small-format snapshot printers use this technology.
A plotter is a large-format printer that excels at creating high-precision 
drawings like blueprints, maps, and engineering drawings. Figure 3.24 
shows a plotter. Plotters that use a variety of printing technologies, 
including variants of inkjet and laser, are available. On the other end of 
the size spectrum, some small-format specialty printers work with their 
own software to accomplish specific tasks, such as printing labels, post-
age, or work orders.

Audio Output Devices
The audio adapter in a computer handles both input and output. You 
learned earlier in this chapter how audio input comes in from micro-
phones and digital musical instruments. The most common audio output 
devices are speakers and headphones.
Speaker systems designed for computers are somewhat different from 
speaker systems designed for home stereo and home theater systems. 
Typically, a single 3.5mm plug connects to an output port on the com-
puter; you don’t plug in the speakers separately to the computer. On a 
two-speaker system, one speaker connects to the computer and the other 
speaker connects to the first speaker. A system with more speakers than 
that usually has a central gathering point, such as a subwoofer into which 
all the speakers connect.
Step by Step
Adjusting Sound Output Volume in Windows
Window 7 provides a Volume control in the notification area that you can easily use to 
adjust the overall sound coming from your computer’s speakers or headphone, and also 
mute or unmute the sound. You can also adjust the volume levels for individual compo-
nents. Follow these steps to explore your computer’s sound controls:
	 1.	In the notification area, click the speaker icon. A slider appears.
	 2.	Click the speaker graphic at the bottom of the slider. A red X appears on the button, 
indicating the sound is muted.
	 3.	Click the Mixer hyperlink at the bottom of the slider. A dialog box opens showing 
individual sliders for each adjustable sound-producing item on your system. You 
may have different ones than shown here.

NOTE
Audio can also be output to a portable digital media player such as an iPod or iPhone, but that type of output 
is not the same as sending the audio to a speaker system. When you output music to a digital player, you are 
transferring files to the player, so the process is much more like copying files to an external drive than it is 
setting up sound output. The next section of this chapter discusses file storage and transfer.
Choosing Appropriate Storage Devices
As you learned in Chapter 2, when a computer processes data, RAM 
(Random Access Memory) holds that data temporarily. RAM is known as 
primary storage because it’s where the data must be in order to interact 
with the CPU. Data waits for the CPU’s attention in memory, and then 
it waits again in memory when the CPU has finished processing it.
For data to be safely and permanently stored, however, it must be placed 
in secondary storage. Secondary storage devices are nonvolatile, so 
they don’t lose their contents when the computer’s power is turned off. 
Secondary storage can include hard disk drives, solid state drives, CDs, 
DVDs, and network and cloud-based storage.
Storage devices are evaluated in these ways:
◾	 Capacity: How much can it hold?
◾	 Cost: How much does the storage cost per megabyte or gigabyte?
primary storage System RAM in a computer, 
where processed data is first stored after it exits 
the CPU.
secondary storage Storage that retains data 
after the computer is turned off, such as a hard 
disk drive, DVD, or USB flash drive.

◾	 Access speed: How quickly can the data be written and retrieved?
◾	 Interface: How does it connect to the computer, and how fast is 
that connection?
◾	 Media type: Is it magnetic, optical, or solid state?
◾	 Portability: Is the storage inside the system unit, or connected to it 
externally?
◾	 Removability: Is the disc removable from the drive that reads and 
writes it, or are they one inseparable unit?
In the following sections, you will learn about storage in general, and 
about several types of storage devices and their characteristics.
Data Storage Basics
A file is a named collection of bits that work together to represent a single 
object, such as an executable program, a spreadsheet, a picture, or a system 
file. Folders are logical organizing units for files. For example, a Windows-
based computer has a Windows folder containing the system files needed 
to run Windows, a Users folder containing the data files and settings for 
each user account, and a Program Files folder containing the files needed 
for each installed application. A folder within a folder is called a subfolder; 
each of the aforementioned folders contains multiple subfolders. Files and 
folders are stored on volumes. Each volume has a letter followed by a 
colon, such as C: or D:. Figure 3.25 summarizes this structure.
Some people use the terms disk (or disc), drive, and volume interchange-
ably, but they have different meanings. The term disk refers to a platter 
or set of platters on which data is stored. Examples include a hard disk 
drive (HDD) and a DVD. When referring to a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray, it is 
customary to spell the term disc. The term drive refers to the mechanical 
components that read and write the data on a disk. In some cases, such as 
with an HDD, the drive and its platters are physically inseparable, so the 
terms disk and drive have come to be synonymous; hard disk and hard 
drive refer to the same thing. When the disc is removable from the drive, 
however, as with a CD or DVD, the terms are separate. See Figure 3.26.
Figure 3.25  Files are stored in folders, which are stored on volumes.
file A group of related bits stored together under 
a single name.
folder A logical organizing unit for grouping 
related files together.
subfolder A folder within another folder.
volume A physical storage device, or a portion 
of one, that is assigned an identifying letter. 
Sometimes used interchangeably with drive, but 
a physical drive may actually contain multiple 
volumes.
disk One or more platters on which data is 
stored. Spelled disc when referring to the optical 
type (DVDs, CDs).
drive The mechanical components that read and 
write the data on a disk.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Figure 3.26  In hard disk drives, the disk and drive are one unit; in optical drives, the disc 
and drive are separate.
Solid-state storage devices such as USB flash drives are technically neither 
discs nor drives, because they have no platters and no moving parts. 
However, they are commonly referred to as drives anyway, as in the term 
solid-state drive (SSD).
Most commonly, each physical storage device acts as a single volume. For 
example, your DVD drive might have a volume letter of E: assigned to 
it. However, some high-capacity storage devices such as hard disk drives 
can be partitioned into multiple volumes, each of which appears in the 
operating system to be a separate storage device with its own letter.
Hard Disk Drives
A hard disk drive (HDD) is the most popular type of secondary stor-
age for personal computers. Although newer technologies are emerging, 
HDDs remain the standard because of their high capacity and low cost.
An HDD consists of a stack of metal platters (usually four to six) that are 
coated with iron dust. These platters spin on a common spindle inside a 
sealed metal casing. A set of read/write heads inside the HDD casing 
reads and writes data on the platters; there are heads on each side of each 
platter. The arms move in and out to reach different spots on the plat-
ters, and the disks move past the heads as they spin. The most common 
platter sizes are 3.5” in diameter on HDDs for desktop systems and 2.5” 
on HDDs for notebooks. Figure 3.27 shows the inside of a hard disk 
drive case.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
A precise system exists for describing the physical locations on an HDD. 
The platters are divided into concentric circles, like the rings on a tree 
trunk cross-section, called tracks. Each platter’s first track is track 0, the 
next one track 1, and so on. The track number tells the drive where to 
position the actuator arm that controls the position of the read/write 
heads. All the heads move together, so if one head is reading track 1 on 
one side of one platter, all the other heads are also reading track 1 on 
their side of their platter too. For this reason, tracks are not referred to 
individually, but as cylinders. A cylinder is the group of all the tracks at 
a single arm position. Figure 3.28 illustrates the relationship between 
these parts.
Figure 3.28  A hard disk drive is organized into tracks, cylinders, heads, and sectors.
Each track is divided into segments called sectors. A sector holds exactly 
512 bytes. Because there are so many sectors, and because almost every 
file is much larger than 512 bytes, sectors are grouped together into 
clusters, and the drive’s controller addresses clusters rather than indi-
vidual sectors. The number of sectors per cluster is determined by the 
drive’s size and formatting, but most modern HDDs have 32 sectors per 
cluster.
An HDD can be internal or external, but most are internal, installed 
inside the system unit. An internal HDD connects to the motherboard 
using either a parallel ATA (PATA) or serial ATA (SATA) cable. An 
external HDD connects to a port on the outside of the system unit, and 
depending on the model may use a USB port, a FireWire (IEEE 1394a) 
port, or an external SATA (eSATA) port. You can buy enclosures that 
will convert an internal HDD to an external one.
See “Drive Connectors” in Chapter 2 for more information about PATA 
and SATA. See the section “Other Common External Connectors” in 
Chapter 2 to learn more about USB and FireWire.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Optical Drives
An optical drive uses a light beam and sensor to read the data. The sur-
face of a blank optical disc is shiny and reflects light strongly. When data 
is written to an optical disc, certain areas are burned with a laser so they 
are less reflective. The shiny areas are called land, and the less-shiny areas 
are called pits. Recall from the preceding section that on an HDD, transi-
tions between positive and negative magnetic polarity indicate a 1 bit, and 
lack of transition indicates a 0 bit. On an optical disc, transitions between 
areas of greater and lesser reflectivity indicate a 1, and a consistent level of 
reflectivity indicates a 0. See Figure 3.29.
Figure 3.29  Magnetic and optical storage both look for transitions in the state of the disc 
surface.
There are several types of optical drives and discs. The oldest and most 
basic type is a compact disc (CD), which holds up to 900MB of data. 
CDs are used for small amounts of data and also for audio recordings. 
A digital versatile disc (DVD) can store up to 4.7GB per disc (single-
sided, single layer). DVDs can also be double-sided, with recordings 
on both sides rather than recording on one and a label on the other. 
DVDs can also be dual-layer, where the top layer is semitransparent and 
read using a laser and sensor at a different angle than the lower layer. A 
double-sided, dual-layer DVD can hold up to 17GB of data. DVDs are 
used to distribute large applications, large amounts of data, and standard-
definition movies. Blu-ray discs (BD) can store up to 128GB in up to 
four layers. They are used to distribute even larger amounts of data, or 
high-definition movies.
All three types of discs can be read-only (ROM), recordable once (R), or 
rewriteable (RW). To record or rewrite a disc, you must have a drive with 
that capability that supports the type of disc you are using.
DVDs come in two competing recordable and rewriteable standards, 
abbreviated as plus and minus signs, like this: DVD+R and DVD-R. 
Some older home stereo systems do not support reading from +R and 
+RW discs, but otherwise the differences are unnoticeable to most 
consumers.

stored in patterns of greater and lesser reflectivity, 
such as a DVD or CD.

storing music and data, holding up to 900 MB.

Solid-State Drives
A solid-state drive (SSD) uses a type of EEPROM to store data in tiny 
transistors. As you learned in Chapter 2, electrically erasable program-
mable read-only memory (EEPROM) is a type of memory that stores its 
contents permanently; it is nonvolatile. Because it is electrically erasable, 
the computer can erase what’s written there and rewrite it. The type of 
EEPROM used in solid-state drives can be erased and rewritten in small 
blocks, making it suitable for use as a storage device.
When a solid-state drive is a large-capacity replacement for an HDD, it’s 
sometimes called a solid-state hard drive (SSHD) to distinguish it from 
lower-capacity portable solid-state storage, such as USB flash drives. 
Figure 3.30 shows a solid-state hard drive.

Figure 3.30  A solid-state hard drive looks much like an HDD  
from the outside.
Solid-state drives are silent because they don’t have any moving parts, 
and the access time is very fast because there are no read/write heads 
that have to move anywhere to get to the data. SSDs are more expensive 
than HDDs, though; you get much less capacity for the money. For this 
reason, SSHDs are found mostly in high-end desktop and notebook 
computers. Solid-state storage is common in tablets and smartphones, 
where high-capacity storage is not needed and being lightweight is a 
primary concern.
To balance between performance and cost, some systems have both a 
small SSD and a larger HDD. The SSD contains the start-up files and the 
operating system, and the HDD holds everything else. Hybrid drives are 
also available that combine the two technologies in a single physical unit.
solid-state hard drive (SSHD) A high-­capacity 
solid-state storage device that substitutes for an 
HDD as the main storage drive in a computer.
CAUTION
Optical discs are sturdy, but scratches, dirt, and fingerprints can prevent them from being read accurately. 
Store discs in a protective sleeve or case when you are not using them, and hold discs only by their edges. 
Don’t let anything touch the shiny side of the disc, especially anything sharp or abrasive. If you need to write 
on a disc, write only on the label side, and use only a suitable soft marking pen.

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Network Volumes
As you’ve seen so far in this chapter, most computer storage is directly 
attached to the individual computer. This is known as local storage, or 
direct-attached storage (DAS). However, computers can also use a 
network to access storage that’s not physically nearby.
Network storage can enable multiple users to access the same up-to-
the-minute information simultaneously. For example, in a retail business 
with multiple checkout areas, all the checkout computers access a com-
mon database containing the item prices so that when the price of an 
item changes, all cashiers immediately have that information available. On 
a smaller scale, a family could store its movie and music collection on one 
computer, which then can share the collection with all the other com-
puters in the household via the family’s wireless network. Storage that is 
available via a network is called network-attached storage (NAS).
Generically speaking, network-attached storage can be a volume on a file 
server in a business network or a shared folder on an individual’s personal 
computer. However, the term is most often applied to a NAS appliance, 
which is a specialized computing device built specifically for network file 
sharing. The appliance connects directly into the network, and can be 
remotely configured from any computer, so it doesn’t need its own input 
or output devices. NAS appliances are available for consumers as well as 
businesses; for example, you could connect an inexpensive NAS appliance 
to your home network to provide everyone in your family with always-on 
access to shared files.
Some large companies employ storage-area networks (SANs) to make 
central access to large amounts of data simple. A SAN logically combines 
the contents of multiple remote storage devices so that each individual com-
puter connected to the SAN sees that storage pool as a single local drive.
When it is essential that data be kept safe and readily available, some 
companies store that data on a redundant array of inexpensive disks 
(RAID). There are several types of RAID systems, and each type offers 
improvements over a single disk drive in performance, in data safety, or 
in both. Usually, when you store data on a disk you write to one disk at a 
time. RAID systems have the capability to spread the data across multiple 
drives so each physical disk contains part of the data; this is called striping. 
For example, RAID0 stripes data across multiple physical disks to improve 
the speed at which data is accessed, and RAID1 mirrors the contents of a 
physical disk on another identical disk so that the data is always available 
even if the original disk fails. RAID5 combines the striping from RAID0 
with a data storage method that enables the RAID unit to reconstruct lost 
data on any of the physical disks in the event of a disk failure.
Cloud-Based Storage
A cloud is a secure computing environment consisting of a set of 
remote servers that users access via the Internet. A cloud can include 
applications, communication with other users, and storage space (cloud 
storage).
direct-attached storage (DAS) Storage 
that is directly connected to the computer that 
accesses it.
network-attached storage (NAS) Storage 
that is accessed via a network.

vides storage space to network users.
storage-area network (SAN) A distributed 
storage system that appears to each individual 
computer as a local volume on that computer.

(RAID) A multi-disk storage system that opti-
mizes performance, data safety, or both, depend-
ing on the type.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
One of the most popular individual cloud storage systems is Microsoft 
OneDrive. If you have a Microsoft account (which is free), you automati-
cally get several gigabytes of OneDrive storage online. It is a secure stor-
age environment, and you can optionally choose to share certain folders 
or files with specific other people or with the public. Google also offers 
free cloud-based storage to users, as do many other online companies.
Businesses of all sizes also employ cloud storage. For example, a busi-
ness with many locations might create a cloud-based information system 
for all employees to access, regardless of where they are. This informa-
tion system might include customer and product information, order 
information, access to human resources data such as vacation schedules, 
and company-wide announcements and memos. A large company might

Chapter 3: Input, Output, and Storage
Summary
Selecting and Using Input Devices
Input devices allow the user to communicate with the computer. The most common input 
devices are a keyboard and mouse, both of which can be either wired or wireless. A keyboard can 
have an ergonomic design to prevent hand and wrist strain. Devices that lack a real keyboard use a 
virtual keyboard (software-based) to enable user input.
A pointing device controls the onscreen pointer in the user interface. A mouse can be mechanical 
or optical. Other pointing devices include trackball and touchpad. Some computers have a touch 
screen on which your finger can serve as a pointing device. A drawing tablet enables you to input 
drawings using a stylus.
A scanner digitizes a hard-copy photo using a charge-coupled device (CCD). A scanner can 
be part of a multi-function device (MFD) that also includes a printer and copier. A bar code 
reader is a specialized type of scanner used for reading Universal Product Code (UPC) symbols. 
Magnetic bar code readers and radio frequency identification (RFID) chips are other types of 
scanning devices, as are optical mark recognition (OMR) systems and magnetic-ink character 
recognition (MICR) systems.
A capture device captures new content, rather than scanning existing content. Examples include 
digital cameras and digital video cameras. A webcam is a digital video camera that must remain 
connected to a computer in order to function.
Audio input can be used to control a computer with commands and to input music and sounds. 
Audio input requires an audio adapter (sound card). When using a microphone for audio input, 
voice recognition software interprets speech by matching words in a database; speech recogni-
tion software is teachable software that learns an individual’s pronunciation.
Selecting and Using Output Devices
A display screen is a video screen the computer uses for outputting information to the user. A 
stand-alone display screen is called a monitor. Liquid crystal display (LCD) is a popular type 
of flat-screen monitor technology. A newer alternative is organic light-emitting diode (OLED). 
An LCD screen can be either active matrix (a version of which is thin-film transistor) or passive 
matrix. In active matrix, each pixel has its own transistor. A high-definition TV (HDTV) can 
also be used as a computer monitor via a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI).
Cathode ray tube (CRT) is an older monitor technology that uses a vacuum tube and electron 
guns to light up colored phosphors on a glass screen. Phosphors are arranged in triads of red, 
green, and blue.
Some specialized display types include e-paper (for book readers), digital whiteboards, and digi-
tal projectors. Projector brightness is measured in lumens.
A display screen has a maximum resolution, expressed as a number of pixels horizontally and 
vertically. The ratio of horizontal to vertical is its aspect ratio. The refresh rate is the number of 
times per second the display is refreshed. The number of bits needed to describe the color of a 
pixel is the color depth. A display adapter tells the display screen what to do.
The key factors in selecting a printer include initial cost, cost per page for consumables, print 
resolution (expressed in dots per inch), speed, color, interface, and paper handling.

Part I: Computer Basics and Hardware
An ink jet printer squirts liquid ink onto paper. The printer is inexpensive to buy, and produces 
good quality color graphics, but the cost per page is high because of the cost of the ink cartridges. 
A laser printer transfers toner to a drum and then to paper, and then fuses the toner to the 
paper. It is economical per page and produces good quality output, but is expensive to buy ini-
tially. Specialty printers include direct thermal, thermal wax transfer, thermal dye transfer, and 
plotters.
Audio output comes through speakers and headphones. Speakers designed for computer use are 
powered, and have shielding to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Choosing Appropriate Storage Devices
Primary storage is RAM; secondary storage is permanent storage, such as a disk. A disk is a 
platter (or multiple platters) that stores data; a drive is the mechanical component that reads and 
writes the data. In some storage types, the disk and drive are inseparable.
A hard disk drive (HDD) is the most popular type of secondary storage for personal computers. 
It is magnetic and mechanical, and usually internal to the system unit. Read/write heads store the 
data in sectors on tracks. A group of sectors is a cluster. A group of tracks at a specific read/write 
head position is a cylinder. HDDs can use either PATA or SATA connectors internally, or USB, 
FireWire, or eSATA externally.
An optical drive uses a light beam and sensor to read data on compact discs (CD), digital versa-
tile discs (DVD), and/or Blu-ray discs (BD).
A solid-state drive (SSD) uses EEPROM to store data in tiny transistors. Solid-state hard drives 
(SSHD) are a substitute for traditional HDDs as the main secondary storage in a computer.
Local drives are direct-attached storage (DAS). Network-accessible storage is network-attached 
storage (NAS). NAS appliances are simple computers designed to be used as network storage. A 
storage-area network (SAN) makes remote storage appear as a local volume on each individual 
computer.
A redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) is a system that uses multiple physical HDDs to 
increase performance and reliability by spreading the data out across all the disks and implement-
ing schemes for reconstructing the data in the event of one disk’s failure.
Cloud storage is storage that the user accesses online via a cloud, which is a secure computing 
environment online.

Speech Recognition in Windows 7
In Windows 7, turn on speech recognition. To do so, open the Control Panel and type speech in 
the search box. Next, click Windows Speech Recognition and work through the wizard to config-
ure the feature. Then start Speech Recognition by saying Start Listening.
Next, open Microsoft Word, start a new blank document, and speak the following text into your 
microphone:
I am learning to use a microphone as an input device in Windows 7. I am dictating this text 
aloud, and Microsoft Word is typing it for me. Speech recognition is part of Windows 7’s 
Ease of Access features.
When you are finished speaking, correct any errors. Then either save or discard the Word docu-
ment, as your instructor directs you to do.
Think It Over
How Much Does Printing Really Cost?
Suppose your employer needs to print about 3,000 invoices a month. He asks you to recommend 
a printer type and to prepare a cost estimate for the purchase of a printer. Weigh the options avail-
able, and do some Internet research to find suitable models and their prices. Research the cost of 
the consumables for the printers as well.
Prepare a report that summarizes the initial cost to buy the printer as well as the cost of consum-
ables. Check the printer’s documentation online to find out if there are any other parts that periodi-
cally need to be replaced (for example, the drum in a laser printer may need replacing at some point) 
and the number of pages the printer can produce before that replacement is necessary. Present the 
consumable cost per page, as well as an estimate of the monthly and yearly consumable cost.
Optional: Find a printer that has a lower cost per page than the printer you initially chose, and 
prepare the same report as before with the new cost data.
Solid-State Drives
Solid-state hard drives (SSHD) are more expensive than HDDs, as you learned in this chapter. 
Nevertheless, some businesses are adopting them as the main storage devices for new personal 
computers that the companies buy. What might be the reasoning behind this? Brainstorm a list of 
the benefits you get with an SSHD compared to an HDD.
Optional: Use the Internet to research what other consumers who have purchased solid-state hard 
drives have said.
Backing Up Your Files
Suppose you want to back up your entire MP3 and home video collection, which currently 
occupies 100 GB on your computer’s main HDD. Would it be better to buy an external HDD to 
do the backup, or to back the files up onto optical discs? Consider not only cost, but also conve-
nience, reliability, and ease of retrieving the files later. If you chose optical discs, which type would 
you use, and how many of them would you need? If you chose an external HDD, what size would 
you buy—one that the files barely fit on, or one with room for more files you might acquire later?

◽	 Understand the types of operating systems available
◽	 Differentiate among the major desktop operating systems
◽	 Explain computer file storage concepts 
When you think about using a computer, you probably think about performing 
some useful task with it, or playing a game. Behind the scenes, though, is the soft-
ware that keeps the computer running and responding to commands: the operat-
ing system (OS).
The operating system you use can make a big difference in how the computer 
behaves, how it responds to commands, what applications it can run, and what 
add-on hardware you can attach. By understanding the available operating sys-
tems and their benefits, you can make the right choice in selecting an operating 
system—or you can choose to purchase a device with the right operating system 
already built in.
In this chapter, you will learn about system software in general and how operating 
systems work. You’ll survey several popular operating systems, and learn how they 
communicate with hardware, with the Internet, and with the user. You will also 
find out how computers store and manage files.

Understanding System Software
System software includes BIOS, the operating system, and utility 
programs that perform system maintenance and protection tasks such as 
error correction and backup. Let’s look at each category in more detail.
The System BIOS
As you learned in Chapter 2, “The System Unit,” the Basic Input/
Output System (BIOS) is the built-in software on the motherboard that 
starts the computer. It performs a power-on self-test (POST) at start-
up, which ensures that all the critical hardware devices are functioning 
properly, including the CPU, the RAM, and the motherboard. If the 
hardware passes the tests, the BIOS looks for an operating system on 
one of the available drives, and then passes off control to the operating 
system to complete the boot process. The BIOS has a list of default set-
tings it uses for managing memory and devices, but those settings can be 
overridden by user settings that you specify.
The Operating System
The BIOS starts the computer at a basic level, but the operating system 
does the bulk of work to keep it running and to help the user accomplish 
tasks. Remember from Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” that the operating 
system performs these important functions (see Figure 4.1):
◾	 It provides the user interface that humans use to communicate 
commands and receive feedback.
◾	 It communicates with the hardware, instructing it to take action to 
accomplish tasks. For example, it communicates with the keyboard 
and mouse to accept input, and it communicates with the display 
screen to show output.
◾	 It runs applications and enables humans to interact with them.
◾	 It controls and manages the file storage system.
system software Software that starts the 
computer and keeps it running, performing basic 
system tasks such as running applications, man-
aging files, and correcting errors.
Careers in IT
Programmer
A programmer writes the instructions that become 
computer programs. Whether it’s an operating system, a 
utility, or a game, a programmer takes a general concept 
like “open a dialog box with user controls for adjusting 
the graphics quality” and makes it a reality by writing the 
exact instructions needed, line by line. The programmer 
then compiles those instructions into a usable program, 
or combines them with the instructions written by another 
programmer or group of programmers to make a larger 
program. More experienced programmers may also par-
ticipate in developing the requirements for a program. A 
programmer should have at least an associate degree in 
Computer Technology, Computer Science, or Information 
Technology, and should be familiar with at least two or 
three different programming languages.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
Figure 4.1  The functions performed by an operating system.
There are many kinds of operating systems, suited for a wide range of 
devices, from supercomputers to smartphones. Each operating system is 
optimized for the hardware it runs on and the tasks the user is likely to 
want to perform. For example, the operating system on a tablet com-
puter is designed to be compact (because there is limited storage space in 
the tablet), easy to operate (because most users are not computer profes-
sionals), and fast to respond to simple commands, whereas the operat-
ing system in a server is designed to give computer professionals many 
options for managing and configuring the server and supporting users 
and databases.
An operating system can have either a graphical user interface (GUI) 
or a command-line interface. GUI interfaces are the norm in operating 
systems designed for most personal computing devices, such as desktops, 
notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. Users interact with the graph-
ics they see onscreen by using a keyboard or mouse, or using a finger 
or stylus on a touch screen. In a command-line interface, users employ 
a keyboard to type commands at a prompt; the interface is text-only. 
Command-line operating systems were common in the early days of 
computing, but nowadays they are confined mostly to server operating 
systems. Figure 4.2 compares a GUI to a command-line interface.
graphical user interface (GUI) A user inter-
face based on a graphical environment, in which 
users interact with it using a pointing device or 
touch screen as the primary input device.
command-line interface A user interface 
based on typing text at a command prompt.

Utility Software
Utility software performs a task (or set of tasks) that optimizes, repairs, 
or safeguards the computer or its data. The difference between utility 
software and the operating system is sometimes not clear-cut, because 
most operating systems come with many utility programs built-in. For 
example, Microsoft Windows comes with utilities for checking a disk for 
errors and optimizing the way files are stored on an HDD (hard disk 
drive). Third-party utility software is also available, and may do a more 
thorough job at the task, combine multiple functions in a single inter-
face, or have more advanced options for configuring how the tasks will 
run. Figure 4.3 shows the Norton Security Suite, which provides secu-
rity, identity protection, a backup utility, and a PC tune-up utility.
Figure 4.3  A third-party application such as Norton Security Suite provides several  
different utilities.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
There are many types of utilities that protect the computer from 
attack by malware (harmful or maliciously created software). Antivirus 
programs find and remove viruses, for example; anti-spyware software 
finds and removes spyware and adware; firewall software blocks 
hackers from invading your system; and anti-spam software detects 
and segregates junk email. Some all-in-one protection suites such as 
Norton Security Suite protect against many types of threats at once. 
You will learn more about the different types of malware and their 
detection and removal in Chapter 11, “Network and Internet Privacy 
and Security.”
Other utilities detect problems with the computer’s operation. For 
example, a disk checking program can find and fix errors in the file 
system on a volume, and a registry cleanup program can find and fix 
inconsistent or unneeded entries in the registry, which is the system 
configuration database that Microsoft Windows uses. An uninstaller 
utility removes installed software along with any associated files and 
registry entries.
Backup software makes backup copies of your important files on a sepa-
rate drive, for safekeeping. You can automate and schedule the backup 
process so it occurs without your intervention at whatever interval you 
specify.
malware Malicious software that consists 
of ­programs designed to disrupt the normal 
­operation of computer systems.
virus A type of malware that attaches itself to an 
executable file and spreads to other files when the 
program is run.
spyware A type of malware that spies on the 
user’s activities and reports them back to the 
spyware’s developer.
adware A type of malware that pops up 
unwanted ads on the screen.
firewall software Software that blocks hackers 
from accessing a computer by closing unneces-
sary services and ports.
anti-spam software Software that rejects junk 
email messages.
disk checking program Software that finds 
and fixes errors in the disk storage system.
registry cleanup program Software that ana-
lyzes the Windows registry and deletes unneeded 
entries.

Comparing the Major 
Operating Systems
When you think about operating systems, you probably think first 
of Microsoft Windows, which is the operating system used on more 
than 90 percent of all desktop and notebook PCs. You will learn a lot 
about Microsoft Windows in upcoming chapters. However, there are 
many other operating systems, designed for a variety of computers and 
computer-related devices.
Desktop and Notebook  
Operating Systems
There are two main hardware platforms for desktop and notebook com-
puters: Apple and Intel (IBM-compatible). The Apple Macintosh plat-
form supports only the Apple operating system: Mac OS X (pronounced 
Mac O-S-X, although the X technically is the Roman numeral 10). This 
operating system has an attractive GUI and is easy to understand and 
use. Apple assigns the versions of Mac OS X code names as well as ver-
sion numbers. The most recent version at this writing is called Mavericks 
(version 10.9). Figure 4.4 shows the Mavericks version of Mac OS X.

Part II: Software
The Macintosh platform has been popular with graphics professionals for 
decades, and much of the best page layout and graphics editing software 
was originally developed for the Mac. However, in recent years, similar 
software has become available for both Windows and Mac, so there is 
no reason to choose a Mac based on software compatibility anymore. 
Although Mac hardware is not cross-compatible with Windows software, 
Mac software is cross-compatible with the Intel platform. The latest ver-
sion of Mac OS X will run on both Macintosh and Intel computers.
Most Intel-based systems use Microsoft Windows. Like Mac OS X, 
Windows also has an attractive GUI and is easy to learn and use. Windows 
has the advantage of being the most popular OS, and therefore the one 
that more applications are written to run on.
The most recent version at this writing is Windows 8.1, but Windows 7 
is still widely used worldwide, and is the version featured in this book. 
Chapter 5 (“Introduction to Windows 7”) introduces you to Windows 7; 
you will learn there how to run programs and manage files. Figure 4.5 
shows the Windows 7 user interface.
Linux (pronounced LIN-ucks) is an operating system that looks and 
feels very similar to UNIX. It can run on a variety of platforms, includ-
ing Intel-based desktops and notebooks, servers, and handheld devices. 
(Android, a popular OS for smartphones and tablets, is a variant of 
Linux.)
Microsoft Windows The graphical Microsoft 
operating system designed for Intel-platform 
desktop and notebook computers.

system that runs on desktops, notebooks, tablets, 
and smartphones.

Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds. The name Linux is a com-
bination of the words Linus and UNIX. Linux is open-source, which 
means that Mr. Torvalds retains ownership of his original code, but 
it is free to the public to use in any way they see fit. Users are free to 
modify the code, improve it, and redistribute it. Developers are not 
allowed to charge money for the Linux kernel itself (the main part of 
the operating system), but they can charge money for distributions 
(distros for short), which are packaged collections of add-ons and 
utility programs for Linux. Some of the most popular distros include 
SUSE Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Linux.
distribution or distro A packaged collection of 
an open-source kernel such as Linux along with 
helpful add-ons and utilities.
Running More than One OS
If you want to run multiple operating systems on a single PC, one way is to set it up to multi-boot. Each time you 
start the computer, a menu appears asking which operating system you want to start up. Each operating system 
must be on a separate volume in order to multi-boot. Windows supports multi-booting; install the non-Windows OS 
first, and then when you install Windows, its Setup program will ask whether you want to set up multi-booting. The 
drawback to multi-booting is that each time you want to switch operating systems, you have to restart the computer.
Another way to experience multiple operating systems on the same PC is to use a virtualization program. 
Virtualization enables you to create an entire virtual machine inside an application, and install a different operat-
ing system on it. The main operating system of the PC is the host OS, and the one inside the virtual machine is 
the guest OS. You can easily switch back and forth between the host and guest operating systems. VMWare (www.
vmware.com/products) is the most popular virtualization software; versions are available for individual PCs as 
well as for large-scale commercial use, such as running several server OS versions on the same server.
multi-boot The ability to have more than one 
OS installed and to choose at startup which one 
to run.
virtualization Running a different operating 
system in a windowed environment within another 
operating system.
virtual machine An operating system running 
within another operating system.

Part II: Software
Linux is, at its core, a command-line operating system, as is UNIX. 
However, nearly all the distros contain multiple shells—utilities that allow 
a user to interact with the operating system. Most distros have a GUI 
sitting on top of the shell. These are highly graphical, and as attractive 
and easy to use as Windows and Mac OS X. Figure 4.6 shows the Ubuntu 
Linux shell, for example. Although most Windows and Mac OS X appli-
cations will not run in Linux, plenty of free, open-source equivalents for 
most software types are designed specifically for Linux, or have Linux 
versions.
Figure 4.6  The Ubuntu Linux GUI.
Some portable computers, such as netbooks, don’t require a powerful 
operating system like Windows for the simple tasks they are designed 
to perform, like checking email and surfing the web. On such comput-
ers, performance is better, and more storage space remains when a thin 
client operating system is used. A thin client is an operating system that 
is “thinner” (that is, smaller and more agile) than a regular desktop oper-
ating system. It doesn’t have a lot of utilities or features, but it has the 
right ones for the system on which it is installed.
One popular thin client operating system is Chrome OS. Chrome is the 
name of both an operating system and a web browser, both produced by 
Google. Chrome OS is a variant of Linux, and was developed through an 
open-source project called Chromium OS. This simple operating system 
comes preinstalled on some thin clients. It contains a simple file manager, 
the Google Chrome web browser, and a media player. It doesn’t run 
most applications designed for other operating systems. Figure 4.7 shows 
a Chrome OS screen.

New Thin Client Operating Systems
Chrome OS is far from the only operating system for thin web clients. Several other open-source operating systems 
have recently been released, such as Haiku (www.haiku-os.org), openThinClient (openthinclient.org), and 
ThinStation (www.thinstation.org). These operating systems require less powerful computers than Windows 
or Mac OS X because they are leaner and have fewer features. Using a thin client operating system on an older 
­computer can make it perform better when doing activities like browsing the web or managing email. The downside of 
using a non-standard operating system is that few applications are available for it, so you may be limited to the applica-
tions that come with it (usually a text editor, a web browser, an email program, and a music player, at the minimum).

Operating Systems for Tablets 
and Smartphones
Tablets and smartphones have special operating system needs. They 
use solid-state storage, which is expensive, so the amount of storage 
space is limited. Therefore, a large operating system is impractical; the 
operating system must be simple, easy to use, and above all, compact in 
size. The operating system comes preinstalled on a static memory chip 
on tablets and smartphones, so these platforms are often referred to 
as system-on-chip (SoC). A separate memory chip (or set of chips) is 
used to hold the data you create and the extra applications you install.
For most of their capabilities, tablet and phone operating systems rely on 
third-party applications (apps) purchased or downloaded for free from 
an online store. Because users can freely select their own apps, there is no 
need to provide lots of preinstalled apps with the operating system, and 
each person’s device can be customized for his or her preferred activities.
Portable Apple devices (iPhone and iPad) use an operating system called 
iOS. Its main advantage is its popularity—because it is so popular, thou-
sands of apps are available for it via the Apple Store. Figure 4.8 shows an 
iPad screen with iOS as the operating system.

The main competitor to iOS is Android, an open-source OS created by 
Google. Android is popular on low-end tablets because it is free, and 
because many apps are available for it and most of them are free. Many 
smartphones also use a version of Android.
Microsoft has two different versions 
of Windows for portable devices. 
For tablets, there is Windows RT, 
which is much like the desktop ver-
sion of Windows but designed for 
SoC devices. Most desktop applica-
tions won’t run on a Windows RT 
system. For smartphones, there is 
Windows Phone, an operating sys-
tem designed specifically for phone 
use. Figure 4.9 shows a Windows

Understanding Digital Storage
Most operating systems save and store files using the same basic prin-
ciples, although the individual file formats may differ between platforms 
and operating systems. The following sections describe the logical orga-
nization of computer file systems.
Drives, Volumes, and File Systems
A drive is a physical storage unit, such as an HDD, a SSD, or a DVD 
drive. As you learned in Chapter 3, “Input, Output, and Storage,” some 
drives are separate from their discs, as a DVD drive is. Other drives have 
the discs built-in, like in an HDD. And some drives are not technically 
“drives” at all, in that they have no moving parts, but are called drives 
for consistency; solid-state drives are an example of that. The term hard 
drive generically refers to both HDD and SSHD storage in popular 
usage.
Each drive has one or more volumes, which are logical divisions of storage 
areas. Volumes are represented by letters, such as C:. A small-capacity, 
removable storage device like a DVD or a USB flash drive has a single vol-
ume letter. A large-capacity storage device like an HDD or SSHD may be 
divided into multiple volumes.
To prepare a hard drive for use, it must first be partitioned. Partitioning 
creates the logical divisions of the available space. A physical drive can 
logically be a single volume (one big partition with one volume letter 
assigned), or it can be split up into many pieces, each with its own vol-
ume letter. Each volume must then be formatted. Formatting organizes 
the available space by creating a file system on it. The file system deter-
mines how the files will be stored and retrieved logically.
Depending on the operating system and the utility you are using to parti-
tion and format the drive, different file systems may be available. Table 4.1 
lists several popular file systems. Modern versions of Windows prefer the 
New Technology File System (NTFS) for the system volume (that is, 
the volume on which Windows itself is installed), but can also support 
FAT32, a file system used in earlier Windows versions. Mac OS X uses a 
file system called Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+). Linux supports 
several different file systems, and the default file system installed depends on 
the distro. CDs and DVDs commonly use the ISO 9660 (also called CD 
File System, or CDFS) or the Universal Disc Format (UDF) file system.
Different file systems offer different features and benefits. NTFS, for 
example, provides features like file encryption, file compression, support 
for long filenames (up to 255 characters), and support for large-capacity 
volumes (up to16 TB). You will learn about file encryption and compres-
sion later in this chapter.

Windows uses a Disk Management utility to provide information about 
the system’s disks and drives and to allow users to perform disk-based 
maintenance operations.
How Files Are Organized in Folders
The top level of storage for a volume is its root directory. The root 
directory is like the lobby of a building. All other locations within the 
volume are accessed by going through it. The term root directory is a car-
ryover from an earlier time when folders were called directories. Another 
name for the root directory is top-level folder.
A file’s path is the complete descriptor of its location. A file named 
Budget.txt located in the root directory of the E: drive, for example, 
would have a path like this:
E:\Budget.txt
The colon (:) in the preceding example path indicates that the letter 
preceding it is a volume letter. The \ follows a folder (directory) name. 
The example has no name before the \ because the root directory has no 
name.
Now suppose that file were in a folder called Personal. Its path would 
look like this:
E:\Personal\Budget.txt
As you learned in Chapter 3, a folder within a folder is called a subfolder. 
Suppose that the Personal folder had a subfolder called Financial, and 
our example file was in that folder. The path would look like this:
E:\Personal\Financial\Budget.txt
A volume’s folder hierarchy can be complicated. There can be hundreds 
of folders in the root directory, and each of them can contain many 
levels of subfolders. A file management utility, such as Windows Explorer 
in Windows 7, provides a visual picture of the structure that you can 
browse. For example, in Figure 4.10, the example file appears in the 
Financial folder. The folder tree in the navigation pane at the left shows 
the complete path taken to get to that file.
root directory The top-level folder on a storage 
volume.
path The complete descriptor of a file’s location, 
including the volume and folders.

volume’s storage hierarchy, with subordinate 
branches for folders and subfolders.

Figure 4.10  The Budget.txt file’s complete path is illustrated in the navigation pane.
In Windows 7, you can jump directly to any location by clicking its name 
in the navigation pane. You can expand and collapse folders there by 
double-clicking their names. You can also navigate by using the path that 
appears in the Address bar at the top of the Windows Explorer window. 
In Figure 4.10, the path appears like this:
Removable Disk (E:) ⇨ Personal ⇨ Financial
That’s simply an alternative way of writing the path. If you click in the 
Address bar, you see the traditional version of the path instead, like this:
E:\Personal\Financial
Step by Step
Examining the Folder Structure in Windows 7
Follow these steps to use the Windows Explorer tool to browse the contents of the volumes folders on your computer:
	 1.	Click Start and then click Computer. Windows Explorer opens, showing all the volumes that it recognizes on your 
computer. Some volumes may not appear, so this may not be an exact one-to-one match with the volumes you saw 
in Disk Management earlier in the chapter. In this example, you see an HDD, a DVD, and a USB flash drive.

Part II: Software
File Extensions and File Types
Each application has a specific format in which it saves the files you create 
in it. To help identify the file format, some operating systems (including 
Microsoft Windows) use file extensions. A file extension is a code follow-
ing the name of the file that indicates its type. Extensions are separated 
from the filename by a period, like this: Myfile.docx. In this example, 
docx is the extension, and it indicates the Microsoft Word format.
Almost all files have file extensions in Windows, not just data files. For 
example, the executable files that run applications also have extensions, 
as do the Windows system files and their helper files. Table 4.2 lists some 
of the most common file extensions and their applications.
file extension A code at the end of a filename 
that indicates the file’s type.

TIP
You might not see a file’s extension in Windows Explorer. By default, Windows 7 hides extensions for known 
file types. If you want to display them, from Windows Explorer, open the Tools menu and click Folder Options. 
Click the View tab, and then clear the Hide Extensions for Known File Types check box, and click OK.

Table 4.2 shows some common default application assignments, but 
the actual application assigned to a particular extension depends on the 
settings in your operating system. You can configure the OS to associate 
a file type with any of the applications you have installed on your com-
puter. When an extension is assigned to an application, and you double-
click a data file with that extension, the data file automatically opens in 
the associated application (provided, of course, that the application is 
capable of handling that file type).
Backups
Because storage media sometimes fail, it’s important to back up impor-
tant files frequently. Businesses spend thousands of dollars on robust, 
automated systems that back up their servers nightly, as well as key files 
on individual computers in some cases. Home and small-business users 
can use smaller backup systems designed for individual PCs.
Backup software can save your backup files to external media, such as 
a writeable DVD or an external hard drive, or to a network or Internet 
location. To save space on the backup media, backup software cre-
ates its own compressed archive files in its own proprietary format. To 
restore from the backup, you must use the same backup software that 
was employed to create the backup. A backup can span multiple discs or 
volumes, and can include multiple archive files. The collection of archive 
files created for a single backup instance is called a backup set.
Each time backup software runs, only a small portion of the files will 
have changed since the last backup was created. In order to reduce the 
amount of time the backup takes, not all storage is fully backed up every 
time. Instead, the backup software reads each file’s archive attribute 
(sometimes called an archive flag). When a file is backed up, its archive 
attribute is turned off. When the file changes, its archive attribute turns

automates the process of backing up files to 
external media.
backup set A set of backup files created during 
a single backup operation.
archive attribute A file attribute that indicates 
whether or not a file has changed since its last 
backup.

Part II: Software
on again. The operating system manages the archive attribute for each 
file automatically. The backup software can be configured to skip any files 
where the archive attribute is off, which omits any unchanged files from 
the backup set.
You can do a full backup or a partial one. A full backup backs up every 
file in the specified list, and clears each one’s archive attribute (that is, 
sets it to Off). There are two types of partial backups. A differential 
backup backs up only files that have changed since the last full backup. 
Backing up the files does not change their archive attributes, so that the 
next time you do a backup, they are still marked to be backed up again. 
If you need to restore the files, you would need the last full backup set 
and then the most recent differential backup set. This method saves on 
media because you only have to keep two backup sets, and you can reuse 
the same media each time you perform a differential backup. However, 
the differential backup set gets larger every time you run it because more 
files will have changed, and over time the differential backup set can get 
fairly large. Therefore, a full backup should be done periodically (for 
example, every week or two) to keep the size of the differential backup 
set small.
An incremental backup, on the other hand, turns off the archive attri-
bute for each file as it backs it up. Therefore, each time you run an incre-
mental backup, it backs up only the files that have changed since the last 
incremental backup. If you need to restore the files, you would need the 
last full backup set and every incremental backup set that has been done 
since then. The backup runs quickly each time because only the most 
recently changed files are backed up. However, the user has to maintain 
many backup sets to have a complete and current backup. Running a full 
backup creates another full set, and all the previous incremental backups 
can be discarded or overwritten.
Windows 7 comes with a backup utility called Backup and Restore. You 
can use it to back up your important files, and to schedule full, differ-
ential, or incremental backups to occur at regular intervals. You can also 
invest in third-party backup programs that have more features.
full backup A backup operation that backs up 
all files and sets their archive attribute to Off.
differential backup A backup operation that 
backs up all files that have the archive attribute 
set to On but does not change that attribute.
incremental backup A backup operation that 
backs up all files that have the archive attribute 
set to On and then sets the attribute to Off.
TIP
Users who have just a few important files to back up may prefer to manually copy them to an external drive 
periodically rather than using backup software, especially if the files do not frequently change. Another way to 
ensure your important files are always available is to store them in a cloud storage system such as Microsoft’s 
OneDrive (formerly known as SkyDrive) or Apple’s iCloud. Companies that offer cloud storage use RAID sys-
tems, as described in Chapter 3, to make sure data is constantly available, even if one or more drives fail.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
Summary
Understanding System Software
System software includes the BIOS, the operating system, and utility programs that perform 
system maintenance and protection.
A computer’s platform is its type of hardware. Only certain operating systems can run on certain 
platforms. The Intel platform, also called IBM-compatible, is the most popular platform; this 
platform’s most popular operating system is Windows.
There are many types of utility software for performing various system maintenance tasks. 
Antivirus, firewall, and anti-spyware programs protect from outside attacks and malicious 
software (malware). Anti-spam programs cut down on the amount of junk email you receive. A 
disk checking program can find and fix file system errors, and a registry cleanup program can 
find and fix inconsistent or unneeded entries in the registry. Backup software can automate the 
process of backing up important files.
Comparing the Major Operating Systems
Mac OS X is the operating system on most Apple desktop and notebook computers. Its latest 
version is OS X 10.9, code named Mavericks. Its main competitor is Microsoft Windows, which 
is the most popular operating system in the world, used on more than 90% of all desktop and 
notebook PCs.
Linux is an open-source operating system based on UNIX. The basic version is free, but you can 
purchase a packaged collection of add-ons and utility programs with it called a distribution (distro). 
A distro typically includes a GUI, as an alternative to Linux’s native command-line interface.
You can run multiple operating systems on a single computer by setting it up to multi-boot, or to 
use a virtual machine to run the secondary operating system within the first one.
A thin client operating system such as Chrome OS is designed for small portable notebook com-
puters that are used primarily for going online.
Tablets and smartphones have an operating system that is preinstalled on a chip (system-on-chip, 
or SoC). Users can download apps, which are add-on applications that extend the device’s capabili-
ties. The popular SoC operating systems are iOS, Android, Windows RT, and Windows Phone.
Understanding Digital Storage
A drive is a physical storage unit. It can be partitioned into one or more logical volumes. 
Formatting a volume places a file system on it, which it will use to store its files. NTFS is the 
most popular file system for modern versions of Windows; FAT32 is an older file system used in 
earlier versions of Windows. HFS+ is the Mac OS X file system, and ISO 9660 (CD File System, 
or CDFS) and Universal Disc Format (UDF) are used for optical discs.
The top level of a storage volume is its root directory. A file’s path is the complete descriptor of 
its location, including the volume and any folders you pass through to get to it. A folder tree is 
a graphic representation of a volume’s folder structure. A file extension is a code following the 
filename that indicates its type.
Backup software helps keep your data safe by backing it up to external media. The collection of 
files created for a single backup instance is a backup set. A backup can be full, differential, or 
incremental.

Linux Distros
Suppose you want to put Linux on an older desktop PC and give it to a relative who wants to 
use the Internet. But that person doesn’t know much about computers, so you must find a Linux 
distro that is very easy to use, even for a beginner. Do a web search on the terms Linux distro 
beginner. Based on the information you find, choose two Linux distros you think would meet your 
needs, and explain why you chose the ones you did.
Examining File Associations
Windows 7 has default extension associations for various file types. For example, when you double-
click on a file with a txt extension, Windows 7 opens it in Notepad because Notepad is the default 
application for the txt extension.
When you have more than one application that is capable of opening a certain type of file, you 
may want to change the Windows default setting for that extension. For example, if you have both 
Microsoft Word and WordPad, you might prefer one over the other for opening files with an rtf 
extension.

Chapter 4: Operating System Basics
You can work with file associations in either of two ways. You can browse a list of applications 
and see what extensions are associated with each one, or you can browse a list of extensions and 
see what applications are associated with each one. Open the Control Panel in Windows 7, click 
Programs, and click Default Programs. Then examine the settings and options available there. To 
browse by program, choose Set Your Default Programs. To browse by extension, choose Associate 
a File Type or Protocol with a Program.
Think It Over
Backup Scheduling
Suppose you were designing your own backup schedule for your computer. Which folders or 
files would you back up? Regarding the files you did not choose to back up, why did you exclude 
them? How often would you perform a full backup? How often would you perform a differential 
or incremental backup—and which would it be? Think about your answers, and give a reason for 
each one.

◽	 Be able to start up and shut down Windows
◽	 Know how to run programs
◽	 Perform common file management tasks
In Chapter 4, “Operating System Basics,” you learned about operating systems in 
general—what they do, how they work, how they differ from one another. In this 
chapter, you will turn your full attention toward one operating system in particu-
lar: Windows 7.
Windows 7 is a popular operating system, installed on millions of personal comput-
ers worldwide. This chapter starts with a tour of the Windows 7 desktop, so you 
can familiarize yourself with its paths. You’ll learn how to start up and shut down 
a Windows computer, and how to use special power-saving and security modes. 
You’ll see how to run programs in Windows 7. Finally, you’ll learn how to manage 
files using Windows Explorer, and perform common operations like copying, mov-
ing, renaming, and deleting files.

Careers in IT
Health IT Specialist
In many countries, governments have recently enacted 
laws that require health-care providers to computerize 
­certain parts of their practices. For example, patient 
health records, medical billing, supply and drug invento-
ries, and medical equipment maintenance records will 
soon need to be in electronic form if they are not already. 
This requirement opens up many job opportunities for 
health IT specialists. A health IT specialist plans and sets 
up health-care recordkeeping systems that meet all gov-
ernment requirements and keeps such systems up to date 
and in good repair. This job requires at least an associ-
ate’s degree in a computer-related field, with a bachelor’s 
or master’s degree preferred for supervisory positions.

A Tour of Windows 7
The Windows 7 interface, called the desktop, is your starting point for 
most of the activities you perform in Windows 7. From the desktop, you 
can run programs, manage files, access the Internet, check the status of 
devices, and more.
Your Windows desktop is like a physical workspace in some ways. You 
can have multiple files and projects open at the same time, spread out 
on the desktop so you can see each one of them. The desktop can be 
changed to suit your personal style. The desktop background can be a 
solid color, as in Figure 5.1, or it can be a picture of your choice.
The taskbar is the thin bar across the bottom of the screen. It is used to 
start programs and manage the programs that are already running. At 
the far-left end is the Start button. The small graphics you see on the 
desktop are called icons. An icon can sit on the desktop, as the Recycle 
Bin icon does in Figure 5.1, or it can be pinned to the taskbar for easy 
access. For example, in Figure 5.1, four pinned icons appear to the right 
of the Start button. The center of the taskbar is blank in Figure 5.1, 
but if any programs were running or windows open, buttons for those 
programs or windows would appear there. Some other icons are at the 
right end of the taskbar, but these aren’t pinned there. That area is called 
the notification area (or system tray), and the icons there represent 
information from programs or system components that are running in 
the background, such as the Volume Control and the Battery Meter. At 
the far-right end of the taskbar is a clock.

Figure 5.1  The Windows 7 desktop.
When you click the Start button, the Start menu opens, as shown in 
Figure 5.2. It has two columns. In the left column, the top section contains 
pinned shortcuts to applications. By default, there might not be any pinned 
shortcuts here; Figure 5.2 shows pinned shortcuts for Internet Explorer 
and Outlook. The bottom section of the left column contains shortcuts 
to recently or frequently used applications. This list changes depending on 
your usage. Below that is the All Programs command. It opens a hierar-
chical menu of all the installed programs on your system; you’ll learn more 
about it in the section “Running Applications” later in this chapter. At the 
bottom of the left column is a Search box; you can type in this box to nar-
row down what appears on the Start menu to find what you are looking for.
In the right column are links to commonly accessed locations and set-

NOTE
Windows 7 boots directly to the desktop without prompting for a user account or password if ALL the follow-
ing conditions are true: 1) There is only one user account set up on this PC (excluding the built-in Guest and 
Administrator accounts); 2) that user account has no password; and 3) the Guest account is disabled.

Starting Up and Shutting Down
When you turn on the computer’s power, Windows 7 loads automati-
cally. Depending on the way your copy of Windows is configured, the 
desktop might appear automatically, or you might see a login screen.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
At the login screen, if your username appears with a password box under 
it, type the password and press Enter to log in. If several different user-
names appear, click your account to select it. The options available at 
the login screen may vary depending on the edition of Windows 7 you 
have, and depending on whether the PC you are using is connected to a 
domain-based network.
Shutting Down or Restarting the PC
When you shut down the PC, Windows shuts down and the computer 
stops using power. The next time you start the computer, Windows must 
reload itself into memory, which takes a minute or two. You should shut 
down a computer completely before moving it, storing it, or servicing 
it. You should also shut down the computer when prompted to do so by 
Windows itself. (A complete shutdown and restart is sometimes required 
to complete the installation of certain updates.) When you shut down the 
computer and then turn it back on again later, that’s called a cold boot 
because the computer’s circuitry has been off (and is therefore cold).
When you restart the PC, 
Windows shuts down, but the 
computer’s power remains on, 
and Windows immediately 
restarts. Restarting is also called 
a warm boot because the 
computer stays on (warm) as 
it reboots. You should restart 
when Windows prompts you 
to do so (for example, after 
updates have been installed), 
and also as a troubleshooting 
technique if you begin to expe-
rience problems with Windows. 
To restart Windows, choose 
Restart from the Shut Down button’s menu, as shown in Figure 5.3.
cold boot To start up a computer from a power-
off state.
warm boot To restart a computer that is already 
powered on.

Restarting Helps!
If you talk to any computer professional about a problem you are having with your computer, the first thing he or 
she will probably ask you is: Have you tried restarting? That’s because restarting Windows can cure a variety of 
one-time or occasional problems that may occur. For example, suppose your mouse pointer starts jumping around 
wildly as you move the mouse. That’s a problem with the display adapter, and it can almost always be cured by 
restarting the PC. Another common problem that restarting usually fixes is a keyboard that suddenly starts send-
ing the wrong characters to the PC as you type.
Troubleshooting
Besides shutting down, there are several other ways to make the com-
puter use less (or no) power. You will learn about them in the section 
“Placing the PC in a Low-Power Mode,” later in this chapter.

Step by Step
Shutting Down a Windows 7 Computer
Follow these steps to shut down the computer completely and turn 
its power off:
	 1.	Click Start, and then click the Shut Down button.
	 2.	If any programs have unsaved files, a prompt appears for them. 
Respond to the prompt as needed.
Restarting a Windows 7 Computer
Follow these steps to restart the computer:
	 1.	Click Start, and then click the arrow to the right of the Shut 
Down button. A menu appears, as shown in Figure 5.3.
	 2.	Click Restart.
	 3.	If any programs have unsaved files, a prompt appears for them. 
Respond to the prompt as needed.
Placing the PC in a Low-Power Mode
Windows supports two special modes that you can place the computer 
in as an alternative to shutting down completely. In each of these modes, 
when the computer resumes operation, the desktop is just as you left it, 
including any open programs, windows, and files. This saves you time 
because you don’t have to wait as long for Windows to start up as you 
normally would, and when it does start up, you don’t have to reopen the 
applications and windows you want to continue working with.
Sleep mode is a low-power state. It keeps the RAM powered, but shuts 
down all other components. RAM doesn’t use much memory, so the 
computer consumes very little power. On a desktop computer, that means 
it uses less electricity. On a battery-powered computer, that means the 
battery lasts much longer. Waking up from Sleep mode is very quick—
only a few seconds. Hibernate mode is a no-power-needed state. It 
copies the contents of RAM to a reserved area on the hard drive, and 
then shuts the power down completely. When the computer starts back 
up again, instead of booting normally, it reads the stored data back into 
memory, so you can pick up where you left off. Hibernate mode takes 
more time to wake up from than Sleep mode does (about 30 seconds, on 
the average), but that’s less time than it would take to start the computer 
from being completely shut down.
Sleep mode A power-saving mode that keeps 
RAM powered but turns off everything else to save 
power.
Hibernate mode A power-saving mode that 
saves the contents of RAM to the hard drive and 
then shuts down all power. When the computer 
wakes up, it reads the saved data back into 
RAM so the computer does not have to restart 
completely.

115
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
To place the computer in one of these modes, select it from the Shut 
Down button’s menu on the Start menu, as shown in Figure 5.3. 
Closing the lid on a notebook computer usually puts the system into 
Sleep mode automatically; you may see the power light flashing intermit-
tently as an indication the computer is sleeping.
To wake up from Sleep mode, press any key on the keyboard. To wake 
up from Hibernate mode, press the computer’s Power button.
CAUTION
Not all computer hardware supports Hibernate mode. If you experience problems with the computer enter-
ing Hibernate mode, search online for troubleshooting help for your specific computer; there may be a BIOS 
(Basic Input Output System) update or driver update that can resolve the problem.
Stuck?
If your computer appears completely dead when you try to wake it up from Sleep or Hibernate mode, try hold-
ing down the computer’s Power button for 10 seconds. Doing so will shut the PC down completely, resetting any 
special power mode it was previously in. You may see an error message when you restart the computer about 
Windows not shutting down correctly and offering to start Windows in a special mode. Don’t use a special mode; 
choose Start Windows Normally.
Troubleshooting
Logging Off and Switching Users
Windows 7 supports multiple user accounts. When one user is finished, 
he or she can log off, which shuts down any running programs, closes 
any open data files, unloads all personal settings for that user, and returns 
to the login screen, with all the available users listed. From that point 
another user can log in. Logging off closes the user’s personal activities 
down, but it does not completely restart Windows. Therefore, it takes 
less time than a full restart.
If another user wants to use the computer for a short time, the first user 
may not want to take the time to shut down all applications and data 
files that he or she is working on. The Switch User command suspends 
the current user’s session but does not end it, and returns to the login 
screen. Another user can then log in. The users can switch back and forth 
freely between the open accounts, and other users can even log in, too.
To use the Log Off or Switch User command, choose it from the Shut 
Down button’s menu, as shown in Figure 5.3.
log off To close a user account’s session, closing 
all open programs and data files and unloading all 
of that user’s personal settings.
Switch User A Windows feature that enables 
another user to log in without the original user 
logging off first.
TIP
Why not just let another person sit down and use the computer for a few minutes, without switching? That’s 
fine to do, as long as the first user doesn’t mind the lack of privacy. Each logged-in user has his or her own 
separate personal files and settings, and anyone who uses the computer while you are logged in can see 
your files. Switching users also enables each user to have his or her own preferred settings, such as display 
resolution and color scheme.

Locking the PC
If you are going to be away from your computer for a while, you might 
not want other people to be able to see what you were working on or 
snoop on your computer while you are gone. To prevent such intrusion, 
you can use the Lock command. Locking preserves the current state 
of the computer but redisplays the login screen. You must retype your 
password when you return to the computer to continue your session. 
Locking is similar to switching users except the login screen that appears 
shows the prompt only for the user who locked the PC, and not the full 
list of users that you see when you use Switch User.
To lock the PC, choose the Lock command from the Shut Down but-
ton’s menu, as shown in Figure 5.3. Alternatively, the PC can be locked 
by pressing the Windows key on the bottom left of the keyboard and the 
L key simultaneously.

Running Applications
As you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” programs that per-
form some useful task (other than keeping the computer itself running) 
are known as applications. Running applications is the main reason 
Windows exists. Windows comes with a variety of small applications that 
it calls Accessories; these include a calculator, a text editor, a simple word 
processor, and a drawing program. You can also buy and install other 
applications on your own, and some computers come with some third-
party applications already installed, such as a DVD movie player or a 
productivity suite such as Microsoft Office.
Starting an Application
As you saw earlier in the chapter, the Start menu has a few shortcuts on 
it. The top section contains pinned shortcuts, and below that are short-
cuts to recently or frequently used applications. If the application you 
want to run isn’t in either of those places, you must click All Programs to 
open the full menu system. This menu system contains both application 
shortcuts and folders. If you click a folder, you see the shortcuts within 
it. The Start menu is hierarchically organized, just like the file system you 
learned about in Chapter 4. There are subfolders within folders, and files 
can exist at any level of the organizational structure. Figure 5.4 shows 
the Accessories folder expanded to show its subfolders, and the System 
Tools subfolder expanded below that, for example. Yours will look differ-
ent because you have different applications installed than the PC illus-
trated here.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Figure 5.4  The All Programs menu with the Accessories folder expanded.
Because the Start menu can get complicated with so many folders and 
shortcuts, you may find it easier to search for the application you want to 
run rather than browsing for it. To search for an app, after opening the 
Start menu, start typing the application’s name. The menu shows only 
the items that match what you typed. It is a full-featured search, and it 
finds all files on your hard drive, not just the applications on the Start 
menu. However, the Start menu applications appear at the top of the list, 
for easy access. In Figure 5.5, I typed quick, for example.
You can also start applications from shortcuts on the desktop or that are 
pinned to the taskbar or to the top of the Start menu. Just click the item 
you want on the Start menu or taskbar, or double-click the desired icon 
on the desktop.

Put It to Work
Pinning Shortcuts
An easy way to re-find an application on the Start menu is to pin it, either to the Start menu or to the taskbar. If 
you pin it to the Start menu, it appears in the upper-left quadrant of the Start menu. If you pin it to the taskbar, it 
appears to the right of the Start button. After locating the desired item on the Start menu, but before clicking it to 
select it, right-click it. On the menu that appears, choose Pin to Start Menu or Pin to Taskbar.
To place a shortcut on the desktop, minimize all open windows. Open the Start menu, locate the icon you want, 
and then hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the application off the Start menu; a copy will be created on the desk-
top. Make sure you hold down Ctrl as you drag; otherwise, the shortcut will be removed from the Start menu.

Step by Step
Starting an Application
Follow these steps to start an application:
	 1.	Click Start.
	 2.	If you see a shortcut for the application you want, click it. Otherwise, do one of the following:
◾	 Click All Programs and then click the application you want. Click a folder to open it if needed.
◾	 Start typing the application name and then click the name when it appears at the top of the Start menu.
Manipulating a Window
As the name implies, Microsoft Windows is based on windows— 
movable rectangular blocks in which different types of content appear. 
When you run an application, it appears in its own window, and when 
you browse a file listing, that listing appears in its own window too. 
Figure 5.6 illustrates some basic parts of a window.
Figure 5.6  Each window has these features in common.
The title bar is the bar across the top of the window. If the window 
holds an application, it shows the application’s name. If the application 
has a file open, it also shows the file’s name. You can move a window 
around onscreen by dragging its title bar.
The buttons at the far-right end of the title bar control the window’s size.
◾	
 Minimize: Hides the window by shrinking it down to a but-
ton on the taskbar. Use this button to get a window out of the way 
temporarily without closing it.
◾	
 Maximize: Enlarges the window to fill the entire screen. 
When a window is already maximized, this button changes to a 
Restore button, which returns the window to the size it was before 
you maximized it.
◾ 	
 Close: Closes the window, exiting the application that was 
open in it (if applicable).

Navigating in an Application
Most Windows-based applications have one of two interfaces: a menu 
interface or a Ribbon interface. A menu interface is typical of older 
applications and applications not developed by Microsoft; the Ribbon 
interface is common in newer Microsoft applications.
A menu-based interface has a menu bar across the top of the screen, 
immediately below the title bar. You can click a menu name to open the 
menu, as shown in Figure 5.7. Notice in Figure 5.7 that some com-
mands have keyboard shortcuts listed next to them. You can press those 
keys instead of using the menu system if you prefer.
menu bar A horizontal bar near the top of a 
window containing the names of menus that can 
be opened by clicking on the names.
keyboard shortcut A key combination that, 
when pressed, issues a command, as an alterna-
tive to selecting the command in another way.
TIP
If a program does not appear to have a menu bar, try pressing the Alt key. A menu bar may appear. 
Notice also that some commands have ellipses after them (. . .). These 
commands open dialog boxes, which are windows that prompt you for 
additional information. For example, if you click the Print command, the 
Print dialog box opens, prompting you to enter print settings, as shown 
in Figure 5.8.
dialog box A window that appears in response 
to selecting a command, prompting for more infor-
mation about how the user wants the command to 
be executed.

Figure 5.7  Menu-based application windows have these features.
Figure 5.8  Some menu commands open dialog boxes.
Dialog boxes have various ways of asking you for information. For 
example, the dialog box in Figure 5.8 has the following features:
◾	 Scrollable list: The list of printers at the top of the dialog box has 
a scroll bar beneath it. You can drag the scroll box from side to side 
to scroll the listing, or click the arrow at one end of the scroll bar 
to scroll in that direction.
◾	 Check box: A check box toggles a feature on or off. Click it to 
change its state.

Part II: Software
◾	 Text box: A text box enables you to enter text or a number directly 
into it.
◾	 Increment buttons: Text boxes that only accept numeric values 
sometimes have increment buttons, which appear as small up and 
down arrows. You can click an arrow to increment (increase) or 
decrement (decrease) the number shown in the text box as an alter-
native to manually typing a number.
◾	 Option buttons: Option buttons present a group of mutually 
exclusive values. When one option button in a group is selected, 
the previous selection is cleared.
◾	 Command buttons: Command buttons are large rectangular 
buttons with text labels on them. Clicking a command button 
performs an action, such as the Print, Cancel, or Apply buttons in 
Figure 5.8, or opens another dialog box, as with the Preferences 
and Find Printer buttons.
Some menu-based applications contain one or more toolbars, which 
are groups of graphical buttons that serve as shortcuts for issuing cer-
tain commands. In most cases, you can point at a button on a toolbar 
to see a pop-up ScreenTip that tells the button’s name or purpose, as in 
Figure 5.9.
Figure 5.9  Some menu-based applications contain toolbars.
Ribbon-based applications do not have a menu bar or toolbar. 
Instead, they have a tabbed Ribbon, which is somewhat like a 
large multi-page toolbar. Each tab represents a different page of 
tools. Click a tab to access the buttons and other tools on that tab. 
Figure 5.10 shows an app called WordPad. It has two ordinary tabs, 
Home and View, containing commands you can select. It also con-
tains a File tab, which is the blue tab to the left of the other two. The 
File tab opens a File menu, which contains commands for saving, 
opening, closing, and printing files. Microsoft Office programs use 
this same type of interface, so you will become very familiar with it in 
upcoming chapters.
toolbar A group of graphical buttons representing 
commands.
Ribbon The main toolbar in Office applications 
and some other Windows applications, consisting 
of multiple tabbed pages of commands.

TIP
In most Ribbon-based applications, there is also a small toolbar above the tabs called the Quick Access 
toolbar. You can add a copy of any button to this toolbar to keep it handy. To add a button to it, right-click the 
button on the Ribbon and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.
In most applications, both menu-based and Ribbon-based, you can 
right-click to open a shortcut menu (also called a context menu) and 
select commands from there. The shortcut menu’s content changes 
depending on what you right-click and what you are doing. For example, 
if you right-click some text that you’ve selected, the shortcut menu con-
tains commands to cut and copy it, as shown in Figure 5.11.

Put It to Work
Using Internet Explorer
This book devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 10, “Web Basics”) to using Internet Explorer (IE), but you will prob-
ably need to use the web before you get to that chapter to complete some of your assignments, so here is a very 
quick overview.
Windows 7 has a shortcut to Internet Explorer pinned to the taskbar, so you can start IE from there if you like, or 
you can click the Start button and click Internet Explorer at the top of the Start menu.
The page that appears initially depends on what page has been set as the default (referred to as the Home page). If you 
are accessing IE from your school or workplace, a page may have been assigned for you specific to that organization.
To go directly to a specific address (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL), type it in the address bar. You can also 
use the address bar to perform searches. Instead of entering a specific address in the address bar, type some keywords 
there, or even a whole sentence. Your default search engine will return a list of pages that meet your search criteria.
Use the Back button to return to a previous page. To go back several steps at once, hold the mouse button down 
on the Back button to open a menu of previously viewed pages.
To open a link in a new tab, right-click the link and choose Open in New Tab. You can then switch back and forth 
freely between the open pages by clicking their tabs. You can also start a new tab without specifying a page to 
show on it by clicking the New Tab button to the right of the rightmost displayed tab.
address bar The field above the menu bar in 
Windows Explorer that shows the current path.
Managing Files
As you learned in Chapter 4, a computer’s file system consists of physical 
drives that contain volumes that have letters (with colons) assigned to 
them, like C: and D:. Each volume can contain folders, and each folder

zation (its root directory).

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
In Windows 7, Windows Explorer is the tool for managing files. 
“Managing” is a pretty broad term, encompassing all the various opera-
tions you might perform on a file, including moving, copying, renaming, 
deleting, and viewing its properties. The rest of this chapter is devoted to 
teaching you those skills.
Understanding the Windows 
Explorer Interface
In many ways, Windows Explorer resembles any other window. It has 
a title bar, a menu bar, and window controls, all of which you learned 
about earlier in this chapter. It also has some extra features, though, that 
not every window has, shown in Figure 5.12.
Figure 5.12  Windows Explorer has some tools and features that most application windows 
don’t have.
◾	 Navigation bar: The pane on the left side of the Windows Explorer 
window contains links for displaying various locations, both on your 
local computer and on any networks you may be connected to.
◾	 Command bar: This extra bar below the menu bar contains an 
Organize button that opens a menu, and also other commands too, 
which change depending on what location you are viewing. On the 
far-right end of the command bar are the Change Your View but-
ton (which opens a menu of available views), a Preview Pane button 
(which toggles a preview pane on and off), and a Get Help but-
ton (which opens the Help system).

◾	 Address bar: The address bar, which appears above the menu bar, 
shows the current path. You learned about paths in Chapter 4, in 
the section “How Files Are Organized in Folders.”
◾	 Status bar: This bar appears at the bottom of the window and 
reports information about the currently displayed or selected loca-
tion or objects.
◾	 Search box: To find a particular file or folder in Windows 
Explorer, you can type a part of its name in the Search box and 
press Enter. The Search feature looks in files, folders, and objects 
in your Outlook data file (if you have one) and looks both at the 
filenames and their contents.
Navigating to Different Locations
When you open Windows Explorer, the location shown depends on 
how you opened it. For example, the Start menu has several links on it 
that all open different locations (Computer, Documents, Pictures, and 
Music). In addition, the Windows Explorer shortcut on the taskbar 
opens Windows Explorer to the Libraries window. (You will learn about 
libraries later in this chapter.) You can easily navigate to any location in 
Windows Explorer, so it doesn’t matter from which location you start.
One way to navigate to a different location is to click one of the links in 
the navigation pane (the left pane). The navigation pane contains these 
expandable sections, as shown in Figure 5.13:
◾	 Favorites: Contains shortcuts for a few common locations, such as 
the desktop and Recent Places. You can also add your own location 
shortcuts here, for easy access to the locations you use the most.
◾	 Libraries: Contains shortcuts for the Documents, Music, Pictures, 
and Videos libraries for the logged-in user account. (They are sepa-
rate for each user account.)
◾	 Homegroup: If your computer is part of a homegroup, a link to 
it appears. A homegroup is a type of networking used in home and 
small-business workgroup environments. You learn more about 
networking in Chapter 8, “Networking and Internet Basics.”
◾	 Computer: Contains a list of all the local volumes in an expandable 
folder tree.
◾	 Network: Contains shortcuts for browsing a network if you are 
connected to one.
To expand a section, double-click its name, or point to it (so that a white 
triangle appears to its left) and then click the triangle to expand it. When 
a section is expanded in the folder tree, the triangle next to it appears 
black; click the black triangle to collapse the section again.
homegroup A small group of mutually trusted 
computers on a peer-to-peer network such as in a 
home or small office.

127
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
You can also navigate by double-clicking a folder in the main pane. For 
example, you could start out by clicking Computer in the navigation 
pane to display a list of volumes, and then double-click the C: volume, 
and then double-clicking a folder in the listing that appears, and keep 
double-clicking folders until you arrive at the file you are seeking.
If you want to go back one step in your navigation, click the Back button 
in the upper-left corner. The Forward button next to it takes you one 
step forward again after you have used Back.
If you want to go up one or more levels in the hierarchy, you can expand 
the folder tree in the navigation pane and click the folder location to 
jump to, or you can click the folder name in the address bar. You can also 
click any of the triangles between the folder names in the address bar to 
open a menu of locations at that same level and then click any location 
from the menu to jump to it.

Part II: Software
Changing the View of a Location
You can view the current location in the main pane in a number of dif-
ferent ways. Click the Change Your View button to toggle through the 
available views, or click the down arrow to the right of that button to 
open a menu of views and then click the one you want, or drag the slider 
up or down to a different view. See Figure 5.14.
Figure 5.14  Open the Change Your View button’s menu to select a view.
TIP
The menu has a slider because you aren’t limited to just the presets on the menu; you can position the slider 
halfway between two settings for additional choices. For example, if you position the slider between Large and 
Extra-Large, you get icons that are halfway between those two options in size.
Understanding Libraries
A library is not a folder, although it looks like one. It is a virtual folder 
created by combining the contents of several different folders in one 
pane. The Libraries feature enables you to work with the contents of 
many different locations at once, without worrying about where a par-
ticular file is actually stored.
Windows 7 comes with four libraries already set up for you: Documents, 
Music, Pictures, and Videos. Your libraries are unique to your user 
account; if someone else logs into the same PC, he will see his own 
libraries instead of yours. This provides for some privacy when multiple 
people share a computer. You can also create other libraries if you like.
library A virtual folder that combines the 
contents of one or more specified folders into a 
single view.
virtual folder A view that resembles a folder 
but has no direct equivalent in the computer’s file 
system.
NOTE
Although the default library names reflect the types of files that Windows suggests you store in them, libraries 
are not limited to certain file types. You can store any files in any libraries.
Each library monitors the contents of one or more locations. For 
example, the Documents library monitors two folders by default: the 
logged-in user’s personal Documents folder (C:\Users\username\My 
Documents) and a Public Documents folder (C:\Users\Public\Public 
Documents). You can set it to monitor other locations as well.

129
Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
When you save a file to your Documents library, where is that file actually 
saved, if the library represents multiple locations? That depends on which 
folder is set up to be the save location. In the Documents library, for 
example, the default save location is C:\Users\username\My Documents.
save location The location where files are saved 
when a user saves them to a library.
Step by Step
Setting a Library to Monitor Additional Folders
Follow these steps to add another folder to a library’s Locations list: 
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click the 
desired library and choose Properties. The Properties dialog 
box opens for that library.
	 2.	Click Include a Folder.
	 3.	Navigate to the desired folder, select it, and then click the 
Include button.
	 4.	Click OK.
Changing the Save Location for a Library
Follow these steps to change which folder a library stores files in 
when you save to that library:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click the 
desired library and choose Properties. The Properties dialog 
box opens for that library.
	 2.	In the Library Locations list, click the folder you want to use as 
the save location.
	 3.	Click Set Save Location.
	 4.	Click OK.
Creating a New Library
Follow these steps to create a new library:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click 
Libraries, and on the menu that appears, point to New 
and then click Library.
	 2.	In Windows Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click

Part II: Software
Selecting Files and Folders
Before you can issue a command that affects a file or folder (for example, 
to move or copy it), you must first select that file or folder. If you are 
selecting only one file or folder, it’s easy—just click it. It becomes high-
lighted. (The highlighting color varies depending on the color scheme 
you are using in Windows.) If, however, you want to act upon mul-
tiple files or folders at once, you must select them all before issuing the 
command.
When two or more files or folders are contiguous (adjacent) in the file 
listing, you can select them by clicking the first one and then holding 
down the Shift key while you click the last one. All the files between the 
two are also selected. When the files you want are non-contiguous (not 
adjacent), hold down the Ctrl key and then click individually on each 
one. See Figure 5.15. When you are finished making your selections, 
release the Ctrl key. To cancel a selection, click anywhere away from the 
selection.
contiguous Physically adjacent to one another.
non-contiguous Not adjacent.
TIP
To select all the files and folders in the current location, press Ctrl+A.
Figure 5.15  Contiguous versus non-contiguous file selection.
Creating New Folders
As you work in Windows, you may want to create new folders to orga-
nize your data. For example, you might create a separate folder for each 
project you work on. You could create them in your My Documents 
folder, so that they show up in your Documents library, or in another 
other location on any volume to which you have access.
To create a new folder, click the New Folder button on the command 
bar in Windows Explorer. A new folder appears with a generic name, 
with the name highlighted so you can easily change it. See Figure 5.16. 
Type the new name and press Enter.
command bar The bar below the menu bar 
in Windows Explorer that contains an Organize 
button that opens a menu, and also other com-
mands, which change depending on what location 
you are viewing.

TIP
An alternative way of creating a folder is to right-click a blank area of the file listing, point to New, and click 
Folder. Yet another way is to open the File menu, point to New, and click Folder.
Renaming and Deleting Files and Folders
There are many different ways to rename a file or folder. You can do any 
of the following:
◾	 Select the file or folder and press F2 to make the name editable. 
Type the new name and press Enter.
◾	 Click the file or folder to select it and then click it again to move 
the insertion point into the name. Edit the name and press Enter.
◾	 Right-click the file or folder and click Rename. Edit the name and 
press Enter.
◾	 Select the file or folder and then open the File menu and choose 
Rename. Edit the name and press Enter.
To delete a file or folder, select it and then do any of the following:
◾	 Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
◾	 Right-click the file and folder and click Delete.
◾	 Open the File menu and click Delete.

Part II: Software
CAUTION
You can rename any file or folder. That does not mean, however, that you should. Many folders and files are 
part of installed applications or Windows itself, and if you rename them, they may no longer function as 
intended. To be safe, rename only files and folders that you have created.
Deleting a file sends it to the Recycle Bin, which is a temporary holding 
area for deleted content. You can retrieve a deleted file or folder from the 
Recycle Bin.
Step by Step
Restoring a Deleted Item from the Recycle Bin
Follow these steps to retrieve a file or folder that you have deleted: 
	 1.	Double-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop to open the Recycle Bin window.
	 2.	Select the deleted item to 
restore.
	 3.	Click the Restore This Item but-
ton on the command bar.
Moving and Copying Files and Folders
You can move and copy files and folders from and to any location. This 
enables you to transfer your data files from your hard drive to a remov-
able drive such as a USB flash drive, for example.
CAUTION
The same warning applies to moving files as to deleting them: If you move a file that an application or 
Windows relies on, Windows or an application may not function as expected anymore.
There are many ways to move and copy items. You can use the Windows 
Clipboard, or drag and drop files from one location to another, or you can 
use the Move to Folder or Copy to Folder command in Windows Explorer.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
The Windows Clipboard is a temporary storage area in memory. When 
you use the Cut operation on an object (or group of objects), it is 
removed from its current location and placed on the Clipboard. Or, 
when you use the Copy operation on an object, the object remains in the 
current location but a copy of it is placed on the Clipboard. Then when 
you use the Paste operation, it is copied from the Clipboard to a new 
location. The object remains on the Clipboard until something else is 
placed there with either another Cut or another Copy operation. In this 
chapter, you use the Clipboard to copy and move files, but it can also be 
used to move or copy snippets of data from applications into other appli-
cations. For example, you can use it to copy certain cells from an Excel 
spreadsheet into a Microsoft Word document or into an email message 
you are composing.
Table 5.2 lists the various ways of activating the Cut, Copy, and Paste 
commands in Windows 7.

Drag-and-drop is a technique for moving items from place to place. 
You can open the source and the destination locations in separate File 
Explorer windows onscreen, and then drag items between them. When 
you drag between two locations on the same volume, the drag operation 
moves by default; if you want it to copy, hold down the Ctrl key as you 
drag. When you drag between two locations on different volumes, the 
drag operation copies by default; if you want it to move, hold down Shift 
as you drag.
Clipboard A reserved area in memory for tempo-
rarily holding content that has been cut or copied 
from an application or from Windows Explorer.
TIP
If you are not sure whether the two locations are on the same volume, you can be sure you get the operation 
you want (move or copy) by always holding down Shift as you drag for a move and always holding down Ctrl as 
you drag for a copy. Alternatively, you can right-drag instead of dragging with the left mouse button. When you 
do so, a menu appears when you release the mouse button, enabling you to select a move or copy operation.
The Move to Folder and Copy to Folder commands (both on the Edit 
menu) are unique to Windows Explorer, and provide an alternative to 
the other two methods just described. They enable you to move or copy 
using a dialog box interface.
If you want to move items to a removable drive such as a USB flash 
drive, there is yet another method available. Right-click the selected 
item(s) and select Send To from the context menu that is displayed, and 
then click the removable drive from the menu that appears.

Moving or Copying (Clipboard Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using the Windows Clipboard: 
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be moved or copied.
	 2.	Press Ctrl+C to copy, or press Ctrl+X if you want to move. Or use one of the other methods from Table 5.2.
	 3.	Navigate to the location where you want to paste the cut or copied item(s).
	 4.	Press Ctrl+V to paste. Or use one of the other methods from Table 5.2.
Moving or Copying (Drag-and-Drop Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using drag-and-drop:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be moved or copied.
	 2.	Open another Windows Explorer window (for example, click Start and click Computer) and navigate to the destina-
tion location.
	 3.	Arrange the two windows so that both are visible at once.
	 4.	Hold down Ctrl to copy, or hold down Shift to move. (See the note earlier in this section about the need to use those 
keys.)
	 5.	Drag the selected item(s) from the original location to the destination.
Moving or Copying (Dialog Box Method)
Follow these steps to move or copy selected files or folders using the 
Move to Folder or Copy to Folder command:
	 1.	In Windows Explorer, select the file(s) and/or folder(s) to be 
moved or copied.
	 2.	Open the Edit menu and click Move to Folder or Copy to Folder. 
The Move Items or Copy Items dialog box opens.
	 3.	Navigate to the desired destination location. Use the same 
navigation techniques you use in the folder tree in the naviga-
tion pane.
	 4.	Click the Move (or Copy) button.
Working with Shortcuts
A shortcut is a link, or pointer, to the original file to which it refers. 
It allows a file or folder to appear to be in two or more locations at 
once, while maintaining a single original copy of it. For example, all the 
program names on the Start menu are shortcuts to the executable files 
that run those programs, as are the shortcut icons on the left end of the 
taskbar. You can also place shortcuts directly on the desktop.
Some shortcuts appear with a small arrow in the lower-left corner of the 
icon, indicating that the icon represents a shortcut rather than the original 
file, and some of them have the word “shortcut” in their name, as shown 
shortcut A pointer to a file or folder.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
in Figure 5.17. However, not all shortcuts follow these conventions, so 
it is not a sure way to differentiate a shortcut from a regular file. A better 
method is to right-click the icon and choose Properties. If the dialog box 
that appears contains a Shortcut tab, the icon is a shortcut icon.
Figure 5.17  An original  
file (left) and a shortcut that  
refers to it (right).
To create a shortcut, right-drag the original file to another location. 
When you release the mouse button, a menu appears. On that menu, 
click Create Shortcuts Here. This works to create a shortcut almost any-
where. For example, you can drag an item from the Start menu or from a 
Windows Explorer screen to the desktop or to the taskbar.
You can work with shortcuts just like any other files. You can rename 
them, for example, in the same way you learned to rename files earlier 
in this chapter. You can move them and copy them freely. To delete a 
shortcut, delete it as you would any other file. Deleting a shortcut does 
not delete the file to which it refers.

Summary
A Tour of Windows 7
The desktop is the heart of the Windows 7 interface. The key features of the desktop include the 
taskbar and icons. On the taskbar is the Start button, pinned icons, buttons for running applica-
tion windows, the notification area, and the clock, from left to right.
When you click the Start button, the Start menu appears, with links to commonly or recently 
used programs and locations appear. Click All Programs to see the full list of programs you can 
run, or type the first few letters of what you seek into the Search box.
Starting Up and Shutting Down
Windows starts up automatically when you turn on the computer. You are prompted to log in with 
your user ID and to type a password if your account has one assigned to it. A cold boot is one 
where the computer has been off; a warm boot is a restart with the computer already on.
Sleep mode is a power-saving mode that keeps RAM powered but turns off everything else. 
Hibernate mode saves the contents of RAM to the hard drive and then shuts down all power.
When a user is finished with the computer, he or she can log off, which shuts down any running 
programs, closes open data files, and unloads that user’s personal settings. To allow someone else 
to log in without the first user logging out, use Switch User. To return to a login screen without 
closing out of programs and applications, use the Lock command.
Running Applications
To start an application, choose it from the Start menu. If you don’t see it on the top level menu, 
click All Programs to find it, or type its name in the Search box.
A window is a movable rectangular block in which content appears, such as an application or file 
listing. Each window has a title bar at the top of it. In the right corner of the title bar are window 
control buttons: Minimize, Maximize (or Restore), and Close. To resize a window, drag one of 
its borders. To move a window, drag its title bar.
To navigate within an application, use its menu bar. Some commands have keyboard shortcuts 
for speeding up your work. Some commands open dialog boxes for providing more information. 
Programs with a menu bar sometimes have a toolbar, which is a row of clickable icons. A Ribbon 
is a multi-page, more sophisticated version of a toolbar.
To exit an application, click the window’s Close button, or open the File menu and choose Exit, 
or press Alt+F4.
Managing Files
The parts of a Windows Explorer window include the navigation bar, command bar, address 
bar, status bar, and Search box.
You can navigate to different locations using the shortcuts in the navigation pane in the Favorites 
list, or select one of the libraries from the Libraries list. If you are connected to a network, you 
can browse network locations from the Homegroup or Network lists. Use the Computer list to 
browse local volumes. To change the view of a location, click the Change Your View button, or 
click the down arrow to the right of that button to open a menu of views and then click the one 
you want.

Chapter 5: Introduction to Windows 7
Libraries are virtual folders that combine the contents of several locations into one window. 
The default libraries are Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos for each user. You can create 
your own libraries too, and set up libraries to monitor additional folders. Each library has a Save 
Location, which is the folder that files are placed in when saved to the library.
To select contiguous files and folders, hold down Shift as you click the first and last ones. To 
select non-contiguous files and folders, hold down Ctrl as you click each one individually. To cre-
ate a new folder, click the New Folder button on the command bar.
To rename a file or folder, select it, press F2, type the new name, and press Enter. To delete a file 
or folder, select it and press the Delete key. Deleted files go to the Recycle Bin; you can retrieve 
them from there.
You can move and copy files using the Clipboard, drag-and-drop, or use the Move to Folder or 
Copy to Folder command.
A shortcut is a pointer to a file or folder. To create a shortcut, right-drag an object to a new loca-
tion and on the shortcut menu that appears when you release the mouse button, choose Create 
Shortcuts Here.

Sorting File Listings
Windows Explorer enables you to sort the file listing by name, date, or other characteristics. 
To do this, right-click a blank area of the file list, point to Sort By, and click the characteristic 
by which you want to sort. If you display the file list in Details view, you can also click one 
of the column headings to sort by that heading (for example, Type or Size). Try this out for 
yourself. Display the contents of the root directory of the C: volume in Details view, and sort 
the listing by Type. Sorting a file listing can make the files you want to work with contiguous, 
so you can use the Shift key method of selecting them that you learned about earlier in this 
chapter.
Looking at File Properties
Each file has properties that you can view by right-clicking it and choosing Properties from 
the menu. In a file’s Properties box, you will find a General tab that has file attributes on it 
and a Security tab that enables you to configure its security settings. Depending on the file 
type, there may also be other tabs, such as Details and Previous Versions (for some types of 
data files). If it’s an application, there may be a Compatibility tab, on which you can config-
ure the program to run with settings compatible for an earlier version of Windows. If it’s a 
shortcut, a Shortcut tab offers settings for changing the shortcut’s properties. Working on 
your own, open C:\Program Files in Windows Explorer and examine the properties of at least 
one folder and at least three files, and compare the tabs and settings that are available to view 
and adjust.
Compatibility Mode
Some older applications do not run well under Windows 7, but there’s a work-around. You can set 
an application to run in Compatibility mode with settings that simulate an earlier Windows version 
of your choice. To set this up, follow these steps:
	
1.	Right-click the executable file for the program, or a shortcut that you use to run the pro-
gram (such as its shortcut on the Start menu) and choose Properties.
	
2.	On the Compatibility tab, tick the check box next to the Run This Program in Compatibility 
Mode.

work, you can come back later and 
try the next-latest version, and so

Think It Over
Desktop Shortcuts
Some people like to have shortcuts for all 
the applications they use on the desktop, 
so they can access them easily without 
having to use the Start menu. Their 
desktops become covered with dozens of 
icons over time. Other people prefer to 
keep the desktop clean, showing only the 
Recycle Bin, and they pin shortcuts only 
to the taskbar and Start screen. What is your preference, and why? Are there any drawbacks to pin-
ning lots of icons to the desktop? To the taskbar? To the Start screen?
Security versus Convenience
How important is your privacy on your computer? Is it worth it to you in terms of privacy to have 
a separate user account from everyone else who uses your computer? Do you feel more comfort-
able stepping away from the computer while you are logged in if you use the Lock feature to 
password-protect it from others? Or would you rather have the computer be completely open to 
everyone in your family, with no private information?
New Applications
Suppose you bought a new application and it doesn’t use either a Ribbon or a menu system, at 
least not like the ones you have encountered before. How would you figure out how to use the 
program? What are some of the resources that might be available to you?

◽	 Explore graphics and photo-editing programs 
◽	 Understand system requirements and the uninstall process
As you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer Basics,” software is a broad term for any 
program that runs on a computer. This can include the operating system and all its 
helper files, utilities that keep the computer healthy and running well, and applica-
tions. Another name for software is a program.
Application software is software that enables you to perform a useful task on your 
computer. Some programs are classified as productivity software because they allow 
you to get things done. Other application software is designed to entertain you or 
help you learn something.
Business Productivity Software
Businesspeople typically use a collection of applications known as an office suite 
to perform the most common tasks involved in their jobs, such as writing reports 
and correspondence, calculating numbers, giving presentations, and maintaining 
databases of information.

Understanding Word Processing 
and Desktop Publishing
The most popular type of productivity software is the word processor. 
This type of program is used to create text-based documents. A word 
processor contains many features designed to help improve text, such 
as spell-checking, grammar correction, and formatting tools. In fact, 
Microsoft Word is the world’s most widely used word processor and one 
of the most advanced examples of this type of program.
In addition to creating and editing your own work, you can also open 
word-processing documents that other people have created. Word can 
open and save documents in a variety of formats, enabling you to exchange 
documents with people who use other word-processing applications. You 
will learn how to save and open files in Word and other Office applica-
tions in Chapter 7, “Understanding Microsoft Office 2010.”
A word-processing program provides a wide variety of text formatting 
options. For example, you can make the text larger, change its color, 
or use different fonts. You can structure the page to emphasize impor-
tant elements by using a larger type size. You can specify how the text 
is arranged, so that all the words start at the far left or far right of the 
page in a neat vertical arrangement. Figure 6.1 shows a document in 
Microsoft Word that includes several types of formatting, including shad-
ing, different fonts, and multiple columns.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
For even more control over page layout, you can use a desktop publishing 
program, sometimes called page layout software. Some popular desktop 
publishing programs include Microsoft Publisher for casual home users and 
QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign for professionals.
Desktop publishing software enables users to precisely position the text 
and other elements on a page or across a double-page spread (facing 
pages) to create an attractive design. The text can be creatively wrapped 
around embedded images, and graphics can be made transparent, or 
“ghosted,” behind text so the words aren’t obscured.
The main difference operationally between word processing and desk-
top publishing is that a word-processing program typically enables you 
to type directly on the page onscreen, and it flows the text automati-
cally based on the margins, indents, and number of columns you specify. 
Desktop publishing, on the other hand, uses movable and resizable 
frames for everything, including text. This gives you more control over 
the precise positioning of each element, as shown in Figure 6.2.
Figure 6.2  Page layout software offers more sophisticated formatting and design tools than word processing software.

Understanding Spreadsheets
A spreadsheet program is used to analyze and present numeric data. For 
example, you might use a spreadsheet to create a budget, summarize 
sales data, or compare mortgages. Figure 6.3 shows a sales summary 
report with a chart created in Microsoft Excel, the most popular spread-
sheet program available today.
spreadsheet A program that presents rows and 
columns of figures and other items against which 
time and other variables can be plotted.
Careers in IT
Administrative Assistant
An administrative assistant provides office and document support to a manager or executive. He or she is 
expected to know how to use a word processor to create and format documents. The templates supplied with word-
processing software make the formatting and spell-checking processes much easier, but an administrative assis-
tant should be familiar with how they work and be capable of producing neatly formatted reports with charts and 
graphs. An administrative assistant’s duties may also include creating printed materials in other applications, such 
as Excel and PowerPoint, and combining content from multiple applications into reports and presentations. 
All administrative support roles require a solid understanding of office productivity programs and strong organi-
zational skills. A diploma in administration, information technology, or business management is also expected. 
A business administration or IT degree plus vocational courses will help progress your career into office 
management.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Spreadsheet data is entered into cells in rows and columns. You can enter 
text, numbers, or a combination of the two. If you enter numbers, you 
can apply number formatting that makes the numbers appear as currency, 
percentages, or any of several other number types.
Spreadsheet software does more than just record lists of text and data, 
however. It also supports formulas that calculate and manipulate the 
numeric data. For example, in Figure 6.4, each of the expense figures in 
column B is summed in the formula in cell B9: =SUM(B3:B7).
Figure 6.4  A formula is used in cell B9 to sum  
the values in cells B3 through B7.
Spreadsheets can produce a range of charts and graphs based on the data 
they contain, like the one shown in Figure 6.3. These charts can then be 
exported and used in a report such as a word processing document or a 
presentation.
cell The intersection of a row and a column in a 
worksheet.
formula A mathematical calculation to be per-
formed in an Excel cell. It may refer to other cells 
for its values.
Data Analyst
Accountants, tax advisors, business owners, and managers all depend on spreadsheets for their work. However, as 
with word-processing skills, it’s likely you’ll need to use spreadsheets in almost any type of job. The ability to “crunch 
numbers” comes in useful for analysis, planning, and forecasting, too.
Spreadsheets are incredibly useful when working with a large amount of data. A data analyst must have the ability 
to categorize and process large volumes of information and draw meaningful conclusions from them. Databases and 
spreadsheets are both used to process and draw out information.
Data analysts may have a degree in statistics, mathematics, or business, but they also need an in-depth knowledge 
of spreadsheets in order to work with such large amounts of information and variables.
Careers in IT
Understanding Databases
A database is a structured collection of data, such as the inventory of 
a store or a collection of personnel files. A database contains one or 
more tables, each of which contains records. For example, you might 
have a table called Employees that contains a record for each employee. 
table A collection of records, arranged in a  
row-and-column format.
database A collection of data stored in a struc-
tured format, with the same facts stored about 
each instance. A database stores data in a way 
that enables you to search and locate it quickly.

Part II: Software
A record is information about one instance of the data being stored, 
such as one employee, one inventory item, or one sales transaction. Each 
record contains one or more individual pieces of information, called a 
field. For example, in an Employees table, one of the fields might be 
Badge Number, and another might be Hire Date. The software used 
to create and control a database is a database management system 
(DBMS). For small, simple databases, many people use Microsoft 
Access. For large-scale databases, a company might use an enterprise-
level database system like Oracle.
A database program makes calculations and extrapolates information 
using combinations of data and varying instruction sets. You might use it 
to see how one item or person compares to another. For example, your 
school uses a database to keep track of how well you’re doing in com-
parison to your classmates across different subjects. Extracting informa-
tion from a database is known as data mining. Web searches make use 
of data mining to provide search results based on the search query the 
user enters.
The most common type of database is called a relational database. 
In a relational database, there are multiple tables that have relation-
ships to one another. For example, in a sales database, there might be a 
Customers table, an Orders table, and an Order Details table. Because 
an individual customer can have multiple orders, and an individual order 
can contain multiple items, the details about the customer are stored 
separately from the details about the order, and the order line items are 
stored separately from both. Figure 6.5 shows these tables and their rela-
tionships in Microsoft Access. Using related tables allows a salesperson 
to pull up the customer’s shipping and payment information whenever 
he or she starts a new order, rather than having to reenter it each time. 
Microsoft Access creates relational databases.
A hierarchical type of database has a tree structure in which elements 
consist of nodes. The database starts from a single point, known as the 
parent node. The database branches out and has multiple levels. Items 
on a branch are known as child nodes. There may be one or several child 
nodes. A hierarchical database works by narrowing down a search start-
ing with the entire set of records and successively excluding any that the 
search doesn’t apply to. Family historians would use a hierarchical view 
to see all the descendants of a single ancestor.
record A row in a table, storing information about 
a specific person, place, or thing.
field A column in a table, storing one particular 
kind of information, such as Phone or Name.

database that shows how items in a database are 
connected or have attributes in common.

a diagram or in a database; where several items 
share a node, the node itself becomes important.

records are shown in terms of how they relate to 
the originating point at the top of the tree.
database management system (DBMS) 
An application that helps users create and 
­manage databases.
Put It to Work
How an Online Store Uses Databases
When you buy something online, the online store uses an application program to manage the purchase process 
that will connect to the database to check stock levels. When you arrive at the site and log in, the application 
will look for you in the customer database and check that your password and email address match the details 
for your account. When you add an item to your shopping cart, a database query is run to check the stock levels 
and, if applicable, the application places the requested item in your cart and instructs the database stock level to 
decrease by one. When you click Checkout to go the payment page, the site will ask you to confirm or revise your 
payment details and then issue a request to your bank for the funds. Assuming the request is accepted, the online 
shopping application will confirm your purchase and send you an electronic receipt before issuing an instruction to 
the warehouse to send out your goods.

Personal Information Management 
Software
It can be a challenge to keep track of where you need to be, what you 
need to do, and whom you need to contact. Personal information 
management (PIM) software helps people stay organized by providing 
a calendar, an address book, and a to-do list. Some PIM software also 
functions as an email program, and allows you to send, receive, store, 
and organize email messages.
Microsoft Outlook is a very popular email application that includes a 
full set of PIM capabilities. You can also get some of the individual PIM 
functions in other applications. For example, you can buy separate calen-
dar, task list, and email applications, or use free versions online, such as 
Google Calendar and Gmail.
Software Suites
Some software manufacturers, such as Microsoft, offer multiple related 
products that are designed to work well together. They are sometimes 
sold together as a suite, which is a collection of related applications. 
The Microsoft Office suite is a very popular suite of business applica-
tions; you will learn more about it in Chapter 7. It includes Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and Outlook, plus some extra applications in some versions, 
such as Access and Publisher. All the applications in the Office suite have 
similar user interfaces, and can exchange content freely. You can buy each 
application separately, but it is much less expensive to buy the suite.

Adobe also makes a well-known set of professional graphics and 
publishing tools, Creative Suite. In Creative Suite, the Photoshop, 
Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, and Director programs provide 
photo-editing, web design, vector graphics, desktop publishing, and 
video-editing capabilities. Each program in Creative Suite supports the 
proprietary file formats of the other programs, so a Photoshop file can 
be imported into Illustrator, where further elements can be added before 
the file is again opened for final edits to be completed in Photoshop.
Accounting and Personal Finance Software
Whether you are doing the accounting for a small business or just keep-
ing track of your own personal bank account, there is software available 
that can help you. Accounting software simplifies the entire process of 
managing a business’s finances, including creating invoices and purchase 
orders, processing payments, and running reports. QuickBooks is one 
of the most popular accounting applications for small businesses; larger 
businesses may use their own proprietary accounting software. An online 
version is also available on a pay-as-you-go monthly fee plan. Other 
accounting programs include FreshBooks and Outright, both of which 
are web based.
If you are looking to track your own personal finances, you might want 
to consider a program such as Quicken, the most popular personal 
finance software. It can not only manage your bank accounts, but also 
your investments and loans. Microsoft also has a free online tool called 
Mint that can perform many of the same functions, and your bank may 
have its own web-based interface that you can use for free.
If you live in a country where you have to file a yearly income tax state-
ment, you may want to get help from tax software. TurboTax and H&R 
Block are two popular tax applications, each of which comes in various 
versions for different levels of tax filing complexity. This software can 
help you print the forms you need to mail, or in some cases to file the 
required forms electronically for you online.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Vector Image Drawing Programs
There are two main categories of graphic images: vector and raster. 
Although they may look similar, they are structured quite differently, and 
require entirely different types of software to create them.
A vector-based illustration is created with math formulas, like in 
geometry class. A rectangle, an oval, a straight line—they all have a 
math formula that plots them on a two-dimensional grid. A three-
dimensional vector graphic, such as a 3D representation of a cube or 
sphere, plots the image in a three-dimensional grid space. (The software 
does all the math, so you don’t have to worry about that part—you 
just draw by dragging your mouse to create the lines and shapes you 
want.) Professional-quality programs such as Adobe Illustrator create 
very sophisticated vector graphics for commercial uses, such as techni-
cal drawings and architectural plans. At a much simpler level, Microsoft 
Office products like PowerPoint, Word, and Excel all come with basic 
vector drawing tools you can use in their data files. Vector graphics also 
figure prominently into many video games.
Vector images have many advantages. They do not take up much disk 
space to store because the information needed to display them is very 
simple and compact. They can also be resized to any size without any 
loss of quality, because the math formulas behind them are simply 
recalculated and the shape redrawn. The main disadvantage of a vector 
graphic is that even the best quality drawings don’t look completely real. 
Most people would never mistake a character from a game like “Second 
Life” or “The Sims” for a video of a real person, for example.

constructed of mathematically created lines.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Raster (Photo) Editing Programs
A raster graphic, also called a bitmap image, is one that’s composed of 
a grid of colored pixels. When you use a scanner or digital camera to 
capture an image or take a photo, the result is a raster graphic. Raster 
graphics can also be created from scratch using a program such as Paint 
(the free raster image-editing program that comes with Windows) or, 
on the higher end, Adobe Photoshop (or the consumer-level version, 
Photoshop Elements, shown in Figure 6.6).
A raster graphic has a native size, known as its resolution. Resolution is 
measured in number of pixels horizontally by number of pixels vertically, 
like this: 1024 × 768. This is the same way monitor screen resolution 
is measured, as you may remember from Chapter 3, “Input, Output, 
and Storage.” The higher the resolution, the better the picture will look 
when printed at a large size.
A raster image also has a color depth, which means the number of bits 
required to describe each pixel’s color. A standard color depth is 24-bit, 
which uses 8 bits for red, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue. There 
are 224 (that is, 2 to the 24th power, or about 16 million) unique colors 
possible in 24-bit color. The human eye can only detect about 10 million 
different colors, so this is more than enough for full photorealism.
One disadvantage of raster graphics is that they take up a lot of disk space. 
Each pixel requires 24 bits to describe it, at a minimum, so a 1024 × 768 
image would take up at least 2,359,296 bytes (about 2.3 MB) in an uncom-
pressed file—maybe more, depending on the file format. Because raster 
images can be so large, some file formats employ compression.

of colored pixels that collectively form an image.

or on a display screen.

an image horizontally and vertically.

of a data file by encoding information using fewer 
bits than the original file.

Part II: Software
Figure 6.6  Photoshop Elements, a simpler version of the popular Adobe Photoshop, can be used to create and edit raster graphics.
Depending on the file format, compression can either be lossless (no loss 
of image quality) or lossy (some loss of image quality).
The other major problem with raster graphics is that they tend to lose 
their quality when resized—especially when enlarged beyond their origi-
nal dimensions. This happens because when you enlarge a raster image, 
the pixels don’t change size, so the software must simulate a particular 
pixel’s color, taking up more space than it originally did. The trouble is, 
it’s not nearly as simple as just adding another pixel of the same color 
next to the original, because resizing is often done in odd multiples, like 
15%. Therefore, the image-editing software must do its best to simulate 
the enlargement by doubling some pixels but not others, and the result is 
a jagged or fuzzy image. In Figure 6.7, for example, see how this image, 
originally with crisp lines, becomes pixilated (that is, you can see the jag-
ged edges of individual pixels) when it’s enlarged.

Presentation Graphics Software
At various points in your working life, you’re likely to be asked to give a 
presentation or make a speech. It’s a daunting prospect. However, you 
can deflect some of the attention by giving your audience something 
else to look at. They will also find it easier to digest what you have to 
say if you provide a visual representation of key facts and figures you’re 
discussing. Presentation graphics software is the ideal tool for this pur-
pose. It enables you to create screen-sized slides containing a mixture of 
words and images that you can move through on demand as you deliver 
your presentation. You can incorporate audio and video clips, corporate 
branding such as company logos and color schemes, and other special 
elements and features. (See Figure 6.8.)

Most presentations are created and delivered using the Microsoft 
PowerPoint part of the Microsoft Office productivity suite. On an Apple 
computer, the equivalent program is Keynote; there is also a version of 
Microsoft Office available for Apple devices such as Macs and iPads.
Presentation graphics generally distill what the speaker says into bulleted 
summaries, and bar and pie charts. Such presentations may accompany 
a detailed report or be used as part of a marketing pitch—for example, 
showing why a company is better to do business with than its rivals. The 
most effective presentations have only a handful of slides and feature 
minimal details, allowing the audience to focus on what the presenter 
says. To make your point effectively, avoid creating long and boring pre-
sentations crammed with far too much information.
Computer-Aided Design Software
Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used when designing any 
sort of item that has a physical form (rather than being flat like a photo). 
It uses the same basic idea as the two-dimensional vector graphics that 
you learned about earlier in this chapter, but it models them to have 
height, width, and depth. This is also known as 3D modeling.
Three-dimensional drawings are built around a wireframe. This is a sort 
of skeleton on which details of the computerized object or character are 
overlaid. The wireframe is created by extruding the flat shape to give it 
volume and depth.
The object is also given mass and assigned textures and properties such 
as skin, hair, bones, or fabric. Each of these elements has a predefined 
(but separately editable) set of attributes. For instance, the attributes 
of a brick wall would include strength, inflexibility, and resistance to 
wind and people bumping into it. The wireframe can be rotated so 
the designer can check that all the design elements and perspective are 
correct.
Once all the attributes have been added to an object created using a 
CAD program, the object is rendered to give it the appearance of a solid 
form by applying surface texture and color. For example, in Figure 6.9, 
which shows a rendered image in AutoCAD, notice how the image sur-
face of the handheld vacuum includes two different surface textures: One 
looks like solid plastic, and the other looks semi-transparent.
Rendering can require huge amounts of computer power. Especially 
detailed designs can take many hours to render. If you want to design in 
3D, you will need a powerful desktop computer with a multi-core CPU, 
lots of memory, and a high-quality graphics card.
computer-aided design (CAD) The process 
of using computer software to produce technical 
drawings that include the product’s precise scale, 
simulate its textures, and show it in full three-
dimensional detail.
wireframe A 3D vector drawing that consists 
only of drawn lines, without any surface textures 
applied.
render To apply a surface texture and fill to a 
wireframe image to give it a solid appearance.

Computer-Aided Designer
Many creative industries depend on computers for their work. The computer games and film industries make 
extensive use of 3D design. Almost every new product that’s created is prototyped using CAD software, too. A 
CAD designer needs strong technical drawing and creative graphics skills.
Developments in CAD software and a new type of printer have made it possible to prototype objects much more 
cheaply. A 3D printer uses plastic rather than ink to lay down layer upon layer in order to build up three-
dimensional objects. Consequently, there is a greater demand for people who can produce the designs for the 
objects that will be printed in 3D. 3D printers such as the Makerbot Replicator 2X (pictured) are being used in 
classrooms and by hobbyists to create 3D models.

Other Types of Software
Besides the big categories of software we’ve looked at so far in this 
chapter, there are many smaller categories, such as lifestyle and hobby 
programs, and educational software. The following sections only scratch 
the surface of what’s available; you will want to explore the many types 
of applications available on your own.
Music and Video Players
If you have a Windows computer, you’ll find that Windows Media Player 
can play music you’ve downloaded and any music CDs you insert. It 
will also play some video clips and movies. As an alternative to Windows 
Media Player, you might use iTunes, which is a free download from 
Apple’s website. iTunes, shown in Figure 6.10, can play music, videos, 
podcasts, audio books, and more. You can also use online services, such 
as Pandora, to listen to music.
Figure 6.10  iTunes is one example of an application that can play music and video clips.
Your computer may come with a DVD movie player application, or you 
might choose to buy one, such as RealPlayer Plus, WinX, or CyberLink 
PowerDVD. This software provides an interface you can use to watch 
movies on DVD and Blu-ray discs (provided, of course, you have an 
appropriate disc drive).

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Can’t Play DVDs?
If Windows Media Player won’t play DVDs, it may be because you are missing a codec. A codec is a translation file;  
codec is short for coder/decoder. Different file formats require different codecs, and not all versions of Windows 7 come 
with the one you need to play DVD movies. (If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, Ultimate, or Enterprise, you should 
have it already.) You can choose to buy and install the needed codec (see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/
windows/windows-media-player-plug-ins), but before you do that, see whether there is some other application 
installed on your PC that will play DVD movies. Most PCs that come with a DVD drive also come with such software.
codec A translation file used to play back a 
certain audio or video format. An abbreviation of 
coder/decoder.
Troubleshooting
Audio and Video Editing Software
If you want to create your own videos and music, you’ll need a camera 
and instruments to do so. You can easily capture video and record audio 
on a smartphone and then transfer them to your computer for editing.
Many applications are available for editing audio tracks. For example, the 
freeware program Audacity (audacity.sourceforge.net) lets you 
import multiple audio tracks, trim out the parts you don’t require, and 
then splice everything together. Mac users can record and mix digital 
piano, guitar, and drum tracks in the excellent GarageBand application. 
You can also buy more full-featured products, such as Adobe Audition.
Windows Live Essentials (windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/ 
windows-live/essentials) contains a free Windows Movie Maker 
program that you can use to trim and combine video clips and photos and 
to add a sound track or commentary (see Figure 6.11). On a Mac, iMovie 
offers slick tools to quickly create your own mini movie. Neither of these 
programs will tax your computer’s processor, but if you want to create 
professional-looking movies you’ll need to use a dedicated video-editing pro-
gram such as Sony Vegas Pro or Adobe Director. As with the animation and 
3D graphics programs described earlier, you need a powerful computer; a 
quad-core or eight-core processor and powerful graphics card are essential.
Figure 6.11  You can use a free video editor such as Windows Movie Maker to make video 
clips from your photos.

Personal Enrichment and 
Education Software
Just about anything that you want to accomplish, you can find software 
to help you do it. For example, you can buy legal software that will help 
you draw up basic legal documents that are valid in your location, such as 
a will, a power of attorney statement, a lease, and a loan agreement.
You can also improve your life by using reference software, such as dic-
tionary and encyclopedia programs. These are mostly found online these 
days because it is easier to keep them current that way; you might choose 
to use free resources or to pay for a subscription to an online encyclope-
dia with premium content.
legal software Software that guides the user in 
creating legally binding contracts and forms.
reference software Software that provides 
access to established facts and information on a 
variety of topics.
NOTE
With so many free online reference sources today, why would someone want a reference tool such as an 
online encyclopedia with premium content? One important reason is that a commercial source of reference 
materials offers more accuracy and higher quality because they can afford to pay full-time fact-checkers and 
professional writers. Online sources that are collaboratively maintained, such as Wikipedia, do not provide any 
assurance of accuracy, and the writing quality varies a great deal among entries.
Educational software can teach new skills and expand your knowledge 
on a variety of subjects. When you think of educational software, you 
might at first think of software designed for children, but there are many 
adult education programs too, such as Rosetta Stone for learning new 
languages (see Figure 6.12). Many colleges and universities offer online 
courses that have their own proprietary learning interfaces, including 
video lectures, interactive tutorials, and text and graphical lessons.

or trains an individual in a particular type of 
knowledge or skill.

A Free Education
Do you know someone who would like to be better educated but doesn’t have the money to spend on higher educa-
tion? Direct her to Open Yale, a service of Yale University, at http://oyc.yale.edu. To quote from its website: 
“Open Yale offers free and open access to a selection of introductory courses taught by distinguished teachers and 
scholars at Yale University. The aim of the project is to expand access to educational materials for all who wish to 
learn. All lectures were recorded in the Yale College classroom and are available in video, audio, and text transcript 
formats. Registration is not required.” This program does not issue any credit, degree, or certificate.

Communication Software
Communication software provides various ways of communicating with 
other people, usually via the Internet.
An email application helps you send and receive email messages. You 
might choose a stand-alone application like Eudora, a combination email 
and PIM application like Outlook, or an online web-based service like 
Outlook.com or Gmail.
Most operating systems come with a web browser application, but you 
can also download and install others, most of them for free. Popular 
browsers include Internet Explorer (which comes with Windows), 
Google Chrome (which comes with the Chrome OS), Safari (which 
comes with Mac OS X and iOS), Opera, and Firefox. Figure 6.13 shows 
the Google Chrome browser.

Figure 6.13  Versions of the Chrome browser are available for a variety of operating systems.
Free instant messaging applications such as Yahoo! IM and AOL 
Instant Messenger enable you to have text conversations with your 
friends and family from your computer desktop. Some of these pro-
grams also have some video chat capabilities. Services such as Skype are 
designed specifically for video chat; they enable you to have person-to-
person video chats with other people, provided you both have webcams 
and microphones on your computers.
Businesses use videoconferencing programs to hold meetings involving 
multiple people at multiple locations. These programs are the full-featured 
business version of video chat; they not only allow you to see and hear 
other participants, but also allow you to share computer screens, collabo-
rate on documents in real-time, draw on a virtual whiteboard, and more. 
A company that does a lot of remote conferencing may have its own 
server with its own conferencing software.
Groupware helps people who are working on projects together to keep 
in touch. Users can post shared files that can be collaboratively edited, 
exchange messages, hold online meetings, and more in this environment. 
Microsoft SharePoint is one example of groupware software.
Web Authoring Software
Want to create your own website? There are many ways to do it. You can 
code your own files in a plain text editor like Notepad and then check 
your work in a browser, but most people (including most professionals) 
use web authoring software that provides a what-you-see-is-what-
you-get (WYSIWYG, pronounced wizzy-wig) interface. Using this 
software, you don’t have to constantly switch back and forth between 
your code and a browser window to see what you’re doing. One popular

Managing Your Applications
In the following sections, you’ll learn some important information that will 
help you choose the right software and manage your software collection.
Application System Requirements
Before you purchase an application, you should check its system require-
ments. The system requirements represent the minimum hardware 
configuration required in order to successfully install and run the applica-
tion. You can find the system requirements printed on the software box 
if you buy it at a retail store; if you buy it online, you can find them on 
the application’s website. System requirements usually include a mini-
mum CPU speed, a minimum amount of RAM, and certain standards 
for sound and video support. They may also specify Internet access, a 
particular type of input device (such as a joystick), and a certain amount 
of free hard drive space. Figure 6.14 shows the system requirements for 
the World of Warcraft video game under Windows, for example. It is 
common for the system requirements for games to be more restrictive 
than for business applications because of the intense graphic processing 
needed for games that have complex motion graphics. As you can see in 
Figure 6.13, this application has two sets of specs: one for the minimum 
requirements, and one that is recommended for best performance.

Installing and Removing Applications
Installing an application is easy. To install an application that came on 
CD or DVD, simply insert the disc into your computer. The Setup util-
ity should run automatically. If it does not, browse the content of the 
drive and double-click the Setup.exe file. To install an application that 
you downloaded, double-click the downloaded file after it has finished 
downloading.
To remove an application in Windows 7, you use the Control Panel, as 
described in the following steps.
Step by Step
Uninstalling a Windows Application
Follow these steps to uninstall an application in Windows 7: 
	 1.	Click Start, and click Control Panel.
	 2.	Under the Programs heading, click Uninstall or Change a Program.
	 3.	Click the program to uninstall on the list of programs that appears.
	 4.	In the bar at the top of the list, click Uninstall.
	
	
	 5.	Follow the prompts that appear to uninstall the application. They will vary depending on the application.
	 6.	If prompted to restart the computer after the uninstall has completed, click Yes to do so.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Updating Applications
Application developers frequently release free updates to their prod-
ucts. These updates may add new features, fix problems, or both. Some 
updates even patch security holes that make your computer vulnerable 
to online attack. It is almost always a good idea to install any available 
updates right away.
Some applications are set up to automatically notify you when an update 
is available. The notification may pop up in a dialog box, or as a balloon 
near the notification area. Click in the message that appears and follow 
the prompts. Some Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, update 
themselves automatically as needed through Windows Update.
Other applications must be checked manually for updates. For example, 
some applications have a Check for Updates command on the Help 
menu, as in Figure 6.15. Select the command to allow the program to 
check its home website for updates. Then follow the prompts that appear 
if an update is available. You might have to go to the website manually to 
look for updates.

Summary
Business Productivity Software
A word processor is used to create text-based documents. Desktop publishing software provides 
more control over page layout than a word processor. A spreadsheet is a grid used to analyze and 
present numeric data in cells. Spreadsheets use formulas to perform calculations.
A database is a structured collection of data. The data resides in tables, each of which contains 
records and fields. An application that creates databases is a database management system. Data 
mining is the process of extracting useful information from a database. The most common type 
of database is a relational database, which has multiple tables with relationships between them; 
another type is a hierarchical database, which uses a tree structure made up of nodes.
A suite is a group of related applications, such as the applications in Microsoft Office. There are 
other suites too, such as Adobe Creative Suite.
Accounting software helps small businesses maintain their financial records. Personal finance 
software helps individuals and families do the same. Tax software helps individuals and businesses 
file their tax forms.
Graphics Software
Graphics software is software that enables you to create and manipulate visual images. Vector 
graphics are lines and shapes drawn mathematically, like in geometry. Vector graphics are small 
and easily resizable but not realistic.
Raster graphics, or bitmaps, are composed of a grid of colored pixels. They are large and don’t 
resize well but can be photorealistic. A raster graphic’s size is its resolution (number of pixels 
horizontally and vertically). It has a color depth, which is the number of bits required to describe 
each pixel’s color. Some file formats support image transparency, image animation, and/or 
compression. When a raster image is resized, it may become pixelated.
Presentation graphics software enables you to create slides to use as visual aids in presentations.
Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used to design 3D objects using vector-based draw-
ings. An object drawing starts out as a wireframe and then is rendered by having surface textures 
and colors applied to it.
Other Types of Software
Music applications such as iTunes can plan and manage not only music but also videos, podcasts, 
and audio books. DVD player software can play movies from DVD discs on your computer. For 
Windows Media Player to play DVDs, you must have a supported version of Windows or purchase 
a codec. To edit your own audio and video files, a variety of free and low-cost programs are avail-
able, as well as higher-end professional tools.
Legal software helps people draw up basic legal documents that are valid in their location. 
Reference software provides a collection of information, such as a dictionary or an encyclope-
dia. Educational software can teach new skills and expand your knowledge through lessons and 
tutorials.

Chapter 6: Understanding Application Software
Communication software includes email applications, instant messaging, and video chat. 
Professional-quality video chat for groups is called videoconferencing. Groupware is software 
that helps people work together as a team from remote locations.
Web authoring software helps people create web pages and sites. Some are simple text editors, but 
most are what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG), for easier viewing of the edits.
Managing Your Applications
The system requirements of an application explain the minimum hardware configuration 
required to run the application successfully. It may include specs for CPU, memory, graphics, and 
hard drive space.
To install an application, insert its CD/DVD or run its Setup file. To remove an application, use 
the Uninstall a Program feature in the Control Panel in Windows.
Some applications update themselves automatically; with others, you must locate and run a Check 
for Updates command in the software interface or visit the manufacturer’s website to see if updates 
are available.

Making Older Software Work in Windows 7
Applications originally written to run under earlier versions of Windows may not always per-
form well under Windows 7. One work-around is to set up Compatibility Mode for an applica-
tion. Compatibility Mode can simulate any of several earlier Windows versions when interacting 
with that application. Using the Help and Support in Windows 7, look up information about 
Compatibility Mode to learn how it works and how to enable it.
With your instructor’s permission, download a shareware or freeware game from www.download.
com, where the system requirements do not include Windows 7, and install it on your computer. As 
you are locating a game to download, look at the system requirements for the game to find out the 
highest Windows version it supports. Then configure Compatibility Mode to emulate that version. 
Try the game to make sure it works with these settings. When you are finished, uninstall the game.
Other Software Types
There are many other software types besides the ones presented in this chapter. Using the Internet 
to help provide ideas, make a list of at least seven types of software that weren’t covered in this 
chapter, and write a brief description of each type, including who might use it and what they 
might use it for. If you can’t think of seven types, look at a website that sells software, such as 
Amazon.com, for ideas.

Understanding the Office 
2010 Interface
Each Office 2010 application has the same basic controls, so once you 
have mastered one application, learning another application is easy.
The heart of each Office application’s controls is a thick toolbar across 
the top called the Ribbon. The Ribbon has multiple tabs; click a tab to 
display a different set of controls. The Home tab is displayed by default 
when you open the application. Each tab of the Ribbon is organized 
into groups. A group is a named section; the group names appear at the 
bottom of each group. Some groups have a dialog box launcher in the 
lower-right corner. Clicking this button opens a dialog box or task pane 
with more extensive options than are shown on the Ribbon itself.
Some tabs are common to all applications, such as Home, Insert, and 
View; others are unique to a particular application, such as the Mailings 
tab in Word and the Formulas tab in Excel. Figure 7.1 shows the 
Ribbons in Word 2010 and Excel 2010.
To the left of the regular tabs is a File tab, which opens Backstage view. 
Within Backstage view, you can select a command for saving, opening, or 
closing a file, or click a category and then select commands on the right. 
The commands change depending on which category you choose. For 
example, in Figure 7.2, the Save & Send category has been selected.
Ribbon The main toolbar in Office applications 
and some other Windows applications, consisting

products, you may want to pursue Microsoft Office 
Specialist certification. Candidates take a series of 
tests that show their mastery of the applications, 
and after passing the exams, earn a certificate. 
Potential employers will see this certification as 
proof that you can use Office applications produc-
tively to tackle whatever tasks are given to you.
There are three levels of certification. You can earn a 
Microsoft Office Specialist certification in each appli-
cation. For Expert level certification, you must pass 
the Expert level exams for Word and Excel. For Master 
level, you must pass the Expert level exams for Word 
and Excel plus the basic level exam for PowerPoint 
and one other basic level exam of your choice 
(Outlook, Access, or SharePoint). See http://www.
microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mos-certification.aspx to learn about the certification program.

TIP
To temporarily hide the Ribbon for more workspace onscreen, click the up-pointing arrow to the right of the 
Ribbon’s tab names. The Ribbon will appear only when you click a tab name. To restore the Ribbon to being 
always on, click the down-pointing arrow (which replaced the up-pointing arrow you clicked earlier).
Above the Ribbon, on the left end of the title bar, is the Quick Access 
Toolbar (QAT). You can customize this toolbar by adding and remov-
ing commands from it. This toolbar remains constant no matter which 
tab is displayed, so you can keep your favorite commands close at hand 
on the QAT without having to remember which tab contains them. The 
down-pointing arrow at the right end of the QAT opens a menu of com-
mon commands that you can toggle on and off on the QAT by selecting 
them, as shown in Figure 7.3. You can also choose More Commands 
from that menu to add other commands to it that aren’t on the list.

Ribbon Doesn’t Look Right?
If the Ribbon in an application doesn’t appear to have the same commands on it as your classmates’ comput-
ers, yours may have been customized. To reset the Ribbon, right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose 
Customize the Ribbon. In the lower-right corner of the dialog box that appears, click Reset and then click Reset All 
Customizations. Then click OK. Your Ribbon will be back to its original state.
Troubleshooting
When you right-click, a 
shortcut menu appears (also 
called a context menu). Its 
commands depend on what 
you right-clicked. If you 
right-click a selected block of 
text, for example, commands 
appear that will help you 
format it, move or copy it, and 
check its spelling, as shown in 
Figure 7.4. If you right-click 
on a graphic, commands appear 
for formatting and position-
ing the graphic. The shortcut 
menu that appears when you 
right-click a button on the 
Ribbon offers an option to add 
that command to the Quick 
Access Toolbar.
When you hover the mouse 
pointer over a button or 
command on the Ribbon, a 
ScreenTip appears, telling you its name and purpose. In some cases, 
ScreenTips also contain keyboard shortcut prompts. For example, 
when you point at the Justify button on the Home tab, you find out 
that Ctrl+J is the keyboard shortcut setting that alignment, as shown in 
Figure 7.5. To use a keyboard shortcut, hold down the first key while 
you tap (press and release) the second key.

TIP
For a list of all the available keyboard shortcuts in an application, open the application’s Help window (F1) 
and search for keyboard shortcuts. The status bar, at the bottom of the application window, provides several 
pieces of status-related information. In a Word document, for example, it tells you how many pages are in the 
document and what page number you are working with at the moment. It also tells you how many words are in 
the document. See Figure 7.6. The exact details the status bar provides depend on the application.
status bar The bar at the bottom of an applica-
tion’s window that reports status information.
Figure 7.6  The Status bar in Word 2010.
At the right end of the status bar are the Zoom controls. The Zoom 
controls enable you to zoom in and out to view your work at different 
magnifications. You can drag the slider, or you can click the - (minus) 
or + (plus) button on its ends to increment the zoom out (-) or in (+). 
The current zoom level is reported to the left of the Zoom slider; click 
the current Zoom level to open a Zoom dialog box in which you can 
set the zoom level more precisely. You can see the Zoom and View 
­controls in Figure 7.6. The View tab also has Zoom controls that per-
form the same functions (plus a few others).
As with any window, you can adjust an Office application window’s 
size. To resize a window, drag its border, and to move a window, drag 
its title bar. You can maximize it by clicking its Maximize button (in 
the upper-right corner of the window), and 
then restore it to pre-maximized size by 
clicking the Restore button, which replaces 
the Maximize button when the window is 
maximized. You can minimize the window 
down to a button on the taskbar with the 
Minimize button, and you can close the 
window (which closes the application and 
any open files) by clicking the Close button. 
Figure 7.7 points out the window controls in 
an Office application’s window.

Using Basic Features of  
Office Applications
Office applications have many commands and features in common. For 
example, the procedures for getting help, changing views, cutting and 
pasting, formatting text, and undoing mistakes are nearly identical. In 
the following sections, you will learn about some features that work the 
same way in each of the main Office applications.
Getting Help
To get help in any Office application, do any of the following:
◾	 Press the F1 key. If you do this while a dialog box is open, the 
help provided is context-sensitive.
◾	 Click the Help button. It’s the question mark in a blue circle 
above the right end of the Ribbon. You can see it in Figure 7.7, 
below the Close button.
◾	 Click the File tab and click Help.
In the Help window that appears, you can search for a particular topic by 
typing a keyword in the Search box, or you can browse the Help system 
by clicking on one of the hyperlinks on the home page of the Help sys-
tem. Figure 7.8 identifies the buttons on the Help window’s toolbar.
Figure 7.8  Use the Help window to look up information about using the active application.

Changing Views
Each application has its own unique set of views that you can switch 
among while working with your data. Different views are useful in dif-
ferent situations. For example, in PowerPoint, you use Normal view for 
general slide editing and Slide Sorter view to reorder and organize the 
slides. In Word, you use Print Layout view for most editing, but you 
can switch to Outline view to organize sections of a document or Web 
Layout to see how a document will appear when saved as a web page.
To switch views, select the desired view from the View tab on the 
Ribbon. See Figure 7.9. You can also switch to certain views using the 
Views buttons on the status bar (just to the left of the Zoom controls).
Figure 7.9  Choose an appropriate view for the task at hand from the View tab.
Figure 7.10  A scroll bar in Micro-
soft Word.
Moving Around
As you create content in an application, 
you might have more content than you 
can see onscreen at once, so you might 
need to scroll to view different parts of 
it. You can scroll using the scroll bars 
with your mouse. Figure 7.10 shows a 
scroll bar.
In Excel, the vertical and horizontal 
scroll bars are always available. In Word 
and PowerPoint, the vertical scroll bar 
is always available, but the horizontal 
one only appears if the displayed docu-
ment is wider than the screen width.
scroll To page through the document so that a 
different part of it becomes visible.
scroll bar The horizontal or vertical bar to the 
bottom or right of the document, containing scroll 
arrows and a scroll box, which you can use to 
scroll.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
181
Chapter 7: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
TIP
Here are some ways to use a scroll bar:
◾	 Click the arrow at the end of a scroll bar to scroll the display slowly in the direction of an arrow (a small 
amount each time you click).
◾	 Drag the box in the scroll bar to scroll quickly.
◾	 Click in the empty space on the bar to one side or the other of the scroll box to move one screenful at 
a time in that direction.
The size of the scroll box indicates how much content you can’t see at 
the moment. For example, in Figure 7.10, the scroll box occupies about 
one-third of the scroll bar; that means that about one-third of the docu-
ment’s content is currently visible. In a very large spreadsheet or docu-
ment, the scroll box might be very small.
You can also move around using keyboard shortcuts. As you gain 
experience with the applications, you might find using keyboard short-
cuts more convenient than using the scroll bar. For example, press-
ing Ctrl+Home takes you to the beginning of the file in most Office 
applications.
Scrolling the display does not move the insertion point. To move the 
insertion point, click where you want it to go, or use the directional 
arrow keys on your keyboard to move it. In Excel, there is no insertion 
point, but a thick outline around the active cell shows the cell in which 
content will be entered.
Selecting Content
Most of the commands you issue apply to whatever text or object is 
selected. For example, to italicize text, you first select the text to affect. 
Then when you click the Italics button, only the selected text is affected.
When you select in Excel, you usually want to select entire cells rather 
than individual characters of text. When a cell is selected, any format-
ting or other commands that you issue apply to everything in that cell. 
You can select a contiguous range (all in one rectangular block area) 
or a non-contiguous range (multiple cells that are not adjacent to one 
another). To select an object (such as graphic), click it.
scroll box The box in the scroll bar that you can 
drag to scroll the display. You can also click above 
or below the scroll bar to scroll one screenful at 
a time.
insertion point The flashing vertical line that 
indicates where typed text will appear.
Step by Step
Selecting Text in Word or PowerPoint
Do any of the following to select text:
◾	 Drag the mouse pointer across it (holding down the left mouse button).
◾	 Click where you want to start and then hold down Shift as you press the arrow keys to extend the selection.
◾	 Click where you want to start and then hold down Shift and click where you want to end the selection.

Using the Office Clipboard
In the section “Moving and Copying Files and Folders” in Chapter 5, 
“Introduction to Windows 7,” you learned about the Windows 
Clipboard. This temporary holding area enables you to cut or copy an 
item from one location and then paste it into another location, effec-
tively moving or copying it. The Clipboard can also be used to cut, copy, 
and paste snippets of data from different applications and data files into 
a single file. For example, you can copy a paragraph from a Word docu-
ment and paste it into an Excel worksheet or PowerPoint slide, or into 
a different location in Word (either in the same document or a different 
document).
Table 7.1 provides a quick summary of the ways to cut, copy, and paste 
in Office applications.
Selecting Cells in Excel
To select a contiguous range of cells:
◾	 Drag the mouse pointer across the cells (holding down the left mouse button).
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Shift as you press the arrow keys to extend the selection.
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Shift and click the last cell.
To select a non-contiguous range of cells:
◾	 Click the first cell to select it and then hold down Ctrl and click each individual cell to select.

Microsoft Office has an enhanced version of the Clipboard called the 
Office Clipboard. It uses the Windows Clipboard as its basis, but adds 
the capability to store up to 24 objects at a time. (On the Windows 
Clipboard, when you cut or copy another object, the previously saved 
object is removed from the Clipboard.)

Windows Clipboard that appears in Office applica-
tions. It can hold up to 24 items at once.

To display the Office 
Clipboard’s task pane, click 
the dialog box launcher in the 
Clipboard group on the Home 
tab. Each time you cut or copy 
something to the Clipboard 
from an Office application, 
it is placed on the list in the 
task pane. If you want to 
paste the most recently cut or 
copied item, you can use the 
standard methods of pasting 
from Table 7.1. However, 
if you want to paste one of 
the earlier items, display the 
Clipboard task pane and then 
click the item you want to 
paste. Figure 7.11 shows the 
Clipboard task pane with 
several items on it. The Office 
Clipboard is shared among 
all Office applications, so you 
can, for example, copy several 
cell ranges or charts from 
Excel and have access to them 
in PowerPoint or Word on the 
Office Clipboard.
Figure 7.11  The Office Clipboard task pane 
enables you to store up to 24 items to be pasted.
Clearing the Office Clipboard
If you don’t exit from all Office applications before stepping away from your computer, anyone who sits down 
at your computer can see the items on the Office Clipboard. If you have any concerns about privacy, click the 
Clear All button at the top of the Clipboard task pane to remove all items from it after you are finished using the 
Clipboard.

Using Undo and Redo
If you make a mistake in an Office application, you can easily undo your 
last action with the Undo command. You can either click it on the Quick 
Access Toolbar (see Figure 7.12) or press Ctrl+Z, its keyboard shortcut. 
You can do this multiple times in a row to go back multiple steps.
There’s an easy way to undo multiple actions at a time. The Undo but-
ton has a down arrow to its right; click it for a drop-down list of recent 
actions, and then drag across the ones you want to undo.
After you have used Undo, a 
Redo button becomes available 
to its right on the QAT. Redo 
undoes the Undo operation. 
You can use Redo as many 
times in a row as you used 
Undo. For example, if you just 
clicked Undo three times to 
undo the last three actions, you 
can then click Redo three times to redo those actions. The shortcut for 
Redo is Ctrl+Y.
When Redo is not available, its button on the QAT turns into a Repeat 
button, which enables you to repeat the last action you took. If you 
aren’t sure which button is active in that spot (Redo or Repeat), hover 
the mouse over the button and see what name appears in the ScreenTip.
Text Entry and Formatting
To enter text, click in an area that accepts text, moving the insertion 
point there, and begin typing. In Excel, you type in cells; in PowerPoint, 
you type in object placeholder frames. In Word, you can type text 
directly on the document page. To edit, use the Backspace key to delete 
the character to the left of the insertion point, or use Delete to delete the 
character to its right. You can also select blocks of text, or cells contain-
ing content, and press the Delete key to clear the text. See “Selecting 
Content” earlier in this chapter. In Excel, rather than an insertion point, 
there’s a cell cursor, a thick outline that indicates the active cell.
cell cursor The thick line around the active cell 
in Excel, indicating that this is where typed text 
will appear.
Figure 7.12  Undo and Redo buttons on the 
Quick Access Toolbar. The Undo button’s menu 
enables you to go back multiple steps.
Put It to Work
Click and Type
In Word, when you start a new document, the insertion point is in the upper-left corner of the page. 
What if you want to type something in the center of the page, or at the bottom? One method is to 
press Enter until you get to the desired vertical position. An easier way is to use Click and Type. 
Move the mouse pointer to the spot where you would like to place the insertion point, so that the 
mouse pointer turns into an I-beam with an image of one of the alignment buttons next to it (from 
the Home tab’s Paragraph group). Depending on where on the page horizontally you move, the 
alignment symbol changes to show how the text will be set to align if you click and type in that spot. Click, and the 
insertion point jumps to the spot you clicked, and Word automatically creates the needed paragraph breaks to get 
the insertion point to that spot. This only works in Word, not in Excel or PowerPoint.

Chapter 7: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
All the Office applications have similar controls for text formatting. After 
you select some text, you can use the commands in the Font group on 
the Home tab to change the font, size, and color of text, as well as apply 
attributes like bold, italics, and underlining. Figure 7.13 shows the Font 
group in Word and points out the buttons that are common to all the 
applications. To find out what the other buttons are in this group, point 
at each one to view the ScreenTip.
Figure 7.13  Use the Font group’s commands to format text.
Understanding Themes and Color Palettes
Each application enables users to apply themes, which are groups of format-
ting presets. A theme contains definitions of three key formatting aspects: 
fonts, colors, and effects (applied to graphic objects). In some applications, 
a theme may contain additional elements; for example, in PowerPoint, a 
theme may contain a background image that is applied to each slide. You 
can override a theme’s settings in one or more of those areas by applying a 
color theme, font theme, or effect theme (which are like themes but more 
limited, affecting only that one aspect of the formatting).
Each document, workbook, or presentation has a set of 12 color place-
holders: 10 colors for standard use, and 2 colors that define the colors 
for followed and unfollowed hyperlinks. The choice of theme (or color 
theme) dictates what those colors will be.
Commands for selecting colors (such as the Font Color button on the 
Home tab) open a color palette from which you can select a color, like 
the one shown in Figure 7.14.
theme A named set of formatting presets, gov-
erning font, color, and object effect choices.
color palette A grid of color choices that opens 
when you click a button for a feature that is 
color-related.

Figure 7.14  Select a color from a palette of choices.
On this palette, you see the following choices:
◾	 Theme Colors: The top row in this section contains theme colors, 
color swatches for the colors assigned to each placeholder posi-
tion in the theme. Beneath the top row are variants of the theme 
colors, either lighter or darker than the original color by a speci-
fied amount. When you apply colors from this area, you are not 
choosing actual colors—you are choosing placeholder positions. If 
you change to a different theme or color theme, those colors will 
change.
◾	 Standard Colors: Standard colors are fixed, and are not affected 
by the theme or color theme.
◾	 More Colors: If you want a fixed color but none of the color 
swatches in the Standard Colors section are right, choose More 
Colors to open a Colors dialog box from which you can select a 
color more specifically. On the General tab of this dialog box is a 
larger assortment of swatches. On the Custom tab, you can specify 
a color by number using one of the standard color models.
There may be other choices at the bottom of the palette, depending 
on the object you are applying color to. For example, there may be a 
Gradient option for applying a blend of colors.
Moving and Resizing Objects
Each application includes the capability to insert content in movable and 
resizable frames that either float over the top of the regular content (as 
is the case in Excel) or interact with the text on the underlying page in a 
way you specify (as in Word). In PowerPoint, all content is in frames.
theme colors The colors assigned to the color 
placeholders in a theme.
standard colors Fixed colors that are not 
affected by the theme in use.

Chapter 7: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
The content within one of these frames is known as an object. An object 
can be a graphic, a chart, a drawing, or any of several other items. A text 
box can also be an object.
To resize an object, drag one of its selection 
handles. A selection handle is a small marker in 
a corner of the object’s frame or at the midpoint 
along one side of the frame. Depending on the 
application and the type of object, the selection 
handles may be either white or colored (black, pale 
blue, or bluish-green), and may be either round 
or square. Figure 7.15 shows the selection handles 
around a text box, for example.

the document, with its own movable and resizable 
frame.
selection handles The markers on the border 
of an object that allow the object to be resized.
Figure 7.15  Drag a selection handle to resize an object.
CAUTION
As you resize an object, its aspect ratio (proportion of height to width) may change. If the object is a graphic, 
the graphic may become distorted. To avoid changing the aspect ratio when resizing an object, hold down the 
Shift key as you drag a corner selection handle. Some object types maintain their aspect ratio automatically 
when you drag a corner selection handle, even if you do not hold down the Shift key.
To move an object, drag it with the mouse. You can position the mouse 
pointer over any part of the object and then drag. (Exception: If the 
object is a text box, you must drag it by any part of its border that is not 
near a selection handle.)

Saving, Opening, and Creating Files
Each application has similar procedures for working with data files. You 
can create, save, and open files in much the same way. In the following 
sections, you will learn the basic techniques for these operations.
Saving Files
As you work in an application, the content you create is stored in the 
computer’s memory. This memory is only temporary storage. When you 
exit the application or shut down the computer, whatever is stored in 
memory is flushed away forever—unless you save it.

Part II: Software
TIP
Ctrl+S is the keyboard shortcut for the Save command; Ctrl+N is the shortcut for the New command (to start 
a new file); and Ctrl+O is the shortcut for the Open command (to open an existing file).
Navigating the file system is the same in the Save and Open dialog boxes 
as it is in Windows Explorer, which you learned to use in Chapter 5. You 
can move between volumes and folders, select favorite locations from the 
Favorites list, and so on. Figure 7.16 points out the navigation controls 
in the Save As dialog box in Word, for example.
The steps for saving and opening data files are almost exactly the same in 
each application, so mastering it in one program gives you a head start in 
other programs.

Chapter 7: Understanding Microsoft Office 2010
Saving to the OneDrive Cloud
If you use Microsoft OneDrive (formerly called SkyDrive) for cloud 
storage, you can easily save to it directly from any Office application 
by using the OneDrive shortcut in the Favorites list in the Save As 
or Open dialog box. (If you don’t see a OneDrive shortcut there, go 
to https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download 
and download the utility for Windows 7 that integrates OneDrive with 
Windows Explorer.)
Put It to Work
Step by Step
Saving a File for the First Time
Use these steps the first time you save a new file:
	 1.	Click the File tab and click Save, or click the Save icon on the QAT.
	 2.	In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the desired location, as shown in Figure 7.16.
	 3.	Type the desired filename in the File name box.
	 4.	(Optional) Change the file type if desired.
	 5.	Click Save.
Re-Saving a File Subsequent Times (Same Settings)
Do the following to save a file again using the same settings:
	 1.	Click the File tab.
	 2.	Click Save, or click the Save icon on the QAT. The file is immediately saved with the same settings as before.

Re-Saving a File Subsequent Times (Different Settings)
Follow these steps to save another copy of an existing file in a different location, or with a different name, or with a 
­different file type:
	 1.	Click the File tab and click Save As.
	 2.	In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the desired location.
	 3.	Type the desired file name in the File name box.
	 4.	(Optional) Change the file type if desired.
	 5.	Click Save.
Understanding Data Formats
Each application has its own data formats, summarized in Table 7.2. 
When you save a file, you can open the File type drop-down list and 
select a file format.
TIP
When you don’t have a reason to do otherwise, use the native file format for an application (the one where 
the extension ends in “x”). The resulting files are smaller and you ensure that you have access to the full set 
of application features that way. Some program features aren’t supported in backward-compatible file formats, 
and you won’t be able to use them (or save them) in a backward-compatible file.
Each application’s native format is the default format in which new 
content is saved. Each application also has a macro-enabled option, for 
files that contain macros. (Most don’t.) Making the general format non-
macro-enabled cuts down on the risk of spreading macro viruses. Each 
application can also save and open files from earlier versions for backward 
compatibility. (Use the format that has 97-2003 in its name.)

Opening and Closing Files
To open an existing file, click the File tab and click Open and then make 
your selection in the Open dialog box, after navigating to the location 
where the file is stored. After you have created a file and saved it, you can 
reopen the file to review or edit it.
Password-Protecting Files
You can password-protect an Office application’s data 
file as you save it. To do so, from the Save As dialog 
box, click the Tools button, and then choose General 
Options from the menu. In the dialog box that appears, 
you can assign a password to the file. There are two 
password prompts: Password to Open and Password 
to Modify. The former allows read-only access; the user 
cannot save changes back to the same file. The latter 
enables changes to be saved. You can assign two differ-
ent passwords to allow some people one type of access 
and others the other type.
Privacy and Security
NOTE
You can open files when you are not already in an application. In Windows Explorer you can double-click a 
data file to open it in its native application.
If you want to open a recently used file, there’s a quicker method. After 
clicking the File tab, click Recent, and then click the shortcut for one of 
the recently used files that appear on the list, as shown in Figure 7.17.
When you are finished with a file, you can close it by clicking the File tab 
and then clicking Close. Closing a file frees up some of your computer’s 
memory for other uses. When you exit the application, all open files are 
automatically closed, and you are prompted to save any unsaved changes 
to them.

	 2.	 How can you quickly reopen a recently used file?
	 3.	 How do you close an open document without exiting the application?
Printing and Sharing Files
Each application has a similar Print function that you can use to gener-
ate hard copies of your work. You can also share your work electronically 
with others by sending it to people via email.
Printing a File
To print a file, first set it up the way you want it in the application, 
including hiding or collapsing any content you don’t want to show, set-
ting font sizes and spacing, and so on. Then click the File tab and click 
Print, and make your selections of the options that appear.
The options are slightly different in each application; Figure 7.18 points 
out some of the common features. You can choose which printer to use, 
the number of copies to print, whether those copies should be collated, 
what page orientation to use, and more.

In the Pages text box, you can specify certain page numbers to print. To 
print individual pages, separate the numbers by commas, like this: 1, 3, 7. 
To print a range, use a hyphen, like this: 3-6. Other print options may be 
available, depending on the application; click the Print All Pages button 
to open a menu.
The largest portion of the Print screen consists of a Preview pane, on 
which you can see the document exactly as it will be printed. Use the 
arrow buttons below the preview to move between pages. If you don’t 
like the preview, click any other tab to return to normal viewing and fix 
the document as needed before you print.

Sending a File as an Email Attachment
In your email software, you can attach files to your outgoing messages, 
but you can also attach and send files directly from within Office applica-
tions, without opening your email software separately. You can send a file 
in its native format (for example, docx for Word, pptx for PowerPoint, 
and so on), or you can choose to send it in some other format, such as 
PDF. When the recipient gets your attached file, he or she can double-
click it to open it in whatever application is associated with that file type 
on his or her PC.
NOTE
PDF (Portable Document Format) is a page layout format that is platform-independent; people often use it 
to send files to people who may not have the appropriate software to open the file in the application in which 
it was originally created. Sending a file as a PDF also makes it harder for others to make changes to the file, 
so it is useful for sending contracts and other official documents for review. XPS is the Microsoft equivalent of 
PDF. Office 2010 applications can save and send in either PDF or XPS.
Step by Step
Sending a File via Email
Follow these steps to send a file as an email attachment:
	 1.	With the file open in its Office application, click the File tab and click Save & Send.
	 2.	In the center pane, click Send Using Email.
	 3.	In the right pane, click the appropriate button to indicate the way you want the file sent. To send it in its native 
format, choose Send as Attachment.

Summary
Understanding the Office 2010 Interface
The Ribbon is the large, multi-tabbed toolbar at the top of each Office application window. It 
contains tabs (pages) of commands. Commands are organized in groups on each tab. A dialog 
box launcher, found in some groups, opens a dialog box related to that group.
When you click the File tab, Backstage view opens, which contains multiple categories in a 
navigation bar along the left side. Click a category to see a page of options relating to file manage-
ment. The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) is the small, customizable toolbar that appears above 
the Ribbon. When you right-click, a context-sensitive shortcut menu appears, from which you 
can select commands relating to what you right-clicked.
When you hover the mouse over a button, a ScreenTip appears explaining its name and purpose. 
Some ScreenTips contain keyboard shortcut prompts too. The status bar appears at the bottom 
of the application’s window. Zoom controls adjust the magnification at which you see your work. 
Zoom controls appear on the right end of the status bar and also on the View tab.
Basic Features of Office Applications
To open the Help system in an application, press F1, or choose Help from the File menu, or click 
the Help icon in the upper-right corner of the application window.
To scroll in the document, use the scroll bars. You can drag the scroll box, or click above or 
below the scroll box, or click one of the scroll arrows.
To select content, drag across it with the mouse, or click where you want the selection to begin and 
hold down Shift as you click at the other end, or use the arrow keys to extend the selection area.
The Office Clipboard is like the Windows Clipboard except it has more features, and is available 
only in Office applications. It can hold up to 24 items.
Undo reverses the last action. Use the Undo button on the QAT or press Ctrl+Z. Redo reverses 
the reversal; press Ctrl+Y or use the Redo button on the QAT.
The insertion point is where text you type will appear. You can move it by clicking where you 
want it. In Excel, a cell cursor, a thick line around a cell, indicates that it is active, and text you 
type will be placed in it.
Office files can have themes applied, which are sets of formatting presets. They consist of font, 
color, and graphic effect choices. You can also apply each of those separately (color theme, font 
theme, effect theme). When you choose colors, you select from a color palette that contains 
theme colors, variants of theme colors, and standard colors.
A framed object within an Office document is called an object. Objects can include charts, graph-
ics, and text boxes. Drag a selection handle on an object to resize it, or drag the object itself to 
move it. Drag the border to move a text box.
Saving, Opening, and Creating Files
To save a file, use the Save command on the File menu. The first time you save a file, you are 
prompted for a name, location, and type in the Save As dialog box. When you save subsequent 
times, you are not prompted. If you want to be prompted, use the Save As command instead.

To open a file, use the Open command on the File menu. Navigate to the location of the file in 
the same way you do in Windows Explorer. To close a file, use the Close command.
Printing and Sharing Files
To print your work, open the File menu and click Print. Then use the controls that appear to 
specify the options for the print job.
You can email a file to others in native format, or in PDF or XPS format. These are both page 
layout formats that people can read even if they do not have the original applications.

More Keyboard Shortcuts
Each application has an extensive set of keyboard shortcuts available. Open the application’s Help 
system and search for Keyboard Shortcuts to see an article that lists the complete set. There are 
separate sets of shortcuts for various situations. For example, there are shortcuts for moving the 
insertion point, shortcuts for scrolling, shortcuts for selecting, shortcuts for commands, and so on.
Can’t get enough of working with the keyboard? Each Ribbon tab and command has a keyboard 
equivalent too. To see them, press the Alt key, as shown in Figure 7.20. Key tips appear next to 
each tab and command name. Then press that key to choose that command. (You have to press 
Alt each time to use these shortcuts.) This is how people who can’t use a mouse navigate in Office 
applications, by the way.

For example, in Word, you can set default behaviors for cutting, copying, and pasting data, and in 
PowerPoint you can disable right-clicking during a slide show as a security measure to keep people 
from stopping a slide show at an interactive kiosk.

Learning objectives
◽	 Identify communications networks in daily life
◽	 Distinguish among types of networks
◽	 Identify common types of network hardware
◽	 Understand the Internet and choose a connection method
When computing first began, each computer was separate, and data was moved 
between computers only with difficulty. Today, however, computers connect to 
both local and global networks that make information sharing easy, whether you’re 
sharing data with your brother’s computer in the next room or with a file server 
halfway around the world.
This chapter explains the basics of modern networking, both large and small 
networks, both wired and wireless, and both private and public. You will learn how 
networks are structured, how network resources are identified, and how network 
security helps keep your data safe. You’ll also learn how to troubleshoot some 
common network-related problems.
Our Connected World: Communication 
Systems
Networking is everywhere, and many of our everyday activities are enabled or 
assisted by computer networking, even the activities that might not on the sur-
face seem to have anything to do with it. For example, when you withdraw funds 
at your local bank branch, the bank verifies your account balance on the bank’s 
main server at the home office. When you buy an item at your local discount chain

store, and you pay for your purchase with a credit card, the cash regis-
ter’s software checks a credit card verification server to make sure your 
card is valid before charging your purchase. It then sends the informa-
tion to the store’s internal inventory management system via the local 
network. The local server then sends an updated inventory report to the 
company’s web server, so that someone ordering from the store’s website 
will know that the item is no longer in stock. When you call your mother 
on your cell phone on the way home to tell her about your purchase, 
your call goes through the wireless network for your cell phone provider.
Let’s start out this chapter by looking at some of the large-scale networks 
that make up our connected world.
Public Telephone and Data Networks
The first worldwide network ever created was the telephone network, 
predating computers by many decades. This network is an example 
of a circuit-switched network. It works by creating a point-to-point 
circuit between the two locations. The telephone network creates a 
pathway between the two points, and that pathway remains open for 
the duration of the phone call. Networks can be public or private. The 
public telephone system—the whole of the world’s circuit-switched 
telephone networks—is known as the public-switched telephone 
network (PSTN).
In contrast, computer networks are packet-switched networks. A com-
munication channel does not remain open between two points for an 
entire conversation; instead, the data is broken up at the sending end 
into small packets, each with an electronic envelope around it that states 
the source and the destination, and sent individually to the receiver. 
Depending on the network traffic, each packet may take a different route 
to the destination, but when they arrive they are unpacked and reassem-
bled into the original message.
The Internet
The Internet is the world’s largest network. It is not owned or main-
tained by any one company; instead, it is a cooperative effort among 
many companies and governments, with multiple standards organizations 
managing the rules for its operation. The Internet is a packet-switched 
network with a worldwide addressing system. The Internet uses vari-
ous protocols (rules) that all participating computers have standardized 
on, so that services like the web, email, and instant messaging work the 
same everywhere. Most companies and individuals don’t connect directly 
to the Internet; instead, they connect to an Internet service provider 
(ISP), which in turn connects to the Internet. For example, if you have 
cable Internet at home, your ISP is your cable provider.
The Internet is based on a protocol stack (a set of protocols) called 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/
IP provides a common set of standards by which data can be sent and 
received. It is used not only on the Internet, but in most private net-
works today as well. One of the key features of TCP/IP is IP addressing, 
which is a means of uniquely identifying each connected computer on 
the network by a numeric value.
circuit-switched network A network that 
creates a point-to-point connection between 
locations that remains open for the duration of the 
communication.
public switched telephone network 
(PSTN) The worldwide network of circuit-switched 
telephone lines.
packet-switched network A network that 
transfers data by breaking it up into separately 
transferred packets.
Internet A global packet-switched network 
created cooperatively by multiple companies, 
governments, and standards organizations.
protocol A rule or custom that governs how 
something is done. In a computer context, it refers 
to a standard for transferring data.
Internet service provider (ISP) A company 
that maintains a direct connection to the Internet 
and leases access to it to individuals and 
companies.
protocol stack A related group of protocols—for 
example, TCP/IP.
TCP/IP The protocol suite (set of rules) that 
defines how data will move on the Internet and on 
most other modern networks.

Chapter 8: Networking and Internet Basics
Private Digital Networks
Many companies maintain high-speed connections between their loca-
tions. They can do so by leasing a line, running their own cables, or 
using the existing pathways of the Internet. Using the Internet is the 
most cost-effective method, but not the most reliable method, because 
the connection can be affected by Internet traffic problems and connec-
tions that other companies control and maintain.
Using the Internet is also not very secure; it’s an open system and data 
being sent and received can easily be snooped. To tighten the security 
when using the Internet as a conduit, many companies use a software 
technology called virtual private networking (VPN). VPN technol-
ogy creates a secure, tamper-resistant data tunnel between two points 
on the Internet, so that sensitive information can be exchanged securely, 
as in Figure 8.1. A VPN allows an employee who is working outside of 
the company’s main building to connect to any of the internal network 
resources, just as if he or she were in the building.
Figure 8.1  A VPN creates a secure connection between two points using the Internet’s 
infrastructure to physically carry the data.
Satellite Data Networks
A satellite is a transmitter/receiver unit that orbits the Earth, more 
than 22,000 miles up. Satellites are in geosynchronous orbit (that is, 
their orbit is synchronized with the Earth’s orbit), so they do not appear 
to change in position compared to any location on Earth. A satellite 
contains transponders, which are two-way radios that communicate with 
stations on the ground. Satellites are used to quickly send information 
between two points on Earth that are physically separated by a great dis-
tance. For example, when the Olympics are held in one country, satellites 
are used to broadcast the video of each competition nearly instantly to 
every other country. Satellites are also used for services like satellite radio 
(Sirius/XM, for example) and satellite TV broadcasts such as DirecTV 
and Dish Network (see Figure 8.2). Some Internet services also use satel-
lites to provide Internet access to areas where other high-speed connec-
tion technologies are not available.

of creating a secure, private communication tunnel 
using a public communications channel such as 
the Internet.

Figure 8.2  Satellites can be used for broadband communications.
Cell Phone Networks
Cellular telephone companies have their own data networks, using a 
combination of satellites, cables, and on-ground towers with transmitters 
and receivers on them. Calls connect to the cell tower that is closest to 
the phone’s current location, 
and that cell tower then taps 
into the larger telecommunica-
tions network via satellites and 
cables.
Some cell phone networks 
can also be used to access the 
Internet (see Figure 8.3). You 
can access the Internet on a 
smartphone (a cell phone 
that includes computer func-
tionality), and you can tether 
(connect) a smartphone to a 
computer and use the phone as 
a modem to allow the computer 
Internet access.

puter applications and Internet access capability.

Tethering a Computer to a 
Smartphone for Internet Access
If your phone has Internet access, you can probably share 
its Internet access with a notebook or tablet computer. 
The exact steps depend on you phone’s operating system. 
On an iPhone, the feature is called Personal Hotspot. On 
a Windows Phone, it’s called Internet sharing. On Android, 
it’s called Tethering & Portable Hotspot. Check out your 
phone now and see whether that feature is available. It’s 
not cost-effective as a long-term Internet access solution, 
but it works great when you don’t have other access avail-
able, such as in a car or boat.

Ways of Classifying Networks
As you learned in the previous section, the world is full of networks of 
various types. Most of the rest of this chapter, however, focuses specifi-
cally on networks that help personal and business computers connect 
with one another.
There are several ways to classify computer networks. You can look at 
them according to their geographical scope, the way the network is phys-
ically laid out, the way data travels through the network, and whether 
the network is wired (that is, connected with cables) or wireless. In the 
following sections, you will look at networks in several of these ways.
Geographical Range
One way to classify networks is according to the geographical range that 
they cover, from a few feet within a single person’s office to a huge area 
that covers multiple countries or even multiple continents. Figure 8.4 
provides a graphical explanation of some of these ranges.
Figure 8.4  The geographical range of linked devices determines the type of network that 
connects them.

Personal Area Networks
A personal area network (PAN) consists of devices that directly con-
nect to a single computer. For example, if you are showing a presentation 
in a conference room during a business meeting, you might connect your 
notebook PC to the projector in the room. You might also form a PAN 
by connecting your smartphone to your computer.
Local Area Networks
A local area network (LAN) is a network in which all the devices are 
located within the same physical location, such as a single building or 
a group of adjacent buildings. A key characteristic of a LAN is that it is 
contained within a relatively small area. For example, your home network 
is a LAN, and so is the network at your school.
Metropolitan Area Networks
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans an entire 
town or city—or, as the name implies, a metropolitan area that might 
span a major city and its suburbs. A city might invest in a network infra-
structure, for example, and then businesses and individuals within that 
area might sign up to use the network.
Wide Area Networks 
A wide area network (WAN) is a geographically dispersed network, 
usually consisting of at least two LANs connected together by an exter-
nal link. A business or college with multiple separate campuses might link 
all the individual LANs together to form a WAN, for example. A WAN 
is not necessarily managed by a single organization and may include 
architecture and communications hardware from several different service 
providers. In this sense, the Internet is a form of global WAN.
Peer-to-Peer and Client/Server Networks
Another way to classify networks is to look at whether or not a server is 
involved in their management. As you learned in Chapter 1, “Computer 
Basics,” a server is a computer that is dedicated to providing network 
and sharing services to the other computers on the network. Very small 
networks (10 computers or fewer) can get by without a server by operat-
ing as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, also called a workgroup. In a P2P 
network, each computer shares in the administrative burden of maintain-
ing the network, as shown in Figure 8.5. Each computer is responsible 
for authenticating other users who want to share its resources (files and 
printers) and for making those resources available. A P2P network slows 
down each computer slightly because of the overhead involved in the 
network. It is not usually noticeable with just a few computers, but the 
more computers there are, the greater the slowdown.
personal area network (PAN) A network 
formed when devices are connected to an indi-
vidual computer.
local area network (LAN) A network that 
connects devices housed in the same physical 
location.
metropolitan area network (MAN) A 
network that connects devices within the area of 
a city or town.
wide area network (WAN) A network that 
spans at least two geographical locations; a busi-
ness with two or more offices may have a LAN at 
each site but use a WAN to connect them all to 
the same network.
peer-to-peer (P2P) network A network that 
consists only of clients (no servers).

Figure 8.5  Every computer shares administrative responsibilities on peer-to-peer networks, 
which have no servers.
For larger networks, a client/server model is more effective. A client/
server network, such as the one shown in Figure 8.6, is a network that 
consists of one or more servers plus one or more clients—that is, com-
puters with which individuals run applications. Client/server networks 
can be any size and can have multiple servers. Each server may perform a 
different type of network task, such as a file server or a print server. Each 
server may also serve a subset of the total pool of clients.

Intranets and Extranets
Some organizations have a part of the network that can only be accessed 
from within the organization. This sub-network is known as an intranet. 
The network administrator may enable intranet users to share message 
board items, link to external web pages, and comment on photos or 
news items that are posted. The intranet cannot be accessed by anyone 
outside the organization and can’t be accessed when staff are not physi-
cally located in the office unless they are given specific permission for 
remote access.
In contrast, a company may maintain an extranet, a separate network 
that is specifically intended for people outside the organization. An 
extranet may be used by the company’s business partners, contract 
employees, or customers to get real-time information, such as about 
products it supplies that might soon need restocking.
Ethernet
Over the years since networking began, there have been several popular 
networking technologies—that is, different sets of standards for net-
working hardware and software. All of those technologies have become 
obsolete except Ethernet. Most network hardware that you buy in 
stores today can be assumed to be Ethernet-compatible unless it specifies 
otherwise.
Ethernet can technically be either wired or wireless, but it is becoming 
increasingly common to refer to only the wired type as Ethernet; wireless 
Ethernet is popularly called Wi-Fi. (See the following section for more 
information about Wi-Fi.)
Wireless Networking Technologies
A network can connect devices using either wired or wireless connec-
tions. A wired connection runs a cable between the points, whereas wire-
less connects the two points via radio frequency (RF) or infrared.
Wireless communications have two main uses. The first use is at the 
endpoints of network connectivity, where a device such as a smartphone 
or laptop computer connects wirelessly to a router or other device that 
provides network and/or Internet access. The second use is as a source 
of transferring data between locations when using cables is not practical, 
such as with satellite and microwave systems.
intranet A special network that only staff within 
the company network can access. For security 
reasons, an intranet can only be accessed onsite 
and not remotely.
extranet A special network set up by a business 
for its customers, staff, and business partners to 
access from outside the office network; may be 
used to share marketing assets and other non-
sensitive items.
Ethernet The current dominant standard for local 
area networking devices.
NOTE
A single network can contain a mixture of wired and wireless connections, as long as they are the same 
network technology. For example, if you have a router in your home through which all the computers share an 
Internet connection, some of the computers can connect to it with wired Ethernet and others can connect to 
it via Wi-Fi. Because they all share a common network technology (Ethernet), they work together seamlessly. 
However, networks using different technologies cannot communicate with one another. For example, you can’t 
use a Bluetooth device to connect to an Ethernet network.

Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity. It’s the common name for the wire-
less networking technology that’s used for almost all home and business 
networks today, often referred to by its standard number: IEEE 802.11. 
Whenever you use wireless networking to access the Internet at your 
home or workplace or in a public location such as a cafe or library, you 
are using Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi (Wireless Ethernet) A means of con-
necting computers and other devices wirelessly. 
Another name for it is IEEE 802.11, its technical 
standard.
NOTE
IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It publishes the standards for many different 
technologies. IEEE 802.11 is the standard that governs Wi-Fi, but there are also many other standards. For 
example, 1394 is the standard for FireWire, and 802.15 is the standard for Bluetooth (although nobody calls 
Bluetooth by its standard number).
There have been different versions of the Wi-Fi standard since its 
original development. The popular version today is 802.11n, which can 
carry up to 600 Mbps of data over a range of up to 230 feet indoors or 
840 feet outdoors. An update to it called 802.11ac has recently been 
approved; it may already be incorporated into networking devices you 
can buy in stores by the time you read this. 802.11ac has a maximum 
throughput of 1.3 Gbps, more than doubling the capacity of 802.11n. 
Table 8.1 lists the different Wi-Fi standards and their speeds and 
distances.

Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology used to connect individual devices to 
one another in close proximity. It is most commonly used to connect a 
computer to an input or output device. For example, you might have a 
Bluetooth headphone that you use with your smartphone, or you might 
have a Bluetooth-enabled printer that you can use with your notebook 
PC. A personal area network (PAN) forms when the devices are within 
range of each other and they are paired (by using software to authen-
ticate them to one another). When the devices are no longer in range 
of one another, the PAN stops. Bluetooth is limited to about 20 feet in 
range, so it isn’t a practical technology to use for wireless networking in 
general (such as to share an Internet connection with computers all over 
a home or office).
Bluetooth An inexpensive short-range network-
ing technology used for computer-to-device 
connections such as computer-to-printer or 
phone-to-headset

to a computer.

Put It to Work
Pairing Bluetooth Devices
To connect devices via Bluetooth, 
you must pair them. Pairing can 
take several different forms, 
depending on the devices. For 
example, one device might gener-
ate a PIN code, and the other one 
might prompt you to type that PIN 
code to confirm. Obviously, that 
works only if both devices have 
a display screen on which a PIN 
code could display. For a device 
without a display, such as a 
Bluetooth mouse, the device will 
have a button you can press to 
make it temporarily discoverable. 
Press the button (you may have 
to hold it for a few seconds), 
following the directions in the 
device’s documentation to make it discoverable, and then select it on the screen of the device with which you want 
to pair it. In Windows, you can access the Bluetooth controls via the Control Panel.
Infrared
Infrared technology uses light waves to “beam” information from device 
to device. Infrared was the method of choice for connecting wireless 
peripherals a decade or so ago, but Bluetooth has mainly superseded it 
today. However, infrared is still used for most remote controls for TVs and 
other home theater components. The main drawback of infrared trans-
mission is that it must have a clear line of sight between the two points. 
The standard for an infrared connection is IrDA (short for Infrared Data 
Association, the organization that created and manages the standard).
Microwave
Microwaves are high-frequency radio waves. A microwave communica-
tion system allows two locations to be wirelessly connected by using a 
high-frequency communication band, much higher than that used for 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The points can be miles apart (up to about 25 miles), 
but as long as there are no visible obstructions between them, they can 
exchange data. Because line of sight is so critical for microwave communi-
cations, the transmitters are often placed high up on towers or buildings. 
Microwave technology is not as widely used today as it was prior to the 
development of satellite networking systems, but it still has some special 
uses; for example, military forces use it to quickly set up communications 
in areas where the terrain is too rugged to support wired connections and 
security is critical. (A point-to-point microwave connection is more secure 
than a connection that goes through a satellite.)
infrared Older type of wireless communication 
that used light waves to pass simple information 
between nearby devices.
microwave communication system A 
secure, point-to-point wireless networking technol-
ogy that requires a line of sight between the two 
points.

Network Installer
Technicians who install networks have an active work environment. 
Rather than sitting at a desk all day, as most IT professionals do, 
installers are out crawling around in the attics and basements of 
buildings, running cables and mounting satellite dishes. They set up 
closets with stacks of switches and routers in them, configure network 
security settings, and make sure all network hardware is installed 
correctly and functioning well. To install networks, you should have 
at least a high school diploma, plus a technical certification such 
as CompTIA Network+. To learn more about Network+ certification, 
see http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/
certifications/network.aspx.
Careers in IT
Network Hardware
Network connectivity requires both hardware and software. The software 
portion is handled by the operating system; all modern operating systems 
include network support. However, not all computers include network-
ing hardware, and some network hardware is independent of any one 
computer, so you may at some point find yourself shopping for network-
ing hardware. In the following sections, you will learn about several 
common network hardware devices.

Network Adapters
Each network client device (computer, tablet, printer, and so on) must 
have a network adapter. A network adapter enables the computer 
to participate in the local area network. Most desktop and notebook 
computers come with a wired Ethernet adapter built in, and notebook 
computers almost always include a built-in wireless adapter as well.
When a network adapter is not built into the motherboard, but instead 
installed as an expansion board, it is called a network interface card 
(NIC). Although it is not technically accurate, the term NIC (pro-
nounced “nick”) has come to refer to any network adapter, not just 
an add-on card. Most portable computers (notebooks, tablets, smart-
phones) have a Wi-Fi network adapter built in. A portable device may 
also have other built-in network adapters, such as a Bluetooth adapter.
network adapter A hardware component that 
enables a computer to connect to a network.

adapter that is on an expansion card, rather than 
built into the computer’s motherboard. Sometimes

Part III: Connectivity and Communication
You can configure a device’s network adapter via the Settings or Control 
Panel in the operating system. You can turn the various wireless adapters 
on or off on a tablet or smartphone, for instance. Many people choose 
to keep Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned off to save battery life when those 
adapters are not being used.
Step by Step
Checking Device Manager for Network Devices
Not sure what network adapters are installed on your PC? Follow these steps to find out:
	 1.	In Windows, click Start and click Control Panel.
	 2.	Click Hardware and Sound.
	 3.	Click Device Manager. The Device Manager window 
opens.
	 4.	Click the arrow to the left of Network Adapters to 
expand that category. The available network adapt-
ers appear. Four network adapters are shown here.  
You can deduce from their names what kind of 
networks they support.
	 5.	Double-click the network adapter with Ethernet in 
its name. Its Properties dialog box appears.
	 6.	Click each of the tabs in the dialog box to review 
its settings and then click Cancel.
	 7.	Close the Device Manager window, and close the 
Control Panel window.
Each network adapter has a hardware address, called a media access 
control (MAC) address, that is unique in all the world. The MAC 
address is separate from the network-specific address, such as the IP 
address (covered in Chapter 10, “Web Basics”).
Switches and Hubs
A switch is a box that provides a central gathering point for all the com-
puters in an Ethernet LAN. Each computer’s network adapter connects 
to the switch, either via a cable or wirelessly. (Bluetooth and infrared 
wireless networks don’t use switches because they only connect individ-
ual devices to one another, not groups of devices.) The switch manages 
the data traffic between the devices. A wireless switch is called a wireless 
access point (WAP).
media access control (MAC) address A 
unique hardware address for a network adapter.
switch A gathering point for the computers in a 
LAN to connect with to participate in the network.
wireless access point (WAP) A wireless

Chapter 8: Networking and Internet Basics
An earlier version of a switch, called a hub, was not so intelligent. Rather 
than sending the message only to the correct port, it would send all traf-
fic to all ports and rely on each computer to ignore anything that wasn’t 
addressed to it.
Routers
A router performs all the same functions as a switch, but it also has an 
added bonus: It can direct traffic into and out of the LAN. For example, 
suppose you have two separate groups of computers, each group con-
nected to its own switch, and you want their computers to be able to 
communicate with one another. If you use a router instead of a switch 
for each group, the routers will be able to transfer data packets that 
belong to the other group.
Routers serve an important role in home networks because they enable 
multiple computers to share a single Internet connection. The broad-
band modem connects to the router’s output port, and the router directs 
all Internet requests from each of the computers to that port. When data 
comes in from the Internet, the router directs it to the computer that 
requested it. The type of router used for this purpose is sometimes called 
a broadband router. A broadband router can be wired or wireless.
Repeaters
A repeater does just what the name implies—it repeats a network 
signal. As network traffic travels a long distance, the signal weakens and 
errors may be introduced. A repeater reads the incoming data and then 
rebroadcasts it.
Network Cables
Wired communication media consists mainly of various types of cables. 
Data can be carried efficiently and reliably through cables, and some 
cables can carry data at very high speeds. Here are the most common 
types of network cables you may encounter.
◾	 Twisted-pair cable gets its name from the pairs of copper wires 
inside the cable. Most of the Ethernet cables in business and resi-
dential buildings are twisted-pair cable. The wires twisting around 
each other help reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) 
caused by the magnetic field generated when electricity passes 
through the cable.
◾	 Most twisted-pair cable is unshielded-twisted pair (UTP). 
Shielding is an optional copper mesh in the lining of a cable that 
cuts down on EMI getting through to the cable from external 
sources. Shielded-twisted pair (STP) contains this extra lining, 
and is used in environments where EMI is a problem, such as in 
cables run through ceilings with fluorescent light fixtures in them.
hub A primitive version of a switch that lacks the 
capability to read packet addresses and route 
them to the appropriate port.
router A connection box for Ethernet networks 
that physically joins the devices in the network 
(wired) or provides wireless connectivity (wireless), 
and enables a connection to an outside network 
such as the Internet.
repeater A device that receives and retransmits 
a network signal.
twisted-pair cable Cable that transfers data 
via pairs of copper wires that are twisted around 
each other to reduce electromagnetic interference.
electromagnetic interference (EMI) The 
corruption of data as it is passing through a cable 
due to the magnetic field generated by a nearby 
cable.
unshielded twisted pair (UTP) A type of 
twisted-pair cable that does not have an outer 
sheath that protects against external EMI.
shielded twisted pair (STP) A type of 
twisted-pair cable that has an outer sheath that 
protects against external EMI.

◾	 Coaxial cable 
is the type of 
cable used 
for cable TV 
connections; if 
you have cable 
Internet, it’s 
the cable that 
runs from the 
wall to your 
cable modem. 
Like twisted-
pair cable, it 
carries data in 
electrical signals. It’s a more expensive cable than twisted pair, but 
it can carry much more data and at faster speeds. Coaxial cable con-
sists of a single copper wire in the center, surrounded by insulation, 
with a plastic jacket on the outside. See Figure 8.7. Coaxial cable 
is not normally used for networking within a building anymore, 
although some older, now-obsolete forms of networking used it.
◾	 Fiber optic 
cable carries 
data in pulses 
of light along a 
glass fiber (see 
Figure 8.8). 
Each fiber is 
very tiny—
about the 
thickness of a 
human hair. 
Each cable 
contains hun-
dreds of fibers, 
and can carry 
billions of bits 
per second. 
Fiber optic cable is often used as the backbone (the central part) of 
a network, to move large amounts of data between points on the 
Internet. It’s reliable, fast, and very hard to snoop or hack into, 
making the connection very secure. Fiber optic cable isn’t widely 
used at the consumer level, though, because it is expensive and 
difficult to install and maintain. It’s also not compatible with most 
consumer-level networking equipment.

Understanding and Connecting 
to the Internet
The Internet began as a way of enabling research institutions and the 
military to share information. Today, however, it is the largest and 
most-used network in the world, and it is used not only by schools and 
governments but by businesses, non-profit organizations, and individu-
als in every country and of every profession. You can use the Internet 
to look up information on the web, send and receive email, exchange 
instant messages, upload and download files, and much more. You 
will learn more about the uses of the Internet in Chapter 9, “Online 
Communication,” and Chapter 10, “Web Basics.”
Internet Structure
Structurally, the Internet is a mesh of routers and servers connected to 
one another at multiple points, as illustrated in Figure 8.9. This makes 
the Internet very fault-tolerant. If any single router or server goes down, 
network traffic is simply routed around the point of failure.
© iStockphoto.com/iSergey
Figure 8.9  A mesh network does not rely on any one point being active; traffic  
can easily route around any blockages.
Internet Speed
The Internet itself does not have a fixed speed. Data travels through the 
Internet as fast as it can go on whatever cable it travels through, and a 
single data packet may travel at different speeds during different parts 
of its journey. At the heart of the Internet are high-capacity, high-speed 
data pathways that are like superhighways for data. These pathways form 
the Internet’s backbone. The backbone is made up mainly of fiber optic 
cables that can carry data very fast—literally at the speed of light! Large 
ISPs have entire buildings full of servers that are connected directly to 
the Internet off of this main backbone. From the ISP’s servers to the 
individual neighborhoods and individual homes and businesses, the con-
nection speeds are lower because the cheaper copper-based cables used in 
those areas carry data at a lower rate. Some ISPs charge different prices

for different speeds of Internet connection, and they throttle the connec-
tion speed (usually at the broadband modem) for customers who have 
signed up for a slower connection.
The Internet service that you subscribe to has two speeds, both mea-
sured in megabytes per second (Mbps). The first is its theoretical maxi-
mum speed, which is what your ISP tells you that it is delivering under 
optimal conditions. The second is your actual speed, which will be lower.

Types of Internet Connections
When choosing Internet service for your home or business, there are 
a variety of factors to consider. Speed is important, of course—faster is 
better. However, faster may also be more expensive. It’s also important 
to look at availability, and evaluate any package deals you may be able to 
get with other services such as cable TV or phone service.
In the following sections, you’ll learn about the major types of Internet 
connections available to consumers today. All of these types except dial-
up are always-on broadband connections. The word broadband literally 
means wide path, but when referring to Internet connectivity it refers to 
a connection with a speed higher than 256 Kbps. Many of today’s broad-
band Internet options are much faster than that.
broadband A fast, always-on network connection.

Chapter 8: Networking and Internet Basics
Dial-Up Internet 
In the early days of the Internet, dial-up access was all that was avail-
able. A dial-up connection uses a telephone line to connect to an ISP at 
a maximum speed of around 44.8 Kbps. Dial-up connections have many 
drawbacks. You cannot use the phone line for telephone calls while you 
are connected to the Internet, and the Internet connection is not always 
on; you must connect to the Internet when you want to use it, and 
then disconnect when you are finished. The speed is very slow (less than 
1/100th of a more modern connection, on the average), resulting in 
frustrating waits for every operation. A dial-up connection is established 
using a dial-up modem.
Cable Internet
At the other end of the speed spectrum from dial-up is cable Internet 
access. Cable is currently the fastest type of commercially available 
Internet access for residential customers, theoretically delivering top 
speeds of up to 30 Mbps (although most connections top out at around 
20 Mbps).
Cable Internet is delivered through the same coaxial cable as the cable 
TV programming. You connect a splitter to the cable coming in from the 
wall, to allow the cable to go to both your TV and to a cable modem 
(which may be provided by the cable company for a monthly lease fee).
You can also optionally share the Internet connection with other com-
puters in your home or office by using a broadband router. Some cable 
modems are dual-purpose units, with a router built in. If you have one of 
these, you do not need a separate router.
DSL Internet
Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a high-speed Internet connection from 
your local land-based telephone company. DSL uses the same twisted-
pair cable to provide Internet that it does to provide voice service, with 
a splitter used to separate the data and voice signals so you can use them 
both at once. This type of DSL has a speed ranging from 256 Kbps to 
20 Mbps depending on the distance between the service address and the 
phone company’s connection box. It can also deliver high-definition TV 
and phone service, all on a single line.
Satellite Internet
Satellite Internet service uses the same communication satellites that 
you learned about earlier in this chapter. Satellite Internet service 
involves using a satellite dish for receiving and a satellite transmitter for 
sending data.
Satellite service is not likely to be anyone’s first choice as a broadband 
Internet connection. It is relatively slow (around 1 Mbps), and suf-
fers from significant latency (delay) issues that make it unsuitable for 
performance-sensitive online activities like videoconferencing and playing 
action-based games. However, satellite is available just about anywhere. 
When faced with the choice of dial-up modem connection or satellite, 
people who need a broadband connection will go with satellite.

analog and digital data so computer data can be 
sent over analog phone lines.

Internet over Cell Phone Networks
Modern cell phone network providers such as Verizon and AT&T not 
only offer telephone service, but also Internet service. This service is 
mainly offered to be used to access the Internet via smartphones, but it 
can also be used to connect other devices as well, such as tablets, note-
books, and even desktops to get Internet access in situations where Wi-Fi 
and other Internet connection methods are not available, such as when 
riding in an automobile.
Not all areas of cell phone networks worldwide have the appropriate 
technology and speed to access the Internet. There have been many 
different cell phone standards and technologies over the years, and it 
has only been recently, with the development of 3G, that cell phone 
networks have become fast enough to support Internet use. 3G, which 
stands for 3rd Generation, supports download speeds of up to 14 Mbps. 
An even newer and faster technology, 4G, can support up to 100 Mbps 
downloads. Cell phone companies provide coverage maps that show the 
areas in which they provide 3G or 4G service.
3G Digital technology for moving data through a

If your cell phone data plan is not unlimited, be aware of how much you are using the Internet via your cell 
phone, to avoid extra charges for going over your data limit. Your cell phone provider may have a website or a 
phone utility that enables you to see how much data you have used on the current billing cycle.

Summary
Our Connected World: Communication Systems
Networking is everywhere. A computer network is a packet-switched network, which sends and 
receives data in packets that may take different routes to the destination.
The Internet is the world’s largest network. It uses various standard protocols, so that services 
like the web and email work the same everywhere. Most companies don’t connect directly to the 
Internet; instead they connect to an Internet service provider (ISP).
The Internet is based on a protocol stack (a set of protocols) called Transmission Control 
Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP provides a common set of standards by which 
data can be sent and received. It is used not only on the Internet, but in most private networks 
today as well.
To tighten security when using the Internet as a conduit, many companies use a software technol-
ogy called virtual private networking (VPN). VPN technology creates a secure, tamper-resistant 
data tunnel between two points on the Internet.
A satellite is a transmitter/receiver unit that orbits the Earth, thousands of miles up. Satellite 
networks are used to deliver services such as TV and video broadcasts, satellite radio, and 
satellite Internet service. Cellular telephone companies have their own data networks, using a 
combination of satellites, cables, and on-ground towers with transmitters and receivers on them. 
Some cell phone networks can also be used to access the Internet. You can access the Internet on 
a smartphone (a cell phone that includes computer functionality), and you can tether (connect) a 
smartphone to a computer and use the phone as a modem to allow the computer Internet access.
Ways of Classifying Networks
There are several ways to classify computer networks. One way is according to the geographical 
range that they cover: personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), metropolitan 
area network (MAN), or wide area network (WAN). Another way is to look at whether or not 
a server is involved. In a peer-to-peer network, there is no server; in a client/server network, 
there is at least one server.
An intranet is a network accessible only from inside a company. An extranet is a network that is 
for the use of those outside the organization.
Ethernet is the most popular Internet technology, having outlived many competitors. Ethernet 
can be wired or wireless; the wireless version is also called Wi-Fi. Ethernet devices have a certain 
maximum speed.
A wired connection runs a cable between the points, whereas wireless connects the two points via 
radio frequency (RF) or infrared. Wi-Fi is short for wireless fidelity. It’s the common name for 
the wireless networking technology that’s used for almost all home and business networks today, 
often referred to by its standard number: IEEE 802.11. Bluetooth is a wireless technology used 
to connect individual devices to one another in close proximity. It is most commonly used to con-
nect a computer to an input or output device. When the devices are within range, they are paired. 
Infrared technology uses light waves to “beam” information from device to device. Infrared was 
the method of choice for connecting wireless peripherals a decade or so ago, but Bluetooth has 
mainly superseded it today. A microwave communication system allows two locations to be wire-
lessly connected by using a high-frequency communication band, much higher than that used for 
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

Network Hardware
A network adapter enables a computer to participate in the local area network. When a network 
adapter is not built into the motherboard, but instead installed as an expansion board, it is called 
a network interface card (NIC). Each network adapter has a hardware address, called a media 
access control (MAC) address, that is unique in all the world.
A switch is a box that provides a central gathering point for all the computers in an Ethernet 
LAN. A wireless switch is called a wireless access point (WAP). An earlier version of a switch, 
called a hub, was not so intelligent. A router performs all the same functions as a switch, but it 
also has an added bonus: It can direct traffic into and out of the LAN.
A repeater does just what the name implies—it repeats a network signal to strengthen it on its way 
to its destination.
Most of the Ethernet cables in business and residential buildings are twisted-pair cable. Most 
twisted-pair cable is unshielded twisted pair (UTP). Shielded twisted pair (STP) contains this 
extra lining. Coaxial cable is the type of cable used for cable TV connections. It is also used for 
some networking, such as delivering cable Internet to a home. Fiber optic cable carries data in 
pulses of light along a glass fiber.
Understanding and Connecting to the Internet
The Internet began as a way of enabling research institutions and the military to share infor-
mation. Structurally, the Internet is a mesh of routers and servers connected to one another at 
multiple points.
At the heart of the Internet are high-capacity, high-speed data pathways that are like superhigh-
ways for data. These pathways form the Internet’s backbone.
Types of Internet connections include dial-up and broadband. A dial-up connection is established 
using a dial-up modem. It is a very slow and inconvenient connection. Broadband connections 
are usually always on. Types of broadband connections include cable modem, digital subscriber 
line (DSL), satellite Internet, and cell phone networks.

Finding a Fast Internet Connection
Suppose a neighbor wanted to know what the best Internet connection available in your neighbor-
hood is. Use the Internet to research this topic, and find the fastest service available at your home 
address. Collect all the information you can about this service, including:
◾	 What company is providing it?
◾	 What is the advertised speed of the connection?
◾	 What connection technology does it use?
◾	 How much does it cost per month?
◾	 Are there any start-up costs involved?
Think It Over
Virtual Private Networking
With a VPN, a company can use the Internet to establish a secure communication channel 
between two points without going to the expense of leasing a data line. There are some people 
who say that it’s unfair, though, that large companies can use so much bandwidth, making the 
whole Internet run slower for everyone else, without paying for it. Do you agree? Do you think 
companies that transfer a large amount of data on an everyday basis should pay more, or should be 
forced to lease their own lines?
Metropolitan Area Networks
Suppose you are the mayor of a small town, and it has been suggested that the town install a 
metropolitan area network that will provide low-cost, high-speed Wi-Fi to all citizens who want 
it. Proponents say that it will encourage people to move to the town and will encourage highly 
educated young adults to stay in town instead of moving away. Opponents argue that the town 
will go into debt paying for such a system with no guarantee that enough people will sign up for 
the service to make it pay for itself. What questions would you want answered in order to help you 
make up your mind?

Learning objectives
◽	 Understand the channels available for Internet communications
◽	 Recognize the features of the different communication types
◽	 Choose the correct communication medium for a particular situation
◽	 Understand appropriate etiquette for online communication
◽	 Understand the basic features of email programs and how to use them
The way we communicate with friends and business associates has changed 
­dramatically in the last decade, thanks to the Internet. Our ­communication chan-
nels are increasingly shifting toward computer-assisted ­technologies, many of which 
are not only more immediate but also less expensive to use than the non-computer-
ized alternatives. For example, a business can save a great deal of money by sending 
its advertisements to customers by email rather than postal mail, and by meeting 
with clients through videoconferencing rather than having employees travel to the 
client site, and families can keep in touch using video chat services, as in Figure 9.1.
With all these new technologies for communication available, though, it can be 
a challenge to select the appropriate communication medium for a situation. In 
addition, each new form of communication comes with its own social conventions 
about the type of language to use, the format messages should take, and the appro-
priate level of formality. Whether or not you conform to these communication 
rules directly affects how well your message is received.
In this chapter, we will review the many different types of computer-assisted com-
munication technologies available in today’s world. You’ll learn about their pros 
and cons and accepted uses, and you’ll learn some of the etiquette rules and cus-
toms that will enable you to get your message across effectively.

Figure 9.1  The Internet has changed the way people communicate by offering 
­technologies such as video chatting, email, and instant messaging.
Internet Communication Types
The Internet in its original form was for the transfer of data between 
computers over a network. Email was one of the first Internet applica-
tions and is one of the most popular means of communication. Many 
more ways of communicating online are now available, including:
◾	 Instant messaging
◾	 Social networking
◾	 Blogs and microblogs
◾	 Newsgroups
◾	 Forums
◾	 Voice over IP (VoIP)
◾	 Video chat/videoconferencing
Many of these communication options require little more than a web 
connection and a username and password for the particular service. This 
chapter explains how some of these systems work and helps you choose 
appropriate communications tools.
Email
Email (short for electronic mail) is the computer equivalent of postal 
mail. Billions of email messages are exchanged every day through a 
worldwide system of email servers.
Email is a store-and-forward system, as shown in Figure 9.2, not an 
instant communication medium. When you compose and send an email, 
your provider’s outgoing mail server forwards it to the recipient’s 
incoming mail server. The message is stored there until the recipient logs 
in and picks it up. Each ISP or organization that provides email service 
has its own mail servers that participate in this global network for mail 
delivery. To access your messages on your incoming mail server, you can

messages through mail servers.
store-and-forward A message delivery system 
in which messages are forwarded between servers 
and then stored on those servers until they are 
picked up.

receives email messages on behalf of the email 
addresses it supports.

use a mail client (email software installed on your computer) or you can 
log into a web-based interface maintained by your email provider.
mail client Software installed on a computer 
that is used to compose and manage email.
Figure 9.2  Email is a store-and-forward system involving mail servers on the Internet. Mail is forwarded from one mail server to another and 
then is stored until the recipient picks it up.
Most providers that offer free email services, like Google, Yahoo!, and 
AOL, are primarily web-based. These types of email accounts are some-
times referred to as HTTP email accounts. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol) is a protocol for web content transmission. You might be able 
to set up certain mail clients to work with those accounts, but it is gener-
ally expected that you will use the web interface.
On the other hand, a mail client is customarily used for most email accounts 
that someone pays for, either directly or indirectly. For example, the email 
accounts at your workplace, the accounts that your ISP provides to you, and 
the accounts that you have through a web-hosting service (for example, if you 
own a domain name) are all designed to be used with a mail client.
Two kinds of email accounts are designed to be used with mail clients: a 
POP account and an IMAP account. Each uses a different protocol for 
receiving mail, and offers slightly different advantages.
◾	 Post Office Protocol (POP) is a literal store-and-forward proto-
col. It holds the messages until you pick them up, but it doesn’t 
maintain any direct communication with your email client. You can 
choose to leave the messages on the server or delete them from 
the server after you pick them up, but what you do with them after 
that point is of no concern to the server. For example, you could 
delete an email from your email client, and the message would 
continue to persist on the server. POP accounts work well for 
people who always work with their email from the same computer.
◾	 Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) is a modified version of 
store-and-forward. It continues to hold your messages even after you

to be used with an email client and uses IMAP 
protocol for receiving mail.

pick them up, and anything you do in your email client is reflected 
on the server. For example, if you delete a message, or create a new 
folder for storing messages, that change is automatically reflected in 
the email clients of every device that you use. The drawbacks are that 
you may not be able to access old mail without an Internet connec-
tion and not every email provider offers IMAP accounts.
The POP and IMAP protocol are used only for receiving email; a com-
plementary protocol called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is 
used for sending email from a POP or IMAP account.
The line between HTTP, POP, and IMAP accounts has become blurry in 
recent years, as more email providers have attempted to give customers 
more options without making them change email account types. Most 
providers allow customers the option of a web-based interface no matter 
what type of email account they have, and some email clients can send 
and receive mail from HTTP accounts, either natively or with some spe-
cial setup. In addition, some free web-based email services offer custom-
ers the option of paying a small amount for an upgrade to an account 
that can be used as a POP or IMAP account.
Instant Messaging, Texting, and Chatting
Instant messaging (IM) is another type of written message that is sent 
over the Internet. As its name suggests, the message is sent immediately 
rather than waiting for the recipient to log on to the service to retrieve 
his messages. In many cases, the recipient will be online at the same time 
as the sender and may respond immediately. The immediacy of IM makes 
it more like having an online chat.
Instant messaging is a push technology. That means that the messages 
are pushed out to the recipient if he or she is logged in; it doesn’t require 
the recipient to do anything to check for new messages. In contrast, 
email is a pull technology, because the recipient must actively check for 
messages in order to pull the new messages to his computer. (The email 
client can be set to automatically check for new messages at certain inter-
vals, so the email messages may seem to be arriving on their own, but it 
is actually the client software pulling them.)
Instant messaging requires you to have IM client software installed for 
the service you are using. For example, Yahoo! Messenger’s client soft-
ware for Windows appears in Figure 9.3. Other instant messaging clients 
include AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Microsoft Lync (formerly 
known as Microsoft Office Communicator). IM client software is avail-
able for Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems, plus several smart-
phone and tablet operating systems.
Some instant messaging services include voice and even video chat capabili-
ties, as well as picture sharing. Including these features takes the applications 
beyond simple instant messaging, into the realm of Voice over IP (VoIP) 
and videoconferencing, both of which are covered later in this chapter.
You can also send and receive instant messages on smartphones using a 
technology called Short Message Service (SMS), which goes through 
your cell phone provider’s network. This type of messaging is called texting.

Chapter 9: Online Communication
The differentiation 
between SMS and 
IM messages can get 
blurry because services 
are available that can 
cross the platforms. 
For example, some IM 
services offer clients 
for certain smartphone 
operating systems, and 
there are computer-
based applications that 
can send and receive 
SMS messages. If 
you use one of these 
services, it may not be 
obvious how the mes-
sage delivery will be 
billed (that is, whether 
the messages count as 
SMS messages toward 
your cell phone plan’s 
text message allow-
ance, or whether 
the messages use the 
phone’s Internet data 
plan), so monitor your 
usage carefully until 
you are sure.
Figure 9.3  Yahoo! Messenger’s client software for Windows 
enables you to have one-on-one text chats with others.
WhatsApp
Depending on your cell phone plan, you may only get a certain number of SMS text messages per month. If you find 
yourself running out of SMS messages each month, consider using WhatsApp Messenger, a cross-platform smart-
phone application that can send text messages using your phone’s Internet data plan, bypassing the phone’s SMS 
service. You are still sending text messages, but you’re doing so through an Internet server, so you aren’t charged per 
message, but only for the small amount of Internet data used. WhatsApp is available for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, 
Windows Phone, and Nokia. WhatsApp was originally developed by a very small company, but was purchased by 
Facebook in February 2014, giving it a much broader audience and greater financial backing for future development.
New Technologies
Some IM clients allow group chats, but they are normally with people 
whom you specifically invite. In contrast, many public or semi-public 
chat rooms enable you to have group conversations with people you 
may not know. Many websites include chat room software on some of 
their web pages that anyone can log into to participate in a group chat. 
For example, a recovery support site for alcoholics might have a group 
chat every night at a certain time.
The largest system of public chat rooms is Internet Relay Chat (IRC), 
with about 400,000 users worldwide. IRC is a system of chat servers 
that users log into using IRC client software. The user can then select a 
channel, which is a chat room for a particular subject of discussion, and 
enter the channel to join the conversation.

can meet and talk to other people.

Social Networking
Social networking is an umbrella term for sites such as Facebook, 
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+, in which users can post information 
about themselves and create groups of people with shared interests with 
which to chat and exchange ideas and web links.
Each user creates a profile, which can include details about her location, 
job, family, and interests. Social networks grow organically by friends 
inviting friends who in turn invite or include their own friends. Users 
are able to post and comment on photos and videos published to the 
network, share links, send each other emails, and conduct web chats.
Some social networks make extensive use of tags. These are ­searchable 
labels that can be added to posted content allow other people to 
find like-minded users and join interest groups, fan pages, and more. 
However, these self-applied tags are also useful to marketers and enable 
them to target potential customers far more accurately. Information 
sharing and access to people’s private information has thus become an 
important area of debate. On Twitter and some other services, tags are 
preceded by hash symbols (#) and are referred to as hashtags.
Some social networks are specialized. You might use Instagram to share 
photos, Vine for video clips, Reddit for news snippets, and YouTube for 
video-sharing. Other networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, are more 
general but allow you to cross-post updates to and from other social 
network sites.
One reason social networks are so successful is that they have accom-
panying mobile apps, so it’s easy for users to post updates and read 
posts from their smartphones or tablets. Many apps let you log in using 
your existing Twitter or Facebook details. This makes for a convenient 
user experience and is also useful to the app developers and Facebook/
Twitter as a mechanism for promotion.

Careers in IT
Social Media Marketer
A social media marketer specializes in helping companies promote themselves using social networking tools such 
as blogs, social networks, and microblogs, including Twitter. Their purpose is to increase public awareness of the 
company and its products. The role requires marketing expertise and a thorough understanding of how search 
tools work and how to call attention to the client companies. Using this knowledge, the social media marketing 
person adds keywords and hashtags to the content they create. This helps the client company’s web pages appear 
more prominently and frequently in search results and rank higher in page rank indexes. The process of writing 
content in this way is known as search engine optimization (SEO). Marketing and business skills and professional 
courses in SEO marketing are expected for such a role. A successful social media marketer will demonstrate her 
expertise by maintaining her own use of social networks.
search engine optimization (SEO) The 
process of writing web content so as to increase a 
page’s ranking in online search results.
Blogs and Microblogs
A blog (originally called weblog) is a web page where an individual or group 
publishes stories, essays, or articles that are generically referred to as posts. 
Blog posts differ from websites that contain news stories and marketing 
information in that they are personal and often opinionated in nature. 
Whereas a news story is objective, a blog post may put forth a point of view

experiences and opinions.

or an extended commentary. Some blogs are similar to personal diaries, but 
others are run by users with specialist knowledge of a topic they want to 
share with other people. A blog owner is likely to engage directly with read-
ers who comment on the topic and follow the blog.
Popular blogs with lots of followers and comments can be highly influ-
ential in their sphere of expertise. Social media tools such as Twitter and 
Facebook (www.facebook.com) are used to promote posts and get 
more people to contribute to the commentary.
Companies often use blogs to share news about forthcoming prod-
uct launches and ideas they are working on. A blog of this type may 
be part of a company’s website. For example, Microsoft hosts several 
official blogs written by employees in various departments to let the 
public know informally about what its teams are working on for future 
products and services. Figure 9.4 shows the Extreme Windows blog, 
for example, found at http://blogs.windows.com, which high-
lights advanced-level technologies for Windows.
Figure 9.4  Although blogs are best known for containing individual writers’ personal stories 
and opinions, some blogs are corporate-sponsored, like this one.
Many individual bloggers use a blog platform, which is a free or low-
cost blog-hosting website. Some of the most widely used blog platforms 
are WordPress, Typepad, and Blogger. These platforms act as the web 
host and offer customizable design templates as part of the blog. For a 
small additional fee, extra features are available, such as the capability to 
use your own domain name.
Microblogging is a form of blogging that allows users to post brief text 
commentary or post photos and audio clips. On Twitter (the best-known 
microblogging platform), each post (called a “tweet”) can be no longer 
than 140 characters. This restriction is intended to keep updates interest-
ing and make people think about the essence of what they’re trying to 
say. Some updates are used to link to blog posts the users have written or 
blog platform A web server that hosts the blogs 
of individuals, either free or for a small fee.

short messages.

to online articles they’ve found interesting and want to share or discuss, as 
in Figure 9.5, while others serve as a means for people in the public eye to 
communicate with their fans.
Figure 9.5  Twitter is used by all sorts of people and organizations to promote themselves 
and to comment on events.
Unlike email, microblogs can be seen by anyone and can be commented on 
by anyone, though people must usually register with the service to com-
ment. To address a post to someone, put an @ sign in front of the username. 
To find a topic of interest, you can search within the blogging platform. To 
make a post more likely to be found, you can add a # (hashtag) indicating 
the topic. Figure 9.6 shows a search for items tagged “Wimbledon.”

Chapter 9: Online Communication
The best-known microblogging platforms are Twitter, Tumblr, and 
Google+. Video and photo-sharing sites Vine and Instagram can also 
be thought of as microblogs, because users generally post a photo or a 
video clip with a caption and then invite comments.
Smartphone and tablet apps for microblogging sites enable users and 
followers to view new posts and get notifications about them or about 
replies to their own posts. Relevant and interesting posts are reposted by 
followers to their own followers, thereby helping to promote the origi-
nal post. A particularly significant tweet from a prominent public figure 
might be retweeted thousands of times.
Wikis
A wiki is an online database of information that any user can copy or 
amend using a web interface. Wikis are usually set up so users can col-
laborate and share information and knowledge. If someone has addi-
tional information related to the wiki’s content, he can add it to the wiki. 
Wikipedia is the best-known example of a wiki; it is a form of online 
encyclopedia created by and edited by web users. Figure 9.7 shows the 
Wikipedia web page that describes a wiki.
Figure 9.7  A wiki is an online database used for collaborative projects.
Newsgroups
Newsgroups were created long before the web and were the forerun-
ners to the web-based forums we use today. These groups are part of a 
system called Usenet, which is a global distributed discussion system. 
Usenet users read and post messages to various categories known as 
newsgroups. Discussions are stored as threads, which follow a particular 
topic. Posts are not stored on individual servers; they are stored on a set 
of distributed servers that form part of the Usenet network. Newsgroup 
servers are connected to each other to form a network. Newsgroups have 
their own protocol for accessing the posts, called NNTP (network news

by anyone and that is usually informational or 
instructive in nature.

transport protocol), which transports news articles between news servers 
and clients reading and posting articles. The client computer needs an 
application called a newsreader to read Usenet articles, or needs to use 
an email client that supports news reading.
Newsgroups usually focus on a particular topic of interest, but some 
groups allow postings on any topic. Discussions are not held on the 
servers indefinitely and typically will disappear after a few months. 
Newsgroups have declined in popularity as other forms of online com-
munication have come to prominence, but there are still more than 
100,000 active groups.
Forums
Web forums are a more sophisticated type of newsgroup. A forum is 
hosted on a standard website and can be accessed using any web browser. 
Many forums have a question-and-answer format in which members 
request advice from other forum members. Comments and replies to a 
post create a forum thread. Forum threads are saved and archived so 
that other users can easily find the answer to the same or similar question 
in future. You don’t always need to become a forum member in order to 
find useful advice on a forum or to search its threads, but you must join 
in order to create a new post and ask a question or start a discussion.
If you’re looking for advice on a brand or product, try typing that prod-
uct name plus the word forum into a search engine. For example, if you 
wanted to buy a new digital SLR camera, you might use a search engine 
to find answers to the question Which DSLR camera under $500 shall I 
buy? Your search results may include a link to a forum thread covering 
this topic at www.photography-forum.org (see Figure 9.8). You 
could then read everyone’s comments and advice on the matter, but 
you would need to join the forum to contribute to the discussion.

Chapter 9: Online Communication
Forums are often set up by interest groups and cover every aspect of 
life—from hobbies to transport, technology, health, and so on. Other 
forums are hosted on a company’s website so customers can request help 
with support issues and get advice from other customers and from tech-
nicians within the company. On many forums, users can give a thumbs-
up to a post to show appreciation for it and to increase the poster’s 
forum rating.
VoIP
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is used to make voice calls via 
the Internet by turning the voice message into small packets of data. IP, 
short for Internet protocol, is used to identify individual devices that are 
connected to the Internet and to route calls between them. For more 
detail at how IP addresses work, refer to Chapter 10, “Web Basics.”
Making VoIP calls requires a reliable web connection with plenty of band-
width. This bandwidth is needed in order to translate your voice into bits 
of data, transmit it to your friend, and then reassemble it in the correct 
order so what you said makes sense. On slower web connections, this pro-
cess may not work so smoothly and the caller’s speech may sound garbled 
or have delays.
VoIP calls can be made from your computer using a SIP (session Internet 
protocol) client and a URI (unique resource indicator), but it’s far 
easier—and much more common—to use a VoIP service such as Skype, 
FaceTime, or an IM client that also allows you to make voice calls, 
such as Yahoo! Messenger. VoIP calls can also be made from a tablet or 
smartphone using a VoIP app. Skype, Facebook Chat, and Truphone are 
popular VoIP apps. Google users in some countries can also make calls 
from their Google accounts just by clicking on the name of the person 
they want to call.
Skype is the most popular VoIP service in the world. Skype began as a 
VoIP service for making free computer-to-computer calls, but can also 
now be used to make cheaper international calls from a smartphone and 
for one-to-one video calls. Other VoIP services work in a similar way to 
Skype, but they don’t all have video calling options.
To use Skype, download the software client from www.skype.com. 
Then use the software to create a user profile for inclusion in the Skype 
database so others who might want to call you can find you. You can also 
use your email contacts list and call anyone on it who also uses Skype. 
Skype is part of Microsoft, so if you already have an Outlook, Messenger, 
or Hotmail account, you can sign in with those credentials. You can also 
sign in with your Facebook account details. A commercial ­version of 
Skype enables you to add a Skype phone number that non-Skype sub-
scribers can use to call you.
To use Skype for VoIP calls on a computer or laptop, you need built-
in speakers and a microphone, or to use an external microphone and 
speakers or a headset. To make video calls using Skype, you also need 
a webcam. You can also make calls using a Skype app on your tablet or 
smartphone.
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) A 
means of providing web-based telephony. The 
best-known example is Skype.
Skype A Microsoft-owned VoIP service used to 
make phone calls and sometimes video calls 
over a broadband, Wi-Fi, or cellular mobile web 
connection.
FaceTime An app installed on Apple iPhone 
and iPad devices that is used to make video calls 
between Apple device owners. VoIP was originally 
designed for making web-based phone calls, but 
the advent of much faster broadband and fixed-
line Internet connections has made it possible for 
the web to carry video calls too. Not only has VoIP 
become so dependable that many offices have 
replaced their telephone systems with VoIP-based 
ones, but it is now also routinely used for corpo-
rate videoconferencing.

Videoconferencing
Most video calls you make using Skype or another video calling app 
involve one person at each end of the line. Videoconferencing is a multi-
party version of the video call, as in Figure 9.9. An advantage of video­
conferencing is that meetings can be held without the need for participants 
to travel, saving travel time and associated costs. Videoconferencing is also 
becoming prevalent in education: Online lectures can be delivered, backed 
up with video-call–based mentoring sessions.

Figure 9.9  Videoconferencing enables multiple people to video chat at the same time.
Videoconferencing uses the same underlying protocols as VoIP uses, but 
it requires much more bandwidth. Corporate videoconferencing facilities 
can cost many thousands of dollars to set up, but the costs are quickly 
recouped because hotel bills, travel expenses, and time out of the office 
are not required. Companies such as Cisco and Polycom provide video-
conferencing telephony equipment. Microsoft Lync provides a phone 
and laptop-based videoconferencing service that companies can sign up 
their employees to use.
Videoconferencing can be far more effective than phone-based meetings 
because relevant graphics can be shown and because participants can see 
each other and interact in real-time.
videoconferencing A means of conducting 
a video conversation remotely using an Internet 
connection and the webcam or camera on your 
laptop, phone, or tablet.

Chapter 9: Online Communication
Communicating Appropriately
The way you express yourself online is just as important as choosing the 
best means of communicating. The language and tone you use can be 
chatty, friendly, respectful, or persuasive. You should always choose the 
appropriate medium and tone to fit the occasion and relationship with 
your intended recipient.
Professional versus Personal 
Communication
As the use of social media plays an increasingly larger role in our lives, it’s 
easy to fall into the trap of being overly familiar in your communication. 
When corresponding with people you don’t know well, or who are older 
or in a position of authority, address them formally and use polite lan-
guage. Avoid jargon and slang. Emoticons such as smiley face characters 
are also inappropriate in professional communication.
When sending professional communications, use a sincere but not overly 
friendly tone and diplomatic language. Avoid unnecessary capitalization 
and exclamation marks. Read through what you’ve written before sending 
the document. Check spelling and grammar. Microsoft Word and other 
word processors have automatic spell-checkers and grammar checkers, but 
keep in mind they are not foolproof. If the document is a job application 
or a letter asking for a work experience placement, your written material 
will be scrutinized on these elements in addition to the content.
Personal communication also involves a measure of good judgment. 
Remember that jokes aren’t always appreciated; something you think 
is funny and friendly may inadvertently upset someone else. Emails and 
text messages can come across more negative than the writer intended. 
Emoticons can help, but they can also be misinterpreted. If possible, talk 
to the person face-to-face or chat online. Verbal communication and 
IMs can be a lot friendlier and allow your tone of voice or, in the case of 
video calls or face-to-face chat, gestures and facial expressions, to help 
convey your meaning.
For any type of digital communication, avoid language that could offend 
on the basis of race, religion, disability, sexuality, or gender. A good rule 
for any form of communication is to ask yourself if you would be happy 
to see the message printed in a newspaper or another public outlet.
Verbal versus Written Communication
Online communication has become the standard contact method for 
many people, but a phone call or face-to-face conversation can some-
times be the better choice. When deciding between written and verbal 
communication, consider these factors:
◾	 With whom am I communicating? If you know someone well and 
the two of you regularly chat face-to-face and by email, a less formal 
means of communicating, such as an instant message or a Facebook 
message, could be fine.
www.ebook777.com

242
Part III: Connectivity and Communication
◾	 What is the context or subject of the communication? If you want 
to discuss something serious or enlist someone’s help and support, 
verbal communication is often the best approach.
◾	 Am I likely to need a record of the communication? Written com-
munications are generally best when you need a record of proof. 
An email may suffice, but a legal document or formal notification 
or application may require a typed letter sent by regular mail ser-
vice. For business communication, address the recipient formally, 
using a courtesy title such as Mr., Mrs., or Ms., and use polite, 
respectful language.
◾	 Is the speed of communication important? Some people check their 
email and social media messages frequently; other people do so 
much less often. Check whether the person you want to communi-
cate with uses online communication regularly.
In any medium, stay calm and moderate your language, even if someone 
is criticizing you. Slang and profanities undermine any argument.
Choosing the Appropriate Online Medium
Using the right means of online communication shows you understand 
what message you want to get across and whom you are corresponding 
with.
The following checklist can help you choose the right medium for the 
particular occasion.
Email
◾	 Suitable for most types of communication, especially if they are not 
time-sensitive.
◾	 Good for formal messages and communication with strangers.
◾	 Provides a permanent record of outgoing and incoming messages 
(unless, of course, you delete them).
Instant messaging
◾	 Ideal to get a quick answer to a question or for passing small 
amounts of information between colleagues.
◾	 Useful for quick updates with friends.
Social networking—personal
◾	 Appropriate mainly for your personal world.
◾	 Useful for informing your network of friends what is happening in 
your life, not necessarily work related.
◾	 Good for posting photos and videos of recent events you’ve been 
involved in.
Social networking—business
◾	 Increasingly used for advertising and business promotion.
◾	 Many social networking sites are dedicated fully or in part to 
matching job-seekers with potential employers.

243
Chapter 9: Online Communication
Blogs
◾	 Ideal for expressing personal opinions and providing updates about 
yourself publicly as well as to your friends.
Microblogs
◾	 Best for very short summary updates you want existing followers to 
see and that can also be found by anyone searching for you or for 
the topic you cover.
Forums
◾	 Best for discussing topics of shared interest and communicating as 
part of a community.
VoIP calls
◾	 Useful for chatting with friends or business associates. Requires a 
reliable, high-speed web connection and use of the same VoIP ser-
vice. Works well for families keeping touch around the globe using 
phone or video.
Videoconferencing
◾	 Appropriate mainly for the workplace or schools and colleges so 
groups can interact visually.
Choose your communication method carefully, understanding the ben-
efits and drawbacks of each channel. Tailor your communication to what 
you need to accomplish and with whom you communicate.

Using and Managing Email
Email is the online communication method you will probably use the 
most in your daily work, school, and personal life. As you learned earlier 
in this chapter, you can access your email using a web interface or you 
can use an email client application. In the following sections, you’ll learn 
how to use Microsoft Outlook 2010, the email client that comes with 
the Microsoft Office suite of applications that you have studied in earlier 
chapters. The general principles are the same no matter which email 
client you use, though, such as setting up accounts, sending and receiv-
ing mail, and organizing messages into folders.
Setting Up Email
When you install an email client, the Setup utility offers to set up your 
email account. You can add more email accounts later, though, in the 
same email client so that you receive messages from multiple accounts 
in a single Inbox folder. Each time you send an email, you can choose 
which account it will be sent from. If you are using a web-based email

Part III: Connectivity and Communication
Some email clients can automatically configure some types of accounts 
without your having to enter the technical settings for them (such as the 
incoming and outgoing mail server names and the account type). When 
you set up an email account, Outlook attempts to determine the correct 
settings for that account automatically. It doesn’t always succeed, so you 
may need to manually configure the account settings. The following 
Step by Step exercise shows the steps for setting up a new account in 
Outlook 2010.
CAUTION
When you sign up for an email account, you will be asked what password you want to use. Make sure you 
choose a strong password. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess; it may include a combina-
tion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals, and symbols. A strong password should be fairly 
long (at least eight characters) and should not match any word in the dictionary or any common phrase or 
number sequence.

Step by Step
Setting Up a New Account Automatically in Microsoft Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to set up a new account in Outlook 2010 by allowing Outlook to automatically detect the correct 
settings to use. Try this method first:
	 1.	Click File, and click Add Account. The Add New Account dialog box opens.
	 2.	Fill in your name, email address, and password in the fields provided. Then click Next.

	 3.	If you see a box asking whether to allow a website to confirm server settings, click Yes.
	 4.	If a message appears that the account has been successfully configured, click Finish, and you’re done. If, on the 
other hand, a message appears that the account cannot be automatically configured, click Cancel and then see 
the next section.
Setting Up a New Account Manually in Microsoft Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to set up a new account in Outlook 2010 manually. Use this method if the previous method has 
failed, or if your account has some special settings that email clients in the past have failed to detect.
	 1.	Click File, and click Add Account. The Add New Account dialog box opens.
	 2.	Click Manually Configure Server Settings or Additional Server Types, and click Next.
	 3.	On the Choose Service screen, accept the default of Internet Mail and click Next.

	 4.	On the Internet Email Settings screen, fill in all the requested information. You will need to know the incoming and 
outgoing mail server names; if you don’t know these, get that information from your email provider.
	
	 Note: By default Outlook creates a new data file for each email account you set up. If you want the new email account 
to use an existing data file (for example, outlook.pst), select the Existing Outlook Data File option button and then 
browse for the data file. This is an issue only for POP3 accounts, IMAP accounts store the mail on the server.
	 5.	Click Next. Outlook tests the settings by sending and receiving a message. If both incoming and outgoing tests 
show Completed, click Close and then click Finish; your settings are correct.
	
	 If, on the other hand, you see a message that Outlook cannot connect to either your incoming or outgoing mail 
server, click Close and then click More Settings to open the Internet Email Settings dialog box.
	 6.	Use the options in the dialog box to configure your 
settings as directed by your email service provider. For 
example, here are some common settings you might 
need to change:
◾	 On the Outgoing Server tab, select the My Outgoing 
Server (SMTP) Requires Authentication check box.
◾	 If your email provider has told you that you need 
an SSL connection, on the Advanced tab, mark the 
This Server Requires an Encrypted Connection (SSL) 
check box.
◾	 On the Advanced tab, change the port numbers for 
the incoming and/or outgoing servers to the numbers 
that your email service provider has specified.
	 7.	Click OK, and then return to Step 5 to recheck your 
settings.

Receiving Email
Once the account is set up, your email client will automatically start 
using it. Your email address and password are stored, and you will not 
have to enter them again.
NOTE
If you are using Outlook, and if you followed the Step by Step exercise in the preceding section to set up the 
account, the first message you will probably receive is the test message you sent yourself. You may also 
receive other messages too, and you can send yourself additional test messages for practice.
The navigation pane in an email client typically appears on the left and 
shows a list of mail folders, with one of them being Inbox. The Inbox 
folder is where incoming mail appears by default. Nearly all email clients 
work this same way, with a navigation pane at the left. There are also 
folders there for Outbox (where outgoing messages wait to be sent), 
Sent (where copies of the messages you send are stored), and Trash 
(where deleted messages are stored). There may also be a Junk Email 
folder, where incoming messages that the email client classifies as junk 
mail are placed. Figure 9.10 shows these in Outlook 2010. Note that 
unread messages appear in bold in the list of messages.

Part III: Connectivity and Communication
Also in Figure 9.10, notice that Outlook 2010 provides a reading pane, 
which shows the content of the selected message. When you use a read-
ing pane, you do not have to open a message (by double-clicking it) 
to read its contents; you can preview that content just by selecting the 
message in the list. The Reading pane can appear either on the right or at 
the bottom of the window; you can control its setting on the View tab. 
Other email clients typically also have a reading pane. A web interface 
may or may not have one.
Your email client is probably set to send and receive message automati-
cally at certain intervals, such as every ten minutes. If so, messages will 
appear in your Inbox throughout the day, as long as your email client 
is running. You can also manually initiate a send/receive operation. To 
do so in Outlook 2010, click the Send/Receive All Folders icon on the 
Quick Access Toolbar (above the File tab).
Sending Email
To send a message in Outlook 2010, click the Home tab and click New 
Email. Or, in another email client, click the equivalent button, which 
may have a slightly different name (like New or Compose). A message 
composition screen appears. Fill in the information as prompted, as 
shown in Figure 9.11, and then click the Send button.

◾	 From: This field might or might not appear. If you have multiple 
email accounts set up in your mail client, you may be prompted to 
choose which account the message will be sent from.
◾	 To: Put the recipients’ email addresses here. If there is more than 
one recipient, separate the names with semicolons. You can also 
look up recipients from a stored address book in your mail client; 
in Outlook, addresses are stored in the Contacts list.

Chapter 9: Online Communication
◾	 Cc: If you want to send an informational copy of the message to 
someone, put that person’s email address in the Cc field.
◾	 Bcc: This field might or might not appear. A Bcc is a blind copy—
in other words, a copy that other recipients are not aware is being 
sent. In Outlook 2010, this field doesn’t appear by default, but if 
you click the To or Cc button, a dialog box appears in which you 
can select or enter Bcc recipients along with To and Cc recipients.
◾	 Subject: This is the title of the message, which will appear in the 
recipient’s Inbox list. The subject should be short but descriptive; 
avoid general subject likes like “Hi” or “Info.”
◾	 Body: This is the area where you type the main part of the message.
Working with Attachments
Email you receive may have attachments, which are files that travel along 
with the text of the email. You can also send attachments with emails you 
send yourself.
When you receive a message with an attachment, a symbol may appear 
on the message in your Inbox to indicate its presence. In Outlook 2010, 
the symbol is a paperclip, as shown in Figure 9.12.

To open an attachment, double-click it. To save it to your hard drive, right-
click it and choose Save As (for one) or Save All Attachments (for all).
To send an attachment yourself, as you are composing the message, look 
for an Attach button or command. In Outlook 2010, an Attach File 
button appears on the Ribbon. Click it and then follow the prompts to 
attach the file(s).
The following Step by Step explains how to compose and send a message 
in Outlook 2010 that contains an attachment.

Working with Stored Contacts
Outlook 2010 is a full-featured contact management application, and it 
includes separate sections for email handling, contact management, and 
calendars. All these sections are connected, though, so you can use them 
together. The contact management section is called Contacts. To view 
it, click Contacts in the lower-left corner of the Outlook 2010 screen. 
Figure 9.13 shows the Outlook 2010 Contacts list with three contacts in 
it. When you first open the Contacts list, you may not have any con-
tacts there. You can create some if you like by clicking the New Contact 
button and filling out the form that appears.
Contacts The section in Outlook that stores 
people’s contact information.
Troubleshooting
Working Around Attachment Size Limitations
Email providers have specific (but varying) limits to overall size of emails and their attachments. Larger files (such 
as video clips) will be rejected and prevent the email containing them from being delivered. If you want to send a 
large file, try compressing it first. You can do this by right-clicking the file in Windows Explorer and choosing Send 
To ➪ Compressed folder. If it still exceeds your email provider’s limit, it’s better to send a link for your friend to 
download the item. You can use an FTP service or upload a file to OneDrive or Dropbox (online storage services you 
can use for free) and send your friend a link to download it. This can also be preferable because large emails take 
longer to send and use up a large chunk of the recipient’s mailbox.

When addressing an email message, if you know the person’s email 
address, you can type it directly into the To, Cc, or Bcc field. As you 
start typing, the email client’s autocomplete feature may offer to fill in 
the address for you. You can also select from your Contacts list, as shown 
in the following Step by Step.
Step by Step
Addressing an Email Message from the Contacts List in Outlook 2010
Follow this procedure to look up email addresses in the Contacts list as you are composing a new email in Outlook 
2010:
	 1.	Click the Home tab, and click New Email. A new message composition window appears.
	 2.	Click the To button. The Select Names: Contacts dialog box opens.
	 3.	Click the name of the person to whom you want to address the email.
	 4.	Click one of the buttons at the bottom of the dialog box to indicate the appropriate field in which to place the 
person’s email address: To, Cc, or Bcc.
	 5.	Repeat Step 4 to add more recipients if desired.
	 6.	Click OK to return to the message composition window and complete the email as you would normally.
CAUTION
Make sure you don’t share others’ contact information without permission. If you’re sending an email to 
­multiple people, and you don’t want them to see each other’s addresses, put your own email address in 
the To field and then put all the recipients’ addresses in the Bcc field.

Responding to and Forwarding Emails
When you receive an email, you can choose to reply to it by creating a 
new message, but it is often easier to use the Reply feature in your email 
client. When you select a message and then choose Reply, the mail client 
starts a new message for you that is pre-addressed to the original sender, 
with the original subject in the Subject line preceded by RE: and the 
original message quoted in the message body. This saves time because all 
you have to enter is your reply. Figure 9.14 shows a reply being com-
posed in Outlook 2010.
Reply A message that is sent back to the original 
sender.
Figure 9.14  A reply includes the original subject and message body, and the original sender is set as the recipient.
The Reply All feature works just like Reply except it addresses the  
message not only to the original sender but also to any co-recipients on 
the original message. (It does not include recipients who got their copies 
through Bcc.)
To send a message you’ve received from one person to someone else, use 
the Forward feature. When you forward a message, the original subject 
appears in the Subject line, preceded by FWD:. The original message 
body appears in the body area, and if the original message contained any 
attachments, they are included as attachments in the forwarded email 
too. Everything is filled in for you except the new recipient. Fill in the 
new recipient in the To box and send the message.
Out of Office/Automatic Replies
If you know you won’t be responding to emails for a few days, it’s polite 
to set up an out-of-office message. When people send you an email, 
they’ll get an automatic response explaining that you are out of email 
contact at present but will attend to their messages as soon as you return.
Reply All A message that is sent back to the 
original sender plus to any other recipients.
Forward A copy of a message sent on to some-
one other than the original sender.
out-of-office message A message that people 
receive when you are unable to personally answer

A good out-of-office message should include the dates that you will be 
gone and an alternative contact person who can be reached in case of an 
urgent matter.
For example, here is a typical message:
I will be out of the office from March 1 to March 15 and will not 
be checking messages. If this is an urgent matter, please contact my 
supervisor, Mary Clark, at 317-555-2811 or mary@sycamoreknoll.com. 
Otherwise, I will respond to your message when I am back in the office.
Sincerely,
Ashley Colvin
Out-of-office messages are set up on your mail server, not in your email 
client. That’s because when you are out of the office, your email client soft-
ware won’t be running, so you can’t count on it to handle the automatic 
reply.
In some cases, you may be able to set up automatic replies through your 
email client. It depends on the incoming mail server. If you are using a 
Microsoft Exchange mail server (for example, through your company’s 
network at work), you can use the Automatic Replies feature in Outlook 
2010. Click File, and click Automatic Replies. If you don’t see that com-
mand after clicking File, you can’t use automatic replies in Outlook.
To set up an automatic reply on your mail server, log into your mail pro-
vider’s website, or log into your hosting account if the email account you 
are working with is part of a domain you own. In the provider’s configura-
tion pages online, you will find a feature that will enable you to set up an 
out-of-office message. You may also be able to set up an automatic reply 
in the web-based interface for your account, as shown in Figure 9.15.
Signatures
Rather than typing your name at the end of each email you send, you can 
append a signature that is added automatically. This can include your 
Skype name, mobile phone number, Twitter handle, blog address, or 
other information. You set up a signature in your email client. The fol-
lowing Step by Step section shows how to set one up in Outlook 2010.
automatic reply A feature on a mail server that 
automatically sends a message back to each one 
received when it is enabled.
signature Text that is automatically appended to 
outgoing messages.
CAUTION
Be conservative with the information you put in a signature line if you are using the same email account for 
both business and personal email. You might write a formal email address to a business client, for example, 
and forget that you have something very informal and silly in your signature.

Step by Step
Creating a Signature in Outlook
To create a signature in Outlook, follow these steps: 
	 1.	Select File ➪ Options ➪ Mail. Under Compose Messages, choose Signatures. A Signatures and Stationery menu 
appears.
	 2.	Click New, type a name for a new signature, and click OK.
	 3.	Type the text for the signature in the Edit Signature area. Use the formatting tools above the text entry area to 
format the text as desired.
	 4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as needed to create additional signatures if you want different signatures for different 
accounts or situations.
	 5.	Open the E-mail Account drop-down list and choose an email account for which you want to set a signature.
	 6.	Open the New Messages drop-down list and choose the signature you want to use for that email for new messages, 
or choose (none) to turn off signatures.

choose the signature you want to use, or choose (none) to turn off signatures.
	 8.	(Optional) Repeat Steps 5–7 to configure additional email accounts if desired.
	 9.	Click OK.
Archiving Emails
Your email client keeps emails indefinitely, so over time the data file for 
your email client may become very large. The larger the data file, the 
longer it takes for the application to open, and the longer it takes for 
some operations, such as searching. A large data file also takes longer to 
back up.
One solution is to delete the old emails, and it’s a good idea to do so 
if there are emails that you know you will never want to refer to again. 
However, there’s another way to keep your email data file small: You can 
archive old messages to a separate data file. That way, you can open that 
archive any time you need to refer to older mail, but your old mail isn’t 
in your mail client taking up space on a daily basis.
Some email clients have an Archive command that you can use to 
automatically archive items that meet certain criteria. Other clients 
require you to create archive files manually and move content into them 
manually by dragging and dropping content from existing folders to 
the archive folders. Outlook 2010 has a very good archiving feature, 
explained in the following Step by Step.
archive To move items from the current location 
to another for backup purposes; a useful way of 
storing old messages while freeing up space for 
new ones.

calendar.
	 4.	Confirm the archive file name in the Archive File text box.
	 5.	Click OK.
Managing Junk Mail
Junk email, also called spam, is sent out by the millions of messages 
every day on the Internet. By some estimates, it accounts for more than 
80 percent of all email sent. Mail filtering software helps cut down on the 
number of unsolicited ads you receive by analyzing your incoming mes-
sages and applying message sorting rules and filtering to them to deter-
mine which ones are ads and which ones are legitimate correspondence. 
Using mail filtering software can save you lots of time because you don’t 
have to go through large amounts of junk mail to find the important 
messages sent to you.
There are several ways to filter junk mail. Many email applications 
include a junk mail filter that automatically moves messages it suspects to 
be spam into a Junk Mail folder. You can periodically look through that 
folder to see if there is anything you want, and then delete the rest.
Many ISPs also offer junk mail filtering. This type of filtering is typically 
invisible to the end user; the mail that’s filtered out never even reaches 
your email client software. Because of the danger of missing a legitimate 
message, this type of filtering is usually very conservative in its targeting 
of junk mail.
Third-party junk mail filtering programs can work with your email client 
and can be fine-tuned for the level of filtering you are most comfortable 
with. Some people prefer to get more junk mail in order to be assured 
they aren’t missing any legitimate messages, whereas other people prefer to 
enable the most aggressive junk mail filtering settings. Some filtering soft-
ware can even get better over time by learning from the choices you make.
spam Unsolicited “junk” mail, typically containing 
offers (some legitimate, some not) of products or 
services to buy.

	 2.	 How do you include an attachment in an email?
	 3.	 How do you set up an automatic response when you are out of the office?
	 4.	 What is archiving, and what is its advantage over deleting messages?
When you identify a piece of junk mail, you can add its sender to a 
blacklist. Any further mail from that sender will be automatically dis-
carded upon receipt. If you want to make sure that you always receive 
mail from a certain recipient, regardless of your junk mail settings, you 
can add that address to a whitelist, also called a safe list. Whitelisted 
senders will always 
have their mail 
delivered to your 
inbox.
In Outlook 2010, 
you can control 
your junk mail 
options by clicking 
the Junk button on 
the Home tab and 
then choosing Junk 
Email Options 
from the menu.

Summary
Internet Communication Types
The Internet has fostered many means of communication, and it is important to choose the cor-
rect medium for a situation. Email is like postal mail for computers; it is not instantly delivered, 
using a store-and-forward system that employs mail servers to move the mail from place to place 
and a mail client to pick up one’s mail.
Some email accounts are web-based, also called HTTP email accounts. Most people use them via 
web interfaces. There are also Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Mail Access Protocol 
(IMAP) accounts, which are both designed for use with mail clients. POP and IMAP proto-
cols are only for receiving email; they are both paired with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) for sending mail.
Instant messaging (IM) consists of instant text messages sent over the Internet. When instant 
messages are sent over phone systems, it is called texting or Short Message Service (SMS). IM is 
a push technology, whereas email is a pull technology.
Chat rooms are like group instant messaging. You signal your willingness to participate by enter-
ing a chat room, such as a channel in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server.
Social networking is an umbrella term for sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and 
Google+. Users can post their own text and pictures and express their opinions. Tags (hashtags) 
are used to identify topics. Some common social networks are Instagram, Vine, Reddit, 
YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
A blog is a web page where an individual or group publishes posts, which may contain news, 
opinions, photos, and essays. Blogs can be either personal or commercial. A blog platform 
is a service that enables people to create their own blogs and hosts the blogs on its server. 
Microblogging allows users to post brief text commentary, photos, and audio clips. Twitter is the 
best-known microblogging site.
A wiki is a collaboratively managed database of information. Wikipedia is the largest and most 
popular wiki. Newsgroups are no longer very popular, but used to be extremely so; they are 
public message forums exchanged through a service called Usenet. To read in newsgroups, you 
use newsreader software. A forum is a web-based public discussion area.
Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technology for making voice calls over the Internet. These calls can also 
include video, through services such as Skype and FaceTime, or an IM client that includes video 
chat capabilities. Videoconferencing is a multi-user version of video chat.
Communicating Appropriately
Because there are so many means of online communication, the appropriate tone and language 
need to be chosen for each. More formality is typically expected in business communication than 
in social networking. Poorly written communications send out the wrong message and can be 
misinterpreted, leading to conflict. Face-to-face communications and phone calls are preferable to 
online exchanges in some circumstances because non-verbal communications methods, including 
gestures and tone of voice, can be used to ensure the message is correctly conveyed.
Using and Managing Email
Email is sent and received through an email client or a web interface. Microsoft Outlook is one 
of the most popular email clients. When you set up a new email account, make sure you choose a 
strong password, which is a password that is not easy for someone to guess.

Chapter 9: Online Communication
To get started with an email client, you set up your account(s) in that program. Your messages 
then appear in the Inbox, and you can compose your own messages from that program’s interface. 
The Inbox may include a reading pane, which shows the content of the selected message.
When composing email, you must enter a recipient, a subject, and a message body. You may option-
ally include an attachment. When addressing email, the To box is for the main recipients, Cc is for 
those who will receive a copy, and Bcc is for those who will receive an undisclosed copy. You may 
optionally select recipients from the Contacts list in Outlook (or equivalent in your email application).
Most email clients enable you to save email addresses of people with whom you correspond and 
use them when addressing messages. In Outlook, this is the Contacts list.
You can reply to a received message by clicking the Reply button; other options include Reply All 
and Forward.
An out-of-office message sends an automatic reply to anyone who emails you while you are 
away. You can set this up in Outlook only if you use an Exchange server. Otherwise, you must set 
it up with your mail provider. You may be able to configure it from the web-based interface that 
the provider supplies for your email account.
A signature is text that is automatically appended to outgoing emails. You can set this up in your 
mail client.
To avoid having your mail file get too big, you can periodically archive messages, which means to 
transfer messages to an auxiliary storage folder based on criteria you specify.
Unsolicited junk mail, also known as spam, can be minimized using mail filtering software, which 
may include both blacklists and whitelists.

The Impact of Social Networking
Social networking has become a major player in Internet communication and is now moving into 
the workplace. Look at your environment, school, college, or workplace and consider the impact 
of allowing social networking on the internal network. Ask yourself the following questions:
◾	 Would being able to use social networking during working hours affect productivity?
◾	 Can social networking replace existing communications in the workplace?
◾	 Are there disadvantages to using social networking in the workplace? 
Discuss these questions with your colleagues, and compare their views with yours.

How the Web Works
The Internet is a global network of millions of computers that can 
communicate with each other. Provided that two computers are con-
nected to the Internet, they can share information between them. The 
World Wide Web (WWW), often referred to as “the web,” is part of the 
Internet; it is a network of interconnected pages of information stored 
on publicly accessible servers using a consistent page layout and format-
ting language.
Web Browsing Components
Web browsing involves three components:
◾	 Web servers: Store and provide access to websites
◾	 Web browsers: Request and display information to individuals
◾	 Web pages: The individual documents that web servers store and 
web browsers request.
Web Servers
When someone connects to the Internet, he typically uses a computer 
with a desktop operating system, such as Windows 7. The informa-
tion accessed by that person, however, is stored on a different type of 
computer, called a web server. As you learned in Chapter 8, a server is 
a powerful computer that exists in order to provide data or services to 
other computers. A web server is a server on which web pages are stored 
and made available to the public.
Internet  A global packet-switched network 
created cooperatively by multiple companies, 
governments, and standards organizations.
World Wide Web (WWW) A network of inter-
connected pages of information stored on publicly 
accessible servers.
web server A server that receives requests for 
web page data and supplies it by sending it over 
the Internet.
Careers in IT
Web Designer
A web designer creates websites for businesses, schools, organizations, and individuals. Web designers not only 
have a strong background in programming tools like HTML, Java, and ASP, but also an eye for what makes a page 
functional, attractive, and easy to use. If you are interested in being a web designer, you will want to study com-
puter technology, programming, user interface design, and computer graphics.
Web Browsers
A web browser, often referred to simply as a browser, is an applica-
tion used to access websites and to retrieve or upload information. The 
browser runs on an individual user’s computer and provides a communi-
cation interface to web servers.
Many different browsers are available. The most popular ones include:
◾	 Internet Explorer
◾	 Firefox
◾	 Chrome
◾	 Safari
All these browsers work in a similar fashion. Typically, if you know how 
to use one, you’ll be able to find your way around any of the others.

Chapter 10: Web Basics
Internet Explorer comes preinstalled on computers that run the Windows 7 
operating system. To use a different browser, simply download it from 
the manufacturer’s website and install it. Note that certain web applica-
tions prefer certain browsers, so you may want more than one. You can 
have multiple browsers installed in Windows, and even have more than 
one open at a time. You’ll learn more about using a browser later in this 
chapter.
Web Pages
A web page is a file that is formatted for use on the World Wide Web. 
The content of a web page is displayed in a browser. Web pages can con-
tain a variety of content, including text, graphics, audio, and video.
Most web pages are written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), 
which defines the layout of a web page by using a variety of tags and 
attributes. When a web page is downloaded into a browser, the browser 
uses the instructions in the markup language to display the page as the 
page author intended.
Most web pages contain hyperlinks. A hyperlink, sometimes simply 
called a “link,” is a clickable link to another page (or another spot on the 
same page). The hyperlink is the main mechanism for navigating through 
a website. Each page on a website might have any number of links to 
content stored elsewhere on the site or even on another site altogether. 
When the mouse cursor changes from an arrow symbol to a hand, that 
indicates the presence of a hyperlink.
Some web pages are static. That is, their content does not change until 
their owners update them manually. Other web pages are dynamic, 
frequently updating information such as a current stock price or weather 
report.
Understanding URLs and IP Addresses
You know what the main components of the Internet are. But users 
actually access the web pages they need online by using URLs and IP 
addresses.
URLs
A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address 
or a uniform resource identifier (URI), is the set of characters you enter 
into your web browser’s address bar to navigate to a specific web page. 
An example of a URL is http://www.microsoft.com. If you type 
this URL in your browser’s address bar, your browser will display the 
main page of Microsoft’s website.
What makes up a URL? The full string of a URL is composed of three 
components:
◾	 The protocol: A protocol is a set of rules that govern the transmis-
sion of data between two devices. On the Internet, the HyperText 
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is commonly used for this purpose—
hence the presence of http:// in most URLs. Another example of 
a protocol used on the Internet is the Internet Protocol (IP).
web page A file formatted for use on the World 
Wide Web.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
A language for encoding data and graphics for 
display in a web browser.
hyperlink A pointer to another point on a web 
page, which you access by clicking the hyperlink.
uniform resource locator (URL) A string 
of characters that identifies the location of a 
resource on a website.
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) The 
protocol used to send and receive web pages on 
the Internet.

◾	 The destination server (domain name): This is indicated by a 
domain name, such as bbc.co.uk (you’ll learn more about domain 
names in a moment.). In most cases, this domain name is preceded 
with the letters www followed by a period.
◾	 The path: This is the exact location of the file you are requesting 
on the server. For example, the document might be stored in a 
folder on the web server called news. A path might also include a 
specific filename, such as news/story24871.htm. If no filename 
is included in the path, a default page from the specified folder 
location loads.
A full URL would be http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/ 
story24871.htm. Figure 10.1 identifies each portion of the URL.
Figure 10. 1  The URL explained.
NOTE
Notice the use of the forward slash as a separator. This is in contrast to the backslash used in Windows to 
describe a file path.
A domain name is a name that identifies an entity on the Internet. It’s 
a key part of a URL. A company or individual can register for a domain 
name. That name can then act as an identifier for that company or 
person.
In its basic form, a domain name consists of an identifier followed by an 
extension, like microsoft.com. The extension, also called the top-level 
domain, is often used to identify the type of organization that the name 
represents. For example, the .com extension represents a commercial 
organization, whereas the .edu extension is reserved for educational 
institutions, like harvard.edu.
Some domain names also include a two-letter country code—for exam-
ple, .uk for the United Kingdom, .ca for Canada, and .sa for Saudi 
Arabia. Domain names can also include sub-domains—for example, 
training.microsoft.com or marketing.microsoft.com.
domain name A name that identifies an entity 
on the Internet.
top-level domain The code at the end of a 
URL that indicates the type of organization the 
name represents, such as COM for commercial 
businesses.
TIP
Companies that are global in nature should register their domains in multiple countries. For example, if you 
type www.microsoft.se, you receive Microsoft’s home page in Swedish.

IP Addresses
Every computer that connects directly to the Internet has its own unique 
numeric address, called its IP address. IP stands for Internet Protocol, 
one of the protocols in the TCP/IP suite of protocols. A protocol is an 
agreed-upon rule or standard; the Internet is based on TCP/IP rules. 
Most networks today, including the Internet itself, use IP addressing to 
identify computers. If you connect to the Internet through an Internet 
service provider (ISP), your ISP assigns you an IP address automatically. 
Depending on the ISP, that address may be a static IP address (that is, 
permanently assigned to your modem) or a dynamic IP address (that is, 
temporarily assigned to your modem as long as it is connected to the ISP).
Running the ipconfig command at a command prompt displays your com-
puter’s IP address, which is the private address assigned to it by your router. 
To display a command prompt, click the Start button, type cmd, and press 
Enter. Look for a line that includes “Local Area Connection.” You should see 
the two addresses allocated to your computer—IPv6 first, followed by IPv4.
If you want to see your computer’s public address—that is, the one it uses 
on the Internet—visit http://whatismyipaddress.com. The main 
page will display your computer’s public IP address. There is also a map 
that shows the geographical location of your Internet service provider.
How Domain Names and IP Addresses Are Related
If you enter an IP address in your web browser, the browser goes directly to 
that site. If you enter a domain name, though, it goes to a Domain Name 
System (DNS) server on the Internet, which is a directory lookup that 
converts domain names into their corresponding IP addresses. Looking up 
a name and finding the IP address is known as name resolution, or resolv-
ing the address. Your browser does this for you automatically.
IP address A numeric address by which a par-
ticular computer is known on a network.
static IP address An IP address that is perma-
nently assigned to a device.
dynamic IP address An IP address that is 
temporarily assigned to a device.
Domain Name System (DNS) The naming 
system employed to enable users to access 
websites using their domain names or URLs rather 
than their IP addresses.
name resolution The process of translating 
domain names to numerical IP addresses. A DNS 
server is used to resolve a name to an address.
Registering a Domain Name
For any company wanting to do business on the Internet or just have an online presence, choosing the right domain 
name is critical. Ideally, the domain name will match the company name as closely as possible. An exact match 
may not be possible, however, because the name may already be taken. If your company needs a specific name 
that is already taken, you may be able to buy the rights to that name from the current owner, or you may be able to 
register the name with a different top-level domain. For example, instead of a .com address, you might be able to 
get the .net or .biz version.
Anyone can register a domain name, as long as it doesn’t belong to an existing company or organization. You can 
register a domain name with a domain registrar company such as GoDaddy.com or 1&1.com. The exact cost var-
ies with the registrar, but is generally between US$10 and US$30 a year.
The name registration must be renewed on a yearly basis, but you can pay for multiple years at a time. When the 
owner of a domain name fails to renew it, it becomes available for someone else to claim and register.

Accessing the Web with a Browser
As mentioned, you use a web browser to access content on the Internet. 
In this section, you’ll learn how to start your browser, access websites, 
navigate those sites, bookmark your favorite sites, and more.
NOTE
This section assumes you’re using the Internet Explorer browser, which is included with the Windows 7 oper-
ating system. Browsers are constantly being updated. When Windows 7 was launched, it included Internet 
Explorer version 8. The latest version of Internet Explorer (IE) at the time of writing, however, is version 11. If 
you have Windows Updates enabled (refer to Chapter 11, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security”), your 
system likely has the latest version.
Starting Your Browser
You can open Internet Explorer in a few different ways:
◾	 Click the Start button and select Internet Explorer from the list of 
programs (see Figure 10.2).
◾	 Double-click the Internet Explorer shortcut icon on your desktop 
(if there is one).
◾	 Click the Internet Explorer icon on your taskbar (assuming it’s 
been pinned there; see Figure 10.2).
◾	 Click the Start button, type iexplore into the Search Programs and 
Files box, and press Enter.
Figure 10.2  Opening Internet Explorer from the Start menu.  
You can also see the Internet Explorer icon pinned to the taskbar.

271
Chapter 10: Web Basics
You can also start Internet Explorer (or your default browser, if not IE) 
by clicking a web hyperlink in an email address or document. In some 
programs, such as Microsoft Word, you have to hold down the Ctrl key 
as you click on a hyperlink to open it in a browser.
When Internet Explorer opens, it takes you to your home page. Your 
home page is the page that is presented every time you open the browser. 
By default, the browser’s home page is msn.com. You can set your home 
page to the site of your choice, however. If you use a particular site all the 
time, you can set that site as your home page. This makes browsing more 
efficient.
home page The page that is displayed when you 
first launch your web browser.
Step by Step
Changing Your Internet Explorer Home Page
To change your Internet Explorer home page, follow these steps:
	 1.	Open Internet Explorer using one of the methods listed previously.
	 2.	Type the address of the website you want to set as your home page into the address bar and allow it to load.
	 3.	Click the Tools button (the one that looks like a gear wheel in the upper-right corner of the browser screen). A 
menu appears.

	 4.	Select Internet Options. The Internet Options dialog box 
opens, with the General tab displayed.
	 5.	In the Home Page section of the General tab, click the 
Use Current button. The box above it should now contain 
the URL of the current site.
	 6.	Click the Apply button. The next time you launch the 
browser, the home page you selected will be displayed.
Accessing a Website
After you launch your web browser, you simply type a URL in the 
address field to visit the site associated with that URL. DNS will resolve 
the URL to an IP address, and you will be presented with the page you 
specified. You can then click on hyperlinks on that page to see additional 
pages and information, or to visit other sites.
Put It to Work
Identifying Secure Sites
When you browse a website that uses the HTTP protocol, everything is transmitted and received in clear text. That 
means someone using a packet sniffer (discussed in Chapter 11) could easily intercept the information. This is 
okay for normal browsing, but not when carrying out financial transactions that involve entering credit card informa-
tion or other personal details.
To make it more difficult for criminals to acquire your information, a secure encrypted connection is required when 
you are sending sensitive data. HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) provides an encrypted connection 
between the web browser and the web server. With HTTPS, the two endpoints exchange an encryption key, enabling 
the encryption of all future communication between them. When a connection uses HTTPS, the URL starts with 
https:// rather than http://, as shown. In addition, a padlock appears in the browser’s address bar, and in 
some browsers the address bar may appear with a green background. A secure connection happens automatically 
when you log into a secure site; you do not have to do anything special to initiate it.

Chapter 10: Web Basics
Going Back, Going Forward, and Refreshing
Suppose that while visiting a website, you’ve clicked several hyperlinks 
to view many different web pages. Or maybe you’ve viewed additional 
websites during the same browser session. Either way, it may be that you 
want to revisit a page that you viewed previously. To do so, simply click 
the Back button in the upper-left corner of the browser window. (It’s the 
button with a left-pointing arrow on it.) This returns you to the page 
you viewed last. Click the button multiple times to cycle back to addi-
tional viewed pages.
When you click the Back button, the Forward button becomes active 
(that is, it turns blue). The Forward button is next to the Back button 
and features a right-pointing arrow. If, after clicking the Back button, 
you want to return to the original page, you can click the Forward 
button.
You can also refresh a web page. You might do so to make sure you are 
viewing the most current version of the page. (Sometimes, if you’ve vis-
ited a web page before, your browser saves it and reloads it the next time 
you visit. This helps to speed downloads but may result in an outdated 
page being displayed.) To do so, click the Refresh button. It’s the clock-
wise circular arrow at the right end of the address bar. Figure 10.3 shows 
the Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons.
Figure 10.3  The Back, Forward, and Refresh buttons.
Engaging in e-Commerce
One of the most important and culture-changing uses for the web is as a means of conducting online financial 
business, also known as e-commerce. E-commerce can be business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), 
or consumer-to-consumer (C2C). E-commerce can include a business ordering supplies or materials from another 
business, a consumer buying a book from an online bookstore, and a friend sending money to a friend.
From the consumer perspective, e-commerce is a win-win. Thanks to e-commerce, consumers have many more 
choices. Because e-commerce is global, people can buy from retailers all around the globe 24 hours a day, with-
out leaving the comfort of their homes.
E-commerce makes economic sense for retailers as well. With e-commerce, there’s no need to maintain a brick-
and-mortar storefront. Online retailers can work from one or more large warehouses, selling and shipping a wide 
range of items.
With e-commerce, you aren’t limited to purchasing goods online. E-commerce covers all aspects of business and 
life. For example, many governments now offer services online, enabling citizens to pay their taxes, sign up for 
government services, and license their vehicles online.
When engaging in e-commerce, be sure you buy from secure sites. You’ll learn more about how to tell whether a 
site is secure in Chapter 11.

Working with Tabs
A tab enables you to have multiple web pages open at once within the 
same browser window. When you launch Internet Explorer, it displays 
your home page on a tab. To open another tab—leaving the page on the 
first tab accessible—click the New Tab button (the grey box to the right 
of the existing tab). A second tab opens, again with your home page 
displayed. You can then type a URL in the address bar to visit a different 
page as normal.
Perhaps even more useful, Internet Explorer enables you to open pages 
via a hyperlink on a separate tab. To do so, right-click the hyperlink and 
choose Open in New Tab from the menu that appears. Internet Explorer 
opens a second tab and displays the linked page on it. Figure 10.4 shows 
a browser window with multiple tabs open.

Adding Favorites (Bookmarks)
If you frequently visit a website, you might want to store it in your browser 
so you don’t have to type its URL every time you visit it. To do so, you 
can save it as a Favorite (also called a Bookmark). A favorite is a website or 
page that you visit frequently, and to which you want easy access.
favorite A website or page that you visit fre-
quently, and to which you want easy access.
Step by Step
Adding a Website to Your Favorites List
To add a website to your Favorites list, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the View Favorites, Feed, and History button in the upper-right 
corner of the browser screen. (It’s the one that looks like a star.) The 
Favorites Center pane opens. It has three tabs: Favorites, Feeds, 
and History. The Favorites Center pane also contains an Add to 
Favorites button.
	 2.	Click the Add to Favorites button. The Add a Favorite dialog box 
opens.
	 3.	Click the Add button to add the website to the Favorites tab.

Accessing Your Favorites
To access a website on your Favorites list, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the View Favorites, Feed, and History button to open the Favorites Center pane.
	 2.	If necessary, click the Favorites tab to view your Favorites list.
	 3.	Click the link for the site you want to visit. Internet Explorer opens the site.
Organizing Your Favorites in Folders
If you collect a lot of favorites, you might like to organize them in the Favorites Center pane to make them easier to find. 
One approach is to place them into folders. For example, you could place all your news-related Favorites in one folder, all 
your cooking-related Favorites in another folder, and so on.
To create a folder for your favorites, follow these steps:
	 1.	With a site you want to add to your new folder open, click the View Favorites, Feed, and History button to open the 
Favorites Center pane.
	 2.	Click the Add to Favorites button. The Add a Favorite dialog box opens.
	 3.	Click the New Folder button. The Create a Folder dialog box opens.
	 4.	Type the name of your new folder and specify the folder’s location. (You can nest folders—create them inside one 
another—if required.) Then click the Create button.
	 5.	Click Add. The folder is created and includes a link to the website you have open.
Another option is to add frequently visited websites to the Favorites bar. 
If enabled, the Favorites bar appears along the top of your browser win-
dow, just below the address bar. To enable it, right-click the title bar and 
choose Favorites Bar.
You can click a site in the Favorites bar to access it. Every new site you 
add to the Favorites bar will appear on the far-left end. When the bar is 
full, two small chevrons will appear on the right side of the bar, as shown 
in Figure 10.5. Click the chevrons to display a menu containing addi-
tional Favorites not visible on the Favorites bar.

Viewing Your Browser History
By default, Internet Explore stores a list of recently visited websites, 
called the browser history. If you forget the URL of a site you’ve visited 
recently, you may be able to access it from this list.
To view your browser history, click the down arrow on the right side of the 
address bar. A menu of previously visited sites appears. (See Figure 10.7.) 
Simply click the site you want to visit, and the browser will reload it.
Figure 10.7  Using the Browser History feature.
To view even more sites visited, you can open the Favorites Center pane 
and click the History tab. There, you can choose to view sites by date—
that is, from the current day, current week, one week ago, two weeks 
ago, or three weeks ago. (See Figure 10.8.) Or, you can open the drop-
down menu at the top of the pane and choose to view sites in alphabeti-
cal order (choose View By Site), by frequency of visit (choose View Most 
Visited), or in the order they were visited today (choose View By Order 
Visited Today). You can also search your history list by choosing Search 
History from the drop-down list, typing a search term, and clicking the 
Search Now button.
Internet Explorer automatically saves your browsing history for 20 days. 
If you like, you can change this setting. The maximum is 999 days.

browser, all history will be erased.
Downloading and Uploading Content
Internet is a vast repository of data in the same way that a library is full 
of books. Some data is for onscreen consumption only, but much of the 
data is also downloadable.
When you click a hyperlink that points to a downloadable file, a 
­dialog box may appear automatically inviting you to specify a file 
name and location on your local computer in which to save the file. 
You can also right-click the hyperlink and choose Save Target As (or 
an equivalent command, depending on the browser you are using). 
Some browsers automatically download files to a default Downloads 
folder, using the file’s default name, so you are not prompted for a 
name or location.
You can also upload content—that is, copy it from a desktop computer 
to a server on the Internet. You might do this to back up your data, stor-
ing it online on a personal storage site such as Microsoft OneDrive or 
Dropbox (also known as cloud storage). You can also use these sites to 
share data with others.
Another way to upload files for storage or sharing is to use the File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP). FTP is used solely for the transfer of files online. In the 
same way that there are web servers on the Internet, there are also FTP 
servers, maintained by businesses and individuals to enable users to 
upload and download files. Some of these are private, requiring a user 
ID and password; others are public, for distributing files that anyone 
may access.
You access an FTP site using a web browser in much the same way as a 
website; the main difference is that the address you enter into the browser 
starts with ftp:// rather than http://. You can also access an FTP site 
using an FTP application. FileZilla (www.filezilla-project.org) 
is a free FTP client that anyone may download and use. It is shown in 
Figure 10.9.

Managing Plug-ins (Add-ons)
A plug-in, also called an add-on, is a piece of software that can be added 
to a web browser to give it additional functionality, like the capability 
to view movies or Flash content. Two of the most common plug-ins are 
Adobe Shockwave Flash Object and Java.
In most cases, you do not have to search for or manually install plug-ins. 
If one is needed, your browser will display a message offering to find and 
install it for you, or will direct you to a web page where you can down-
load and install it.

browser to give it additional functionality.

	 1.	Click the Tools button in the upper-right corner of the browser window. A menu appears.
	 2.	Choose Manage Add-ons. The Managed Add-ons window appears, displaying currently installed add-ons, organized 
by type.

option of enabling or disabling that add-on.
	 4.	Click Close to close the dialog box.
Using Web-Based Applications
These days, developers can use a number of programming languages to run web-based applications within a web 
browser. A web-based application is software that is downloaded and run within the web browser rather than being 
installed directly on the user’s computer.
A good example of a web-based application Outlook.com (previously called Hotmail). You use this program to read 
and write email messages. All the messages are stored on the server, not on your computer.
Web-based applications offer developers increased flexibility. Because they are browser-based, developers can build 
applications that work regardless of operating system. Web-based applications also alleviate concerns about local 
data storage. Finally, web-based applications are easier to update; there is no need to install and maintain applica-
tions on the local level. To capitalize on this new technology, many companies are moving to a subscription-based 
model, where users pay a monthly fee to use it rather than purchasing it outright.

Using Web Search Tools
The answer to just about any question you may have is likely available on 
the Internet. The problem is knowing where to look to find it. This is 
where search engines come in. A search engine is an application that builds 
an index of sites on the Internet. Users can then search that database using 
keywords or phrases to find sites that contain the information they need.

Conducting a Search
To conduct a search in Google, you type a keyword or phrase into the 
Search field and click the blue magnifying glass button on the right. 
Google returns a list of sites that contain information matching the 
word or phrase you typed. It also shows you how many matches Google 
found, and how long it took Google to conduct the search.

283
Chapter 10: Web Basics
As shown in Figure 10.10, each entry in the list contains three pieces of 
information:
◾	 The title: This indicates the source of the information.
◾	 The URL: This is the web address for the page containing the 
information.
◾	 The text: Google shows an excerpt of the information, with the 
search words highlighted in bold.
Figure 10.10  The results of a Google search for “lapwing.”
To access a site that appears in the results, click it in the list.
Narrowing Your Search
Sometimes, you may find that a search yields too many results to be 
useful. To pare things down, try adding words to your search string. For 
example, if you type lapwing, Google finds more than 337,000 results. 
If you search instead for lapwing nesting habits, the number of results 
drops to 41,300. The longer the search phrase, the more likely it is to 
narrow down the results to a manageable number.
Advanced Search Options and Features
Some search engines offer advanced search features, and Google is no 
exception. To access these features, type http://www.google.com/
advanced_search in the browser’s address bar. You’ll see a screen 
like the one shown in Figure 10.11. Fill in any of the relevant fields to 
narrow your search. For example, fill in the This Exact Word or Phrase 
field if you want to find pages that contain that text verbatim. Or, fill in 
www.ebook777.com

the None of These Words field if you want Google to omit pages that 
contain that word from your search results. You can also narrow results 
by language, region, and more. After you enter all your search criteria, 
click the Advanced Search button to see a list of results.
Figure 10. 11  The Google Advanced Search page.
Using Search Operators
Another way to narrow your search is to enter specific search operators 
in the Search field. A search operator is a word or symbol that has a spe-
cific function when carrying out a search. These operators tell the search 
engine to follow specific instructions when it carries out the search. 
Table 10.1 outlines the most commonly used search operators.

Evaluating the Accuracy 
of Web Information
The wonderful thing about the web is that anybody can create a website 
and publish her own information. The bad thing about the web is that 
anybody can create and publish her own information.
The web can provide answers to your questions, but how do you know 
how accurate or reliable this information is? To gauge this, consider the 
source of the information. If the information appears on a website hosted 
by a university, respected institution, or reputable company, it is likely 
that the information is accurate. If not, it’s possible that the information 
is accurate, but there is no way of knowing for certain. The information 
is only as good as its source. Information on an individual’s blog, for 
example, is not usually reliable information.

Part III: Connectivity and Communication
Keep in mind that many websites are created with an agenda in mind 
that may conflict with providing objective facts. For example, someone 
selling a product may exaggerate the product’s benefits or post fictitious 
reviews, and someone promoting a certain political agenda may twist or 
intentionally misinterpret data to create an impression that supports his 
or her position.
Many web pages contain ads, and the ads are not always sectioned off 
separately from the main text; they may appear between the paragraphs 
of an article and might trick you into thinking they are part of the article. 
An ad is never a reliable source of information. Similarly, sponsored link 
are mini-ads that contain hyperlinks to other websites. Do not assume 
that a sponsored link is relevant to the topic of the article or that the 
author of the article even knows that the sponsored link is placed there.
Forums are public message boards that you access via websites. They 
may be sponsored by a particular company, such as a support forum for a 
certain kind of hardware or software, or they may be created and man-
aged by an individual. Because the posts on a forum are made by the 
general public, not by known experts, you must be cautious about apply-
ing any advice you read in forums. For example, a forum post might rec-
ommend that you download and install a certain file, but that file might 
have a virus or might cause compatibility problems on your computer. 
Some forums are monitored by official or unofficial representatives of the 
hosting company.
A knowledge base is a more reliable source of information. It is a 
set of articles provided and maintained by a company or government 
agency about its products. For example, Microsoft has a knowledge 
base in which you can look up officially approved articles about various 
Microsoft products.
Encyclopedia sites vary in their accuracy and reliability. Well-known ency-
clopedias such as Encyclopedia Britannica and World Book Encyclopedia 
may generally be thought of as accurate. However, many sites that appear 
to be encyclopedias at first glance are actually wikis. A wiki is a knowl-
edge base in which content is user-generated, so that anyone can post 
or edit entries, even someone who is not an expert on the topic or who 
has an agenda to promote. The best-known wiki is Wikipedia (www.
wikipedia.org/). While Wikipedia is a good source of basic informa-
tion on a topic, it cannot be trusted as a reliable source by itself, because 
of its nature; verify any information you learn from Wikipedia or any 
other wiki with other sources.
sponsored link A hyperlink that is placed on a 
page because a payment has been made.
forum A web-based discussion and advice-
sharing site.
knowledge base A set of articles provided and 
maintained by a company or government agency 
about its products.
wiki A web-based application that can be edited 
by anyone and that is usually informational or 
instructive in nature.

Virtual Private Networks
Suppose you work for a company that has a head office and several remote sites. The company wants to connect 
the sites to form one network, and also to allow staff to work from home using the company network. However, the 
company doesn’t want to go to the expense of running secure dedicated network cables between each person’s 
home and the company headquarters.
Virtual private networking (VPN) enables a user to create a secure connection to a remote server by going through 
the Internet. A VPN creates a secure tunnel, or pipeline, between a VPN-enabled web server and an individual com-
puter. This tunnel is very difficult to hack, so the connection is safe enough to use for sensitive data.
To connect to a VPN using Microsoft Windows, open the Network and Sharing Center (right-click the network icon in 
the notification area and choose Network and Sharing Center, or go through the Control Panel). From there, click Set 
Up a New Connection or Network, and click Connect to a Workplace. Choose Use My Internet Connection (VPN), and 
then follow the prompts to set up the connection, using the settings provided to you by the owner of the VPN server 
(your employer or school, for example).
virtual private networking (VPN) A method 
of creating a secure, private communication tunnel 
using a public communications channel such as 
the Internet.

Summary
How the Web Works
The Internet is a global network of millions of computers that can communicate with each other. 
The World Wide Web (WWW, or the web) is one part of the Internet; it is a network of inter-
connected pages of information stored on publicly accessible servers. Web pages are stored on web 
servers, and accessed by web browsers. A web page is a file that is formatted for use on the web. 
A web server is a server on which web pages are stored and made available to the public. A web 
browser is an application that can display web pages.
Most web pages are written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a coding language that 
tells the browser how to display the content. A hyperlink is a clickable link to another page.
A uniform resource locator (URL) is the address you enter into your web browser’s address bar 
to navigate to a specific web page. A URL consists of a protocol, a domain name, and, optionally, 
a path following the domain name.
A domain name is a name that identifies an entity on the Internet. It’s a key part of a URL. In its 
basic form, a domain name consists of an identifier followed by an extension, like microsoft.com. 
The extension, also called the top-level domain, is often used to identify the type of organization 
that the name represents. Some domain names also include a two-letter country code.
Every computer that connects to the Internet has its own unique numeric address, called the 
IP address.
Domain Name System (DNS) is the naming system employed to enable users to access websites 
using their domain names or URLs rather than their IP addresses. The process of mapping domain 
names to IP addresses is called name resolution and is done by DNS servers.
Accessing the Web with a Browser
To open Internet Explorer, use the shortcut on the Start menu or the taskbar, or click a web 
hyperlink in a document. The page that opens by default is the home page. Click on a hyperlink 
to go to a web page. Use the Forward and Back buttons to navigate between pages you have 
recently visited. Use the Refresh button to reload a page, or use the Stop button to stop a page 
from completing its loading. Internet Explorer enables you to have multiple tabs open at once, 
each displaying a different page.
To store a URL so you can easily recall it later, save it as a Favorite. IE maintains a list of recently 
visited sites called History. To access both favorites and history, click the View Favorites, Feed, 
and History button (which look like a star).
When you click on the hyperlink for a downloadable file, your browser downloads it, or prompts 
you for a filename and location to download it. To upload a file to a server, you can use a web-
based uploading interface, such as with Microsoft OneDrive, a type of cloud storage. You can also 
use the FTP protocol in your web browser (on some sites) or use a separate FTP application.
A plug-in (also called an add-on) is a piece of software that can be added to a web browser to give 
it additional functionality, like the capability to view movies or Flash content. If you need a plug-in 
to play a certain type of content, your browser will prompt you to install it.

Using Web Search Tools
A search engine is an application that builds an index of sites on the Internet. Users can then 
search that database using keywords or phrases to find sites that contain the information they 
need. Examples include Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.
Sometimes, you may find that a search yields too many results to be useful. Search using multiple 
keywords to narrow down a search, or use search operators. Different search engines support dif-
ferent operators.
To gauge the accuracy of information you find on the web, consider the source of the information. 
Forums, ads, sponsored links, and blogs are all unreliable sources. Knowledge bases and official com-
pany sites are generally more reliable. A wiki may contain accurate information or not; it is not reliable.

Identifying the Path from Source to Destination
To see happens when you type a URL into a web browser to visit a web page, you can use the 
tracert command. It traces the path from the browser to the website, noting all the devices it goes 
through en route.
	
1.	Click the Start button, type cmd into the Search Programs and Files box, and press Enter. 
A command prompt window opens.
	
2.	At the command prompt, type tracert followed by a space and then the URL for the website 
of your choice (for example, www.bbc.co.uk) and press Enter. The command prompt 
window will list all the devices that your request travels through before it gets to the chosen 
destination. The program will also list the IP address of each device. When the process com-
pletes, the window will say “Trace Complete.”
As you can see, when you send the request, it leaves your computer, goes through your router, 
and then passes through a series of other devices between your browser and the destination. 
Notice that your request can probably get from one side of the world to the other in about 
15 stages or hops—sometimes fewer.

Part III: Connectivity and Communication
TIP
Try using tracert with www.disney.com as the target. As the request moves from 
device to device, see if you can identify the cities through which your request travels 
based on the names of the devices it passes.
Decoding URLs
When you visit a website, look at the complete path of the URL, including any folder names. Try 
different pages on the site and see if you can map how the site is laid out based on the different 
folder names you see.
Exploring DNS Name Resolution
DNS name resolution is a process that happens automatically whenever you type a URL into the 
web browser. This exercise enables you to see which DNS server you are using:
	
1.	Click the Start button, type cmd into the Search Programs and Files box, and press Enter. A 
command prompt window opens.
	
2.	At the command prompt, type nslookup, followed by a space and then the URL for the 
website you want to visit (for example, type nslookup www.google.com) and press Enter. 
The command prompt window lists the name and address of the DNS server you are using, 
followed by Google’s IP address. If you see more than one address in this part of the results, 
it means the DNS knows about five different Google servers. Your browser usually will go to 
the first one in the list, but if it is not available, your browser will go to the second, and so on.
Think It Over
Evaluating Web Browsers
Imagine you are working for an organization that uses Windows computers and notebooks. Users 
have been allowed to download any software they like onto these computers, including different 
browsers. This creates a problem for the support department, so your supervisor has asked you to 
evaluate possible web browsers so that all computers can be standardized with one program. What 
browsers might you evaluate? What features might you consider most important?

Network and Internet 
Security Concerns
Computer crime is becoming increasingly common. It is relatively easy 
to attack computers to cause disruption or steal data. In fact, this can 
be carried out over a network or the Internet with low risk of the crime 
being traced back to the perpetrator.
Because of the ease with which attacks can be launched, it is essential that 
you remain aware of security and take the necessary steps to secure your 
data and online identity.
Computer security is built around upholding three basic goals:
◾	 Confidentiality. Your data should be visible and accessible only to 
those whom you choose to see it.
◾	 Integrity. The data you see and store should be reliable and 
accurate, and should not be tampered with. You need to be able to 
trust this data.
◾	 Availability. Your data should be accessible when you want it, 
including after a mishap or disaster.
The threat assessment and security measures discussed in this chapter 
center around the need to uphold these three goals.
Security Threats Posed 
by Computer Criminals
Computer criminals engage in many types of activities that can compro-
mise your computer system, your data, and your online identity.
Careers in IT
Security Specialist
Computer security is among the biggest growth 
areas in IT. With this comes a growing demand 
for engineers who have the skills to protect 
computers and networks. Security specialists 
are responsible for ensuring that all the security 
devices in a company are correctly configured. 
These specialists must also be able to spot dif-
ferent types of attacks and know how to respond 
to each one.
To work in this area, you will need to master skills 
such as understanding operating systems and 
networks. You will also need good computer quali-
fications from a college or university, plus indus-
try certifications from companies like CompTIA 
and EC Council. Finally, you will need experience 
in other areas of IT, such as troubleshooting and 
support, before you can move into this role.

Chapter 11: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Phishing
One of the common threats—and one that is also easy to carry out—is 
phishing. In a phishing attack, offenders send email messages to unsus-
pecting users in an attempt to trick them into giving away personal 
information such as login details or credit card information. The attack-
ers then use this information to conduct fraudulent activity. This type of 
attack is often successful because the email messages appear to be from a 
trustworthy source, such as a bank or other reputable organization.
phishing The act of attempting to acquire infor-
mation such as usernames, passwords, credit card 
information, and so forth, by pretending to be from 
a genuine, trustworthy source such as a bank.
CAUTION
Legitimate banks and other companies will never send an email asking you to submit sensitive personal 
information online. Never click on the links in such emails. As a good Internet citizen, you should report the 
emails to the bank or other company to make it aware of the phishing attempts.
Phishing emails are getting more sophisticated and harder to recognize, 
but here are some considerations that will help you identify them:
◾	 Do you actually have an account with that bank or company? If 
not, then it’s reasonable to assume the message is an attempt at 
phishing.
◾	 Check the source of the email. Does the email address match the 
organization’s standard email address? Check not only the address 
that appears as text in the message, but also the address that 
appears as a ScreenTip when you point the mouse at it.
◾	 If you hover over the link to the company website with your 
mouse, it shows you the true URL. Is the address correct?
◾	 Are there grammar and spelling mistakes? Does the message appear 
in the language you would expect? Even if the body text is in the 
expected language, are there buttons or other details with text in 
another language? These are all indications of a possible attempt at 
phishing.
◾	 Check for the presence of the security padlock icon in the address 
bar. The presence of the security padlock icon is an indication that 
the message may be genuine—although it is not a guarantee.
Finally, remember that real companies and banks never ask for personal 
information in this way.
CAUTION
In April 2014, security experts discovered a security bug that affected Internet users worldwide. Called 
“Heartbleed,” the bug placed around half a million of the world’s secure servers—the ones indicated by the 
aforementioned security padlock icon—vulnerable to attack, placing the servers’ private keys and users’ 
session cookies and passwords at risk. Most sites quickly patched the problem, but sensitive data for many 
users was vulnerable in the interim.

Figure 11.1 shows an example of a phishing email. The message claims 
to be from Apple, telling a user that his Apple account has been sus-
pended. Notice that the email is from service@id-appactivate.
com. The address doesn’t end in @apple.com.
Figure 11.1  An example of a phishing email.
CAUTION
Recipients of phishing emails should delete them without opening them. If they do open the mail, they 
should not click on the embedded link.
Password Cracking
When you log in to a computer or connect to an account on the 
Internet, you identify who you are with a username or number and you 
authenticate your identity, typically with a password. Passwords are the 
most common method of authentication because they are easy to use 
and maintain. Most systems and programs allow users to choose their 
own passwords, provided the passwords satisfy the system or program’s 
security policy.

Chapter 11: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
It may be relatively easy to 
determine someone’s user-
name. However, finding out 
someone’s password is often 
much more difficult. People 
who want to break into a sys-
tem or account often attempt 
password cracking—that 
is, they attempt to identify 
a user’s password. Password 
cracking can be accomplished 
in several ways, for example, 
by guessing, using a keylog-
ger (see Figure 11.2), engag-
ing in social engineering, 
and using password-cracking tools.
Malicious Programs
As noted in the preceding section, computer criminals engage in a wide 
variety of activities to compromise your computer system, data, and 
online identity. They are aided in their efforts by various types of mali-
cious software, grouped together under the title malware. This section 
outlines the main types of malware programs.
Viruses
A virus is a piece of malicious software that is installed without the user’s 
knowledge or consent. When executed, the virus program replicates and 
spreads to “infect” other computer programs, data files, or even the boot 
sector of the hard drive.
Viruses often carry a malicious payload. For example, a boot-sector virus 
might stop the computer from loading the operating system. Some viruses 
might delete all files of a certain type—for example, Word ­documents. 
Other viruses may simply have annoying consequences—perhaps opening 
and closing the CD drawer. Some viruses hide as long as they can so they 
can do as much damage as possible before being discovered. New viruses 
appear virtually every day, so it is vital that you take precautions and pro-
tect yourself from them.
The most common way for a virus to spread is for a user to open an 
infected email attachment or Internet link without having virus protec-
tion in place. This allows the malicious software to gain access to the sys-
tem. If the infected file is sitting in RAM memory and you run another 
program, the virus attaches a copy of itself to the second program—and 
so on and so forth.
Worms
A worm is similar to a virus in that it may have a malicious payload. 
However, worms are designed to automatically spread from computer to 
computer over a network or the Internet. Like viruses, the consequences 
password cracking The act of attempting to 
identify a user’s password in order to gain access 
to a system or program.
keylogger A piece of hardware or a software pro-
gram that captures every keystroke a user types.
social engineering The art of obtaining 
someone’s password either by befriending her or 
tricking her into sharing it.
malware Harmful or maliciously created soft-
ware, such as a virus or spyware.
virus A type of malware that attaches itself to an 
executable file and spreads to other files when the 
program is run.
worm A malicious computer program that 
spreads itself to other computers over a network 
or the Internet.

of worms range from destructive to annoying. A worm might delete files 
or direct users to a fake website, or it might just do something annoying 
like swapping left and right mouse button actions. At the very least, a 
worm will consume network bandwidth.
CAUTION
Some worms are designed to compromise the user’s email address book and send itself to all the user’s 
contacts. If you receive an odd or unexpected message from one of your contacts, it could indicate that 
her address book has been infected by a worm. Before opening the email, contact the sender to determine 
whether the email is legitimate and to alert her to the possibility that her machine has been infected.
Trojans
According to Greek mythology, the Greeks conquered the city of Troy 
through trickery. They constructed a large wooden horse, which they 
presented to the Trojans as a gift. Unbeknownst to the Trojans, however, 
the Greeks had hidden a select team of soldiers inside the horse. After 
the Trojans dragged the horse inside the city walls, the Greek soldiers 
emerged from the horse and opened the city gates, enabling the rest of 
the Greek army to swarm the town.
It is after this horse, called the Trojan horse, that Trojans are named. A 
Trojan is a piece of software, such as a game or utility, that may look 
innocent but has a malicious purpose. Typically, the user knowingly 
installs the game or utility, but doesn’t realize there’s a Trojan inside. 
When the user runs the program, the Trojan starts running in the back-
ground, often without the user’s knowledge.
A Trojan can do nasty things to a computer, but more likely it is there to 
gather information. For example, many Trojan programs are keyloggers. 
As described, a keylogger records all the keys the user presses on the 
keyboard and saves them in a file. It then sends the file with the user’s 
keystrokes to the person or group who sent the Trojan. In this way, 
whoever sent the Trojan can learn what the user does on the computer. 
More importantly, they can uncover the user’s username and password, 
enabling them to log in themselves.
A common type of Trojan is one that displays a screen that recommends 
that you purchase and download some type of anti-malware software, as 
shown in Figure 11.3. In this case, however, the software is fake and will 
probably put more Trojans on your computer. Worse, if you buy it, the 
thieves will then have your credit card details.
Another type of Trojan runs spyware. Spyware is software that moni-
tors what the user does on the computer without her knowledge. It then 
sends the information it gathers to a third party, which uses it to target 
the user with pop-up advertisements—often for fake products.
Trojan A piece of malicious software that looks 
harmless but has a detrimental effect on a com-
puter when it runs.
spyware A type of malware that spies on the 
user’s activities and reports them back to the 
spyware’s developer.

Figure 11.3  A Trojan advertising fake anti-virus software.
Ransomware
Some new, very nasty Trojans are called ransomware. These Trojans encrypt files on the system, such as photos, 
music, and documents. The Trojan then displays a message describing how to get the files back. Retrieval inevitably 
involves sending a payment over the Internet to an unknown destination with the promise that once the money is 
received, you will receive the key to unlock your files. The key doesn’t exist and the damage is already done, however. 
You will not get your files unlocked. Your best protection against ransomware is to frequently back up your system on 
an external hard drive. That way, if you fall prey to this type of Trojan, you can simply copy the files from your backup 
drive. You’ll learn more about backing up your system later in this chapter.

Protecting Yourself against Malware
The earliest anti-virus programs were designed to detect and protect 
against viruses, but have improved over the years into broader security 
solutions that can detect viruses, worms, Trojans, and sometimes more 
complex threats. A good anti-virus package provides a wide range of pro-
tective measures and may include firewall management (discussed later in 
this chapter) and anti-spyware as well.
Many good anti-virus products are in the marketplace: Symantec, 
Sophos, Kaspersky, and McAfee are among the most popular security 
solutions. They all work in a similar way and produce similar results. In 
addition, Microsoft has its own product, called Security Essentials. You 
can also find free anti-virus software, such as AVG (see Figure 11.4) or 
ClamWin. Free products usually have a more limited range of services 
than the commercial choices, but in some cases, you can upgrade to a 
paid version for expanded offerings.
Figure 11.4  Free anti-virus soft-ware.
DoS Attacks and Zombies
In a denial of service (DoS) attack, the attacker floods a website or ser-
vice with thousands of requests for access—so many that it cannot deal 
with them all. As a result, legitimate users are prevented from accessing 
the site or service. DoS attacks often involve many thousands of com-
puters from all over the world, all launching multiple requests against 
the target website or service, making them difficult to prevent. Once an 
attack is started, it can render the target site unavailable very quickly.
The computers that launch these attacks are called zombies. A zombie is 
a computer that has been infected with a particular type of Trojan called 
a bot. Initially, the bot runs in the background, doing very little beyond 
communicating with its master over the Internet every now and then, 
awaiting instructions. One day, it, along with thousands of other bots, 
receives instructions to bombard a particular website as part of a DoS 
attack. This is called a botnet. Millions of computers around the world 
are part of multiple botnets, all used for DoS attacks.
denial of service (DoS) attack A coordi-
nated attack in which the target website or service 
is flooded with requests for access, to the point 
that it is completely overwhelmed.
zombie A computer used to conduct a DoS 
attack.
bot A type of Trojan, used to infect a zombie 
computer to conduct a DoS attack.
botnet A network of zombie computers infected 
with bots, often numbering in the thousands. 
Computer criminals use botnets to conduct DoS 
attacks.
ransomware A type of Trojan that encrypts files 
on a user’s system. It then displays a message 
describing how to decrypt the files—which inevi-
tably involves sending payment over the Internet. 
Even after the money is sent, however, the files are 
not decrypted.

Wi-Fi Networks
Hackers frequently target Wi-Fi networks. When Wi-Fi networks are 
not properly secured, it is easy to steal data on them with little chance of 
being caught. Hackers don’t even need any special equipment to pen-
etrate such a Wi-Fi network.
When people use their devices 
to locate and connect to a 
wireless network, they see a 
list of available networks, as 
shown in Figure 11.5. Some 
of these networks may be open 
access, meaning you don’t 
need a password to connect. 
Others may require a password 
and will provide users with a 
secure connection. Insecure 
networks are identified with 
a small exclamation mark; the 
other networks have encrypted 
connections.
Some wireless networks 
appear to be genuine, but in 
fact attempt to intercept your 
traffic. These types of Wi-Fi 
networks are called rogue 
Wi-Fi. These Wi-Fi networks 
usually seem authentic, often with a name that is similar or the same as a 
legitimate network. The difference? This network “sniffs” all your traffic, 
making a copy of everything you type—including any usernames, pass-
words, and credit card numbers.
Public places where many people are looking for Wi-Fi, such as coffee 
shops, restaurants, and airports, are common locations for rogue Wi-Fi 
connections. How can you tell whether a Wi-Fi network to which you 
want to connect is in fact rogue? It’s not easy. If you are directed to a 
“Terms of Service” page after you connect, that’s a good indication that 
the network is legitimate. A time limit is another sign that the net-
work may be genuine. But your best bet is to simply ask someone who 
works at the location whether it offers Wi-Fi, and if so, the name of the 
network.

Network and Internet 
Privacy Concerns
The Internet has changed the way people live, learn, and communicate. 
While the Internet offers enormous power to communicate and to find 
information, it also makes us more vulnerable to invasions of privacy. The 
Internet consists of vast amounts of data spread globally across millions 
of websites; thanks to the sheer size and scope of the Internet, it’s impos-
sible to know how all this information is stored and how private it is!
Here are just a few of the ways in which using networks and the Internet 
can put your privacy at risk:
◾	 When you use a search engine, the search engine site can gather 
information about you based on the terms you search for and the 
questions you ask.
◾	 When you provide personal information on the Internet—such as 
your name, address, email, and so forth—to a website, that website 
can store the information and perhaps use it for purposes other 
than those you intended.
CAUTION
Be aware of the personal information you make available online. That information may spread far beyond the 
sites you contact directly!
◾	 Your computer has a unique identity. Someone who knows this 
unique identity can access your computer via a network and view, 
change, or delete your personal data.
Data Storage
When you store data on your computer, you store it as files. As the num-
ber of files grows, it becomes harder to locate the data you want. This is 
where databases come in. A database stores data in a way that enables 
you to search for and locate it quickly.
There are millions of databases worldwide that, together, store billions 
of files. Often, these files contain information about individuals. For 
example, large companies have databases that contain information about 
their customers. Similarly, social networks like Facebook have huge data-
bases to store the information about their users. If these networks are 
vulnerable to unauthorized access, sensitive data for many people may be 
compromised.
Most of this data is stored by private companies, and we rely upon them 
to handle personal data with care. Everything should be based on the 
principle of least privilege—that is, you give people minimum access for 
the jobs they have to do. If you request data about yourself, that is all 
you should see—no one else’s details.
database A collection of data stored in a struc-
tured format, with the same facts stored about 
each instance. A database stores data in a way 
that enables you to search and locate it quickly.

Chapter 11: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Privacy Laws
To protect people’s privacy, there are rules to govern how personal 
information is handled. Most countries have data protection and privacy 
laws to control the access and distribution of this personal information. 
These laws are needed to regulate the companies that hold our personal 
information and to ensure that all our information is properly protected.
Different countries have different rules, but most require that any per-
sonal information stored is:
◾	 Used only for the intended purpose
◾	 Accurate 
◾	 Sufficient for the purpose, with no unnecessary information held
◾	 Accessible by the owner
◾	 Obtained legally
◾	 Kept secure from unauthorized access
◾	 Deleted when no longer needed
Understanding Social Networking Risks
A social network is an Internet-based system that enables users to inter-
act in real time and by using messaging programs. With a social network, 
users can share every aspect of their lives with others. Examples of social 
networks include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
While sharing information via social networks can be wonderful, it is not 
without its risks. It is easy to get carried away on social networks and 
publish information about yourself that would be better kept private. 
Before you publish too much information about yourself, you must 
consider just who can see that data. After you have published it, it is very 
difficult—if not impossible—to remove it from the Internet.
social network An Internet-based system that 
enables users to interact in real-time and by using 
messaging programs.
CAUTION
Never leave a computer or laptop without logging out of any social network sites you have open. If you remain 
logged in, someone else could post information while pretending to be you.
Social networks pose another risk—namely, that some of the “friends” 
you make online may not be who they say they are. Be careful how much 
you reveal about yourself to such people. Remember: A social network 
is global, your new “friends” could be anywhere, and some of them may 
ask you to do things you shouldn’t.
CAUTION
Never agree to meet in person someone you’ve met online unless you bring a friend with you for protection 
and meet in a very public place, like a coffee shop.

Deleting Cookies
When you visit some websites, they place a cookie on your computer. 
A cookie is a small file that stores information about your interaction 
with the website. When you revisit the site, the site reads the cookie on 
your computer to identify you. Figure 11.6 shows where cookies reside 
in a Windows 7 system, while Figure 11.7 shows examples of actual 
cookies. Just one visit to a website can result in the installation of several 
cookies on your computer.

Cyberbullying
Social networks have become part of our everyday lives—particularly among young people. Indeed, millions of 
young people spend time on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social network sites, often to 
stay in touch with friends.
Sometimes, however, what starts as a fun activity—interacting with friends online—turns ugly. Someone makes 
unpleasant comments about you online. Others join the conversation. People might even post rumors or altered 
images of you in an attempt to harass you. This is called cyberbullying—and it’s a growing problem.
What should you do if you are being cyberbullied? The most important thing is to tell someone who can help. If 
you are being bullied at school or in the workplace, then your instructor or employer needs to know about it. He or 
she may be able to take action to stop it. Of course, telling others about the cyberbullying may be difficult because 
some of the comments may be hurtful or embarrassing. But it is important to let people know it is happening. You 
can’t just ignore it and hope it will go away. All that does is empower the bullies.
cyberbullying Using computers and the Internet 
to deliberately harass or harm others by making 
malicious statements.

While this can sometimes be handy—for example, for sites that you’ve 
personalized—it’s not always a good thing. For example, some cookies 
contain personal information that a hacker could use to gain access to 
a website while pretending to be you. The hacker could then use your 
PayPal or credit card information in a fraudulent manner, for example. 
Or, a hacker could trick you into downloading a Trojan that steals your 
cookies and sends them to the hacker’s computer, enabling him to use 
them at will.
To prevent this, you can delete cookies, and prevent your computer from 
storing them in the future. If you do so, the next time you go to a web-
site, it will not be able to identify you because there will be no cookies 
on your computer. While this may be frustrating on occasion—you may 
have to input information all over again—it can be a safer way to use the 
Internet. When you delete or disable cookies, you no longer leave a trail 
of information that others could use for malicious purposes.
Step by Step
Deleting and Disabling Cookies in Internet Explorer
To delete and disable cookies in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
	 1.	Open Internet Explorer.
	 2.	Click the Tools button (the one with a cog wheel icon, located in the upper-right corner of the window) and choose 
Internet Options from the menu that appears.
	 3.	The Internet Options dialog box opens with the General 
tab displayed. Under Browsing History, click the Delete 
button.
	 4.	The Delete Browsing History dialog box opens. Ensure 
that the Cookies and Website Data check box is checked 
and then click the Delete button. This deletes all cookies 
currently stored on your system.
	 5.	To prevent your system from storing additional cookies, 
select the Delete Browsing History on Exit check box in 
the Internet Options dialog box.
	 6.	Click the Apply button. Then click OK.

Strategies for Improving Security
How can you improve security? Some of the work is done for you by 
operating system vendors, who typically add security features when they 
produce new versions of an operating system. For example, Microsoft 
Windows now has a built-in firewall, and Microsoft offers its own anti-virus 
security products. The operating system is also more secure thanks to better 
login mechanisms and fewer vulnerabilities. There is still some work you 
can do, however. For example, you can restrict access to data, use encryp-
tion, protect against data loss, update your operating system, and more.
Restricting Access
Perhaps the easiest and most effective security measure you can take is 
to restrict access to the data on your computer. You can do this by using 
passwords, applying permissions, and enabling firewalls.
Using Passwords
When Windows is installed on a computer with only one user account, it 
does not require the use of a password to log in to the operating system. 
When you start the computer, it takes you straight to the desktop. That 
means anybody could start the computer and see what is stored on it as 
well as run programs without permission. This is not a good practice.
It’s critical to create a strong password for your computer. That way, 
no one who does not know the password can log in. A strong password 
should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special characters such as @ or #, and be difficult or impossible for other 
people to guess. An example of a weak password might be “manchester.” 
You could easily strengthen the password, however, by changing out 
some of the letters for other characters, like this: “M@nch35Ter.” You 
should, of course, create a password that you can remember, and also 
change the password on a regular basis.
Step by Step
Creating or Changing Your Password
To create or change a password on a Windows computer, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel, click User Accounts and Family Safety.
	 3.	Under User Accounts, click Change Your Windows Password.
	 4.	The Make Changes to Your User Account screen appears. Click Change Your Password.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
307
Chapter 11: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
	 5.	If you are changing your password, type your current password in the Current Password field. Then type your new 
password in the New Password field, and type it again in the Confirm Password field. If you are creating a pass-
word for the first time, type it in the New Password and Confirm Password fields.
	 6.	If you want, type a password hint in the Password Hint field.
	 7.	Click the Change Password button.
TIP
You should create similarly strong passwords for any accounts you create on the Internet. That way, you 
ensure no one “cracks” your password and accesses your online accounts.
Locking the Computer
If you’re logged in to a computer, you should never leave it unattended, even for a few minutes. If you do, someone 
could easily access your files, install a Trojan, or send an improper email as if it was from you. One simple security 
measure you can take to prevent this is to lock your computer when you are away from the machine.
You can lock your computer in one of two ways. One is to press the Ctrl+Alt+Del keys at the same time. You will be 
presented with an options screen; select the Lock This Computer option to lock the computer. Alternatively, press the 
Windows+L keys at the same time. To unlock the computer, simply enter your system password, as shown here.
Privacy and Security
Sharing Folders with Permissions
If your Windows computer will have more than one regular user, you can 
create a user account for each person. Each user can choose to share some 
of his folders with other users on the computer, without granting access 
to all the data in his account. You can also share folders and files with 
other users over a network. This is done through the use of permissions.
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
308
Part III: Connectivity and Communication
Before you start assigning permissions to share data with others, you 
should consider what you wish to share and how much access to allow. 
For example, you can set a folder’s or file’s permissions to give others 
access to its contents, but not allow them to change the contents. Or, 
you could set a folder’s or file’s permissions such that others can add, 
change, and/or delete items.
Be cautious when sharing folders and files with others. Give people only 
the level of access they need—and no more.
Using a Firewall
A firewall is a security barrier on your computer or network that con-
trols what traffic is allowed into and out of your computer or network. 
The barrier is designed to separate your computer or network, which you 
trust, from an external network, which you might not.
Computers that run later versions of the Windows operating system 
include a firewall application by default, called Windows Firewall.
firewall A security barrier on your computer or 
network that controls what traffic is allowed to 
pass through.
CAUTION
Do not disable the firewall unless you have another form of protection in place. If you don’t have an active 
firewall, your computer or network will be exposed to all sorts of threats that could damage your computer or 
cause you to lose files or data.
Encrypting Data
When you store data on a hard drive, the data is written such that it 
can be read by anyone who has access to the drive, which means that 
your data is vulnerable. Fortunately, there are ways to protect your 
data so that only you can access it. One method is to use encryption. 
Encryption involves using a mathematical process to scramble data to 
such an extent it is impossible to read . . . unless you have the key. The 
key unscrambles or decrypts the data so that it is readable again. When 
you use encryption on your computer, you work as normal; the encryp-
tion and decryption processes take place in the background.
encrypt To scramble the contents of a file so it 
cannot be read without the required permission 
to decrypt it.
decrypt To reverse the encryption of a file so that 
the file appears in its original form again. 
CAUTION
Don’t save the recovery key on the hard drive you have just encrypted. You won’t be able to read it if you lose 
the password!

Chapter 11: Network and Internet Privacy and Security
Preventing Data Loss
Security is not just about preventing unauthorized access to your data. 
It’s also about protecting your data from damage or loss. To facilitate 
this level of security, you must be sure to store at least one copy of your 
data somewhere safe. One approach is to connect an external hard drive 
to your computer and copy all your important files onto it. This is called 
“making a backup,” or “backing up.” After you have backed up the data, 
you must store the drive somewhere safe. You should back up your sys-
tem on a regular basis. That way, you know you have copies if something 
goes wrong.
Windows comes with a built-in backup utility, Windows Backup, that 
you can use to back up your files and also restore them in the event of 
damage or loss.
Step by Step
Setting Up Windows Backup to Perform Automatic Backups
To set up Windows Backup to back up your files automatically on a regular basis, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, click the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore.
	 4.	The first time you run Windows Backup, you must set it up. To begin, click the Set Up Backup link.
	 5.	Specify the drive on which you want to save your backup (usually an external drive for safekeeping). Then click Next.
	
	 If you prefer, you can save the backup to a network location rather than a hard drive. To do so, click Save on a 
Network. Then enter the network location’s file path in the Network Location field. (If you don’t know the path, click 
Browse, locate and select the folder on the network in which you want to save your backup, and click OK.) Finally, 
enter the appropriate username and password to access the network in the Username and Password fields and 
click OK.
Encrypting Internet Communications
In addition to encrypting your hard drive and the individual files on it, some websites enable you to encrypt your 
Internet communications. To determine whether an Internet connection is secure, check to see whether the 
URL starts with https rather than http or look for a padlock icon in the web browser’s address bar. (The padlock 
icon appears to the right of the URL in Internet Explorer and to the left in Firefox, as shown here.) Both indicate 
a secure connection between your computer and the website; data captured between these two points will be 
unreadable. (That said, see the Caution about the Heartbleed virus earlier in this chapter.)

	 6.	Specify what files you want to back up. Note that you can let Windows choose (recommended) or choose yourself. 
Then click Next.
	 7.	The Review Your Backup Settings screen summarizes your settings, including when and how often backups will 
occur. To change the backup schedule, click the Change Schedule link.
	 8.	The How Often Do You Want to Back Up screen appears. Make sure the Run Backup on a Schedule check box is 
selected.
	 9.	Click the How Often drop-down list and choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. If you chose Weekly or Monthly, also click 
the What Day drop-down list and choose the day on which backups should occur.
	10.	Click the What Time drop-down list and specify the hour on which backups should occur.
	11.	Click OK to close the How Often Do You Want to Back Up? screen. Then click Save Settings and Run Backup in the 
Review Your Backup Settings screen. Windows launches the backup operation; subsequent backups will occur on 
the schedule you specified.
Performing a Manual Backup with Windows Backup
You don’t have to wait for your system to back up automatically. You can also perform a manual backup. You might do so 
if you’re about to make a system change, or if your computer was turned off when the automatic backup was scheduled 
to occur. To perform a manual backup, follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, select the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore. The Backup or Restore Your Files screen appears.
	 4.	Click Back Up Now to launch the backup operation.

Installing Operating System Updates
When you buy a computer, it usually comes with an operating system 
preinstalled so you can start work straightaway. The version of the 
operating system that is installed is typically the version that was available 
when the computer was manufactured. Operating systems are constantly 
being updated, however. Many of the improvements made to operating 
systems after their initial release pertain to fixing bugs and patching secu-
rity holes—hence, the use of the word “patches” to describe these fixes. 
Restoring Files with Windows Backup
If you’ve used Windows Backup to back up the files and folders on your computer, you can restore the backed-up files 
and folders in the event of system failure or some other disaster. To restore the files, first connect the medium on which 
the backed-up files are stored. For example, if you stored the backed-up files and folders on an external hard drive, you 
must connect it to your PC. Then follow these steps:
	 1.	Click the Windows Start button and choose Control Panel.
	 2.	In the Control Panel window, select the System and Security option.
	 3.	In the System and Security window, click Backup and Restore. The Backup or Restore Your Files screen appears.
	 4.	Click Restore My Files. Windows launches the Restore Files Wizard.
	 5.	To restore all folders and files in your system, click Browse for Folders. A Browse dialog box appears.
	 6.	Click the folder containing the backup of your hard drive and click Add Folder. The folder is added to the Restore 
Files Wizard’s list of items to restore; click Next.
	
	 If you need to restore only certain files, click Browse for Files instead of Browse for Folders. Then locate and 
select the files you want to restore.
	 7.	Select the In the Original Location radio button to restore the folder to its original location on your hard drive.
	 8.	Click Restore. Windows restores the files, notifying you when the restore operation is complete. Click Finish.
Backing Up to “the Cloud”
In addition to backing up data to an external hard drive or network location, you can also back it up to “the 
cloud”—that is, to a data storage site on the Internet. When you back up your files to the Internet, you can 
access them from anywhere. Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is an example of one such site. After you 
set it up, it appears as a local folder on your computer. (Chapter 3 provides more information about Microsoft 
OneDrive.) Other examples of data storage sites in the cloud are Google Drive and Dropbox. All these storage 
providers offer users a certain amount of free storage with the option to buy additional capacity as needed. You 
could even be extra cautious and back up to both a hard drive and to a storage site in the cloud. That way, if 
something happens to one of your backups, you still have another copy of the data.

It’s critical that you install updates to your computer’s operating system 
(and to the programs that run on it) to ensure that all the most recent 
patches are applied.
Software manufacturers can distribute a patch as a single update to a 
program or as a group of updates to several programs. Periodically, 
Microsoft groups several patches together and produces a package 
called a service pack. A service pack contains all the patches released 
either since the product was launched or since the last service pack was 
released. To determine whether any service packs have been installed on 
your Windows computer, open the Control Panel and select the System 
and Security option. Then click System to see the current status of your 
operating system. (See Figure 11.8.)
Figure 11.8  Windows 7 running with Service Pack 1.
To make it easier for you to keep your system up to date, Microsoft offers the 
Windows Update tool. To access it, open the Control Panel, click System

can click on the links to choose from the following options:
◾	 Check for Updates: Select this option to perform an immediate 
check for new updates.
◾	 Change Settings: Choose this option to specify how and when 
updates are installed.
◾	 View Update History: To see when updates were installed, select 
this option.
◾	 Restore Hidden Updates: This option enables you to install 
updates that you have chosen not to install previously.

The simplest way to manage updates is to allow your system to install 
them automatically; you can select that option by choosing Change 
Settings in the navigation bar at the left and then adjusting the settings 
on the Choose How Windows Can Install Updates screen that appears. 
If your system has not installed an available update, you will see a mes-
sage in the notification area at the bottom-right corner of the screen, 
indicating that updates are available.
Wiping Old Drives
In Chapter 5, “Introduction to Windows 7,” you learned how to delete 
files. You may not have realized, however, that when you delete files 
from a computer, you do not delete the data in those files. Instead, you 
delete the information about where to find the data on the hard drive. 
Many software programs can recover files that have been deleted. That’s 
good news if the files were deleted by mistake. But it’s bad news if some-
one in possession of your hard drive—for example, someone who obtains 
it after you have disposed of it—uses one of these programs to recover 
files you deleted on purpose.
To permanently remove files from your hard drive, you must use a soft-
ware program that erases the hard drive permanently and securely. These 
programs work by writing a series of patterns over the entire disk so that 
all existing data is overwritten and cannot be recovered. Several good 
programs perform this task. Some are even available free of charge, such 
as Active@ KillDisk for Windows (see Figure 11.10) and Eraser.
If you want to dispose of a hard drive, even if only to give it to a friend, 
it’s important to remove all traces of personal information from the drive 
by running one of these programs on it beforehand. That way, you can 
be sure that the hard drive is blank, and there is no chance that anyone 
else could recover your data.

Summary
Network and Internet Security Concerns
Computer crime is becoming increasingly common. It is essential that you be aware of computer 
security and take the necessary steps to secure your data and online identity.
Computer criminals engage in many types of activities that can compromise your computer system, 
your data, and your online identity. One of the common threats is phishing. In this type of attack, 
nefarious users try to trick unsuspecting users into giving away personal information such as login 
details or credit card information. 
Often, the goal of hackers or crackers is to obtain a user’s password. To do so, they often attempt 
password cracking—that is, they attempt to identify a user’s password. Password cracking can be 
accomplished in several ways, including guessing, using a keylogger to record the user’s key-
strokes, social engineering, sniffing, or using any one of a variety of password-cracking tools.
Many computer criminals employ malware—that is, malicious software—in their efforts to 
compromise a user’s computer system, data, and online identity. There are several types of mal-
ware, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware. To protect yourself against 
malware, you must run a security program. Although these programs are often called “anti-virus 
programs,” they have evolved over the years into a broader security solution that can detect and 
protect against viruses, worms, Trojans, and sometimes more complex threats. A good anti-virus 
package provides a wide range of protective measures and may include firewall management and 
anti-spyware. Many good anti-virus products are in the marketplace, including Symantec, Sophos, 
Kaspersky, and McAfee.
Anti-virus programs are less effective against denial of service (DoS) attacks. In this type of 
attack, the attacker floods a website or service with thousands of requests for access—so many 
that the site or service cannot deal with them all. As a result, legitimate users are prevented from 
accessing the site or service. The computers that launch these attacks are called zombies. A zom-
bie is a computer that has been infected with a particular type of Trojan called a bot.
Users should also be wary of Wi-Fi networks. When Wi-Fi networks are not properly secured, it is 
easy to steal data on them with little chance of being caught. It’s not just un-secure networks that 
pose a risk, however. Some wireless networks appear to be genuine, but in fact attempt to inter-
cept your traffic. These types of Wi-Fi networks are called rogue Wi-Fi. Public places where many 
people are looking for Wi-Fi, such as coffee shops, restaurants, and airports, are common locations 
for rogue Wi-Fi connections.
Network and Internet Privacy Concerns
Using networks and the Internet can put your privacy at risk in a number of ways. For example, 
search engine sites can gather information about you based on the terms you search for and the 
questions you ask. In addition, websites for which you provide personal information, such as your 
name, address, email, and so forth, can store that information and perhaps use it for purposes 
other than those you intended. Finally, someone who ascertains the unique identity of your com-
puter can use this information to access your computer via a network and view, change, or delete 
your personal data.

To protect people’s privacy, most countries have data protection and privacy laws to control the 
access and distribution of this personal information. These laws regulate the companies that hold 
our personal information and ensure that all our information is properly protected.
Of course, just because there are laws designed to protect your privacy online does not mean that 
you should not take additional steps to keep yourself safe. As a first step, you should determine 
what personal information is available online by conducting a search for your name. You should 
also take care when using social media to avoid sharing information about yourself that would be 
better kept private. Another strategy is to delete cookies from your computer. That way, no one 
can use your cookies in a malicious way.
Strategies for Improving Security
You can take many steps to improve security. One step is to restrict access to your computer and 
data by using strong passwords, applying permissions, and enabling firewalls. You can also use 
encryption to scramble the data on your hard drive, thereby preventing others from being able to 
read it.
Security is not just about preventing unauthorized access to your data, however. It’s also about 
protecting your data from damage or loss by storing copies of your data somewhere safe. This 
process is called “making a backup,” or “backing up.” You should back up your system on a regu-
lar basis. To do so, you can use the Windows built-in backup utility, called Windows Backup. If 
you used Windows Backup to back up the files and folders on your computer, you can restore the 
backed-up files and folders in the event of system failure or some other disaster.
It’s important that you run the most up-to-date version of your operating system. That way, as 
manufacturers fix bugs and patch security holes, you ensure that all the most recent patches are 
applied. To make it easier for you to keep your system up to date, Microsoft offers the Windows 
Update tool, which performs automatic updates to the operating system. Using this tool, you can 
check for new updates, change the automatic update settings, view your update history, and more.
If you want to dispose of data you have on a hard drive, even if only to give your computer to a 
friend, you must remove all traces of personal information from the drive. To do so, simply run 
a special software program that is designed to permanently erase the contents of your hard drive. 
These programs work by writing a series of patterns over the entire disk so that all existing data is 
overwritten and cannot be recovered.

Backing Up Your Data
Have a look at the files on your computer and make a list of those that contain personal data. 
Compare the different methods and devices you could use to make a copy of this data and identify 
the best way of making a backup copy. If you have the means, make a backup copy and identify a 
safe place to keep it.
Keeping Your System Up to Date
Explore your computer to check how up-to-date it is. Does it have a service pack installed? Run 
the Windows Update process to see if there are any uninstalled updates. Is there a reason why you 
have not installed them?
Protecting Yourself against Malware
Identify what type of anti-virus solution you have in place. Every package has its own control 
panel for administration. Open this panel and see how often the software checks the Internet for 
updates. Carry out a manual scan of your computer.

­Issues in Computing
Learning objectives
◽	 Be aware of the legal issues that arise from using computers and the 
Internet
◽	 Understand how to use the Internet in an ethical manner
◽	 Understand the potential impact on health when using a computer
◽	 Be aware of what to consider when disposing of a computer
This chapter moves beyond the technical aspects of working with computers and 
software to examine the legal and ethical issues related to computer use. These 
issues range from the legal ownership of online content to the ethical options for 
acquiring and using software, as well as what is appropriate (and inappropriate) 
online activity. This chapter also covers various health risks posed by computer use 
and the appropriate methods for disposing of computer hardware.
Legal Issues in Computing
Nearly everything we do in life is governed by laws of one sort or another. Not sur-
prisingly, these laws extend to cover our use of computers and the Internet. Legal 
issues in computing are complex, however. Whereas we are usually governed by the 
laws of the country in which we reside, the Internet is global, and different coun-
tries have different laws. That means you might access Internet content in your web 
browser that is regulated by local law, but the content itself is hosted on a server in 
another jurisdiction, and as such is governed by another set of rules. What is legal 
in one country is not necessarily legal in another, so you could end up unwittingly 
being guilty of an offense. For example, in some countries, online gambling is legal,

and citizens may both participate in online gambling and host their own 
gambling sites. In other countries, not only is it illegal to host an online 
gambling site, but it is also illegal for citizens of that country to use an 
online gambling site hosted in a country where it is legal.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property (IP), also called intellectual property rights (IPR), 
is a legal term that grants people the exclusive rights to the ownership of 
content that they have created. “Created” is the important word here. 
This can apply to tangible items, such a book, as well as to ideas that 
have been documented, such as patents, artistic works, photographs, 
and music.
IP has evolved over many years and can now be applied to certain aspects 
of computing and the Internet. For example, suppose you design a web 
page or produce some written material for a website. Depending on the 
nature of the material (and on any agreements you have in place with 
others), you may have the exclusive rights to use it because you created 
it. In effect, it belongs to you. Intellectual property provides protection 
for the owner of the material.
Copyright Laws
Copyright is a subset of intellectual property but differs in interpretation 
and use. Copyright is a legal protection that usually gives the creator of a 
work—be it written or artistic—exclusive rights to its use and distribution 
for a limited time period. For example, when an author writes a book, he 
might choose to obtain the copyright for that book. Then, the author (and 
his descendants) will be entitled to royalties from the sale of the book until 
the copyright expires. In many countries, a work’s copyright lasts for the 
duration of the creator’s lifetime plus an additional 50 years after his death. 
(Note that in some cases, a book’s publisher might hold the copyright on 
the work, depending on the agreement struck by the author. Note, too, 
that copyright can be limited to geographical boundaries unless there is 
some form of international agreement between the parties.)
There is no symbol to identify IP, but when something is copyrighted, 
you will usually see the © symbol along with the copyright owner’s name 
and sometimes a year. For example, if you look inside the front cover of 
this book, you will see the following copyright: ©2014 John Wiley & 
Sons, Ltd. Copyright has become difficult to enforce with the advent of 
digital media and the Internet, which make it easy to download and redis-
tribute material. Unless some form of digital rights management (DRM) 
is in use, it is impossible to enforce copyright law over so many jurisdic-
tions. (You’ll learn more about DRM in the next section.)
Digital Rights Management
Digital rights management (DRM) involves the use of technology to 
control access to copyrighted material. It is a practical attempt to address 
the growing problem of the unauthorized copying and distribution of 
material. The practice of distributing digital content over the Internet via 
file-sharing networks has made the enforcement of traditional copyright 
laws difficult.
intellectual property (IP) The exclusive rights 
to the ownership of something that has been cre-
ated or produced.

creator of a work for a limited period of time.

Chapter 12: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
DRM helps to prevent illegal downloads by requiring access verification 
to protected material. To access DRM-protected material, the user needs 
a username and password, which are stored in a database. DRM also 
helps to prevent already downloaded files from being widely shared with 
others. For example, iTunes downloads can be burned to an audio CD a 
limited number of times, can be placed only on portable devices that are 
registered to the signed-in user, and will not play if manually copied to 
another computer.
Some software vendors use DRM to allow document authors to pro-
tect content created with the software. Access to a document may be 
restricted by requiring anyone who opens the file to log into a DRM 
server online.
Opponents of DRM
DRM is not without controversy. Indeed, many organizations and computer scientists are opposed to the practice. 
Some argue that the use of DRM restricts users’ access from using content they have rightfully purchased as they 
see fit. For example, DRM prevents legitimate users from making personal copies of materials, lending copies to 
friends, and so on. In addition, DRM may on occasion prevent legitimate users from accessing their content. Finally, 
many argue that the use of DRM is pointless, as more often than not, users are able to crack the codes used to 
secure content.
Privacy and Security
Software Licensing
When you install an operating system or software program, one of the 
first stages of the process is to agree to its terms and conditions. These 
terms and conditions are presented in a legal document called an End 
User License Agreement (EULA), the end user being you. The EULA 
defines what you as a user can and cannot do with the product you are 
about to install.
You will not be able to proceed to the next stage of the install until you 
accept the agreement (see Figure 12.1). If you choose not to accept the 
terms and conditions, you won’t be permitted to install the software. It 
may take a few minutes to read through the terms and conditions, but 
it’s a good idea to do so, so you will know what you can and cannot 
legally do with the software.
End User License Agreement (EULA) A 
legal document that grants you permission to use 
a piece of software.
NOTE
For most vendors, licensing is a way of ensuring that they collect revenue for the products they offer. 
Vendors also use licensing to ensure that if people use the software to break any laws, it is the user who 
is in trouble, not the vendor.

Privacy and Security
Product Activation
During installation, some products require you not only to agree to the terms and conditions, but also to enter 
a license code or key to activate the product. This key can be sent by email as part of the registration process. 
Alternatively, it could be provided on a printed card as part of a physical software package.
Many products, particularly the more expensive ones like Microsoft Office, also require online activation. This 
calls for an active Internet connection. Online activation adds the license key to a database of active licenses, 
maintained by the software vendor. This prevents someone from using the same code again to license the soft-
ware more than once, thus breaking the terms of the single user license. This figure shows the result of an online 
activation.
Types of Software and Licensing
Software may be released either as proprietary software or as open-source 
software. Proprietary software is software you can use but do not own. 
The vendor retains ownership; you simply have the right to use one 
or more copies of the software after purchasing it and agreeing to the 
EULA. The source code used in this type of software is kept private. 
That is, users are not permitted to access and/or change the code.
proprietary software Software to which the 
vendor retains ownership rights. Users merely have 
usage rights.

Chapter 12: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Trial Software
Some vendors enable users to download a free trial version of a proprietary software program. When you do, you still 
have to agree to the terms and conditions, and you only get to use the software for a short period of time—typically from 
7 to 30 days. You may also find that the trial version is a scaled-down version of the full program, without all the features. 
In other words, certain aspects of the full-version software don’t function. The idea behind the trial software is for you to 
evaluate the software and see if it is the right product for you. At the end of the trial period, if you want to ­continue using 
the software, you will be asked to purchase a license. If so, you will be sent a code to activate the product.
Put It to Work
Open-source software is software that is not only free to use, but also 
whose source code is accessible to users to modify and redistribute. You 
may be wondering, why is it free? What’s in it for the software devel-
opers? The answer is simple: The open-source movement is all about 
promoting freedoms and removing licensing restrictions. The theory is 
that by allowing the free distribution of software that can be enhanced by 
others, the computer world benefits from having consistently improved 
products—and from that, we all benefit.
Although open-source software is about removing licensing restrictions, 
many types of open-source software do carry a license, called the General 
Public License (GPL). The GPL—developed by an organization called 
the Free Software Foundation, that exists to support the creation and 
distribution of free software—is a simply worded license that enables indi-
viduals and companies to legally copy and modify software. This gives users 
much greater freedom with the product, allowing them to make as many 
copies as they like, installing it on all their computers, distributing it to 
friends, and, of course, making changes to the source code if they so desire.
Software Piracy
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying of software programs. 
There are various types of software piracy:
◾	 Counterfeit software. Counterfeit software is a copy of a legiti-
mate product that is made and marketed as an original. With 
counterfeit software, the media and packaging may look genuine, 
but only because the software has been copied and packaged to 
look like the original. It is sometimes difficult to tell the differ-
ence between the genuine article and a fake. Counterfeit software 
is even easier to sell over the Internet—particularly software that is 
downloadable rather than distributed on a physical disc. This type 
of software is often sold on sites that appear to be authorized, but 
if you look closely, you can usually spot clues that the site is not 
legitimate, such as a slightly different spelling in the URL, gram-
mar or usage errors that indicate a non-native speaker may have 
created the page, or blurry or incorrect logos.
◾	 Corporate piracy. Often, a company or organization will pur-
chase software in a legitimate way, but install the software on more 
machines than it is supposed to. For example, a company might buy 
software with 50 licenses but install it on 100 computers. This prac-
tice, which can save corporations many thousands or even ­millions 
of dollars, is called “corporate piracy.” It may seem benign, but it is 
in fact a form of theft.
open-source software Free access to a soft-
ware program and the source code that produced 
the program.
General Public License (GPL) A license used 
for many types of open-source software, allowing 
the software to be legally copied and modified.

◾	 Unbundling packages. When you purchase a computer or note-
book, it frequently comes as an original equipment manufacturer 
(OEM) bundle. For example, the operating system comes pre-
loaded on the computer and is licensed to that particular computer. 
If the bundle comes with a backup copy of the operating system on 
DVD and the owner sells that copy to someone else, this breaks the 
terms of the license and is a form of piracy.
◾	 Internet piracy. There are many Internet sites where copyrighted 
software can be illegally downloaded free or at low cost. These 
sites even give users guidance on where to obtain the license key 
information necessary to use the program, or produce fake keys 
themselves. This is Internet piracy. With so many sites and so much 
software available, Internet piracy is virtually unstoppable. Much 
of the illegal software is published in countries where the necessary 
laws are not strongly enforced. Sites that offer these illegal activities 
sometimes contain malware that can infect your computer when 
you download from them.
CAUTION
Next time you accept an offer of some software from a friend, ask yourself these questions:
	 ◾	 Has it come from a genuine source?
	 ◾	 Is it okay to share this software with others?
	 ◾	 Is it licensed for more than one computer?
You could quite easily break the law by accepting the software and using it. Remember, though, that 
ignorance is not a legal defense.

Ethical Issues in Computing
With computing comes several ethical issues—particularly with regard to 
the Internet. These range from plagiarism to censorship, libel, slander, 
and beyond.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the practice of copying someone else’s work and pre-
tending that it is your own. Thanks to the Internet, it is all too easy to 
download a document from an obscure website and submit or republish 
it as yours.
plagiarism The act of copying someone else’s 
work and pretending that it is your own.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
327
Chapter 12: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Plagiarism comes in several forms:
◾	 Copying work produced by someone else word for word and pre-
senting it as your own.
◾	 Inserting portions of someone else’s work into your own and 
claiming full credit
◾	 Changing a few words and phrases of a piece of work so it looks 
different but is based on someone else’s work
◾	 Taking material from multiple sources and putting it all together as 
your own work
Plagiarism has become a big problem in colleges and universities. Often, 
when students receive assignments, they simply research on the Internet, 
copy large blocks of text from various sources, stitch them together into 
a single document, and pass the result off as their own work. Even worse, 
some students patronize any one of several Internet-based companies 
that write assignments for them.
Using Citations
It is not always wrong to use someone else’s work. In many cases, you 
can quote or paraphrase (discussed next) someone else’s work in your 
own piece—provided you include a reference to the source (in other 
words, to the author and name of the work). This is called a citation. 
Including a citation to give credit to the original author of a piece of 
work is the only way to avoid plagiarism.
Paraphrasing
In addition to quoting an author directly, you can paraphrase what he or 
she writes. When you paraphrase, you use different words to convey the 
same idea. Even so, you still must include a citation to acknowledge that 
the original idea came from someone else.
citation A reference to a source—that is, to the 
author and name of a published or unpublished 
work—following a quotation from said source.
paraphrase To use different words to convey the 
same idea.
Combating Plagiarism
Recent years have seen the development of a range of anti-plagiarism software products, such as turnitin (www.
turnitin.com). These programs compare a submitted document against a large database of quotes and texts. 
Mathematical processes check not only for actual word-for-word plagiarism, but also for paraphrased text where it can 
identify the original source. The results then highlight any suspect or copied areas in text and state where citations 
should be applied.
Using software like this, it takes only a few seconds to examine a document. Some educational institutions use this 
type of software as standard practice for all work handed in by students. Students can also use this type of software 
before turning in an assignment to ensure they have not inadvertently plagiarized.

Censorship and Filtering
Censorship is the act of preventing something from being printed 
or heard. Historically, censorship has been used to prevent important 
information from reaching the population at large by controlling what 
can be printed or broadcast. Censorship is sometimes implemented by 
governments so they can control the flow of information for political 
or military reasons. For example, writing that is deemed to be obscene 
or advocates that citizens break the country’s existing laws might be 
censored. Individuals or companies can also apply forms of censorship by 
not allowing certain types of information to be published. For example, 
if you post a negative review of a product on the manufacturer’s website, 
your view may be deleted; this is an example of corporate censorship.
Filtering is a form of censorship performed by software. Filtering 
means to prevent something from getting through. For example, when 
you filter water, you remove all the impurities, making it safe to drink. 
Similarly, when you filter the Internet, you exclude certain categories 
of content from general access. For example, a parent might install web 
filtering software on a child’s computer to prevent the child from access-
ing websites with graphic violent content, or a coffee shop might use 
filtering to prevent its patrons from accessing adult-themed sites when 
using the store’s Internet connection. Companies also may filter their 
employees’ web usage at work, such as blocking social networking sites 
like Facebook to improve productivity.
Web filtering is accomplished by using a proxy server—that is, a server 
that sits between the user’s web browser and the Internet and manages 
all requests for content.
When users attempt to access a filtered site, a message is displayed in 
their browser, notifying them that the request is denied. Figure 12.2 
shows a list of blocked site categories on a proxy server.
censorship The act of suppressing speech or 
not allowing certain communications to be made 
public.

Chapter 12: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Flaming
Most likely, when you use chat rooms or social networks or comment 
on websites, you interact quite happily with other users. Occasionally, 
however, you may find that some users become quite hostile. This hap-
pens frequently on sites like YouTube, which gives users the option to 
post comments, and on social networking sites like Facebook. Some of 
the comments become negative and personal, complete with insults and 
swear words. This is called flaming. When the negativity escalates as 
more comments are posted, it is known as a flame war.
Libel and Slander
Libel and slander are similar in that both are statements that can cause 
damage to someone’s reputation.
flaming Where Internet users interact in a hostile 
way with each other.
Libel is the act of putting a false and defamatory statement in writing. 
Any false statement that could damage the reputation of an individual 
or organization could be considered to be libel. Because it is written, it 
can have a lasting effect on the individual or company being libeled. For 
example, a libelous comment published on Twitter and then retweeted 
to others could spread quickly. It would be difficult to control the spread 
and to undo the damage caused. In most countries, libel is a civil offense. 
That means the person or organization being libeled would have to take 
legal action to obtain any form of compensation or redress. For libel to 
be upheld, it must be proved that the statement is untrue.
Slander is the verbal version of libel. Slander might consist of negative 
comments about an individual or group that are made as part of a phone 
or face-to-face conversation; in the digital world, it may include slander-
ous comments made on an online-published video or in a group video 
conference. The effect is just as damaging to the reputation of the target 
individual.
Spamming
Spam—that is, unsolicited or “junk” email, typically containing offers 
(some legitimate, some not) for electronic goods, drugs, software, and 
so on—is a major problem on the Internet. These emails are sent in bulk, 
bombarding thousands if not millions of users at a time. There are vary-
ing estimates of how much email is spam, but most put the number at 
80% or more. Although most email programs include a junk email filter, 
many of these emails still slip through to fill users’ inboxes, as shown in 
Figure 12.3. As a result, users waste valuable time reading and deleting 
unwanted messages.
libel Putting in writing a defamatory statement 
that could damage a person’s or organization’s 
reputation.
slander Making a defamatory verbal statement 
that could damage a person’s or organization’s 
reputation.
spam Unsolicited “junk” mail, typically containing 
offers (some legitimate, some not) of products or 
services to buy.

Figure 12.3  Examples of spam.
Not all email received from a business is spam. Businesses with whom 
you have a previous relationship, such as a store where you have ordered 
before, might send you promotional emails because you have given 
them your email address. You can unsubscribe from such emails with the 
Unsubscribe link provided in the email. Beware, however, of using the 
Unsubscribe link in a generic mass email that you get from a company 
that you have no relationship with. Sometimes unscrupulous spammers 
use the Unsubscribe link to confirm that their message has reached an 
active email address, and trying to unsubscribe will only get you added 
to more spammers’ lists.
Is spamming legal? It depends on what country you are in. In the United 
States, spam is legal, provided the message conforms to certain formats. 
What is most definitely not legal is when spam encourages recipients to 
visit fake websites and share personal information. That’s when spam 
becomes phishing.

Health Issues in Computing
Using computers brings with it a host of health issues, from eyestrain to 
back and limb problems. The stress and strain placed on a human body 
while using a computer can cause discomfort and pain and can lead to 
long-term medical conditions if not addressed. To confront these prob-
lems, users can pay special attention to their work environment, using 
good posture, ergonomic furniture, and appropriate lighting.

Combating Eyestrain
When you use your computer, your eyes focus at a fixed distance on a 
small area (your screen) for a considerable period of time. They were not 
designed to do this, however. As a result, many computer users end up 
with eyestrain, which can lead to blurring or headaches.
Here are a few tips for combating eyestrain:
◾	 Have regular eye examinations. If you have corrective eyewear, use 
it while working at the computer.
◾	 Situate your computer monitor such that it is 20 to 40 inches 
(50 to 100 centimeters) from your face, with your eyes just above 
the center of the screen. If necessary, adjust the angle of the 
screen. (Adjusting the height and angle of your monitor will also 
help to protect your neck and shoulders.)
◾	 Use incandescent rather than fluorescent lighting in your work 
area, because fluorescent lighting tends to flicker more. If you can-
not avoid fluorescent lighting, avoid working directly underneath 
the light fixture if possible.
◾	 Position your monitor so that bright light does not shine directly 
on it, to reduce glare.
◾	 Use a flat-screen LCD monitor instead of the older CRT type. 
If you cannot avoid using a CRT, set its refresh rate to at least 
100 Hz in the display settings in your operating system.
◾	 Take frequent breaks. Avoid sitting in front of your monitor for 
more than an hour at a time.
◾	 When you take a break, exercise your eyes. That is, look at items 
at different distances so your eyes get used to focusing normally 
again. Another way to exercise your eyes is to follow the 20-20-20 
rule. That is, every 20 minutes, look away from the screen at some-
thing 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This prevents the eye muscles 
from being in the same position for too long.
In addition, to prevent eyestrain, opt for as large a screen as possible 
(19 inches, or 48 centimeters, is a good bet), and decrease the screen 
resolution so that icons and text appear larger. That way, you won’t 
have to strain to see them. A lower resolution may make the display on 
an LCD monitor appear fuzzy, so you may have to balance between 
resolution and sharpness. (However, in Windows 7 and higher, you can 
increase the size of icons and text without decreasing the display resolu-
tion.) You can also adjust the brightness and contrast of your display to 
reduce eyestrain.

Easing Your Back and Upper Limbs
Everything we do depends on our back. If our back is injured or out of 
alignment, it affects our ability to perform even the most mundane tasks. 
And yet, the back is arguably the most abused part of the body. This is 
because we fail to adopt the correct position when we perform certain 
activities, such as lifting heavy items. Even sitting down must be done 
correctly to ensure back health.
Unfortunately, too many computer users suffer from back problems because 
they fail to care for their back while they work. Computer users are also sub-
ject to sore fingers, aching shoulders, tired arms, and injured elbows. Often, 
permanent damage is done. For help preventing this, read on.
Using Good Posture
Posture refers to how we sit or stand. When using your computer (or 
doing anything else), it’s critical that you use good posture. Otherwise, 
you put too much strain on your body.
A good working posture is one in which the body’s position can be 
maintained with minimal physical effort. Your body should be relaxed. 
This allows you to maintain your position for longer, without putting 
strain on the body. Here are some hallmarks of good posture:
◾	 The lower back is supported by the shape of the chair.
◾	 The head is up and level.
◾	 The upper arms are relaxed.
◾	 The forearms are at a right angle with the upper arms.
◾	 The wrists are in a straight line with the hands and forearms.
◾	 The knees are level with the hips and the thighs are horizontal.
◾	 The feet are flat on the floor (or resting on a platform or footrest).
For best results, obtain an adjustable chair. Then use it to adjust your 
position while seated—leaning slightly backward for a while, and then 
slightly forward. Moving around in this way will help reduce strain on 
your body. (Regardless of how good your posture is, it is not wise to sit 
in the same position for too long!) An adjustable table or monitor stand 
can also help, enabling you to position the monitor correctly, as well as 
promote the correct placement for your forearms and wrists.
posture How a person sits or stands. When 
someone has good posture, the body is straight 
and the spine is correctly aligned.
TIP
To prevent neck strain, position your monitor directly in front of you on the desk, not at an angle 
off to one side.

Compare Figure 12.4 with Figure 12.5. The person in Figure 12.4 is 
leaning forward, with his feet dangling in an unnatural position. This 
puts strain on the rest of his body. In contrast, the person in Figure 12.5 
is more upright, and his feet are resting on the floor. His spine is in cor-
rect alignment.

Figure 12.5  Correct posture.
TIP
Even if you use perfect posture, you should take frequent breaks to maintain back health. Get up and stretch 
every 1 to 2 hours, at a minimum. Taking frequent breaks will also help you minimize stress and fatigue.
Positioning Your Desk and Chair
Desk and chair height can make a big difference in your body’s comfort. 
For best results, think parallel lines. Adjust the desk and chair height so 
that when you sit up straight at the desk, your thighs are parallel to the 
floor and both feet are flat on the floor. Adjust the keyboard and mouse 
heights so that your forearms are parallel to the floor when you are using 
them. You may need to install a keyboard tray below the desk’s main 
surface to achieve this.
Ergonomic Input Devices
Even with the proper vertical positioning of your keyboard and mouse, 
you may still experience some wrist strain when you use them for a long 
time. Repetitive stress injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can make 
the tendons in your hands and wrists swollen and painful and cause burn-
ing or tingling.
One way to further protect your hands and wrists is to use ergonomically 
designed input devices. These special keyboards, mice, and trackballs are 
designed to reduce the strain placed on your body when you use them.

Environmental Issues in 
Computer Disposal
Computers are made of more than just their metal or plastic case. They 
contain components such as a motherboard, hard drive, display, and 
peripherals. These components contain all sorts of different materials, 
some of which may be toxic to the environment.
To avoid damaging the environment, it’s imperative that you dispose 
of your computer properly when you no longer want it. Dumping a 
computer in a landfill could cause heavy metals and poisons such as 
arsenic from the components to enter the area’s water supply, putting the 
population at risk. Similarly, incinerating a computer could release ele-
ments such as mercury and cadmium into the atmosphere, which could 
be harmful to those nearby.
Many countries now have regulations that govern the disposal process. 
In some cases, these regulations require computer retailers and manufac-
turers to contribute toward having the computer recycled. This makes 
the disposal process much safer and easier.

Chapter 12: Legal, Ethical, Health, and Environmental Issues in Computing
Rather than disposing of an old computer, consider harvesting the com-
ponents and using them elsewhere. Here are a few ideas:
◾	 Hard drive: Consider reusing the hard drive in another computer, 
as an additional drive for yourself or someone else. Or, keep it as 
a spare. If you opt to give the drive away, be sure to wipe your 
data from it using a program such as Active@KillDisk (discussed in 
Chapter 11, “Network and Internet Privacy and Security”).
◾	 Memory: If the RAM is still usable and of a suitable capacity and 
speed, you could use it in another computer.
◾	 Keyboard and mouse: These are pretty universal and could be 
used with any computer. It’s always worth keeping old keyboards 
and mice as spares!
◾	 Display: If the monitor is of the CRT variety, it is probably at the 
end of its life and should be disposed of. If it’s a more modern, flat-
screen monitor, you may be able to use it with another computer. 
Alternatively, you could use it as a second monitor on your primary 
computer, running dual displays.
◾	 Removable components: A desktop computer may contain 
removable components such as a display adapter, sound card, 
or network interface card that could be saved for use in another 
computer.
◾	 Notebooks: There is not much you can remove and reuse from 
a notebook computer other than the hard drive and possibly the 
RAM, so this is likely to be disposed of intact.
Alternative Uses for an Older Computer
Before you dispose of your old computer, consider whether there is an alternative, environmentally friendly way of 
­dealing with it—especially if the computer still has some life left in it. Here are a few ideas:
◾	 Sell it: If there’s nothing wrong with the computer, why not see if you can sell it—for example, on eBay or 
some other market place? (If you go this route, again, be sure you wipe the hard drive clean. See Chapter 11 
for details.)
◾	 Give it away: It may be that some deserving person or organization could make good use of your old computer. 
Why not donate it?
◾	 Assign it a new role: Even if your old computer is a bit slow running newer versions of Windows, it’s probably 
fast enough to run an alternative operating system, such as Linux. Try installing such an operating system on 
your old computer if you want an extra computer to play with!
◾	 Keep it as a spare: It’s not a bad idea to keep the old computer as a spare, just in case you have a problem 
with your new one. That way, if your main computer needs repairs, you’ll still have a computer to use in the 
interim.

Summary
Legal Issues in Computing
Intellectual property (IP) is a legal term that grants people the exclusive rights to the ownership 
of content that they have created, such as books, artistic works, photographs, music, software, and 
patents. Copyright is a legal protection that usually gives the creator of a work exclusive rights for 
a specified time period.
Digital rights management (DRM) involves the use of technology to control access to copyrighted 
material in an attempt to prevent the unauthorized copying and distribution of material. When you 
install an operating system or software program, you must agree to legal document called an End User 
License Agreement (EULA). The EULA defines what a user can and cannot do with a product.
Open-source software is software that is not only free to use, but whose source code is accessible 
to users to modify and redistribute. Although open-source software is about removing licensing 
restrictions, many types of open-source software do carry a license, called the General Public 
License (GPL). The GPL enables individuals and companies to legally copy and modify software.
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying of software programs. There are various types of software 
piracy, including counterfeit software, corporate piracy, unbundling packages, and Internet piracy.
Ethical Issues in Computing
Plagiarism is the practice of copying someone else’s work and pretending that it is your own. To 
avoid plagiarism, use citations when referencing the work of others. You must cite not only the 
source of exact wording, but the source of paraphrased ideas.
Censorship is the act of preventing something from being printed or heard. Governments, com-
panies, or individuals can apply forms of censorship by not allowing certain types of information to 
be published or distributed.
Filtering means to prevent something from getting through. When you filter the Internet, you 
exclude certain categories of content from general access. A proxy server—that is, a server that 
sits between the user’s web browser and the Internet—is used to filter web content.
Sometimes, online communications become hostile, with personal attacks and insults. This is 
called flaming. Libel is the act of putting a false, defamatory statement in writing. Slander is the 
verbal version of libel. Slander might consist of negative comments about an individual or group 
that are made as part of a conversation.
Spam is unsolicited junk email. Although most email programs include a junk email filter, many of 
these emails still slip through to fill users’ inboxes, wasting users’ valuable time.
Health Issues in Computing
To combat eyestrain, situate your computer so it is 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 centimeters) from 
your face, with your eyes just above the center of the screen. If necessary, adjust the angle of the 
screen. Work in incandescent lighting rather than fluorescent when possible, and position your 
monitor so that light does not shine directly on it. Use an LCD monitor if possible rather than a 
CRT; if you must use a CRT, set its refresh rate to at least 100 Hz. Use as large a monitor as pos-
sible, and take frequent breaks from looking at it.
A good working posture is one in which the body is relaxed and can maintain its position with 
minimal physical effort. Even if you use perfect posture, you should take frequent breaks to main-
tain back health. Position your desk and chair so that your thighs and forearms are parallel to the 
floor as you work.

Assessing Your Work Environment
Examine the physical environment where you use computers at home, at school, and at work. 
Look at the furniture you are using—the tables, chairs, and so forth—and see what improvements 
you can make to provide a healthier work environment. Are there any cost-free measures you can

Think It Over
Studying Software Licenses
Software licensing is an important issue for computer software vendors. Look at some of the 
license agreements for some of the software you have installed, or install some trial software so 
you can view the terms and conditions. Can you understand the terms being using? If not, where 
could you get help? Is the license agreement too complex and difficult to understand? Could you 
reword a license agreement so that it is understandable to nearly anyone and is only as long as it 
needs to be?
