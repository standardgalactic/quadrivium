Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) 
Somatic: Nerves connecting to voluntary 
skeletal muscles and sensory receptors 
• Afferent Nerve Fibers (incoming): Axons 
that carry info away from the periphery to 
the CNS 
• Efferent Nerve Fibers (outgoing): Axons 
that carry info from the CNS outward to the 
periphery 
 
Autonomic: Nerves that connect to the 
heart, blood vessels, smooth muscles, and 
glands

Central Nervous System (CNS) 
CNS = Spinal Cord + Brain 
 
Spinal Cord 
• Local feedback loops control 
reflexes (“reflex arcs”) 
• Descending motor control signals 
from the brain activate spinal 
motor neurons 
•  Ascending sensory axons convey 
sensory information from muscles 
and skin back to the brain

Major Brain Regions: The Hindbrain 
Medulla Oblongata 
Controls breathing, muscle tone 
and blood pressure 
Pons 
Connected to the 
cerebellum & involved 
in sleep and arousal 
Cerebellum 
Coordination and timing of 
voluntary movements,  
sense of equilibrium, 
language, attention,…

Major Brain Regions: Midbrain & Retic. Formation 
Midbrain 
Eye movements, visual and 
auditory reflexes 
s   c 
Reticular Formation 
Modulates muscle 
reflexes, breathing & 
pain perception. Also 
regulates sleep, 
wakefulness & 
arousal

Major Brain Regions: Thalamus & Hypothalamus 
Thalamus 
“Relay station” for all  
sensory info (except  
smell) to the cortex, 
regulates sleep/wakefulness 
Hypothalamus 
Regulates basic needs 
Fighting, Fleeing, 
Feeding, and 
Mating 
Thalamus 
Hypothalamus 

8 
Major Brain Regions: The Cerebrum 
F Consists of: Cerebral 
cortex, basal ganglia, 
hippocampus, and 
amygdala 
 
F Involved in perception 
and motor control, 
cognitive functions, 
emotion, memory, and 
learning 
 
 
Cerebral Cortex 

9 
Cerebral Cortex: A Layered Sheet of Neurons 
F Cerebral Cortex: Convoluted 
surface of cerebrum, about 1/8th 
of an inch thick 
• Approximately 30 billion neurons  
• Each neuron makes about 10,000 
synapses, approximately 300 
trillion connections in total 
F Six layers of neurons 
• Relatively uniform in 
structure 
• Is there a common 
computational principle 
operating across cortex?

How do all of these brain regions interact 
to produce cognition and behavior?

Don’t know fully yet! 
But inching closer based on: 
• electrophysiological, 
• optical,  
• molecular,  
• functional imaging,  
• psychophysical,  
• anatomical 
• connectomic 
• lesion (brain damage) studies…
