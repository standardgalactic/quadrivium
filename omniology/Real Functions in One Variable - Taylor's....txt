Preface
In this volume I present some examples of Taylor’s formula and Limit Processes, cf. also Ventus:
Calculus 1a, Functions of One Variable. Since my aim also has been to demonstrate some solution
strategy I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following form
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
One is used to from high school immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level are often so complicated that it in general will be a good investment
also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to be absolutely certain of what to do
in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can always be performed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. Instead, write in a plain language
what you mean or want to do.
It is my hope that these examples, of which many are treated in more ways to show that the solutions
procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students who have just started their
studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Example 1.1 Find the two ﬁrst derivatives of the function
f(x) =
√
1 + x,
x > −1.
A. Simple diﬀerentiations.
D. Just diﬀerentiate.
I. If f(x) = √1 + x, x > −1, then
f ′(x) = 1
2
1
√1 + x
and
f ′′(x) = −1
4
1
(1 + x)√1 + x,
x > −1.
Example 1.2 Set up Taylor’s formula for n = 2 with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for the function
f(x)
√
1 + x.
A. Taylor’s formula for n = 2.
D. Perform the diﬀerentiations, or use the results from Example 1.1.
I. From
f(x) =
√
1 + x,
f ′(x) = 1
2
1
√1 + x,
f ′′(x) = −1
4

(x + 1)√1 + x,
we get for x0 = 0,
f(0) = 1,
f ′(0) = 1
2,
f ′′(0) = −1
4.
Then by insertion into Taylor’s formula for n = 2,
√
1 + x
=
f(0) + f ′(0) (x −0) + 1
2 f ′′(ξ) (x −0)2
=

(1 + ξ)3/2 x2,
where ξ lies somewhere between 0 and x.

f(x) = Arctan 2x.
A. Simple diﬀerentiations.
D. Just diﬀerentiate.
I. When f(x) = Arctan 2x, then
f ′(x) =
2
1 + 4x2
and
f ′′(x) = −

Example 1.4 Set up Taylor’s formula for n = 2 with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for the function
f(x) = Arctan 2x.
A. Taylor’s formula for n = 2.

f ′(x) =

Example 1.5 The mean value theorem (or Taylor’s formula for n = 1) states that for any continuous
function f(x) there exists a point ξ between x0 and x such that
f(x) −f(x0) = (x −x0)f ′(ξ).
Find such a point ξ for
1) f(x) = sin x, x0 = 0, x = π,
2) f(x) = xn (n > 1), x0 = 0, x = 1.
A. Applications of the mean value theorem.
D. Set up the mean value theorem in the two given cases, and then ﬁnd ξ.

I. 1) From f ′(x) = cos x we get
sin x −sin x0 = (x −x0) · cos ξ.
When x0 = 0 or x = π we get the equation
0 −0 = 0 = π · cos ξ,
thus ξ = π
2 .
2) From f ′(x) = nxn−1 we get
xn −xn
0 = nξn−1 · (x −x0).
For x0 = 0 and x = 1 we get the equation
1 −0 = 1 = nξn−1 · (1 −0) = nξn−1,
thus
ξn =
n−1

(→1 for n →+∞).
Example 1.6 Assume that the function f(x) is three times continuously diﬀerentiable, which means
that the third derivative exists and is continuous, in a neighbourhood of the point x0 ∈R, and assume
that f ′(x0) = 0.
1) Prove that if f ′′(x0) < 0, then f(x) has a maximum at the point x0.
2) Now, we further assume that f ′′(x0) = 0 and f ′′′(x0) ̸= 0.
Apply Taylor’s formula to decide
whether f(x) has a maximum or a minimum or none of the kind at the point x0.
A. Maximum/minimum.
D. Taylor expansion of order 2.
I. 1) It follows immediately from
f(x) = f(x0) + 1
2 f ′′(x0) · (x −x0)2 + (x −x0)2 ε(x −x0),
that if f ′′(x0) < 0, then f(x) < f(x0) in a neighbourhood of x0 (excl. x0 itself), such that f(x)
has a maximum at the point x0.
2) If we assume that f ′′(x0) = 0 and f ′′′(x0) ̸= 0, then
f(x) = f(x0) + 1
6 f ′′(x0) · (x −x0)3 + (x −x0)3 ε(x −x0),
and f(x) −f(x0) is of the same sign as f ′′′(x0) for x > 0 and of the opposite sign of f ′′′(x0)
for x < 0. Hence f(x) has neither a maximum nor a minimum at x0.

Example 1.7 Assume that the function f(x) is four times continuously diﬀerentiable, which means
that the fourth derivative exists and is continuous, in a neighbourhood of the point x0 ∈R, and assume
that
f ′(x0) = f ′′(x0) = f ′′′(x0) = 0,
while f (4)(x0) ̸= 0.
1) Prove by means of Taylor’s formula that if f (4)(x0) > 0, then f(x) has a minimum at the point
x0.
2) What is the conclusion, if instead f (4)(x0) < 0?
A. Maximum/minimum.
D. Use Taylor’s formula.
I. 1) It follows from Taylor’s formula, that in a neighbourhood of x0,
f(x) = f(x0) + 1
4! f (4)(x0) · (x −x0)4 + (x −x0)4 ε(x −x0),
because the ﬁrst three derivatives of f(x) are 0 at x0.
It follows immediately, when f (4)(x0) > 0 that f(x) > f(x0) in a neighbourhood of x0, x ̸= x0,
so f(x) must have a (local) minimum at x0.
2) If instead f (4)(x0) < 0, then f(x) < f(x0) in a neighbourhood of x0, x ̸= x0, hence f(x) has a
local maximum at x0.
Example 1.8 Assume that the function f(x) is of class C∞in a neighbourhood of the point x0 ∈R,
and that f ′(x0) = 0. Let p denote the ﬁrst number of 2, 3, 4, . . . , for which f (p)(x0) ̸= 0. This means
that
f ′(x0) = f ′′(x0) = · · · = f (p−1)(x0) = 0,
f (p)(x0) ̸= 0.
1) Set up Taylor’s formula for f(x) i x0 with p as point of expansion.
2) Formulate and prove a theorem which states that f(x) has a maximum or a minimum or none of
the kind at the point x0.
A. Maximum/minimum.
D. Apply Taylor’s formula.
I. 1) This is trivial,
f(x) = f(x0) + 1
p! f (p)(x0) · (x −x0)p + (x −x0)p ε(x −x0).
2) Here we shall split into the cases, whether p is odd or even.
a) If p is odd, then (x −x0)p changes its sign in a neighbourhood of x0, so we have neither a
maximum nor a minimum.
b) If p = 2n is even, we must split according to whether f (2n)(x0) > 0 or f (2n)(x0) < 0.

i) If f (2nm)(x0) > 0, then f(x) > f(x0) in a neighbourhood of x0, x ̸= x0, so f(x) has a
local minimum at x0.
ii) If f (2n)(x0) < 0, then f(x) < f(x0) in a neighbourhood of x0, x ̸= x0, so f(x) has a
local maximum at x0.
Example 1.9 Find all values of the constant a, for which there exists a δ > 0, such that the parabola
y = 1 + a x2 lies above the chain curve y = cosh x for 0 < |x| < δ.
A. Local comparison of graphs.
D. Find the Taylor expansion of y = cosh x with the expansion point x0 = 0 and then analyze.

A. Taylor expansion.
D. Diﬀerentiate ﬁve times.
I. When f(x) = (1 + x)−2, we get by diﬀerentiation
f ′(x) = −2(1 + x)−3,
f ′′(x) = 3!(1 + x)−4,
f (3)(x) = −4!(1 + x)−5,
f (4)(x) = 5!(1 + x)−6,

Example 2.3 Let P1(x) denote the Taylor polynomial of order 1 with the point of expansion x0 = 0
for the function f(x) = Arctan 2x. Give an estimate of the remainder term R1(x), when
(1) |x| ≤1
10,
(2) |x| ≤1
2.
A. Taylor expansion and an estimate of the remainder term.
D. Diﬀerentiate two times or apply Example 1.3 and Example 1.4, and apply Taylor’s formula. Es-
timate the remainder term.
I. Let f(x) = Arctan 2x. Then
f ′(x) =
2
1 + 4x2
and
f ′′(x) = −
16x
(1 + 4x2)2 .
When x0 = 0 is the point of expansion, we get
Arctan 2x = f(x0)0f ′(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2 f ′′(ξ) (x −x0)2 = 2x −
8ξ
(1 + 4ξ2)2 x2,
where ξ lies somewhere between 0 and x.
It follows that P1(x) = 2x and that
|f(x) −P1(x)| =

8ξ
(1 + 4ξ2)2
 x2 = |R1(x)|.
Now Arctan 2x is an odd function, so we can assume in the estimation of the remainder term that
x > 0, thus 0 ≤ξ ≤x.
The function
ϕ(ξ) =
8ξ
(1 + 4ξ2)2 ,
ξ ∈[0, x],
has the derivative
ϕ′(ξ) =
8
(1 + 4ξ2)3 (1 −12ξ2).
Hence ϕ(ξ) is increasing for ξ ∈

and decreasing for ξ >

A. Taylor expansion and estimate of a remainder term.
D. Diﬀerentiate two times and apply Taylor’s formula. Estimate the remainder term. We get some
problems in (3).
I. 1) When f(x) = x cos x we get
f ′(x) = cos x −x sin x,
f ′′(x) = −2 sin x −x cos x,
thus with the point of extension x0 = 0,
f(x)

|2 sin ξ + ξ cos ξ| ≤2 · sin 1 + cos 1 ≈2 · 1, 1116,

|R1(x)| ≤1

2) f(x) = ln cos x, x0 = 0, n = 3.
3) f(x) = sinh x, x0 = 0, n = 4.
A. Taylor polynomials and estimates of remainder terms. In all three cases the point of expansion is

D. Diﬀerentiate in each case n + 1 times with due respect to following the estimate of the remainder

Example 2.13 Consider the function f(x) = ex and Taylor’s formula with the point of expansion
x0 = 0,
(2) ex = 1 + x
1! + x2
2! + · · · + xn
n! + Rn+1(x),
where Rn+1(x) denotes the remainder term. We shall in the following only consider the case x > 0.
1. Prove that Rn+1(x) > 0, and then show that
(3) ex > xp

2. Prove from (1) that for every α ∈R+,

In the ﬁnal question we shall prove how we from (2) can prove that e is an irrational number. We
shall take for granted that e ∈]2, 3[. Then we apply a proof by contraposition, so we assume that
(4) e = m
n ,
m ∈N,
n ∈N,
n ≥2.
we shall then prove that this assumption will lead to a contradiction, hence that the assumption is
false.

First prove that 0 < n! Rn+1(1) < 1. Multiply the equation by n! and then derive the contradiction.
A. Taylor expansion. There are given some guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) Since f (n)(x) = ex > 0, we get
Rn+1(x) =

for x > 0,
hence
ex = 1 + x
1! + x2
2! + · · · + xn
n! + Rn+1(x) > xn
n! ,
and we derive (3), i.e.
ex > xp

every p ∈N.

1) Find the Taylor polynomial P2(x) with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for f(x).

A. Taylor expansion and estimates of remainder term. The example is the same as the ﬁrst two

D. Diﬀerentiate and then ﬁnd the coeﬃcients.
I. 1) We get successively by diﬀerentiation

P2(x) = f(0) + f ′(0) · x + 1
2! f ′′(0) · x2 = 1 + 0 −1
2 x2 = 1 −1
2 x2.
2) According to Taylor’s formula there exists a ξ lying between 0 and x, such that
f(x) = P2(x) = 1

From this we derive the estimate

Example 2.15 Find the Taylor polynomial P1(x) of ﬁrst order at the point x0 = 0 for the function

A. Taylor polynomial and estimate of the remainder term. Cf. Example 1.12.
D. Since we later shall estimate the remainder term, we diﬀerentiate twice.

Since

(1 + ex)2 =

(1 + ex)(1 + e−x)
=
1
1 + ex + e−x + 1 =

I. 1) We obtain by diﬀerentiation,
f(x) = (1 + x)2 ln(1 + x),
f(0) = 0,

Example 3.2 1) Find the Taylor polynomial P8(x) with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for the poly-
nomial
Q(x) = (x + a)8,
where a is a real number.
2) Prove that we for all x get P8(x) = Q(x).
3) Use the method to se up a formula for (x + a)n.
A. Taylor polynomial for the polynomial (x + a)n.
D. The Taylor polynomial is found in the usual way.
I. 1) We get
P8(x)
=
Q(0) + Q′(0)
1!
x + Q′′(0)
2!
x2 + Q(3)(0)
3!
x3 + Q(4)(0)
4!
x4

5!
x5 + Q(6)(0)
6!
x6 + Q(7)(0)
7!
x7 + Q(8)(0)
8!
x8.
We see that we by diﬀerentiation get
Q(j)(x) = 8 · 7 · · · (8 −j + 1) (x + a)8−j,
j = 1, . . . , 8,
thus
Q(j)(0) = 8 · 7 · · · (9 −j)a8−j =
8!
(8 −j)! a8−j,
j = 1, . . . , 8,
which is also true for j = 0,
Q(0) = Q(0)(0) = a8.
From these results follows that a general term of the Taylor expansion is
Q(j)(0)
j!
xj =
8!
j!(8 −j)! a8−j xj =
 8
j
	
a8−j xj,
j = 0, 1, . . . , 8.
Then we ﬁnd the Taylor polynomial
P8(x) =
8

j=0

8
j
	
a8−j xj.
2) Since Q(9)(x) ≡0, it follows from Taylor’s formula that
Q(x) = (x + a)8 = P8(x) + 1
9! Q(9)(ξ) x9 = P8(x).
3) When we use the same method as above we obtain the general binomial formula
(x + a)n =

Example 3.4 Find the Taylor polynomial of order 3 with any point of expansion x0 for the function
f(x) = (1 + x)3.
A. Taylor polynomial; any point of expansion. Obviously, the function is always equal to its Taylor
polynomial of order 3, because f(x) itself is a polynomial of third degree.
D. We have here two possibilities:
1) the binomial formula,
2) the method of diﬀerentiation.
I. 1) We get by the binomial formula
f(x)
=
(1 + x)3 = ({1 + x0} + {x −x0})3
=
(1 + x0)3 + 3(1 + x0)2(x −x0) + 3(1 + x0)(x −x0)2 + (x −x0)3.
2) By successive diﬀerentiation we get
f(x) = (1 + x)3,
f(x0) = (1 + x0)3,
f ′(x) = 3(1 + x)2,
f ′(x0) = 3(1 + x0)2,
f ′′(x0) = 6(1 + x),
f ′′(x0) = 6(1 + x0),
f (3)(x) = 6,
f (3)(x0) = 6.
The Taylor polynomial is
P3(x)
=
f(x) = f(x0) + f ′(x0) (x −x0) + 1
2! f ′′(x0) (x −x0)2 + 1
3! f (3)(x0) (x −x0)3
=
(1 + x0)3 + 3(1 + x0)2(x −x0) + 3(1 + x0)(x −x0)2 + (x −x0)3.
Example 3.5 Find the Taylor polynomial P8(x) with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for the functions
(1) f(x) = sin 2x,
(2) f(x) = cos 2x,
(3) f(x) = (1 + x2)2.
A. Taylor expansions.
D. Perform a simple calculation in (3). In (1) and (2) we diﬀerentiate.
I. 1) If we put g(y) = sin y, then
g(y) = g(4)(y) = g(8)(y) = sin y,
g′(y) = g(5)(y) = cos y,
g′′(y) = g(6)(y) = −sin y,
g(3)(y) = g(7)(y) = −cos y,
hence
Pg,8(y) = y −1
3! y3 + 1
5! y5 −1
7! y7.
Now, f(x) = g(2x), so we get
P8(x) = Pg,8(2x) = 2x −4
3 x3 + 4
15 x5 −
8
315 x7.

2) Analogously for g(y) = cos y,
g(y) = g(4)(y) = g(8)(y) = cos y,
g′(y) = g(5)(y) = −sin y,
g′′(y) = g(6)(y) = −cos y,
g(3)(y) = g(7)(y) = sin y,
thus
Pg,8(y) = 1 −1
2! y2 + 1
4! y4 −1
6! y6 + 1
8! y8.
Then by putting f(x) = g(2x),
P8(x) = Pg,8(2x) = 1 −2x2 + 2
3 x4 −4
45 x6 +
2
315 x8.
3) We simply get by a squaring
P8(x) = (1 + x2)2 = 1 + 2x2 + x4.
Example 3.6 Prove that a Taylor polynomial with the point of expansion x0 = 0 of an odd (an even,
resp.) function only contains odd (even, resp.) powers of x.
A function f(x) is called odd, if f/ −x) = −f(x), and it is called even, if f(−x) = f(x).
A. Taylor expansion of an odd (even, resp.) function.
D. Diﬀerentiate the deﬁnitions of an odd, (an even, resp.)function.
I. When f(−x) = −f(x) is odd we get by diﬀerentiation,
dn
dxn f(−x) = (−1)nf (n)(x) = −f (n)(x).
By a rearrangement followed by putting x = 0 we get
{(−1)n + 1}f (n)(0) = 0.
If n = 2m is even, then (−1)2m + 1 = 2 ̸= 0, and f (2m)(0) = 0. We conclude that the Taylor
polynomial only contains powers of x of odd exponents.
If instead f(−x) = f(x) is even, then we get by diﬀerentiation,
dn
dxn f(−x) = (−1)nf (n)(−x) = f (n)(x).
If we put x = 0, we get by a rearrangement,
{(−1)n −1}f (n)(0) = 0.
When n = 2m + 1 is odd, then (−1)2m+1 −1 = −2 ̸= 0, so f (2m+1)(0) = 0. We conclude that the
Taylor polynomial only contain powers of x of even exponents.

Example 3.7 Find the Taylor polynomial diﬀerent from 0 of lowest degree for the functions
(1) f(x) = 6 sin x −6x + x3,
(2) f(x) = ln(1 + x) −x.
A. The meaning is that one shall ﬁnd the smallest n, for which
1
n!f (n)(0) ̸= 0.
The simplest method is of course to insert known series, but this is not the purpose, so we shall
here choose the most diﬃcult method, which also will indicate the order of the zero at x = 0 for
the function.
D. Diﬀerentiate and put x = 0.

f ′(0) = 6 −6 + 0 = 0,

A. Taylor expansions.
D. Diﬀerentiate three times.

1 −x + sin(x2).
A. Taylor expansions.
D. Either diﬀerentiate six times (this is not done here), or insert known series. We shall here use the

A. Taylor expansions.
D. When the order is as big as n = 8, one should probably avoid the method of successive diﬀerenti-
ations. Instead we insert known series development.

This method is in general wrong, because we do not know how to differentiate
the unspecified ε(x)-term! These derivatives may in some cases be very large, indeed. The
annoying thing of this example is that it can here be proved (with some more theory!) that in
this present case this method is legal, but this theory is not in general known to to the students
at this stage!
We use instead that
sin x = 1
1! x −1
3! x3 + 1
5! x5 −1
7! x+x8ε(x),
and that if follows from (5) that
−2xe−x2 = −2x + 2x3 −x5 + 1
3 x7 + x8ε(x),
hence

had diﬀerentiated the result of (1).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Example 3.15 Write a MAPLE programme, which sketches the graph of the Taylor polynomial of
order 6 with the point x0 = 0 as extension point in the interval [−3, 3] for the function
f(x) = ln(1 +
√
1 + sin x),
x ∈R.
A. MAPLE programme.
D. This example, found in some textbook, is rather strange because one would usually instead directly
sketch the graph of the function itself. One will almost always lose some information by considering
the Taylor polynomial instead. An exception is of course when the function is itself a polynomial
and we want the Taylor polynomial of at least the same order as the degree of the polynomial.
D. The ﬁrst command is
taylor(ln(1+sqrt(1+sin(x))),x=0,6);

Example 3.16 Find for every one of the following functions f(x) an expression for f (n)(0), and then
ﬁnd the approximating polynomial of at most degree n at the point x0 = 0 for f(x).
(1) f(x) = ax,
(2) f(x) =
1
1 −x,
(3) f(x) =
1
2 + x.
A. Approximating polynomials. Note that (1) is almost the same as Example 3.11 (1).
D. Just diﬀerentiate.
I. 1) It follows immediately from f(x) = ax = ex ln a that
f (n)(x) = (ln a)nex ln a,
f (n)(0) = (ln a)n,
hence
Pn(x) = 1 + 1
1! ln a · x + 1
2! (ln a)2x2 + · · · + 1
n! (ln a)2 xn.
2) When f(x) =
1
1 −x we get
f ′(x) =
1!
(1 −x)2
and
f ′′(x) =
2!
(1 −x)3 .
Assume that
f (n) =
n!
(1 −x)n+1 .
We see that this is true for n = 0, n = 1 and n = 2. Then by a diﬀerentiation of the assumption
we get
f (n+1)(x) =
(n + 1)!
(1 −x)n+2 =
(n + 1)!
(1 −x)(n+1)+1 ,
i.e. a formula of the same structure, only with n replaced by n + 1. Hence we conclude by
induction that
f (n)(x) =
n!
(1 −x)n+1
and
f (n)(0) = n!,
f (n)(0)
n!
= 1.
Hence
Pn(x) = 1 + x + x2 + · · · + xn.
3) When
f(x) =

2 + x = 1

Example 3.17 One often applies Taylor expansions in physics and technical sciences to approximate
functions which cannot be calculated directly. The procedure is often that one expands up to some
given order and neglect the remainder term. One example is
(5) T(A) =

π
2
0
1

1 −A2 sin2 t
dt.
One cannot calculate the integral directly. The task is now to give a procedure which shows how T(A)
depends on A for small values of A (this integral occurs e.g. in the formula of the oscillation time for
a mathematical pendulum).
1) Find the Taylor expansion of order n = 4 for the function
f(x) =
1
√
1 −x2k2 .
2) Find the Taylor expansion of order n = 4 for the integrand in (5), where A is the variable while t
in this connection is kept ﬁxed.
3) Replace the integrand in (5) by the found approximation and then ﬁnd a corresponding approxi-
mation of T(A).
[There will occur some integrals which the student must ﬁnd in a table, because they are not known
at this stage.]
A. Approximation of an elliptic integral.
D. Find the Taylor expansion of the integrand.

Example 3.18 In this example we shall derive a formula which approximates the length of a circular
arc. This formula is due to Huygens (1629–1695). We shall use the ﬁgure and the notation given in
the text. We shall assume that the angle ϕ satisﬁes ϕ ∈

0, π

.
Figure 11: Circle of radius r, centre angle ϕ, thus periphery angle ϕ
2 below. The arc is denoted by ℓ,
and the corresponding cord is denoted by d. Finally, we let s denote the height on the dotted vertical
diagonal.
The approximating expression ˜ℓof the length ℓis given in the form
˜ℓ= ad + bs,
where a and b are constants which will be found below.
1) First prove that
˜ℓ= 2ar sin ϕ
2 + br sin ϕ.
2) We consider ˜ℓas a function of ϕ. Find the approximating polynomial P3(ϕ) and the corresponding
remainder term R3(ϕ) with the point of expansion ϕ = 0.
3) Find the constants a and b, such that P3(ϕ) = ℓ= 2rϕ, and set up the corresponding approximation
˜ℓexpressed by d and s.
4) Prove that
|ℓ−˜ℓ| ≤
r
180 · ϕ5.
A. An approximation with given guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) It follows from some simple geometric considerations (look at some rectangular triangles) that
d = 2r sin ϕ
2
and
s = r sin ϕ,
thus
˜ℓ= ad + bs = 2ar sin ϕ
2 + br sin ϕ.

Limit processes
Example 4.1 Find the following limits by means of a Taylor expansion:
(1)
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x) −x
x2
,
(2)
lim
x→0
6 sin x −6x + x3
x3
.
A. A Taylor expansion.
D. Find the order of the zero in the denominator. Then expand the numerator to the same order,
and then ﬁnally take the limit.
I. 1) Since x2 is 0 of order 2, we expand the numerator f(x) = ln(1 + x) −x to the order 2. Then
f(0) = 0 and
f ′(x) =
1
1 + x −1,
f ′′(x) = −
1
(1 + x)2 ,
so f ′(0) = 0 and f ′′(0) = −1. Then
f(x) = ln(10x) −x = −1
2 x2 + x2ε(x),
where ε(x) →0 for x →0.
Finally, we get by insertion and a limit process that
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x) −x
x2
= lim
x→0
−1
2 x2 + x2ε(x)
x2
= −1
2.
2) Since the denominator x3 is 0 of order 3, we expand the numerator
f(x) = 6 sin x −6x + x3,
f(0) = 0,
to the order 3. Then by diﬀerentiation,
f ′(x) = 6 cos x −6 + 3x2,
f ′(0) = 0,
f ′′(x) = −6 sin x + 6x,
f ′′(0) = 0,
f (3)(x) = −6 cos x + 6,
f (3)(0) = 0,
hence
f(x) = 0 + x3ε(x),
hvor ε(x) →0 for x →0.
Finally, we get by insertion and a limit process,
lim
xε0
6 sin x −6x + x3
x3
= lim
x→0
x3ε(x)
x3
= 0.
Remark. The method above is the one which should be used when one is learning the technique.
Later on one should instead use that the Taylor expansions taken from x0 = 0 are known for most
of the important functions. I shall in the following also demonstrate how one uses such tables.

A. Limits by a Taylor expansion.
D. Then denominator is in both cases 0 of order 3 at x0 = 0. We therefore expand the numerator to
the order 3. We shall here use the direct method, where we assume the series expansions known.
I. 1) From
ex = 1 + x + 1
2 x2 + 1

Example 4.3 Find by means of a Taylor expansion the following limits,
(1)
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x)
e2x −1 ,
(2)
lim
x→0
1 −cos2 x
x tan x .
A. Limits found by means of a Taylor expansion.
D. The order of the zero at 0 of the denominator is 1 in (1), and 2 in (2), so the numerators should
be expanded similarly.
I. 1) From ln(1 + x) = x + xε(x) and e2x −1 = 2x + xε(x), we get by insertion that
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x)
e2x −1
= lim
x→0
x + xε(x)
2x + xε(x) = lim
x→0
1 + εx
2 + ε(x) = 1
2.
2) Since 1 −cos2 x = sin2 x, we can actually here make a shortcut, because
1 −cos2 x
x tan x
=
sin2 x
x · sin x
cos x
= sin x
x
· cos x.

(1)
lim
x→0+
ln x
x2 + x + 1,
(2)
lim
x→0

do not exist.
A. Both limits should be divergent.
D. Clearly, the denominator is ̸= 0 for x = 0 in (1), thus since the numerator tends to −∞, it follows
by inspection that (1) is divergent. We shall use a little more in (2) to get to the same conclusion.
I. 1) Since the numerator tends to −∞, and the denominator tends to 1 for x →0, we see that
lim
x→0+
ln x
x2 + x + 1 = −∞
is divergent.
2) Put f(x) = sin(x + x3) −x. Then f(0) = 0, and
f ′(x) = (1 + 3x2) cos x −1,
f ′(0) = 0,
f ′′(x) = −(1 + 3x2) sin x + 6x cos x,
f ′′(0) = 0,
f (3)(x) = (5 −3x2) cos x −6x sin x,
f (3)(0) = 5,
hence
f(x) = sin(x + x3) −x = 5
3! x3 + x3ε(x).
Then by insertion,

A. Limit processes. In all three cases one should use common sense instead of some standard method.
The two ﬁrst cases are divergent, and indeed it does not in (1) give sense to write lim without any
speciﬁcation of the limit process, because one may obtain diﬀerent possible limit values according
to whether one approaches π
2 from above or from below.
D. In all three cases we either inspect, or rearrange in a convenient way.

2) If x →0+, then the numerator tends to +∞while the denominator tends to 1, so

Example 4.6 Consider the functions below for x →0 by ﬁrst putting all the terms on the same
fraction line:
(1) f(x) =
1
ln(1 + x) −1
x2 ,
(2) f(x) =
1
sin x −
1
ex −1.
A. A limit process. A reasonable guess is that (1) is divergent, because ln(1 + x) = x + xε(x) is of
lower degree than x2.
D. Put all the terms on the same fraction line and the ﬁnd the Taylor expansions of the numerator
and the denominator.
I. 1) We get by some Taylor expansions,
f(x)
=
1
ln(1 + x) −1
x2 = x2 −ln(1 + x)
x2 ln(1 + x)
= x2 −x + xε(x)
x2{x + xε(x)}
=
x
x3 · −1 + x + ε(x)
1 + ε(x)
= −1
x2 · 1 + ε(x)
1 + ε(x).
The last factor tends to 1, so f(x) →−∞for x →0.
Remark. Suppose now that the example contains an error, so that we should have had 1
x
instead of 1
x2 . Then we get the following expansions
f(x)
=
1
ln(1 + x) −1
x = x −ln(1 + x)

A. Limit processes.
D. Use common sense.
I. 1) Since x2 > 0 is dominating for x ̸= 0 close to zero, the sign must be positive.
2) If n is even, then xn + ε(x) · xn is positive in a neighbourhood of zero.
If n is odd, then xn + ε(x) · xn is positive for x positive, and negative for x negative.

x ∈]1, +∞[.
What happens to f(x) under each of the limit processes x →1+ and x →+∞?
Consider each of the following functions under the given limit process by putting the dominating term
outside as a factor:
1) f(x) = ex −x2 for x →+∞.
2) f(x) = ln(1 + x2) + x for x →−∞.
3) f(x) = ln x + 1
x for x →0+.

Example 4.9 Let f, g : ]0, ∞[ →R be two diﬀerentiable functions where g′(x) ̸= 0 for every
x ∈]0, ∞[. Check in each of the following cases whether the claim is correct or wrong:
1) Assume that f(x) →∞for x →0, and g(x) →−∞for x →0.
If f ′(x)
g′(x) →c for x →0, where c ∈R, then f(x)
g(x) →c for x →0.
2) Assume that f(x) →0 for x →0, and g(x) →0 for x →0.
If f(x)
g(x) →c for x →0, where c ∈R, then f ′(x)
g′(x) →c for x →0.
3) Assume that f(x) →0 for x →∞, and g(x) →∞for x →∞.
If f ′(x)g′(x) →c (∈R) for x →∞, then f(x)g(x) →c for x →∞.
A. General limit processes and l’Hospital’s rules.
D. Analyze each of the cases. Give counterexamples, if possible.
I. 1) If we put h(x) = −g(x), then
f(x) →+∞
and
h(x) →+∞
for x →0+,
and h′(x) = −g′(x) ̸= 0. It follows from l’Hospital’s second rule that
f ′(x)
h′(x) = f ′(x)
−g′(x) →−c
for x →0+,
implies
f(x)
g(x) = −f(x)
h(x) →−(−c) = c

2) This claim is wrong. Let e.g.
f(x) = x sin 1

g(x) = √x.
Then f(x) →0 and g(x) →0 for x →0+, because e.g.
|f(x)| =

Example 3.18 In this example we shall derive a formula which approximates the length of a circular
arc. This formula is due to Huygens (1629–1695). We shall use the ﬁgure and the notation given in
the text. We shall assume that the angle ϕ satisﬁes ϕ ∈

0, π

.
Figure 11: Circle of radius r, centre angle ϕ, thus periphery angle ϕ
2 below. The arc is denoted by ℓ,
and the corresponding cord is denoted by d. Finally, we let s denote the height on the dotted vertical
diagonal.
The approximating expression ˜ℓof the length ℓis given in the form
˜ℓ= ad + bs,
where a and b are constants which will be found below.
1) First prove that
˜ℓ= 2ar sin ϕ
2 + br sin ϕ.
2) We consider ˜ℓas a function of ϕ. Find the approximating polynomial P3(ϕ) and the corresponding
remainder term R3(ϕ) with the point of expansion ϕ = 0.
3) Find the constants a and b, such that P3(ϕ) = ℓ= 2rϕ, and set up the corresponding approximation
˜ℓexpressed by d and s.
4) Prove that
|ℓ−˜ℓ| ≤
r
180 · ϕ5.
A. An approximation with given guidelines.
D. Follow the guidelines.
I. 1) It follows from some simple geometric considerations (look at some rectangular triangles) that
d = 2r sin ϕ
2
and
s = r sin ϕ,
thus
˜ℓ= ad + bs = 2ar sin ϕ
2 + br sin ϕ.

Example 4.15 Apply l’Hospital’s rule to ﬁnd the following limits
(1)
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x)
e2x −1 ,
(2)
lim
x→0
1 −cos2 x
x tan x .
A. Limits found by an application of l’Hospital’s rule.
D. Always start by checking the numerator and the denominator separately.
I. 1) Let T(x) = ln(1 + x) and N(x) = e2x −1. Then T(0) = 0 and N(0) = 0, thus
lim
x→0
ln(1 + x)
e2x −1
= lim
x→0
T ′(x)
N ′(x) = lim
x→0

2.
Alternatively we get by using the Taylor expansions,
ln(1 + x)
e2x −1
=
x + xε(x)
1 + 2x + xε(x) −1 = 1 + ε(x)
2 + ε(x) →1
2
for x →0.
2) We get by a reduction
1 −cos2 x
x tan x
=
sin2 x
x · sin x
cos x
= cos x · sin x
x
=
cos x · sin x
x
→1 · 1
for x →0,
because we know from the textbook that
lim x →0sin x
x
= 1.
Alternatively we put T(x) = 1−cos2 x and N(x) = x· tan x. Then T(0) = 0 and N(0) = 0,
hence
lim
x→0
1 −cos2 x
x · tan x = lim
x→0
T ′(x)
N ′(x) = lim
x→0
2 sin x · cos x
x(1 + tan2 x) + tan x.
Now T ′(0) = 0 and N ′(0) = 0, so we proceed by
= lim
x→0
T ′′(x)
N ′′(x) = lim
x→0
2 cos2 x −2 sin2 x
2(1 + tan2 x) + x · 2 tan x · (1 + tan2 x) = 2

Second variant. By successive diﬀerentiations we get with the point of expansion t0 = 0,
ϕ(t)

ϕ(3)(t)

t3 = 6
3! t3 = t3.
This bullet can be solved in at least four ways:
First variant. Using a simple rearrangement we get by some ε-functions that

Then apply the result from (1),

6 t3 + t3 ε(t)
= 1 + ε(t)

for t →0.
Second variant. Even if one does not use the trick of applying the result of the First variant,
it is still possible to solve the problem by using ε-functions:
sinh t −sin t · cos t

6 t3 + t3 ε(t),
and then continue as in the First variant.
3. variant. The approximating polynomial by the method of diﬀerentiation. If we put
ψ(t) = sinh t −sin t · cos t,
then
ψ(t)
=
sinh t −sin t · cos t,
ψ(0)
=
0,
ψ′(t)
=
cosh t −cos2 t + sin2 t,
ψ′(0)

4. variant. Application of l’Hospital’s rule where we forget that some of the calculations already
have been made in (1):
T(t) = ϕ(t) = t −t e−t2,
T(0) = 0,
N(t) = sinh t −sin t · cos t,
N(0) = 0.
T ′(t) = 1 −e−t2 + 2t2 e−t2,
T ′(0) = 0,
N ′(t) = cosh t −cos2 t + sin2 t,
N ′(0) = 0,
T ′′(t) = 6 t e−t2 −4 t3 e−t2,
T ′′(0) = 0,
N ′′(t) = sinh t + 4 sin t · cos t,
N ′′(0) = 0,
T (3)(t) = 6 e−t2 −24 t2 e−t2 + 8 t4 e−t2,
T (3)(0) = 6,
N (3)(t) = cosh t + 4 cos2 t −4 sin2 t,
N (3)(0) = 5.
From
T(0) = T ′(0) = T ′′(0) = 0,
N(0) = N ′(0) = N ′′(0) = 0,
we conclude by successively applying l’Hospital’s rule that

Example 4.23 (Cf. Example 2.14). Given the function
f(x) = cos
1
2 x2 + x
	
,
x ∈R.
1) Find the Taylor polynomial P2(x) with the point of expansion x0 = 0 for f(x).
2) Prove that
|f(x) −P −2(x)| < 8 · 10−3
for |x| < 1

3) Find the limit

.
A. Taylor expansion, error estimate, limit.
D. 1) Use one of the standard methods by the calculation of the Taylor expansion.
2) Estimate the remainder term of the Taylor expansion.
3) Use (1) and (2) in the limit process.
I. 1) The simplest method is to use the series expansion. (An alternative solution is given in the
next bullet.) We ﬁnd
f(x)
=
1 −1

=

2 x3 + x3ε(x).
Hence,
P2(x) = 1 −1
2 x2
og
P3(x) = 1 −1
2 x2 −1
2 x3,
where we shall use P3(x) in (3).
2) By successive diﬀerentiations we get
f ′(x)
=
−(x + 1) sin
1
2 x2 + x
	
,
f ′′(x)
=
−(x + 1)2 cos

=
(x + 1)3 sin
1
2 x2 + x
	
−3(x + 1) cos
1
2 x2 + x
	
.
Thus again
P2(x) = f(0) + f ′(0) · x + 1
2! f ′′(0) · x2 = 1 + 0 −1
2 x2 = 1 −1
2 x2.

By Taylor’s formula there exists a ξ somewhere between 0 and x, such that
f(x) = P2(x) = 1

Then we have the estimate

Example 4.24 Find the limit
lim

.
A. Limit by an application of a Taylor expansion.
D. Set up Taylor’s formula for n = 4 and point of expansion x0 = 0, and then insert.
I. When f(x) = ln cosh x, we have
f ′(x) = sin x
cosh x = tanh x,
f ′′(x) = 1 −tanh2 x,
f (3)(x) = −2 tanh x(1 −tanh2 x) = 2 tanh3 x −2 tanh x,
f (4)(x) = (6 tanh2 x −2)(1 −tanh2 x),
thus
ln cosh x
=
f(0) + 1
1! f ′(0) x + 1
2! f ′′(0) x2 + 1
3! f (3)(0) x3

I. Clearly, f(x) is deﬁned for −π
2 < x < π
2 , because cos x > 0 in this interval. Then by diﬀerentiation,
f(x)
=
ln cos x,
f ′(x)
=
−sin x
cos x = −tan x,
f ′′(x)
=
−tan2 x −1,
f (3)(x)
=
−2 tan x(1 + tan2 x) = −2 sin x
cos3 x .
If x0 = 0, then
ln cos x
=
f(0) + 1
1! f ′(0) x + 1
2! f ′′(0) x2 + 1
3! f (3)(ξ) x3

hence,
P4(x) = 1 + x2 −1


1 + 2x2 = P4(x) + x4 ε(x).
2) When we insert the result above we get

and
N(x) = x · sin(2x),
then both T(x) and N(x) are of class C∞and T(0) = 0 and N(0) = 0. Then by a couple of
diﬀerentiations
T ′(x) = −6x · e3x2,
T ′(0) = 0,
N ′(x) = sin(2x) + 2x · cos(2x),
N ′(0) = 0,
og
T ′′(x) = −6 · e3x2 −36x2,
T ′′(0) = −6,
N ′′(x) = 4 cos(2x) −4x2 sin(2x),
N ′′(0) = 4.

Asymptotes
Example 5.1 Find the possible asymptotes for the functions
(1) f(x) = x2 1 −ex
1 + ex ,
(2) f(x) = ln

e2x + e−2x
.
A. Asymptotes.
D. The functions are deﬁned for every x. Therefore, we shall only consider what happens for x →+∞
and for x →−∞.
I. 1) It follows from
1 −ex
1 + ex =
2
1 + ex −1,
that this expression tends towards -1 for x →+∞(cf. the latter expression), and towards
+1 for x →−∞(cf. the former expression). This means that f(x) ∼−x2 for x →+∞and
f(x) ∼x2 for x →−∞, and we do not have any asymptote.

3) Prove that the graph of f has two asymptotes, and ﬁnd an equation for each of these.
A. Approximating polynomial; limit; asymptotes. The example is very similar to Example 4.12.

that the approximating polynomial is

1! x −4
2! x2 = 2x −2x2,
and since f(x) is of class C∞in its domain, we get
f(x) = 2x −2x2 + x2ε(x).

Figure 26: The graph of the integrand x e−x.
I. (a) We see that f(x) = x e−x is deﬁned for every x ∈R. We conclude from
f ′(x) = (1 −x)e−x,
that f(x) has at maximum for x = 1, and that clearly f(x) →0 for x →+∞, and that the
integrand is ≥0 everywhere.

(b) The function f(x) =
2x + 1
x2 + x −2 is deﬁned for x ̸= 1 and x ̸= 2. It follows by a decomposition
that
f(x) =
1
x + 2 +
1
x −1 < 0
for x ∈[0, 1[,
so an integral is

1
x + 2 dx +

1
x −1 dx = ln(x + 2) + ln(1 −x),
where alternatively one could have noticed directly that the numerator is the derivative of
the dominator, thus

2x + 1
x2 + x −2 dx = ln
x2 + x −2
 .
Now, ln(1 −x) →−∞for x →1−, so the integral is divergent.

I. (a) The function f(x) = sin x is deﬁned for every x ∈R with the indeﬁnite integral −cos x, so
 x
0
sin x dx = 1 −cos x.
Since 1 −cos x does not have a limit for x →+∞, the improper integral is divergent.
Remark. The correct procedure of dealing with improper integrals is always ﬁrst to split the
integrand into a positive part f + ≥0 and a “negative part” f −≥0, such that
f(x) = f +(x) −f −(x),
where more precisely
f +(x) = max{f(x), 0}
and
f −(x) = max{−f(x), 0}.

The improper integral is convergent, if and only if

f +(x) dx
og

f −(x) dx
are both convergent, and if so, then

f(x) dx =

f +(x) dx −

f −(x) dx.
I am often missing this clariﬁcation in elementary textbooks. In the case above we may of
course make a shortcut, because it is obvious that the limit does not exist. One can, however,
construct cases, in which the limit exists for the indeﬁnite integral, and where the improper
integral does not exist in the strict sense given above. ♦

We conclude from ln | ln x| →−∞for x →1−, and ln | ln x| →+∞for x →0+, that the

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

I. 1) By a rearrangement of the diﬀerential equation and insertion of x = 0 we get

D. Decompose successively. Then consider the diﬀerence in degrees and apply the decomposition
from (1).

Example 6.22 Check if the improper integral
 +∞
1
sin 1
x
x2
dx
is convergent or divergent.
A. Improper integral.
D. If x > 1
π , then the integrand is positive. By a ﬁnite truncation and the substitution t = 1
x we get
 n
1
sin 1
x
x2
dx
=
 1
1
n
sin t dt = [−cos t]1
1
n
=
cos 1
n −cos 1 →1 −cos 1
for n →+∞,
thus the improper integral is convergent, and its value is
 +∞
1
sin 1
x
x2
dx = 1 −cos 1.
Remark. Strictly speaking one is only asked about the convergence or the divergence. Therefore,
the following is suﬃcient:
The integrand is continuous in the closed and bounded interval

1, 1
π

, hence the integral exists
in this interval.
For x ∈
 1
π , +∞

we get the estimate
0 ≤
sin 1
x
x2
≤1
x2 .
Since 1
x2 can be integrated to inﬁnity, the same holds for the smaller integrand, and the improper
integral is convergent. ♦
