About the Author 
Dan Appleman's career is typical of someone who, unable to choose what he 
wants to do for a living, decides to do everything. From founding a software 
company (Desaware), to cofounding a publishing company (Apress), to pro-
gramming, to writing books (this is his seventh), he's a Brm believer that the 
question 'What do you want to be when you grow up?" can't and shouldn't be 
answered until you're at least 80 (so he has a way to go). 
Meanwhile, he's also a consultant, public speaker, and columnist, and vol-
unteers as a youth group advisor (which is how he knows the kinds of security 
issues teens actually face today).

Acknowledgments 
I imagine this is how it feels to win an Oscar award, and have just 60 seconds 
to thank everyone involved in your project-hoping you won't miss anyone. 
It takes a lot of people to put a book together. First, there's the great crew 
at Apress. On the editorial side, there's Gary Cornell, of course, and Grace 
Wong (working her usual magic), and Dominick Shakeshaft, who was espe-
cially helpful in encouraging me to go all out with this project. It's a thrill 
working again with Sofia Marchant, Ami Knox, and Kari Brooks, and for the 
first time with Ellie Fountain and Elizabeth Berry-thanks to them, this was 
by far the smoothest and highest quality experience I've had with a book. I'd 
also like to thank Doris Wong, Hollie Fischer, Julie Miller, Stephany Le, and 
Glyn Davies, whose input and support was and will continue to be invaluable. 
And kudos to Kurt Krames for his interior design and brilliant cover. 
Many thanks to Roan Bear for her help designing the web site. 
Thanks also to the crew at Desaware, especially Franky Wong, Karyn 
Duncan, Marian Kicklighter, and Stjepan Pejic, who kept the company 
running while I was off writing this book. Thanks to my family for keeping 
me running while I was off writing this book (especially my mom, whose food 
is both good and plentiful). 
There is one group of people whom I Simply cannot thank enough for their 
help. They are my reviewers-most of whom range in age from 13 to 19, who 
went over each chapter in detail as it was written. They contributed suggestions, 
corrected errors, and pointed out areas that were unclear. Their (sometimes 
brutal) comments often resulted in changes, ranging from minor rephrasing, to 
immediate deletion, to wholesale rewriting of entire sections of the book. And 
I'm espeCially grateful for the support they expressed along the way.

Also thanks to Daniel, Boaz, Kendra, Gon, El-ad, Roi, and many others 
who offered feedback and suggestions at various times. 
Thanks, Curtis, for the inspiration-even though you had to get hacked to 
make it happen. 
And a special thanks to Jeff Haritan and the folks at the brainstorming 
meeting for the title. You were right (as usual). 

Introduction 
Does your computer sometimes crash for no reason-or act strangely? Are 
you seeing unexpected lag or sudden dropouts when playing online games? 
Has your Internet connection gotten slower? Are mysterious pop-up windows 
appearing at strange times? Have you discovered that someone has imperson-
ated you on an instant messenger program without your knowledge? Are you 
OK with strangers (or friends or family members) knowing everything you do 
on your computer? Have you ever wondered which of those amazing e-mail 
offers are actually true? 
This book was inspired by a call I recently received from my nephew. For 
some reason, his computer desktop was just Vanishing at random times-usually 
a few minutes after turning on his system. It turned out his computer had been 
infected with a nasty program called a computer virus. 
N ow my nephew is smart. He knows not to download and run programs 
unless he knows where they come from. He knows what a virus is. Yet, to 
my surprise, he didn't have an up-to-date virus protection program on his 
computer. 
The next week I helped a friend of his out whose computer was attacked 
by another program called a Trojan-I'll tell you more about that in the book. 
It turns out that teens actually have more sophisticated security needs than 
most adults. It's not enough for you to know about flrewalls-you need to 
know how to keep one up while playing online games. You're much more 
likely than most adults to be using Kazaa or other peer-to-peer file services, 
and you're much more likely to be downloading files. The kinds of identity 
theft you are likely to experience are very different from those experienced 
by your parents. And because in many families teens know more about com-
puters than their parents, it can sometimes be difflcult to find help when 
problems occur. 
This book covers all of these issues and more. It's a book about computer 
security-the flrst one ever written for teens and young adults. It goes far 
beyond the usual "beware the dangers of chat rooms" warnings to teach you 
--

.lil .. 411' Introduction 
everything you need to know to protect your computer, your privacy, and 
yourself. 
Even if you are a beginner now, by the time you finish this book, you'll know 
more about computer security than almost everyone you know. You'll know 
how to clean viruses off a system (and maybe even get paid for it). You'll learn 
how antivirus tools and firewalls work-and how they can fail! You'll know 
how to play online games without opening your system to attack by outsiders. 
You'll know how to surf the web and shop without leaving traces for advertisers 
(and others) to follow. You'll even know about cyberterrorism, and how you can 
help prevent it. 
And best of all, you'll be able to help your friends and family members 
clean up and secure their systems. Because let's face it-they probably need 
all the help they can get. 
What Isn't in This Book 
No book can satisfY all the people all the time. And computer security is a vast 
subject, so some things will be left out, and others may disagree on what I've 
chosen to emphasize. So here's a bit about my philosophy in writing this book, 
and the things that I'm assuming as I write it: 
• I'm going to assume that you know the basics about using your 
computer. I'm not going to waste your time with pages explaining what a 
computer is, how to use a web browser, or how to run a program from 
the Start menu. Most of you are already routinely using your computer 
for a variety of tasks. So if you're a real computer beginner, you might 
want to get a more introductory book before going for this one. 
• There are so many different web pages, viruses, virus scanners, firewalls, 
routers, scams, versions of Windows and browsers, and so on, that 
detailed instructions on how to deal with each of them is impossible to 
include without turning this book into a massive encyclopedia. Not only 
that, but threats and technology evolve, so discussing particular viruses 
and scams and applications is pOintless. Instead, I'm going to try to take 
you behind the scenes to understand the nature of the threats and how 
they work. That knowledge, with a bit of common sense, should be 
enough for you to apply the knowledge to your particular computer 
and environment. 
• There are books out there for parents that teach them how to monitor 
their kids online. This isn't one of them. This book is written for you to 
help you take responsibility for protecting your own computer, privacy, 
and yourself. 

Running Head Information il:li"lfIi •• 
• It is not for me to judge what kinds of web sites you visit or files you 
download. My job is to teach you how to protect yourself. The decision 
of what kinds of web sites are appropriate or inappropriate, what kinds 
of files you download, and so on is between you and your parents or 
teachers. Every family and community has their own standards, and 
I have no intention of trying to impose my values on you . 
• This book only covers Windows. That's because most teens (like most 
everyone) use Windows desktops. However, the principles do apply 
to other operating systems as well, so much of the book will have value 
even if you aren't using Windows. 
About Footnotes 
You'll notice a lot of footnotes appear in this book. These aren't the "be sure 
you cite your sources" footnotes that your teachers force you to use in English 
or History (you know, the ones full of ibid and opcit and other fun Latin 
terms). I use footnotes for two things: First, ifI use a term that I think most 
of you will understand, but that might confuse some readers, I'll use a foot-
note to clarifY it. Second, I like to use footnotes for side stories and comments 
that are hopefully entertaining and humorous, but not really essential. 
Those of you who understand the text and find my sense of humor to be 
incompatible with your own,l feel free to ignore the footnotes completely. 
About AlwaysUseProtection.com 
Almost every author of computer-related books provides a way for readers to 
obtain updates and corrections to their books-after all, things change rapidly 
in this field. 
In this case, I wanted a way to not only offer updates and corrections, 
but also go into more detail on specific situations, and even answer reader 
questions. To my astonishment, the domain name Always U seProtection.com 
was available, so that's where you can go to find not only updates, but also 
whatever else I feel like posting. My hope is the site will be useful, but I also 
plan to have fun with it. 
I Those of you without a sense of humor should definitely skip the footnotes. 

Mhi Introduction 
For My Readers Outside of the U.S. 
The web is called the World Wide Web for a reason. It truly is international. 
Yet there are some areas where this book is unavoidably U.S.-centric. For 
example, any references to specific laws refer to U.S. laws. 
It is my hope to include information for other countries on 
AlwaysUseProtection.com. But to do so, I need your help. If there is anything 
country specific that you would like to contribute, please submit it on the web 
site in the feedback section for the appropriate chapter. 

Introduction for Parents 
Some of you may be wondering, Where are all the horror stories and warnings 
about how to protect kids from sexual predators in chat rooms? What's all this 
talk about viruses and frrewalls and protecting the computer? Surely that's not 
as important! 
And you're right-protecting teens from online predators is important. 
And don't worry, there is a chapter on online behavior and privacy in the book. 
But online protection is a subject that is and has been widely spoken about. 
Most teens have heard about it. You've talked to your son or daughter about 
it, right? 
None of the teens that I've dealt with have had a truly dangerous online 
experience. Yes, some of then have engaged in questionable discussions 
(meaning things you would probably disapprove of), but as often as not they 
were the ones lying about who they were, and they clearly understood that the 
people they were talking to were probably lying as well. They knew better 
than to give out personal information-it was just a game. 
But most of them have suffered a computer security breach. I've helped 
many clean up after viruses and worms. I've seen numerous cases where a 
stolen password allowed someone to impersonate someone else, and have 
even seen friendships jeopardized in the process. I've seen teens have their 
machines hijacked by hackers and locked out of their own e-mail or instant 
message accounts. 
It's not enough for teens to know not to give out their personal information 
online or arrange to meet with strangers. Teens today need to understand the 
fundamentals of computer security. They need to know how to protect their 
computers and their privacy. They need to know about programs they down-
load that might spy on their activities. They need to know how to protect 
their passwords and why. 
This book will teach your teens the most important things they need to 
know. It won't protect them from every possible threat, but it will protect 
them from the kinds of security issues that they are actually dealing with 
liU:

already on a routine basis. It will help them stay out of trouble, and help 
them fIx problems once they occur. 
Appendix C has more information to help you as parents. Meanwhile, you 
don't have to do a thing-besides getting your teens this book. It's designed 
to teach them to help themselves. Though in truth, unless you're already a 
security expert, it probably won't do you any harm to read it as well.

Gremlins in Your Machine 
• You notice that for some reason your computer seems slower than it 
used to be. You've tried using the Windows disk defragmenter utility, 1 
but it didn't seem to help. 
• Internet access seems increasingly unreliable-with slower browsing 
and increased lag and dropouts while playing online games. 
• Some of the programs on your machine that used to work don't work 
anymore. 
• The light on your disk drive flashes constantly, even when you aren't 
doing anything. 
• Some web sites become inaccessible. Or typing in the name of a web 
site brings you to a completely different site. 
• Files on your computer have mysteriously vanished. 
• Your machine starts rebooting2 occasionally without cause. 
• Applications, including your desktop application, suddenly disappear. 
• You start receiving e-mail reports from friends or automated reports 
from other computers claiming that you sent out a virus. 
• Bizarre, even threatening, messages start appearing in chat windows, 
even when you aren't using an instant messaging service or visiting a 
chat site. 
• Your computer suddenly fails to boot. 
• Your hair grows three inches overnight, and you notice your friends 
holding their breath when they're within sniffing distance of you. 
I A tool available on most Windows systems to make disk access more effident. Go to your Start 
menu and selea Accessories ~ System Tools ~ Disk Defragmenter to access this tool. 
2 Rebooting is the technical term for what happens when you have jUst finished writing a paper and 
have not yet saved your work. and suddenly the screen goes blank and your computer restarts as if 
you had just turned it on. Goodbye paper. 

••• 
'.. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
OK, I'm not going to be able to help you with that last one. You'll want to 
read "Basic Hygiene for Teens" or "How to Exorcise Demons in Three Easy 
Steps" if that's your problem. But if you're seeing any of the other symptoms, 
you may have a gremlin in your computer. A vicious little fictional creature 
whose sole purpose in life is to cause grief to you and to anything technological 
in your vicinity.3 
What do fictional creatures have to do with computers? Well, it turns 
out that many of the terms I'll be using have roots in biology, history, and 
mythology-and for good cause. The software I'll be discussing behaves in 
many ways like the biological counterparts they're named after. And all of 
them, viruses, worms, bugs, etc., act just like a gremlin would could it actually 
sneak into your computer to raise havoc. I'll talk more about that later. 
If you're seeing any of the symptoms I've listed (other than the last), or any 
other unexpected or surprising behavior, you might be a victim of a computer 
virus. Oh, and there's one other symptom that indicates you may have a virus: 
Everything seems to be just fine. 
That's right. Your computer may be infected and show no symptoms at all. 
In fact, it might not even be causing you any harm at all-it may be busy 
attacking someone else without your knowledge. 
In this part of the book, you're going to learn all about the various types of 
viruses that can infest your computer, what they do, how they work, and how 
to prevent them and what to do to get rid of them if the worst happens. 
Why Should You Care? 
It's a funny thing-there are plenty of books and articles on computer security 
for businesses. And there is plenty of information for adults on how to protect 
their credit card and tax information. Yet there seems to be an unspoken 
assumption that these things aren't important for teens. It's not as if you have 
anything really important on your computers that you can't afford to lose, 
right? It's not as if you don't have plenty of extra time to reinstall software and 
try to restore your system. How important can your privacy be anyway? Who 
cares if your system goes down for a few days or weeks-you can write your 
homework by hand the way we used to when we were kids ... 
Well, I think that's total nonsense.4 
Many of the teens I know have wasted hours and days dealing with viruses. 
It's caused them to lose homework, to miss important messages from friends 
(both e-mail and instant messages), to drop out on scheduled online games, and 
3 The tenn gremlin entered widespread use around the Warld War II periad, as an imaginary creature 
that would cause mechanical failures in the airplanes of England's Royol Air Force. 
4 Writing a book for teens, I must of course be judidous in my choice of words. Please feel free to 
substitute the four-letter word or profanity of your choice for "nonsense."

themselves don't know how to prevent or clean up viruses. Life is frustrating 
enough without having to deal with unreliable computers. Computers are 
supposed to be tools to make life easier and more entertaining-not sources 
of frustration and extra work. 
There are many personal reasons why you'll benefit from having a clean 
and secure system. But it turns out there are other reasons as well. 
Just as viruses in nature try to spread from one person to the next, com-
puter viruses try to spread themselves from one computer to another. When 
your computer becomes infected, it will try to infect others by a variety of 
methods (which you'll read about in the next two chapters). Your computer 
may also be hijacked to attack web sites. 
So in protecting your own computer, you also protect those of your friends 
and neighbors, and in the event of cyberterrorism or cyberwar,5 maybe even 
your country.

When Softvvare Attacks: 
All About Viruses 
Anytime you do something on your computer, whether it's browsing the web, 
chatting with a friend on an instant messaging service, writing a paper, or 
drawing a picture, you're running a program. In fact, the Windows environ-
ment itself-the desktop that allows you to view and select files or configure 
the system-is just a collection of programs. 
A computer program is just a set of instructions to a computer. But programs 
take many forms. They can be executable files (files with the extension .exe), or 
batch files containing consolel commands (files with the extension .bat). They 
can be scripts that control other programs-for example, a program built into a 
word processing document that automatically counts the number of words or 
creates an index, or a script that controls game play on a custom game map. 
Once a program gets on your computer, it has access to pretty much all of 
the capabilities of your machine.2 As long as the software does what you want 
and expect it to do, there's no problem. But what if the author of that program 
had other things in mind? 
Evil Schemes 
There's almost no limit to the kinds of nasty things viruses and other malicious 
programs can do. Here's a brief list of some of the kinds of threats that your 
computer faces if one of these programs is allowed to run on your system. 
I A console is the window you see when you request the command prompt from the Start menu. 
It mimics an old-style DOS window where you type commands in without a graphical interface or 
mouse. 
2 There are exceptions to this, depending on the type of program or script. the language it was written 
in, and the configuration of the system. But it's best to work under the assumption that any program 
on your system can do anything the program's author wanted to do. 

__ 
-'::111' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
The Destroyers 
These are programs that have one goal-to trash your system. Some of them 
do it quickly, by simply deleting your disk partition, boot sector, or reformat-
ting your drive.3 Some do it slowly, deleting or scrambling random files until 
your system won't run. Some only target your data-scrambling or destroying 
data files while leaving key system files in place.4 
The Annoyances 
These programs don't want to destroy your system, only your sanity and 
patience. They just like to get on your nerves. Maybe they'll periodically ter-
minate your Internet connection or reboot your machine. Or throw garbage 
up on your screen or suddenly close programs. They might redirect your 
browser to different web sites, or sign you up to spam e-mail lists. 
The Thieves 
They say that information is one of the most valuable commodities, and these 
programs want to steal it from you. They want your passwords, your game 
CD-keys, and all the personal information they can get. Credit card numbers 
and tax information (with Social Security numbers) are favorites. They want to 
know what web sites you've browsed to and get copies of any e-mail you.ve 
sent or received. You'll read more about this kind of software in Part II of this 
book where I discuss privacy. 
The Hijackers 
These programs don't want to harm your computer at all. They want to take it 
over and put it to some other use. They might want to use your computer 
(along with thousands of others) to send corrupt network requests to a particu-
larweb site in order to overwhelm it and prevent others from accessing it (this 
is called a Denial of Service, or DoS, attack). They might want to tum your 
computer into an e-mail server that will allow them to use it to send out spam. 
They might hijack your hard drive to store pornography, pirate software, or 
other illegal content. 5

Chapter 2 When Software Attacks:AII About Viruses r.-
Viruses, Worms, and Trojans 
Viruses, worms, and Trojans are different kinds of malicious programs. I'll tell 
you how they differ in a moment, but in truth, most people use the term 
computer virus to refer to all three types of program. So after this section, just 
assume that when I talk about viruses I'm referring to worms or Trojans as well. 
Viruses 
In biology, a virus is a submicroscopic piece of genetic material (RNA or 
DNA) surrounded by a coat of protein. It reproduces by attacking a cell and 
hijacking its internal structure to create more viruses. Once the cell has done 
its job, it self-destructs, leaving behind even more of the virus to go and invade 
other cells. 
A computer virus does much the same thing to a computer program. 
A computer program consists of a sequence of computer commands along 
with some data. Once loaded into memory, the program "runs," meaning that 
the computer executes the command sequences. 
Figure 2-1 illustrates a normal program. Imagine that each square repre-
sents an instruction that the computer will execute. Each program has a 
starting pOint-the first instruction that runs when the program is loaded. So 
as the program runs, it will execute each instruction in tum, starting from the 
"starting point" and continuing to the end. 
Figure 2-1 A "healthy" program 
Figure 2-2 illustrates what happens when a virus infects a program. The 
virus literally modifies the program file on your disk. The gray squares repre-
sent instructions that the virus has added to the program. First, it adds addi-
tional code to the program, usually at the end of the program. The viral code is 
indicated by light gray squares. Next it changes the code at the starting loca-
tion of the program to force the computer to run the viral code. The new code 
at the starting point includes an instruction to jump to the rest of the virus 
code (as indicated by the arrow). 

__ 
II:.' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Figure 2·2 An "infected" program 
If the virus is really smart, it might also execute the healthy code, in which 
case you may never know that the virus was running. 
Viruses can do any of the things listed earlier in this chapter (and others I 
probably haven't even imagined), but there's one thing almost all of them do. 
They try to infect other flles on your system or on your network. 
Worms 
Most of the time when people talk about viruses, they're actually talking about 
worms as well. A worm differs from a virus in that it doesn't infect other flles. 
The worm is a standalone program-it works independently. 
A virus runs whenever you execute an infected program. For example, if 
your paint program is infected, anytime you try to run it the virus will run. 
Worms can't use this particular trickery, but they have their own ways to get 
started. 
• Most worms add themselves to the list of programs that should run 
automatically when your computer starts. In Appendix B of this book 
you'll learn more about self-starting programs. 
• Worms also like to trick you into running them, claiming to be some-
thing they aren't. For example, a WOrm might claim to be a game, or a 
cool program sent by a friend. In Chapter 3, you'll learn all about how 
viruses and worms spread. 
• Worms can also attack vulnerabilities in your system across a network 
or the Internet, even if you do absolutely nothing-quietly sneaking in 
without your knowledge. 
Other than being standalone programs, worms are just like viruses, and do 
the same kinds of things once running on your system. 

Chapter 2 When Software Attack.s:AII About Viruses ." ... _ 
Trojans 
Trojans are a kind of virus (actually, a worm most of the time). They're named 
after the Trojan horse.6 That's the one where the ancient Greeks defeated Troy 
by pretending to give up, leaving behind a giant wooden horse in which they 
had hidden some soldiers. The celebrating Trojans brought the horse into 
their city, only to be defeated when the soldiers snuck out at night and let the 
Greek army into the city. 
When a Trojan gets on your system, its goal is to allow outsiders into your 
system. 
Recently, my nephew visited a friend, and found him struggling with his 
computer. Every time he connected to the Internet, he'd start getting pop-up 
window messages from someone. The messages demanded he give over his 
Warcraft and Frozen Throne CD-keys, or the blackmailer would delete files 
on his system. In fact, by the time I heard about it, the system had already 
suffered quite a bit of damage-not only did his Internet browser no longer 
work, but even basic programs like Notepad had been deleted. 
You might be wondering, How did the attacker find the infected system 
when it connected to the Internet? 
The answer is that he didn't. The Trojan knew its creator and would con-
tact him every time the computer connected to the Internet. The attacker only 
needed to sit back and wait for the Trojans he sent out to call home and let 
him on to the infected systems. Some Trojans work this way, others simply 
instruct the computer to wait for instructions, configuring the computer to 
listen for future contact from the attacker-perhaps sending out an e-mail or 
other notification to the attacker so he can build a list of infected computers to 
contact at will. 
That is perhaps the scariest thing about Trojans. An ordinary virus or worm 
is preprogrammed-it can only do what was designed into it originally. As 
terrible as those things may be, at least they can be identified and dealt with. 
A Trojan opens your computer to access by outsiders-real people-and 
there's no telling what they might do on your computer. They might do noth-
ing more than keep watch on what you're dOing; waiting for some interesting 
information they can steal or use to threaten you. You may not know anything 
is wrong. 
Spyware and Adware 
Spyware and adware are both terms for software that monitors what you do 
on your system (effectively spies on you) and does something with that infor-
mation. They can range from extremely dangerous, to helpful-and in fact, in 
many cases they get installed on your system with your full permission. In fact, 
6 Not some other type of Trojan 

__ 
&;.1. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
one can argue that some of them don't qualify as viruses at all. Consider some 
of these variations: 
• A keyboard monitor spyware program might watch every keystroke you 
type, waiting for cases where it can detect you typing in an account 
name and password. Once it has them, it might send the information 
out to someone who can then use them to impersonate you-hijacking 
your bank account, e-mail service, or other online service. 
• A web page tracker might watch while you browse, and anytime you 
shop for something it might bring up a pop-up redirecting you to a 
different store, or swapping in an affiliate code7 so someone else can 
make money off your purchases. Such a tracker might also check 
pricing for you and offer you a better deal than you were about to get. 
• Some software, especially free software, includes advertising-thus the 
term adware. You accept the advertising in much the same way as you 
accept commercial television: the commercials pay for the content. 
Is an adware program that you allow on your system a virus? Probably not. 
However, I'll be honest-I'm not a big fan of such software. First, you usually 
don't know everything they do. Sometimes that information is buried in the 
fine print-you know, the endless license agreements that you accept without 
reading.8 Second, even beneficial adware might have side effects. It might 
interfere with other programs and will often slow down your system. 
So I won't tell you that you should delete all adware from your system. But 
you should be aware of what adware is present on your system, and know how 
to remove it if you don't like it. As for malicious spyware, it's a virus, period. 
I 
~ I RULE OF THUMB If you install software, and can't easily figure out 
what it does or how to remove it, you should consider it a potential 
virus. 
Adware and Log 
Spyware, adware, and P2P services such as Kazaa make use of the Internet. The 
thing to remember is that their use isn't limited to when you're actually doing 
something relating to the software. For example, you know that when you're 
downloading a me on Kazaa, or someone is uploading one from your system, 
Kazaa is making use of the Internet. But it turns out that Kazaa uses the 
7 This is a code added to a web address to help web sites know who referred them to the site. Some 
web sites will pay money to sites that generate referrals that result in sales. 
8 Almost nobody reads those agreements before clicking "/ Accept". You might try reading one some-
time-the things you are agreeing to might astonish you. 

Chapter 2 When Software Attacks:AIIAboutViruses .11I:j' __ 
Internet even when no files are being transferred. When Kazaa is running, your 
computer is part of the P2P network, and your computer will periodically send 
out and receive information relating to searches and other maintenance opera-
tions. It will also periodically download and display advertisements if you're 
using the adware version. The same applies to other adware and spyware-you 
have no control over when they connect to the Internet to perform their opera-
tions, and how much data they are transferring. 
When you're connected to the Internet, you have a certain amount of 
bandwidth available-this is the number of bytes per second that your 
Internet connection can handle. On a modem, you have up to 56 kilobits per 
second download and 28 kilobits per second upload. That translates into under 
7 kilobytes per second download and half that on upload-not very fast.9 Any 
data transferred by spyware and adware subtracts off the available bandwidth 
for other tasks. It can slow your Internet performance even on a fast DSL or 
cable line, and can make a dial-up modem connection virtually useless. 
Each spyware or adware program on your system can take up some 
bandwidth-and it can definitely add up. Worse, it's not evenly distributed-
a program may do nothing for an hour, and then try to tie up all your band-
width for several minutes. 
This "hidden" use of your Internet bandwidth can be fatal for online gam-
ing, and is actually one of the common reasons for lag and for people being 
dropped from games. You can be in the middle of a Warcraft game when an 
adware program wakes up and starts several large transfers. Next thing you 
know, your screen freezes and you find yourself dropped from the game. 
Viruses can have the same impact on bandwidth, but there are plenty of 
good reasons to get rid of viruses that have nothing to do with gaming. But 
adware is something you may allow on your system intentionally, and it's 
important you realize the side effects this may cause. 
Why Do People Write Viruses? 
Viruses cause a huge amount of harm. They cause individuals and corporations 
to lose critical data. They waste enormous amounts of time. They are expen-
sive to deal with, both in prevention and in cleanup. 
So it's worth taking a moment to consider why people write these things. 
There is the stereotype of the nerdy teenager or college student who 
writes viruses just because they can. It's part of the "hacker" mythology-a way 
to prove one's technical prowess or just get some attention. And there is some 
truth to this stereotype. I should, however, note that the use of the word 
9 There ore 8 bits in a byte, so a modem speed of 56 kilobits per second is abotn 7 kilobytes per 
second. In fa~ you'll get less, because a 56k modem only gets at best 53k In practJ·ce. 

__ ... t.' Port I Protecting Your Machine 
hacker is really incorrect here. A classic hacker is someone who delights in 
solving tough technical problems. The kind of "hacker" who writes viruses is 
more correctly called a cracker. You may also hear the terms white hat and 
black hat to replace hacker, where a white hat is someone who uses their 
knowledge of computer security for good to protect people's systems and 
privacy, and a black hat is someone who is using their skills to cause harm. 
Definitions notwithstanding, the term hacker is commonly used today to 
represent both white hats and black hats. So if, later in this book, I refer to a 
hacker attacking your system, you'll know I'm really referring to a black hat. 
Why? Because only a black hat would use their hacker skills to attack your 
system. 
For those of you who are interested in going further into computer secu-
rity or computer internals, it's a fascinating field. I would strongly encourage 
you to become a hacker in the classic sense-a white hat. Aside from the 
ethics of the matter, it's just as challenging, just as fun, and a whole lot less 
likely to land you in jail. 
The Real Threat: Cyberwar 
The media may play up the occasional teenage hacker who edits or spreads a 
virus, but that isn't where the real danger in the future lies. You may have 
already heard that more and more viruses are coming out of countries that 
aren't entirely friendly to Western ideals. As more and more of the free world's 
infrastructure and economy becomes dependent on the Internet, we become 
increasingly vulnerable to attack by terrorist organizations or unfriendly 
governments. The terms for this are cyberwar and cyberterronsm. (Perform 
an Internet search on these terms for further information-there are many 
sites that discuss the issue.) 
Cyberwar typically refers to government-sponsored attacks. These can be 
attempts to hack into sensitive government installations to obtain secrets or 
interfere with government or military operations. Or attacks on banks to try 
to Cripple the financial system. 
Cyberterrorism typically refers to attacks made by nongovernmental 
groups. OccaSionally you'll hear about acts of cyberterrorism-government or 
media web sites that are hacked into and modified for political purposes. One 
can make the argument that many viruses are, in fact, acts of cyberterrorism. 
We don't actually know what a real cyberwar would look like. You can bet 
that most governments invest heavily on both offensive and defensive tech-
niques. But considering how poorly we are handling viruses and privacy 
attacks in a time of relative peace, the thought of full-scale cyberwar is 
disturbing indeed. 
An attacker doesn't have to actually break into a web site to bring it down. 
Even the largest web site can handle only a limited number of requests at a 
time. Let's say a bank's web site can handle 50,000 requests per second-a 
very significant number. Rather than attack the bank directly, a cyberattacker 

Chapter 2 When Software Attacks:AII About Viruses .'IljL __ 
might distribute a worm that would quietly infect millions of computers. That 
worm might have a trigger date-as soon as that date arrives, every single 
infected computer tries to contact that bank's web site. Suddenly, the bank is 
receiving a million fake requests per second-far more than it can handle. 
Legitimate requests get crowded out by the fake requests-so people trying to 
contact the site see an error. This is called a Denial of Service attack. 
Because Denial of Service attacks rely on hijacking as many computers as 
possible to perform an attack on a few sites, one can argue that protecting 
your own computer and making sure it can't be hijacked isn't just a matter of 
personal defense, but of national defense as well. 
When Software Sneezes 
Biological viruses infect people in several ways. Some travel through the air 
when you sneeze or cough. Others sit on a surface until you touch it, or touch 
someone who is sick. Yet others are transferred through close contact or cuts, 
wounds, or unsterile needles. 
A virus can't hurt you until it gets inside of you, and so it is for computer 
viruses as well. They can't harm you until they find their way onto your com-
puter. Unfortunately, computer viruses have just as many ways of spreading as 
biological viruses, maybe more. 
Scientists couldn't learn how to prevent the spread of disease until they 
understood how viruses and bacteria spread.10 So you too will need to learn 
something about how computer viruses spread, the subject of the next chapter, 
before you'll be able to deal with them effectively. 
10 For example, the reduction in worldwide cases of malaria didn't begin with vaccines or 
medication--it began with the discovery that malaria was spread by mosquitoes.

From Sneaks to Slammers: 
HO¥lViruses Get on Your 
System 
So far you've learned about the different kinds of viruses and the kinds of 
things they do. But before a virus can do anything, it has to be running on your 
computer-which means that it has to get onto your system in the first place. 
That's what this chapter is all about. I'll include some hints and previews on 
how to protect yourself in this chapter, but the focus will be on how the viruses 
spread-protection will be the focus of the six chapters that follow. 
Dueling Perspectives 
Sometimes it's important to look at a subject from two different points of 
view in order to really understand it. In this case, allow me to introduce two 
fictional guest authors to share their own perspectives. 
Dr. T, the Engineer, Says ... 
As future computer engineers, we deal with the tangible and measurable. 
A bit of Simple lOgiC is all it takes for you to und rstand exactly how viruses 
spread, and consequently, how you can block them. 
Viruses can enter your computer through two channels and two channels 
only: 
• Physical media: That include CDs, DVDs floppy disks, and memory 
sticks (USB or other) 
• Your network: That includes both direct network connections and 
e-mail 
Let's take a quick look at each of these. 

__ 
11:':.' Part I ProteaingYour Machine 
Floppies, CDs, DVDs, and Memory Sticks 
As soon as you place a floppy disk, CD, or DVD in your system, the flies it 
contains become available to your system. However, the presence of an 
infected file alone isn't enough to do damage-it has to execute. There are 
three ways files on one of these media can execute: 
• It's possible for a virus to infect the boot sector of a CD, DVD, or 
floppy disk. The boot sector is the code that runs when you reboot or 
start your machine, and is responsible for loading the operating system. 
If it's infected, it can directly cause damage, or proceed to infect other 
flies on the system. So you should always use caution booting from a 
floppy disk, CD, or DVD. Only do so if you know the media is safe, or 
has already been scanned for viruses. Also, be very careful not to 
aCcidentally leave potentially infected floppies in your system, since 
many systems will boot from a floppy disk by default if one is in the 
drive when the computer starts. 
• CD and DVDs have the ability to run a program automatically when 
they are inserted. If the autorun program is infected, the CD or DVD 
can start infecting your system as soon as you insert it in the drive. 
1.1 RULE OF THUMB If you aren't sure a CD or DVD is clean (for 
example, if it was given to you by a friend who either isn't familiar with 
the dangers of viruses or isn't much of a friend), hold your keyboard Shift key 
down while inserting the CD or DVD into the drive, and keep it down until the 
CD has spun up. Holding the Shift key down disables the autorun feature. I Be 
sure you use a virus scanning program to scan the CD or DVD before accessing 
any of its files. 
• If you run an infected program on a CD or DVD, obviously it will be 
able to infect your system. 
Your Network 
There are three common ways for viruses to invade a computer across a net-
work. Here's a quick summary-you'll read more about each one later in this 
chapter: 
I In Appendix 8 you'll learn a technique fOr turning off autorun completely. 

Chapter 3 From Sneaks to Slammers: How Viruses Get on Your System .' .. 
" __ 
• Network shares: It's possible for your computer to "share" its disk drive 
so it can be accessed by other computers on a local network. If you do 
so, it's possible for another computer to access the flies on your hard 
drive. If that computer is infected by a virus, it can go ahead and infect 
the files on your computer directly across the network, through the 
shared drives.2 
• E-mail, 1M, peer-to-peer (P2P), or web pages: Many viruses travel as 
attachments across e-mail or file downloads through an instant mes-
saging service or P2P services such as Kazaa. Others appear as links on 
a web page. Be sure to scan any downloaded flies or attachments for 
viruses before you run them. It's also possible that flaws in your e-mail 
program or web browser will automatically run such attachments even 
if you don't do anything. Installing the latest security updates for your 
operating system can help prevent this. 
• Direct network connections: Every time you browse to a web site, your 
computer asks the web server computer to send it data. Look at it for 
a moment the other way-a web server computer spends all its time 
listening for requests from other computers. Well, it turns out that your 
computer may be listening for requests as well, not necessarily web 
requests, but other kinds of requests. For example, it might be listening 
for a request to share flies. You may not even know all the programs on 
your computer that are listening for different types of requests, and 
some of those programs may have bugs that would allow another com-
puter to access yours without your knowledge. This is especially the case 
if you haven't installed the latest updates for your system. 
By now you should be getting a good sense of the physical means that 
viruses use to invade your system. So allow me to tum the book over to my 
colleague, who has his own unique perspective on the situation. 
Dr. H, the Holistic Social Scientist, Says . .. 
I hope you enjoyed Dr. T's discussion, though I dare say that in her focus on 
technology she really misses the most important aspects of fighting viruses. 
So let me start by clearing a few things up. Now please don't get me wrong, 
and know that I really have no intention to cause you any distress, but 
understand ... 
If your computer gets infected by a virus, it's 
almost always going to be your fault. 
2 I'm not actually going to teach you how to share drives-it varies depending on the version of 
Windows you}-e using and can involve some pretty complex configuration. So you'll have to look in 
your Windows help for that information. I will however talk about what you need to do to secure 
shared drives if you choose to do so--that will be in Chapter 7.

Please, I don't mean to offend. But we're dealing with human nature here, 
and viruses mostly spread due to carelessness, laziness, curiosity, and igno-
rance, with a dose of good old-fashioned stupidity and greed thrown in for 
good measure. 
I know that most of you reading this are teenagers, but I expect there are a 
few parents here as well.3 But I want to address only the teens for a moment. 
First, let me assure you of one thing--don't think for an instant that my 
comments have anything to do with you being teenagers. I assure you that 
your parents and other adults have plenty of carelessness, laziness, and igno-
rance to go around. In fact, between you and me, it's my hope and expectation 
that by the time you're done with this book you'll know more about virus pro-
tection than they do, and will be able to get them out of jams when they get 
into them. 
OK parents, you can pay attention again. 
Dr. T divided the ways viruses spread into physical media and network 
transfer-which makes sense considering her more technological viewpoint. 
But you need to understand that the way viruses spread really divides into two 
completely different categories: 
• Viruses that trick your computer into running them: These are attacks 
that rely on bugs in your system, errors in system configuration, or 
other software vulnerabilities. You don't have to actually run an 
infected program for these infections to occur-simply broWSing to a 
web site, opening an e-mail message, or even connecting to the 
Internet can be enough for these attacks to succeed. Keeping your 
system software up to date and using a virus scanner and firewall will 
be your best defenses against this type of attack. 4 
• Viruses that trick you into running them: These are attacks that rely on 
convincing you to run a program that will infect your computer. While 
a virus scanner will help here, staying vigilant and using common sense 
are by far your best defenses for this kind of attack. 
In the next few chapters, you'llieam all about the various defenses against 
viruses. But I must stress this: Your biggest enemy is yourself, your own com-
placency, and laziness. Many of the people who read this book will still run 
into problems, not because of a problem with the book but simply because 
they don't get around to follOwing the recommendations, or follow them for a 
little while and then forget.

infinitely slTlorter than the lTIany adults who would rather relTlain in vulnerable ignorance than read a 
book with "Teen" in the title.

Keeping your computer secure requires attention. You have to think about 
the HIes you download and run not just now, but all the time. You need to 
update your virus scanning software and operating system not just now, but 
frequently. Even daily.5 
I hate to say it, but your greatest vulnerability is yourself. 
Now, I don't want to leave you on such a sad note. I know security is a 
rather depressing subject-all about people trying to attack your computer 
and invade your privacy. Before I tum the book back to your nonfictional 
author, please let me assure you that security is a really easy habit to get into, 
and once you've set things up it becomes mostly an automatic process. And 
believe me, the time you spend on it will be nothing compared to the time and 
hassle of cleaning or repairing an infected system. 
HowViruses Spread 
I hope you enjoyed our two fictional guest authors. In the rest of the chapter 
I'll go into more detail on the various ways that viruses spread, incorporating 
both Dr. T's and Dr. H's approaches. 
Physical Media 
You've already read about some of the issues relating to physical media: 
floppies, CDs, and DVDs. You know not to boot from infected media, or allow 
an infected CD or DVD to automatically start, and not to run programs with-
out checking them first. 
But Dr. T's deSCription skipped a step. How do viruses get on the media in 
the first place? 
Here's where floppies and CDs differ. Because a floppy disk is easily 
writable, just inserting a floppy disk on an infected system is enough for it to 
become infected in tum. But at least to date, viruses don't write themselves to 
CDs. So CDs are most often infected unintentionally, when someone copies 
infected HIes to it when burning a CD. 
Commercial CDs are generally safe--companies check them for viruses 
before they ship. So the real risk is in media given to you by friends. Before 
putting them in your machine, you need to ask yourself these questions: 
• Do I trust my friend's machine? Was it clean of viruses when the CD 
was burned? 
• Do I trust my friend? Not that any of you would have friends who 
would intentionally infect a CD they gave you ...

By the way, that burned music CD you were just given? It may have 
programs on it as well (yep, CDs can contain both software and music), so be 
careful with those, too. 
E-Mail and Sparn 
One of the most common ways for viruses to spread is through e-mail or 
spam.6 It works something like this: 
I. You open an infected e-mail attachment. 
2. The virus looks on your system for other e-mail addresses, preferably 
those from your own address book. 
3. The virus sends out e-mails containing an infected attachment to every 
e-mail address it can find. 
4. The virus does whatever other harmful or annoying act it was designed 
to do on your system. 
And thus the virus spreads. 
Some attachments are more dangerous than others. The most dangerous 
types are executable HIes. You can tell which these are by their filename 
extension. Table 3-1 shows some of the common ones.

The spread of e-mail-based viruses depends first and foremost on the first 
step-an attachment containing the virus somehow has to run on your system. 
There are two ways that an e-mail attachment can be opened on a system: 
I. It can convince you to open the attachment. 
2. It can trick the e-mail program into opening and running the 
attachment. This is most common when running obsolete versions of 
Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express. For example, some viruses hide 
the damaging code in a me with the .jpg extension, indicating a graphic 
me. But the headers in the e-mail message indicate that it's an 
executable, so when an obsolete e-mail reader opens the image to 
display it, instead of displaying the image it executes the application, 
thus installing the virus. 
You'll learn more about protecting yourself from the second type of attack 
in Chapter 6. For now, let's talk about the ways e-mail will by to trick you into 
opening an infected attachment. 
Masters of Disguise 
E-mail is based on a protocol called SMTP-SimpleMail Transfer Protocol. 
This protocol consists of the rules that an e-mail program uses to send e-mail 
from one computer to another. SMTP was created during the earliest days of 
the Internet, a time that most will agree was much more trusting and open 
than today's Internet. 7 
7 Today's Internet grew out of the original DARPA-Net-built by the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency. on agency that does research for the Deportment of Defense. DARPA-Net was origi-
nally limited to government agendes and major universities, with little or no commerdal application. 
so it's easy to see why things have changed. 

__ ... 1.1 Part I Protecting Your Machine 
With SMTP, an e-mail message can claim to be from whomever it wants. 
If you're using a web-based e-mail program, such as Hotmail or MSN, 
an e-mail you send is always marked as coming from your e-mail address. 
But if you're using a POP3 account (an account based on a protocol called 
Post Office Protocol 3) through an e-mail program such as Outlook, Outlook 
Express, Eudora, or Netscape, you can label the e-mail as coming from anyone 
you wish. 
Figure 3-1 shows an example from Outlook Express.

Cencel 
Figure 3·1 A POP3 client relies on the user to specify a correct e-mail address. 
Some SMTP programs will do verification on the sending address to make 
sure it's legitimate, but there is little they can do to verify that you are who you 
say you are. So if you put in a valid domain name,8 the e-mail you send with 
such a client will probably go through. 
Well, if you can do it, a virus can as well. So when you get an e-mail that 
claims to be from a friend of yours, it may not be from your friend's computer. 
It's very possible that the virus lifted your friend's address on a completely 
different computer, and mailed you from that computer claiming to be from 
your friend. 
B The domain name is the part afler the @ sign in an e-mail address. For example, in 
someone@microso(l.com, microso(l.com is the domain name. 

Chapter 3 From Sneaks to Slammers: How Viruses Get on Your System

E-mail spam Hlters are usually configured to let in mail from people on 
your own address book, so you can't rely on them for protection. 
So, if you get an e-mail from your friend Tom that looks something like 
this: 
From: Tom 
Subject: Here's a great program that I think you'll like 
It's possible that your friend Tom really found a program that you'll like. 
But it's just as likely that a virus is trying to use Tom's name to trick you into 
opening an attachment. 
False Virus Warnings 
This particular fraud may also result in your getting warnings from other systems 
that your computer is infected. Figure 3-2 illustrates how this might work.

2. Tom gets infected by a virus that sends out messages claiming to be 
from you (it's filled in your e-mail address in the "From" address field 
in the e-mail message). One of those messages goes to his friend Jill. 
3. Jill's e-mail seIVer has antivirus protection and detects the virus. The 
seIVer then sends a message warning the sender that he sent out an 
e-mail containing a virus. But the seIVer thinks the message came 
from you. 
4. You get a message from Jill's seIVer warning that you sent out a virus. 
This leaves you vel)' confused, because your machine is clean (you 
should run a virus scan to make sure), and you never sent anything to Jill.

flJ.1 Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Masters of Temptation 
Viruses choose subjects that are designed to tempt you into opening the 
message. 
• Polite messages: Thanking you for something, but you have to open the 
message to find out what. 
• Friendly messages: Seeming to come from a friend, telling you that 
they love you. 
• Tempting messages: From free computers, to vacations, to software, to 
offers for just about every obscene act you can imagine. All you need to 
do is click here ... 
• Fake confirmation messages: Seeming to respond to requests you 
made, confirming new account information or an order or reservation. 
• Warning messages: We'll cancel your account! We think your 
information has been compromised! You're doomed if you don't follow 
these instructions ... 
• Curious messages: Containing various phrases designed to provoke 
your curiosity, like "someone has a crush on you." 
Greed. Curiosity. Fear. Temptation. 
None of us are completely immune, and virus authors (like spammers) are 
infinitely creative in the approaches they take. 
I wish I could offer a sure guarantee on how to deal with these. A spam fil-
ter will help, but none of them are perfect yet. And sooner or later you'll open 
one of those messages. 
In most cases, as long as you don't open the attachment, you'll still be safe. 
But in some cases your computer can be infected even if you don't open the 
attachment. You already know that older e-mail clients have bugs that allow 
them to be tricked into automatically opening an attachment when you view 
a message. Also, an HTML-based message (which you'll read about shortly) 
might infect your system by way of an HTML viewer. 
Masters of Gullibility 
This actually isn't a virus at all-it's an e-mail scam that convinces you to wreck 
your own system! 
BaSically you get an e-mail from someone you know telling you about a 
new virus that antivirus programs can't catch. Your friend tells you to first for-
ward the warning to all your friends, and then to search for and delete a file on 
your system in order to protect yourself.9 
9 My dad got tricked by this once. 

Chapter 3 From Sneaks to Slammers: How Viruses Get on Your System ... 
Since this message has come in from a trusted friend, you naturally do as 
instructed. 
Well, guess what, you just deleted an important system flie.10 And you just 
spread the message to your friends who will perhaps trust you. In other 
words-you're the virus! 
When you get a message warning you about a virus and instructing you on 
how to deal with it, even if it is from someone you trust completely, check it 
out first with one of the antivirus software vendors. Chances are good that it's 
just a scam. 
HTML E-Mail 
Most e-mail programs now allow you to send e-mail text that includes HTML, 
not just text. That allows you to include images, fonts and text styles, and so 
on. E-mail readers display the e-mail in a built-in web browser, and if that 
browser is vulnerable, the very act of viewing e-mail can run a script, install a 
plug-in, or redirect you to a page that might infect your system. You'll read 
more about browser-based vulnerabilities shortly. 
Downloaded Files 
E-mail attachments are only one way infected software can get on your sys-
tem. One of the most common ways is completely under your control-the 
flies you choose to download. 
People download flies from a number of different sources: the Web, FTP 
sites, Usenet (Internet news) sites, P2P networks such as Kazaa, Grokster, 
Napster, Morpheus, Gnutella, etc. 
Shareware and software downloads from reputable sites (such as 
CNET.com) and software you purchase for immediate download from rep-
utable companies are generally safe. These sites tend to be very careful about 
checking out software before they allow it on their site. However, you should 
still take nothing for granted, and make sure you have your own virus scanning 
active as a backup. 
Sites that are dependent on individual submissions, including newsgroups 
and P2P sites, are conSiderably more risky. File deSCriptions and names are 
often deSigned to trick you into installing and running the software. Be espe-
cially careful of game hacks and mods, and pirated software. Remember-the 
virus authors are out to tempt you with the flies you want most. 
I 
~ 
I RULE OF THUMB Never download a file that has been posted 
recently. Always wait until it has been up for at least a couple of weeks. 
Then be sure you've updated your antivirus software before downloading the 
file. This reduces the risk of your catching a new virus that isn't yet caught by 
your antivirus software. 
10 Any file located in your Windows or WinNT directory or any of Its subdirectories has a good chance 
of being an important system file.

Watch the Source 
One factor you may want to consider when downloading mes or browsing web 
sites is where that site is located. Different countries have different laws and 
levels of enforcement when it comes to dealing with viruses and software 
piracy. 
There are two ways to possibly determine where a web site is located. The 
first is by the domain extension, the other is by the Whois database. The web 
site http://www • iana. com can help you determine both. 
While .com can be from anywhere, different countries have two-letter 
extensions they can allocate as well. If you go to http://www.iana.com. you'll 
find a link to the lANA ccTLD database. This links the two-letter code for 
every country. Examples of codes include 
.cn 
China 
.de 
Germany 
.ph 
Philippines 
.ru 
Russia 
.kr 
Korea 
.jp 
Japan 
While viruses and spyware come from many different countries (including 
the US), these countries seem to have more than their fair share of question-
able sites. Watch out for Germany especially for spyware, the others for 
viruses. 
The Whois database can also help determine where a web site is regis-
tered. From http://www.iana.com. choose the link to the lANA Whois service. 
Other Whois services can be found at http://www.internic.net/whois • html 
and http://www.networksolutions.com (click the WHOIS menu at the top for 
this page). 
These can help you track down who owns a domain in some cases, but they 
are quite useless against domains that host spammers, pirated software, and 
viruses. That's because while you're supposed to provide accurate registration 
information, registrars don't actually do any investigating to make sure the 
records are accurate or useful-all they care about is that the owner of the 
domain has paid for their registration. 
Your Local Network 
Many homes nowadays have local networks-where several machines are 
networked together using wires or a wireless connection. They are often 
configured to share drives and printers. 

Chapter 3 From Sneaks to Slammers: How Viruses Get on Your System 
'K~:IIO' __ 
You've already read that if you're sharing a drive, any system that connects 
to that drive sees it as if it is local to that computer. That means if the other 
computer is infected, it can in tum infect yours. 
There are some obvious precautions you can take to prevent this: 
• Disable drive sharing. Or at least make sure the drive shares require 
use of a password (more on this in Chapter 7). 
• Don't connect to drives you aren't using, and configure your system so 
it doesn't restore mapped connections when your machine starts Up.ll 
That can slow the spread of an infection if it occurs. 
• Make sure all the machines on your network are clean. Yes, I know that 
may mean spending time cleaning your parents' computer, or that of a 
favorite sibling, but it's far better to do that then have to clean up the 
mess afterwards. 
• In Chapter 5 you'll learn about software firewalls, which can also 
protect you on your local network. 
There are some less obvious precautions as well. 
If you have a wireless network, and have just installed it with the default 
settings, anybody with a wireless card can access your local network. This 
includes neighbors and people driving by.12 In fact, some people do that for 
fun-just drive through neighborhoods looking for open networks. If you're 
sharing drives without passwords, those people can easily browse your hard 
drives. Aside from the privacy issues, anyone with an infected laptop can 
spread a virus onto your systems.13 
In the next section, you'll learn about direct network attacks through the 
Internet. All of the attacks described there can occur within a local network as 
well.

Yes, few things are more annoying than telemarketers. Even if all they 
want is to talk to your parents, if you're the one who answers you need to first 
figure out they are telemarketers, decide if this is the one-in-a-million case 
where you actually need to call your parents, and decide the best way to insult 
them before you hang up. 
How do they get your phone number? 
Some of them go by various lists and phone directories. But some of them 
just use automatic dialers to dial every possible number in an area code.14 
Computers have an equivalent of phone numbers called IP addresses (IP 
stands for Internet Protocol). You can fmd the IP address for many web sites 
using the Ping command. Bring up a command window and type in ping 
followed by the URL of the web site. For example: 
F:\>ping www.google.com 
Pinging www.google.com [216.239.41.99] with 32 bytes of data: 
This shows that at least one of the computers at http://www • google. com has 
an IP address of 216.239.41.99. Each of the four numbers ranges from 0 to 
255 (though just as with phone numbers, not every number combination is 
valid). 
Your phone number is given to you by the phone company. An IP address 
is given to you by your Internet provider. With modem dial-up connections 
and many DSL and cable connections, your IP address changes every time 
you call in or at regular intervals. This is called a dynamic IP address. With 
some DSL connections and high-speed TI and T3 connections, your IP 
address is fixed. 
The phone line in your house might be shared with several devices: a 
regular phone, a fax, a modem, an alarm system, a TiVo, and an answering 
machine, for example. Each of these devices provides a service to you by using 
the phone line. Of course, in most cases only one of these devices can use the 
line at a time-they have to share them. 
Just as different devices can answer a phone line, different programs on a 
computer can answer an incoming request on its IP address. A program that 
listens for Internet requests is often called a seroice, and a computer that runs 
these services is often called a seroer. 
One big difference between devices on a phone line and services on a 
computer is that a computer can have lots of services sharing the same IP 
address-it does this by assigning each one a port number between 1 and 
65535. Here's another way oflooking at it: 
Imagine that each port is a different door onto your computer. Each door 
can have a service behind it listening for someone to "ring the doorbell." 
Doors that don't have a service listening are effectively locked. Doors that do 
have a service open the door when someone rings. As long as the visitor is 
I~ Telemarketers can still use this technique in the US. but must first check if the number is on the

friendly, there is no problem. But if your computer opens the door to someone 
who is unfriendly ... well, you get the point. 
Some of the services a computer might run include 
• A web server service: Allows other people to browse web sites you 
create on your computer 
• An e-mail service: Lets your computer handle e-mail accounts for 
multiple users on your machine 
• A database service: Stores various types of data 
• A printer and file-sharing service: Used by the computer to share 
drives and devices 
• A game service: Where you host games that can be played by others 
(Counterstrike is a classic example of a game where individuals host 
their own game servers.) 
• And a variety of system configuration and networking services 
In fact, your computer is capable of running many different network serv-
ices. Each one involves having your computer listen for requests on the 
machine's IP address. Each service listens on one or more different ports. 
For example, a computer that hosts a web site it called a web server. The 
web site itself consists of a program called a web server service-Microsoft's 
web server service is called Internet Information Server (IIS). The web service 
listens on the IP address of the computer at port 80 (port 80 is the standard 
for web servers). 
Most services are deSigned for businesses--often large corporations. Yet 
many of them can be and are installed even on home systems. And many of 
them pose risks to your systems. Here are a few examples: 
• If your computer is sharing drives and doesn't provide security using a 
password, any computer on the Internet can potentially access that 
drive, delete flles, place new flles, or read any information on the drive. 
• There's a service called Rerrwte Procedure Call (RPC) that allows a 
computer to perform instructions requested from a remote computer. 
This is very useful in a corporation, where you want centralized control 
over many computers, or corporate applications that run on multiple 
computers at once. It's less useful on your home machine, but no less 
vulnerable to certain kinds of worms that have learned how to use a 
bug in older versions of the RPC service program to take over 
machines.

• There are two ways to build your own web site. You might be building 
it on your ISP's computer, but you might also choose to experiment 
with building web sites on your own computer. Many tools that allow 
you to build web sites include having a web server running on your 
computer. In most cases the web server will be accessible from other 
computers as well as your own. 
IP Telemarketing 
Just as telemarketers will dial every possible number to try to sell you some-
thing, hackers and viruses will try every possible IP address to find a port that 
your computer is listening to.15 Then they will try to exploit any bugs in the 
service listening on that port to invade your computer. One common bug 
they'll exploit is called a buffer overrun error. 
When a computer connects to your computer, it sends a request in the 
form of data. This data gets loaded into a buffer (a block of memory that holds 
data) on your computer to be examined and processed as shown in Figure 3-3. 
I Request 
Other Data or Program Code 
Buffer -----.~ 
Figure 3-3 A properly working service examines the contents of the buffer and 
performs the requested operation. 
Many attacks work by trying to send more data than the computer's buffer 
can hold. In this case, you might end up with a situation such as that shown in 
Figure 3-4. 
I I R'q"" , Vi,,' Cod, 
_ .... ~f---------- Buffer 
Figure 3-4 A buggy service doesn't check the size of the request before loading it into 
a memory buffer. 
As you can see, in this example the request has not only filled the buffer, 
but also overwritten another block of memory-one that perhaps contains 
other data or program code. If the hacker is very, very clever, they can over-
write data in such a way that the service will execute code that was included in 
the request. In effect, this attack tricks your computer into running any code 
they prOvide. 
IS You can a/so think of this as people knocking on every door in a neighborhood to see if anyone is 
home.

There are three ways to defend yourself from all types of Internet attacks: 
• Use a firewall to block outside requests. You'll learn more about this in 
Chapter 5. 
• Keep your operating system up to date. Many security patches address 
exactly this kind of problem. Chapter 6 covers this topiC. 
• Tum off services you don't need. You'll learn more about this in 
Chapter 7. 
Internet attacks are among the most dangerous, because they come 
entirely from outside-not due to some action on your part. However, you can 
take effective action to block them. 
The Web 
Chances are that you spend quite a bit of time browsing the World Wide Web. 
One way viruses can arrive on your system from the Web is pretty obvious-if 
you click a link that downloads a virus flle, and then run or open the file, it's 
found a new home. The kinds of flles that are dangerous are exactly the same 
as those discussed earlier when we covered e-mail attachments. 
But there are other risks to browsing the Web. Before telling you about 
them, it's important that you know a little bit about how the Web works. You 
can skip over this part if you're already familiar with HTML and JavaScript. 
How the World Wide Web Works 
When you browse to a web site, what actually happens is that your computer 
requests the web server computer to send you a page of information. 
Remember the part about computers running services that listen for requests? 
Computers running web servers traditionally listen on port 80. 
What's in that page of information returned from a web server? 
Most of the time it consists entirely of text in a language called Hypertext 
Markup Language (HTML). HTML looks something like this: 
<html> 
<body> 
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="]">HTML</font></b> 
<i><font size="5">makes this look 
<font color="#OOOOFF"><b><u>cool</u></b></font>!</font></i></font></p> 
</body> 
</html> 
Your browser reads the HTML and uses it to determine what to display. 
This HTML will appear in your browser something like the image shown in 
Figure 3-5. 

•• 
!lI.' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
TM L makes this look cool! 
Figure 3-5 HTML generates nice-looking pages. 
HTML can include links to images-instructions to your computer to con-
tact that web site or another to retrieve an image. It can include instructions to 
display a form-the list boxes, text boxes, and buttons that allow you to send 
information to a web site. It can also include a program in a language called 
JavaScript-which includes additional instructions on how to display or work 
with the web page. Menus and pop-up windows are typically implemented 
using JavaScript. JavaScript programs are deSigned to be limited in what they 
can do-typically the worst harm they can do is to bring up endless pop-up 
windows that are difficult to get rid Of.I6 However, if you're using an older 
browser, it's possible that JavaScript alone can be used to bring in a virus from 
another site and install it on your computer. 
ActiveX Controls and Plug-Ins 
HTML can also include requests to run more sophisticated programs called 
plug-ins or ActiveX controls .17 For example, a page that uses Flash actually 
runs a Flash plug-in to give you pages with animations, graphical effects, and 
other features that aren't possible with HTML alone. 
When you run an HTML page that requires a plug-in, and the plug-in isn't 
yet installed, you'll be prompted on what needs to be done to display that 
page. In some cases you'll be directed to a page where you can install the plug-
in. For example, to display a QuickTime movie fIle, you'll likely be directed to 
Apple's web site where you can download and install the QuickTime plug-in 
and movie player. 
The major plug-ins like QuickTime and Flash are both common and rea-
sonably safe. But many pages use other ActiveX controls, and those raise other 
issues. You see, an ActiveX control is a program, and like any other program, 
it can do anything it wants once it's on your system. So it's important that you 
trust the control and the people who create it. 
The default security setting for Microsoft's Internet Explorer causes the 
browser to look inside the ActiveX control for a piece of data called an 
Authenticode Signature-this is a digital signature that tells you who created 
the control. If the signature is missing, the control isn't loaded. If there, you're 
prompted whether or not to load and run the control. Figure 3-6 shows an 
example of such a prompt. 
16 You can get pop-up blockers. These are utilities that modift your browser to control or prevent pop-
ups (rom appearing. One o(the most popular is Google's. See http://toolbar . google. com. 
17 A -plug-In is a piece of software that runs on your computer that adds features to your web 
browser.

Figure 3·6 A typical ActiveX installation page 
You may have already seen this one. This is adware and, coming from a 
reputable company, does tell you exactly what it does. Your first thought might 
be to click the Yes button, but before doing so you might want to read exactly 
what it is you're agreeing to when you allow that control to be installed. 
The complete agreement is about 20 pages long. 
In a nutshell, when you install this control, you're allowing the control ven-
dor to install software on your machine that is, in effect, a kind of spyware. You 
grant it permission to watch you as you browse the web, record the sites you 
visit, and how long you spend there. This information is sent to Gator's servers, 
where they can send you advertisements based on this information. For exam-
ple, if you browse a bookstore for a particular book, they could bring up a dis-
count offer from a different bookstore. You're also giving them permission to 
look on your system to see what software you have installed so they can send 
you offers based on that information. 
You're making some other interesting promises as well: Their current 
agreement requires you to prOvide a copy of their privacy agreement to any-
one else using your computer to browse the web and obtain consent before 
they can use it (unless you have the legal right to accept the agreement on 
their behalf). You also agree not to use any unauthorized method to block 
display of their ads-I would interpret that to include any utilities or adware 
removal tools that they don't approve of. 

•• 
!Il". Part I Protecting Your Machine 
They do promise not to collect any personally identifiable information 
that would let them track who you are, so while it does qualify as spyware, it 
probably doesn't qualify as malicious. And who knows, you might appreciate 
the seIVices they provide. The important thing is that you take the time to 
understand what is being installed on your system before you install it. 
I 
~ I 
RULE OF THUMB When prompted to install an ActiveX control, 
~ 
answer "No" to the install prompt unless it's part of software that you're 
trying to install (such as a media plug-in or virus scanner). 
You should never click the check box that says "Always trust 
content from the ... corporation:' 
One of the greatest failings of Microsoft's Internet Explorer is that it lacks 
a check box that allows you to specify that you never want to trust content 
from a particular corporation. Hopefully they will add this feature. 
Another way to avoid ActiveX controls completely is to use a different 
browser like N etscape, Mozilla, or Opera that doesn't support ActiveX 
controls. See http://www.netscape • com, http://www • mozilla. org, and 
http://www • opera. com for information on these browsers. 
Are We ParanoidYet? 
At this point you may be ready to just shut off your computer, stick it in a 
closet, and go watch TV 
Just kidding. 
Seriously though, you've just spent the past three chapters learning about 
the kinds of things viruses can do, the different types of viruses, and how they 
actually make their way onto your system. 
You may be a bit frustrated that I haven't really told you much about how 
to deal with these problems yet. For that I apologize, but I have good reason. 
You see, it's not enough (or even possible) to give you instructions on how 
to deal with every possible threat that exists today. There are just too many 
threats, and too many possible computer and network configurations to pro-
vide a simple formula. Not only that, but the threats constantly evolve. What 
you've read so far gives you the foundation that will allow you to figure out 
how to apply the advice that follows to your particular situation. It gives you 
knowledge that will help you understand and adapt to future threats as well as 
those that exist at the time the book is printed. 
The next six chapters are all about defense. You're going to learn about the 
three foundations of protecting your computer: antivirus tools, firewalls, and 
system updates. You'll learn each one's strengths-and weaknesses. And you'll 
learn what to do when your computer is the victim.

The Built-In Doctor: 
Antivirus Programs 
Let's get right to the point. 
Your computer should have an antivirus program installed that 
includes active scanning and automatic updates. 
That is the single most important thing you need to know. If you don't have 
an up-to-date antivirus program installed, you should stop reading and get one 
now. l That's the main point of this chapter; all that follows is commentary. 
How Antivirus Programs Work 
An antivirus program generally does three things. First, it tries to validate 
itself. That means it tries to make sure that the antivirus program itself isn't 
infected with a virus. And it scans your computer's memory for viruses that 
might currently be running. This is important given that the first thing a 
number of viruses try to do is disable any operating antivirus programs! 
Antivirus programs aren't always successful at protecting themselves-there's 
a constant race between the virus authors and the antivirus authors. 
I 
~ I RULE OF THUMB If you are infected with a virus, scan your system 
~ 
twice. Even if your antivirus program reports that it has cleaned up any 
viruses, it's possible that it missed one executing in memory or its own infection, 
so viruses will still appear on a second scan. Chapter 9 discusses how to deal 
with more stubborn infections that aren't gone after two scans.

I OK, you can keep reading, but only because later in this chapter I offer advice on how to choose an 
antivirus program.

•• 
Iil:.. Port I Protecting Your Machine 
The following is a summary of how to use a typical antivirus program. 
However, if you actually have an infection, I strongly recommend you read 
Chapter 9 before starting the cleanup process. It goes into much greater detail 
on how to deal with viruses while minimizing the chance of scrambling your 
system software. 
File Scanning 
Every antivirus program has the ability to scan your system drives for viruses. 
The way it works is simple in principle. The antivirus program includes a set 
of virus definitions-patterns of known viruses. The program reads every file 
in your system and looks for those virus patterns in the file. If it finds one, it 
considers the file to be a virus and reports it as such. 
Some antivirus programs will give you some choices as to what files to 
scan. Figure 4-1 shows an example of an antivirus control screen, this one 
from McAfee Virus Scan.

Scanning Options 
Let's take a closer look at some of these options . 
• Scan subfolders: Antivirus programs are capable of scanning your 
entire system or individual files or directories. Leaving this box 
checked does no harm when scanning an individual file. The only time 
you might clear it is if you're checking the files in a directory and know 
for a fact that all files in the subdirectory are clean. In other words, you 
should almost always leave this checked. 

Chapter 4 The Built-In Doctor:Antivirus Programs ,_t __ 
• Scan all files: Antivirus programs give you the option of scanning evel)' 
HIe on your system, or only files with extensions that indicate they are 
programs (these are the same HIe extensions that you read about in the 
discussion of e-mail attachments in Chapter 3-for example, .exe, .bat, 
and .pil) The first time you scan a system, you should scan all HIes just 
to be safe. However, for routine scans it's OK to scan programs only in 
order to save time. 
• Scan within compressed files: Compressed HIes are HIes like ZIP files 
that contain other files. Many antivirus programs can scan for HIes 
within compressed HIes; however, this also can be vel)' time 
consuming. As with the "Scan all HIes" option, you should always scan 
within compressed HIes on your first scan of a system. You should use 
this option for any HIes you've downloaded or received via e-mail (even 
if you received them from a trusted friend). 
• Scan for unknown viruses: It's not uncommon for virus authors to 
create new viruses by slightly modifying other viruses. Thus a new virus 
might share many of the characteristics of existing viruses. This option 
tells the antivirus program to search for these characteristic patterns. 
In some cases this allows the software to spot brand new viruses. You 
should always leave this on, even though it will slow the scanning 
process. 
• Scan potentially unwanted applications: This option scans for spyware 
and adware applications. This one is a bit trickier because you're vel)' 
dependent on the judgment of the company that developed your 
antivirus software to decide which applications are adware and which 
aren't. Remember: While you'll never want a virus running on your 
system, there are cases where you'll have installed adware intentionally. 
Unlike viruses, the creation and spread of which are generally illegal, 
adware and some spyware is legal. Also, as you read in Chapter 3, when 
you install some adware, you're explicitly agreeing not to use other 
programs such as antivirus programs to remove it or interfere with it.2 
So, whether to leave this box checked or not is entirely up to you. 
Virus Cleanup 
Some antivirus programs (especially the free ones) stop once they've found 
and reported viruses. It's then up to you to go to the web site for your antivirus 
2 Yes. I know you never aaually read the license agreement. But you did agree to it during the installo-
tion. And while I personally have no objealon to you breaking this agreement and taking the risk that 
they'll corne atter you with leeions of lawyers. my own bias is to never install those kinds of applica-
tions In the first place.

'y,;u.. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
program and find cleaning instructions for that particular virus. Cleaning a 
virus by hand can be a challenging task, and usually includes both deleting 
files and deleting registry entries-not something one does casually. 
Full-featured antivirus programs will do this for you. The antivirus program 
will try to identify the particular virus based on the virus pattern found in the 
file. If it's a true virus (infected file), it will try to remove the virus and restore 
the file to its original state. If it's a worm, the antivirus program will try to delete 
the worm. Depending on the program and virus, it may ask you what you want 
to do with each file, and ask for your confirmation before deleting a file. In most 
cases you should OK the deletion, the exception being files that may have side 
effects, as you'll read shortly. 
Deleting Infected Files 
In some cases it won't be possible for the antivirus program to delete the file 
or remove the worm. In that case you should either go to the antivirus pro-
gram's web site for more speCific instructions, or delete the file manually. In 
many cases it will be possible to delete the file after restarting the system. The 
way it works is this: 
Some files can't be deleted while their program is running. So an antivirus 
program might spot the file as a virus, but be unable to delete it. However, 
the antivirus program should be able to remove the registry entries or startup 
settings that started the virus in the first place. So when you restart your 
machine, the virus or worm won't be running, and thus it should be possible 
to delete the file. The big exception is when files that are part of the operating 
system are infected-those can be impossible to delete. Chapter 9 will discuss 
in more detail how to handle this situation. 
Some antivirus programs will offer you the option of" quarantining" a 
file-putting it in a directory where it's presumably safe. You can do this if you 
think you'll have a need to look at the file (perhaps it contains data that you 
want to rescue )-but in most cases quarantining an infected file is just a waste 
of disk space. 
Side Effects of Deleting Infected Files 
Sometimes an infected file simply can't be cleaned and must be deleted. 
Unfortunately, it may be a critical system file, or a file that one of your pro-
grams requires to run. That's why many antivirus programs ask you to confirm 
if you want to delete the file. The only time you might want to say no is if the 
infected file is a critical system file that your system needs to run-in which 
case you might allow it to stay as you try other cleanup approaches. However, 
ultimately you must clean or delete every infected file. 
In these cases you may need to reinstall the original program or reinstall 
your operating system. 
All Windows operating systems include a reinstall or repair option 
(depending on operating system). With Windows 9x and ME you can simply 
install Windows over the current installation-your current settings should be 

Chapter 4 The Built-In Doctor:Antivirus Programs .11' •• 
maintained. This may repair and restore missing HIes, but isn't guaranteed to 
do so. With Windows 20001XP, a repair option is available when you reinstall 
the operating system. This does a pretty good job of restoring missing HIes. 
Remember to perform a system update (described in Chapter 6) after doing a 
system repair. 
In cases of extremely serious infections, you may have no choice but to do 
a full system restore--either restoring from the CDs provided when you 
bought your system, or doing a complete hard drive format and operating sys-
tem installation if yours is a custom system or doesn't have system restore 
discs. 
Chapter 9 will go into more detail of what kinds of problems can occur 
while cleaning an infected system, and how to minimize the damage and loss 
that can occur. 
Active Scanning 
The better antivirus programs include ongoing virus scanning or "active" scan-
ning. With this feature on, the virus scanning program constantly monitors the 
system and automatically scans every file that is created, modified, or opened. 
This provides ongoing protection, and largely eliminates the need to routinely 
scan your entire system. 
I strongly recommend that you use an antivirus program that offers this 
feature. 
There are, however, some situations where you'll want to temporarily 
disable this feature: 
• When doing video editing 
• When doing image editing oflarger images 
• When accessing remote drives through a virtual private network (VPN) 
that aren't on your local area network 
Scanning HIes can be time consuming, especially with larger HIes. In the 
case of video editing, the ongoing scanning can severely impact the perform-
ance of your video editing software. The same applies to image editing of large 
pictures. 
In the case of remote access to another computer3 through a relatively 
slow connection (and even a cable or DSL line is slow compared to a local area 
network), the antivirus program can double the time it takes to do file trans-
fers because it may be trying to scan files on the remote system. 
Your best bet is to leave the antivirus software on unless you notice a per-
formance impact. If you do, tum it off. Just remember to tum it back on when 
you're finished with the task at hand. 
3 Most home userS will never do this. but a few of you may have a virtual private network set up to 
work or school that allows you to access a remote computer as if it were on your local network.

O·PII Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Where Antivirus Programs Fail 
Antivirus vendors are quick to promise safety with their programs, but sad to 
say there are places where even the best antivirus programs fail. 
Viral Leapfrog 
Each of the major antivirus software vendors maintains a team whose job it is 
to spot new viruses and update their antivirus software to protect against it. 
The lifespan of every virus goes something like this: 
• Somewhere in the world, someone writes a virus or worm. 
• The virus spreads unimpeded, as existing antivirus programs don't 
defend against it. 
• Antivirus software vendors find out about the virus either through 
infection of their own machines, or samples sent by customers. 
• Antivirus software vendors mod.ifY their programs, and make updates 
available that detect the virus and remove infections. 
• Customers download the updates, reducing the number of vulnerable 
machines. 
• The number of infections drops, and the spread of the virus slows. 
Curiously, this is another place where technology mimics reality, because 
the spread of a mutated virus like those that cause a cold or flu follows a 
similar pattern. The virus spreads, doctors recognize it and try to isolate it, 
immunity spreads among those who survive the infection, and the spread of 
the virus slows. 
But it rarely stops. That's an important point-even in nature it's very hard 
to completely eradicate a disease. With computer viruses there are almost 
always some vulnerable machines remaining, allowing the virus to continue to 
exist in some places. 
The Unavoidable Failure of Antivirus Programs 
This life cycle also illustrates one place where every antivirus program fails. 
Between the time a virus is created and the time an antivirus program is 
updated, there is a window of vulnerability in which a virus can infect your 
system. 
Thus even if you have an updated antivirus program on your system, it's 
essential that you follow the precautions you've already learned-not to open 
e-mail attachments you're unsure of-and follow other precautions you'llieam 
about in the next two chapters: Maintain an effective firewall, and keep your 
system up to date. 

Chapter 4 The Built-In Doctor:Antivirus Progroms __ 
This window of vulnerability also means that you should never download a 
HIe from a news group or other HIe site until it has been available for at least a 
couple of weeks. That hot new HIe might be just a bit too hot-and contain a 
virus that your antivirus program hasn't yet been updated to handle. 
The window of vulnerability is a technological reason why antivirus pro-
grams can fail. But as Dr. Holistic might say-most of the reasons antivirus 
programs fail are due to human error and human nature, not technology. 
Update? What Update? 
Most new computers from major companies ship with antivirus software 
installed. In some cases they include a subSCription for updates for the first six 
months or a year. 
But you won't believe how many times I've had a conversation like this: 
Me: So, does your computer have antivirus software installed? 
Friend: Yep, it came with it. 
Me: Do you know if it's downloading updates? 
Friend· Uh, I don't know. 
Me: Did you renew the subSCription for updates when it expired? 
Friend: No, I'll probably get around to it sometime. 
Or maybe ... 
Friend: I'm still getting updates to the program, but it wants me to pay for 
updates to the virus definition HIe, so I'm not getting those. 
Folks, the level of protection these people are getting is virtually useless. 
You now know about the life cycle of a virus-you know that a virus 
spreads fastest when it's new. If even up-to-date antivirus software doesn't give 
you perfect protection, imagine how bad old virus software is! Failing to 
update for even one or two months is enough to make you vulnerable to the 
worst new viruses. 
And so it is that once again, most people are vulnerable not due to techno-
logical failures, but because of human nature. They forget or don't bother to 
update the subSCription on their antivirus software. They don't check for 
updates (though nowadays most antivirus software checks for updates auto-
maticallyas long as the subSCription is active). 
Other Human Failures 
Not bothering to update your antivirus software is just the main human failure 
that helps viruses spread. There are others. 

.E-GI' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Trust 
Your best friend sends you a really cool new application to by out. Naturally 
you trust him. But what does that really mean? 
• You trust him not to intentionally infect you with a virus. 
• You trust him to lrnow enough about computer security to lrnow if the 
fIle he's sending is a potential virus. 
• You have to trust that his idea of a practical joke doesn't include a virus. 
• You trust him to have a clean system. 
• You trust him to have the same approach towards spyware and adware 
as you, or at least warn you if the software has spyware or adware. 
That's an awful lot of trust. 
Now I'm a firm believer in trusting my friends, coworkers, and associates. 
But I nevertheless scan everything I'm sent. 
And as for fIles sent by strangers, they get deleted right away. Which brings 
me to the next issue. 
Curiosity 
In Chapter 3 you learned about all the tricks that viruses use to convince you 
to open e-mail attachments. One of the things they appeal to most is your 
curiosity. This applies to any HIe you receive, whether bye-mail or one you 
download yourself. All it takes is for the fIlename or deSCription to spark your 
curiosity enough to double-click the fIle-and you've opened the door to 
trouble. 
By the way, I do want to emphasize that though this book is directed at 
teens, adults are equally susceptible to trust and curiosity issues. I recently 
talked to an executive at a computer company, one with years of experience, 
who sheepishly described how he found an executable fIle on his system and, 
just out of curiosity opened it. Nothing happened. Then over the next few days 
parts of his system stopped working. He couldn't figure out what the trouble 
was, and didn't suspect a virus because his antivirus software didn't report a 
problem. Well, a week later his antivirus software was updated and sure 
enough, it detected a major infection on his computer. His curiosity caused 
him to open a virus fIle during the window of vulnerability between the time 
the virus was created and the antivirus software was updated. 
Fraudulent Reports 
In Chapter 3, in the section on e-mail, you learned how some e-mail chain 
letters act as viruses in a way. They convince you to forward warnings to your 
friends instructing them to manually delete a fIle that supposedly is a virus that 

Chapter 4 The Built-In Doctor:Antivirus Programs .'11:0' __ 
can't be detected by antivirus programs. The me, it turns out, is one your 
system needs to run properly. 
I mention this type of e-mail again to stress one point. This kind of e-mail 
message is correct in one thing-it isn't stopped by antivirus programs. Only 
your good sense and a willingness to check up on stories before taking action 
or spreading them will protect you and your friends from this one. 
Anti-Antivirus Software 
One of the most dangerous types of viruses actually targets and disables your 
antivirus software. The danger here is that by disabling the antivirus software 
not only is the virus given free reign to do whatever it wants, it opens the door 
to further infection as well. 
Most antivirus software provides some indication that it at least thinks it's 
working-typically an icon in the system tray (by default at the lower-right 
side of your screen). Other antivirus software brings up a screen at startup 
indicating that it's protecting your computer. Keep your eyes open for changes 
in the behavior of your antivirus software. If the icon vanishes from the 
taskbar, or looks different, or if you stop seeing a notice on startup, you may 
have been infected by this type of virus. 
Otherwise, the techniques for aVOiding this type of virus are the same as 
any other virus. Your best bet is to keep it from being installed on your system 
in the first place using the techniques you've already learned (and those you'll 
learn as you read on).4 
Choosing Antivirus Software 
Antivirus software is one of those items for which more isn't necessarily better. 
In other words, you don't want to have more than one antivirus application 
running on your system at a given time. Not only is there a chance that they 
will interfere with each other (or detect another antivirus program as itself 
being a virus), but having more than one scanning in the background can sig-
nificantly slow your system down. 
In many cases you'll just use the antivirus software that comes with your 
system. As long as you keep your subSCription up to date, and either update 
frequently or allow it to automatically update itself, you should be perfectly 
fine with that choice. Chances are, if your computer came with antivirus 
software, it came with either N orton AntiVirus or McAfee VirusScan. 
4 The virus removal instructions in Chapter 9 offer further suggestions on how to remove this kind of 
virus.

These products are constantly evolving, and are often bundled with other 
products or features that aren't directly related to their antivirus features. So if 
you don't have a virus scanner and are trying to choose between them, see who 
has the best deal at the moment. Technically speaking, anything I tried to tell 
you about which one was "better" at a given task right now would without 
doubt be obsolete by the time you read this. But you won't go wrong with 
either choice. 
Just remember to remove any existing antivirus software (including any 
that came with your system) before installing new antivirus software.5 
What About Other Antivirus Programs? 
VVhen you do a search for antivirus software (use the keyword antivirus, not 
anti-virus), you'll see many results. I've focused on the Norton and McAfee 
products because they are the most popular and widely used. In theory, this 
means that both companies have the resources to commit to research-to 
keep their software up to date. They have a larger customer base to potentially 
report new viruses to them. 
But it doesn't mean they are necessarily the "best" antivirus software. 
Not only that, but with size comes other types of vulnerability. Authors of 
anti-antivirus software are more likely to create viruses that disable the prod-
ucts of these two companies than others. 
So, if you really feel like putting in research to find another antivirus 
program, go right ahead. My guess is most of you will stick with one of these 
products. Also, be sure to visit AlwaysUseProtection.com, where I'll be posting 
updated information including details on other antivirus programs. 
5 Running two antivirus programs at once will, of course, slow your system down. Worse--the two 
programs might each decide that the other is a virus, leading them into mortal combat. which can tie 
up all available computing power.

Online or Offline 
One of the interesting options provided by McAfee is that of a web service-
based antivirus tool. The differences between this and a regular packaged 
product are subtle. 
You can't buy the online version in a store-there is no retail packaged 
product. Instead, you purchase it online and create an account on the McAfee 
web site. The antivirus program is installed using an ActiveX control. You can 
reinstall it any time you want just by entering your user name and password on 
the McAfee site-you don't have to worry about lOSing a CD. 
You can also buy the packaged Virus Scan program or Norton's AntiVirus 
program via the Internet. But in that case, you download an installation pack-
age that is installed just as if you were installing it from a CD. 
The way you buy and install the product is the only real difference. Once 
on your system, they are comparable. The big advantages of the online-based 
antivirus tool is that it's always up to date. If you're restoring a system, you 
don't have to find the CD, and you don't have to install an older version and 
then download an update. The version you download will always be the latest. 
Its big disadvantage is that McAfee's web site currently has incredibly annoy-
ing pop-up ads that really go overboard trying to sell you their other products. 
The advantage of a packaged product is that it allows you to install anti-
virus software before you're connected to the Internet. In Chapter 6, you'll 
learn how to deal with the problem of updating a system after a system restore 
or when installing a new operating system.

• It's 2:00 a.m., you're at a friend's house, you accidentally opened a 
downloaded file, and now you're wondering if you may have infected 
your friend's computer. You need to do a virus scan fast, but you don't 
have one and the stores are closed. 
• You've argued with your parents, but they just won't buy you virus 
scanning software until you've cleaned your room. A quick look at your 
room suggests that the world may end before it's clean enough to 
satisfy them (or even allow someone to see the floor), so you need 
another option. 
• You have the money for virus scanning software, and get to your local 
computer shop, only to discover that 3D Realms has finally shipped 
"Duke Nukem Forever". Antivirus software or Duke Nukem? Your 
computer is well protected for the next few weeks because you're too 
busy playing to check your e-mail or download any files. But sooner or 
later, you have to return to the real world.

It's always best to have full-featured antivirus software installed and run-
ning on your system. But for those times when you need to do a virus scan 
quickly, both Norton and McAfee offer free online virus scanning. For 
McAfee, go to their home page at http://www . mcafee. com and look for the link 
to McAfee FreeScan. 
For Norton, go to their home page (http://www.symantec.com) and look for 
something called Symantec Security Check-at the time this book was printed 
it was in their Downloads section. 
Both of these free services use ActiveX controls-the kind I warned you 
about in Chapter 3. But in this case, when prompted as to whether or not to 
install the control, you should answer Yes. Figure 4-2 shows an example of an 
ActiveX control prompt for an online virus scanner-this one for Symantec's 
free security check.

Be sure to disable any existing antivirus software before running one of these 
scanners. 
As of the date this book was published, both free scanning programs are 
very similar. The big difference is that the McAfee one actually requires you to 
create an account on McAfee.com (using a valid e-mail address) before it 
allows you to download and install the scanner. 

Chapter 4 The Built-In Doctor:Antivirus Programs ~ 
These free scanners do a good job of helping you determine whether your 
computer has an active infection, but they typically lack many critical features 
of a full antivirus program. 
• They don't clean viruses from your system. 
• They may not scan inside compressed HIes. 
• They have little or no flexibility in terms of specifying what HIes to 
scan. 
• They don't provide ongoing protection. 
• They start with your C drive, which is a problem if your operating 
system is installed on another drive.6 
If they find a virus, they let you know of the fact and which virus they've 
found. You then have to remove the virus manually using one of the virus 
removal tools or instructions you'll find on their web sites. 
The free scanners are great tools when you have nothing better available, 
but I strongly recommend you invest in a full-featured program. 
S.pom Filters 
Spam HIters aren't really security products, and I had some doubts as to 
how much coverage to give them. But they are deserving of at least a brief 
mention. 
A spam filter is baSically a HItering program that tries to decide which 
e-mails you want to see and which you don't. Because many of the e-mails you 
don't want to see contain viruses or messages that try to trick you into 
divulging personal information, spam HIters do provide some additional 
protection. But because they aren't perfect (or even close), they should be 
thought of more as a convenience to help you handle e-mail than a real 
security tool. 
If you're using one of the major online services for e-mail-AOL, MSN, 
Earthlink, etc., or web mail such as Yahoo or Hotmail, you should check their 
e-mail documentation for configuring spam HItering options. They all have at 
least some spam HItering built in. If you're using a POP3 account (using 
Outlook, Outlook Express, or other e-mail client program), you can find a 
wide variety of spam HIterlng products. 
Some of the most popular are iHateSpam (http://www.sunbelt-
software.com), McAfee SpamKiller (http://www.mcafee.com). and the free 
open source SpamBayes (http://spambayes.sourceforge • net). 
You can also find antispam software that does virus checking on e-mail as 
well; however, your standard antivirus program should do this for you anyway . 
.. It's possible to hove more thon one copy ofVVindovvs, or even odler opercrtlng systems, installed on 
your system. This means dlot advanced users sometimes have their opercrtlng system on a drive other 
than drive C.

Other Resources 
Most of the time, once you install an antivirus program that does ongoing 
monitoring and automatic updates, you won't need any more information 
about specific viruses. The software will detect most viruses before they have 
a chance to run and do you any harm. The antivirus program will clean most 
viruses reasonably safely.7 
But if you're interested in learning more about viruses, or learning details 
about specific viruses, or determining if a virus warning is a fraud, here are 
some web sites that will help.s

• About.com: http://netsecurity.about.com 
CERT is a federally funded organization that focuses on all aspects of com-
puter security. You'll also find that every antivirus software vendor has infor-
mation online. The Virus Bulletin is an independent magazine (and thus less 
likely to try to sell you their brand of antivirus software on every page). 
About.com has a great deal of information and up-to-date news on specific 
viruses and threats and antivirus software reviews. 
Antivirus software is only the first of the three elements you need to secure 
a system. In the next chapter, you'llleam about one that is equally important: 
your firewall.

Firewalls 
You've just learned about antivirus programs-the first of the three tools you 
have available to protect your computer. But you also learned that antivirus 
programs aren't perfect. Many of their imperfections originate with one obvi-
ous fact-an antivirus program can only look at flies that are already on your 
computer. Even though they can do a good job of detecting those flies and 
preventing them from running, the flie is nevertheless on your system, which 
poses some risk. 
In this chapter, you're going to learn about a tool whose job it is to prevent 
viruses from reaching your system in the first place. Firewalls are named after 
a kind of wall that exists in many buildings that is designed to slow the spread 
of a fire. They tend to be thicker or more fire resistant than other walls, and 
have fewer openings. 
Computer firewalls are designed to provide some separation between your 
computer and the Internet, or between your local network and the Internet. 
Think of the Internet as being "on fire"-a constant source of potential attacks 
on your system. Your firewall is deSigned to stop that fire from reaching your 
computer. 
As with antivirus programs, you should 
always have some type of firewall active. 
5 
Later in the chapter you'll learn about the different types of firewalls, how 
to choose a firewall, and most important, how to open ports in a firewall so you 
can do things like play games online or host web sites while still keeping your 
system secure. 
I ~I NOTE This is a long chapter. one of the longest in the book. Don't feel 
/V 
you have to read it all the way though-once you've gotten past the 
explanations of firewalls, you'll be able to skim through and focus on only those 
parts of the chapter that apply to your own situation. 

__ .*&;'. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
How Firewalls Work 
In Chapter 3, you learned about Internet attacks (you might want to go back 
and review that section before continuing). You learned how every computer 
has an IP address, and that many attacks are based on outside computers try-
ing to contact your machine and trick it into running some sort of program by 
accessing one of the services you may be running-preferably a service that 
has a security flaw that they can exploit. 
A firewall is a tool that intercepts and blocks incoming requests to your 
computer. Firewalls can be implemented in hardware or software, and each 
approach has advantages and disadvantages, as you'll soon see. 
Now, the topic of firewalls is actually very complex-there are entire books 
written on the subject. The good news is that most of that complexity is only 
needed by large organizations with complex networks. So rather than trying to 
give you a broad (but Simple) overview of firewalls, I'm going to focus on just 
two scenarios: one based on using a simple home router, and the other based 
on software. For each one, I'm going to go into a fair amount of depth. That's 
because you'll need to understand something about how each of these appro-
aches works in order to know how to bypass it for online gaming or instant 
messaging without at the same time compromising your overall security. 
Routers and NAT 
If you have a DSL or cable connection, it's possible for you to have more than 
one computer sharing your Internet connection. To accomplish this, your 
cable or DSL line most likely connects to a box called a router (because it 
routes Signals from one computer and network to another). 
In order to share an Internet connection, a router uses a protocoP called 
Network Address Translation or NAT for short. To understand NAT, you have 
to keep in mind that your DSL or cable modem assigns you a single IP 
address.2 Anytime you dial up to the Internet, you are assigned an IP address 
by the dial-up service. That means that as far as the Internet is concerned, you 
have one computer on the Internet. This raises an interesting question: If each 
computer has its own IP address, how can more than one computer share an 
IP address?3

Every packet of information on the Internet has a source IP address and 
destination IP address. So, let's say you have two computers on your home 
network sharing the nctional IP address A.B.C.D4 as shown in Figure 5-1. If 
one sends out a request for information to the apress.com server,5 the server 
will receive the request (1), and try to send a response back. However, the 
response packet won't be able to nnd its way to the correct computer (2). Two 
computers on a network with the same IP address can't communicate with 
each other. In fact, in most cases your computer will detect the presence of 
two computers with the same IP address on a network and will report an error 
(and disable access to the network).

A.B.C.O 
Figure 5-1 Two computers sharing an IP address just doesn't work. 
The trick for solving this problem is shown in Figure 5-2. Instead of 
assigning your IP address to a computer, you assign it to a router. As far as the 
Internet is concerned, your router is the computer on the Internet with IP 
address A.B.C.D. Your router then assigns each computer on your home 
network a private IP address, typically 192.168.1.N,6 where N is a number 
4 Every tP address has four numbers. each from 0 to 255. so assume A.B.C.D represents whatever tP 
address you have been assigned by your Internet service provider. 
S Whenever you type in a domain nome, such as apress.com. your computer uses a service called 
Domain Nome Service (DNS) to look up the correct IP address for that domain nome. So In effect 
domain names and tP addresses are two ways of saying the some thing: on address on the Inr.erne"t. 
6 Some routers use 192. 168.0 .N . 

__ a 'I .. ' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
between 2 and 255. The router itself tells your local network that your 
Internet gateway-the first machine your computer should contact to send 
data to the Internet-is 192.168.1.1, which is the IP address of the router 
(as seen on the local network). That's right-the router has two different IP 
addresses: one on the private network and the other one (assigned by your 
ISP) on the Internet. 
Figure 5-2 Two computers are assigned private IP addresses by a router that uses NAT. 
Let's say your first computer, 192.168.1.2, wants to connect to 
http://www.apress.com. Here's what happens: 
• The request from 192.168.1.2 with destination apress.com is first sent 
to the router at 192.168.1.1 <D. 
• The router strips off the "from" IP address, and swaps in your assigned 
IP address A.B.C.D @. 
• The router stores in memory the fact that a request was made to 
http://www.apress.com from 192.168.1.2. 
• The Apress server receives the request and sends a response. The 
response data is marked as from http://www • apress. com and going to 
A.B.C.D@. 
• The router receives the response. It examines the packet and looks in 
its own memory and discovers that 192.168.1.2 had previously made a 
request to http://www • apress. com and is expecting a response. So the 
router strips off the "to" IP address of A.B.C.D and swaps in 
192.168.1.2 @. 
• 192.168.1.2 receives the response. 

Chapter 5 Guardians at the Gate: Firewalls 
-=1~iI:o __ 
As you can see, the router "tricks" each computer on your network into 
thinking that it's directly on the Internet. As far as the Internet is concerned, 
there is only one computer connected-it doesn't know it's just a router. 
Internet Connection Sharing on XP 
Windows XP includes a feature called Internet Connection Sharing, which 
allows one Internet connection to be shared with other computers on your 
local network. In effect, this turns the computer into a router. 
I'm not going to go into any further detail on this feature for two reasons: 
I. I think it's very uncommon in home systems. Dial-up connections are 
too slow to be worth sharing, and few home computers have the dual 
network cards needed to configure the system as a true router 
replacement. 
2. External routers are so inexpensive now, and provide such a high level 
of reliable security, that they are a much better approach overall. 
Security Implications of NAT 
Now imagine for a moment that your computer at 192.168.1.3 is loaded with 
obsolete software, and is running several services that are known to be vulner-
able to Internet attacks. What happens when an infected computer on the 
Internet or hacker tries to attack your computer? 
• The infected computer sends a request to your IP address at A.B.C.D. 
• The router receives the request and looks in memory to see if any of 
your computers had made a request of the infected computer. 
• Seeing none, the router checks to see if it has any instructions with 
regards to the particular port-if requests to that port have been 
asSigned to one of your computers. 
• If not, the router just ignores the request. 
In other words-even though one of your computers is very vulnerable to 
attack, the router blocks dangerous requests before they can get to the system. 
This is one of the true "good news" stories with regards to computer secu-
rity. All the routers that people have installed in order to share Internet con-
nections provide, as a side effect, excellent firewall protection as well! 
On the other hand, NAT can pose challenges when it comes to online gam-
ing or hosting services. You'll learn how to handle those challenges later in this 
chapter. 

•• 
If'l Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Firewall Software 
If you connect to the Internet through a modem, or your computer is con-
nected directly to a DSL or cable modem, your computer is given an IP 
address (either during dial-up or other configuration provided by your ISP). 
With this IP address, your computer is directly on the Internet-in fact, the 
Internet is really nothing more than a large number of computers that are 
connected together. 
Now, if you are using a dial-up modem, you're pretty much stuck with this. 
However, if you are using a DSL line or cable modem, you can use a router 
with NAT even if all you have is that one computer. 
Because a router provides outstanding firewall protection 
and can be purchased for under $40, I recommend you use 
one on your DSL or cable modem line even if you will 
never connect more than one computer. 
But if you are using dial-up, or don't want to invest in a router, you can add 
firewall protection to your computer using software. Even if you have a router, 
you may want to add firewall software as an extra level of protection. 
Firewall software is actually pretty easy to understand. 
Think for a moment about the problem a firewall is trying to solve. Your 
computer may have programs (services) running that are listening to requests 
from the Internet (your computer is acting as a server). Some of those services 
may have vulnerabilities that would allow an Internet request to invade your 
system-even if you don't do anything. A router solves this problem by block-
ing those requests before they even get to your computer. 
A software firewall is a program that intercepts Internet requests before 
they are forwarded to the service programs on your computer. 
Just as computers communicate with each other, programs communicate 
with each other as well. When a program or service wants to communicate 
with the network, it doesn't communicate directly to your network card-it 
goes through the operating system. This means that all Internet communica-
tion goes through the operating system first. A software firewall is a piece of 
software that is designed so that all Internet communication goes through the 
firewall as well. Sometimes the firewall is part of the operating system, some-
times it hooks itself into the operating system to perform its task. 
The firewall software contains a set of rules that you define that allow it to 
decide whether each network request should go through. These rules can take 
many factors into account including the following: 
• Is it an outgoing request from your computer, or an incoming request 
from another computer? 
• Is the other computer within your local network, or on the Internet? 

Chapter 5 Guardians at the Gate: Firewalls .'''ioIIi __ 
• What application (e-mail, browser, etc.) is making the request? 
• What application is trying to become a server (listen to incoming 
network requests)? 
• What is the port number of the request?7 
And so on ... 
Software firewalls provide a great deal of flexibility; however, with that 
flexibility comes a certain amount of complexity, which raises security issues 
as you will read shortly. 
Firewalls and Dial-Up Connections 
Once upon a time, it was common knowledge that people who dial up to the 
Internet with a modem don't need firewall software. There used to be some 
truth to this. Dial-up connections are less vulnerable than DSL and cable 
modem connections for a number of reasons: 
• With a dial-up connection, you get a different IP address each time. 
This makes it a bit more difficult to find you (if you're an attacker), but 
more important, makes your computer less useful. You see, if someone 
wants to use your computer as a server (say, a porn site, pirate software 
site, etc.), they prefer your computer to have a fixed IP address. 
• Dial-up connections are limited to 56 kbits/sec going into your 
computer (download speeds) and only 28 kbits/sec coming out of your 
computer. This also makes it less useful as a server, and means any 
attack would take longer to accomplish. 
• In the past, dial-up connections were expensive-IO cents/minute was 
not unheard of. So people did not stay logged on for hours at a time. 
This Significantly reduced the chance of a computer being attacked. 
While dial-up connections are still slow compared to DSL and cable 
modem lines, most of these arguments no longer apply. 
• With most services offering unlimited access plans, and the spread of 
online gaming, instant messaging, and increased use of the web, it's not 
unusual for your computer to be logged on for hours at a time. That's 
plenty of time to find and attack a system even through a modem. 
• There are many more computers on the Internet, and significantly 
more viruses and Trojans out there. A vulnerable computer connected 
to the Internet may be attacked and infected in a matter of minutes. 
7 Ports were described in Chapter 3. 

__ 
;A;j:.' Part I ProteaingYour Machine 
• While dynamic IP addresses may make a computer less useful as a 
selVer, they don't prevent it from being used by a Trojan-some of 
which can contact a hacker's computer to let them know the current 
IP address. Also, the lack of a flXed IP is an advantage for hackers who 
are planning Denial of Service attacks, because they are harder for a 
victim to block.8 
It's therefore essential that you use firewall software if you are connecting 
to the Internet through a modem. 
Where Firewalls Fail 
Firewalls, like antivirus programs, have weaknesses. And like antivirus 
programs, those weaknesses most often have to do with how you use them. 
The Window of Vulnerability 
Picture this scenario. 
• You just bought a new computer. The operating system doesn't include 
a firewall. You have a DSL line that you plan to connect to, or you're 
connecting through a modem, and you know that you need to install a 
firewall. So you decide to buy one online. 
• You boot up your computer, connect to the Internet, find an online 
store, and buy and download the firewall software. 
• You install the firewall software. 
What's wrong with this picture? 
The problem with this scenario is that between the time you connected 
your computer to the Internet for the first time, and the time you installed the 
firewall, your computer was unprotected. Sure, it may only have been 10 or 15 
minutes, but that can be enough for an attack to succeed.9 
I 
~ I RULE OF THUMB If you are using a software firewall. buy a retail 
~ package or be sure one is installed on the computer BEFORE you 
connect to the Internet for the first time. 
8 Si'tes block Denial or Service attacks by filtering out attacking IP addresses. Ir a compuTer keeps 
changing IP addresses, its attack Is much harder to block. 
9 Remember. there are large numbers or machines just randomly "targeting IP addresses ... searching ,-or 
a vulnerable compu'ter. Some of 'them belong 'to hackers, but moST are those InfeC'ted by viruses and 
WOrmS 'that are trying 'to spread themselves.

If you are using a router with NAT, you don't have to worry about this 
problem. 
Your Local Network 
The big difference between a router and a software firewall is where the 
protection occurs. 
Figure 5-3 shows a typical configuration with a router-based firewall. An 
attack from the Internet (symbolized by a thick arrow on the right) is blocked. 
However, a router doesn't protect you from attacks from other computers on 
your local network.

You might want to conclude from this that you should always have a soft-
ware firewall, but that isn't necessarily the case. If all of your local machines 
have active antivirus software and you are behind a router, the chances of you 
suffering from internal attacks in your home network are very slim. Businesses 
are much more likely to benefit from having the extra protection, as they may 
have dozens, hundreds, or thousands of computers on their local networks. 
Human Nature and Firewalls 
I sometimes host LAN parties,lO so here's a scenario I've seen many times: 
• A friend brings over his computer in order to play games or do some 
fIle exchanges. 
• He starts running a game server, but nobody else can see the game ... 
or he shares a drive so that you can exchange files, but you can't 
connect to his machine. 
• After trying a whole bunch of different things, somebody suddenly 
figures out, "Hey, did you tum off your software firewall?" 
• After yelling at each other for a few minutes for being idiots, he turns 
off his firewall and the game or file sharing commences. 
Do you see the problem here? 
Or here's a related scenario that I've also seen many times: 
• You've been on your instant messaging service with a friend, and 
suddenly she wants to send you a cool picture or fIle. 
• She tries to send a fIle, or open a direct connection to your computer, 
but after an endless delay (with her asking every few seconds "Did you 
click Accept? Did you click Accept?"), you get a message saying the 
connection could not be established-you may be behind a firewall. 
• "Oops!" she says. She turns off the firewall and presto-the connection 
succeeds and you get the fIle. 
Do you see the problem now? 
The key phrase is "turns off the firewall." 
Now, as you will see in the next section, it's quite possible to open holes in 
your firewall so you can do things like host games, share fIles, and start 1M 
direct connections without compromising your overall security.

each bringing over their computer. and play network games late into the night and often well into the 
next day. 

Chapter 5 Guardians at the Gate: Firewalls -.;'.' ... __ 
But when you're in a hurry, because your friend needs to log off 1M, or 
because your friends are all yelling at you to start the game, and you need to 
bypass the firewall security, you aren't going to take the time to search through 
the online help and figure out how to do it. You're going to disable the firewall. 
That's human nature. 
When I've been in these situations, I have NEVER seen anyone, teen or 
adult, do it the correct way. They just disable the firewall "only for now" to get 
on with the task at hand. 
In the case of a LAN party that I host, the risk of turning off the firewall is 
fairly small. My entire network is behind a router, and I keep my computers 
up to date and configured properly (as you'll read about in the next chapter). 
I also ask my friends to do a virus scan before they arrive, and if they haven't, 
I install antivirus software and do it for them. 
But turning off that software firewall completely is risky if any of the 
machines brought over for the party are infected. And it's never safe for 
allowing a direct connection (including P2P flle sharing). 
This is probably the greatest flaw in firewall software-and it's not a 
technical flaw at all. It's purely human nature. 
That's why I always recommend people with DSL or cable modem con-
nections to use a router even if you only have one computer. As with software 
firewalls, you can open ports to allow direct connections, host games sites, and 
so on, but unlike software firewalls, there is no trivial way to just tum off all 
protection. 11 
Sometimes It's Just Too Late 
Router-based firewalls do a great job blocking incoming requests. But they 
generally do nothing to block outgoing requests. This means that once a com-
puter is infected with a Trojan, there is nothing to prevent the Trojan from 
opening connections to a cracker's system. Once that connection is open, the 
cracker can have full access to your system. 
Many software-based firewalls can be configured to work in both direc-
tions-where only certain applications are permitted to access the Internet. 
For example, they'll allow only your web browser or e-mail client to initiate an 
Internet connection. They can prompt you when a program is trying to access 
the Internet or act as a server. This allows you to effectively block viruses and 
Trojans because they won't be on the list of approved applications. 
This is one argument in favor of installing a software firewall on your sys-
tem in addition to using a router-it does provide an extra level of protection, 
in the event that a virus or Trojan does get on your system. 
II Many routers do allow you to assign one connection as a DMZ or demilitarized zone-o com-
puter that is effectively directly on the Internet-where all requests are forwarded to that computer 
by default. However. this has little application to any home use. You are much better off directing indi-
vidual ports as described in the next section because using a DMZ is like using no firewall at all. 

••• ·Ifll Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Choosing a Firewall 
The best strategies for using a firewall should now be pretty clear to you. 
If you are using a dial-up connection with a modem, you should always 
have a software firewall. You should never tum it off. If you need to bypass it 
for some reason, take the time to learn how to use the program to allow you to 
bypass it for the one service you need, rather than turning it off completely 
(you'll learn how to do this later in this chapter). 
If you are using a DSL connection or cable modem, spend the $40 to buy 
a router that supports NAT (it will say that it allows sharing of your Internet 
connection by multiple computers). If you wish to be extra safe, or if you're 
concerned about the security of other computers on your local network, you 
may want to use a software firewall as well. The section "ChOOSing Firewall 
Software" that appears later in this chapter has more information to help you 
decide if you wish to do so. 
Choosing a Router 
Routers come in many different sizes and price ranges, from the $40 home 
unit to large corporate systems costing tens of thousands of dollars. 
For home use, the key feature you're looking for is Internet Connection 
Sharing (which is the marketing term router manufacturers use for NAT-
Network Address Translation). Most routers will also claim to have firewalls 
built in. Unfortunately, while not dishonest, it can be hard to determine what 
this actually means. As you've already learned, NAT itself acts as a firewall, so 
marketers can legitimately claim that any NAT router is a firewall. Some 
routers include keyword fllters-blocking access to sites that have certain key-
words in their URV2 and call that a firewall feature. Other routers include the 
same kind of IP fllter rule settings as software firewalls. This sounds like it will 
prOvide even better protection, until you remember that NAT itself is already 
prOviding excellent protection. What the IP fllter rules really provide is more 
flexibility. For example, NAT allows you to direct incoming web requests to a 
particular computer, but IP fllters would also allow you to restrict incoming 
web requests to those coming from specified computers. This kind of flexibil-
ity is rarely needed for home use. 
One reason that routers are so inexpensive is that there is a lot of competi-
tion. The good news is that they are all very comparable-you're unlikely to go 
wrong choosing any of the major brands. The bad news is that at those kinds of

prices the companies generally can't afford high-quality technical support. 
Because router models change frequently, it's not possible for me to review 
and recommend specific routers here-by the time you read this the informa-
tion will be obsolete. So here's how you go about choosing a router: 
Visit your local retailer or an online store and write down a list of routers 
that look like good candidates. Be sure you first decide if you are getting a 
wired or wireless router (wireless are more expensive, and typically slower, 
but you don't have to run cables between the computers). 
• Visit the web site for the manufacturer of each router. 
• See if you can download the manual for the router from the 
manufacturer's web site. If they don't have the manual available, 
consider a different router. 
• See if the manual is clear and includes the features you need.13 
Chances are it has far more capability than you need. Don't worry if 
you don't understand all the features-some are deSigned for network 
experts. However, be sure you understand how to use the features that 
you care about--especially how to assign server ports to particular 
computers. 
• Look at the support section on the web site. Look for a good F AQ 
section-that's going to be your best source of information if you run 
into trouble. 
• Check the downloads section for the router. Does it look like the 
company provides updated firmware14 for their routers? 
• Check out customer comments online at Amazon.com, Epinions.com 
(or other online retailers), and comments and reviews at CNET.com. 
Because routers at this level all have similar features, and similar prices, 
chOOSing based on the quality of support available on the web site is a very 
reasonable approach. 
Router Manufacturers 
There are many router manufacturers to choose from. I'm going to list a few in 
Table 5-1, but let me stress that even a cheap off-brand router will probably do 
the job. 
13 In this book I've only discussed securiTy-related features . Your Internet service provider should be 
able to help you determIne what other features you may need in a router for use with their particular 
service.

There are probably just as many (or more) choices for firewall software as 
there are antivirus programs. But as with antivirus programs, you'll probably 
end up using one of the more popular choices. The good news is that you may 
already have one-firewall software is often packaged with antivirus software 
(for example, at the time this book was printed, McAfee included their 
personal firewall product with their retail antivirus software). Both Symantec 
and McAfee sell security bundles that include both antivirus and firewall 
protection.

Chapter 5 Guardians at the Gate: Firewalls 1.:"";' __ 
On Software Bundles 
All the major antivirus and fIrewall vendors sell software bundles beyond the 
core product. So, for example, you can buy Norton AntiVirus software, or you 
can buy Norton Internet Security, which includes a fIrewall, privacy control, 
antispam software, parental control, and so on. Obviously, they make more 
money on the entire bundle. 
In working on this book, I faced two possible approaches: I could evaluate 
and talk about the various bundles available, or I could focus on individual 
products and features. 
I chose the latter approach for several reasons: 
First, bundles and features change-so today's product recommendations 
won't necessarily apply tomorrow. 
Second, most teens I know want to purchase the least amount of software 
possible. Many bundled features simply make it easier to do something that you 
can actually do quite easily on your own (like clearing your browser history). 
Finally, and most importantly-I have a strong bias towards installing the 
least amount of software protection needed to provide good security. That's 
because Windows is complex, and invasive software (which includes most of 
these security products) inevitably changes the behavior of your system. It can 
lead to performance slowdowns. It can cause other applications to fail in unex-
pected ways. It can lead to problems with Windows itself. Your operating sys-
tem and the applications you have installed form a very complex system-and 
every system is different. Thus there is no way for a software vendor to test 
their software against every possible scenario. Plus, Murphy's Law16 says that 
any nontrivial computer program has bugs (any computer program with more 
than 10 lines of code is nontrivial). So every time you install a security or pri-
vacy tool, you increase the chances of some unpleasant side effect occurring. 17 
This is, in fact, the main argument for avoiding a software fIrewall if you 
are using a router. The fIrewall software itself has the potential to interfere 
with the operation of other applications. 
If you buy a bundled package, take the time to read about the various 
products and tools that are included and only install those that you want and 
understand. Some of these products can be somewhat invasive-meaning they 
modify the way your system works in various ways, and they can interfere with 
each other. For example, if you install a software fIrewall you got with a 
Norton bundle, you defInitely don't want to install another fIrewall! 
16 The First Murphy's Law is, "Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong." There are hundreds of 
others. 
17 I develop software using a Microsoft product called Visual Studio .NE.T. After a recent antivirus 
software update, I started getting warnings every time I ran the program. McAfee had installed a new 
feature called Script Stopper that was designed to prevent dangerous scripts from running, and it 
dedded that Visual Studio was running a dangerous script. Script Stopper did bring up a prompt that 
allowed me to either stop the script. or let it continue. However. Visual Studio .NET would crash even 
after I told Script Stopper to allow the script to run. Fortunately, it's possible to disable Script Stopper, 
but it shows you how two working programs can interfere with each other to cause problems.

!l1'. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
There is value in having software that performs additional security checks 
for you-it can serve as a backup in case you miss something. It can make 
things easier. It can automate tasks that you would otherwise have to do 
yourself. In doing so it improves your level of security, but remember: There is 
no such thing as "perfect" security. There are only various degrees of security. 
My focus is to bring you to a level that is good enough to protect you from 
almost every threat, while at the same time minimizing both the cost and 
hassle of doing so. 
Firewall Software Manufacturers 
Speaking of which, the most popular standalone firewall software is probably 
ZoneAlarm. ZoneAlarm comes in a standard Firewall-only edition that is cur-
rently free. (Visit http://www.zonealarm.com. ) They also sell higher-end pack-
ages that include a number of other privacy and security features. However, 
some of these features duplicate capability already built into many antivirus 
products, and some of the features just make it easy to do things like managing 
cookies that I'll be showing you how to do yourself later. 
I've already mentioned McAfee and Symantec, which both have personal 
firewall products. 
I'm not going to go into detail on installing any of these firewalls-the 
instructions that come with each one should be fine to get you started. 
However, there is one firewall you may already have that may need nothing 
more than some quick configuration to enable. 
The Windows XP Firewall 
If you're using Windows XP or later, your operating system includes a built-in 
firewall, so you may not need to buy a third-party product at all. However, you 
may need to tum it on. is Here's how: 
From your Start menu, choose the Control Panel. Then choose Network 
Connections. Choose the Internet connection you use. Figure 5-5 shows a 
typical screen for a system connected to a DSL line or cable modem. You may 
also have a list of dial-up connections that you choose from if you use a 
modem to connect to the Internet. 
On Windows XP, you configure your firewall for each connection sepa-
rately-so if you use more than one Internet connection, be sure to set the 
firewall for each of them. 
To enable the firewall, right-click the Internet connection and choose the 
Properties menu. You'll see a dialog box---click the Advanced tab and you'll 
see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 5-6. 
If you're using a dial-up connection, you'll see additional settings that allow 
Internet connection sharing or other features, but you're only concerned with 
the firewall. 
/8 Microsoft left the firewall off by default in Windows XP until recently.

Remember-like all software firewalls, it can interfere with communica-
tion within your local area network (affecting things like drive sharing). The 
XP firewall is designed to protect computers connected directly to the 
Internet, not those on an in-house network. It's a very good choice for those 
using dial-up Internet connections. 
Firewalls, Online Gaming, and Other 
Services 
You've already learned that while firewalls are able to block outgoing connec-
tions (Internet requests made by your computer to others), in most cases your 
firewall won't be set up to do that. Routers using NAT don't block outgoing 
connections by default (some advanced routers allow you to create outgoing 
fllters, but they are disabled by default, and if you turn any of them on you 
presumably know how to turn them back off). The XP firewall doesn't block 
outgoing connections. Other firewall software does allow blocking of outgoing 
connections but makes it fairly easy to disable this feature.19 
On the other hand, most firewalls, including all routers that use NAT, by 
default block all incoming connections-requests made by other computers to 
your computer. 
Curiously enough, this is just fine for most adult users. All they do is 
browse the web, check e-mail, share drives and printers, and occasionally con-
nect to work using a virtual private network (VPN).20 All of these tasks only 
require outgoing connections. 
But some of the most common ways teens use computers require your 
computer to act as a server as well. For example: 
• Hosting a game server like Counterstrike 
• Using a game service (like Battlenet) that works better (fewer drops, 
less lag) when your computer can receive incoming connections 
• Performing instant messaging flle transfers and direct connections 
• Using Kazaa and other P2P services 
• Experimenting with web sites 
All of these require you to allow access from the Internet to a specific port on 
your computer. 
19 Experts may scream at this point that I haven't even mentioned proxy servers. To which I answer, 
home users don't have proxy servers. If you're looking to apply knowledge gained in this book to a 
business/corporate setting. you should go out and learn about proxy servers, too.

Common Server Ports 
The first step to opening a hole in your firewall is to figure out what port the 
service needs. Your best bet for finding this information is to check on the web 
for the particular service where you can usually find an FAQ section contain-
ing advanced networking information. 
There are two different kinds of Internet connection: TCP and UDP. The 
difference between them isn't really important-basically the TCP protocol is 
a more reliable kind of connection, but is not quite as fast because the sending 
computer receives confirmation that the data was sent. The UDP protocol 
doesn't require confirmation, but the sender is never certain the data was 
actually received. When configuring your firewall you need to know the proto-
col (TCP or UDP) as well as the port number 
Table 5-2 lists some of the most common ports. Note that only incoming 
ports are listed-if your firewall is blocking outgoing ports, you'll have to 
research the web sites and help HIes for each service to determine the 
outgoing ports.

The technical support or online help for your particular game or applica-
tion will have updated information on the ports required by that application. 
Some router and firewall manufacturers include configuration settings for 
popular services on their web sites. 
Configuring NAT 
Every router has its own configuration, so it's not possible to provide one 
formula or set of instructions that will work on every router. But the principles 
involved are similar. 
A NAT-based router isn't actually blocking a port-it's just discarding it 
because it doesn't know to which computer it belongs. So your job is to 
instruct the router to forward requests to that port to your computer. This 
involves three steps: 
I. Determine your IP address. 
2. If pOSSible, tell the router to always assign the current IP address to 
your computer. Remember, a NAT router assigns computers IP 
addresses from a local range (typically starting at 192.168.1.2). Some 
routers allow you to reserve an IP address, some don't, but most do 
tend to remember which computer got which address and reassign the 
same one. If you find your software has stopped working, you can 
check your IP address and see if it has changed, and then update the 
router accordingly. 
3. Instruct the router to forward requests to a certain port to your 
computer's IP address. 
DeterminingYour IPAddress 
Open a command window.22 
Type in the command ipconfig and press the Enter key. 
You'll see a result similar to what's shown in Figure 5-7. 
As you can see, my computer was assigned port 192.168.0.2 by this router. 
22 From the Start menu, look for Command Prompt. It may be under Programs ~ Accessories, or All 
Programs ~ Accessories. You can also use the Run command (rom the Start menu and type in crnd.

Figure 5-7 Using the IPConfig command 
ConfiguringYour Router Using a Browser 
Most modem routers can be configured using a web browser. Look at the 
default gateway address given to you by the IPConfig program. Then enter 
that IP address in the browser address bar. For example, in this case I would 
use http://192.168.0.1. 
You will be prompted for an account name and password. 
You probably won't know what it is. 
But that's OK, because 99 percent of the time people don't bother to 
change the password. So look in the router manual for the default login name 
and password. If you don't have the router manual, you can probably down-
load it from the manufacturer's web site. If you or your parents have changed 
the password and forgotten it, you'll need to check the manufacturer's web site 
for information on resetting the router to its factoI)' defaults, then reconfigur-
ing it for your network. 23 
For this example, I'll use an older but popular24 Netgear router, the 
RT314. 
After searching the menus for a while, I found a menu called Ports, or Port 
Forwarding, as shown in Figure 5-8. Some routers will call this Server Ports. 
In this example, you can see that I've directed the Battlenet ports to my 
computer. Generally speaking, routers make it easy to redirect entire blocks of 
ports to a single computer, which is essential for some games. 
23 I recently boughr a router and couldn'r log on until atter I had reset it co the factory defaults as 
described in the manual. Ir turns out it had been returned by a dissatisfied customer who had 
changed the password. The store just restocked it wirhout verifying that ir worked. Those of you who 
live in Silicon Valley can probably guess which store it was. 
24 I could use a newer router for the example, bur since they're all different anyway, and the newer 
ones are if anyrhing easier to configure. this is a reasonable choice.

When using NAT, depending on the game, you may be able to play it 
online from only one computer at a time. Check the documentation for your 
particular game for details.25 
This particular router did not allow you to assign specific IP addresses to a 
computer. 
Figure 5-9 shows the configuration window from another router, this one a 
Hawking router, in which an IP address is reserved for a particular computer 
based on its MAC address. The MAC address identifies a unique network 
card. You can find out the MAC address for your machine using the IPConfig 
command, but this time type in ipconfig fall and look for an entry called 
Physical Address. 
25 FYI:Warcraf!: III can be configured to run on different computers on your network simultaneously. 
There's a game setting that lets you specify the incoming port number (change it from 6 I 12). Next 
you configure your router to send each port to the correct machine.

Configuring a Router Through Telnet 
Most routers also allow an older style of configuration through an application 
called Telnet. This is an old-style terminal program. Even newer routers still 
support Telnet because it allows a router to be configured through a serial 
port. 
To configure a router with Telnet, bring up a command window (as 
described earlier), type in telnet 192.168.0.1,26 and then press Enter (obvi-
ously using the default gateway address for your router). You'll be prompted 
for a user name and password (or perhaps only a password). You'll then be 
brought to a configuration screen such as the one shown in Figure 5-10. 
Can you guess which menu selection you would use to set the port 
forwarding? 
That's right-number 15: the one dealing with server setup. 
You'll obviously need to refer to your own router's documentation for 
details on configuring your particular router. But these examples should at 
least point you in the right direction to help you find and understand your own 
router's features. 
26 On some routers this will be 192. 168. I. I-try it both ways to see which one works.

Configuring Software Firewalls 
Unlike routers, software firewalls have no problem figuring out which com-
puter is supposed to receive an Internet request-they are running on the 
computer that is receiving the request. So the question with software firewalls 
is whether or not the computer should see that request. 
To illustrate this, we'll look at two software firewall examples: the Internet 
Connection Firewall built into Windows XP, and ZoneAlarm. 
Configuring an Internet Connection Firewall on XP 
The firewall on Windows XP is an example of a very simple yet effective fire-
wall. Why Simple? For one thing, it only works in one direction-monitoring 
incoming requests from the Internet. It doesn't care what applications are 
running on your computer, and in fact doesn't prevent applications from trying 
to listen for incoming requests (and thus acting as servers). It just blocks 
incoming messages that it doesn't recognize. 
Earlier in this chapter you learned how to tum on the Internet Connection 
Firewall. In Figure 5-6 you saw a button labeled Settings-thiS is what you'll 
use to open ports in the firewall, allOwing requests to come through. When 
you click the Settings button, you'll see the dialog box in Figure 5-1l. 
This figure shows how you would allow your computer to act as a web server. 
I JJI NOTE You shouldn't turn this on unless you are actually running your 
own web server on the computer, and its software is completely up to 
date. Web servers are special targets for attackers and if incorrectly configured 
can pose a huge security risk!

To find the name of your computer, go back to the previous dialog box 
(shown in Figure 5-11), highlight any of the entries (don't check it), and click 
the Edit button. Copy whatever name you see in that entry and use it in your 
new entry. 
For Battlenet, you'll create a second entry for port 6112, this time 
selecting UDP. 
If you're trying to run a game that needs to listen to requests on many 
incoming ports, this is not the right firewall for you. You'll want to move up to 
a more advanced firewall. 
Configuring ZoneAlarm 
As mentioned earlier, ZoneAlarm is one of the most popular firewall products, 
and their basic firewall is free for personal use (at least at the time this book 
was printed). 
ZoneAlarm, like other advanced firewalls, does a lot more than block 
incoming requests. It also 
• Detects when an application is trying to connect to the Internet, and 
lets you decide if that application should be allowed to do so. 
• Detects when an application is trying to act as a server-to listen to 
incoming Internet requests-and lets you decide if that should be 
allowed. 
• Remembers what different applications are allowed to do, effectively 
learning as it goes based on the software actually installed on your 
machine. 
• Allows you to distinguish between data sent to and from the Internet, 
and data sent to and from systems on your local network (or other 
trusted systems). 
When trying to connect to Battlenet from Warcraft III, you'll notice that 
your application freezes. If you press Alt-Tab to get to the main screen, you'll 
find a prompt such as that shown in Figure 5-13. 
You would typically click Yes, and check the box telling ZoneAlarm to 
remember Warcraft III for next time. 
The same thing will happen when you try to create a game on Battlenet, 
except that your entire computer may seem to freeze. That's because Warcraft 
III is a full-screen application, and it's sometimes difficult for Windows to 
switch between graphic modes. So you may never actually see the warning in 
Figure 5-14 that comes up when Warcraft III tries to act as a server.27 
27 So how did I get to it? Pressed Ctrl-Ah-Del to bring up the Windows Security dialog box (this was on 
Windows 2000), clicked Cancel to see the screen with the alert, and pressed AIt-Tab to get back to 
Warcraft.

A better approach is to configure Warcraft III using the advanced program 
configuration option. Figure 5-15 shows the Program configuration screen in 
ZoneAlarm where you can add specific applications and set whether it's just 
accessing the Internet, or also acting as a server.

Once an application is configured in this way, you should no longer see 
those alerts, and ZoneAlarm should no longer interfere with the program. 
This is obviously just the briefest introduction to ZoneAlarm, and your ver-
sion may differ (especially if you have the more advanced Plus or Pro edition). 
But the principle applies to other software firewall products as well, and this 
introduction should at least give you a good start. 
Remember, your game or firewall manufacturer will have online help and 
FAQ information that can help you configure your firewall for specific games. 
Things to Remember 
This has been a long chapter-the longest in the book, actually. But it's one of 
the most important subjects, and probably the most complex. The good news 
is, you actually now know quite a lot about how the Internet actually works, 

_~;iIOJII. Part I Protecting Your Machine 
and should mow enough to more easily understand the specific instructions 
of your own firewall, and the applications you run (at least as far as Internet 
connectivity is concerned). 
For those who are feeling a bit lost, here's a quick summary of the key 
recommendations: 
For those of you using a dial-up Internet connection: 
• Install a software firewall. Learn how to use it. 
• If you have XP, you can use the built-in firewall. 
For those of you using a DSL, cable modem, or other high-speed 
connection: 
• Use a router that supports NAT (Internet Connection Sharing). 
• If you download a lot of software, or would like an extra level of 
protection, consider using a software firewall as well. If you are not 
using a router, you MUST use a software firewall. 
If you use a software firewall, learn how to perform any tasks you need 
without disabling the firewall completely-your firewall documentation will 
help you with this. Now it's time to look at ways to help your computer resist 
attack, even in cases where your antivirus software' or firewall aren't enough to 
do the job.

Locking Up, Part I: 
Softvvare Updates 
You've learned about antivirus tools and firewalls, the first two of the three pil-
lars of computer security. In this chapter, you're going to learn about software 
updates, which are in their own way just as important as what you've learned 
up until now. 
It might have struck you as odd that in both of the previous chapters I 
talked about not only the value of antivirus tools and firewalls, but also the 
ways in which each of them can faiL This is important, because most security 
vulnerabilities come from a failure of some sort-whether a failure in technol-
ogy (such as bugs in Windows), or a failure in human judgment (such as being 
tricked into opening a virus). 
Look at it this way: 
It's quite unlikely that you would intentionally install and run a virus on 
your system, right? 
So anytime your system is infected, something has gone wrong. Something 
has failed. 
No human is perfect. The assaults and trickery of e-mail, temptingly 
named downloads, and our own curiosity to just see what that strange program 
will do, means that even security experts will sometimes find themselves fran-
6 
. cally cleaning their system---despite the be t prot ction of antivirus tools and 
firewalls. When it happens, we tend to be rather upset at ourselves-after all, 
who likes to make mistakes? 
But if we b at ourselv s up when w make a mistake, it's nothing n xt to 
the fury we feel when a problem occurs that isn't our fault. 
I mean, there are certain things that should be safe-always . 
• It should b safe to plug your com put r into th lot m t-it shouldn't 
be pos ible for some outsider to somehow connect into a system unless 
you do som thing to make that possible. 

__ 
III::fI• Part I Protecting Your Machine 
• It should be safe to browse the Web. I'm not talking about software 
downloads, I'm talking about just browsing web sites. There should be 
no way that just clicking a page link could damage your system. 
• It should be safe to view e-mail. I'm not talking about opening 
attachments-I mean simply viewing the content of the text part of 
the e-mail message. 
These things should be safe. They should be safe always. 
But they aren't. 
And the fault of this lies squarely with Microsoft. l For a very long time, 
they did not take security seriously-we know this because recently they have 
claimed to have changed their priorities so that safety is now their top priority. 
Now, to be fair, they have finally woken up to the problem and have be-
come a lot more responsive to security threats, and getting out updates, and 
notifying people about them. But it's a tough problem for a number of reasons. 
• An operating system is incredibly complex, and even if Microsoft had 
made security their top priority from the beginning, there would still 
be some security flaws in their software. Not as many, perhaps, but 
they would exist. 
• Microsoft is a victim of their own success. If you were a malicious virus 
author, what system would you focus your efforts on targeting. Mac? 
Linux? Of course not-you'd target Windows, because most everyone 
uses it. 
• By the same token, there are lots of white hats2 out there trying to find 
security flaws so that Microsoft will fix them. This puts Microsoft in a 
dilemma-if they ignore the flaw, sooner or later some virus will be 
created to take advantage of it. If they announce the flaw and create an 
update, someone will quickly create a virus to try to take advantage of 
it before people download and install the update. 
So the good news is that Microsoft has seen the light-they are now much 
more aggressive than they have been in the past at not only making their soft-
ware more secure from the start, but also providing updates to fix problems 
that exist. 
Unfortunately, that leaves tens of millions of computers out there that 
need to be updated in order to be secure. That's your job. Until you update 
your computer, it will be vulnerable to attacks even if you don't make any 
"mistakes." 
, And I'm probably going to get endless grieffrom my friends at Microsoft for saying so. Sigh ...

Chapter 6 Locking Up, Part I: Software Updates 
.,;1:CoI
' __ 
Updating New Computers 
You just brought home that new computer, with the vel)' latest version of 
Windows and included antivirus protection. You're safe right? 
Wrong! 
In fact, your computer may be at its most vulnerable, because your confi-
dence that it's safe might make you careless. 
You see, when I said that Microsoft is finally taking security seriously, I mean 
they really are taking it seriously. And they're finding security flaws. Lots of 
them. Weekly. Go to http://www.microsoft.com/security and take a look at the 
list of security bulletins with updates. For example, I wrote this chapter origi-
nally in September 2003, and at that time I saw bulletins for 9/10/2003, 9/3/2003 
(five updates), 8/20/2003 (three updates), 8/13/2003 ... you see what I mean? 
The software on your new computer isn't as new as you think. The com-
puter may have been sitting on a shelf for a while. And, when the computer's 
manufacturer installs the operating system on a computer, they only install the 
most recent full version of the operating system. They do NOT install all of 
the updates that are available as of the date of manufacturing.3 So your com-
puter may have software that is six months or a year old on the day you buy it. 
And yes, the antivirus software on that computer may be that old as well-
which makes it, as you now know, pretty close to useless. 
So, even new machines need to be updated. 
UsingWindows Update 
The good news is that Microsoft makes it remarkably easy to update your 
system. But before you begin, I must offer a few cautions. 
Before You Start 
Microsoft allows you to update your computer through the Internet. But think 
about it: 
You're about to connect to the Internet in order to install software updates 
to close vulnerabilities to attacks from the Internet. 
Do you see the problem here? The last thing you want is for your com-
puter to be attacked while you're updating your system! 
So, before you connect your computer to the Internet (even if it's a new 
system), be sure you're using a router with NAT or have first installed a soft-
ware firewall as described in the last chapter. 
Then go directly to Windows Updat~o not browse the Web, do not 
check e-mail, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. 
J For example, I just bought a new IBM ThinkPad laptop with Windows XP ProfessionaJ-great 
machine. 8ut I had to spend an evening installing software updates to bring it up to date. 

__ a=I.' Port I ProteaingYour Machine 
Risks of Updating Your System 
I'm about to tell you about a web site that will automatically update your system. 
It does the best it can to update your system correctly and safely. But it can't 
know, nor can Microsoft possibly test, every possible combination of software on 
your system. I mean, by the time you add up the different versions of operating 
systems, the possible existence of different seIVice packs4 or updates, the num-
ber and variety of other possible applications on your system (in all their possible 
versions), plus the possible existence of viruses and the many possible configura-
tion settings-well, the truth is that each system is pretty close to unique. 
So there is a chance-a small one, but a definite chance-that installing a 
software update will screw up your system. This can range from minor errors like 
Internet Explorer failing to work" to major errors like the system failing to boot.6 
So, before updating your system, take a few minutes and prepare. The 
minimum you should do depends on your operating system. 
Regardless of operating system, you should back up any critical data 7 as 
described in Chapter 8. 
Windows 95/98/ME 
• Be sure you have a Windows startup disk. Create a startup disk by 
bringing up the Control Panel, choosing AddJRemove Programs, 
selecting the Startup Disk tab, and clicking the Create Disk button-
then follow the directions. 
The startup disk will allow you to at least boot your system to a command 
prompt if the worst occurs. Once you've created a startup disk, store it some-
where safe. You don't need to create one before each update. 
Windows 2000 
• Be sure you know where your original Windows 2000 CD is, or, if your 
system didn't come with one, make sure you're familiar with the system 
restore procedure for your computer. 
4 A service pock Is a major update u,at cons/su of many smaller updates. I'll talk more about: them 
shortly. 
oS As happened 1:0 me recenl:ly when u-yinl1t:o install on Int:ernet Explorer update on on older system 
6 As happened juS!: loS!: week 1:0 a covvorker when Inttalling a 'Windows XP update 
7 Backing up, as you'll read In Chapt;er B, Is a/ways a good Ideo. However, if; Isn't absolutely cr/f;/cal to 
do so before on update. That's because update failures, if they occur, may couse your sySI:em to fall to 
boot. However, on update failure shouldn't cause you to lose your files. 

Chapter 6 Locking Up, Part I: Software Updates ~ 
• Create an emergency rescue disk. Do this by going to the Start menu, 
choosing Program ~ Accessories ~ System Tools ~ Backup, and then 
clicking the Emergency Repair Disk button. You'll need two blank 
floppy disks before starting. If you're on a machine that doesn't have a 
floppy drive, you should still do this-just be sure you check the box 
labeled "Also backup registry to the repair directory". The floppy backup 
will fail, but you'll have a backup of the registry on your hard drive. 
You don't need to create an emergency rescue disk before each update. 
You should create one if you've installed any major applications or changed 
your hardware since you created your previous rescue disk. 8 
WindowsXP 
• Be sure to back up any critical data-just in case. 
• Be sure you know where your original Windows XP CD is, or, if your 
system did not come with one, make sure you're familiar with the 
system restore procedure for your computer. 
• Windows XP has a more advanced System Restore capability than 
previous Microsoft operating systems. Most Windows updates 
automatically create a system restore pOint-which you can restore 
from to go back to the prior state of the system (one that presumably 
worked) in case of difficulty. You can manually define a system restore 
point by going to the Start menu, chOOSing Program ~ Accessories ~ 
System Tools ~ System Restore and following the directions to create 
a new system restore point. You might also want to do this before 
installing other applications just to be safe. 
All Operating Systems 
Did I mention making a backup of any critical data? You know, of course, 
the importance of keeping good backups just in case of problems with 
viruses or updates, not to mention the inevitable disk crashes.9 I apolOgize, 
6 That's because application and hardware configuration settings are kept in the registry. l(your 
emergency rescue disk Isn't up to date, you may have to reinstall any applications or reconfigure 
hardware Installed after your rescue disk was created. 
9 Disk drives should be considered the one truly disposable part o(your computer. It's a mechanical 
device and it will (ail sooner or later--usually at the most Inconvenient possible time. This I know 
(rom harsh personal experience. How long should 0 good hard drive last? From what I've seen, any 
drive older than five years is living on borrowed time and could die at any moment. By the way, a disk 
can actually "crash"-
the magnetic head that floats over the magnetic disk COn crash into it, gouging 
deep scars into the coating and scattering metal particles contoinlng what's left. o( your data through-
out the now useless drive. These particles in turn cause the other heads to crash In a chain reaction 
o( high-speed self-destruction.

::.,;'.'. Part I ProteaingYour Machine 
but it is important, so I'm afraid you'll have to put up with me repeating it 
periodically. 
When the update is complete, if you have trouble with a particular applica-
tion that was updated, you can in most cases uninstall that update. This can be 
done through the Control Panel .. AddlRemove Programs command. Of 
course, uninstalling a security update is something you should avoid if at all 
possible, as doing so reopens your computer to the kind of attack the update 
was designed to stop. 
H serious problems occur during or after the update process, read 
Chapter 9, where I discuss ways to try to rescue systems that have been 
demolished by viruses.10 
Running Windows Update 
Now it's time to do the update. Type http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com 
in the address bar of your browser. You'll be brought to a site that will auto-
matically update your system. You may see one or more ActiveX control dialog 
boxes such as that shown in Figure 6-1.

N ow you're ready to decide what updates to install. 
Choosing Full or Partial Updates 
Windows Update divides updates into three different categories. Critical 
updates are updates that Microsoft believes are essential because they contain 
security fIxes. There are two types of critical updates: service packs and 
smaller updates. 
A service pack is a major operating system update. It includes not only 
security updates, but general bug fIxes as well. Service packs also tend to be 
quite large-often tens of megabytes. Also, service packs typically must be 
installed alone-in other words, Windows Update won't be able to install them 
along with other updates. 
The ideal sequence for updating is as follows: 
I. Run Windows Update. 
2. Click Install Now. If a service pack is in the list, Windows Update will 
tell you that your update list includes an update that must be installed 
by itself, and will allow you to continue with just that update. 
3. Complete the service pack installation-your system will typically need 
to be restarted. 
4. Go back to step 1 and run Windows Update again. Repeat this 
sequence until all critical patches are installed.

Now here's the bad news. Even on a new computer with a DSL connec-
tion, you're going to spend a few hours updating your software. If you're on a 
dial-up modem connection, the amount of time can be impractical. 
If you do have a dial-up connection, consider just letting your computer 
download the updates overnight. Otherwise, just install the security updates-
they are a lot smaller and will close off most vulnerabilities even if you don't 
install the full service pack. I do recommend installing the latest service packs if 
at all possible though-not only do they fix other bugs on your system, but also 
they tend to be better tested. You'll find after installing a service pack that there 
are fewer security updates in the list next time you go to the Windows Update 
web site. That's because a service pack already includes many security updates. 
The update list shows how large each file is, and anything under a few 
megabytes is reasonable for a modem download. However, don't trust the down-
load sizes of service packs-the size there is that of the service pack installation 
file, which in tum will try to download the rest of the service pack files. 
The Update Process 
Once you click the Install button, you'll typically see a license agreement such 
as the one shown in Figure 6-3.

Recommended Updates and Driver Updates 
The Windows Update site will also offer a set of recommended updates and 
possibly driver updates. These are updates that typically fix bugs in your sys-
tem but don't represent security vulnerabilities. It's up to you as to whether or 
not you want to install these. Certainly, if you're having trouble with a particu-
lar application, you should see if updates are available. For example, if a newer 
game isn't working, an updated video driver may be available that solves the 
problem.l2 Read the explanation for each update and decide for each one if it 
relates to anything you do on your computer and if you want to install it.

for Microsoft Office applications. Because Office documents (such as Word,

These are caught by most antivirus programs, but the Office applications 
themselves have security updates available. Just click the Check for Updates 
button to see if any are available for your system. 
Automatic Windows Update 
New Windows operating systems include a built-in automatic update feature. 
You can access it from the Control Panel (choose System) by selecting the 
Automatic Update tab. Some systems have an automatic update icon in the 
taskbar as well. 
The automatic update software goes to the Microsoft web site and 
performs the update tasks automatically based on your settings as shown in

Chapter 6 Locking Up, Part I: Software Updates 0. 
If you have automatic Windows Update installed, I would recommend the 
following settings: 
If you're on a dial-up connection, either disable the automatic update fea-
ture or choose the first option. This will prevent Windows Update from using 
your limited available bandwidth for updates while you're trying to do other 
things. 14 
If you have a high-speed connection, the second option is a good one. 
Windows will download the update in the background, and then notify you 
before it installs that update-giving you a chance to back up your data before 
the installation proceeds. 
The third option only makes sense for computers that are on all the time-it 
allows you to schedule a time for downloads. I don't like this option because it 
also installs the update without prompting you further, and thus doesn't give you 
a chance to back up your files before it does the update. 
Fake Update Notices 
If you received an e-mail from SecurityUpdate@microsoft.com that looked like 
Figure 6-6, what would you do? 
I hope your answer is that you would not install it. This e-mail message is a 
fraud.l5 
I 
~ I RULE OF THUMB Microsoft will NEVER e-mail a software patch to 
~ 
you. In fact, you shouldn't trust anyone who tries to e-mail a software 
update--reputable companies provide software updates through their web site, 
not e-mail. 
This particular message arrived on my machine carrying the 
W321Swen@MM virus. This particular worm doesn't do much harm on its 
own, but it does tum your machine into a mass mailer to spread the worm. 
It also turns off most antivirus and firewall software (thus making you vulnera-
ble to other attacks), and blocks other programs (like the registry editor) that 
could be used to clean the virus. 
I. Bandwidth was discussed in Chapter 2, where you learned how a virus or spyware using the 
Internet Gould slow down browsing and file downloads, and cause extreme lag or disconnects with 
online games. Downloading a software update can do the same. 
IS One of my reviewers pointed out a curious fact: Many fake update messages are written by people 
whose spelling or grammar is questionable (to put it kindly). In this case, "on malidous user" is a 
tip-off. But don't get into the habit of judging fakes by their writing-it's not a reliable indicator.

Into the Home Stretch 
Keeping your Windows system up to date is one of the best things you can do to 
reduce the vulnerability of your system to attacks. In this chapter, you learned 
how to update your system using Windows Update, and how to minimize the 
chances of problems on those rare occasions when Windows Update fails. 
Once you have a virus scanner and firewall on an updated system, you've 
closed off most of your computer's vulnerabilities. But there are a few left that 
need some hands-on attention-that's the subject of the next chapter.

ocking Up, Part 2: 
System and Application 
Configuration 
Updating your system is a critical part of making it secure. But it turns out that 
there are also a variety of ways you can change your computer's configuration 
to make it more secure, and equally important, to help you to avoid making 
mistakes or fix problems when they occur. 
In this chapter, the focus will be purely on security. In Part II of the book 
I'll revisit application configuration with an eye to protecting your privacy. 
E-Mail Settings 
If you are using an e-mail client program such as Outlook, Outlook Express, 
Eudora, Netscape Messenger, etc. (as compared to a web-based e-mail pro-
gram), you can do a number of things to improve security. 
The examples shown here will be for Outlook Express, but most e-mail 
clients have similar settings.

This not only prevents a potential virus from being downloaded to your 
system, it eliminates the risk of flaws in which just viewing a message can 
exploit a bug in the e-mail program to infect your system.l 
You can also check the box labeled "Read all messages in plain text". This 
prOvides added security, but you lose the ability to display HTML-based 
graphics in the message. 
Turn off JavaScript and ActiveX Contro's 
Figure 7-2 shows the Security settings for Outlook Express. 
An e-mail message can contain plain text (which is safe) or HTML (which 
is potentially dangerous). HTML makes an e-mail message work just like a 
web page, meaning it can normally run JavaScript or load ActiveX controls--
just like any other web page. Just viewing such a message can be dangerous-
especially if your software is not up to date. 
I A risk that is a/ready reduced because you've updated your system software, right?

To prevent this, be sure your e-mail program is set to use the Restricted

The "Warn me when other applications try to send mail as me" check box 
causes a warning to come up if another program tries to use Outlook Express

The "Do not allow attachments to be saved or opened ... " check box is 
a tough choice. If you check it, you won't be able to save or open many types 
of attachments-some of which you will actually want. If you have a good 
antivirus program, and are very careful with what you do with attachments, 
it's safe to leave this option unchecked.

Uncheck the option "Hide file extensions for known file types". In Chapter 3, 
you learned that the file extension can help you determine if a file is potentially 
risky. For example, a file with the extension .exe is an executable and carries the 
highest risk (meaning you should never run it unless you're sure it's safe). But it's 
hard to know the file type if the file extensions are hidden. (Wmdows does use 
different icons for different file types-but who actually remembers what those 
icons mean?)

When searching for a virus, you might also want to select the "Show hid-
den fIles and folders" option for hidden fIles and folders. This allows you to 
fmd worms that are trying to hide themselves.3 
Sharing Drives 
Those of you who have only one computer at home, or those who have more 
than one but don't connect them together, can skip this section. But if you do 
have multiple computers at home, there's a good chance they are on a local 
network. One of the advantages of a local network is you can share certain 
equipment-for example, instead of having a printer on each computer, you 
can have all your computers share one printer. 
It is also possible on a local network to share drives. 
I'm not going to gP into specifics of how to share drives here. It varies on 
each operating system, and there are enough issues that can come up on each 
operating system to fIll a chapter on its own. 
From a security perspective, you should do two things with regards to 
sharing drives: 
• If you don't have a local network, never share drives. After all, you 
don't want to share your drives with strangers on the Internet, right? 
Don't panic though-your firewall will block the attempts of outsiders 
to connect to your drives even if they are shared . 
• If you do want to share drives, always use a password on the share. For 
Windows 98/ME, this means assigning a specific password to the drive. 
For Windows 20001XP, it means making sure that all accounts on your 
computer have a password.4 
I'll talk more about passwords in Part II of this book, where I discuss pri-
vacy issues and how passwords make it harder for others to look at the con-
tents of your drive. The important thing to realize here is that some viruses 
don't just infect the system on which they land-they explore the local net-
work to try to find other systems they can connect to--especially looking for 
shared drives. If your share is protected by a password, it becomes much more 
difficult for a virus to connect to your system. 
3 Normally. files are set to "hidden" because they are critical operating system files. or otherwise files 
that should never be modified by the user. 
• You can actually fine-tune security of shared drives on Windows 2000 and XP to allow access only 
to spedfic accounts. Read the built-in help on drive sharing to find out how.

You can stop a running service by clicking the Stop button. But of more 
interest is the Startup type combo box, which has three options: Automatic, 
Manual, and Disabled. In this example, you see the Windows Messenger serv-
ice, which up until the very latest versions of Windows XP by default had a 
startup type of Automatic, meaning it is started automatically when Windows 
starts. This service is used by system administrators on large networks to send 
instant messages to people on the network. It is more often used by 1M spam-

also made a system vulnerable to certain attacks). By setting it to Manual, 
those messages are blocked-the service is turned off.

The new user you created will have its own application and desktop set-
tings (so you'll want to go back and check the other configuration settings 
described in this chapter). This user will not be an administrator, so you'll 
need to log on to the administrator account to do a variety of tasks (including 
updating your system, installing most antivirus and firewall software, and 
installing many applications). 
On Windows XP, bring up the control panel and choose User Accounts. 
You'll see a wizard that has a number of self-explanatory options. In terms of 
account type, XP Home refers to a user account as a Limited account. Just fol-
low the instructions on the wizard. XP Professional can be configured using 
the wizard, or using the same approach as Windows 2000. 
Remember to create a password for all of your accounts to provide the best 
protection. 
The reason to run under a user account, even though it can be inconven-
ient at times, is that any viruses or worms you aCcidentally run while under 
this account will also be running under that account-so they may not have 
enough permission to do all the things they want to do, and thus will cause 
less damage than they would under an administrator account.7 
Are User Accounts Worth the Trouble? 
The big dilemma with user accounts is Simple: The restrictions they put in 
place that prevent viruses from doing harm at the same time often prevent you 
from doing things you want to do. If you choose this approach, you will at 
times find yourself Switching between your user and administrator account as 
you struggle to get software installed or configured correctly. 
So here's the answer: 
Yes, you should use user accounts, and remain logged in under a user 
account unless you absolutely have to switch over to an administrator account 
to perform a certain task. 
But. .. 
Most of you won't use user accounts. I know this because almost everyone 
I knOW-including those who know better-use administrator accounts almost 
exclusively. I personally use administrator accounts almost exclusively.8 
So, unfortunately, this is a case where what you should do, and what you 
probably will do, are very different.9 I've pOinted out this option because you 
should know about it. But if you don't follow this advice, you'll be in good 
company. 
7 One of IT1y reviewers was wondering if using user accounts will slow do'WT1 your systelT1. No, your

Wireless Networks 
I had some friends over a few months back, and one of them brought his lap-
top. He was sitting in the living room browsing the Internet and at some point 
he looked up and said "Hey, it's great of you to provide wireless Internet 
access to visitors, but you really should add some security-anyone driving by 
can access your network." 
At which point I responded "Huh? What are you talking about?-I don't 
have wireless Internet." 
It turns out that he was accessing my next-door neighbor's network. 
Wireless Internet is becoming more and more popular-though the 
routers and network cards are a bit more expensive than the wired kind, the 
convenience of not having to run wires everywhere is a huge advantage (and 
potentially a huge cost savings). But wireless networks pose their own security 
issues that you need to be aware of. 
Wireless Risks 
The degree and type of risk you face with a wireless network depends on the 
intent of the person trying to use it. If the person driving by with their laptop 
just wants to use your network to access the Internet, little harm will occur.lO 
You might see a bit of a delay on downloads as they start using your available 
bandwidth, but chances are you won't even notice it happening. 
But here's the key thing to remember about a wireless network: That 
stranger who uses your wireless network is not just on the Internet-they are 
on your local network. What does this mean? 
• They are inside your firewall-so your router-based firewall provides 
you no protection. 11 
• If any of your drives or system resources are shared without a pass-
word, your uninvited guest will have an easy time accessing them. 
Once connected to your hard drive, they might cause damage (erasing 
or modifying HIes, or planting Trojans) or might simply steal any 
personal information you may have on your computer. 
• Remember the part about configuring routers-how I mentioned that 
you can look up your router's password in its manual because hardly 
anyone ever changes their router password? Well, on a wired network 
this poses little risk, because routers generally don't allow people to log 
10 There are people who drive around neighborhoods with a laptop looking (or these open net-
works-o "sport" called wardrlvlng. 
II Any software-based firewall installed on your computer will continue to provide protection (rom 
these visitors, as it protects you (rom other computers on your local network. This was covered in 
Chapter 5. 

Chapter 7 Locking Up, Part 2: System and Application Con~guration .II!1;j'F __ 
in from the Internet-they only accept lOgin attempts from your local 
network. But on a wireless network, your uninvited guest is on your 
local network and can thus configure your router as well. 
Protecting Your Wireless Network 
Some of the techniques you've already learned will help protect your wireless 
network. I just mentioned securing any shared drives. A software firewall on 
your system provides good protection (just as it protects your computer from 
other computers on your local network with wired networks). 
But the Single most important thing you should do on a wireless network is 
to secure it. This means you need to do the following: 
I. Change your router password. 
2. Change your SSID12_this is the name of your network. 
3. Turn on encryption. I'll tell you more about this in the next section. 
You'll need to check the documentation for your router and for your network 
cards to learn how to do these. Each one is different. However, Windows XP 
does have a standard way to configure wireless devices that I'll show you now. 
Always Use Encryption 
Encryption is a way of scrambling information so as to keep it private. I'm not 
going to spend a lot of time explaining it now-it's another one of those sub-
jects on which entire books are written. What you need to know about encryp-
tion right now is simple: The only way to read encrypted text is to have 
another piece of data called a key. A key is typically 40 bits or 128 bits. As 
long as two computers have the same key, they can both exchange encrypted 
information, and it is extremely unlikely that anyone else will be able to under-
stand that encrypted data if they were to somehow intercept it. 
To turn on encryption on your wireless network, you have to enter the same 
key into the wireless router and each computer using the network. Before trans-
mitting data, the router and computers encrypt it-so any stranger driving by 
who intercepts the Signal won't be able to figure out what it actually contains-
they just see the scrambled data. 
You'll read more about encryption in Part II of the book, because it is a 
great tool for protecting your privacy.

Modern computers can crack "O-bit encryption fairly easily.13 
Change Passwords Periodically 
It turns out there is a flaw in the current design of wireless networks with 
regards to the way they encrypt data. This makes it possible for an outsider 
listening in on your network to determine the key just by listening to the 
encrypted Signals being sent in your network. It does take time though, and 
depends on how heavily your network is used. 
'3 Rumor has it that the supercomputers o'Wned by the National Security Agency (NSA) Can read 
40-bit encrypted data as easily as unencrypted data.

This problem is a greater risk to businesses than individuals, because it 
actually requires some time and effort to break into the network-and a lot of 
network traffic to pull it off. A casual drive-by user looking for an access point 
is unlikely to take the trouble. 
However, it's a good practice to change your wireless network password 
periodically. And if you have reason to believe that someone actually wants to 
break into your network, you should change them weekly. 
Is Life Possible Without Microsoft? 
Some people love Microsoft. Some people hate them. Some people wonder 
what the fuss is all about. 
Regardless of how you feel about Microsoft, there is one clear fact: 
Microsoft Windows rules the desktop-meaning that it's on the vast major-
ity of computers run as home and school systems.14 
That means that anyone who writes a virus, Trojan, spyware, or any other 
type of malicious program will first target Microsoft software. The result is a 
race-with hackers (both good and bad) trying to find security flaws in 
Microsoft software and Microsoft racing to release security updates to block 
them. Then you racing to update your system and antivirus software before a 
virus is released that exploits that security flaw. 
It's a game-and a rather risky, time-consuming, and unpleasant one. 
But it's not the only game in town. 
You can quit. Since most viruses target Microsoft software, you can gain 
quite a measure of safety by not using Microsoft software. 
For e-mail, consider using web-based mail or e-mail clients other than 
Outlook or Outlook Express. 
For browsing the web, look at Netscape, Mozilla, or Opera. 
You can even avoid Windows entirely and go to Linux. It has the advantage 
of being free and having huge numbers of free applications available, but the 
disadvantage of still not being quite as friendly or easy to use as Windows (plus 
if you're used to Windows, it will be very unfamiliar, so you'll have a lot to 
learn in order to use it). And many of your favorite applications (especially 
games) won't run under Linux (though there are Windows emulators that can 
handle some of them). If you're curious about what Linux looks like, but don't 
want to go through the hassle of installing it on your system, you can download 
a bootable CD from http://www • knoppix. com that allows you to boot directly 
from the CD and run Linux from the CD without interfering with your 
current system. 
Of course, if large numbers of people switched to non-Microsoft software, 
the virus writers would start fOCUSing more on those products as well. But 
when and if this will occur is a question that only time will answer.

From antivirus programs, to firewalls, to system updates, to system configura-

vast majority of threats. If you follow the recommendations you've read here, 
chances are good you will never see a virus or suffer an attack. 
But there is always that "window of vulnerability"-that slight chance that 
something will get through. And of course, there is always the chance of other

Backups:The Most 
Important Thing You'll 
Probably Never Do 
Originally this chapter was going to be about what to do when you're hit with a 
virus (which is now Chapter 9). But as I was writing that chapter, I realized 
that I had missed one very important issue-even though it's not really one 
that comes to mind when you think about computer security. Everything 
you've read up until now really focuses on preventing trouble in the first 
place-because believe me, preventing an attack is infinitely easier than 
cleaning up after one occurs. And while having good backups won't protect 
your system from an attack, it can prevent a disaster from becoming truly 
devastating. 
Why Back Up Your Data? 
You already know that some viruses and Trojans like to target data on your 
hard drive, modifying it or deleting it (depending on the type of virus). 
In Chapter 6, I mentioned that disk drives sometimes crash. Well, actually 
I said that sooner or later almost every disk drive will inevitably crash. This 
means that at any time, without notice, you might lose everything you have 
stored on that drive-even if you don't get infected with a virus or Trojan that 
deletes flles. In fact, there are all sorts of things that can cause you to lose 
data-I've even seen power surges do it. l 
Most businesses have routine backup systems in place-large companies 
have people whose sole job is to perform backups and prepare for possible 
8 
I A power surge ;s a sudden increase in voltage that can damage your equipment These can be 
caused by lightning. or sudden increases or decreases in demand in your home or neighborhood. One 
of the best things you can do to protect your drive and system is to connect it to an uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS)-basically a surge protector connected to a battery that will even keep your 
computer running for a few minutes during a power outage, enough to shut down your system safely. 
Surge protectors provide some protection, but a UPS proVides really excellent protection. APe makes 
some pretty good ones-visit http://www • ape. eom for details.

disasters. Consider the example of the New York Board of Trade. They have a 
trading floor for commodities-you may have seen it in the movie Trading 
Places. On September 11, 2001, their trading floor in the World Trade Center 
was destroyed. They not only had good backups though, they had an entire 
backup trading floor that could have been up and running that evening 
(though in fact they waited for the rest of the financial markets to reopen on 
September 17th). 
On the other hand, some businesses that should have great backups don't, 
as demonstrated in this sto!), sent to me by one of my reviewers.2 
Back in March of 2003, everything was going great. Linkin Park was just 
about to release another album, and my fan site was doing quite alright.3 
Then about one week before the album was released (3125/03), I noticed my 
site was no longer loading. After checking that it was not a problem with 
my computer, I sent an e-mail to the administrator of the hosting service 
I was using at the time. I didn't get a response for about 24 hours, and I 
was wondering why this was taking so long. The next day I received an 
e-mail that said Server #2 (which is the server I was on) had suffered a 
major hard drive failure; all data had been lost. My first thought was relief-
because I had a backup of all the fIles. But then it hit me that I had never 
been able to get a backup of the MySQL database with all the user and 
membership information and forum messages-all that information was 
lost. Keeping backups is such a simple thing, and in the end will make you 
the happiest person on the planet. 
Most home users and many small businesses do not have backup systems 
in place. To be honest, most people are terrible when it comes to backups-
which is why large corporations create formal procedures and rules to make 
sure backups happen. 
So chances are pretty good your situation is something like this: 
• You haven't backed up your system recently, if ever. 
• You don't know where many of the original CDs are for the programs 
you've installed on your system. 
• You don't know where the manuals for your computer are, or where 
the original CDs are that came with your system. 
So here it is, the moment you've been waiting for. The obligato!), speech: 
You should always keep up-to-date backups of anything on your 
computer that you don't want to lose.

Chapter 8 Backups:The Most Important Thing You'" Probably Never Do 
1.1a.;,tlplotl' __ 
OK, I realize this probably won't do any good. I'm enough of a realist to 
know that despite knowledge of the risks and best intentions, most people 
don't back up their computer. So while I'll tell you about preventive backups 
here, in the next chapter I'll also talk about how to at least try to back up your 
data after a disaster has already occurred. 
But there is some good news. 
Most (but not all) teens don't have too much critical data to lose. Music 
and video files can be replaced. As for past homework assignments-you may 
be glad to see them go. You probably don't have things like tax or financial 
records that would take a huge amount of time to re-create. 
But you should at least think about it, because there might be some data 
that you may really want to keep around, like ... 
• Digital pictures you've taken and downloaded to your computer and 
already deleted from your camera 
• Any videos you've edited 
• Any other content you've created-like game mods or other software, 
or drawings, or other projects 
So do yourself a favor and make a backup of anything you don't want to 
lose. And take a few minutes and make sure you know where your original 
application and system CDs are stored. 
Oh, and here's one more bit of advice. 
Talk to your parents about backups. Because they may have some really 
important data on their disk drives and they're probably not backing up their 
data either. Do them a favor and show them how its done-they'll be a lot less 
depressed if disaster strikes. 
What About Applications? 
Your hard drive baSically holds two types of information. There are your appli-
cations-this includes the operating system and any applications you have 
installed. And there is the data-any information that you have created, 
edited, or collected that you work with. 
One of the backup choices you have is whether you want to back up your 
applications or just your data. Backing up your data can be as easy in many 
cases as copying the contents of your My Documents folder to a CD-R 
(remember to back up everyone's My Documents folder if your system has 
multiple users). 
It is also possible to back up an entire hard drive including all of the 
applications. This, of course, takes a lot more space-in most cases several 
CDs or a DVD. But it has the advantage that you can restore your system to 
a previous state without spending hours reinstalling all of your software. 

.111'11111' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Keep in mind, just copying the folder containing an application is not 
enough if you need to restore it later. Windows applications often need to be 
configured properly (including settings in the system registry). If the registry 
information isn't correct, the application won't run. 
If you use backup software to back up your entire system, it should back 
up the registry as well. 
It's up to you which approach you take (or whether you take both). If you 
don't back up your entire disk, be sure you have your original program CDs 
(and any installation or activation codes) and know where to find them. 
Backup Techniques 
Backing up consists of placing your critical data somewhere other than your 
hard drive. Common choices include 
• CD-R or CD-RW A good choice for most. CD-R drives are 
inexpensive and come on most newer systems. Plus the discs are very 
inexpensive. It may seem that they are too small (700MB or so) for 
backing up today's large hard drives, but most people don't have that 
much irreplaceable data-the big exception being any videos that 
you've edited. 
• DVD-RW or DVD+RW A good choice for those who really do need to 
back up large amounts of data. The drives and media cost more than 
CD-Rs but are rapidly coming down in price. 
• Another machine on your network: If you routinely copy your data to 
another machine on your local network, you've reduced the risk ofloss 
in case your hard drive crashes. 
• An external hard drive: These plug into a USB or IEEE 1394 
(Fire Wire) port. Maxtor (http://ww.maxtor.com) has a series called 
OneTouch that makes it easy to back up a drive. Just plug in the drive, 
insert a CD into your CD drive, press a button, and go. 
• An Internet backup service: Services such as http://ww.backup.com 
allow you to store data on a secure server in a remote location. It can 
be expensive though---especially for larger amounts of data. 
Offsite or Onsite 
Backing up your software to a CD, DVD, or another system on your network 
protects you from hard drive crashes and viruses, but it won't protect your 
information from a major disaster like a fire. Businesses address this problem 
by keeping a set of backups offsite. They might put a backup CD set or DVDs 
in a safe deposit box in a bank, or at another business location, or they might 
use one of the Internet-based backup services. 

Chapter 8 Backups:The Most Important ThingYou'l/ Probably Never Do .'a" __ _ 
This is probably overkill for most home users-if that level of misfortune 
strikes, you'll probably have a lot more on your mind than the contents of your 
computer drive. But here again, your parents might really need that informa-
tion-so you should mention it to them if you end up helping them with a 
backup plan. 
Backup Software 
There are many backup programs available, so I won't go into them here. 
If you have a CD or DVD writer, it almost certainly came with some type of 
backup software. Take a few minutes to learn to use it. 
Windows 2000 and XP come with a built-in backup program that is 
effective, but probably not as easy to use as the one that came with your 
CD or DVD writer. You can access it from the Start menu by selecting 
Accessories ~ System Tools ~ Backup command.4 
The way you are supposed to use backup programs is to first do a full 
backup of your drives, then perform an incremental daily backup. What does 
this mean? Every flle on your system has a bit of information called the 
Archive hit. When you back up a flle using a backup program, this bit is 
cleared. Any time the flle is modified, this bit is set. That way a backup 
program can tell if a flle has been changed since the last backup. In an incre-
mental backup, only those flles that have changed since the last backup are 
stored-which can save quite a bit of time on the backup. 
In practice, most people aren't going to do this. Ultimately it's your deci-
sion how often you want to back up your flles and which flles. Even if you copy 
the contents of your My Documents folder to a CD once every week or two, 
you'll be doing better than the vast majority of computer owners. 
A Simple Backup Strategy 
So far I've tried to convince you that backing up is important, and I've offered 
you a number of choices as to how to back up your software. I didn't really go 
into detail because there are so many different backup choices and software 
available that it's difficult to describe a solution that will be good for everyone. 
I encourage you to look at the backup software you have available (that comes 
with Windows or with your CD burner) and see if it's something you are com-
fortable with.5 
• Windows XP Professional also includes a feature called Au1:o,"otlc Syrte," Recovery, which 
combines a backup of your system configuration and an entire partition. Refer to your Windows XP 
help for more information on this feature. 
S My own bock up strategy, for those who are curious, is this: f keep a second system with a large hard 
drive on my local network. Once every couple of weeks I copy all of my dato files from my moin com-
puter to that system. Critical information (such os software I develop) is copied daily to a computer at 
another location. Other important information is burned onto CDs. I have numerous stories of cases 
where backups have saved me from major grief or financial loss. 

•• 
!I'E"I Part I Protecting Your Machine 
But one of my reviewers pointed out that this isn't good enough; he felt if 
I left readers to figure it out for themselves, they would end up doing nothing. 
I'm not sure this is true, or rather I fear most people will do nothing regard-
less. Nevertheless, for those of you who are looking for a really simple answer 
to the backup problem that will save most of your important information most 
of the time, here is one that can help, assuming you have a CD burner: 
I. Figure out where you are storing the fIles you care about. Many will be 
in your Document and Settingslyoumame/My Documents folder. 
Some might be in music or photo folders. Make a list of these folders. 
2. Using your CD burning program, bum the contents of those folders 
onto a CD or CD-RW 
3. Anytime you create something you really care about, copy it to a CD. 
This might be a web site, or video you've edited,6 or photos. 
4. Back up anything that is new or has changed at least once a month. 
More often is better, but only you can decide how critical your data is, 
and how much it would hurt to lose it. 
I could write a whole book on backing up (maybe someday I will). I'll add 
more information to the AlwaysUseProtection.com web site as I have the 
chance. The truth is, if you continue to use computers (which is inevitable in 
this day and age), the day will come where you will have a hard drive failure or 
other computer disaster and need your backups. So take some time and learn 
to use your backup software. You'll be glad that you did.7 
I'll talk more about backups in the next chapter, but there the story won't 
be how to back up your system to prevent disaster, but rather how to try to 
retrieve your data from a system that is already in deep trouble. 
6 If you have a file that doesn't fit on a CD. which is often the case with video, you'll have to use a 
backup program that can split files across multiple CDs. Or you can buy a DVD burner. 
7 For those looking for extra reliability. it ;s possible to odd a RAID to a computer. RAID means redun-
dant array of independent drives-it's a way of using more than one drive to store your data in a 
way that if one foils, the information can be recovered from the other (in effect. the data is written to 
multiple drives at once). Our e-mail server at work recently died a horrible death (the drive started 
making loud noises and the system crashed). Fortunately, we had a RAID Installed. We pulled out the 
bad drive. and installed a new empty drive. The system started right up with no loss of data. and pro-
ceeded to back up data to the new drive.

What to Do When 
You've Been Hit 
Reading about security can be rather depressing. You may feel, based on what 
you've read in this book so far, that your poor computer is under constant 
attack by evil forces that are out to get you. 
This is probably because your poor computer is under constant attack by 
evil forces that are out to get you. 
But there is some good news. 
If you follow all of the precautions, or even most of the precautions, you've 
read about so far-keeping an up-to-date antivirus program running at all 
times, using a firewall, and keeping your system up to date-chances are 
actually good that you'll never be infected by a virus or have your system 
penetrated by an attack from the Internet. I've been a professional software 
developer for a long time, and the only virus that (to my knowledge) has ever 
been on one of my personal systems is one that I captured intentionally for a 
talk I was doing on security.l 
I've also been exceptionally lucky and paranoid about what goes on my sys-
tem. Yet I also know that tomorrow can be the day that I make a mistake, or 
the day an attack succeeds due to some system vulnerability I have no control 
over. 
Many of you reading this book will make a mistake, or get unlucky. And 
many of your computers will get infected before you have a chance to put the 
precautions you've read about into place. Many of your computers are 
infected right now. 
And the best precautions don't do much good when you already have an 
active infection. 
This chapter is all about what to do to clean up your computer as safely as 
possible.

Introduction to Readers Who Are 
Starting Here 
For those of you who've already read the previous chapters, what you've 
learned will help you understand the instructions that follow on how to clean 
your system. So you can skip the next couple of paragraphs. 
I'd like to welcome those of you who have flipped directly to this chapter. I 
know you're out there. Maybe your computer is already infected with a virus 
and you're desperately looking for an easy solution to your problem. If so, I'll 
help you as best I can-but you won't necessarily understand everything you 
find here. I'll try to point out which chapters covered key concepts so you can 
backtrack if you get confused. 
But for those of you who think this is all you need to know-that you don't 
need to read the first eight chapters, please reconsider. When it comes to deal-
ing with viruses and Internet attacks, prevention is infinitely better than trying 
to clean up the mess afterwards. 
Some Advice Before You Start 
Before you begin cleanup, I'd like to offer some observations and suggestions 
to get you off on the right track. 
There Is No Easy Solution 
I wish I could offer you a guaranteed way to clean your system--one that will 
always work and will rescue all your data. But I can't. 
'!l IMPORTANT WARNING Anytime you're dealing with viruses or 
LL...J system repairs, you risk loss of data. The information provided here is a 
set of gUidelines that have a good chance of working on most typical home 
systems. However, because of the huge number of different viruses and possible 
system configurations, I can't guarantee that the suggestions here will work for 
your situation. In fact, they may very well make things worse. 
So consider yourself warned-whatever happens from here is at your own risk 
and your own responsibility. If you have information on your system that you 
can't afford to lose, you should call in expert help from someone who can base 
their advice and actions on your specific situations.2 
2 Rnding an expert can be a challenge also. A friend of mine recently brought her computer to a major 
computer chain to have a virus removed. They said it would be back in two days, but it took three 
weeks, cost her $160, and she ended up losing all the data and programs on her system anyway.

Check for Book Updates 
Believe it or not, I rewrote this chapter four times to get to this point, and I'm 
still not entirely happy with it. What I'd like is to be able to help every reader 
clean their system-but I know that's impossible, because every system is so 
different. I can't even include everything I know about cleaning a system, 
because the result would be a much longer and exceedingly boring book, con-
taining large sections that would only be needed by a few readers. Plus, today's 
best recommendations may not match tomorrow's. 
For that reason, I run the web site AlwaysUseProtection.com, which is 
dedicated to providing ongoing information and advice. It also includes 
updates to the book. I encourage you to visit and check for updates to this 
chapter before you continue. 
Take a Deep Breath 
I'm going to let you in on a secret. Even the most experienced computer engi-
neer faces an infected system with at least a mild degree of panic. Many times 
cleanup and system repair is easy and straightforward, but even the experts 
know that no matter how experienced you are, you may be facing a situation 
that you just can't fIx, and you may be about to lose valuable data beyond any 
hope of recovery. 
So before you start, take a deep breath, and remember these words of 
advice. 
Don't Panic 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy3 was right on this score. If you have a 
hardware problem like a disk crash, there's not much you'll be able to do about 
it-other than pay a lot of money to a disk recovery service that might be able 
to rescue some of your information. Otherwise, you may have a lot of restora-
tion to do, but if you follow the advice here, you should be able to minimize 
actual loss of data. Just try to stay calm and ... 
Be Patient 
Cleaning and restoring a system is a very slow process. Don't rush into things. 
I know you'll be tempted to just run your virus scanner and delete every 
infected HIe-but that can lead to worse problems, so it's best to prepare for 
them in advance. Read these instructions twice-read the instructions on your 
antivirus program-and then, when you've thought things through the best 
you can, don't be afraid to try things.

its cover

Be Persistent 
Cleaning and restoring a system can be frustrating. But don't give up. Tty not 
to skip any of the recommendations I offer-they are there to help you and 
are based on harsh experience.4 Read them carefully-I've kept them short 
and evety sentence counts. And don't be afraid to ask for help-you can 
probably find a friend who can answer your questions and get you over the 
rough spots. 
Don't Read This Chapter 
Unlike most of the other chapters in this book, this chapter isn't meant to be 
read from start to finish. It's more like one of those "choose your own adventure" 
books you may have read as a kid. You'll begin by evaluating the current state of 
your system, and then read and perform only the tasks that are needed for your 
situation. If you're lucky, you'll never need to read most of this chapter! 
Ready to start? Here we go. 
The Three Steps to Cleaning Your System 
Regardless of the current state of your system-whether you're doing a rou-
tine virus scan or trying to rescue a system that won't even boot-the job 
divides into three parts: 
I. Decide what information on your disk you don't want to lose, and tty to 
rescue it. 
2. Prepare for the virus scan, and then do it. 
3. Clean up the mess that's left afterwards. 
Sounds easy, doesn't it? 
If only it were so. 
The actual job of cleaning your system may involve a variety of tasks. Later 
in this chapter, you'll see a section named "The Task List," which goes into 
detail on how to do the follOwing tasks. (Don't do them now! Think of this as a 
preview.) 
~ Prepare for a Scan or Update: What to do before you scan your 
system or do a system update. 
~ Update Your Restore Tools and Infonnation: Preparing 
information that can help you rescue your system in case of disaster. 
~ Disconnect from the Net: When you need to get off the Net, fast.

~ Rescue What Data You Can: This is your last chance to rescue data 
before you risk lOSing it all. 
~ Do a Full Virus Scan: Here's where you do the scan itself. 
~ Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt: A way you may be 
able to use your system even when Windows won't start. 
~ Boot from CD: Another way you may be able to use your system 
when Windows won't start, and a first step to restoring a system. 
~ Try to Repair Windows: Sometimes you can actually repair your 
operating system. 
~ Finish Up a Repair or Installation: Things to do after a system 
repair or installation. 
~ Install a Second Operating System: A technique that can be used 
on some systems to rescue data. 
~ Reinstall Your Operating System: A technique that can sometimes 
repair an operating system. 
~ Restore and Start Over: What you do when all is lost and it's time to 
start fresh. 
Those are the tasks. You'll find that some are quite easy, and some com-
plex. And there are a lot of them, which is why this chapter is long. But don't 
worry--chances are you'll never have to perform all of these tasks, and you 
don't need to read about a task until you actually need it. 
How Is Your System? 
Your first challenge is to figure out which tasks you need to do. What follows 
is a list of possible problems. Once you've found the one that best describes 
your situation, follow the instructions and perform the tasks described for 
that situation. 
So to begin, I'd like you to answer the question: How is your system? 
I'm not seeing any problems (I think ... ). It just felt like time to do 
a routine scan. 
My antivirus program, while running in the background, just found 
a virus or Trojan! 
My computer has been acting strangely. This can include anything 
from slower performance, to applications that no longer run, to sudden 
system crashes. 
I've been hacked! You have evidence that someone is on your system 
right now!

'1&:':,,' Part I ProteaingYour Machine 
it Windows is broken! This can include everything from built-in 
applications not working to Windows not even starting. This may be 
the result of a failed system update as well as a virus. 
* My antivirus software won't run. This can include being unable to 
install or upgrade antivirus software, or being unable to run the 
antivirus software. 
I turned my computer on, sparks flew out of the power supply, the disk 
drive is making a loud squealing noise, and I smell smoke. 
Next, we're going to look at each one of these in detail. For each one, 
you'll get a list of tasks to do. 
~ I'm Not Seeing Any Problems (I Think ... ) 
Good for you. The antivirus program that you have running at all times 
provides good protection, but everyone should do a full virus scan periodically 
anyway.5 
The tasks you should perform are as follows (look at the section "The Task 
List" for detailed instructions for tasks where noted): 
• Prepare for a Scan or Update (see "The Task List"). 
• Close all other applications. 
• Have your antivirus software scan all of the drives on your system. Have 
it check all files and within compressed files6 (this can take a while). 
If the full virus scan doesn't detect a virus, you're done. Your system is 
almost certainly clean. 
Otherwise, your antivirus program will display a list of files, and for each 
one ask you if it should clean the file, delete the file (if it can't be cleaned), or 
just ignore the file. 
What you do here depends on the type of file. 
If the antivirus program asks you to 
delete a system file, you should say NO. 
What's going on here? 
If you delete system files, your system may stop working. So rather than 
allow the antivirus program to delete those files, you should close the antivirus 
program, and perform the instructions in the section called "My Computer 
Has Been Acting Strangely."

~ I NOTE A system file is a file with the extension .exe, .dll, .OCX, .sys, or 
/'J 
.drv that is located in your root directory, or your Windows or WinNT 
directories (or any of their subdirectories-especially those named System or 
System32). For example, \windows\system\gdi32.dll would be a system file. It is, 
however, safe to delete any files with the extension .tmp, or located in a 
subdirectory containing the word Temp or Temporary. Any file that can't be 
deleted when you try to delete it is probably also a system file. 
~ My Antivirus Program, While Running in the Background, 
Just Found a Virus orTrojan! 
First of all, congratulations-because you have an up-to-date antivirus pro-
gram doing active scanning on your computer, you've probably just saved 
yourself from a serious infection. 
If you're lucky, the warning will appear the very first time the file is being 
created. In those cases, the antivirus program will almost always be able to 
clean or delete the file before it's even saved on your system. \\'hen this hap-
pens, you should check to see if the file is a system file (see the note in the 
previous section for information on system files). 
If it's not a system file, go ahead and clean or delete it as prompted by your 
antivirus program (it may go ahead and do so automatically). 
If you don't see any more virus warnings within the next few minutes, you 
should be OK. I do recommend you do a routine virus scan as soon as you 
have time. That's it-you're done. 
If you're unlucky, the warning will be your first indication of a major infec-
tion. This will happen if your antivirus program has just been updated and 
suddenly has the information needed to detect a virus already on your system 
(a virus that was installed during the window of vulnerability described in 
Chapter 4). You'll know this is the case if the infected file was a system file, or 
if you suddenly get a series of virus warnings. 
If you do have a major infection, your next step is to perform the instruc-
tions in the section called "My Computer Has Been Acting Strangely." 
~ My Computer Has Been Acting Strangely 
If you've reached this section, either you suspect you may have a virus or your 
antivirus software has detected a virus (and you've been directed here from 
one of the other sections of this book). 
Your first thought will be to go ahead and just do a full virus scan. But if 
your system is really infected, the cleanup process could cause problems. 
Therefore, the tasks you should perform are as follows (look at the section 
"The Task List" for detailed instructions for tasks where noted): 
• Rescue What Data You Can (see "The Task List"). 
• Prepare for a Scan or Update (see "The Task List"). 
• Do a Full Virus Scan (see "The Task List"). 

__ II';a:J'.' Part I Protecting Your Machine 
This time, when you do the full virus scan, allow the scanner to repair or 
delete system fIles if it finds they are infected. They do need to be cleaned, 
and you've already taken steps to prepare to restore your system if necessary. 
By the time you're done with this task, your system will either be clean, or 
you'll be going back to the earlier question, "How is your system?", with your 
computer in the same or worse condition than it was when you started.7 
If your system is clean and seems to be operating normally, you should 
perform this task: 
• Update Your Restore Tools and Information (see "The Task lisf'). 
~ I've Been Hacked! Someone Is on My System Right Now! 
The first sign you may have a Trojan will probably be a warning from your 
antivirus program. That's because more than viruses and worms, Trojans try to 
hide their presence. After all, the whole point of a Trojan is for someone to be 
able to either hijack your computer for their own purposes, or steal your infor-
mation. 
However, Trojans can also be used for threats, extortion, and blackmail, so 
you can actually find yourself conversing in windows similar to instant message 
windows with the person who has access to your system. 
The tasks you should perform are as follows (look at the section "The Task 
list" for detailed instructions for tasks where noted): 
• Disconnect from the Net (see "The Task list"). 
• Rescue What Data You Can (see "The Task list"). 
• Prepare for a Scan or Update (see "The Task lisf'). 
• Do a Full Virus Scan (see "The Task list"). 
By the time you're done with this task, your system will either be clean, or 
you'll be going back to the earlier question, "How is your system?", with your 
computer in the same or worse condition than it was when you started. 
If there are still indications of a Trojan after a full scan has reported a clean 
system, you might want to try a different antivirus program. 
If your system is clean and seems to be operating normally, you should 
perform this task: 
• Update Your Restore Tools and Information (see "The Task list").

~ Windows Is Brokenl 
If you've reached this section, whether just a few of your applications don't 
work, or your computer doesn't even start, you're going to have to do some 
repair work as well. 
How you proceed depends on how broken8 Windows is. 
If Your Monitor Is Blank ... 
Make sure your computer and monitor are plugged in and turned on, and all 
cables are properly connected.9 If your monitor remains blank, you may have a 
hardware problem-which is unfortunately beyond the scope of this book. 
You'll need to contact your computer manufacturer, appropriate repair service, 
or deal with it in whatever manner you prefer. 
Your First Step As Always ..• 
If you haven't done so already, do this task: 
• Rescue What Data You Can (see "The Task List"). 
If It's Just One or Two Applications That Aren't Part of Windows That 
Don'tWork ••. 
Sometimes after a virus scan you'll find that one or more applications are bro-
ken. This often happens when one of the flies they need was deleted because 
it was infected. 
In many cases, you can repair an application by reinstalling it. Go to the 
Control Panel, and select AddlRemove Programs. Some programs will have an 
option to add or remove features and maybe even do an automatic repair. In 
other cases, you can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the program. 
If Windows Is Still Broken ... 
If you did the Rescue What Data You Can task, you may have already per-
formed a number of system repair tasks that allowed you to do the backup. 
But if you're still having trouble--either Windows applications don't run or 
Windows won't start-try doing these tasks: 
• Try to Repair Windows (see "The Task List"). 
If that works, continue to these tasks: 
• Prepare for a Scan or Update (see "The Task List"). 
• Do a Full Virus Scan (see "The Task List").

If You Can't Repair Windows ••. 
If you've tried everything in the Try to Repair Windows task and nothing 
works, you may have no choice but to just start over with a clean system. 
Remember that even at this point, an expert can probably still rescue data 
from your hard drive. So don't take this step unless you really can afford to 
lose everything on your hard drive-because if you continue, that defInitely 
will happen. To start over, do this task:

tlvlrus Soft" 
Run! 
As you learned in Chapter 4, some viruses specmcally target antivirus pro-
grams and try to prevent them from running. Unfortunately, those programs 
also usually disable other programs you could use to clean your system manu-
ally (like the registry editor program). 
Here are some things you can try that will hopefully allow you to install, 
update, and run your antivirus software: 
• Rescue What Data You Can (see "The Task List"). This is a routine 
fIrst step to any risky operation on your system. 
• Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt (see "The Task 
List"). Boot into Safe mode and try the operation. 
• Visit your antivirus software web site. Antivirus software vendors have 
support FAQ sections on their web sites that might be able to help. 
• Try uninstalling and reinstalling your antivirus software. This works 
best when the problem is a virus that is infecting your antivirus 
software HIes. It's less effective on viruses that specmcally target 
antivirus software. 
• Remove unfamiliar programs from your Startup program group. These 
are programs that start every time you start Windows, and some viruses 
place themselves in this group. To remove them, right-click your Start 
menu and sele,ct Open (the fIrst time), and then Open All Users (the 
second time). Click Programs and then click Startup. You should 
recognize every program listed as one you installed. If any are unfamiliar, 
delete them or drag them into a temporary directory (from which you 
can restore them later if you want). 
• Examine programs in your registry. The registry has an additional place 
where viruses install themselves to run on startup. This is an advanced 
technique covered in Appendix B that can allow you to manually 
prevent some viruses from starting. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit .I&;"~_ 
• Install a Second Operating System (see "The Task List"). This will 
almost always work, in that the second operating system will be clean 
and able to detect and delete the infected flIes on the other operating 
system's partition . 
• Reinstall Your Operating System (see "The Task List"). This may 
disable the virus enough to allow your antivirus program to run. 
If none of these work, you may end up with little choice but to start clean 
with the Restore and Start Over task in "The Task List."

unfortunate victim of this type of problem, this book can't help you.

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Prepare for a Scan or Update 
Before you start a virus scan or a system update (especially one that involves 
installing a full service pack), there are a number of things you should do if 
possible. 12 
• Back up any critical data (see Chapter 8 and the Rescue What Data 
You Can task in "The Task List"). 
• Be sure your antivirus program is up to date (see Chapter 4). 
• Be sure you have a firewall in place and active (see Chapter 5). 
• Find your original operating system CD, and installation CDs for your 
applications (along with installation keys). 13 
Update Your Restore Tools and Information 
Each version of Windows allows you to prepare for disaster. The problem is, 
it's important that these tasks be done when a system is in a clean and known 
good condition. By the time you're infected, it's too late. For example, if you 
set a system restore point in XP on an infected system and then clean the sys-
tem, going back to the restore point can actually make things worse! 
• For Windows 95/98/ME: Be sure you have a Windows startup disk. 
Create a startup disk by bringing up the Control Panel, chOOSing 
AddlRemove Programs, selecting the Startup Disk tab, and clicking the 
Create Disk button-then follow the directions. 
• For Windows 2000: Be sure you have a recent emergency rescue disk. 
Create a rescue disk by going to the Start menu, choosing Program ~ 
Accessories ~ System Tools ~ Backup, and then clicking the 
Emergency Repair Disk button. If you're on a machine that doesn't 
have a floppy drive, you should still do this, just be sure you check the 
box labeled "Also back up registry to the repair directory". The floppy 
backup will fail, but you'll have a backup of the registry on your hard 
drive. 
• For Windows XP: Define a system restore point by going to the Start 
menu, choosing Program ~ Accessories ~ System Tools ~ System 
Restore, and follOwing the directions to create a new system restore 
point. Windows XP Professional also includes a feature called 
12 Depending on the state of your system, one or more of these may not be possible. Do the best 
you can. 
13 I realize that this one is hard and may not be possible for everyone. Do your best. The good news is 
that after you've done it once, you shouldn't have to do it again--ju$t remember where everything is. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit 
Automatic System Recovery, which can restore your system from a set 
point. Refer to your online documentation for this feature-it won't be 
covered in this book. 
Disconnect from the Net 
Viruses and worms connect to the Internet or your local network to spread 
themselves. Trojans work to let outsiders into your computer. But neither of 
them can reach the Internet if your computer is physically disconnected from 
the Internet. 
• If you're on a dial-up connection using a modem, unplug the phone 
line from the modem. If a phone line plugs directly into your 
computer, the part of your computer it's plugged into is the modem . 
• If you're connected to a router, or to a DSL or cable modem, unplug 
the network cable. 
You may need to reconnect in order to download antivirus software or fire-
wall software. If instructed to do so, reconnect to the Net long enough to per-
form the download, then unplug it again until your system is clean.14 
Rescue What Data You Can 
Chapter 8 discussed backing up data, but its focus was on routine backup-the 
kind that can save your data if you get into trouble. 
If you're reading this task, it's because you're already in trouble and have 
data on your hard drive that you want to back up if at all possible. The tech-
niques themselves are covered in Chapter 8. This task focuses on the strategy 
you should take. 
If Your System Can Boot to the Windows Desktop . .. 
First you need to identify the HIes that you want to back up. In most cases, 
your data will be in the My Documents folder, but some applications may 
store information in different directories. You yourself may have organized 
your system to store data in other places. 
If you don't have too much data, you might be able to copy it to a floppy 
disk. 
14 If you don't already have a firewall, definitely try to install one before you reconnect to the Internet 
However, don't be surprised ifit isn't much help. Some Trojans call "out"w the Internet, meaning your 
router provides no protection once your system is infected. Others can disable software firewalls. 

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
If your CD burning program works, you should be able to store your data 
onto aCD. 
In either case, mark the floppy or CD to indicate that it may have infected 
fIles. 
Later, if you do have to restore from the floppy or CD, be sure to copy the 
fIles to a temporary directOly15 and perform a virus scan on that directory 
before you place the fIles where they belong. Then, if any viruses were found, 
throw out or erase the floppy or CD. 16 
Network Backup 
If your computer is on a local network, and you can share drives so they can 
be seen by another system, you can copy the files temporarily to that system if 
it has enough disk space. 
This approach means reconnecting your network cable if it has been 
disconnected, so you should unplug your router from the Internet before 
proceeding. 
First make sure the other system is clean, updated, and has an active 
antivirus program.17 Be sure the other system isn't sharing any of its drives, 
and has passwords assigned to its user accounts (this is to prevent your system 
from attacking the other system). Share the drive on your system. From the 
clean system, copy the fIles across the network from your system to a directory 
on the other system. You should always share from the infected system and do 
the copy operation on the clean system because if you do it the other way 
around, your infected system may proceed to infect the clean system. Be 
sure to label the directory so you know it may contain infected fIles-give it a 
name like "Possibly Infected Files". And don't run any of the programs in that 
directory! 
During the copy process, the clean system may detect and clean viruses on 
incoming fIles. But you should do a scan of those files anyway once they are 
copied. 
fYour System Can't Boot to the Windows Desktop .. ~ 
Try to boot to Safe mode (see the task Boot into Safe Mode or the 
Command Prompt in "The Task List"). 
If it succeeds, try to use one of the backup techniques described in the 
previous section.

Consider Calling for Expert Help 
There are a number of other things that a Windows expert can do to rescue 
your data that depends on your particular system. I simply don't have space 
here to cover them (one could write an entire book on rescuing Windows 
systems-maybe someday I will). 
So if you have valuable data, this would be a good time to call for help if 
you haven't already. 
If All Else Fails . .. 
If your system can't boot, or you're unable to make a backup using the tech-
niques described, all isn't lost. You can try both of the follOwing tasks which, if 
successful, will allow you to back up your existing files in most cases: 
• Try to Repair Windows (see "The Task List") . 
• Install a Second Operating System (see "The Task List"). 
Do a Full Virus Scan 
Hopefully this is just a routine virus scan, or you're doing a scan to confirm 
that your system is clean after your virus scanner caught one using active scan-
ning. If not, best of luck-and I hope you've followed the recommendations 
for backing up your system and preparing for the worst. 
Doing a full virus scan involves the follOwing steps: 
I. Update your antivirus software. Even automatically updating software 
prOvides an option to request an immediate check for updates. If you 
were instructed earlier to disconnect your computer from the Internet, 
you may need to temporarily reconnect in order to perform the update. 
It's worth the risk because scanning with obsolete antivirus software is 
next to useless. 
2. Close all other applications. 
3. Have your antivirus software scan all of the drives on your system. 
Have it check all files and within compressed files (this can take a 
while). If your antivirus software won't work, go back to the "How Is 
Your System?" section and follow the instructions listed under "My 
Antivirus Software Won't Run!" 

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
4. If no viruses were found, you're done. Congratulations, you almost 
certainly have a clean system! Update your system restore information 
by going to the Update Your Restore Tools and Information task in 
"The Task List" to prepare you for next time. 
5. Follow the recommendation of the antivirus program to clean or delete 
each infected fIle that was found. Make a note if any of the infected 
fIles were within a compressed fIle. Make a note if the antivirus 
program was unable to delete an infected fIle (write down the name 
of the fIle and the virus that was detected). 
6. Finish all of the fIles. 
7. If the antivirus program was unable to delete an infected fIle, reboot 
your system. Then go back to step 2 and continue from there. The only 
difference is, if no infected fIles were found in a compressed fIle, you 
can safely skip future scans of compressed fIles. That will save time 
(see Chapter 4 for details of types of scans). 
8. If your third scan still shows viruses, go to the web site of your antivirus 
program and see if they have any further information or specialized 
cleanup tools for the virus that was identified. (You did write down the 
name of the fIle and virus earlier, right?) 
9. If your fourth scan still shows an infection (which is highly unlikely), 
you have an extremely active infection that has probably also infected 
your antivirus program. Try uninstalling and then reinstalling your 
antivirus program (remember to download any updates if you've 
reinstalled the antivirus program from a CD). You might also consider 
trying a different antivirus program at this pOint-perhaps a free scan 
or trial period of a different program that might work better against the 
virus you have. I8 
I o. If your fifth scan still shows an infection, try booting your system in 
Safe mode and scanning in that mode (See the task Boot into Safe 
Mode or the Command Prompt in "The Task List"). 
II. If you're unable to clean the system after a couple more attempts, call 
your antivirus program manufacturer for help.19 
Soot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt 
Each version of Windows has a special startup mode called Safe mode. Safe 
mode is a special mode in which many Windows features and components are 
18 Normally you wouldn't have more than one virus scanner installed on your system at once, but at 
this point things are getting a bit desperate. Just remember to uninstall the one you won't be using 
when you're done. 
19 This is a last resort, because antivirus support generally involves either costly phone calls or endless 
waits. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit 
disabled. This allows your system to boot in cases where one of those features 
and components are causing you trouble. 
When you boot into Safe mode, you'll get a menu of boot options you can 
try. Don't be afraid to try different options in your effort to get your system to 
boot-it shouldn't do any harm. Two of the options include regular Safe mode 
and Safe mode with network access. Only choose network access if you really 
need to access your network (say, to do a network backup). 
The console is a DOS-style command window that lets you enter com-
mands that can help you rescue your system. It's sometimes called the 
Recovery Console. 
If you would like to learn more about using the Recovery Console, go to 
http://www.microsoft.comand type Recovery Console into the search win-
dow. You can also try searching for "Recovery Console" on Google. 
Some of the commands you'll learn about are 
• ChkDsk: Attempts to repair your file system (Windows 20001XP) 
• Copy: Copies a flle from one location to another 
• Dir: Lets you view a list of flles in a directory 
• FixBoot and FixMBR: Can fix your boot sector and master boot record 
• ScanDisk: Attempts to repair your flle system (Windows 95/98/ME) 
Also check AlwaysUseProtection.com for updates.2o 
Alternate Boot on Windows 9S/98/ME 
If you get an invalid boot or missing system error when booting, you need to 
repair your operating system as described in the Try to Repair Windows task 
in "The Task List." 
After restarting your system, hold the Ctrl key down. You should see a 
Safe mode prompt. If not, try pressing the F8 key while Windows 98 or ME 
is starting. If you press it in time, you'll get the Safe mode menu. 
Choose the Safe mode option to boot into Safe mode. 
Choose "Command prompt only" to enter the console (DOS window), or if 
that fails, choose "Safe mode command prompt only". 
Alternate Boot on Windows 2000 and Windows XP 
There are two ways to boot into Windows 2000 and Windows XP: You can 
boot from disk or from your operating system CD. 
20 Those of you familiar with DOS or command-line programming will find the Recovery Console 
familiar and easy to use. The rest of you will have more difficulty. Unfortunately, this is another of 
those subjects that deserves an entire book to itself. and space doesn't permit me to include more 
here. I'll be adding further information to the web site as I have the chance. 

Port I Protecting Your Machine 
Alternate Boot from Disk 
If you can't boot from disk, you'll have to boot from CD. 
When the Windows 2000 or Windows XP initial startup screen appears, 
you'll see this line at the bottom of the screen: 
For Advanced Troubleshooting and Advanced Starutp Options for Windows 
Press F8. 
Press F8 and you'll see a number of options including Safe mode, Safe 
Mode with Networking, and Safe Mode with Command Prompt. Choose the 
one you need. 
Alternate Boot from CD 
Place your operating system disc in the CD drive and boot from CD (see the 
Boot from CD task in "The Task List"). 
You'll be able to choose between repairing an existing version of the oper-
ating system or setting up the operating system. Choose the repairing option 
to get to the Recovery Console (which provides a command prompt) and other 
advanced recovery options. 
Boot from CD 
If you have Windows 95/98/ME, you can boot from a set of startup floppy 
disks that you create using the techniques described in the Update Your 
Restore Tools and Information task in "The Task List." You'll boot from a 
Windows 95/98/ME CD to reinstall Windows (see the Reinstall Your 
Operating System task in "The Task List"). 
If you have a Windows operating system CD, you can, boot from the CD 
on most systems. You may have to configure your BIOS21 to enable this fea-
ture--check your computer configuration documentation for details on how to 
do this. Only original Microsoft operating system CDs are likely to boot (the 
CD will be by Microsoft, and have the name of your operating system on it). If 
you have an MSDN CD (a different way they distribute operating systems) or 
a system restore CD, you won't be able to boot from CD to enter Safe mode 
or the command prompt, or to install a second operating system.22 
Try to Repair Windows 
There are two approaches to repairing an operating system: One is to find an 
expert, the other to do it yourself. 
2 I When you turn on your system, you'll usually see a brief display along the lines of "Press F I to enter 
system setup." System setup is where you configure your BIOS. 
22 Some of these CDs do have a way to create a set of boot floppies, but that is a subject beyond the 
scope of this book. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit 
If you're trying to restore an operating system in order to back up critical 
information, you should definitely find an expert. There are things an expert 
can do to try to repair a system that I can't possibly cover here.23 
I'll describe here two approaches to repairing a system that will work much 
of the time, but there are no guarantees. 
If Your Computer Boots to the Windows Startup Screen, 
but Fails to Start Completely ... 
When this occurs, it means that your system is booting up, but there is a prob-
lem with the Windows installation itself. You may have a configuration error, 
or a missing or corrupt file. Typical symptoms include the system completely 
freezing (be sure you wait a long time before you decide the system is frozen), 
or a blue screen full of cryptic text that looks like it's right out of The Matrix. 
This latter screen is called the blue screen of death.24 
The first thing to try if you're in this situation is to boot into Safe mode. 
See the Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt task in "The Task 
List." 
If you can boot into Safe mode, go ahead and try to back up any files you 
care about and do a virus scan before you continue with the repair process. 
Try an Automatic Restore 
If you're using Windows 2000 or XP, it's possible you can restore your system 
to a previous known good configuration. Choose the Last Known Good 
Configuration option on the Boot menu. If it boots successfully, shut down 
and try a normal boot. If it works, you're done-return to the scenario that 
you were working on. 
Try a Chkdsk or Scan Disk 
The ScanDisk command (Windows 95/98/ME) or Chkdsk command 
(Windows 20001XP) can repair some file system problems that can cause a 
boot to fail. To run these programs, boot to the command prompt (see the 
Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt task in "The Task List"). 
Then use the ScanDisk command (for Windows 95/98/ME), or the 
ChkdsklF command (Windows 20001XP). 
Try the Recovery Process (Windows 20001XP) 
Even though you can boot to the startup window, Windows 2000 and XP pro-
vide additional recovery options when booting from CD. 
Try the sequence of operations that appears in the section titled "If Your 
Computer Fails to Boot Before You See the Startup Screen." 
23 There are probably things an expert can do that I don't know how to dcr-<Jnd I have a lot of expe-
rience at this kind of thing. 
24 That isn't Microsoft's official name for this phenomenon, but every Windows expert I know of 
understands the term and uses it 

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
Last Resorts 
Your next step will probably be to try reinstalling your operating system as 
described in the Reinstall Your Operating System task in "The Task List." 
If this fails, you should either call in an expert, or go on to your last resort, 
the Restore and Start Over task in "The Task List." 
If Your Computer Fails to Boot Before You See the 
Startup Screen . .. 
If you see a message that your disk is unbootable, or an error occurs with 
NTLDR,25 you obviously have serious troubles. You may have a corrupt or 
infected boot sector, a scrambled partition table, or a wiped disk.26 
The first thing you should do, however, is make sure there are no CDs or 
floppy disks in your computer. You wouldn't want to start repairing your hard 
drive because your computer is failing a floppy or CD boot! 
Windows 9S/98/ME 
Hopefully you have a set of startup disks you created earlier (see the Update 
Your Restore Tools and Information task in "The Task List"). Boot from 
these disks-this will bring you to the command prompt. 
Try running the ScanDisk program. This can repair many problems. 
If1 CAUTIO~ Don't perform the following step if you have more than 
lLJ one operating system on your computer! 
If your system still won't boot, try using this command: Sys C:. 
This will repair the boot record of your hard drive. But if you have both 
Windows 95/98/ME and Windows 20001XP on your system, it will make it 
impossible to boot to Windows 20001XP. 
If neither of these tasks work, your next step will probably be to try rein-
stalling your operating system as described in the Reinstall Your Operating 
System task in "The Task List." 
If that fails, you should either call in an expert, or go on to your last resort: 
the Restore and Start Over task in "The Task List." 
Windows lOOOIXP 
If you have an actual operating system CD, boot from the CD as described in 
the Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt task in "The Task 
List." If you have multiple operating systems on your computer, use the CD 
2S NTLDR is one of the files used for a Windows 1000 or XP startup. A corrupt, missing, or incorrect 
NTLDR file will cause an error message to display that says that your NTLDR ;s bad. 
26 You may not know what all of these things mean, but you don't really need to at this point After all, 
they all sound suitably intimidating and depressing. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit 
for the version of the operating system you're repairing. However, be aware 
that a Windows 2000 repair may prevent XP from booting, so you'll have to 
repair it afterwards as well. 
Emergency Repair Process (Windows 2000 Only) When booting, 
choose the option to repair an existing installation of Windows. 
You'll be given two choices: to repair using the Recovery Console, or to 
repair using the emergency repair process. Choose the emergency repair 
process. 
You can choose automatic or manual repair. 
If you have a recent emergency repair floppy disk, the automatic (fast) 
repair is your best bet. Otherwise, choose manual and don't restore the reg-
istry. 
If the automated repair process updates your registry from older informa-
tion (either on disk or from an older emergency repair floppy disk), you could 
lose recent application settings. In that case, you may need to reinstall those 
applications. 
Emergency Repair Process (Windows XP Only) When booting, choose 
the option to set up Windows XP. 
After agreeing to the license agreement, you'll be shown a list of all exist-
ing XP installations and given the option to repair an installation or install a 
new copy of Windows. Choose to repair the installation. 
Recovery Console The Recovery Console is similar to the Command 
Prompt. It features a number of commands an expert can use to do a variety of 
repairs. The ones you're most likely to use are the following commands: 
• ChkDsk: Can repair some flle system problems 
• FixBoot: Reinstalls your main system boot record 
• FixMBR: Repairs the master boot record for the boot partition 
After the Repair 
Once you've completed a successful repair, do the Finish Up a Repair or 
Installation task. 
Finish Up a Repair or Installation 
Part of the repair process may include copying flles from your operating sys-
tem CD to your computer. Unfortunately, these flles don't contain the latest 
bug fIxes. Therefore, it's important to do a system update after a repair. 
To learn how to update your system, read Chapter 6. 

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
This leads to an interesting question: What if you had to repair your system 
after a system update? Won't the update cause the problem to occur again? 
Won't this bring you to a loop-where you install an update, then repair, then 
install the update, then repair, and so on for all eternity? 
Well, hopefully the repair process fIxed or removed whatever strange prob-
lem caused the fIrst update to fail. But yes, I suppose this kind of loop is possi-
ble. If it happens, all I can suggest is backing up your system and doing a 
complete system installation as described in the Restore and Start Over task 
in "The Task List." Chances are your update failed because of some other 
application you had on your system, and a completely clean installation will 
solve that problem. However, I make no promises. 
Finally, when your system is fully installed, updated, and repaired, be sure 
to do the Update Your Restore Tools and Infonnation task in "The Task 
List." 
Install a Second Operating System 
If you have more than one partition27 on your system, or a second disk drive, 
there is another approach you can take to rescue your data-one that will work 
even if your operating system won't boot. 
H your computer is running Windows 2000 or XP,28 and came with a 
Windows operating system disk, you can actually install a second operating 
system on your system on the other partition or drive if it has enough space. 
This second operating system will be completely independent of the other-
it won't share any applications, registry settings, and so on, which means that it 
will be clean when you install it. And it will remain clean as long as you don't 
execute any infected flies. 
Don't worry yet about updating or confIguring this second operating 
system-if things go well, you'll be able to delete it. 
To install a second operating system, do the follOwing tasks.29 
• Disconnect from the Net (see "The Task List"). 
• Boot from CD (see "The Task List"). 
• The installation program will at some point ask you if you want to 
repair an existing copy of the operating system, or set up your 
operating system now. You'll choose the setup option. 
27 You can divide a disk drive into multiple partitions-each of which has ;rs own drive letter. For 
example, you can have drive C, D, and E on one physical hard drive. You can use the program 
PartitionMagic (see http://www.powerquest.com) to divide an existing partition into multiple parti-
tions, but do use caution and make backups before you try to do so. 
28 You can install Windows 2000 or XP as a second operating system even if your first operating 
system is Windows 95/98 or M£ 
29 Unfortunately. here again is an example of a situation where not only is each version of Windows 
different, but there are all sorts of potential situations that can come up that I can't cover here. So 
the instructions here are simple, and will work on many systems, but not all. 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit IIIII 
• After agreeing to a long license agreement, the installation program 
will search for existing copies of Windows, and ask you if you wish to 
upgrade an existing system or install a new copy of the operating 
system. Choose the new copy and when prompted, choose a partition 
that doesn't yet have an operating system.30 When asked whether to 
format the partition or leave it as is, you should leave the 
partition as is. 
From here you should be able to follow the prompts to fully install the new 
operating system. After installing the new operating system, when you reboot 
your machine you'll be given a choice as to which operating system to boot. 
Your latest installed operating system will be the default.31 
Warning! If you need to install any software from the Internet, or are con-
nected to the Internet, be sure to install a firewall first! Remember-this new 
operating system isn't updated and will be vulnerable to external attack. 
After you install the operating system, you can install antivirus software to 
scan all of your available drives, or install your CD burning software in order 
to make backups. 
~ 
CAUTION Don't run any of the programs that were not installed 
lLJ with the new operating system-the last thing you want to do is infect 
your newly installed system. Remember to use your antivirus software to clean 
all of your drives before you start using this system. 
If you wish to continue to use this second operating system, be sure to 
update your system as described in Chapter 6. 
If you decide to delete this operating system, boot to your main operating 
system, browse to the partition on which you installed the new operating 
system, and delete the contents of the follOwing directories: \Windows or 
\WinNT, Program Files, and Documents and Settings. Then delete the 
pagefile.sys file on that partition's root directory. 
Operating System vs. System Restores 
Computer vendors use three approaches to allow you to restore your system in 
case of this kind of trouble. 
3 0 In most cases, you only have one operating system on the first partition of the first drive. Therefore 
you can install Windows on any other partition. 
31 You can change the default operating system by going to the Control Panel. System menu, then 
selecting the Advanced tab and clicking the Startup and Recovery button. 

Part I Protecting Your Machine 
• Some manufacturers provide all of the individual applications and an 
original Windows operating system CD. This is most common for 
custom computers from smaller manufacturers. It's also common for 
people who build their own machines. In this case, you have the actual 
Windows CD and can install the second operating system from that CD. 
• Some manufacturers provide a separate system recovery CD. 
Unfortunately, the system recovery process they use typically restores 
the system to exactly the state it was when you bought it, deleting all of 
your data fIles in the process. So these CDs are generally not useful for 
the second operating system approach. 
• Some manufacturers place the system recovery data on a hidden 
partition on your hard drive. While useful for rescuing your system 
from software problems, this approach is useless for disk crashes-
because a disk crash will destroy the hidden partition as well. Restoring 
from a hidden partition will typically also delete any of your data. 
So what do you do if all you have is a vendor's system restore CD set or 
partition that will destroy your data? Ultimately you have two choices: 
• Don't use the second operating system approach. 
• Obtain another operating system CD that you can use to install the 
second operating system. 
One important pOint: If your system has Windows 95/98/ME or Windows 
2000, the second operating system you install can be Windows 2000 or 
WindowsXP. 
However, if your system currently has Windows XP, you must install 
Windows XP as your second operating system.32 
Errors during installation of a second operating system may indicate a 
hardware problem. 
Reinstall Your Operating System 
One nice thing about all versions of Windows is that normally if you reinstall 
your operating system over an existing copy, it will preserve your previous set-
tings (including all personal information, desktop settings, and installed appli-
cations) while at the same time fixing many types of problems. 
32 Installing Windows 2000 a~er Windows XP will cause your XP system to fail to boot In that case, 
you'll need to repair your XP system in order to use it 

Chapter 9 What to Do When You've Been Hit 
Windows 95/98/ME 
Warning-attempting to reinstall Windows 95/98/ME on a system that 
includes other operating systems will cause those systems to fail to boot. 
You'll need to repair those systems as well (at least updating the boot using 
the FixBoot and FixMBR utilities from the Recovery Console). 
Boot from CD as described in the Booting from CD task (see "The 
Task List"). 
Follow the installation instructions to reinstall your Windows operating 
system. 
Windows 2000/XP 
If you have an actual operating system CD, boot from the CD as described in 
the Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt task in "The Task 
List." If you have multiple operating systems on your system, use the CD for 
the version of the operating system you're installing. However, be aware that a 
Windows 2000 repair may prevent XP from booting, so you'll have to repair it 
afterwards as well. 
When booting, choose the option to set up Windows. 
After agreeing to the license agreement, you'll be shown a list of all exist-
ing Windows installations. If given the option to repair an installation or install 
a new copy of Windows, choose to repair-this will actually reinstall all of the 
system files. 
Remember to do a system update as described in the Finish Up a Repair 
or Installation task after a successful operating system reinstallation. 
Restore and Start Over 
This will generally be your last resort-when your system is such a mess that 
you're ready to give up and completely reinstall your operating system. 
The good news is that you'll end up with a clean system. The bad news is 
you'll lose all of the HIes on your system partition, along with all applications 
and application settings. 
System Restore 
Many newer systems don't come with actual Windows operating system disks. 
Instead they come with system restore CDs or with a hidden partition on the 
computer's hard drive that contains system restore information. 
If this is the case with your system, refer to the documentation that came 
with your computer to learn how to restore your system to the state it was in 
when you bought it.

This concludes the first part of the book. Believe it or not, you now know more 
about protecting a computer than most people-even many who work in the 
computer industry. You're in a good position to help friends and family protect 
their machines. 
So I'll leave you with one last thought. 
The number of computers infected by viruses is huge. The number of 
computers that lack firewalls and aren't up to date is also huge. And just as 
software technology continues to advance, the sophistication of viruses and 
attacks increases constantly. 
33 To really clean things up, you can delete and then re-<Teate and reformat the partition on which 
you're installing WIndows. Deleting. creating. and formatting partitions can be done from this screen.

So, think basic economics: 
• Few people understand computer security = low supply. 
• Many people need improved computer security and help with viruses = 
high demand. 
• Low supply with high demand = high prices and good opportunity! 
There are lots of people out there who, rather than reading this book and 
doing the work themselves, will gladly pay you to do the things you learned 
how to do in this book. And if a major chain can charge $160 and take three 
weeks to clean a system while losing all the customer's data, imagine the 
opportunities available to you. From cleaning syStems, to installing frrewalls, to 
performing security audits (making sure the system is set up and configured 
correctly, and is up to date), you now have knowledge and skills that people 
will pay for, whether as an employee at a computer store, or running your own 
small business.34 And it's a whole lot more fun and profitable than flipping 
burgers.35

Yes, you now know how to protect your computer. In the next part of the book, 
you'll find out how to help your computer to protect you and your privacy. It 
may help you keep some of that money you make as a computer security 
expert (or any other way). It might save you a great deal of embarrassment 
(should you be part of the 99 percent of the population who has something to

Imagine a world where there were no identification cards-
where individuals and businesses would simply believe you were 
who you said you were. Why. you could walk into a bank, claim to 
be Bill Gates. and walk out with a billion dollars in cash---except 
in such a world. nobody would dream of doing such a thing. 
Imagine a world where everyone could read each others' 
minds. There would be no secrets-
the very idea of embar-
rassment wouldn't exist. 
Would such a world be a utopian dream? Or a nightmare? 
I don't know. But I do know that In this world identification 
cards do exist-
and personal information that, if discovered, 
can be used against you. 
In this part of the book. you'll learn to protect your privacy 
against strangers and businesses . . . and also friends and family. 
Because sometimes there are things you don't want to share 
with even the best of friends. 

When TheyThink It's You, 
but It Isn't: Identity Theft 
You might be wondering-what does identity theft have to do with you? Mter 
all, what can you possible have that would make someone want to steal your 
identity? 1 
And in a sense, you'd be right. Identity theft is a much greater problem for 
adults than for teenagers. 
However, consider the following discussion: 
Your friend: Hey, why did you call me an idiot on 1M last night? 
You: What? I wasn't online. 
Your friend: You were calling me all sorts of stuff. 
Your friend: And you were telling OtherFriend99 that she was a big fat 
stinking slob. She was really pissed. 
You: No way! I was grounded from the computer yesterday. 
Your friend: Yeah, sure ... she's gonna believe that. 
You may already have guessed what happened here. "You" in this case left 
an instant messenger program installed on a computer configured in a way 
that it automatically logged on under "your" account. Perhaps it was at a 
friend's house or public computer. Anyway, someone came along, found an 
active instant messenger screen, and started chatting with people on "your" 
buddy list. 
Yes, it might just be a practical joke. But it can also be SOcially devastating. 
And things are worse if someone can change your 1M or e-mail password and 
continue to pretend to be you. It can take days or weeks to notice the prob-
lem, not to mention clean up the mess. 
, '(you're an adult reading this book, the answer ;s a lot easier . .. bank accounts and credit cards are 
obvious, but there are other risks, as you'll soon see. 

.lIIem·tl' Part" Protecting Your Privacy 
So surprise-teens do suffer from identity theft. And it happens all the 
time. In this chapter and the ones that follow, you're going to learn the basic 
precautions to prevent this kind of problem.2 
And guess what? Many teens do have bank accounts, and though they usu-
ally aren't quite big enough to justifY a determined assault, if you make it easy 
enough someone might just slip in and clean out what you do have. And some-
one trying to commit fraud or a crime and frame someone for it may not care 
if it's an adult or teen identification they steal for that purpose. Oh, and one 
more thing: The things you learn and habits you form in this chapter will help 
you for the rest of your life. They'll help you prevent identity theft later, when 
an attack can cost you thousands of dollars and take years to clean up. 
I JJI NOTE How big a problem is identity theft? 
In a Federal Trade Commission survey dated September 2003,3 1.5 
percent of respondents experienced a major fraud incident, with an average loss 
of $10,200 (of which the victim ended up losing an average of $1,200).Another 
2.4 percent of respondents experienced some sort of credit card fraud. When 
asked, an astonishing 12.7 percent of respondents experienced some kind of 
identity theft in the past five years, and spent an average of $500 and 30 hours 
cleaning up the mess. Note. however. that in most of these cases the information 
used for the identity theft was obtained through old-fashioned methods-stolen 
mail 
or credit card 
receipts---and 
not through the 
Internet. Visit 
http://www.ftc.govfor more details. 
What Identity Thieves Want 
Ultimately, what thieves want is the ability to pretend to be you. They want to 
be able to buy things on a victim's credit cards, to pull money out of their bank 
accounts, and even to commit crimes and have the victim take the blame. 
One way they can do this is by calling up an institution (bank, credit card 
company, etc.) and pretend to be you. These companies verifY your identity by 
asking personal questions that supposedly only you would know. If the thief 
has that information, they can successfully pretend to be you and give instruc-
tions to the institution that they will follow, assuming they are talking to the 
correct person. 
It's a bit like the classic case of a student calling the school office while pre-
tending to be a parent, and trying to explain why they aren't in school that 
day---except it's much more extreme and the stakes are higher.

Chapter 10 When They Think It's You, but It Isn't: Identity Theft m& 
Who Are YOU? 
To steal your identity, a thief needs information about you. And some informa-
tion is more dangerous than others. The following list is roughly in order from 
least to most dangerous with regards to identity theft. 
Name and Address 
This information is actually more important to protecting yourself (Part III) 
than protecting your identity. You should only give this information to a web 
site when you are asking them to send you something by mail (either informa-
tion, or when you are buying something). It's generally safe to use your first 
name on web sites, but you should not give out your last name unless you have 
good cause. Name and address alone is not generally enough to steal some-
one's identity,4 so shopping online and requesting information be mailed to 
you is reasonably safe. 
fll CAUTION While your name and address is not high-risk information 
LL..J in regards to identity theft, it is extremely high-risk information to give 
out in a public chat room or otherwise post in a public forum. Be sure to read 
more about this in Chapter 14. 
Phone Number 
Your phone number is also a relatively low-risk piece of information to give 
out-as long as your number is unlisted. If it is listed in a phone book with an 
address, it is possible to use a reverse directory to obtain the address given 
the phone number. One quick way to find out if this applies to you: Co to 
Coogle.com and enter your phone number in the search window. If it pops up 
with your address, you should use extra caution in posting your phone number. 
Credit Card Numbers 
While most teens don't have credit cards, they routinely use their parents' 
cards for online shopping. And in fact, that's pretty much the only time you 
want to enter your credit card onto a web site-when making a purchase on a 
secure web site. 
CUriously enough, credit cards are the safest way to make purchases online 
because they have the strongest fraud protection. If you buy something by 
credit card, and it never arrives, the credit card company will refund your 
money and charge the seller.5 
of However. many cases of identity theft occur not from the Internet. but from the more primitive 
approach of mail theft.. And if someone knows where you live . .. 
S Protection fOr debit cards is more limited, as you'll see later in this chapter. 

__ 
'lIOtl_ Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
Driver's License Number 
As a form of identification, it's fairly dangerous-the last thing you want is 
somebody else creating a fake driver's license with their picture, and your 
personal information. 
Never give this information out online. 
Birth Date 
Your birth date is a key piece of information that can be used to identifY you. 
Never give it out unless you are on a secure connection (which you'll read 
about shortly), and you absolutely trust the security of the web site. 
Some sites will ask for your birth date-they want this information because 
your age is one of the most useful pieces of marketing information a site can 
have when trying to sell you things. In cases like this, you should seriously con-
sider not registering with the site at all-any site that requires you to provide 
personal information should be considered suspect. If you want to register 
anyway, consider creating a fake birth date for use online.6 If you want them to 
know how old you are, keep the year the same, just change the month and day. 
As long as it doesn't match your birth date on official records, you're reason-
ably safe.7 
Social Security Number 
This one is worse than the birth date. Never give it out-period. Any site that 
asks for your Social Security number is almost certainly pulling a scam.8 Don't 
use a fake Social Security number either-that's just plain against the law. Plus, 
you run the risk of chOOSing a real one, which can cause grief to someone else. 
Mother's Maiden Name (or SecretWord) 
HistOrically, most banks and similar institutions would use your mother's 
maiden name (that's her last name before she got married) to help identify 
you, under the assumption that it's the kind of information only close family 
would know. 
Nowadays most institutions will accept any password as an alternative. 
Treat this information as you would your Social Security number. Never 
give this information out online.9 
" I'll talk mOre about lying online in Chapter I I. There are cases where you can ge't in'tO 'trOuble ror 
Iying--iryou are attempting fraud Or agreeing to a document where you assert 'that; every'thing you're 
saying is 'trU'thru/. But for surveys and routine regiS'tIYJtion on web sites (where they are just collecting 
marketing inrormation), it's generally OK. 
7 I soy reasonably safe, because bonks and financial institutions do make mistakes. 
B There are a few exceptions to this-when dealing with some financial insti'tutions and insurance 
companies wi'th w-hich you already have on account, or when applying for credit.. Some colleges use it 
for identification purposes as well. 
9 The some exceptions apply here as wi'th SOcial Security numbers.

Online Account 10 and Passwords 
If you really want to make it truly easy for people to steal from you or imper-
sonate you, the best thing you can do is give out an online ID or passwords. 
That saves thieves the trouble of trying to obtain the information by pretend-
ing to be you and allows them to go directly to the account in question and do 
whatever they want. 
N ever give out your password. If you do give it out, or you receive a pass-
word reminder or temporary password via e-mail, change it immediately. 
Your password is more critical than your online ID (the lOgin or user name 
you use on various sites). That's because many sites use your e-mail as the user 
name, and that is generally considered public information anyway. 
I'll talk more about passwords in Chapter 11. 
Permanent vs. Temporary Information 
These warnings may seem extreme-especially given that many of you don't 
have dealings with financial institutions at all. But it really is important to get 
into good habits now. That's because some of the information here-like your 
Social Security number and birth date-are going to be with you for the 
rest of your life. The last thing you want is an entry like this somewhere on 
a web site: 
Jan Somebody 
123 Someplace Lane 
SomeCity, California 95151 
SSN 123-45-6789 
DOB: 1/1/1990 
Once archived by search engines, it may be impossible to ever remove this 
information from the Internet-meaning you will spend the rest of your life 
potentially at risk of identity theft from anyone who stumbles on this informa-
tion-or who even does a search based on your name! 
HowThey Get It 
There are three main ways that outsiders can get at your personal information 
using the Internet: 

__ 
lIIt,.;I:I. Part /I ProtectingYour Privacy 
I. They can steal it off your system using Trojans, worms, or viruses, or by 
physically accessing your computer. 10 
2. They can steal it right off the Internet itself. 
3. You can give it to them yourself by being tricked into entering it into a 
malicious or fake web site. 
In Part I of this book you learned how to protect yourself from the first of 
these attacks, and you'll learn more in the chapters that follow, where I cover 
privacy on public computers and on a local network. 
The second and third of these will be covered in this section. 
Packet Sniffers 
When you communicate on the Internet, whether it is by browsing the web or 
sending and receiving e-mails, the data is split up into smaller blocks of data 
called packets. Those packets of data are generally transferred exactly as you 
see them. Those packets can go through many different computers on the way 
to their destination.ll That means it is possible for each one of those comput-
ers to examine the data and read whatever information you sent. 
A device called a packet sniffer is used to read packets of data as they move 
through the Internet. If someone has managed to attach a packet sniffer to a 
computer, or chooses to examine packets moving through their machine, they 
can use software that seeks out certain keywords to try to collect personal 
information. 
The answer to packet sniffers is to use a protocol called SSL or Secure 
Sockets Layer. This causes the data being transferred to be encrypted. 
Nowadays almost everyone uses 128-bit encryption, which is very secure.l2 
A web site or web page that uses SSL is called a secure site or page. It uses a 
protocol called HTTPS, so you'll often see the web URL in the form 
https:llwww . .. instead ofhttp://www . .. 
You should always make sure you are connected to a secure web page 
when transferring any personal information. You can tell a page is secure 
because you will see an indication in the browser window. In Internet 
Explorer it is a small lock at the bottom right part of the page as shown in 
Figure 10-1.

given away. or seeing what you've left. behind on a public compuTer 
II If you'd like to see how many, bring up a command window and type in the command tracert uri, 
where url is the address of a web sit_for example, trocert www.AlwaysUseProtection.com. Each line 
in the results shows you a computer that handled the data as it traveled between your computer, and 
the web site. 
IZ 4O-b1t encryption, which was commOn a few years bacl<, is virtually useless against any but the 
most casual attack.

~ Internet 
~I 
Figure 10-1 The lock indicates a page is secure. 
It is also possible to secure both instant messenger communication and 
e-mail messages. However, these are still fairly uncommon even in the busi-
ness world, and I have yet to meet any home user who does either. 
You should therefore assume that anything you send or receive via e-mail 
or instant messenger is insecure. That includes information sent when using 
an 1M direct connection between computers. 
Does this mean you should never send any personal information bye-mail 
or 1M? 
Well, it all comes down to the amount of risk you are willing to take. 
Personally, I will use e-mail or 1M to send friends my phone number, or direc-
tions to my home. The risk of these being intercepted is fairly low, and even if 
they are-this information isn't exactly top secret. 
Never ever send your Social Security number, mother's maiden name, dri-
ver's license, or account ID and password through e-mail or instant messenger. 
Server Vulnerabilities 
In Part I of this book you read about many different ways that a computer can 
be attacked. You also learned about the reasons for those attacks, and that one 
of those reasons is so people can steal information from your computer. 
You may have just written off that particular reason as unimportant. Your 
biggest concern might be the proper operation of your system, or preventing 
loss of data. You may be concerned about your computer being used to attack 
others, or to host illegal web sites. You may even be most concerned about 
attacks that might reduce your available bandwidth for online gaming. 
But I'd like to tum this around for a moment and ask you to look at the 
problem of computer attacks not in terms of how it affects your system, but 
how it affects the web sites you visit. 
After all, you now know that a web site is nothing more than a computer 
somewhere on the Internet that is running a program called a web server. And 
that computer is also subject to being attacked. 
Now, many of the people who run major commercial web sites put a lot of 
money into securing their sites. They not only use antivirus software and per-
form system updates, they also use very expensive security hardware (think of 
them as firewalls on steroids), and constantly monitor their systems. 
Nevertheless, if there's one thing you've learned, it's that no security is per-
fect. Not only is there always a window of vulnerability to new attacks, there's 
always the chance of human error. 

·1'1' Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
So what happens when a web server gets attacked?13 What if it's a web 
server that contains some of your personal information? 
Well, the thieves can end up stealing that information-along with the per-
sonal information of a few hundred thousand of your closest friends. 
So, it's not enough for you to see the lock that indicates that a web site is 
secure. All that tells you is that your communication with that web site is 
secure. It tells you nothing about how well the computer that hosts the web 
site protects any information it collects. 
And there's no real way for you to know. It's not uncommon to hear news 
stories about institutions such as banks or major online stores who report the 
theft of information from their servers.14 
There are ways you can limit your risk. 
• The larger sites are more likely to invest heavily in security, so be more 
cautious with the information you give to smaller sites or companies. 
• Use multiple passwords. That way if a password is stolen from one site, 
it won't compromise your security on others. 
• Always buy online using a credit card. If the number is stolen and fraud 
occurs, the loss should almost always be covered by the credit card 
company and not by yoU.15 
Speaking of Credit Cards 
It may seem odd to talk about credit cards in a book intended for teens-since 
relatively few teens have their own credit cards. But the fact is that online 
shopping really does require credit cards, especially if you want to protect 
yourself from fraud. So here is some basic information about credit cards that 
you should know, which might actually help you when it comes to getting your 
parents to let you use a credit card or (if older) to obtain one yourself. 
Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards 
When you charge something to a credit card, you are borrOwing money. Once 
a month a credit card bill arrives in which you either pay back the loan or part 
of it along with interest. A debit card looks like a credit card, but is not. When 
you charge something to a debit card, the money is immediately withdrawn 
from the checking account linked to the card. 
13 These kind of snes aren't just subject to Internet attacks. What happens when a disgruntled 
employee decides to burn a CD with a few thousand credit card numbers before they resign? They 
need good Internal securny as well. 
,4 Or from other sources. In November 2003, a laptop was stolen from the offices ofa contractor 
working forWelis Fargo. It contained the personal Information of thousands of customers. It was 
recovered successfully and. by all accounts, Wells Fargo did an excellent job of notifYing customers and 
handling the situation in a responsible manner. 
's Read the card agreement and follow their instructions. Be sure to repon any suspicious charges as 
soon as you know about them. 

Chapter 10 When They Think It's You, but It Isn't Identity Theft I-.!III:II:t __ 
N ow, here's the most important thing to mow about these cards: 
For various legal reasons that don't necessarily make any sense, credit 
cards provide you a great deal of protection if anything goes wrong with a pur-
chase, but debit cards do not.IB 
With a credit card, if a product never arrives, you probably won't have to 
pay for it. If the card is stolen, your maximum loss is usually limited to about 
$50. If you have a problem with the company that sold you the product, the 
credit card company will often refund you the money and then go back and 
get it from the company. 
With debit cards, if you're a victim of fraud or have problems with a pur-
chase, you're usually out ofluck. By the way, ATM cards are debit cards. 
So, when you are making purchases online (whether with your card or your 
parents'), be sure you're using a credit card and not a debit card. 
GettingYour Own Card 
Once you tum 18, if you're holding a job, it's not terribly hard to get a credit 
card. If your parents are willing to cosign,17 it will be easy. Financial institu-
tions love to get people hooked on credit and into debt as young as pOSSible. 
It is possible to get a credit card when you're under 18 if your parents 
cosign it, or give you one on their account. 
Single-Use Card Numbers 
The best deal around for both preventing fraud and for convincing parents to 
let you use their card is a feature offered by some credit card companies in 
which they give you a new card number that is attached to your credit card, 
but can only be used once, or for a limited time. In other words, let's say you 
have a card with the number 1234-5678-9012. Rather than entering this into 
an online store, you ask the card company for a temporary card number-they 
don't actually give you a physical card, just a number. Let's say they give you 
1111-2222-3333, which you use to make the purchase. The charge shows up 
under your main account, but this temporary card number soon expires. This 
approach serves two purposes: 
I. You don't have to worry about the merchant storing the credit card 
number. If the web site is attacked and the number stolen, it won't 
matter as it will probably have long since expired. 
/6 To be specific: Credit cards are covered by Federal law under me Fair Billing Credit Act, which pro-
vides significant protection against fraud. Debit cards only offer me protection that the company that 
issued me card is Willing to give you, which is rarely as good. 
/ 7 Guarantee repayment if you don't 

__ 
I;oI;f.;II Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
2. Your parents don't have to worry about you somehow reusing the 
number without their lmowledge. They can give you a new number for 
each purchase. 
Contact the credit card company to see if your card supports this feature. 
Some cards that include this feature are 
• American Express: Look for "private payments" on their web site or see 
http://www.americanexpress.com/privatepayments.18 
• Discover card: Look for a feature called "DeskShop" on their web site, 
http://www.discovercard.com. 
Microsoft Passport 
If you have a Hotmail account, or use Windows Messenger, or have Windows 
XP and followed their instructions that literally beg you to create a Passport 
account, you have an account on Microsoft Passport. 
The idea of Passport is that you can have one account name and password 
that can be used on many different sites. When you log in to a site, rather than 
it keeping track of your user name and password, it redirects you to the 
Passport login site. You then log in to Passport, and the Passport site tells the 
other site you came from that you are logged in, and gives it some information 
so it lmows who you are. 
This presents two huge advantages to you. First, it allows you to limit the 
number of account names and passwords you have-using the same one on 
multiple sites. Second, it reduces the risk of attacks on other sites compromis-
ing your security-because they don't store your user name and password. It's 
all kept on the Passport site. 
However, this also presents two huge disadvantages to you. First, if your 
Passport account and password is compromised, people will suddenly have 
access to your account on every system that uses Passport. This includes the 
ability to hijack them all at once by changing your passport address (so they 
can impersonate you on Hotmail, Windows Messenger, etc.). 
Second, you run into the same kind of effect as you have with viruses-
people write viruses primarily for Windows because everyone uses Windows-
it's a big target. As Passport acquires more and more accounts, it becomes a 
bigger target, and more and more attackers try to find vulnerabilities either in 
the way it works or on the Passport computers themselves. 
18 One nice thing about American Express private payments is it runs entirely off the web--you don't 
need any desktop software. 

Chapter 10 When They Think It's You, but It Isn't: Identity Theft ... 
And there have been some cases where those vulnerabilities have been 
exploited,19 including one where just opening a message in Hotmail could give 
a person access to someone else's personal information on Passport.20 That 
vulnerability has long since been closed, and Microsoft has invested a great 
deal of effort on securing Passport, but reports of new vulnerabilities do 
appear periodically 
If you have a Passport account, you should sign on to the account directly 
at http://www.passport.com. log in, and review and edit your profile. Tl)' your 
Hotmail or MSN Messenger account ID and password to log in. 
At the bottom of the profile page appears a list of options on which types 
of data Passport can share with other sites. The most sensitive piece of infor-
mation Passport keeps at this time is your birth date. I prefer to leave them all 
unchecked (instructing Passport to keep my information confidential). You 
may also wish to delete or edit your birth date, since that is the most critical 
piece of information that could be lost if Passport itself is compromised. 
Fake Web Sites 
Packet sniffers and server attacks are both technological means of getting your 
private information. But why go to all that work if they can just con you into 
giving it to them directly?

Chapter 10 When They Think It's You, but It Isn't Identity Theft .. 
You have to give them credit for nerve-they not only want your credit 
card information and Social Security number, they even want your ATM code! 
So here's the deal: 
Both e-mail and web sites can lie. It's remarkably easy for one web site to 
look just like another. Fortunately, it's not hard to protect yourself. Here are a 
few simple rules: 
• Always double-check the URL that appears in the address window of 
your browser. If it doesn't match that for the site where you think you 
are, you may be on a fraudulent site. 
• It is always safest to get to a site by typing in the URL rather than 
clicking a link. For example, to be sure you really are on eBay, just type 
in http://www.ebay.com.21 
• Never trust e-mail or click a link in an e-mail message unless you are 
absolutely certain it is safe. One common exception is verification links 
that some sites use to make sure your e-mail address is valid. For 
example, if you sign up for an e-mail list, a web site will usually send 
you an initial e-mail with a link in it that you must click to confirm that 
you want to join the list. But only click the link if you have requested to 
join the list, and you recognize the sender. 
• Legitimate companies should never send you an e-mail requesting you 
to provide this kind of information-they got what they needed when 
you registered the first time. 
How Honest Is Spom? 
You know that spam e-mail messages lie, but here are some numbers from 
an April 2003 FTC report.22 
33 percent of all e-mail lies about who it's from: half of those claim to be 
from someone you know. 
22 percent contain subject lines that have nothing to do with the contents 
of the message. 
40 percent of the messages contain content that is typical of known cons, 
scams, or fraud. 
Overall, 66 percent of spam lies to you in some way. 
And here's another fun one: 63 percent of requests to remove your e-mail 
from a list are simply ignored. 
21 You should still double-check the URL after you've reached the page. Some viruses and wOrms are 
designed to redirect your browser to fake sites, so an infected ~em can be the first step towards 
Identity theft.

Public Records 
In Orwell's book 1984, the government is able to watch everything you do. 
Back in 1984, the thought remained scary, but it still seemed a bit hypotheti-
cal-the cost to build that kind of database and monitor people to the extent 
described in Orwell's book was so high that it wasn't something most people 
were concerned about. In 2003, you can spend under $200 for a hard drive big 
enough to store all of the personal information (name, address, Social Security 
number, etc.) of every resident of the United States. For under $1,000, you 
could store that information for everyone in the world. 
So it's not surprising that a great deal of personal information can appear 
on the Internet in ways you never expected. 
Telephone directories, real estate transactions, and corporate records are 
among the public records where individuals can be listed, some of which are 
easily browsable through the Internet. Many sports events, including high 
school sports results, end up on the Internet-and that's one of the most com-
mon pieces of information that comes up for teenagers when you do a search 
on their names.23 
For those of you who run your own web sites, if you obtain your own 
domain name, the information you prOvide also goes into the public record. 
Some registrars will register a domain under their name to help protect your 
privacy. Check with the registrar to see if that is pOSSible. 
The Things You Post 
Every time you post to a discussion forum, or add content to a web site 
(whether a school site, a club site, or one you are writing yourself), that infor-
mation is likely to be stored somewhere on one of the major search engines. 
Try it for yourself. Do a search on your full name using Coogle or another 
search engine. You may be astonished with what comes up. Next try your par-
ents-that might be even more interesting. 
Once on the Internet, it's almost impossible to get rid of it. So you need to 
be very careful what you post. 
• Never post your name and address and phone number on a discussion 
forum or include it on a web site, unless you don't mind it becoming 
public information. Don't allow your school or club to include a roster 
on their web site that contains that information.24 
23 Yes, if you partidpat.e in high school sports, !.here's a good chance !.hat. just by typing in your full

• Never post other personally identifiable information on a discussion 
forum or web site-especially critical information such as birth date (or 
a list of birthdays), Social Security numbers, and so on . 
• Never post your real e-mail address on a discussion forum or web site 
unless you really want to receive tons of spam.25 
I Browse, Therefore I Exist 
Identity theft may not be as serious a problem for teens as adults by some 
measures, but it does occur and can be just as painful to the victim. In this 
chapter, you learned the kinds of information that you should keep private, 
and some of the ways that people can obtain that information-both techno-
lOgical and through fraud and trickery.26 
We've just begun our exploration of privacy issues. For example, I really 
haven't discussed how to prevent someone from taking over your 1M account 
(which is how this chapter started). But fear not, the answers to those prob-
lems come next. 
2S There are tricks you can use to post an e-mail address so that spammers can't easily pick them up 
with automatic tools. /fyour e-mail ismyname@someplace.com. you could enter "myname at some-
place dotcom" or use mynameNoSpam@someplace.com and instruct people to just remove the 
NoSpam. 
2 6 One of my reviewers commented that he found this chapter very scary. Frankly, I was at a loss to 
reassure him. Identity theft is a big problem, and it's probably going to get worse before it gets better. 
The best I can say is that if you get in the habit of taking precautions now, you will dramatically 
reduce the chance of suffering identity theft in the long run. 

Pass\Nords:Your Key to 
the Internet 
In Chapter 10, you learned about identity theft and the various pieces of infor-
mation that can be used to identifY you. Of all the information mentioned, the 
one used most often to identifY you on the Internet is your user name and 
password. 
Your user name can vary depending on the type of site. Some web sites use 
e-mail addresses. Some, like instant messenger services, ask you to create your 
own user name. Some fmancial institutions use account numbers. Few use 
your real name. 
In almost every case, the user name is considered the "public" informa-
tion-it's the way they address you, and it may appear on the web page, or on 
a discussion forum, or as your name in a chat room. In order to verifY that you 
actually are who you say you are, 1 these sites and services use a secret 
password. 
Which brings us to the most important thing to remember about 
passwords: 
Since computers confirm who you are by using a password, if 
someone else has your password, they can pretend to be you. 
So good password management is a key part of preventing identity theft. 
Password Strategies 
Most people do a terrible job managing their passwords. 
Here are a couple of common approaches.

_ .. ' .... 4 .... Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
Scenario I 
You create a password that is easy to remember. Maybe it's the name of 
your pet, a random word, your birthday, or your name. 
You then use that password on every web site, for e-mail, for your 
instant messenger program, and as your computer password. 
One day someone figures out your password (maybe by guessing, or by 
looking over your shoulder as you typed it in, or because you were sharing 
HIes on a network and they needed it to access your hard drive). 
That person logs on to your e-mail account, and sends your teacher an 
incredibly nasty message. They also use your 1M account to send crazy-
sounding messages to your friends, and post messages from you on your 
favorite discussion forums in which you advocate making drinking of Coca 
Cola a felony. 
Your teacher, concerned, refers you to an endless series of counselors 
and psychologists who refuse to believe that you had nothing to do with 
the messages (since they clearly came from your accounts). You flunk out 
of school and find yourself living the rest of your life in a van down by the 
river. 
Scenario 1 
You carefully follow the recommendations of security experts, creating 
very secure passwords that mix case and contain punctuation and numbers. 
Passwords like Yk3&z89W(&q. 
You make sure to use a different password and user ID for each web 
site you register with, each e-mail account, your instant messenger 
accounts, and your computer. That way, even if someone was able to figure 
out one password, they would only gain access to one account, minimizing 
the possible damage. 
The good news is nobody can guess your passwords, and your accounts 
are secure. 
The bad news is you can't remember your passwords, so your accounts 
are inaccessible. 
You therefore can't check your e-mail, and you miss the message from 
your teacher about that four-year scholarship with a $100,000 signing 
bonus. In despair, having missed that opportunity, you see an endless 
series of counselors and psychologists, but they help little. You flunk out of 
school and find yourself living the rest of your life in a van down by the 
river. 
OK, you're right. Most people don't follow the advice of security experts 
with regards to creating strong passwords and using different passwords (and 
changing them frequently). That's because normal human beings can't remem-
ber strong passwords. 

Chapter I I Passwords: Your Key to the Internet m. 
The problem is, most people really do follow scenario #l-they use a 
single password that is easy to remember (and therefore easy to crack). 
So I'm not going to tell you how to use passwords properly. I'm not going 
to repeat to you the best recommendations of security experts. I realize that 
this will cause many security experts to criticize me and this book. 2 I don't 
care. The best advice in the world is useless if people won't follow it. 
Instead, I'm going to teach you a password strategy that is pretty good. 
More important, it's one that is easy to make into a habit and to follow. 
How Many Passwords Do You Really Need? 
One password is never enough. That's because some web sites are downright 
careless with your password. 
Most web sites have a way to recover a lost password based on a secret hint 
or question that you prOvide. For example, when you register, they might ask 
you to choose a question, like "What city were you born in?" or "What is the 
name of a favorite pet?" If you can answer it correctly, they will usually do one 
of two things: 
• Issue you a new temporary password by sending it to your e-mail 
account . 
• E-mail your actual password to you. 
Those that issue you a temporary password are doing things correctly-you 
can then log in and change the password to something you will remember. 
Those that e-mail your password to you have compromised your pass-
word-because it can be read by any packet sniffer on the Internet. 
If that's the one password you use everywhere, you now face the need to 
either take a chance that nobody saw it, or change all of your accounts to a 
new password. 
I would suggest that the minimum number of passwords you really need is 
three. 
Your Three Passwords 
You need one very secure password to use on sites that you believe are trust-
worthy, and that protect information you really care about (like credit card 
numbers or other personal information). This is the password you use for 
things like online shopping. You should only use this password on web pages 
that are secure (check the lock icon at the lower right of the window as 
described in Chapter 10). 
You need a second password for use on sites where you won't suffer terri-
bly if it is compromised. Use this for discussion forums, e-mail, and instant 
messenger. You can use this password on web sites that aren't secure. You 
2 Probably in endless personal attacks (called flalnes) on various discussion forums 

_ .... 
'·:1:11. Part /I ProtectingYour Privacy 
should still protect this password (as I'll describe later), but the idea is that 
you're not protecting anything so critical that someone with a packet sniffer 
will go through the hassle of following through with an attack. Most individu-
als aren't subject to the kind of attacks that a business may face (with lots of 
money on the line). 
You need a third password for your computer. There are two reasons for this: 
I. You may want to give out this password for file sharing, or to let 
someone use your system. You wouldn't want them to also gain access 
to your online accounts. 
2. Windows 95/98/ME does not store computer passwords securely. In 
fact, there are programs readily available that will display the user 
names and passwords of every account on a Windows 95/98/ME 
computer. So if you use your one password on those machines, anyone 
sitting down in front of your computer can within minutes find the 
password and use it elsewhere. 
If a web site is suspicious in any way, consider creating a "throwaway" user 
ID and password just for that one site. That way if it is a scam or fake web site 
(trying to grab account information to use elsewhere), you won't compromise 
your three main accounts. 
Creating a Strong Password 
Experts will tell you that a password should be at least seven characters long, 
should contain both upper- and lowercase characters, and should include 
numbers and punctuation. The result is typically a password that is impossible 
to crack, and equally impossible to remember. 
How Passwords Are Cracked 
There are four main approaches for cracking passwords: 
I. A program or hacker guesses based on what they know about you. 
Names of family members. birth dates. etc .• are often used as pass-
words.This is called an intelligent guessing attack. 
2. A program just tries every word in a dictionary including common 
names. This is called a dictionary attack. 
3. A program tries every possible combination of letters. numbers. and 
punctuation.This is a brute force attack. 
4. Someone breaks into your house. looks at your desk. and finds the 
Post-it note on which you've written your account IDs and passwords. 
This is called breaking and entering. 

Chapter I I Passwords: Your Key to the Internet I'l'lt" •• 
So what should you do? 
I'm not going to tell you. Because if I gave a fonnula for you to use, it 
might become popular and then easy for other people to guess. 
But I'll tell you some basic ideas that can help you create your own memo-
rable password, and avoid creating one that's too easy to crack. 
• Try for seven characters, but never less than five. Your secure password 
should always be at least seven characters.3 
• Avoid the obvious. Don't use something people can figure out about 
you, such as a name of a family member, a driver's license number or 
license plate, birth date, or the city where you were born or live. 
• Pick a word that you will remember. It should have nothing to do with 
you whatsoever. Even better, pick two and string them together. 
• Add some numbers. Best is to put them inside the word somewhere. 
Don't use obvious numbers like your area code, zip code, phone 
number prefix, or birth date. Please don't use your ATM number! Yes, 
I know, remembering random numbers is painful, but you only have to 
do it once.4 
You can do some mixing and matching-like using the same number but 
different words for each of your passwords. It's not ideal, but it does reduce 
the risk of you forgetting without a great increase in risk. 
Your computer password doesn't need to be very secure if you're behind a 
firewall unless you're concerned about a serious attack from someone on your 
local network. 
I 
~I NOTE These recommendations provide decent security for individual 
/V 
and home use. Businesses have very different issues both in terms of the 
size of the local network, the more complex network configurations, and the 
potential costs of unauthorized access. In other words, for business applications. 
listen to the security experts. not the advice I offer here. 
3 Between upper- and lowercase letters and numbers, you have 62 characters. A 4-character pass-
word has about 15 million possible combinations, which is far too many to test if you were doing so 
by hand, but no trouble at all for a computer attack. 5 characters brings the count up to a billion pos-
sibilities, which is better. 7 characters results in over three trillion possibilities, which might not slow 
down the NSA, but is fine for most purposes. 
4 One of my reviewers suggested I offer a list of possible ways to create passwords, like using ana-
grams or reversing words. The reason I am not doing so is simple: Any "system" I offer to create pass-
words may end up being used by many people who read this book. As a result, attackers (who can 
also read) will design attacks spedfjcally to counter those suggestions-which would result in the 
rules that I offer to make passwords more secure actually having the reverse effect! 

.IIIC·lil' Part" Protecting Your Privacy 
Cycling Passwords 
Experts will recommend that you change your passwords every 30 to 60 days. 
Business networks often require this. Some schools require it. 
But unless it's required, you probably won't do it. So don't worry about it. 
Change your password any time it is compromised. And consider changing 
them all once a year just to be safe. 
Writing Down Passwords 
Experts will recommend that you never write down your password. 
But you probably will anyway. 
So here's the strategy. Write it down just in case, but store it somewhere 
that has nothing to do with your computer. Not on your desk. Not on a Post-it 
note. Not on a fIle in your computer. Hide it somewhere you'll remember in 
case you forget your password. (Remember, you just went to a lot of trouble to 
make up a password that you would remember, right? So you should never 
need this.) 
Should you keep a list of which web sites use which password? Not really. 
Since you only have a few passwords, you can just try them when you visit a 
site until you find the right one. 
Giving out Your Password 
You may find yourself giving out a password in order to let people connect to a 
shared drive on your hard drive. That is the only password you should ever 
give out. 
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER give anyone your password to a web site, 
e-mail account, or 1M account. If a web site sends you an e-mail with a link 
asldng you to confirm your account information or password, it's a scam. If 
someone calls you asking for your account information and password, it's a 
scam. 
If you're sharing fIles on a local network, it's OK to give out the password 
to your shared drive. That's why you gave it a different password from the one 
you use online. 
Passwords and the Evils of Automatic 
Login 
Software developers know that passwords are a necessary evil, so many appli-
cations (including Internet Explorer and instant messenger applications) offer 
a convenient feature called automatic login. You'll sometimes see this feature 
referred to as automatic logon, automatic sign-in, or sign in automatically. The 

Chapter II Passwords: Your Key to the Internet .'lI:r.,,,, __ 
idea is that your computer can remember the user account and password for 
you, and automatically log you on to a web site or instant messenger service as 
soon as you access the site or launch the application. 
As long as you're absolutely certain that you're the only person who will 
use your computer (or your account on a Windows 2000/XP computer), auto-
matic lOgin can be a huge convenience.5 
The problem with automatic lOgin is Simple-if anyone has access to your 
computer, your accounts and password can be stolen. 
OK, part of this is obvious. Sure, if someone uses your computer, they'll be 
able to log on to web sites or use instant messenger or read your e-mail with-
out knOwing your password. 
But it's worse. 
In order to log on to a web site or service, your computer has to store the 
password. There are programs that can retrieve those passwords from a com-
puter. Which means that if someone hacks into your system, they can retrieve 
that information as well. In other words, if your computer is a victim of a virus 
or Trojan, your passwords can be stolen and used even if the hacker doesn't 
have access to your computer.6 
And of course, if your computer is stolen or sold, those passwords will be 
available to the new owner. And more and more teens (especially college stu-
dents) are using laptop computers, which are more vulnerable to theft than 
desktops. 7 
This is all bad, but there's more: 
If you tum on automatic lOgin when on a friend's computer or public com-
puter, anyone who uses that computer afterwards will have access to that 
account, and possibly be able to figure out your password (and since you 
almost certainly use that password for other accounts, that represents a huge 
security breach). 
This is how most identity theft happens with teenagers-they visit a 
friend's house, log in to their instant messenger account, and leave automatic 
lOgin turned on. Next time their friend uses the computer, they find it logged 
in to an 1M session, and proceed to do with it whatever they want. 8 
That may not be vel)' scal)', but there are also cases of "friends" doing 
some creative shopping online using stored user names, passwords, and credit 
card numbers. And if you're on a public computer, and you've entered any 
5 Automatic login settings are unique for each user account on a computer. So if your account is 
password protected, and you're using Windows 2000 or XI'! you have some extra protection, as long 
as you don't let someone sit down and use your computer while it's logged in to your account. 
6 One of my teen reviewers mode this comment: .. I always toke precautions ever since my computer 
was hocked 3 years ago. They (the hackers) told all my friends stuff about me, and swore at them, 
and they sent me a virus and changed my passwords . .. I'm hello cautious now." (submitted by AR.).

personal information, it becomes available to the next person to sit down at 
that computer. 
So here's the deal. Now you understand the risks-and if you are truly con-
fident that your computer is secure, go ahead and use automatic lOgin. But it is 
my personal opinion that automatic lOgin is evil, and you should never allow a 
computer to remember your password for you--even your home system.

• The 'Web addresses" setting allows Internet Explorer to guess which

might be a privacy issue (a subject for the next chapter), it's a minor 
one, and certainly isn't a security issue. 
• The "Forms" setting allows Internet Explorer to store entries when you 
fill out online forms. Since this can include personal information, I 
recommend you turn it off. 
• The "User names and passwords on forms" and "Prompt me to save 
passwords" settings store user names and passwords when you log in 
to web sites. By default, Internet Explorer will prompt you to save 
passwords. However, most people when they see the prompt will by 
default turn it on and store the password, not realizing that's what 
they've done. The settings shown here (with the "User names and 
passwords on forms" check box checked, and the "Prompt me to save

as well.

Turning off Automatic Login for the .NET Messenger 
Service and MSN Messenger 
Kudos to Microsoft on this one: By default, automatic login is turned off for 
current versions of the .NET Messenger and the closely related MSN 
Messenger. 
However, if you have the misfortune to log in once with the "Sign me in 
automatically" check box shown in Figure 11-7 enabled, the ability to tum off 
the automatic lOgin for .NET Messenger is well hidden and poorly docu-
mented.

You can do either of the following: 
I. If you are not already signed out of Windows Messenger, on the File 
menu, click Sign Out. 
2. In the main window, click To sign in with a different account, click

3. In the Sign in to .NET Messenger Service dialog box, clear the

4. Click Close, and then click OK. 
What they don't tell you is, if you're using Windows XP, you must choose 
the second approach. The first option alone won't work.9 
Better not to choose automatic lOgin the first time around. 
If you are using the MSN Messenger client, you can disable automatic 
login by going to the Tools ~ Options menu command, choosing the General 
Tab, and unchecking the check box labeled "Allow automatic sign in when 
connected to the Internet". However, clearing this check box is not 
enough to clear any passwords stored on your computer if you've 
already used automatic login. You must also clear your stored password as 
described earlier. 
Beyond Passwords 
In Chapter 10, you learned about identity theft. In this chapter, you learned 
that one of the ways you are most vulnerable to identity theft can be the infor-
mation you leave on computers, both your own and those of friends (not to 
mention public Internet computers). 
In fact, this is the first chapter that really focused on the idea that informa-
tion on your computer can compromise your privacy. But there is more to pro-
tecting your privacy than identity theft and more things that can be found on 
your computer than passwords-as the next chapter will show. 
9 This may be winner of the least intuitive user setting ever. Making you go to a Control Panel app/et 
to disable automatic login of an 1M application is absurd.

The Traces You Leave 
Behind: What Your 
Machine Says About You 
I started this section of the book on privacy talking about identity theft. 
There's a reason for that. Most everybody you meet will agree that identity 
theft is a bad thing. l 
That's probably where agreement on privacy issues ends. 
Many of the most significant issues our society faces hinge on privacy 
rights. Should a company interviewing you for a job have the right to see your 
school records? Should the college you are applying for be allowed to check 
your driving record along with your grades? Can insurance companies look at 
your private medical records before granting you insurance? The pervasive use 
of security cameras may protect stores and help police ticket speeders, but the 
vast majority of people whose activities are captured and recorded are inno-
cent of any wrongdoing. How much privacy do we give up in return for how 
much additional security? 
And of course, there's the age old argument: If you have nothing to hide, 
why would you care if you have no privacy? 
This book is intended to teach you about how your privacy can be invaded, 
and how to protect it-to whatever degree you wish. If you really don't care 
about your privacy beyond preventing identity theft, you really don't need to 
read this chapter or the one that follows. 
The next chapter will discuss the traces you leave behind as you browse 
the Internet. This chapter will focus on the traces you leave behind on your 
machine. 
Footprints on Your Machine 
Think back for a moment to a time when you visited the house of a new friend 
for the first time. Remember when you first entered their room? 
I The most notable exception being identity thieves, of course 
IDIIII

_ ... 'IIi' .. ' Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
You can learn a lot about someone from their room. 
What kinds of books do they read? Do they have any hobbies? Trophies 
may be a sign of interest in sports. Posters might indicate a favorite band, or a 
particular political viewpoint. A report card or honors certificate might give an 
idea of how they are doing in school. A CD collection demonstrates taste in 
music (or lack thereof). Are they organized to a fault, or total slobs? 
What could a person learn about you by visiting your computer? 
• Web sites you've visited 
• Actual pages from web sites you've visited 
• E-mail you've sent and received 
• Records of instant message conversations 
• Product recommendations based on items you've bought or looked at 
in the past 
• Contents of any files (letters, homework assignments, downloaded 
files) 
• Contents of any files or programs you've downloaded 
N ow, you might be thinking, "Why should I worry about what can be found 
on my computer?" After all-it's your computer, right? Well, consider all the 
cases where someone might have access to a computer that you have used: 
• Anyone who sits down at your computer, including friends, parents, 
and Siblings, will have access to that information. 
• If you're on a local network, anyone else on the local network may have 
access to your computer. If it's an unsecured wireless network, anyone 
driving by may have access. 
• If you've used a computer at a friend's house, or a public computer, 
whoever uses it after you can find traces of your visit. 
• If you've been hacked by a Trojan, the attacker will have access. 
• If you sell or give away your computer, you'll be giving away all that 
information if you don't take precautions to clean it Up.2 
• If you send your computer to a store for repairs, the people working on 
it have access to your information. 
• And, of course, if your computer is stolen, the thief will have access to 
everything on your machine. 
2 One time I was helping set up a computer that a friend had obtained from a nonprofit organiza-
tion--one they no longer needed. It had a/l sorts of leftover information including donor lists and 
employee records. 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind:WhatYourMachine SaysAboutYou ... 
If you're sharing a computer, you've probably already thought about these 
issues. But as you can see, even if you have your own computer and you're the 
only person who normally uses it, you might want to spend a few minutes 
thinking about the traces you leave behind on your machine. 
Browser Footprints and How to Erase 
Them 
Just as the books on your bookshelf help visitors to your room learn your inter-
ests, people visiting your computer can learn your interests based on the web 
sites you visit. 
It may seem odd that just looking at a web page is comparable to buying a 
book and putting it on your shelf. In fact, the web site is much more obvious. 
Visiting a web page is more like putting a book on your shelf, stapling a poster 
about the book on your wall, leaving a calendar with the dates when you read 
the book, and leaving photocopies of many of the pages lying around in plain 
site. 
NOTE The instructions that follow are only for Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. because that is currently the most popular browser. However. 
other browsers (Netscape. Mozilla. Opera) have comparable features. Refer to 
your browser documentation for details. 
Browser History 
The most obvious way guests can determine which pages you visit is by looking 
at the history log of your browser. This feature allows you to quickly review 
pages you visited-a great convenience when it comes to navigating the web 
(especially when it comes to remembering that site you visited just the other 
day). 
To delete your browser history, start by using the Tools ~ Internet Options 
menu command from Internet Explorer.3 Be sure the General tab is selected. 
You'll see the dialog box shown in Figure 12-1. 
Click the Clear History button to clear your browser history. This will also 
clear the list of recently visited sites in the address bar of your browser. 
J Remember, the Internet Options tab only controls Internet Explorer. Refer to your browser documen-
tation if you use a different browser.

Cookies Part I 
Cookies have gotten a lot of bad press. In fact, cookies themselves are not the 
problem-it's how some sites use them that can be a problem. 
What's a Cookie? 
Every time you access a web site, what really happens is that your computer 
connects to the web server computer and requests some information. The web 
server computer obviously knows the IP address4 of your computer-because 
if it didn't, it wouldn't be able to send the information back to you. 
The problem that web sites face is this: Each request is completely inde-
pendent. It's not like a phone call-where you keep talking back and forth. 
Instead, imagine a phone call where every time the person you were calling 
answered you, they hung up, and you had to call back ... 
4 IP addresses were covered in Chapter 5 (for those of you who may have skipped right to this chapter). 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind:What Your Machine Says About You Ilii' •• 
Ring, ring . .. Hello? 
Hi, it's Dan. What's up? 
Nothing much ... Click. 
Ring, ring . .. Hello? 
So, did you want to go out Saturday? 
Sure, sounds great! ... Click. 
Wait, who was it I just agreed to go out with? 
You see, the only way a phone conversation like that would work is if every 
time you called back, you started out by saying who you are. 
That's all a cookie is. When your computer contacts a web site, the site can 
request of your computer, "Next time you come to this site, please tell me who 
you are by sending back the follOwing information with your request." That 
information your computer includes with the request is called the cookie. It 
allows the web site to know who you are by examining the cookie information 
that it sent your computer earlier. 
If you want to see what a cookie looks like, open your Explorer window 
(the me manager, not the browser). On Windows 20001XP, navigate to the 
Document and Settings directory on the drive that holds your operating sys-
tem. Select the directory with your user name. You should see a folder named 
Cookies.5 On Windows 981ME, look for the Cookies directory under your 
Windows directory. 
The Cookies directory contains a bunch of text meso If you open one, you 
might see something that looks like this:

* 
This is a cookie for Coogle.com.6 So anytime this computer connects to 
Coogle.com, it will send this information with the request. 
What does this information actually mean? 
5 This is how you view cookies stored by Internet Explorer. Other browsers store cookies in different 
ways. For example. the Netscape browser stores cookies in a file named cookies. txt in the directory 
where it stores user configuration data. 
6 Actually. it jUst looks like one. I randomly changed most of the numbers and letters to protect my 
own privacy. 

•• 
'i':11 Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
I have no idea. Most of the infonnation in a cookie only has meaning to the 
web site that set the cookie-it's how the web site figures out who you are. 
That doesn't mean it has to make any sense to you. 
How Do Cookies Affect Privacy? 
There are actually two types of cookies: session cookies and pennanent cook-
ies. A session cookie is kept on your system for a limited amount of time 
(called a session). This kind of cookie is very important: When you're buying 
concert tickets online, if the web site couldn't remember you from one page to 
the next, you could easily end up with somebody else's tickets. 
Pennanent cookies are stored on your system for longer periods. For 
example, let's say you browse Amazon.com for fantasy books. Next time you 
visit Amazon.com from that machine, you might find that the home page 
includes a fantasy book, popular fantasy book lists, and a section that reviews 
which books you looked at on your last visit! 
So you see, it's not the cookies on your machine that pose the greatest pri-
vacy risks. It's the chance someone will sit down in front of your computer, 
and, upon visiting the sites you've visited, be able to see recommendations that 
are based on things you've purchased or infonnation you've provided in the 
past. 7 
I'll have a lot to say about cookies and marketing in the next chapter, and 
I'll talk more about Amazon.com. But I want to point out something nice 
that Amazon.com does with regards to privacy. They allow you to edit the 
items that influence their recommendations. Just log on to your account, 
click the Your Account button, and scroll down to the section named 
"Recommendations". You'll see a link called "Improve your recommenda-
tions", which will allow you to edit recommendations based on past purchases, 
ratings, and even areas you've visited on Amazon.8 
Third-Party Cookies 
When you browse to a particular site, it may include images or content from 
other web sites. When one of those sites (one you didn't browse to directly) 
tries to set a cookie, it's called a third-party cookie. Third-party cookies come 
in two fonns: Some are used by online stores to process payment infonnation, 
7 One of my reviewers challenged this statement. He wondered, What if the cookie contains your 
Social Security number? Well, it is, of course, possible that a really stupid web site would actually put 
your Sodal Security number in the cookie--but I've never seen this happen. The cookie itself rarely 
contains any useful or personal information by itself--the cookie is best thought of as on index into a 
database on the web server itself. Your private information is stored in that database, and the cookie 
is used to find it. 
8 Of course, the intent of offering these options is that they want you to give them more information 
on what you like so they can offer better recommendations and sell more books. But the flip side 
works too-by telling them not to recommend books on certain topics or based on post purchases, 
people using your computer will no longer see recommendations that are based on information you 
would rather keep private. 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind: What Your Machine Says About You I.Elllr.'_ 
others are used by advertisements to track you online. You'll read more about 
third-party cookies (especially the second kind) in the next chapter. 
Controlling Cookies 
Internet Explorer provides good control over the use of cookies. You can 
decide if cookies are allowed or blocked, or if you want to see a prompt each 
time a web site wants to use a cookie. You can control these for both session 
and permanent cookies. You can also allow or disallow third-party cookies. 
Bring up the Internet Options dialog box again, but this time choose the 
Privacy tab. You'll see the dialog box shown in Figure 12-2.

Clearing Cookies 
The General tab of the Internet Options dialog box (shown earlier in Figure

remove all the cookies on a system. But be sure to read the section later in this 
chapter called "The Files That Wouldn't Die" for instructions on how to make 
sure the cleared cookies are really cleared. 
The Cache (Temporary Internet Files) 
Downloading pages takes time---especially on slower Internet connections. 
One way performance is improved is by using a technique called caching: stor-
ing downloaded information on your computer in case it will be needed later. 
Let's say a page you are viewing has ten images. When you come back to the 
page a week later, your browser looks to see if those images have already been 
downloaded. Finding them in the cache, it displays the images from the cache 
instead of downloading new copies. Internet Explorer will cache entire web 
pages so you can view them after you've disconnected from the Internet-they 
refer to these pages as offline content. 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind: What Your Machine Says About You m. 
Caching can dramatically improve performance, but one side effect is that 
the actual content of many of the web pages you view can be found on your 
computer. 
Deleting the cache is easy.9 The General tab of the Internet Options dialog 
box (shown earlier in Figure 12-1) also contains a Delete Files button. This 
button brings up the Delete Files dialog box shown in Figure 12-4.

Select the "Delete all offline content" check box and then click OK to clear 
the cache. But, be sure to read the next section for instructions on how to 
make sure the temporary fIles you delete are truly deleted. 
The Files That Wouldn't Die 
You can delete your browser history. You can delete cookies. You can delete 
HIes from your cache. You can delete other HIes from your system. 
But guess what? In all the time you've used your computer, you may never 
have actually deleted anything. 
In fact, it's quite difflcult to delete information from your system. 
What Happens When You Delete a File? 
You've just finished working on a school project. It's in a binder and ready to 
tum in. The next morning you can't find it. 
Is it deleted? Of course not. You can probably recover it if you work hard 
enough at searching for it. 
Unfortunately, your dog found it, and dutifully (being a neat dog), grabbed 
it and dropped it into a trash can. It then got thrown out. 
Is it deleted? Not at all. True, you might have to dig through a lot of trash 
to find it, but it still exists. And somebody wandering through the dump could 
fmd it as well. 
9 Each browser you use will have its own cache. The instructions here will only clear the cache used 
by Internet Explorer. 

_ 
... 11:1:':.1 Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
If you actually wanted to delete your school report, you would probably 
need to run it through a really good shredder. 
The Recycle Bin 
When you "delete" fIles using the Windows Explorer, you'll usually see a 
prompt asking if you want to move the fIle to the Recycle Bin. This is a lot like 
lOSing the school project-except it isn't even lost. All you're really doing is 
changing the directory on your computer so the fIle seems to be in a different 
location-a special folder called the Recycle Bin. 
Figure 12-5 is a very rough illustration of how fIles are stored on a disk drive. 
Figure 12-5 A file is stored in the My Documents folder. The folder points to the 
location of Your Data on the hard drive. 
The My Documents folder is in reality a special fIle on your disk called a 
directory. This directory pOints to the location on the disk that contains the 
actual fIle (in this example, the fIle called Your Data). 
When you move a fIle to the Recycle Bin, the data itself rarely moves. 
Instead, the entry for Your Data is removed from the My Documents direc-
tory folder, and an entry is added to the directory called Recycle Bin as shown 
in Figure 12-6. 
You can clear the contents of the Recycle Bin by right-clicking the drive 
letter in the Windows Explorer, choosing Properties, and clicking the button 
named Disk Cleanup. This will give you the option of clearing the Recycle 
Bin. You can also right-click the Recycle Bin itself and choose Empty. 
But this does not delete the fIle. 
Instead, it removes the pointer to the fIle from the Recycle Bin, resulting 
in the situation shown in Figure 12-7. 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind: What Your Machine Says About You '.'Il0l:1;.-. 
Figure 12·6 A file is moved to the Recycle Bin by removing the pointer from the My 
Documents folder and instead pointing to Your Data from the Recycle Bin 
folder. 
Figure 12·7 A file after "deletion"; Though there are no pointers to Your Data, the 
data still exists on the hard drive. 
As you can see, while the system can no longer find the HIe, the data in the 
HIe is still on disk. In fact, even formatting a drive won't necessarily erase the 
data on your drive! 
It goes without saying that there exists software that can examine your 
drive and seek out and reconstruct data, even after it has supposedly been 
deleted. 
Deleting Files-for Reol 
When you delete a HIe, or remove it from the Recycle Bin, you are doing the 
computer equivalent of thrOwing something into the trash and carting it off to 
the dump. The HIe is not destroyed-it's just lost. 

•• 
'iI:II' Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
To really delete a HIe-to actually destroy a HIe-you need a HIe shredding 
program. This is a program that, before deleting a HIe, finds out exactly where 
it is located on your hard drive. It then writes over the data-recording over it 
much as you would record over a cassette or a CD-RW 10 
In fact, the good ones write over the old data multiple times to eliminate 
any possible traces of the previous data. 
And there's better news yet. 
There's an excellent HIe shredder available for free. It's even open source 
for those of you who are programmers who want to see how it works. 
It's called Eraser, and can be found from Heidi Computers Limited at 
http://www.heidLie. (They're an Irish company.) You can download it from 
their web site, or from http://www.sourceforge.net.!1 
It not only erases HIes that you specify, but more important, it can be set to 
simply write random data over unused space on your hard drive. That way, 
instead of having to list HIes to shred before deleting them, you can simply 
delete them as you normally would (including clearing cooldes and the 
Internet cache using the techniques described earlier), then allow Eraser to 
scour the unused areas of your disk-those that now contain the leftover rem-
nants of the HIes you deleted-to make sure that they are well and truly gone. 
Ifl CAUTION As far as I know, Eraser is safe to use. However, as with 
LL.J any program that writes to disk, there are potential risks of data loss 
(especially if it aborts in the middle of an operation because of a system crash or 
power 10ss).As always, good backups are essential. 
The Page File 
Another place where scraps of information can remain on your system is a HIe 
called a page file. It's a large hidden HIe named pageHIe.sys, typically found at 
the root level of the drive that contains your operating system. 
The purpose of this HIe is to trick your software into thinldng you have 
more memory installed than you actually have. Let's say you have 512MB of 
memory installed. Windows might create a 512MB page HIe on disk. Windows 
then acts as if it has 1024MB of memory, swapping data from real memory to 
and from the page HIe. For example, let's say you are using a video editing pro-
gram that can benefit from having 700MB of memory. Well, it doesn't need all 
that memory at once, so Windows will put 512MB of it in real memory, and 
load the rest into the page HIe. Then, as the program runs, anytime it tries to 
access data or run code that isn't in real memory, Windows will load that data 
or code from the page HIe into memory, and swap something else out to the 
page HIe. 
10 Technically speaking. the cossette is the better example, because hard drives, like cassettes, use 
magnetic recording.

The Hibernation File 
Laptop computers by default often have a feature called hibernation enabled. 
Hibernation allows a computer to store the entire contents of memory in a me 
so that your computer can continue from where it leaves off. It's a lot like 
standby, except that it will keep your data even if your battery goes completely 
empty (since the data is stored on disk, not just in memory). 
Of course, your hibernation me will contain whatever information was in 
your computer's memory when it last went into hibernation. 
You can configure your hibernation settings by going to the Control Panel 
and selecting Power Options, which brings up the dialog box in Figure 12-9. 
You can disable hibernation by unchecking the "Enable hibernate support" 
check box on the Hibernate tab. Disabling hibernation should also delete the 
hibernation me on your system, thus reclaiming a substantial amount of disk 
space. 
12 Sorry. I don't know of any way to clear the page file on a Windows 951981ME machine.

How Secure Do You Need to Be? 
Privacy, like other aspects of security, is never an absolute. And at some time 
you reach a point of diminishing returns-where you're spending so much 
time trying to guarantee your privacy that you don't have time to do anything 
else. 
The techniques you've learned in this chapter will allow you to reach a 
level of privacy that will be good enough for most people. It protects you from 
casual visitors and provides limited protection from malicious guests and 
experts. 
But don't expect it to protect you from a visit from the NSA,l3 
13 National Security Agency, or the FBI, CIA, or similar organizations. Their computer security experts 
are good, and the steps taught here will still leave scraps of information that they can find--
for example, fragments of old files left over in unused space within the disk space used by an 
existing file.

Privacy Software 
There are a number of companies that sell software that is designed to help 
you protect your privacy. These programs can be helpful, in that they can warn 
you about privacy issues and provide varying degrees of automatic protection. 
However, you don't need to spend money on privacy software to achieve a 
high degree of privacy. Most of what these programs do is perform tasks that 
you can do for yourself-those described in this chapter. 
I tend to prefer the techniques described in this chapter for a number of 
reasons: 
• Except for HIe shredding, you don't need to install another piece of 
software to use these techniques. That means they work on any 
machine (including public terminals). 
• Software bundles often include features you don't want, and some of 
their components may have side effects. 
• Everything described in this chapter can be done for free. 
But there is no doubt that some of the available applications can prOvide 
additional privacy and automate the tasks described in this chapter. 
Dozens of these programs are available. Here are a few of the more 
popular: 
Webroot Privacy Software 
Acronis Privacy Expert 
McMee Internet Security Suite 
Norton Internet Security

Encryption: Privacy for Data You Want 
to Keep 
Everything you've read so far in this chapter relies on your deleting informa-
tion in order to keep it private. After all, if information is truly deleted, nobody 
else can find it. What about information you want to keep that you don't want 
others to see? 
The answer is to encrypt the HIes. This scrambles the HIes on your disk so 
that only people who know a password can read them. 

_ .. 
'li:0ii*:.' Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
There are dozens (hundreds?) of flle encryption programs available 
(do a Coogle.com search under "File encryption" for a list or visit 
http://www.sofotex.com/download/Security/File_Encryption).14 
Many of these are shareware products in the $20--$70 range, and I am 
reluctant to recommend one-not because they are shareware (I have no 
problem with shareware), but because I do not have enough experience with 
anyone to recommend it over another. Nor, based on reviews and information 
I have available, does one seem to stand out over the others. So I'd suggest if 
you really are interested in flle encryption that you download some of the trial 
versions and see what you like. 
Built-in E.ncryption: Windows 2000 and XP 
Windows 2000 and XP have support for flle encryption built into the operating 
system. However, instead of encrypting each flle with a password, they encrypt 
flles and directories using a private key associated with a particular user 
(Windows creates the key for you and stores it in a safe place on the disk-you 
don't get to specify your own password). 
As long as the user account is protected with a password, any flles 
encrypted by that user can only be viewed by that user, because the hidden 
key that Windows created for you can only be used by a person logged on with 
this user account. 
If you take this approach, be sure to export a copy of the private key and 
save it somewhere (on a floppy disk or CD). That's because 
If the private key associated with the user is ever lost. 
you yourself will never lS be able to read those files. 
And yes-a private key can be lost in many ways: 
• ACcidentally or intentionally deleting the user account (or if a virus or 
Trojan does so). 
• If you have to restore, repair, or reinstall your operating system, it is 
possible that user account data, including the private key, can be lost. 
• Bugs in applications can cause the private key to be changed, making 
existing encrypted flles unreadable. 
Be sure your computer has 128-bit encryption installed. The default 56-bit 
encryption is not veI)' secure. 
You can read about this built-in encryption in Windows help if you're 
interested. It will explain how to save your key to a floppy disk. 
I . V;sitAlwaysUseProtection.com for updated links-these are subject to change. 
15 Never. when it comes to 12B-bit encryption, means there ;s no practical way to ever recover the 
information--even if your best friend has a bunch of supercomputers at hand. 

Chapter 12 The Traces You Leave Behind:WhatYour Machine SaysAboutYou '.'II:j:PWII'_ 
I personally do not recommend this approach. I prefer password-based 
schemes-they provide good security with less risk of accidentally losing all 
your information. 
Laptop Encryption 
Laptop theft is a much greater problem than computer theft in general (both 
because laptops are so much easier to steal, and because desktop computers 
are so cheap that it's hardly worth the trouble). To protect your privacy, many 
laptop manufacturers have built-in password-based encryption. 
Review the documentation for your laptop to find out if it supports this 
feature. 
Stepping Out 
In this chapter, you learned how to protect your privacy by obscuring the 
tracks you leave behind on your computer. But this is only the first step. Mter 
all, once you start using the Internet, every time your computer interacts with 
another computer, you start leaving traces behind on that computer as well. 
What form those traces can take, and what people can do with them, may 
astonish you. 
But that's a subject for the next chapter.

Every Move You Make, 
They'll Be Watching You 
In 1975, an author named John Brunner published an astonishing science fic-
tion book titled The Shockwave Rider. In it, he made a number of predictions 
that have largely come true with regards to the Internet and its impact on soci-
ety. Other predictions have not come true-but it's still early.l 
One of the major issues in this book is the tension between privacy and 
utility. 
Put your contact information on the Net-so people will be able to reach 
you via phone, fax, e-mail, pager, or 1M regardless of where you go. 
So now they can trace your movements. 
Put your medical information online, so if you're ill or in an accident, doc-
tors can get your records quickly and help you. 
So now they can deny you employment or insurance based on those 
records. Maybe someday they won't allow you on a ride at an amusement park 
because your medical record suggests you may not be able to handle it. 
Put your school records online so potential employers or colleges can get 
your records and make decisions qUickly. 
Should a disciplinary incident when you were a high school freshman 
really be on your record for the rest of your life? Or public information if there 
is a security breach? This adds new meaning to the term permanent record. 
Put your relationship preferences online, and the Net will help you make 
new friends. List your friends online to help you make new friends. Use rec-
ommendations on online stores to let your friends get discounts on products 
you think they'll like. Store your buddy lists and address book online so you 
can contact your friends easily. 
Now they know who your friends are also. 
, Recently the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) discontinued an experimental 
program due to political pressure. This program would have allowed people to gamble on the likeli-
hood of future terrorist events-a sort of futures market of politics. The theory ;s that such a market 
would heJp predict the likelihood of such events, making n easier to prevent them. I won't bet they got 
the idea from this book, but n wouldn't surprise me-it's there in black and whne. 

."'!I-'-. Part II ProteaingYour Privacy 
Sure, the various web sites you visit promise varying degrees of confiden-
tiality-but if there's one thing you know having read this book, it's that even 
the best of these sites are vulnerable. So even if a web site isn't intentionally 
selling what they know about you to everyone in sight, it's still possible that the 
information you give them will get out. 
Convenience and utility versus privacy. It's a tough problem. 
Hypermarketing 
So who are "they"-those folks who can use the Internet to track your move-
ments, your interests, your friends? 
Well, that depends on a lot of things, including your own personal level of 
paranoia. If you're a Libertarian or antigovernment survivalist, "they" might 
refer to the government. "They" becomes 1984'S2 "Big Brother"-the all-inva-
sive government that watches your every move. 
For some of you, "they" refers to the RlAA,3 an organization that is spend-
ing a great deal of money to track down what HIes you download and share 
with others under the theory that the best way to ensure the loyalty and sup-
port of customers is to sue them. 
But there is one "they" that applies to virtually everyone who uses the 
Internet. 
"They" are companies who are trying to sell you something. 
These companies work hard to accumulate as much information as they 
possibly can about you so they can figure out better ways to sell you stuff. 
Their methods range from helpful (product recommendations), to annoying 
(spam and pop-ups), to downright invasive (adware, spyware, and hijacking 
your browser). 
In the rest of this chapter, you'll learn more about the ways "they" collect 
information and track you online, and the things you can do to maintain vary-
ing degrees of privacy. 
But before getting further into the privacy issues, r d like to invite you to 
join me on a visit to the site that I believe best demonstrates hypermarketing. 
Amazon. com 
If you want a taste of what Internet marketing is going to be like in the future, 
all you need to do is look at Amazon.com today. They are, without a doubt, the 
most innovative marketers on the Internet. 
l 1984 ;s George Orwell's classic book. whose predictions, thankfully, haven't come quite as true as 
those in Brunner's The Shockwave Rlder--but it's still early.

(or the past few years 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You .. 
Think of some of the things they do already: 
• They keep track of what you buy and what you view, in order to offer 
you recommendations for other products that might interest you. 
• They examine buying patterns oflarge groups of customers to generate 
recommendations. For example, if many people who buy this book 
also end up buying one of my other books, How Computer 
Programming Works, people who look at this book will see a note 
like "People who bought Always Use Protection also bought How 
Computer Programming Works." They'll also offer package deals-
allowing you to buy both at a discount. 
• They have buying circles, allowing you to find out what members of a 
group are buying. For example, what books or videos are popular 
among Microsoft employees? What books are popular in New York 
City? 
• When you buy from Amazon.com, they allow you to forward 
recommendations to friends, offering them a discount in the process 
(and helping them determine who your friends are). 
• They have an affiliate program, allOwing anyone with a web site to 
make money by promoting sales on Amazon.com. 
• They allow readers to offer feedback and customer reviews, making it 
easier for people to figure out which books are best for their needs.4 
• They have recently added the capability of searching through the text 
of books, making it easier to find books if you don't know the title. 
Now, make no mistake, I am a huge fan of Amazon.com.5 I've found the 
site incredibly helpful in finding books and DVDs I like. Their product recom-
mendations, since they are based on information from thousands of customers, 
have often introduced me to books, authors, and fllms that I would never have 
found otherwise, and ended up liking a great deal. 
But what about the privacy issues? 
I encourage all of you to visit Amazon.com's section on privacy. You can 
find it by going to the help department and selecting the link for privacy and 
security. 
In this section, you'll learn how to update and remove recommendations, 
and how to be sure you've "logged out" of Amazon.com so the computer 
you're on won't assume you're a returning visitor. You'll also be able to read in 
-4 By the way, those reviews are important to authors-so if you do like the book. I would be incredibly 
grateful if you would post your comments on Amazon.com, or other review sites. If you don't like the 
book. obviously I'd prefer you keep your mouth shut-but hey, it's still a free country (for those of you 
who Jive in free countries), so "" respect your choice either way. 
S And not just because , made a few thousand dollars on their stock. of which, for the record, I still 
own about I SO shares at the time I'm writing this 

•• 
flll.' Part /I Protect.ingYour Privacy 
detail Amazon.com's policies regarding information they obtain, and how and 
when they might share it and use it. 
So, there only remain two questions: 
I. Do you believe what they say? 
2. Do you trust that they can keep their own systems secure? 
For what it's worth, I do believe their privacy statement. This is for two 
reasons: 
I. The privacy statement is so thorough and specific that it's clear they've 
invested a great deal of thought in the problem. 
2. If they start violating their privacy policies, sooner or later someone 
will find that out and it will become public. That would be a public 
relations disaster that I don't believe Amazon.com would want to risk, 
not to mention an invitation for numerous lawsuits. 
As to whether they are able to keep their systems secure-well, you should 
know by now that no system is absolutely secure. So, if you truly want to buy 
something anonymously, you may be better off going to a store where nobody 
knows you and paying cash (of course, many stores nowadays have cameras 
monitoring customers, so there is a limit to privacy there as well). 
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
The Federal government enforces a law called COPPA-the Children's Online 
Privacy Protection Act. This law imposes specific requirements on any web 
site that either targets children or knOwingly welcomes children to visit. These 
requirements apply to the kinds of information the site can collect and the way 
it collects that information, and requires the site implement a way to obtain 
parental consent before obtaining information. There are additional require-
ments relating to when and how a site can sell or distribute the information it 
collects. 
Oh, by the way, a "child" for the purposes of COPPA is anyone under 13. 
That's why many mainstream web sites require people using the site to be 13 
or older. By stating that only those 13 or older may participate, these sites 
don't have to comply with the restrictive COPPA requirements. 
So, if you're 13 or older, you're an adult as far as this particular law is con-
cerned. And since this book is intended primarily for teens and older, this is 
the last I'll be saying about COPPA. Those of you who are teens with younger 
Siblings or parents of younger children can read more about COPPA at 
http://www.ftc.gov/privacy.

How They Track You, and What You 
Can Do to Prevent It 
The first step to understanding how to protect your privacy online is to under-
stand the various ways that you can be tracked. 
Cookies Revisited 
In the last chapter, you learned what cookies are, and how they let a web 
server recognize that two different requests come from the same computer. 
Now, r d like to take this idea one step further. Take a look at the partial 
web page shown in Figure 13-1. 
Figure 13-1 Web page example from Bayarea.com 
This is a page header for Bayarea.com-home of the San Jose Mercury 
News (my local newspaper). Take a look at the banner on the upper right. This 
banner is an image. But where did the image come from? 
When a browser requests a web page, it first retrieves all of the text on the 
page. Then it needs to make separate requests for each image. And those 
images don't have to be on the same site that hosts the text. In this case, the 
banner comes from the following URL: 
http://m3.doub1ec1ick.net/viewad/827910/4-468x60_newredcopy.gif 
What is the San Jose Mercury News web site doing linking to an image on 
DoubleClick.net? 
DoubleClick is an Internet marketing company that provides advertising 
services to many web sites. There are many such companies. When you 
browse to a web site that uses DoubleClick, your browser makes a separate 
request for the image from the DoubleClick.net web site. This allows 
DoubleClick to record information about the request, and to place a Double-
Click cookie on your computer. 
When you browse to one site, but it contains links to images on other sites 
that try to set a cookie, those cookies from other sites are called third-party 

___ 
Ir.Ii'ZI. Part" Protecting Your Privacy 
cookies.6 When third-party cookies are used to track your movement and build 
up a database of the sites you visit, they are often called tracking cookies. 
Imagine an advertising web site called AdServer.com.7 Let's say 
AdServer.com has contracted with three other companies to do their advertis-
ing-a car company (trying to sell a car), a movie production company (trying 
to sell a movie), and a magazine publisher (trying to sell a magazine). 
Meanwhile, two different local newspapers have contracted with 
AdServer.com to provide banner advertising. To understand the finances, 
here's how the money flows: 
• The car company pays AdServer.com to advertise a car. 
• The movie company pays AdServer.com to advertise a movie. 
• The magazine publisher pays AdServer.com to advertise a news 
magazine. 
• Meanwhile, the local newspaper web sites (in this example 
NewsWebsitel.com and NewsWebsite2.com) are paid by 
AdServer.com for displaying the ads.8 
So let's follow the sequence of what happens (numbers refer to the num-
bered arrows in Figure 13-2). 
Your Computer 
Cookies :AdServer. com- XVZ 
AdServer. com 
Figure 13-2 How ad servers work 
6 Depending on your perspective, either you or the site you're visiting is the first party-the other is 
the second party. The sites they link to, that you didn't explicitly browse to, are the third parties. 
7 There is such a company, and they do the kind or thing described here--but for this example I'm 
not referring to the specific company but rother to any company that does online ad serving. 
S This is a bit of a simpUfication. In practice, the sites are otten paid only when someone dicks the ads. 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You __ 
I. First you visit NewsWebsitel.com. Your browser downloads the text, 
and then sees an image link to AdServer.com. 
2. Your browser then requests the image from AdServer.com. Because 
this is your first visit to AdServer.com, they request your computer 
store a cookie on your machine. Let's call this third-party cookie XYZ. 
AdServer.com then sends a random image (because they don't know 
anything about you yet). In this example, they send the car ad, which 
you then see on the web page. AdServer.com records in their database 
the fact that cookie XYZ came from someone who visited 
NewsWebsitel.com. 
3. Later on, you visit NewsWebsite2.com. Your browser downloads the 
text, and then sees an image link to AdServer.com. 
4. Your browser then requests the image from AdServer.com. Seeing a 
cookie for AdServer.com, it sends the XYZ cookie with the request. 
AdServer.com sees the cookie and looks it up in its database. It notices 
that you had previously visited NewsWebsitel.com, and concludes that 
you're interested in the news. It then looks in its lists of ads and 
discovers that one of its advertisers is trying to sell a news magazine-a 
perfect match for your interests. So this time it sends the image of the 
news magazine to your browser. 
As you browse more and more sites, advertising services can build a very 
sophisticated picture of who you are and what you are interested in-based on 
the sites you visit. The more ethical advertising servers don't keep personally 
identifiable information (Le., they only know who you are based on the cookie 
they see when you request an ad-they don't know your name and e-mail 
address).9 However, once you provide personal information to a site (by log-
ging in or registering), it becomes possible for a less ethical company or adver-
tiser to track who you are. Next thing you know you may be getting calls or 
e-mails that have an eerie knowledge of your interests. 
Fortunately, it's quite easy to protect your privacy from this type of track-
ing. The techniques for blocking cookies (described in the previous chapter) 
work just fine. Be sure you specify the Prompt or Block option for all third-
party cookies, and if set to Prompt, just deny permission to any that aren't 
obviously important for what you want to do. 
Also, some spyware and adware prevention software can detect and 
remove tracking cookies as well. You'll read more about that later in this 
chapter. 
9 Which advertisers are ethical? Well, if you visit the DoubleClick.net web site, you can read their pri-
vacy policy and decide for yourself. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt--at least they 
have a privacy policy.

"~I:'. Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
Log Files 
Anytime a request comes in from a web browser, the web server receives 
information that it can save for future reference. Among the information it 
can log is 
• Your computer's IP address 
• Your computer's host and domain name (if it has one) 
• The type and version of browser that you're using 
• Any information you filled out on a form when you made the request 
• In some cases, the URL of the referring site (the one you clicked from 
to get to the site filling the request) 
• Any cookies set by the site 
• And, of course, the time, date, and page being requested 
This information is typically used by web masters to calculate statistics on 
the numbers of visitors. Some of these are obvious (time, date, page, and 
information on a form). But some raise privacy issues as well. An important 
one is your IP address-which we'll look at in the next section. 
Your Browser 
The type and version of browser is most often used to allow web sites to send 
the correct information to your browser. For one thing, different browsers 
support different features. For example, if a site is using an ActiveX control, 
they might first make sure you're using Internet Explorer-because ActiveX 
controls won't work on other browsers. If you're using an older browser ver-
sion, a web site might send a simpler version of a web page, avoiding newer 
features that could cause the page to display incorrectly. 
The URL of the Referring Site 
When you click a web link, the site you visit also typically receives the URL of 
the site that contains the link. In other words, a web site can find out where 
you're coming from and log that information. This can prOvide valuable mar-
keting information to a site (if they see that many visitors are coming for a par-
ticular search engine, they might increase their advertising on that search 
engine). There isn't much you can do about this, but it's not a particularly seri-
ous issue for most people. 
Information You Provide 
It's sort of obvious-if you provide any information to a web site, they will 
store it. They may then use it for marketing pUlposes, or it might be stolen 
from them (if the web site is hacked), or they may sell it. Later in this chapter 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You ." .. '1l1li'_ 
you'll read more about strategies for limiting the amount of personal informa-
tion you give. 
Privacy and Your IP Address 
You already know that your IP address is the "phone number" of your com-
puter-it uniquely identifies your computer on the Internet at any given time. 
A web site has to have your IP address-without it, the page will never find its 
way back to your computer. 
Marketers rarely use a computer's IP address to identify you. That's for two 
reasons: 
I. Computers that dial up to the Internet and many DSL lines use 
dynamic IP addresses. That means that each time you dial up, you get a 
different IP address. 
2. Just as a NAT-based router allows an IP address to be shared among 
many computers, companies often use something called a proxy server 
to allow potentially hundreds of computers to share an IP address. 
Because IP addresses are often shared, they can't be used reliably to iden-
tify a computer over time-they are only good for identifying a computer dur-
ing a particular request. Cookies are much better for identifying computers, 
because they are stored on the computer. 
Marketers can sometimes use IP addresses, however, to identify what 
country you're connecting from or what Internet service provider you're using. 
For example, if they see a request coming from a block of IP addresses that 
belong to AOL, they can conclude that you're an AOL customer. Another 
Internet service provider might pay an advertising company to deliver ads to 
current AOL customers using this information. 
Tracing an IP Address 
Just because marketers rarely use IP addresses to keep track of you doesn't 
mean that it isn't possible to do. 
• If you have a fixed IP address (common with some DSL, cable modem, 
and Tl connections), the IP address can reliably identify your 
computer or local network. 
• Some routers and proxy servers (devices that allow sharing of an IP 
address among different machines) create logs that could allow specific 
Internet requests to be traced back to a particular computer. 
• Internet service providers that allocate IP addresses dynamically can 
log each time an IP address is allocated to a user, meaning that given 
an IP address and date, an Internet request can be tracked back to a 
particular user. 

__ 
J ... n... Part" Protecting Your Privacy 
Ultimately this means that if someone gives your Internet service provider 
an IP address and time and date, there is an excellent chance they'll be able to 
tell which machine is at that IP address and who owns the account used-for 
example, your AOL or MSN account information. 
Because only your ISP has easy access to this information, the risks to your 
privacy come from two sources: 
I. Your ISP may choose to monitor the sites you visit to build their own 
database of marketing information. This is a particularly invasive kind 
of monitoring because they not only know what web sites you're 
visiting, they also have all your personal information that you used 
when you created the account. Check the privacy policy of your ISP to 
see if they use this information for marketing purposes. 
2. Government agencies can obtain this information by using the judicial 
system. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) makes it easy 
for corporations to subpoena ISPs for information that connects IP 
addresses to user accounts. This is a major tool that the RIAA is using 
to develop lists of people to sue for fIle sharing. 
Anonymous Surfing 
There are services that provide anonymous surfing. The way they do this is 
quite simple in principle. They have a network of anonymous servers. You con-
tact them, and they forward your web page request to the site you specify, and 
return the result back to you. They don't create any log fIles, so ultimately the 
IP request stored on the final destination site is that of the anonymous server, 
and not yours. As long as you trust the service to not create any log fIles, you 
have a high degree of privacy. 
Check out http://www • anonymizer • com for information on anonymous web 
surfing. 10 
Hidden Image Tracking 
Hidden images are used to track e-mail messages. In Chapter 3, you learned 
about HTML e-mail, and how it can in some cases allow attacks against a sys-
tem. You also know that HTML can contain image links, and those image links 
cause a browser to make a separate request to download the image. 
So here's what spammers do. 
They include in an e-mail message a tiny picture-one only 1 pixel in 
size-so small you won't even see it. The image URL points to a web site 
belonging to the spammer, and they add to each image request additional 
tracking information that identifies the original e-mail. 
10 Watch for more information on this topiC on AlwoysUseProtection.com. 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You ~ 
When you read the e-mail, your e-mail reader requests the hidden image. 
It also sends along as part of the request a code that identifies the original 
e-mail address to which the message was sent. The spammer detects the 
request and logs the information. What information? 
• They know your e-mail address, and that the e-mail address is good 
(since you've just read the message). So they will probably keep 
sending you spam. 
• They have a chance to try to place a cookie on your system (when your 
browser requests the image, the web site containing the image can 
store a cookie on your system if you're allowing third-party cookies). 
• They know your IP address. 
They can then sell this information to other spammers or to marketing 
firms. 
A spam filter will generally allow you to preview messages without down-
loading hidden images, and this is actually one of the best reasons to use a 
spam fllter (even beyond filtering out the spam messages). 
Spyware and Adware 
Way back in Chapter 2, you learned about spyware and adware. In that chap-
ter, you read about the security aspects of spyware and adware. You discovered 
that 
• Spyware can monitor your keyboard activity, potentially sending 
everything you type (including account names and passwords) to an 
attacker. 
• Web page trackers can monitor your browsing activity, sending a record 
of the sites you visit to an attacker. 
• Spyware and adware can eat up your Internet bandwidth, slOwing 
download speeds and causing severe lag or dropouts when playing 
online games. 
• Spyware and adware can download and bring up annoying pop-up 
ads-regardless of the web page you're viSiting-and sometimes even 
when you aren't browsing the Internet. 
• When you agree to download adware, you probably won't read the 
license agreements. But if you do, you'll be astonished at what you're 
agreeing to. For example, you may be allowing them to update the 
software-meaning they can run any program they want on your 
computer. You may be agreeing to not remove or disable their 
software. 

_.a;JI:l;'I. Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
• Spyware can watch your online activity and bring up ads or special offers 
based on sites you visit. Sometimes these can be quite aggressive. For 
example, a hypothetical computer company called Joe's Computers 
could plant spyware on your system, and bring up an ad for their 
computers anytime you visit another computer company's site. A 
bookseller could detect when you're visiting Amazon.com and t!)' to 
redirect you to their site instead. 
Spyware can intercept your web requests, placing their affiliate code in the 
requests to t!)' to make money off your shopping. Here's how it works: 
• Many web sites (like Amazon.com) offer referral fees. This means that 
anytime someone reaches that web site through a referral from another 
site, the owner of the referring site makes a small commission on each 
sale. 
• In many cases, you can benefit from this. For example, if your school is 
Signed up through Schoolpop.com, anytime you shop using a link from 
Schoolpop.com, Schoolpop.com receives the affiliate fee and gives part 
of it to your school. 
• Some spyware attempts to bypass this by sneaking their own affiliate 
code into the request. This can prevent the referring site from 
receiving the commission. In this case, it could prevent your school 
from receiving benefits from your purchase. 
Now, here's where things get into a gray area. Schoolpop.com itself had a 
program called the Schoolpop Shopping Buddy, 11 which it described thus: 
Schoolpop Shopping Buddy is a memo!), tool that ensures more 
of your online shopping supports your school. By downloading 
Schoolpop Shopping Buddy any purchase you make with a School-
pop online merchant will generate a rebate to your school, even 
when you forget to shop through http://www.schoolpop.com. You'll 
also have easy access to Schoolpop merchants, and your school and 
account information. 
Hmm .. . a tool that watches where you're shopping, and makes sure that 
your Schoolpop.com affiliate code is automatically inserted when you shop at 
certain sites. Sure sounds like spyware to me! But you see, not all spyware and 
adware is necessarily bad. Like many tools, the techniques employed by spy-
ware can be used for both good and evil. It's up to you to decide which of 
these you'll allow on your system. 
I I At the time this book was published. the Schoolpop Shopping Buddy was no longer available for 
download. According to their site. this is because of the difficulty of supporting the program over the 
many different versions of operating systems and browsers now commonly in use.

St0'PPing Spyware and Adware 
Before you can decide what spyware and adware you wish to allow on a sys-
tem, you need to know what spyware and adware is actually installed on your 
system. 
Antivirus software isn't the right tool for this job. You see, antivirus soft-
ware is deSigned to eradicate viruses. There's no gray area here-if it's a virus, 
you want to kill it. Period. 
But spyware and adware fall into a gray area. Sometimes such programs 
are useful-making it easier to donate money to a cause, or helping you find a 
cheaper price when shopping online. 
Generally speaking, the antivirus companies target spyware that is known 
to be malicious-the kind that spreads itself like a virus. They don't generally 
target spyware and adware that you yourself install. 
But in many cases, you might install programs without realizing you're 
doing so. 
Fortunately, a number of programs are available that can help you track 
down not only spyware and adware, but also identify and remove common 
tracking cookies from ad server companies. 
One of the best is a program called Ad-aware, whose basic version 
(adequate for home use) is free. Visit http://www.lavasoftusa.com or 
http://www .lavasoft • nu for more information and download instructions. 
Ad-aware works much like an antivirus program, except that it reports pro-
grams and cookies that are privacy risks rather than viruses. 
Another popular antispyware program is Spybot Search and Destroy, which 
is also free. Visit http://www • safer -networking. org for more information. 
Also, unlike antivirus programs, these programs don't use active scanning 
(they generally scan only when you ask them to), so it's usually safe to have 
them both installed on the same system at once. One may catch spyware that 
the other misses. 
Note that like antivirus programs, there is a risk that some of your applica-
tions will stop working after using these tools. It's possible, though unlikely, 
that they will damage your system software as well, so you should use the same 
backup precautions you use with antivirus software. 
P2P Clients 
Like most of you reading this, I am what would traditionally be called a "law-
abiding citizen." Sometimes the laws can be quite perplexing-especially 
when it comes to the problem of P2p12 networks such as Kazaa, Grokster, etc. 
I mean, what does one make of a law that routinely turns tens of millions 
of people into criminals? 
12 P2P stands for peer-to-peer.ln a P2P network. different computers communicate directly with 
each other. without going through a central server. For example. when you download a file from 
Kazoo, your computer is connected through the Internet directly to the computer from which you're 
downloading the file. 

_.a4 ... 1.' Part /I ProteaingYour Privacy 
Seriously, right now our society is engaged in a major conflict-the kind 
that will provide no end of annoyance to history students 50 years from now 
when they study how it was resolved.13 How much is content such as music, 
video, and software worth? What are the rights of developers of content? 
What are the rights of those using the content? How much control will 
individuals have over their personal information? It's corporations versus indi-
viduals. It's government versus both corporation and individuals. It's Microsoft 
versus Linux and open source. 
I'm much better at asking the questions than offering answers. 
But because I am a law-abiding citizen, I've tried to follow the principle in 
this book of not encouraging or showing readers how to break the law. I mean, 
this book is about protecting yourself from lawbreakers, right? 
So I'm going to follow that principle as best I can, and leave it for you to 
figure out how to apply what I say to your individual situation and values. 14 
Kazaa 
You can't talk about spyware and adware without talking about Kazaa. My own 
surveys show about 90 percent of the teens I polled have it and use it (or 
Grokster, which is comparable). 
Kazaa and Grokster come in two flavors. The free one is adware. For $20 
or $30, you can buy an ad-free version. 
Figure 13-3 shows the main Ad-aware window display after a scan on a sys-
tem immediately after the free version of Kazaa is installed (before the scan, 
the system was checked out completely clean).

_.:.J.:.:,t .•• Part /I Protecting Your Privacy 
So, here's the deal: If you've installed Kazaa or Grokster, you have just seri-
ously compromised your privacy. Based on the experiences of friends of mine, 
you've also slowed your system down for general Internet use and online gam-
ing. And while turning off Kazaa will help, it won't eliminate the problem. The 
spyware and adware continues to run even when Kazaa doesn't. 
Being a law-abiding citizen, let me tell you what you can't do . 
• You can't just use Ad-aware to disable the spyware. First, when you 
downloaded Kazaa, you agreed not to do so. (Remember those license 
agreements you didn't bother to read?) Second, Kazaa will detect 
wholesale deletion of the spyware and will stop working . 
• You also can't download one of the free Kazaa-compatible clients such 
as Kazaa-Lite (also known as KLite or Kazaa Lite K++). Even though 
it's fully compatible with the Kazaa network, and is completely ad free, 
it violates the Kazaa license and is illegal to use (it says so in the license 
agreement that comes with the software). Because of the ongoing legal 
disputes (which seem to change daily and go from country to country), 
it's not clear how long it will remain available, or where you can find it. 
However, various search engines would undoubtedly help you fmd a 
download site should it ever become legal for you to download and use 
the software. 
You can, however, purchase an ad-free version of Kazaa or Grokster 
directly from them. You can also check out other P2P communities-the pop-
ularity of different networks varies, and both the technology and the latest 
legal escapades change weekly. 
By the way, should you decide to uninstall Kazaa, be sure to run Ad-aware 
or a similar program after you do the uninstall and delete the spyware and 
cookies that it leaves behind. 
Also, remember that if you leave flle sharing on15 and allow your computer 
to act as a supernode, you increase your risks of being sued by the RIAA.16 You 
can visit the Electronic Frontier Foundation's web site at http://www.eff .org 
for further information on how not to get sued by the RIAA (I'll have links to 
this on AlwaysUseProtection.com as well). 
Parental and Employer Controls 
Another form of useful spyware is parental control software. It's software that 
is used by some parents to monitor their kids' behavior online. This software 
15 If your client doesn't allow you to turn offfile shoring. simply delete files from your shored files 
folder. 
16 As of the publication dote of this book. the RlAA was only suing people who shore music for others 
to download. However. downloading is also illegal, so they could choose to sue people who download 
music as well--assuming they can find them. 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You IX •• 
(sometimes called nannyware) monitors web activity and e-mail, Hlters the 
content of web pages, and blocks access to inappropriate web sites. 
Now, frankly I don't know any teenagers who like the idea of parental con-
trol software. I know very few who have it. 
But I'm also not going to get in the middle of an argument on this particu-
lar issue. The use of parental control software is a matter of discussion 
between teens and their parents. If it's there, it's presumably there with the 
agreement of both sides, and thus qualifies as spyware that is installed inten-
tionally.17 
Some businesses have this kind of software installed on their employees' 
computers as well. This is likely to be a condition of employment and not sub-
ject to discussion. 
It's OK to Lie:Web Sites and 
Newsgroups 
Cookies and spyware represent technological means that marketers and others 
have of tracking you and finding out about you. But nothing is better (from a 
marketer's viewpoint) than information you give to them voluntarily. 
Just as spammers use tempting e-mail to try to get you to open and 
respond to their message, marketers try to tempt you to respond and give 
them information that will help them sell to you. 
What kind of things do they want? 
• Your name and address, of course 
• Your e-mail address and phone number 
• Your age 
• Your gender 
• Your hobbies or interests 
• Your income level 
You would be astonished at the level of detail they can go into. They build 
models of what people are likely to buy. For example, they might know that

16- to I8-year-old guys who live in a certain neighborhood in a particular city 
are likely to buy a specific album from a new hip-hop artist. So when they find 
out that you're one of those people, you'll suddenly start seeing web site ads 
and spam trying to sell you that album. And you know what-there's a good 
chance it will work. Then you'll become part of their online database used to 
help sell something to the next person. And so on. 
In Chapter 10, you learned about the tricks that can be used to try to 
obtain your personal information. Here the issue is much more simple: What 
information should you provide to legitimate sites when they ask for it? 
They'" Take What You Give Them 
Generally speaking, there are four major ways that legitimate web sites try to 
obtain marketing information: 
• They ask for it during registration to the site. 
• They ask for it when you request information (perhaps you're 
requesting information on a product, or sending a request for online 
help, or signing up for an online newsletter). 
• They ask for it by getting you to sign up for contests. 
• They ask for it in the form of surveys. 
Let's briefly look at each of these. 
Site Registration or Requesting Information 
Most web sites where you register request more information than they need. 
The best web sites will label which information is required and which is 
optional. It's up to you which optional information you provide. The more you 
prOvide, the more likely it is they will market products to you that interest 
you-and you might actually want that. 
You might want to check their privacy policy first, to see what they do with 
that information. 
Free Services 
A number of web sites offer a variety of free services, such as online calendars, 
greeting cards, and so forth. Before you use them, be sure to check their pri-
vacy policy. 
For example, I once received a greeting card e-mail from a friend. Upon 
further research, I discovered (by reading their license and privacy statement) 
that in order to see the card, I would have to download their greeting card 
software (including an ActiveX control) that would leave spyware permanently 
installed on my system. 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'/I Be Watching You '.,)I;.J'PIiII'_ 
I sent an e-mail to my friend thanking her for the card, but explaining why 
I would not be able to view it. 
Greeting cards and discount referral programs can be especially risky, 
because not only might they capture your e-mail address-they capture your 
friends' addresses as well. 
Contests 
Companies don't run contests because they like giving things away. They run 
contests because it's the cheapest way for them to get the information they 
want. They expect to make far more money using that information than the 
contest costs them. 
Remember, entering a contest gives them a lot of information. They know 
you're interested in the contest, the site that hosts the contest, and probably 
the prize. They have your contact information, often name, address, phone 
number, and e-mail (required to notify you if you win). They may have your 
age and birth date. That's a lot of information they can use or sell. 
So, before entering a contest, check out what they say they'll do with the 
information, decide if you trust them, and then enter or not as you see fit. 
Polls and Surveys 
Many people participate in various online polls and surveys. They don't seem 
to pose much risk, since they are anonymous, right? 
True, you usually don't give them contact information. But remember: 
They do know what site you came from, they do get your IP address, and they 
may have a cookie set on your machine. 
So they do have enough information to add you to an ad tracking system. 
They do potentially have the information needed to trace the entry back to 
your machine via IP address. And, it's certainly possible to cross-reference 
other databases and potentially tie your contact information to the other infor-
mation they just acquired. 
However, polls and surveys from reputable sites (like news organizations) 
are low risk. They are more interested in your opinion than in selling you 
something (because what they are selling is the statistics that you help gener-
ate-not your individual opinion). 
Little White Lies 
As you learned in Chapter 10, some information is more important than other. 
A good web site will request the absolute minimum information needed to 
support the web site's features. For example, if you're asking to join a mailing 
list, all they need is your e-mail address. If you want information by mail, they 
should allow you to specify your mailing address without your phone number. 
Unfortunately, many sites ask for more information than they really need. 
In those cases, you may want to lie in order to protect your privacy. Be sure 

_-.;1'11;1,.' Part II ProteaingYour Privacy 
not to lie in any place where you're stating in an agreement that you have told 
the truth (such as credit applications, job applications, etc.). 
Birth Date 
If a site is offering a gift or prize on your birthday, you should give them your 
birth date-as long as you really trust that they will keep that information 
secure and not sell it. Otherwise, pick a different date but keep the same birth 
year. That way you keep the age correct, but don't give away the personal 
information that can be used later for identity theft if it gets out. 
E-Mail Address 
Unless you're joining an e-mail list, or speCifically want to receive e-mail from 
a site, feel free to give them a fake e-mail address. Be aware that some sites 
will use e-mail addresses to send you password reminder information if you 
forget your login-so if you're registering for a site that you intend to use reg-
ularly, give them a valid e-mail address. 
Some people use names like nospam@nospam.com or other random 
names. Some people create free e-mail accounts on Hotmail or Yahoo and 
then use those as "throwaway" e-mail addresses. 
Never, never, never post your real e-mail account on a public newsgroup or 
forum. That's like begging spammers to target you. They use automatic pro-
grams that check the Web and newsgroups, searching for e-mail addresses that 
they can mail to. 
If you must post your e-mail to a forum or newsgroup, don't post it in stan-
dard format-write it out. For example, Joe at some domain dot com. 
Spammers have a harder time finding this type of format (though it's not 
impossible) . 
Phone and Fax Numbers 
When lying about phone or fax numbers, choose an area code and then use 
the prefix 555 (just like they do on TV and movies). For example: 415-555-
8396 is a nice random number.18 
The prefix 555 is reserved for "throwaway" numbers that are never 
assigned. Don't use 555-1212 though-that's directory assistance.19 
18 This information obviously applies to readers in the U.S. and Canada. ,.11 post fake numbers for 
other countries on AlwaysUseProtection.com as 1 find out about them. If you know the numbers for 
your country, please let me know by visiting the feedback section on the web site. 
19 In the U.S., you can dial 411 for information-but that only gets you information for your local 
area code. If you want information for another area code, you can dial that area code followed by 
555-1212. 

Chapter 13 Every Move You Make, They'll Be Watching You 
.'~jI .. _ 
Social Security Number 
Any site that requests this, unless you're registering for your classes at college 
or applying for credit, insurance, or a bank account, is probably not legitimate. 
So don't provide it. Don't make up a fake Social Security number-that's 
illegal. Your best bet if someone asks for it: Leave-you don't want any 
dealings with that site. 
Let Freedom Ring 
If you're interested in learning more about maintaining your privacy online, 
and privacy issues in general, there is probably no better organization than the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation. Visit http://www.eff.org for the latest news 
and legal cases relating to privacy issues. 
This concludes the part of this book that talks about protecting your pri-
vacy. These risks are great, and unfortunately are likely to increase over time. 
But if you adopt some commonsense habits now, you can maintain a fair 
amount of privacy. Or at least as much as is possible given the nature of our 
society. 
N ow it's time to move on to what is in some ways the most important 
part of the book, even though it's one of the easiest problems to deal with-
protecting yourself. 

PROTECTING YOURSELF 

Chat Rooms, Public 
and Private 
"Dangerous sexual predator arrested while waiting to meet teenager he con-
tacted first in an online chat room-News at 11!" 
How often have you heard stories like that? Come to think of it, every day 
we are exposed to TV messages along the lines of the following: 
You (member of a community, group, gender, age, etc.) are in 
great danger from (someone, something, faulty product, criminal 
element, negligent doctor, health risk, etc.)-News at II! 
Let's face it. Sex sells. Scary stories sell. Scary stories about sex sell really 
well. 
Scary stories about sexual predators who meet teens on the Internet and 
then manipulate them into meeting and then kidnap or assault them-well, 
there's just about nothing that sells better than that. Next to a war maybe. 
Yes, there are real dangers out there. And yes, some teens have been hurt. 
But exactly how scared should you be? 
Let's Look at Some Statistics 
Mark Twain said, "There are lies, damn lies, and statisticS."l Statistics have a 
remarkable ability to be twisted into saying all sorts of things. The best numbers 
currently available are from a report called "Online Victimization: A Report on 
the Nation's Youth," released in June 2000 and funded by a grant from the 
U.S. Congress. Because this report was published by the National Center 
for Missing & Exploited Children, it's safe to assume that the numbers are accu-
rate. 
Now, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children is a reputable 
organization with an important and worthwhile goal. At the same time, every

organization also has the goal to pe1petuate itself, and let's face it-there is at 
least the potential for bias in inte1preting the results, given that the scarier the 
results are, the easier it will be for the organization to convince people to give 
it more money to do its work. 2 
The Numbers 
Here, then, are some numbers. Decide for yourself what they mean: 
When asked, 19 percent of respondents received an 
unwanted sexual solicitation or approach in the past year. 
The report trumpets one in five youth as receiving such a solicitation. 
Another way of looking at this is that 81 percent of respondents didn't receive 
an unwanted sexual solicitation or approach. 
Personally, given the amount of such junk out there, it's astonishing that it's 
so low. One reason, I suspect, is that most teenagers don't waste time on pub-
lic chat rooms! 
What's really interesting about this is another number: 
48 percent of those making the solicitation were under 18! 
Only 24 percent were known to be 18 or over, and only 4 percent older 
than 25. 
5 percent of respondents received a solicitation experience 
in which they were very or extremely upset or afraid. 
So if 19 percent received a solicitation, and only 5 percent were extremely 
upset or afraid, it suggests that 14 percent were able to handle the situation 
with a reasonable degree of comfort. 
3 percent of respondents reported a solicitation that included an attempt 
to contact the person, either in person, over the phone, or by mail. The report 
calls these aggreSSive solicitations. 
Since 34 percent of those aggressive solicitations were by adults, that says 
that about 1 percent of the respondents had to deal with an adult attempting 
to contact them. 
Curiously, the report didn't ask another question: How many of the youth 
were pretending to be an adult at the time? A rather important piece of infor-
mation, don't you think? My own informal surveys show that most teens who 
spend any time on chat rooms do lie about their age or gender. 
2 I really mean no offense to this organization-I'm just stating the obvious. 

Chapter 14 Chat Rooms, Public and Private .':111" __ 
So, How Much Danger Are You Really in? 
In this particular survey of 1,501 kids and teens, there were no cases of actual 
sexual assault, though one incident was particularly suspicious. While these 
statistics do show the potential for real risk, they also show that the vast major-
ity of teens use the Internet-even online chat rooms-safely. 
In the rest of this chapter, I'll lay out some basic, commonsense precau-
tions that, if followed, will make sure you never become the tagline for a 
"N ews at 11" promotion. 
Chat Rooms 
There are two main types of chat rooms: public and private. Public chat rooms 
are those you find on major networks like AOL.3 They are usually divided by 
subject-you search for a chat room on a subject that interests you. In most 
cases, you arrive and discover that it is incredibly bOring. 
Private Chat Rooms 
Private chat rooms are chat rooms in which you invite friends to chat to-
gether. These are typically run by instant messenger systems or online gaming 
services. 
The nature of the risks differs conSiderably between the two chat rooms. 
In public chat rooms you are dealing with strangers. In private chat rooms you 
are usually dealing with people you already know personally, or people that 
have been introduced to you by friends. 
Obviously, private chat rooms are a lot less dangerous (assuming, of course, 
that your friends are safe to talk to). 
So I'm going to focus entirely on public chat rooms, but you should defi-
nitely apply the precautions I describe to any strangers whom you allow to join 
a private chat. 
Don't Give out Your Contact Information! 
If you don't tell them who you are, they can't find you. Don't give out your last 
name, address, or phone number. If you want to exchange e-mail, create a 
separate e-mail address just for use on chat rooms. 
This is the modern equivalent of "Don't talk to strangers," or at least don't 
tell them where you live. 
J Recently MSN dropped their public chat rooms, claiming this was to protect the safety of children 
online. They will continue to provide monitored chat rooms to paid subscribers. Was it a sincere 
effort to protect children? Or was it on excuse to dump an unprofitable free service and try to move 
people to paid subscriptions? You dedde. 

__ 
Jr.a;I:.1 Port 11/ Protecting Yourself 
It's sort of obvious, but really-this is the single most important thing you 
can do to protect yourself. 
Don't Visit Adult Chat Rooms Unless You Want to 
Receive Sexual Solicitations 
If you go to a public chat room that has an adult or sexual theme, you will get 
approached. That's why people go to those rooms in the ftrst place. Staying 
away from them is another simple and obvious way to avoid that kind of thing. 
Everybody Lies 
We're taught when young that lying is bad. When older, we sort oflearn that 
"little white lies" are alright. Well, guess what-when it comes to online chat 
rooms, lots of people lie. They lie about their age. They lie about their gender. 
They lie about themselves. 
This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Especially as a teen, lying online can give 
you a chance to experiment with different personalities-perhaps a safer way 
than doing so in person where a mistake might damage some important rela-
tionships with friends, teachers, and parents. Also as a teen, the anonymity of 
online chat rooms can allow you to be treated as an adult-but in a good way. 
It's an unfortunate truth that many adults will dismiss what a teen says just 
because of their age-before even listening to the content. I've known a num-
ber of teens who have found themselves being treated with levels of respect 
online that they were unable to achieve in person just because of their age.4 
Just remember that the person you're talking to, no matter how nice or 
sympathetic they sound, may be putting on an act. And no matter how nice 
they may sound, they may have ulterior motives. 
Instant Messenger Programs 
Instant messenger programs are one of the most popular tools around. In most 
cases you will be communicating with people on your Buddy list or Friends 
list. So you're usually not really dealing with strangers. There are a couple of 
issues to keep in mind, though. 
4 Orson Scott Card's outstanding novel Ender's Game includes a storyline in which two children 
successfully establish themselves as influential writers, with nobody realizing how young they are. 
I've seen real-life cases that are similar. 

Chapter 14 Chat Rooms, Public and Private '.,'allr..'_ 
• Don't automatically assume the person you're chatting with is the 
person you think they are. You read in Chapter 11 that 1M accounts are 
among the easiest accounts to steal (mostly because of automatic 
logon). So double-check that your buddy is really who they say they are 
before sharing anything personal. 
• Be quick to block people not on your Buddy or Friends list. 
I will sometimes accept an 1M from a stranger-as long as it doesn't have an 
obscene name (obviously 1M spam). I'll usually ask who they are and what they 
want before sharing any personal information. If the response is annoying or 
obscene, they get permanently blocked. If it's someone I know, as soon as I iden-
tify them I put them on my Buddy list for future reference. If it's a pleasant 
stranger, I might engage in a brief conversation, but won't share any personal 
information (a request for personal information leads to an immediate block). 
If you are facing ongoing harassment through 1M, there are things you 
can do. I'll discuss them in the section "When Trouble Strikes" later in this 
chapter. 
If You Have to Meet Someone You 
Met Online 
Some people who meet online end up forming close friendships. The Internet 
use report referenced earlier states that 16 percent of the youth using the 
Internet meet people online who they considered close friends (even though 
few actually met in person). Most of these were other youth. 
So here's the deal. If you do decide to meet someone in person, use some 
commonsense precautions. 
• Ideally, you should talk to your parents before arranging to meet. 
Especially if you're younger. 
• Don't give out your personal information. Instead, always meet for the 
first time in a public, safe, well-supervised place. Be sure to let friends 
or family know about the meeting-just in case. 
• Don't meet the other person alone. Bring your parents or at least a 
friend. 
Look at it this way: If the person you're meeting is not totally comfortable 
with the precautions you want to take, that's a very clear warning that some-
thing isn't right. If someone warns you not to tell friends or parents about the 
friendship, that's awfully suspicious as well. 

_IK::II';a:J,.' Part 11/ Protecting Yourself 
When Trouble Strikes 
One of the surprising things about the Internet use report is how few teens 
reported problems that did occur. One teen I know explained his theory-
teens don't report incidents because they're afraid their parents' response will 
be to simply disconnect the Internet or take away their computer. And you 
know what? In some cases I believe they are right-because let's face it, in 
many cases teens understand both the nature and risks of the Internet better 
than parents do. 
So here's the deal. If you feel threatened online, if someone is harassing 
you or stalking you, there are things you can do. 
Talk to your parents if you can. Show them the follOwing paragraph I've 
addressed to parents if you think that may help: 
I ;:71 NOTE TO PARENTS Surveys show that most teens who run into 
uncomfortable or scary situations online don't tell their parents. There 
are many reasons for this, including fear that you will restrict their Internet use, 
or embarrassment over what they were doing. I strongly encourage you to 
discuss this issue with your son or daughter and to make it clear to them that 
they can come to you when problems occur without fear of punishment. It is 
possible to use online chat rooms safely, and if your teen is showing you this 
paragraph, chances are good they already know what precautions to take. You 
can make it safer yet by making sure your teen can talk to you without fear that 
you'll overreact. 
You can call the police. One nice thing about all the media hype about the 
dangers of online chat rooms is that the police and FBI do take reports seri-
ously. And go ahead and tell the person that you will be calling the FBI. This 
alone may be enough to scare them off. Police departments in larger cities 
often have cybercrime units that will understand exactly what you are talking 
about, and will be able to offer good advice as to how to proceed. 
Copy every message you receive (including 1M and chat messages) into a 
text flle or print them out. Note the time and date of each one.5 
In most cases, access to chat rooms requires an account on the chat room 
service. It's often possible for law enforcement officers to trace chat room 
names back to the individual who owns the account, or at least the originating 
machine. 
Block any instant message sender who annoys you. If necessary, create a 
new screen name and abandon the old one. 
5 If you are sent child pornography, do NOT store a copy--delete it immediately. It is illegal to 
possess, even to use as evidence. Instead. record the URL of the image if you have it. 

Chapter 14 Chat Rooms, Public and Private ~figJ_. 
If you are in trouble, and you need someone to talk to, check your phone 
book for teen crises hotlines or runaway hotlines. Or you can call the national 
runaway hotline at 1-800-621-4000. Remember-no matter how sympa-
thetic your online friends are, no matter how well you think you know 
them, they are still strangers and may be lying about who they are. 
Are We Safe Yet? 
This is a short chapter. Because the truth is that you already know what you 
need to do to remain safe. Your parents taught it to you when you were very 
young. Don't talk to strangers. Don't wander off with a stranger. Don't take 
candy from strangers. Don't tell a stranger your name and where you live. 
The Internet is NOT a dangerous wilderness where teens are being con-
stantly stalked by evildoers.6 The miracle of the Internet is that for the first 
time it is actually possible for you to meet strangers, engage in conversation, 
and form friendships with them safely-just by following a few simple precau-
tions that keep your online identity separate from your real one. 
6 It is a dangerous wilderness where computer viruses breed. As you can probably tell. your computer 
is at significantly greater risk of being successfully attacked than you are!

_~'~I.I Part 11/ Protecting Yourself 
The preceding letters are based on a selection of the spam I received in one 
12-hour period. 
TANSTAAFL 
TANSTAAFL is short for "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch."l It's a 
fancy way of saying that nothing is really free-you pay for it in one way or 
another. And if an offer seems too good to be true, chances are it isn't true. 
Scams appeal to your natural instinct to trust people.2 They appeal to your 
greed. They appeal to your desires (whatever they may be). And sometimes 
they can be hard to resist. 
Let me tell you the dirty secret about scams (whether delivered through 
spam or through the web). 
The reason there's so much of it out there is because so much of it works. 
That's right-people wouldn't send spam if it weren't for the fact that they 
do make money at it. All that pornography exists not because businesses love 
porn-it's because people are willing to buy it. And scams exist because scams 
work. 
Yes, I know many of you might be thinking to yourself, "No way-I'm too 
smart to be taken." But let me tell you-those people are very good at what 
they do. Even the smartest, most vigilant people sometimes get tricked. 
Top Scams 
One of the best sites for reading about the latest scams belongs to the Federal 
Trade Commission (http://www • ftc. gov). 3 Another great resource is Scam-
Busters at http://www.scambusters.org. Here are some of the top scams: 
, The acronym was coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his book The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. If you 
aren't familiar with Heinlein's sdence fiction, run, do not walk, to your favorite bookstore (online or 
real) or library and start reading. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is a fine start. Stranger in a 
Strange Land is perhaps his best known. But you can't really go wrong with any of them. 
2 The term con anlst comes from the word confldence--people who rip you off by {irst gaining 
your trust. 
3 You might have noticed I refer to this site in a number of places in this book. It's a good site, and if 
you're in the U.S., you or your parents are paying for it anyway with tax dollars, so you might as well 
take advantage of it. If you're not in the U.S., think ofit as a gift from the u.s. government. 

Chapter 15 Scams ~ 
Internet Auctions 
I know several teens who have been ripped off on eBay-often to the tune of 
hundreds of dollars. For any major purchase, always pay by credit card (not 
debit card). As you learned in Chapter 10, credit cards provide significant 
protection in cases of fraud. That includes cases where the product you are 
buying is defective, misrepresented, or never arrives. 
If the auction site offers an escrow service, be sure to request it.4 If the 
seller isn't willing to use an escrow service or accept credit cards, you should 
be concerned. 
Credit Card Fraud 
Once a company has your credit card number, they can try to run up the 
charges-even if you gave it to them just to identify yourself as being 18 or 
over. Your liability is limited to $50 (if it's a credit card), but it can be a real 
hassle. Especially if you're under 18 and trying to explain to your parents why 
there are a string of charges from "Hilda's House of Porn." 
Business Opportunities 
Anything that promises you hundreds or thousands of dollars a day or week for 
doing nothing is a con-most likely a pyramid scheme, where the people who 
start the scheme make off with your money and leave you hoping to profit 
from the gullibility of someone else. 
Pyramid schemes take many forms, but they are all illegal. The classic 
pyramid scheme is one where you are supposed to recruit others to sell some-
thing or invest. Then you (or your recruits) send all or part of that money or 
investment to the person who recruited you. Someday, when your recruits find 
their own recruits, those people are supposed to send you money and you'll be 
rich. The problem with these schemes (aside from the legality) is that you and 
your recruits run out of stupid friends before you actually make any money. 
Work-at-home schemes often end up being little more than scams-where 
you invest money on a "work-at-home marketing kit." This kit teaches you how 
to try to sell "work-at-home marketing kits" to other people . 
.. With an escrow service, you send your money to the escrow service. The escrow service notifies the 
seller that it has the money and instructs them to shiP the product Once you notifY the escrow serv-
ice that you've received the product in good condition, the escrow service releases the money to the 
seller. This reduces the chance of froud, because there is a trusted third party (the escrow service) 
making sure everyone does their port.

i,;,;I·'. Part 11/ Protecting Yourself 
Bulk E-Mail 
These folks either want to tum you into spammers (which is liable to cause 
you to lose your Internet account through most ISPs), or to sell you useless 
mailing lists so that you can presumably make money through sending spam. 
Health and Diet Scams 
These are the modem equivalent of the old patent medicine show, where a 
traveling salesperson mixes up some random ingredients and sells them to a 
crowd (usually after a partner, or "shill," pretends to be cured by the miracu-
lous medicine). 
Investment Opportunities 
If you'd like to find out more about these, watch the movie Boiler Room, 
which shows an investment company using aggressive sales techniques to sell 
and manipulate the value of a company's stock. Yes, that kind of stuff actually 
happens. Even when legitimate, the smaller stocks pitched by these scams are 
highly subject to manipulation. 
Vacation Prize Promotions 
Even when a legitimate vacation is involved, the quality often turns out to be 
less than what you expect. Like that luxury cruise liner stateroom that turns 
out to be a rat-infested inside cabin. 
The Nigerian Scam 
This is one of my all-time favorites. You receive a desperate plea from an ex-
government official (or their spouse) for a troubled Mrican nation (usually but 
not necessarily Nigeria), explaining how they have millions of dollars hidden or 
locked away and only you can help get it out. 
If you provide your bank account number and other personal information, 
they will deposit huge sums of money into your account, and let you keep 
most of it! 
Amazingly enough, there are lots of people who actually believe that some 
total stranger will choose them to share millions of dollars with, and proceed 
to forward their bank account information, blank letterhead, and cash "to get 
things started." 

Chapter 15 Scams 'K:fgf __ 
Is It a Scam, or Isn't It? 
Sometimes there seems to be a fine line between a scam and plain old-fash-
ioned marketing spin. Like seeing a product with a "New and Improved" label 
on the box, only to discover that the only thing new and improved was the box. 
Just the other day, a friend of mine told me about an FM antenna he was 
planning to buy for his stereo to improve reception. This amazing antenna had 
the ability to take the incoming electromagnetic radio wave and filter out the 
"bad" electrical part, keeping only the "good" magnetic part. Well, I admit, it's 
been a while since I got my degree in electronic engineering,5 but last I heard, 
what an antenna does is take an electromagnetic wave and convert it into an 
electrical Signal that can be amplified and played on your TV or radio. Now 
this may be a fine antenna, but if it is, why do they have to make up scientific 
nonsense to sell it? Won't the truth do? 
Exaggerated and misleading advertisement is something we are exposed to 
every day, whether it's on TV or on the Internet. So remember to be skeptical, 
even when visiting legitimate sites. 
Here are some of the more common techniques you'll see that may not be 
scams, but are at least misleading.

When you click the link, you fmd yourself at what looks like a completely 
legitimate online store, complete with shopping card, privacy policy, online 
catalog-the works. 
Is it legit, or not? 
To tell you the truth, I can't absolutely tell you that it isn't. It's just barely 
possible that this is a real, honest promotion from a new online retailer. 
I admit, I was intrigued enough to read this one, but after researching it 
further I found ... 
• Their site doesn't include a phone number to call for customer service. 
• There is no "About" information that points to a physical mailing 
address. 
• I have never Signed up for a contest on this site, or ever heard of it 
before. 
• A Coogle search on Portable-Paradise.com has no hits. Portable-
Paradise.com combined with other keywords like "laptop" and "apple" 
show no relevant hits. 
• However, a search on ''You've won an Apple iBook" retrieved several 
hits on dslreports.com in their Spam and Scam Busters section, which 
shows that an identical message was sent from another domain in 2002. 
Readers on the forum concluded it was a scam then. 
• There is information in the Whois database including an address and 
phone number, but nobody answers the phone (at least when I tried it). 
Conclusion? If it's a scam (as I suspect), someone went to a great deal of 
trouble to make it look legitimate. It even made me think twice (though not 
enough to enter any personal information or credit card info).

Play the Game and Win! 
You know those banners that ask you to click a monkey or target at the right 
time in order to win something? Trust me-it doesn't matter when you click 
them. You'll always "win." 
But it's not necessarily a scam. Usually it's just a marketing gimmick trying 
to collect your personal information and sell you something. 
Your Computer Is Vulnerable! 
This is usually a pop-up window suggesting that a vulnerability has been 
detected on your computer. More often than not, it's from a company trying to 
sell you antivirus or privacy software. However, it can also be a scam-trying 
to convince you to install or run a program that, while claiming to protect your 
computer, will actually attack it. 
Stay skeptical, and when in doubt-don't click the link. 
Consumer Reports 
Consumer Reports is a great organization when it comes to evaluating market-
ing claims. They don't accept advertisements and are a great source for objec-
tive product reviews. If you're undertaking a major purchase, a subscription to 
their web site or magazine can really save you a lot of grief, and probably some 
money as well. Visit http://www • consumerreports. org for more information. 
How Not to GetTaken 
Sorry, I can't offer a magic secret that will guarantee that you won't get conned. 
I can only offer some commonsense suggestions that should become habit. 
• Don't trust e-mail solicitations. Since % of them are outright scams of 
one form or another, it's better to just delete them all. You won't be 
missing anything important. 
• Don't click web banner ads just out of curiosity. If it's clear that the ad 
is promoting something you are interested in, and it's appearing on a 
legitimate site, go for it. But if it's just some mysterious teaser playing 
on your curiosity, don't give them the satisfaction. 

_ .. ';.,{'.' Part 11/ ProteaingYourself 
• Never fill in a form that appears in an e-mail message. Never fill in a 
form on a web page linked to from an e-mail message unless you 
recognize the URL that appears in the address bar of your browser. 
Even if you do recognize the URL, don't enter any personal 
information into the form-instead, navigate on your own to the web 
site and use its account management tools. 
• Anyone or any message that tries to scare you, warn you, or tempt you 
should be immediately suspect. 
• Any message that asks for personal information, even if it seems to 
come from a legitimate site (such as PayPal, eBay, or Microsoft), is 
probably a scam. Remember-sites where you have an account already 
have your personal information. They certainly don't need to ask for it 
from you. 
Urban Legends 
Did you know the word gullible doesn't appear in any dictionary? 
OK, so most of these aren't scams. And getting caught by them won't hurt 
you. However, they can be quite embarrassing when your friends and family 
discover that you have been tricked by one of them. 
There are so many of these that I won't even bother listing them. Visit 
http://www • urban legends. com or http://www.snopes.com. sit back, relax, and 
enjoy two of the most fascinating sites on the web. 

Parting Words 
So here we are, at the end of the book. You've learned to protect your computer from 
viruses and hackers. You've learned to protect your privacy from strangers and friends. 
You've learned how to protect yourself from scams and stalkers. There are a couple of 
appendices after this that you might find useful, but those are more like bonus mate-
rial. You now have a knowledge of computer security that, although it perhaps doesn't 
qualifY you as an "expert," certainly takes you well past the beginner stage. 
I hope you've enjoyed this journey. But before you leave (at least for the moment), 
I'd like to say a few parting words, and extend an invitation. 
Believe it or not, most authors don't write for the money. 7 I mean, J. K. Rowling 
may be richer than the Queen of England, but I'm no J. K. Rowling, and the wizardry 
you've learned in this book is not quite as fantastic as that of Harry Potter> (though I 
dare say it is both more real and at times much more scary). 
Authors write because they have a passion for their subject. I wrote this book 
because, more than anything else, I believe it is desperately needed and can make a 
difference. Viruses and privacy issues are huge problems, and no one person or even 
government can solve them alone. But, if I can help educate some people, help them 
protect their computers, preserve their privacy-even play games without long lag 
times-well, that's a great feeling. And if I pay a few grocery bills in the process-that 
would be nice too. 
So I'd like to invite you to join me in spreading ... a virus of a sort, if you will. 
If you found that this book helped you, then chances are you'll agree that it will 
help your friends as well. So please, tell them about it. Tell them in person. Tell them 
online. Tell them in forums and newsgroups. 
Because you see, if together we can get every single teen who uses a computer to 
follow the basic guidelines in this book, and convince them to protect their parents' 
computers as well, the number of viruses and amount of spam on the Internet will drop 
to nearly nothing. And if we can raise the awareness of privacy issues-and help people 
realize how vast the threat is to our privacy, then maybe we can elect representatives 
who will place a high value on individual rights. 
We are really just at the beginning of the Internet age. And what we do together is 
going to shape it for decades to come. So help me spread the word. 
Finally, I invite you to visit http://www.AlwaysUseProtection.com. That's where I'll 
be posting not only updates to the book, but also other information and links on secu-
rity and privacy themes that I hope you will find of interest. I also want to hear your 
stories-and gradually tum the site into an ongoing resource for everyone who has read 
this book. 
Thank you, and best ofluck to you all.

Everyday Security 
Security is a big subject. In this book, I've tried to not only give you specific 
suggestions regarding computer security, but also teach you the how and why 
of security-to cover the concepts that will help you deal with not only today's 
risks, but tomorrow's as well. 
But there's a lot of information in this book, and I also want to make sure 
you can get the information you need quickly. Yes, this book has a table of 
contents, and yes, this book has an index. But I wanted something else. Here, 
then, is a summary guide to everyday security tasks. Consider these the most 
important things you should do and be aware of every day. Obviously, it's 
Simplified considerably from the text in the book, and I won't discuss the 
exceptions to the rules shown here. But as a quick reference, I hope you find 
it useful. 
ProtectingYour Computer 
There are three things you need to secure your computer: an antivirus 
program, a firewall, and system updates. 
Antivirus 
• Ke p your antivirus program activ . 
• Keep your subSCription up to date. 
Be sure your antivirus program updat 
itself automatically. 
A 
• Use active scanning (the antivirus program monitors files as you use 
them). 

_""';.,1.:.11' Part IV Appendixes 
Firewalls 
• If you use a phone dial-up connection to the Internet, use a software 
firewall such as ZoneAlarm. 
• If you use cable or DSL to connect, use a router that supports NAT 
(also called Internet Connection Sharing). 
• Learn to open individual ports to allow access to services without 
taking down your entire firewall. 
System Updates 
• Back up key data before you perform a major update. 
• Visit http://windowsupdate • microsoft. com and install all critical 
software updates. 
• On XP, use automatic Windows Update. 
Software and System Configuration 
• Tum off automatic downloading of messages (Outlook and Outlook 
Express). 
• Tum off JavaScript and ActiveX controls in e-mail viewers. 
• Use a password on your system. 
• Use encryption if you have a wireless network. 
• Tum off unnecessary services. 
• Set your cookie configuration to block or prompt on all third-party 
cookies. Consider using prompts on first-party cookies as well. 
• Tum off automatic login and password storage for web sites. 
Spyware and Adware Blockers 
• Use spyware and adware removal tools to help protect your privacy. 

Appendix A Everyday Security ~ 
UsingYour Computer 
Here is a summary of things you should always keep in mind while using your 
computer. 
Checking E-Mail 
• Don't open attachments. 
• Don't click links inside e-mail messages. 
Floppies and CDs 
• Scan floppy disks and CDs from untrusted sources for viruses. 
• Hold the Shift key down when inserting a suspect CD to prevent the 
autorun program from starting. 
Browsing the Web 
• Scan any downloaded fIles for viruses. 
• Don't trust ActiveX controls unless you explicitly request one. 
• Don't give out personal information unless you truly trust the site. 
• Don't give out your Social Security number or birth date unless you are 
absolutely certain it is safe. 
• Deny permission to set cookies to all but the most trusted sites. 
Instant Messenger Programs 
• Tum off automatic login. 
• Block harassing messages. 

_110'1:01:1::.. Part IV Appendixes 
Shopping Online 
• Use credit cards, not cash or debit cards. 
• Use credit cards or escrow services on auction sites. 
Passwords 
• Use at least three passwords: one for high security, one for moderate 
security, and one for your computer. Create "throwaway" passwords for 
sites you don't trust or plan to visit again. 
• Avoid the obvious (birth dates, names, etc.). 
• Mix some numbers in with the password. 
P2P 
• Avoid the adware/spyware versions ofP2P software. 
• Tum off HIe sharing if your client allows it, otherwise take HIes out of 
your shared HIe folder. 
• Do not act as a supemode or share files. 
Privacy 
• Clear your history, file cache (offline content), and cookies after using a 
public computer. 
Chat Rooms 
• Don't give out any personally identifiable information to strangers, no 
matter how nice they seem. 
• Remember-everybody lies online.

Registry Tricks 
Your system registry is a database on your computer-a me that contains cen-
tralized information that controls every aspect of your system, from key system 
software to individual application settings. 
How important is the registry? If every file on your system was left alone, 
and you scrambled your registry, your system would be dead. Nothing would 
run. It wouldn't even boot. Lose your registry and it's game over-you won't 
lose your data mes, but you'll need to reinstall your system. That's why emer-
gency repair disks and system save points save the registry-Windows does 
what it can to make sure that the registry information is recoverable if some-
thing goes wrong. 
But there isn't much it can do if you damage your registry intentionally. 
In this appendix, I'm going to show you how the experts edit the registry. 
Knowledge of how to edit the registry can help you manually disable many 
worms and Trojans. 
Ifl CAUTION Anything you do here is entirely at your own risk. 
lLJ Registry editing is designed for expert-level system configuration-and 
even the experts have been known to damage their registries using these 
techniques. You can wipe out your system if you aCcidentally delete or modify 
the wrong entry. 
Using the Registry Editor 
B 
Start the Registry Editor by going to the Start menu, chOOSing Run, and enter-
ing the command RegEdit. Figure B-1 shows the main window of the Regi try 
Editor.

Figure B-1 The Registry Editor, main window 
The Registry Editor window divides into two parts. The left-hand side con-
tains objects called keys. Think of them like directory folders--containers that 
hold various values. 
The right-hand side contains the values. Think of them a bit like files, 
except that they are individual numbers and strings that have names. 
At the top level, your computer has five keys. Of these, the one we'll be 
most concerned with is named HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. That's the key 
that holds your machine configuration and settings.l 
You can click on the little plus (+) symbol on the left to expand and col-
lapse the subkeys (yep, keys contain other keys). Figure B-2 shows what 
happens when you expand the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key, and then 
expand the SOFTWARE key.2

The highlighted key, America Online, would be referred to as

I You may be wondering why I'm not bothering to explain the other keys. The thing is, people write 
entire books just about the registry. If I started trying to explain HKEY _CLASSE5~OOT, next thing I'd 
be trying to explain classes, COM, type Iibraries,ApplDS, GUIDs . . .. Anyway, you'd die of boredom 
long before we got to anything aaua/Iy useful. 50 trust me, not only don't you need to know about the 
other keys-
you don't want to know about them! 
2 The keys that appear under the SOFTWAR£ key on your system will probably differ. depending on 
what applications you have installed. 

Appendix 8 Reg;stryTricks I'JlII"~. 
I'll continue to use that syntax to describe keys from here on. 
As you can see, different applications can store their own software settings 
under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\sOFTWARE key. This is where 
applications will tend to store their machine settings. If you navigate to the 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\sOFTWARE key, you'll see subkeys where differ-
ent applications store settings that apply to the current user (some applications 
are able to keep different settings for each user on a machine-this is where 
they store those settings). 
The key you'll be most interested in is at 
HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Figure B-3 Example of the contents of the Run key 
Look in the right pane of the Registry Editor. Each line contains a value. 
The value is a text string (that's what the REG_SZ means), and the data is the 
command line to a program that should be run every time Windows starts. 
Why is this important? 
Because worms and Trojans love to install themselves in this key. That's 
what allows them to run automatically each time you start your machine. 
If you find a worm or Trojan in this list, you can delete it by clicking it, and 
then either choosing the Edit ~ Delete command from the menu or right-
clicking and choosing Delete. 
You should also check the follOwing key: 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
Programs under this key start automatically when this user (the one 
currently logged on) logs in again. 
The RunOnce and RunOnceEx subkeys (under both the HKEY_CUR-
RENT_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys) may also be used 
by viruses, but this is uncommon, as Windows runs them once and then 
deletes them. They are used when you need to launch a program one time 
only the next time Windows starts. 

•• 
![fl"". Part IV Appendixes 
Which Programs Are Viruses? 
Figuring out which program should be deleted is where the real challenge lies. 
The safest way is to look at the manual removal instructions for the virus you 
have-the major antivirus sites include descriptions of known viruses and 
instructions on how to remove them manually (if possible-remember, some 
viruses prevent the Registry Editor from running). 
You can sometimes figure it out for yourself. Each line consists of the path 
to the executable file. There are some tricks to be aware of though: 
When you see a directory with a - character, you're looking at the short-
ened name of the directory. For example, C:\PROGRA-l actually refers to 
C:\Program Files. 
Sometimes the filename isn't at the start of the line. You may see a line 
like this: 
RUNDLL.EXE SETUPX.DLL,InstallHinfSection 132 C:\WINDOWS\INF\SHELL.INF 
In this case, RunDLL is a program that runs other programs or libraries 
(with the extension DLL). So if you see any filenames (files with the extension 
.exe, .dll, .bat, etc.) in the registry value, any of them might be a virus. 
Ifl CAUTION Most of the files you find in this key aren't viruses, and are 
lLJ in fact required for your computer to work. So don't delete any entries 
from the registry unless you're certain they are viruses. 
Once you've identified the filename, find it on your system using the 
Windows Explorer. It will usually be in your Windows or Windows\System 
directory. One way to do this is to just search for the filename. 
Once you've found it, right-click it, select Properties, and then choose the 
Version tab. 
In Figure B-3, the first program is something called AGRSMMSG.exe. 
What does that program do? Frankly, I had no idea when I first snapped that 
screen shot. But I found the file in the Windows directory, and looking at the 
version information saw the dialog box in Figure B-4. 
I guess that's the program that runs my laptop's modem. 
Worms and Trojans can lie about their version information, and files 
infected with viruses still have their original description. However, many virus 
authors just can't resist showing off, and will have missing or suspicious version 
information.3 
I can't stress enough the risks of making a mistake here-if you delete a 
key or value that is critical to your system, it will stop working. 
3 Not every program with miSSing information is a virus, but it is awfully suspicious, as professional 
and commercial software developers all know how to set version information for a program.

There are a few other places where viruses can insert themselves so that they 
run automatically when a system starts. 
Services 
Occasionally a virus will install itself as a special kind of program called a 
service. A list of services can be found in the registry at the key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services 
Each subkey is the name of a service. Look for the value ImagePath under 
the service's key to see the name of the program that is run when Windows 
starts up. 

__ I iii'!::" Part IV Appendixes 
Win.ini 
A long time ago, this fIle (found in the Windows directory) was used for sys-
tem configuration (back before the registry was invented). It may not be used 
for much, but it still works. 
You may find in the fIle a few lines that look like this: 
[Windows] 
Run= 
load= 
The Run= and Load= lines instruct Windows to start and run (or load) the 
specified fIle when Windows starts. Viruses will often insert themselves both 
in the registry and in the win.ini fIle. 
Disabling CD Autorun 
Way back in Chapter 3, I promised to show you how to disable autorun for 
your CD drives. Autorun is actually a very low-risk operation-most viruses 
are spread nowadays through the Internet rather than via floppies or CDs. 
Nevertheless, uyou do find yourself looking at CDs obtained from untrust-
worthy sources, it's a good idea to tum autorun off. 
Figure B-5 shows you the contents of the 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControISet\Services\Cdrom key. 
As you can see, there is a value named Autorun, which by default is set to 1.

ote for Parents 
The vast majority of parents of teenagers find the experience to be, how shall I 
put it, somewhat interesting. I've probably taught and worked with hundreds 
of teenagers, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that it's both unfair and 
in fact impossible to lump them all into one group. The fact is, the stereotypes 
of teens that you see portrayed in the media do not reflect reality. And any 
advice I offer to you that addresses teens in general has to be interpreted in 
the context of your teenager and the relationship you share. 
That made the material in this appendix some of the most challenging in 
the book to write. I've met teens who know next to nothing about their com-
puters, and others who know more than I do in some areas. There are teens 
who discuss their online computer use with their parents and wouldn't dream 
of violating the rules they set, and others who secretly run their own porn web 
sites on a parent's computer with them none the wiser.l 
This book is based on two fundamental truths: First, most teenagers today 
are perfectly capable of taking responsibility for their own computer and 
online security (whether they want to or choose to is another question, but 
they definitely have the ability). Second, most teenagers are fundamentally 
good people who, given the opportunity, will act in the best interests of them-
selves, their families, and their community. 
With this in mind, and knOwing you need to interpret what follows in the 
context of your own situation, I'd like to offer you anum ber of suggestions and 
observations that I believe will help you help your teen to keep your systems 
safe and protect yourselves and your privacy. 
, Good news: There are a lot more of the former than the latter. 
c 

_.:11:.:1.:11' Part IV Appendixes 
Teenagers Aren't Children 
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) makes it clear: As far 
as online privacy goes, teenagers aren't children. When I first started writing 
this book, I thought it would be for kids and teens, but I hadn't written one 
chapter before I realized that would be a mistake. You can't expect younger 
children to take responsibility for their own computer security. It requires 
patience and skills and an understanding of consequences that most younger 
kids don't have. So if you're a parent of younger children, this book can help-
but it's up to you to read the book and apply the techniques you learn yourself. 
While a smart 11 or 12 year old might do well with this book, it really was 
designed for teenagers to help themselves. 
The $99 Security Budget 
I've done my best throughout the book to focus on security precautions that 
cost nothing to apply. However, there are some things you'll need that aren't 
free: 
• An antivirus subSCription 
• A NAT-based router (for those who are on cable or DSL) 
• This book (sorry, just couldn't resist) 
Total cost: under $100, then maybe $30-$40/year afterwards. 
My advice to you is Simple: After reading this book, your teen will probably 
understand and care enough about security to pay for these things themselves. 
But I suggest that this is an expense that you should offer to cover. Don't take 
it out of their allowance. Don't make it a birthday or holiday gift. Don't make 
them pay for it with a part-time job. Think of this expense in the same cate-
gory as healthy food, clothing, and medical care.2 1t may sound like a lot, but 
spending $40 or so to protect a $400 computer isn't so terrible, and a one-time 
expense of $50 on a DSL line that is costing you $20 per month isn't bad 
either. If money is tight, look for used routers on eBay-you don't need the 
latest and greatest to do a good job. Look for specials on antivirus software 
(they appear frequently). Borrow this book from a library if you can't afford it. 
But these are things you can't skimp on. 
2 O( course, if you are one o( those parents who makes their teens pay (or these things, then you 
would have them pay (or this as well. 

Appendix C A Note for Parents 'K*;:ol.::._ 
Grow Your Own IT Manager 
Medium and large companies have people called Information Technology (IT) 
managers whose job it is to keep all their computers running properly and 
make sure the systems are kept up to date and secure. If you've read this book, 
you know that security for the home is not terribly complex, but setting it up 
(and cleaning up any problems) can be quite time consuming. 
Consider letting your teenager be your household's IT manager. As long as 
they're already learning to protect their machine, why not let them protect 
yours as well? Scanning for viruses and backing up systems can be part of their 
monthly responsibilities-perhaps in place of less interesting chores. Even if 
you pay them for the work, it will be a lot less expensive than having your local 
computer shop do it for you (and a small investment in protecting your sys-
tems can save you a small fortune in cleanup costs). 
Don't Expect Perfection 
There is no such thing as perfect computer security. Even if your son or 
daughter memorizes this book, and studies every book and web site available 
on computer security and privacy, there is always the possibility that a problem 
will occur. 
When problems do occur, don't overreact, and don't assume they did any-
thing wrong. Give your teen a chance to deal with the problem. And try to 
avoid draconian punishments or restrictions. Remember-adults suffer from 
these problems as much or more than teens do. 
Don't Rely on Technology to Teach 
Values 
Lots of companies out there would be glad to sell you software that will moni-
tor your teen's computer. They'll sell you filter software to control what your 
teen can see. They'll sell you monitoring software to let you see what they've 
browsed. 
Frankly, I don't think much of these tools. 

_IIIl:IJWii .. ' Part IV Appendixes 
Oh, make no mistake-they have their place with younger children (and 
you should definitely consider this kind of software for them). But I do not 
recommend it for teens for several reasons: 
• Most teens have the skills to bypass or disable this kind of software if 
they want to. 
• While computer security problems are very common, they aren't 
generally dangerous. So if you're going to use more invasive forms of 
monitoring, use them for serious issues like preventing drug use, not 
computer issues. 
• Let's face it, monitoring and fIltering software carries the implicit 
message, "I don't trust your intentions" or "I don't trust your ability to 
protect yourself." Personally, I think it's better to start with trust and 
deal with the occasional disappOintment than to start from a position of 
mistrust. 
Instead of using monitoring and fIltering software, I encourage you to dis-
cuss these issues with your teenager. Talk about your expectations and your 
values-what kinds of sites you expect them to visit or avoid. And check in 
now and then to see how things are going. 
You'll get a lot further teaching your teens values by talking to them than 
by trying to find technology to do it for you. 
Final Thoughts 
If there's one thing I know about teens in general, it's this: They are capable of 
doing far more than most adults give them credit for. Computer security on 
home systems (or lack thereof) is a huge problem right now, and I wrote this 
book with the belief that not only can teens be a part of the overall solution to 
this problem, but they can also take the lead. 
So I encourage you to sit back and give your teenager the opportunity to 
take charge of their own computer security, and maybe even yours. While I 
obviously can't make any guarantees, I am confident that the vast majority of 
you will be positively astonished by the results.

How Computer 
Programming Works 
By Dan Appleman 
ISBN 1-893115-23-2 
$29.95 
J
ust as children must learn the alphabet before they can read, 
future programmers must understand certain concepts before 
they can write their first program. This unique book by Dan 
Appleman gives readers of every age a visual tour of the world of 
computer programming. 
• Useful for future programmers or anyone interested in explaining 
or teaching fundamental programming concepts 
• Full-color illustrations help to visually explain abstract concepts 
• New, expanded section on computer programming for the Internet 
From explaining the mystery behind the way the Internet is "made" to 
describing how to program the VCR to tape shows when you're not at 
home, How Computer Programming Works will give curious readers 
of any age a backstage view of technology in our everyday lives! 
Apress® 
www.apress.com 

JOIN THE APRESS FORUMS AND BE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. You'll find discussions that cover 
topics of interest to IT professionals, programmers, and enthusiasts just like you. If you post a query to 
one of our forums, you can expect that some of the best minds in the business-especially Apress 
authors, who all write with The Expert's Vo/ce™-will chime in to help you. Why not aim to become one 
of our most valuable participants (MVPs) and win cool stuff? Here's a sampling of what you'll find: 
DATABASES 
Data drives everything. 
Share information, exchange ideas, and discuss any 
database programming or administration issues. 
INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES AND NETWORKING 
Try living without plumbing (and eventually IPv6). 
Talk about networking topics including protocols, design, 
administration, wireless, wired, storage, backup, certifications, 
trends, and new technologies. 
JAVA 
We've come a long way from the old Oak tree. 
Hang out and discuss Java in whatever flavor you choose: 
J2SE, J2EE, J2ME, Jakarta, and so on. 
MAC OSX 
All about the Zen of OS X. 
OS X is both the present and the future for Mac apps. 
Make suggestions, offer up ideas, or boast about your new 
hardware. 
OPEN SOURCE 
Source code is good; understanding (open) source 
is better. 
Discuss open source technologies and related topics such 
as PHP, MySQL, Linux, Perl, Apache, Python, and more. 
HOW TO PARTICIPATE: 
PROGRAMMING/BUSINESS 
Unfortunately, it is. 
Talk about the Apress line of books that cover software 
methodology, best practices, and how programmers interact 
with the "suits." 
WEB DEVELOPMENT/DESIGN 
Ugly doesn't cut it anymore, and CGI is absurd. 
Help is in sight for your site. Find design solutions for your 
projects and get ideas for building an interactive Web site. 
SECURITY 
Lots of bad guys out there-the good guys need help. 
Discuss computer and network security issues here. Just 
don't let anyone else know the answers! 
TECHNOLOGY IN ACTION 
Cool things. Fun things. 
It's after hours. It's time to play. Whether you're into LEGO® 
MINDSTORMSTM or turning an old PC into a DVR, this is 
where technology turns into fun. 
WINDOWS 
No defenestration here. 
Ask questions about all aspects of Windows programming, 
get help on Microsoft technologies covered in Apress books, 
or provide feedback on any Apress Windows book.
