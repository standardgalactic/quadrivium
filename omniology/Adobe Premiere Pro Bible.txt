Foreword
A
s you may be aware, Premiere Pro is a complete rewrite that has taken place
over two plus years. What this means to those of us on the development
team is that we have finally brought to fruition the results of a vision that we collec-
tively held for what a nonlinear editing application should look like.
One of the advantages of embarking on a rewrite is that you are no longer confined
by the legacy technologies that you have carried forward from previous versions.
What this meant for Premiere Pro was that we were able to take advantage of all the
latest and greatest developments from both Intel and Microsoft. Our overriding
vision for this version of Premiere was to be able to accomplish as much in real
time as possible in software only. In other words, with a copy of Premiere Pro and
an up-to-date PC, you would be able to edit DV in real time and view the output of
your work not only on a computer screen, but also on a video monitor attached to
the system. This was no small undertaking, as this level of performance has previ-
ously been possible only by the addition of dedicated video hardware.
Of course, in addition to the real-time performance, we completely overhauled the
user interface, added multiple timelines, integrated DVD production, added three-
point color correction, updated the effects engine, and greatly simplified the tool
changes and a host of other features that I think make this version of Premiere the
best one yet.
The truth is that no software is ever truly finished. We take great pride here on the
Premiere team that we really listen to our users. In fact, the truth is that Premiere
Pro is largely the result of people like you providing great feedback and innovative
ideas for ways in which we could improve our product. With that in mind, I’d like to
invite you to participate in that process and join our community. Many Premiere
users have discovered that their feature ideas have materialized in Premiere Pro.
If you think of a great idea for how Premiere can be improved, we would love to hear
from you. Please include lots of detail and send us an e-mail at premierewishlist@
adobe.com. Our interface designers, product managers, and engineers read all these
e-mails, but please do not expect a personal response.

where you can lurk or actively participate in discussions about digital video, cre-
ative solutions to problems, special techniques, and so on. Forums are offered for

Foreword
Adobe, of course, is renown for other software apart from Premiere. So, in addition
to all the cool editing features that were added to Premiere Pro, we also had a goal
to “play well with others.” To this end, we greatly enhanced the interaction with
well-established Adobe family members — After Effects and Photoshop. In addition,
we expanded our integration with Adobe’s new kids on the block — Encore DVD
and Audition. 
If you are using these products together, you will find that moving between the
applications becomes very easy. After Effects will import Premiere Projects (com-
plete with effects and key frame data), Markers from Premiere Pro’s Timeline will
show up in Encore, Photoshop files brought into Premiere Pro will now come in as
Timelines with every layer as a separate track, Encore can actually undo edits on
PSD files that were performed by Photoshop, editing an audio file in Premiere will
load the original session file in Audition, and After Effects and Premiere Pro will
load vector artwork from Illustrator. 
In the publication you are now holding, Adele Droblas and Seth Greenberg have
done a fantastic job of taking you beyond editing with Premiere Pro and explaining
how the other powerful software that Adobe produces can enhance the results of
your efforts.
I hope that you enjoy the experience of working with Premiere Pro and its siblings.
I also hope that the time you spend with these tools is both creatively rewarding
and enjoyable.

Preface
A
s you read these words, a revolution in desktop video is taking place. One of
the main causes of the revolution is the advent of the digital video camera,
which digitizes high-quality video directly in the camera. After the signal has been
digitized, it can be transferred directly over a cable to a personal computer. After
your computer gets hold of the video, you need Adobe Premiere Pro to help you
creatively shape it into a compelling desktop video production.
Adobe Premiere Pro combines power and ease of use to provide a complete author-
ing environment for producing desktop digital video productions. By using Premiere
Pro, you can capture video directly from your camcorder into Premiere Pro’s cap-
ture window. After you’ve captured or imported video and sound, you can assemble
your clips into a production by simply clicking and dragging a video clip from one
window to another. Placing clips and reassembling them is almost as easy as snap-
ping together the cars in a child’s toy railroad train set. Creating transitions that
dissolve one scene into another or wipe one scene away to reveal another is simply
a matter of dragging an icon representing the transition between the two clips. To
fine-tune your work, Premiere Pro provides numerous digital-editing tools — some
similar to those available in professional editing studios, others only possible
through digital magic. After you’ve finished editing, you can output your digital
movie with settings for the Web, videotape, or DVD. If you’ve ever tried creating a
video production by using traditional videotape hardware, Adobe Premiere Pro will
revolutionize the way that you work.
Who Should Read This Book
The Adobe Premiere Pro Bible is for multimedia producers, Web designers, graphic
designers, artists, filmmakers, and camcorder users — anyone interested in using
his or her computer to create desktop video productions or to output desktop video
to videotape, DVDs, or the Web. As you read through the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible,
you’ll soon see that it is more than just a reference to virtually all the features in
Adobe Premiere Pro. The book is filled with short tutorial exercises that help you
understand concepts and put into practice the key Premiere Pro features covered
in a chapter. You’ll find this book indispensable as you learn to use Adobe Premiere
Pro (and a useful reference book after you’ve mastered Premiere Pro’s key features).
So don’t wait another moment — start reading and learning what you can do with
your creative visions.

Preface
How This Book Is Organized
If you read the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible’s chapters in order, you’ll gradually become
an expert at using Adobe Premiere Pro. However, we expect that most readers will
jump in and out of chapters as needed or as their interest moves from subject to
subject. Throughout the book, we’ve included numerous step-by-step tutorials to
guide you through the process of creating video sequences by using many Adobe
Premiere Pro features. As you work, you’ll find many clips on the DVD that will aid
you in quickly and efficiently creating short examples that illustrate and help explain
chapter topics.
For updated information on Adobe Premiere Pro, be sure to visit Adobe’s Web site
at www.adobe.com.
The Adobe Premiere Pro Bible is broken down into seven main parts, each described
in the following sections.
Part I: Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Part I provides an introduction to as well as an overview of Adobe Premiere Pro.
Chapter 1 includes a getting-started tutorial that introduces you to the basics of cre-
ating a desktop video production by using Adobe Premiere Pro. Chapter 2 provides
an overview of the Premiere Pro interface, its menus, palettes, and tools. Chapter 3
takes a look at how to customize Premiere Pro so that you can save time when cre-
ating projects. Chapter 4 introduces you to Premiere Pro’s basic project settings.
Chapter 5 shows you how to capture video directly into Premiere Pro from a digital
video camcorder or an analog camcorder.
Part II: Editing with Premiere Pro
Part II provides a thorough look at the basics of putting together a digital video pro-
duction. Chapter 6 shows you how to use Premiere Pro’s Timeline and sequences 
to assemble a video production. Chapter 7 continues editing essentials. Chapters 8
and 9 provide a look at Premiere Pro’s audio features. Chapter 10 rounds out this
part with a discussion of how to use transitions to smooth changes from one clip 
to another.
Part III: Working with Type and Graphics
Part III is dedicated to type and graphics. This part shows you how to use the 
Title Designer window and titling tools. You’ll learn how to create titles with styles,
templates, and logos; how to create rolling and scrolling credits; and how to create
titles with drop shadows. You’ll also learn how to create graphics by using the Title
Designer window, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop. Chapters 11 and 12 cover
creating type and graphic effects.

Preface
Part IV: Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Part IV covers advanced editing techniques and special effects. Chapter 13 covers
the sophisticated editing features in Premiere Pro, such as three- and four-point
edits. It also provides a discussion of using Premiere Pro’s Rolling Edit and Ripple
Edit tools as well as using its Slip and Slide editing tools. Chapter 13 also covers
precise frame-by-frame editing by using the Trim window. Chapter 14 reviews the
video effects in the Effects window, while Chapter 15 covers the program’s trans-
parency effects (found in the Keying folder of the Effects window). Chapter 16 pro-
vides you with information on how to create color mattes and backgrounds using
Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. If you want to create motion effects in Premiere
Pro, check out Chapter 17, which provides a thorough look at Motion effects.
Chapter 18 takes you on a guided tour and shows you how to enhance your video
using both Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop.
Part V: Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
After you’ve learned how to create a digital video production in Premiere Pro, 
your next concern is how to output your work in the best possible manner. This
part covers all the bases. Chapter 19 reviews Premiere Pro’s settings for exporting
QuickTime, AVI, and MPEG movies. Chapters 20 and 21 describe how to obtain the
best possible quality when outputting a movie to the Web. Chapter 22 provides a
discussion of outputting to videotape, while Chapter 23 covers outputting to CD-ROM
as well as using Premiere Pro with Macromedia Director and Flash.
Part VI: Premiere Pro and Beyond
The chapters in this section (Chapters 24–30) provide a look at using Premiere Pro
with different software packages, such as Adobe Encore, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe
Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects. Chapters 24 and 25 take you on a tour of how to
use Adobe Encore to create a DVD. Chapter 26 provides a look at how you can use
Adobe After Effects to edit Premiere Pro projects. Chapter 27 shows you how to 
create alpha channels in Photoshop that can be used in Premiere Pro; it also shows
you how to edit Premiere Pro filmstrip files in Photoshop and export them back into
Premiere Pro. Chapter 28 shows how to create graphics and text by using Adobe
Illustrator. These graphics and texts are then imported and used in Adobe Premiere
Pro, many times as masks. Chapters 29 and 30 deal with working with Adobe After
Effects. In Chapter 29, you learn how to create masks using After Effects Bézier
masks. In Chapter 30, you also learn how to use the After Effects powerful motion
paths and how to create composite video clips.

Preface
Part VII: Appendixes
The Adobe Premiere Pro Bible appendixes provide a hardware overview geared to
nontechnical users, a resource guide, and a guide to the Adobe Premiere Pro DVD.
The appendixes also feature a section on how to license QuickTime from Apple
Computer. If you are going to distribute a Premiere Pro movie on a CD-ROM as a
QuickTime movie, you’ll probably want to include QuickTime; therefore, you’ll need
to obtain a software license from Apple Computer. The hardware overview appendix
provides a look at computer systems and IEEE 1394/FireWire ports, and it also pro-
vides a short guide to DV camcorders and audio. The resource appendix provides a
Web guide for digital video and sound equipment as well as the Web addresses for
magazines and publishers specializing in video, audio, and lighting.
Things to Note
The Adobe Premiere Pro Bible runs only on Windows XP Pro and XP Home Edition.
The program’s target user is the video professional.
Key combinations
Here are some conventions in this book that you should note. To save your file,
press Ctrl+ S. When keyboard instructions call for pressing several keys simultane-
ously, the keys are separated by a plus sign. For example, to deselect all clips in the
Timeline, press Ctrl+Shift+A.
Mouse instructions
When the text specifies to click an item, move the mouse pointer over the item 
and click once. Windows users always click the left mouse button unless otherwise
instructed. If the text specifies double-click, click the mouse twice without moving
the mouse.
Menu commands
When the text specifies steps for executing a menu command, the menu and the
command are separated by an arrow symbol, such as Sequence ➪Render Work Area.
When submenus are specified, you’ll often see an arrow separating each menu com-
mand. For instance, to export a project from Premiere Pro, you’ll see the instructions
written as File ➪Export ➪Movie.

Premiere Pro
Quickstart
W
elcome to the world of Adobe Premiere Pro and digital
video. For both experts and beginners alike, Adobe
Premiere Pro packs the power you need to create sophisti-
cated digital video productions. You can create digital movies,
documentaries, sales presentations, and music videos directly
from your desktop computer or laptop. Your digital video pro-
duction can be output to videotape or the Web, or you can
integrate it into projects in other programs, such as Adobe
After Effects, Adobe Live Motion, Macromedia Director, and
Macromedia Flash.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of Adobe Premiere
Pro: understanding what it is and what you can do with it.
This chapter also provides a simple Quickstart project to get
you acquainted with the Adobe Premiere Production process.
You’ll see how easy it is to load digital video clips and graph-
ics into an Adobe Premiere Project and edit them into a short
presentation. After you’ve completed the editing process,
you’ll export the movie as either a QuickTime or Windows
Media file for use in other programs.
What You Can Do with 
Premiere Pro
Whether you need to create a simple video clip for the Web or
a sophisticated documentary or presentation, Premiere Pro has
the tools you need to create a dynamic video production. In
fact, the best way to think about Premiere Pro is to visualize it
as a complete production facility. You would need a room full
of videotape and special effects equipment to do everything
that Premiere Pro can do.

✦Edit digital video clips into a complete digital video production.
✦Capture video from a digital camcorder or videotape recorder.
✦Capture audio from a microphone or audio recording device.
✦Load stock digital graphics, video, and audio clips.
✦Create titles and animated title effects, such as scrolling or rolling titles.
✦Integrate files from different sources into your production. Premiere Pro 
loads not only digital video and audio files, but also Adobe Photoshop, 
Adobe Illustrator, JPEG, and TIFF graphics.
✦Create special effects, such as distortions, blurring, and pinching.
✦Create motion effects in which logos or graphics move or bounce across the
screen.
✦Create transparency effects. You can superimpose titles over backgrounds or
use color, such as blue or green, to mask the background from one image so
that you can superimpose a new background.
✦Edit sound. Premiere Pro enables you to cut and assemble audio clips as well
as create sophisticated audio effects, such as cross fades and pans.
✦Create transitions. Premiere Pro can create simple dissolves from one scene
to another, as well as a host of sophisticated transition effects, such as page
curls and curtain wipes.
✦Output files in a variety of digital formats. Premiere Pro can output QuickTime
and Video for Windows files, which can be viewed directly in other programs,
as well as streamed over the Web. Premiere Pro also features Web-specific file
formats, such as animated GIF.
✦Output files to videotape.
How Premiere Pro Works
To understand the Premiere Production process, you need a basic understanding 
of the steps involved in creating a conventional videotape production in which the
production footage is not digitized. In traditional, or linear, video production, all
production elements are transferred to videotape. During the editing process, the
final production is electronically edited onto one final or program videotape. Even
though computers are used while editing, the linear or analog nature of videotape
makes the process very time-consuming; during the actual editing session, video-
tape must be loaded and unloaded from tape or cassette machines. Time is wasted

Chapter 1 ✦Premiere Pro Quickstart
as producers simply wait for videotape machines to reach the correct editing point.
The production is usually assembled sequentially. If you want to go back to a previ-
ous scene and replace it with one that is shorter or longer, all subsequent scenes
must be rerecorded to the program reel.
Nonlinear video-editing programs such as Premiere Pro have revolutionized the
entire process of video editing. Digital video and Premiere Pro eliminate many of
the time-consuming production chores of traditional editing. When using Premiere
Pro, you don’t need to hunt for tapes or load and remove them from tape machines.
When producers use Premiere Pro, all production elements are digitized to disk. An
icon in Premiere Pro’s Project window represents each element in a production,
whether it is a video clip, a sound clip, or a still image. The final production is rep-
resented by icons in a window called the Timeline. The focal points of the Timeline
are its video and audio tracks, which appear as parallel bars that stretch from left
to right across the Timeline. When you need to use a video clip, sound clip, or still
image, you simply click it in the Project window and drag it to a track in the Timeline
window. You can place the items of your production down sequentially or drag them
anywhere to different tracks. As you work, you can access any portion of your pro-
duction by clicking with the mouse in the desired portion in the Timeline window.
You can also use the mouse to click either the beginning or end of a clip and shorten
or extend the clip’s duration.
To fine-tune your edits, you can view and edit the clips frame by frame in the
Timeline window. You can also set in and out points in the Monitor window. Setting
an in point affects where a clip starts playing, and setting an out point affects where
a clip stops playing. Because all clips are digitized (and no videotape is involved),
Premiere Pro can quickly adjust the final production as you edit.
The following list summarizes some of the digital-editing magic that you can per-
form in Premiere Pro by simply dragging clips in the Timeline:
✦Rolling edit. As you click and drag to add frames to the clip in the Timeline,
Premiere Pro automatically subtracts from the frames in the next clip. As you
click and drag to remove frames, Premiere Pro automatically adds back frames
from the next clip in the Timeline.
✦Ripple edit. As you add or subtract frames, Premiere Pro automatically adds
to or subtracts from the entire program’s duration.
✦Slip edit. Dragging a clip to the left or right automatically changes in and out
points without changing the program duration.
✦Slide edit. Dragging a clip to the left or right keeps its duration intact but
changes the in or out points of the preceding or succeeding clip.
Chapters 7 and 13 both provide in-depth discussion of Premiere Pro editing 
techniques.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
As you work, you can easily preview edits, special effects, and transitions. Changing
edits and effects is often a simple matter of changing in and out points. There’s no
hunting down the right videotape or waiting for the production to be reassembled
on tape. When all of your editing is completed, you can export the file to videotape
or create a new digital file in one of several formats. You can export it as many times
as you want, in as many different file formats as you want. Furthermore, if you want
to add more special effects to your Premiere Pro projects, you can easily import them
into Adobe After Effects. You can also integrate your Premiere Pro movie into a Web
page using Adobe GoLive.
Adobe After Effects is covered in Chapters 26 and 30. Adobe GoLive is discussed in
Chapter 20.
Your First Video Production
The following sections provide a Quickstart tutorial that leads you step by step
through the basics of video production in Premiere Pro. As you work through the
tutorial, you’ll learn how to place clips in the Timeline, edit clips in the Monitor 
window, apply transitions, and fade video and audio.
In this project, you’ll create a simple video sequence called Nite Out. Figure 1-1
shows frames of the production in Premiere Pro’s Timeline window. The clips used
to create the project are from Digital Vision’s Night Moves CD-ROM. The production
begins with a title created in Adobe Title Designer, viewed over an opening scene of
people walking in the city. After a few seconds, a dissolve transitions to the scene 
of diners in a restaurant. Soon the dining scene dissolves into one showing kitchen
workers preparing food. The project ends with another title superimposed over the
last scene.
Starting a Premiere Pro project
A Premiere Pro digital video production is called a project instead of a video produc-
tion. The reason for this is that Premiere Pro not only enables you to create the pro-
duction, but it also enables you to create and store titles, transitions, and effects.
Thus, the file you work in is much more than just a production — it’s truly a project.
Your first step in creating a digital video production in Premiere Pro is to create a
new project. Here’s how:
1. To load Premiere Pro, double-click the Adobe Premiere Pro icon. When you
load Premiere Pro, the program automatically assumes that you want to create
a new project or open one previously created.
2. To create a new project, click the New Project icon. If Premiere Pro is already
loaded, you can create a new project by choosing File ➪New Project.

If Premiere Pro is already loaded and you already have a project onscreen, you
need to close that project because you can only have one project open at a time.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Specifying project settings
Before you can start importing files and editing, you must specify video and audio
settings for the project. The New Project dialog box, shown in Figure 1-2, appears
whenever you create a new project. This dialog box enables you to quickly choose
predetermined video and audio settings. The most important project settings deter-
mine the frame rate (frames per second) and the frame size (viewing area) of your
project as well as how the digital video will be compressed.
For a detailed description of project settings, see Chapter 4.
Figure 1-2: Use the New Project dialog box to pick 
project presets.
As a general rule, choose project settings that match your source footage. The
footage used for this tutorial conforms to a video standard called NTSC D1. The
frame size is 720 by 486. The audio file is 16-bit 44 kHz.
1. To work with the tutorial footage, choose the DV NTSC Standard 32 kHz.
After you click, Premiere Pro displays information about the project settings. 
Notice that the Frame Size is 720 by 480, the standard DV frame size (which is
close enough to our 720 by 480 footage. Also note that under Video Settings,
the display reads D1/DV Pixel Aspect Ratio (0.9). This indicates that you are
creating a project for footage with non-square pixels. Since the tutorial footage
uses non-square pixels, this is the correct choice for the project. However, since
the tutorial audio is 44 kHz (better quality than 32 kHz, you need to change
one of the audio presets. 
2. To change a preset, click the Custom Settings tab.
3. In the Audio section of the dialog box, click the Sample Rate pop-up menu
and choose 44 kHz.

To learn more about Pixel Aspect Ratio and choosing project settings see Chapter 4.
Audio Samples are discussed in Chapter 8.
4. Select a location to store your file. If you want to change the default location,
click Browse and use the mouse to navigate to the folder where you want to
store your file. 
5. Enter a name such as Nite Out in the name field. 
6. To open your new project, click OK.
Setting a workspace
Before you start editing, you may want to set your workspace so that you can easily
view the most important Premiere Pro windows used in editing. This is easily accom-
plished by picking an editing workspace. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Editing.
This opens the Project, Monitor, and Timeline windows as well as the Info and
History palettes. In this tutorial, you use the Project window as your home for source
footage. You’ll edit your clips in the Timeline and Monitor window, and you’ll view
the edited project in the Monitor window.
If the Timeline doesn’t open, double-click Sequence 01 in the Project window. The
sequence will open onscreen in the Timeline window.
Importing production elements
You can place and edit video, audio, and still images in your Premiere Pro projects
as long as they are in a digital format. Table 1-1 lists the major file formats that
Premiere Pro supports. All media footage, or clips, must first be saved to disk. Even
if your video is stored on a digital camcorder, it still must be transferred to disk.
Premiere Pro can capture the digital video clips and automatically store them in
your projects. Analog media such as motion picture film and videotape must first
be digitized before Premiere Pro can use it. In this case, Premiere Pro, in conjunc-
tion with a capture board, can capture your clips directly into a project.
For more information about capturing video and audio, see Chapter 5.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
After the Premiere Pro windows open, you’re ready to import the various graphic
and sound elements that will comprise your digital video production. All the items
that you import are stored in the Project window. An icon represents each item.
Next to the icon, Premiere Pro displays whether the item is a video clip, an audio
clip, or a graphic.
When importing files into Premiere Pro, you can choose whether to import one file,
multiple files (by pressing and holding the Shift key), or an entire folder. If desired,
you can even import one project into another, using the File ➪Import ➪Project
command.
Here’s how to load the production elements for the Nite Out project:
1. Choose File ➪Import.
2. Open the Tutorial Projects folder on the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible
DVD-ROM.
3. If you want to load the files, select the Nite Out folder in the Chapter 1 folder
and then click Import Folder. The Nite Out folder now appears in the Project
window.
The video clips (705008f.mov, 705009f.mov and 705029f.mov) used in the Nite
Out project are from Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD. The sound clip (705001.aif)
used in the Nite Out project is also from Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD. The Nite
Out folder is in the Chapter 1 folder in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that
accompanies this book.
4. To view the titles, and video and audio clips, double-click the Nite Out
folder in the Project window.
5. Rename each clip. Because the names of imported clips may not clearly
describe their footage, you can rename them in the Project window. To rename
a clip, click on it in the Project window and choose Clip ➪Rename. (As a
shortcut, you can also right-click the clip and then rename it.) Here are the file-
names and the new names to use:
•
Name the 705001.aif audio clip: Background Music.
•
Name the 705008f clip: Diners.
•
Name the 705009f clip: Chefs.
•
Name the 705029f clip: Walkers.
Figure 1-3 shows the Project window with all the clips needed to create the Nite Out
project clip. Notice that the Project window displays the Start and Stop time of each
clip as well as its duration.
On the
DVD-ROM

Chapter 1 ✦Premiere Pro Quickstart
Figure 1-3: The Project window with the items needed to 
create the Nite Out project.
The Nite Out project requires the following files:
✦A video clip showing shadows of people walking in the city (Walkers)
✦A video clip of people out in a restaurant (Diners)
✦A video clip of chefs working in a restaurant (Chefs)
✦Two title files created using templates from Adobe Title Designer
✦A sound clip of background music
The video footage was captured at 30 frames per second. Although not necessary
for this tutorial, you could change the footage frame rate to the Project frame rate
by selecting the footage in the Project window and choosing File ➪Interpret
Footage. In the Interpret Footage dialog box, you can enter a new frame rate for
the footage.
Creating titles in Premiere Pro is discussed in Chapter 11.
Viewing clips in the Project window
Before you begin assembling your production, you may want to view a clip or
graphic, or listen to an audio track. You can see a thumbnail preview of any of the
clips in the Project window by clicking the clip. The preview appears at the upper-
left corner of the Project window. If you are previewing a video or audio clip, a small
triangle (Play button) appears to the left of the thumbnail preview window. Click
the Play button to see a preview of a video clip or to hear an audio clip. If you pre-
fer, you can click and drag the tiny slider below the thumbnail preview to gradually
view the clip.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Double-clicking the clip in the Project window opens the clip in the Monitor win-
dow. You can preview the clip there by clicking the Play button.
Assembling production elements
After you import all of your production elements, you need to place them in a
sequence in the Timeline window so that you can start editing your project. 
A sequence is a graphical preview of the footage that you are editing. Using the
mouse, you can place, edit, rearrange, and create transitions in the Timeline win-
dow sequence.
If you are working on long projects in Premiere Pro, you’ll probably want to break
your work into multiple sequences. After you’ve edited the sequences, you can
drag them into another Timeline window where they’ll appear as nested
sequences. Using nested sequences is discussed in Chapter 6.
Placing clips in the Timeline
To move an item from the Project window to the Timeline window, simply click it in
the Project window and then drag it to a track in the Timeline window. The item then
appears in the Timeline as an icon. The duration of the clip or graphic is represented
by the length of the clip in the Timeline.
You can place clips directly in the Timeline by opening them in the Monitor window,
then clicking the Insert or Overlay button. This technique is discussed in Chapter 7.
Selecting clips in the Timeline
You’ll spend a great deal of time positioning clips in the Timeline while editing your
production. Premiere Pro’s Selection and Range Select tools help you assemble
your program’s clips in the order you want.
Here’s how to select and move clips:
✦Single clip. Click the Selection tool (the arrow icon in the upper-left corner 
of the Timeline). Next, click in the middle of the clip in the Timeline window.
(To quickly activate the Selection tool, press V on your keyboard.) With the
clip selected, click and drag it to the desired location.
✦Multiple clips. Click the Range Select tool (the empty dotted-line square icon
in the toolbox located to the right of the Selection tool). Next, click and drag
over the clips that you want to select. To select the Range Select tool using
your keyboard, press M.
Figure 1-4 displays the Timeline window for the Nite Out project. The title appears
in the Video 2 track. We put it here because it enables us to create a transparency
effect in which we fade in the title text over background video. The Walkers video
clip appears in track Video 1, as does the next clip (the Diners clip). Between the two

tracks is a transition. In this case, we dragged a dissolve from the Effects window.
The project also ends with a transition to a scene of chefs working in a kitchen,
before the final title appears and then fades out.

Nite Out video project.
Trying out the Timeline window
As mentioned earlier, the Timeline window provides a graphical overview of your
project. Before continuing, try changing zoom settings, moving the Timeline indica-
tor, and expanding a video track. Doing so will help familiarize you with the Timeline
tools you need as you work in this chapter.
Changing the zoom level
Most Premiere Pro users create their video projects at 29.97 or 30 frames per sec-
ond. Viewing all of these frames on the Timeline quickly consumes Timeline space.
As you work, you’ll probably want to zoom in and out between close-up and bird’s-
eye views of your work. When you zoom in, you’ll see fewer frames, which may make
fine-tuning your project easier, particularly because the space between time intervals
in the Timeline expands. When you want an overview of your entire project, you may
want to zoom out.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
To zoom in and out, click the Timeline zoom level slider in the lower-left corner of
the Timeline. Figure 1-4 shows the Timeline zoom slider as well as the zoom in and
zoom out buttons. Clicking and dragging left (zooming out) shows more footage in
the Timeline; clicking and dragging to the right (zooming in) shows less footage.
For example, if you zoom out, a one-minute clip will take up less space in the
Timeline — which means you’ll be able to see many different clips as well as your
one-minute clip. If you zoom in a one-minute clip will occupy more space in the
Timeline, which means that it may be the only clip visible.
Moving the current-time indicator
The current-time indicator (sometimes referred to as CTI) is the blue triangular icon
at the tip of the ruler area in the Timeline. If you click and drag the current current-
time indicator, you move the red edit line. The edit line shows you the current editing
position in the Monitor window. Try clicking and dragging the current current-time
indicator. Notice that as you drag the blue current time readout changes, showing
your current position in the Timeline. In Figure 1-4, the edit line is on the 4-second
mark on the Timeline, and the current time reads 00;00;04;00. If you want to quickly
jump to an area in the Timeline, just click in the ruler area. If you want to slowly
move through the Timeline one frame at a time, press the right or left arrow keys.
Expanding tracks
By default, you’ll see three video tracks in the Timeline. If you expand a track, you
can see video frames in the track and video effects. Later, you’ll change the display
style to show frames in the video tracks, and volume in audio tracks. The white dots
in the audio and video tracks in Figure 1-4 are keyframes, which indicate a change
in volume or opacity. By default, Video track 1 and Audio track 1 are expanded. In
this project, you will also be using Video track 2. Try expanding it now by clicking
the right-pointing triangle to the left of Video track 2.
Adding the title to the Timeline
Start the production process by adding the opening title to the Timeline. The title
includes an alpha channel, which allows the background video to be seen beneath the
title. The title was created from a template in Premiere Pro’s Title Designer. In this
section, you’ll place the title in the Video 2 track because it enables you to easily
fade in the text over the video in lower tracks.
See Chapter 11 to learn more about Adobe Title Designer.
The following steps explain how to add the title to the Timeline window, fading it in
and out:
Cross-
Reference

Chapter 1 ✦Premiere Pro Quickstart
1. Click the Nite Out title (TitleOpen) in the Project window and drag it into
Video track 2.
2. If you would like the clip to appear longer in the Timeline, zoom in by
clicking and dragging the zoom slider to the right.
3. Now view the footage as individual frames in the Timeline. In Video track 2,
click the Set Display Style drop-down menu and choose Show Frames. (This
drop-down menu is a tiny box directly below the Eye icon in the track.)
4. Reduce the length of the title to 4 seconds by clicking and dragging left on
the right end of the title. Use the time readout at the top of the Timeline as a
guide.
Here’s a technique that will allow you to work more precisely in the Timeline. Click
and drag the current-time indicator to the 4-second mark. Then use the red edit
line as a stopping point when you click and drag on the end of the title clip.
Fading in the title
Next, you’ll fade in the titles. In Figure 1-4, the diagonal line immediately in the track
represents the fade-in effect. The diagonal line indicates that the title fades in grad-
ually over the first second. In this section, you’ll create the fade-in effect by chang-
ing the opacity of the title clip in the Effects Control window. Figure 1-5 shows the
Effect Controls window and the Opacity slider. The diamonds on the right side of the
window are called keyframes. Each time you make a change in the Opacity setting,
Premiere Pro creates a keyframe; then Premiere Pro adjusts the opacity between
the keyframes to gradually change.
Figure 1-5: Use the Opacity slider to create keyframes, 
which create a gradual fade-in effect.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
The following steps show you how to change opacity.
1. Display the Opacity handles in the track. Click in the Show Keyframes drop-
down menu (the tiny box to the right of the Set Display Style drop-down menu)
and choose Show Opacity Handles.
2. Select the TitleOpen file in the Timeline by clicking it.
3. Open the Effect Controls window by choosing Window ➪Effect Controls.
Before continuing, note that the Effect Controls window includes a Zoom slider
in the lower left and a current-time indicator. Both function exactly as they 
do in the Timeline window.
4. Now expand the Opacity control by clicking the right-pointing triangle but-
ton (to the left of the word Opacity). The Opacity control expands. You can
easily change opacity by clicking and dragging the Opacity slider. To view the
slider, click the right-pointing arrow button to the left of the stopwatch in the
Opacity section.
5. Lower the opacity to 0. To lower opacity, click and drag left until the display
reads 0%, as shown in Figure 1-5.
6. Now drag the current-time indicator in the Effect Controls window to the 
1-second mark. As you click and drag, you’ll see the time display change in
the lower-left corner. Stop when you reach 1 second.
7. Now raise the opacity back to 100 percent. Click and drag the slider to the
right. As you drag, the percentage begins to increase.
8. The change in opacity created two keyframes, one at the start of the clip and
another one second later. Between the two keyframes, Premiere Pro adjusts
opacity to gradually increase from 0 to 100 percent
9. Now create a fade out at the 3-second mark. Click and drag the current-time
indicator to the 3-second mark, then click the Add/Remove Keyframe button.
Then drag the Timeline indicator slider to the 4-second mark. Click and drag
the Opacity slider to set it to 0%. After you make the change, Premiere Pro
adds another keyframe to the window. When you’re done, the Effect Controls
window should resemble Figure 1-5.
You can also change video opacity directly in the Timeline with the Pen tool.
Control+clicking on the Opacity rubberband in the Timeline creates keyframes.
After you create keyframes, you can adjust opacity by clicking and dragging with
the Pen tool.
If you need to delete a keyframe, right-click it and choose Clear.

Trimming clips in the Timeline window
You can edit video and audio clips in several ways. We’ll start simply by editing the
first clip by clicking and dragging its out point in the Timeline. Before editing a clip,
you may want to play it in the Monitor window. To play any clip, double-click the
video clip in the Project window. When the Monitor window appears, click the Play
button to view the clip. The Play button is shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6: The Monitor window’s Play button.
The following steps explain how to add the first video clip, the Walkers clip, to the
Timeline window. If you haven’t viewed the clip, you can play it by double-clicking 
it in the Project window, then clicking the Play button in the Monitor window.
Alternatively, you can play a thumbnail version of it in the Project window. Click it
in the Project window and then click the left arrow button at the top of the Project
window. Also note that the clip is 14 seconds long. You only need the first 4 seconds
of it.
1. Drag the Walkers clip from the Project window into the Video 1 track.
Position the clip so that it starts where the title fade-in ends — about 1 second
on the Timeline. If you want to be precise, drag the Timeline indicator to the
1-second mark and then drag the Walkers clip to the current-time indicator
edit line. When the clip touches the edit line, it will snap to it.
2. Position the mouse pointer at the end of the clip. The cursor changes to a
bracket.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
3. Click and drag to the left to shorten the clip. Make the clip about 4 seconds
long so that it ends on the 5-second mark (00;00;05;00) on the Timeline. Once
again, you may want to drag the current-time indicator to the 5-second mark
first and then adjust the clip by clicking and dragging the right edge of the clip
so it snaps on the edit line.
If you get lost in the Timeline and inadvertently move out of the edited area, zoom
out so that you can see the clips you’ve placed in the Timeline, move the current-
time indicator into the edited area, and then zoom in.
Previewing in the Monitor window
To view the video production so far, you can play the program in the Monitor win-
dow. Make sure that the Monitor window is open by choosing Window ➪Monitor.
The right side of the Monitor window displays the program being edited in the cur-
rent sequence in the Timeline window, as shown in Figure 1-6. The left side shows
source clips. To play from the beginning to the end of your project, click the Play In
to Out button at the bottom of the right side of the Monitor window.
As soon as you click, the video clip rewinds and begins playing in the window. As it
plays you’ll see the clip fade in, and you’ll see the Walkers clip superimposed beneath
the opening title. The Walkers clip appears only in the black area of the Title clip.
Editing in the Monitor window
The Monitor window provides precise controls for editing clips. Using the Monitor
window, you can easily navigate to specific frames and then mark in or out points.
After you set the in and out points, you can drag the clip directly to the Timeline.
Now you’ll set the in and out points in the Monitor window. To learn about the dif-
ferent ways to edit a video clip, see Chapters 7 and 13.
You can also click the Insert or Overlay button in the Monitor window to place a
clip in the Timeline. This technique is described in Chapter 7.
By default, Premiere Pro automatically snaps two adjacent clips together. You can
turn snap on or off by clicking the Magnet icon in the Timeline window.
1. Double-click the clip in the Project window. This opens the clip in the left side
of the Monitor window, shown in Figure 1-7. The left side of the window shows
source clips, and the right side of the window shows the edited sequence in the
Timeline window. If the current-time indicator is on the Walkers clip, you’ll see
it in the Sequence section of the Monitor window.
2. Play the clip by clicking the Play button in the left side of the Monitor win-
dow. The scene eventually shows a waitress handing out menus. Before you
edit the clip’s in and out points, you need to go to the precise frame that you
want to edit.

Go to In Point button.
4. Now you want to be able to slowly move through the clip to set the in point.
Here are several options:
• Click the current-time indicator in the Monitor window and drag. As you
drag, you’ll move or scrub through the clip frame by frame.
• Click and drag in the jog tread at the bottom of the Monitor window. As
you click and drag, you’ll move through the clip frame by frame.
• Click and hold down the shuttle control to move in slow or fast motion.
Speed is controlled by how far left or right you move the shuttle. Moving
right moves forward through the clip. Dragging the shuttle to the left
moves backward.
• Click the Step back or Step forward button to move one frame at a time
forward or backward.

7. Click the Set Out Point button (refer to Figure 1-7).
To clear an in or out point, press Alt, while clicking the in or out point button.
8. Now drag the clip to the Timeline so that it snaps to the Walkers clip.
Although you edited the clip, the original clip on your hard disk is untouched. At
any point in time, you can reedit the clip to return the missing parts.
Creating a transition
Now view your production by previewing it in the Monitor window. To start the 
preview from the beginning of the Timeline, click the Play In to Out button in the
Sequence section of the Monitor window. As you watch the preview, notice that the
cut from the Walkers clip to the Diners clip is quite abrupt. To smooth the flow of
the production, you’ll add a transition between the two clips.
For more information on using transitions, turn to Chapter 10.
Here’s how to add a Cross Dissolve transition to your project:
1. Open the Effects window by choosing Window ➪Show Effects palette, 
if it is not already open.
2. In the Effects palette, open the Video Transitions folder by clicking its 
triangle icon.
3. Open the Dissolve folder by clicking its triangle icon.
4. To add the transition to your project, click and drag it to beginning of the
Diners clip or between the Walkers and the Diners clip.
5. To open the window for the Cross Dissolve, double-click the Cross Dissolve
icon in the Timeline. This opens the transition in the Effect Controls window.
6. Adjust the position and length of the transition. You can adjust the position
and the duration of the transition by clicking and dragging the mouse on the
transition icon in the Effect Controls window. However, the fastest technique
is to enter a value in the Duration readout and change settings in the Alignment
drop-down menu. Set the Duration to 2 seconds by changing the time readout
to 00;00;02;00. Then choose Center at Cut in the Alignment drop-down menu,
as shown in Figure 1-8.

footage, select Show Actual Sources.
Previewing the transition
Premiere Pro includes a real-time preview feature that enables you to view transi-
tions and video effects as you work. Press the spacebar to play the project and
show transitions.
Editing the Chefs clip
Next, you’ll add the Chefs clip to the program and edit it in the Monitor window:
1. Double-click the Chefs clip in the Project window. This opens the clip in the
source section of the Monitor window.
2. Set the in point. Click and drag the current-time indicator in the Monitor win-
dow (in the area below the Monitor preview and above the Play button) to
choose a frame at about a little more than 3 seconds into the clip. Click the
Set In Point button.
3. Set the out point. Click and drag the Monitor window’s current-time indicator
to find a point about 6 and 1⁄2 seconds into the clip. Watch the time display at
the bottom-right of the window to pick the frame. When you have found the
frame you want, click the Set Out Point button.
4. After you’ve set the in and out points, you can drag the clip from either the
Project window or you can drag it directly from the Timeline.

Adding another dissolve
Now create another transition—this time between the Diners clip and the Chefs clip:
1. Open the Dissolve folder in the Effects window.
2. Drag the Cross Dissolve transition over the Chefs clip.
3. Double-click the transition icon between the Diners and Chefs clips in the
Timeline.
4. In the Effect Controls window, set the Alignment pop-up menu to Center of
Cut. If you want to change the duration of the transition, edit the Duration time
display.
Adding the last title
Your next step is to add the end title to the Video 2 track:
1. Drag the end title image (Title End) from the Project window to the Video 2
track. Position the title clip so that it begins where the Chefs clip starts.
2. Drag the clip’s end point to make its duration 3 seconds long or select the
title and choose Clip ➪Speed/Duration. In the Clip Speed Duration dialog
box, set the display to 00;00;03;00 and click OK.
3. Create the fade in and fade out as you did for the opening title. Remember
to select the clip in the Timeline, then open the Effect Controls window by
choosing Window ➪Effect Controls. Use Figure 1-4 as a reference.
4. Preview your work, by pressing Spacebar.
Adding and fading in the audio track
Now that the majority of editing is complete, it’s time to add the audio track.
Fortunately, the Timeline treats audio much the same as it treats video. In this 
section, you drag the music track to the Timeline, then use the Pen tool to create 
a keyframe in the audio channel.
1. Listen to the Background Music clip by double-clicking it in the Project 
window. After the clip opens in the Monitor window, click the Play button.
2. Drag the Background Music clip from the Project window to the Audio 1
track in the Timeline window. Line up the beginning of the audio track with
the beginning of the video track.
3. Expand the Audio 1 track by clicking the triangle icon at the far left of the
track.
4. Click the Audio track’s Show keyframes drop down menu and choose Show
Clip Volume.
5. Activate the Pen tool in the tool palette.

23
Chapter 1 ✦Premiere Pro Quickstart
6. With the Pen tool activated, Ctrl+click at the beginning of the audio to create
keyframe. 
7. Create another keyframe about 2 seconds into the track by Ctrl+clicking
again with the Pen tool.
8. Use the Pen tool to drag down the start of the volume line.
9. Use the Pen tool to create a keyframe at the end of the audio. About 1 second
from the end, use the Pen tool to drag the volume line down to fade out.
10. Preview your project to see the production and hear the fade out. If you
want to fine-tune the effect, use the Pen tool to adjust the volume line in the
audio track.
Audio fade-ins can also be created by using the Crossfade audio transition. See
Chapter 8 to learn more about audio effects. Also note that Premiere Pro allows
you to change the volume of the entire audio track as well as individual clips.
Fine-tuning the project
The project you’ve worked on is a simple introduction to editing in Premiere Pro.
Feel free to enhance, change, and re-edit as you desire. If you want, create a fade up
from black or fade out to black. You can create pure black video and place it in a
video track. To create black, choose File ➪New ➪Black Video. This command
places the black video clip into the Project window. From there, you can drag it into
the Timeline. If you want to fade in or out, place the clip in Video track 2. You might
also want to add a fade out to the Chefs clip. You can easily do so by selecting the
clip and changing the opacity of the last second of the clip.
Exporting your first movie
When you finish editing your movie, you can export it in a variety of different 
formats. Premiere Pro enables you to export movies in video formats such as
QuickTime, RealVideo, and Advanced Windows Media, as well as formats for DVDs.
Here is a summary of Premiere Pro’s export commands:
✦If you want to export your file in a format for Web or DVD use, you can use
Premiere Pro’s Adobe Media Encoder. The Media Encoder allows you to 
create MPEG, Windows Media, Real Video, and QuickTime streaming files.
✦If you want to export your movie as an AVI, QuickTime, or animated GIF file,
choose File ➪Export Movie.
✦If you want to export your movie to videotape, choose File ➪Export to Tape.
The following section shows how to export a Windows Media file using the Adobe
Media Encoder. A later section shows you how to export your project as a QuickTime
movie.
Note

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Exporting a Windows Media file
If you are a Windows user, you may want to export your project in Windows Media
format. This format can be read by most Windows users, and can be used for projects
that appear on the Web. To export your movie in Windows Media format, follow these
steps:
1. Choose File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder. The Transcode Settings dialog
box appears (see Figure 1-9).
2. In the Format pop-up menu, choose Windows Media.
3. Click a preset. For example, if you want to export your file for multiple Web
audiences and want to export your file for users with a high-speed Internet
connection, you could choose WMA9 NTSC512. The summary information 
displays frame height, frame rate, and other exporting details. To continue
with the export, click OK.
4. Select a destination folder in which to store the finished Windows Media file,
and enter a filename. In the Destination section, click the button with three
dots on it. This opens the Save As dialog box where you can navigate to the
folder area where you want to save your file.
5. In the Export range drop-down menu, choose Entire Sequence, if it isn’t
already chosen.
6. To start the export, click Save.

Chapter 1 ✦Premiere Pro Quickstart
Exporting a QuickTime movie
Both Mac and Windows users can export Premiere Pro projects as QuickTime
movies. QuickTime is widely used on the Web and can be imported into other pro-
grams such as Macromedia Director and Macromedia Flash. Depending on the final
destination of your project, you may want to change the frame size and frame rate
of your video before exporting. For example, if you want to export a file composed
of DV footage to a multimedia project, you’ll probably want to reduce the DV frame
size from 720 × 480 to a smaller size that fits comfortably into your production.
Here are the steps for exporting your project as a QuickTime movie:
1. Select the Timeline window, or select the Sequence 01 in the Project window.
2. Choose File ➪Export ➪Movie. The Export Movie dialog box appears.
3. Click the Settings button. The Export Movie Settings dialog box appears, in
which you can view export settings.
4. Choose QuickTime from the File Type drop-down list, as shown in Figure 1-10.
5. To switch frame size and frame rate, choose Video from the list box at the
upper-left of the dialog box. The Video Settings dialog box appears. These
settings are covered in detail in Chapter 4.
6. If you are creating a multimedia project that will play on a computer, select
either Sorenson or Cinepak as the compressor. Optionally, you can change
the frame size to 320 × 240 and change the frame rate, if desired. If you will be
outputting the file for computers with older CD-ROM drives, you need to lower
the data rate to about 250 Kbps. Doing so slows the data rate to prevent frames
from being dropped during playback.
A note about rendering and playback quality
As Premiere Pro plays your program in the Monitor window, it attempts to adjust the out-
put to deliver the highest quality possible. If possible, it tries to play back at the project’s full
frame rate. If a portion of your program cannot be properly displayed, a red preview bar
appears onscreen. This indicates that the area must be rendered to disk. After rendering,
Premiere Pro uses the rendered disk file to properly display the effect. If you want to render
your entire project, press Enter. If you want to render only a portion of your project, first
adjust the work area bar so that it only encompasses the area that you want to render, then
press Enter. If you want to lower the processing requirements so that you can see effects at
a lower quality setting without rendering, you can change to Draft Quality in the Monitor
pop-up menu.
It’s also important to note that despite the Quality Setting in the Monitor window, playback
quality in the Monitor window will not be as high as that of exported video. When Premiere
Pro processes video in the Monitor window, it uses bilinear pixel resampling. When
Premiere Pro exports, it uses cubic resampling, a higher quality method that also produces
higher quality sound.

26
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
7. After you make your changes, click OK. Premiere Pro returns you to the
Export Movie dialog box.
8. In the Export Movie dialog box, type a name for your file.
9. Click OK. Premiere Pro builds the export file and soon opens it in the Monitor
window for viewing.
Figure 1-10: Choose QuickTime in the File Type 
drop-down menu.

Premiere Pro
Basics
T
he Adobe Premiere Pro user interface is a combination of
a video-editing studio and an electronic image-editing
studio. If you’re familiar with film, video editing, or audio edit-
ing, you’ll feel right at home working within Premiere Pro’s
Project, Monitor, and Audio windows. If you’ve worked with
such programs as Adobe After Effects, Adobe Live Motion,
Macromedia Flash, or Macromedia Director, Premiere Pro’s
Timeline, digital tools, and palettes will seem familiar. If you’re
completely new to video editing and computers, don’t worry;
Premiere Pro palettes, windows, and menus are efficiently
designed to get you up and running quickly.
To help get you started, this chapter provides an overview 
of Premiere Pro windows, menus, and palettes. Consider it a
thorough introduction to the program’s workspace and a handy
reference for planning and producing your own digital video
productions.
Premiere Pro’s Windows
After you first launch Premiere Pro, several windows automat-
ically appear onscreen, each vying for your attention. Why do
you need more than one window open at once? A video produc-
tion is a multifaceted undertaking. In one production, you may
need to capture video, edit video, and create titles, transitions,
and special effects. Premiere Pro windows help keep these
tasks separated and organized for you.
This section provides an overview of the windows that enable
you to create the various elements of your digital video project:
the Project, Timeline, and Audio Mixer windows. The History,
Video/Audio Effects, and Tools palettes float above all other
windows. We discuss them separately in the Premiere Pro’s
floating palettes section.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Manipulating Premiere Pro windows
Although the Premiere Pro program’s primary windows open automatically onscreen
from time to time, you may want to close one of them. To close a window, simply click
its close window X icon. If you try to close the Project window, Premiere Pro assumes
that you want to close the entire project and prompts you to save your work before
closing. If you want to open the Timeline, Monitor, Audio Mixer, History, Info, or Tools
windows, choose the Window menu and then click the desired window name. If you
have more than one timeline on the screen, you’ll see it listed in the Window ➪
Timelines submenu.
If you have your windows and palettes set up in specific positions at specific sizes,
you can save this configuration by choosing Window ➪Workspace➪Save Workspace.
After you name your workspace and save it, the name of the workspace appears in
the Window ➪Workspace submenu. Any time you want to use that workspace, sim-
ply click its name.
The Project window
If you’ve ever worked on a project with many video and audio clips as well as other
production elements, you’ll soon appreciate the Premiere Pro program’s Project
window, which is shown in Figure 2-1. The Project window provides a quick bird’s-
eye view of your production elements and enables you to preview a clip right from
the Project window.
In Figure 2-1, the Project window includes two video clips, diners.mov and
chefs.mov, which are from the Nite Out project found in Chapter 1. Both clips are
from Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD (705008f.mov and 705009f.mov). The din-
ers.mov is Digital Vision’s clip 705008f.mov, and the chefs.mov is Digital Vision’s
clip 705009f.mov.
As you work, Premiere Pro automatically loads items into the Project window. When
you import a file, the video and audio clips are automatically loaded into a Project
window bin (a folder in the Project window). If you import a folder of clips, Premiere
Pro creates a new bin for the clips, using the folder name as the bin name. When
you capture sound or video, you can quickly add the captured media to a Project
window bin before closing the clip. Later you can create your own bins by clicking
the Bin button, at which point you can drag production elements from one bin to
another. The New Item button enables you to quickly create a new title or other
production element, such as a color matte (covered in Chapter 13) or bars and tone
(used to calibrate color and sound when editing). The Project window also includes
a New Item button that allows you to add new sequences, offline files, titles, bars
and tone, black video, color mattes, or universal counting leaders. If you click the
Note

Chapter 2 ✦Premiere Pro Basics
Icon button, all production elements appear as icons onscreen rather than in list
format. Clicking the List button returns the display of the Project Window to List
view. If you want to quickly add Project window elements to the Timeline, you can
simply select them and then click the Automate to Sequence button.
If you expand the Project window by clicking and dragging the Window border,
you’ll see that Premiere Pro lists the Start and Stop time as well as the in and out
points and the duration of each clip. In the Project window, production elements
are grouped according to the current sort order. You can change the order of pro-
duction elements so that they are arranged by any of the column headings. To sort
by one of the column categories, simply click it. The first time you click, production
items are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending arrow, click again on the
column heading. The sort order is represented by a small triangle. When the arrow
points up, the sort order is ascending. When it points down, the sort order is
descending.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
To keep your production materials well organized, you can create bins to store sim-
ilar elements. For example, you may create a bin for all sound elements or a bin for
all interview clips. If the bin gets stuffed, you can see more elements at one time by
switching from the default thumbnail view to List view, which lists each item but
doesn’t show a thumbnail image.
If you want to play a clip in the thumbnail monitor in the Project window, click the
clip, then click the tiny right arrow next to the thumbnail monitor. If you want to pre-
serve space and hide the Project window’s thumbnail monitor, choose View➪Preview
Area in the Project window menu. This toggles the monitor display off and on. 
You can change the speed and duration of a clip by right-clicking the clip in the
Project window and choosing Speed/Duration. You can also quickly place the clip
in the Monitor Source window by right-clicking the clip and choosing Open in
Source window.
The Timeline window
The Timeline, shown in Figure 2-2, is the foundation of your video production. It
provides a graphic and temporal overview of your entire project. Fortunately, the
Timeline is not for viewing only — it’s interactive. Using your mouse, you can build
your production by dragging video and audio clips, graphics, and titles from the
Project window to the Timeline. Using Timeline tools, you can arrange, cut, and
extend clips. By clicking and dragging the work area Markers at either end of the
work area bar — edges of the light gray bar at the top of the Timeline — you specify
the portion of the Timeline that Premiere Pro previews or exports. The thin, colored
bar beneath the work area bar indicates whether a preview file for the project exists.
A red bar indicates no preview, and a green bar indicates that a video preview has
been created. If an audio preview exists, a thinner, light green bar appears. (To cre-
ate the Preview file, choose Sequence ➪Render Work Area, or press Enter to render
the work area.)
Rendering the work area helps ensure that your project is played back at the pro-
ject frame rate. Also, if you create video and audio effects, the Preview file stores
the rendered effects. Thus, the next time you play back the effect, Premiere Pro
does not have to process the effect again. 
In Figure 2-2, the first video clip in Video 1 track is from Digital Vision’s CityMix CD
(567005f.mov). It is found in the Chapter 28 folder (which is in the Tutorial Projects
folder) on the DVD that accompanies this book. The second clip is from Digital
Vision’s MightMoves CD (705008f.mov). This clip is in the Chapter 1 folder. The
sound clip is Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD (705001.aif). This clip is also in
Chapter 1.

Chapter 2 ✦Premiere Pro Basics
Figure 2-2: The Timeline window provides an overview of your project and enables 
you to edit clips.
Undoubtedly, the most useful visual metaphor in the Timeline window is its represen-
tation of video and audio tracks as parallel bars. Premiere Pro provides multiple, par-
allel tracks so that you can both preview and conceptualize a production in real time.
For instance, parallel video and audio tracks enable you to view video as audio plays.
The parallel tracks also enable you to create transparency effects where a portion of
one video track can be seen through another. The Timeline also includes icons for
hiding or viewing tracks. Clicking the Toggle Track Output button (Eye icon) hides a
track while you preview your production; clicking it again makes the track visible.
Clicking the audio Toggle Track Output button (Speaker icon) turns audio tracks on
and off. Beneath the Eye icon is another icon that sets the display mode for clips in
the track. Clicking the Set Display icon allows you to choose whether you want to see
frames from the actual clip in the Timeline or only the name of the clip. At the bottom
left of the window, the Time Zoom Level slider enables you to change the Timeline’s
time intervals. For example, zooming out shows your project over less Timeline
space, and zooming in shows your work over a greater area of the Timeline. Thus, 
if you are viewing frames in the Timeline, zooming in reveals more frames. You can
also zoom in and out by clicking the edges of gray bar at the top of the Timeline.
The other buttons — Track Options dialog box, Toggle Snap to Edges, Toggle Edge
Viewing, Toggle Shift Tracks Options, and Toggle Sync Mode — at the bottom left of
the window enable you to change options for syncing tracks and for making edges
snap together. These options are discussed in detail in Chapters 6 and 7.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
The Monitor window
The Monitor window, shown in Figure 2-3, is primarily used to preview your produc-
tion as you create it. When previewing your work, click the Play button to play the
clips in the Timeline and click the Loop button to start from frame 1. As you work,
you can also click and drag in the tread area (serrated lines just below the clip) to
jog, or slowly scroll, through your footage. Below the tread area is a triangular icon
called the shuttle slider. You can click and drag the shuttle slider to jump to a specific
clip area. As you click, the time readout in the Monitor window indicates your posi-
tion in the clip. The Monitor window can also be used to set the in and out points of
clips. As discussed in Chapter 1, the in and out points determine which part of a clip
appears in your project.

Chapter 2 ✦Premiere Pro Basics
In Figure 2-3, the first video clip in the Monitor window is from Digital Vision’s
NightMoves CD (705009f.mov). The second video clip in the Monitor window is
from Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD (705008f.mov). Both video clips are found in
the Nite Out folder in the Chapter 1 folder (which is in the Tutorial Projects folder)
that is on the DVD that accompanies this book.
The Monitor window provides three viewing modes. To switch the mode, 
choose Dual View, Single View, or Trim View in the Monitor Window menu. (You 
can also open Trim View by clicking the Trim icon at the bottom of the Monitor 
window.)
✦Dual View. The Monitor window is set up similarly to a traditional videotape-
editing studio. The source clip (footage) appears on one side of the Monitor
window, and the program (edited video) appears on the other side of the win-
dow. This mode is primarily used when creating three- and four-point edits,
which we cover in Chapter 13.
✦Single View. The window displays one monitor as you preview your production.
Using this mode is similar to viewing your production on a television monitor.
✦Trim View. This mode allows for precision editing. One clip appears in one
Monitor window, and the other clip appears in the second Monitor window.
Precision editing of clips is covered in Chapter 13.
All the Monitor window modes provide icons (refer to Figure 2-3) that enable you 
to quickly set in and out edit points as well as step through the video frames.
The Audio Mixer window
The Audio Mixer window, shown in Figure 2-4, enables you to mix different audio
tracks, and to create cross fades and pans. (Panning enables you to balance stereo
channels or shift sound from the left to the right stereo channels, and vice versa).
Users of earlier versions of Premiere Pro can appreciate the Audio Mixer’s capabil-
ity to work in real time, which means that you can mix audio tracks while viewing
video tracks.
Using the palette controls, you can raise and lower audio levels for three tracks by
clicking and dragging the volume fader controls with the mouse. You can also set lev-
els in decibels by typing a number into the dB level indicator field (at the bottom of
the Volume fader area). The round knob-like controls enable you to pan or balance
audio. You can change the settings by clicking and dragging the knob icon. The but-
tons at the top of the Audio Mixer let you play all tracks, pick the tracks that you
want to hear, or pick the tracks that you want to mute.

Figure 2-4: Use the Audio Mixer to mix audio and create 
audio effects.
The familiar controls at the bottom of the Audio Mixer window enable you to start
and stop recording changes while the audio runs. Chapter 9 provides an in-depth
discussion of how to use the Audio Mixer.
The Effects window
The Effects window allows you to quickly apply audio and video effects and transi-
tions. The Effects window provides a grab bag of useful effects and transitions. For
example, the Video Effects folder includes effects that change an image’s contrast
and distort and blur images. As you can see from Figure 2-5, the effects are organized
into folders. For instance, among the many folders in the Effects window is the
Distort folder, which features effects that distort clips by bending or pinching them.
Applying an effect is simple — just click and drag the effect from its palette to a clip
in the Timeline. Typically, doing this opens a dialog box in which you specify options
for the effect.

Chapter 2 ✦Premiere Pro Basics
The Effect window allows you to create your own folders and move effects into
them so that you can quickly access the effects you want to use in each project.
Premiere Pro’s Transitions folder, which also appears in the Effects window, features
more than 70 transitional effects. Some effects, such as the Dissolve group, can pro-
vide a smooth transition from one video clip to another. Other transitions, such as
page peel, can be used as a special effect to dramatically jump from one scene to
another.
Figure 2-5: Use the Effect windows to apply 
transitions and special effects.

Tip

36
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
If you’ll be using the same transitions throughout a production, you can create a
folder, name it, and keep the transitions in the custom folder for quick access.
See Chapter 10 for more information on creating transitions; see Chapter 14 for
more information on using video effects.
The Effect Controls window
The Effect Controls window, shown in Figure 2-6, allows you to quickly create and
control audio and video effects and transitions. For instance, you can add an effect
to a clip by selecting it in the Effect window and then dragging the effect over the
clip in the Timeline or directly into the Effect Controls palette. As you can see from
Figure 2-6, the Effect Controls palette includes its own version of the Timeline as
well as a slider control for zooming into the Timeline. By clicking and dragging the
Timeline and changing effect settings, you can change effects over time. As you
change settings, you create keyframes (indicated by diamond icons) along the
Timeline. 
If you create effects for a clip, you can see the different effects by selecting the clip
and opening the Effect Controls window.
Figure 2-6: The Effect Controls palette enables you to quickly 
display and edit video and audio effects.

Chapter 2 ✦Premiere Pro Basics
Premiere Pro’s Floating Palettes
Premiere Pro’s Tools, History, Info, and Effect Control palettes function differently
than Premiere Pro’s other windows. Palettes are actually floating windows that
never drop below other windows, which makes them readily accessible. In addition,
the tabbed format of these windows enables you to keep them in groups that can
be split apart and added to.
To activate any palette, just click it. To separate it from its group, click the palette
tab and then drag it away from its palette group. To add one palette to another
palette group, click the palette’s tab and drag it to another group.
The following sections describe each of the palette windows.
The Tools palette
The tools in Premiere Pro’s Tools palette, shown in Figure 2-7, are primarily used to
edit clips in the Timeline. Each tool is activated by clicking it in the toolbox. Here’s
a brief summary of the tools:
✦The Selection tool is often used for selecting and moving clips on the
Timeline.
✦The Track Select tool selects all items on a track.
✦The Ripple Edit, Rolling Edit, Slip, and Slide tools, covered in Chapter 13, are
used to adjust edits on the Timeline. The Razor tool allows you to cut a clip
simply by clicking on it.
✦The Rate Stretch tool allows you to change the speed of clip by clicking and
dragging a clip edge with the tool.
✦The Pen tool allows you to create keyframes on the Timeline when adjusting
video and audio effects. Audio effects are covered in Chapter 8. Video effects

The History palette
Premiere Pro’s History palette, shown in Figure 2-8, lets you perform virtually unlim-
ited Undo operations. As you work, the History palette records your production
steps. To return to a previous version of your project, just click that history state in
the History palette. After you click and begin working again, you rewrite history —
all past steps following the state you returned to are removed from the palette as
new ones appear. If you want to clear all history from the palette, choose Clear in
the History palette’s menu (launched by clicking the right triangle). To delete a his-
tory state, select it and then click the Delete button (trashcan icon) in the palette.
If you click a history state in the History palette to undo an action and then begin
to work, all steps after the one you clicked are removed from your project.
The Info palette
The Info palette provides important information about clips and transitions, and
even about gaps in the Timeline. To see the Info palette in action, click a clip, transi-
tion, or empty gap in the Timeline. The Info palette shows the clip’s (or gap’s) size,
duration, and starting and ending points, as shown in Figure 2-9.

The Menus
Premiere Pro features seven main menus: File, Edit, Project, Clip, Timeline, Window,
and Help. The following sections provide an overview of the different menus and
include tables that summarize each menu’s commands.
The File menu
The File menu consists of standard Windows commands such as New, Open, Close,
Save, Save As, Revert, and Quit. The menu includes commands for loading movie
clips and folders full of files. The File New Sequence command can be used to add
Timelines to a project. Table 2-1 summarizes the File menu commands.

Customizing
Premiere Pro
O
nce you become familiar with Premiere Pro, you’re 
certain to appreciate its many time-saving features.
Nevertheless, as you edit and fine-tune your work, you’ll
undoubtedly want to save as much time as possible.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro provides numerous utilities for 
keyboard and program customization. This chapter takes a
look at how you can create your own keyboard shortcuts to
customize Premiere Pro to respond to your every touch. The
chapter also provides an overview of Premiere Pro’s default
settings, which you can customize to your own specifications.
Creating Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can help take the drudgery out of repeti-
tive tasks and speed up your production work. Fortunately,
Premiere Pro provides keyboard shortcuts for activating its
tools, opening all its windows, and accessing most of its menu
commands. As you’ll soon see, these commands are preset
but can easily be altered. If a keyboard command does not
exist for a Premiere Pro operation, you can create your own.
To change keyboard shortcuts, open the Keyboard Custom-
ization dialog box by choosing Edit ➪Keyboard Customization.
The Keyboard Customization dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1,
is divided into three sections: Application, Windows, and Tools.
Changing Application 
keyboard preferences
To change Application keyboard commands, choose Appli-
cation in the Set drop-down menu. To change or create a key-
board setting, click the triangle to open up the menu heading

that contains the command. For instance, assume that you want to create a keyboard
shortcut to use for the Revert command, which allows you to immediately return 
to the previously saved version of your work. First, click the triangle icon to open 
the File menu commands. To create the command, next click in the Shortcut col-
umn in the Revert line. When the Revert command line is activated, dotted lines
appear around it, as shown in Figure 3-2. To create the keyboard command, simply
press a function key or a modifier key combination, such as Ctrl+R, Ctrl+Shift+R, or
Alt+Shift+R. If you make a mistake or want to cancel the command, simply click Clear.
Changing Premiere Pro Windows 
keyboard preferences
Premiere Pro’s keyboard customization of its Window commands is quite extensive.
To access Premiere Pro’s Windows Keyboard commands, choose Windows from 
the drop-down menu in the Keyboard Customization dialog box. The keyboard 
commands found here provide shortcuts for many commands that would normally
require one click or clicking and dragging the mouse. Thus, even if you are not going
to create or change the existing keyboard commands, it’s worth examining the
Windows Keyboard commands to see the many timesaving shortcuts Premiere Pro
offers. For instance, Figure 3-3 shows the keyboard shortcuts for Timeline operations.
Notice that you can use a few simple keystrokes to nudge a clip left or right one or
five frames. If you want to change a keyboard command, follow the same procedures
described in the preceding section: Click in the shortcut column of the command line
and press the command keys you want to use for the shortcut.
Figure 3-1: The Keyboard Customization dialog box 
allows you to customize keyboard commands.

Changing Tools keyboard preferences
Premiere Pro provides keyboard shortcuts for each of its tools. To access the Tools
keyboard shortcuts, shown in Figure 3-4, choose Tools from the drop-down menu in
the Keyboard Customization dialog box. To change a keyboard command in the Tools
section of the dialog box, simply click in the shortcut column in a tool’s row and
enter your keystroke shortcut on the keyboard.

52
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro

Saving and loading custom commands
As you change keyboard commands, Premiere Pro automatically adds a new Custom
set to the Set menu. This prevents you from overwriting Premiere Pro’s factory
default settings. If you want to provide a name for the Custom set or create multiple
custom sets, click Save As in the Keyboard Customization window. This opens the
Name Key Set dialog box, shown in Figure 3-5, where you can enter a name. After
you save the name, it appears in the Set drop-down list, along with Adobe’s factory
default settings. If you want to delete the custom set, select it from the drop-down
list and click Delete.
Figure 3-5: Name a custom setting in the
Name Key Set dialog box.
Setting Program Preferences
Premiere Pro’s Program preferences control a variety of default settings that load
each time you open a project. You can change these preference settings in the cur-
rent project, but the changes aren’t activated until you create or open a new one.
You can change the defaults for capture devices and the duration of transitions and
still images, as well as the label colors in the Project menus. This section provides
an overview of the many default settings Premiere Pro offers. You access each of

53
Chapter 3 ✦Customizing Premiere Pro
the settings by choosing Edit ➪Preferences and then picking a choice from the
Preferences submenu. Here is a review of the different sections of Premiere 
Pro’s Preferences dialog box.
General
The General preferences, shown in Figure 3-6, provide settings for a variety of
Premiere Pro default preferences. The commands control a few interface and clip
settings:
✦Show Tool Tips. Turns on Premiere Pro’s “hover help,” which displays the
names of tools and buttons when you move the mouse over them.
✦In/out points, show media offset. These settings allow you to change the
video and audio that appear before and after in and out points. Set the time in
seconds in the Preroll field for video and audio you want to appear before in
points. Set the time in seconds in the Postroll field for video and audio that
you want to appear after the out point.
✦Video Transition Default Duration. Controls the duration of transitions when
you first apply them. By default, this field is set to 30 frames — approximately
1 second.
✦Audio Transition Default Duration. Controls the duration of audio transitions
when you first apply them. The default setting is 1 second.
✦User Interface Brightness. Controls the brightness of Premiere Pro’s windows.
Click and drag the slider to the left to create a lighter gray background; click
and drag to the right to darken window backgrounds.
Figure 3-6: The General section in the Preferences 
dialog box.

54
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Audio
Premiere Pro’s Audio preferences, shown in Figure 3-7, control settings for Premiere
Pro’s Audio mixer:
✦Automatch Time. This setting is used in conjunction with the Touch options
in the Audio Mixer. When you choose the Touch option in the Audio Mixer win-
dow, Premiere Pro returns to the previous values used before changes were
made — but only after a specific number of seconds. The Automatch setting
controls the time interval before Premiere Pro returns to the previous values
before audio changes were made.
✦5.1 Mixdown Type. These settings control 5.1 surround-sound track mixes. 
A 5.1 track is composed of these essential channels: left, center, and right
channels (the first three of five main channels), with left- and right-rear chan-
nels (two more channels make five), plus a low frequency channel (LFE). The
5.1 Mixdown Type drop-down menu allows you change settings for the chan-
nels used when mixing, which reduces the number of audio channels.
For more information about using the Audio Mixer, see Chapter 9.
Audio Hardware
The Audio Hardware preferences, shown in Figure 3-8, provide details and options
about installed audio hardware. The figure shows two audio channels providing both
stereo and 5.1 surround sound. The Audio Hardware section also includes settings
for Audio Stream Input/Output cards (ASIO). In the Audio Hardware section, the
Latency option controls the size of a memory cache when available audio is pro-
cessed. Adobe recommends short latency settings for precise work and long
latency for special effects processing.
If you click ASIO Settings, the choices that appear are based on the specific hardware
installed in your computer.
Auto Save
If you’re worried about forgetting to save your projects as you work, don’t worry
too much. By default, Premiere Pro’s Auto Save preference is turned on. When this
option is turned on, Premiere Pro saves your project every 20 minutes and creates
five different versions of your work. In the Auto Save section, shown in Figure 3-9,
you can change the time interval for saving. You can also change the number of dif-
ferent versions that you would like to save. When you enlist Auto Save, Premiere
Pro saves your work along this path: MyDocuments/Adobe/Adobe Premiere Pro/1.0
Adobe Premier Pro Auto Save.

Figure 3-9: Using Premiere Pro’s Auto Save preferences, 
you can have multiple versions of your work saved

Capture
Premiere Pro’s default Capture settings provide options for Video and Audio cap-
ture. The Capture preferences are self-explanatory. You can choose to abort the
capture when frames are dropped. You can choose to view a report onscreen about
the capture process and dropped frames. The Generate batch log file option saves a
log file to disk, listing the results of an unsuccessful batch capture.
Device Control
The Device Control preferences, shown in Figure 3-10, let you choose a current cap-
ture device such as a camcorder or VCR. The Preroll setting allows you to set the
interval between the times the tape rolls and capture begins. This lets the cam-
corder or VCR get up to speed before capture. The Timecode Offset option allows
you to specify an interval in quarter-frames that provides an offset between the
timecode of the captured material and the actual tape. This option allows you to
attempt to set the timecode of the captured video so that it matches frames on the
videotape.
Clicking the Options button in the dialog box opens the DV Device Control options
dialog box where you can choose the brand of your capture device, set the time-
code format, and check to see whether the device is online or offline.

57
Chapter 3 ✦Customizing Premiere Pro
For more information about capturing video and the DV Device Control Options
dialog box, see Chapter 5.
Label Colors and Label Defaults
The Label Colors default setting allows you to change colors of the labels that
appear in the Project window. As discussed in Chapter 2, you can assign specific
colors to different media types in the Project window. To change colors, click the
colored label swatch. This opens Premiere Pro’s Color Settings dialog box. Here you
can change colors by clicking and dragging the vertical slider and by clicking in the
rectangular colored box. You can also change colors by entering numbers into the
numeric fields. After you change colors, you can edit the color names in the Label
Colors section of the Preferences dialog box.
If you don’t like the choices Adobe made when assigning label colors to different
media types, you can change color assignments in the Label Defaults section. For
instance, to change the Label color of video to red, click the pop-up menu in the
Video line and choose Red.
Scratch Disks
The Scratch Disks section allows you to set the default disks for Captured Video,
Captured Audio, Video Previews, Audio Preview, and Conformed Audio. To set a
specific disk and folder, click the Browse button and navigate to the folder on the
storage device that you want to use.

Still Images, Titler, and Trim
The Still Images, Titler, and Trim preferences provide a variety of default settings
for still images and clips. The Still Images setting allows you to set the duration of
still images that you insert into a production.
The Titler preferences control the display of the style swatches and fonts browser
that appear in the Adobe Title Designer (choose File ➪New ➪Title to open the Title
Designer).
The Trim preferences allow you to change the Large trim offset that appears in the
Monitor window when the Monitor window is in Trim view. By default, the Large
Trim offset is set to 5 frames. When you click the Trim offset button, five frames 
are trimmed from the program’s in or out point. If you change the value in the 
Large Trim offset field in the Trim section, the next time you create a project, that
value appears as a button in the Monitor window.
See Chapter 13 for a discussion on how to edit in Trim view in the Monitor window.
Summary
Premiere Pro provides many options for customizing its commands and features:
✦Use the Edit ➪Keyboard Customization command to customize keyboard 
commands for the tools and other windows.
✦To edit default settings in Premiere Pro, choose Edit ➪Preferences.

Working with
Project Settings
W
hen you first begin creating projects in Premiere Pro,
the desktop video terminology and vast number of
settings for video, compression, capturing, and exporting can
seem overwhelming. If you’re just getting started with Premiere
Pro and are primarily interested in learning the basics of the
program, you needn’t worry too much about understanding
all the commands in all the program’s project-setting dialog
boxes. However, if you don’t understand such terms as frame
rates, frame size, and compression — terms used in Premiere
Pro’s project-setting dialog boxes — you’re likely to be frus-
trated when you attempt to output your production.
This chapter provides an overview of key desktop video con-
cepts. It also provides a guide to the different dialog boxes in
which you designate the startup settings for Premiere Pro 
projects. For the most part, these are settings that Premiere
Pro uses while you are importing and editing in Premiere Pro.
Settings for capturing video are covered in Chapter 5. Project
settings for exporting video are covered later in Part V of 
this book.
What Is Digital Video?
In the past few years, the term digital video has taken on a vari-
ety of new meanings. To the consumer, digital video may simply
mean shooting video with the latest video camera from Canon,
Sony, or JVC. A digital video camera is named as such because
the picture information is stored as a digital signal. The camera
translates the picture data into digital signals and saves it on
tape in much the same way that your computer saves data to
a hard drive.
Older video-recording systems store information in an analog
format on tape. In analog format, information is sent in waves
rather than as specific individual bits of data.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
In Premiere Pro, a digital video project usually contains video, still images, and audio
that has been digitized, or converted from analog to digital format. Video and audio
information stored in digital format from digital video cameras can be transferred
directly to a computer through an IEEE 1394 port. (Although Apple Computer’s trade
name for the IEEE port is FireWire and Sony’s is i.LINK, the specifications are identi-
cal.) Because the data is already digitized, the IEEE 1394 port provides a fast means
of transferring the data. Using video footage shot on an analog video camera or
recorded on an analog video deck, however, requires the additional step of first dig-
itizing the footage. Analog-to-digital capture boards that can be installed in PCs gen-
erally handle this process. These boards digitize both audio and video. Other types
of visual media, such as photographs and slides, also need to be converted to a dig-
ital format before Premiere Pro can use them. Scanners digitize slides and still pho-
tos, but you can also digitize slides and photos by photographing them with a digital
still camera. Scanning an analog image saves the image to the computer’s hard drive,
where it can then be loaded directly into Premiere Pro. After the project has been
fine-tuned, the last step of the digital video production process is to output it to your
hard drive, a DVD, or to videotape.
The abbreviation DV refers to the digital video format used in consumer and “pro-
sumer” camcorders. D1 is a digital format used by many professionals in the
broadcasting industry. Both DV and D1 formats utilize specific frame sizes and
frame rates, which are discussed in the section “Digital video essentials” later in
this chapter.
Digital video provides numerous advantages over traditional analog video. If you
use a digital video camera, your video clips are generally superior to analog clips.
In digital video, you can freely duplicate video and audio without losing quality.
With analog video, on the other hand, you “go down a generation” each time you
copy a clip on videotape, thus losing a little quality.
In the context of Premiere Pro, one advantage of digital video is that it enables you
to edit video in a nonlinear fashion. Traditional video editing requires the editor to
assemble a videotape production piece by piece from start to finish in a linear man-
ner. In linear editing, each video clip is recorded after the previous clip onto a pro-
gram reel. One problem with a linear system is the time it takes to re-edit a segment
or to insert a segment that is not the same duration as the original segment to be
replaced. If you need to re-edit a clip in the middle of a production, the entire pro-
gram needs to be reassembled. The process is similar to creating a necklace with a
string of beads. If you want to add beads to the middle of the necklace, you need to
pull out all the beads, insert the new ones, and put the old beads back in the neck-
lace, all the while being careful to keep everything in the same order.
In a nonlinear video system, you can freely insert, remove, and rearrange footage. 
If you reconsider the bead necklace analogy, nonlinear editing enables you to magi-
cally pop the beads on the necklace wherever you want, as if the string didn’t exist.
Because the image is made up of digital pixels that can be transformed and replaced,
digital video enables you to create numerous transitions and effects that are not

possible on a purely analog system. To return to the necklace analogy, a digital sys-
tem lets you not only insert and replace beads freely, but also change their color
and shape at will.
Digital video essentials
Before you begin creating a digital video project, it’s important to understand some
basic terminology. Terms such as frame rate, compression, and frame size abundantly
populate Premiere Pro’s dialog boxes. Understanding these terms helps you make
the right decisions as you create new projects and export them to videotape, to your
hard drive, or to DVD.
Video frame rates
If you take a strip of motion picture film in your hand and hold it up to the light, you’ll
see the individual picture frames that comprise the production. If you look closely,
you’ll see how motion is created: Each frame of a moving image is slightly different
than the previous frame. A change in the visual information in each frame creates
the illusion of motion.
If you hold up a piece of videotape to light, you won’t see any frames. However, the
video camera does electronically store the picture data into individual video frames.
The standard DV NTSC (North American and Japanese standard) frame rate in video
is 29.97 frames per second; in Europe, the standard frame rate is 25 frames per sec-
ond. Europe uses the PAL system (Phase Alternate Line). The standard frame rate
of film is 24 frames per second.
Frame rate is extremely important in Premiere Pro because it helps determine how
smooth the motion will be in your project. Typically, you set the frame rate of your
project to match your video footage. For example, if you capture video directly into
Premiere Pro using DV equipment, the capture rate is set to 29.97 frames per second,
which matches Premiere Pro’s DV project setting frame rate. If you need to import
footage captured at different frame rates, you can use Premiere Pro’s Interpret
Footage command to change the frame rate of clips to match that of your project.
Although you will want the project frame rate to be the same rate as the source
footage, you may want to export at a lower frame rate if you are preparing the pro-
ject for the Web. By exporting at a lower frame rate, you enable the production to
quickly download to a Web browser.
Frame size and square and non-square pixels
The frame size of a digital video production determines the width and height of your
production onscreen. In Premiere Pro, frame size is measured in pixels. A pixel is
the smallest picture element displayed on a computer monitor. The standard shape
of a computer pixel is square. If you are working on a project that uses DV (Digital
Video) footage, you’ll typically be using the DV standard of 720 x 480 pixels. The
standard frame size for D1 is 720 x 486. If you’re not creating a DV or D1 project, 
you should still set the frame size of your project to match the frame size of your

62
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
footage. For instance, if your footage was shot at 640 x 480, you’ll typically use these
frame dimensions as the frame dimensions of your project. If you’re outputting to
the Web or to a multimedia project, you can change frame size when exporting your
project to your hard disk.
Before the advent of DV, the frame size used in most computer video systems was
640 x 480 pixels. This conformed nicely to the aspect ratio (width to height) of tele-
vision, which is 4:3 (640/160=4 and 480/160=3). Thus, for every four square horizon-
tal pixels, there are three square vertical pixels. 
But when you’re working with a frame size of 720 x 480 or 720 x 486, the math isn’t
so clean. The problem: If you create a 720 x 486 image in a program that uses square
pixels, the aspect ratio is 3:2, not the television standard of 4:3. How do you squeeze
720 x 480 pixels into a 4:3 ratio? The answer is to use rectangular pixels, essentially
non-square pixels that are taller than they are wide.
Understanding pixel aspect ratio
If the concept of square versus non-square pixels seems a bit confusing, remember
that 640 x 480 provides a 4:3 aspect ratio. One way of viewing the problem presented
by a 720 x 480 frame size is to ask how you can convert the width of 720 down to
640. Try a little high school math: 720 times what number equals 640? The answer is
.90 — 640 is 90% of 720. Thus, if each square pixel would be kind enough to shave its
width to 9⁄10 of its former self, you could translate 720 x 480 into a 4:3 aspect ratio. If
you’re working with DV, you’ll frequently see the number 0.9. When you create a DV
project in Premiere Pro, you’ll see that the DV pixel aspect ratio is set to 0.9 (short
for 0.9:1) instead of 1 (for square pixels). Furthermore, if you import footage with a
frame size of 720 x 480 into Premiere Pro, the pixel aspect ratio is automatically set
to 0.9. In PAL DV systems (720 x 576), the pixels are horizontally longer than they
are wide, and the pixel aspect ratio is 1.067. 
You can calculate the pixel aspect ratio for an image by using this formula: frame
height/frame width x aspect ratio width/aspect ratio height. Thus, for a 4:3 aspect
ratio, 480/640 * 4/3=1 and 720/480 x 4/3=.9. For PAL systems, the calculation
would be 576/720 x 4/3=1.067.
Fortunately, when you create a DV project in Premiere Pro, the pixel aspect ratio is
chosen automatically. Premier also adjusts the computer display so that images
created from non-square pixel footages are not distorted when viewed on your
square pixel computer display. Nonetheless, it’s important to understand the con-
cept of square versus non-square pixels because you may find it necessary to work
in a project with source material created from both square and non-square pixels.
For instance, if you import footage created with an analog video board (which digi-
tizes using square pixels) and images created in Photoshop (square pixels) into a DV
project with DV footage, you’ll have two flavors of pixels in your video stew. To pre-
vent distortion, you may need to use Premiere Pro’s Interpret Footage command and
properly set frame sizes of graphics created in Photoshop and Illustrator. (For more
information, see the sidebar “Preventing display distortion” later in this chapter.)
Tip

Chapter 4 ✦Working with Project Settings
RGB color and bit depth
A color image on the computer screen is created from the combination of red, green,
and blue color phosphors. The combination of different amounts of red, green, and
blue light enables you to display millions of different colors. In digital imaging pro-
grams, such as Premiere Pro and Photoshop, the red, green, and blue color compo-
nents are often called channels. Each channel can provide 256 colors (28 — often
referred to as 8-bit color because 8 bits are in a byte), and the combination of 256
red colors × 256 green colors × 256 blue colors results in over 17.6 million colors.
Thus, when creating projects in Premiere Pro, you’ll see most color depth options
set to millions of colors. A color depth of millions of colors is often called 24-bit
color (224).
Although television uses a monitor very much like a computer display to provide
color, it does not use RGB color. Instead, television uses a color system called YCC.
The Y stands for luminance, which essentially controls brightness levels for grayscale
or black-and-white images. Both C channels are color channels. YCC was created
when television was transitioning between black-and-white and color systems to
enable those with black-and-white systems as well as those with color systems 
to view the TV signal.
Compression
Larger frame sizes provide greater bit depth, and more frames per second produce
a better quality Premiere Pro digital video project. Unfortunately, a full-frame, 24-bit
color, 30 frames per second video production requires vast amounts of storage space.
You can easily calculate how much hard drive space a full-frame production would
take up. Start by multiplying the frame dimensions. Assume that you are creating a
project at 720 × 480 pixels. Each pixel needs to be capable of displaying red, green,
and blue elements of color, so multiply 720 × 480 × 3. Each frame is more than 1MB.
Thus, one second of video at 30 frames a second more than 30MB. (This doesn’t even
include sound.) A five-minute uncompressed production consumes more than 8GB
of storage space.
To store more data in less space with a minimum loss of quality, software engineers
have created a variety of video compression schemes. The two primary compression
schemes are spatial and temporal:
✦Spatial compression (also known as intra-frame). In spatial compression,
computer software analyzes the pixels in an image and then saves a pattern
that simulates the entire image. DV camcorders primarily use intra-frame 
compression.
✦Temporal compression. Temporal compression works by analyzing the pixels
in video frames for screen areas that don’t change. Without temporal compres-
sion, different frames are saved to disk for each second of video, whether the
image onscreen changes or not. Rather than creating many frames with the
Note

64
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
same image, temporal compression works by creating one keyframe for image
areas that don’t change. The system calculates the differences between frames
to create the compression. For example, for a video that consists of frames of
a flower that sometimes blows in the wind, the computer needs to store only
one frame for the flower and record more frames only when the flower moves.
When you work with compression in Premiere Pro, you don’t choose spatial or 
temporal compression. Instead, depending upon your project settings, you choose
compression settings by specifying a CODEC. CODEC stands for compression and
decompression. Software manufacturers create codecs. For example, when exporting
from Premiere Pro, you can use a CODEC called Cinepak, which provides temporal
compression. When you export your project, you can specify how many keyframes
you want to output per second.
A DV camera compresses the video even before it is transferred to your computer.
The standard compression ratio used is 5:1, which makes the transferred video
signal five times smaller than the original video signal. The DV video data rate is 25
Mbytes a second, which means that every second of video consumes approxi-
mately 3.5MB of disk space. DV camcorders primarily use intra-frame. For a very
technical discussion on how a DV camera compresses video, see the Video Signal
Processing section of the DVCAM1 Overview brochure at www.sony.ca/dvcam.
Click the Reference menu and choose brochures.
QuickTime, Video for Windows, and MPEG
In order for your computer to use a video compression system, software and some-
times hardware must be installed. Both Macs and PCs usually come with video 
compression software built into their operating systems. QuickTime is the digital
video compression system automatically installed with the Macintosh operating
system; Video for Windows is the digital video compression system automatically
installed in the Windows operating system. QuickTime can also be installed on 
PCs. Because QuickTime is cross-platform, it is one of the most popular digital
video systems for CD-ROM and Web digital video. When you export a movie from
Premiere Pro, you can access the QuickTime or AVI compression settings, enabling
you to choose from a list of QuickTime or AVI codecs. If you have a capture board
installed in your computer, the capture board typically provides a set of codecs
from which to choose.
It’s also important to understand that the QuickTime and AVI video clips can be
edited in Premiere Pro and integrated into a Premiere Pro project. Other compression
systems, such as MPEG (named after the Motion Picture Engineering Group, which
oversees the creation of different MPEG file formats), require Premiere Pro to do too
much processing to maintain high quality and compressed video — without added
hardware. Although you can import an MPEG file into Premiere Pro, the program is
not designed to render video in this format without a video board that handles MPEG.
The best indicator of this limitation is the fact that no MPEG listings appear in the
New Project dialog box when you create a project (see Figure 4-1 in the upcoming
section “Understanding Project Settings”).
Note

65
Chapter 4 ✦Working with Project Settings
Although Premiere Pro provides no MPEG project settings, it enables you to output
in MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 format. Outputting in MPEG formats is covered in Chapter 19.
MPEG-2 compression is used to create DVDs, which can provide up to two hours of
video with eight tracks of audio. MPEG-1 compression, which can be used on the Web
or on CD-ROMs, provides VHS-quality video. The newest MPEG standard, MPEG-4
(available in QuickTime 6), provides even better compression than MPEG-2. Because
MPEG-4 is an international standard, it will undoubtedly be one of the chief file for-
mats used to deliver audio and video over the Web.
Digital format overview
If you haven’t dealt extensively with the concepts of video formats, frame sizes and
aspect ratios, you might find it helpful to see these formats organized in tabular for-
mat. Table 4-1 provides an overview of DV formats for NTSC and PAL. As you work
in Premiere Pro, you’ll find that the items listed in this table are in project settings
and export settings dialog boxes.

Understanding Project Settings
After you gain a basic understanding of frame rate, frame size, and compression, you
can better choose settings when you create a project in Premiere Pro. If you choose
your project settings carefully, you’ll produce the best quality video. Figure 4-1
shows Premiere Pro’s New Project dialog box, which appears when you create a
new project in Premiere Pro.
The New Project dialog box appears when you click New Project after starting
Premiere Pro or when you choose File ➪New Project. The creators of Premiere Pro
have streamlined the process of choosing project settings. To get started, you sim-
ply need to click one of the available presets. Notice that Premiere Pro provides DV
(Digital Video format) presets for NTSC television and the PAL standards. Premiere
Pro also provides non-DV presets for NTSC, PAL, and other projects based on
square pixel footage.

66
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
How do you decide which preset to choose? If you are working on a DV project and
your video is not going to be in a widescreen format (16:9 aspect ratio), you could
choose the Standard 32 Khz option. The 32 Khz indicates the sound quality, which
should match the sound quality of your source footage. If your footage was digitized
using an analog to digital capture board, your footage undoubtedly uses square
pixels. If this is the case, use one of the Non-DV presets. If your source footage is com-
posed of graphics created in a computer animation program or a computer applica-
tion such as Photoshop (which uses square pixels), you should also choose one 
of the non-DV presets. When choosing a non-DV preset, choose a preset that matches
the frame size of your footage. If you have a third-party video capture board, you may
see other presets specifically created to work with your capture board.
Clicking one of the presets displays the preselected settings for Compression, Frame
Size, Pixel Aspect Ratio (discussed later in this chapter), Frame Rate, and Bit Depth,
as well as for audio settings. If you are working with DV footage, you probably will not
need to change the default settings. If you need to alter the presets, click the Custom
Settings tab. This opens up the General section of the New Project dialog box.
If you create a custom preset in the Custom Tab of the New Project dialog box, you
can save it for use in other projects by clicking Save Preset. Saved presets can be
loaded from a folder called Custom that appears in the Load Preset tab in the New
Project dialog box. 
When you export a movie, a Settings button also lets you change settings.
Figure 4-1: The New Project dialog box includes project presets.

Chapter 4 ✦Working with Project Settings
Preventing display distortion
When non-square pixels that haven’t been altered are viewed on a computer monitor
(which displays square pixels), images may appear distorted. The distortion does not
appear when the footage is viewed on a video monitor instead of on a computer display.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro adjusts non-square pixel footage on a computer display and,
thus, does not distort non-square footage when imported into a DV project. However, if you
create a graphic at 720 × 480 (or 720 × 486) in a square pixel program such as Photoshop 7
and then import it into an NTSC DV project, the graphic may appear distorted in Premiere
Pro. The graphic is distorted because Premiere Pro automatically converts it to a non-
square 0.9 pixel aspect ratio. If you create a graphic at 720 × 576 in a square pixel program
and import it into a PAL DV project, Premiere Pro also converts it to a non-square pixel
aspect ratio. Distortion can occur because Premiere Pro interprets any digital source file cre-
ated at a DV frame size as non-square pixel data. (This file import rule is specified in a text
file called “Interpretation Rules.txt.” The file is found in Premiere Pro’s Plug-in folder and can
be edited so that Premiere Pro interprets graphic and video files differently.)
Fortunately, if you are creating graphics in Photoshop CS, you’re in luck. Photoshop CS fea-
tures a 720 × 480 DV preset that sets the pixel aspect ratio in a file to 0.9. If you use this
preset, you should be able to import Photoshop files seamlessly into Premiere Pro DV pro-
jects without any distortion. However, If you are not using Photoshop CS, you should create
full-screen graphics for DV projects at 720 × 534 or 720 × 540 (768 × 576, PAL). After creat-
ing your graphics, import them into Premiere Pro with the General Project Settings option
“Scale clip to project dimensions when adding to sequence” selected. This will squeeze
graphics to fit into your DV project without distortion.
If you do create a graphic file at 720 × 480 in a square pixel program such as Photoshop 7
and import it into a Premiere Pro DV project, you may notice distortion because Premiere
Pro displays the file as thought it was created with non-square pixels. Fortunately, you can
“fix” the image in Premiere Pro using its Interpret Footage command. Note that, if you use this
technique, Premiere Pro must interpolate (adding about 10% more pixels to the image),
which might make it appear less sharp.
Here’s how to convert your graphics back to square pixels using Premiere Pro’s Interpret
Footage command:
1. Select the graphic image in the Project window. Note that the Project window
indicates that the pixel aspect ratio is not set to 1.0.
2. To change the Pixel Aspect ratio back to square pixels, choose File➪Interpret
Footage.
3. In the Pixel Aspect Ratio section of the Interpret Footage dialog box, click
Conform to. Then choose Square Pixels (1.0) in the pop-up menu. Click OK.
After you click OK, the listing in the Project window indicates that the image has
been converted to square pixels.

68
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Video and audio project settings are divided into four categories: General, 
Capture, Video Rendering, and Default Sequence. The sections that follow describe
the General, Video Rendering, and Default Sequences settings. All of these sections
of the New Project dialog box are accessible when you first create a project. If you
want to view project settings after creating a project, choose, Project ➪Project
Settings ➪General Settings. Note, however, that after you create a project, most set-
tings cannot be changed.
You can find out more about audio settings in Chapter 8 and capture settings 
in Chapter 5. See Chapter 19 for more information about exporting Premiere Pro
projects.
General settings
The General settings section of the New Project dialog box, shown in Figure 4-2,
provides a summary of the individual project settings.
Figure 4-2: The General settings section of the New Project dialog box.
You can access this dialog box by choosing File ➪New Project (or by clicking the New
Project button) and then clicking the Custom Settings tab. To access this dialog box
after creating a project, choose Project ➪Project Settings ➪General.
The following list describes the choices.
Cross-
Reference

69
Chapter 4 ✦Working with Project Settings
✦Editing mode. The editing mode is determined by the chosen preset in the
Load Preset tab of the New Project dialog box. The editing mode choice sets
the Timeline playback method as well as compression settings. When you
choose a DV preset, the Editing mode is automatically set to DV Playback. If
you are working with analog video that uses non-square pixels, you can change
the Editing mode to Video for Windows, which allows you to access frame size
options and which can be changed to match the footage you will be using.
If you are wording with a DV preset, you can click the Playback Settings button,
which opens the DV Playback Settings dialog box shown in Figure 4-3. There
you can select Playback on DV Hardware and Desktop. This option allows you
to view the playback on a monitor connected to a VCR or your DV camcorder.
If you will be exporting your project to videotape, outputting to a video moni-
tor or to your camcorder monitor (rather than to your computer display) will
provide the best preview of your project. The window also allows you to choose
where you prefer to have effects rendered. If you’re not outputting to video,
choose Desktop Only. The last choice allows you to choose where you want
the audio played if you are exporting to videotape.
Third party software plug-ins may also allow different playback options.
Figure 4-3: Use the DV Playback Settings dialog 
box to select playback options for DV camcorders 
and VCRs.
✦Timebase. Timebase determines how Premiere Pro divides video frames each
second when calculating editing precision. In most projects, the Timebase
should match the frame rate of captured footage. For DV projects, the Timebase
is set to 29.97 and cannot be changed. Timebase for PAL projects should be set
to 25; film projects should be set to 24. The Timebase setting also determines
which choices are available in the Display Format field. Both the Timebase and
the Display Format field) determine the positions of the ruler tick marks in the
Timeline window.
Note

70
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
✦Frame size. The frame size of your project is its width and height in pixels. The
first number represents the frame width, and the second number represents
the frame height. If you choose a DV preset, the frame size is set to the DV
defaults (720 × 480). If you are using the DV editing mode, you cannot change
the project frame size. However, frame size can be changed if you switch to
the Video for Windows editing mode. If you do need to change the frame size,
use a frame size that matches you video footage. If creating a project for the
Web or CD-ROM, you can reduce its frame size when exporting your project
(discussed in Part V later in the book).
✦Pixel aspect ratio. This setting determines the shape of the image pixels — the
width to height of one pixel in your image. For analog video and images created
in graphics programs or scanned, choose square pixels. The default setting for
D1/DV project is 0.9. The pop-up menu allows you to choose different settings.
If your footage and project will be D1/DV Widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio), choose
1.2; for D1/DV PAL, use 1.0666; for D1/DV PAL Widescreen, use 1.4222. Choose
the Anamorphic 2:1 choice if the video was shot on film with an anamorphic
lens. These lenses squeeze the images during shooting, but when projected, an
anamorphic projection lens reverses the compression to create a widescreen
effect.
If you need to change the frame rate of an imported clip or the pixel aspect ratio
(because either one doesn’t match your Project settings), select the clip in the
Project window and choose File ➪Interpret Footage. To change frame rate, in the
Interpret Footage dialog box, click Assume this frame rate. Then enter the new
frame rate in the field. To change pixel aspect ratio, click Conform to. Then choose
from a list of pixel aspect ratios. After you click OK, the Project window indicates
the changes.
If you need to import widescreen footage (16:9) aspect ratio into a project that
uses a 4:3 aspect ratio, you can scale or manipulate widescreen footage using the
Position and Scale options of the Motion video effect. See Chapter 17 for more
information about using the Motion video effect.
✦Fields. Fields are relevant only when working on a project that will be exported
to videotape. Each video frame is divided into two fields that appear for one-
sixtieth of a second. In the PAL standard, each field is displayed every one-
fiftieth of a second. Choose either the Upper or Lower setting in the fields
section depending upon which field your system expects. (See Chapter 22 for
more information.) If you are creating a project for the Web or that’s to be
viewed on a computer, choose the No fields option.
✦Display format. This setting determines the number of frames Premiere Pro
uses when it plays back from the Timeline and whether drop frame or non-drop
frame timecode is used. In Premiere Pro time for video projects is displayed 
in the Timeline and other windows using SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture
Television Engineers) video time readouts called timecode. In non-drop frame
timecode, colons are used to separate hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. At
29.97 or 30 frames per second in non drop frame time code, the frame follow-
ing 1:01:59:29 is 1:02:00:00.
Tip
Tip

71
Chapter 4 ✦Working with Project Settings
In drop-frame Timecode, semi-colons are used to separate hours, minutes, 
seconds, and frames. For instance, the frame after 1;01;59;29 is 01;02;00;02.
(The visual frame display drops numbers each minute to compensate for the
fact that the NTSC video frame rate is 29.97, not 30 frames a second. Note that
video frames are not dropped, only numbers in the timecode display are
dropped.
The difference between drop frame and non-drop frame time code is discussed in
more detail in Chapter 5.
✦Title safe area. These two settings are important if your project will be viewed
on a video monitor. The settings help you compensate for monitor overscan,
which can cause a TV monitor to cut off the edges of the pictures. The settings
provide a warning border, showing the limits where titles and actions can safely
be viewed. You can change the percentages for the title and action safe zones.
To view the safe areas in the Monitor window, choose Safe Margins from the
Monitor window menu. When the safe areas, shown in Figure 4-4, appear, make
sure that all titles appear within the first boundary and all actions appear within
the second boundary. The clip in Figure 4-4 is 705008f from Digital Vision’s
NightMoves CD.
✦Scale clip to project dimensions when adding to sequence. As you import
clips into your project, you need to understand how Premiere Pro deals 
with clips that don’t match the project frame size. If you select this option,
Premiere Pro reduces or enlarges imported images to match the frame size 
of the current project. Be warned that if this option is turned on, imported
images and clips may appear distorted. For instance, if you create a graphic 
in Photoshop with different pixel dimensions than those of your project, the
image will appear distorted when it is imported into Premiere Pro. By default,
this setting is turned off.
✦Sample rate. The audio sample rate determines audio quality. Higher rates
provide better quality audio. It’s best to keep this setting at the rate your audio
was recorded. If you change this setting to another rate, more processing is
required, and quality may be adversely affected.
✦Display format. When working with audio clips, you can change the Timeline
or Monitor window display to show Audio units instead of video frames. The
audio display format allows you to set audio units to be in milliseconds or audio
samples. (Like a frame in video, an audio sample is the smallest increment that
can be used in editing.) 
For more information about Audio sample rates and audio display formats, see
Chapter 8.
Since DV projects use industry standard settings, you should not change settings
for pixel aspect ratio, time base, frame size, or fields.

✦Compressor. As mentioned earlier, compression is used to store as much data
as possible in as little space as possible with a minimum loss of quality. The
compressor setting describes the CODEC Premiere Pro uses during Timeline
playback. If you capture video into Premiere Pro, you will typically use the same
compressor setting as you did when capturing video (such as DV-NTSC or 
DV-QuickTime). If you are exporting to videotape, you’ll typically use the same
CODEC again. (The CODECs are set automatically when you choose a preset.)
If you pick a DV setting, the Compressor field is set to DV (NTSC) or DV (PAL).
✦Color Depth. Specifies how many colors your project displays when playing
back video. For the best quality video, leave the color depth set to millions.
You can switch to 256 colors if allowed by the current CODEC chosen in the
Compressor field.

✦Optimize Stills. Choosing this option instructs Premiere Pro to use fewer
frames when rendering still images. For instance, instead of creating 30 frames
of video to render a one-second still image, Premiere Pro can optimize output
by creating one frame that is one second long. If still images are not cleanly
displayed with this option selected, deselect it and export your video again.
Figure 4-5: The Video Rendering section of the New Project dialog 
box provides settings for outputting video.
Default Sequence
The Default Sequence section of the New Project dialog box, shown in Figure 4-6, pro-
vides options for setting up Timeline defaults for new projects, including the number
of video and audio tracks in the Timeline window. You can access Default Sequence
settings when you create a new project by choosing File ➪New Project (or click 
the New Project button). Next, click the Custom Settings tab and then click Default
Sequence. To access this dialog box after creating a project, choose Project ➪Project
Settings ➪Default Sequence.
Changing settings in this dialog box section does not alter the current Timeline.
However, if you create a new project or a new sequence (by choosing File ➪New
Sequence), the next Timeline added to the project displays the new settings.
Options in the dialog box allow you change the number of video and audio tracks.
You can also choose whether to create submix tracks and Dolby Digital tracks. The
audio submix and Dolby 5.1 choices are covered in Chapters 8 and 9.

Summary
Premiere Pro provides a nonlinear system of creating desktop video projects. A
nonlinear system lets you edit video quickly and efficiently. You can easily edit and
insert clips without reassembling your entire project. When you create a new pro-
ject, you need to specify project settings. In this chapter, you learned the following:
✦When creating a new project, the easiest way to pick project settings is to
choose a preset from the New Project dialog box.
✦If you are creating a DV project, you shouldn’t need to change most DV presets.
✦To change project settings in a new project, click the Custom Settings tab in
the New Project dialog box.
✦Use the Default Sequence section of the New Project or Project Settings dialog
box to change the number of video and audio tracks in new projects.

Capturing Video
and Audio
T
he quality of video clips in a Premiere Pro project can
often mean the difference between a production that
attracts viewers and firmly holds their attention or one that
sends them looking for other sources of information or enter-
tainment. Undoubtedly, one of the primary factors in deter-
mining the quality of source material is how the video is
captured. Fortunately, Premiere Pro provides extremely effi-
cient and reliable capture options.
If you have a capture board or peripheral card that digitizes
analog video, you may be able to access the capture board
directly from Premiere Pro to digitize video. If you have an
IEEE 1394 port, you may also be able to use Premiere Pro’s
Capture window to transfer clips directly from your DV cam-
era. Depending upon the sophistication of your equipment
and the quality requirements of your production, you may 
be able to capture all of your video source material by using
Premiere Pro.
This chapter focuses on the process of capturing video and
audio using Premiere Pro. It leads you step-by-step through
the process of using Premiere Pro’s Capture window to capture
videotape to your computer’s hard disk. If your equipment
enables device control, you’ll be able to start and stop a cam-
corder or tape deck directly from Premiere Pro. You may also
be able to set up a batch capture session in which Premiere
Pro automatically uses list clip in and out points to capture
multiple clips during one session.
Getting Started
Before you start capturing video for a production, you should
first realize that the quality of the final captured footage
depends on the sophistication of your digitizing equipment

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
and the speed of the hard drive that you are using to capture the material. Much 
of the equipment sold today can provide quality suitable for the Web or in-house
corporate video. However, if your goal is to create very high-quality video produc-
tions and transfer them to videotape, you should analyze your production needs
and carefully assess exactly what hardware and software configuration best suits
your needs.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro can capture audio and video using low-end and high-
end hardware. Capture hardware, whether high- or low-end, usually falls into two
categories:
✦FireWire/IEEE1394. Apple Computer created the IEEE 1394 port primarily as
a means of quickly sending digitized video from video devices to a computer.
In Apple computers, the IEEE 1394 board is called a FireWire port. Several PC
manufacturers, including Sony (Sony calls its IEEE 1394 port an i.LINK port)
and Dell, sell computers with IEEE pre-installed. If you are shopping for an
IEEE1394, hardware should be OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface) compli-
ant. OHCI is a standard interface that allows Windows to work with and recog-
nize the card. If Windows has no problems recognizing the card, most DV
software applications will be able to utilize the card without problems.
If your computer has an IEEE 1394 port, you can transfer digitized data directly
from a DV camcorder to your computer. As mentioned in Chapter 4, DV cam-
corders actually digitize and compress the signal as you shoot. Thus, the IEEE
1394 port is a conduit between the already digitized data and Premiere Pro. If
your equipment is Premiere Pro-compatible, you’ll be able to use Premiere
Pro’s Capture window to start, stop, and preview the capture process. If you
have an IEEE 1394 board in your computer, you may be able to start and stop
a camcorder or tape deck from within Premiere Pro; this is called device con-
trol. With device control, everything is controlled from Premiere Pro. You can
cue up the video source material to specific tape locations, record timecode,
and set up batch sessions, which enable you to record different sections of
videotape automatically in one session.
To ensure high-quality capture, your hard disk should be able to sustain a 3.6 data
rate — the DV data rate.
✦Analog to digital capture cards. These cards take an analog video signal and
digitize it. Some computer manufacturers have sold models with these boards
built directly into the computer. On the PC, most analog-to-digital capture
boards are add-ins that must be installed in the computer. More expensive
analog-to-digital capture boards permit device control, enabling you to start
and stop a camcorder or tape deck as well as cue it up to the tape location
that you want to record. If you are using an analog to digital capture card, it’s
important to realize that not all cards are designed with the same standards,
and some may not be compatible with Premiere Pro. To check video card
compatibility, see www.adobe.com/products/premiere/dvhdwrdb.html.
Note

Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
Making the right connection
Before you begin the process of capturing video or audio, make sure that you’ve
read all relevant documentation supplied with the hardware. Many boards include
plug-ins so that you can capture directly into Premiere Pro (rather than first captur-
ing in another software application and then importing it into Premiere). Here’s a
brief description of the connection requirements for analog to digital boards and
IEEE 1394 ports:
✦Analog to digital. Most analog-to-digital capture boards use Composite Video
or S-Video systems. Some boards provide both Composite and S-Video. Hooking
up a Composite system usually entails connecting a cable with three RCA jacks
from the video and sound output jacks of your camcorder or tape deck to the
video and sound input jacks of your computer’s capture board. The S-Video
connection provides video output from your camcorder to the capture board.
Typically, this means simply connecting one cable from the camcorder or tape
deck’s S-Video output jack to the computer’s S-Video input jack. Some S-Video
cables have an extra jack for sound as well.
✦The IEEE/FireWire connection. Making the connection to your computer’s
IEEE 1394 port is easy. Simply plug the IEEE 1394 cable into the DV In/Out jack
of your camcorder, and plug the other end into the IEEE 1394 jack of your com-
puter. Despite the simplicity, be sure to read all documentation. The connection
may not work unless you supply external power to your DV cameras. The trans-
fer may not work on the DV camera’s batteries alone.
IEEE 1394 cables for desktop and laptop computers are usually different, and not
interchangeable. Furthermore, an IEEE 1394 cable that connects an external FireWire
hard drive to a computer may be different from an IEEE 1394 cable that connects
a computer to a camcorder. Before purchasing an IEEE 1394 cable, make sure you
have the right cable for your computer.
Starting the Capture Process
It’s important to understand that many settings in Premiere Pro depend upon the
actual equipment you have installed in your computer. It’s also important to under-
stand that the dialog boxes that appear when capturing change depending upon the
hardware and software installed in your computer. The dialog boxes that appear in
this chapter may vary from what you see on your computer, but the general steps for
capturing video and audio are pretty much the same. However, if you have a capture
board that digitizes analog video, the setup process is different than if you have an
IEEE 1394 port installed in your computer. The following sections describe how to
set up Premiere Pro for both systems.
To ensure that your capture session is successful, be sure to read all manufacturers,
read-me files and documentation. Know exactly what is installed in your computer.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Reviewing default capture settings
Before you begin the capture process, it’s a good idea to review Premiere Pro’s pro-
ject and default settings, which affect the capture process. After the defaults are set,
they remain saved when you reload the program. Defaults that affect capture include
scratch disk settings and device control settings.
Setting scratch disk default settings
Whether you are capturing digital video or digitizing analog video, one of your first
steps should be to ensure that Premiere Pro’s scratch disk is set up properly. The
scratch disk(s) is the disk used to actually perform the capture. Make sure that the
scratch disk is the fastest one connected to your computer and that the hard drive
is the one with the most free space. In Premiere, you can set different scratch 
disk locations for video and audio. To check scratch disk settings, choose Edit ➪
Preferences ➪Scratch Disks. If you want to change settings for captured video or
audio, click the appropriate Browse button and set a new capture path by navigat-
ing to a specified drive and folder with your mouse.
In the Capture Locations section, click the Browse button to choose the hard disk
or disks that you want to use for capturing video and audio
During the capture process, Premiere Pro also creates a conformed high-quality
audio file that Premiere Pro uses to quickly access audio. The Scratch Disk section
of the Preferences dialog box (Edit ➪Preferences) also allows you to set a scratch
disk location for conformed audio.
Device control default settings
If your system allows device control, you’ll be able to start and stop recording and
set in and out points using onscreen buttons in Premiere. You’ll also be able to per-
form batch capture operations in which Premiere captures multiple clips automati-
cally. To access the default settings for device control, choose Edit ➪Preferences ➪
Device Control. As discussed in Chapter 3, the Device Control section of the Prefer-
ences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-1, allows you to set Preroll and Timecode settings
as well as choose your video/audio source device.
The Device Control section contains the following options:
✦Devices. If you are using device control, set this drop-down menu to DV Device
Control or a device control choice provided by your board manufacturer. If you
are not using device control, you can set this option to None.
✦Preroll. Set a preroll time to enable your playback device to back up and get
up to speed before the capture starts. Refer to camcorder and tape deck
instructions for specifics.

Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
✦Timecode Offset. This setting allows you to alter the timecode recorded on
the captured video so that it accurately matches the right frame on the source
videotape.
✦Options. Clicking the Options button opens up the DV Device Control Options
dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-2. Here you can set your preferred video stan-
dard (NTSC or PAL), the Device Brand, Device Type, and Timecode Format
(Drop-Frame or Non-Drop-Frame). If your device is properly connected to
your computer, is turned on, and is in VCR mode, the status readout should
be “Online.” If you can’t get your device Online and you have an Internet con-
nection, try clicking Go Online for Device Info. You’ll be taken to an Adobe
Web page with compatibility information.

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Capture Project settings
The capture settings for a project determine how video and audio are captured. The
capture settings are determined by project presets. If you want to capture video from
a DV camera or DV tape deck, the capture process is straightforward. Because DV
cameras compress and digitize, there are very few settings to change. However, to
ensure the best quality capture, you must create a DV project before the capture
session.
Here are some general project setup steps to review before capturing:
1. Create a new project, by choosing File ➪New Project. If you are capturing
from a DV source, choose a DV project preset. If you are capturing from an
analog card, you will probably need to pick a non-DV preset provided or rec-
ommended by your manufacturer.
Drop frame versus non-drop frame timecode
SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) timecode is “striped” (recorded)
on tape on a track separate from the video track. Video producers use the timecode as a
means of specifying exact in and out points during edit sessions. When previewing footage,
producers often create a “window dub “of the timecode so that the timecode appears in a
window. This enables the producers to view the tape and the timecode at the same time.
By default, Premiere Pro uses the SMPTE timecode to display times in this format: hour:
minute: second: frame.
If you’re new to video or Premiere, this can take some getting used to. For example, the
next readout after 01:01:59:29 is 01:02:00:00. This timecode format code is called non-
drop frame. However, professional video producers typically use a timecode format called
drop frame.
Drop frame timecode is necessary because the NTSC professional video frame rate is 29.97
(not 30 frames a second). Over a long duration, the .03 time difference between 30 frames
and 29.97 frames begins to add up, resulting in inaccurate program times. To solve the
problem, professional video producers created a timecode system that would actually visu-
ally drop frames in the code without dropping frames in the video. When SMPTE non-drop
frame is striped, two frames of every minute are skipped — except for the tenth minute. In
drop frame timecode, the frame after 01;01;59;29 is 01;02;00;02. Notice that semicolons
are used to designate drop frame from non-drop frame.
If you are not creating video where exact time duration is important, you do not need to use
drop-frame timecode. You can capture and use 30 frames per second instead of the 29.97
project setting. Furthermore, non-drop frame was created for NTSC video. Do not use it for
PAL or SECAM, which use 25 frames per second.

81
Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
2. Check Capture Settings. To open the Capture Settings window, choose 
Project ➪Project Settings ➪Capture. Looking at the Capture section of the
Project Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 5-3, you might wonder where 
all the settings went. If you are capturing using DV equipment, Premiere Pro
uses the IEEE 1394 capture standard. (Many of these settings are visible in the
General section of the Project Settings dialog box. If you are using a third-party
board, you may see settings for frame rate, frame size, compressor, format [or
bit depth], and number of audio channels.)
3. Check connections. Check all connections from video equipment to your
computer. Turn on your video/audio source. If you’re using a camcorder, set 
it to VCR mode.
To prevent dropped frames during a DV capture session, your hard drive should be
able to sustain a 3.6MB per second data rate.
4. If your equipment supports device control, check settings by choosing 
Edit ➪Preferences Device Control. In the Device Control section, the Devices
drop-down menu should be set to DV Device Control. To set device control for
your playback device, click Options. In the DV Device Control Options dialog
box, choose your brand and Device Type. If your camcorder is already attached
to your computer and is turned to VCR mode, it should appear online (you can
also check this later in the Capture window).
5. Choose Project ➪Project Settings ➪Capture. If you are capturing DV using 
an IEEE 1394 connection, you should see DV/IEEE 1394 Capture. Those with
third-party boards may be able to change frame size and frame rate and audio
settings.
Figure 5-3: The Capture settings in the Project Settings dialog box.
Note

82
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Before beginning a capture session, make sure that no other programs besides
Premiere Pro are running. Also, it’s a good idea to be sure that your hard disk is
not fragmented. Windows XP Pro users can defragment and test for hard drive
errors by right-clicking their hard drives and then clicking Properties. Next, click the
Tools tab to access hard drive maintenance utilities.
Capture window settings
Before you start capturing, becoming familiar with the Capture Window settings is a
good idea. The settings determine whether video and audio are captured together
or separately. The window also allows you to change scratch disk and device con-
trol settings.
To open the Capture window, shown in Figure 5-4, choose File➪Capture. To view cap-
ture settings, click the Settings tab. If the Settings tab isn’t visible, click the Capture
window menu, and choose Expand Window (which changes to Collapse window once
the window is expanded) as shown in Figure 5-4. The following sections describe
different areas of the Capture window: the Capture window menu and the Capture
Settings, Capture Locations, and Device Control sections.
Tip
Timecode troubles
If you are using device control and are capturing a videotape with recorded timecode, it’s
very important that the timecode is continuous — that no time code is repeated. If you start
and stop recording timecode while shooting, two or more frames on one tape may have
the same timecode. For instance, two different frames on the tape may have 01;02;00;02
as their recorded code. This creates a problem for Premiere Pro. When Premiere Pro cap-
tures video using device control and batch processing, it seeks out a specific frame of
recorded timecode for the in point and captures until a frame of timecode is designated as
the out point. If the same timecode appears on the tape at different points, Premiere Pro
will get confused and will not capture the correct sequence.
One solution to this problem is to stripe all tape with continuous timecode before shooting.
Simply record black while you record timecode on the entire tape. Alternatively, you can try
a sort of rhythm method of shooting that prevents timecode numbers from being re-
recorded. To do so, shoot an extra 5 to 10 seconds of video after the scene that you want
recorded ends. When you start recording again, first rewind the tape so it begins at a loca-
tion that already has timecode recorded on it. If you see the timecode starting again at
00;00;00, rewind until you reach a section of previously recorded timecode.

✦Record Audio and Record Video. Here you can choose whether to capture
Audio only or Video only. The default setting is Audio and Video.
✦Scene Detect. Turns on Premiere’s automatic scene detection available with
device control. When Scene Detect is on, Premiere Pro automatically breaks
up the capture into different clips when Premiere Pro detects a change in 
the video time stamp, which occurs when the Pause button is pressed on a
camcorder.
✦Collapse Window. This command removes the Setting and Logging tabs from
the Window. When the window is collapsed, the menu command changes to
Expand Window.

84
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
Capture Settings
This section of the Capture window displays the selected capture settings from the
Project Settings dialog box. Clicking the Settings button opens the Capture Settings
dialog box. As mentioned earlier, if you are capturing DV, you will not be able to
change frame size or change audio options because all capture settings conform to
the IEEE standard. Those Premiere Pro users with a third-party board may see set-
tings that allow them to change frame size, frame rate, and audio sample rates.
Capture Locations
The Capture Locations section displays the default settings for Video and Audio. You
can change locations for Video and Audio by clicking either of the Browse buttons.
Device Control
The Device Control section displays defaults from the Device Control Preferences
dialog box. You can change the defaults here as well, and click the Options button
to set your playback device and see whether it is online. In this section, you can
also choose to abort the session if any frames are dropped during capture.
Capturing Video in the Capture Window
If your system does not allow device control, you can capture video by turning 
on your tape deck or camera and viewing the footage in the Capture window. By
manually starting and stopping the camera or tape deck, you can preview the
source material. Here are the steps to follow:
1. Make sure that all cables are properly connected.
2. Choose File ➪Capture ➪Capture. You can change the window size by clicking
and dragging the lower-right edge of the window.
3. If you want to capture only video or only audio, change settings in the
Capture window menu. (You can also change settings by clicking the Logging
tab and choosing Video [only] or Audio [only] from the drop-down list.)
4. Set the camera or tape deck to Play mode. You should see and hear the
source clip in the Capture window as the tape plays.
5. Five to Seven seconds before the section that should be recorded appears,
click the Record button in the Movie Capture window. At the top of the cap-
ture screen, you’ll see a display of the capture progress, including whether
any frames were dropped during the recording.
6. To stop recording, press Esc. When the recording is paused, the File Name
dialog box appears.
7. Type a filename for the clip. Optionally, you may type additional comments
in the Comments box.

85
Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
8. Click OK to save the file. The captured clip appears in the Project window.
9. Press the Stop button on your playback device.
To view clip information about dropped frames, data rate, and file location, right-
click the clip in the Project window and choose Properties from the drop-down
menu that appears. Alternatively, select the clip and choose File ➪Properties ➪
Selection.
Capturing with device control
During the capture session, device control enables you to start and stop a camera
or tape deck directly from Premiere. If you have an IEEE 1394 connection and are
capturing from a camcorder, chances are you’ll be able to use device control. Other-
wise, to work with device control, you need a capture board that supports device
control as well as a frame-accurate tape deck (that is controlled by the board). If you
do not have a DV board, you will probably need a Premiere Pro-compatible plug-in
to use device control. If device control is supported by your system, you may also
be able to import the timecode and automatically generate a batch list to batch
capture clips automatically.
The device control buttons provided at the bottom of the Capture window magically
control your camcorder or VCR. The buttons and callouts for them are shown in
Figure 5-5. Using these buttons, you can start and stop and set in and out points for
the video.

Performing a batch capture
If your capture board supports device control, you can set up a batch capture list
that appears in the Project window, as shown in Figure 5-7. The checks in the
Capture Settings column indicate which offline clips will be captured. Note that the
icon for the offline clips is different than the normal online icon in the Project win-
dow. Other columns in the Project window indicate the in and out points for the
clips that will be captured. After creating the list, you can have Premiere Pro cap-
ture each of the clips automatically while you go off and take a coffee break. You
can create a batch capture list manually or by using device control. If you create a
batch list manually, you will need to type the timecode in and out points for all
clips. If you use device control, Premiere Pro enters the start and stop times, after
you click the Set In and Set Out buttons in the Timecode section of the Logging tab
in the Capture window.

Creating a batch capture list manually
To create a batch capture list of clips that you specify manually, follow these steps:
1. If you want the batch list in a bin in the Project window, open the bin or
create one by clicking the Folder button at the bottom of the window.
2. To create the batch file listing, choose File ➪New Offline File (or click the
New Item and choose New Offline file). The Offline File dialog box, shown in
Figure 5-8, opens.
3. Type an in point, an out point, and a filename for the clip. Add other
descriptive notes such as a real name.
4. Click OK. The clip’s information is added to the Project window.

points of all clips, you can use Premiere Pro’s Capture window to do the job for 
you. Here are the steps:
1. Open the Movie Capture window by choosing File ➪Capture ➪Capture.
2. Click the Logging tab. In the Clip Data section, enter a Tape Name and the
Clip Name that you want to see in the Project window. Add other comments
as desired.
3. Use the capture control icons to locate the portion of the tape that includes
the section you want to capture.
4. Click the Set In button. The in point appears in the Logging tab’s In field.
Note

Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
5. Use the capture control icons to locate the clip’s out point.
6. Click the Set Out button. The out point appears in the Out field.
7. Click the Log Clip button and enter a filename for the clip (unless you want
to use the default name provided). If desired, type comments in the dialog
box and then click OK.
8. For every clip you want to capture, repeat Steps 4–8.
9. If you want to save the batch list to disk, so that you can capture the clips at
another time, or so that you can load the list into another computer applica-
tion, choose Project ➪Export Batch list. You can reload the list later when you
want to begin the capture session by choosing Project ➪Import Batch list.
10. Close the Movie Capture window.
Capturing using a batch list
After you’ve created a batch list of clips that you want to capture, you can have
Premiere Pro capture the clips automatically from a list in the Project window. In
order to complete the following steps, you need to create a batch list as described
in the previous section.
Batch lists can be automatically captured only by systems that support device 
control.
1. If your batch list of offline files is saved and not loaded into the Project
window, load the list by choosing Project ➪Import Batch list. This loads 
the list of files into the Project window.
2. To specify which clips you want captured, select the offline clips in the
Project window and then choose File ➪Batch Capture. This opens the Batch
Capture dialog box where you can change capture settings by clicking over-
ride clip settings, if desired; otherwise, click OK.
3. When the Insert Tape dialog box appears, make sure the correct tape is in
your camcorder/playback device and then click OK. The Capture window
opens, and the capture process begins.
4. Check to see capture status. When the batch process is over, an alert will
appear, indicating that the clips have been captured. In the Project window,
Premiere Pro changes the icons of the filenames to indicate that they are now
linked to files on disk. To see the status of the captured clips, scroll right in
the Project window. You’ll see check marks for captured clips in the Capture
Settings column. The status for the clips should be “Online,” another indica-
tion that the clips are linked to disk files.
Note

91
Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
If you have offline files in the Project window and you want to link them to files
that have already been captured, right-click the clip in the Project window, then
choose Link Media. You will then need to navigate with the mouse to the actual
clip on your hard disk.
Adding Timecode to a Clip
High-end video cameras and mid-range DV cameras can record timecode to video-
tape (often called SMPTE timecode, for the Society of Motion Picture and Television
Engineers). The timecode provides a frame-accurate readout of each videotape
frame in Hour:Minute:Second:Frame format. Timecode is used by video producers
to move to specific locations on tape and also to set in and out points. During an
edit session, broadcast equipment uses the timecode to create frame-accurate edits
of the source material onto the final program tape.
When capturing with device control, Premiere Pro captures the timecode along
with the video. When capturing video or importing video, you may want to use a
clip that doesn’t have timecode striped on the tape, yet does have the timecode vis-
ible onscreen (called a window dub). In these cases, you can’t actually capture time-
code from the clip. However, you can use Premiere Pro to set timecode on the tape.
To add timecode to a clip, follow these steps:
1. Select the clip in the Project window and double-click on it to open it in the
Monitor window. If you don’t want the timecode to start at the beginning of
the clip, move to the frame at which you want to begin recording.
2. Choose File ➪Timecode.
3. In the Timecode dialog box, shown in Figure 5-9, enter the timecode that
you want to use.
Note
Where’s my audio?
If you’ve captured video and audio and don’t hear the audio, you may need to wait until
Premiere Pro finishes creating an audio conforming file for the captured segment. When an
AVI video file is created, the audio is interleaved with the video. By creating a separate high-
quality conforming audio file, Premiere Pro can access and process audio faster as you edit.
The downside of a conforming file is that you must wait for it to be created, and it takes 
up extra hard disk space. However, the advantages of faster audio processing outweigh the
disadvantages.

92
Part I ✦Getting Started with Premiere Pro
4. If you moved to a specific frame and want to start the timecode at that
point, click Set at Current Frame.
5. Enter a Tape Name.
6. Click OK.
Figure 5-9: Use the clip Timecode dialog 
box to set the timecode for a clip.
Capturing Audio
Premiere Pro enables you to capture audio independently of video using its Audio
Mixer window. When you capture audio, quality is based on the sample rate and bit
depth. The sample rate is the number of samples taken each second. The bit depth
is the number of bits (eight bits are in a byte of data) per each sample of the actual
digitized audio (the minimum bit depth of most audio CODECs is 16). Premiere’s
audio settings options enable you to specify sample rates and bit depth as well as
choose between Mono and Stereo. As you capture, remember that higher bit rates
and sample rates create larger files. Remember also that Stereo capturing requires
more hard drive space than mono files.
If you are using a PC and have a video or soundboard installed in your computer,
you can review or change capture settings for capturing analog audio by choosing
File ➪Project Settings Capture. If you have analog capture equipment, these settings
control how audio will be captured. Remember that the higher the sample and bit
rates, the better the audio. However, these files will consume more disk space than
files recorded at lower quality settings.
To record using the audio mixer, follow these steps:
1. Connect the tape recorder, microphone, or other audio source to the sound
port or sound card of your computer.

93
Chapter 5 ✦Capturing Video and Audio
If you want to create a new audio track for your audio capture, choose Sequence ➪
Add Track. In the Audio track section, enter 1 in the Add Audio Track field. If you
are using a monophonic microphone, choose Mono in the Track Type drop-down
menu and enter 0 in the Add Video Track and Add Submix tracks fields. 
2. Open the Audio Mixer window, shown in Figure 5-10, by choosing Window ➪
Audio Mixer.
3. If you have video on the Timeline and want to record narration for the
video, move the Timeline about 5 seconds before you want the audio to
begin.
4. To prepare for recording, click the Record Enable button (Microphone) in
the Audio Mixer window in the track section for the track you are record-
ing. The Record button is at the bottom of the Audio Mixer window.
5. Test audio levels. In the Audio Mixer window choose Meter Input(s) Only.
This displays hardware inputs in the VU meter displays for tracks being
recorded. Note that when Meter Input(s) Only is activated, you can still view
track levels for those tracks that you aren’t recording.

6. Speak into the microphone. Adjust levels for the track if necessary. As you
speak, sound levels should be near 0 db without entering the red zone. If
desired, you can turn off Meter Input(s) Only.
7. To actually start recording, click the Play button at the bottom of the Audio
Mixer window.
8. Play the tape recorder or begin recording the narration. As you record,
watch the levels in the Audio Mixer, and adjust as the faders as needed.
9. When the narration or audio is complete, click the Record button to stop
recording in the Audio Mixer window.
Summary
Premiere Pro enables you to capture video and audio directly from a video camera
or videotape recorder. You can also capture audio from a camcorder or other sound
device.

Using the
Timeline and
Sequences
U
ndoubtedly, Premiere Pro’s Timeline is its most versa-
tile and elaborate window. Not only does the Timeline
provide a graphical overview of clips, transitions, and effects,
but it also abounds with buttons, icons, drop-down menus,
and sliders that control how footage is viewed and exported.
Using the Timeline, you can edit and assemble digital footage,
and you can also fine-tune video transparency and audio vol-
ume, as well as the placement of keyframes for both audio and
video effects. With all of this power jam-packed in one win-
dow, you’ll want to take full advantage of all the Timeline has
to offer. If you do, you’re sure to be working as efficiently as
possible in Premiere Pro.
To get you started, this chapter provides a thorough review of
the Timeline window features and options. It shows you how
to move through footage in the Timeline, add tracks, lock
tracks, and change viewing modes. The chapter also includes
a section on how to use sequences. In Premiere Pro, a sequence
is the assembled footage that is placed in the Timeline window.
As you’ll soon see, Premiere Pro allows you to create multiple
sequences in a Timeline window, separate sequences into dif-
ferent Timeline windows, and drag one sequence into another
to create a “nested” sequence.
Touring the Timeline
At first glance, trying to decipher all the Timeline buttons,
icons, sliders, and controls may seem like an overwhelming
task. But you’ll find that after you start using the Timeline,
you’ll gradually learn what each feature does and how to use
it. To make the process of exploring the Timeline easier, this

section is organized according to three specific Timeline locales: the ruler area 
and icons that control the ruler, the Video tracks, and the Audio tracks. Before you
get started, you may want to place a video and audio clip from the Chapter 1 or
Chapter 6 folder of the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible DVD into the Timeline window.
This will allow you to experiment with the different viewing options discussed in
this section. To load the video and audio clip from the Chapter 1 or Chapter 6 folder
of the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible DVD, choose File ➪Import. After the clip appears in
the Project window, click and drag the video footage to Video track 1. Click and drag
the audio file into Audio track 1. (The video clip in Chapter 1 is 705008f; the audio clip
is 705001.aif; both are from Digital Vision’s NightMoves CD. The clip in the Chapter 6
folder is 65005f.mov from Digital Vision’s SkyRider CD.)
If the Timeline window is not visible onscreen, you can open it by double-clicking
Sequence listing in the Project window.
Timeline ruler options
The Timeline ruler icons and controls determine how footage is viewed and what
areas are rendered and exported by Premiere Pro. Figure 6-1 provides a look at the
Timeline ruler icons and controls.

Chapter 6 ✦Using the Timeline and Sequences
Here is a description of the Timeline ruler controls:
✦Time ruler. The Time ruler is a visual display of time intervals divided into
frames per second, which corresponds to your project frame rate. The actual
number of tick marks between numbers that appear on the ruler are controlled
by the current zoom level (which you can adjust by dragging the viewing area
bar or zoom slider).
By default, the Timeline ruler displays timer intervals in frames per second. If you
are editing audio, you can change the ruler to display audio units in milliseconds
or audio samples. To switch to audio units, choose Audio units in the Timeline
menu (shown in Figure 6-1). Choose either milliseconds or audio samples in the
Audio section of the Project Settings dialog box (Project ➪Project Settings ➪
General).
✦Current-time indicator. The current-time indicator (CTI) is the blue triangular
icon that appears in the ruler. You can click and drag the CTI to gradually move
through your footage. You can click in the Ruler area to move the CTI to a spe-
cific frame, and you can type a time in the Time display and press Enter to
move to that position. You can also click and drag left or right in the Time dis-
play to move the current-time indicator left or right along the ruler.
✦Time display. As you move the current-time indicator through the Timeline,
the Time display indicates the position of the current frame. You can quickly
jump to a specific frame by clicking the Time display and entering a time. When
you type, you do not need to enter semicolons or colons. For instance, you
can move to frame 02:15:00 by clicking in the Frame readout area, typing 215,
and pressing Enter. If you set a project’s Display Format to be drop frame, time
is displayed with semi-colons. If you set a project’s Display Format to be non-
drop frame, time is displayed with colons. To view or change the Display
Format for a project, choose Project ➪Project Settings ➪General.
✦Viewing area bar. Clicking and dragging the viewing area bar changes the zoom
level in the Timeline. The zoom level determines ruler increments and how
much footage appears in the Timeline window. You can click and drag on either
end of the viewing bar to change the zoom level. Clicking and dragging the right
viewing endpoint of the Viewing area bar to the left displays fewer frames on
the Timeline. Consequently, this increases the distance on the ruler between
tick marks as shorter time intervals are displayed. Dragging right shows more
footage and decreases the time intervals on the Timeline. To summarize: To
zoom in, click and drag left on the viewing area bar; to zoom out, click and
drag right. As you click and drag, notice that the zoom slider in the lower-left
corner changes accordingly. Figure 6-2 shows the Timeline footage zoomed in.
Note the difference between the zoomed-out view in Figure 6-1 and the zoomed-
in view in Figure 6-2.
Tip

100
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Figure 6-2: Timeline zoomed-in view.
✦Work area bar. Beneath the Timeline ruler is Premiere Pro’s work area bar,
which can be used to designate a work area for exporting or rendering. You
can click and drag either end point of the work area bar or drag the entire bar
from left to right. Why would you change the work area bar? When you render
your project, Premiere Pro only renders the area defined by the work area bar.
Furthermore, when you export your file you can choose to only export the
work area section of the selected sequence in the Timeline.
You can quickly adjust the width and position of the work area bar by resetting its in
and outpoints with keyboard shortcuts. To set an in point, move the current-time
indicator to a specific frame and press Alt+[; to set an out point, move the current-
time indicator to a specific frame and press Alt+]. You can also expand or contract
the work area bar to encompass the footage in the current sequence or the width
of the Timeline window (whichever is shorter) by double-clicking the work area bar.
✦Preview indicator. The preview indicator displays which portion of your 
program has been rendered. Once footage is rendered, transitions and effects
appear at their highest quality (if Highest Quality or Automatic Quality is 
set as the display choice in the Monitor menu). As a sequence is rendered,
Premiere Pro saves the rendered work file to disk. Green areas in the Preview
indicator area indicate footage that has been rendered. Red indicates non-
rendered footage. To render the work area, press Enter or choose Sequence ➪
Render Work Area.
✦Zoom slider. Clicking and dragging the zoom slider serves the same purpose
as clicking and dragging the viewing area bar. Clicking and dragging left zooms
in (you can also click the zoom in button). As you zoom in, more tickmarks
are displayed on the Timeline, allowing you to see more of your footage within
the boundaries of the Timeline window. Clicking and dragging to zoom out
increases the distance between tick marks and shows less of your footage.
Tip

101
Chapter 6 ✦Using the Timeline and Sequences
✦Set Unnumbered Marker button. Sequence markers allow you to set points
on the Timeline to which you can quickly jump. Sequence markers can also
help you divide up your work in the Timeline as you edit. Markers can also be
used as chapter headings when you export Premiere Pro projects to DVD. To
set an unnumbered marker, drag the current-time indicator to the frame where
you want the marker to appear and then click the Set Unnumbered Marker
button (pentagon icon to the right of magnet icon).
Timeline track icons and options
Undoubtedly, the most important areas of the Timeline are its video and audio tracks,
which provide a visual representation of your video and audio footage, transitions,
and effects. Using the Timeline track options, you add and delete tracks and control
how tracks are displayed. You can also control whether specific tracks are output
when you export your project. You can also lock tracks and specify whether to view
video frames in video tracks.
The following is a review of the icons and track options shown in Figure 6-3:
✦Snap. The Snap icon toggles Premiere’s Snap to Edges command. When Snap
is on, frames from one sequence snap to touch frames from the next sequence.
This electronic magnetic effect helps ensure that no gaps appear in your 
production. To enable Snap, you can simply click the Snap icon or choose
Sequence ➪Snap. When Snap is on, the magnet in the upper-left corner of the
Timeline appears as though it is pressed down.
✦Target. When you edit footage using the Monitor window, Premiere Pro places
the footage in the current target track in the Timeline. To specify a target track,
simply click in the far-left area of the track. The target track changes to display
rounded edges, as shown in track 1 in Figure 6-3.
✦Collapse/Expand. To view all the options available for a track, click the
Collapse/Expand track button. If you are not using a track, you might as well
leave the track in its unexpanded mode so that it doesn’t consume too much
screen space. If you’ve expanded a track and want to collapse it, simply click
the Collapse/Expand icon again.
✦Toggle Track Output. Clicking the Eye icon toggles on and off track output,
which prevents the track from being viewed either in the Monitor window 
during playing or when exporting. To turn output on again, click the button
again, and the Eye icon returns, indicating that the track will be viewed in the
Monitor window and output when exporting.
✦Toggle Track Lock. Clicking the Toggle Track Lock track icon locks the track.
When a track is locked, no changes can be made to the track. When you click
on the Lock track icon, a lock appears indicating that the track is locked. To
unlock the track, click again on the icon.

102
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
✦Set Display Style. Clicking on this pop-up menu allows you to choose how and
whether thumbnail images appear in the Timeline tracks. The choices are Head
and Tail, Show Head Only, Show Frames, and Show Name only. To view footage
in the frames throughout a clip, choose Show Frames.
✦Show keyframes/Opacity handles. Clicking this pop-up menu allows you to
view keyframes or opacity handles in the Timeline. Keyframes denote control
points for special effects set in the Effects window. Opacity indicates trans-
parency in frames. After you’ve created effects with keyframes, you can alter
them by clicking and dragging the keyframes in the Timeline or dragging the
opacity handles up or down. Dragging down lowers opacity, and dragging up
raises opacity.
✦Add/Remove keyframe. Clicking this button allows you to add or remove a
keyframe from a track’s effects graph line. To add a keyframe, move the current-
time indicator to where you want the keyframe to appear and click the Add/
Remove keyframe button. To remove the keyframe, move the current-time
indicator to the keyframe and then click the Add/Remove keyframe button.

You can also create and remove keyframes by Ctrl+clicking with the Pen tool.
Audio track icons and options
Audio track Timeline controls are similar to video track controls. Using the audio
track Timeline options, you can adjust audio volume, choose which tracks are
exported, and show and hide keyframes. Premiere Pro provides a variety of differ-
ent audio tracks: standard audio, Submix tracks, Master tracks, and 5.1 tracks. 
Use the standard audio track for .wav and .aif clips. The Master track is used for a
mix of all tracks. Submix tracks allow you to create effects with a subset of your
tracks rather than all of them. Audio is placed in the Master and Submix tracks
using Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixers. The 5.1 tracks are special tracks only used for
surround sound audio. Figure 6-3 shows the audio section of the Timeline with a
Master, Submix, and 5.1 track.
Chapter 8 covers using audio in the Timeline and creating audio effects. Chapter 9
covers the Audio Mixer, Master, and Submix tracks.
If you drag a video clip that contains audio to a video track, the audio automati-
cally is placed in the corresponding audio track. Otherwise, you can simply drag
music audio to an audio track; as the Timeline plays, the video and corresponding
audio will play.
The following describes many of the audio icons and options see in Figure 6-3:
✦Target. As you edit, Premiere Pro outputs to the target track. The target track
in Figure 6-3 is Audio 1. Note that audio has rounded corners. To select a 
target track, click it.
✦Enable Track Output. Clicking this icon turns off and on audio output for the
track. When output is off, audio is not output when played in the Monitor 
window or when the project is output.
✦Toggle Lock. Locks the track so it cannot be altered. Clicking the Toggle Lock
track icon toggles track locking on or off. When a track is locked, a lock icon
appears.
✦Set Display Style. Click this drop-down menu to choose whether audio clips
are displayed by name or as a waveform.
✦Show Clip/Track keyframe/Volume. This drop-down menu allows you to
choose to view keyframes or volume settings for audio clips or for the entire
track. Keyframes in the audio track indicate changes in audio effects. If you
choose to show volume settings for clips or the entire track, you can adjust
the volume in the Timeline using the Pen tool.

(see Chapter 9). Like other audio tracks, the Master track can be expanded;
you can show keyframes and volume. and you can set or remove keyframes.
Track Commands
As you work with the Timeline, you may want to add or remove or rename audio
and video tracks. This section reviews the commands for renaming, adding, and
removing tracks, as well as for changing the Snap options and the starting point of 
a sequence, the sequence zero point. Some of the commands described next are
activated by right-clicking in the Timeline window; others are activated through
menu commands.
✦Rename Track. To rename an audio or video track, right-click its name. After
you release the mouse, you will be able edit the track’s name.
✦Add Track. To add a track, choose Sequence ➪Add Track (or right-click on a
track name and choose Add Track). This opens the Add Tracks dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-4. Here you can choose what type of track to create and
where to place it.
✦Delete Track. Before deleting a track, decide whether you want to delete a tar-
get track or empty tracks. If you want to delete a target track, click at the left
side of the track to select it and choose Sequence ➪Delete Track (or right-
click the track name and choose Delete Track). This opens the Delete Tracks
dialog box where you can choose to delete empty tracks, the target tracks, or
Submix tracks.
✦Snap. The Snap icon (magnet) toggles Premiere Pro’s Snap Edges command.
When activated, clips snap together automatically when you click and drag

105
Chapter 6 ✦Using the Timeline and Sequences
one near the other. This prevents Timeline gaps between edits. To enable
Snap, you can also choose Sequence ➪Snap.
✦Sequence Zero Point. You can change the zero point of a sequence by moving
the Timeline to the position you want the sequence timecode to start and
choosing Sequence Zero Point from the Timeline window menu. Why change
the sequence zero point? You may start your production with a countdown, or
other sequence, but not want the duration of this opening sequence to be
added to Timeline frame count.
✦Display Audio Units. By default, Premiere Pro shows Timeline intervals in
frames. You can change the Timeline interval to display audio samples, by
choosing Audio Units in the Timeline Window menu. If you choose Audio
Units, the display shows audio samples in milliseconds.
Figure 6-4: Use the Add Tracks dialog box 
to specify options for new tracks.
Using Multiple Sequences
An assembled production in a Timeline is called a sequence. Why differentiate between
the Timeline and the sequence within it? The answer is that you can have multiple
sequences within a Timeline, each sequence featuring different footage. Furthermore,
each sequence has a name and can be renamed. You may want to use multiple
sequences to divide your project into smaller elements. After you’ve completed edit-
ing in the smaller sequences, you can then combine them into one sequence before
exporting. You may also want to copy and paste footage from one sequence into
another to simply experiment with different edits, effects, or transitions. Figure 6-5
shows a Timeline window with two sequences within it.

106
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Creating a new sequence
When you create a new sequence, it is automatically added to the active Timeline
window as a new tab in the window, as shown in Figure 6-5. Creating a sequence is
easy; simply choose File ➪New ➪Sequence. This opens the New Sequence dialog
box, shown in Figure 6-6. Here you can rename the sequence and choose how many
tracks to add. Clicking OK creates a new sequence and adds it to the currently
selected Timeline. If you want to view the sequence in a separate window, click its
tab and drag it off the Timeline window. After you have two sequences onscreen,
you can cut and paste from one to the other or edit a sequence and nest it into
another sequence.
Figure 6-5: The Timeline window with two sequences.
Figure 6-6: The New Sequence dialog box controls 
how tracks are created in new sequences.

107
Chapter 6 ✦Using the Timeline and Sequences
To move from sequence to another in the Timeline window, you click the sequence’s
tab. If you want to separate a sequence into another Timeline window, drag its tab
out of the Timeline window. When you release the mouse, Premiere Pro creates a new
Timeline window with the sequence within it. If you have multiple Timeline windows
open onscreen, you can activate a Timeline window with a sequence in it by choosing
Window ➪Timelines and then choosing the sequence name in the submenu.
Nesting sequences
After you create a new sequence in a project, you can place footage in it and create
effects and transitions. Later, if desired, you can embed or nest it into another
sequence. You can use this feature to gradually create a project in separate short
sequences and later assemble them all into one sequence.
One advantage of nesting is that you can reuse an edited sequence again and again,
by simply nesting it several times in another Timeline. Each time you nest one
sequence in another, you can trim it or change the transitions surrounding it on 
the Timeline. When you add an effect to a nested sequence, Premiere Pro applies
the effect to all the clips in the sequence, saving you from having to apply the same
effect to multiple clips.
If you are going to nest sequences, it’s important to note that nested sequences
always refer to their original source clips. If you change the original source clips,
the change will be reflected in the sequences in which it is nested.
Figure 6-7 shows how a nested sequence appears in the Timeline window. In this
figure, Sequence 02 was nested within Sequence 01, and audio and video transitions
were added between the two sequences.
The nested sequence in Figure 6-7 includes an mage is from the Skyrider folder
from Digital Vision’s SkyRider CD-ROM. The clip, 652005f.mov, is included in the
Chapter 6 folder of the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible DVD. Figure 6-7 also includes
two video clips called diners.mov and chefs.mov. These clips are from the Nite
Out project in Chapter 1. The clips are Digital Vision’s NightMoves 705008f.mov
and 705009f.mov.

Here’s how to nest one sequence within another:
1. Create a new sequence by choosing File ➪New ➪Sequence.
2. In the new sequence, create edits, transitions, and effects as needed.
3. To nest one sequence in another sequence, click and drag a sequence from
the Project window or from the Source section of the Monitor window into
the track of another sequence.
To open a sequence in the Source section of the Monitor window, Ctrl+double-
click it in the Project window or in the Timeline window.
To quickly return to the original sequence of a nested sequence, double-click the
nested sequence in the Timeline window.
Summary
Premiere Pro provides numerous features in the Timeline window to control how
clips are viewed and exported. In the Timeline window you can create more than
sequence, or you can create a new sequence and view it in another window.
✦Use Timeline ruler options to change zoom levels.
✦Select a track by clicking at the head of the track to make it the target track.
✦Tracks can be locked and hidden.
✦You can view keyframe and opacity settings in video tracks.
✦To create a new sequence, choose File ➪New ➪Sequence.
✦To nest one sequence in another, click and drag the sequence from the Project
window into a track in the Timeline window of another sequence.

E
diting drives a video program. The careful assembly of
sound and video clips can control excitement, tension,
and interest. Fortunately, Premiere Pro makes this crucial 
element of digital video production a logical, creative, and
rewarding process rather than a tedious and frustrating one.
Premiere Pro’s interface — which features its Timeline and
Monitor windows — combines with its track selection and
editing tools to provide a fully integrated and powerful work-
ing environment.
This chapter introduces you to the basic techniques of editing
in Premiere Pro. It begins with an overview of the editing pro-
cess and proceeds to basic Timeline editing tasks, such as
selecting and moving clips from one part of the Timeline to
another. The chapter concludes with a discussion of creating
insert and overlay edits by using the Source and Program
views in the Monitor window. Premiere Pro’s advanced editing
techniques are discussed in Chapter 13.
The clips used in the figures in this chapter are from
705008f.mov from Digital Vision’s Night Moves CD-ROM.

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Basic Editing Concepts and Tools
Before you begin editing video in Premiere Pro, you need a basic idea of different
techniques that you can use to edit a digital video production. Premiere Pro provides
two main areas for editing clips and assembling them — the Timeline window and
the Monitor window. As discussed earlier in this book, the Timeline provides a visual
overview of your project. You can begin creating a rough edit by simply dragging
clips from the Project window over the Timeline. Using the selection tools in the
Timeline, you begin arranging the clips in a logical order.
As you work, you can fine-tune your production by performing edits in the Monitor
window. When you edit in the Monitor window, you can set up the Source view to
show you a clip that isn’t in the Timeline, while the Program view shows you clips
already edited the Timeline. Using controls in the Monitor window, you can insert the
source clip into the clip that’s already in the Timeline, or overlay the source clip so
that it replaces a portion of the clip that is in the Timeline. The steps and examples
in this chapter lead you to the point where you can create, insert, and overlay edits.
To further fine-tune your editing work, you can use Premiere Pro Pro’s editing tools
to perform ripple, slide, and slip edits. These, along with more sophisticated editing
techniques that can be performed in the Monitor window — such as three- and four-
point editing, lifts, and extracts — are discussed in Chapter 13.
As you work, you undoubtedly develop habits that suit the types of productions
you are creating. For example, many editing commands feature keyboard shortcuts.
You may find it more efficient to set the in and out points of clips by using keyboard
shortcut keys.
When you are performing edits, you may find that using keyboard shortcuts saves
time. To display the keyboard commands, choose Edit ➪Keyboard Customization.
Choose Windows in the pop-up menu and then open the section for Monitor and
Trim Windows.
The workspace
An important consideration before actually editing a project is to plan how you
want your workspace set up. To pick a predefined workspace, choose Window ➪
Workspace and then choose from the four choices presented: Editing, Audio,
Effects, and Color Correction.
In the Editing workspace, shown in Figure 7-1, the Timeline, Monitor, and Project
windows consume the entire screen. These are the most important windows you’ll
be using as you assemble a project. You can drag clips from the Project window
into the Source section of the Monitor window, or you can drag them directly from
the Timeline. As you’ll see later in this chapter, you can edit the clips in either the
Timeline or Monitor window.
Note

111
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
Figure 7-1: The Editing workspace.
At any point in time, you can change the arrangement of palettes onscreen and save
your workspace by choosing Window ➪Workspace ➪Save Workspace. This com-
mand adds your workspace to the options in the Windows ➪Workspace submenu.
When you want to reload your workspace, simply choose Window ➪Workspace and
select your workspace from the menu.
Getting Started
After you’ve imported your video, audio, and still footage into the Project window,
you may be tempted to immediately start dragging clips to the Timeline to begin the
process of editing your production. If you’re working on a long project with many
production elements, you’ll undoubtedly want to plan your production on paper
beforehand. If you work from a script that describes the video elements and includes
all narration, you’ll save yourself hours of time when you begin to edit your produc-
tion. To help you visualize your production or various parts of it, you may also want
to create a storyboard, which contains drawings or printouts of the video. After
you’ve loaded the various production elements into bins in the Timeline, you may
find it helpful also to double-click each clip in the Project window, and click the play
button in the Monitor window to view each clip before editing.

112
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
For beginners who are working on new projects, it may also be a good idea to prac-
tice editing short video and audio sequences so that you become familiar with the
basic techniques of creating a production. In Premiere Pro, you can edit clips either
in the Monitor or Timelime window. Beginners may be tempted to drag all clips into
the Timeline and click and drag to edit them there. But for precision editing, the
Monitor window provides better controls for fine-tuning your work. After you’ve
edited a clip’s in and out points in the Monitor window, you can then drag the clip
to the Timeline, or have Premiere Pro place it there for you.
Working with the Monitor Window
The Monitor window is not only used for previewing your production as you work,
but it can also be used for precise editing and trimming. You can use the Monitor
window to trim clips before placing them on the Timeline, for dropping edited clips
in the Timeline. You can also use it to fine-tune edits of clips already assembled in
the Timeline. When editing using the Monitor window, you can choose to set in and
out points in Single View (see Figure 7-2), Dual View (see Figure 7-3), or Trim View
(see Figure 7-4). In Single View mode, the Monitor displays just the edited program
(clips on the Timeline). Dual View mode displays a source clip (a clip not yet added
to the Timeline) in the left side of the window and the program material (clips on
the Timeline) on the right side of the window. In Trim View mode, the frame to the
right and the frame to the left of the edit line are represented in a separate section
to provide greater precision for setting in and out points. To select a view mode for
the Monitor window, click one of the mode buttons near the top of the Monitor win-
dow or choose Single View, Dual View, or Trim from the Monitor window’s menu.
Figure 7-2: The Monitor window in Single View.

113
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
Figure 7-3: The Monitor window in Dual View.
Monitor-safe margins enable you to show the video-safe zones for movement and for
titles. By clicking the Monitor menu and choosing Safe Margins, you can activate
safe-zone markers in the Monitor window that indicate the image area that is safely
within the monitor viewing area, as well as the image area that might be over-
scanned. A safe zone is needed because television monitors overscan an image, thus
expanding portions of it beyond the screen. To view the safe-zone markers in the
Monitor window, choose Safe Margins from the Monitor window menu. When the
safe-zone margins appear in the Monitor window, the inner safe zone is the title-safe
area, and the outer is the action-safe area.
In most editing situations, you want to view the Monitor window in Dual View mode.
This enables you to view a source clip (clips to be used in the program) and the 
program material (the clips already placed in sequence in the Timeline window) at
the same time. Before you use more sophisticated editing techniques, you should

become familiar with the two sections of the Monitor window in Dual View mode.
Beneath the source clip monitor (left side) is the source controller, which enables
you to play source clips that haven’t been added to the Timeline. The In and Out
point icons enable you to set in and out points of source clips.
Beneath the program or sequence side (right side) is the program controller, which
enables you to play the program that exists on the Timeline. Clicking the In and 
Out point icons in the Program View changes the in and out points of the sequence
already on the Timeline. You use the sequence In and Out point icons when perform-
ing lift and extract edits, which remove footage from the current sequence, and when
you create three-point edits (covered in Chapter 13).
Figure 7-4: The Monitor window in Trim View.
Trimming clips in the Monitor window
Before placing clips in the Timeline, you may want to first trim them (set the in and
out points) in the Monitor window, since captured clips invariably contain more
footage than needed. If you trim a clip before placing it in the Timeline, you’ll proba-
bly find that you save time that would otherwise be spent clicking and dragging clip
edges in the Timeline. Here are the steps for setting the in and out points of a clip in
the Monitor window:
1. To display the Monitor window, double-click a clip in the Project window.
Double-clicking video footage in the Project window displays the clip so that
both video and audio can be edited. If you double-click the clip’s video track
in the Timeline window, only the video portion appears in the Clip window. If
you double-click the audio track of the clip, Premiere Pro displays only the
audio part, allowing you to edit only audio.

115
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
When the Clip window appears in the Monitor window, you can use the controls
shown in Figure 7-1 to view the clip. It’s a good idea to view the clip before you
edit it. 
2. Click the Play button to play the entire clip (play the clip continuously by
clicking the Loop button). When you find a section you want to edit, you can
stop it by clicking the Stop button. When you stop the clip, look at the time
readout to see at which frame you have stopped. This can help you when set-
ting in and out points and when setting markers.
3. To precisely access the frame that you want to set as your in point, start 
by clicking and dragging the blue triangle current-time indicator (CTI) 
over the ruler area in the Monitor window. If you don’t stop at the correct
frame, you can use the Step forward and Step backward buttons to slowly
move one frame at a time forward or backwards. You can also click and drag
the shuttle (refer to Figure 7-3) or the jog tread area to move back and forth
through your clip.
You can jump to a specific frame in a clip by double-clicking over the Location
Time display in the bottom-left corner of the monitor display and typing a specific
timecode position. You do not need to type colons or semi-colons.
4. When you reach the in point, click the Set In point button. A left brace
appears in the ruler area.
5. Now locate the frame that you want to set as the out point and click the Set
Out button. A right brace now appears in the ruler area. After you set the in
and out points, you can easily edit their positions by simply clicking and drag-
ging on one of the brace icons. After you’ve set the in and out points, note the
Time display with the delta symbol in front of it. This number indicates the
duration from the in point to the out point.
After you’ve edited a clip in the Monitor window, you can drag it to the Timeline
from the Project window. Later in the chapter, you’ll see how to use the Monitor
window to add the clip to the Timeline.
If you edit a clip in the Monitor window that is already on the Timeline, you’ll see
the sequence shrink or grow, depending whether you’ve shaved frames or added
frames to the in and out points.
Choosing clips in the Monitor window
Once you start working with clips in the Monitor window, you can easily return to
previously used clips. When you first work with a clip in the Monitor window, the
clip’s name appears at the top of the source section of the window. If you want to
return to a clip that you previously used in the Monitor window, simply click the
clip’s name in the Monitor window. This opens a drop-down menu in which you can
pick previously used clips. After you choose the clip in the drop-down menu, it
appears in the source section of the Monitor window.
Note

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
“Taking” audio and/or video
When working with clips in the source section of the Monitor window, you can eas-
ily instruct Premiere Pro to use both the clip’s audio and video when editing audio
only or video only. If the clip that you are editing in the Monitor window includes
both video and audio, you can use the Take Audio and Video button to take audio
only or video only. If you want to edit using only a clip’s video, click the Toggle Take
Audio and Video icon in the Monitor window (refer to Figure 7-3) until it changes 
to the Take Video icon. If you want to edit using only audio from the clip, click the
Toggle Take Audio and Video icon until the take Audio icon appears. When you per-
form an insert or overlay edit, Premiere Pro will create the edit using the audio and
video, the video only, or the audio only option, depending on the setting of the
Toggle Audio and Video icons.
Editing in the Timeline
As discussed in Chapter 3, Premiere Pro’s Timeline provides a graphical representa-
tion of your project. By simply analyzing the clip’s effects and transitions in the
Timeline, you can get a visual sense of how it is edited without actually viewing 
the footage. Premiere provides a variety of ways of placing clips into the Timeline:
✦Click and drag the clip or image from the Project window into the Timeline.
✦Select the clip in the Project window, then choose Clip ➪Insert or Clip ➪
Overlay. The clip is inserted into the target track at the current Timeline 
location.
✦Double-click the clip in the Project window to open it in the Monitor window,
then click the Insert or Overlay buttons in the Monitor window.
✦If you want to place multiple clips in the Timeline to create a rough cut of your
work, you can use the Automate to Sequence command described in the next
section.
To make a track the target track, click in the track’s header area.
Automate to Sequence
Premiere Pro’s Automate to Sequence command provides a fast way to assemble a
project on the Timeline. You might view this command as an efficient means of cre-
ating a quick rough cut. Automate to Sequence not only places clips in the Timeline,
but it also can add a default transition between clips as well. If the clips in the Project
window contain a lot of footage that you will not need, your best bet is to trim the
clips in the Monitor window by executing Automate to Sequence. Here are the steps
for using Automate to Sequence:
Note

117
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
1. Select the clips in the Project window that you want to place in the Timeline.
To select a group of adjacent clips, click on the first clip you want to have in
the sequence, then press Shift. While holding Shift, click on the last clip you
want in the sequence.
To select non-adjacent clips, Ctrl+click on different clips in the Project window.
2. To add the selected clips to the Timeline, choose Project ➪Automate to
Sequence, or click the Automate to Sequence button in the Project window.
This opens the Automate to Sequence dialog box, shown in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: Use Automate to Sequence
to create a rough edit.
3. In the Automate to Sequence dialog box, choose the options to control how
the clips are placed on the Timeline. Here is a review of the choices:
• Ordering. Allows you to choose to have the clips placed in their sorted
order in the Project window or according to how they were selected in
the Project window.
• Placement. Choose to have the clips ordered in their project sequence
or at each unnumbered Marker in the Timeline. If you choose the
Unnumbered Marker option, Premiere Pro disables the Transitions
option in the dialog box.
• Method. Allows you to choose Insert or Overlay edit. If you choose
Insert, clips are added to the Timelime; if you choose Overlay, clips from
the Project window replace clips in the Timeline.
• Clip Overlap. Allows you to specify how many seconds or frames are
used as overlapping frames for the default transition.
Tip

118
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
• Apply Default Audio/VideoTransition. Applies the currently set default
transition between clips.
• Ignore Audio. If this option is selected, Premiere Pro doesn’t place the
audio linked to clips.
• Ignore Video. If this option is selected, Premiere Pro doesn’t place the
video in the Timeline.
4. To execute the Automate to Sequence command, click OK.
Selecting and moving clips in the Timeline
After you’ve placed clips in the Timeline, you’ll often need to reposition them as
part of the editing process. You can choose to move one clip at a time, or you can
move several clips at the same time. (You can also move either the video or audio
of a clip independently. To do this you need to temporarily unlink the clip.)
Using the Selection tool
The simplest way to move a single clip is to click it with the Selection tool and
move it within the Timeline window. If you want the clip you move to snap to
the edge of another clip, make sure the Snap to Edges command is selected. Choose
either Sequence ➪Snap or click the Snap icon (a magnet) in the upper-left corner of
the Timeline window. Here is a description of how to select clips, tracks, and multiple
clips using Premiere Pro’s Selection tool. After a clip or clips are selected, you can
move them by clicking and dragging or delete them from the Timeline by pressing
Delete.
✦To select a clip, activate the Selection tool, and click on the clip.
✦To select more than one clip, press Shift and then click on the clips that you
want to select. Alternatively, you can also click and drag to create a marquee
selection around the clips that you want to select. After you release the mouse,
the clips within the marquee are selected. You can also use this technique to
select clips that are on different tracks.
✦If you want to select the video without the audio portion of a clip, or the audio
without the video, Alt+click the video or audio track.
✦To add or subtract a clip or a selection of clips to or from a selection, press
Shift and then click and drag a marquee selection around the clip or clips. 
Using the Track Select tool
If you want to quickly select several clips on a track or to delete clips on a
track, use the Track Select tool. The Track Select tool does not select all clips
on the track. It selects all clips from the point at which you click. Thus, if you’ve
placed four clips on the Timeline and want to select the last two, click on the third
clip. Figure 7-6 shows clips selected with the Track Select tool.

119
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
Figure 7-6: Clips selected with the Track Select tool.
If you want to quickly select multiple clips on different Timeline tracks, press Shift
while you click in a track with the Track select tool. This selects all clips on all tracks
starting at the point you first click.
Grouping clips
If you know you’ll need to select and reselect the same clips again and again, you
should place them in a group. After you’ve created a group of clips, you can select
every member of the group by clicking on any group member. You can also delete
all clips in a group by selecting any member of the group and pressing Delete.
To create a group of clips, start by selecting the clips and then choose Clip ➪Group.
To ungroup the clips, choose Clip ➪Ungroup.
If you move a clip on the Timeline that is linked to another clip — such as a video
clip that is linked to its audio clip — the linked clips move together.

120
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Setting In and Out Points 
in the Timeline Window
Once you’re familiar with the how to select clips in the Timeline, you can easily 
perform edits. You can edit by either using the Selection tool or setting in and out
points using Markers.
Using the Selection tool to set in and out points
One of the simplest ways to edit in the Timeline window is to set in and out points
using the Selection tool. To edit an in or out point with the Selection tool, follow
these steps:
1. Select the Selection tool in the Tools palette.
2. To set a clip’s in point, move the Selection tool over the left edge of the 
clip in the Timeline. The Selection tool changes to an Edge icon.
3. Click and drag the edge of the clip to where you want the clip to start.
4. To set a clip’s out point, move the Selection tool over the right edge of the
clip in the Timeline. The Selection tool changes to an Edge icon.
5. Click and drag the edge of the clip to where you want the clip to end.
Creating insert and overlay edits 
by clicking and dragging
After you learn how to edit clips with the Selection tool, you can begin assembling 
a project into a production. As you work, you can use a few simple procedures to
streamline the editing process as you add clips to the Timeline. For instance, you
can overlay or insert one clip between the frames of other clips by simply clicking
and dragging. When you create an overlay edit, you replace old footage with new
footage; when you insert, the new footage is added to the Timeline, but no footage
is removed.
For example, assume that you have a clip of a galloping horse in the Timeline. You
want to place a three-second close-up of the jockey on the horse into the clip. If you
perform an insert edit, the clip is split at the Timeline edit location, and the jockey
is inserted into the clip. The entire Timeline sequence is three seconds longer. If
you perform an overlay edit, on the other hand, the three-second-jockey footage
replaces three seconds of horse footage. An overlay enables you to continue using
the audio track that is linked to the galloping horse clip, providing more consistent
continuity in the final video.

121
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
To create an overlay edit on the Timeline, click and drag a clip from the
Project window over a clip in the Timeline. As you move one clip over the
other, the mouse pointer changes to an Overlay icon. When you release the mouse,
Premiere Pro places one clip over the other and removes the underlying video.
Figure 7-7 shows the Timeline before and after an overlay edit.
Figure 7-7: Sequence in Timeline window before and 
after an overlay edit.
Adding Sequence Markers
You can add numerical markers to a clip and use them as visual landmarks on the Timeline
that you want to quickly return to later. These are especially useful with longer projects.
To add a marker, move the Sequence Marker icon in the Timeline window to where you
want to add a marker and then choose Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪Next Available
Numbered.
You can jump to a marker by choosing Marker ➪Go To Sequence Marker ➪Next or Marker ➪
Go To Sequence Marker ➪Numbered.

122
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
To create an insert edit, press and hold Ctrl and then click and drag a clip
from the Project window over a clip in the Timeline. As you move one clip
over the other, the mouse pointer changes to an Insert icon. When you release the
mouse (make sure Ctrl is still pressed), Premiere Pro inserts the new clip in the
Timeline and pushes the footage at the insert point to the right. Figure 7-8 shows
the Timeline before and after an insert edit.
Figure 7-8: Sequence in Timeline window before and 
after an insert edit.
Inserting and overlaying using the Monitor window
Although you can create insert and overlay edits while dragging clips to the Timeline,
performing these edits in the Monitor window ensures better precision. When you
perform an insert edit, the source clip is inserted into the Timeline at the current-
time indicator. If you perform an overlay edit, the source clip replaces a section of
the sequence at the current-time indicator. When you perform the edit in the Monitor
window, Premiere Pro adds the new edited section to the current sequence in the
Timeline.
The following steps show you how to set the target track for the edit, add a clip to
the source section (left side) of the Monitor window and then perform an insert or
overlay edit:
1. Select the target track in the Timeline window by clicking in the header
area (far left) of the track. 

123
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
If a track is locked, you cannot set it as the target track.
2. Click Dual View from the Monitor window pop-up menu.
3. If you don’t have program material in the current sequence in the Timeline
window, click and drag a clip into the Timeline. This clip appears in the
Program section of the Timeline. Assume that this is part of the program you
are editing and you now want to insert a clip two seconds into it.
4. Use the controls on the program (right side) of the Monitor window to move
to the frame where you want the source clip inserted. You can click the
Frame Forward and Frame Back buttons, or you can use the shuttle or jog
controls.
5. To place a clip in the Source section of the Monitor window, double-click it
in the Project window, or drag a clip from the Project window to the Source
section of the Monitor window. If multiple clips appear in the Source section
of the Monitor window, choose the clip in the drop-down menu in the tab at
the top of the Source section.
To view the clip, click the Play button. To use both the video and audio for the
clip, there should not be a diagonal line through the Take Video and Take Audio
icons. By default, no diagonal line exists. A diagonal line appears only if you
click these icons. If the line is present, simply click the icon to toggle the Take
Audio or Take Video icon off.
If your source clip contains audio and you want to insert or overlay video
only, click the Toggle Take Audio and Video icon until the Take Video icon
appears.
6. In the Source clip section of the Monitor window, click the Frame Forward
and Frame Back buttons to move to the frames that you want to set as the 
in and out points.
7. When you reach the in point, click the Set In point button.
8. Move to the desired out point.
9. Set the out point by clicking the Set Out point button. Now you can perform
an insert or an overlay edit.
10. Perform the insert or overlay edit. To insert the clip at the current-time 
indicator, choose Clip ➪Insert at Edit line, or click the Insert button in the
Monitor window. After you click, the clip in the Timeline is cut at the frame
that you set in the Monitor window. Inserted into the clip is the source clip
whose in and out points you set in the Source window. If you want to overlay
the clip instead of inserting it, choose Clip ➪Overlay at Timeline or click the
Overlay button. After you click, the source clip replaces a section of the
Timeline.
11. To view the final edit, click the Play button in the Monitor window.
Note

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Editing with Sequence Markers
You also can perform basic editing in the currently selected sequence by setting 
in and out points using the Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪In and Marker ➪
Set Sequence Marker ➪Out commands. These commands set in and out points 
for the beginning and end of the Timeline sequence. After you create Sequence
Markers, you can use them as in and out points for lift and extract edits (described
in the next section).
Setting in and out points
Here’s how to set in and out points on the Timeline using menu commands:
1. Click and drag the current-time indicator to where you want to set the
Timeline in point.
2. Choose Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪In. An In point icon appears at the
ruler line on the Timeline at the position of the current-time indicator.
3. Click and drag the current-time indicator to where you want to set the out
point.
4. Choose Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪Out. An Out point icon appears on
the Timeline at the current-time indicator position.
After you create the in and out points, you can easily move them by clicking and
dragging them in the Timeline window.
You can also set in and out points for the current sequence by clicking the Set In
point and Set Out point icons in the Sequence side of the Monitor window. 
Clearing in and out points
After creating Sequence Markers, you can easily clear them with the following menu
commands:
✦To clear both the in and out points and to start all over again, choose 
Marker ➪Clear Sequence Marker ➪In and Out.
✦To clear just the in point, choose Marker ➪Clear Sequence Marker ➪In.
✦To clear just the out point, choose Marker ➪Clear Sequence Marker ➪Out.
Performing lift and extract edits at Sequence Markers
You can use Sequence Markers to easily remove clip segments from the Timeline by
executing the Sequence Lift command or the Sequence Extract command. When you
perform a lift edit, Premiere Pro lifts a segment off the Timeline and leaves a blank
Tip
Note

125
Chapter 7 ✦Basic Editing with the Timeline and Monitor Windows
space where the deleted clip existed. When you perform an extract edit, Premiere
Pro removes a section of the clip and then joins the frames of remaining clip sections
together so no blank area exists.
To perform a lift edit using Sequence Markers, follow these steps:
1. Set in and out Sequence Markers at the section that you want to delete. The
top of Figure 7-9 shows in and out points created with Sequence Markers in
the Timeline window. See the earlier section “Setting in and out points” for
information on creating sequenced in and out points.
2. To perform a lift edit, choose Sequence ➪Lift. Premiere Pro removes the 
section bordered by the in and out markers and leaves a blank area in the
Timeline, as shown at the bottom of Figure 7-9.
Figure 7-9: Sequence in Timeline window before and 
after a lift edit.
To perform an extract edit using Sequence Markers, follow these steps:
1. Set in and out Sequence Markers at the section that you want to delete.

Editing Audio
J
ust as a picture is worth a thousand words, sound can 
create a mood that could take a thousand words to
describe. Sound can be used to capture your audience’s atten-
tion. The right background music can create a feeling of
intrigue, comedy, or mystery. Sound effects can add realism
and suspense to the visual elements that you present.
Undoubtedly, the success of many of the best video produc-
tions and movies is related to the sound underlying the video.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro provides a wealth of features that
enable you to integrate sound into your video projects. When
you place a clip in the Timeline, Premiere Pro automatically
takes the sound along with it. If you want to fade in or fade out
background music or narration, Premiere Pro’s Effect Controls
window provides the tools. If you want to add an audio effect
that enhances an audio clip or add a special effect, you can
simply drag it from the Effects window to the clip. If you want
to mix audio into a master track, Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer
will do the job.
This chapter focuses on audio track basics. It provides a look
at how to use Premiere Pro’s audio tracks and how to create
effects in the Timeline window. The chapter also includes an
overview of Premiere Pro’s many audio effects and concludes
with a look at how to export audio. 
Chapter 9 covers creating audio effects and mixing tracks
with the Audio Mixer.
What Is Sound?
Before you begin to use Premiere Pro’s audio features, it’s
helpful to have a fundamental idea of what sound is and the
terms used to describe it. It will help you to understand exactly
what type of sound you’re working with and its quality. Terms
such as sample rate of 32,000 Hz and bit rate of 16 appear in
the custom settings dialog boxes, Export dialog boxes, and in
the Project window, as shown in Figure 8-1.

Figure 8-1: Audio information shown in
Project window.
To understand digital sound, it’s best to start in the real world where a sound such
as someone beating on a drum or playing a musical instrument in a concert hall
travels to us through waves. We hear sounds because of the vibrations the waves
create. The speed of the vibration, or sound frequency, is measured in hertz (Hz).
Humans can generally hear within a range from 20 Hz to about 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). 
The size of sound wave curve or its amplitude is measured in decibels. The greater
the curve, the greater its amplitude and the louder the sound. 
When sound is digitized, thousands of numbers represent amplitude, or height and
depth of waves. In digital sound, the frequency of the digital waves is called the sam-
ple rate. When you load Premiere Pro, you’ll see the sample rate of 32 kHz. Thus,
every second, 32,000 samples are created to make a sound. When a sample is digi-
tized, it is created by a series of 1s and 0s, or bits. Higher quality digital recording
uses more bits. CD-quality stereo uses 16 bits. Thus, one sample of CD quality sound
could be digitized into a series of 1s and 0s to look like this:
1011011011101010
Older digital video software typically used 8-bit sound rates, which provided poorer
quality sound, yet produced smaller digital sound files. 
Timeline Audio Tracks
Premiere Pro’s Timeline window audio tracks provide a bird’s eye view of the sound
that accompanies your video. As you can see from Figure 8-2, the audio tracks are
grouped together beneath the video tracks. You can drag separate tracks to the
audio tracks, click and drag to move them, and use the Razor tool to slice audio. 
When you place a video clip into the Timeline that includes an audio track, Premiere
Pro places it into the corresponding track automatically. Thus, if you place a video
clip with audio in Video track 1, the audio is automatically placed in Audio track 1.
If you slice a video clip with the Razor tool, the audio is sliced along with it.
As discussed in Chapter 6, you can expand and compress audio tracks by clicking
the Collapse/Expand icon. Once the track is expanded, you can choose from the fol-
lowing display options:
Audio sample rate and bit rate

Figure 8-3: Choices from the Keyframes pop-up menu.
As you work with audio in Premiere Pro, you’ll encounter different types of audio
tracks. The Standard audio track allows for either Mono or Stereo (two-channel
sound). The other tracks available include the following:

130
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
✦Master track. Displays keyframes and volume for the Master track. You can mix
sound from other tracks onto the Master track using Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer.
✦Submix tracks. These are mixed tracks used by the Audio Mixer to mix a 
subset of all audio tracks.
✦5.1 track. 5.1 tracks are used in Dolby’s Surround Sound. 5.1 tracks are used
often for DVD movies in surround sound. In 5.1 sound, the left, right, and cen-
ter channels are in front of the audience, with ambient sounds produced from
two speakers behind. This is a total of five channels; the extra .1 channel is a
subwoofer that produces sudden explosive-type sounds.
Playing a Sound Clip
After you import a sound clip using Premiere Pro’s standard Import command, you
can play it in the Project window or Monitor window.
The DVD-ROM includes practice sound clips from Digital Vision’s royalty-free CD
Acoustic Chillout. The filename of the sound clip used in this chapter is
730009aw.wav. We renamed it citysounds to keep our files organized. You can
locate the sound clip in the Chapter 8 folder on the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible
DVD-ROM. You can also use the audio clip used in Chapter 1 (705001.aif from
Digital Visions NightMoves CD).
Here are the steps:
1. Choose File ➪Import ➪File to import a sound file into your new project. 
2. At this point, you can play the clip in the Project window by clicking the Play
button, as shown in Figure 8-4. Alternatively, you can double-click the sound
file in the Project window. The clip opens in the clip (source) section of the
Monitor window,
3. If you opened the clip in the Monitor window, click the Play button in the
clip (source) section of the Monitor window.

Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
Using Audio Units
As you edit in the Monitor window, the standard unit of measurement is the video
frame. This is perfect for editing video where you can precisely set the in or out point
on a frame-by-frame basis. However, with audio, you may need more precision. For
example you may want to edit out an extraneous sound that is less than a frame long.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro can display audio time in audio “units” as opposed to
frames. You can view audio units in milliseconds or the smallest possible increment—
the audio sample. To view audio units and an audio clip’s waveform, place a video
clip with audio or an audio clip in the Timeline and follow these step:
1. Click the Collapse/Expand button (the triangle in front of the phrase Audio 1)
to expand the audio track.
2. Click the Set Display Style icon and choose Show Waveform.
3. Change units to audio samples by choosing Audio Units in the Timeline
menu. This changes the Timeline ruler display to audio units as either audio
samples or milliseconds. (The default setting is audio samples; however, this
can be changed by choosing Project ➪Project Settings and choosing
Milliseconds in the Audio Section Display Format drop-down menu.)
To edit the audio, follow these steps:
1. Zoom in by clicking and dragging toward the right on the Timeline zoom
slider. Figure 8-5 shows the ruler with audio units in view. Note that the time
readout is shown in audio samples, and notice in the audio track how much
audio exists between two adjacent video frames. 
Figure 8-5: Audio units shown in Timeline and in Time display.

132
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
2. Click and drag either clip edge to change in and out points. Or you can edit
by activating the Razor tool in the Tool palette and clicking to slice the audio
at a specific point.
Unlinking audio and editing it in the Monitor window
If you place a clip with audio in the Timeline, you can edit its audio separately from
the video. To do this, you first need to unlink the audio from the video; then you can
edit audio in and out points separate from the video. You can even view the audio
waveform in the Monitor window and edit it there. Here are the steps:
1. Select the clip in the Timeline.
2. Unlink the clip by choosing Clip ➪Unlink Audio and Video.
3. Deselect the audio and video tracks by clicking in an empty Timeline track.
4. Double-click the audio portion of the clip. The audio opens in the left section
of the Monitor window. Here you can view an enlarged image of the waveform,
as shown in Figure 8-6.
5. Change the time display from frames to audio units by choosing Audio Units
in the menu of the left section of the Monitor window. (Open this menu by
clicking the small triangle in the upper-right corner of the left section of the
Monitor window.) 
Figure 8-6: Audio in and out points set in the Monitor window.

Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
6. To set in and out points, move the current-time indicator to in the left side
of the Monitor window to the in point. As you drag the current-time indica-
tor, you’ll hear the audio. Click the Set In point button. Move the current-time
indicator to the out point and click the Set Out point button. The audio in the
current sequence in the Timeline window now reflects the new in and out
points for the audio. Figure 8-6 shows an audio clip in the left section of the
Monitor window with its in and out points changed.
If the display in the left side of the Monitor window is set to Audio Units, use the
Step Back or Step Forward button (or press the left or right arrow key) to step
through the audio one audio unit at a time.
7. To avoid confusion, you may want to rename the unlinked audio clip. To do
this, select it, choose Clip ➪Rename and enter a new name in the Rename Clip
dialog box.
Gaining, Fading, and Balancing
One of the most common sound effects is to slowly fade in sound at the beginning
of a clip and fade out the sound at the end. You can do this by setting keyframes on
the keyframe line that appears when you choose Show Clip Volume the audio tracks
show display pop-up menu. You can also change the balance of a sound in a stereo
channel. When you balance, you remove a percentage of the sound information from
one channel and add it to the other. This is called panning. You can change the entire
volume of a sound clip by using Premiere Pro’s Gain command. The following sec-
tions show you how to adjust audio gain, fade audio in and out, and balance stereo
channels.
Adjusting sound volume using the Gain command
The Gain command enables you to change the sound level of the entire clip by rais-
ing or lowering audio gain in decibels. Generally in audio recording, engineers raise
or lower gain during recording. If sound levels dip, the engineer “riding the gain”
raises the gain; if the levels go too high, he or she can lower the gain. Here’s how to
use the Premiere Pro Gain command, which adjusts the uniform volume of the clip:
1. Choose File ➪Import to import a sound clip or a video clip with sound.
2. Click the clip in the Project window or drag the sound clip from the Project
window to an audio track in the Timeline window.
3. If the clip is in the Timeline, click the sound clip in the audio track in the
Timeline window.
4. Choose Clip ➪Audio Options ➪Audio Gain. The Clip Gain dialog box appears
(see Figure 8-7). 
Tip

134
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Figure 8-7: Use the Clip Gain dialog box to adjust
audio gain for an entire clip.
5. Type a value in the field in the Clip Gain dialog box. The 0 setting is the
original clip volume in decibels. A number greater than 0 increases the sound
volume of the clip. A number less than 0 decreases the sound volume. If you
click Normalize, Premiere Pro sets the maximum gain possible without audio
clipping. Clipping occurs when an audio signal is too high, and it can result in
distortion.
Click and drag the mouse over the dB value in the Clip Gain dialog box to increase
or decrease audio gain. Clicking and dragging right increases the dB value; clicking
and dragging left decreases it.
Fading track sound 
Premiere Pro provides a variety of options for fading in or out a clip’s volume. You
can fade a clip in or out and change its volume using the Volume audio effect in the
Effect Controls window, or you can fade a clip in or out by applying a crossfade
transition from the Effects window to the in or out point of a clip. As shown in the
following steps, you can also change volume using the Pen tool to create keyframes
in the Timeline. After the keyframes are set, you can adjust volume by clicking and
dragging on the keyframe graph line. 
When you fade sound in a track, you can choose to fade the entire track or a clip’s
volume. In this section, you’ll fade track volume:
1. Choose File ➪Import ➪File to import a sound clip or a video clip with
sound.
2. Drag the sound clip from the Project window to an audio track in the
Timeline window.
3. Expand the audio track and choose Show Track Volume from the Show
Keyframes drop-down menu (refer Figure 8-3). A yellow graph line now
appears in the middle of the audio track. 
You can also choose Show Clip Keyframes or Show Volume Keyframes from the
Show Keyframes drop-down menu. This causes a Volume drop-down menu to
appear in the Track. If you are changing Clip Volume, click the Volume drop-down
menu and choose Level.
4. If the Tool palette is not open, open it by choosing Window ➪Show Tools.
Note

135
Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
5. Select the Pen tool.
6. Set the current-time indicator to the Timeline location where you want the
fade to end.
7. Move the Pen tool the point where you want the fade to end; then press
Ctrl+click in the graph line to create a keyframe. This keyframe icon serves
as a placeholder for the sound to stay at 100 percent of its volume at the mid-
dle of the sound clip. 
8. Move the Pen tool to the beginning of the clip, and create another handle
there by Ctrl+clicking.
9. Drag the handle at the beginning of the graph line downward. This makes
the audio clip fade in. Dragging it upward increases the sound. As you click
and drag, a tiny readout shows the current Timeline position and the change
in decibels. Figure 8-8 shows the Timeline with the adjusted volume
keyframes.
Figure 8-8: Audio fade is created with keyframes.
10. To create a fade out, repeat the preceding steps to create a keyframe at the
end of the clip and a few seconds before the end of the clip. Drag the
keyframe at the end of the graph line downward to make the audio clip
fade out.
If desired, you can use the Pen tool to add more keyframes to the graph lines.
Adding more keyframes to the graph line enables you to fade a sound clip in
different sections within the clip. 
11. To play the sound clip, press the spacebar on your keyboard.
You can adjust overall volume for a clip or a track by clicking and dragging a track’s
volume graph line up or down with the Pen tool. 
Note

136
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Removing keyframes
As you edit  audio in the Timeline, you may want to remove keyframes. The easiest
way to do so is to have Premiere Pro jump to the specific keyframe and then click
the Add/Remove Keyframe button in the Timeline. Here’s how to remove a keyframe
from an audio track in a sequence:
1. Move the current-timeline indicator in front of the keyframe that you want
to remove.
2. Click the Go to Next Keyframe button.
3. Click the Add/Remove keyframe button. The keyframe is removed. 
Balancing stereo in the Timeline
Premiere Pro enables you to adjust stereo channel balance in a stereo track. When
you balance a stereo track, you redistribute the sound from one track to another.
Although balancing is also covered in Chapter 9, we include it here because you 
can accomplish it simply in the Timeline window.
Here’s how to balance a stereo track:
1. Expand the audio track if it isn’t already expanded.
2. Choose Show Track Keyframes from the Show Keyframes drop-down menu
at the head of the track. The Keyframe graph line appears as does an L and R,
indicating the left and right tracks. A Volume drop-down menu also appears in
the track.
3. In the Volume drop-down menu, choose Panner. In the Panner drop-down
menu, choose Balance, as shown in Figure 8-9.
4. Select the Pen tool in the Tool palette.

5. To adjust stereo levels, click and drag with the Pen tool on the track
keyframe graph line. If you want to set keyframes, Ctrl+click and drag with
the Pen tool to adjust the balance.
Creating Transitions Using Audio Effects 
Premiere Pro’s Audio Effects folder in the Effects window provides audio effects and
audio transitions that enable you to enhance and correct audio. The effects provided
in the Audio Effects folder are similar to many found in professional audio studios.
To display the Effects window, as shown in Figure 8-10, choose Window ➪Effects.
When the Effects window opens, note that it includes folders for Mono, Stereo, 
and 5.1 tracks. In addition, note that the Audio Effects folder also includes audio
transitions.
Figure 8-10: The Effects window includes 
audio transitions and audio effects.

138
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Creating bins in the Effects window
To view the effects in each folder, click the triangle in front of the folder. 
In a project, you may need to use a few effects that are in different folders again and
again. If so, you may want to place the effects into one folder. To create a new folder,
choose New Custom Bin from the Audio palette pop-up menu. You can also click the
New Custom Bin folder icon at the bottom of the Effects window. When the New
Folder dialog box appears, Premiere Pro conveniently names it “Favorites” for you.
If you want to rename it, simply click on Favorites and change the folder’s name. To
populate the folder with effects, simply click and drag your favorite effects into the
folder. Premiere Pro puts a copy of the effect into the new folder.
If you want to delete the folder or an effect within the folder, simply click it and
then click the Trash icon at the bottom of the folder.
Applying audio transitions
The Effects window’s Audio Transitions folder provides two crossfade effects that
allow you to fade in and fade out audio. Premiere Pro provides two varieties of 
transitions: Constant Gain and Constant Power. Constant Power, the default audio
transition, produces an effect that should sound like a gradual fading in and out to
the human ear. Constant Gain produces a mathematical fade in and fade out.
Typically, crossfades are applied to create a smooth transition between two audio
clips. However, when using Premiere Pro, you can place a crossfade transition at
the front of an audio clip to create a fade in, or at the tail end of the audio clip to
create a fade out. 
Here are the steps for creating an audio transition:
1. Place two audio clips so that they are next to each other on the Timeline.
2. Open the Effects palette by choosing Window ➪Effects.
3. Open the Transitions folder by clicking the small triangle to the left of the
folder.
4. Open the Crossfade folder by clicking small triangle to the left of the folder.
5. Drag the crossfade and drop it between the two clips in the audio track. Don’t
worry if the transition does not drop directly over the middle of the two clips.
You’ll see the transition icon in the Timeline.
6. Open the Effect Controls window by choosing Window ➪Effect Controls.
7. To center the transition between the two clips, choose Center at Cut from
the Alignment drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 8-11.

139
Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
Figure 8-11: The Crossfade transition with Alignment set

8. To change the duration of the transition, click and drag either end of the
transition icon or edit the time display in the Effect Controls window.
The default audio transition duration can be set by altering the Default Audio
Transition Duration setting found in the General Preferences dialog box. Choose
Edit ➪Preferences ➪General.
9. To play the transition, in the Effect Controls window set the current-time
indicator before the transition and press the spacebar.
You can quickly open the Effect Controls window by double-clicking a transition in
the Timeline.
Using the default audio transition
If you know that you will be using the same audio transition again and again, you can
easily apply it using Premiere Pro’s Apply Audio Transition command. Here’s how:
1. Place two audio clips so that they are next to each other on the Timeline.
2. Choose Sequence ➪Apply Audio Transition.
Fading in and out using a crossfade transition
Earlier in this chapter, you saw how to manually create a fade in and fade out effect
using keyframes in the Timeline. You can also create a fade in or fade out by using a
crossfade transition. Here’s how to create a fade-in using a crossfade transition:
1. Drag a Crossfade transition to the front of the in point of the audio clip.
2. In the Effect Controls window, choose Start at Cut from the Alignment 
pop-up menu.

Here’s how to create a fade out using a crossover transition:
1. Drag a Crossfade transition to the back of the out point of the audio clip.
2. In the Effect Controls window, choose End at Cut from the Alignment 
drop-down menu.
Applying an audio effect
Like transitions, you access audio effects from the Effects palette, and they are 
controlled by the Effect Controls window. To display the Effect Controls window,
shown in Figure 8-12, choose Window ➪Show Effect Controls.
To apply an audio effect to audio clip, follow these steps:
1. Select the clip in the Timeline window. If the clip is linked to video, unlink
it by choosing Clip ➪Unlink Audio Video. 
2. Select the effect in the Effects palette and either drag it into the Effects
Control palette or drag it over the audio track in the Timeline and let go 
of the mouse.

Most audio effects provide settings that allow you to adjust the effect. If an audio
effect provides settings that can be adjusted, the settings appear in the Effect
Controls window when the effect is expanded. To expand/collapse the effect, click
the triangle in front of the effect’s name.
You can adjust the effect in the Effect Controls window either by moving the sliders
in the palette or by entering a value into a control’s field. In Figure 8-12, the slider
allows you to change the decibel level for the Volume effect. The palette also fea-
tures a Play button, enabling you to play the sound.
You delete an effect from the Effects palette by right-clicking its name and choosing
Clear from the pop-up menu. You can also click the effect in the Effect Controls win-
dow and then click the Trash icon at the bottom of the palette. If you want to pre-
vent an effect from playing, essentially turning it off, then click the f button next to
the effect’s name. To turn the effect back on, click the f again.
Audio effects can also be applied to audio tracks from Premiere Pro’s Audio
Mixer window. See Chapter 9 for details.
Applying an audio effect over time
If you want to change the settings of an effect as an audio clip plays, you need to
apply an effect over time and set keyframes where you want to make a change. A
keyframe stores the effect at a specific point on a line in the Timeline in the Effect
Controls window. To apply an audio effect over time, you should have a project
open containing an audio clip in an audio track. Then follow these steps:
1. Choose Window ➪Show Effect Controls to display the Effect Controls window.
By default, Volume always appears as an effect in the Effect Controls window. It
cannot be removed from the palette.
2. Select the clip in the Timeline to which you want to apply the effect.
3. Drag an audio effect from the folder corresponding to the selected video
track to the Effect Controls window or drop the effect over the clip.
4. Turn on keyframe mode by clicking the Stopwatch icon. The Add/Delete
Keyframe button appears in the Effect Controls window. 
5. Now click and drag the current-time indicator in the Effect Controls window
to a new position.
6. Adjust a setting for the effect in the Effect Controls window. This creates a
keyframe. 
7. If needed, repeat the previous step to create new keyframes. Figure 8-13
shows the Timeline in the Effect Controls window with various keyframes.

Premiere Pro’s audio effects
The following sections provide a review of Premiere Pro’s audio effects. Since many
effects from the  Stereo folder also reside in the Mono and 5.1 folders, our audio
effects overview is based on the contents of the Stereo folder. As you read through
the overview of each effect, try them out. Remember, after you apply an audio
effect, you can listen to it by clicking the Play button n the Effect Controls window. 
Premiere Pro’s audio effects conform to the Steinberg VST (Virtual Studio
Technology) plug-in standard. This means that third-party VST audio effects can be
applied from within Premiere Pro. They will also appear in the Effects window with
other plug-ins.
Balance
Balance changes the volume of the left and right stereo channels in a stereo clip. A
positive number adds to the right channel and subtracts from the left. Negative val-
ues subtract from the right channel and add volume to the left. The controls for
Balance are shown in Figure 8-14.

Bandpass
Use the Bandpass filter to remove frequencies beyond a frequency band. The
Center field indicates the center of the frequency band to keep. The Q settings indi-
cate the frequency band range you want to preserve. To create a wide range of fre-
quencies to preserve, use a low setting; to preserve a narrow band of frequencies,
use a high setting.
Bass
Use the Bass filter to adjust lower frequencies (200 Hz and below). Use the Boost
option to raise or lower decibels.
Channel Volume
Use the Channel Volume effect to adjust channel volume in stereo or 5.1 clips or
tracks. Unlike Balance, Channel Volume adjusts channels independently of other
channels.
DeNoiser
Use the DeNoiser effect to automatically remove noise from analog audio. Figure 8-15
shows the DeNoiser audio effect controls. In the Custom Setup area, you can click
and drag on the knob icons to adjust the effect. To set keyframes, use the Individual
Parameters section.
✦Noisefloor. This setting indicates the noise floor in decibels when the clip plays.
✦Freeze. Click Freeze to halt the Noisefloor readout at its current decibel level. 
✦Reduction. Click and drag to indicate how much noise to remove. The range 
is –20 to 0 dB.
✦Offset. This control sets an offset value or range for denoising between the
Noisefloor and the values from –10 and +10 dB.

Delay
Use Delay to create an echo effect that occurs after the time entered in the Delay
field. Feedback is a percentage of the audio that is popped back into the delay. Use
the Feedback option to create a series of delaying echoes. Use the Mix option to
specify how much echo occurs in the effect.
Dynamics
The Dynamics effect provides a diverse set of options that can be used to adjust
audio (see Figure 8-16).
✦Gate. Shuts the gate on unwanted audio signals. This control removes the
unwanted signal when its level drops below the dB setting for the Threshold
control. When the signal goes beyond the Threshold, the Attack option deter-
mines the time interval for the gate to open. If the signal goes beyond the
Threshold, the Release option determines the time interval for the gate to
close. When the signal drops below the Threshold, the Hold time determines
how long the gate stays open.
✦Compressor. Attempts to balance the clip’s dynamic range by boosting soft
sound levels and decreasing loud sound levels (dynamic range is the range
from the highest level to the lowest level).

145
Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
✦Expander. Produces a subtle Gate effect by dropping signals that are below the
Threshold setting to the Ratio setting. A ratio setting of 2:1 would expand the
decrease from 1 dB to 2 dB. 
✦Limiter. Allows you to level out audio peaks to reduce clipping. Use the
Threshold option to adjust the maximum signal level. Use the Release Time to
set the time necessary for gain to drop to its normal level after clipping.
✦SoftClip. Like Limiter, SoftClip also reduces clipping when signals peak.
Figure 8-16: The Dynamics audio effect controls.
EQ
EQ effects cut or boost specific frequency ranges. The EQ effect serves as a para-
metric equalizer. Thus, it controls frequency, bandwidth, and level using three
bands: low, middle, and high. Figure 8-17 shows the EQ audio effect controls. Here is
a summary of the controls:
✦Frequency. Use to increase or decrease frequency between 20 and 2000 Hz.
✦Gain. Adjusts the gain between –20 and 20 dB.
✦Cut. Switches the low and high bands from a shelving filter that can boost or
lower part of a signal to a cutoff filter, which excludes or cuts offs the signal at
specified frequencies.
✦Q. Use to specify filter width between 0.05 and 5.0 octaves.

Figure 8-17: EQ effect controls.
Fill Left
Fill Left copies the audio in the right stereo channel and fills the left channel with 
it — replacing the previous audio in the channel.
Fill Right
The Fill Right effect copies the audio in the left channel and fills the right channel
with it — replacing the previous audio in the channel.
Highpass
Use Highpass to remove frequencies above the Cutoff frequency.
Invert
Use Invert to invert the audio phase of each channel.
Lowpass
Use Lowpass to remove frequencies below the Cutoff frequency.
MultibandCompressor
Use the MultibandCompressor (see Figure 8-18) for compressing sounds according
to three bands that correspond to low-mid-high frequencies. Adjust the handles 

147
Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
for controlling gain and frequency range. Use Band Select to select a band and
Crossover Frequency to change the frequency range for the selected band.
MultibandCompressor produces a softer effect than the Dynamics audio effect.
Figure 8-18: The MultibandCompressor audio effect controls.
Multitap Delay
The Multitap Delay Settings dialog box enables you to use four delays or taps (a tap
is a delay effect) to control the overall delay effect. Use Delay 1 through Delay 4
controls to set the time of the delay. To create multiple delaying effects, use the
Feedback 1 through Feedback 4 controls. The feedback controls add a percentage
of the delayed signal back into the delay. Use the mix field to control the percentage
of delayed to non-delayed echo.
Notch
Use the Notch command to remove hum and other extraneous “noises.” Use the
Center control to set the frequency that you want to exclude. Use the Q setting to
control the width of the frequency.

148
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Parametric EQ
Parametric EQ allows you to boost or lower frequency near a specified Center fre-
quency. Use the Center control to set the frequency. Use the Q control to set the
range of frequency that you want to affect. A high setting affects a wide range; a low
setting affects a low range. The Boost control allows you to specify how many deci-
bels you want to boost or lower the frequency range — between –20 and 20 dB.
PitchShifter
As its name suggests, you can use the PitchShifter effect to alter pitch, particularly
when you want to produce a change in voices (see Figure 8-19). Use the Pitch con-
trol to alter pitch in semitones. Fine-tune the effect with the Finetune control.
FormantPreserve prevents high-pitched voices from sounding like cartoon characters
by preventing PitchShifter from altering formants (a formant is a resonant frequency).
Figure 8-19: The PitchShifter Compressor 
audio effect controls.
Reverb
Reverberation refers to sound waves bouncing off an interior space. Reverb effects
are commonly applied to simulate the sound or acoustics of a room. Thus, you 
can use Reverb to add ambience and a sense of humanity to dry electronic sound.
Figure 8-20 shows the Reverb controls. Notice that a pop-up menu allows you to auto-
matically generate settings for specific environments. Note that you can also control
the effect by clicking and dragging the figures in the room area of the effect display.
✦PreDelay. Use this control to simulate the time it takes for sound to hit a wall
and bounce back to the audience.

149
Chapter 8 ✦Editing Audio
✦Absorption. Use to set sound absorption.
✦Size. Use to set room size in percentage — thus, the larger the percentage, the
larger the room.
✦Density. Sets the size or density of the “tail” of the reverberation.
✦Lo Damp. Sets low-frequency dampening.
✦Hi Damp. Sets high-frequency dampening.
✦Mix. Sets how much reverb effect is added to the sound.
Figure 8-20: The Reverb audio effect controls.
Swap Channels
This effect swaps or exchanges left and right channels in stereo tracks.
Treble
Use the Treble effect to adjust higher frequencies (4000 Hz and above). Use the
Boost slider to adjust the effect. Dragging right increases the amount in decibels,
dragging left decreases it.

150
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Volume
Use the Volume effect for clips only when you want to have volume rendered first.
The Volume effect prevents distortion by preventing clipping when you increase
volume. Increase volume with positive values, and decrease volume with negative
values.
Exporting Sound Files
After you’ve edited and refined your audio tracks, you may want to export them as
separate sound files so that they can be used in other software or other Premiere
Pro projects. When you export a sound clip, you can export it in a variety of for-
mats, such as .Windows Waveform (.wav), QuickTime (.mov), Microsoft AVI (.avi),
and Microsoft DV AVI (.avi). Here are the steps for exporting an audio file from
Premiere Pro:
1. Select the audio track with the audio clip you want to export.
2. Choose File ➪Export ➪Audio. The Export Audio dialog box appears.
3. Type a name for your audio file.
4. Click the Settings button.
5. In the Export Audio Settings dialog box, set the File Type drop-down menu
to Windows Waveform, QuickTime, or one of the AVI choices. You can set
the Range drop-down menu to be either the entire sequence or to only the
work area.
6. Click the General drop-down list and choose Audio. In the Audio section,
you can set the Rate (in Hz) and the Format (8-bit or 16-bit, Mono or Stereo). 
7. Click OK to close the dialog box.
8. Click Save to save audio file.

Mixing and
Creating Effects
with the Audio
Mixer
C
reating the perfect blend of music, narration, and effects
is certainly an audio art. The audio engineer who blends
or mixes various tracks together into a master track must have
a deft touch and sensitive ear. Music and narration can’t be
overpowering; sound effects must sound real. Mixing these
together at the perfect sound levels produces audio that truly
enhances the accompanying video.
In a recording studio, engineers use a mixing console to control
the mixing of music tracks. In Premiere Pro, you can create a
mix using its Audio Mixer. Using the Premiere Pro Audio Mixer,
you can mix sound from a maximum of five tracks into a master
track, or you can apply effects to several tracks at once using
a submix track, which can also be routed into the master track.
Like a professional mixer, Premiere Pro allows you to adjust
audio levels, fade in and fade out, balance stereo, control
effects, and create effects “sends.” Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer
also allows you to record audio and isolate and listen to one
“solo” track even while others play. You can even use it to add
and adjust audio effects found in the Effects palette.
This chapter provides a thorough look at the Audio Mixer and
how to use it. After touring the Audio Mixer palette, this chap-
ter covers the Audio Mixer’s Automation settings, which allow
you to adjust audio while it plays. After you learn how to create
a mix, you’ll see how to balance and pan audio, add effects,
and create submixes.

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Audio Mixer Tour
Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer is undoubtedly one of its most complex and versatile
utilities. To use it efficiently, you should become familiar with all of its controls 
and its functionality. If the Audio Mixer isn’t open onscreen, open it by choosing
Window ➪Audio Mixer. If you would like to open the Audio Mixer in Premiere 
Pro’s Audio Workspace, choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Audio. When the Audio
Mixer, shown in Figure 9-1, opens onscreen, it automatically shows at least two
tracks and the master track for the current active sequence. If you have more than
two audio tracks in the sequence, click and drag on the lower-right corner of the
Audio Mixer palette to extend the palette. Although the sight of so many knobs 
and levels probably wouldn’t intimidate an audio engineer, it’s important to under-
stand and slowly examine the buttons and features. Note that the Audio Mixer
offers two major views: the collapsed view (shown in Figure 9-1), which does 
not show the effects area, and the expanded view, which shows effects for the 
different tracks. To switch from one view to another, click the small triangle to the
left of Audio track 1.
The Audio Mixer only shows the current active sequence’s audio tracks. If you
want to show tracks from different sequences in the Audio Mixer window simulta-
neously, you must nest the sequences in the current active sequence. Chapter 6
covers how to nest one sequence into another.
To become familiar with the Audio Mixer, start by examining the track area of the
Audio Mixer. The vertical areas headed by Audio 1, Audio 2, and so on correspond
to the tracks on the active sequence. When you are mixing, you can see audio levels
in the displays in each track column and make adjustments using the controls in
each column. As you make adjustments, the audio is mixed or blended together
into a master track or submix track. Note that the drop-down menu at the bottom of
each track indicates whether the current track signal is being sent to a submix
track or the master track. By default, all tracks are output to the master track as
shown in Figure 9-1.
You can set the master track to be either mono, stereo, or 5.1 by choosing Master
track settings in the Default Sequence Section of the New Project dialog box (you
must first click the Custom Settings tab after creating a new project) or in the New
Sequence dialog box (File ➪New Sequence).
Below the track names are the track Automation options. In Figure 9-1, automation
is set to Read. When the Automation options are set to Read, track adjustment writ-
ten to the tracks with keyframes are read by the track. If you change Read to Write,
keyframes are created in the current sequences audio tracks reflecting adjustments
made in the Audio Mixer.

The following sections discuss the major controls and areas of the Audio Mixer,
including the controls for Automation, Mute/Solo/Record, Pan/Balance, Volume,
and Playback, as well as the Audio Effects menu and the Audio Sends area that
appear in the expanded view (see Figure 9-2, later in this chapter). 
Automation
The Automation options (Off, Read, Latch, Touch, and Write) determine whether
Premiere Pro reads or saves the adjustments you make in the Audio Mixer as
keyframes in the Timeline window. A detailed description of each option is pro-
vided later in this chapter in the section “Mixing Audio.”

The Mute, Solo, and Record buttons
The Mute and Solo buttons below the Automation options enable you to choose
which audio tracks you want to work with and which ones you don’t. The Record
button allows you to record Analog sound (which could be from a microphone
attached to a computer audio input).
✦Click the Mute button to mute or silence tracks that you don’t want to affect
during Audio Mixer playback. When you click Mute, no audio levels are shown
in the Audio Mixer VU (audio level) meter for the track. Using Mute, you can
set levels for multiple tracks without hearing others. For instance, assume
your audio includes music and sound effects of footsteps nearing a pond of
croaking frogs. You could adjust levels of footsteps and frog croaking only as
the video shows the pond coming into view.
✦Click the Solo button to isolate or work with one specific track in the Audio
Mixer window (though you will still be able to hear the other tracks). When
you click Solo, Premiere Pro mutes all other tracks, except the Master track.
✦Click the Record button to record and set levels using the Audio Mixer. Using
the Audio Mixer to capture sound is covered in Chapter 5.
Tracks versus clips
Before you begin working with Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer, it’s important to understand
that the Audio Mixer affects the audio in an entire track. When you work in the Audio Mixer,
you make audio track adjustments, not audio clip adjustments. When you create and alter
effects in the Audio Mixer, you apply audio effects to tracks, not to specific clips. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 8, when you apply effects in the Effects Control window, you apply them
to clips. The current sequence’s Timeline window can provide an overview of your work,
and it’s important not to lose track (no pun intended) of whether clip or track keyframes
are being displayed in the Timeline window. Here’s a review of audio track display options:
✦To view audio adjustments for clips, choose Show Clip Volume or Show Clip
keyframes in the audio track’s Show Keyframes pop-up menu. Note that the
keyframe graph line for a clip extends from the in to the out point of the clip, 
not to the entire track.
✦To view audio adjustments for the entire track, choose Show Track Volume or Show
Track Keyframes in the audio track’s Show Keyframes pop-up menu. The graph line
for keyframes in a track extends throughout the entire track. When you apply audio
effects using the Audio Mixer, these Effects appear by name in a Track pop-up menu
in the Audio track’s graphline. If you choose the effect from the pop-up menu in the
audio track graph line, the keyframes for the effect appear on the graphline.
For both clip and track graph lines, you can create keyframes by Ctrl+clicking with the Pen
tool and make adjustments to keyframe placement by clicking and dragging with the 
Pen tool.

155
Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
To completely turn off output for an audio track, click the Toggle Track Output but-
ton (speaker icon). After you click, the Speaker icon disappears. Click again on the
Toggle Track Output button to turn audio output back on.
The Pan and Balance controls
Panning allows you to control levels of mono tracks when outputting to stereo or
5.1 tracks. Thus, by panning you could increase a sound effect like birds chirping in
the right channel as trees come into view in the right side of your video monitor. 
Balancing allows you redistribute output in Stereo and 5.1 tracks. So, as you add to
the sound level in one channel, you subtract from another, or vice versa. Depending
upon the type of track that you are working with, you control either balance or pan-
ning by using the Pan/Balance knob.
As you pan or balance, you can click and drag over the Pan/Balance knob or click
and drag over the numeric readout below the knob. You can also click the numeric
readout and type a value using your keyboard.
Volume
Dragging the Volume Fader control up or down adjusts track volume. Volume is
recorded in decibels. The decibel volume is displayed in the field below the Volume
Fader control. When the volume of an audio track is changed over time by clicking
and dragging the Volume Fader control, Audio Mixer Automation settings can place
keyframes in the track’s audio graph line in the Timeline window. If you want, you
can further adjust the volume by dragging the keyframes on the graph line in the
track with the Pen tool. Note that when the VU meter (to the left of the Volume Fader)
turns red, it is a warning that clipping or sound distortion may be occurring.
Playback
Six icons appear at the lower-left side of the Audio Mixer window. These icons are
Stop, Play, Loop, Go to In point, Go to Out point, Play In to Out. Click the Play button
to play an audio clip. To work with only a portion of the sequence in the Timeline
window, set in and out points and then jump to the in points by clicking the Go to In
point button. Next, click the Play In to Out button to mix only the audio between your
in and out points. If you click the Loop button, playback is repeated so that you can
continue to fine-tune the audio between the in and out points without starting and
stopping playback.
You can set in and out points in a sequence by clicking the Set In and Set Out point
buttons in the Program section of the Monitor window or by moving the current-
time indicator and choosing Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪In, or Marker ➪Set
Sequence Marker ➪Out. You can also select a clip in the sequence and choose
Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪In and Out around Selection.

Audio Mixer menu
Because the Audio Mixer contains so many icons and controls, you may want to
customize it to display just the controls and features you want to use. Here is a list
of custom settings available in the Audio Mixer menu shown in Figure 9-1.
✦Show/Hide Tracks. Shows or hides individual tracks.
✦Master Meters Only. Displays only master track meters.
✦Meter Input(s) Only. Displays hardware (not track) input levels. To display
hardware input levels on the VU meters (not track levels in Adobe Premiere
Pro), choose Meter Input(s) Only. When this option is on, you can still moni-
tor audio in Adobe Premiere Pro for all tracks that aren’t being recorded.
✦Audio Units. Sets the display to audio units. If you want to display units in
Milliseconds rather than Audio Samples, change this setting in the General tab
of the Project Settings window (Project ➪Project Settings). The Audio setting
changes the time display in the Timeline and Monitor windows as well.
✦Switch to Touch after Write. Automatically switches the Automation mode
from Write to Touch mode after using Write Automation mode.
Effects and Sends options
The following Effects and Sends options appear in the expanded view of the Audio
Mixer, shown in Figure 9-2. To display the effects and sends, click the triangle to the
left of the Automation options drop-down menus. To add an effect or send, click any
of the triangles on the right side of the effects and sends lists. Figure 9-2 shows sev-
eral of these triangles, which appear vertically down the effects and sends portion
of each track.
Choosing Audio Effects
Clicking a triangle in the Audio Effects area allows you to choose an audio effect.
You can place up to five effects in each track’s Effects area. When an effect is loaded,
you can adjust settings for the effect at the bottom of the Effects area. Figure 9-2
shows the Notch and Reverb effects loaded in the Audio Effects window. The
PreDelay adjustment for the Reverb effect is shown at the bottom of the Effects area.
Effects Sends area
Below the Effects area is the Effects Sends region. Figure 9-2 shows the pop-up
menu that creates sends, which send a percentage of track volume to a submix
track.

Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
Figure 9-2: The Audio Mixer expanded view.
Mixing Audio
When you use the Audio Mixer to mix audio, Premiere Pro can add keyframes in the
Timeline window for the currently selected sequence. As you add effects, these are
also displayed in a track’s pop-up menu. After you’ve placed all of your audio clips
in Premiere Pros’ tracks, you’re almost ready to start a trial mix. However, before
you begin, you should understand the Audio Mixer’s Automation settings, because
these control whether changes are made in the sequence or not.
If you would like to practice using the Audio Mixer, you can use the audio clips in

Automation settings
You will not be able to successfully mix audio with the automation unless settings
at the top of each track in the Audio Mixer are properly set. For example, in order
to record your track adjustments with keyframes, you’ll need the automation drop-
down menu set to Write, Touch, or Latch. After you make adjustments and stop
audio playback, your adjustments are represented by keyframes in the Timeline
window (in the track graphline). Figure 9-3 shows the master track with the
Automation pop-up menu exposed. 
Figure 9-3: Automation pop-up menu choices.

159
Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
Here is a brief description of each automation setting:
✦Write. Immediately saves adjustments made for the track and creates
keyframes in the Timeline window that represent the audio adjustments.
Write, unlike Latch and Touch, starts writing as soon as playback starts, even
if changes are not made in the Audio Mixer. 
You can right-click on a setting and choose Safe During Write to prevent changes to
the setting while adjustments are made. You can also have Write mode switch 
to Touch mode automatically when playback is finished by choosing Switch to Touch
After Write in the Audio Mixer menu.
✦Latch. Like Write, this mode saves adjustments and creates keyframes in the
Timeline. But automation does not start until you begin to make adjustments.
However, if you change settings (such as volume) when playing back a track
that already has recorded automation, the settings do not return to their pre-
vious levels after current adjustments are made.
✦Touch. Like Latch, Touch creates keyframes in the Timeline and does not
make adjustments until you change control values. However, if you change
settings (such as volume) when playing back a track that already has
recorded automation, the settings return to their previous levels after current
adjustments are made.
The rate of return for values when Touch is the automation setting is controlled by
the Automatch Time audio preference. This preference can be changed by choos-
ing Edit ➪Preferences ➪Audio. The default time is 1 second.
✦Read. Plays each track’s automation setting during playback. If you adjust a
setting, such as volume, during play back, you hear the change and see the
change in the track’s VU meters, and the entire track remains at that level.
If you previously made adjustments using an animation mode such as Write to
record changes to a track and then play back in Read mode, settings return to
the recorded values after you stop making adjustments in Read mode.
Like Touch, the rate of return is based on the Automatch Time preference.
✦Off. Disregards the stored automation settings during playback. Thus, if you
adjust levels using an automation setting such as Write and play back the
track with the Automation mode set to Off, you will not hear the original
adjustments.
Creating a mix
After you’ve reviewed the automation settings and have become familiar with Audio
Mixer controls, you’re ready to try out a mix. The following steps outline how to do
so. Before you begin, place audio in a minimum of two tracks in the current sequence
in the Timeline window.
Note

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
As you experiment with the Audio Mixer, you can quickly undo your changes by
clicking on previous history states in the History palette.
1. In the Audio Mixer window or Timeline window, set the current-time indi-
cator to the position where you want to start the mix.
2. At the top of the tracks that you want to set automation, choose an automa-
tion setting, such as Write. Note that the drop-down menu at the bottom of
the track indicates where the signal is being sent. By default, track output is
routed to the master track, although it can be changed to a submix track
(which can output to the master track).
If you don’t want a control such as the Volume Fader to affect the track, right-click
on it and choose Safe During Write.
3. Click the Play button in the Audio Mixer window. If you want to play from
the sequence in point to out point, click the Play In to Out Point button.
4. While the tracks play, make adjustments to the controls in the Audio Mixer.
If you work with the Fader controls, you’ll see the changes in the meters for
the different tracks.
5. When you have completed making adjustments, click the Stop button in the
Audio Mixer. If the Timeline window is open and the Show Keyframe pop-up
menu set to Track Keyframes, you can click the Track pop-up menu to show
Volume, Balance, or Panning keyframes.
6. To play back the adjustments, return the current Time indicator to the
beginning of the audio, and click the Play button.
Panning and Balancing
As you work a mix in the Audio Mixer, you can Pan or Balance. Panning allows you
to adjust a mono track to emphasize it in a multitrack output. For example, as men-
tioned before, you could create a panning effect to increase the level of a sound
effect in the right channel of a Stereo track as an object appears in the right side of
the video monitor. You can do this by panning as you output mono tracks to a
stereo or 5.1 master track.
Balancing redistributes sound in multichannel tracks. For example, in a stereo
track, you could subtract audio from one channel and add to the other. As you
work, it’s important to realize that the ability to pan or to balance depends upon
the tracks you are playing back and outputting to. For instance, you can pan a
mono track if you are outputting to a stereo or 5.1 surround track. You can balance
a stereo track if you are outputting to a stereo or 5.1 track. If you output a stereo
track or 5.1 surround track to mono, Premiere Pro downmixes, or puts the sound
tracks into fewer channels.
Note
Tip

161
Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
You can set the Master track to be either mono, stereo, or 5.1 by choosing master
track settings in the Default Sequence Section of the New Project dialog box (you
must first click the Custom Settings tab after creating a new project) or in the New
Sequence dialog box (File ➪New Sequence).
If you are panning or balancing a mono or stereo track, simply set up the Audio
Mixer to output to a submix or master track and use the round knob shown in
Figure 9-4 to adjust the effect. If you are panning a 5.1 track, the Audio Mixer replaces
the knob with a “tray” icon. To pan using the tray, slide the puck icon within the tray
area. The “pockets” along the edges of the tray represent the five surround sound
speakers. You can adjust the center channel by clicking and dragging the Center
percentage knob (upper-right of the tray). You can adjust the sub-woofer channel
by clicking and dragging the knob above the Bass Clef Icon. 
Figure 9-4: Panning/Balance controls for Stereo 
and 5.1 surround track.
After you complete a panning or balancing session using the Audio mixer, you can
see recorded automation adjustments in the keyframe graphline for the adjusted
audio tracks in the Timeline window. To see the keyframes in the graphline, the
Show Keyframe pop-up menu in the adjusted tracks should be set to Show Track
Keyframes. In the Track pop-up menu that appears in the keyframe graphline,
choose either Panner or Balance.
You can copy a stereo track into two mono tracks by selecting it in the Project win-
dow and choosing Audio Options ➪Breakout to Mono Clips. You can convert a
Mono audio clip to Stereo by selecting it in the Project window and choosing Treat
as Stereo.

the graph line. If you want to create keyframes, Ctr+click with the Pen tool.
Creating Effects Using the Audio Mixer
After you become familiar with the Audio Mixer’s powers of adjusting audio on the
fly, you’ll probably want to start using it to create and adjust audio effects for audio
tracks. Adding effects to the Audio Mixer is quite easy: You load the effects into the
effects area and then adjust individual controls for the effect (a control appears as a
knob). If you intend to apply many effects to a track, be aware that the Audio Mixer
allows you to add only five audio effects. The following steps show you how to load
an effect and adjust it:
1. Place an audio clip in an audio track or place a video clip that contains
audio in a video track.
2. If the Effects section of the Audio Mixer is not open, open it by clicking the
small expand/collapse triangle icon (refer to Figure 9-1).
3. In the track to which you want to apply the effect, click the down triangle
in the effects area. This opens a list of audio effects, as shown in Figure 9-5.
4. Choose the effect that you want to apply from the list of effects. After you
select the effect, its name is displayed in the effects section of the Audio Mixer
window.
5. If you want to switch to another control for the effect, click the down arrow
to the right of the control name and choose another control.
6. Proceed to set Automation for the track.
7. Click the Play button in the Audio Mixer window and adjust effect controls
as desired.
Removing effects
If you want to remove an effect from an Audio Mixer track, select the triangle for the
effect and choose None in the drop-down list.
Bypassing an effect
You can turn off or bypass an effect by clicking the f (Bypass icon) that appears to
the right of the effects control knob. After you click, a slash appears in the icon. To
turn the effect back on, simply click the Bypass icon again.

Figure 9-5: Choosing effects in the Audio
Mixer window.
Creating a Submix
Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer not only allows you to mix audio into a master track,
but it also allows you to combine audio from different tracks into a submix track.
Why use a submix track? Assume that you have four audio tracks and you want to
apply the same effects to two of the tracks simultaneously. Using the Audio Mixer,
you can route the two tracks to the submix track and apply the effect to this track,
which could in turn output it to the master track.
When using submix tracks, it’s important to understand that you don’t manually
drag clips into them. Their input is solely created from submixing. Here are the 
general steps for setting up a submix track:
1. Create a submix by choosing Sequence ➪Add track. In the Add Tracks dia-
log box, shown in Figure 9-6, type 1 in the Add Audio Submix Track(s) field. In
the Track Type drop-down menu, choose whether you want the submix track
to be mono, stereo, or 5.1. You will probably want to type 0 in other fields so
that you do not add other audio or video tracks.

Figure 9-6: Creating a submix track.
2. In the Audio Mixer window, set the output for the submix track if necessary
(you could output a submix track to another submix track, depending upon
your track setup).
3. Set the output for individual tracks that you want routed to the submix
track in the output drop-down menu at the bottom of the track.
4. Choose effects for the submix track by clicking one of the effects triangles
icons and selecting an effect. Figure 9-7 shows one possible submix setup.
Creating sends
Premiere Pro’s Audio Mixer allows you to create sends, which can be used to send a
portion of a track’s signal to a submix track. When a send is created, a control knob
appears at the bottom of the track’s area, as shown in Figure 9-8. (In Figure 9-8, the
control knob is set to Volume. However by clicking the word Volume, you may be
able to set the knob to Balance or Pan, depending upon whether you are working
with mono or multichannel tracks.) This control knob allows you to adjust how
much of a track’s signal is duplicated to the submix track. In audio terminology, this
is akin to the track portion of the signal being referred to as “dry,” and the submix
portion referred to as “wet.”
When you create a send, you can choose to set the send to be Pre-Fader or Post-
Fader (the default choice). This allows you to control whether the signal is sent
from the track before or after its fader control is adjusted. If you choose Pre-Fader,
raising or lowering the send track’s fader does not affect the send output. Choosing
Post-Fader utilizes the control knob setting as you change volume in the send track.
You can choose between Pre- and Post-Fader settings by right-clicking the listed
send in the Audio Mixer window. In Figure 9-8, right-clicking Submix 1 will open the
Pre/Post-Fader pop-up menu.

165
Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
Figure 9-7: Submix set up in the Audio Mixer.
Here are the steps for creating a submix track in the Audio Mixer and then creating
the effects send:
1. If the effects/send area of the Audio Mixer is not open, expand it by click-
ing the expand/collapse triangle icon (refer to Figure 9-1).
2. Click one of the triangles in a track’s Send area to open the send area 
pop-up menu. Figure 9-8 shows the pop-up menu in Audio track 2.
3. If you haven’t created a submix track, you can create it by choosing one of
the create submix choices in the pop-up menu. After you make the choice, a
send is automatically created for the submix track. You can see the send in
Audio track 1 of Figure 9-8. If the submix track already exists in the Audio
Mixer, choose it from the Send pop-up menu.
4. When the send is created, a volume knob appears, allowing you to control
the ratio of volume from the track that is sent to the submix track when you
mix the tracks.

Audio Processing Order
With all of the controls available for audio, you might wonder what order Premiere
Pro uses to process audio. For instance, are clip effects processed before track
effects or vice versa? Here’s an overview: First, Premiere processes audio according
the audio settings you set in the New Project dialog box. When audio is output,
Premiere follows this general order:
1. Clips adjusted with Premiere’s Audio Gain command. 
2. Clip effects.
3. Track effect settings such as pre-fader effects, fader effects, post-fader
effects, then pan/balance.
4. Track volume from left to right in the Audio Mixer with output routed
through any submix tracks to the master track.

167
Chapter 9 ✦Mixing and Creating Effects with the Audio Mixer
You certainly don’t need to memorize this, but having a general idea of the order
audio is processed may prove helpful as you work on complex projects.
Summary
The Premiere Pro Audio Mixer provides a variety of utilities for mixing audio. After
you’ve set the automation mode in the automation pop-up menu, you can mix to a
master or submix track during playback.
✦Use the Audio Mixer automation controls to write changes to tracks when
mixing.
✦Use the Audio Mixer to pan and balance.
✦Use a submix track to apply one effect to multiple tracks.
✦You can add effects and adjust them in the Audio Mixer during playback.
✦You can create effects sends in the Audio Mixer.

Creating
Transitions
A
cut from one scene in your video production to another 
provides an excellent transition for action clips or for
clips that move the viewer from one locale to another. However,
when you want to convey the passage of time or create an
effect in which a scene gradually transforms into the next, a
simple cut just won’t do. To artistically show passage of time,
you may want to use a cross dissolve — which gradually fades
one clip in over another. For a more dramatic and abrupt
effect, you can use a clock wipe, in which one scene is rotated
onscreen, as if it were swept into the frames by the hands of 
a clock.
Whether you’re trying to turn night into day, day into night,
youth into age — or simply wake up your audience with a
startling special effect that bridges one scene to another —
you should find what you’re looking with Adobe Premiere
Pro’s Video Transitions. This chapter takes you on a tour of
Premiere Pro’s video transitions.
Touring the Video 
Transitions Folder
The Video Transitions folder in the Effects window stores 
over 70 different transitional effects. To view the Video
Transitions folder, choose Window ➪Effects. To see a list of
the transition categories, click the triangle icon in front of the
Video Transitions folder. As shown in Figure 10-1, the Effects
window keeps all the video transitions organized into subfold-
ers. To view the contents of a transition folder, click the triangle
icon to the left of the folder. When the folder opens, the trian-
gle icon points down. Click the downward-pointing triangle
icon to close the folder.

Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Figure 10-1: The Effects window contains
more than 70 different video transitions.
Navigating within the Video Transitions folder
The Effects window can help you locate transitions and keep them organized. To
find a video transition, click in the Contains field in the Effects window, and then
start typing the name of the transition. You needn’t type in the full name. For exam-
ple, type the word cross, and Premiere Pro opens all the folders that have the name
cross in the effects. Type the word invert, and Premiere Pro opens all the folders that
have the name invert in the effects.
To organize your folder, you can create new custom folders to keep the transitions
that you most often use grouped together. To create a new custom folder, click either
the New Custom Folder at the bottom of the Effects window or the triangle icon at
the upper-right of the window and choose New Custom Bin. To rename a custom
folder, first select the custom folder, and then click the name of the folder. When the
name is highlighted, begin typing the new name. To delete a custom folder, either
click it to select it and click the Delete Custom Items icon, or choose Delete Custom
Item from the window pop-up menu. When the Delete Item dialog box appears, click
OK to delete the folder.
The Effects window also allows you to set the default transition and a transition to
be the default transition. By default, the video transition default duration is set to
30 frames. To change the default transition duration, click the Default Transition
Duration command, found in the Effects window pop-up menu. In the Preferences
dialog box, you can change the default video transition by entering a new number
in the appropriate field. To select a new transition as the default, first select a 
video transition and then click the Set Default Transition from the Effects window
pop-up menu.

Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Applying a transition in Single-Track editing mode
In Premiere Pro, there is no A/B editing, only Single-Track editing. Single-Track editing
is similar to traditional video editing: The transition is placed between two clips in
the track. The transition uses the extra frames at the out point of the first clip and the
extra clips at the in point of the second clip as the transitional area. When you use
Single-Track editing, extra frames beyond the out point of one clip and the extra
frames before the in point of the next clip are used as the transitional area (if no
extra frames are available, Premiere Pro enables you to repeat ending or beginning
frames).
In Figure 10-2, you will find a sample transition project with its windows and
palettes. In the Timeline window, you can see video clips with transitions using
Single-Track editing. The Info palette shows information on the selected transition.
The Effect Controls window displays the options for the selected transition. In the
Monitor window, you can see a preview of the selected transition.
The Effects workspace helps organize all the windows and palettes you’ll need
onscreen when working with transitions. To set your workspace to Effects, choose
Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects.

Here are the steps for creating a transition in Single-Track editing:
1. Create a new project by choosing File ➪New ➪Project. In the New Project
dialog box, pick a preset or create a custom setting. Name your new project,
and then click OK to create a new project.
2. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Editing to set Premiere Pro’s workspace to
Editing mode. In Editing mode, all the necessary windows and palettes needed
to apply and edit transitions are onscreen.
3. Choose File ➪Import to import video clips. In the Import dialog box, select
the clips you want to import. If you want to import a folder, click the Import
Folder button in the Import dialog box, then select a folder. Click Open to

Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
4. Drag one video clip from the Project window into Video track 1 of the
Timeline. Then drag another clip next to it. Set the out point of the first clip
and the in point of the second clip. The first clip should have extra frames that
extend beyond the out point. The second clip should have extra frames 
that extend beyond the in point. These extra frames are used by Premiere Pro
to determine the length of the transition. When you set the in and out points,
each clip should have an equal number of extra frames. The extra frames deter-
mine the length of the transition. For example, to create a 30-frame dissolve,
each clip should have 15 extra frames in each clip. You can set in and out points
by using either the Selection tool, Timeline markers, the Source window, or
the Monitor window. For more information on setting in and out points, refer
to Chapter 7.
5. Another way to overlap two clips in the Timeline is to use the Snap option
and the current-time marker. To do so, drag a clip to the Timeline window and
then move the current-time marker toward the end of the first clip. Now drag
the second clip to the current-time marker. As you drag, notice that the second
clip snaps to align at the left, right, or center of the current-time marker.
6. Now pick a transition from the Effects window and place it over the area
where the two clips meet. Premiere Pro highlights the area where the transi-
tion occurs and then places the transition within the track. If the number of
extra frames for each clip is not sufficient to create the transition, Premiere
Pro opens the Fix Transition dialog box. In the Fix Transition dialog box, you
can change the duration of the transition or click a radio button to have
Premiere Pro repeat the last and first frames of the clips to accommodate the
transition.
7. You can edit a transition in the Timeline window either by moving the clip
to the right or left or by changing its duration by moving one of the transi-
tions edges.
If you move a transition edge, you may also move the edge of a clip. To move a
transition edge without affecting any clips, press Ctrl while you click and drag the
Transition edge.
8. To see the overlapping areas and the transition displayed below the first clip
and above the next clip (shown in Figure 10-7), double-click the transition
in the Timeline window. Display the Effect Controls window. To see the clips
and transition in the Timeline of the Effect Controls window, select the Show/
Hide Keyframes option. You can edit the transition using either the Timeline
features or the Duration and Alignment option in the Effect Controls window.
How to use these features is discussed in the next section.
9. To preview a transition in the Effect Controls window (shown in Figure 10-7),
click the Play the Transition button or select the Show Actual Sources check
box and move the sliders below the Start and End previews.

Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Editing transitions
After you apply a transition, you can either edit it in the Timeline window or you can
use the Effect Controls window. To edit a transition, you first need to select it in the
Timeline window. Then you can either move the transition’s alignment or change its
duration.
Changing a transition’s alignment
To change a transition’s alignment using the Timeline window, click the transition
then drag it either left or right or center it. When you drag left, you align the transi-
tion to the end of the edit point. When you drag right, you align the transition at the
beginning or the edit point. When you center the transition, you align the transition
so that it is centered within the edit point.
The Effect Controls window allows you to make more editing changes. To change a
transition’s alignment using the Effect Controls window, first double-click the transi-
tion in the Timeline window. To view the clips and transition in the Timeline of the
Effect Controls window, the Show/Hide Keyframes option must be selected. Then
choose an option from the Alignment pop-up menu to change the transition’s align-
ment. To create a custom alignment, manually move the transition in the Timeline
of the Effect Controls window.
Changing a transition’s duration
In the Timeline window, you can either increase or decrease the number of frames
the transition is applied to by dragging on one of its edges. For accuracy, be sure to
use the Info palette when making adjustments on the Timeline.
To change a transition’s duration using the Effect Controls window, first double-click
the transition in the Timeline window. To view the clips and transition in the Timeline
of the Effect Controls window, the Show/Hide keyframes option must be selected.
Then click and drag on the Duration value to change the duration.
The alignment and duration of a transition work together. Changing the transition’s
duration is affected by its alignment. When the alignment setting is set to Center at
Cut or Custom Start, changing the Duration value affects both the in and out points.
When alignment is set to Start at Cut, changing the Duration value affects the out
point. When alignment is set to End at Cut, changing the Duration value affects the
in point. Besides using the Duration value to change duration of a transition, you
can also manually adjust the duration of the transition by clicking either the right
or left edge of the transition edge and dragging either outward or inward.

178
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Changing a transition’s settings
Many of the transitions include setting options that enable you to change how a
transition appears onscreen. After a transition is applied to a clip, you can find the
settings for that transition at the bottom of the Effect Controls window. To preview
the settings for a transition, you need to lengthen the Effect Controls window, as
shown in Figure 10-8.
After you apply a transition, you can edit the transition direction by clicking the
Reverse check box in the Effect Controls window (shown in Figure 10-8). By default,
a clip transitions from the first clip to the second (A to B). Occasionally, you might
want to create a transition in which scene B transitions to scene A — even though
scene B appears after scene A. To see a preview of the transition effect, click and
drag the A or B slider. To see the actual clips previewed in the window, select 
the Show Actual Sources check box and then click and drag the sliders (shown in
Figure 10-7). To preview the transition, you can also click the Play the Transition
button.
Figure 10-8: The Effect Controls window 
with the Dither Dissolve settings.
Many transitions enable you to reverse the effect. For example, the Curtain
Transition in the 3D Motion folder normally applies the transition with Clip A
onscreen; the curtain opens to display clip B. However, by clicking the Reverse
check box at the bottom of the Effect Controls window, you can make the curtain
close to reveal Clip B. The Doors Transition is quite similar. Normally the Doors
open to reveal Clip B. If you click the Reverse check box, the doors close to reveal
Clip A.

179
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Several transitions also enable you to smooth the effect or create a soft-edge effect by
applying anti-aliasing to the transitions. To smooth the effect, click the Anti-aliasing
Quality pop-up menu (shown in Figure 10-8) and choose Anti-aliasing Quality. Some
transitions also allow you to add a border. To do so, click and drag on the Border
Width value to set the width of the border, then pick a border color. To pick a border
color, use either the Eyedropper or the swatch next to Border Color.
Creating a default transition
If you are applying the same transition many times throughout a project, you can set
a default transition. After you’ve specified a default transition, you can easily apply
it without having to drag it to the Timeline from the Effects window.
Here are the steps for creating a default transition:
1. If the Effects window is not open, open it by choosing Window ➪Effects.
2. In the Effects window, click the transition that you want to set as the default.
By default, Premiere Pro sets the Cross Dissolve transition to be the default
transition.
3. In the Effects window menu, choose Set Default Transition.
The default transition remains the default transition for all Premiere projects until
you choose another default transition.
Applying a default transition
To use a default transition, organize the clips in Video track 1 as you would for a
normal transition. For Single-Track editing, you must position the clips so that the
in and out points meet in the single track. To apply the transition, do the following:
1. Move the current-time indicator to the extra frames between the two clips.
2. Choose Sequence ➪Apply Video Transition. Alternatively, you can apply the
default transition by pressing Ctrl+D.
You can create a keyboard shortcut for applying a default transition.
Replacing and deleting transitions
After you’ve created a transition, you may decide that it doesn’t quite provide the
effect you originally intended. Fortunately, replacing or deleting transitions is easy:
✦To replace one transition with another, simply click and drag one transition
from the Effects window over the transition that you want to replace in the
Timeline. The new transition replaces the old transition.
✦To delete a transition, simply select it with the mouse and then press the
Delete or Backspace key.

Creating interesting animated graphic 
backgrounds using video transitions
You can create a simple graphic file in Photoshop using filters, then import it into
Premiere Pro and apply video effects and video transitions to it to make a really
interesting animated background. You can also take that simple graphic file and 
animate it using Photoshop filters and Adobe ImageReady (for more information 
on using Adobe ImageReady, turn to Chapter 12). An animated background can be
used in any project as the backdrop of a title, or it can be superimposed onto
another clip.
In Figure 10-9, we started with an animated graphic clip (Digital Vision’s Ambient
Space 434004f.mov). We used the same clip five different times. Each time we
dragged the clip to the Timeline window, we made it overlap the previous clip. The
overlapping area is where we applied a transition. We applied these transitions:
Paint Splatter (shown in Figure 10-10), Multi-Spin (shown in Figure 10-11), Center
Peel (shown in Figure 10-12), and Iris Star (shown in Figure 10-13). For the clip to
look like a different clip, four different times, we applied the Color Balance video
effect to change the clip’s colors.

Here’s how to use video transitions to animate a graphic background:
1. Create a new project.
2. Import a still image or clip into the Premiere project. Import a file that you
created in Photoshop using filters or import a generic-looking video clip, to
which you can apply various Premiere Pro Video Effects to make it more inter-
esting. We imported an animated graphic clip from Digital Vision’s Ambient
Space CD-ROM (434004f.mov).

183
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
The video clip shown in Figure 10-9 is from Digital Vision’s Ambient Space CD
(434004f.mov) and is found in the Digital Vision folder in the Chapter 10 folder
that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book. 
For this project, we also used Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout sound clip,
730001aw.wav.
3. Drag the imported clip from the Project window to Video track 1 of the
Timeline window. If you want apply a video effect to it, click and drag a video
effect over the clip in the Timeline window. For more information on using
video effects, turn to Chapter 14.
4. Drag the same imported clip from the Project window so that it overlaps
the clip already in Video track 1.
5. Apply a video effect to the second clip so that it is not exactly the same as
the first clip. We used the Color Balance video effect to change the color of the
clip. The Color Balance video effect is in the Image Control folder.
6. Click and drag a video transition on the overlapping area of two clips in the
Timeline window. For a more animated feel, you might want to try a transition
from either the Wipe, Slide, Page Peel, or Iris folder.
7. Repeat Steps 5 to 7 as many times as you want.
8. Click the Play button in the Monitor window to preview the project.
9. If you want, import a sound and place it in Audio track 1.
10. Remember to save your work.
Transitions Review
Premiere Pro’s Video Transitions folder provides ten different transition folders: 3D
Motion, Dissolve, Iris, Map, Page Peel, Slide, Special Effect, Stretch, Wipe, and Zoom.
Each folder features its own set of eye-catching transitions. This section features a
tour of virtually every transition in each folder, along with examples of some of the
transitions. The examples shown in the figures use clips from Digital Vision’s Ambient
Space CD (434004f.mov). It is on the DVD that accompanies this book. To view the
transitions in the Video Transitions folder choose Window ➪Effects. In the Effects
folder, click the triangle in front of the Video Transitions folder to display the video
transition folders.
To aid in describing the transitions, we call the clip in Video track A, Clip A; the clip
in Video track B is called Clip B. In the following sections, we describe how Clip A
transitions to Clip B. However, note that many transitions can be reversed so that
Clip B transitions to Clip A.

3D Motion
The 3D Motion folder features ten transitions: Cube Spin, Curtain, Doors, Flip Over,
Fold Up, Spin, Spin Away, Swing In, Swing Out, and Tumble Away. Each one of the
transitions includes motion as the transition occurs.
Cube Spin
The Cube Spin transition uses a spinning 3D cube to create the transition from Clip
A to Clip B. In the Cube Spin settings, you can set the transition to be from left to
right, right to left, top to bottom, or bottom to top. Drag the Border slider to the
right to increase the border color between the two video tracks. Click the color
swatch if you want to change the border color.
Curtain
The Curtain transition simulates a curtain that opens to reveal Clip B replacing Clip A.
You can see the Curtain settings in Figure 10-14.
Figure 10-14: The Curtain settings.
The Doors transition simulates opening a door. What’s behind the door? Clip B,
(replacing Clip A). You can have the transition move from left to right, right to left,
top to bottom, or bottom to top. The Doors settings, shown in Figure 10-15, include
a Border slider. Drag the Border slider to the right to increase the border color
between the two video tracks. Click the color swatch if you want to change the 
border color.

Flip Over
The Flip Over transition flips Clip A along its vertical axis to reveal Clip B. Click the
Custom Settings button in the Flip Over Settings to set the number of bands and
cell color.
Fold Up
The Fold Up transition folds up Clip A (as if it were a piece of paper) to reveal Clip B.
Spin
Spin is very similar to the Flip Over transition, except that Clip B spins onto the
screen, rather than flipping, to replace Clip A. Figure 10-16 shows the Spin settings.
Spin Away
In the Spin Away transition, Clip B spins onscreen similarly to the Spin transition.
However, in Spin Away, Clip B consumes more of the frame than the Spin transition.
The Spin Away settings are shown in Figure 10-17.
Swing In
In the Swing In transition, Clip B swings onto the screen from screen left, like a gate
that is open and is being shut.

Tumble Away
In the Tumble Away transition, Clip A spins and gradually becomes smaller as it is
replaced by Clip B. The Tumble Away settings are shown in Figure 10-18.
Figure 10-18: The Tumble Away settings.
Dissolve
The Dissolve transition gradually fades in one video clip over another. Five dissolve
transitions exist: Additive Dissolve, Cross Dissolve, Dither Dissolve, Non-Additive
Dissolve, and Random Invert.
Additive Dissolve
The Additive Dissolve transition creates a fade from one clip to the next.
Cross Dissolve
In this transition, Clip B fades in before Clip A fades out.
Dither Dissolve
In the Dither Dissolve transition, Clip A dissolves to Clip B, as tiny dots appear
onscreen.
Non-Additive Dissolve
In this transition, Clip B gradually appears in colored areas of Clip A.

188
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Random Invert
In the Random Invert transition, random dot patterns appear as Clip B gradually
replaces Clip A.
Iris
The Iris transitions all begin or end at the center point of the screen. The Iris transi-
tions are Iris Cross, Iris Diamond, Iris Points, Iris Round, Iris Shapes, Iris Square,
and Iris Star.
Iris Cross
In this transition, Clip B gradually appears in a cross that grows bigger and bigger
until it takes over the full frame.

The transitions in the Page Peel folder simulate one page of a book turning to 
reveal the next page. On the first page is Clip A, and on the second page is Clip B.

191
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
This transition can be quite striking, as Premiere Pro renders the image in Clip A
curled onto the back of the turning page. 
Center Peel
Center Peel creates four separate page curls that rip out of the center of Clip A to
reveal Clip B.
Page Peel
This transition is a standard peel where the page curls from the upper-left of the
screen to the lower-right to reveal the next page. Figure 10-23 shows the Page Peel
settings.
Figure 10-23: The Page Peel settings.
Page Turn
With the Page Turn transition, the page turns, but doesn’t curl. As it turns to reveal
Clip B, you see Clip A reversed on the back of the page.
Peel Back
In this transition, the page is peeled back from the middle to the upper-left, then to
the upper-right, then the lower-right, and then the lower-left.
Roll Away
In this transition, Clip A rolls from left to right off the page (with no curl) to reveal
Clip B.

193
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Center Split
In the Center Split transition, Clip A is split into four quadrants and gradually
moves from the center out as it is replaced by Clip B.
Multi-Spin
In the Multi-Spin transition, Clip B gradually appears in tiny spinning boxes that
grow to reveal the entire clip. Click the Custom Settings button in the Multi-Spin
Settings dialog box to set the horizontal and vertical values.
Push
In this transition, Clip B pushes Clip A to one side. You can set the transition to
push from either West to East, East to West, North to South, or South to North.
Slash Slide
In this transition, diagonal slashes filled with pieces of Clip B gradually replace Clip,
as seen in Figure 10-26. You can set the slashes to move from Northwest to Southwest,
Southeast to Northwest, Northeast to Southwest, Southwest to Northeast, West to
East, North to South, East to West, or South to North. When you use this transition,
the Slash Slide Settings dialog box appears. In the dialog box, set the number of
slashes you want. Click the Custom button at the bottom of the Effect Controls win-
dow to change the number of slashes.
Slide
In the Slide transition, Clip B gradually slides over Clip A. You can set how the transi-
tion slides. The transition can slide from either Northwest to Southwest, Southeast to
Northwest, Northeast to Southwest, Southwest to Northeast, West to East, North 
to South, East to West or South to North.
Sliding Bands
In this transition, Clip B begins in a compressed state and then gradually stretches
across the frame to replace Clip A. The sliding bands can be set to move from either
North to South, South to North, West to East or East to West.
Sliding Boxes
In the Sliding Boxes transition, vertical bands composed of Clip B gradually move
across the screen to replace Clip A. When you use this transition, the Sliding Boxes
Settings dialog box appears. In the dialog box, set the number bands you want. Click
the Custom button at the bottom of the Effect Controls window to change the number
of slashes.

Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Special Effects
The transitions in the Special Effects folder are a grab bag of transitions that create
special effects, many of which change colors or distort images. The Special Effects
transitions are Direct, Displace, Image Mask, Take, Texturizer, and Three-D.
Direct
The Direct transition is actually a cut. Place the transition between two overlapping
clips, and the scene cuts from A to B with audio from track A. By clicking and drag-
ging on the transition edge, you can control the in and out points of Clip B without
actually editing Clip B. The transition is most useful when you need to drop in a short
piece of video. In other words, you can have Clip A play and use the Direct transition
to create a short insert edit to Clip B before the program returns to Clip A.
Displace
In the Displace transition, the colors in Clip B create an image distortion in Clip A.
When you use this transition, the Displace Settings dialog box appears. This dialog
box allows you to change the Scale settings. The lower the Scale, the larger the dis-
placement. If the displacement would cause the image to stretch beyond the frame,
the Wrap Around option tells Premiere Pro to wrap the pixels to the other side of the
frame. The Repeat Pixels option repeats the pixels along the image edges instead of
wrapping them on the other side of the frame. Clicking the Custom button at the
bottom of the Effect Controls window enables you to change Displace Settings.
Image Mask
The Image Mask transition uses a black-and-white mask image to determine how the
transition appears. When you apply this transition, the Image Mask Settings dialog
box immediately appears. Click the Select Image button to select a black-and-white
image to use as a mask. You can see Clip B through white areas of the mask. You can
see Clip A through black areas of the mask.
If you select a grayscale image to use as a mask, the transition converts all pixels
below 50% black to white and all pixels above 50% black to black. This can result
in a very aliased (jaggy) transition if the mask image is not carefully chosen.
Take
The Take transition is similar to Direct, providing a cut from Clip A to B. If you click
and drag the end of the transition beyond Clip B, Premiere Pro inserts black rather
than returning to Clip A.
Texturizer
The Texturizer transition maps color values from Clip B into Clip A. The blending 
of the two clips can create a textured effect.
Note

196
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Three-D
The Three-D transition distorts the colors in Clips A and B creating a composite
between the two images. The brightness values of Clip A applied to Clip B can cre-
ate a three-dimensional effect.
Stretch transitions
The Stretch transitions provide a variety of effects that usually stretch at least one
of the clips during the effect.
Cross Stretch
This transition is more like a 3D cube transition than a stretch. When the transition
occurs, the clips appear as if on a cube that turns. As the cube turns, Clip B replaces
Clip A.
Funnel
In this transition, Clip A is gradually transformed into a triangular shape and then
sucked out the point of the triangle to be replaced by Clip B. The Funnel settings
are shown in Figure 10-28.
Figure 10-28: The Funnel settings.

197
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
Stretch
In the Stretch transition, Clip B starts compressed and then gradually stretches
across the frame to replace Clip A.
Stretch In
Clip B appears over Clip A stretched but then gradually unstretches. When you use
this transition, the Stretch In Settings dialog box appears. In this dialog box, choose
the number of bands you want. Click the Custom button at the bottom of the Effect
Controls window to change the number of bands.
Stretch Over
In this transition, Clip B appears over Clip A in a thin, elongated stretch but then
gradually unstretches. Figure 10-29 shows the Stretch Over settings.
Figure 10-29: The Stretch Over settings.
Wipe transitions
The Wipe transitions wipe away different parts of Clip A to reveal Clip B. Many of the
transitions provide a very modern-looking digital effect.

198
Part II ✦Editing with Premiere Pro
Band Wipe
In the Band Wipe transition, rectangular bands from screen left and screen right
gradually replace Clip A with Clip B. When you use this transition, the Band Wipe
Settings dialog box appears. In the dialog box, type the number of bands you want.
Barn Doors
In this transition, Clip A opens to reveal Clip B. The effect is more like sliding doors
than barn doors that swing open.
Checker Wipe
In the Checker Wipe transition, a checkerboard pattern of square slices across the
screen with Clip B in it. When you use this transition, the Checker Wipe Settings
dialog box appears, allowing you to choose the number of horizontal and vertical
slices. To change the number of slices, click the Custom button that is at the bottom
of the Effect Controls window. Figure 10-30 shows the Checker Wipe settings.
Figure 10-30: The Checker Wipe settings.
CheckerBoard
In the CheckerBoard transition, a checkerboard pattern with Clip B in the pattern
gradually replaces Clip A. This effect provides more squares than the Checker Wipe
transition. When you use this transition, the CheckerBoard Settings dialog box
appears, allowing you to choose the number of horizontal and vertical slices. To

199
Chapter 10 ✦Creating Transitions
change the number of slices, click the Custom button that is at the bottom of the
Effect Controls window. The CheckerBoard settings are shown in Figure 10-31.
Figure 10-31: The CheckerBoard settings.
Clock Wipe
In this transition, Clip B appears onscreen gradually revealed in a circular motion.
It’s as if the rotating hand of a clock is sweeping the clip onscreen.
Gradient Wipe
In this transition, Clip B gradually wipes across the screen using the brightness val-
ues of a user-selected grayscale image to determine which image areas in Clip A to
replace. When you use this wipe, the Gradient Wipe Settings dialog box appears. In
this dialog box, you can load a grayscale image by clicking the Select Image button.
When the wipe appears, image areas of Clip B corresponding to the black areas and
dark areas of Clip A show through first. In the Gradient Wipe Settings dialog box,
you can also click and drag the softness slider to soften the effect. Click OK to apply
the settings. To return to these settings, click the Custom button at the bottom of
the Effect Controls window.
Inset
In this transition, Clip B appears in a small rectangular box in the upper-left corner
of the frame. As the wipe progresses, the box grows diagonally until Clip B replaces
Clip A.

itles can help turn day into night, night into day, summer
into fall, and fall into winter. Used effectively, titles at the
beginning of a production can help build expectations, intro-
duce a subject, establish a mood, and, of course, provide the
title of the production. Throughout a video production, titles
can provide transitions between one segment and another;
they can help introduce speakers and locales, or reveal their
names. Titles used with graphics can help convey statistical,
geographical, and other technical information. At the end of
the production, you can use titles to give yourself and your
production crew the credit you so richly deserve for your cre-
ative efforts.
Although titles can be created in graphics programs, such as
Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, you may find that
Premiere Pro’s Adobe Title Designer window offers all the
titling capabilities you need for many productions without
your ever leaving the Premiere Pro environment. As you’ll
soon see, Adobe Title Designer not only enables you to create
text and graphics, but it also enables you to create drop shad-
ows and animation effects with crawling and scrolling text.
This chapter provides a step-by-step look at how to create
production titles using Adobe Title Designer. We then show
you how to integrate your titles into your digital video 
productions.

Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
Exploring the Adobe Title Designer Window
The Adobe Title Designer window provides a simple and efficient means of creating
text and graphics that can be used for video titles in Premiere Pro projects.
To display the Adobe Title Designer window, you first need to load Premiere Pro
and create a new project. When creating a new project, make sure to use the aspect
ratio and frame size you want your title drawing area to have. The title drawing area
takes on the aspect ratio and frame size of the existing project. The aspect ratio is
the ratio of screen width to screen height. By having the title and the output dimen-
sions the same, you ensure that your titles appear exactly where you want them to
be in your final production. 
The standard aspect ratio for digital video is 4:3. For example, the Standard 32 kHz
DV-NTSC preset uses 720 × 480 pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3. The Non-DV
Square Pixel preset uses 640 × 480 pixels and also has an aspect ratio of 4:3. A Non-
DV Square Pixel uses 640 × 480 pixels and also has an aspect ratio of 4:3. If you plan
to create a quarter screen project (320 × 240 pixels), you may want to use the Non-
DV Quarter Screen NTSC preset. Use a different aspect ratio only if you are out-
putting your production using nonstandard dimensions. For example, you can
create a digital video production at 240 × 320, rather than 320 × 240. If so, your pro-
duction’s aspect ratio would be 3:4. To create a project using nonstandard dimen-
sions, choose File ➪New ➪Project. In the New Project dialog box, you can choose
to load a preset or create a custom preset. To create a custom preset, type in the
appropriate Frame Size in the Custom Settings section of the New Project dialog
box. Then name the file project and click OK.
Creating a simple title
To familiarize you with the core tools and features of Adobe Title Designer, use the
following steps as a guide through the process of creating and saving a simple title
clip for use in a Premiere Pro project:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. The New Project dialog
box appears. Name your project, pick a preset, and click OK to create a new
project. For more information on Premiere Pro digital video project settings,
refer to Chapter 4.
2. Choose File ➪New ➪Title to create a new title. The Adobe Title Designer
window appears, as shown in Figure 11-1. The drawing area of the title is the
same size as the project frame size. If you plan on outputting your titles to film
or videotape, you should display the safe title margin and safe action margin
areas. By default, these options are already displayed. To view and hide these
options, choose Title ➪View ➪Safe Title Margins and Title ➪View ➪Safe
Action Margin.

The tools and drawing area in the Adobe Title Designer window resemble
those found in simple drawing and painting programs. The window is divided
into the following sections:
• Main toolbar. Edit these options to specify whether you are creating
still, crawling, or rolling text, using a template, and whether to show a
video clip in the background.
• Toolbox. The graphic and text tools are grouped vertically here, along
the left side of the window.
• Object Style. The settings in this area enable you to stylize text and
graphic objects.
• Transform. The settings in this area enable you to transform text and
graphic objects.
• Styles. The icons in this area enable you to apply preset custom styles to
text and graphic objects.
3. Click the Horizontal Title tool (the “T” below the arrow) and move the
mouse to the center of the drawing area.
4. Click the mouse and type Title.
5. Format your text in the Object Style area. This area contains the Properties,
Fill, Strokes, and Shadow text options. For example, you can change the fol-
lowing parameters:
• Font or font size. Click the triangle in front of the word Properties to
expand the Properties section. Click the Font menu to change the font,
and click and drag on the Font Size value to change the font size. For
more information on stylizing type, turn to the “Creating and Stylizing
Type” section.
• Font color. Click the triangle before the word Fill to expand the Fill sec-
tion. Leave the Fill Type menu set to Solid and click the Color Swatch
next to the Color option. When the Color Picker dialog box appears, click
a color and then click OK. The new color is applied to the title text. For
more information on working with color in the Adobe Title Designer win-
dow, turn to the “Using Color” section later in this chapter.
6. To save and name the Adobe Title Designer window, choose File ➪Save.
The Title file is saved to your hard drive and placed in the current project’s
Project window. If you want to place the title file into your project, all you
need to do is close the Title window and then drag the title file from the
Project window to a video track in the Timeline window.

Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
Creating and Stylizing Type
Premiere Pro’s horizontal and vertical Type tool works very much like Type tools in
graphic programs. Creating text, selecting and moving it, and stylizing fonts works
very much the same as most other Type tools. Changing type color and adding
shadows is somewhat different but very simple when you get the hang of it. The
Path Type tools even enable you to create text along a Bézier path.
Creating text along a path with the Path type tools, along with creating Bézier
paths and shapes with the Pen tool, is covered later in this chapter in the section
“Working with the Bézier Tools. “

Text in video productions should be clear and easy to read. If viewers need to strain
their eyes to read your titles, they’ll either stop trying to read them or they’ll ignore
the video and audio as they try to decipher the text onscreen.
Premiere Pro’s Type tools provide the versatility that you need to create clear and
interesting text. Not only can you change size, font, and color, but by using the
Object Style options in the Adobe Title Designer window, you can also create drop
shadows and emboss effects.
Premiere Pro’s Type tools enable you to place type anywhere in the Adobe Title
Designer window drawing area. As you work, Premiere Pro places each block of text
within a text bounding box that you can easily move, resize, or delete.
Here’s how to create horizontal and vertical text:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. Set the preset to the
size of your Title and production.
2. Choose File ➪New ➪Title to create a new title. The Adobe Title Designer
window appears. Set the Title Type pop-up menu to Still because you are cre-
ating still text rather than rolling or crawling text.
To learn how to create rolling and crawling text, turn to the section “Rolling and
Crawling Titles” later in this chapter.
3. Click either the Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tool in the Toolbox. The
Horizontal Type tool creates text horizontally from left to right, and the
Vertical Type tool creates text vertically.
4. Drag the I-beam cursor to where you want your text to appear and then
click the mouse. A blinking cursor appears.

zontal and vertical text that wraps.
5. Type your title text. If you make a mistake and want to delete the last charac-
ter you typed, press Backspace. Figure 11-2 shows text being entered in a
bounding box.
You can choose Edit ➪Undo to undo your last entry.
Figure 11-2: Text created with Premiere Pro’s Horizontal Type tools.
Editing with the Type tools
If you want to edit text after you finish using the Type tool, you must reselect the
text with the Type tool. Move the I-beam cursor over the characters that you want
to edit and then click. The blinking cursor appears where you clicked; you can then
edit your text. To select all the text within a text box, choose Edit ➪Select All.
If you are using the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool and you want to create a new
line, press Enter and then begin typing. Before you press Return/Enter, make sure
that the I-beam cursor is set to where you want the new line to begin.

Wrapping text
The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools do not automatically wrap text to the next
line. If you want to have Premiere Pro automatically wrap text created with the
Horizontal and/or Vertical tool, choose Title ➪Word Wrap. The Horizontal and
Vertical Paragraph Type tools automatically wrap text to the next line. To use the
Horizontal and Vertical Paragraph Type tools, select the tool from the Toolbox.
Move the tool to the drawing area, click and drag to create a text box, and begin
typing. Notice that as you type, the text automatically wraps to the next line.
Using tabs
You can add spacing between words and align them left, center, or right using tabs.
Tabs can help make your titles (or rolling and crawling text) more readable. To
apply tabs to your text, you need to use the tab ruler in the Tab Stops dialog box.
Before you display the tab ruler, you may want to display the tab markers. By dis-
playing tab markers, Premiere Pro has lines appear where you set your tabs. By dis-
playing the tab markers as lines, you can better visualize how your tabs will appear
within your text. To display tab markers, choose Title ➪View ➪Tab Markers. To dis-
play the tab ruler, choose Title ➪Tab Stops or click on the Tab Stops icon that is at
the top of the Adobe Title Designer dialog box. To create a tab, just click the ruler
with the either the left, center, or right tab selected. To move a tab, click and drag
on it. To apply the tab, click OK to close the Tab Stops dialog box. Then move the
text beam in front of where you want to apply a tab and then press the Tab key on
your keyboard. If you want to change the tabs after you’ve closed the Tab Stops dia-
log box, just reopen the Tab Stops dialog box and then click and drag the tab on the
ruler to the desired location. The text is automatically updated. To delete tab mark-
ers, just click the tab and drag it off to either side of the ruler.
Moving text onscreen
You can move a text box by using the Selection tool, choosing Title ➪Transform ➪
Position or by changing the X and Y Position in the Transform section of the Adobe
Title Designer window. You can also move text by pressing and holding the left but-
ton on the mouse while you drag left or right on the X and Y position values in the
Transform section. The Selection tool, the Title menu, and the Transform options
can also be used to rotate the text box onscreen.
Manipulating text with the Selection tool
You can quickly move the type’s bounding box. Here’s how:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, click inside the bounding box with the
Selection tool.
2. Drag the text to a new location. The X and Y Position values change in the
Transform area.

Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
Adobe Title Designer enables you to resize the bounding box. To do so, follow these
steps:
1. Using the Selection tool, move the Selection tool over one of the bounding
box handles. The cursor changes to a small, straight line with two arrows at
either end of it.
2. Click and drag to increase or decrease the bounding box and font size.
Notice in the Transform section that the Width, Height, X Position, and Y
Position values change.
Adobe Title Designer enables you to rotate a bounding box using the Selection tool.
To do so, follow these steps:
1. Move the Selection tool over one of the bounding box handles.
2. When the cursor icon changes to a small, curved line with two arrows at
either end of it, click and drag to rotate the bounding box and text size.
Notice that the Rotation value in the Transform section changes.
To rotate a bounding box, you can use the Rotate tool in the Toolbox. To use the
Rotate tool, click on it in the Toolbox. Then move it to the bounding box and click
and drag in the direction you want to rotate the text box.
Manipulating text with the Transform values
You can use the Transform values to move, resize, and rotate a bounding box.
Before you can move, resize, or rotate a bounding box, you must select the bound-
ing box by clicking inside it with the Type tool or the Selection tool.
✦Opacity of a bounding box. Click and drag to the right or left on the Opacity
value to change it. Values less than 100% make the items in the bounding box
translucent.

nonuniformly. Finally, click OK.
✦Rotating the bounding box. Choose Title ➪Transform ➪Rotation. In the
Rotation dialog box, type the degrees you want to rotate the text box and then
click OK.
As you move, resize, and rotate the text box, notice that the options in the
Transform section in the Adobe Title Designer dialog box are updated to reflect the
changes.
Changing text attributes
When you first type with the Type tool, Premiere Pro places the type onscreen in its
default font and size. You can change type attributes by changing the Properties in
the Object Style section of the Adobe Title Designer window or using the menu
commands found in the Title menu. The Properties section allows you not only to
change font and font size, but it also allows you to set the aspect ratio, kerning,
tracking, leading, baseline shift, slant, and small caps and to add an underline. You
can use the Type menu to change font and size, and you can also change the type
orientation from horizontal to vertical, and vice versa.
Changing font and size attributes
You can use both the Title menu and the Properties options in the Adobe Title
Designer window to change the font and size of your type. Adobe Title Designer
offers three basic techniques for editing font and size attributes.
To change the font and size text attributes before typing, follow these steps:
1. Click a Type tool.
2. Click where you want the text to appear.
3. Change the settings for font and size by using the Title ➪Font command
and the Title ➪Size command. You can also change the font and size from the

219
Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
Font pop-up menu in the Properties section in the Type Designer window or
by clicking on the Browse icon (which is next to the Show Video check box).
As you type, the new text you type features the attributes of the current font
and size settings.
To change individual characters or words, try this:
1. Select the text with the Type tool by clicking and dragging over the 
character.
2. Change type attributes using either the Title menu commands or the
Properties options in the Object Style area of the Adobe Title Designer 
window.
To browse through the fonts available, choose Title ➪Font ➪Browse. In the Font
Browser dialog box, click the down arrow to see a preview of the fonts. The charac-
ter display in the Font Browser dialog box can be changed. To do so, choose Edit ➪
Preferences ➪Titler. In the dialog box that appears, change the letters in the Font
Browser field.
If you want to change all text in a text block, click the text with the Selection tool.
Then change the font and size text attributes.
Changing spacing attributes
Typically, a typeface’s default leading (space between lines), kerning (space
between two letters), and tracking (space between various letters) provides sharp,
readable type onscreen. If you begin using large type sizes, however, white space
between lines and letters may look awkward. If this happens, you can use Premiere
Pro’s leading, kerning, and tracking controls to change spacing attributes.
Here’s how to change leading:
1. Use either the Horizontal Paragraph or Vertical Paragraph Type tool to cre-
ate more than one line of text in the drawing area of the Adobe Title
Designer window.
2. Click and drag left or right on the Leading value. Increase the leading value
to add space between each line. Decrease the leading value to remove space
between each line. If you want to reset spacing to its original leading, type 0 in
the Leading field. The Leading field is in the Properties section of the Adobe
Title Designer window.
You can also change the spacing between lines by using Baseline Shift. Changing
the Baseline Shift moves text up or down. Here’s how to change the spacing
between lines using Baseline Shift:
Tip

220
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
1. Use the Horizontal or Vertical Type tool to create more than one line of
text.
2. Click the triangle in front of the Properties section to display the
Properties. The Baseline Shift property is located below the Tracking 
property. 
3. Click and drag on the Baseline Shift value to change it. Increasing the
Baseline Shift moves the baseline of the text up. Decreasing the Baseline Shift
moves the baseline of the text down.
Here’s how to change kerning:
1. Use a Type tool to create a word in the Adobe Title Designer window.
2. Click between the two letters whose spacing you want to change.
3. Increase or decrease the kerning values in the Properties section of the
Adobe Title Designer window. As you increase kerning value, the space
between letters increases. If you decrease kerning value, the space between
the letters decreases.
Here’s how to change tracking:
1. Use a Type tool to create a word or two in the Adobe Title Designer 
window.
2. Click and drag over the text with the Type tool.
3. Increase or decrease the tracking value in the Properties section of the
Adobe Title Designer window. Increasing the tracking value increases the
spacing between the letters. Decreasing the tracking value decreases the
spacing between the letters.
Changing other text attributes
Some of the other text attributes allow you to change the look and feel of the text.
These are the Aspect, Slant, Distort, Small Caps, and Underline attributes. Figure
11-3 shows text before and after changing the Aspect, Slant, and Distort attributes.

221

2. Type a word using the Horizontal Type tool.
3. Click and drag to the right and left on the Aspect value to increase or
decrease the horizontal scale of the text.
4. To slant the text to the right, click and drag on the Slant value to the right.
To slant the text to the left, click and drag on the Slant value to the left.
5. To distort the text, click the X and Y values in the Distort section.
6. If you want to underline or convert the text to small caps, click the option’s
check box. Doing so selects the option.
Using Color
The colors you choose for text and graphics can add to the mood and sophistica-
tion of your video project. Using the Premiere Pro color tools, you can pick colors
as well as create gradients from one color to another. You can even add trans-
parency effects that show background video frames through text and graphics.

222
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
How do you know what colors to pick when creating titles? The best guide is to use
colors that stand out from background images. When watching broadcast televi-
sion, pay special attention to titles. You’ll often notice that many television produc-
ers simply use white text against a dark background, or they’ll use bright text with
drop shadows to prevent the titles from looking flat. If you are creating a produc-
tion that includes many titles — such as lower thirds (graphics at the bottom of the
screen, often providing information such as the names of speakers), keep the text
the same color throughout the production to avoid distracting the viewer.
Choosing color with the Color Picker
Any time you select a color in Premiere Pro, you are using Premiere Pro’s Color
Picker. Picking colors in Premiere Pro can be as simple as clicking the mouse. To
see how easy it is to pick a color in Premiere Pro, open the Color Picker, shown in
Figure 11-4, by clicking on the Solid Fill Color swatch. Click the Fill triangle to
expand the Fill section and display the Color Swatch. (The Fill section is found in
the Object Style section of the Adobe Title Designer window.) For the Solid Fill
Color Swatch to appear, the Fill Type pop-up menu should be set to Solid. 
Figure 11-4: Use Premiere Pro’s Color Picker to select colors.
You can pick colors for text and graphic objects in the Color Picker window by
clicking in the main color area of the dialog box, or you can enter specific RGB val-
ues. As you work in the Color Picker, the color that you are creating is previewed in
the bottom swatch in the upper-right of the Color Picker dialog box. The top swatch
displays the original color. If you want to return to the original color, simply click
the top color swatch.

223
Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
If you pick a color that falls beyond the NTSC video color gamut, Premiere Pro dis-
plays a gamut warning signal that looks like a gray triangle with an exclamation
mark in it (shown in Figure 11-4). To drop the color back to the nearest NTSC color,
simply click the gamut warning signal. If you want to work with colors that are
specifically for the Web, click on the Only Web Colors option that is at the bottom
left of the Color Picker dialog box.
PAL and SECAM video feature larger color gamuts than NTSC video does. You can
ignore the gamut warning if you are not using NTSC video.
Understanding RGB colors
Computer displays and television video monitors create colors by using the red,
green, and blue color model. In this model, adding different values of red, green,
and blue light creates millions of colors.
Premiere Pro’s Color Picker simulates adding light by enabling you to enter values
into its Red, Green, and Blue fields. The concept is illustrated in Table 11-3.
The largest number that can be entered into one of the color fields is 255, and the
smallest is zero. Thus, Premiere Pro enables you to create over 16 million colors
(256 × 256 × 256). When each RGB value equals zero, no light is added to create col-
ors; the resulting color is black. If you enter 255 in each of the RGB fields, you cre-
ate white.
To create different shades of gray, make all field values equal. R 50, G 50, B 50 cre-
ates a dark gray; R 250, G 250, B 250 creates a light gray.

Choosing color using the Eyedropper tool
Apart from the Color Picker, the most efficient way of picking colors is to click a color
with the Eyedropper tool. The Eyedropper tool automatically copies the color you
click into the Color swatch. Therefore, you can recreate a color with one click of the
mouse, rather than wasting time experimenting with RGB values in the Color Picker.
You can use the Eyedropper tool to do the following:
✦Select a color from a type or graphic object in the drawing area.
✦Select a specific color from a logo, style, or template.
✦Copy a specific color from a video clip in the background of the Adobe Title
Designer window.
The Eyedropper tool can be very handy for selecting colors from a video clip, logo,
style, or template. Here’s how to use the Eyedropper tool:
1. Create a New Project using the presets you want your title to have.
If you want to use the Eyedropper tool to select a color from a video frame
(shown in Figure 11-5), you need to import a video clip into your project by
choosing File ➪Import.
The video clip that appears in Figure 11-5 is in the Digital Vision folder in the
Chapter 11 folder, in the Tutorial Projects folder that is on the DVD that accompa-
nies this book. The video clip is from Digital Vision’s NightMoves (705018f.mov).
2. Drag the video clip from the Project window to the Timeline window.
3. Choose File ➪New ➪Title to create a new title.
4. To display the video clip in the Adobe Title Designer window, click the
Show Video check box to display the video clip.
5. Click and drag in the Timeline location area to display the frame you want
to appear in the background of the Adobe Title Designer drawing area.
Notice that the Fill, Strokes, and Shadow sections all have Eyedropper tools.
Using the Fill Eyedropper tool changes the Fill Color Swatch. Using the Strokes
Eyedropper tool changes the Strokes Color Swatch. Using the Shadow Eye-
dropper tool changes the Shadow Color Swatch. Click the Eyedropper tool
you want to use.
To import a graphic file as the background or as a logo into the Adobe Title Designer
window drawing area, choose Title➪Logo➪Insert Logo. To import a template into
the drawing area of the Adobe Title Designer window, use the Template button.
6. Move the Eyedropper tool over the color you want to select and click the
mouse. The Color Swatch changes to the new color.

Applying solid colors to text and graphics
After you’ve created a graphic object or some text, applying a solid fill color using
Premiere Pro’s Color Picker is quite simple. Here’s how:
1. Use a Type tool to create a text object or use a Graphic tool to create a
graphic object onscreen. You can use the Selection tool to select a text or
graphic object already onscreen.
2. Verify that a check mark appears in front of the Fill option in the Properties
section in the Title Designer dialog box. Deselecting the Fill check box
option removes the fill. Keep the Fill option selected.
3. Click the triangle in front of the Fill option to display the options.
4. Set the Fill Type pop-up menu to Solid.
5. Click on the Color Swatch. Doing so opens the Color Picker.
6. Pick your new color and close the Color Picker. You can also use the
Eyedropper tool to pick a color from an object in the drawing area or from a
video clip in the background (see the preceding section).
7. To make the color translucent so that you can see through it, reduce the
Opacity percentage. The lower the opacity, the more translucent the object.
You can change the opacity percentage by using either the Opacity field in 
the Object Style section or in the Transform section. You can also use the 

226
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
Title ➪Transform ➪Opacity command. By lowering the opacity in an object,
you can create interesting graphic effects where portions of objects below
show through the object above.
Applying highlights and textures 
with text and graphic objects
You can also add a highlight and/or a texture to the fill and stroke of text or a
graphic object. To add a highlight, use the Sheen option. To view the Sheen option,
click the triangle in front of Properties to display all the properties. Then click the
triangle in front of Fill to display the Fill options. The Sheen option is located with
in the Fill section.
Adding a highlight
Follow these steps to create a sense of light and shadow in your text or graphic:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, with an object selected, click the trian-
gle in front of the Fill property to display the Sheen option. Then click the
Sheen check box.
2. Click the triangle in front of the Sheen check box to display the Sheen
options.
3. Double-click the Color Swatch to pick a color. You can also use the
Eyedropper tool to pick a color from an object onscreen or from a background
video clip.
4. Click and drag on the Size value to change the size of the highlight. Drag to
the right to increase the size. Drag to the left to decrease the size.
5. Click and drag on the Angle value to change the value of the highlight.
6. Click and drag on the Offset value to move the highlight up or down.
Increasing the offset value moves the highlight up and decreasing the offset
value moves the offset down.
7. Change the Opacity value to make the highlight translucent. Reducing the
Opacity value makes the highlight more translucent.
Adding a texture to text or graphics
You can easily make text and graphics more realistic by applying a texture. Figure
11-6 shows the selected objects and text with a texture applied to it.

227
Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
Figure 11-6: In the Adobe Title Designer dialog box, you can see textures applied to 
text and graphics.
Follow these steps to learn how to apply textures:
1. With an object selected in the Adobe Title Designer window, click the trian-
gle in front of the Fill property to display the Texture option. Then click the
Texture check box.
2. Click the triangle in front of the Texture check box to display the Texture
options.
3. Click the Texture Swatch to display the Choose a Texture Image dialog box.
4. In the Choose a Texture Image dialog box, pick a texture from the Premiere
Pro Textures folder.
5. Click Open to apply the texture to the selected object.
You can create your own textures. You can use Photoshop to save any bitmap file
and save it in psd, jpeg, Targa, or Tiff format. Or you can use Premiere Pro to out-
put a frame from a video clip.
Note

228
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
6. Specify optional settings:
• Flip With Object or Rotate With Object. Premiere Pro flips and/or
rotates a texture with the object.
• Scaling. Premiere Pro scales the texture. First, click the triangle in 
front of the option and then click and drag on the Horizontal and 
Vertical values.
The Scaling section also contains the Tile X and Tile Y option, which you
use to specify whether you want the texture to be tiled to an object.
You use the Object X and Object Y pop-up menu in the Scaling section to
determine how the texture is stretched along the X and Y axes. The four
choices from the pop-up menu are Clipped Face, Arbitrary, Face, and
Extended Character. The choice you pick determines how the texture is
stretched. By default the Clipped Face option is selected.
• Alignment. Use the Object X and Object Y pop-up menu in the section to
determine how the texture aligns with the object. The four choices from
the pop-up menu are Clipped Face, Arbitrary, Face, and Extended
Character. The choice you pick determines how the texture is aligned. By
default the Clipped Face option is selected.
You use the Rule X and Rule Y check boxes in the Alignment section to
determine how the texture is aligned. Choose Top Left, Center, or Bottom
Right.
You use the X Offset and Y Offset values to move the texture within the
selected object.
• Blending. Use the Mix value in the Blending section to blend the texture
with the fill color. Decreasing the Mix value increases the fill color and
decreases the texture.
The Fill Key and Texture Key check boxes in the Blending section allow
for transparency of the object to be considered.
Lowering the Alpha Scale value in the Blending section makes the object
more translucent. The Composite Rule pop-up menu allows you to pick
which channel is going to be used in determining the transparency.
Clicking the Invert Composite check box inverts the alpha values.
Creating and applying gradients to text and graphics
Premiere Pro’s color controls enable you to apply gradients to text and graphic
objects created in the Adobe Title Designer window. A gradient, which is a gradual
blend from one color to another, can help add interest and depth to otherwise flat
color. Used effectively, gradients can also help simulate lighting effects in graphics.
The three types of gradients you can create in the Type Designer window are 
Linear Gradient, Radial Gradient, and 4 Color Gradient. Linear and Radial Gradients
are created from two colors. The 4 Color Gradient is created from four colors.

229
Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
Figure 11-7 shows a graphic created using gradients. To create the kite object
shown in Figure 11-7, we used the 4 Color Gradient. To learn how to create a dia-
mond shape using the Graphic tools in the Adobe Title Designer window, turn to
the “Working with the Bézier tools” section. The highlight area in the middle of the
kite was created using the Sheen option. To the text inside the kite object, we
applied a linear gradient.
Figure 11-7: Graphic object and text created using gradients.
Here’s how to create a linear and radial gradient:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, select or create text or a graphic
object with the Selection tool. 
If you want to apply a gradient to specific letters in a text block, select the text by
clicking and dragging over it with the Type tool.
If you are outputting to video, gradients created in small text may make the text
unreadable on a television monitor.
2. The Fill check box should be selected and the triangle in front of the check
box should be facing downward. Do so, if it isn’t. The Fill option is found in
the Object Style section of the dialog box. In the Object Style section of the
dialog box, click the triangle that is in front of the word Properties to display
the Fill option.
Note

230
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
3. From the Fill Type pop-up menu, choose either Linear Gradient or Radial
Gradient.
4. To set the start and ending colors of the gradients, use the Gradient Start
and End Color Swatches. They are the two tiny rectangles below the gradient
bar. Pick the starting gradient color by double-clicking the Gradient Start
Color Swatch. When the Color Picker opens, pick a color. Double-click the
Gradient End Color Swatch. When the Color Picker opens, pick an ending gra-
dient color.
Creating and applying bevels 
to text and graphic objects
Premiere Pro enables you to create some really cool bevels in the Adobe Title
Designer window. You can add a three-dimensional effect to your text and graphic
objects by beveling them, as shown in Figure 11-8.
Here’s how to bevel an object:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, select or create text or a graphic with
the Selection tool.
2. The Fill check box should be selected and the triangle in front of the check
box should be facing downwards. Do so, if it isn’t.
3. From the Fill Type pop-up menu, choose Bevel.
4. Click the Highlight Color Swatch or use the Eyedropper tool to pick a high-
light color. Then click the Shadow Color Swatch or the Eyedropper tool to
pick a shadow color.
5. Click and drag the Size slider to the right to increase the bevel size.
6. To increase or decrease the highlight color, click and drag on the Balance
value. Increasing the highlight color decreases shadow color, and vice versa.
Moving the Gradient Start and End Color Swatches
You can move the Gradient Start Color Swatch and the Gradient End Color Swatch. Moving
the swatches changes how much color of each swatch is applied to the gradient.
The Color Stop Color Swatch allows you to change the color of the selected color swatch.
The Color Stop Opacity allows you to change the opacity of the selected color swatch. The
selected color swatch is the color swatch with a black triangle above it.
To change the angle in a linear gradient, click and drag on the Angle value.
To increase the number of repeats in the linear or radial blend, click and drag on the Repeat
value.

Applying shadows to text and graphics
To add a finishing touch to your text or graphic object, you may want to add a
shadow to it. You can add either an inner or outer stroke to an object. Here’s how:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, select text or a graphic with the
Selection tool.
If you want the selected object to fill but with a shadow, set the object’s Fill Type
to Ghost Fill.
2. Click the Shadow check box to select it.
3. To see all the Shadow options, click the triangle in front of the Shadow
option, so that it is facing downward.

a solid shadow, the opacity effect you desire may not be possible until you remove
the shadow or make the shadow transparent.
Applying strokes to text and graphics
To separate the fill color from the shadow color, you may want to add a stroke to it.
You can add either an inner or outer stroke to an object. Here’s how:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, select text or a graphic with the
Selection tool.
If you want the selected object to have a stroke, but no fill or shadow, set the
object’s Fill Type to Eliminate Fill. This way you can use the selected object as a
frame.
2. Click the triangle in front of the Strokes option so that it is facing 
downward.
3. Click Add next to either the Inner Strokes and/or Outer Strokes option to
add either inner and/or outer strokes to the selected object.
You can click the Object Style menu — the tiny circle with an arrow surrounding it —
to add, delete, or move a stroke.
4. Click the Stroke Type pop-up menu to pick a stroke type.
5. Click and drag the Size value to change the stroke size.
6. Click and drag in the Angle value to change the angle of the Depth and
Drop Face stroke type.
7. Click the Fill Type pop-up menu to pick a fill type.
8. Double-click the Color Swatch to pick a color for the drop shadow. You can

Using Styles
Although setting text attributes is quite simple, sometimes finding the right combi-
nation of font, size, style, kerning, and leading can be time-consuming. After you’ve
spent the better part of an hour fine-tuning text attributes to one text block, you
may want to apply the same attributes to other text in the Adobe Title Designer
window or to other text that you’ve previously saved. You can save attributes and
color using styles.
The Premiere Pro Adobe Title Designer enables you to save and load preset styles
for text and graphics. Thus, instead of picking font, size, and color each time you
create a title, you can apply a style name to the text and have all the attributes
applied at once. Using one or two styles throughout your project helps ensure con-
sistency. If you don’t want to create your own styles, you can use the preset styles
appearing at the bottom of the Adobe Title Designer. All you need to do to apply a
style is select the text and click the style swatch that suits your needs.
The styles section introduces you to a new interface feature of Adobe Premiere Pro.
The choices for styles are hidden from the screen but are accessible by clicking the
Styles menu — the tiny circle with an arrow surrounding it. The Styles menu is
shown in Figure 11-9. Clicking the Styles menu arrow opens up commands that
allow you to create styles, save them to disk, and change the way styles appear
onscreen.
Figure 11-9: The Styles menu displays styles and available style library options.

234
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
Here’s how to create a style:
1. Create the text using attributes that you have in the style.
2. Choose New Style from the Styles pop-up menu, or you can click the New
Style button (above the Delete Style button).
3. Enter a name for the style and then click OK. You’ll see either a swatch of
the new style or the style name will appear in the Styles area.
Styles only remain during the current Premiere Pro project session. If you want to
use a style again, you must save the styles into a style file. Here’s how to save a
style file:
1. Select the name of the style you want to save or select its thumbnail.
You can also start by selecting each object containing the style that you want to
save.
2. Choose Save Style Library from the Styles menu.
3. Enter a name for the style and designate its location on your hard drive.
4. Click Save. Premiere Pro saves the file using a .prtl file extension.
You can replace a preexisting style name with a new style by choosing Replace
Styles rather than save styles.
Loading and applying styles
If you want to load a style from the hard drive to use in a new Premiere Pro session,
you must load the style library before you can apply it.
Here’s how to load styles from the hard drive:
1. Click the triangle in the Styles section to display the Styles pop-up menu.
Choose Load Style Library from the Styles pop-up menu.
2. Use the mouse to navigate to the hard drive location containing your style.
3. Select the style and then click Open. After styles are loaded, you can easily
apply a style by clicking the text or object and then simply clicking the swatch
for the style that you want to apply.
Renaming, deleting, and changing style swatch
You can duplicate styles and rename them. You can delete saved styles that you
don’t need to use anymore. You can also change the way the style swatches appear
in the Adobe Title Designer window.

Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
Here’s how to duplicate, rename, and delete styles:
1. With a style selected, choose Duplicate Style from the Styles menu.
2. To rename a style, first select it and then choose Rename Style from the
Styles menu.
3. In the dialog box that appears, type a new name.
4. To delete a style, select it from the Styles section.
5. With a style selected, choose Delete Style from the Styles pop-up menu. In
the dialog box that appears, click OK to delete the selected style.
If you feel the style swatches consume too much screen space, you can change the
display of styles so that they appear as text or as small icons. To change the dis-
play, simply click the Styles menu and then choose either Text only, Large
Thumbnails, or Small Thumbnails.
To change the two characters that appear in the style swatch, choose Edit ➪
Preferences ➪Titler. In the dialog box that appears, type the two characters that
you want in the Style Swatches field. 
Placing a Title in a Project
To use the titles you create in the Adobe Title Designer window, you need to add
them to a Premiere Pro project. When you save a title, Premiere Pro automatically
adds the title to the Project window of the current project. After the title is in the
Project window, you add titles to the Timeline window much the same way as you
add video clips and other graphics — by dragging and dropping them from the
Project window to the Timeline window. Titles can either be placed in a Video track
above a video clip or in the same track as a video clip. Typically, you could add a
title to the Video 2 track so that the title or title sequence appears over the video
clips in the Video 1 track. If you want to have a Title file gradually transition into a
video clip, you can place the Title file in the same Video track, so that the title
either overlaps the video clip at the beginning or at the end. The transition is
applied to the overlapping section. For more information on working with video
transitions, refer to Chapter 10.
You can add a preexisting title to a project onscreen by importing it into a project.
Here’s how to add a title to the Project window by using the Import command:
1. Choose File ➪Open to open the project file that you want to work with.
2. Choose File ➪Import to import the title file that you want to use.
You should have the title file in the Project window of the project file.
Note

Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
3. Drag the title file from the Project window to the Timeline window. If the
Timeline window is not open, you can open it by choosing Window ➪
Timelines or by double-clicking on Sequence 01 in the Project window.
4. After you add your title to a video track in the Timeline window, you’ll
probably want to preview your project. In the Timeline window, move the
Current-time indicator over the area you want to preview. Then open the
Monitor window (choose Window ➪Program Monitors ➪Monitor). Press 
the Play button to have Premiere Pro play the video clip in the Monitor win-
dow. (For more information about previewing Premiere Pro projects, see 
Chapter 4.)
After you place a title file into a project, you can edit the title file by double-clicking
it. When you double-click, the Adobe Title Designer window appears.
5. Choose File ➪Save to save your work.
Adding a Background to a Title Clip
In this section, you’ll create a new project. In the project, you’ll import a video clip
to use behind the title you create using the Premiere Pro Adobe Title Designer win-
dow. Then you’ll save the title and place it in your production. Figure 11-10 shows
the Premiere Pro layout of a production created using a title superimposed over a
video clip. In the Monitor window, you can see the Title file superimposed over the
video clip. In the Timeline window, the Title file is selected. Premiere Pro creates
titles files with transparent backgrounds, allowing you to see a video clip below the
Title file. Notice that in the Timeline window the Title file appears in the Video 2
track, the video clip appears in the Video 1 track (Digital Vision’s CityMix
567023f.mov), and a sound clip (Digital Vision’s Sounds from the Chill CD-ROM
(665002aw.wav) appears in the Audio 1 track.
Here are the steps to create a title and to overlay it onto a video clip:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a project. Make sure that you use the
proper preset.
2. Choose File ➪Import to import the video clip you want to appear behind
the title.

Rolling and Crawling Titles
If you’ll be creating production credits or a long sequence of text, you’ll probably
want to animate the text so that it scrolls up or down or crawls left or right across
the screen. Premiere Pro’s Adobe Title Designer provides just what you need — it
enables you to create smooth attractive titles that stream across the screen.
Here are the steps for creating scrolling or crawling text:
1. Create a new project or load a project.
2. Create a new title by choosing File ➪New ➪Title.
If you want to place a graphic in the background of the scrolling titles, you can
choose Title ➪Logo ➪Insert Logo or Title ➪Logo ➪Insert Logo into Text.
3. To roll text vertically up or down, choose Roll from the Title Type pop-up
menu. To make the text crawl across the screen, choose Crawl.
4. Select a Type tool. Position the cursor in the area where you want the titles to
appear and then click. Start typing the text that you want to scroll across the
screen. For scrolling text, press Enter to add new lines. Figure 11-20 shows
scrolling text. Notice that a scroll bar appears to the right of the drawing area
in the Adobe Title Designer window.

Creating Basic Graphics
Premiere Pro’s graphics tools enable you to create simple shapes such as lines,
squares, ovals, rectangles, and polygons. You can find these basic graphic tools in
the lower portion of the Toolbox (the last four rows). They are the Rectangle,
Clipped Corner Rectangle, Rounded Corner Rectangle, Wedge, Arc, Ellipse, and Line
tools.
Here are the steps for creating a rectangle, a rounded rectangle, an ellipse, or a line:
1. Select one of Premiere Pro’s basic graphic tools, such as the Rectangle,
Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, or Line tool.
2. Move the pointer into the Adobe Title Designer window area where you
want to have the shape appear and then click and drag onscreen to create
the shape. To create a perfect square, rounded square, or circle, press the
Shift key as you click and drag. To create a line at 45-degree increments, press
the Shift key while dragging with the Line tool. Press and hold the Alt key to
create an object from its center out.
3. As you drag, the shape appears onscreen. Release the mouse after you finish
drawing the shape.
4. To change a graphic from one shape to another, click the Graphic Type
pop-up menu and make a selection. The Graphic Type pop-up menu is
located inside the Properties section within the Object Style area of the Type
Designer window.

Transforming Graphics
After you create a graphic shape in Premiere Pro, you may want to resize or move
it. The following sections provide step-by-step instructions on how to move and
resize graphic shapes.
Moving graphic objects
To move a graphic object, follow these steps:
1. Click the Selection tool and click a graphic shape to select it.
If you have various shapes onscreen overlapping each other and are having diffi-
culty selecting a specific shape, you may want to use one of the Title ➪Select com-
mands and/or the Title ➪Arrange commands.
2. With the Selection tool activated, click and drag the shape to move it. As
you move the graphic, notice that the X and Y position in the Transform sec-
tion of the Type Designer window changes.
3. If you want, you can change the position of a graphic shape by changing
either the X position or the Y position in the Transform section of 
the Designer Type window or by using the Title ➪Transform ➪Position 
command.
4. To center a graphic horizontally, vertically, or in the lower-third section of
the Adobe Title Designer area, choose one of the Title ➪Position com-
mands.
If you have various shapes selected onscreen and are having difficulty distributing or
aligning them horizontally or vertically, you may want to use one of the Title ➪Align
Objects commands or the Title ➪Distribute Objects commands.
Resizing graphic objects
Follow these steps to resize and rotate an object:
1. Click the Selection tool.
2. Resize the shape by moving the mouse pointer to one of the shape’s han-
dles. When the icon changes to a line with arrows at either end of it, click and
drag on the shape’s handle to enlarge or to reduce the graphic shape. As you
resize the graphic, notice that the X and Y position and the Width and Height
values in the Transform section of the Type Designer window change.

the Type Designer window, changes.
5. If you want, you can change the rotation of a graphic shape by changing
the Rotation in the Transform section of the Type Designer window, by
using the Title ➪Transform ➪Rotation command, or by using the Rotate
tool in the Toolbox.
Stylizing Graphic Objects
After you’ve created a graphic object, you may want to change the attributes and
stylize it. You change the fill color, fill style, opacity, stroke, and size and apply a
shadow to it. You can also change the shape of a graphic. All these effects can be
changed using the options in the Object Style section of the Type Designer dialog
box.
Changing the fill color
Here’s how to change the fill color of an object:
1. Use the Select tool to select the graphic shape you want to change.
2. Click the Fill Type pop-up menu and pick a fill style.
For more information on picking a color and fill style, turn to the section on using
colors in the section “Using Color.”
3. Double-click the Color Swatch and pick a color from Premiere Pro’s Color
Picker.
4. If desired, you can change the opacity to make your object translucent.
Decreasing the Opacity value makes your object more translucent.

Working with the Bézier Tools
Premiere Pro features a Pen tool (as found in Adobe Illustrator), a curve-drawing
tool that enables you to create freeform shapes with round and/or corner edges.
These freeform polygon shapes are created from anchor points, lines, and curves.
You can edit these Bézier shapes by using the Selection tool to move anchor points
or by using the Add Anchor Point or Delete Anchor point tools to add or delete
anchor points. You can also use the Convert Anchor Point tool for rounding the 

254
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
corners of polygons or for making rounded corners into pointed corners. For exam-
ple, you can transform large triangles into mountains or many small triangles into
waves.
Here’s how to use the Pen tool to create a line (before continuing, you should have
the Adobe Title Designer window open):
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. Move the Pen tool to the left side of the Adobe Title Designer work area
and then click the mouse to establish an anchor point.
3. To create a straight line, move the Pen tool to the right side of Adobe Title
Designer work area and then press and hold the Shift key as you click the
mouse. Now you have two anchor points connected by a straight line.
4. If you click again, the Pen tool will keep creating anchor points and lines.
To have the Pen tool stop creating anchors, click the Select tool. If you acci-
dentally created an extra anchor point, you can delete it by selecting it with
the Delete Anchor Point tool.
Here’s how to convert a rectangle into a diamond:
1. Select the Rectangle tool.
2. Move the Rectangle to the Adobe Title Designer drawing area. Then click
and drag to create a rectangle.
3. Notice that the Graphic Type pop-up menu is set to Rectangle; change it to
Closed Bézier. The rectangle now has four anchor points at each corner.
4. Use the Pen tool to click the anchor points and drag them so that you are
slowly converting the rectangle into a diamond, as shown in Figure 11-22.
5. To fill the diamond, click the Graphic Type pop-up menu and choose Filled
Bézier. Then use the Fill options to customize the fill. You can also add a
shadow and strokes to the diamond using the Shadow and Stroke options.
6. When you are done creating and filling the diamond, you can use the Rotate
tool to rotate it or use the Title ➪Transform commands to transform it.
To convert a pointed corner to a rounded corner, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pen tool to create four joining, small mountains (downward-point-
ing triangles), as shown in Figure 11-23. If you need to, you can use the Pen
tool to edit the points so that the points at the top and bottom line up.
2. Select the Convert Anchor Point tool from the Toolbox.
3. Click and drag the anchor points with the Convert Anchor Point tool to con-
vert a pointed corner to a rounded corner, as shown in Figure 11-23. Any
time you want to move a point, use the Pen tool.

Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
You can use the Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point, and Pen tools to transform
objects, as shown in Figure 11-24.
Figure 11-24: We converted a square into a house shape and a triangle into a triangle
with a rounded point using the Add and Delete Anchor Point tools.
Follow these steps to learn how to transform an object:
1. Start by creating a square using the Rectangle tool. As you use the Rectangle
tool, press and hold the Shift to constrain the aspect ratios.
2. To edit the object, choose Closed Bézier from the Graphic Type pop-up
menu.
3. To turn the square into a house shape, you need to use the Add Anchor
Point tool to add an anchor point in the middle of the top two anchor
points.
4. Then use the Pen tool to drag the anchor point up, as shown in Figure 11-24.
5. Now use the Convert Anchor Point tool to click the new anchor point to
convert it from a curve anchor point to a corner anchor point.
6. To convert the house shape into a triangle (shown in Figure 11-24), use the
Delete Anchor Point tool to delete the two anchor points below the newly
added anchor point.

257
Chapter 11 ✦Creating Titles and Graphics with Adobe Title Designer
7. To convert the triangle into a dome shape (shown in Figure 11-24), use the
Convert Anchor Point tool to click and drag on the point of the triangle to
convert it into a rounded anchor point.
8. To fill the shape, set the Graphic Type pop-up menu to Filled Bézier. Then
use the Fill, Shadow, and Stroke options to customize the fill.
To create curves with the Pen tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool from the Toolbox.
2. Move the mouse to the left side of the Adobe Title Designer window and
click to establish an anchor point. Don’t release the mouse. Instead, drag
straight up about half an inch (shown in Figure 11-25). Then release the
mouse. The line that appears above and below the anchor point is called a
directional line. The angle and direction at which the direction line is created
determines the angle and direction of the curve being created. By extending
the anchor point up rather than down, the first part of the curve bump will
point up rather than down.
Figure 11-25: Bézier curves created with the Pen tool.

258
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
3. Move the mouse about half an inch to the right of the anchor you created in
Step 2. Then click and drag straight down about half an inch. As you drag
down, notice that a new directional line appears. Release the mouse to create
a curve that has the first part of the curve bump pointing up and the last part
of the curve bump pointing down. Congratulations, you’ve just created your
first curve.
4. If you want, you can edit the curve. Use the Pen tool to move the curve’s
directional lines. As you move the directional lines, the curve’s shape alters.
5. To continue drawing curves, move the mouse about half an inch to the
right from the anchor point you created in Step 3. Click and drag straight up
about half an inch to create a curve pointing down.
6. To draw another curve, pointing up, move the mouse about half an inch to
the right from the anchor point you created in Step 5. Then click and drag
straight down about half an inch.
7. To continue creating curves going down and up, repeat Steps 3 and 5.
To create curves that connect to line segments, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool from the Toolbox.
2. Now create a curve using the Pen tool.
Move the mouse to the left side of the Adobe Title Designer window, click and
drag straight up about half an inch. Move the mouse about an inch to the right
of the anchor you just created. Then click and drag straight down about half
an inch to create a curve. If you want your curve to point down instead of up,
you need to reverse the dragging part of this step. Instead of starting by click-
ing and dragging up, you start by clicking and dragging down, and you finish
by clicking and dragging up, instead of clicking and dragging down.
3. Connect a line to the curve, as shown in Figure 11-26. Move the mouse cur-
sor over to the last anchor point you created in Step 2. Press and hold the Alt
key, and notice that a tiny diagonal line appears at the bottom of the Pen tool
icon. Click the anchor point to create a corner point. After you convert the
point to a corner point, the shape of the curve might change. To adjust the
shape of the curve, click the directional line above the corner point and move
it to adjust the curve. To create the line segment, move the mouse pointer
about an inch to the right and click the mouse. If you need to adjust the posi-
tion of the line, use the Pen tool.

259

To create lines that connect to curve segments, follow these steps:
1. If you have the curve and line segment onscreen from the preceding sec-
tion, click the Selection tool to deselect the curve and line segment.
2. Select the Pen tool so that you can create a line Bézier outline.
3. Use the Pen tool to create a line. To create a line, click in the middle of the
screen, then move the mouse over about an inch to the right and click
again. Then press and hold the Alt key as you click the anchor point and drag
up and to the right to establish a directional line.
4. To connect a curve to the line you just created (shown in Figure 11-27),
move the mouse straight to the right about an inch and then click and drag
down about half an inch. The curve you created is pointing up. If you want
the curve to point down, make the directional line point down, rather than up;
and then click and drag up with the mouse, rather than down.

Creating Text on a Bézier Path
To create text on a path, use the Path Type tools. To use the Path Type tool, you
first need to create a path and then you can begin typing alongside it. Figure 11-28
shows text along a curve path.
Here’s how to use the Path Type tool:
1. In the Adobe Title Designer window, select the Path Type tool from the
Toolbox.
2. Use the Path Type tool to create a path. The Path Type tool creates paths the
same way as the Pen tool. To review how to use the Pen tool, go to the previ-
ous section.
3. If you want to create a curved path and still don’t feel confident in creating
curves, create a path using the Path Type tool to create corner anchor
points. Then use the Convert Anchor Point tool to convert the corner anchor
points to curve anchor points.
4. Use the Pen tools to make the desired path.
5. Switch back to the Path Type tool and start typing.

Creating Type
and Graphic
Effects
A
dobe Premiere Pro packs enormous power as a digital
video production tool. However, if you’re creating a
sophisticated project, designed to appeal to and impress
viewers, you need to turn to other applications to create your
text and graphics. During the course of production, many
Premiere Pro producers turn to such graphics applications 
as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to create eye-
catching text and graphics.
This chapter provides several tutorials to teach you how to
create text and graphic effects in Adobe Photoshop and
Adobe Illustrator. After you see how to create the graphics
effects, you integrate them into Premiere Pro projects. After
your graphics are loaded into Premiere Pro, you use Premiere
Pro’s effects to create some digital magic. Soon your Adobe
Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator artwork appears with digital
video in the background.
Creating and Importing Graphics
from Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop is one of the most powerful digital imaging
programs available for both PCs and Macs. Photoshop easily
surpasses Premiere Pro in its capability to create and manipu-
late graphics. For example, by using Adobe Photoshop, you
can quickly create three-dimensional text or grab a piece of
text or graphics and bend, twist, or skew it. Because both
Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop are friendly
cousins in the Adobe family of graphics products, it’s not 
surprising that you can create graphics, text, or photomon-
tages in Photoshop and then import them to use as titles in
Premiere Pro.

Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
You can even use Adobe Photoshop’s Web-application partner, Adobe ImageReady
(free with Adobe Photoshop), to create animation for a Premiere Pro project. For
example, you can import Photoshop layers into ImageReady, create animation from
the individual layers, and then export the animation as a QuickTime movie. After
you’ve created a QuickTime movie, you can import the file into Premiere Pro to
make a slideshow presentation.
Creating a digital movie of warped text using
Photoshop, ImageReady, and Premiere Pro
You can use Adobe Photoshop to create a layered file and then import the
Photoshop layered file into Adobe ImageReady to create a QuickTime animation.
The QuickTime animation can be imported into a Premiere Pro project to create a
slideshow effect. Figure 12-1 shows a Photoshop file with a Background layer and
four layers with warped text. The following steps show you how to create a
QuickTime movie of a Photoshop layer file.
Figure 12-1: A Photoshop layer file can be made into a QuickTime movie.

267
Chapter 12 ✦Creating Type and Graphic Effects
1. Load Adobe Photoshop and choose File ➪New.
2. In the New dialog box, name your file, TypeLayers. Because you will proba-
bly import the animation of this file into a Premiere project, pick a frame size
that will match your Premiere project. As mentioned in Chapter 4, if you are
creating full-screen graphics for an NTSC DV project (which uses nonsquare
pixels), create your Photoshop CS file at 720 × 480 or 720 × 486 (DI). If you are
using Photoshop 7, create your file at 720 × 534 or 720 × 540. When you import
the file, Premiere Pro will need to scale down the image (see Chapter 4 for
more details).
When creating the file, set the Background mode to RGB Color and set the
Contents to Background Color. Click OK to create the file.
If you create a graphic at 720 × 480 (or 720 × 486) in a square pixel program such
as Adobe Photoshop 7 and then import it into a Premiere Pro NTSC DV project,
the graphic may appear distorted in Premiere Pro. The graphic is distorted
because Premiere Pro automatically converts it to a non-square 0.9 pixel aspect
ratio. To convert the imported Photoshop graphic file back to square pixels, first
select the graphic image in the Project window. Then choose File ➪Interpret
Footage. In the Pixel Aspect Ratio section of the Interpret Footage dialog box, click
Conform to and choose Square Pixels (1.0). Then choose Square Pixels (1.0) in
the pop-up menu and click OK. 
3. Create your own background graphic, using Photoshop’s tools, colors and
filters to create an image onscreen. To create the background in Figure 12-1,
we started by first creating a white and gray gradient with the Gradient tool.
Then we applied the Add Noise filter with the amount set to 17.95 and
Distribution set to Uniform. Next we applied the Artistic Colored Pencil filter.
In the Colored Pencil dialog box, we set the Pencil width to 4, the Stroke
Pressure to 8, and the Paper Brightness to 25. Lastly, we applied the Render
Lighting Effects filter. In the Lighting Effects dialog box, we set the Style pop-
up menu to 2 O’clock Spotlight.
Instead of creating your own graphic in Photoshop, you can use a photograph or
create a photo collage as the background image. Open the file or files you want to
use, then drag and drop the digital image into the new file you created in step 2.
Photoshop automatically places the digital image in a new layer. If the image is
too big for the file, you can scale it down by choosing Edit ➪Transform ➪Scale.
Press Shift as you click and drag on one of the handles. By pressing Shift, the
image retains its proportions.
4. Now you’re ready to create some text. Select the Horizontal Type tool from
the Toolbox.
5. Use the Horizontal Type tool to create some text and then choose a font and
size (we used the font Hobo with a font size of 30) either by using the
Character palette or by using the options on the Type tab. You can also
change the color by using either the Colors palette or Swatches palette.

6. To move the text onscreen, use the Move tool.
7. Choose Layer ➪Layer Style ➪Blending Options to stylize your text. In the
Layer Style dialog box, click on the style you want and then customize it.
Figure 12-2 shows the Layer Style dialog box with the settings we used to cre-
ate the text shown in Figure 12-1. In Figure 12-1, we applied a drop shadow, an
inner shadow, an outer glow, a white color overlay with a 42% opacity, and a
pattern overlay.
Figure 12-2: The Layer Style dialog box in Photoshop allows you 
to stylize text.
8. Click the Warp button in the Type palette. In the Warp Text dialog box,
shown in Figure 12-3, pick a warp option to warp the text. Then click OK to
close the dialog box and apply the effect.
Figure 12-3: Photoshop’s Warp Text 
dialog box allows you to warp type.

269
Chapter 12 ✦Creating Type and Graphic Effects
9. If Photoshop’s Layer palette is not onscreen, open it by choosing Window ➪
Show Layers. The text layer should be selected and at the top of the palette.
10. Choose Duplicate Layer from the Layer pop-up menu to duplicate the text
layer. In the Duplicate Layer dialog box, name the layer and keep the
Destination set to the document you are working on. Then click OK. When the
layer is duplicated, the text appears on top of the previous one.
11. Use the Move tool to move the text down. Then use the Type tool to select
the text and edit it.
12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11 as many times as you need.
13. You may want to rearrange the layers in the Layers palette so that the bot-
tom layer is the background, the second layer is the text first layer of your
presentation, and the third layer is the second text layer of your presenta-
tion. To move a layer in the Layers palette, click and drag on it and move it
either up or down.
14. Choose File ➪Save to save the file in Photoshop format. Photoshop format
saves a file with all of its layers.
The Photoshop TypeLayers file, seen in Figure 12-1, is found in the Chapter 12

Now you’re ready to transform your Photoshop layers into a digital movie:
1. After you’ve saved your Photoshop file, choose File ➪Jump to Adobe
ImageReady. ImageReady opens and automatically loads the Photoshop file.
You may not have enough memory to have both Photoshop and ImageReady
open at the same time. If not, first save your work and quit Photoshop. Next, load
ImageReady and choose File ➪Open to load the TypeLayers file.
2. Open the Animation palette by choosing Window ➪Show Animation. Now
you are ready to make frames from layers.
3. To create frames from each layer and keep adding the background to each
frame, you first need to hide all the layers except the text layers. To do so,
click the Eye icon next to the text layer in the Layers palette. Next click the
New Frame command from the Animation palette. A second frame will be cre-
ated with the background. To add a text layer, click the Eye icon next to the
text layer you want to display. To create a third frame, click the New Frame
command. A third frame is created with both the background and the text
from frame 2. To add another text layer, click another Eye icon to display the
text layer in the frame. Continue creating new frames and displaying text lay-
ers until you have converted all the layers into frames. Figure 12-4 shows
Photoshop layers converted to animation frames.

To create a frame from each layer, you can choose Make Frames from Layers from
the Animation palette window. After you execute the command, ImageReady cre-
ates a frame with each Photoshop layer in it. This command will create frames for
each layer, but it will not duplicate the background into each layer. Note that when
you create frames using this command, ImageReady uses the bottom layer for the
first frame and the top layer for the last frame.
The Photoshop TypeLayers QuickTime movie file seen in Figure 12-4 is found in
the Chapter 12 folder of the DVD that accompanies this book.

to use Adobe Photoshop to create or enhance graphics for eventual loading into
Premiere Pro. The following project, called TimeFlies, leads you through the steps
in manipulating and enhancing an Adobe Photoshop layer file. After you create it,
you can animate the Adobe Photoshop file using Adobe ImageReady.
Here’s how to create a Photoshop layered file using two photographs:
1. Open the file with the photograph that you want to animate. We used a
clock image, shown in Figure 12-7. The clock image is in the Chapter 12 folder
on the DVD that accompanies this book.
Figure 12-7: The clock image used to create the 
TimeFlies project.
2. Duplicate the layer with the photograph in it by choosing Duplicate Layer
from the Layers palette drop-down menu or by clicking the digital image
layer and dragging it over the Create a New Layer icon in the Layers
palette. (The Create a New Layer icon is to the left of the Trash icon.)
Remember that the more layers in an image, the larger the file. Make sure that
your computer has enough RAM and hard drive space to handle all the layers you
create.
3. Choose Filter ➪Distort ➪Pinch. In the Pinch dialog box (shown in Figure
12-8), move the Amount slider to the right. Click OK to apply the changes.

4. Duplicate the Pinched layer, shown in Figure 12-9.
Figure 12-9: The clock image after applying the 
Pinch filter.
You may want to isolate (mask) part of your digital image from its background.
This way, only the masked object is affected and not the background. You can use
one of Photoshop’s eraser tools to isolate the object from the background. If you
are a Photoshop expert, you may want to use some of Photoshop’s more
advanced techniques.

Creating Semitransparent Text
In Chapter 11, you created different title effects using Premiere’s Title Designer win-
dow. Although the Adobe Title Designer window provides many features for creat-
ing text effects, it can’t compare with the text manipulation tools and filters that are
available in Adobe Photoshop. In this section, you use Photoshop’s Layer Styles to
create a beveled text effect. You create an alpha channel out of the beveled text.
When the text is loaded into Photoshop, the type appears semitransparent, allow-
ing part of the background image to show through the highlighted areas of the text.
To create color for the text in Premiere Pro, you use Premiere Pro’s Color matte
command.
Creating beveled text in Photoshop
Here are the steps to create the beveled text effect shown in Figure 12-18. If you’re
an experienced Photoshop user, feel free to vary any of the Photoshop effects.
Figure 12-18: Beveled text created in Adobe Photoshop.

280
Part III ✦Working with Type and Graphics
1. In Photoshop, create a new file that matches the pixel dimensions of your
Premiere project.
2. Using Photoshop’s Type tool, create your title text. We typed the word Zoo at
100 points. If you want to enlarge or stretch the text, choose Edit ➪Free
Transform and manually scale the text.
3. Apply a beveled look to the text by choosing Layer ➪Layer Style ➪Bevel 
and Emboss.
4. In the Layer Style dialog box, choose the Inner Bevel from the Style menu
and then use the dialog box controls to fine-tune the effect. In the
Technique pop-up menu, choose Chisel Soft and then edit the Gloss Contour.
5. After you’ve finished the effect, flatten the file by choosing Layer ➪
Flatten Image.
6. Now you need to create an alpha channel from the text (Premiere Pro uses
the alpha channel to create the transparency effect). To quickly create an
alpha channel, convert the image to Lab color mode and then duplicate the
lightness channel. To convert to Lab mode, choose Image ➪Mode ➪Lab. The
Lightness channel is essentially a grayscale version of the RGB color image.
To turn it into an alpha channel, simply drag the Lightness channel over the
New Channel icon in the Layers palette. After the alpha channel appears, con-
vert the image back to RGB by choosing Image Mode ➪RGB Color (if you
don’t do this, Premiere Pro is not able to read the file).
7. Save your file in Photoshop format.
Creating the Zoo project
Now that you’ve created the text in Photoshop, you’re ready to import the text into
Premiere Pro and create the Zoo project. Figure 12-19 shows a frame from the Zoo
project.

Using Video Effects to Animate Adobe
Illustrator Type and Graphics
Adobe Illustrator is known as a powerful digital drawing tool. By using Adobe
Illustrator, you can create precision drawings and type effects. After creating graph-
ics in Illustrator, you can apply Effects and Filters. You can also import them into
Premiere Pro. (You can also import the graphics into Photoshop first, to apply more
filters, and from there into Premiere Pro.) This project (Hurricane Season) shows
you how to create text on a curve in Adobe Illustrator and then use the text in a
Premiere Pro project with video effects. The Timeline window for the Hurricane
Season is shown in Figure 12-21. The Illustrator text is in Video track 3, the
Illustrator graphic is in Video track 2, and a white matte is in Video track 1.
Figure 12-21: Hurricane Season

remiere Pro is so versatile that you could create and
edit an entire project using little more than Premiere
Pro’s Selection tool. However, if you need to make precise
edits, you want to explore Premiere Pro’s advanced editing
functions.
For example, Premiere Pro’s Trim window enables you to
shave one frame at a time from the in or out point of a clip by
simply clicking the mouse. As you click, you see the last frame
of one out point in one side of the window, and the first frame
of the adjacent in point in another side of the window.
Premiere Pro also enables you to create sophisticated three-
point edits where you specify an in or out point to maintain in
a source clip, and an in and out point for placement in your
program. When you perform the edit, Premiere Pro calculates
the precise section of the source clip to overlay into your pro-
gram material.
This chapter provides a guide to Premiere Pro’s intermediate
and advanced editing features. It starts with a look at some
basic editing utilities, such as the Razor and Multiple Razor
tools, and then proceeds to discuss Premiere Pro’s toolbox
editing tools — the Ripple Edit, Rolling Edit, Slip, and Slide
tools. The chapter continues with a look at three- and four-
point editing and how to trim using the Trim window. The
chapter has been designed to enable you to quickly move
from subject to subject so that you can learn or review editing
features and immediately put them to use.

editing, you may want to unlink audio from video. This section covers several differ-
ent commands that can aid you as you edit your production. It starts with a discus-
sion of the History palette, which enables you to quickly undo different stages of
your work.
Undoing edits with the History palette
Even the best editors change their minds and make mistakes. Professional editing
systems enable you to preview edits before actually recording the source material
onto the program tape. However, professional editing systems can’t provide as
many levels of undo as Premiere Pro’s History palette, shown in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: The History palette.
As discussed in Chapter 2, the History palette can record your editing steps made
while using Premiere Pro. Each step appears as a separate entry in the History
palette. If you want to return to a previous step, simply click it in the History
palette, and you return to it. When you go forward with your work, the previously
recorded steps after the step you returned to disappear.
If you haven’t already tried the History palette, open it by choosing Window ➪
Show History. In a new or existing project, drag several clips to the Timeline. As 
you drag, watch how the states are recorded in the History palette. Now select one
of the clips in the Timeline and delete it by pressing Delete. Then delete another
clip. Again, note how each state is recorded in the palette.
Now assume that you want to return the project to the state it was in before you
deleted any clips. Just click in the History palette to the left of the first Delete state
in the palette. The project returns to its state before any of the deletions. Now
move one of the clips in the Timeline with the Selection tool. As soon as you move
the clip, a new state is recorded in the History palette, erasing the second Delete
state in the History palette. After you return to one state in the History palette and
begin to work, you can’t go forward again.

Cutting and pasting clips
If you’ve ever used a word processor to edit text, you know that one of the easiest
ways to rearrange your work is to copy and paste from one part of the text to
another. In Premiere Pro, you can easily copy and paste, or cut and paste, a clip
from one part of the Timeline window to another. In fact, Premiere Pro has three
paste commands — Paste, Paste to Fit, and Paste Attributes.
Splitting a clip with the Razor and Multiple Razor tools
Before copying and pasting or moving a clip, you may want to slice it into two
pieces and only paste or move a portion of the clip. An easy way to slice a clip is to
use Premiere Pro’s Razor tool, shown in Figure 13-2. One click of the Razor tool
splits a clip into two pieces. Here’s how to use the Razor and Multiple Razor tool:
1. If you want to split one clip in one unlocked track into two pieces, select
the Razor tool. If you want to split all unlocked tracks into two separate
pieces, you first need to press Shift to activate the Multiple Razor tool.
Figure 13-2: The Razor tool.
Press C on the keyboard to activate the Razor tool.
2. Move the current-time indicator to the frame that you want to split.
3. In the sequence that you want to edit, click the clip to cut it with either the
Razor tool or Multiple Razor tool, as shown in Figure 13-3. (Or you can
choose Sequence ➪Razor at Current Time Indicator.) After you click with
either the Razor or Multiple Razor tool, you can move the cut portion of the
clip independently of the rest of the clip.
Figure 13-3: Cutting with either the Razor or Multiple Razor 
tool splits the clip into two clips.

Pasting clips
After you’ve split a clip, you may want to copy and paste it or cut and paste it to
another location in the Timeline.
If the area into which you want to paste the clip already has clips within it, you can
use Premiere Pro’s Paste, Paste Insert, or Paste Attributes commands. Premiere
Pro’s Paste command pastes a clip over any clip at the current-time indicator posi-
tion, its Paste Insert command inserts the pasted clip in a Timeline gap, and its
Paste Attributes command copies motion, opacity, volume, and color settings of
one clip into another clip.
Using Paste to overlay clips
Premiere Pro’s Paste command enables you to paste clips into gaps in the Timeline.
It also provides options for how you want the inserted clips to fit within your pro-
duction. Here’s how to paste a clip so that it overlays or replaces clips in the cur-
rent sequence in the Timeline.
1. Select the clip or clips that you want to copy or paste.
2. Choose Edit ➪Cut or Edit ➪Copy.
3. Move the current-time indicator to where you want to overlay the clip.
4. Choose Edit ➪Paste. Premiere Pro drops the new material over any clip at the
current-time indicator.
Using Paste Insert to insert clips
Premiere Pro’s Paste Insert command enables you to paste clips into gaps in the
Timeline. It also provides options for inserting clips to fit within your production.
Here’s how to use Paste to Fit to insert a clip:
1. Select the clip or clips that you want to copy or paste.
2. Choose Edit ➪Cut or Edit ➪Copy.
3. Move the current-time indicator to where you want to insert the clip.
4. Choose Edit ➪Paste Insert. Premiere Pro drops the clip at the current-time
indicator and pushes all subsequent clips to the right.
Using Paste Attributes
Premiere Pro’s Paste Attributes command allows you to copy one clip’s attributes
and apply them to another clip’s. For example, using Paste Attributes, you can copy
the color settings, opacity, volume, and effects of one clip and apply them to
another. To use the Paste Attributes command, follow these steps:
1. Select the clip or clips that that have the attributes that you want to copy.
2. Choose Edit ➪Cut or Edit ➪Copy.

297
Chapter 13 ✦Advanced Editing Techniques
3. Select one or more clips.
4. Choose Edit ➪Paste Attributes.
Removing sequence gaps
During the course of editing, you may purposely or inadvertently leave gaps in the
Timeline. Sometimes the gaps aren’t even visible because of the zoom level in the
Timeline window. Here’s how to automatically remove a gap in the Timeline:
1. Right-click the mouse in the gap in the Timeline. (You might need to zoom in
to see small gaps.)
2. Choose Ripple Delete from the drop-down menu that appears in the
sequence, as shown in Figure 13-4. Premiere Pro removes the gap.
Figure 13-4: Right-click and choose Ripple Delete to 
remove gaps.
Unlinking and linking audio and video
While performing video edits, you may decide that you would like to create audio
effects where the audio from one clip fades into another video clip (called a split
edit). Although editing the video is a simple chore, you may find that you need to
unlink the audio from the video to create the effect you want. 
When you capture video using the Premiere Pro Capture command, Premiere Pro
links the video information to the audio. This marriage is evident as you work.
When you drag a clip to the Timeline, its audio automatically appears in an audio
track. When you move the video, the audio moves with it. If you delete the video
from the track, the audio is deleted. However, during editing, you may want to sepa-
rate the video from its audio to create effects or to replace the audio altogether.

298
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
If you are trying to sync audio to video, it’s helpful to view the audio’s waveform in
the audio track. To view the waveform, expand the audio track by clicking the tri-
angle at the front of the track. Next choose Show Waveform from the Set Display
Style drop-down menu.
To unlink video from audio, follow these steps:
1. Select the audio track that you want to unlink. Note that the names of linked
clips are underlined.
2. Choose Clip ➪Unlink Audio and Video. You can also right-click the clip and
choose Unlink Audio and Video from the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure
13-5. Note that the clips are no longer underlined. If you want, you can also
delete either the video or audio portion.
Figure 13-5: Right-click a linked clip and choose 
Unlink Audio and Video to unlink it.
Editing Clips with the Tool Palette Tools
After you’ve edited two clips together in a sequence Timeline, you may want to 
fine-tune the edit by changing the out point of the first clip. Although you can 
use the Monitor window to precisely change the edit point, you may prefer to use
Tip

299
Chapter 13 ✦Advanced Editing Techniques
sequence-editing tools, such as the Rolling Edit tool and the Ripple Edit tool. Both
tools enable you to quickly edit the out point of adjacent clips.
If you have three clips edited together, the Slip and Slide tools provide a quick
means for editing the in or out point of the middle clip. The following sections
describe how to use the Rolling Edit and Ripple Edit tools to edit adjacent clips and
how to use the Slip and Slide tools to edit a clip between two other clips. As you try
out these tools, keep the Monitor window open. It provides an enlarged view of the
clips. When using the Slip and Slide tools, the Monitor window also shows how
many frames have been edited.
Figure 13-6 shows the Rolling Edit, Ripple Edit, Slip, and Slide tools.
Figure 13-6: The Rolling Edit, Ripple Edit, 
Slip, and Slide tools.
The clips shown in this chapter use video footage from the Chapter 1 folder of
the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible DVD. The clips are 705008f and 705009f from
Digital Vision’s Night Moves CD.
Creating a rolling edit
The Rolling Edit tool enables you to click and drag the edit line of one clip and
simultaneously change the in or out point of the next clip on the edit line. When
you click and drag the edit line, the duration of the next clip is automatically edited
to compensate for the change in the previous clip. For example, if you add five
frames to the first clip, five frames are subtracted from the next. Thus, a rolling edit
enables you to edit one clip without changing the duration of your edited program.

dow, which previews the edit for you.
2. Click the Rolling Edit tool to select it or press N on the keyboard.
3. Move the Rolling Edit tool to the edit line between two adjacent clips.
4. Click and drag either left or right to trim the clips. If you drag right, you
extend the out point of the first clip and reduce the in point of the adjacent
clip. If you click to the left, you reduce the out point of the first clip and
extend the in point of the next clip. Figure 13-7 shows a rolling edit. In the fig-
ure, dragging the Rolling Edit tool right simultaneously changes the in point of
the clip on the right and the out point of the clip on the left. The figure also
shows how the Monitor window previews the edit.

different clips with a rolling edit.
Creating a ripple edit
The Ripple Edit tool enables you to edit a clip without affecting the adjacent clip.
Performing a ripple edit is the opposite of performing a rolling edit. As you click

301
Chapter 13 ✦Advanced Editing Techniques
and drag to extend the out point of a clip, Premiere Pro pushes the next clip to the
right to avoid changing its in point — thus, creating a ripple effect throughout the
production, changing its duration. If you click and drag to the left to reduce the out
point, Premiere Pro doesn’t change the in points of the next clips. To compensate
for the change, Premiere Pro shortens the duration of the sequence. Here’s how to
perform a ripple edit with the Ripple Edit tool:
1. Onscreen you should have a project with at least two clips touching side by
side in a video track in the Timeline window. As a further aid, open the
Monitor window, which previews the edit for you.
2. Click the Ripple Edit tool to select it or press B on the keyboard.
3. Move the Ripple Edit tool to the out point of the clip you are going to trim.
4. Click and drag right to increase the clip’s length or left to decrease the
clip’s length. The duration of the next clip remains unchanged, but the dura-
tion of the sequence is changed. Figure 13-8 shows a ripple edit. In the figure,
the in point of the Chefs clip remains unchanged, as the out point of the
Diners clip (on the left) is extended.

If you want to perform a ripple edit without affecting audio, press Alt while click-
ing and dragging the Ripple Edit tool.
To edit only the audio or video of a linked clip, Alt+drag with the Ripple or Rolling
Edit tool.
Creating a slip edit
A slip edit enables you to change the in and out points of a clip sandwiched between
two other clips while maintaining the middle clip’s original duration. As you click
and drag the clip, the clip’s neighbors to the left and right do not change, so neither
does the sequence duration. Here’s how to perform a slip edit with the Slip tool:
1. Onscreen you should have a project with at least three clips side by side in
a video track in the Timeline window. If you want to preview the edit as you
work, open the Monitor window as well.
2. Click the Slip tool to select it, or press Y on the keyboard.
3. With the Slip tool selected, click the clip that is in the middle of two 
other clips.
4. To change the in and out points without changing the duration of the
sequence, click and drag left or right. Figure 13-9 shows a slip edit. In the 
figure, the middle clip is dragged to the right, which changes its in and out
points.
Although the Slip tool is generally used to edit one clip between two others, you
can edit the in and out points of a clip with the Slip tool even if it is not between
other clips.
Creating a slide edit
Like the slip edit, the slide edit is performed on one clip placed between two others
in sequence. A slide edit maintains the in and out points of the clip that you are
dragging while changing the duration of clips abutting it. When performing a slide
edit, dragging right extends the out point of the previous clip as well as the in point
of the next clip (making it occur later). Dragging left on a clip reduces the out point
of the previous clip, as well as the in point of the following clip (causing it to occur
earlier). As a result, the duration of the edited clip and the entire edited program do
not change. Here’s how to perform a slide edit with the Slide Edit tool:

Creating a Three- or Four-Point Edit
Three- and four-point edits are commonly performed in professional video editing
studios, using a monitor set up that is similar to Premiere Pro’s Dual View in the
Monitor window. In Dual View, the Source section of the Monitor window typically
shows a clip that hasn’t been added to the Timeline, while the Program section
shows a section of the program that has already been placed on the Timeline.
Performing a three-point edit
Typically, a three-point edit is used to overlay or replace a portion of the program
with a portion of the source clip. Before the edit is performed, three crucial points
are specified. Usually the three points are as follows:

305
Chapter 13 ✦Advanced Editing Techniques
✦The in point of the source clip. The frame where you want the inserted clip
to first appear.
✦An in point of the program clip. The frame where you want the source clip to
first appear in the current sequence in the Timeline.
✦An out point in the program clip. The frame where you want the source
replacement to end.
When the edit is performed, Premiere Pro automatically calculates the exact sec-
tion of the source clip needed to replace the section designated by the in and out
points of the program.
You could use a three-point edit in the following situation. Assume that you have a
clip of a sailboat in the Timeline and you want to replace two seconds of it with a
clip of waves crashing. To set this up, you place the Waves clip in the Source sec-
tion of the Monitor window and set the in point for the Waves clip in the Source sec-
tion. Then you set the in and out points in the Sailboat clip in the Monitor section of
the Monitor window. When you perform the three-point edit, the Waves clip
appears in the section in the Timeline designated by the area you set as the in and
out points of the Sailboat clip.
Follow these steps to perform a three-point edit. Before creating a three-point edit,
you need a project onscreen containing at least one clip in the Timeline.
If you want to practice using one of the tutorial files, start by importing the file
705008f.mov from the Chapter 1 folder of the Adobe Premiere Pro Bible DVD-ROM.
This clip shows a waitress leading diners to a table in a restaurant. After the file is
imported, drag it into track 1 in the Timeline. This clip will appear in the Program
section of the Monitor window. Next, import clip 705009f.mov from the Chapter 1
folder of the DVD-ROM. This clip shows chefs working in the kitchen of a restaurant.
Don’t place this on the Timeline; Premiere Pro will do it for you when you create the
three-point edit. The three-point edit will create a cut-away from the restaurant din-
ers to the chefs in the kitchen for a few seconds, before returning to the diners clip.
1. Select the target track in the Timeline by clicking at the far the left of the
track. (You should already have a clip in this track.)
2. If the Monitor window is not open, open it by choosing Window ➪Show
Monitor. Set the monitor to Dual View by clicking the Dual View button or by
choosing Dual View in the Monitor window menu. If you click the Play button
in the Monitor window, you’ll see that the clip in the Timeline appears in the
Program section.
3. Place a clip in the Source section (left side) of the Monitor window. If you
are using this book’s DVD-ROM tutorial files, double-click clip 705009f.mov in
the Project window. The clip should appear in the Source section, and its
name should appear in the Source section tab. Note that you may be able to
choose another clip from the Clip pop-up menu (in the left side of the Monitor
window) if you’ve already been working with clips in the source section.

306
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
4. In the Source section, set the in point for the source clip. This is the first
frame that you want overlaid into the program. If you are using the tutorial
files, set the in point about 3 seconds, or 25 frames, from the beginning of clip
705009b.mov. To move to the frame, click and drag in the jog tread control or
the current-time indicator in the Source section and then use the Step
Forward or Step Back buttons to navigate to the precise frame.
5. Click the Set In point button.
6. In the Program view of the Monitor window, move to the first frame that
you want to replace with the source clip. If you are using the tutorial files,
move to about 2 seconds from the beginning of clip 7005008f.mov. To move to
the frame, click and drag in the job tread or current-time indicator in the
Program view and then use the Step Forward or Step Back buttons to navigate
to the precise frame. Alternatively, you can click and drag the edit line in the
Timeline window.
7. Set the in point by clicking the In Point button in the Program or Sequence
section of the Monitor window.
8. In the Program section of the Monitor window, move to the last frame that
you want replaced by the source clip. If you are using the tutorial files, move
about 4 seconds, or 18 frames, into clip 705008f. mov.
9. Click the Set Out point button.
10. To perform the edit, click the Overlay button (in the Source section of the
Monitor window, to the left of the Toggle Take Audio and Video button).

Performing a four-point edit
Three-point edits are performed more frequently than four-point edits because you
only need to specify three points. In a four-point edit, you specify the in and out
points of the source clip as well as the in and out points of the program clip.
Before performing the edit, make sure that the target track is set. If not, choose the
track that you want to have the clip dropped into on the Timeline by clicking at the
far left of track.
Otherwise, performing a four-point edit (see Figure 13-12) is identical to performing
a three-point edit, except that you must set an out point as well as an in point in the
Source side of the Monitor window. What happens if the source duration (the dura-
tion between in and out source points) does not match the duration between the
program’s in and out points? Premiere Pro opens an alert enabling you to choose
whether you want to trim the source clip or change the speed of the source clip.

Performing Lift and Extract Edits
Premiere Pro’s Monitor window provides two buttons that enable you to quickly
remove sections of program material in the Timeline:
✦
Lift button. Removes frames from the Timeline but does not close the
gap created by the deleted frames.

dow can be in Single or Dual View. Here’s how to perform a Lift edit:
1. In the Program (right) side of the Monitor window, move to the first frame
that you want removed from the program in the Timeline.
2. Click the In Point button.
3. Move to the last frame that you want to remove from the program.
4. Click the Set Out point button.
5. Click the Lift button in the Program side or choose Sequence ➪Lift.
Premiere Pro removes the frames from the Timeline, leaving a gap where 
the removed frames used to be.
Before performing an Extract edit, you need to have a project onscreen with at least
one clip in the Timeline. The Monitor window should be open. Here’s how to per-
form an Extract edit:
1. In the Program (right) side of the Monitor window, move to the first frame
that you want moved from the program in the Timeline.
2. Click the Set In point button.
3. Move to the last frame that you want to remove from the program.
4. Click the Set Out point button.
5. Click the Extract button in the Program side. After you click, Premiere Pro
removes the frames from the Timeline. Any adjacent clips in the Timeline
move to close the gap that the deletion caused.
Fine-Tuning Edits Using Trim Window
The Trim window enables you to precisely change the edit points of clips on the
Timeline. When you work in the Trim window, shown in Figure 13-13, you can click
to move from edit point to edit point and then remove or add frames on either side
of the edit line. The Trim window enables you to create ripple edits and rolling
edits. When you create a ripple edit, the project duration increases or decreases
depending on whether frames are added to or subtracted from the edit. If you cre-
ate a rolling edit, the project duration remains the same. Premiere Pro accom-
plishes this by adding frames from one side of the edit as it subtracts from the
other and by subtracting from one side of the edit while it adds to the other.

309
Chapter 13 ✦Advanced Editing Techniques
Figure 13-13: The Monitor window in Trim mode.
Here’s how to use the Trim mode to trim an edit. Before beginning, you should have
at least two separate clips on the Timeline that are adjacent to each other. The
Monitor window should be open onscreen. If you keep the Timeline window open,
you’ll see the effects of the edit in the Timeline as you work.
1. Select the target track by clicking at the far left side of the track.
2. Move the current-time indicator close to the area that you want to fine-tune
or use the controls in the Monitor window to move close to the area that
you want to edit.
3. Open the Trim window. Click the Trim button in the Monitor window (lower-

6. To create a ripple edit, follow these steps:
a. Click and drag on either clip in the monitor displays. For instance, if
you click and drag left on the clip in the left window, you make this clip’s
duration shorter (changing its out point), without affecting the change
the duration of the clip on the right. If you click and drag right on the
clip in the right window, you delay its in point in (causing it to be further
into the clip), thereby shortening this clip, but not changing the duration
of clip on the left.
b. After you start the process of creating a ripple edit, add or remove
frames by clicking in the bordered frame and entering a positive or
negative number. Enter a positive number of frames if you want to add
frames to the last selected clip, enter a negative number to subtract
from the selected clip.
Clicking the –5 or –1 button removes five frames or one frame from the
last selected clip. Clicking the +5 or +1 button adds five frames or one
frame to the last selected clip.
You can also create a ripple edit by clicking the Jog in point or Jog out
point treads, clicking and dragging the in or out point icons, or clicking
and dragging the Time code display of the incoming, outgoing, and cur-
rent edit position.
7. To create a rolling edit, follow these steps:
a. Click and drag in the middle of the two clips. If you click and drag
right, you simultaneously change the in point of the clip on the right,
(making it later in the clip) and the out point of the clip on the left (mak-
ing it later as well). Clicking and dragging left produces the opposite
effect.
You can also create a rolling edit by clicking the Jog In and Out point
treads.
b. After you start the process of creating a rolling edit, you can add or
remove frames by clicking in the bordered frame and entering a posi-
tive or negative number. Enter a positive number to specify the number
of frames that you want to add to both clips or a negative number to
specify the number of frames to delete from both clips.
Clicking the –5 or –1 button removes five frames or one frame from 
both clips. Clicking the +5 or +1 button adds five frames or one frame 
to both clips.

Creating Duplicate Clips
As Premiere Pro users edit a production, most simply drag clips from the Project
menu and place them into the Timeline. Doing this works well on short projects.
However, if you are working on a long production with complicated edits, you may
want to use Premiere Pro clip options that enable you to duplicate clips in the
Project window. To understand duplicate clips, it’s important to review how
Premiere Pro categorizes the clips that you use:
✦Source clip. When you import a file into Premiere Pro, the source clip of the
file appears in the Project window. The source clip is a screen representation
of the digitized material on disk.
✦Instance. When you drag a clip to the Timeline, you create an instance of the
master clip. Premiere Pro enables you to create multiple instances of the mas-
ter clip in the Timeline. If you delete the master clip from the Project window,
all instances are removed as well.
✦Duplicate clip. Although using clip instances can be very efficient, there’s one
major drawback: Keeping track of all instances of the master clip in sequences
in the Timeline can be difficult. The solution is to create a duplicate with a new
name (you can even trim the clip before duplicating it). Each time you want to
use the clip in the Timeline, you create another duplicate and drag it to the
Timeline. Each duplicate remains listed separately in the Project window.
Instead of capturing many short clips and adding them to the Project window, cap-
turing one long sequence and then creating duplicate clips from the original or mas-
ter clip can be more efficient. If you create a duplicate clip, it’s important to
understand that a duplicate clip is a copy of the master clip, which never loses its
link to the original source file on disk. Thus, if you delete the master clip in the
Project window, any duplicate clips created from it remain in the project.
Here are the steps for creating a duplicate clip:
1. Select the clip in the Project window.
2. Choose Edit ➪Duplicate. A duplicate of the clip appears in the Project win-
dow with the word copy following the original clip name.
3. Rename the clip by choosing Edit ➪Rename.
You duplicate a clip by Ctrl+dragging it into another location in the Project window
or by clicking and dragging a clip from the Source section of the Monitor window
into the Project window.

Editing a Clip Using Clip Commands
When editing a production, you may find that you need to adjust a clip to maintain
continuity in a project. For example, you may want to slow the speed of a clip to fill
a gap in your production or to freeze a frame for a moment or two.
Various commands in the Clip menu enable you to edit a clip. Premiere Pro enables
you to change the duration and/or the speed of a clip using the Clip ➪Speed/Duration
command. You can change the frame rate of a clip using the Clip ➪Video Options ➪
Frame Hold command. Or you can use the Clip ➪Video Options ➪Frame Hold com-
mand to freeze a video frame. Using the Clip ➪Video Options ➪Field Options 
command, you can have Premiere Pro adjust interlaced clips.
Using the Duration and Speed commands
You can use the Clip ➪Speed/Duration commands to change the length of a clip or
to speed up, slow down, or play a clip in reverse.
Here’s how to change the duration of a clip:
1. Click the clip in a video track or in the Project window to select it.
2. Choose Clip ➪Speed/Duration. The Clip Duration dialog box appears (see
Figure 13-14).
Figure 13-14: Use the Clip Speed/Duration dialog
box to change a clip’s speed or duration.
3. Click the Link button to Unlink Speed and Duration.
4. Type a duration. You can’t expand the clip to extend past its original out point.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and set the new duration.
You can also change the duration of a clip by extending its edge with the Selection
tool in the Timeline.

Here’s how to change the speed of a clip (onscreen you should have a project with
a clip in a video track in the Timeline window):
1. Click the clip in the video track or select it in the Timeline.
2. Choose Clip ➪Speed. The Clip Speed/Duration dialog box appears.
3. Type a value in the Speed field. Type a value greater than 100 percent to
speed up the clip or type a value between 0 percent and 99 percent to slow
down the clip. If you want to reverse speed, click the Reverse Speed checkbox.
4. Click OK to close the Clip Speed/Duration dialog box and to apply the new
speed.
You can change a clip’s speed in the Timeline window by clicking and dragging on
either edge of the clip with the Rate Stretch tool.
Using the Frame Hold command
Premiere Pro’s Frame Hold command allows you to freeze one frame of a clip so
that the frame appears from the in point to the out point of the clip. You can create
a freeze frame from the in point, the out point, or at Marker point 0:
1. Click the clip in the video track to select it.
2. If you want to freeze at a specific frame other than the in or out point, set
an unnumbered marker for the clip in the Source section of the Monitor
window.
3. Choose Clip ➪Video Options ➪Frame Hold. This opens the Frame Hold
Options dialog box, shown in Figure 13-15.
4. In the pop-up menu, choose whether to create the freeze frame on the In
Point, Out Point, or at Marker 0.
5. Click the Hold On check box.
6. If you want to prevent keyframe effects from being viewed, click the Hold
Filters check box.
7. To remove the effects of video interlacing, click the Deinterlace check box.
This deletes one of the fields and replaces it with a duplicate of the other field.

Summary
Premiere Pro provides numerous tools and commands that enable you to quickly and
precisely edit a digital video production. Premiere Pro’s editing tools can be found in
the Timeline toolbox. Most other editing utilities reside in the Monitor window.
✦Use the Razor and Multiple Razor tools to snip a clip into two pieces.
✦Use the Ripple Edit and Rolling Edit tools to change the in and out points of
clips in the Timeline. A ripple edit changes the project duration; a rolling edit
does not.
✦You can click and drag with the Slip or Slide tools to edit the in and out points
of a clip in between two other clips. The Slip tool does not change project
duration; the Slide tool does.
✦Use the Monitor window to create three- and four-point edits.
✦Use the Trim window to precisely shave frames from clips.
✦Use the Clip commands to change clip speed and duration.
✦Create duplicate clips to use the same clip with different names in the
Timeline.

Using Video
Effects
A
dobe Premiere Pro’s special effects can wake up even
the dullest video production. Using the video effects in
Premiere Pro’s Effects window, for example, you can blur or
skew images and add bevels, drop shadows, and painterly
effects. Some effects can correct and enhance video; others
can make it seem as though the video is out of control. By
changing controls for the effects, you can also create startling
motion effects, such as making it appear as if an earthquake
or tornado has struck your clip.
As this chapter illustrates, Premiere Pro’s video effects work
in sync with the keyframe track, enabling you to change effect
settings at specific points on the Timeline. All you need to do
is specify the settings for the start of an effect, move to
another keyframe, and set the ending effect. When you create
a preview, Premiere Pro does the rest: It interpolates the video
effect, editing all the in-between frames to create a fluid effect
over time.
If you haven’t been adding effects to your video, this chapter
provides everything you need to get up and running. You’ll
explore every video effect in the Effects window and see how
the Effect Controls window enables you to change effect set-
tings. You’ll also have a chance to practice creating effects
with keyframes and image mattes with sample clips from the
DVD-ROM that accompanies this book.
If you’ve already started working with Premiere Pro effects,
this chapter shows how to use Premiere Pro’s keyframe track
and provides a reference for every effect in the Effects window.

Exploring the Video Effects
Premiere Pro’s Effects window is a storehouse of video effects. However, before you
begin to use the effects, you should become familiar with the window interface. To
display the Effects window, choose Window ➪Effects. The Effects window, shown in
Figure 14-1, not only contains the Video Effects, but also the Audio Effects, the
Audio Transitions, and Video Transitions. To view the Video Effects, click the trian-
gle to the left of the Video Effects folder that is the Effects window. Within the Video
Effects folder are 14 folders that contain different video effects.
Figure 14-1: Premiere Pro’s Effects window 
provides access to Premiere’s video effects.
Open a folder within the Video Effects folder to view a video effect. After the folder
is open, a list of effects appears. An icon to the left of the video effect’s name repre-
sents each effect. After you’ve opened a folder, you can apply a video effect to a
video track by clicking and dragging it over a clip in the Timeline window. To close
a folder, click the triangle to the left of the folder.
Navigating within the video effects
The Effects window features options that can help you keep organized while using
Premiere Pro’s many video effects. The following is a brief description of these
options:
✦Find. The Contains field at the top of the Effects window helps locate effects.
In the Contains field, type the name of the effect that you want to find.
Premiere Pro automatically starts the search.

317
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
✦New Custom Folder. When you create custom folders, you can use them to
organize effects. To create a custom folder, either click the folder icon at the
bottom of the Effects window or click the Effects pop-up menu and choose
New Custom Bin. After you create a folder, drag the effects into it. With all of
your chosen effects in one folder, you’ll find that they are easier to use and
locate.
✦Rename. You can change a name of a custom folder at any time by selecting
the folder and then clicking on the name. When the name of the folder is high-
lighted, type the name that you want in the Name field.
✦Delete. If you have finished using a custom folder, you can delete it by select-
ing it and then choosing the Delete Custom Item from the Effects pop-up menu
or by clicking on the Delete icon at the bottom of the window. A prompt
appears asking whether you want to delete the item. If you do, click Yes.
The Effect Controls window
When you apply a video effect to an image, the effect appears in the Effect Controls
window, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-2: The settings for a video effect 
appear in the Effect Controls window after 
a video effect is applied to a clip.
At the top of the window, the name of the selected clip appears. To the right of the
clip name is a button that enables you to create and/or show or hide keyframes
over a Timeline. At the bottom left of the Effect Controls window is a time display
showing you where the clip appears in the Timeline. To the right of the time display
are options allowing you to zoom out or in.

318
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Below the name of the selected sequence and clip name appears the Fixed Effects
heading. Below the Fixed Effects heading appears the Fixed Effects options —
Motion and Opacity. If a video effect has been applied to the selected clip, the Video
Effects heading is displayed below the Opacity option. All the video effects that
have been applied to the selected clip are displayed below the Video Effects head-
ing. The video effects appear in the order in which the video effect has been
applied. To the left of the Fixed Effects (Motion and Opacity) and a Video Effects
name appears a box with an f in it. The f means that this effect is enabled. You can
disable the effect by clicking the f or deselecting Effect Enabled in the Effect
Controls pop-up menu. Also next to the effect name is a small triangle. If you click
the triangle, the settings for that effect appear.
Many clips also feature a dialog box that includes a preview area. If the effect pro-
vides a dialog box, you will see a little dialog box icon to the right of the name of
the video effect in the Effect Controls window. Click the icon to access the Setup
dialog box. Many effects can be applied with Premiere Pro’s keyframe option. If so,
a small stopwatch will be shown in front of the name of the effect. To enable
keyframing, click the small stopwatch icon. After you click, a small blue frame
appears around the stopwatch icon. (Keyframing is explained later in this chapter.)
The Effect Controls menu
The Effect Controls pop-up menu provides control over all the clips in the window.
The menu enables you to turn previewing on and off and to select preview quality
as well as to enable and disable effects. The following is a brief description of the
Effect Controls menu commands:
✦Effect Enabled. Click this command to disable or enable effects. By default,
Effect Enabled is selected.
✦Delete Selected Effect. This command removes the selected effect from 
the clip.
You can remove an effect from the window by selecting it in the Effect Controls
window, then pressing Delete.
✦Delete All Effects from Clip. This command removes all effects from the clip.
The Audio commands in the Effect Controls menu are covered in Chapters 8 and 9.
Applying a Video Effect
You can apply one video effect or multiple video effects to an entire video clip by
dragging the effect from the Effects window to the Timeline. The video effects allow
you to change the color of a clip, blur it, or even distort it.

section.
Applying a video effect to a 
clip with an alpha channel
Not only can you apply an effect to a video clip, but you can also apply an effect to
a still image that has an alpha channel. To apply an effect to just an image and not
its background, it must have an alpha channel. You can use Adobe Photoshop to
mask an image and save the mask either as an alpha channel or a layer. For more
information on creating alpha channels using Photoshop, turn to Chapter 27.
Here’s how to apply a video effect to a Photoshop file with an alpha channel:
If you want to apply an effect to an image with an alpha channel, you can apply
video effects to the Airplane.psd image (shown in Figure 14-3) and use Digital
Vision’s Drifting Skies 386022f.mov as the background. They are found in the
Chapter 14 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompa-
nies this book.
Before you start, either load the video effects project from the previous section or
create a new project and import a video clip and drag it into Video track 1. We used
Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies 386022f.mov as the background. It is found in the
Chapter 14 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompa-
nies this book.
1. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects to display all the palettes and win-
dows you will need.
2. Choose File ➪Import to load a Photoshop file with an alpha channel.
3. In the Import dialog box, locate a Photoshop file that has an alpha channel
so that only the image and not the background are imported. We used the
Airplane.psd image (found on the DVD that accompanies this book). After
you’ve located the file, click Open. In the Import Layered File dialog box, make
sure Footage is selected in the Import As pop-up menu and select the Choose
Layer option. In the Choose Layer pop-up menu, choose Alpha Channel or the
appropriate channel.
4. Click OK. The Photoshop file and its alpha channel appear in the Project 
window.

5. Drag the still image with an alpha channel (the airplane image) from the
Project window to Video track 2. Place it directly above the background clip
in Video track 1. The Timeline Marker should be over both clips.
6. Double-click the airplane image in the Timeline window to display it in the
Monitor window. On one side of the Monitor window the Photoshop file (air-
plane image) appears on a black background. On the other side of the image,
the Photoshop file (airplane image) appears over the selected background
from Video track 1, as shown in Figure 14-5. The Photoshop file (airplane
image) from Video track 2 takes on the background of the clip from Video
track 1 because it has an alpha channel.
Figure 14-5: The Monitor window on one side displays the Photoshop file with 
an alpha channel. On the other side, you can see the Photoshop file over a sky
background. The background clip is in Video track 1 of the Timeline window, and
the Photoshop file is in Video track 2. 
7. To see the Photoshop alpha channel, click the Monitor window pop-up
menu and choose Alpha. Figure 14-6 shows the Photoshop alpha channel. To
return to standard view, click Composite from the pop-up menu.

9. Drag the desired video effect from the Effects window onto the Photoshop
file (airplane image) in Video track 2 or into the Effect Controls window. In
our example, we applied the Emboss effect, which is found in the Stylize
folder. We also applied the Drop Shadow and Bevel Edges effects found in the
Perspective folder. In the next section, we apply the Basic 3D effect, found in
the Perspective folder, by setting keyframes. By setting keyframes, you can
change the effect over time. Proceed to the next section if you want to learn
how to use video effects with keyframes.

Using Video Effects with Keyframes
Premiere Pro’s keyframe feature enables you to change video effects at specific
points in the Timeline. With keyframes, you can have Premiere Pro use the settings
of an effect at one point on the Timeline, gradually changing to the settings at
another point on the Timeline. When Premiere Pro creates the preview, it interpo-
lates the effect over time, rendering all the frames that change in between the set
points. Keyframing can be used to make video clips or stills more interesting. You
can also import a still image of your logo and animate it using keyframes. If you
want, you can use Adobe Premiere Pro’s Title Designer window to create a logo. To
learn how to create a logo using Premiere Pro, refer to Chapter 11.
Figure 14-7 shows frames of the airplane image from the previous sections, ani-
mated over a sky background video clip. The airplane image is animated using the
Basic 3D effect found in the Perspective folder. To make the airplane swivel and tilt
to its original state, we set keyframes.
The keyframe track
Premiere Pro’s keyframe track makes creating, editing, and manipulating keyframes
quick, logical, and precise. The keyframe track is found in both the Timeline win-
dow and the Effect Controls window. Figure 14-8 shows the Timeline window with
the keyframe track. Figure 14-9 shows the Effect Controls window with the keyframe
track. To view the keyframe track in the Timeline window, expand the track by click-
ing the track’s Expand button. To view the keyframe track in the Effect Controls
window, make sure the Show/Hide Keyframes button is activated.
The keyframe track does not appear if you do not have a clip in the track.

cates a keyframe exists at the current Timeline frame. Clicking the right arrow icon
(Go to Previous Keyframe) jumps the Timeline Marker from one keyframe to the
next. Clicking the left arrow (Go to Next Keyframe) moves the Timeline Marker
backward from one keyframe to the next.
Here’s how to apply an effect to a clip using keyframes:
1. Before you start, load the Video Effects project from the previous section or
create a new project and import a background video clip for Video track 1
and import a still image or logo (that has an alpha channel) for Video track
2. We used Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies 386022f.mov as the background and
the Airplane.psd for Video track 2. They are found in the Chapter 14 folder
that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.
If you want, you can use the Airplane.psd image in Video track 2 and use Digital
Vision’s Drifting Skies 386022f.mov as the background (Video track 1). They are
found in the Chapter 14 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD
that accompanies this book.
2. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects to display all the palettes and win-
dows you will need.
Using an image in Video track 2 that has an alpha channel will allow a background
clip that is in Video track 1 to show through when previewed in the Monitor win-
dow. To see a preview in the Monitor window, click the Play button. To superim-
pose two video clips without alpha channels you need to used the Keying Effects.
The Keying Effects are briefly discussed in the next section. For a full description on
these effects, turn to Chapter 15.
3. Add an effect to the image in Video track 2 by clicking on an effect in the
Effects window and then dragging it to the clip in the Timeline window. If
you are animating a logo, for an unusual effect, you might want to try the
Twirl effect. The Twirl effect is found in the Distort folder, in the Video Effects
folder that is in the Effects window. In Figures 14-7, 14-8, and 14-9, we used the
Basic 3D effect.
4. To create a keyframe for the effect you applied in Step 3 using the Timeline
window, move the Timeline Marker (edit line) over the first frame of the
image in Video track 2.

Superimposing Video Clips Using 
the Keying Video Effects
To superimpose two video clips that don’t have alpha channels, you’ll need to use
the Keying video effects. Figure 14-10 shows the windows and palettes we used to
create a project using the Chroma Key effect. To create the project, we superim-
posed two video clips: a graphic video clip in Video track 2 and a sky background in
Video track 1. In Video track 3, we used an Adobe Photoshop file with an alpha
channel so that you could see the backgrounds from the clips in Video tracks 1 and
2. Figure 14-10 shows the Monitor window with a frame of the final result of the
three clips from the three video tracks superimposed onto one another.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
In the project in Figure 14-10, we used the sky background and an Adobe Photoshop
file with an alpha channel from the previous section. The sky background that we
used is from Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies 386022f.mov. To superimpose a video clip
over the sky background, we moved the Adobe Photoshop file (Airplane.mov) from
Video track 2 to Video track 3. Then we imported a new video clip (Digital Vision’s
Ambient Space clip 434002f.mov) and dragged it into Video track 2, as shown in
Figure 14-10. To jazz up our project, we added sound. The sound file we used is
Digital Vision’s The Acoustic Chillout 730007aw.wav.
The video clips used to create the project shown in Figure 14-10 are found in the
Chapter 14 folder in the Tutorial Projects folder that is located on the DVD that
accompanies this book. The clips are Airplane.mov, Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies
386022f.mov, Digital Vision’s Ambient Space clip 434002f.mov, and Digital
Vision’s The Acoustic Chillout clip 730007aw.wav.
Here’s how to superimpose two video clips using the Chroma Key video effects:
1. Choose File ➪Open Project to open the project from the previous section or
Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project.
2. Your project onscreen should have two video clips and a third image with
an alpha channel. Choose File ➪Import to import the necessary clips. If you
are using a new project, you will need to import three files. If you are using the
project from the previous section, you’ll need to import one new video clip.
We used Digital Vision’s Ambient Space clip 434002f.mov. This video clip is
located on the DVD that accompanies this book.
3. Now you are ready to drag the clips from the Project window to the
Timeline window. If you are using a new project, you’ll need to drag a back-
ground video clip from the Project window to Video track 1. Then drag
another video clip into Video track 2 and the clip with an alpha channel into
Video track 3. This clip should have an alpha channel so that the background
shows through. If you are using the project from the previous section, move
the Airplane file with the alpha channel from Video track 2 to Video track 3.
Note that all the effects remain with the video clip as you move it. Then drag
the new video clip into Video track 2. The video clip in Video track 2 should
be directly above the video clip in Video track 1. If the video clip in Video
track 2 is not as long as the one in Video track 1, you may want to copy the
video clip in Video track 2 and paste a copy next to it.
4. To superimpose the clips in Video Tracks 1 and 2, we used the Chroma Key
effect from the Keying folder and reduced the opacity. To apply the Chroma
Key effect to clip in Video track 2, select the Chroma Key effect from the
Effects window and drag it over the clip in Video track 2.
5. Use the Effect Controls window to adjust the settings of the effect. As you
work, you can preview the effect in the Monitor window. Start by clicking on

Applying Effects to Different Image Areas
Using the Image Matte Keying Effect
You can use an image matte to show an effect only in specific areas of a clip. When
you apply a matte, Premiere Pro masks out the areas that you don’t want shown.
An image matte is either a black-and-white image or a grayscale image. By default,
Adobe Premiere Pro applies effects to the clip areas corresponding to white portions
of the matte. (The effect does not appear in clip regions corresponding to black
areas.) In the gray areas, the effect is applied with some degree of transparency —
Note

332
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
which means that the areas where the effect is applied appear to be see-through to
some extent.
You can use Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Procreate Painter, or even Adobe
Premiere Pro’s Title Designer window to create an image matte. After you’ve cre-
ated an image matte, you need two clips, one for Video track 1 and one for Video
track 2. If you don’t have an image matte or video clips, you can use any of the sam-
ple files found on the DVD that accompanies this book. Figure 14-11 shows the win-
dows and palettes used to create an Image Matte project. The clips used in Figure
14-11 are from Digital Vision’s Electro clip 579020f.mov and Digital Vision’s CityMix
clip 567017f.mov.
Figure 14-11: Frames from the sample image matte project using the emboss effect 
only on a certain area of the clip (outside the arrow).
Here’s how to apply an effect using an image matte:
1. Open or create a new project.
Refer to Chapter 4 for information on choosing a project preset.
2. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects to display all the windows and
palettes you’ll need.
3. Import two video clips into the Project window.
Note

333
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
The clips used to create the project in Figure 14-11 are in the Digital Vision folder
in the Chapter 14 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder located on the DVD
that accompanies this book. The images are from Digital Vision’s Electro clip
579020f.mov and Digital Vision’s CityMix clip 567017f.mov. The matte image
used in the project is called arrow.psd and is in the Chapter 14 folder.
4. Click and drag one of the video clips from the Project window to Video
track 1 of the Timeline window. The video clip in Video track 1 will be the
clip that appears inside the matte. We used Digital Vision’s CityMix clip
567017f.mov in Video track 1.
5. Click and drag the other video clip to Video track 2. The video clip in Video
track 2 will be the clip that appears in the background of the matte. We used
Digital Vision’s Electro clip 579020f.mov in Video track 2.
6. Apply an effect to Video track 2 by dragging an effect from the Effects win-
dow to the clip. If you want, you can apply a different effect to the video clip
in Video track 1. If you apply the effect to Video track 2, however, the effect
can only be seen outside the matte image. If you apply the effect to Video
track 1, the effect is only seen in the inside of the matte image. We applied the
Alpha Glow effect (found in the Stylize folder) to Video track 2 and the
Crystallize effect (found in the Pixelate folder) to Video track 1.
7. To superimpose Video track 2 over Video track 1, select Video track 2.

Touring Premiere Pro’s Video Effects
Premiere Pro boasts 78 video effects that are divided into 14 folders. The folders
are Adjust, Blur & Sharpen, Channel, Distort, Image Control, Keying, Perspective,
Pixelate, Render, Sample Plug-ins, Stylize, Time, Transform, and Video. That’s a lot
of video effects to choose from. To help you deal with this overwhelming wealth of
video effects, we’ve assembled a description of each effect according to its cate-
gory folder.
The Keying effects will be discussed in detailed in Chapter 15.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Before undertaking a tour of the effects, remember that many effects provide pre-
views in dialog boxes. If an effect provides a dialog box, click the Setup dialog box
icon in the Effect Controls window to see a preview.
Although most effects can be controlled by sliders that you click and drag, you can
also click underlined values at the center of the slider to set effects. When you click
the underlined value, a dialog box appears showing the largest and smallest val-
ues allowed in the slider setting.
If you want, you can experiment with the different video effects by applying 
them to one of the video clips in the Tutorial Projects folder located on the DVD
that accompanies the book. In the figures within this section, we used the
Plane&Background.psd image. It is located in the Chapter 14 folder.
The Adjust folder
The Adjust folder enables you to adjust the color attributes of selected clips, such
as the brightness and contrast of an image. If you are familiar with Adobe
Photoshop, you’ll find that several Premiere Pro video effects, such as Channel
Mixer, Levels, and Posterize, are quite similar to filters found in Adobe Photoshop.
Brightness and Contrast
Using the Brightness and Contrast effects is an easy way to adjust brightness and
contrast in your image. Brightness controls how light or dark your image is.
Contrast controls the difference between the brightest and darkest pixels in an
image. In the Effect Controls window, click and drag the Brightness slider to
increase or reduce an image’s brightness, and click and drag the Contrast slider to
add or subtract contrast from an image.
Channel Mixer
The Channel Mixer effect enables you to create special effects by mixing colors
from a clip’s channels. With the Channel Mixer you create color effects, as well as
turn a color image into a grayscale image or into an image with a sepia tone or tint
effect.
To use the Channel Mixer, click and drag any Source Channel slider in the Effect
Controls window to the left to decrease the amount of color supplied to the image.
Click and drag to the right to increase it.
To convert an image to grayscale, click the Monochrome button and then adjust the
sliders.
Convolution Kernel
The Convolution Kernel effect uses mathematical convolution to change brightness
values of clip. This effect can be used to increase sharpness or enhance image
edges. The matrix of numbers in the Convolution Kernel Settings dialog box, shown
in Figure 14-12, represents the pixels in the image. The center pixel text field is the

pixel being analyzed. In the center box, enter the number that you want to use as
the brightness multiplier. In other words, if you enter 2, the pixel’s brightness val-
ues are doubled. The same concept applies for neighboring text fields. You can
enter a brightness multiplier in the surrounding boxes — you can also enter 0 to
have no increase in the brightness value.
Figure 14-12: The Convolution Kernel Settings 
dialog box.
Values entered in the Scale box are used to divide the sum of the brightness values.
If desired, enter a value in the Offset field, which is the same as the value added to
the Scale field.
When using the Convolution Kernel filter, you can save settings by clicking the Save
button; you can reload saved settings by clicking the Load button.
Extract
The Extract filter removes the color from a clip to create a black-and-white effect.
The Input and Output sliders in the Extract Settings dialog box, shown in Figure
14-13, enables you to control which image areas are affected. The Softness slider
softens the effect. The preview area provides a good idea of the result of the effect.
Figure 14-13: The Extract Settings dialog box.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Levels
The Levels effect enables you to correct highlights, midtones, and shadows in an
image. To apply the same levels to all color channels, leave the pop-up menu in the
Levels Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-14, set to RGB. Otherwise, click to
choose a red, green, or blue channel to apply the effect to.
Figure 14-14: The Levels Settings dialog box.
To complete your image correction, use the input slider to increase contrast. Drag
the middle slider to raise or lower midtone values. Drag the output slider to
decrease contrast.
Posterize
Posterize creates special color effects by reducing the tonal level in the red, green,
and blue color channels. Click and drag the Levels amount in the Effect Controls
window to set how many levels of color are in an image.
ProcAmp
The Brightness and Contrast options for the ProAmp effect allow for an easy way to
adjust brightness and contrast in your image. Brightness controls how light or dark
your image is. Contrast controls the difference between the brightest and darkest
pixels in an image. In the Effect Controls window, click and drag the Brightness
option to the right to increase the image’s brightness and drag to the left to reduce
an image’s brightness. Click and drag the Contrast option right or the left to add or
subtract contrast from an image. Click and drag on the Hue values to change the
color of your image. Click and drag the Saturation option to the right to make the
colors more vibrant. Drag the Saturation option to the left to 0 to take all the colors
out of your image and make it a grayscale image. The Split Screen option allows you
to apply the effect to only a portion of the image. The Split Percent value deter-
mines how much of the image is affected.

337
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
The Blur & Sharpen folder
The Blur effects contain options that allow you to blur images. Using blur effects,
you can create motion effects or blur out a video track as a background to empha-
size the foreground. The Sharpen effects enable you to sharpen images. Sharpening
helps bring out image edges when digitized images or graphics appear too soft.
Anti-alias
The Anti-alias effect reduces jagged lines by blending image edges of contrasting
colors to create a smooth edge.
Camera Blur
By using this effect with keyframes, you can simulate an image going in or out of
focus. You can also simulate a “camera bump” effect. Use the Blur slider in the
Camera Blur Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-15, to control the effect.
Figure 14-15: The Camera Blur Settings dialog box.
Channel Blur
The Channel Blur effect enables you to blur an image using the Red, Green, Blue
Channel, or Alpha channel. By default, the Blur Dimension pop-up is set to
Horizontal and Vertical. At the default setting, any blurring you do affects the image
horizontally and vertically. If you want to blur only one dimension, set the pop-up
menu to either Horizontal or Vertical. When the Edge Behavior/Repeat Edge Pixels
option is deselected, the edges around the clip are blurred. When it is selected,
they are not.
Directional Blur
The Directional Blur effect creates a motion effect by blurring an image in a specific
direction. The sliders in the Effect Controls window control the direction and the
length of the blur.

338
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Fast Blur
Use the Fast Blur effect to quickly blur a clip. Use the Blur Dimension pop-up menu
in the Effect Controls window to specify whether the blur should be vertical, hori-
zontal, or both.
Gaussian Blur
The Gaussian Blur effect blurs video and reduces video signal noise. Similarly to the
Fast Blur effect, you can specify whether the blur should be vertical, horizontal, or
both. The word “gaussian” is used because the filter uses a gaussian (bell-shaped)
curve when removing contrast to create the blur effect.
Gaussian Sharpen
Apply the Gaussian Sharpen effect to create strong, overall sharpening. You can
obtain similar results by applying the Sharpen filter several times. This effect pro-
vides no controls.
Ghosting
The Ghosting effect layers image areas from previous frames over one frame. Use
this to show the path of a moving object — such as a speeding bullet or a pie
thrown in the air.
Radial Blur
This effect creates a circular blurring effect. The Radial Blur dialog box, shown in
Figure 14-16, lets you control the degree of blurring. To do so, increase the value in
the Amount field by dragging the Amount slider to the right. In the Blur Method
area, choose Spin to create a spinning blur; choose Zoom to create an outward blur.
In the Quality section, choose Draft, Good, or Best. However, remember that the
better the quality, the more processing time needed to create the effect.
Figure 14-16: The Radial Blur dialog box.

339
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
Sharpen
The Sharpen effect includes a value that enables you to control sharpening within
your clip. Click and drag the Sharpen Amount value in the Effect Controls window
to the right to increase sharpening. The slider permits values from 0 to 100; how-
ever, if you click the underlined sharpen amount onscreen, you can enter values up
to 4000 into the Value field.
Sharpen Edges
The Sharpen Edges effect applies sharpening effects on image edges.
The Channel folder
The Channel folder contains two effects — Blend and Invert. Use Blend to blend
video clips based on color modes. Use Invert to invert the color values within a clip.
Blend
The Blend effect allows you to blend video tracks using different modes: Crossfade,
Color Only, Tint Only, Darken Only, and Lighten Only. The Blend with Original
option is used to specify which clip you want to blend with. For example, if you
apply the Blend effect to a clip in Video track 1A and want to blend it with a clip in
Video track 1B, set the Blend with Layer pop-up menu to V1B. For both clips to
appear translucent, set the Blend with Original value to 50%. In order to see both
clips in the Monitor window, they must be selected with the Timeline Marker. If you
apply the Blend effect to a clip in Video track 1A and want to blend it with a clip in
Video track 2, set the Blend with Layer pop-up menu to V2. Then hide Video track 2
by clicking on the Eye icon in the Timeline window. In order to see both clips in the
Monitor window, they must be selected with the Timeline Marker and the Blend
with Original value should be set to less than 90%.
Invert
The Invert effect inverts color values. You can turn black into white, white into
black, and colors into their complements.
The Channel pop-up menu in the Effect Controls window enables you to choose a
color model: RGB, HLS, or YIQ. YIQ is the NTSC color space. Y refers to luminance; I
refers to inphase chrominance; Q refers to quadrature chrominance. The alpha
choice enables you to invert the gray levels in an alpha channel. Use the Blend with
Original slider if you want to blend the channel effect with the original image.
The Distort folder
The Distort commands, found in the Distort folder, enable you to distort an image
either by twirling, pinching, or spherizing it. Many of these commands are similar to
the distort filters found in Adobe Photoshop.

340
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Bend
The Bend effect can bend your image in various directions. In the Bend Settings dia-
log box, which is shown in Figure 14-17, use the Intensity, Rate, and Width sliders to
control effects for Horizontal and Vertical Bending. Intensity is the wave height;
Rate is the frequency; Width is the width of the wave. The Direction pop-up menu
controls the direction of the effect. The Wave pop-up menu specifies the type of
wave: sine, circle, triangle, or square.
Figure 14-17: The Bend Settings dialog box.
Corner Pin
The Corner Pin effect allows you to distort an image by adjusting the Upper Left,
Upper Right, Lower Left, and Lower Right values. Figure 14-18 shows an image after
applying this effect.

Lens Distortion
Use the Lens Distortion effect to simulate video being viewed through a distorted
lens.
Use the Curvature slider in the Lens Distortion Settings dialog box, shown in Figure
14-19, to change the lens curve. Negative values make the curvature more concave
(inward); positive values make the curvature more convex (outward). Vertical and
Horizontal Decentering sliders change the focal point of the lens.

dialog box.
Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX creates effects similar to changing Vertical and
Horizontal Decentering. Use the Fill color swatch to change the background color.
Click the Fill Alpha Channel check box to make background areas transparent
based on the clip’s alpha channel.
Mirror
Mirror creates a mirrored effect. In the Effect Controls window, click the Reflection
center values to open the Edit Reflection Center dialog box to designate the X and Y
coordinates of the reflection line. The reflection angle option enables you to choose
where the reflection appears. The following degree settings should help orient you
to how dragging the slider distorts the image:
✦0. Left onto right side
✦90. Right onto left side
✦180. Top onto bottom
✦270. Bottom onto top

Pinch
Pinch provides an effect similar to pinching and pulling the video image as if it were
clay. In the Pinch Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-20, click and drag the
amount slider to the right to pinch the image in; click and drag to the left to expand
the image out. Figure 14-19 shows a frame after the Pinch effect is applied.
Figure 14-20: The Pinch Settings dialog box.
Polar Coordinates
Polar Coordinates can create a variety of unusual effects by changing the clip’s X
and Y coordinates to polar coordinates. In the polar coordinate system, the X and Y
coordinates are distances radiating out of a focal point. By using this effect, you can
transform a line into a half circle or horseshoe shape.
In the Effect Controls window, the Interpolation value controls the amount of the
distortion — 0% provides no distortion; 100 % provides the most. In the Type of
Conversion pop-up menu, Rect to Polar converts horizontal coordinates to Polar;
Polar to Rect converts polar coordinates to rectangular ones. Figure 14-21 shows
the Polar Coordinates effect with the Rect to Polar options selected.
Ripple
The Ripple effect turns a clip into rippled patterns. The Ripple Settings dialog box,
shown in Figure 14-22, enables you to adjust the ripples on a horizontal and vertical
plane and control the intensity and frequency of the ripples.

channel to determine image edges. Sliders enable you to control the shadow’s opac-
ity, direction, and distance from the original clip. You can change the light color by
clicking the color swatch in the window and choosing a color from Premiere Pro’s
Color Picker window.
The Pixelate folder
The effects found in the Pixelate folder create special effects by shifting, moving,
and remapping pixels and their color values. These effects can create dramatic
color distortions in your image.
Crystallize
The Crystallize effect can create a crystal-like effect in your image by shifting colors
that are similar together into a grid. The size of the grid is controlled by the Cell
Size slider in the Crystallize Setting dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-34.
Figure 14-34: The Crystallize Settings dialog box.
Facet
The Facet effect creates a painterly effect by grouping similarly colored pixels
together within a clip.
Pointillize
The Pointillize effect simulates a pointillist painting by making your clip appear as if
it were created with tiny dots. You can make the dots bigger or smaller by changing
the value in the Cell Size field in the Pointillize Settings dialog box, which is shown
in Figure 14-35.

The Render folder
The Render folder features the Lens Flare effect, which is similar to Adobe
Photoshop’s Lens Flare filter.
Lens Flare
The Lens Flare effect creates a flaring light effect in your image. In the Lens Flare
Settings dialog box, use the mouse to pick the image position of the flare in the
Preview area. Click and drag the slider to adjust flare brightness and then pick a lens:
Zoom, 35 mm, or 105 mm. Figure 14-36 shows the Lens Flare Settings dialog box.
Figure 14-36: The Lens Flare Settings dialog box.
Lightning
The Lightning effect enables you to add lightning to a clip. With the Lightning set-
ting, you can choose starting and ending points for the lightning. Moving the
Segment slider to the right increases the amount of segments the lightning has.
Moving the Segment slider to the left decreases the amount of segments.

354
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Conversely, moving the other Lightning effect sliders to the right increases the
effect; moving the slider to the left decreases it. You can stylize your lightning bolt
by adjusting the Segments, Amplitude, Branching, Speed, Stability, Width, Force,
and Blending Mode options. Figure 14-37 shows a lightning bolt created using the
Lightning effect.
Figure 14-37: Image after applying the Lightning effect and Lighting 
options shown in the Effect Controls window.
Ramp
The Ramp effect allows you to create linear or radial blurs. Click the Ramp Shape
pop-up menu to choose either Radial Ramp or Linear Ramp. You can set the start
and end colors of the blur by clicking a color in your image and using the
Eyedropper tool or by clicking the color swatch and using the Color Picker dialog
box. Moving the Ramp Scale slider to the left creates a smoother blend. When the
Blend Witness slider is set to 50, both the blend and image clip you are applying the
effect to are set to 50% translucency. Moving the slider to the right makes the image
clip more opaque. Moving the slider to the left makes the blend less opaque.
The Stylize folder
The effects found in the Stylize folder create a variety of effects that change images
without creating major distortions. For example, the Emboss effect adds depth
throughout your image, whereas the Tiles effect divides your image into mosaic
tiles.

355
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
Alpha Glow
The Alpha Glow effect adds a glowing effect around alpha channel edges. In the
Alpha Glow Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-38, use the Glow slider to con-
trol how far the glow extends from the alpha channel. Use the Brightness slider to
increase and decrease brightness.
Figure 14-38: The Alpha Glow Settings dialog box.
In the dialog box, the Start color swatch represents the glow color. If you want to
change the color, click the color swatch and choose a color from Premiere Pro’s
Color Picker window.
If you choose an end color, Premiere Pro adds an extra color at the edge of the glow.
To create an end color, select the End color check box and click the color swatch to
pick the color in the Color Picker window. To fade out the start color, click the Fade
Out check box.
Color Emboss
The Color Emboss effect creates the same effect as Emboss (described next),
except that it doesn’t remove color.
Emboss
The Emboss effect creates a raised 3D effect from image edge areas in a clip. In the
Effect Controls window, use the Direction slider to control the angle of the emboss-
ing. Drag the Relief slider to raise the emboss level to create a greater emboss
effect. To create a more pronounced effect, add more contrast by dragging the
Contrast slider to the right. Use the Blend with Original slider to blend shading of
the embossing with the clip’s original image.

356
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Find Edges
Find Edges can make the image in a clip look as if it is a black-and-white sketch. The
effect seeks out image areas of high contrast and turns them into black lines that
appear against a white background, or as colored lines with a black background. In
the Effect Controls window, use the Blend with Original slider to blend the lines
with the original image. Figure 14-39 shows a preview of the Find Edges effect.
Figure 14-39: A preview of the Find Edges effect.
Mosaic
The Mosaic effect turns your image areas into rectangular tiles. In the Effect
Controls window, enter the number of mosaic blocks in the Horizontal/Vertical
blocks field. This effect can be animated for use as a transition, where normally the
average of the colors in the other video track is used to pick tile color. However, if
you choose the Sharp color option, Premiere Pro uses the pixel color in the center
of the corresponding region in the other video track. Figure 14-40 shows a preview
of the Mosaic effect.
Noise
The Noise effect randomly changes colors in a video clip to give your clip a grainy
appearance. In the Effect Controls window, use the Amount of Noise slider to desig-
nate how much “noise,” or graininess, you want added to the clip. The more noise
you add, the more your image disappears into the noise you create.
If you choose the Color Noise option, the effect randomly changes the pixels in the
image. If Color Noise is turned off, the same amount of noise is added to each red,
green, and blue channel in the image.

357
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
Figure 14-40: A preview of the Mosaic effect.
Clipping is a mathematical stopgap that prevents noise from becoming larger than a
set value. When the Clipping option is not selected, noise values start at lower val-
ues after reaching a certain point. If you turn Clipping off, you may find that your
image completely disappears into the noise.
Replicate
The Replicate effect creates multiple versions of the clip within the frame. The
effect produces this replication effect by creating tiles and placing multiple versions
of the clip into the tiles. Dragging the Replicate Settings Count slider in the
Replicate Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 14-41) to the right increases the num-
ber of tiles on-screen.
Figure 14-41: The Replicate Settings dialog box.

358
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Solarize
The Solarize effect creates a positive and negative version of your image and then
blends them together to create the solarizing effect. This can produce a lightened
version of your image with darkened edges. In the Solarize Settings dialog box,
shown in Figure 14-42, click and drag the Threshold slider to control the brightness
level at which the Solarizing effect begins.
Figure 14-42: The Solarize Settings dialog box.
Strobe Light
The Strobe Light effect creates the illusion of a strobe light flashing at regular or
random intervals in your clip. In the Effect Controls window, click the color swatch
to choose a color for the strobe effect. Enter the duration of the strobe flash in the
Duration field. In the Strobe Period field, enter the duration between strobe effects.
(Duration is measured from the time the last strobe flashed — not when the flash
ends.) If you want to create a random strobe effect, drag the Random Strobe
Probability slider to the right. (The greater the probability setting, the more ran-
dom the effect.)
In the Strobe area of the Effect Controls window, choose Operates on Color only if
you want the strobe effect to be applied to all color channels. Choose Make Layer
Transparent to make the track transparent when the strobe goes off. If you choose
Operates on Color, you can select an arithmetic operator from the Strobe Operator
pop-up menu that can further alter the strobe effect.
If you set the strobe period longer than the strobe duration, the strobe will be 
constant — not flashing.
Note

359
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
Texturize
The Texturize effect can create texture in a clip by applying texture, such as sand or
rocks, found in one track to another track. To choose the video track supplying the
texture, click in the Texture Layer pop-up menu in the Effect Controls window and
choose the track. Click and drag the Light Direction and Contrast slider to create
the best effect. In the Texture Placement pop-up menu, choose Tile Texture to
repeat the texture over the clip. Choose Center Texture to place the texture in the
clip’s center, and then choose Stretch Texture to stretch the text over the entire
frame area.
Tiles
The Tiles effect turns your image into tiles. In the Tiles Settings dialog box, shown
in Figure 14-43, choose how many tiles you want to see and offset the tiles by enter-
ing a percentage in the Tiles Offset field. In the Fill Empty Areas With field, choose
the color you want to appear between the tiles. Background and Foreground colors
fills the space between the tiles with white; Inverse Image uses a negative version of
the clip to fill the space; Unaltered Image simply uses the clip. Figure 14-44 shows a
frame with the Tiles effect applied.

Wind
As you probably guessed, the Wind effect applies a windswept look to your clip. To
create a simple wind effect, choose Wind in the Method area of the Wind Settings
dialog box, shown in Figure 14-45. For a tornado-like blast, choose Blast. The
Stagger choice creates a bit less wind. In the Direction section, choose either From
the Left or From the Right.
Figure 14-45: The Wind Settings dialog box.
The Time folder
The Time folder contains effects that specifically relate to different frames in the
selected clip.
Echo
The Echo effect creates the visual version of an echo, as shown in Figure 14-46. In
other words, frames from the selected clip are repeated again and again. The effect
is only effective in clips that display motion. Depending on the clip, Echo can pro-
duce a repeated visual effect or possibly a streaking type of special effect. In the
Effect Controls window, use the Echo Time slider to control the time between the
repetitions. Drag the Number of Echoes to designate how many frames to combine
for the effect.
Use the Starting Intensity slider to control intensity of the first frame. A setting of 1
provides full intensity; .25 provides quarter intensity. The Decay slider controls
how quickly the echo dissipates. If the Decay slider is set to .25, the first echo 
will be .25 of the starting intensity, the next echo will be .25 of the previous echo,
and so on.

361
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
The Echo operator pop-up menu creates effects by combining the pixel values of
the echoes. Following is a review of the pop-up menu choices:
✦Add. Adds pixel values.
✦Maximum. Uses maximum pixels value of echoes.
✦Minimum. Uses minimum pixel value of echoes.
✦Screen. Similar to Add, but less likely to produce white streaks.
✦Composite in Back. Uses the clip’s alpha channels and composites them
starting at the back.
✦Composite in Front. Uses the clip’s alpha channels and composites them
starting at the front.
To combine an Echo effect with a Motion Settings effect, create a virtual clip and
apply the effect to the virtual clip.
Figure 14-46: A preview of the Echo effect and its settings.
Posterize Time
The Posterize Time effect grabs control of a clip’s frame rate settings and substi-
tutes the frame rate specified in the Effect Controls frame rate slider.
The Transform folder
The Transform folder is filled with Transformation effects from Adobe After Effects
that enable you to flip, crop, and roll a video clip, and change the camera view.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Camera View
The Camera View effect simulates viewing the clip at a different camera angle. In
the Camera View Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-47, use the sliders to con-
trol the effect. Click and drag the Latitude slider to flip the clip vertically. Use the
Longitude slider to flip horizontally. The Roll slider simulates rolling the camera,
thus rotating the clip. Click and drag the Focal Length slider to make the view wider
or narrower. The Distance slider enables you to change the distance between the
imaginary camera and the clip. Use the Zoom slider to zoom in and out. To create a
fill color to use as a background, click the color swatch and choose a color in
Premiere Pro’s Color Picker window. If you want the background area to be trans-
parent, choose Fill Alpha Channel. (The clip must include an alpha channel to use
this option.)
Figure 14-47: The Camera View Settings 
dialog box.
Clip
The Clip effect hides the frame boundaries — similar to a Crop effect, except that
the clip is not resized. The effect can be used to hide noise at image edges.
To use the Clip effect, drag the sliders in the Clipping Settings dialog box, shown in
Figure 14-48, to clip the top, left, bottom, and/or right sides of the clip. Choose
whether you want to clip according to pixels or percent. Click the Fill Color swatch
to open Premiere Pro’s Color Picker and choose a background color.
Crop
The Crop effect provides the same settings as the Clip effect except that with the
Crop effect Premiere Pro resizes the clip according to the dialog box settings.

365
Chapter 14 ✦Using Video Effects
The Video folder
The effects found in the Video folder simulate electronic changes to a video 
signal. These effects need only be applied if you are outputting your production 
to videotape.
Broadcast Colors
If you are outputting your production to videotape, you may want to run the
Broadcast Colors effect to improve color output quality. As we discuss in Chapters
11 and 18, the gamut, or range of video colors, is smaller than the color gamut of a
computer monitor. To use the Broadcast Color effect, choose either NTSC for
American television or PAL for European television in the Broadcast Locale pop-up
menu. Then choose a method in the How to Make Colors Safe pop-up menu.
Following is an explanation of the choices available in this pop-up menu:
✦Reduce Luminance. Reduces pixels’ brightness values, moving the pixel val-
ues toward black.
✦Reduce Saturation. Brings pixel values closer to gray. (This makes the colors
less intense.)
✦Key out Unsafe. Colors that fall beyond the TV gamut become transparent.
✦Key in Safe. Colors that are within the TV gamut are transparent.
In the Maximum Signal Field, enter the IRE breakpoint value. (IRE measures image
luminance.) Any levels above this value are altered. If you are unsure of what value
to use, leave the default setting of 110.
Field Interpolate
The Field Interpolate effect creates missing scan lines from the average of other
lines.
Reduce Interlace Flicker
The Reduce Interlace Flicker effect softens horizontal lines in an attempt to reduce
interlace flicker (an odd or even interlace line that appears during video capture).
Choosing the wrong field settings in the Project Settings dialog box can increase
flicker. To access the Project Settings dialog box, choose Project ➪Project Settings➪
General. These settings are covered in more detail in Chapter 5.

Superimposing
B
y telling a story or providing information using innova-
tive effects, you can ensure that you get your message
across. One of the best techniques for doing so creatively is to
use superimposition options. Adobe Premiere Pro helps you
create sophisticated transparency effects by enabling you to
overlay two or more video clips and then blend the two
together. For more sophisticated effects, the Premiere Pro
Video Effects Keying options provide a host of different effects
that enable you to key out (hide) different parts of the image
area in one track and fill them with the underlying video in the
track beneath it.
This chapter provides a look at two powerful methods of cre-
ating transparency: the Premiere Pro Opacity option and the
Premiere Pro keying options found in the Video Effects folder
of the Effects window. The Opacity option enables you to cre-
ate blending effects by changing the opacity of one video
track. The Keying folder in the Effects window is home to 14
different keying options that enable you to create trans-
parency based on color, alpha channels, or brightness levels.
As you read through this chapter, think about all the different
ways that you can apply the effects in your current or next
project. Using transparency creatively will undoubtedly add
to its success.
If you put a video clip or still in Video track 2 and another in
Video track 1, you will only see the image that is in the top
video track onscreen — in this case, Video track 2. To see both
images, you need to either fade Video track 2 or apply a key-
ing effect to it.
Any video track higher than Video track 1 can be faded using
Premiere Pro’s Opacity option or superimposed using the key-
ing options. Throughout this book, you find various examples
of transparency effects. To review some of these examples,
see Chapter 11, Chapter 17, and Chapter 28.

Fading Video Tracks
You can fade an entire video clip or still image over a video clip or another still
image. The top video clip or still image is faded over the bottom one. When you
fade a video clip or still image, you are changing the opacity of the clip or image.
Any video track, except for Video track 1, can be used as a superimposed track and
can be faded. Premiere Pro’s fade option appears when you expand a video track.
When a video track is expanded, you can display the Opacity by clicking on the
Show Keyframes icon and choosing Show Opacity Handles. The Opacity rubber-
band line is found underneath a clip when the track is expanded.
Fading video tracks works similarly to fading sound tracks. For more information
on fading sound tracks, see Chapter 8.
Here’s how to fade a track:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. Make sure that you use
the proper preset. If you are creating a high-resolution project, you may want
to use a DV preset. If not, use a Non-DV preset.
2. Choose File ➪Import to import two files. Locate either two video clips or a
video clip and a still image. Press and hold the Ctrl key to select more than
one file. Click Open to import the files.
If you want, you can use the two video clips that we used in our fade example,
shown in Figures 15-1 to 15-5. In the DVD that accompanies this book in the
Digital Vision folder that is in the Chapter 15 folder, you will find two Digital
Vision video clips that you can use, Electro 579018F.mov and Electro
579023F.mov, and a sound clip, City Life/Urban Moods 672015aw.wav.
3. When the files appear in the Project window, drag and drop one file to
Video track 2 and the other to Video track 1 in the Timeline window. You
will change the opacity of the clip in Video track 2. Make sure that the files in
the video tracks overlap each other. Select the clip in Video track 2.
4. To zoom into the Timeline, click and drag the time Zoom level slider to the
right. The time Zoom level slider is at the bottom of the Timeline window. You
can also click the Zoom In button or press the equal sign on your keyboard.
5. To expand Video track 2, click the Collapse/Expand Track icon to the left of
the word Video.
6. Click the Show Keyframes icon and choose Show Opacity Handles to
reveal the Opacity rubberband line, shown in Figure 15-1. Notice that a
white line beneath the video clip is displayed.

drag, the Opacity percent value is displayed. The Opacity percent value is
also displayed in the Effect Controls window. To see the Opacity value, click
the Collapse/Expand Track icon to display the Opacity percent value.
To slowly fade a video clip, you need to set the left side of the Opacity rubber-
band line so that it is at the top-left position and drag the far-right side down,
as shown in Figure 15-2. To do so, you need to set two points (handles) on the
Opacity rubberband line: one at the beginning of the clip and one at the end of
the clip.
Figure 15-2: The Opacity rubberband line in the Timeline 
window displays a gradual fade.
8. To set the first point (handle), move the current-time indicator (Edit line) in
the Timeline window to the beginning of the clip and then click the
Add/Remove Keyframes button.
9. To set the second point, move the current-time indicator (Edit line) in the
Timeline window to the end of the clip and click the Add/Remove
Keyframes button.

10. Use the Selection or Pen tool to drag the last handle down. The first handle
should be at 100%. If it isn’t, click the Go to Previous Keyframe button, then
click and drag the handle up.
The fade in Figure 15-2 is gradual because the fade line gradually steps down.
The top of the fade line indicates that the video clip is 100 percent opaque.
When the fade line follows a long, slow, diagonal path from the top of the fade
bar (100 percent opaque) to the bottom (100 percent transparent), the clip
gradually fades out.
11. Choose Window ➪Effect Controls to display the Effect Controls window. To
view the Opacity percent in the Effect Controls window (as shown in Figure
15-3), click the Collapse/Expand Track icon in front of Opacity. Then click the
Previous Keyframe or Next Keyframe button to move the current-time indica-
tor (Edit line) to the Opacity keyframes on the Timeline. You can also drag the
current-time indicator (Edit line) along the Effect Controls Timeline to see the
percent values of the gradual fade.
Figure 15-3: The Effect Controls window shows the 
Opacity percentage value for the selected clip.
12. To preview the fade effect, click the Play button in the Monitor window.
You can also fade clips into one another using transitions. For more information on
working with transitions, see Chapter 10.
13. Before you save you work, you may want to import a sound clip into your
project. If the imported sound clip is too long, use the Razor tool to edit it. For
more information on working with sound, turn to Chapter 8.
Adding opacity handles with the Pen tool
To create more sophisticated fades, you can add more handles to the Opacity rubber-
band line using the Pen tool. After you have handles, you can then drag different
segments of the Opacity rubberband line. Here’s how:

4. If you’ve created too many handles and want to delete one, just click a han-
dle in the Timeline window, then press Delete. You can also click a keyframe
in the Effect Controls window and press Delete.
To delete all the opacity keyframes from a timeline, click the Toggle Animation icon
in the Effect Controls window. When the Warning prompt appears, click OK to
delete all existing keyframes.
5. Click and drag the handle to move up and/or down as shown in Figure 15-4.
When you click the handle, at the bottom of the Pen icon, there should be a
yellow diamond. A plus sign indicates that you are going to add a handle when
you click the Opacity rubberband line. Make sure you see the yellow diamond,
and reposition the mouse more accurately over the handle you want to move.
Use the Go to Previous Keyframe and the Go to Next Keyframe buttons in the
Timeline window to move quickly from one keyframe to another.
6. Use the Effect Controls window to display the fade level percentage, as
shown in Figure 15-5. To display the Effect Controls window, choose Window➪

Adjusting the Opacity rubberband 
line using the Pen tool
The Pen tool enables you to move either an entire Opacity rubberband line as a
unit or move two handles simultaneously. Follow these steps to use the Pen tool to
move two handles simultaneously. 
Before you proceed to Step 1, you should have a Premiere Pro project with a clip
in Video track 2. Video track 2 should be selected and expanded, and the Opacity
rubberband line should be displayed. These steps are covered in the “Fading Video
Tracks” section earlier in this chapter.
1. Use the Pen tool to create two handles on the Opacity rubberband line.
Make the handles so that they appear at the beginning and end of the Opacity
rubberband line. Select the Pen tool.
2. Use the Pen tool to click the Opacity rubberband line to add two more han-
dles. Place the handles in the middle of the clip. Try to spread all the handles
equally apart from each other.

3. Move the Pen tool between the two middle handles. When an up and down
arrow icon appears next to the Pen tool, click the Opacity rubberband line
and drag down. When you click and drag between the two handles, the han-
dles and the Opacity rubberband line between the two handles move as a
unit. The Opacity rubberband line outside the handles gradually moves, as
shown in Figure 15-6.
Figure 15-6: The Opacity rubberband line after being adjusted 
with the Pen tool.
The Pen tool also enables you to move just a section of the Opacity rubberband line
completely separate from the rest. Here’s how:
Before you proceed to Step 1, you should have a Premiere Pro project with a clip
in Video track 2. Video track 2 should be selected and expanded, and the Opacity
rubberband line should be displayed. These steps are covered in the “Fading Video
Tracks” section earlier in this chapter.
1. Start with an Opacity rubberband line that has only a beginning and 
ending handle.
2. Create two handles side by side in the middle of the Opacity rubberband
line.
3. Select the Pen tool, if it is not selected.
4. Use the Pen tool to select the first handle. Then press and hold the Shift key
as you select the second handle.
5. Now click and drag the Opacity rubberband line down. Notice that only the
line between the start of the Opacity rubberband line and second handle
moves, as shown in Figure 15-7. The line moves at a constant percentage.

Superimposing Tracks Using 
the Keying Effects
You can superimpose a video clip and/or still image over another one using the
Keying options, which are found in the Keying folder, which is in the Video Effects
folder in the Effects window. In the Keying folder, you have 14 key types to pick
from. Using the Key options is called keying. Keying makes part of the image trans-
parent. The following sections cover how to use the different key options.
Displaying the Keying effects
To display and experiment with the Keying options, shown in Figure 15-9, you first
need to have a Premiere Pro project onscreen. Either load an existing Premiere Pro
project or create a new one by choosing File ➪New ➪Project. Import two video
clips into the new project.
Figure 15-9: The Keying effects are in the Keying
folder, which is in the Video Effects folder in the
Effects window.
If you want, you can use one of the video clips found in the Chapter 15 folder
that is located in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this
book. Most of the images shown in this chapter are located on the DVD.

Chrome Key
The Chrome Key option in the Keying folder enables you to key out a specific 
color or a range of colors. This key is often planned during preproduction so 
that the video is shot against one colored background. To select the color to key
out, use the Eyedropper tool to click the background area of the image thumbnail.
Alternatively, you can click in the color swatch (under the word Color) and choose
a key color from the Premiere Pro color picker.
To fine-tune the key, click and drag the sliders and make adjustments to the follow-
ing options:
✦Similarity. Click and drag to the left or right to increase or decrease the range
of colors that will be made transparent.
✦Blend. Click and drag to the right to create more of a blend between the two
clips. Dragging to the left produces the opposite effect.
✦Threshold. Clicking and dragging to the right keeps more shadow areas in the
clip. Dragging to the left produces the opposite effect.
✦Cutoff. Clicking and dragging to the right darkens shadow areas. Dragging to
the right lightens shadow areas. Note that if you drag beyond the level set in
the Threshold slider, gray and transparent areas become inverted.
✦Smoothing. This control sets anti-aliasing, which blends pixel colors to create
smoother edges. Choose High for most smoothing, Low for some smoothing,
or None for no smoothing. Choosing None is often the best choice when key-
ing titles.
✦Mask Only. Selecting the Mask Only option causes only the alpha channel of
the clip to be displayed.
Figure 15-10 shows a few frames from a project using the Chroma Key type. The
frames show an athlete jumping  through a yellow-to-pink gradient. To create the
project, we imported a video clip of the athlete into Video track 1 and imported a
still image of a yellow-to-pink gradient into Video track 2. The Timeline window for
the project is shown in Figure 15-11. In Audio track 1, we placed Digital Vision’s
Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav. To apply the Key effect, we selected the still image
in Video track 2 and dragged the Chroma Key effect over it. In the Chroma Key 

380
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
settings, we set the Color to yellow and adjusted the Similarity, Blend, Threshold,
and Cutoff values so that we could see the Athlete jumping through the gradient.
The controls used to create the project (in Figure 15-10) are shown in Figure 15-12.
If you want, you can use the files we used to create the Chroma Key project. The
athlete clip is Digital Vision’s Triangle Sports TRB05005.mov, Digital Vision’s
Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav, and the yellow-and-pink gradient is a
Photoshop file (GRADIENT.psd). The clips are found in the Chapter 15 folder that
is located in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.

RGB Difference Key
The RGB Difference Key is an easy-to-use version of the Chroma Key option. Use
this key when precise keying is not required or when the image being keyed
appears in front of a bright background. As with the Chroma Key, RGB Difference
Key provides Similarity and Smoothing options but does not provide Blend,
Threshold, or Cutoff controls.
Figure 15-13 shows a frame from the clip from the previous section with the RGB
Difference Key type applied instead of the Chroma Key type (as was shown in
Figure 15-10). Notice that the edges of the gradient do not slowly fade out into soft
edges but rather end abruptly. Figure 15-14 shows the Effect Controls window with
the RGB Difference Key settings used in Figure 15-13.

Blue Screen and Green Screen keys
Blue and green are traditional keys used in broadcast television where announcers
are often shown in front of a blue or green background. The Blue Screen keys out
well lit blue backgrounds. The Green Screen keys out well lit green areas. These
keys have the following options:
✦Threshold. Start by dragging to the left to key out more green and blue areas.
✦Cutoff. Click and drag to the right to fine-tune the key effect.
✦Smoothing. This control sets anti-aliasing, which blends pixel colors to create
smoother edges. Choose High for most smoothing, Low for some smoothing,
or None for no smoothing. Choosing None is often the best choice when key-
ing titles.
✦Mask Only. Allows you to choose whether to display the clip’s alpha channel.
Normally when using the Blue or Green Screen Key type, you would videotape a
person or object against either a properly lit blue or green background. This way
you can import the video clip into Premiere Pro and use either the Blue Screen or
Green Screen Key types to remove the background and replace it with any image
your heart desires. In our example of a Green Screen Key type, we used two Digital
Vision video clips: Working Numbers 577010f.mov and NightMoves 705014f.mov.
The Working Numbers clip is pool balls falling onto a green pool top. Frames from
this clip are shown in Figure 15-15. The NightMoves clip is of people playing pool on
a red pool top. Frames from this clip are shown in Figure 15-16. Figure 15-17 shows a
few frames from the Green Screen Key type project.
In Video track 1, we placed the NightMoves 705014f.mov clip. We placed the
Working Numbers 577010f.mov clip in Video track 2 and applied the Green Screen
Key type. In order to see more of the clip in Video track 1, we reduced the Green
Screen Key type Threshold option to 44%. Figure 15-18 shows the Effect Controls
window with the Green Screen Key type options. In the Effect Controls window, you
can see that we applied the Brightness & Contrast Video Effect. The final project
was a little too dark, so we used a Video Effect to lighten it. In Audio track 1, we
placed Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav. Figure 15-19 shows the
Timeline window that we used to create the project. In Audio track 1, we placed
Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav.

Non Red Key
As with the blue and green screens, the Non Red Key is used to key out blue and
green backgrounds, but it does both at once. This key also includes a blending
slider that enables you to blend two clips together.

Luma Key
The Luma Key type keys out darker image areas in a clip. Use the Threshold and
Cutoff sliders to fine-tune the effect, as follows:
✦Threshold. Click and drag to the right to increase the range of darker values
that will be keyed out.
✦Cutoff. Controls the opacity of the Threshold range. Click and drag to the
right to produce more transparency.
Figure 15-20 shows a few frames from a project using a Luma key type. The 
frames show numbers counting down, superimposed over a video clip of two 
boxers fighting. Both clips are from Digital Vision. The numbers counting down 
clip is Working Numbers 577023f.mov, and the boxers fighting clip is Triangle 
Sports TRB05013.mov.
To create the Luma project, we imported the numbers counting down video clip
into Video track 1 and imported the boxers fighting video clip into Video track 2.
We selected the video clip in Video track 2 and applied the Luma Key type option.
We adjusted the Threshold and Cutoff values so that we could see both the num-
bers and boxers fighting. To fine-tune the effect, we reduced the opacity in the mid-
dle of the clip in Video track 2. Figure 15-21 shows the Timeline used to create the
project shown in Figure 15-20. In Audio track 1, we placed Digital Vision’s Acoustic
Chillout 730006aw.wav. The Luma Key settings to create the project appear in
Figure 15-22. (For another Image Matte example, turn to Chapter 28.)
If you want, you can load the clips used to create the Luma Key type project from
the Chapter 15 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that
accompanies this book.
Alpha Adjust
Use the Alpha Adjust Key to create transparency from imported images that con-
tain an alpha channel (an image layer that represents a mask with shades of gray,
including black and white, to indicate transparency levels). Premiere Pro reads
alpha channels from such programs as Adobe Photoshop and three-dimensional
software programs and also translates nontransparent areas of Illustrator files as
alpha channels.

Alpha Channel to have Premiere Pro ignore the alpha channel of that file, or you
can select the Invert Alpha Channel option to have Premiere Pro invert that files
alpha channel. 
Figure 15-23 shows a few frames of an Alpha Adjust project. The project gives you
the feeling that the guy is moving, when in reality the guy is not moving. The 
background clip is moving. To create the project, we imported a clip of a three-
dimensional man that we created in Curious Labs’ Poser and saved it in Photoshop
format with an alpha channel. The man is on a white background. To mask out the
white background, we created an alpha channel of the man. The image of the 3D
man was placed into Video track 2. Then we applied the Alpha Adjust Key effect 
to the clip in Video track 2. Video track 1 has a clip from Digital Vision’s Working
Numbers (577001f.mov). Figure 15-24 shows the Timeline used to create the project.
Figure 15-25 shows the Alpha Adjust effect settings in the Effect Controls window.
The settings allow you to adjust how the alpha channel appears. Reducing the
Opacity makes the image in the alpha channel more transparent. By selecting
Ignore Alpha, Premiere Pro ignores the alpha channel. Selecting Invert Alpha,
Premiere Pro inverts the alpha channel, and choosing Mask Only displays only 
the mask of the alpha channel without the image.
If you want, you can load the 3D man image (3Dguy.psd), the Digital Vision
Working Numbers video clip 577001f.mov, and Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout

Image Matte Key
The Image Matte Key is used to create transparency in still images, typically graph-
ics. Image areas that correspond to black portions of the matte are transparent;
areas corresponding to white areas are opaque. Gray areas create blending effects.
When using the Image Matte Key, click the Setup button (next to the Reset button in
the Effect Controls window) to choose an image. The final result depends upon the
image you choose. You can create a composite using the alpha channel or the lumi-
nance of the clip. If you want to reverse the key effect, making areas that corre-
spond to white transparent, areas corresponding to black areas will be opaque. The
controls for the Image Matte Key effect is shown in Figure 15-26.
Figure 15-26 shows a project created using an Image Matte Key effect. To create the
project (you can see a preview in the Monitor window in Figure 15-26), we imported
Digital Vision’s SkyRide 652024f.mov video clip to Video track 1. We selected Video
track 1 and dragged the Image Matte Key effect over the clip. Next we clicked the
Setup icon in the Effect Controls window. In the Select a Matte Image dialog box, we
selected an Adobe Illustrator file. To create the Illustrator file, we used the Brush
tool to brush anchors. The anchor was selected from the Object Sample Brushes
palette. The Timeline window is shown in Figure 15-26. In Audio track 1, we placed
Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav.
If you want, you can load the files used to create the project in Figure 15-26 from
the Chapter 15 folder that is in the Tutorial folder of the DVD that accompanies

Difference Matte Key
The Difference Matte Key enables you to key out image areas in one clip that match
image areas in another clip. Whether you use the Difference Matte Key option will
depend upon the clips you use in your project. If in your project you have a back-
ground without motion over a clip that does, you might want to use the Difference
Matte Key to key out image areas from the static clip.
Track Matte Key
The Track Matte Key enables you to create a moving or traveling matte effect. Often
the matte is a black-and-white image that is set in motion onscreen. Image areas
corresponding to black in the matte are transparent; image areas corresponding to
white are opaque. Gray areas create blending effects.

Multiply and Screen Key
The Multiply and Screen Key effects are transparency effects in which the lower
video track image exhibits a high degree of contrast. Use Multiply Key to create
transparency in areas corresponding to bright image areas in the lower video track.
Use Screen Key to create transparency in areas corresponding to dark image areas
in the lower video track. For both key effects, adjust the Opacity and Cutoff percent
values to fine-tune the effect.
Figure 15-27 shows a few frames from a Screen Key type project. To create the
Screen Key project, we placed Digital Vision’s Working Numbers 577025f.mov clip in
Video track 1 and SkyRide 652022f.mov clip in Video track 2. Figure 15-28 shows the
Monitor window with a frame from the clip in Video track 1 and a frame from the
clip in Video track 2.
We applied the Screen Key to Video track 1. The Screen Key controls are shown in
Figure 15-29. Because the video clip in Video track 1 was longer than the clip in
Video track 2, we used the Opacity option to slowly fade the clip in Video track 1. In
Audio track 1, we placed Digital Vision’s Acoustic Chillout 730006aw.wav. Figure
15-29 Shows the Timeline window used to create the Screen Key project.
If you want, you can load the clips used to create the Screen Key type project
from the Chapter 15 folder that is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that
accompanies this book.
Garbage Matte
A video clip may contain an object that you don’t want to appear in your project.
When this happens, you can create a Garbage Matte to eliminate (mask out) the
unwanted object. Usually the video clip in which you want to mask out an item will
go on Video track 2 in the Timeline window. Another clip that you want to use as a
composite will go in Video track 1.
Sometimes you may need to create a more sophisticated mask. When this hap-
pens, you may want to use Adobe After Effects. For more information on how to
create a mask using Adobe After Effects, turn to Chapter 29.
You can also use the Garbage Matte Key to create a split-screen effect that splits the
screen between a clip in one track and a clip in another track, as shown in Figure
15-30. Notice that the video clip from Video track 1 is displayed on the left side of
the preview and the video clip from Video track 2 is displayed on the right side. The
clip in Video track 1 is Digital Vision’s Working Numbers 577004f.mov, and the clip
in Video track 2 is Working Numbers 577008f.mov. The Timeline used to create the
split screen effect is shown in Figure 15-30. In Audio track 1, we placed Digital

Using Color
Mattes and
Backdrops
D
uring the course of a video production, you may need
to create a simple, colored background video track. You
may need the track to be a solid color background for text, or
you may need to create a background for transparency effects.
This chapter looks at how to use colored background mattes
and still-frame background images in Adobe Premiere Pro. 
You learn to create a color background in Premiere Pro and 
to export still frames from a clip to use as a backdrop. This
chapter concludes with tutorials on creating backdrops in
three popular digital imaging programs — Adobe Photoshop,
Adobe Illustrator, and Corel Painter.
Creating a Color Matte
If you need to create a colored background for text or graph-
ics, use a Premiere Pro color matte. Unlike many of the Premiere
Pro video mattes, a color matte is a solid matte that comprises
the entire video frame. A color matte can be used as a back-
ground or as a temporary track placeholder, until you’ve shot
or created the final track.
You may want to use a black video as a background matte.
To create a black video, choose File ➪New ➪Black Video.
An advantage of using a colored background is its versatility.
After you create the color matte, you can easily change its
color with a few clicks of the mouse.

Here’s how to create a color matte in Premiere Pro:
1. With a project onscreen, choose File ➪New ➪Color Matte. The Color Picker
dialog box appears.
2. Select a matte color. If an exclamation mark appears next to the color swatches
in the upper-right corner of the dialog box (see Figure 16-1), you’ve chosen a
color that is out of the NTSC color gamut. This color cannot be reproduced
correctly in NTSC video. Click the exclamation mark to have Premiere Pro
choose the next closest color.

To change the duration of a matte, click it in the Project window and choose Clip ➪
Speed/Duration. In the Clip Speed/Duration dialog box, click the Duration values
to change them. Then click OK.
Editing a color matte
The Premiere Pro color mattes have a distinct advantage over simply creating a col-
ored background in the Title window or creating titles in another program with a
colored background. If you are using a Premiere Pro color matte, you can quickly
change colors if the original matte color proves unsuitable or unattractive.
To change the colors of a color matte after you’ve placed it into the Timeline, sim-
ply double-click the matte clip in the Timeline. When Premiere Pro’s Color Picker
appears, pick a new color and then click OK. After you click OK, the color changes,
not only in the selected clip but also in all the clips in the tracks that use that color
matte.
You can create a color matte in Premiere Pro and then animate and incorporate it
into a project. Chapter 16 provides two examples of creating color mattes and
incorporating them into projects.
Creating a Backdrop from a Still Frame
As you work in Premiere Pro, you may want to export a still frame from a video 
clip and save it in a graphic format so that you can use it in another program as
part of a background. Figure 16-4 shows a collage we created using four frames 
from a Digital Vision, CityMix royalty-free video clip collection (clip 567001f). 
Digital Vision’s CityMix 567001f.mov clip is in the Digital Vision folder that is in
the Chapter 16 folder on the DVD that accompanies the book.
To create the collage in Figure 16-4, we found four frames we liked from video clip
567001f. We then exported these frames from Premiere Pro as PICT files. Then we
imported the four still frames into Photoshop. Using layers, we composited the col-
lage. We added text and lines. The final collage (shown in Figure 16-4) can be used
as promotional material, such as a poster for the actual video clip. The final collage
can also be re-imported into Premiere Pro and used as a backdrop of the opening
title of a video production.

6. Click Save to save the file. You can now import the image into Photoshop by
loading the program, then choosing File ➪Open. Photoshop enables you to
enhance or manipulate your image. If you want, you can create a collage, as
shown in Figure 16-4, by dragging and dropping all the files into one file. You
may also want to import the final Photoshop image into Premiere Pro. To
import the final Photoshop file into a Premiere project, choose File ➪Import.
Locate and select the file. Then click Open.
Creating Background Mattes in Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop 7 is an extremely versatile program for creating full-screen back-
ground mattes, or backdrops. Not only can you edit and manipulate photographs in
Photoshop, but you can also create black-and-white or grayscale images to be used
as background mattes. In this section, you create two different Photoshop projects.
The first is a simple backdrop, showing you how to create a textured backdrop to
use as a backdrop when superimposing titles and graphics. The second example is
more complicated, but it illustrates more of Photoshop 7’s digital imaging power.
Creating simple backgrounds with the Gradient tool
In this section, you create a non-DV project called Orchid Flower Shop. You’ll use
Photoshop 7’s Gradient tool and several filters to create a background. Figure 16-5
shows the final background image created in Photoshop 7.
Figure 16-5: Simple background image created in Photoshop.

Chapter 16 ✦Using Color Mattes and Backdrops
After you create the background file (seen in Figure 16-5) for the Orchid Flower Shop
project, you’ll mask a flower from its background by using a transparent background,
as shown in Figure 16-6. When this flower file is loaded into Premiere Pro, it reads
the Photoshop file with a transparent background. Text appears on top of the two
Photoshop images, created by using the Adobe Title Designer window as shown in
Figure 16-7.

406
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Here’s how to create a simple background in Photoshop (shown previously in
Figure 16-5):
1. Choose File ➪New to create a new file. 
2. In the New dialog box, click the Preset Sizes pop-up menu and choose 
640 x 480 to set the width to 640 pixels, the height to 480 pixels, and the
resolution to 72 pixels per inch. The mode should be set to RGB. Set the
Contents to Background Color. 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.
4. Set the foreground color to a light color and set the background color to a
darker shade of the same color. To change the foreground and background
colors, click the foreground and background swatches in the Toolbox. In the
Color Picker dialog box that appears, pick a color.
5. Click the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. Set the Gradient tool to use a Radial
Gradient. The mode should be Normal, and the Opacity set to 100%.
6. With the Gradient tool selected, click and drag outward from the center of
your image to create a gradient.
7. With a radial gradient onscreen, choose Filter ➪Noise ➪Add Noise to add
color to the gradient.
8. Choose Filter ➪Render ➪Lighting Effects to add more depth and lighting
variations. Figure 16-8 shows the Lighting Effects dialog box.

Chapter 16 ✦Using Color Mattes and Backdrops
9. Choose File ➪Save to save your file. Save your file in Photoshop format.
Then close the file.
Now that you’ve created a background, you need to mask a flower from the back-
ground so that you can import it into Premiere Pro with a transparent background.
Follow these steps to isolate the orchid flower from its background:
1. Choose File ➪Open to open a file with flowers. If you don’t have a picture of
flowers, you can load the orchid.psd file from the DVD that accompanies this
book.
2. Double-click the Background layer in the Layers palette. 
3. In the New Layer dialog box that appears, rename the layer flower. Click OK
to close the dialog box.
4. Now mask the flower using one of Photoshop’s masking tools. You can use
one of the Selection tools or the Select ➪Color Range command to select the
background. (For more information on using Photoshop’s Color Range com-
mand, turn to Chapter 18.) When the background is selected, press Delete to
have the flower appear on a transparent background. (By default, Photoshop
represents a transparent background with a checkerboard.) You should now
have a file with just a flower on a transparent background. Premiere Pro views
an image on a transparent background the same way it does if the image had
an alpha channel saved in the Channels palette. 
If you are not familiar with Photoshop’s masking features, you can use the Eraser
tool to erase the background. If you make a mistake, either choose Edit ➪Undo or
File ➪Revert. If you are familiar with Photoshop’s tools, you may want to use the
Pen tool to outline the flower and select it. If you use the Pen tool, you need to
convert the path into a selection by choosing Make Selection from the Path pop-
up menu. Next, reverse the selection by choosing Select ➪Inverse and press
Delete on your keyboard to erase the background and isolate the flower.
5. Choose File ➪Save As to rename and save your file. In the Save As dialog
box, name your file OrchidLayer. Then save your file in Photoshop format
and have the Layers option selected. This will keep the flower isolated from
the background. Then click Save and close the file.
Orchid Flower Shop project
Now that you have created a background and isolated an image, you’re ready to
create the Orchid Flower Shop project. Figure 16-9 shows a few frames from the
Orchid Flower Shop project. In the frames, you can see that the orchid flower
moves across the screen over the background.

Creating Motion
Effects in
Premiere Pro
M
otion creates interest and adds to the power of just
about any presentation. In Adobe Premiere Pro, you
can send a title or logo spinning across the screen or bounce
a clip off the borders of the frame area. Using a graphic with
an alpha channel, you can superimpose one moving object
over another. You can also create traveling matte effects, in
which one image within a shape moves across the screen over
another image. This chapter not only shows you how to cre-
ate traveling mattes, but also how to set graphics in motion,
including how to make them bend and rotate onscreen.
To create these motion effects, you’ll use Premiere Pro’s new
Motion options, found in the Effect Controls window.
Touring the Motion Effects Options
in the Effect Controls window
Premiere Pro’s new Motion options allow you to scale, rotate,
and move a clip. By animating the motion options you can wake
up an otherwise boring image by setting it in motion over time
using keyframes. You can make any clip move and jiggle or
make a still frame move across the screen. (See Chapter 12 to
learn how to use Premiere Pro’s Motion effects options to add
motion to your titles.) The Motion effects are found in the
Effect Controls window, which is shown in Figure 17-1.

the Motion effects options.
To use Premiere Pro’s Motion options, you need to have a project onscreen with a
video clip selected in the Timeline window. Follow these steps to create a new pro-
ject, import two video clips, and display the Motion effect options:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. In the New Project dia-
log box, choose a preset and name the project and click OK.
2. Load two video clips by choosing File ➪Import. You can either use your 
own video or you can use Digital Vision’s Ambient Space 434016f.mov and
434011f.mov files found on the DVD that accompanies this book. After you
import the file into your project, it appears in the Project window.
3. If you want, load a sound clip by choosing File ➪Import. Locate a sound 
and click Open. We used Digital Vision’s Cool Lounge 666005aw.wav file. Then
drag the sound clip from the Project window to Audio track 1 in the Timeline
window.
Digital Vision’s Ambient Space 434016f.mov and 434011f.mov video clips and
Digital Vision’s Cool Lounge 666005aw.wav are found in the Digital Vision folder,
in the Chapter 17 folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that
accompanies this book.
4. Next, click one of the video clips in the Project window and drag it to 
Video track 1 in the Timeline window. Then drag the other video clip 
to Video track 2 in the Timeline window. We dragged Digital Vision’s
Ambient Space 434011f.mov to Video track 1 and Digital Vision’s Ambient
Space 434016f.mov to Video track 2. The Timeline window should now have
two video clips, as shown in Figure 17-2.
You can choose how a clip is displayed on the Timeline by clicking on the Set
Display Style icon and clicking on one of the options. To view the Set Display Style
icon, you need to expand a video track by clicking on the triangle that is in front of
the word Video.

7. Use the Rotate option to rotate a clip around its center point. To rotate, click
and drag on the Rotate degree value or enter a value in the Rotation degree
field. To create one complete rotation, enter 360 degrees. We rotated the clip
90 degrees.
8. To see a preview of how the Motion effects Scale and Rotation settings have
changed the clip in Video track 2, first open the Monitor window by choosing
Window ➪Monitor. Then either click the Play button in the Monitor win-
dow or click and drag on the shuttle or jog slider. You can also see a preview
by moving the current Timeline indicator in the Effect Controls window or the
Timeline window. Notice that the clip has been scaled and rotated and that it
remains scaled and rotated throughout the duration of the clip.
To go back to the default motion settings, click the Reset icon that is to the left of
the word Motion in the Effect Controls window.
9. To move the position of a clip, click and drag on the Position values to
change the values and move the clip on its X and Y axis. To move the clip
from its center point, click and drag on the Anchor Point values.
10. To move a clip manually, click the word Motion in the Effect Controls win-
dow. Notice that in the Monitor window, a wireframe appears around the clip,
as shown in Figure 17-4. Click inside the wireframe and move the clip. As you
move the clip, the Position values change. You can also manually rotate and
scale a clip. To scale a clip, move the cursor on either a corner or side handle.
To keep the clip’s proportions, press and hold the Shift key as you scale. To
rotate a clip manually, move the cursor just outside of either a corner or side
handle, and then drag in the direction you want to rotate.

11. Click the Play button in the Monitor window to preview the effects of the
Position settings. To render a work area, choose Sequence ➪Render Work
Area. Notice that the clip starts at the new position and remains there
throughout the duration of the clip. To move the clip’s position to different
places throughout the duration of the clip, you need to set keyframes. Turn to
the next section to learn more about working with keyframes.
By default, Premiere Pro displays a preview in Automatic Quality. To change the
preview display, click the Monitor window pop-up menu and choose Highest
Quality or Draft Quality.
The following section describes how to use keyframes to animate a clip over time.
Setting keyframes to create motion effects 
using the Effect Controls window
To create motion that moves in more than one direction or changes size or rotation
throughout the duration of a clip, you need to add keyframes. You can use keyframes
to create effects at specific points in time — for example, to create an effect using 
a graphic or video clip in motion simultaneously with another video clip. Using
keyframes, the effect can occur at a specific point in your narration, and you can
also add music to the effect. The motion path is displayed when the word Motion is
selected in the Effect Controls window. When the motion path is displayed, keyframes
appear as points in the motion path and designate a change in position.
You can also add keyframes to the motion path at specific points by clicking on the
Timeline. (The Timeline is described in the next section.)
Here’s how to add keyframes to a motion path to create the effect of a clip moving
diagonally from top left to bottom right:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. In the New Project dia-
log box, choose a preset. Then name the project and click OK.
2. Choose File ➪Import. In the Import dialog box, locate and select a clip. Then
choose Open to import a clip into the Project window. We used Digital Vision’s
Ambient Space 434006f.mov file.
If you want, you can use Digital Vision’s Ambient Space 434006f.mov, which is
found in the Digital Vision folder, in the Chapter 17 folder that is in the Tutorial
Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.
3. Drag the clip from the Project window to Video track 2 of the Timeline. 
This is the clip you will be applying motion effects to.
At any time you can import another clip into this project and use it as the back-
ground. After you import the clip, drag it into Video track 1 of the Timeline. You can
also import a sound clip. After you’ve imported a sound, drag it into Audio track 1.

3. Click and drag on the current Timeline indicator in the Timeline window to
see the preview of the motion in the Monitor window. To see a preview of
the motion path, make sure that the word Motion is selected in the Effect
Controls window.
Adding keyframes using the Timeline window is the same as adding keyframes
using the Timeline in the Effect Controls window. Here’s how to add keyframes in
the Timeline window:
1. Move the current Timeline indicator in the Timeline window to where you
want to add a keyframe.
2. Click the Motion pop-up menu and choose the setting you want to affect.
3. Either numerically make the Motion effect change to one of the Motion effect
settings you choose or manually adjust the clip in the Monitor window.
4. Click the Add/Remove Keyframe icon in the Timeline window to add a
keyframe.
For more information on editing keyframes, move on to the next section.
Editing Motion Paths
To edit motion paths, you can move, delete, or add keyframes, or even copy and
paste them. Sometimes, by adding keyframes you can create smoother motion
paths. Here’s how to add a keyframe:
1. Select the clip you want to animate.
2. Move the current Timeline indicator to where you want to add a keyframe.
3. To add a keyframe, use the Effect Controls window or the Timeline window. 
4. To add a keyframe using the Effect Controls window, turn on the Toggle
Animation stopwatch. If the Toggle Animation stopwatch is already activated,
click the Add/Remove Keyframe icon to add a keyframe.
5. To add a keyframe using the Timeline window, click the Add/Remove
Keyframe icon or press and hold the Ctrl key as you use the Pen tool to 
add a keyframe to the motion line.
Moving a keyframe point
After you add a motion keyframe, you can return to it at any time to move it. You
can either move a motion keyframe point using the Effect Controls window or the

432
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Timeline window. You can also move a keyframe point using the motion path that is
displayed in the Monitor window. When you move the keyframe point in the Effect
Controls and/or Timeline window, you change when the motion effect will occur on
the Timeline. When you move the keyframe point in the motion path, you affect the
shape of the motion path.
Here’s how to move a keyframe point using the Effect Controls and Timeline window:
1. Move the current Timeline indicator to where you want to move the
keyframe. As you move the current Timeline indicator, use the Info palette 
to find the correct location.
2. Select the keyframe point that you want to move by clicking it with the
mouse. When you click a keyframe point in the Timeline window, the cursor
displays its position on the Timeline.
To select more than one keyframe at a time, press and hold the Shift key as you
select the keyframe point.
3. Click and drag on the selected keyframe point to the new location.
Here’s how to move a keyframe point using the motion path displayed in the
Monitor window:
1. To display the motion path in the Monitor window, select the word Motion
from the Effect Controls window.
2. Select the keyframe point that you want to move by clicking it with the
mouse.
3. Click and drag the selected keyframe point to the new location.
Following are tips for making intricate edits on the motion path:
✦To move a keyframe on the motion path one pixel at a time, press one of the
directional arrow keys on your keyboard.
✦To move the motion path five pixels at a time, press Shift and press a directional
arrow key on your keyboard.
✦Click in the Info box below the Timeline and enter a specific coordinate for the
point on the path. When you select a point, the point number appears in the
Info box. For example, if you want to center the clip in the middle of the screen,
enter 0,0 in the box. If you enter a positive number in the first box, the clip
moves to the right. If you enter a negative number, the clip moves to the left. 
If you enter a positive number in the right box, the clip moves down; entering
a negative number makes the clip move up. For example, if you enter –10,10,
the clip moves ten pixels to the left and ten pixels down from the middle of the
screen.

Chapter 17 ✦Creating Motion Effects in Premiere Pro
Deleting keyframe points
As you edit, you may want to delete a keyframe point. To do this, simply select the
point or points and press the Delete key. If you want to delete all the keyframe points
for a Motion effect option, click the Toggle Animation icon in the Effect Controls
window. A warning prompt will appear, asking you whether you want to delete all
existing keyframes; if so click OK.
Copying and pasting keyframe points
You can copy a keyframe point and paste it in another place in the Timeline. 
Here’s how:
1. To copy a keyframe point, you first need to select it by clicking it.
2. Choose Edit ➪Copy.
3. Move the current Timeline indicator to the new location.
4. Choose Edit ➪Paste.
Changing a motion path’s speed
Premiere determines motion speed by the distance between keyframes. To increase
the speed of motion, create keyframes that are closer together. To slow the speed of
motion, set keyframes farther apart.
What’s an alpha channel?
Essentially, an alpha channel is an extra grayscale image layer that Premiere Pro translates
into different levels of transparency.
Alpha channels are typically used to define the transparent areas of a graphic or title. They
enable you to combine a logo or text in one video track with a background video track in
another. The background track surrounds the logo or text and is seen through the letters in
the text. If you viewed an alpha channel of text, it might appear as pure white text on a
black background. When Premiere Pro uses the alpha channel to create transparency, it can
place colored text in the white area of the alpha channel and a background video track in
the black area.
Alpha channels can be created in image-editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop and
Corel Painter. Most 3D programs create alpha channels as well. When you create titles in
the Title Designer window, Premiere Pro automatically creates an alpha channel for the
text. (For more information about alpha channels, see Chapter 16. Chapter 27 provides
detailed instructions for creating alpha channels in Photoshop.)

434
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Here’s how to change the speed of motion:
1. If you don’t already have keyframes, create keyframes on the Timeline by
using either the Effect Controls window or Timeline window (see the steps
earlier in this chapter).
2. To increase motion speed, drag keyframes closer together. To decrease
motion speed, drag keyframes further apart. To move a keyframe, click the
keyframe to select it and then click and drag the keyframe point and move
it on the Timeline.
You can also use the Clip ➪Speed/Duration command to change the speed
and/or duration of a clip.
Changing opacity
In the Fixed Effects section of the Effect Controls window are the Motion Effect
options and the Opacity option. By reducing the opacity of a clip, you make the clip
more translucent. To change the opacity of a clip throughout its duration, click and
drag to the left on the Opacity percent value. You can also change the Opacity 
percent field by clicking in the field and then typing a number and pressing Enter.
Alternatively, you can expand the Opacity option by clicking on the triangle in front
of the Opacity name and clicking and dragging on the Opacity slider.
To set keyframes for the Opacity using the Effect Controls window, follow these
steps:
1. Activate the Toggle Animation icon.
2. Change the Opacity field and click the Toggle Keyframe icon to set a
keyframe.
To set keyframes for the Opacity using the Timeline window, follow these steps:
1. Click the Show Keyframes icon.
2. Choose Opacity from the clip’s title pop-up menu and then click the
Add/Remove Keyframe icon to add a keyframe.
To change the Opacity field, use the white line below the clip’s name. Click and drag
down on the white line to reduce the opacity of the clip. For more information on
using the Opacity option, refer to Chapter 15.
Applying special effects
After you’ve animated a clip using the Fixed Effects options in the Effect Control
window, you may find that you want to add a few more effects to your clip. You can
find various effects in the Video Effects folder of the Effects window. To adjust an
image’s color, try using one of the Image Control video effects. If you want to distort
Note

435
Chapter 17 ✦Creating Motion Effects in Premiere Pro
a clip, try using one of the Distort video effects. For more information on using the
video effects, refer to Chapter 14. Here’s how to add effects to a clip:
1. Start by moving the current Timeline indicator on either the Timeline in
the Effect Controls window or the Timeline window to the place where you
want to add an effect.
2. Pick an effect from the Effects window and drag it either to the Effect
Controls window or Timeline window.
3. Adjust the settings for the effect and then click the Toggle Animation icon
to create a keyframe. If you want the effect to change over time, you’ll need
to create various keyframes.
Using a Clip with an Alpha Channel
If you create motion effects with text or logos, you may want the text or logo to
appear as though it were on a sheet of clear acetate to enable a background video
track to show through in the background. The standard digital method of creating
this effect is to use an alpha channel.
If the image you set in motion includes an alpha channel, Premiere Pro can mask
out the background and substitute the background area with visuals from another
video track.
The following steps explain how to apply the Motion settings to a clip with an 
alpha channel. Figure 17-8 shows a 3D still image over a sky background. The 3D
image was created using Strata StudioPro. The image was saved with an alpha chan-
nel in Photoshop format. The sky background is from Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies
386009f.mov file. 
Figure 17-8: An image with an alpha

1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. In the New Project dia-
log box, choose a preset, name the project, and click OK to create a new
project.
2. Choose File ➪Import to import two clips into the Project window. To see the
transparency effects of an alpha channel, you need two images in two differ-
ent video tracks, one on top of the other. One image should be a file that has
an alpha channel; the other clip will be used as the background. If you want,
you can use the images from Figure 17-8, or you can use the text tools in the
Adobe Premiere Title Designer dialog box to create a title with an alpha chan-
nel. You can also use the graphic tools in the Adobe Premiere Title Designer
dialog box to create a background.
The 3D image (StillLife.psd) and background file (Digital Vision’s Drifting Skies
386009f.mov), shown in Figure 17-8, are found in the Digital Vision folder,
Chapter 17 folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD accompany-
ing this book.
To review how to create titles and graphics using the Adobe Premiere Title
Designer, see Chapter 11.
3. Drag the background image to Video track 1 in the Timeline window.
4. Drag the file with the alpha channel (either the title clip or graphic file)
from the Project window to Video track 2 in the Timeline window.
5. Change the duration of the image in Video track 2 to match the background
clip in Video track 1. The clip in Video track 2 should be selected. If it isn’t,
select it now.
6. To apply motion effects to the clip in Video track 2, use either the Effect

through a star-shaped graphic pattern, which is the mask. The matte is simply a star-
shaped white graphic created against a black background.
Figure 17-9: A frame for a traveling matte effect.
To create a traveling matte effect, you will need two video clips: one for the back-
ground and another one that will travel within the matte. You will also need a
graphic image for the matte itself. Figure 17-10 shows the clips in the Timeline used
to create the traveling matte effect shown in Figure 17-9. In Video track 3 is a star
image. In Video track 2 is a landscape video clip, and in Video track 1 is a video clip
of a sky.

2. Choose File ➪Import to import a clip to use in the background and import
a file to use as the element to appear in the mask. In Figure 17-9, we used a
sky video clip as the background and a landscape clip to appear in the mask.
Both clips shown in Figure 17-9 are from Digital Vision. The landscape clip is
file 65022f.mov from the Sky Ride CD, and the sky clip is file 386022f.mov from
the Drifting Skies CD.
The Digital Vision clip Sky Ride 65022f.mov clip and Drifting Skies 386022f.mov
clip, shown in Figure 17-9, are found in the Digital Vision folder, in the Chapter 17
folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder on this book’s companion DVD. If
you prefer, you can use any two video clips located in the DVD’s Tutorial Projects
folder.
3. Drag the image that you want to use as your background to Video track 1.
4. Drag the image that you want to appear within the matte into Video track 2.
5. Choose File ➪Import to import a graphic image to use as a matte. We used
the star.psd image (found on this book’s DVD). In the Import Layered File dia-
log box, leave the Import As pop-up menu set to Footage and select the Choose
Layer option. In the Choose Layer pop-up menu, choose the appropriate layer
(we chose Shape 1). Click OK to import the star shape into the Project window.
The star.psd image used in Figure 17-9 is found in the Chapter 17 folder, which is
in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.
If you want, you can create a white image against a black background to use as a
matte. (We used Photoshop’s Shape tool to create the star. When creating the file,
set the pixel dimensions to be the same as those you want to use for your project.
For more information on using Adobe Photoshop, turn to Chapter 27. For more
information on using Adobe Illustrator, turn to Chapter 28.) You can also use the
tools in the Title Designer window to create a matte shape. To use the Title
Designer window, choose File ➪New ➪Title. (For more information on creating

Creating Motion Settings Projects
The following projects provide the steps for integrating graphics with alpha channels
to create motion effects. In the first example, a coffee cup and text move across a
chart of coffee bean sales. The second example is an animated book cover — an idea
that booksellers might start using on their Web sites.
Creating a presentation
You can use the Motion Settings dialog box to create an animated presentation.
Figure 17-11 shows the frames used to create a sample Coffee Bean Sales presenta-
tion. As you view the frames, notice the motion applied to the coffee cup and text
clips.
We created the sample chart shown in Figure 17-12 using Adobe Illustrator and then
saved it in Illustrator format. The coffee cup, shown in Figure 17-13, was scanned and
manipulated using Adobe Photoshop. We used the Paintbrush and Eyedropper tools
to fine-tune the edges and insides of the coffee cup. Then a selection of the coffee cup
was created using the Polygonal Lasso tool. To soften the edges of the selection, a
two-pixel feather was applied to the selection (Select ➪Feather). The selection was
saved as an alpha channel (Select ➪Save Selection). To save the coffee cup and
alpha channel, we saved the file in PICT format (you can also save in Photoshop or
TIFF formats). We created the text using Premiere Pro’s Title Designer window. All

the images were imported into a new project. To make the coffee cup and text 
overlap, we placed them into different video tracks. We set the coffee cup and text
into motion, using the Motion settings.
All the graphics used in this example can be found in the Chapter 17 Coffee
folder, in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.

If you want to create your own graphics for a presentation, you’ll need to create the
following three production elements:
✦A background image.
✦A title. You can create a title in the Adobe Premiere Title Designer window,
which is covered extensively in Chapter 11.
✦A graphic with an alpha channel. Create this in a program that enables you
to create alpha channels, or save masks, such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel
Painter, or a 3D program.

1. Create a new project by choosing File ➪New ➪Project.
2. In the New Project dialog box, choose your project settings. Pick the Non-
DV Square-Pixel 640 x 480 preset. Name your file. Click OK to create your
new project.
3. To import the sample graphic files from the DVD that accompanies this
book, choose File ➪Import. In the Import dialog box, locate the Coffee
folder from the Chapter 17 folder on the DVD and click the Import Folder
button. After you’ve imported the files, they appear in the Project window, as
shown in Figure 17-14.
4. If you are importing your own files, choose File ➪Import. To import more
than one file at a time, press and hold the Control key, select the files that you
want to import, and then import them. After you’ve imported the files, they
appear in the Project window.
5. Drag the background file from the Project window to Video track 1 in the
Timeline window. Drag the chart file for the Coffee Bean Sales presentation
to Video track 1.
6. Drag the image with the alpha channel from the Project window to Video
track 2 in the Timeline window. Drag the coffee cup image to Video track 2
for the Coffee Bean Sales presentation.
7. Drag and drop the title (Coffee Bean Sales) that you imported from the DVD
that accompanies this book to Video track 3. If you want to create your own
title, proceed to Step 8; otherwise, skip to the next set of steps in this section
to apply motion to your images. The Timeline used to create the Coffee Bean
Sales project is shown in Figure 17-15.
8. To create your own title, choose File ➪New ➪Title. In the Title Designer win-
dow, make sure that the Show Video option is selected if you want to see the
image in Video track 2. Then use the Text tool to type some text. Stylize the
text using the commands in the Title menu or the options in the Object Style
section of the dialog box.

Now you’re ready to apply motion to the images in Video track 2 and Video track 3:
1. Click the clip in Video track 3 in the Timeline window and then use the
Motion settings in either the Effect Controls window or the Timeline win-
dow to edit the motion using the techniques described in this chapter. We
set three points on the Motion Timeline: a starting point, a middle point, and a
finish point. The text moves from the left to the right. At the middle point, we
created a delay so that the text would stop moving long enough for the viewer
to read it. The size of the text was decreased at the Start and Finish points,
and the text size was increased in the middle point.
2. To preview the Motion settings, click the Play button in the Monitor window.
3. Apply your own Motion settings to the image in Video track 2 by clicking
the clip in Video track 2 and then using the Motion settings options in the
Effect Controls window. We made the cup move from the top down. The cup
drops to the middle of the chart and then spills into the text. We added left
rotations to points on the Motion Timeline. On the points in the middle of the
Motion Timeline, we also added a delay for both the coffee cup and text. We
also decreased and increased the coffee cup size. We used the clip’s alpha
channel option so that the white background would be removed from the
image.
4. Preview the motion settings by clicking the Play button in the Monitor 
window.
Next, you need to add the audio clip to your presentation:
1. Choose File ➪Import. Locate Digital Vision’s Cool Lounge 666001aw. wav
audio file from the Digital Vision folder in the Chapter 17 folder that is on
the DVD that accompanies this book. When the audio file appears in the

Animating a book cover
In the following steps, you’ll create an animated book cover. You can see a frame from
the book cover project in Figure 17-16. Here an angel image moves from the top left
of the screen down to the bottom center of the screen. The angel starts on her side
and as she moves, slowly rotates to the right, then to the left, and eventually ends
in an upright position. When the angel reaches the bottom of screen, she halts for a
moment while the text (Angel Stories) appears over a sky background in the middle
of the screen. To create the motion for the angel, we used the Motion Settings dialog
box. To create the background, we scanned a sky image and saved it in JPEG format.
We used Premiere Pro’s Adobe Title Designer window to create the text. We used
both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create the angel image.
All the graphics for this example can be loaded from the Angel folder in the
Chapter 17 folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder on the DVD that accom-
panies this book.
Figure 17-16: A frame of the book cover
project.
If you want to create your own graphics for an animated book cover, you need to
create these three production elements:
✦A background image.
✦A title. You can create this in Premiere Pro’s Adobe Title Designer window, which
is discussed earlier in this chapter and covered extensively in Chapter 11.
✦A graphic with an alpha channel. Create this in a program that enables 
you to create alpha channels or save masks, such as Adobe Photoshop or
MetaCreations Painter. Most 3D programs also create alpha channels.
Following are the steps for creating the angel with an alpha channel: 
On the

Chapter 17 ✦Creating Motion Effects in Premiere Pro
1. Create a pencil sketch of an angel image.
2. Scan it into Photoshop, or using your scanning software, save it in TIFF 
format.
3. Next, load the pencil sketch into Adobe Illustrator and use the Pen tool to
outline the object and fill it with color.
4. Open the angel image in Photoshop. When the image of the angel opens in
Photoshop, it opens against a transparent background, called Layer 1. The
transparent background enables you to easily create the alpha channel.
5. To add depth to the angel, either apply a filter such as Texture (Filter ➪
Texture) or use the Layer ➪Layer Style ➪Bevel and Emboss command.
6. To begin creating the alpha channel, you need to select only the angel
onscreen. To do this, press and hold Ctrl as you click in the middle of 
Layer 1 in the Layers palette. A selection appears around the angel image.
7. With the selection onscreen, choose Select ➪Save Selection. In the Save
Selection dialog box, enter a name for the selection and then click OK. You
should now have an alpha channel in the Channels palette.
8. To save the file with the alpha channel, choose File ➪Save As. In the Save
As dialog box, save in TIFF, PICT, or Photoshop format, making sure that
the Save Alpha Channels option is selected.
The steps to create the animated book cover are as follows:
1. Create a new project by choosing File ➪New ➪Project. Pick the Non- DV
Square-Pixel 640 x 480 preset. Name your file. Click OK to create your new
project.
2. Choose File ➪Import. Locate and select the Angel folder that is located in
the Chapter 17 folder on the DVD that accompanies this book. Then choose
Import folder. To import your own images, choose File ➪Import to import
files needed for the project. In the Import dialog box, press and hold the Ctrl
key to select more than one item at a time. Click Open to import the files into
the Project window.
3. Drag and drop the background image (the sky image) from the Project win-
dow to Video track 1.
4. Drag and drop the graphic image with the alpha channel (Angel) from the
Project window to Video track 2.
5. Drag and drop the title (Angel Stories) to Video track 3. To create your own
title, choose File ➪New ➪Title. In the Adobe Title Designer window (shown in
Figure 17-17), create the desired type effect.
6. With the graphic alpha channel image (the angel image) in Video track 2
selected, use the Motion settings to apply motion to the angel image. We
made the angel move from the top-left side to the middle, then downwards.
7. Use the Selection tool to select the title (Angel Stories) in the Timeline.

Enhancing Video
W
hen shooting video, you will eventually have little
control over the locale or lighting conditions. This
often results in video clips that are too dark or too bright or
that display a colorcast onscreen. Fortunately, Premiere Pro’s
Video Effects window includes a number of effects specifically
designed to change image brightness, contrast, and colors.
Many of these effects can be previewed onscreen while you
fine-tune the options in the Video Effects window. Although
there is no substitute for high-quality video shot with well-
planned lighting, Premiere Pro’s Video Effects window may 
be able to boost the overall tonal and color quality of your
production.
However, if you find that the Premiere Pro tools aren’t power-
ful enough, you can import your video clip as a Filmstrip file
into Adobe Photoshop. You can then use Photoshop’s power-
ful masking and color-correcting tools to enhance your clip
frame by frame. You can then import the corrected file back
into Premiere Pro.
This chapter looks at the Premiere filters that can be used to
enhance colors. It starts with an overview of the RGB color
model and then goes into the video enhancement options 
that Premiere Pro provides. It concludes with a look at how 
to import a file into Photoshop, correct the video, and then
export it back to Premiere Pro.
The RGB Color Model
Before you begin to correct color, lightness, brightness, and
contrast in Premiere Pro, you should review a few important
concepts about computer color theory. As you’ll soon see,
Premiere Pro’s image-enhancement commands are not based
on the basics of television engineering. Instead, they’re 
based on the fundamentals of how a computer creates color.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
When you view images on a computer display, colors are created from different com-
binations of red, green, and blue light. When you need to choose or edit colors, many
computer programs, such as Premiere Pro and Photoshop, enable you to choose
from 256 levels of red, 256 levels of green, and 256 levels of blue. This results in over
17.6 million color possibilities (256 × 256 × 256). In both Premiere Pro and Photoshop,
each red, green, and blue color component of an image is called a channel.
Premiere Pro’s Color Picker provides an example of how red, green, and blue chan-
nels create color. Using the Color Picker, you can choose colors by specifying red,
green, and blue values. To open Premiere Pro’s Color Picker, you must first have a
project onscreen and then choose File ➪New ➪Color Matte. In the Color Picker dia-
log box, shown in Figure 18-1, notice the Red, Green, and Blue entry fields. If you
click a color on the left, the numbers in the entry fields change to show how many
levels of red, green, and blue are used to create that color. To change colors, you
can also enter a value from 0 to 255 into each of the Red, Green, and Blue fields.
Figure 18-1: Premiere Pro’s Color Picker enables you to choose 
colors by specifying red, green, and blue color values.
As you work in Premiere Pro, consider your production’s final export destination. If
you are exporting to videotape, realize that the color gamut (the range of colors
that make up an image) displayed on a computer screen is greater than the color
gamut of a television screen. Your computer monitor creates colors using red,
green, and blue phosphors. American Broadcast television uses the YCC standard,
which uses one luminance, or brightness, channel and two color channels to cre-
ate an image. The luminance channel was and still is based on the luminance
value used for black-and-white television. This value was kept so those viewers
with black-and-white television could still view the television signal when color
was adapted.
Note

449
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
If you will be using Premiere Pro to do color correcting, you need to have a basic
understanding of how the red, green, and blue color channels interact to create red,
green, and blue color, and their complements (or opposites), cyan, magenta, and
yellow. The following list of color combinations can help you understand how differ-
ent channels create colors. Note that the lower numbers are darker, and the higher
numbers are brighter. The combination 0 red, 0 green, 0 blue creates black — the
absence of light. If red, green, and blue values are set to 255, white is created — the
most amount of light.
255 red + 255 green + 255 blue = white
0 red + 0 green + 0 blue = black
255 red + 255 green = yellow
255 red + 255 blue = magenta
255 green + 255 blue = cyan
Notice that adding two of the RGB color components produces cyan, magenta, or
yellow. These are the complements of red, green, and blue. Understanding this rela-
tionship is helpful, because it can help provide some direction as you work. From
the preceding color calculations, you can see that adding more red and more green
to an image produces more yellow; adding more red and blue produces more
magenta; adding more green and blue produces more cyan.
The preceding calculations also provide a basis for the results of adding or sub-
tracting one of the Red, Green, or Blue channels from an image:
Add red = less cyan
Reduce red = more cyan
Increase green = less magenta
Reduce green = more magenta
Add blue = less yellow
Reduce blue = more yellow
As you can see from the examples in this chapter, most of Premiere Pro’s image-
enhancement commands use red, green, and blue sliders or red, green, and blue
channels when called upon to correct color.
Using the Premiere Pro video effects to color correct. In Premiere Pro’s Video Effects
window, the Adjust and Image Control folders contain color-correcting video effects.
(You may also want to use the effects in the Sharpen folder to sharpen the video after
you’ve adjusted its color.) To display the Effects window that contains the Video
Effects folder, choose Window ➪Effects. (For detailed descriptions on using all the
video effects, see Chapter 14.)

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
The Adjust effects
The video effects in the Adjust folder are Brightness & Contrast, Channel Mixer,
Convolution Kernel, Extract, Levels, Posterize, and ProAmp.
Before you begin exploring Premiere Pro’s color-enhancement commands, start
by creating a new project. Import a color clip into Premiere Pro and drag it into
Video track 1. If you don’t have a video clip to use, you can use one of the clips
found in the Chapter 18 folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder that is on
the DVD that accompanies this book. In the following sections, we used Digital
Vision’s 567004f.mov from the CityMix CD.
Changing brightness and contrast
The Brightness and Contrast effect is one of the easiest image effects to correct.
Brightness controls the light levels in your image, while contrast is the difference
between the brightest and darkest levels. To use the Brightness & Contrast effect,
click and drag it over the clip in Video track 1. (The Brightness & Contrast effect is
found in the Adjust folder that is in the Effect window.) After you drag the effect, the
controls for the effect appear in the Effect Controls window. Take a moment to try
out each of the Brightness & Contrast Settings:
✦Brightness. To increase overall brightness in your clip, click and drag 
the Brightness slider to the right. As you drag, the entire image lightens. To
decrease Brightness, click and drag to the left. As you drag, the entire clip
gets darker.
✦Contrast. To see the effect of the Contrast slider, first click and drag the slider
to the right. As you drag, you add contrast, increasing the difference between
the lightest and darkest areas of your image. This also tends to create a sharper
image. To decrease sharpness, click and drag to the left. As you drag, the entire
clip begins to fade out.
Continue to experiment with the Brightness & Contrast Video effect. After you fin-
ish, you can remove the effect by clicking on it in the Effect Controls window, then
pressing Delete. 
Changing levels
The Levels filter is one of the most sophisticated color-correcting controls offered
by Premiere Pro. Levels can be used for fine-tuning shadows (dark image areas), mid-
tones (mid-level image areas), and highlights (light image areas). If you’ve worked
with Photoshop, you might recognize this command. Premiere Pro’s Levels control
is virtually identical to Photoshop’s. To try out the Levels effect, click and drag the
Levels effect over a clip in one of your video tracks. To see the Levels Settings dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 18-2, click the Setup button in the Effect Controls window.
On the
DVD-ROM

451
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
Figure 18-2: Premiere Pro’s Levels Settings dialog 
box enables you to adjust shadows, midtones, and 
highlights.
In the Levels Settings dialog box, Premiere Pro provides a histogram of the image.
The histogram is a chart that provides a graphical representation of the brightness
levels of the pixels in your image. If the darker pixel levels are shown at the left end
of the histogram, brighter levels are shown to the right of the histogram. The higher
the line, the larger the number of pixels there are that occur at that brightness level.
The lower the line, the fewer the pixels there are that occur at that brightness level.
The Levels dialog box is confusing, because it provides two different sliders with
five different slider controls.
The top slider is called the Input slider. The bottom slider is the Output slider. The
best way to summarize the two sliders is this: Use the top slider to add contrast in
an image; use the bottom slider to decrease contrast in an image.
Increasing contrast
Here’s how to increase contrast in an image. Suppose that the histogram of your
image shows that the darkest area of your image appears at the 10 mark on the
input slider. You can increase contrast in the darkest areas of your image by clicking
and dragging the black input slider to the right. When you click and drag, Premiere
Pro begins to remap the brightness levels in the image by taking all pixels that start
at 10 and remapping them to 0 and then remapping all corresponding pixels. The
result is a darker image with more contrast. Click and drag the white slider to achieve
the same effect with the brightest pixels. In other words, you can increase contrast
in the lightest areas of your image.
To correct your image, you may want to move the midtone slider to the left to lighten
the midtones and drag the midtone slider to the right to darken the midtones, with-
out greatly changing the lightest and darkest parts of an image.

452
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Decreasing contrast
If you have too much contrast in an image, you can lighten an image and reduce
contrast by clicking and dragging the left black (or input) slider. When you reduce
black levels, you are reducing the number of dark pixels in the image. For example,
if you drag the bottom slider from 0 to 10, any pixels that were at 0 are removed
from the image and remapped to 10, and the rest of the pixels in the image are
adjusted accordingly.
To summarize, click and drag the left input slider to 10. Pixels that were 10 are
remapped to 0. Click and drag the bottom slider to 10. Pixels that were 0 are
remapped to 10.
Changing channel levels
The Levels Settings dialog box also enables you to change levels for individual Red,
Green, and Blue channels. For example, to add contrast to the Red channel, choose
red from the pop-up menu in the Levels Settings dialog box. When you pick a chan-
nel, the histogram displays changes to show you the pixel distribution of colors for
only that channel. As you click and drag the highlight slider, you can increase con-
trast in the Red channel. By clicking and dragging the output slider, you can reduce
contrast in the Red channel.
If you frequently use the same levels settings, you can save them to disk by clicking
the Save button. You can reload your settings by clicking the Load button.
Continue to experiment with the Color Balance video effect. When you’re done, you
can remove the effect by clicking the filter in the Effect Controls window and pressing
Delete.
Using other Adjust filters
The other commands in the Adjust folder that affect a video clip’s color are summa-
rized here. (For more information about these filters, see Chapter 14.)
✦Channel Mixer. Use the Channel Mixer video effect to create special effects,
such as sepia or tinted effects.
✦Posterize. The Posterize effect enables you to reduce the number of gray 
levels in your image.
✦Convolution Kernel. Use Convolution Kernel to change the brightness and
sharpness of your image.
✦Extract. The Extract video effect enables you to convert your color clip to
black and white.
✦ProAmp. The ProAmp video effect enables you to adjust the hue, saturation,
and luminance of a clip.
Note

Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
The Image Control effects
Adobe Premiere Pro provides even more color effects in the Image Control folder.
The effects in the Image Control folder are Black & White, Color Balance (HLS),
Color Balance (RGB), Color Corrector, Color Match, Color Offset, Color Pass, Color
Replace, and Tint. (For more information on these effects, see Chapter 14.)
Balancing colors
The Color Balance (RGB) effect enables you to change the balance of a clip’s red,
green, and blue color channels. To use this color-enhancement effect, click and drag
it from the Adjust section of the Video Effects folder in the Effects window and 
drag it over your clip in the video track.
The Effect Controls window shows you the color slides. To see a preview of the
image in the Color Balance dialog box, click Setup in the Effect Controls window, as
shown in Figure 18-3. Try experimenting with each slider. As you work, you’ll put
into practice the RGB color theory.
Figure 18-3: Premiere Pro’s Color
Balance effect enables you to change an
image’s color balance by adjusting red,
green, and blue color components.
✦Click and drag the red slider to the right. As you drag, you gradually pump red
into your image. Drag the slider to the left to decrease red. Note that as you
reduce red, you increase cyan. Cyan is added because you now have more
green and blue in your image. To increase cyan, click and drag both the green
and blue sliders to the right.

454
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
✦Click and drag the green slider to the right. As you drag, you increase green in
your image. Drag to the left to decrease green. As you reduce green, you add
magenta. Magenta is added because you have more red and blue in your image
than green. To add more magenta, click and drag both the red and blue sliders
to the right.
✦Click and drag the blue slider to the right. As you drag, you increase blue in
your image. Drag to the left to decrease blue. As you reduce blue, you add yel-
low. Yellow is added because you have more red and green in your image. You
add even more yellow by clicking and dragging both the red and green sliders
to the right.
Continue to experiment with the Color Balance (RGB) effect. When you’re done, you
can remove the effect by clicking on the filter in the Effect Controls window, then
pressing Delete.
Using HSL Color Balance
Although the RGB color model is used by computer displays to create colors, it’s
not very intuitive. For example, if you want to create a bright orange color or a light
brown color, what RGB combination would you choose? To help provide more intu-
itive colors, the Hue Saturation Lightness (HSL) color model was created. In this
color model, colors are created in much the same way as color is perceived. Hue is
the color, Lightness is the brightness or darkness of the color, and Saturation is the
color intensity. If you don’t want to use Premiere Pro’s RGB Color Balance effect,
you can use its HSL Color Balance effect instead.
To try out the HSL Color Balance effect, open the Image Control folder that is in the
Video Effects folder, inside the Effects window. Then click and drag the HSL Color
Balance effect over a clip in a video track. Because there is no preview in the dialog
box, make sure that the Monitor window is open. You can see the preview of this
effect in the Monitor window.
Try experimenting with the sliders in the Effect Controls window, which is shown in
Figure 18-4. As you drag the slider to the right, it’s as if you are moving around a 
circular color wheel. As you click and drag the slider, you see at what degree of the
circle you are.
Figure 18-4: The HSL Color Balance
effect enables you to adjust color
balance using Hue, Saturation, and
Lightness controls.

455
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
If you want to enter a precise number for a slider, click any numeric value above
the slider. Doing so opens a dialog box in which you can enter a specific value.
The best way to see the effect of the changing hues is to add saturation to your
image. Click and drag the Saturation slider to the right. To see the effect of the light-
ness slider, click and drag first to the right to add more light to the image, and then
to the left to reduce the amount of light.
When you’ve finished experimenting with this filter, click the filter icon in the Effect
Controls window and press Delete. 
Gamma Correction
The Gamma Correction filter changes midtones without affecting shadows and
highlights. This is an easy filter to use if you just want to make sure that the dark
and light areas of your image are in good shape. To use this filter, click and drag the
Gamma Correction filter from the Image Control folder in the Effects window over a
clip. To see a preview of the effect, click the word Setup in the Effect Controls win-
dow. In the Gamma Correction Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 18-5), simply
click and drag the slider. As you click and drag to the right, you increase gamma,
thereby darkening your image. By clicking and dragging to the left, you lighten mid-
tones as you decrease gamma.
Figure 18-5: Premiere Pro’s Gamma Correction
effect enables you to change midtones without
affecting shadows and highlights.
Color Corrector
The Color Corrector filter is new to Premiere Pro. It allows you to make several
color correction adjustments. Click and drag the Color Corrector filter from the
Image Control folder in the Effects window over a clip. Click the triangle in front of
Color Corrector to display the options for this filter (shown in Figure 18-6). Then
click the triangle in front of Settings Key. Notice a folder and a disk icon, shown in
Figure 18-6. You can save the color correction adjustments by clicking on the disk
icon and load them into any project by clicking on the folder icon.

Figure 18-6: Premiere Pro’s Color Corrector effect enables you to make several color
correction adjustments.
Before you start using the Color Corrector filter, click the Split Screen Preview check
box. In the Monitor window, Premiere Pro divides the video clip. The left side of the
clip reveals the clip without any color correction. The right side of the clip reveals
the adjustments being made (shown in Figure 18-6).
Next, move the current-time indicator to the frame where you want to color correct.
If you don’t want the color correction to affect the entire clip, click the stopwatch
icon that is next to Settings Keys to create a keyframe. Make the adjustments needed
for that frame and then move the current-time indicator to another frame and click
the Add/Remove Keyframe button to add another keyframe. Any color corrections
that you make will affect that frame and all the frames between that one and the next
keyframe.
When using the Color Corrector filter, you should color correct using the settings
from top to bottom. The order in which you color correct is very important.
Here is the way to color correct using the Color Corrector filter:
1. Use the Black/White Balance settings to set black, gray, and white points
using the eyedroppers. Use the Black Point eyedropper to click an area in the
clip that should represent black. Use the White Point eyedropper to click an
area in the clip that should represent white. Use the Gray Point eyedropper to
click an area in the clip that should represent gray. The Gray Point eyedropper
tool helps remove color cast from an image.

2. Use the Tonal Range Definition to adjust the shadows, highlights, and mid-
tones. Adjusting the shadows, highlights, and midtones is sometimes called
the three-point color corrector. When using the Tonal Range Definition option,
try switching the Monitor view to Waveform. In the Waveform Monitor (WFM),
shown in Figure 18-7, the black values appear at the bottom and the white val-
ues appear at the top.
Figure 18-7: The Waveform Monitor displays 
video signals.
3. Use Hue Offsets to adjust the Hue and Saturation. Click the black square in
the middle of the wheels to adjust the hue and saturation. As you work with
the Hue Offsets settings, try switching the Monitor view to Vectorscope. The
Vectorscope view, shown in Figure 18-8, displays hue and saturation.
4. Use the HSL setting to adjust the hue, saturation, and luminance. The Tonal
Range pop-up menu allows you to choose whether you are going to adjust the
Master, the Highlights, Midtones, or Shadows. As you work with the HSL set-
tings, try switching the Monitor view to YcbCr Parade. The YcbCr Parade
view, shown in Figure 18-9, displays luma values and chroma saturation.
5. Use the RGB setting to adjust the gamma, pedestal, and gain for the red,
green, and blue colors. The Tonal Range pop-up menu allows you to choose
whether you are going to adjust the Master, the Highlights, Midtones, or
Shadows. As you work with the RGB settings, try switching the Monitor view
to RGB Parade. The RGB Parade view, shown in Figure 18-10, displays the val-
ues of red, green, and blue colors.

The master curve adjusts all the colors in the clip. The other curves adjust
the separate color channels. Click and drag either up or down on the curve 
to adjust the colors.
7. Use the Video Limiter to set the video system to the system to which you
will be outputting.
8. When you are finished color correcting, be sure to deselect the Split Screen
preview from the Setting Keys section.
9. If you want to save the color correcting settings, click the disk icon in the
Setting Keys section.
Color Match
The Color Match filter is new to Premiere Pro. The Color Match filter, shown in
Figure 18-11, allows you to match colors from one footage to another. When using
this filter, you may want to use the Reference monitor view. This way, you can see
one footage in the Monitor view and the other in the Reference view.
To use the Color Match filter, use the eyedropper to choose a target color and a
sample color. The target color is the color that you want to match. The sample
color is the color that you want to adjust so that it matches the target color. After
you have set the target and sample color, click the Match button located in the
Match section.

The Video folder effects
The effects in the Video folder are designed to improve clips that will be exported to
videotape. The effects in the Video folder are Broadcast colors, Field Interpolate, and
Reduce Interlace Flicker. For more information on video effects, refer to Chapter 14.
Broadcast colors
To use the Broadcast Color effect, click and drag the effect from the Video Effects
folder from the Effects window over a clip in a video track in the Timeline window.
If you are exporting your Premiere production to videotape, you can add color bars
to the beginning of your production. Color bars enable a video production facility
to calibrate colors when duplicating or broadcasting video. Adding color bars is
discussed in Chapter 2.
The sliders and controls for the effect appear in the Effect Controls window. To 
use the effect, choose either NTSC for American television or PAL for European 
television in the Broadcast locale pop-up menu. Then choose a method in the How
to Make Colors Safe pop-up menu. Here is an explanation of the choices:
✦Reduce Luminance. Reduces pixel brightness values. As the values are
reduced, colors become darker.
✦Reduce Saturation. Brings pixel values closer to gray. This makes the colors
less intense.
Note

461
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
✦Key out Unsafe. Colors that fall beyond the TV gamut become transparent.
✦Key in Safe. Colors that are within the TV gamut are transparent.
In the Maximum Signal Field, use the slider to enter the maximum IRE (or image
luminance) breakpoint value. Any levels above this value are altered. If you are
unsure of what value to use, use the default setting of 110.
In some video cameras, black and white stripes appear in the viewfinder when an
image’s brightness surpasses 100 IRE. This indicates that the image luminance is
too bright.
Field Interpolate and Reduce Interlace Flicker
Two other image-enhancing effects appear in the Video folder: Field Interpolate and
Reduce Interlace Flicker.
✦Field Interpolate. This effect creates missing scan lines from the average of
other lines.
✦Reduce Interlace Flicker. This effect softens horizontal lines in an attempt to
reduce interlace flicker.
Adobe After Effects uses many of the same color-correcting techniques as Adobe
Premiere Pro. However, After Effects has a powerful advantage: It enables you to
mask or isolate areas onscreen. After you mask an area, you can choose to color
correct the masked area only.
To color correct a Premiere project in After Effects, load the Premiere project into
After Effects by choosing File ➪Import. (For more information on working with
masks in After Effects, turn to Chapter 29.) After you’ve completed color correcting
in After Effects, you can export your file as a QuickTime or AVI movie and load it
into Premiere Pro.
Retouching and Color Correcting 
with Photoshop
Although Premiere Pro provides a variety of controls for correcting colors, you may
need to make a specific adjustment to an image area and may want to use Adobe
Photoshop. You can export a Premiere clip to Adobe Photoshop in Filmstrip format
or TIFF, PICT, or Targa Sequence format. Adobe specifically designed Filmstrip for-
mat to act as a bridge between Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop. When a
Premiere Pro clip is loaded into Photoshop, you can see each individual frame and
use Photoshop’s extensive color-correcting toolset to correct the image.
Note
Note

462
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
You can also use Photoshop’s powerful masking utilities to isolate areas and then
manipulate the shade and colors. Once in Photoshop, you can copy and paste
images from one frame to another, or you can select and copy a person from a pho-
tograph, for example, and paste it into your video clip. You can also omit a person
from a video clip by cloning surrounding areas or by painting over it with the
Paintbrush. Figure 18-12 shows a frame from a video clip before masking and color
correcting. Figure 18-13 shows the same frame after masking and color correcting.
Figure 18-12: Frame from a video clip
before masking and color correcting.
Figure 18-13: Frame from a video clip
after masking and color correcting.
Before you take a person out of a video clip or add a person to a video clip, check
whether you need permission to do so. This is especially so if you are going to
publish or distribute the video you are creating. Make sure that you have permis-
sion from the people who appear in the video.
Loading a video clip into Photoshop
Before you can manipulate your video clip in Photoshop, you need to convert the
video clip to Filmstrip format. Here’s how to export a Premiere clip to Photoshop in
Filmstrip format:
Note

463
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
1. Load or create a Premiere project. If you are in a new Premiere project, open a
clip by choosing File ➪Open, or import a clip by choosing File ➪Import ➪File.
You can use the Gondola video clip found in Chapter 18, which is in the Tutorial
Projects on the DVD that accompanies this book.
2. If you used File ➪Open to open a clip, choose File ➪Export Clip ➪Movie. If
you used File ➪Import to import a file into the Timeline window, choose
File ➪Export Timeline ➪Movie.
3. In the Export Movie dialog box, name your movie.
4. Click the Settings button to display the Export Movie Settings dialog box.
The Export Movie Settings dialog box appears. 
5. Click the File Type option and choose Filmstrip. Note that you can also
choose to use the TIFF, PICT, or Targa Sequence formats.
6. Click the Range pop-up menu. If you have opened a clip, choose Entire Clip
to export the entire clip. Choose In to Out to export a clip whose in and out
points have been edited. If you have imported a clip to the Timeline window,
choose Entire Project to export the entire project. Choose Work Area to
export only the area where the preview bar is located.
7. Click OK. Premiere Pro exports your project into a Filmstrip file, which you
can then import into Photoshop.
Premiere Pro’s Export Movie Settings determine the frame size, frame rate, and
other features of the exported file. The export settings are covered in detail in
Chapter 19.
Use the following steps to import a Premiere Filmstrip file into Photoshop:
1. In Photoshop, choose File ➪Open. The Open dialog box opens.
2. Locate the Filmstrip file. Before you open the file, click on the file. Notice 
that in the Open dialog box, next to the Filmstrip format, the size of your file
appears. The file size may surprise you. Remember that when you open a
Filmstrip file in Photoshop, you are opening a video clip that contains various
frames at the width and height of your clip. Therefore, the Photoshop file may
be very large. Make sure that your system can handle the file. If the file is too
big, you may need to go back to Premiere Pro and use the in and out points to
cut some frames out of the video clip. Then re-export the file in Filmstrip for-
mat, and reopen in Photoshop.
3. Click Open. The Filmstrip file loads with the file reduced in size so that you
can see all the frames in the file (see Figure 18-14). The more frames in your
document, the smaller the frame preview.
Note

Filmstrip files may be large and sometimes slow to work on.
4. Choose View ➪Zoom In a few times to enlarge the size of the frame pre-
view. When the Filmstrip window is enlarged, you can see the frame preview
for only a few frames, as shown in Figure 18-15. Scroll down to see the rest of
the frames in the video clip. Notice that below each frame appears the Timeline
number. Also notice that the document size appears at the bottom left of the
document.
Press Ctrl++ a few times to zoom.

The following sections provide an overview of several of Photoshop’s image-
enhancing commands. For full details on these commands, consult the Photoshop
manual.
Using Selections in Photoshop
One of the best reasons for using Photoshop to make color and tonal adjustments is
its masking capabilities. In Photoshop, you can select an image area with a selec-
tion tool, such as the Magic Wand or Lasso tool, and then execute an image adjust-
ment command. When the command is applied, Photoshop only applies it to the
selected area.

466
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Selecting a color range
If you are selecting image areas in a Filmstrip file or sequence files, it is handy to
quickly create a selection that spans multiple frames. You can easily create a selec-
tion throughout many frames using Photoshop’s Color Range command. Follow these
steps to select a color range:
1. To open the Color Range dialog box, shown in Figure 18-16, choose Select ➪
Color Range.
Figure 18-16: Photoshop’s Color Range
command enables you to select parts of an
image by color.
2. To select a color range, set the Select menu to Sampled Colors.
3. Click the Image radio button.
4. Choose Grayscale in the Selection Preview menu. The image appears
onscreen in the dialog box’s preview area with the selected area in black and
white.
5. With the Eyedropper tool selected, click in the image area of the dialog box
that you want to select. As soon as you click, all colors that match the color
you clicked turn white onscreen.
6. Click and drag the Fuzziness slider to fine-tune the selection.
7. Use the Eyedropper + tool to click on the image area you want to add to the
selection. To subtract from the selection, click in the preview image area in
the dialog box with the Eyedropper – tool.
8. Click OK. The final selection appears onscreen.
Saving selections to alpha channels
Photoshop enables you to save selections and edit them as grayscale mask images
in its Channels palette. This provides a sophisticated method of creating an intri-
cate selection. A detailed description of editing masks is beyond the scope of this
book. However, the following is a quick review of the steps needed to save a selec-
tion as a mask, and to edit the mask:

467
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
1. Create a rough selection onscreen using one of Photoshop’s selection tools,
such as one of the Lasso tools or the Magic Wand.
While using one of the selection tools, press and hold the Shift key to add to a
selection. Press and hold the Alt key to subtract from a selection.
2. To create a mask out of the selection in an alpha channel, choose Select ➪
Save Selection. In the Save Selection dialog box, name the selection and then
click Save. You can edit it using Photoshop’s painting tools.
3. Activate the mask channel so that you can still see your image onscreen.
To do this, select the channel in the Channels palette to activate the channel
for editing and display the mask’s eye icon. A red overlay indicates the mask
edges.
4. Select a painting tool, such as the Paintbrush or Pencil.
5. Choose a brush size. Make sure that the painting tool is in normal mode, with
opacity set to 100%. Try painting over your image. Try painting with white; try
painting with black. If Photoshop’s default settings are in effect, painting with
white enlarges the mask; painting with black reduces the size of the mask. To
fine-tune the mask, choose a small brush size and zoom into your image to
edit it.
6. After you finish editing the mask, reselect the RGB channel in the Channels
palette.
7. Choose Select ➪Load Selection. Photoshop converts the mask into a blinking
selection onscreen and is ready for use in image correction.
To save a file with saved selections in channels, you must save your file in
Photoshop format. When you are finished with the saved selections, you can
delete the channels by dragging the channel in the Channels palette to the trash.
If you don’t want to delete the saved selections, you may want to make a copy of
the file. Remember, you can’t import a Photoshop file into Premiere Pro as a
Filmstrip; instead, Premiere will import the Photoshop file as a still image. Thus, to
save a Photoshop file in Filmstrip format, which can be imported into Premiere
Pro, choose File ➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, choose the Filmstrip format.
Using Photoshop’s Image Adjust Commands
This section reviews several Photoshop image-correcting commands that can be
useful if you are making color or tonal adjustments to Filmstrip files. Our goal here is
to introduce you to these commands, not to make you Photoshop color-correcting
experts. If you find that your video clip requires hours and hours of enhancement
work in Photoshop, you should consider whether your time might be better spent
reshooting or restructuring your Premiere production so that you can use clips that
don’t need a lot of color correction.
Note
Tip

468
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
To quickly retouch and/or color correct various frames in a clip, you can use
Photoshop’s Actions palette to process through TIFF, PICT, or TARGA sequence files
to open a file, apply an Image Adjust command, save, and close a file.
Using the Info palette
Before you start color-correcting a clip, you should display the Info palettes that
you can see the values of the colors that you are affecting. Choose Window ➪Show
Info to display the Info palette. The Info palette, shown in Figure 18-17, displays the
individual RGB colors as you move the Eyedropper tool over an image. (If the RGB
colors don’t appear, click the Info palette pop-up menu and choose Palette Options.
In the Info Options dialog box, choose Actual Color from the Mode pop-up menu.)
To see the values of your image, move the mouse over your image. As you move the
mouse, notice the color values in the Info palette. As soon as you start color cor-
recting, these values change. You can check the values while you are using a dialog
box to color correct. In the Info palette, a before and after value appears.
At this point, you should decide whether your image needs simple tonal adjust-
ments or more advanced tonal and color corrections.
Figure 18-17: Photoshop’s Info palette displays a
reading of the colors in your image.
Brightness/Contrast
If your image needs minor color adjustments, use the Image ➪Adjust ➪Brightness/
Contrast command. This command works identically to Premiere Pro’s Brightness &
Contrast video effect. However, in Photoshop, you can select a portion of your image
and then apply the command to adjust the image.
As you are working with Photoshop’s color-correcting commands, you can reset
the dialog box options back to their original settings by pressing Alt and then click-
ing the Cancel button.
Levels
If your image needs more sophisticated tonal adjustments or if you need to make
overall adjustments to a red, green, or blue image channel, use Photoshop’s Levels
command. To open the Levels dialog box, shown in Figure 18-18, choose Image ➪
Adjust ➪Levels.
Tip
Tip

469
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
Figure 18-18: The Levels command is used 
to lighten the first frame of the Gondola 
video clip.
Photoshop’s Levels dialog box works similarly to Premiere Pro’s Levels dialog box.
However, in Photoshop, if you select an area onscreen, the histogram that appears
charts the pixel distribution in the selected area.
In the Levels dialog box, click Save to save the settings in the Levels dialog box. In
the dialog box that appears next, name the setting and then click Save. After you
save the Levels settings, close the dialog box by clicking OK. Now that you’ve saved
the Levels settings, you can add them to other clips.
Curves
Photoshop’s Curves command is considered one of its most powerful tools for
adjusting image tones. Unlike the Levels command, which focuses on highlights,
midtones, and shadow areas, the Curves command enables you to make tonal
adjustments throughout an image’s brightness range. And as you make adjust-
ments, you can lock in up to 15 points on the curve.
To open Photoshop’s Curves dialog box, choose Image ➪Adjust ➪Curves. In the
Curves dialog box, shown in Figure 18-19, the x-axis of the dialog box represents the
original image values, and the y-axis represents the values that are changed. Because
all points are equal when you begin, the Curves dialog box opens by displaying a
straight diagonal line.
To make adjustments using the curve, start by examining the horizontal axis. The
left-end of the horizontal axis represents darker areas of the original image; brighter
areas are represented on the right side of the horizontal axis. (This is the default set-
ting. If the default setting has been changed, to appear in percentages rather than in
a range from 0 to 255, click the middle of the curve to change the horizontal axis to
its default setting.) A quick way to pinpoint where image areas are represented on
the curve is to simply click in your image. As you click, a dot appears in the corre-
sponding area on the curve.

470
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Figure 18-19: Photoshop’s Curves 
dialog box.
To lighten an image area, click and drag up on the curve; to darken an area, click
and drag down. As you drag, the curve shows how the rest of the pixels in the image
change. To prevent part of the curve from changing, you can click the curve to
establish fixed points. As you click and drag, the fixed points lock down the curve.
As with Photoshop’s Levels command, Curves also enables you to change the tonal
range of individual color channels. To select a channel, choose Red, Green, or Blue
from the Channels pop-up menu. If you click and drag a curve representing a chan-
nel, dragging upward increases that channel’s color in the image, whereas dragging
downward reduces it and adds that color’s complements. For example, if you select
the Green channel, dragging up adds more green and dragging down on the curve
adds more magenta.
Variations
If you want to perform a simple correction of shadows, midtones, highlights, and
colors in an image and are not a Photoshop expert, try the Variations command.
This enables you to color correct visually. To open the Variations dialog box,
choose Image ➪Adjust ➪Variations.
In the Variations dialog box, shown in Figure 18-20, move the slider at the top
toward Finer so that the changes occur gradually. Then choose whether you want
to adjust Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights. To lighten the frames, click the Lighter
thumbnail. Notice that as the image in the current pick area changes, the original
image remains the same. As you make adjustments, the current pick always shows
the last change that you made. If you want to return the image to its original state,
click the Original image frame.

471
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
Figure 18-20: Photoshop’s Variations dialog box 
enables you to adjust the shadows, midtones, 
highlights, and colors in an image.
Sometimes after lightening an image, the image may look washed out. To add color
to the image, click the color thumbnails. For example, to increase Red values in an
image, click the More Red button. Keep clicking More Red until you’ve added the
correct amount. But what if there’s too much red in an image? Notice that there
isn’t a Less Red button. To remove red, you must add more of red’s complement,
which is cyan. Therefore, to remove red, click Add Cyan.
Hue/Saturation
To adjust the lightness and intensity of a color, use Photoshop’s Hue/Saturation
command. This command is far more sophisticated than Premiere Pro’s HSL Color
Balance command. Using Photoshop’s Hue/Saturation command, you can focus on
specific colors to change as well as set a hue range that you want to change.
To display the Hue/Saturation dialog box, shown in Figure 18-21, choose Image ➪
Adjust ➪Hue/Saturation. The easiest way to use the Hue/Saturation command is to
leave the Edit mode set to Master. In this mode, the Hue/Saturation is somewhat akin
to Premiere Pro’s HSL Color Balance. For example, you can change image color values
in the frames by clicking and dragging the Hue slider. To change the intensity of a
color, move the Saturation slider. To change the lightness of the frames, move the
Lightness slider.

472
Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Photoshop surpasses Premiere Pro by providing before and after color bars at the
bottom of the Color palette. The top color bar represents how colors appear before
the adjustment; the bottom shows how those colors will change as you click and
drag the slider.
Figure 18-21: The Hue/Saturation dialog box 
enables you to change the lightness and 
intensity of colors.
You can also use the Hue/Saturation command to colorize a grayscale filmstrip. To
do this, click the Colorize button and drag the Hue slider to the desired color.
The Hue/Saturation command also provides a more advanced mode, if you want to
adjust a specific color range. To do this, choose Reds, Yellows, Greens, Cyans,
Blues, or Magentas in the Edit pop-up menu. When you do this, the bottom color
bar enables you to specify a more exact range of colors to adjust.
Photoshop also features a Replace Colors command (Image ➪Adjust ➪Replace
Colors). This command is a combination of the Color Range command and the
Hue/Saturation command. You can use the Replace Colors command to isolate a
range of colors and replace the colors with a new color chosen from the Replace
Colors Hue ➪Saturation ➪Lightness sliders.
Color Balance
Photoshop’s Color Balance command provides a method of changing the overall
balance of colors in an image. Although Photoshop’s Color Balance command is
similar to Premiere Pro’s Color Balance command, Photoshop’s command enables
you to focus your attention on shadows, midtones, or highlights.
Note
Note

473
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
Use Adobe Photoshop CS’s new Shadow/Highlight correction to maintain an
image's overall color balance, while adjusting the shadow and highlight areas of
the image.
To open the Color Balance dialog box, which is shown in Figure 18-22, choose Image➪
Adjust ➪Color Balance. The dialog box is easy to use. Decide whether you want to
focus on shadows, midtones, or highlights. Then click and drag to adjust the sliders.
The dialog box clearly shows how RGB colors relate to their complements. As dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter, reducing red adds cyan; reducing green adds magenta;
reducing blue adds yellow.
The Preserve Luminosity check box helps ensure that the brightness levels of the
image are maintained as you edit the color balance.
Figure 18-22: The Color Balance dialog box 
adjusts the RGB and CMY colors.
Using Photoshop to add and delete 
people from video clips
You can use Photoshop to copy a person into a video clip or to remove a person
from a video clip. (However, the practicality of performing such an operation may
be limited in many video clips involving action or motion.) You can use the tech-
niques described in this section for still images, or to create interesting special
effects. For example, you may want to create or paint an object from scratch in
Photoshop and then place it in a video frame. The combination of the realistic and
the artistic may be quite interesting.
Figure 18-23 shows a video clip before a person was added. Figure 18-24 shows the

Here’s how to add a person or an object into a video clip:
1. Load Photoshop.
2. Choose File ➪Open to open a file of an image that has the person or object
that you want to add to the clip. Note that the person or object you want to
add to the video clip may not be in a photograph — the person or object may
be in another video clip. In that case, you need to save that video clip in
Filmstrip format and open it in Photoshop.
You can use the Mamina.psd file found in the Chapter 18 folder, in the Tutorial
Projects folder, on the DVD that accompanies this book.
3. Use one of Photoshop’s selection tools to select the person or object. For
intricate selection, you should create a selection with a selection tool and
then use Photoshop’s masking tools to edit the mask with a painting tool.

DVD-ROM

475
Chapter 18 ✦Enhancing Video
4. After you’ve completed the masking process, reload the selection by 
choosing File ➪Load Selection.
5. Choose Edit ➪Copy.
6. Now choose File ➪Open to open the Filmstrip video clip to which you want
to add the object or person. In Figure 18-23, we used the waterscene.mov video
clip. The waterscene.mov video is in Chapter 18 folder, in the Tutorial Projects
folder, on the DVD that accompanies this book.
7. Choose Edit➪Paste to paste the person into the Filmstrip video clip. You may
need to reduce the size of the person. If so, choose Edit ➪Transform ➪Scale
to scale the image. (When you paste the object or person into the file, you are
pasting that person into a new layer. Choose Window ➪Show Layers to open
the Layers palette. Notice the new layer with the person in it.)
8. Use the Move tool to move the person into the frame in which the person is
to appear. To add the person to more than one frame, you must copy the layer
that the person is in. Click and drag over the New Layer icon in the Layers
palette with the person to make a copy. Then use the Move tool to move it
into place. When you copy and paste in Photoshop, a new layer is created.
Remember to flatten the image so that you can resave the file in Filmstrip 
format and open it in Premiere Pro.
You may want to use the grid and/or rulers (View ➪Show Rulers or View ➪Show
Grid) to place the person/object in the same position in every frame.
Here’s how to omit or remove a person or an object from a video clip:
1. Choose File ➪Open to open the Filmstrip clip that contains the person or
object that you want to remove.
2. Locate the frame with the person or object.
3. Remove the person or object with one of these techniques:
• Use the Rubber Stamp tool to clone surrounding areas over the area that
you want to remove. After you clone the object from one frame, you may
be able to copy and paste that area into other frames.
• Use the Airbrush, Paintbrush, and/or Pencil tools to paint over the area.
4. Resave the file in Filmstrip format. If you executed a copy and paste com-
mand, Photoshop automatically creates a new layer. Remember to remove the
layers by flattening the image so that you can resave the file in Filmstrip or use
the Save As command to save in Filmstrip. After the file is saved in Filmstrip
format, it can be reloaded into Premiere Pro.

Part IV ✦Advanced Techniques and Special Effects
Summary
If your video clips need color correction or if they need brightness or contrast
enhanced, you can use Adobe Premiere Pro’s Video Effects. The Adjust, Image
Control, and Video folders all contain effects that can enhance video.
✦Use the Brightness and Contrast effect to quickly correct clips that don’t need
sophisticated adjustments.
✦Use the Levels effect to add or reduce contrast and to enhance midtone areas.
✦Use the Color Balance effect to adjust the Red, Green, and Blue channels in an
image.
✦Use Premiere Pro’s new Color Corrector to make various corrections with one
filter.
✦If Premiere Pro’s image-enhancement commands aren’t sufficient, you can
export your Premiere file as a Filmstrip file and correct it in Adobe Photoshop.
✦Apart from correcting colors and tonal values in Photoshop, you can also add
or remove image areas from video clips.

Exporting AVI,
QuickTime, and
MPEG Movies
A
fter you’ve completed the finishing touches on your
Adobe Premiere Pro project, you’re ready to export the
production as a digital movie. When you export the file, you
can output it to videotape, or you can export it to disk for
viewing on another computer system. If you export your
Premiere Pro project as a QuickTime, Video for Windows, or
MPEG file, you can easily view it on most Macs and PCs by
simply double-clicking the exported video movie. Movies
saved in QuickTime or Video for Windows can be integrated
into other multimedia programs, such as Adobe After Effects,
Macromedia Director, or Macromedia Flash. MPEG files can be
used on the Web, but they’re most valuable to Premiere Pro
users who want to output their projects to DVD. The
Hollywood movies and music videos you see on DVDs are
encoded in MPEG format before the DVD is burned.
This chapter explains how to export Premiere Pro projects
into QuickTime, Video for Windows, or MPEG files. It covers
the simple steps you need to execute to begin the export pro-
cess and then focuses on key export settings, such as choos-
ing a compressor, keyframes, and data rates.
In this book, we divide the exporting procedure into dif-
ferent chapters — this chapter, which covers exporting
QuickTime, Video for Windows, and MPEG movies, and
Chapter 20, which covers exporting to the Web. Later,
Chapter 21 discusses how to export your Premiere Pro
project using the Advanced Windows Media and RealVideo
Export plug-ins. Chapter 22 covers exporting to videotape.

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
Beginning the Export Process
After you edit your work and preview your production, you can export your project
by activating the sequence you want to export and then choosing File ➪Export ➪
Movie. Doing so opens the Export Movie dialog box, shown in Figure 19-1. At the
bottom-left of the screen, Premiere Pro displays the current video and audio settings.
If you want to export using these settings, simply name the file and click Save. The
length of time Premiere Pro takes to render the final movie depends on the size of
your production, its frame rate, frame size, and compression settings.
Figure 19-1: The Export Movie dialog box displays the current 
video and audio settings for your Premiere Pro project.
You can export a frame by moving the Timeline indicator to it and then choosing
File ➪Export ➪Frame.
If you exported the movie in Video for Windows (called Microsoft AVI in the Export
Movie Settings dialog box) format, your movie can be viewed on systems running
Microsoft Windows. Mac users can also view AVI movies by importing them into the
latest version of Apple’s QuickTime Movie player. On the Web, most Windows have
switched from AVI format to Microsoft’s Advanced Windows Media format (covered
in Chapter 21). However, AVI format is still accepted as a format that can be imported
into many multimedia software programs.
Note

481
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
Video for Windows files are saved with an AVI (audio video interleave) file exten-
sion. Video for Windows files are often referred to as AVI files.
Changing Export Settings
Although the video and audio settings used during the creation of a Premiere Pro
project may be perfect during editing, they may not produce the best quality for
specific viewing environments. For example, a digital movie with a large frame size
and high frame rate may not play well at slow Web connection speeds. Thus, you
may want to change several export settings before saving your export file to disk, if
you expect your project to be viewed on the Web. To change export settings, click
the Settings button in the Export Movie dialog box. (If the Export Movie dialog box
is not onscreen, you can display it by choosing File ➪Export ➪Movie.)
After you click Settings, the Export Movie Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 19-2,
appears. When this dialog box opens, the pop-up menu at the top of the screen is
automatically set to the General setting.
Figure 19-2: The Export Movie Settings dialog box.
Following is a description of the choices available in the Export Movie Settings 
dialog box:
✦File Type. If you want to switch file types, you can use this menu. Apart from
picking a QuickTime or AVI format, you can also choose to save your digital
movie as a series of still frames in different file formats, such as GIF, TIF,
Windows Bitmap, or QuickTime.

✦Range. Choose to export the Entire Sequence or the Work Area specified in
the Timeline.
✦Export Video. Deselect if you do not want to export the video.
✦Export Audio. Deselect if you do not want to export the audio.
✦Add to Project When Finished. Adds the exported movie to the Project 
window.
✦Beep When Finished. Causes your computer to beep when the project is 
finished.
✦Embedding Options. Allows you to create a link between the original project
and the exported movie. To create the link, choose Project in the Embedding
Options drop-down menu. Once the link is created, you can open the original
project by selecting the exported movie in the Project window of another pro-
ject and then choosing Edit ➪Edit Original. Note that this option isn’t avail-
able for all export choices.
Changing Video Settings
To review or change Video settings, choose Video in the pop-up menu at the top 
of the Export Movie Settings screen. The video settings reflect the currently used
project settings.
Choosing a QuickTime compressor
When creating a project, capturing video, or exporting a Premiere Pro project, one
of the most important decisions you can make is to choose the correct compression
settings. A compressor or CODEC (COmpression/DECompression) determines exactly
how the computer restructures or removes data to make the digital video file smaller.
Although most compression settings are designed to compress files, not all of these
settings are suitable for all types of projects. The trick is to choose the best CODEC
for your Premiere Pro project to produce the best quality with the smallest file size.
One CODEC may be better for Web digital video, and another might be best suited
to a project that contains animation created in a painting program.
The settings that appear in the Compressor pop-up menu are based upon the file type
chosen in the Export Movie Settings dialog box. The QuickTime CODECs, shown 
in Figure 19-3, are different from the Video for Windows CODECs. Furthermore,
depending on the compressor, the options in the Video section of the Export Movie
Settings dialog box change.

483
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
Figure 19-3: The QuickTime CODECs.
Following is a brief review of many of the QuickTime CODEC choices available in
the Export Movie Settings dialog box:
✦Animation. Used for creating high-quality output. This setting is particularly
useful for animation created in graphics painting programs. Using this com-
pressor, you can set the bit depth to Millions+ (of colors), which enables
exporting an alpha channel with the movie. If you choose the 100% option,
Animation provides lossless compression. This results in smaller file sizes
than simply choosing None in the Compression box. Choose this setting for
storing high-quality animated titles.
✦Cinepak. This format is one of the most popular for Web and multimedia
work. Working with Cinepak can be time-consuming because the compression
time is sometimes long; you’ll have to wait longer for previews and for final
video. However, the recompression time or playback is not slow. When export-
ing, you can also set the data rate using Cinepak, but be aware that setting the
data rate below 30K per second can lower the quality of the video.
✦MJPEG-A, MJPEG-B. Used for editing and capturing video. These CODECs can
provide very good results when quality is set to 100%. Both CODECs use spa-
tial compression, so no keyframe control is available. Also, MJPEG usually
requires a hardware board for playback.
✦Sorenson. Used for high-quality desktop video for the Web and for CD-ROM.
This CODEC provides better compression than Cinepak. Sorenson can reduce
file sizes by three to four times as much as Cinepak does. Compression can be
time-consuming, so use this setting for exporting but not for editing.
Sorenson also sells a high-end version of the Sorenson CODEC that provides bet-
ter quality and more features.
Note

484
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
✦Planar RGB. A lossless CODEC good for animation created in painting and 3-D
programs, and an alternative to the Animation CODEC.
✦Video. Can be used for video editing, but not for exporting.
✦Component Video. Generally used for capturing analog video. Not used when
creating or exporting a project. When you capture video, this may be your only
choice, depending on the video capture board installed in your computer.
✦Graphics. Used for graphics with 256 colors or less; generally not used in
desktop video.
✦Photo-JPEG. Although this CODEC can create good image quality, slow
decompression makes this CODEC unsuitable for desktop video.
✦H.263. Used for video conferencing and provides better quality than the H.261
CODEC. This CODEC is not recommended for video editing.
✦PNG. Generally not used for motion graphics. This CODEC is included in
QuickTime as a means of saving still graphics in PNG Web format.
✦TIF. Tagged Information File Format. A printing format for still images.
✦BMP. A Windows-compatible graphics format for still images.
✦DV-PAL and DV-NTSC. Digital video format for NTSC and PAL (choose the for-
mat that applies to the geographic region for your intended audience), used
for transferring digitized data from DV camcorders or from camcorders into
Premiere Pro. Useful format for capturing video that is transferred to another
video-editing system.
✦None. No compression is used. Premiere Pro creates preview files faster at
this setting, but file sizes are very large.
The QuickTime CODECs list may contain hardware-specific CODECs supplied by
computer and board manufacturers. For instance, Sony Vaio computer owners see
a Sony DV format in the QuickTime CODEC list. Follow the instructions provided
with your capture board or computer when choosing one of these CODECs.
Choosing a Video for Windows compressor
If you are exporting a Video for Windows file, the compressor choices are different
from the QuickTime choices. Following is a brief review of frequently used AVI
CODECs:
✦Cinepak. Originally created by Radius, provides the same features as
QuickTime’s Cinepak. This CODEC is primarily used for multimedia output.
Compression can be time-consuming, but image quality is generally good.
✦Indeo Video 5.10. Created by Intel (makers of the Pentium computer chip),
this CODEC provides good image quality. Often used for capturing raw data.
Quality is similar to desktop video produced using the Cinepak CODEC.
Note

485
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
✦Microsoft RLE (Run Length Encoding). The bit depth for this CODEC is limited
to 256 colors, making it only suitable for animation created in painting pro-
grams with 256 colors, or images that have been reduced to 256 colors. When
the Quality slider is set to High, this CODEC produces lossless compression.
Changing bit depth
After you choose a CODEC, the dialog box changes to show the different options
provided by that CODEC. If your CODEC enables you to change bit depth, you can
choose another setting in the Bit Depth pop-up menu. For instance, the Sorenson
CODEC does not enable you to switch bit depths. However, the Cinepak CODEC
enables you to choose 256 colors. Because the Cinepak CODEC allows 256 colors,
clicking the Palette button enables you to either load a palette or have Premiere 
Pro create a 256-color palette from the clips in the movie. However, be aware that
reducing the palette to 256 colors could result in poor picture quality. Unless you
are working with animation created in a painting program, you probably will not
want to reduce the colors in your video project to 256.
Choosing quality
The next option controlled by the selected CODEC is the Quality slider. Most CODECs
enable you to click and drag to choose a quality setting. The higher the quality, the
larger the file size of the exported movie.
Choosing a data rate
Many CODECs enable you to specify an output data rate. The data rate is the amount
of data per second that must be processed during playback of the exported video
file. The data rate changes, depending on which system plays your production. For
instance, the data rate of CD-ROM playback on a slow computer is far less than the
data rate of a hard disk. If the data rate of the video file is too high, the system will
not be able to handle the playback. If this is the case, playback may be garbled as
frames are dropped. Following are a few suggestions for different playback scenarios:
✦World Wide Web. Choose a data rate that accounts for Web connection speeds.
Remember, even though a modem may be capable of 56 Kbps (kilobits per
second), the actual connection speed is probably slower. Also remember that
the data rate field accepts data in kilobits per second, rather than bits per
second. For Sorenson and Cinepak CODECs, try a data rate of 50. Adobe rec-
ommends trying a data rate of 150K per second for movies with a frame size
of 240 × 180. Note that when uploading to the Web, smaller file size is more
important than data rate.
✦Videotape editing. If you are exporting video files for further editing, the data
rate should be set so that the computer editing system can handle it. To
export for further editing, use a CODEC that does not reduce video quality,
such as a DV CODEC, or the Animation CODEC.

486
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
✦CD-ROM. For CD-ROM playback, specify a data rate consistent with the data
rate of the CD-ROM drive. The data rate setting is especially important for older
CD-ROM drives. For example, a double-speed CD-ROM has a data rate at 300K
per second. Adobe recommends setting the data rate in this case from 150–200.
For 12-speed CD-ROMs, the recommended data rate is 1.8MB per second; for
24-speed CD-ROMs, the recommended data rate is 3–3.6MB per second.
✦Intranets. The data rate speed depends upon the actual speed of the network.
Because most intranets use high-speed connections, you can generally set the
playback to 100K or more.
✦Hard disk. If you are creating a production for playback on a computer system,
try to ascertain the data rate of the audience’s hard disk. The data rates for
most modern hard disks are in excess of 33 million bits per second.
Adobe’s Support Knowledgebase document “Applying Data Rate Limits in Premiere
Pro” is available online at www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/a60a.htm.
Setting recompression
If you specify a data rate, select the Recompress check box. Doing this helps guar-
antee that Premiere Pro keeps the data rate beneath the one specified in the data
rate field. If you want Premiere Pro to recompress every frame, whether or not it is
below the data rate, choose Always in the Recompress pop-up menu. Better quality
is produced, however, if you choose the Maintain Data Rate setting. This only recom-
presses frames that are higher than the specified data rate.
Changing frame rates and frame size
Before exporting video, you may want to reduce the frame rate or reduce the frame
size to reduce the file size of your production. The frame rate is the number of frames
Premiere Pro exports per second. If you change frame size, be sure to specify the hor-
izontal and vertical dimensions in pixels. If your video was captured at a 4:3 aspect
ratio, be sure to maintain this ratio to avoid distorting clips.
Specifying keyframes
Another video export setting that can control export file size is the Keyframe setting
in the Export Movie Settings dialog box’s Keyframe and Rendering section (see
Figure 19-4).
Keyframe settings can be changed when choosing CODECs, such as Cinepak and
Sorenson video, with temporal compression. The keyframe setting specifies how
many times to save the complete video frame. If the keyframe setting is set at 15, a
keyframe is created every 15 frames. As the CODEC compresses, it compares each
subsequent frame and only saves the information that changes in each frame. Thus,
using keyframes can significantly reduce the file size of your video.
Note

487
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
Figure 19-4: The Keyframe and Rendering section of the Export Movie 
Settings dialog box.
A good starting point is to enter the number of keyframes per second that match
the number of frames per second. So, if your frame rate is 30 frames per second, 
set the keyframe rate to 30. This creates one keyframe for every 30 frames of video.
Enter 60 to create one keyframe every two seconds. If you want more keyframes,
lower the number in the keyframe field. When setting keyframes, it is often recom-
mended that the number of keyframes should evenly divide into the frame rate. Also,
images displaying motion generally require more keyframes than images without a
lot of motion.
To help ensure smooth transitions, you may want to force Premiere Pro to create a
keyframe at transitions and edits. To set keyframes at Edit points, select the Add
Keyframes at Edits option in the Export Movie Settings dialog box. To set keyframes
at specific points in your production, set Markers at points where you want Premiere
Pro to create a keyframe and then select the Add Keyframe at Markers option in the
Export Movie Settings dialog box.
To see a visual representation of the keyframes in a clip, select it in the Project
window, then choose Clip ➪Properties. Next click Data Rate. The Red Bars in the
graph represent keyframes.
Changing Audio Settings
When you export your final project, you may want to change the audio settings. To
access the audio options, choose Audio from the Export Movie Settings dialog box.
The settings in the Audio section of the Export Movie Settings dialog box, shown in
Figure 19-5, are as follows:
Tip

488
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
✦Compressor. In the compressor pop-up menu, choose a compressor if desired.
(The audio CODECs are reviewed at the end of this section.)
✦Sample Rate. Lower the rate setting to reduce file size and to speed up the
rendering of the final production. Higher rates produce better quality and
increase processing time. (CD-ROM quality is 44 kHz.)
✦Sample Type. Stereo 16-bit is the highest setting; 8-bit mono is the lowest 
setting. Lower bit depths produce smaller files and reduce rendering times.
✦Channels. Choose either Stereo (2 channels) or Mono (1 channel).
✦Interleave. This option determines how frequently audio is inserted into the
video frames. Choosing 1 frame in the pop-up menu tells Premiere Pro to load
the audio for the frame until the next frame is processed. However, this can
cause the sound to break up if the computer cannot handle a lot of audio data
quickly.
Figure 19-5: The Audio section of the Export Movie Settings dialog box.
Choosing QuickTime audio CODECs
Following is a brief review of several QuickTime audio CODECs. You must specify a
CODEC only if you want to add compression to sound. For each CODEC, the com-
pression ratio appears next to its name:
✦ULaw 2:1. Used as a common audio format on Unix platforms. ULaw is used
for digital telephony in both North America and Japan.
✦16-bit Endian and 16-bit Little Endian. Not used for video editing. Used by
hardware engineers and software developers.

489
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
✦24-bit integer and 32-bit integer soft. Not used for video editing. Used by
hardware engineers and software developers.
✦IMA Designed by the Interactive Multimedia Association. This cross-
platform format can be used to compress audio for multimedia.
✦32-bit floating point and 64-bit floating point. Not used for video editing.
Used by hardware engineers and software developers.
✦ALaw. Used for European digital telephony.
✦Qdesign Music CODEC. Can be used for high-quality Web output. Can provide
CD-ROM quality over a modem.
✦Qualcomm Pure Voice. A speech format. Shouldn’t be used at an audio rate
higher than 8 kHz.
✦MACE 3:1 and MACE 6:1. Macintosh audio CODEC that can be used for
QuickTime movies for PCs and Macs. MACE 3:1 provides better quality
because it uses less compression.
Choosing Video for Windows audio CODECs
Premiere Pro offers the following audio compression options when exporting a pro-
ject as a Video for Windows file:
✦Indeo audio software. Good for Web output of music and speech. Created for
use with Indeo video CODECs.
✦Truespeech. Used for speech over the Internet. Works best at low data rates.
✦Microsoft GSM 6.10. Used for speech only. Used for telephony compression in
Europe.
✦MS-ADPCM. Microsoft’s version of an Adaptive Differential Pulse Code
Modulation compressor. Can be used for CD-ROM quality sound.
✦Microsoft IMA ADPCM. Used for cross-platform multimedia. Developed by
the Interactive Multimedia Association.
✦Voxware CODECs. Can be used for speech output on the Web. Best at low
data rates.
Exporting MPEG Files
If you want to export your movie in MPEG format, you must use the Adobe Media
Encoder rather than Premiere Pro’s Export Movie command. The MPEG export
module enables you to export MPEG files specifically set for playback on different
formats that can be played on a DVD player. To create an MPEG file, you need do 
little more than click a few buttons and name your file.

490
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
The Adobe Media Encoder is also used to create Windows Media Files and
QuickTime Streaming and RealMedia files. Using these options is covered in
Chapter 21.
If you don’t want to export your Premiere Pro project to DVD but want to create an
MPEG file, you can also choose to create a generic MPEG1 or MPEG2 file. You might
want to use a generic MPEG file for Web use, or for importing into a multimedia
application.
Using the Adobe Media Encoder
Adobe’s Media Encoder provides an efficient means of creating quality MPEG files
for a variety of DVD formats that can be viewed on DVD players. The different DVD
formats described in this section are options available in software that burns DVDs.
The different formats allow for different screen sizes and different data rates. Some
enable subtitles, links, and menus to be integrated into the DVD production.
Using the Adobe Encoder is quite simple: To create an MPEG file from the Timeline,
first click the Timeline that you want to export and then choose File ➪Export ➪
Adobe Media Encoder. This opens the Transcode Settings dialog box, shown in
Figure 19-6.
The Transcode Settings dialog box enables you to choose these options from the
Format drop-down menu:
✦MPEG1. This option creates a generic MPEG1 file at 720 × 480 pixels with a
frame rate of 29.97 frames per second. The default bit rate is 1.7MB per second.
If you want to edit these defaults, select the Video check box in the Summary
column of the Transcode Settings dialog box.
✦MPEG1-VCD. This format uses MPEG1 encoding and provides a frame size of
352 × 240 (NTSC). VCD disks can be played in standard CD-ROM drives, yet
can play as much as 74 minutes of audio and video.
✦MPEG2. This option creates a generic MPEG2 file. The default bit rate for the
generic MPEG2 file is 4.2MB per second — over twice the rate of an MPEG1 file.
By clicking the Video section (click the word Video, not the checkbox) in the
Transcode Settings dialog box, you can change a variety of settings for the
generic file.
✦MPEG2-DVD. This option is the Hollywood standard, which can provide over
two hours of entertainment. This format utilizes a full frame of 720 × 480 pix-
els. When the file is exported, audio and video are separated into two MPEG2
files. The video file extension is m2v; the audio file extension is a .wav (NTSC)
or .mpa (for PAL systems) file.
Note

491
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
✦MPEG2-SVCD. Uses MPEG2 encoding. Provides a frame size of 480 × 480. This
format can provide titles, manuals, and links. It’s a fairly new format supported
by major electronics companies such as Sony, Philips, Matsushita, and JVC.
For each choice you can view settings by clicking in the Summary column. These
settings can be changed to tweak the export. Although most users will not change
the defaults, as mentioned earlier, clicking the Video check box in the Summary col-
umn allows you to change output bit rate and aspect ratio. The video section also
allows you to change from NTSC to PAL format. Figure 19-7 shows the video options
for the MPEG2-DVD setting.
Figure 19-6: The Transcode Settings dialog box.
Completing the MPEG export
After you’ve chosen a format in the Transcode Settings dialog box, you can simply
click OK to start the process of creating an MPEG stream of your work. If you’ve made
changes to any of the video or audio defaults, you may want to save your settings

492
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
by clicking the disk icon in the dialog box. (To load settings, click the folder icon.)
After clicking OK, name your file in the Save File dialog box. At this point, you can
click in the Export Range drop-down menu to choose whether to save the Entire
Sequence or the current work area. You can also check settings by clicking the
Settings button. This reopens the Transcode Settings dialog box where you can edit
your MPEG specifications. When you’re ready to export the file, click Save.
Figure 19-7: MPEG2-DVD export settings.
Burning a DVD
If you want to export your Premiere Pro project to DVD, you can burn the DVD
directly from Adobe Premiere Pro. If you burn a DVD directly from Premiere Pro,
you won’t be able to create menus or add any navigational graphics. However, you
can create chapters that correspond to Timeline markers on the Timeline.

493
Chapter 19 ✦Exporting AVI, QuickTime, and MPEG Movies
Adobe Encore provides tools for creating DVDs with menus and navigational but-
tons. Encore is covered in Chapters 24 and 25.
Here are the steps for burning a DVD from Premiere Pro:
1. To begin the export process, choose Export ➪Export to DVD. This opens the
Export to DVD dialog box, shown in Figure 19-8. Four options are available:
General, Encoding, DVD Burner, and Summary.
2. To name your disc, select General in the left pane and then choose Custom
from the Disc Name drop-down menu. This opens the Disc Name dialog box
where you can enter a name for the DVD. Note also that this dialog box allows
you to set Chapters at marker points. If desired, you can also choose to make
the DVD loop, or play again and again — a feature that might be handy if you
are creating a presentation that you want to be viewed again and again at a
public setting.
3. Click Encoding in the left pane to choose whether to export as NTSC or Pal
and to designate what portion of the Timeline you want to export.
4. Finally, to burn your DVD, select DVD Burner from the left pane. In this sec-
tion, shown in Figure 19-9, you can select the DVD burner and how many copies
to create. This section also shows whether your DVD is online. To start burning
the DVD, click the Record button.

f you’re a video producer or Web designer, at some point,
you’ll undoubtedly want to show one of your Premiere Pro
video productions on your Web page, on a client’s Web page,
or on a company intranet. Before you start creating digital
movies for the Web or intranet pages, however, having an idea
of exactly how a browser loads a digital movie onto a Web
page and what options are available to you is helpful. For
example, when a QuickTime movie is displayed on a Web
page, you can have it play immediately, or you can add con-
trols to have the user start and stop the movie. This chapter
provides an overview of the movie file formats for the Web
and discusses how to add a digital movie to the Web and the
QuickTime HTML options available.
Web Delivery Options
You don’t need to be a Webmaster or Java programmer to play
a Premiere movie on a Web or intranet page. To get started, all
you need to know is a little HTML. As you’ll find out from read-
ing this chapter, movies can be displayed by using a simple
HTML embed tag, as illustrated in the following example:
<EMBED SRC=”mypremiere.mov”, WIDTH=320,
HEIGHT=240>
In this case, the name of the movie is my mypremiere.mov. Its
frame size is 320 × 240 pixels. The embed command tells the
browser to load the movie from a Web server and use a plug-in
to play the movie. Although this technique works, it can lead
to poor playback. Unless the movie is saved so that it can
stream or use progressive playback, the viewer needs to wait
until the entire movie is downloaded to his or her hard drive
before he or she can view it. It’s almost like having to wait for

a VCR to play the program once before you can view it. If you want to display digital
movies on a Web or intranet page, you should investigate two delivery choices
designed to enhance playback quality: streaming and progressive download.
Streaming video
If you can afford it, streaming is the best vehicle for delivering digital video over 
the Web or an intranet. In many ways, streaming is similar to cable TV. You see the
program as it arrives at your home or office. No portion of the file is downloaded
before or during playback. Instead, it is buffered to memory first and then displayed
onscreen. Typically, the video is streamed at different data rates: a data rate for
modems (narrow band connections) as well as data rates for faster connections
(broadband).
Streaming video does not use the Web standard HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
Protocol). HTTP determines exactly the formatting, transmittal method, and
responses Web servers and browsers use when responding to commands issued
over the Internet. Instead of HTTP, streaming media uses Real Time Streaming
Protocol (RTSP), which not only allows streaming media, but also provides users
with the power to interact with the streaming server. For example, RTSP allows
viewers to rewind video and jump to different chapters in QuickTime movies.
Often the viewers click an onscreen button to request a data stream based upon
whether they have a slow or fast connection. This “on-demand” Web broadcasting
comes at a price. To handle the streams of video and audio, a high-speed connec-
tion, such as a DSL, cable modem, or T1, is required.
Furthermore, special server software is needed to stream the video. Often, the
server software and video content are on a separate computer that just handles
video streaming.
The three primary producers of streaming media software are Apple, Microsoft, and
Real Networks. Apple’s QuickTime streaming software (www.quicktime.com) is part
of its OS X server package. Apple also provides QuickTime streaming software for
Linux and Windows NT. Microsoft provides Windows Media server software (www.
microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.asp) with its Windows 2000
server package. Real Networks server software must be purchased from RealMedia
(www.realnetworks.com).
Progressive download
For short video clips, progressive download often can provide a suitable alternative
to streaming media. Although progressive download doesn’t provide video and
audio quality as high as that in streaming media, it allows the beginning of the
video clip to be played before it is downloaded. For most producers, this is the key
to preventing viewers from surfing away while the video downloads. However,
unlike streaming media, the video is actually downloaded to the viewer’s hard drive,
which allows the viewer to keep a copy of the production. A further drawback is that
Note

497
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
playback can become distorted if the data rate of the Web connection slows. In con-
trast, streaming media removes portions of the video to keep the playback consistent
(often the viewer doesn’t notice).

ing media industry, click the careers link on the aforementioned Web page.
Web File Formats
Before you begin planning to output your digital movies to the Web or an intranet,
you should be familiar with the different movie file formats that can be viewed in a
browser connected to the Web or an intranet. The file formats listed here all require
that some form of plug-in be installed in the browser software. Saving QuickTime
Windows Media and RealVideo files for the Web is covered in Chapter 21.
✦QuickTime. Apple’s QuickTime format is one of the most popular Web video
file formats. It is cross-platform and provides good quality. QuickTime pro-
vides numerous HTML options that can change how the movie appears on the
Web. Different QuickTime tracks (discussed later in this chapter) can also be
added to Web-based movies.
Although not a requirement for Web playback, for the best results, QuickTime
movies should be streamed by Apple’s QuickTime streaming software. This soft-
ware is included with Apple’s Mac OS X server package. As mentioned earlier,
Apple Computer has created QuickTime Streaming Server versions for Windows
NT and Linux. Premiere Pro users can quickly create QuickTime streaming-
ready movies by exporting their movies using Adobe’s Media Encoder (File ➪
Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder).
✦Windows Media format. Video created in Windows Media format is loaded on
a Web page into Microsoft’s Window’s Media Player. In Premiere, you can out-
put projects in Windows Media format by choosing File ➪Export ➪Adobe
Media Encoder. The current version, Windows Media 9, provides compression
improvements from 15 to 50 percent over Windows Media 8. Microsoft’s Web
page claims that it provides the “highest fidelity audio and best quality video
at any bit rate from dial-up to broadband.”
✦RealVideo. RealNetworks’ streaming video format is probably the most popu-
lar format available. For true high-quality video, the RealVideo encoded
movies must be created with RealNetworks streaming software CODEC.
Premiere’s Export Timeline ➪Advanced RealMedia Export enables you to
export Premiere movies in RealVideo format.
✦Audio Video Interleave (AVI). All Windows computers are equipped to read
Microsoft AVI files; however, because AVI is not cross-platform, it is not often
used on the Web. For Web use, Microsoft has dropped the format and
replaced it with the more sophisticated Windows Media Format.

Understanding HTML
If you plan to output digital video to the Web, you should have an understanding of
how digital movies are loaded onto a Web page. With this knowledge, you’ll be able
to control how your movie is displayed and when it begins to play. Your first step is
to understand how Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) can be used to load text
and images on a Web page.
How a movie is loaded onto a Web page
When you see a QuickTime movie on a Web page, it appears because the HTML code
instructs the browser to load the movie from a Web server. HTML is a series of text
codes or tags that tell the browser what to do. Although numerous programs exist
that can write HTML code for you, you could construct an entire Web page using a
simple text editor. For example, this HTML code snippet <b>Web Movies</b> tells
the Web browser to put the words Web Movies on a page in bold type.
As an example, we created a simple Web page with a QuickTime movie on it (see
Figure 20-1). To create the page, we used Adobe GoLive, which automatically cre-
ated the following HTML instructions. (Loading a QuickTime movie into GoLive is
covered later in this chapter.)
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv=”content-type” content=”text/html;charset=iso-
8859-1”>
<meta name=”generator” content=”Adobe GoLive 6”>
<title>Web Movie Center</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor=”#ffffff”>
<div align=”center”>
<h1>WEB MOVIES</h1>
<h1><embed src=”mymovie.mov” width=”310” height=”348”
type=”video/QuickTime” controller=”false” autoplay=”true”></h1>
</div>
</body>
</html>
To those unfamiliar with HTML, the code may look complicated. However, after you
become familiar with the syntax, you will find HTML coding quite easy. If you scan
through the code, you’ll see several HTML tags, such as <head> and <body>. Each
tag designates a specific area or formatting section in the page. Most tags begin
with a word, such as <title>. At the end of the section, the tag is repeated with a /
(forward slash) in front of it. For example, the end tag of <title> is </title>.

499
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
Figure 20-1: A sample Web page that contains a QuickTime movie.
Here’s a review of the some of the more important elements in the HTML code,
shown previously:
✦<html> — This tag simply tells the browser that the HTML coding system will
be used.
✦<head> — The “head” area of the page provides the browser with information
concerning the character set used (within the meta tag). If scripting languages
such as JavaScript will be used, this information normally appears in the
“head” area as well.
✦<title> — The window title of the browser page appears within the title tag.
✦<body> — The main elements of a Web page are found within the body area.
Notice that the body tag ends just above the ending </html> tag. Within the
body is the information that loads the QuickTime movie.
✦<embed> — The embed tag loads the digital movie plug-in. The src section
provides the name of the digital movie that will be loaded from the Web
server. The height and width sections show the width and height of the
movie on the page.
The type section tells the browser that a QuickTime movie is being loaded. 
controller=”false” tells the browser not to place the QuickTime controller.
autoplay=”true” tells the browser to start playing the movie as soon as the 
page loads.

500
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
To enable the movie to be seen on the Web, the page must be named. If we name
the page Index.htm, most Web servers will load this as the home page for a Web
site. For the page and movie to appear, both must be copied to the Web server that
hosts the Web site.
QuickTime settings for Web pages
Because QuickTime is one of the most popular digital video Web formats, we’ve
provided a list of HTML tags that enable you to customize how a QuickTime movie
appears on a Web page. Many of the tags are simple true/false statements, such as
Loop=True or Loop=False. These tags, described next, are easily inserted using a
word processor that saves files in standard text format. However, using a Web-page
layout program to insert these tags, such as Adobe GoLive, is easiest.
✦Bg color — Background color for the movie. Example: bg color=”#FF0000”.
(Colors are created in hexadecimal code when assigned in HTML. FF0000 dis-
plays red.)
✦Cache=True/False — Caches the movie. (Netscape browsers read the cache
setting; Internet Explorer does not.) This allows the movie to be loaded faster
if the user returns to the page.
✦Controller=True/False — Adds the QuickTime controller, which enables
the user to start and stop the movie.
✦Hidden=True/False — Hides the QuickTime movie but plays the audio.
✦HREF — Enables you to enter a clickable link. When the user clicks the
QuickTime movie, the browser jumps to the specified Universal Resource
Locator (URL), or Web address. (Example: HREF=http//:myhomepage.com/
Page-3.com)
✦Target= — This option is related to the HREF tag. When the movie jumps 
to a URL, it tells the movie which frame to play in. (Note that frame is an
HTML frame, not a digital video frame.) You can include a frame name or 
common frame tags, such as _self, _parent, _top, or _blank. (Example:
target = _ top)
✦Loop=True/False — Plays the movie nonstop. You can also choose
Loop=Palindrome, which plays the move from beginning to end, then from
end to beginning.
✦Play every frame=True/False — Forces every frame to be played. If this
option is activated, every frame of the movie is played. This option is usually
not turned on, primarily because it could slow movie playback and it could
throw the soundtrack out of sync or turn it off entirely.
✦Scale — Enables you to resize the movie. (Example: Scale=2 doubles the
movie size.)
✦Volume — Enables you to control the volume. Uses values from 0 to 256. By
default, the value is set to 256. To turn off the sound, use Volume=0.

Loading Streaming Video on a Web Page
Setting up video to be streamed over a Web page is slightly more involved than setting
up a digital movie to progressively download from a Web page. Although differences
exist between setting up files for Windows Media Server, RealNetworks’ Helix Server
and Apple’s QuickTime Streaming Server require the creation of a pointer or metafile.
Typically, the pointer or metafile is a small file saved on a Web server. When a user
clicks a link on a Web page, the metafile causes the streaming media plug-in to load,
and provides instructions as to which movie to load off the streaming media server.
The following sections provide brief, general summaries of the steps involved for
setting up streaming files for Windows Media Server, RealMedia Helix Server, and
QuickTime Media Server. For specific instructions, consult user documentation.
In all cases, you save your clip to a directory on your streaming media server. The
Web server will contain HTML code that points to the Web server.
Windows Media
Windows Media Server requires you to set up a metafile on your Web server. This 
is a file that the browser uses to load the Windows Media plug-in, which in turn
instructs the streaming media server to play the movie. General steps for setting up
the process are described next. For more information, see www.microsoft.com/
windows/windowsmedia/default.aspx.
1. Export your Premiere project as a Windows Media file using Adobe Media
Encoder (File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder). Assume that the name of
this movie is MyWindowsMovie.asm.
2. Upload the exported movie to the correct directory on your media server.
3. Create a metafile in a text editor. The metafile includes instructions as to
the location of the actual movie file. The text of the metafile could be as sim-
ple as this:
<ASX version=”3.0”
<Entry>
<Title>My Movie Title</Title>
<ref HREF=” mms://ServerName/Path/MyWindowsMovie.wmv
</Entry>
</ASX
4. Name the file MyWindowsMovie.asx. Note that the filename of the movie is
the same as the actual exported Windows media file, but uses an .asx file
extension. Save the file on your Web server.
5. On your Web page, write HTML that creates a link to the .asx file. The
HTML might look something like this:
<A HREF=”myWindowsmove.asx”>Click to play movie</A>

502
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
RealVideo streaming
The process of loading a streaming movie for a RealNetworks streaming media
server requires setting up a metafile or ram file on your Web server that includes
the path to the digital movie. When a user clicks on a link, the browser instructs the
RealMedia plug-in to load and sends the URL of the movie to the plug-in. Here’s an
overview of the steps involved. For more information about RealNetworks stream-
ing products, see www.realnetworks.com.
1. Export your Premiere project as a RealMedia file using the Adobe Media
Encoder (File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder). Assume that the name of
this movie is MyRealMovie.rm.
2. Upload the exported movie to the correct directory on your media server.
3. Create a metafile in a text editor. The metafile includes instructions as to the
location and name of the actual media file. The text of the metafile could be as
simple as this:
Rtsp: //servername/path/MyRealmovie.rm
4. Name the file MyRealMovie.ram. Note that the filename includes the name
of the exported RealMedia file, but uses an .ram file extension. Save the file
on your Web server.
5. On your Web page, write HTML that creates a link to the .ram file. The
HTML might look something like this:
<A HREF =”myRealMovie.ram”>My movie is here/A>
QuickTime streaming
When setting up a movie for QuickTime streaming, you must create a “reference
movie” on your Web server. The reference movie is a small file that contains refer-
ence information about the movie or movies to be loaded from the QuickTime
Streaming Media Server. Within the reference movie is the URL of the QuickTime
movie that must be loaded. If the media stream contains alternate files for different
connection speeds, the URLs of those movies are also included in the reference
movie. For detailed information, see Apple’s QuickTime Web site, which provides
detailed step-by-step information: www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qtss/.
1. Export a QuickTime streaming movie file using the Adobe Media Encoder
(File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder). By default, this movie will seek a
“hinted” track. The hinted track contains information about the server, packet
size, and the protocol needed for streaming. If you are not using the Adobe
Media Encoder, but QuickTime Pro, make sure you create the movie as a
hinted movie. Assume the name of your movie is MyQTmovie.mov.

503
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
2. Create a reference movie for the clip and its alternatives. A reference movie
is a movie on the Web server that points to the actual movie. The easiest way
to create a reference movie is to use Apple’s MakeRef movie, which you can
download from its QuickTime Web site. When creating the reference movie,
you name the URLs of the Web server. You must also do this for all alternate
movies that might be loaded at different connection speeds. The URL in the
movie might be something like this:
rtsp://qtmedia.mywebsite.com/MyQTmovie.mov
3. Save the movie using a filename such as refMyQTMovie.mov.
4. Create a link for your movie, such as the following:
<A HREF=”refMoviemypremieremovie.mov”>my movie</A>
You could also embed the movie with a command such as this:
<EMBED SRC=”ref.mov” WIDTH=”pixels” HEIGHT=”pixels”
AUTOPLAY=”true” CONTROLLER=”true” LOOP=”false”
PLUGINSPAGE=”http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/”>
Placing a QuickTime Movie in a 
Web Page with Adobe GoLive
Adobe GoLive is one of the best Web-page layout programs for QuickTime movie
producers. GoLive even features a QuickTime tab, which enables you to edit the
tracks of a QuickTime movie and add special effects. GoLive’s palettes allow you to
quickly and easily place a QuickTime movie on a page.
A trial version of Adobe GoLive is included on the DVD that accompanies this book.
Following are the steps for adding a QuickTime movie to a Web page and for editing
its attributes with Adobe GoLive:
1. Create a new window in GoLive for the Web page by choosing File ➪New.
2. If the Objects palette is not opened, open it by choosing Window ➪Objects.
Click the QuickTime icon in the basic palette, shown in Figure 20-2, and drag it
to the page. GoLive provides a placeholder for the QuickTime movie. The
position of the placeholder determines where the movie appears on the page.

already designed, you can drag the Point-and-Shoot icon directly to the file in
your Adobe GoLive site window on your computer’s desktop.)

505
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
After the movie is placed in a Web page, the width and height attributes are
set automatically.
6. Click the More tab in the Inspector palette, shown in Figure 20-4.
Figure 20-4: The Inspector palette’s QuickTime
movie More tab.
7. If you want to enter a name for your movie (for HTML coding use only),
type a name in the Name field. The Page section enables you to designate a
page from which to download the QuickTime plug-in. If you want to add
padding between the movie and surrounding text, enter a value in pixels in
HSpace, for horizontal space, and/or VSpace, for vertical space. To hide the
movie and only play back audio, select the Is Hidden check box.
8. To specify more HTML controls specific to QuickTime, click the QuickTime
tab, shown in Figure 20-5. Clicking check boxes and entering data into fields
automatically creates the HTML codes for the options described. For example,
clicking the Link check box and then typing myhomepage.com/page 2 tells
the browser to switch to page 2 on the Web site if the user clicks the movie.
9. If you want to preview the movie while in GoLive, click the Open Movie
button at the bottom of the QuickTime tab. When the movie appears, the
Basic tab provides track, size, and data rate formation about the movie, as
shown in Figure 20-6.

Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
Using QuickTime Tracks for the Web
QuickTime provides several hidden movie tracks that can add to the versatility of
the Web and intranet movies. For example, QuickTime enables you to create an
HREF track that can make the browser jump to another Web page at a specific point
in the movie. QuickTime also provides a chapter track, which enables a user to click
a chapter name and jump to that section of the movie. Perhaps the most unusual
QuickTime track is the sprite track. The sprite track enables you to add graphics
and provide interactivity to the QuickTime movie. For example, by using a sprite
track, you can add a button that is assigned an action to your QuickTime movie.
When the user clicks the button, the action occurs, such as restarting the movie,
going to another Web page, or turning up the volume.
The following sections show you how to add tracks to a QuickTime movie. The first
section shows how to add an HREF track with Adobe Premiere Pro. The sections
that follow show you how to create chapter and sprite tracks with Adobe GoLive.
Creating a Web link in Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere enables you to add an HREF track in a QuickTime movie. Using the
HREF track, you can make the users’ browsers jump to another Web location while
the QuickTime movie plays. In Premiere Pro, this QuickTime feature is called a 
Web link.
You set up a Web link within Premiere Pro using Markers. Your first step is to add a
Marker to either a clip or a Timeline.
Before you can add a Web link to a Premiere QuickTime movie, you must add a Marker
to the Timeline. A Marker adds a visual clue on the Timeline for specific important
points in a movie. Following are the steps for adding a Marker to the Timeline.
(Before following these steps, you should have at least one clip in the Timeline.)
1. Activate the Timeline window by clicking it.
2. If a clip is selected in the Timeline, deselect it.
3. Click and drag the current-time indicator in the Timeline window to move
to the frame where you want to set the Web link.
4. Choose Marker ➪Set Sequence Marker ➪Unnumbered. The marker appears
on the Timeline.
You can also create a Marker by clicking and dragging a Marker icon in the
Timeline window to a specific frame in the current sequence.
Note

508
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
5. Now that you’ve created a Marker, double-click it in the Timeline window
to open the Marker dialog box, shown in Figure 20-7, to specify the URL you
want to jump to.
6. In the Marker dialog box, enter a URL, such as http://myhomepage.com/
page_2.htm. You can enter a frame in the Frame Target field if you are using
HTML framesets. Frames are handy tools if you want to create an effect in
which the QuickTime movie begins in one section of the Web page and then
jumps to and plays in another section. To create this effect, you need to enter
the name of the URL and the filename for the frame in the Frame Target area.
Web links can only be created from Timeline Markers. You cannot create a Web
link from a clip marker.
Figure 20-7: Premiere Pro’s Marker dialog box allows the 
movie to open a Web page at a specific point in the movie.
Using Adobe GoLive to edit and 
create QuickTime tracks
Adobe GoLive provides extensive support for QuickTime tracks for use on the Web.
Using GoLive, you can add HREF links as well as chapter tracks and sprite tracks.
The following sections show you how to create and edit QuickTime video tracks in
Adobe GoLive. Before you begin, here are the basic steps for loading a QuickTime
movie and viewing its tracks so that you can edit them. (For a complete explanation
of GoLive’s QuickTime editing options, see the online help manual or the GoLive
users’ guide.)
GoLive also enables you to create QuickTime movies and to add effect tracks to
them.

1. To open a QuickTime movie in GoLive to edit tracks, choose File ➪Open. In
the Open dialog box, use the mouse to navigate to the QuickTime movie you
want to open and then click OK. The movie opens in GoLive’s Preview tab.
To edit or add tracks to use on the Web, you must view the QuickTime movie in
a Timeline. (Figure 20-8 shows a Timeline with HREF, chapter, and sprite tracks.)
To view the Timeline for the QuickTime movie, choose Movie ➪Show Timeline
Editor.

Adding an HREF track
You can use QuickTime’s HREF track to create Web links. Unlike Premiere Pro,
GoLive enables you to create both clickable and nonclickable Web links.
You can use this feature in a page with HTML frames. When the movie plays, you
can send it to the URL of the frame and specify that it play in the top part of a frame
or in a new window.

the background track).
4. Position the HREF track in the area where you want to have the Web link
occur. To shorten or lengthen the track, click and drag the edge of the track.
5. Open the Inspector palette, shown in Figure 20-10, by choosing Window ➪
Inspector. The time readout in the Inspector palette shows the start and stop
times for the Web link action.

Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
7. Select the sample area of the track that you want to assign to the URL. In
the Inspector palette, enter the linking HREF. You can use the GoLive Point-
and-Shoot icon to link to a Web site. If you are using frame sets, enter the
frame that you want to use in the target box. You can click the Target pop-up
menu to open a list of standard frame set locations, such as _top, _parent,
_self, and _blank. For example, _top loads the movie into a full browser
window and replaces any framesets, and _blank opens the movie into a blank
browser window.
8. If you want to have the URL load automatically so that the user does not
have to click the QuickTime movie, select Autoload URL.
Creating a chapter track
QuickTime chapter tracks enable Web page visitors to jump to different areas of a
QuickTime movie. When a chapter track is created, QuickTime adds a pop-up menu
with the different chapters in it. All the Web page visitor needs to do is click the
pop-up menu to move to that segment of the movie.
Here’s how to add a chapter track to your QuickTime movie:
1. To create a new chapter track, click and drag the Chapter icon from the
QuickTime section of the Objects palette (choose Window ➪Objects to open
the Objects palette) to the Tracks section of the Timeline.
2. Activate the New Sample tool (Pencil icon) and click the triangle next to
chapter track to open the samples track.
3. Create a new samples track by clicking and dragging with the New Sample
tool in the blank samples area of the movie Timeline (which is beneath the
background track).
4. Open the sample area of the chapter track and then click and drag in the
Timeline area in the sample track to create the new sample.
5. To create multiple chapters, activate the Divide Sample tool and click along
the sample track to divide it into different segments.
6. Choose Window ➪Inspector to open the Inspector palette.
7. Activate the Arrow Selection tool and then select each chapter. After you
select the chapter, enter a name in the Chapter Title field in the Inspector
palette, as shown in Figure 20-11. Do this for each segment in the chapter 
samples track.
8. To edit the time for each track, use the Arrow tool to click and drag the
position of the sample or edit the track length by clicking the edge. As you
click and drag, the time readout in the Inspector palette changes.

Creating interactivity with sprite tracks
Interactive sprites are the most sophisticated effect that you can add to a QuickTime
movie in Adobe GoLive. (The term sprite is often used to represent a graphic or
object that can be used repeatedly.) After you add a sprite track to a QuickTime
movie, you can import graphics and use the graphics for added visual effect, or
even as interactive buttons.
There are countless ways to use sprites and interactive behaviors. Following is a
short example to give you an idea of the possibilities. This example shows you how
to import a graphic into a QuickTime movie and have the image change when the
user moves the mouse over it. We also show you how to assign an action to the
graphic. Because creating and using sprites can be a time-consuming process,
we’ve broken the project into three short sections.
Adding sprite tracks
The following simple steps show you how to create a Sprite track that can be used
to add graphics and interactivity to a QuickTime move:
1. To create a new sprite track, click and drag the Sprite icon from the
QuickTime section of the Object palette (choose Window ➪Objects to 
open the Objects palette) to the Tracks section of the Timeline.

513
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
2. If you want to rename the track, double-click it and enter a new name.
Importing graphics
You can import graphics to use as sprites in the sprite track of a QuickTime movie.
For example, you can create tiny buttons or characters that appear and disappear
while the QuickTime movie plays. After the graphics are imported, you can load them
into the sprite track and create interactivity. In this example, you’ll import two graph-
ics into the sprite track. However, after the graphics are added to the sprite track,
they do not appear until you place them into a sprite subtrack. (Creating sprite sub-
tracks is discussed later in this section.)
You can load the following graphic formats into sprite tracks: JPEG, GIF, PICT, BMP,
and PSD (Photoshop native format).
1. Select the sprite track in the Tracks section of the Timeline.
2. If the Inspector palette is not opened, open it by choosing Window ➪
Inspector palette.
3. Click the Images tab in the Inspector palette, as shown in Figure 20-12.
Figure 20-12: The Images tab in the Inspector
palette.
Note

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
4. Before importing graphics, deselect multiple layers (otherwise, you might
import layers with nothing in them). To import graphics, click the Import but-
ton in the Images tab. When the Open dialog box appears, select the graphics
you want to add and then click Add for each graphic. Click Done when finished.
5. Importing graphics opens the Compression Settings dialog box, shown in
Figure 20-13. If desired, change the Quality settings and the Compressor.
Figure 20-13: You can change compression 
settings in the Compression Settings dialog box.
Creating sprite subtracks
Importing sprites adds them to the Tracks sprite pool. Now they can be used as
many times as desired in sprite subtracks. In a sprite subtrack, you can control
sprite positioning and switch from one sprite to another.
1. Select the sprite track in the Tracks section of the Timeline.
2. Click the Sprites tab in the Inspector palette.
You can change the background color of the sprite track by clicking the background
color check box in the Sprites tab and then clicking the color swatch. (By default,
the sprite track is black.) You can also set a blending mode for the track by clicking
the Basic tab in the Inspector palette.
3. Click in the Add New Sprites field, as shown in Figure 20-14. Enter the num-
ber of sprite subtracks that you want to add and then press the Tab key. If you
want to create a simple rollover effect or a simple action, type 1. Doing this
adds a sprite subtrack to the Timeline and creates a keyframe for the sprite.
(A diamond in the subtrack area of the Timeline represents the keyframe.)
Note

515
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
Figure 20-14: Type the number of subtracks that
you want to add in the Add New Sprites field.
Changing location and creating simple behaviors
If you want the sprites to switch sprite images or sprite positions in the subtrack as
the movie plays, you must create more keyframes and then use the Inspector to
switch images or locations. Here’s how:
1. In the Timeline, select the keyframe for the subtrack.
2. If you want to change the positions of the sprite, enter the new coordinates
in the position section of the Basic tab in the Inspector palette.
You can also make a sprite invisible at a keyframe by deselecting the Visible check
box in the Basic tab of the Inspector palette.
3. If you want to switch graphic images, select the image from the Image pop-
up menu in the Basic tab of the Inspector palette.
4. To create a new keyframe, press Option/Alt, click and drag the keyframe in
the Timeline track to the right, and then release the mouse button.
After creating a keyframe, you can change images or image positions.
Note

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
5. If you want to create interactivity or a rollover effect, click in the Over
swatch (for a rollover) or in the Click Inside or Click Outside boxes in the
Basic tab of the Inspector palette. Then choose the image that you want to
switch to when the mouse rolls over or clicks inside or outside of the image. 
A Click Inside effect is shown in Figure 20-15.
Figure 20-15: Switching images with a mouse
click in the Basic tab.
Assigning actions to a sprite
GoLive enables you to assign an action when the user clicks or moves the mouse
over a sprite. For example, when the user clicks a sprite, you can have the movie
increase volume, return to its beginning, or jump to another Web page. While
assigning actions, remember that actions only occur at keyframes. Therefore, you
may need to create many keyframes to give the user enough time to click the sprite.
Here’s how to assign actions to a sprite:
1. Select the keyframe where you want the action to occur.
2. Click the Action tab in the Inspector palette.
3. Choose an event in the event list, such as Mouse Down, Mouse Click, or
Mouse Enter.

517
Chapter 20 ✦Outputting to the Web and Intranets 
4. Click the New Action icon (dog-eared page icon).
5. In the pop-up menu at the bottom of the screen, choose an action, such as
Movie Set Volume, Movie GoTo Time, or Movie GoTo Beginning, as shown
in Figure 20-16.
6. Click the Apply button.
Figure 20-16: Assigning an action to a sprite.

Previewing and saving your work
When you are finished creating sprites and assigning actions to them, you can pre-
view your work by clicking the Play icon (triangle) at the bottom of the Timeline.
You can also slowly preview your sprite work by clicking and dragging the Edit line
Marker over the Timeline.
At this point, you can save your movie by choosing File ➪Save. Then choose Movie➪
Export Movie. In GoLive’s Save Exported File dialog box, click the Options button to
review or change the QuickTime video settings and then click OK to save the movie.
Summary
If you will be exporting a movie to the Web or to an intranet, knowing the HTML
options available to you can help you add features to your movies. A program such
as Adobe GoLive can simplify the task of loading a digital movie onto a Web page
and the task of writing the HTML code. QuickTime movies enable you to add many
features that can be utilized on the Web, including the following:
✦You can add a clickable HREF track to a QuickTime movie.
✦You can add a chapter pull-down menu that appears on a Web page. When a
user clicks the chapter name, the movie jumps to that section.
✦You can add sprite graphics to a QuickTime movie and add interactivity.

Exporting Video
to the Web
N
ow that more and more Internet users log on to the Web
using speedy broadband connections, video producers
will undoubtedly be exporting their Web files with streaming
media in mind.
Streaming media enables users to watch a video program as it
downloads. Before the advent of streaming media, Web users
had to wait for an entire clip to download before the video
actually started to play. When media is streamed, information
packets are sent by special streaming server software such as
RealNetworks RealVideo Server, Microsoft’s Windows Media
Server, or Apple’s QuickTime Streaming Media Server.
Fortunately, Premiere Pro users can easily export video 
for streaming media projects or for slower modem connec-
tions. Adobe Media Encoder provides a simple and straight-
forward means for outputting video files in streaming and
non-streaming formats. This exporting module, installed
within Premiere Pro, takes the guesswork out of choosing the
appropriate output settings for Web viewing. You can export
your Premiere Pro projects in RealVideo, Windows Media, 
or QuickTime formats. Furthermore, presets built into the
Encoder enable you to easily export one clip optimized for
multiple bandwidths. In other words, you can export a high-
quality file to the Web or an intranet and have the Encoder
create versions for users with either high- or low-bandwidth
connections. Thus, when you output to an intranet or the Web,
the Adobe Media Encoder presets can save you time and help
ensure quality playback for users who view your videos.
Encoding Terms
This chapter provides an overview of different Web encoding
formats, particularly those used for streaming media. As 
you choose different formats, you’ll see a variety of arcane

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
encoding terms such as two-pass encoding, variable bit rate, and constant bit rate;
some encoding terms will frequently surface in different dialog boxes. These terms
appear regardless of whether you are exporting to Windows Media, RealMedia, or
QuickTime format. Before continuing, you might want to review some non-technical
definitions:
✦Two-pass encoding. Two-pass encoding increases the digital quality of
exported video. When two-pass encoding is used, the video that is processed
is actually processed twice. The first time, the encoder analyzes the video to
determine the best manner to encode it. On the second pass, it uses the infor-
mation gathered in the first pass to encode it. As you might guess, two-pass
encoding takes longer than single pass, but increases the quality of the encoded
video.
✦Variable bit rate. Variable bit rate varies the bit rate of a clip as it plays back.
When a high-action scene needs more bits or bandwidth, the encoding process
delivers the extra bits; in areas that don’t require high-bandwidth, it lowers
the bit rate. Thus, for clips that vary in action, VBR can provide better quality
than constant bit rate, (CBR), which does not vary the bit rate of the clip as it
plays back.
✦Keyframe. When some CODECs compress video, they can compare each frame
with subsequent frames and can save only the information that changes. When
the information changes, the CODEC saves a full frame of video only when it
needs to. This frame is often called a keyframe. So CODECs that use keyframes
can reduce the file size of exported video. Typically, a keyframe setting is divis-
ible by the frame rate. Therefore, at 30 frames per second, you might see a
keyframe of 30, meaning one keyframe is created every second (30 frames). 
A keyframe of 60 would create one keyframe every two seconds.
✦Metadata. Metadata for Web video clips is text data about the clip that can be
searched for on the World Wide Web. Often metadata information includes
information such as title, date, and creator. Windows Media, RealMedia, and
QuickTime all allow the inclusion of metadata categories within their files.
Depending on the file format and the Web formatting, metadata about movie
clips can sometimes be viewed by right-clicking in the movie and then choos-
ing Properties.
Windows Media Format
Premiere Pro’s Adobe Media Encoder allows you to export movies in Windows Media
format, Microsoft’s newest audio and video format. Windows Media movies can play
back in Internet Explorer and can be streamed from Microsoft’s Streaming Media
server. Windows media files are recognizable by their .wmv file extension. WMV
files can be read by Windows Media Player version 7 and higher.

521
Chapter 21 ✦Exporting Video to the Web
Exporting to Windows Media format
To export in Windows Media format, start by selecting the sequence in the Project
window that you want to export in the Project window. If you want to create a
Windows Media file from only the current work area, click and drag the Work area
bar borders so that they encompass the sequence area that you want to export. If
you want to export a clip, select the clip in the Project window (later you can choose
to export the entire clip or from the clip’s in to out points). When you’re ready to
start the export process, choose Export ➪Movie ➪Adobe Media Encoder. In the
Transcode Settings dialog box, choose Windows Media in the Format menu. In the
Preset drop-down menu, choose the best preset for your intended audience. The
presets are descriptions of the type of Web connection that you expect your audi-
ence to be using. Figure 21-1 shows many of the preset choices.
For example, if your target audience is using a 56 Kbps modem, you can choose the
preset WM9 NTSC 32K download. You can see a summary of the video and audio
settings in Figure 21-2. Notice that this choice uses variable bit rate encoding, with
two passes. The frame width is 320 by 240, and the frame rate is 30 frames per sec-
ond. If you need to choose slower dial-up choice, pick one of the Windows Media 8
dial-up modem choices.
Figure 21-1: The Windows Media formats.

522
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
Figure 21-2: Windows Media preset for 56 Kbps modem.
If you want to export your video for broadband connections, you might choose
either the WM9 256K or the WM9 512K download. When you pick the WM9 512K
option, the Summary shows that this choice should be targeted for Broadband,
Cable Modem, and DSL. To view how the data will be encoded, click the Video sec-
tion in the Summary area.
The Video section shows that this preset uses two encoding passes and variable bit
rate mode. Now, you can see other encoding information by clicking on the word
Broadband in the Summary area. This changes the window to show the frame width,
height, frames per second, and keyframe intervals, as well as the video bit rate and
audio format, as shown in Figure 21-3. Although there is generally no need to change
these settings, you may edit any of them. For instance, you might want a smaller
frame size in your Web page.
Changing target audiences
If you want to target your export file for more audiences, click Add/Remove audi-
ences under the Audience heading. This opens the Select Target window, as shown
in Figure 21-4, where you can add other connection speeds. To add a target audience,
simply click in a check box next to the target connection; to remove a connection,
click in a box that was already selected.

Adding metadata
If you want to add searchable metadata to the export file, click the Add/Remove
Fields under the Metadata Summary section. If you don’t see the words Add/Remove
Fields, click the triangle next to Metadata to open this section. In the Select Metadata
window, shown in Figure 21-5, click the fields that you want to include with your
video. After you click OK, a dialog box opens allowing you to enter information into
the fields.
Creating the export file
After you’ve selected a profile and entered the metadata text desired, you’re ready to
create the Windows Media export file. To start the process, click OK in the Transcode
Settings dialog box. If you’ve changed any of the default presets, the Choose Name
dialog box appears allowing you to name your custom preset. Next, the Save dialog
box opens. Here you can choose to export the entire sequence or the work area only.
If you selected a clip rather than a sequence, the Export Range dialog box allows you
to export the clip or from the clip’s in to out point. Next, click the Save button to
export the file, or you can quickly change settings by clicking the Settings button.
Figure 21-5: Click next to the field names to choose 
metadata fields.
Using QuickTime Streaming
The Adobe Media Encoder provides exporting options for creating QuickTime
streaming media files. As discussed in Chapter 20, QuickTime is Apple’s cross-
platform digital media format. QuickTime streaming files can be used on Apple’s
Streaming Media Server as well as the RealNetworks RealMedia Streaming Server.
Not only are QuickTime files cross platform, but also Apple’s Streaming Media
Server is available for Windows NT and UNIX platforms.

525
Chapter 21 ✦Exporting Video to the Web
You can also prepare a QuickTime movie for streaming by exporting a Premiere
Pro movie by choosing File ➪Export ➪Movie and choosing QuickTime as a setting.
You can then use Apple’s QuickTime Pro to export the file for Apple’s QuickTime
Media server.
Choosing a QuickTime media format
If you want to export your movie in a streaming QuickTime format, start by select-
ing the sequence in the Project menu. If you want to export only the work area,
change the work area boundaries so that they encompass only the sequence area
you want to export. If you want to export a clip, select it in the Project window. After
you’ve selected the sequencer clip, choose File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder.
To start the process of creating a QuickTime streaming file, choose QuickTime in
the format drop-down menu in the Transcode Settings dialog box. Next choose one
of the QuickTime streaming presets in the Preset drop-down menu. The preset
choices are shown in Figure 21-6.
Figure 21-6: QuickTime Streaming media choices.
Note

526
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
The QuickTime format provides a variety of different choices. If you want to export
your file for a variety of different connection settings, including broadband, choose
QT alternate NTSC download. Figure 21-7 shows the list of different connection
alternatives. When you select the Alternates heading, the Transcode dialog box
allows you to create a prefix for the different alternate connection files and set a
target path for saving all the files.
Figure 21-7: QuickTime streaming alternate settings.
If you click on any of the alternates in the Summary area, the Transcode dialog 
box reveals the encoding settings. For example, Figure 21-8 shows the settings for 
1 Mbps Cable modem. Note that the Width and Height is 320 by 240 at 29.97 frames
per second, with a data rate of 750 Kbps. Contrast these settings with the 28.8
modem option, shown in Figure 21-9, which exports at a frame size of 160 by 120
and a frame rate of 6.0. All settings use a Sorenson Video compression CODEC,
which is frequently used for exporting QuickTime Web files. If desired, you can also
use the Add/Remove button to add or remove more alternate files to the list.

527
Chapter 21 ✦Exporting Video to the Web
Figure 21-8: Settings for a 1 Mbps Cable modem.
If you are working with QuickTime, it’s a good idea to take a look at the General set-
tings for exporting. To access them, click General in the Summary area. In the
General summary area, set your QuickTime movie to Autoplay, to play as soon as it
appears on the Web page; and/or you can have it loop or keep repeating. Leave the
Hinted Movie option selected. The QuickTime server uses the hinted track to
stream media.
Using metadata
Like the Windows Media and RealMedia formats, the QuickTime export allows 
you to create metadata fields. To choose the fields, click Add/Remove Fields in the
Transcode Settings dialog box and then select the fields you want to add. After you
choose the fields, click the word Metadata in the Summary area. The right side of 
the dialog box changes to fields in which you can enter the metadata text (see
Figure 21-10).

Chapter 21 ✦Exporting Video to the Web
Figure 21-10: QuickTime Metadata field entry.
Exporting to RealMedia Format
The Adobe Media Encoder’s RealMedia export formats enable you to create digital
movies in RealMedia format, one of the most popular streaming video formats used
on the Web. RealMedia became popular because it was one of the first true stream-
ing video formats. As the data streams, the RealPlayer (or newer RealOne Player)
software and the RealMedia server communicate to ensure that the data is sent at
the best data rate. The RealMedia options in the Transcode Settings dialog box
enable you to create one video clip for multiple audiences. Like the Windows Media
and QuickTime formats, you can export an entire sequence, the current work area,
or a clip for viewers using different connection speeds. When the clip is down-
loaded, RealMedia switches to either the faster stream for faster connection users
or the slower stream for slower dial-up modem users.

530
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
After you’ve finished your production work, you can start the export process by
selecting the sequence that you want to export and choosing File ➪Export ➪Adobe
Media Encoder. If you want to export a clip instead, select the clip in the Project win-
dow. If you want to export only the work area, change the work area boundaries so
that they encompass only the area that you want to export. When the Adobe Media
Encoder opens, choose RealMedia from the Format drop-down list.
Start by picking a preset. As mentioned earlier, a preset is a description of the type
of Web connection that you expect your audience to be using. When you choose a
RealMedia preset, the General section of the Transcode Settings dialog box shows
whether two-pass encoding is used and may also have the following options:
✦Allow Recording. Select this option to enable users to save the clip on their
computers by clicking a Record button that appears in the browser. If you don’t
select this option, the Record button is grayed.
✦Allow Download. Select this option to enable users who don’t have the
RealPlayer plug-in to save the clip directly to their hard drives.
If you’re outputting to the Web using a streaming media server, pick a streaming
media choice such as RM9 Streaming broadband. If the video is not going to be
streamed, pick a download choice. To see or change the frame size, click Video 
in the Summary area. The video settings for Streaming broadband are shown in
Figure 21-11. The Video content drop-down list will often include the following
choices:
✦Normal Motion. Use this option for clips that include some motion and stills.
✦Smoothest Motion. Select this option for clips that feature limited motion.
✦Sharpest Motion. Use this option for sporting events and other action clips.
✦Slide Show. This makes your video appear as a series of still frames.
Like the Windows Media and QuickTime formats, RealMedia also allows you to add
or subtract target audiences by clicking Add/Remove Audience in the Summary sec-
tion. If desired, you can edit the target audience settings by clicking any of the target
audiences listed in the Summary area. RealMedia also allows you to add metadata,
in much the same way that you add metadata to Windows Media and QuickTime
streaming files: Click Add/Remove Fields in the Summary area and then click
Metadata to enter the data.
Creating the RealMedia export file
After you’ve selected a profile and entered any metadata for the file to be exported,
you’re ready to create the RealMedia export file. To start the process, click OK in the
Transcode settings dialog box. If you’ve changed any of the default presets, a dialog
box appears allowing you to name your custom preset. Next, the Save dialog box
opens. Here you can choose to export the entire sequence or the work area only. 

531
Chapter 21 ✦Exporting Video to the Web
If you selected a clip rather than a sequence, the Export Range dialog box only

Exporting to
Videotape
D
espite the excitement generated by outputting video to
the World Wide Web, videotape still remains one of the
most popular mediums for distributing and showing high-
quality video productions. Provided you have the right hard-
ware, Adobe Premiere Pro enables you to export clips and
complete projects to videotape.
Professionals who demand high-quality output can also have
Premiere Pro export their projects to an Advanced Authoring
Format (AAF) file. An AAF file is a multimedia file format that
allows Premiere Pro users to send data to other digital video
editing systems.
This chapter discusses the steps you need to take to output
your Premiere Pro files to videotape or to an AAF file.
Preparing to Export Video
In order to export your Premiere Pro Project to videotape,
your system must support device control, which enables you
to start and stop a videotape recorder or camcorder directly
from Premiere Pro. If you have a DV camcorder and your com-
puter has an IEEE 1394 port, chances are you’ll be able to use
device control. However, before you get started, you may want
to add black video or bars and tones to the beginning of your
project.
Adding black video, 
color bars, and tone
If you are sending your Premiere Pro Project to a video pro-
duction facility, you may want to add black video to the begin-
ning of your project. The extra black video will provide the

production facility more time to get its equipment rolling before your project begins.
Here’s how to create black video:
1. Click the New Item button at the bottom of the Project window.
2. In the pop-up menu, shown in Figure 22-1, choose Black Video. This adds
five seconds of black video to the Project window.
3. To add the black to the Monitor window, double-click the Black Video in the
Project window. You can then click the Insert button in the Monitor window
to insert it into your project. (You can also simply drag it into the Timeline
window to place it into a sequence.)
In order to calibrate color and audio, production facilities set their electronic equip-
ment to color bars and a 1 kHz tone. If you are working with a video production
facility, you can easily add bars and tone to your Premiere Pro Project. Here’s how:
1. Click the New Item button at the bottom of the Project window.
2. In the pop-up menu, shown in Figure 22-1, choose Bars and Tone. This adds
five seconds of color bars and a tone to the Project window.
3. To increase the duration of the bars and tone, select Bars and Tone in the
Project window (or right-click the bars and tone in the Project window) 
and then choose Speed/Duration in the drop-down menu. In the Clip
Speed/Duration dialog box, add the desired time in frames.
4. To add the bars and tone to the Monitor window, double-click the bars and
tone in the Project window. You can then click the Insert button in the Monitor
window to insert into your project. (You can also simply drag it into the
Timeline window to place it into a sequence.)

Chapter 22 ✦Exporting to Videotape
Checking project settings
Before exporting to videotape, review your production’s project settings by choos-
ing Project ➪Project Settings ➪General. Review the Video, Audio, and Keyframe
and Rendering sections. As you view the settings in these dialog boxes, make sure
that they are set to the highest-quality output, because Premiere Pro uses these set-
tings when exporting to videotape.
The video settings in Premiere Pro are explained in several chapters in this book,
so we do not repeat them here. You may, however, want to review the Fields setting
in the General options, of the Project Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-2.
Figure 22-2: The General options in the Project Settings dialog box.
Fields are only relevant when exporting to videotape. The NTSC, PAL, and Secam
standards divide each frame into two fields. In NTSC video, where the frame rate is
approximately 29.97 frames per second, approximately 30 video frame appear each
second. Each frame is divided into two fields that appear for a 60th of a second. PAL
and Secam display a video frame every 25 frames, and each field is displayed each
50th of a second.
When the field is displayed, it displays alternating scan lines. Thus, the first frame
may scan lines 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. After the first field is scanned, the frame then
scans lines 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. So, in some respects you might conceptualize a video
frame to be like a child’s puzzle with the video fields being two zigzagging, inter-
locking pieces. If you view only one of the pieces, you don’t get a sharp picture. In
fact, if you could freeze a field onscreen, you would see an image with blurry lines.
When setting export settings, you can choose Upper Field First or Lower Field First,
depending on which field your system expects to receive first. If this setting is incor-
rect, jerky and jumpy video may be the result.
Note

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
If you don’t know in what order your equipment expects fields, run a quick export
of a project that includes motion. Export the project set to Upper Field First and
then export it set to Lower Field First. The correct field setting should provide the
best playback. Use this setting when you export your video project.
Checking device control settings
Before you begin exporting your project to videotape, check to be sure that your
device control options are properly installed. These settings appear in the Premiere
Program’s Preferences dialog box. To open the Preferences dialog box and access
the Device Control section directly, choose Edit ➪Preferences ➪Device Control.
Click the Device pop-up menu and choose the Device Control option for your equip-
ment. (If you have digital video [DV] equipment, you may be able to choose DV
Device Control 2.0.) Next, click the Options button. Doing so opens the DV Device
Control Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-3.
Figure 22-3: Choose your camcorder in the
Device Type drop-down menu.
In the DV Device Control Options dialog box, choose the correct video standard
(NTSC or PAL). Choose a Device Brand and a Device Type. Next, pick the timecode
format you want to use in the Timecode Format menu. If your camcorder is off, turn
it on and click the Check Status button. If all connections are properly set, the
Offline readout should change to Online. If you are connected to the Internet, to
check the compatibility of your camcorder with Premiere Pro, click Go Online for
Device info. This command will bring you to a Web page that lists camcorders and
their compatibility with Premiere Pro.
Setting digital video playback options
After you’ve checked your video and device control settings, your next step is to
establish playback options. The choices are different, depending upon the hardware
you are using.
Note

Exporting with Device Control
The following section describes how to export to videotape with device control for
DV hardware.
Before starting the export session, make sure that you have set the DV control
options in the DV Playback Settings dialog box and that you have reviewed your
video settings.
Exporting using DV device control
To export to videotape using DV device control, follow these steps:
1. Turn on your videotape deck and load the tape on which you are recording
into your tape deck. To record using DV device control, you must insert a tape
pre-striped with timecode into your tape deck; then write down the timecode
location at which you want to begin recording.
2. Select the Sequence that you want to export by clicking it in the Project
window.
3. Choose File ➪Export ➪Export to Tape.
4. In the Export to Tape dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-5, select Activate
Recording Device. This tells Premiere Pro to take control of the recording
device.
5. If you don’t want the recoding to begin at the current location, choose
Assemble at timecode; then enter the timecode where you want recording
to begin.
6. In the Delay Movie Start field, enter a delay in quarter-frames. (Some
devices need this delay to sync the recording device with the movie after
starting the recording process.)

539
Chapter 22 ✦Exporting to Videotape
7. In the Preroll field, enter the number of frames you want to back up before
the specified timecode. This enables the tape to attain the proper speed
before recording. Five seconds (150 frames) is usually sufficient.
8. Click Record.
Figure 22-5: The Export to Tape dialog
box instructs Premiere Pro to take control
of the recording device.
Exporting without Device Control
If your hardware setup does not allow device control, you can still record to video-
tape by manually controlling your video recording device. Here are the steps:
1. Make sure your camcorder or recording device is connected properly.
2. Turn on your videotape deck and load the tape onto which you are record-
ing into your tape deck.
3. Select the sequence that you want to export by clicking it in the Project
window. You should be able to see the sequence on your video display.
4. Cue the tape recorder to the position where you want to begin recording.
5. Move the current-time indicator to the start of your Premiere Pro movie.
6. Press the Record button on your recording device.
7. Press the Play button in the Monitor window.
8. After you are done recording, click the Stop button in the Monitor window
and then press the Stop button on your recording device.

Exporting to AAF Format
In your day-to-day work as a digital video editor or producer, you may find the need
to re-create your Premiere Pro Project on another video system, perhaps a high-end
system. Re-creating your project from scratch on another system could prove to be
costly and time consuming. Fortunately, you can export your Premiere Pro Project
as in Advanced Authoring Format (AAF). This standard industry format, which was
created in the late 1990s, has been embraced by a variety of high-end video systems.
Theoretically, you should be able to export your Premiere Pro Project in AAF format
and later import the file into another system. After the import, you should be able
to work with all of your files and footage. But, realistically, how accurately the high-
end system reads the AAF file may vary from system to system.
Exporting to AAF is quite easy. Simply select the Project window and choose
Project ➪Export Project as AAF. In the Save dialog box that appears, enter a name
for the AAF file.
For details about which Adobe Premiere Pro effects are supported when exporting
to AAF format, open the AAF plug-in.doc file found in the Adobe Premiere Pro folder.
Summary
Premiere Pro allows you to output your movies directly to videotape. You can output
with or without device control. 
✦Premiere Pro uses File ➪Export ➪Export to Tape to export to videotape.
✦Premiere Pro uses the settings in the Project Settings dialog box when out-
putting to videotape.
✦If you want to create an AAF file, choose Project ➪Export Project as AAF.

Macromedia
Director, and

Flash
A
lthough the number of digital movies appearing on the
World Wide Web seems to grow each day, the most
widely used medium for distributing digital movies is CD-ROM.
Virtually every computer sold today includes a CD-ROM drive,
and many sold today are at least 12 times faster than those sold
just five years ago. A standard CD-ROM holds 650MB of data,
usually enough space for at least 30 minutes of compressed
digital video. CD-ROMs also are among the cheapest and most
durable digital media available.
Many multimedia producers who distribute their work on
CD-ROM find that to truly take advantage of the medium, they
need to add interactivity to their Adobe Premiere Pro presenta-
tions. A popular interactive multimedia program is Macromedia
Director. If you import a Premiere Pro movie into Director, you
can create buttons that start, stop, and rewind your Premiere
Pro movie. You can also put several Premiere Pro movies into
different Director frames and create buttons that enable the
viewer to move from one movie to another.
This chapter guides you through the steps for exporting your
Premiere Pro movie to CD-ROM. The chapter begins with the
steps for choosing compression settings for Premiere Pro
movies that will be exported to CD-ROM. It includes an over-

behaviors to control digital movies. Because many multimedia producers will soon
be moving their interactive productions to the Web, we’ve included a section on
Macromedia Flash— undoubtedly the most popular application for creating interac-
tive productions on the Web.
Exporting Premiere Pro Movies to CD-ROM
Outputting Premiere Pro movies to CD-ROM often presents the multimedia producer
with a dilemma: The higher quality settings that are necessary when exporting a
Premiere Pro movie can result in poor quality playback. This problem is especially
true if you export your Premiere Pro project for viewing on older computer systems
that have slow CD-ROM drives. When you export, you may need to make small com-
promises in quality to ensure that your Premiere Pro movie plays back well on older
systems.
Before you begin the process of exporting a movie for CD-ROM output, understand-
ing what is involved in the process is a good idea. Here is an overview of the process:
1. Create a project with either a DV or non-DV setting.
2. Complete all editing in Premiere Pro. Decide whether you want to export
the entire Timeline to one movie or export it to several movies that you might
want to integrate into a Macromedia Director project.
3. To export for QuickTime or AVI, first select the sequence you want to export
and then choose File ➪Export ➪Movie. Click the Settings button to choose
AVI or QuickTime. If you want to export using an MPEG format (MPEG1 is suit-
able for CD-ROM), choose File ➪Export ➪Adobe Media Encoder.
4. Specify Premiere Pro export settings, including the frame size, frame rate,
and compressor.
5. If you are importing your Premiere Pro movie into Director or another multi-
media program, such as Macromedia Authorware, import the Premiere Pro
movie into the program. Then complete the final production in Director or
Authorware.
6. Record the final production to a CD-ROM using a CD-ROM recorder. Most
Mac CD-ROM recording software enables you to partition the CD-ROM to create
a Mac version and a Windows version.
Output settings for CD-ROM
Before Premiere Pro turned “pro,” earlier versions of the program provided the fol-
lowing multimedia project presets for both QuickTime and AVI movies.
Many non-DV analog boards allow video to be captured at different frame sizes
and frame rates.
Note

543
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
✦Compressor. Cinepak
✦Frame Size. 320 × 240
✦Frame Rate. 15.00
✦Color Depth. Millions
The audio presets are as follows:
✦Rate. 22050
✦Format. 16-bit mono
These presets were primarily designed for square pixel footage captured on analog
to digital boards. If you’re creating Premiere Pro projects that will appear in CD-ROM
productions (particularly in older computers), consider the preceding presets as
minimum output settings. If you are working with DV footage, you can change
Compressor settings, frame size, and frame rate when you export your movie.
If you want to export your files for CD-ROM productions, the steps are virtually
identical to exporting your production as a digital movie, as described in Chapter 19.
Here’s a summary of the steps:
1. Complete your editing.
2. Select the Sequence that you want to export and choose File ➪Export ➪
Movie. If you want to change settings, click the Settings button in the 
Export Movie dialog box.
3. Change settings as desired in the General, Video, Audio, Keyframe and
Rendering, and Special Processing sections. If you’re exporting QuickTime
movies, you may want to choose Sorenson Video, rather than Cinepak, as your
compressor. Sorenson can provide higher-quality movies in smaller file sizes.
(However, Cinepak is still considered the best compressor for older computers.
Cinepak also allows color reduction to 256 colors, whereas Sorenson does not.)
Figure 23-1 shows the Sorenson Video settings in the Export Movie Settings
dialog box. One of the most import options in this dialog box is the Data Rate.
The value entered in this dialog box limits the flow of data so that the video
doesn’t pour out at a rate the CD-ROM can’t handle. Typical data rates for
double-speed CD-ROM are between 200K and 250K per second. If you know
that your project will be played on a 12-speed (12X) CD-ROM drive, Adobe rec-
ommends using 1.8MB per second for a 24X CD-ROM, 3–3.6MB.
To view a tech note on limiting data rates in Premiere Pro from Adobe’s support
knowledgebase, point your browser to www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/
a60a.htm.
If you reduce the number of frames per second in the Frame Rate menu, you can
usually increase the data rate.

6. Click Save. If you are using Cinepak compression and are exporting a long
movie, the compression process may take quite some time.

Using Macromedia Director
Macromedia Director is a powerful and widely used multimedia-authoring program.
Like Premiere Pro, Director enables you to import graphics files from such programs
as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe ImageReady. It also enables you to import source
images from Macromedia FireWorks and Macromedia Flash.
Although Director is often used for creating animated sequences, to Premiere Pro
users it offers the power of adding interactivity to digital movies. Unlike Premiere
Pro, Director features a powerful programming language called Lingo. By using Lingo,
you can create scripts or behaviors that enable the user to jump from frame to frame
or to start and stop Premiere Pro movies imported into Director. For instance, using
both Premiere Pro and Director, you can create educational productions that enable
users to choose what areas they want to learn and what video segments they want
to see.
Director overview
To understand how Premiere Pro movies can be integrated into a Director presenta-
tion, you should become familiar with the various elements of the Director interface.
Director makes use of three primary screen areas: the Stage, the Score, and the Cast

545
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
windows (see Figure 23-2). The stage is where all animation and activity take place.
In Figure 23-2, you can see a Premiere Pro movie created from the Chapter 1 tutorial
files on the Premiere Pro DVD (the scene is from clip 705008f.mov from Digital
Vision’s Night Moves CD). You might view this as equivalent to Premiere Pro’s
Monitor window. The score is somewhat similar to Premiere Pro’s Timeline. In the
Director score, each frame is represented by a tiny rectangle. Each track in Director
is called a channel. All program elements imported or created in Director are auto-
matically added to its cast. To start the process of creating a production, cast mem-
bers are dragged from the cast window to the stage. Cast members can include
graphics such as buttons, digital movies, text, audio, and behaviors.
Figure 23-2: The Director Stage, Score, and Cast windows.
Importing Premiere Pro movies into Director
For Premiere Pro users, one of Director’s most valuable features is that it enables
you to import and control QuickTime and AVI movies. Before you can use a
Premiere Pro movie in Director, you must first import it into the program.
To import a QuickTime or AVI movie into Director, follow these steps:
1. If you have multiple casts in Director, start by selecting the cast you want to
import the digital movie into and then choose File ➪Import.

546
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
2. In the Import Files dialog box, select the digital movie that you want to
import.
3. If you are importing only one file, click the Import button. Otherwise, select
another digital movie and then click Add.
4. When you are done adding movies, click Import. After the movie is
imported, it is loaded as a cast member in the Cast window.
Changing movie properties
Although you most likely will control digital movies in Director using Lingo, you can
easily change settings that affect playback in the Cast Member Properties windows.
To open the Property Inspector window shown in Figure 23-3, select the digital movie
in the Cast tab and then click the Info button. The digital movie’s properties win-
dow (in the Property Inspector) enables you to choose to play back both video and
sound, or one or the other. Perhaps the most important choice in the dialog box is
the Paused check box. This enables you to prevent the movie from playing as soon
as the viewer enters the frame that contains the video. If you select the Paused but-
ton, you can use Lingo to have the user start and stop the movie. If you select Loop,
the digital video movie plays continuously.
Figure 23-3: The Property Inspector window.
QuickTime movies enable the QuickTime controller to appear onscreen as a device
for starting and stopping QuickTime movies. Many multimedia producers choose
not to show the controller, preferring to create their own interface and controlling it
with Lingo.

547
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
Usually, the Sync to Soundtrack option is selected. The other choice in the pop-up
menu — Play Every Frame — can result in video playing without audio. If the Director
to Stage option is selected, you can place other cast members over QuickTime
movies.
Placing the movie onstage
For a digital movie to be viewed in Director, it must be positioned in Director’s Stage
window. Before dragging the movie from the Cast window to the Stage window,
most Director users select the frame that the QuickTime or AVI movie will reside in.
Typically, a background and buttons are created in Director or Adobe Photoshop.
After the frame in the Score window is selected, clicking and dragging the movie
from the Cast window to the Score window puts the movie on that frame.
At this point, the Director producer must decide whether he or she wants the
movie to play in one Director frame or whether the movie should play over 
multiple Director frames. Projects are often easier to manage if the movie plays 
in one Director frame. When movies play in one frame, Director must stop its 
own playback head and turn the processing over to the QuickTime or AVI movie.
Pausing the playback head with the Tempo channel
If you set up Director to play a movie in one frame, you must tell Director to halt
and wait for the end of the QuickTime movie or wait for a button to tell it to move
off the frame. The easiest way to tell Director to wait for the end of a movie is to
specify this in Director’s Tempo channel.
To access the Tempo channel controls for the movie, simply double-click the Tempo
channel frame directly above the movie frame. In the Tempo channel dialog box,
shown in Figure 23-4, select Wait for Cue Point and then click {End} in the Cue Point
pop-up menu.
Figure 23-4: Director’s Tempo channel dialog box 
enables you to pause the playback head while a 
digital video movie plays.
Pausing the playback with a behavior
Although the Tempo channel provides a quick way of stopping Director’s playback
head, most experienced Director users don’t use it because it does not provide as
much power as does Lingo. To pause the playback head while a digital movie plays,

548
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
you can use a Lingo behavior instead of the Tempo channel. Fortunately, for non-
programmers, Director comes packaged with prewritten behaviors. You can use a
prewritten behavior to pause the playback head by dragging the Hold on Current
Frame behavior from Director’s Behavior Library (in the Navigation section) into
the Score channel frame that appears directly above the digital movie frame. (The
Score channel appears above channel 1.)
Using Lingo
Although playing QuickTime and AVI windows from within Director is quite easy,
learning a few Lingo commands to control navigation and start and stop QuickTime
movies is helpful. Director provides a simple interface to get you started creating
Lingo scripts. The following section shows you how to create a simple navigational
script using Director’s Behavior Inspector. After you learn how to use the Behavior
Inspector, you can create scripts that control QuickTime and AVI moves.
Creating behaviors
Director behaviors are Lingo scripts that can be used to control navigation and to
control QuickTime movies. After you create a behavior, you can click and drag it
over an onscreen object such as a button. If the behavior includes commands for
mouse events, you can program the behavior to execute when the user clicks 
the mouse on the object that contains the behavior.
The following are steps for creating a simple navigational behavior:
1. Choose Window ➪Inspectors ➪Behavior.
2. To create a new behavior, click the + button and then choose New
Behavior.
3. In the New Behavior dialog box, enter a name for your behavior and then
click OK.
4. To utilize the Behavior Inspector window’s automatic scripting features,
click the arrow in the middle of the dialog box to expand it. The dialog box
is shown in Figure 23-5.
5. In the Events section in the Behavior Inspector dialog box, click the + sign
and choose an event to trigger your behavior. For most button-triggered pro-
grams, choose Mouse Up or Mouse Enter. Choose Mouse Up instead of Mouse
Down to enable the user to release the mouse. If a Mouse Down triggers the
event, the user cannot cancel after clicking the mouse. If you use a Mouse Up
event, the user can cancel the event by moving the mouse off the button before
releasing the mouse.
6. In the Actions section, select an Action category. For example, if you are 
creating a navigational button, choose Navigation.
7. In the menu that appears, pick a specific action such as Go To Frame. If 
you choose Go To Frame, enter the frame number you want to go to.

549
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
8. Click OK.
9. If you want to see the Lingo script that was created, click the Script 
window icon.
10. Close the Behavior Inspector window by clicking the Close icon.
11. To use your behavior, drag it from the Cast window and release it over an
object such as a button graphic in the Stage window.
Figure 23-5: Create behaviors in the Behavior 
Inspector dialog box.
Creating your own Lingo
When you know the basics of creating behaviors, you can begin using Lingo to con-
trol QuickTime and AVI movies. Most of the Lingo that controls QuickTime and AVI
movies refers to the movie by the channel the movie is in or its cast member name
or number. When you drag a movie from the Cast window to the stage, the movie
becomes known as a sprite. Lingo addresses different sprites according to the chan-
nel the sprite is in. Thus, if you dragged a digital video movie into channel 1, you
refer to it as Sprite 1.
To create your own behaviors that control QuickTime movies, you can use the
Behavior Inspector dialog box to get you started and then enter the Lingo com-
mands that control digital video movies by opening the Script Window dialog box
and entering them there. The following sections review some commonly used Lingo
commands that control digital video movies.
Playing movies with Lingo
If you want to create Lingo buttons that start, stop, and reverse QuickTime movies,
you can set and change the sprite’s Movie Rate property and the Movie Rate func-
tion. The following are common movie rate values:

550
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
Play
1
Stop
0
Reverse
–1
You can slow down the movie by setting the movie rate to .5.
Here’s a simple script that starts a QuickTime movie in channel 3 when the user
clicks the mouse on an object containing the following behavior:
On mouseUp
Set the movieRate of Sdprite 3 to 1
End MouseUp
Or, in Director 7 and later versions, you can use “dot syntax”:
On mouseUp
sprite(3).movieRate=1
End mouseUp
Checking movie duration
Director’s MovieTime and Duration commands are more helpful Lingo utilities. Use
MovieTime to check how much of a QuickTime movie has played. Duration measures
the length of a QuickTime movie. Both Duration and MovieTime are measured in
ticks (one tick equals one-sixtieth of a second), not frames. By constantly comparing
the MovieTime property of a QuickTime movie to its duration, you can tell when the
movie actually stops playing. When the movie stops playing, you can then send
Director’s playback head to another frame. The following Lingo is an example. A movie
script that is executed when the production starts puts the duration of a QuickTime
movie into a variable called gmovduration. In this example, the QuickTime movie is
in Director’s third channel (like a video track). In Lingo, this is designated as Sprite 3.
Global gmovduration
Put the Duration of Sprite 3 into gmovduration
Another script, executed when the playback head exits a frame, compares the cur-
rent MovieTime of the QuickTime movie to its duration. If the MovieTime is less than
the duration, then the movie hasn’t ended yet. Thus, the Lingo script keeps Director
playback on the current Director frame. The Lingo command “go to the frame” keeps
the playback head in the current frame. When the QuickTime movie finishes, its
MovieTime is no longer less than its duration. At this point, the “go to the frame” sec-
tion of the code is not executed, so Director’s playback moves on to the next frame
in the Director production.
Global gmovduration
On Exit Frame
Put the MovieTime of Sprite 3 into myMovieTime
If myMovieTime < gmovduration then go to the frame
End
Note

551
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
You can also change the MovieTime of a digital movie with a script like this:
Set the Movietime of Sprite 3 to 360
The dot syntax version would be as follows:
sprite(3).Movietime=360
The preceding Lingo code results in the playback of the QuickTime movie jumping
to the new time position you have assigned.
Changing digital movie settings
The movie settings in the Cast Properties window that controls looping and
whether the movie pauses when the playback head enters the frame are easily 
controlled with Lingo commands.
For example, at the beginning of a movie or at a certain point in a movie, you can
turn off looping with the following line of Lingo code:
Set the loop of member “Mymovie” =True
Or you can stop the movie from playing when the playback head enters the frame
with this Lingo:
Set the PauseAtStart of Member “Mymovie”=TRUE
Playing a portion of a digital movie
Director also enables you to start and stop a digital video movie from any point in the
movie using its StartTime and StopTime commands. Using these Lingo commands,
you can create a button labeled Show intro or Show interview. When the user clicks
the button, only the specified segment is played. StartTime and StopTime are
measured in ticks. For example, this Lingo snippet tells Director to start the digital
movie one minute into the digital movie:
Set the startTime of sprite 1=360
or
sprite(1).startTime=360
To set the stop point of the movie you could use this Lingo snippet:
Set the StopTime of sprite 10=720
or
Sprite(10).stoptime=720

552
Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
Other Lingo commands
Director includes numerous Lingo commands that work with QuickTime movies.
For example, Lingo includes commands that can turn QuickTime soundtracks on
and off. Lingo can determine whether QuickTime or Video for Windows is installed
on a computer, and it can tell the video producer when keyframes occur. Lingo com-
mands are well documented in Director’s Lingo dictionary. However, if you are a
Director beginner, be forewarned: You won’t become a Lingo expert overnight.
Using Macromedia Flash 
with Premiere Pro Movies
Macromedia Flash is undoubtedly responsible for livening up more Web pages with
animation and music than any other computer application. It doesn’t take many
mouse clicks in a Web browser to land in a Flash-centric site. In fact, throughout the
world, Flash movies appear on thousands of Web sites. Flash is used for virtually
everything that moves on animated logos, full-featured cartoons, and interactive
games. Many sites even use Flash to create interactive forms that post data to
databases and display the results as animation. Fortunately, Premiere Pro users can
take advantage of all that Flash has to offer. The current version of Flash can import
QuickTime, AVI, MPEG, and Windows Media files.
The Flash production process
Like Director, Flash is an animation program that features a powerful authoring lan-
guage designed to provide interactivity that goes well beyond the simple links pro-
vided by HTML. Unlike Director and Premiere Pro, graphics created in Flash are not
based on pixels; they are based on vectors. Vector images are based on mathemati-
cal coordinates, not pixels. Vector images are the foundation of programs like Adobe
Illustrator and Macromedia Freehand. In Illustrator and Freehand, you can click and
drag the mouse to create an image and move it and bend it with ease. The image
transformations are quickly processed by mathematical computations. To display
the image on a computer screen, Flash renders the vector-based data to a screen
image. When a Flash movie is viewed in a Web browser, the vector graphics scale to
fit the user’s window.
In Director and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, a grid of pixels comprises every
frame. When you change the color of a pixel-based image, you change individual
pixels in the image. When you tilt or transform the image, the pixels need to be
mathematically rearranged in the pixel grid. This grid-like foundation means that
pixel-based image files are larger than vector-based image files and take longer to

To create its vector-based images, Flash features a rich set of drawing and color
tools. However, if the developer needs graphics created in other programs, such as

553
Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
Photoshop or Illustrator, he or she can easily import them. Images are animated in
a timeline interface, somewhat similar to Premiere Pro’s. Instead of video tracks,
however, Flash supports a multitude of superimposition effects using layers.
When the developer is finished creating graphics and animation and has added
interactive buttons or forms, he or she “publishes” a Flash movie. Publishing cre-
ates an SWF file that can be saved to a Web server. During the publishing process,
Flash can write an HTML file containing the scripting code that loads flash onto a
Web page. The movie appears in a Web browser courtesy of a Flash plug-in that
must be installed in the user’s browser. Fortunately for Flash developers, the Flash
plug-in is one of the most popular in the world. According to Macromedia, it is
installed in more than 400,000,000 browsers.
Integrating Premiere Pro movies into Flash
Although an in-depth discussion of working with Flash is beyond the scope of this
book, this section shows how you can easily import a Premiere Pro movie into Flash
and create a simple script attached to a frame that sends the movie’s playback head
to another frame.
To load a Premiere Pro movie into Flash, choose File ➪Import. After you select 
the movie from your hard drive, Flash enables you to choose whether to embed the
movie into Flash or simply link to it (see Figure 23-6). If you want to use Flash to cre-
ate another QuickTime movie, you can choose the link option; otherwise, you want
to embed the movie into the Flash file for use on the Web.
After you choose to embed the movie in Flash, the Import Video Settings dialog box
appears (see Figure 23-7). This dialog box enables you to specify quality settings
and to synchronize the imported movie’s frame rate to the Flash frame rate.
After the video is imported, it appears in the Flash Timeline. You can access each of
the movie’s frames by clicking a frame in the Timeline. As the movie plays, you can
use Flash’s graphic creation and text tools to embellish your production. For exam-
ple, you can add a new layer by clicking an icon in the Timeline. To keep yourself
organized, name your layers. Figure 23-8 shows a QuickTime movie in a layer
beneath a Text layer. (You can add text to Flash without creating a new layer.) To tilt
the text, we simply clicked and dragged a text handle. Changing text styles is simply
a matter of selecting the text and choosing an option from Flash’s text menu. You
can create simple animation just by creating a keyframe (Insert ➪Keyframe) and
moving objects that appear on stage.
Figure 23-6: Flash enables you to embed
a Premiere Pro movie into a Flash project.

Chapter 23 ✦Outputting to CD-ROM, Macromedia Director, and Macromedia Flash
Creating an ActionScript
Flash’s ActionScript language is the key to producing sophisticated Web interactiv-
ity. If you know JavaScript, you won’t have too much trouble wading into the enticing
waters of ActionScript. Like Director’s Lingo scripting language, Flash’s ActionScript
can create interactive buttons and objects onscreen. ActionScript can also control
how a movie plays. For example, at a specific point in your movie, you can attach a
script that tells the movie to jump to a specific frame and stop. At the stopping point,
you can start up another movie or wait for the user to click a button to proceed.
Attaching an ActionScript to a frame is quite simple. Start by clicking the frame where
you want to trigger the ActionScript. Next, open the Action window by choosing
Windows ➪Actions. To create a script that controls a movie, click the Actions icon
and then click the Movie control icon. Flash displays a list of choices for your
ActionScript. Figure 23-9 shows the Go to and Play option chosen. You can use this
script command to go to a specific frame and stop to wait for more commands.
After you’ve completed your Flash work, you can choose File ➪Publish Preview to
preview your work in Flash, viewing your work locally in your default Web browser.

Part V ✦Outputting Digital Video from Premiere Pro
To learn more about Flash, visit the Macromedia Web site, www.macromedia.com.
Premiere Pro users who want to fully explore integrating interactivity with digital
video will certainly want to investigate all that Flash has to offer.
Summary
The most widely used medium for distributing digital movies is CD-ROM. Many
Premiere Pro movies are imported into interactive multimedia programs such as
Macromedia Director before the project is saved to CD-ROM. When exporting a movie
that will play on CD-ROM, your export settings should be based on the system that
will be playing your movie. This chapter covered the following:
✦Lower quality settings must often be used to play back digital video movies
on slower systems.
✦The most common compressor used for exporting digital video for CD-ROM
has been Cinepak. Sorenson Video is now commonly used for exporting
movies that will be played on mid- to high-end machines.
✦If you want to add interactivity to a Premiere Pro movie, you can export your
movie into Macromedia Director or Macromedia Flash.
✦Macromedia Director’s programming language, Lingo, features many com-
mands that enable onscreen clickable buttons that can start and stop digital
video movies.
✦Macromedia Flash enables you to integrate Premiere Pro movies into Web
multimedia projects.

Using Adobe
Encore to 
Create DVDs
A
dobe Encore DVD is a high-end DVD authoring program 
that allows you to create interactive DVDs. Using Encore
DVD, you can import MPEG and AVI files that you’ve edited 
in Premiere Pro and turn them into professional DVDs. With
Encore DVD, you can create menus and navigational buttons
that add sophisticated interactivity to your Premiere Pro pro-
jects. Since many of Encore’s navigational links are automati-
cally created by dragging and dropping graphics onscreen, it
probably will not take Premiere Pro users long to get up and
running in Encore. Although the interface is different from
Premiere Pro’s, most users will probably find themselves right
at home in Encore’s Project and Timeline windows. This chap-
ter provides an overview of the basics of DVD authoring. So
follow along, and you’ll see how to integrate Premiere Pro
footage into a DVD project that includes interactive buttons.
The chapter leads you through the steps of creating and
burning a DVD. If you don’t have a DVD burner but have a
CD burner, you can still follow along. Encore can save
shorter DVD projects to CDs. But these must be played in a
DVD player.
A downloadable version of Adobe Encore is available at
www.adobe.com. If you want to create a DVD project
using this chapter as a guide, you can use a Premiere Pro
project for your video source footage. However, in order to
import it into Encore DVD, you must export the project in
either MPEG-2 or AVI format. Exporting in MPEG-2 and AVI
formats is covered in Chapter 19.

Touring Encore DVD
The following sections provide a brief overview of Encore DVD’s Project window
and palettes. Encore DVD’s palettes can be accessed even if a project is not onscreen.
However, in order to see Encore’s Project window, you first need to create a new
project. Here are the steps:
1. Choose File ➪New Project. The New Project Settings dialog box appears 
(see Figure 24-1).
2. Choose whether you want to use the NTSC (US Standard) or the PAL
(European) video standard and click OK.
Figure 24-1: Choose a video standard
in the New Project Settings dialog box.
The Project window and its tabs
After the new project is created, you’ll see a Project tab, which is one of four tabs
that are part of Encore DVD’s Project window (yes, the Project tab is in a window
referred to as the Project window). The four tabs: Project, Menu, Timelines, and
Disc allow you to perform all major tasks related to a project. To access any of the
tabs, click on the tab or choose a tab name from Encore DVD’s Window menu. Like
Premiere Pro’s Project window, Encore DVD’s Project tab allows you to view project
assets (video, audio, and graphics) that comprise your project. The Menu tab allows
you create and manage menus and where you’ll place navigational buttons. Encore
DVD’s Timeline tab provides a bird’s eye overview of your project and allows you to
set chapter markers. The Disc tab is used for burning DVDs. 
Once you have a project open onscreen, Encore DVD’s windows become useful
tools for DVD creation. Like Premiere Pro’s windows, Encore DVD’s can be dragged
apart and reunited in different combinations. The windows always rest above the
Project window tabs and can be opened by choosing a window’s name from the
Window menu.
The Properties palette
Encore’s Properties palette is a multipurpose info palette that provides details about
what is selected in different windows. Figure 24-2 shows the Properties palette dis-
playing information about an Encore menu page. The information in the window
changes to reflect different items that you click in the Project window. For example,

561
Chapter 24 ✦Using Adobe Encore to Create DVDs
if you click a video clip in the Project window’s Project tab, the Properties palette
displays information about the clip’s location, and duration.
Figure 24-2: The Properties palette provides
information about different Encore DVD
production elements.
The Layers palette
The Layers palette allows you to manipulate layers used in menus. You can show,
hide, and change the stacking order of objects on menu screens. The Layers palette
is shown in Figure 24-3.
Figure 24-3: The Layers palette displays
information about graphic elements on a
menu page.

562
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
The Character palette
Use the Character palette to specify type options for characters created for buttons
and menus. Use the character drop-down menus to change typefaces, type size, and
style. The Character palette is shown in Figure 24-4.
Figure 24-4: Use the Character palette to
change type settings.
The Library palette
The Library palette is stocked with templates for menus, buttons, and various back-
grounds. Use the window to quickly create interactive graphics screens. In the sec-
tion “Using menu templates,” later in this chapter, you use a menu screen from the
Library palette as the foundation for a menu screen that you can edit for your own
use. The icons at the bottom of the window allow you to change views so that you
can see Only Menus, Only Buttons, or Only Backgrounds. The New Menu button cre-
ates a copy of the selected menu screen so it can be customized.
The Timeline window and Menu Editor window
As you work through the tutorial in this chapter, you’ll take a look at the Timeline
window, and you’ll work in the Menu Editor window. Here’s a brief description of
these windows:
✦Timeline window. The Timeline window provides a bird’s-eye view of your DVD
media sources in sequential order. Unlike Premiere’s Timeline, Encore DVDs
display only one video and one audio clip. You can also use Encore DVD’s
Timeline window to create subtitle tracks and choose the language for subtitles.
✦Menu Editor. Use the Menu Editor window to create and edit DVD menus.
Here you can place or edit buttons in menus and add text and images to menu
screens.

563
Chapter 24 ✦Using Adobe Encore to Create DVDs
Importing source video and audio
Encore DVD allows you to import AVI files, WAV files, and most common graphics
formats. In Encore DVD, source material such as video clips, graphics, and sound
files are called assets. Photoshop users will be happy to learn that Encore DVDs are
fully compatible with Photoshop, and you can load Photoshop layers in as separate
buttons in a menu. To load an asset into Encore, choose File ➪Import as Asset. In
the Import as Asset dialog box, select the file you want to import and click Open.
If you export one of your Premiere projects as an AVI movie (choose File ➪Export ➪
Movie), you can import it directly into Encore DVD by choosing File ➪Import asset.
Encore also can import MPEG video files, but it will not import QuickTime files. 
Like Premiere, all imported source material appears in the Project window (in 
the Project tab), as shown in Figure 24-5. (The image seen in the Project tab in 
Figure 24-5 is from the Tutorial Project in Chapter 1, file 705027f from Digital Vision’s
NightMoves CD.)
Encore DVD can import MPEG-2 files, which are considered DVD-compliant (mean-
ing that they meet DVD recording standards). Encore DVD can also import some
non-DVD-compliant files, such as NTSC AVI files — which must have a frame size of
720 x 480, 720 x 486, or 404 x 480 with a frame rate of 24 frames per second or
29.97 frames per second. PAL files must have a frame size of 720 x 576 or 704 x 576
with a frame rate of 25 frames per second. Files that are not DVD-compliant are
transcoded by Encore to make them DVD-compliant. Working with DVD-compliant
files saves times, because Encore DVD does not need to transcode them when you
burn a DVD or import files. DVD-compliant file types include .wav files (48 kHz, 16 or
24 bit) and .aif files (though not .aif-c). Also note that when you import AVI files,
Encore DVD automatically imports audio. If you import MPEG files, you will need to
import the audio separately.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Using menu templates
To most computer users, the term menu refers to a drop-down list of choices that
appear at the top of a computer application. In the world of DVD development, a
menu is a screen with interactive buttons. Typically, the first screen you see when
viewing a DVD production is a menu screen. Clicking a button on the menu might
bring you to another menu or start the production playing. In this section, you’ll
choose a menu from a list of predesigned templates to use for your project.
You use Encore’s Library palette to load a background and preset buttons to get
you started creating your opening DVD screen.
1. Click the Library palette to access it. (If it isn’t onscreen, choose Window ➪
Library.) Figure 24-6 shows the menu window with a list of templates.
2. Note the three buttons at the bottom of the window. From left to right these
are the Show Menus, Show Buttons, and Show Images buttons. Click the
Show Menus button to display the menus.
3. Choose a menu from the list by clicking it. (Note that the submenus in the
list are simply alternate versions of other menus.)
4. Now create a new menu based upon the template by clicking the New Menu
button at the bottom of the window. The new menu appears onscreen in the
Menu Editor, as shown in Figure 24-7. The menu is now listed in the Project
and Menu tabs.

in a template menu are usually part of a button set.
✦Direct Select tool. Use to select, move, and resize individual objects, such as
buttons.
✦Text tool. Use the Text tool to create and edit text.
✦Vertical Text tool. Use the Vertical Text tool to create and edit vertical text.
✦Zoom tool. Use the Zoom tool to zoom in and out.
Use the Direct Select tool to move objects onscreen. Use the Text tools to edit the
text in the buttons. You can also use the Arrange, Align, and Distribute commands
found in the Object menu. These commands allow you to quickly move and align
objects onscreen. Figure 24-9 shows an expanded view of this menu.
Figure 24-9: Use Arrange, Align, and Distribute 
as you edit the menu.
Creating button links
In this section, you link the buttons on your menu page to the video. This link trig-
gers the video to play when the user clicks a button. Set up the screen windows so
that you can see the Project tab and the Menu Editor. To create a link to a button,
follow these steps:
1. Click on the video file in the Project tab that you want to link and drag it
over the button to which you want to link. When the video is positioned over
the button, release the mouse.
If you don’t release the mouse over a button, Encore creates new button on the
menu page.
Caution

567
Chapter 24 ✦Using Adobe Encore to Create DVDs
2. With the Selection tool activated, click the linked button. Observe the
Properties palette. Note that the Link field displays the link to the button, as
shown in Figure 24-10.
3. Observe the Timeline. Click the Timeline tab and note that Encore DVD cre-
ated a Timeline for the video file.
4. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to create more links to buttons, as needed.
Figure 24-10: A linked button listed in the
Properties palette.
Examining the Timeline
Encore’s Timeline tab provides a graphic display of the video and audio in your pro-
ject. The Timeline can display a track for video as well as for audio and subtitles.
Figure 24-11 shows a Timeline with an AVI video file and its audio file.
If you import an AVI with audio, the audio file is imported automatically with it. If
you import MPEG-2 files rather than AVI files, you will need to import the audio
separately.
Click the Timeline in the Project tab. Look at the Properties palette. The End Action
field in the Properties palette displays the name of the linked video, which indicates
that, after the video is over, the original menu will be displayed.
Note

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Figure 24-11: Encore’s Timeline provides a graphical representation of linked 
audio and video files.
Previewing the DVD
After you’ve created your menus and button links, you’re ready to preview your
DVD project. When you run the preview, Encore DVD creates a simulation mode
where you can test the button links:
1. To preview your DVD project, choose File ➪Preview.
2. When the project switches to Preview mode, click the menu screen buttons
to check that all the links work properly.
3. If you need to fix a link, click the button in the Project tab and correct the
link in the Properties palette.
Burning the DVD
After you’ve previewed your work and tested the button links, you’re ready to burn
a DVD. You’ll find burning options for the DVD on the Disc tab. Here are the steps:
1. In the Project window, select the Disc tab, shown in Figure 24-12.
2. In the first field, name the DVD.
3. In the drop-down menu, specify the DVD size that you are using.

his chapter takes you into the world of DVD creation. In
the previous chapter, you see how to quickly create a
DVD project with a menu screen and interactive buttons. This
chapter focuses on customization. It covers how to create
menus and buttons using your own graphic images and how
to customize links from buttons to menus, from buttons to
DVD chapters, and from buttons to the Timeline.
This chapter provides a step-by-step look at how to create 
a custom DVD presentation in Encore DVD (see the sidebar
“Custom DVD presentation” later in this chapter). After you
read through this chapter, you’ll be ready to go into DVD 
production.
A sample video, graphic button, and background are
included in the Chapter 25 folder in the Adobe Premiere
Pro DVD folder.
Creating Menus and Buttons 
from Still Images
Although Encore’s menu templates provide a quick means for
making menus and buttons, multimedia and design profes-
sionals will undoubtedly want to create their own based upon
On the
DVD-ROM

572
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
digitized images or backgrounds. This section shows you how to create menus from
scratch. Before you begin, it’s a good idea to plan your entire menu structure.
Design your menu on paper, and use flow charts to plan navigation. After you’ve
created all your source material or assets, you’re ready to start.
Creating menus from scratch
Encore DVD works hand-in-hand with Adobe Photoshop. Although Encore DVD can
read TIF, JPEG, and BMP graphics, your best is to create images in Photoshop and
import them directly into Encore DVD, particularly because Encore DVD can inter-
pret a Photoshop layer as a button.
In order for Encore DVD to correctly interpret Photoshop layers as DVD elements,
layer-naming prefixes are required in Photoshop. For instance, a layer set with but-
tons requires a “+” prefix, and subpicture (button highlight images) layer sets
require a “=” prefix.
Note
Custom DVD presentation
The general steps for creating a custom DVD presentation are as follows (we cover many of
these steps in this chapter):
1. Create the video and audio in Premiere Pro. (Note that Markers in Premiere Pro
can be used as chapters in Encore DVD.)
2. Plan the navigation for the DVD production.
3. Create the buttons and background screen for the menus in Photoshop or
another graphics application.
4. Import audio, graphics, and other assets into Encore.
5. Create a custom menu in Encore.
6. Place the background screen and buttons into Encore.
7. Create a Timeline or Timelines.
8. Create chapters in Timelines.
9. Link buttons to chapters.
10. Create disc navigation.
11. Preview the DVD project and burn a disc.

573
Chapter 25 ✦Customizing DVD Screens and Navigation in Adobe Encore DVD
If you want to create a menu from scratch, the steps are quite simple. Make sure
that the frame size of your image matches the size of your project. The default
aspect ratio in Encore DVD is 4:3. (You can change this to the DVD Widescreen 
format of 16:9.)
1. If you haven’t created a new project, create the project by choosing File ➪
New Project. Click the NTSC or PAL choice and click OK
2. Import the background screen that you want to use for your menu by choos-
ing File ➪Import as Asset. In the Import as Asset dialog box, select your file
and click Open.
3. Choose Menu ➪New Menu (you can also click the New Menu button at the
bottom of the Project palette). The menu appears in the Project window.
4. To rename the menu window, right-click on the New Menu listing in the
Project palette and enter a new name in the Rename Menu dialog box.
Alternatively, you can rename the menu in the Name field of the Properties
window.
5. Drag the background image from the Project window into the Menu Editor
(see Figure 25-1).
Figure 25-1: A custom background loaded into the Menu Editor.

574
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Adding buttons to the menu
After you’ve created your custom menu, you may want to add buttons you’ve created
in Photoshop or another graphic application to your DVD screen. To add buttons,
follow these steps:
1. Import graphic elements into your project by choosing File➪Import as Asset.
2. Drag the button graphic or button graphics to the Menu screen.
3. With the button graphic selected, choose Object ➪Convert to Button.
4. If you want all the buttons on the menu to be similar, drag the same button
object to the menu screen as many times as you want; then repeat Step 3 
so that Encore recognizes them as different buttons. Figure 25-2 shows four
buttons created in Photoshop added to a menu.
Figure 25-2: Buttons created in Photoshop used in Encore.
Menu Editor controls
When working in the Menu Editor, use the Object menu to align and distribute your
buttons. You can also press the arrow directional keys to move selected objects
right, left, up, and down. In the Menu Editor, the buttons at the bottom of the screen
provide the following utilities:

575
Chapter 25 ✦Customizing DVD Screens and Navigation in Adobe Encore DVD
✦Show Safe Area. Displays the title and action-safe zones — zones that help
ensure that text and graphics are not cut off from the TV monitor. If your pro-
duction will be viewed on a television monitor, don’t place text beyond the
inner title safety zone and don’t place crucial visual objects outside of the
outer action safety zone.
✦Show Button Routing. Routing buttons are menu buttons that can be used as
DVD remote control buttons. If you turn off the Automatically Route button
option in the Menu palette, remote control routing for buttons will be displayed
in the menus.
✦Show Normal Subpicture Highlight. Subpictures allow you to create different
color button states for activated buttons. This option displays the unselected
state for buttons.
To use subpictures for buttons, choose Object ➪Convert to Subpicture. Setting
highlight colors for subpictures is discussed in the next section.
✦Show Selected Subpicture Highlight. This option displays the selected or
highlighted state for buttons.
✦Show Activated Subpicture Highlight. This option displays the activated state
for buttons. (Activation requires selecting a button with the remote control
and pressing Enter. However, buttons can be set to Auto Activate when simply
clicked by the mouse. To set a button to Auto Activate, select the button and
choose Auto Activate from the Properties palette.)
Using Color Sets for Menus and Buttons
When you click a button or move the mouse over a button, it typically changes 
colors, or when you click text, it also changes colors. The different colored pictures
that appear when you activate buttons are referred to as subpictures. Encore
assigns colors to subpictures using color sets. Fifteen colors comprise each color
set, and each menu can use only one specific color set. Because you can have many
different menus in a DVD production, you can use multiple color sets. However, to
help ensure a consistent look throughout a project, utilizing only one color set for
your project is a good idea.
By default, Encore DVD uses one predefined color set. If you don’t want to use this
default color set, you can change its colors, or you can create your own. Once
defined, you can save color sets and use them in other projects. To view the color
sets, choose Edit ➪Color Sets ➪Menu. This opens the Menu Color Set dialog box,
shown in Figure 25-3.
At first, the layout of the Menu Color Set dialog box may look confusing. The group-
ing in the dialog box shows three different colors for normal states, three different
colors for selected states, and three different colors for activated states. Each set of
three colors is called a highlight group. Thus, you could use one highlight group for
Note

576
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
buttons labeled part 1, part 2, and so on, and another highlight group for buttons
labeled “next chapter” or “previous chapter.” As mentioned earlier, only one color
set is allowed for each menu. If you want to change colors for any color set, simply
click the color swatch and adjust the colors in the color picker dialog box that
appears, or change the percentage field. If you want to create a new color set, click
the New Color Set button (the page icon to the left of the disc icon).
Figure 25-3: The Menu Color Set dialog box controls 
the highlight color for buttons.
Changing menu color sets
You can easily change color sets using the Menus tab and Properties palette. Here
are the steps:
1. Select the Menus tab in the Project window.
2. Select the menu whose color set you want to set or change. You can Shift+click
to add to other menus to the selection.
3. If the Properties palette isn’t open, choose Window ➪Properties to open it.
4. Click the Color Set pop-up menu and select a color set. If you haven’t created
your own custom color set, choose Menu Default.
Choosing highlight groups for subpictures
You can also easily change highlight groups using the Menus tab and Properties

Creating and Using Timelines
After you’ve planned your navigation and created your menus and buttons, you’ll
need to create a Timeline for your DVD production. Like Premiere Pro’s Timeline,
Encore’s provides a visual representation of source footage and sound. However, in
Encore, the Timeline displays only one video track and one audio track. Figure 25-4
shows a Timeline with the current-time indicator and a chapter Marker. For NTSC
productions, the Timeline frame rate is 29.97 frames per second; for PAL, the frame
rate is 25 frames per second.
The default length in the Timeline for still images is 6 seconds. To change the
default length, choose Edit ➪Preferences ➪Timeline.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Here’s how to create a Timeline in Encore DVD and add video or still images to it:
1. Create a new Timeline by choosing Timeline ➪New Timeline.
2. Drag the video or still image from the Project window into the Timeline.
Video clips are automatically positioned at the start of the Timeline and
assigned to be Chapter 1. If you place still images on the Timeline instead,
chapter entries are created at the beginning of each still image.
3. Right-click a Timeline in the Project tab and then choose Rename in the
pop-up menu to assign a name to the Timeline. The Rename Timeline dialog
box opens, where you can enter a name for the Timeline. You can also rename
the Timeline by editing the name in the Properties palette.
4. Select the video or still image in the Project window, and choose Timeline ➪
New Timeline. Adobe Encore DVD opens the Timeline window and creates a
new Timeline with the video or still image already placed on the video track.
You can create a Timeline automatically and place images on it by selecting the
video in the Project window and choosing Timeline ➪New Timeline.
Adding a chapter point to the Timeline
In DVD movie productions, chapter points typically are used as a means for jumping
to specific scenes. In Encore DVD, you can mark a frame on the Timeline as a chap-
ter point and then link menus, buttons, or other Timelines to it. To keep organized,
you can assign names to chapter points and even write notes about specific chap-
ter points. (You can write descriptive notes in the Properties palette when creating
chapter points.)
Here’s how to create chapter points on the Timeline:
1. If the Timeline window is not onscreen, open it by Choosing Window ➪
Timeline. 
2. If you want to preview the video as you add chapter points, open the Monitor
window by choosing Window ➪Monitor.
3. Click and drag the current-timeline indicator to the frame where you want
to create the chapter point. 
If you have placed an MPEG-2 video in the Timeline, you can click the Skip
Forward or Skip Backward button to move to a GOP header (a GOP is a continuous
Groups of Pictures and is usually 13 frames long), which is indicated by the white
vertical lines at the bottom of the ruler. Chapter points for MPEG-2 files must start
at the nearest prior GOP header. If you are working with AVI videos, Adobe recom-
mends that chapter points be at least 15 frames apart to ensure best quality.
4. To create a chapter point, choose Timeline ➪Add Chapter Point or click the
Add Chapter button beneath the ruler in the Timeline window.

4. If the Properties palette is not open, choose Window ➪Properties. The
Properties palette displays the chapter point’s attributes.
5. In the Properties palette, change the name of the chapter.
6. To add a description, click in the Description box and type a description 
of the chapter point.
Customizing Navigation
After you’ve assembled your buttons in the Menu Editor, picked your subpicture
colors, and added chapters, your next step is to ensure that the buttons lead your
viewers in the right direction. The following sections provide details about looping
menu buttons, menu navigation, first-play options, the duration the menu stays
onscreen, and button navigation.

Chapter 25 ✦Customizing DVD Screens and Navigation in Adobe Encore DVD
The optional Override options specify the end action for the first-play link, overrid-
ing the default end action of the menu or Timeline. In the Override field, you can
designate a menu and the button to highlight or a Timeline and starting chapter
point.
Setting menu display time and looping
If you’re planning to have your DVD displayed at a kiosk or at a public locale such
as a museum, you may want to use Encore’s menu display settings to control navi-
gation if no one clicks a button. Menu-timing choices are controlled in the menu’s
Properties palette. Activate the palette for a menu by first clicking the menu in the
Project palette and then clicking the Menu tab. The timing choices are as follows:
✦Hold Forever. The menu is displayed until an action is taken. This is the default
setting.
✦Duration. Set the duration in time. For a motion menu, the Duration should be
the time multiplied by the Loop settings.
✦Loop #. Use the Loop setting to choose how many times the menu repeats
itself.
✦Loop Point. Use the Loop Point setting for animated buttons. Click the Animate
Button check box and enter the time in the Loop Point field.
Setting button navigation
Without question, the most common interactive navigational tool in DVD productions
is the button. When linking buttons in Encore DVD, you must link to another menu
or to a chapter point in a Timeline. When linking a button, the most versatile means
is to use the button’s Property palette.
Here are the steps to create a link from a menu button to a menu or chapter point.
When creating the link, you can link directly from the button in the Menu Editor, or
you can create a link from the button via the Menus tab.
1. If the Menus tab isn’t activated, choose Window ➪Menus.
2. In the Menus tab, click the menu that contains the buttons that you want to
link or double-click the menu, which opens the menu in the Menu Editor
window.
3. Select the button from which you want to create a link. If you are working 
in the Menu Editor, select a button with the Selection tool, which selects the
button set.
4. If the Properties window isn’t open, choose Window ➪Properties.

point as to where the video should begin to play.
Figure 25-7: Creating a navigation link for a button.
Setting Timeline Navigation
When you activate the Timeline tab in the Project window, Encore DVD provides
two navigation choices. You can set an end action for the Timeline, or you can set 
a menu remote link. An end action specifies where the navigation heads when the
Timeline finishes playing. The menu remote choice creates a destination for the DVD
navigation when the user clicks the remote control. Normally, when the viewer clicks
the remote control, navigation returns to the last menu used. Here are the steps for
setting these Timeline navigation choices:
1. Select a Timeline in the Project tab.
2. If the Properties palette isn’t open, open it by choosing Window➪Property. If
the Properties palette’s tab is open onscreen, click it. The Property tab will
now show properties for the selected Timeline.
3. In the Properties palette, select a destination for End Action by clicking 
the pop-up menu down arrow and choosing an option from the submenu,
as shown in Figure 25-8. Notice that Figure 25-8 shows another Timeline as a
possible navigational link. If doing so is more convenient, you could also create
the link by clicking and dragging the Pick Whip icon to an asset in the Project
window.

Trimming Clips
in After Effects
A
dobe Premiere Pro features a complete set of video-edit-
ing tools. However, from time to time, you may need to
make a few quick edits in Adobe After Effects 6.0. Adobe After
Effects is another digital video editing application created by
Adobe Systems. It provides certain functionality that Premiere
Pro does not, such as creating Bézier masks in the Composition
window (see Chapter 29), creating motion paths, and compos-
ite projects (see Chapter 30). We’ve included a trial version of
After Effects 6.0 on the DVD that accompanies this book. You
can go to www.adobe.com for details on purchasing the prod-
uct. If you import a video clip into After Effects to create masks
or special effects, you may find it more convenient to change
the clips’ in and out points while you work in After Effects.
See Chapter 30 to learn how to create special effects in
After Effects; Chapter 29 covers creating masks in After
Effects.
After you trim clips in After Effects, you can save your work as
either an AVI movie or a QuickTime movie. Later, you can
import the AVI movie or the QuickTime movie into Adobe
Premiere Pro for more video editing and compositing. You can
also export your After Effects work as a sequence of separate
graphic files. Later, you can import the sequence folder into
Premiere Pro.
Many digital video producers use both Premiere Pro and After
Effects 6.0 to create a project. This chapter introduces you to
trimming a video clip in After Effects using the Layer window,
as well as trimming in the Timeline window. The chapter also
shows you how to export clips from After Effects as AVI movies,
QuickTime movies, and graphic sequences.
For information on editing video clips using Adobe Premiere
Pro, refer to Chapters 7 and 13.

Trimming in After Effects: What’s It All About?
In Adobe After Effects, you can use either the Layer window or the Timeline window
to trim a video clip from a Premiere Pro project. You can trim a clip at the beginning
or at the end of a video clip. When you trim at the beginning, you change the clip’s
in point. When you trim at the end of the video clip, you change the clip’s out point.
As in Premiere Pro, even though the in and out points change after editing, the orig-
inal in and out points are always accessible. You can reedit the clip at any time.
When you trim the in point in the Layer window, the clip is edited in the Timeline
window, but its starting time in the composition doesn’t change. Also, when you
trim a still image, only the duration of the still image changes, not the actual still
image.
Creating an After Effects project
Trimming video clips in After Effects’ Timeline window is easy. To trim a video clip
using After Effect’s Timeline window, you need to have an After Effects project
onscreen with at least one video clip in the Timeline window. You can also import 
a Premiere project into After Effects and trim the Premiere Pro project using After
Effects’ Timeline window.
Here’s how to create an After Effects project and import video clips and Premiere
projects:
1. Choose File➪New Project to create a new project. You can also choose to
load an existing After Effects project, or you can load a Premiere project. (If you
want to import a Premiere project into After Effects, skip Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
and jump to Step 7.)
2. Choose Composition ➪New Composition to create a new composition. The
Composition Settings dialog box appears (see Figure 26-1).
3. Set the Frame Size to the same size as that of the project. Choose a preset
and notice that the Width and Height values automatically change. If you
want, you can change the Frame Rate and Resolution settings. If you are work-
ing with a Premiere Pro project that uses a Non-DV preset, select the appropri-
ate Non-DV preset from the Preset pop-up menu in the Composition Settings
dialog box. For DVD output, choose a DV preset.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Choose File ➪Import ➪File or Multiple Files. Locate a video clip to use and
click Open. Continue selecting clips and clicking Open. When you have
imported all the video clips and still images you are going to use in the pro-
ject, click the Done button.
If you want, you can follow along using the video clips found in the Chapter 26
folder on the DVD that accompanies this book. The video clips are Digital Vision’s
800052f.mov and 800063f.mov from the Flux CD-ROM.

File ➪Import ➪File. In the Import File dialog box, choose a file and then set the
Import As pop-up menu to Composition. For more information on working with
Adobe Photoshop, turn to Chapter 27.
Trimming Using the Timeline Window
When you have an After Effects project with the items you need in the Timeline 
window, you can trim them using the Timeline window. Trimming using the
Timeline window is easy. You can trim using the Timeline window by either 
dragging the in and out points in the layer duration bar or by using the current-
time indicator.
Trimming with the layer duration bar
A video clip’s duration in the Timeline window is displayed as a layer duration bar.
Figure 26-3 shows the layer duration bar before trimming. Figure 26-4 shows the
layer duration bar after trimming. Here’s how to trim using the layer duration bar:
✦To trim the in point. Click at the beginning of a clip and drag to the right to
change the in point and to trim the video clip.
✦To trim the out point. Click at the end of a clip and drag to the left to change
the out point and to trim the video clip.

Trimming Using the Layer Window
Trimming in the After Effects 6.0 Layer window is similar to trimming in Premiere
Pro’s Monitor window except that trimming a clip’s in point in the After Effect’s Layer
window doesn’t affect the clip’s relative starting position in the Timeline window. In
other words, no gap appears in front of it when you remove frames from the clip’s
in point.
Here’s how to trim using the Layer window:
1. Choose File ➪New Project to create a new project. You can also choose to
load a project. If you want to import a Premiere project into After Effects, skip
Steps 2, 3, and 4 and jump to Step 5.
2. Choose Composition ➪New Composition to create a new composition. The
Composition Settings dialog box appears.
3. Set the Frame Size to be the same size as the size of the project. Choose a

The Photoshop
Connection
D
uring video production, you may want to export still
frames from your Adobe Premiere Pro project for use
on a Web page or in a print document, such as a brochure. If
you export the still frames to Adobe Photoshop, you can pre-
pare them for print and optimize them for the Web. You can
even export an entire Premiere project with all of its video
tracks into After Effects. Once in After Effects, each track
appears as a separate layer. A frame exported from After
Effects to Photoshop retains its layers. A frame exported from
Premiere Pro to Photoshop does not.
Photoshop can also be used as an image data source. You can
use Photoshop to create backgrounds, titles, or images with
alpha channels. These images can then be integrated into a
Premiere Pro project.
Exporting a Premiere Pro
Frame to Photoshop
Although Premiere Pro is primarily used for creating desktop
video projects, you can easily export a video frame from your
project to use as a still image. The frame can be any individual
frame from a clip, or it can display a frame from a transition or
video effect.
In addition to using the still frame for print purposes, you can
use the still frame to create or enhance a Web site or to create
a background scene in an interactive presentation. After the

To learn how to export an entire video clip as a QuickTime or AVI movie, see
Chapter 19. To learn how to export a Premiere Pro video clip to Photoshop as a
Filmstrip file, see Chapter 18.
Here’s how to export a frame from Adobe Premiere Pro:
1. Open or create a Premiere Pro project.
2. After you have a Premiere Pro project onscreen, locate the frame you want
to export. Start by opening the Monitor window. To display the Monitor 
window, choose Window ➪Show Monitor.
3. Use the Frame Forward and Frame Back buttons in the Monitor window to
locate the frame you want to export. Figure 27-1 shows the frame that we want
to export in the Monitor window.
Figure 27-1: The still frame that will be exported.
4. After you have chosen the frame you want to export, choose File ➪Export ➪
Frame.
5. In the Export Frame dialog box, you can name your frame. Also notice that
below the File name field, the frame’s make and video size appear. Click the
Settings button if you need to change the file format and image size.
6. In the Export Frame Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 27-2, General
should be selected. To choose a file format, click the File Type pop-up menu.
You can choose TIFF, Targa, Windows Bitmap, or CompuServe GIF. If you are
going to use the still frame for print, you’ll probably want to save your file in
TIFF format. Use the Targa format if you are going to import this frame into a
3D program. If you are going to use this frame for multimedia purposes, choose
Windows Bitmap.

Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
Figure 27-2: The Export Frame Settings dialog box’s General settings 
enable you to export a still frame as a TIFF, Targa, BMP, or GIF file.
If you are going to use the frame for the Web and want to reduce the number of
colors in the image to 256, use the GIF format. When you pick the GIF format, a
Compile Settings button appears. You can click this button and choose whether
you want your GIF file to be dithered and whether you want the image to con-
tain a transparent background.
The Export Frame Settings dialog box Video settings enable you to change the
color depth and choose a compressor and frame size for the exported still
frame.
If you are going to use this frame for multimedia purposes, you may want to import
the still frame into Macromedia Director. To learn more about using Premiere Pro
and Macromedia Director, turn to Chapter 23.
7. When you finish adjusting the General and Video settings, click OK to
return to the Export Frame dialog box.
8. In the Export Frame dialog box, click Save to save the frame in the format
chosen. The frame just saved appears onscreen. If this is the right frame, you
can close the file and export another frame or quit Premiere Pro and load
Photoshop to import the frame.
Importing a still frame from Premiere

After you’ve exported a still frame from Premiere Pro, you’ll probably want to import
it into Photoshop to either color-correct it or incorporate it into a collage or other
project.
Note

600
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Here’s how to import a still frame from Premiere Pro into Photoshop:
1. Load Adobe Photoshop.
2. Choose File ➪Open.
3. In the Open dialog box, locate and select the Premiere Pro file you saved as
a still image. Then click the Open button to import the Premiere Pro file
into Photoshop.
4. When the Premiere still image file opens in Photoshop, you see all the
tracks flattened in one layer.
If you want to load a Premiere Pro frame into Photoshop and have the tracks appear
as separate layers, you must export the frame to Adobe After Effects first, which is
discussed in the following section.
Exporting an After Effects Frame to Photoshop
You can use After Effects to export a frame from a Premiere Pro project to Photoshop.
If you import a Premiere Pro project into After Effects, then you can export a frame
from the Premiere Pro project that is in After Effects to Photoshop. In After Effects,
the video tracks from a Premiere Pro project appear as separate layers. Following
are the steps to import a Premiere Pro project into After Effects and then export a
frame from the Premiere Pro project that is in After Effects to Photoshop:
1. Load Adobe After Effects.
2. Choose File ➪New ➪Project. In the New Project dialog box, pick a preset
and type a name for your project. Then click OK.
3. Choose File ➪Import ➪File. In the Import File dialog box that appears, locate
the Premiere Pro project you want to import. Then set the Import As pop-up
menu to Composition. Click Import to import the Premiere project into the
After Effects project.
4. Double-click the Composition file in the Project window to display the
Timeline window and Composition window. In the Timeline window, all
Premiere Pro tracks appear as layers. In the Composition window, you see 
the layers as a composite.
5. Move the current-time indicator in the Timeline window to the frame you
want to export.
6. Choose Composition ➪Save Frame As ➪Photoshop Layers to save the still
frame with all of its layers. To save a still frame as a composite without the
layers, choose Composition ➪Save Frame As ➪File.
7. To open the file in Photoshop, load Adobe Photoshop and choose File ➪
Open to open the file. When the file opens, the video tracks from Premiere
appear in different Photoshop layers.

Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
Creating and Importing a Photoshop
Sequence File into Premiere Pro
In this section, you learn how to create a presentation by first exporting four frames
from Adobe Premiere Pro into Adobe Photoshop to create a sequence file. In the
Photoshop sequence file, each frame becomes a layer. Text is added to each of the
layers (frames). Afterwards, the Photoshop layer file is imported into Premiere Pro
as a sequence file where sound is added to create a presentation. Figure 27-3 shows
four frames of a Premiere Pro project created using a Photoshop sequence file.
Figure 27-3: Frames from a Premiere Pro presentation (FashionShow) created using an
photoshop Adobe sequence file.
To create a Photoshop sequence file by exporting frames from a Premiere Pro video
clip, follow these steps:
1. Open a Premiere Pro project with a video clip that you want to use to cre-
ate a presentation. If you want to use the video clip that was used to create
the presentation shown in Figure 27-3, create a new Premiere Pro project and
then choose File ➪Import. Locate the file (Digital Vision’s 567026f.mov CityMix
video clip) and click Open.
2. Drag the video clip from the Project window to Video track 1 in the
Timeline window.

602
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Digital Vision’s 567026f.mov CityMix video clip (used to create the frames in
Figure 27-3), is found in the Chapter 27 folder (which is in the Tutorial Projects
folder) on the DVD that accompanies this book.
3. Export four frames. To export each frame, move the Timeline Marker to the
frame you want to export. Then choose File➪Export➪Frame. Click the Settings
button. In the Export Frame Settings dialog box, click the File Type pop-up
menu and choose TIFF. Click OK. In the Export Frame dialog box, name your
frame and then click Save to export the frame.
The first frame we exported was at 00:00 on the Timeline, the second frame was
at 01:07 on the Timeline, the third frame was at 12:26 on the Timeline, and the
fourth frame was at 21:16 on the Timeline.
4. Create a new Photoshop file with the same dimensions as the Premiere Pro
video clip and name it Fashion.
5. Use Photoshop to open all the exported frame files.
6. Drag and drop each exported frame file into the Fashion file. Each frame
should now be a layer in the Photoshop Fashion file.
The bottom layer should be the frame that you want to appear first and the
top layer should the frame you want to appear last.
7. To rearrange the layers, click and drag them up or down in the Layers palette.
8. Close all the files except the Fashion file.
9. Click on the eye icon to hide all the layers except the bottom layer.
10. Use the Horizontal Type tool to create type in the bottom layer.
In Adobe Photoshop CS, you can create text on a path.
11. Move the mouse to the place on the image where you want the text to
appear and click the mouse once. Begin typing.
12. With the text selected, select a font and size. You can also add tracking
(spacing between the letters). To do so, use the Character palette. Choose
Window ➪Character to display the Character palette.
13. To add interesting effects to your text, choose Layer ➪Layer Style, then
choose an effect. To create the text effect shown earlier in Figure 27-3, we
used the Drop Shadow, Inner Shadow, Outer Shadow, Color Overlay, and
Pattern Overlay Layer Style options. After you apply the effects, the effects
appear in the Layers palette. We also used the Warp Text option on the text.
This option is found just the below the menu bar.
14. To move the text onscreen, drag it with the Move tool.
Note
On the
DVD-ROM

603
Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
You may be wondering why we didn’t just use Premiere Pro to create the text. We
used Photoshop to create the text, and not Premiere Pro, because Photoshop has
powerful layer style features that enable you to create 3D text effects.
15. Now that you’ve created some text and stylized it, you can duplicate it and
then edit it to use on another layer. To do so, follow these steps:
a. To duplicate the text layer, click and drag the text layer over the
Create a New Layer icon in the Layers palette.
b. Click the eye icon above the bottom layer to display the next layer.
c. Drag the duplicated text layer above the displayed layer.
d. Now, use the Move tool to move the text into the desired location.
e. Use the Horizontal Type tool to edit the text.
16. To add text to the third layer from the bottom, first display the layer by
clicking on the eye icon in the Layers palette. Next, you need to duplicate,
move, and edit the text as you did in the preceding step. After you’ve done
that, repeat this process to add text to the fourth layer from the bottom.
17. Merge the text down to the frame below it by selecting the text layer and
choosing Merge Down from the Layers palette pop-up menu. Do this for
each text layer. This way, you have only four layers, rather than eight.
18. Choose File ➪Save to save your work. Be sure to save your work in
Photoshop format with all of its layers.
Now you are ready to import the Photoshop sequence file into Premiere Pro to 
create a presentation:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project to create a new project. In the New Project 
dialog box, pick a DV-NTSC (Standard 32 KHz) preset that matches the
dimensions of the Photoshop file. 
2. Choose File ➪Import and locate the Photoshop file and click Open. When
the Import Layered File dialog box appears, click the Import As pop-up 
menu and choose Sequence, as shown in Figure 27-4. Click OK to import the
Photoshop file as a sequence.
Figure 27-4: Premiere Pro’s Import Layered File 
dialog box allows you to import sequence files.
Note

604
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
The Photoshop sequence file will appear in the Project window as a folder
with the layers within the folder, as shown in Figure 27-5.
Figure 27-5: When you import a Photoshop
sequence file into Premiere Pro, the contents of
the file appear in a folder in the Project window.
3. Open the sequence folder if it is not already open; in the folder, double-click
FashionSequence. Notice that all the layers of the sequence appear in a sepa-
rate video track in the Timeline window, shown in Figure 27-6. The Photoshop
files appear in Project window and Timeline window in the same order as they
did in the Layers palette in Photoshop. The file FashionSequence is in the
Chapter 27 folder, which is in the Tutorial Projects folder that is on the DVD
that accompanies the book.
Figure 27-6: Double-click the sequence file in the Project 
window to have the sequence appear in the Timeline window.
If you create a graphic at 720 × 480 (or 720 × 486) in a square pixel program such
as Adobe Photoshop 7 and import it into a Premiere Pro NTSC DV project, the
graphic may appear distorted in Premiere Pro. The graphic is distorted because
Premiere Pro automatically converts it to a non-square 0.9 pixel aspect ratio. You
can convert the imported Photoshop graphic file back to square pixels. First, select
the graphic image in the Project window. Then choose File ➪Interpret Footage. In
Note

605
Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
the Pixel Aspect Ratio section of the Interpret Footage dialog box, click Conform to
and choose Square Pixels (1.0) in the pop-up menu and click OK. Although this
technique works, it may result in a reduction in graphic quality. If you are using
Photoshop 7, your best bet is to create full-screen graphics for DV projects at 720 ×
534 or 720 × 540 (768 × 576, PAL). After creating your graphics, import them into
Premiere Pro with the General Project Settings option “Scale clip to project dimen-
sions when adding to sequence” selected. This will squeeze the graphic to fit into
your DV project without distortion.
If you are creating full-screen graphic files in Photoshop CS for a Premiere Pro DV
project, create them in Photoshop CS using the 720 × 480 DV preset. If you use
this preset (which sets the Photoshop pixel aspect ratio to .9), you should be able
to import Photoshop files seamlessly into a Premiere Pro DV project without any
distortion.
4. Use the Selection tool to move the clips in the Timeline window so that 
they appear as seen in Figure 27-6. The end of the first clip should overlap
the beginning of the second clip. The end of the second clip should overlap the
beginning of the third clip, and the third clip should overlap the beginning of
the fourth clip. 
5. Now add transitions to the overlapping areas between the clips. We added
the Dither Dissolve transition to the overlapping areas of the first and second
clips. To the overlapping areas of the second and third clips, we used the Roll
Away transition. To the overlapping areas between the third and fourth clips,
we used the Page Peel Transition.
6. To complete your presentation, add some sound to it by choosing File ➪
Import. Locate and select a sound file. Then click Open to import the file. 
We used Digital Vision’s 730005aw.wav Acoustic Chillout clip.
You can find Digital Vision’s 730005aw.wav Acoustic Chillout clip in the Chapter 27
folder (which is on the Tutorial Projects folder) on the DVD that accompanies this
book.
7. To preview the presentation, click the Play button in the Monitor window.
Be sure to save your work when you are finished.
Creating a Photoshop File 
with an Alpha Channel
To have the bird.psd file (shown in Figure 27-7) appear in Premiere Pro without its
background, you must select the bird and then save the selection to an alpha chan-
nel. When you load the file into Premiere Pro, the alpha channel enables you to use
the Motion Settings to animate the bird, without its background appearing.
On the
DVD-ROM

606
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Figure 27-7: Photoshop file of a bird
before creating an alpha channel.
After you load Photoshop, follow these steps to select an image and save the selec-
tion to an alpha channel:
1. Open the file with the image you want to isolate.
To use the bird image (shown in Figure 27-7), load the bird.psd file found in the
Chapter 27 folder (which is on the Tutorial Projects folder) on the DVD that accom-
panies this book.
2. Use a Photoshop Selection tool (the Pen tool, the Magic Wand, or the Lasso
tool) to select the image you want to isolate from the background. We used
the Polygonal Lasso tool to select the bird. For a soft-edged selection, we 
set the Lasso tool to have a feather radius of 1.
3. With the selection onscreen, choose Select ➪Save Selection. In the Save
Selection dialog box, shown in Figure 27-8, we clicked the Channel pop-up
menu and set it to New and left the Operation radio button set to New
Channel. Then we clicked Save to save the selection to an alpha channel.
To load a saved selection, choose Select ➪Load Selection.
Figure 27-8: The Save Selection dialog box 
enables you to save a selection to an alpha channel.
Note

DVD-ROM

607
Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
4. To see the alpha channel, choose Window ➪Channels. In the Channels
palette, you see a Red, a Green, a Blue, and an Alpha channel, as shown in
Figure 27-9. Click Alpha 1 in the Channels palette to display the alpha channel.
The alpha channel shown in Figure 27-10 displays the white area as the selected
area. The white area is the only area that Premiere Pro reads. The black area
represents the area that Premiere Pro won’t read. (This happens only if the
Color Indicates option, in the Channel Options dialog box, is set to Masked
Areas — the default setting. To display the Channel Options dialog box, double-
click Alpha 1 in the Channels palette.)
5. To import this file into Premiere Pro with the alpha channel, save the alpha
channel with the file by choosing File ➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box,
click the Format pop-up menu and choose Photoshop format. In the Save 
section, only the Alpha Channel option should be selected. Click Save to save
the file.
Figure 27-9: The Channels palette with its channels.

alpha channel displayed.
Placing a Photoshop alpha channel 
file into a Premiere Pro project
Now that you’ve created a Photoshop file with an alpha channel, you are ready to
import it into Premiere Pro. After it’s in Premiere Pro, you’ll use the bird image to
create a project called Freebird. Figure 27-11 shows a few frames from the Freebird
Premiere Pro project.

608
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Figure 27-11: Frames from the Freebird project.
To create the Freebird project, we used two Photoshop files — a background file
(3dwindow.psd) and an alpha channel file (bird.psd) — and created some text using
Premiere’s Adobe Title Designer. Here’s how to import a Photoshop file with an alpha
channel into a Premiere project:
1. Load Adobe Premiere Pro. Then choose File ➪New ➪Project to create 
a new project. In the New Project dialog box, pick the Square-Pixel 640 x 480
Non-DV preset, name your project, and click OK.
2. In a new Premiere project, choose File ➪Import.
3. In the Import dialog box, locate the Photoshop file with an alpha channel
(bird.psd) and click Open. Premiere stores the file in the Project window.
4. Choose File ➪Import to import a background video clip or image. We used
the file 3dwindow.psd for the background.
The bird image (bird.psd), and the background image (3dwindow.psd) are located
in the Chapter 27 folder (which is on the Tutorial Projects folder) on the DVD that
accompanies this book.
5. Drag the bird file from the Project window to Video track 2 in the Timeline
window.
On the
DVD-ROM

609
Chapter 27 ✦The Photoshop Connection
6. Drag the background file (3dwindow.psd) from the Project window to Video
track 1 in the Timeline window. In Video track 3, you’ll place some text created
using the Adobe Title Designer. Figure 27-12 shows the Timeline window for
the Freebird project.
Figure 27-12: The Timeline window used to create 
the Freebird project.
7. Choose File ➪New ➪Title. In the Adobe Title Designer window, shown in
Figure 27-13, make sure the Show Video option is selected so that you can see
the background image. Select the Type tool, move the cursor to the black area
of the background, and type the text Freebird. Choose a font. We used Alba
Super Regular. 
To animate the bird image, we used Premiere Pro’s Motion settings, shown 
in Figure 27-14. The Motion settings are found in the Effect Controls window.
The bird in the Freebird project moves from the top-right corner down to the
bottom-left side.
8. To start the animation, move the Edit line to the beginning of the clip, and
click the word Motion in the Effect Controls window. Move the bird to the
top-left corner. Click on the Position Toggle Animation icon to create a
keyframe. Now keep moving the Edit line and the bird to create more
keyframes.
9. To preview the Freebird project, click the Play button in the Monitor win-
dow. By creating an alpha channel for the bird file, you can have the bird image
move without having the background move with it. In order to create the alpha
channel, we had to create and save a selection around the bird (refer to the
previous section to learn how). When you save a selection, Photoshop saves
the selection as a mask in an alpha channel. Because the bird image is in Video
track 2, between the text that is in Video track 3 and the background image
that is in Video track 1, when you add motion to the bird, the bird will move
from behind the text to in front of the text.

11. Choose File ➪Save to save your work.
Summary
You can easily export a frame from Premiere Pro to Photoshop or export Photoshop
files into Premiere Pro.
✦If you want to load a Premiere Pro frame into Photoshop and have a Premiere
Pro frame appear as a layer, export the Premiere project to After Effects first.
✦Premiere Pro automatically reads the background transparency of Photoshop
layers. It does not convert Photoshop transparency into a white background.

Using Adobe
Premiere Pro
and Adobe
Illustrator
A
dobe Illustrator is one of the most powerful desktop
illustration programs available for personal computers.
Using Adobe Illustrator, graphic designers can place text on a
curve or bend and reshape the letters in a word. Illustrator,
which is a vector-based program, provides designers with the
power they need to create virtually any shape that can be
drawn. In vector-based programs, shapes are defined mathe-
matically and can easily be moved and reshaped. In Adobe
Illustrator, shapes appear as paths filled or outlined with color.
Onscreen, a path resembles a wireframe outline with tiny
squares called anchor points. Editing the anchor points edits
the path.
For Adobe Premiere Pro users, Adobe Illustrator opens up a
new world of possibilities. Adobe Illustrator type and shapes
can be imported directly into Adobe Premiere Pro. When
Premiere Pro opens an Illustrator file, it automatically converts
it from Illustrator’s vector format to Premiere Pro’s raster for-
mat and appears with transparent backgrounds. This conver-
sion enables you not only to use the Illustrator text but also 
to use shapes created in Illustrator as masks.
Working with Illustrator Type
You can create type effects in Adobe Illustrator 10 and then
import them into Adobe Premiere Pro for use as title effects,
logos, credits, and more. You can also import Illustrator type
into Premiere Pro and use the type as a mask and have a video
clip run through the shape of the text, as described later in
this chapter.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
For creating title effects and logos, you may want to use Adobe Illustrator CS’s new
3D shapes and type tool features. Adobe Illustrator CS also allows you to wrap art-
work around shapes.
Adobe Illustrator features six tools with which to create type.
The Type tool enables you to create text that reads horizontally, from left to right.
The Area Type tool is used to create type inside a shape. You can select the Ellipse,
Polygon, Star, or Rectangle tools to create a shape. To create more elaborate shapes,
you can apply one of Illustrator’s Effect commands to a shape, such as the Punk &
Bloat command (Effect➪Distort & Transform➪Punk & Bloat). With a shape
onscreen, click inside the shape with the Area Type tool and then start typing. Your
text appears onscreen in the shape of the path shape and reads from left to right.
The Path Type tool creates text on a path. To use the Path Type tool, you first need
to create a path. You can create a path using the Pen, Pencil, Paintbrush, or Ellipse
tool. You can also use the Spiral tool to create a spiral path on which the text can
appear (see Figure 28-1).
Figure 28-1: A spiral path with text.
Note

615
Chapter 28 ✦Using Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Illustrator
After you’ve created a path, click it with the Path Type tool and start typing. The
text appears on the path as you type (as shown in Figure 28-1). In some cases, the
font size may be too big to appear on the path. In this case, you may need to scale
down the font size. To do so, click and drag over the text with the Path Type tool to
select it. Then choose Type ➪Size and pick a size or click the Font Size pop-up menu
in the Character palette. To display the Character palette, choose Type ➪Window ➪
Type ➪Character.
The Vertical Type tool flows text from top to bottom (vertically), rather than from
left to right (horizontally) as the Type tool does. To create vertical text, click the
Vertical Type tool in the Toolbox, click in the document where you want the type 
to appear, and then start typing.
The Vertical Area Type tool works like the Area Type tool. Both type tools create type
within a path. When type appears while using the Vertical Area Type tool, it appears
from top to bottom (vertically) inside the path rather than from left to right (hori-
zontally) as it does when using the Path Area Type tool.
The Vertical Path Type tool works similarly to the Path Type tool. Both type tools
create type on a path. However, instead of the type appearing left to right (horizon-
tally) as it does when using the Path Type tool, it appears top to bottom (vertically).
Follow these steps to learn how to use Illustrator’s type tools:
1. Load Adobe Illustrator, if it is not already loaded.
2. Choose File ➪New to create a new document. The New Document dialog box
appears (see Figure 28-2).
Figure 28-2: Adobe Illustrator’s New Document 
dialog box.
3. Set the Artboard Size to 640 × 480pixels (or the frame size that you will be
using in Premiere), set Color Mode to RGB Color, and click OK. A new docu-
ment appears.

616
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
4. Set the Fill color to the desired type color. Double-click either the Fill swatch
in the Tools palette (the top, overlapping square toward the bottom of the Tools
palette) or the Fill swatch in the Color palette (the top, overlapping square at
the top-left side of the Color palette). The Color Picker dialog box appears.
By default, Illustrator uses the Fill color as the type color. If you set the Fill color to
the color you want the text to be, you won’t have to worry about changing it later.
5. Click a color in the Select Color area or on the color slider next to it. If you
are creating a project for the Web, be sure to select the Only Web Colors option.
6. Click OK. The Fill color changes to the newly selected color. If you decide to
change the Fill color, the easiest way to pick a new color is to use the color bar
in the Color palette. To display the Color palette, choose Window ➪Color. In
the Color palette, click a color in the color bar at the bottom of the palette to
change the fill color. To create a new color, move the sliders in the middle of
the palette.
7. To apply a stroke to the text, click the Stroke swatch (which is below the
Fill swatch) and pick a color. Select a color either by using the Color Picker
dialog box — accessed by double-clicking the Stroke swatch in the Tools or
Color palette — or by dragging the sliders and/or color bar in the Color palette.
To set the size of the stroke, click the Weight menu in the Stroke palette and
pick a size. To display the Stroke palette, choose Window ➪Stroke.
8. Set the Fill color to black. Click the Default Fill and Stroke Color icon, which
is below the overlapping Fill and Stroke swatch in the Tools palette. This sets
the Stroke swatch to black and the Fill color to white. Next, click the Swap Fill
and Stroke icon (the curved arrow next to the Fill and Stroke swatch) to set
the Fill to black and the Stroke to white. To use the Illustrator text as a mask
with a video clip run through the shape of the text, you must set the Fill color
to black. Now you are ready to use a Type tool to start creating some type.
9. Select one of the Type tools in Illustrator.
10. Move the cursor to the middle of the document.
11. Click the document and type a word or two.
12. Choose Window ➪Type ➪Character and Window ➪Type ➪Paragraph to
display either the Character or Paragraph palette.
13. Click and drag over the area you want to stylize. You can stylize either an
entire word or a letter or two in the word.
For a more interesting text effect, you can use one of the Effect commands to alter
the text path. Figure 28-3 shows the Effect ➪Distort & Transform ➪Free Distort
command when applied to text.

Converting Illustrator type to path outlines
You may want to convert your Illustrator type into outline paths so that you can
manipulate it further as shown earlier in Figure 28-1. To manipulate path outlines,
click the type path’s anchor points using the Direct Selection tool (the white arrow)
and move the anchor points to alter the type path and the type itself. Essentially,
this enables you to create your own type designs.
When you convert text to outline format, it is no longer considered a font. The out-
line paths now appear as art, not text. So, if you send an Illustrator file to another
person, that person won’t need to have the font on their machine.
Here’s how to convert your type into outline type paths:
1. Create text with one of Illustrator’s type tools.
2. Use the Selection tool to select the type.
3. Choose Type ➪Create Outlines to convert the text from type to art.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Editing path outlines
After you have converted your text into outlines, Illustrator views the text as art (a
path that is in the shape of text). You’ll probably manipulate, distort, or enlarge the
text so that when you import it into Premiere Pro, you can run a video clip through
the text, as shown later in Figure 28-6. Type path outlines are enlarged with the Scale
tool, rotated with the Rotate tool, and moved with the Selection tool. With Adobe
Illustrator 10, type path outlines can be manipulated using the Reflect, Shear, and
Free Transform tools. They can be distorted using the Warp, Reshape, and Twist
tools.
Here’s how to scale, rotate, and move path outlines:
✦Enlarging text. Make sure that the text is selected (use the Selection tool, the
black arrow). To use the Scale dialog box, double-click the Scale tool in the
Toolbox. When the Scale dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 28-4, make
the adjustments you want and click OK to scale the text.
✦Scaling a single letter. Click the outline path of the letter with the Group
Selection Type tool (the white arrow with the plus sign). Next, select the Scale
tool in the Toolbox and click once on your document. Now click and drag on
the letter with the Scale tool selected to scale the letter.
✦Rotating type. Select the path outline of the letter you want to select. Next,
click the Rotate tool in the Toolbox (next to the Scale tool in the Toolbox) and
click in your document. Next, click and drag on the letter to rotate it. If you
want to display the Rotate dialog box, press and hold the Option/Alt key while
you click the text with the Rotate tool.
✦Moving type. Click inside the letter using the Group Selection tool and drag
the letter to where you want to move it. You can also use the arrow keys on
your keyboard to move the letter onscreen. By default, the arrow keys are set
to move in 1-pixel increments. You can change the increments in the Keyboard
Increment section of the Preferences General dialog box. To access this dialog
box, choose Edit ➪Preferences ➪General.
Figure 28-4: The Scale dialog box enables
you to scale paths.

Chapter 28 ✦Using Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Illustrator
Editing with anchor points
Type outlines can be manipulated so that you can create new typefaces. You 
manipulate type path outlines by moving either anchor points or directional lines.
Figure 28-5 shows a type path outline before and after manipulation.
Figure 28-5: Path type outline before and after manipulating.
To move an anchor point, click it with the Direct Selection tool (the white arrow)
and then drag. Illustrator also enables you to move multiple anchor points at one
time. To select more than one anchor point, press and hold the Shift key as you
select anchor points. You can also click and drag over the anchor points you want
to select.
You can also press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move a selected anchor
point. Anchor points move keyboard increments that are set in the General
Preferences dialog box. To display the General Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪
Preferences ➪General.
Editing with directional lines
Curves on a path are created from a curve anchor point. Curve anchor points have
directional lines, which determine the size and arc of your curve. Clicking and drag-
ging a directional line changes the form of the curve.
Tip

620
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Other ways to adjust the type path outline include using the Pen + tool, Pen – tool,
and the Convert tool. Use the Pen + tool to click the path to add an anchor point. This
anchor point can then be manipulated. Clicking an anchor point with the Pen – tool
deletes it. Use the Convert tool to click on a corner anchor point to convert the cor-
ner anchor point to a curve anchor point, and vice versa.
Adobe Illustrator 10 enables you to create some interesting distortions with the
Warp tool. You can convert plain path outlines into interesting and unusual ones.
Using an Illustrator Text Shape 
in a Premiere Pro Project
Earlier in this chapter, you learn how to use Illustrator to create type and then con-
vert the type into type shapes. This section shows you how to use Illustrator’s Type
tool to create text, convert it into a type shape, and then import it into a Premiere
Pro project that uses the text shape as a mask. The Premiere Pro project in this
chapter’s examples features a video clip playing through and behind the Illustrator
text shape. Figure 28-6 shows frames from a Premiere Pro project that has a video
clip running inside and behind an Illustrator text shape.
Figure 28-6: Illustrator text shape used in a Premiere Pro project.

621
Chapter 28 ✦Using Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Illustrator
The following steps show how to create an Illustrator text shape and then import it
into a Premiere Pro project and use it as a mask.
The images shown in Figure 28-6 are on the DVD that accompanies this book. The
images are an “NYC” text shape created in Illustrator, a black-and-white video clip
of New York City from Digital Vision’s CityMix collection (567005f.mov), and a
sound clip from Digital Vision’s City Life/Urban Moods collection (576002s.aif).
1. Load Adobe Illustrator and create a new document. The document should
be the same size as your Premiere Pro project. If you don’t have access to
Adobe Illustrator, skip Steps 1–4.
2. Select one of Illustrator’s type tools.
3. Choose a font and type size.
4. Set the foreground color to black so that the text you create is black. The
black text is used later as a mask in Premiere Pro.
5. Create some text.
To learn about using the different Illustrator type tools, see the section “Working
with Illustrator Type” earlier in this chapter.
6. Manipulate the text in Illustrator. Either choose Effect ➪Distort & Transform
or convert the type into outlines using the Direct Selection tool. To convert the
type into outlines, select it with the Selection tool and choose Type ➪Create
Outlines. Figure 28-7 shows the Illustrator text shape we created for the project
shown in Figure 28-6. We converted the NYC text into outlines and then manip-
ulated the text by using the Direct Selection tool.
7. After you’ve created an Illustrator text shape, save your file in Illustrator
format. Premiere Pro can then read the file information. If you want, you can
quit Adobe Illustrator.
8. Load Premiere Pro and create a new project.
9. Import an Illustrator text shape, a video clip, and a sound clip. Choose File ➪
Import to import the files needed for this project. If you want, you can import
the files we used to create the frames shown in Figure 28-6. You can find them
in the Chapter 28 folder (which is in Tutorial Projects folder) on the DVD 
that accompanies this book. They are NYC.ai and Digital Vision’s video clip
567005f.mov (from CityMix CD-ROM) and the sound clip 576002s.aif from Digital
Vision’s City Life/Urban Moods collection.
10. Drag the video clip to Video track 1, the Illustrator text shape to Video
track 2, and if you want, a sound clip to Audio track 1. If the text shape is not
as long as the video clip, you can click the end of the text shape in the Timeline
window and drag to the right until it’s the same duration as the video clip. (For
more information on basic editing, refer to Chapter 7.) If the sound clip is longer
than the video clip, you can use the Razor tool to cut it. (For more information
on editing sound clips, turn to Chapter 8.)

11. Select the text shape in Video track 2.
12. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects. In the Effects palette, open the Video
Effects folder.
13. Open the Keying folder and drag the Screen Key effect over the text shape
in Video track 2.
14. In the Effect Controls window, use the Screen Key settings to create trans-
parency with the dark areas of the clip in Video track 1. Use the Screen Key
settings to reduce the Opacity so that you can see more of the video clip in
Video track 2. Drag the Cutoff values to the left to make the clip in Video track 1
more transparent and see more of the background. Drag the Cutoff values to
the right to have the video clip in Video track 1 more opaque.
Choosing the Multiply Key Type option results in the opposite effect of the Screen
Key Type option. Using the Key Type option enables you to run the video clip
inside or behind the text shape. For more information on using Key Type effects,
refer to Chapter 15.
15. To soften the edges of the text shape, blur it by using the Gaussian Blur
video effect. To do so, select the text shape in Video track 2. In the Effects
palette, open the Blur & Sharpen folder and drag the Gaussian Blur video
effect over the text shape in Video track 2. The Effect Controls window will
appear onscreen if it is not there already. Drag the Blurriness slider a little to
the right. Figure 28-8 shows all the windows and palettes used to create the
frames for the NYC project.

Creating Masks in Illustrator
The Illustrator drawing capabilities make it the perfect place to create intricate masks
for Premiere Pro. This example shows you how to create a simple shape in Illustrator
that can be used as a mask in Premiere Pro.
Here’s how to create a simple mask:
1. Load Adobe Illustrator, if it isn’t running already.
2. Choose File ➪New to create a new document. In the New Document dialog
box, set the Artboard Size and choose RGB Color for the Color Mode.
3. Select the Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, or Star tools (shown in Figure 28-9)
from the Toolbox.

624
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Figure 28-9: Illustrator’s Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, and Star tools.
4. Click and drag to create a shape or Alt+click to display the tool’s dialog
box. In the dialog box that appears, make your adjustments.
5. Click OK to create the shape. The shapes you create are filled with whatever
the Fill and Stroke colors are in the Toolbox. If you want, you can change the
Fill and Stroke color by double-clicking the Fill or Stroke swatch in the Toolbox.
When the Color Picker appears, make your adjustment and click OK. Figure 28-10
shows the Star dialog box and a star it created.
Experiment with using different fill shades. Filling with black, white, and different
shades of gray and colors will result in different effects in Premiere.
Figure 28-10: The Star dialog box and the star
it created.
6. When you have a shape onscreen, experiment with creating a few different
shapes using one of the Effect commands.
Figure 28-11 shows how we transformed a star shape into a blob shape using
the Effect ➪Distort ➪Roughen dialog box.
Figure 28-12 shows the star transformed into a snowflake using the Effect ➪
Distort & Transform ➪Zig Zag.

Importing an Illustrator File as a Mask
After you know how to use Illustrator to create type and manipulate it into type
shapes, you can import the shapes into Premiere Pro and use them as masks.
Here’s how:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪Project.
2. Choose File ➪Import, locate a video clip, and then click Open. We used
Digital Vision’s Ambient Space 434023f.mov video clip.
Digital Vision’s Ambient Space 434023f.mov clip is located in the Chapter 28
folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.
3. Drag the video clip from the Project window to Video track 2 in the
Timeline window.
4. Click the video clip in Video track 2.
5. Choose Window ➪Workspace ➪Effects to display the Effects window and
Effect Controls window.
6. Drag the Image Matte Key effect from the Effects window to the video clip
in Video track 2. The Image Matte Key Type option is a good choice to use
when you would like a video clip to be seen through an Illustrator image. If
you want, you can reverse the effect by clicking the Reverse check box or by
changing the Composite Using option.
7. Click the Setup button in the Effect Controls window. When the Select a
Matte Image dialog box appears, choose an Illustrator shape file. We used 
the Startwirl.ai file located in the Chapter 28 folder located in the DVD that
accompanies this book. Click Open to view the star in the Monitor window.
Notice that the white areas on the outside of the star don’t show up in the 
preview. Only the black areas show through. The video clip shows through 
the black areas.
You can find the Startwirl.ai file in the Chapter 28 folder on the DVD that accom-
panies this book.
8. Choose File ➪Import to import a clip to appear in the background. Either
import a video clip or a Photoshop or Illustrator file. We imported an Illustrator
file that we created by using the Raindrop RGB Style. This file (surplus.ai) is
on the DVD that accompanies this book. Figure 28-19 shows the surplus back-
ground with the twirl star image matte applied to a video clip.

Creating a Mask Using Photoshop 
and Illustrator
Combining the strengths of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, you can create
elaborate masks. Start by using Photoshop to save a scanned photograph, an image
captured with a digital camera, or a stock image. Then load the file into Illustrator
and use one of the path-creating tools to create a path around the area in the photo
you want to import into Adobe Premiere Pro. In Figure 28-20, we used Illustrator’s
Paintbrush tool to create a path. After the path is in Premiere Pro, you can have a
video clip running in the background, as shown in Figure 28-21.
Here’s how to create a complex mask using both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe
Illustrator:
1. Scan or capture an image into Adobe Photoshop with a scanner, digital
camera, or a digital camcorder.
2. Save the file in either Photoshop or TIFF format. Many photo-finishing labs
can develop your film as well as archive the pictures on a DVD, CD-ROM, or
floppy disk.
Figure 28-20 shows the sample image (girl.psd) we used in this section. If you
want, you can load this image from the Chapter 28 folder on this book’s DVD.

3. Load Adobe Illustrator.
4. Chose File ➪Open. Locate the digitized Photoshop image and open it.
5. Choose Window ➪Show Layers.
6. In the Layers palette, double-click the layer. The Layer Options dialog box
appears (see Figure 28-21).
Figure 28-21: The Layer Options dialog
box enables you to lock and dim a layer.

sure that the Dim option is set to 50%.
8. Click OK for the effects to take place.
9. Click the New Layer menu in the Layers palette to create a new layer. In the
Layer Options dialog box that appears, name the layer and then click OK.
10. Select the Pen, Pencil, or Paintbrush tool.
11. Trace the dimmed image’s outline. If you use the Pen tool, a small circle
appears next to the tool when the starting and finishing points meet. When
this happens, click to close the path, if you want to create a closed path.
Figure 28-22 shows the sample image dimmed in a layer and a few path
strokes created with the Paintbrush in another layer.

632
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Figure 28-22: The dimmed image is in one layer, and the Paintbrush paths are in
another layer.
When you are drawing, it’s easier to see the image you are tracing if you trace
with a stroke and no fill, as shown in Figure 28-23. If you draw with a fill, you
won’t see the image in the layer below. To set the Fill to none, click the Fill
swatch (the top overlapping square) in the Toolbox and then click the third
small square (the one with the dialog line) below the Fill swatch. Click the
Stroke swatch (behind the Fill swatch) and then click the first small square to
set the stroke color to black. Choose Window ➪Stroke to display the Stroke
palette. The Stroke palette enables you to choose the width of your stroke.
12. After you’ve created a few paths, you may want to hide the bottom layer
with the image in it to see how your path strokes are appearing. Click the
eye icon next to the layer you want to hide.
13. After you have a path, fill it with black if you want to use it as a solid mask
in Premiere Pro. You may want to fill the path with a shade of gray to create a
translucent mask.
14. When you finish tracing over the dimmed image, you can delete it. You may,
however, first want to use the File ➪Save As command to duplicate the file.
15. Save your final file in Illustrator format.
16. Load Adobe Premiere Pro and then create a new project.

Working with
Masks in Adobe
After Effects 6.0
M
atte effects are undoubtedly one of the more interest-
ing special effects provided by Adobe Premiere Pro.
In Chapters 15 and 16, you learned how mattes can be used to
hide portions of one video clip in a track behind the masked
area of a shape in another video track.
If you want to create a matte effect in Premiere Pro, one tech-
nique is to create a shape in another program to use as a mask
and import it into Premiere Pro. Although this is a rather
straightforward and simple process, it does not enable you to
create the mask at the same time as previewing the clip with
which it will be used. Nor does it enable you to change the
matte’s shape as the clip runs.
If you need to create sophisticated matte effects, you can 
turn to Adobe After Effects. In After Effects 6.0, you can create
masks using the After Effects Pen tool, edit them, and animate
them over time. You can also import Adobe Illustrator and
Adobe Photoshop files into After Effects to be used as masks.
After Effects also enables you to import Illustrator and
Photoshop paths or Photoshop alpha channels to be used 
as masks.
This chapter looks at Adobe After Effects’ masking options. It
also discusses the features that Premiere Pro lacks but which
you still may want to use to add interesting and unusual matte
effects to Premiere Pro. To do this, you can import a Premiere
Pro project into After Effects and use After Effects’ masking
capabilities to add pizzazz to your clips.

After Effects Masks: An Overview
In Adobe After Effects 6.0, you can load a video clip or an entire Premiere Pro project
into After Effects and isolate an area by using a mask so that the viewer only sees a
portion of the video clip or project. In After Effects 6.0, masks can be created using
paths. A path is similar to a wireframe line onscreen that can be used to create any-
thing from shapes with sharp corners to flowing waves created from perfect curves.
After Effects 6.0 allows you to create four types of masks: Rectangular, Elliptical, and
RotoBézier. To create a rectangular-shaped mask, use the Rectangular Mask tool in
the Tools palette. To create an elliptical-shaped mask, use the Elliptical Mask tool in
the Tools palette. If you are creating any other shaped mask, you work with either a
Bézier or RotoBézier mask. To create a Bézier mask, you can use the Pen tool, which
is found in the Tools palette. Note that when you use the Pen tool in After Effect’s 6.0,
you can also click the RotoBézier option. The RotoBézier option enables you to more
easily create curves. 
The Pen tool in After Effects is quite similar to the Pen tool in Adobe Illustrator and
Adobe Photoshop. You can edit the path using the Pen +, Pen –, and Convert tools.
All of these tools reside in the same location in the Toolbox as the Pen tool. You can
use the Selection tool (arrow tool) in the Tools palette to edit a point on the path by
clicking the point and dragging it to the position you want. If you double-click the
path with the Selection tool, you can move, scale, or rotate the path as a whole. The
effects of a mask are displayed in the Composition window. Masks are edited in
either the Composition or the Layer window. Masks can be altered over time by
using the Timeline window.
Creating Oval and Rectangle Masks
You can have a lot of fun creating interesting effects with masks. Figure 29-1 shows
a frame with a video clip before applying a rectangular mask. Figure 29-2 shows the
same frame after an oval mask was used on the video clip’s perimeter. We then placed
a still image in the background. For an added effect, we applied the Twirl command
(Effect ➪Distort ➪Twirl) to the background still image.

before using a mask.

637
Chapter 29 ✦Working with Masks in Adobe After Effects 6.0
Figure 29-2: An After Effects frame
created using an oval mask.
Here’s how to create an oval or rectangle mask in After Effects:
1. Load After Effects.
2. Choose File ➪New ➪New Project to create a new project.
3. Choose Composition ➪New Composition to create a new composition.
4. In the New Composition dialog box, set the frame size. To create the frame
shown in Figure 29-1, we set the width and height frame to NTSC, 640 × 480
pixels, and imported a video clip that was 160 × 120. That way, we had plenty
of room to see the background beneath the video clip.
5. Choose File ➪Import ➪File.
6. In the Import File dialog box, select a file that you want to mask and then
set the Import As menu to Footage. You can use one of the video clips found
on the DVD that accompanies this book. The video clip used in Figure 29-1 
is called sailboat.mov and is found in the Chapter 29 folder on the DVD that
accompanies the book. Also in the Chapter 29 folder is a video clip from Digital
Vision that you can use. The Digital Vision clip is from the CityMix CD-ROM
(576004p.mov).
7. Click Import to import a video clip you want to mask. The imported video
clip appears in the Project window.
8. Choose File ➪Import ➪File to import another video clip to use in the back-
ground or import a still image to use as the background. You’ll be better able
to view the effect of the mask. Locate the still image or video clip that you want
to import. 
When creating a mask in After Effects 6.0 for the first time, you may want to use
just a simple video clip for the mask and a still image as the background. If you
want, you can use the video clip of the sailboat.mov and the shapes.psd we used
in this section. The sailboat.mov video clip and the shapes.psd still image are
found in the Chapter 29 folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.

If desired, you can create your own background using the After Effects 6.0’s new
Brush tool. To use the Brush tool, start by choosing Layer➪New➪Solid. In the Solid
Footage Settings dialog box, name the solid and set the presets. Then click OK.
When the solid appears in the Timeline window, double-click it to display the solid
in the Layer window. Then select the Brush from the Tools palette and begin paint-
ing. Use the Paint palette to change the painting color and brush size.
9. To apply an effect to the background, choose a command from the Effect
menu. In Figure 29-2, we applied the Effect ➪Distort ➪Twirl command. Next 
to the triangle in front of the background clip is the lock column. Click it so
that the background clip will not be affected when you begin to work with the
video clip you will be masking.
10. Click and drag the imported video clip that you will mask to the middle 
of the Composition window. Not only does the video clip appear in the
Composition window, but it also appears in the Timeline window.
11. Click and drag the imported background clip from the Project window to
the Timeline window. Make sure that you place the image or clip beneath the
video clip that has the mask. If it isn’t, click and drag it in the Timeline window
and place it below the video clip that you will mask.
12. Select the video clip in the Timeline window.
13. Click the triangle in front of the name of the video clip to display its options.
Notice that presently there is not a Mask option available.
14. To add a mask the shape of the selected video clip, choose Layer ➪Mask ➪
New Mask. 
You can use the Rectangular Mask tool in the Tools palette to create a rectangular-
shaped mask. To create an elliptical-shaped mask, use the Elliptical Mask tool in

19. Save your file by choosing File ➪Save.
If you want, you can continue editing the mask. The mask can be edited by
using the Mask 1 options. For more information on editing a mask, proceed 
to the next section.
Figure 29-3: The Mask Shape dialog box enables
you to pick a shape for your mask.
Editing a Mask with the Layer Window, 
Layer Menu, and Timeline Window 
After you’ve created a mask, you can use the Layer menu and the Layer window,
along with the Selection tool in the Tools palette, to edit the mask. You can also 
edit a mask by using the Mask options in the Timeline window. Here are a few 
mask-editing tips:
✦To edit the mask, the mask must be selected. If the mask isn’t selected, you
can select it by double-clicking the name of the clip you are working on in the
Timeline window. In the Layer window that appears, click the path to select it.
You can also select a mask by clicking it in the Timeline window. 
✦The mask can be edited in the Layer window or the Composition window.
If you change the path in the Layer window, you’ll be able to see the effect of
the mask on the video clip in the Composition window. Figure 29-4 shows the
path and the mask in the Layer window. 
✦A mask can be edited by using the Mask options in the Timeline window.
In the Timeline window, click the triangle in front of the clip with the mask
that you want to edit. When the masks for that clip appear, click the triangle 
in front of the Mask that you want to edit. The mask options allow you to
invert the mask, edit the shape, change the opacity, or expand the mask. It
also allows you to soften the edges of the mask.

Figure 29-4: The Layer window shows the
mask as a path.
Here’s how to edit a mask:
1. Start by selecting the Mask in the Timeline window that you want to edit.
The mask should be displayed in the Composition window.
2. With the mask selected in the Timeline window, you can choose Layer ➪
Mask ➪Free Transform Points to transform the mask. Notice that in the
Composition window, the mask appears with a bounding box with handles
around it. In the Composition window, click and drag on one of the handles to
increase or decrease the size of the mask. Move the mouse over one of the han-
dles and wait for the cursor to change to a curved line with arrows at either
end. Then drag in the direction you want to rotate the mask. To activate the
changes, double-click inside the mask shape in the Composition window. 
If you want to cancel the changes you made to your mask, choose Layer ➪Mask ➪
Reset Mask to reset the mask to its original state. If desired, you can remove the
mask by choosing Layer➪Mask➪Remove Mask and then choosing Layer➪Mask➪
New Mask to create a new mask and start over again.
3. To resize a mask using the Selection tool, choose the Selection tool from 
the Tools palette. Then click and drag one of the four corners of the mask
in either the Composition or Layer window. To display the mask in the Layer
window, double-click the clip in the Timeline window. To keep the proportions
of the mask as you change the size of the mask, press and hold the Shift key as
you drag. 
4. To increase or decrease the expansion of a mask, click and drag the Mask
Expansion values. The Mask Expansion values are found in the Timeline win-
dow in the Mask section of the selected video clip.
5. To change the shape of a mask, use the Layer➪Mask➪Mask Shape command
or the Mask Shape option in the Timeline window.

6. To display the mask’s path in the Layer window, double-click the video clip’s
name in the Timeline window or double-click inside the mask. The mask
appears as a path in the Layer window. To display the anchor points, you may
need to click the path with the Selection tool found in the Tools palette.
7. To edit the path, click an anchor point (shown in Figure 29-5) using 
the Selection tool. Then press an arrow key on your keyboard to move the
anchor point up, down, or to the right or left. As you edit the path, the mask
in the Composition window is affected. Clicking and moving the directional
line in the oval path changes the shape of the curve.
Figure 29-5: You can edit an oval path by moving
anchor points and directional lines.
8. To display the mask’s path in the Composition window, double-click Comp
1 in the Project window. Click on the mask with the Selection tool to select it. 
9. Click and drag inside the mask with the Selection tool to move the mask.
Click the edge of the mask to display the path of the mask. 
10. With the Selection tool, click either an anchor point or directional line to
edit the path.
11. With the mask in the Timeline window, change the opacity of the mask by
choosing Layer ➪Mask ➪Opacity. In the Opacity dialog box, set the opacity
you want. Click OK and notice the change in the Composition window. You
can also change the opacity of a mask by using the Mask Opacity option in the
Timeline window.
12. To soften your mask’s edges, you can apply a feather by choosing Layer ➪
Mask ➪Mask Feather. In the Feather Mask dialog box, type a small value to
create a small feather. A large value results in a large feather. You can also
feather a mask by using the Mask Feather option in the Timeline window.
13. To adjust the colors of the clip, you can use any of the Effect ➪Adjust com-
mands or the Effect ➪Image Control commands. Once you apply a command,
use the Effect Controls window to adjust the controls for that command.

14. To stroke the mask, choose Effect ➪Render ➪Stroke. Use the Effect Controls
window to set the stroke color, width, and opacity. You can also set a fill color
by choosing Effect ➪Render ➪Fill. Again, use the Effect Controls window to
set the fill color and opacity and to use a fill mask. 
15. Choose Effect ➪Perspective ➪Basic 3D to swivel and tilt the mask in 
360 degrees. To apply a shadow to the mask, choose Effect ➪Perspective ➪
Drop Shadow or Radial Shadow. To apply a bevel to the mask, choose 
Effect ➪Perspective ➪Bevel Alpha or Bevel Edges. The controls for the
Perspective commands can be adjusted using the Effect Controls window.
16. Use the Effect ➪Distort ➪Bezier Warp command to warp the mask using
Beziers. Use the Beziers and the controls in the Effect Controls window to
adjust the warp.
17. To invert the mask (reverse the effect of the mask), choose Layer ➪Mask ➪
Inverse. To bring the mask back to the state it was before you inverted it,
choose Layer ➪Mask ➪Inverse.
18. To change how the mask is displayed over the background, choose Layer ➪
Mask ➪Mode and then choose a mode. By default, the mode is set to Add.
Creating a Bézier Mask
The Pen tools used in programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Macromedia
Freehand, and CorelDRAW provide digital artists with the power to draw virtually
any shape imaginable. The After Effects Pen tool provides similar power — except
instead of using the Pen tool to create works of art, After Effects users can use the
Pen tool to create masks.
Figure 29-6 shows the first frame of a video clip without a Bézier mask. Figure 29-7
shows the same frame with a Bézier mask applied to the chipmunk in the clip. In
order to isolate the chipmunk from the background, we used a Bézier mask —
because using an oval or rectangle obviously wouldn’t provide the desired effect.
After we isolated the chipmunk from its background by applying the mask, we added
a background still image. To make the background image more interesting, we applied
the Effect ➪Stylize ➪Mosaic command. Finally, we added type on a path by using
the After Effects Effect ➪Text ➪Path Text command.
To use the After Effects Path Text command, you first need to create a New Solid
(Layer ➪New Solid). For more information on creating and animating text in After
Effects, turn to Chapter 30.

5. Drag the video clip to the middle of the Composition window. The video clip
not only appears in the Composition window, but it also appears in the Timeline
window. Notice that the current-time indicator is at the beginning of the clip.
Any changes you make to the clip will affect only where the current-time indi-
cator is positioned.
6. Double-click the video clip’s name in the Timeline window to display the
video clip in the Layer window.
7. Select the Pen tool in the Tools palette. After you have selected the Pen
tool, you can click RotoBézier option in the Tools palette. The RotoBézier
option facilitates making Bézier paths that contain many curves.
8. Create a path around the image. Click in the image you want to isolate. Keep
clicking the perimeter of the image with the Pen tool to create a path around
the image. When the first and last points meet, a tiny circle appears next to the
Pen icon. Click the mouse to close the path. As you create a Bézier path in the
Layer window, the effect of the mask appears in the Composition window.

If you find the Pen tool difficult to use, you can start by using the Elliptical Mask
tool or Rectangular Mask tool to create a path and then use the Pen and Selection
tools to edit the path.
9. To see the effects of the mask over a background, choose File ➪Import ➪
File to import a file. Import either a still image or video clip to use as the
background. In the Import File dialog box, locate a file and click Open. In
Figure 29-9, we used the file 12squares.psd as the background. This file is
located in the Chapter 29 folder in the DVD that accompanies the Adobe
Premiere Pro Bible.
10. When the background clip appears in the Project window, drag it below the
clip in the Timeline window. To make the background image more interesting,
we applied the Effect ➪Stylize ➪Mosaic command. To lock the background so
that it doesn’t move, click the Lock column (next to the triangle icon) in the
Timeline window.
11. To see a preview of your work, choose Composition ➪Preview ➪RAM

12. To add text on a path, choose Layer ➪New ➪Text and then choose Effect ➪
Text ➪Path Text. In the Path Text dialog box that appears, type Chipmunk
Software.
Use the Font pop-up menu to choose a font. Click OK to apply the text to your
project. Use the Effect Controls window to edit the path text. To have the text
appear around a circle, click the Shape Type pop-up menu in the Effect Controls
window and choose Circle. Notice that when you work with text in After Effects,
a new layer is created in the Timeline window.
To add horizontal text to your project, click the Horizontal Type tool in the Tools
palette. Next move the cursor to the Composition window and then click the
mouse button and begin typing. Use the Character palette to change the font and
font size. To convert horizontal type into a path outline, select the type with the
Selection tool. Then choose Layer ➪Create Outlines. The path outline of the text
can be edited with the Selection tool. The path outline can also be used as a mask.
13. Save your file by choosing File ➪Save.

Editing paths with the Pen tool
You can edit a path in After Effects 6.0 by using the Selection tool to select an anchor point
and move it, or you can click on a directional line with the Selection tool to change the
shape of a curve. You can use the Convert tool, which is found in the same location as the
Pen tool, to convert a curve to a corner point, or vice versa. If you need more anchor points,
select the Pen + tool and click the path to add a point at that location. To omit a point, click
it with the Pen tool.

Animating a Mask with the Timeline Window
You can edit a mask’s shape, location, feather, and opacity over various time inter-
vals using After Effects Timeline window, Composition window, and Layer window.
Figure 29-10 shows the effects of animating a mask at different points in time. Notice
that the mask shape changes as the video progresses. 
Figure 29-10: The frames show that the mask shape changes over time.
To use the Timeline window to edit a mask over time, follow these steps.
Before you begin, you should have a clip in the Timeline window. That clip should
also have a mask.
1. Click the triangle next to the video clip’s name in the Timeline window.
2. Click the triangle in front of the word Masks to display the mask.
3. Click the triangle in front of the mask you want to edit to show the mask
options. The Mask options are as follows:
• Mask Shape. Allows you to set the shape to either Rectangle, Oval, or
Bézier.
• Mask Feather. Allows you to apply a horizontal or vertical feather to the
edges of a mask.
• Mask Opacity. Allows you to change the opacity. To make the mask
translucent, set the Opacity to less than 100%.
Note

Chapter 29 ✦Working with Masks in Adobe After Effects 6.0
• Mask Expansion. Allows you to expand the mask using pixels values. 
• Mask mode. By default the mode is set to Add. (Next to the modes, After
Effects provides an area that you can click if you want to invert the mask.) 
4. Move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the clip in the Timeline
window.
5. Click the stopwatch next to the mask option that you want to animate. In
Figure 29-10, we changed the mask’s shape so that it would follow the chipmunk
as it moved over time. To animate the mask shape, click the stopwatch in front
of Mask Shape. Notice that a keyframe is created in the Timeline window. To
animate a mask, you need to create keyframes. 
6. To create another keyframe, move the current-time indicator over to the
right just a bit. Then edit the mask shape. To follow an image the way we 
did in Figure 29-10, you need to move and edit the mask path in either the
Composition or Layer window using either the Selection or Pen tool. 
7. When you’ve finished editing the mask path in the current-time location,
move the current-time indicator again to the right.
8. Again edit the mask shape. As you edit the mask shape, notice that another
keyframe is created. Continue moving the current-time indicator and editing the
mask until you’ve reached the end of the clip in the Timeline window. You can
also edit a mask option from a point other than the beginning. For Figure 29-10,
we started editing the opacity at the middle of the Timeline.
Follow these steps to edit the opacity of a mask: 
1. Move the current-time indicator to the beginning of the clip in the Timeline
window.
2. Click the stopwatch in front of the Opacity option. Notice that a keyframe is
created. A keyframe is created with the Opacity’s default settings, 100%.
3. Move the current-time indicator to the middle of the clip in the Timeline
window.
4. Change the mask opacity option by clicking and dragging on the Mask
Opacity value in the Timeline window. Note that you can also use the Mask
Opacity command (Layer ➪Mask ➪Mask Opacity). When the Mask Opacity
dialog box appears, type a number and click OK. In Figure 29-10, we changed
the Opacity setting to 50%.
5. Preview the project by choosing Composition ➪Preview ➪RAM Preview.
When the current-time indicator reaches the keyframe in the middle of the
Timeline, the opacity changes to the value you entered in Step 4.
6. Make the opacity (mask option) gradually change from the middle of the
clip to the end of the clip. Move the current-time indicator to the end of the
clip. Next, set the desired opacity option.

Importing Masks from Illustrator 
or Photoshop
You can import a black-and-white Illustrator or Photoshop file into After Effects to
use as a mask. The Illustrator or Photoshop file can be used to isolate areas in a video
clip, as shown in Figure 29-11. Figure 29-12 shows the black-and-white Illustrator file
used as a mask.
Figure 29-11: The effect of an Illustrator
file used as a mask on a video clip in
After Effects.
Figure 29-12: The black-and-white
Illustrator file used as a mask.
Here’s how to use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create a mask in After
Effects:
1. In Adobe Illustrator 10, create a shape using the Rectangle, Oval, Star, or
Polygon tool. Fill the shape with black. To distort the shape, use the Warp
tool. Apply a filter or effect to the shape to create a more interesting shape.
Do not rasterize the shape. When you are done creating the shape, choose 
File ➪Save. In the Save dialog box, set the Save as type pop-up menu to
Illustrator, and click Save.

649
Chapter 29 ✦Working with Masks in Adobe After Effects 6.0
2. In Adobe Photoshop 7.0, Choose File ➪New to create a new file. In the New
dialog box, choose a preset, set the Mode to RGB Color, and make the back-
ground transparent. Click OK to create a new file. 
In Photoshop, you can use various tools to create a shape. Try using the
Brush tool or the Custom Shape tool. Before using one of these tools, set the
Foreground color in the Toolbox to black. Then pick a brush size and shape.
You can also use the Lasso tool to create a selection. 
After you’ve created the selection, fill it with black by choosing Edit ➪Fill. In
the Fill dialog box, set Use pop-up menu to Black, the Mode to Normal, and the
Opacity to 100%. The Preserve Transparency option should not be selected.
Click OK. To deselect the selection, choose Select ➪Deselect. 
To create a more unusual shape, you can apply one of Photoshop’s filters.
After you’ve created a shape, choose File ➪Save. In the Save dialog box, set
the Format pop-up menu to Photoshop and click Save.
3. After you have created a black shape in Adobe Illustrator or Adobe
Photoshop, load After Effects and create a new project by choosing File ➪
New ➪Project and a new composition by choosing Composition ➪New
Composition. When importing the Adobe Photoshop file, make sure to 
choose a shape or layer from the Choose Layer pop-up menu that appears.
4. Import the Photoshop or Illustrator file, as well as a video clip, into the 
project by choosing File ➪Import ➪Multiple Files.
In the Chapter 29 folder on the DVD that accompanies this book, you will find
Photoshop shape files (puzzle.psd and balloon.psd) and Illustrator shape files
(starfish.ai and roughen.ai). In the Digital Vision folder in the Chapter 29 folder is
a video clip from Digital Vision that you can use. The Digital Vision clip is from
Digital Vision’s CityMix CD-ROM (567004f.mov). 
5. Drag the video clip from the Project window to the middle of the
Composition window.
6. Drag the Photoshop or Illustrator black-and-white file below the video clip
in the Timeline window.
7. Click the Mode column that appears next to the file’s name in the Timeline
window. Click either the Lighten or Darken mode. (In Figure 29-11 the Lighten
mode was used to lighten the dark areas.) The light (white) areas are not
affected; only the dark areas (black areas) are. If you use the Darken mode,
the dark area (black) in the image is not affected, but the light (white) area is
affected. 
Experiment with the other modes, such as Overlay, Difference, and Saturation.
If you have various layers in your project, you may want to set a Track Matte.
The Track Matte column is next to the Mode column in the Timeline window.

Using Illustrator Paths as Masks
Hardcore Adobe Illustrator users will most likely prefer to create their masks in
Illustrator, which provides more path-editing commands than does After Effects.
Fortunately, importing an Illustrator file into After Effects is a simple copy-and-
paste operation. Here are the steps:
1. In Illustrator, select the path and all of its anchor points and then choose
Edit ➪Copy.
2. Switch to After Effects, open the Layer window for the target layer, and
then choose Edit ➪Paste.
Summary
Although Adobe Premiere Pro provides numerous matting effects, it does not enable
you to create sophisticated masks or edit masks over time as you can in Adobe After
Effects.
✦After Effects 6.0 enables you to create oval, rectangle, and Bézier masks.
✦In After Effects 6.0, you can edit masks in both the Layer and Composition
window using the Pen tool and the Selection tool and by using the commands
in the Layer menu.
✦After Effects masks can be edited over time using the Timeline window.

Adding Special
Effects in Adobe
After Effects
A
lthough Adobe Premiere Pro is packed with powerful
video effects, at times you may want to create compos-
ite motion or text effects that may not be possible within the
confines of Premiere Pro’s menus and windows. If your project
requires a bit more pizzazz than Premiere Pro seems able to
produce, consider using Adobe After Effects 6.0.
After Effects 6.0 can create dozens of effects that aren’t possi-
ble in Premiere Pro. For example, you can fine-tune a motion
path’s shape as you would a curve in Adobe Illustrator or
Photoshop. You can also rotate text 360 degrees along a curve
over time. After Effects enables you to run multiple clips
simultaneously in the video frame — creating a three-ring 
circus of video effects.
This chapter’s goal is not to persuade you to use After Effects
over Premiere Pro, but to show you how the two can work
together to create the ultimate video production. Both pro-
grams have their strengths, and you can use this to your
advantage.
How After Effects Works
After Effects 6.0 combines some of the features of Photoshop
7.0 and Premiere Pro. To start a project in After Effects, first
create a new composition. A composition determines the type
of movie you will be creating. In the Composition Settings dia-
log box, you pick your settings for width, height, and frame

rate. Then you import all the images, sounds, titles, and video clips you need to 
create your video production. Like Premiere Pro, After Effects stores all of these
imported items in a Project window. As you need footage items, you drag them from
the Project window into the Timeline window. Unlike Premiere Pro, the items in the
Timeline window are not stored in video or sound tracks. Video and sound clips
don’t appear in different tracks; instead, they are organized as layers. In this way,
Adobe After Effects works like Adobe Photoshop. In both programs, you also can
apply transformations (scale, rotate, and so on), effects, and masks to the layers.
Adobe After Effects, however, enables you to animate the transformation, effects,
and masks over time; in Adobe Photoshop, each layer’s properties remain static.
If you import a Photoshop file into Adobe ImageReady, you can make animation
frames from your layers and output the file as a QuickTime movie. See Chapter 12
for an example of how to do this.
Importing Premiere Pro Projects
You can import an entire Premiere Pro project along with its transitions and effects
directly into After Effects to take advantage of the program’s powerful features, such
as animating transformations and masks over time.
Follow these steps to import a Premiere Pro project into After Effects 6.0:
1. In After Effects, choose File ➪Import ➪File. The Import File dialog box
appears.
2. Select the Premiere Pro project you want to import and set the Import As
menu to Composition.
3. Click Import. After Effects 6.0 imports the Premiere Pro project. The video
and sound tracks now appear as layers in the Timeline window. The first layer
in the Timeline window is the first video or sound track that appears in the
Premiere Pro Timeline window.
4. If needed, you can now click a layer and animate it over time, using either
one of the Effect commands, one of the Layer ➪Mask commands, and/or
one of the Transform options in the Timeline window. These options can be
animated over time using keyframes — similar to the way Premiere Pro uses
keyframes with video effects.
Not only can you import a Premiere Pro project into After Effects, but also you can
output your Premiere Pro project as a QuickTime movie and then import the
QuickTime movie into After Effects by choosing File ➪Import ➪File (for older ver-
sions of Premiere, choose Footage File). In the Import File dialog box, select a
QuickTime movie to import. Set the Import As pop-up menu to Footage. Then
choose Import to import the movie into After Effects.

Importing and Animating Photoshop Files
To animate a Photoshop file in After Effects, you can either create a folder and
place all the Photoshop files in it and import it as a Photoshop Sequence or import
a Photoshop file with layers like the one shown in Figure 30-1. When you import a
Photoshop file with layers as a composition, a folder is created in the Project win-
dow with the layers inside the folder.
Figure 30-1: “It’s a Party” file in Photoshop with its layers.
Here’s how to import a Photoshop file with layers into an After Effects project:
1. Create a Photoshop file that has layers, as the image in Figure 30-1 does, and
save it in Photoshop format. Follow these steps to create layers in Photoshop:
a. Load Photoshop.
b. Choose File ➪New to create a new file.
c. In the New dialog box, set the width and height to the size you want
your After Effects movie to be.
d. Set the Mode to RGB Color and the Contents to Transparent.
e. Create a background with the painting tools and filters. You can also
scan or digitize one with a digital camcorder.
f. Click the Create New Layer icon in the Layers palette or choose New
Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu. To open the Layers palette,
choose Window ➪Show Layers.

654
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
g. Create an image in the new layer. You could also copy and paste a digi-
tal image into a new layer. If you want, you can copy the Clown.psd file
that is in the Chapter 30 folder in the DVD that accompanies the book.
h. Create another new layer. Keep creating layers until you have all the
layers needed. If you want, you can also use Photoshop’s Horizontal 
Type tool to create text in a layer.
i. Save the file in Photoshop format.
2. Quit Photoshop and load After Effects.
3. In After Effects, choose File ➪New ➪New Project. The Project window
appears.
4. Choose File ➪Import ➪File. The Import File dialog box appears.
5. Locate the Photoshop file you want to import. Set the Import As pop-up
menu to Composition.
6. Click Open. In the Project window, folder and composition icons appear in the
Project window (see Figure 30-2). You can find the Photoshop file (Party.psd)
shown in Figure 30-2 on the DVD that accompanies the book.
• To see the Photoshop layers, either double-click the folder or click the
triangle.
• To view the layers in the Composition window and Timeline window,
double-click the composition icon, which is in the Comp folder that is
in the Project window. Notice that the layers appear in the Composition
window and the Timeline window. The layers also appear in the Timeline
window in the same order as they did in Photoshop’s Layers palette. You
don’t have to drag each layer to the Timeline window. After Effects auto-
matically places them there.
• To decrease or increase the view of the Composition window, choose
Zoom out or Zoom in from the View menu.
To import various Photoshop files as a sequence, create a folder and place the
Photoshop files in the folder. Then, in After Effects, choose File ➪Import ➪Multiple
Files. When the Import Multiple Files dialog box appears, click the first Photoshop
file of the sequence; then click the Photoshop Sequence option and click Open.
Continue to select files, select the Photoshop Sequence option, and click Open
until you have selected all the files. When you are finished, click Done.
After importing a Photoshop file, you can animate its layers. When you animate a
layer, you either transform it (scale, rotate, or change opacity and/or position),

Importing and Animating Illustrator Files
In this section, you learn how to import an Illustrator file with layers into After Effects
and animate it. We used this technique to create a project filled with butterflies.
Here’s how to import an Illustrator file with layers into After Effects:
1. Using Illustrator, create a file with layers, like the one shown in Figure 30-3,
and save it in Illustrator format. Here is a summary of the steps:
a. Load Illustrator.
b. Choose File ➪New to create a new file. In the New dialog box, name the
file and then set the Color mode to RGB Color.

657
Chapter 30 ✦Adding Special Effects in Adobe After Effects
c. Set the artboard width and height to your After Effects project size
pixel dimensions.
d. To create the Butterfly project, click the Paintbrush tool in the toolbox.
e. Choose Window ➪Brush Libraries ➪Animal Shapes.
f. Click the butterfly shape.
g. Click in the artboard area to create a butterfly. Click again and again.
h. Choose Window ➪Layers to open the Layers palette.
i. To create a new layer, click the Create New Layer icon in the Layers
palette or choose New Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
j. In the new layer, click the artboard to create a butterfly in the new
layer. Then create another new layer and create another butterfly.
Repeat the process until you have nine layers with butterflies, as shown
in Figure 30-3.
k. Create another new layer. This should be your tenth layer. In this layer
use the Pencil tool to create a curve.
l. Create some type using the Path Type tool. We typed “Summer time
brings butterflies” for the image in Figure 30-3.
m. Save your file in Illustrator format.
Figure 30-3: The Butterfly project as seen in Adobe Illustrator.

Creating and Animating 
Type Using After Effects
In After Effects 6.0, you create type either by directly using the Horizontal Type tool
in the Composition window or by choosing Layer ➪New ➪Text. After Effects recog-
nizes three different types of text: Basic Text, Numbers, and Path Text. When you
select the Basic Text option, you can create horizontal or vertical text. You can also
use the Basic Text option to animate one letter of a word at a time. The Numbers
option enables you to create numbers. Path Text creates text on a path.
Because you cannot create type on a path or around a circle in Premiere Pro, the
following example covers creating path type. Figure 30-5 shows a frame from the
Path Type project along with the Composition window. We used the Rotate option,
found in the Timeline window, to animate text around the curve to create the text in
this example. 
Following the Path Type project example, there is an example on how to animate
horizontal text using After Effects 6.0’s new Animate Text command.
Figure 30-5: A frame from the Path Type project 
shown in the Composition window.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Follow these steps to create and animate path text in After Effects:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪New Project. Instantly, the Project window appears.
2. Choose Composition ➪New Composition. The Composition Settings dialog
box appears (see Figure 30-6).
Figure 30-6: The Composition Settings dialog box.
3. Name your composition and then choose the width and height that you’ll
be using.
4. Click OK to create a new composition and to display the Timeline window.
If you want to change the settings in the composition, choose Composition ➪
Composition Settings.
5. To import a background clip, choose File ➪Import ➪File to import a file
that will work as a background for the path text. 
To create your own background, you need to create a new solid layer.
6. Choose Layer ➪New ➪Solid. When the Solid Footage Settings dialog box
appears (see Figure 30-7), type a name for your layer in the Solid Footage
Settings dialog box. Leave the width and height alone and click OK to create
a new solid. (Usually the width and height are the same as the composition.) 
Notice that a new solid layer appears in the Timeline window. The new solid
layer also takes up the entire size of the Composition window. After creating a
new solid layer, you can apply different effects. We applied the Effect ➪PS Tiles
command and the Effect ➪Stylize ➪Mosaic command to create a background
for our project.

Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
Working with Motion Paths
After Effects provides more control of motion effects than does Premiere Pro. In After
Effects, you can create motion along a path by moving an object along the object’s
anchor point. When moving an object along its anchor point, you are essentially
using a path similar to Illustrator and Photoshop paths. Figure 30-10 shows a butter-
fly that’s been animated in After Effects using its anchor point. Notice that the path
is visible in the Layer window.
For more information on using the Motion controls in Premiere Pro, refer to
Chapter 17.
Figure 30-10: In the Layer window, you can see a motion path created.
Animating with anchor points
Here’s how to animate an object in After Effects using its anchor point:
1. Load or create a new project in After Effects.
2. Import a Photoshop or Illustrator object. If you want, use the butterflies.ai
file from the companion DVD’s Chapter 30 folder. When importing the file, be
sure to select Composition from the Import As pop-up menu in the Import File
dialog box. That way, all the layers from the file will be imported.

11. Move the current-time indicator to a new position in the Timeline and then
move the circle again to start creating the motion path. Continue moving the
current-time indicator and move the circle in succession until you’ve finished
creating your motion path. To edit the motion path, you can move the layer
keyframe, direction handles, or direction lines.
Depending upon the path you’ve created, you may want to use the Layer ➪
Transform ➪Auto-Orient Rotation command. The Auto-Orient Rotation com-
mand enables you to rotate an object along a path so that the object is facing
a different direction.
12. Preview the motion you just created. You can choose one of three commands:
• Composition ➪Preview ➪Motion with Trails (fastest)
• Composition ➪Preview ➪Wireframe Preview
• Composition ➪Preview ➪RAM Preview (slowest)

Creating a Composite Video Clip
You can use After Effects to create a composite video clip. A composite video clip
consists of a few video clips displayed side by side on the screen at the same time,
as shown in Figure 30-12. To create the Venice project illustrated in Figure 30-12, we
placed two video clips side by side and then added some text below the two clips. If
your project called for it, you could have three or four video clips. The video clips
that you use to create a composite clip can be Premiere Pro projects, video captured
from your digital camcorder, or even stock video clips.
Figure 30-12: The first frame from the Venice project is an example 
of a composite clip.
Here’s how to create a composite video clip in After Effects:
1. Choose File ➪New ➪New Project. 
2. Choose Composition ➪New Composition. The Composition Settings dialog
box appears.
3. In the Composition Settings dialog box, name your composition. Pick the
correct frame size for your project’s width and height.
4. Click OK to create a new composition.
5. Choose File ➪Import ➪Multiple Files. The Import Multiple File dialog box
appears.

668
Part VI ✦Premiere Pro and Beyond
6. In the Import File dialog box, set Import As option to Footage.
7. Select the video clips and then click Import. If you want, you can use the
clips shown in Figure 30-12 (gondola.mov and cruising.mov), which are found
in the Chapter 30 folder on the DVD that accompanies this book.
8. Drag the video clips you imported from the Project window to the
Composite window. If you want your composite to appear as it does in Figure
30-12, place the video clips so that they are diagonally across from each other.
You can also place two clips side by side or on top of each other on the left
side of the Composition window and place text to the right of the video clips.
You can also fill the Composite window with video clips and have no text.
9. If you want your composite to include text, as shown in Figure 30-12, first
create a new text layer. To create a text layer, first click the Composite win-
dow to activate the layer. Choose Layer ➪New ➪Text.
10. With the new text layer onscreen, type the text and pick a font. As you type,
notice that in the Timelinewindow, the Type layer is selected.
11. Use the Character window to edit your text.
12. To bevel and add a drop shadow to your text, choose Effect ➪Perspective ➪
Bevel Alpha, and Effect ➪Perspective ➪Drop Shadow.
13. To create the background that appears behind the text, as shown in Figure
30-12, you first need to create another solid layer. Choose Layer ➪New ➪
Solid. In the Solid Footage Settings dialog box, click the Eyedropper tool and
pick a color from one of the video clips. This is the color that appears in the
solid. Leave the other settings as they are. If you want, name the solid. Click
OK to create the new solid. When the new solid appears in the Timeline win-
dow, it appears in front of the text you just created. If you want to create a
special effect for the background, use one of the commands found in the
Effect menu. We used the Effect ➪Noise ➪Fractal Noise command.
14. To see the text, click the new solid layer in the Timeline window and drag
it below the text. Figure 30-13 shows the Timeline windows for the Venice
composite project.
15. Choose File ➪Save to save your work.

Licensing
QuickTime
I
f you plan to distribute a Premiere Pro movie on a CD-ROM
as a QuickTime movie, you probably want to include
QuickTime along with your production on the CD. Because
QuickTime is available at no charge from Apple’s Web site,
you may be tempted to just copy the QuickTime installers to
your CD. However, to legally distribute QuickTime, you must
obtain a software license from Apple.
Obtaining a license is easy and usually free of charge. To
obtain a license, start by visiting the QuickTime Web site,
www.quicktime.com. On the main QuickTime page, click 
the Developer link. Under ADC resources, click the Software
Licensing link.
Doing this opens up a page describing why you need to license
Apple’s software products. Next, click the Agreements On Line
link and then click the QuickTime choice. This brings you to
http://developer.apple.com/mkt/swl/quicktime.html.
Next, you need to download a PDF file that includes the licens-
ing contract and licensing information. Most multimedia pro-
ducers need to click the QuickTime Software SDA Agreement
link. If you need to license QuickTime within your business or
organization, click the QuickTime Site License link.

The Digital Video
Recording Studio
S
etting up a small studio to create desktop digital video
movies often involves the purchase of computer, video,
and sound equipment. For digital video producers, editors, and
graphic designers without a technical background, evaluating
hardware can be a frustrating and confusing undertaking.
This appendix provides a hardware overview, describing some
of the hardware you may consider purchasing. The sections
here are meant to provide you with a general idea of the hard-
ware components that you may need to purchase or rent when
shooting a video production. For a thorough analysis of using
digital video hardware, you might check several resources: Web
sites of hardware manufacturers (such as www.sel.sony.com,
www.canon.com, or www.apple.com), magazine Web sites
(www.DV.com), or publishers of books specializing in DV and
file production (www.focalpress.com). Another good resource
is your local library. Many video books written over the past
20 years include video shooting, sound, and lighting chapters
that are still relevant today. Finally, you may want to investi-
gate television production workshops and classes provided
by local colleges and universities.
Computers
For most Premiere Pro users, the most important element in
their digital studio is their computer. The general rule for run-
ning Premiere Pro is to get the fastest system you can afford.
The minimum system requirements for Premiere Pro include
the following. Please remember that these are the minimum
specifications. They may not be adequate for your needs if
you are outputting professional video productions.
Note that digital video typically consumes 13GB per hour of
footage.

Processing speed
A computer system’s central processing unit (CPU) and the speed of its hard drive
(or disks) determine its overall speed when working with multimedia projects.
Many consider the computer’s CPU to be the brains of the system. Modern proces-
sors, such as the Pentium 4, are faster and more sophisticated than the Pentium III
chips. Chip speed is measured in megahertz (MHz) — a million clock cycles per 
second — where a higher number indicates a faster chip. Thus, a 900 MHz chip is
faster than an 800 MHz chip. As this book goes to press, 3-gigahertz (GHz) proces-
sors and higher are the state of the art in processors.
Coprocessors
Two CPUs are better than one. Premiere Pro, unlike many computer programs,
takes full advantage of computer systems with two or more processors. Preview
rendering speeds should be dramatically increased with multiple processors.
Hard drive speed
Hard drive speed is generally evaluated by the revolutions per minute, seek speed,
and data transfer rate. Most of the faster hard drives provide a rotational speed of
at least 7200 RPM (revolutions per minute). Some high-capacity drives have a rota-
tion speed of 10,000 RPM.

687
Appendix D ✦The Digital Video Recording Studio
Seek speed essentially measures the time it takes to seek out the section of the hard
drive that it needs to read to or write to. Seek time is measured in milliseconds. Thus,
a seek time of 8.5 ms is faster than 9.5 ms. A hard drive’s transfer rate determines
how fast the drive can transfer data. A High Capacity UltraSCSI (Small Computer
Systems Interface) drive may be able to support a transfer rate of 320MB per second.
The actual sustained transfer rate of the hard drive (how long it takes a hard drive
to save data to its platters) will be slower. For instance, the sustained data rate of
Maxtor’s Atlas 19K III Ultra 320 is 55MB/sec — certainly fast enough for video cap-
ture (to capture video, Adobe recommends a minimum sustained transfer rate of
3MB per second, preferably a sustained transfer rate of 6 MB per second). Note that
the actual video transfer rates are probably about half the maximum transfer rates
of a hard drive.
If you are capturing video, it’s also recommended that you maintain a separate 
hard disk just for video capture, and keep the disk defragmented. If you’re inter-
ested in finding more about hard drive storage and hard drive storage rates go to
www.storagereview.com.
IEEE boards
Most high-end PCs are now sold with built-in IEEE 1394 cards. The IEEE standard
has been pioneered by Apple computer, which calls the IEEE 1394 standard FireWire
(Sony calls it i.LINK). IEEE 1394 ports enable you to copy digitized audio and video
from a DV camcorder or DV tape recorder directly to your computer. The actual dig-
itization process takes place in the camera. The IEEE 1394 port enables the transfer
of data at high speeds from the camcorder to the computer, or from computer to
hard disk. The top transfer rate for the IEEE 1394/FireWire standard is a blistering
400MB per second. FireWire supports up to 63 connected devices and cables up to
14 feet long.
If your computer does not have an IEEE port, you may be able to purchase an add-in
IEEE card for $50, and sometimes even less. The IEEE 1394 port can also be used to
attach a hard disk or CD-ROM recorder. Prices of IEEE 1394/FireWire peripherals
have been dropping steadily. You should be able to purchase a 30GB drive for less
than $500. (Drives for portables are more expensive.)
Companies such as Pinnacle Systems and Miro sell high-end IEEE 1394 video boards,
which can cost over $1,000. High-end DV cards usually enable you to export files in
MPEG-2 format. MPEG-2 is a high-compression video format that provides extremely
high-quality output. Most MPEG-2 boards enable you to export your files to DVD-ROM
format. A further benefit of high-end cards is that most processing chips are built into
the cards and, therefore, can create and/or render digital effects at high speeds.

688
Part VII ✦Appendixes
Video cards
A third-party video card can speed the display of video effects in real time and often
improve image quality. While you’re taking a break from your video production work,
these cards also speed the processing of 3D games. Newer, faster boards are AGP,
Accelerated Graphics Port, which can deliver high-performance graphics to Pentium-
based motherboards. One of the chief advantages of the AGP bus is that it delivers
four times the bandwidth of the PCI bus. (The PCI, peripheral component intercon-
nect, is a high-performance system that handles the transfer of data from the CPU
to expansion slots. It is standard on most computers.) Furthermore, the AGP bus
reduces bottlenecks between the computer’s CPU and RAM, providing very high
transfer of graphics data.
If you’re interested in AGP boards, check out Radeon9700 Pro AGP, which retails for
under $400. On its manufacturer’s Web site (www.ati.com), the card is championed
as the “world’s fastest and most advanced graphics board.” According to the manu-
facturer (ATI), the 9700 Pro can process eight pixels simultaneously, twice as many
as competing products. If you are looking for a lower-priced card, take a look at
PNY’s Verto GeForce4 Ti4600 AGP card, which retails for about $300 or less. (See
www.pny.com for more details.)
Go to www.intel.com/technology/agp for a technical review of AGP technology.
RAID arrays
To help attain extremely high transfer rates, many multimedia producers have
installed RAID array systems, in which data is shared among several hard drives.
RAID systems (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) can split the data transfer
over two or more hard disks in a procedure known as striping. Because the computer
can read and write from multiple drives, transfer rates are increased. Many RAID
systems use Ultra-SCSI connections (IDE-RAID systems are also available), which
provide faster transfer than standard Mac and PC ATA connections or standard 
SCSI connections.
Peripheral Storage Devices
As you work with digitized video and sound, you are consuming large amounts of
storage space. Where do you store clips and sounds that you no longer need to
access directly from your hard disks? One of the most common storage solutions 
is to use a DLT (Digital Linear Tape) or Super DLT drive. DLT tape drives can store
several gigabytes of data to over a 100GB. For instance, Quantum’s DLT1 stores 40GB

689
Appendix D ✦The Digital Video Recording Studio
at 3MB per second. Quantum’s SDLT 220 can store 110GB at a transfer rate of 11MB
per second (if compression is used, it can store approximately twice is much data).
Apart from using DLT tapes as backup drives, they can also be used to master
DVDs. Quantum, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell all sell DLT drives. Many compa-
nies that sell DLTs use Quantum drives. You can find more information about DLTs
at www.quantum.com/AM/products/dlt.
For long-term storage, yet slower recording and slower loading, you can use a
CD/DVD recorder to record directly onto a CD-ROM or a DVD drive. Most high-end
computer models include a DVD drive that allows you to record on DVD rewritable
DVD-ROMs, which can store about 4.7GB on a single drive. CD-ROMs store about
650MB.
Analog Capture Boards
Analog capture boards accept an analog video signal and digitize video to a com-
puter’s hard disk or other storage device. On the PC, most analog boards are add-in
boards that must be purchased separately from the computer system. If you are not
shooting video using a DV system, you may consider purchasing an analog board.
The three formats used by analog boards are composite video, S-video, and compo-
nent video.
✦Composite video. Provides fair to good quality capture. In this system, the
video brightness and color components are combined into one signal. Most
composite boards have three cables: one video and two sound cables. Many
of the older DV camcorders that are still on the market enable you to place
analog tape in them and transfer data using composite signals. Many VHS tape
recorders allow input from composite video.
✦S-video. Provides a higher quality video signal than composite video because
luminance and color are separated into two different signals. Most analog
boards that provide S-video also allow composite output. S-video is considered
better quality than VHS. Most VHS tape recorders allow input from S-video.
(Many DV cameras provide an S-video port to enable you to transfer DV footage
to VHS tape decks.)
✦Component. Component video provides broadcast quality video. In component
video, two channels handle color and one channel handles luminance. Although
composite and S-video boards enable connections to camcorder and consumer
tape decks, component boards enable a connection to broadcast quality Beta
SP tape decks.

690
Part VII ✦Appendixes
Digital Video Cameras
Every few months, a new crop of digital video camcorders hits the market with more
features than the last group. If you are considering purchasing a camcorder, you have
many options to consider. If you already have a camcorder, should you upgrade to a
DV camcorder? If your budget allows, the answer should be yes, definitely.
DV camcorders, especially the newer ones that use mini-cartridges, provide higher
quality video and sound output than Hi-8 and 8mm format camcorders. DV cameras
provide more lines of horizontal resolution images than older cameras, thus color
is better and images are sharper.
DV cameras digitize and compress the signal directly in the camera. The DV compres-
sion uses a data rate of 25 megabits (Mb) per second; thus, the compression stan-
dard is often known as DV 25. As mentioned earlier, one chief advantage of a DV
camera is that you can connect it directly to a computer with an IEEE 1394 port.
Your best bet is to survey the Web pages of camcorder manufacturers, such as Sony,
Canon, and JVC. Look at the features listed and compare prices. (Canon’s Web page
currently allows you to download user manuals, which can help you understand all
the features in the camera.) The more you pay, the better the camera and the more
features offered.
Better DV camcorders usually create pictures with more pixels. For example, the
Canon Elura has a 1⁄4-inch CCD (charge coupler device, responsible for converting
the image into a signal that can be digitized) that provides 380,000 pixels; however,
some cameras — such as the Canon XLS, Canon GL1, Sony TVR900, and Sony DCR-
VX2000 — provide three CCDs with 27,000 pixels per CCD, which provide a sharper
image. (More expensive cameras boast over 500 lines of horizontal resolution.)
Another consideration is accessories. Some cameras enable you to change lenses
and have more control for changing exposure and shutter speed. If audio is impor-
tant, you might check whether your camera can connect to a wireless microphone
or to an audio mixer. Another feature to consider is whether you want to be able to
use older analog tape formats. Some models can take a Hi-8 or 8mm tape and digitize
the video right in the camera, so it can be transferred to the computer’s IEEE 1394
port (rather than to an analog capture board). Most models feature an S-video port
so that the digital video data can be transferred to a consumer VHS tape recorder.
Lenses
Most casual users of video equipment simply purchase a camera and use whatever
lens is mounted on the camera. If you keep working with video equipment, you
should learn a bit about lenses. Virtually all camcorders sold today include zoom
lenses. For example, Canon’s XL1S, one of the more expensive pro-consumer cameras

691
Appendix D ✦The Digital Video Recording Studio
on the market, features a 16x zoom. The modifier 16x indicates that the camera can
zoom in to make the focal length 16 times greater. This enables you to alter the built-
in focal length of the XL1S from 5.5mm to 88mm (this lens is interchangeable with
other lenses).
The focal length is the middle of the lens to the point where an image begins to
appear, usually measured in millimeters. The focal length indicates exactly what
image areas can appear in the lens. If the focal length is low, the viewing area is large;
if the focal length is large, the viewing area is correspondingly smaller. Thus, if you
focus on a subject with a smaller focal length, such as 10mm (a wide angle lens), you
see more of the subject than at 50mm (telephoto). At 10mm you might see an image
of a person from head to toe; at 50mm only the person’s face is seen in a closeup.
Many cameras provide digital zooms of up to 50x. Although this provides further
zooming capabilities, the picture quality usually isn’t as good as optical zooming.
When viewing the specs of high-range cameras, you frequently see the f-stop range.
The f-stops control the iris opening of the camera. The lower the f-stop, the greater
the amount of light allowed in. Higher f-stops allow less light in. Canon’s XL1 provides
a range of 1.6–16 (you can adjust the shutter speed on this camera as well). This
enables you to set manual exposure and provides greater control over depth-of-field.
Depth-of-field is typically defined as the area from the nearest point in focus to the
furthest point in focus. Having sufficient depth-of-field is especially important if a
subject you are shooting is moving. You don’t want the subject moving in and out of
focus. The focal length of the lens, the distance of the subject from the camera, and
the f-stop setting all determine depth-of-field.
Microphones
Although most camcorders feature a built-in microphone, you may want to purchase
an external microphone to capture better quality audio. For sophisticated audio
recording, you may want to purchase a mixer that enables you to accept multiple
sound inputs and enables you to monitor and set recording levels.
If you are purchasing a microphone, you want to become familiar with several com-
mon audio terms. The first one is frequency response, which describes the pick up
or sensitivity range of sound for the microphone, from low to high sounds. Sound
waves are measured in cycles per second (Hz). The human ear is sensitive to a range
from 20Hz to 16,000Hz. A microphone frequency response determines the range of
sounds it can record. An expensive studio microphone could have a range from 20
to 20,000Hz.
Microphones are divided into different categories, according to the inner electronics
that control the capture of sound. The primary categories are condenser, dynamic,
and crystal.

692
Part VII ✦Appendixes
Condenser mics are generally used as studio mics. They are usually expensive. But
you get what you pay for. They are sensitive and provide a broad frequency response.
Electret condensers are a subcategory of condenser microphones, which can be
powered with a small battery provider. They are good for reproduction of narration.
Because these microphones are especially sensitive to heat and humidity, care must
be taken when using and storing them.
Dynamic microphones are often used as external mics for camcorders. They are
inexpensive and usually quite durable. Although the sound quality recorded from
dynamic microphones is not excellent, it is generally good enough for most DV tap-
ing sessions.
Crystal mics are the least expensive. They do not record a large frequency range
and should generally be avoided.
Another basic audio concept to understand about microphones is that they utilize
different pick-up patterns. Mics can be omnidirectional or unidirectional.
✦Omnidirectional. These mics pick up sounds from all directions. If you are not
recording in a noisy area and want to capture all sounds from the recording
site, you probably want to use an omnidirectional microphone.
✦Unidirectional. These microphones pick up sound primarily from one direction.
If you are recording in a noisy room and want to record someone speaking, a
unidirectional can help eliminate background sounds.
To further specify how microphones pick up sounds, microphone manufacturers
provide polar graphs showing the response of a microphone. A polar graph is plotted
over 360 degrees with the center of the graph depicting the center of the microphone.
The round curves depict the area from which the microphone picks up sound. The
graph patterns are described as cardioid, super-cardioid, and bidirectional.
✦Cardioid. Picks up sounds primarily from the front of the mic. They eliminate
sounds from the back of the mic and can pick up some sounds from the side.
If you stand in front of the mic, most cardioids accept a 30-angle range.
✦Bidirectional. Picks up sounds primarily from the front and back of the 
microphone.
On a more technical level, mics are considered either high or low impedance.
Measured in ohms, impedance is an electrical term indicating resistance in the 
circuit. Most professional (and thus high quality) audio/video equipment and studio
equipment is low impedance. Low impedance equipment is often called Low-Z. Less
expensive equipment is generally high impedance (called Hi-Z). Generally short-
cabled microphones are Hi-Z; long cable microphones are Low-Z (15 feet or longer).

693
Appendix D ✦The Digital Video Recording Studio
As you work with audio, you also see the terms balanced and unbalanced to describe
audio cabling. Short cables with high impedance equipment using RCA mini-plugs
are using unbalanced lines. Most nonbroadcast camcorders provide unbalanced
lines. Balanced lines feature XLR and cannon plugs (shielded cables), which eliminate
buzzing sounds and other electronic noise. Expensive pro-consumer camcorders,
such as the Cannon l XL1, provide a connection to a CLR plug for hookup to an
audio mixer.
You may also want to visit audio equipment manufacturer Shure’s Web site, which
includes technical publications such as “Guide to Audio Systems for Video
Production” by Shure engineer Christopher Lyons. This publication — which
reviews microphones, mixers, and covers topics such as “Connecting a Mixer to a
Camcorder” and “How to Handle Some Common Miking Situations” — can be
downloaded from Shure’s Web site at www.shure.com.
Lighting
Lighting is one of the crucial factors determining video quality. If you are shooting
indoors, you should investigate lighting equipment and learn the basics of setting
up lights. If you’re new to video, you might take a basic studio production course,
or read a book on television lighting (the Focal press offers a variety of books on
this subject).
If you are primarily going to be shooting interior scenes and want to produce high-
quality video, you should investigate purchasing a lighting kit, along with lighting
utilities, such as scrims and barn doors (these can limit and control lights).
Although this appendix is not designed to serve as a lighting guide, to properly light
a scene, you typically include a key light and a fill light, with a backlight added to
provide more depth. The key light is the main source of illumination. Often the key
light is set at a 45-degree angle between the camera and the subject. The fill light,
often placed on the opposite side of the camera from the key, helps lighten shadow
areas produced by the key.
If you are setting up lights on-location, be wary of blowing out a fuse. A typical U.S.
consumer circuit is a 15-amp line and does not handle more than 1,800 watts (multi-
ply total amps times voltage to obtain the total watts used, 120 × 15 = 1800). It’s a
good idea to add up all the watts you are using, including any camera equipment,
before you start plugging in electrical equipment. Also remember that other electrical
equipment may be using the circuit as well.
