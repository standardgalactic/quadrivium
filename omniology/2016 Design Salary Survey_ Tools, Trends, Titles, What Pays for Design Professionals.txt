ISBN: 978-1-491-94281-9
THIS PAST AUTUMN, O’Reilly Media for the first time conducted an anonymous 
online survey of salaries of designers, UX/UI specialists, and  others in the design 
space. This in-depth report presents complete survey  results that demonstrate 
how variables such as job title, location, use of  specific tools, and the types of tasks 
performed affect salary and other  compensation. The survey attracted more than 
300 designers, managers,  and directors from 25 countries. Most of them work on 
web and mobile  products or connected devices in a wide variety of industries.
Respondents’ median salaries have been sorted according to:
n Work location (country or US region), age, gender, and education
n Job title, such as director, manager, consultant, developer, analyst, and designer
n Company size, products and services produced, team size, and design 
processes used 
n Professionals they work with most, including programmers, other designers, 
and product managers
n A range of tasks, including user research, usability testing, information 
architecture, UI design, prototyping, and project management 
n Tools used most often, from Dropbox, Slack, and GitHub to Adobe Illustrator, 
Sketch, and InVision, to Google Analytics and HTML/CSS
Curious how you would do in a different location, or how different skills and 
responsibilities might affect your salary?  Read this free report to gain insight 
from these potentially career-changing findings, and learn how to plug your 
own information into the survey’s linear model.

Take the Design Salary and Tools Survey
INTERACTION DESIGN IS A YOUNG FIELD  
experiencing tremendous, fast-paced growth.  
As a discipline, it’s still defining itself, keeping 
pace with rapidly evolving technologies. Sorting 
out design titles, roles, responsibilities, tools, and 
high-value skills isn’t easy when everything  
is changing so quickly. 
So we’re setting out to help make more sense of it 
all by putting a stake in the ground with our annual 
Design Salary Survey. Our goal in producing the sur-
vey is to give you a helpful resource for your career, 
and to keep insights and understanding flowing. 
But to provide you with the best possible informa-
tion we need one thing: participation from you and 
other members of the design community. 
Anonymous and secure, next year’s survey will 
provide more extensive information and insights 
into the demographics, roles, compensation, work 
environments, educational requirements, and tools 
of practitioners in the field. 
Take the O’Reilly Design Salary Survey. Today.
(And don’t forget to ask your design colleagues to 
take it, too. The more data we collect, the more 
information we’ll be able to share.)

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
THE 2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY investigates the tools, 
tasks, and compensation of designers, UX/UI specialists, and 
others in the design space based on data collected in an on-
line, anonymous survey. The 324 respondents largely worked 
in the design of Web/mobile products or connected devices, 
and came from a wide variety of industries and backgrounds. 
We paid special attention to the 
software designers use—respondents 
were asked which of more than 100 
tools they use—and usage correlations 
between them. 
Key findings include:
•	 UX designers earn a median  
salary of $91K ($99K for US- 
based respondents)
•	 California respondents report the highest wages
•	 Age doesn’t predict salary, years of experience do
•	 Women are paid less than men—even when all other 
variables match
Executive Summary
Age doesn’t predict 
salary, years of  
experience do.
•	 Most UX designers tend to use one of two software 
stacks: one anchored by Adobe Illustrator, the other 
anchored by Sketch
•	 Those who code (even just a little) earn more
•	 When respondents provide tool and task information, job 
title becomes less useful for predicting salaries 
In a rather manual, low-tech way, 
this report is interactive: just plug 
your own data into the linear regres-
sion model to get a salary prediction 
(no buttons, just do the math). You 
can press actual buttons, and earn 
our sincere gratitude, by taking the 
survey—it only takes about 5 to 10 
minutes and is crucial for us to con-
tinue providing this kind of research:

this report, we present both methods. The reader should 
keep in mind that any associations or correlations pre-
sented may not be causative, and that the self-selecting 
nature of the survey respondents 
means there is no guarantee 
the sample is representative of 
professionals in the design space. 
That said, we have taken care to 
be cautious in our conclusions 
to only present results that are 
statistically significant under usu-
al assumptions that the sample 
is sufficiently close to random. 
Even those designers who know the space well will likely 
find something here that is new.   
IN THE FALL OF 2015, O’Reilly Media made a compre-
hensive online survey available, focused on designers, their 
work and compensation. The 324 designers,  
UI/UX specialists, engineers, 
managers, and directors who 
took the survey came from 25 
countries and 34 US states. We 
calculated the median salary of the 
survey respondents as $91,000 
USD, a figure we decompose us-
ing information from other survey 
questions covering demographics, 
tool usage, and participation in 
several design-related tasks. While we can compare the 
salaries of groups of respondents based on how they 
answered particular questions—for example, those who 
use a particular tool and those who do not—a more 
rigorous way of assessing salary differences is through a 
linear model, which allows us to see how salary cor-
responds to a variable holding all others constant. In 
Introduction
Even those designers who 
know the space well  
will likely find something 
here that is new.
In the horizontal bar charts throughout this report, we include 
the interquartile range (IQR) to show the middle 50% of  
respondents’ answers to questions such as salary. One quarter 
of the respondents has a salary below the displayed range,  
and one quarter has a salary above the displayed range.

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
THE FIRST THING TO DO WITH SURVEY DATA is to get to 
know the sample. Most respondents (79%) work in the US 
with most of the rest working in Europe (11%) and Canada 
(5%). Half of the US respondents came from California and 
the Northeast (by way of comparison, these two regions 
make up about a quarter of the US population). We note two 
possible causes for bias towards California and the Northeast: 
people living in those regions disproportionately respond to 
O’Reilly surveys and those regions may have more design jobs. 
The discrepancy between the median salaries of US ($99K) 
and European respondents ($48K) is greater than what would 
be expected given national per capita income, but this is 
partially explained by more US respondents holding higher po-
sitions—a quirk of the sample. The US region with the highest 
salary was California (with median salary of $128K), followed 
by the Mid-Atlantic ($118K). 
Two-thirds of the respondents were male, and a significant 
gap in median pay between male and female respondents 
was present ($99K and $85K, respectively). About half of the 
$14K difference in the sample is attributable to the fact that

a larger share of the sample’s men held higher positions. Still, 
the –$6K coefficient for female in the linear model indicates 
that even when every other variable is held constant (same 
work, same skills) women earn about $6K less than men. 
This is roughly the same gender gap that we saw for data 
scientists in a different salary survey 
(depending on which model was used, 
$3K to $8K). 
More than a third of the respondents 
were 30 years old or younger, and 
predictably this group had a lower 
median salary than the rest ($71K). 
However, the age groups with the 
highest salaries in the sample were 
from 36 to 50 ($116K), higher than 
the over-50 segment ($94K). This is 
partly explained (but only partly) by the different positions 
held by the respondents aged 36 to 50; for example, the 
share of directors in the 36 to 50 group was greater than  
in the over-50 group. About half of the respondents had  
at least 10 years of experience in their role, and earned a  
median salary of $114K, while the less-experienced half 
earned a median of $74K. 
As for education, 4% had a doctorate degree and 29% had a 
master’s degree (but no PhD). While respondents with a PhD 
did have a higher median salary than average ($115K, though 
this is a fairly small sample), respon-
dents with only a master’s did not have 
a significantly higher salary than those 
without one. Another significant 
pattern was that the 38% of respon-
dents whose academic background 
was in graphic design reported a 
median salary of $81K—significantly 
less than those who had a different 
academic background (median $96K). 
In contrast, respondents with an aca-
demic background in mathematics, statistics, or physics earned 
much more than the rest of the sample (median $120K). Like 
the PhD figure, this is based on a small cohort—just 10 respon-
dents—but it is worth noting that the titles of these respon-
dents did not stand out from the rest: they were, for the most 
part, “UX” and “Designer.” 
Respondents with only 
a master’s degree did 
not have a significantly 
higher salary than those 
without one.

categories, each with 22% of the sample. The median 
salaries of these two groups, $91K and $92K, respectively, 
are approximately the same as the overall sample average. 
“UI” and “UI/UX” were broken out from “UX” to see if 
there were any key differences between these groups; the 
only real observation of interest is that 
there were far fewer titles containing 
“UI” or “UI/UX” than just “UX.” In 
terms of salary, respondents with “UI” 
or “UI/UX” titles earned less than the 
larger “UX” respondents, but this is 
entirely explainable by other variables; 
in particular, “UI” and “UI/UX” were 
much more common outside of the US, 
where salaries tended to be lower. 
Most of the “Manager” job titles were 
some variation of “UX Product [or Proj-
ect] Manager.” As we would expect, median salaries of 
managers ($126K) and directors ($116K) were the highest. 
In the sample, managers earn more than directors, likely 
influenced by more than half the managers working at 
companies with more than 10,000 employees while more 
JOB TITLE WAS COLLECTED AS AN OPEN-TEXT FIELD, 
and respondents entered 183 unique titles. Many of the 
titles are clearly just variations on the same type of role, but 
perhaps more accurately, they are points on a continuum: 
“Software Designer & Consultant,” “UX Consultant,” “UX  
Researcher,” “Design Research Associate,” 
“Visual Interaction Designer,” “Senior 
Mobile Interaction Designer,” “UI  
Developer,” “Web Developer,” “Front 
End Developer,” “Software Developer,” 
“Programmer.” Even this small list of 
titles could be binned in multiple ways. 
Our strategy here is to assign a title 
based on the first keyword it includes 
from a sequence: “Director,” “Manager,” 
“Architect,” “Consultant,” “Engineer/ 
Developer” (or “Programmer”),  
“Researcher,” “Analyst,” “Graphic Designer,” “UI/UX,”  
“UX” (or “Experience”), “UI” (or “Interaction”), “Designer,” 
“Other.” So, “UX Director” becomes “Director” and  
“Designer Consultant” becomes “Consultant.” 
Even though they come at the end of the keyword se-
quence above, “UX” and  “Designer” were  the top 
Job Title 
“UX” and  
“Designer” were  
the top categories,

than half the directors worked at companies with fewer 
than 100.  
In the sample, managers earn more than directors, likely influ-
enced by more than half the managers working at companies 
with more than 10,000 employees, while more than half the 
directors worked at companies wither fewer than 100.
Such a pattern shows a problem with trying to read too much 
into the job title results in isolation. While directors are gen-
erally understood to outrank managers, a “UX Director” at a 
small company may have similar duties and manage a similar 
number of people as a “UX Manager” at a large company—
and we know that the number of people managed tends to 
correlate with salary. 
Architects and engineers/developers made up 6% and 5% 
of the sample, respectively, but did not have significantly 
larger salaries than “UX” or “designers.” Graphic design-
ers, however, reported much lower earnings than most 
other respondents (median $49K). This discrepancy turned 
out to be the one parameter from the job title question we 
used to build our linear model. That is, the factual infor-
mation captured in other questions from the survey, e.g., 
“do you manage people” or “do you code,” helped predict 
salaries better than nominal data like job title.

(services only) earned less: this was 13% of the sample, and 
they earned a median of $70K. 
A quarter of respondents came from large companies (at least 
2,500 employees) and had larger salaries: $114K versus $83K 
among respondents from smaller companies. Company age 
was varied in the sample—21% from companies no older 
than 5 years, 38% from companies older than 20—but this 
variable did not appear to have any significant correlation with 
salary. 
Most respondents’ teams contained between 4 and 10 peo-
ple. Team size positively correlated with salary in the sample: 
members of larger teams earned more (for example, $117K 
median for those in teams with more than 10 members). 
Team size also correlated with company size, but we shall see 
that the model retained both as significant. 
We also asked about the roles of colleagues—with whom 
respondents worked—and found that most work with 
programmers (84%), (other) designers (83%), and product 
managers (78%). For each of these three, the minority of 
SOFTWARE WAS THE MOST WELL-REPRESENTED  
INDUSTRY in the sample (29%), followed by consulting 
(15%). Computers/hardware (including wearables) stood 
out for its high salaries, with a median of $130K. This correla-
tion is conflated with geography—half of the computers/
hardware respondents came from California—although even 
the non-California respondents from the hardware industry 
reported above-average salaries ($115K). This was even higher 
than the banking industry (median $108K).
While only 29% of respondents worked at companies from 
the “software industry,” the vast majority worked at compa-
nies that nevertheless produced software: 86% of respon-
dents worked on web products, and a slightly smaller majority 
(69%) worked on mobile products (almost all of the latter 
also worked on web products). Fewer respondents worked 
on wearables (15%) or other connected devices (24%), but 
these respondents reported higher salaries ($110K and $105K, 
respectively) than those who worked on neither ($86K). More 
generally, respondents who did not work on products at all

respondents who did NOT work with that type of colleague 
earned significantly less than those who did. For example, 
the 84% who worked with programmers earned a median 
salary of $96K, while those who did not earned a median 
salary of $60K. One interpretation of why communication 
channels between other roles correlate with salary is that an 
employer who highly values designers (and is willing to pay 
them above-average wages) will also be more inclined to 
encourage their greater participation in the business. Such 
a possibility raises the general point that paying attention 
to how a prospective employer organizes teams is a good 
idea, and in particular, designers may prefer companies that 
integrate design with other functions over companies that 
treat design as a standalone silo. It should be mentioned, 
however, that for salespeople, the opposite of the above 
patterns was apparent: the 38% of respondents who report-
ed working with salespeople earned less ($86K) than those 
who did not ($92K).  

The design process may not lend itself to multiple-choice 
survey questions—many respondents gave a wide variety 
of answers, such as “half waterfall half agile,” “hybridized 
lean UX,” “whatever works best,” “a good mix of the 
above,” and, our favorite, “chaos.” 17% of respondents 
selected “other”, 43% use agile, 22% use design sprints, 
10% use Lean UX, and 6% use no process at all. 
The 84% who worked with  
programmers earned a  
median salary of $96K, while  
those who did not earned  
a median salary of $60K.

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
Tasks
 The median salary of the 20% that had major involvement in 
at most 4 tasks was $73K; the median salary of the 26% that 
had major involvement in more than 10 tasks was $118K. 
Despite the explicit definition of “major tasks” provided in 
the survey questions, we think respondents appear to have 
interpreted “major” differently, i.e.,  
respondents who report that they work 
on two or three tasks might not see the 
10 tasks other respondents claim they  
work on as major. However, we see some 
indication that UX designers who wear 
many hats tend to earn higher salaries.
 Aside from some of the more obvious 
correlations among tasks—“people 
management” and “product management” are often done 
by the same people—there are some worth pointing out. 
“Wireframing” and “prototyping” are often performed 
as major tasks by the same people, with half the sample 
involved in both, and only 21% involved in one but not 
the other. “User interface design” also highly correlated with 
each of these tasks. “Pitching,” “presenting,” “storytelling,” 
and “leading design critiques” correlated with each other. 
A MUCH BETTER WAY OF ASSESSING JOB FUNCTION 
than just a title is through questions about specific tasks. In 
this survey, we allowed respondents to answer “no involve-
ment,” “minor involvement,” or “major involvement”—the 
latter meaning that this task is “essential to most or all of 
your projects and responsibilities, and that you perform it 
frequently (i.e., most days).” The tasks 
available were “user research,” “usability 
testing,” “information architecture,”  
“user interface design,” “data analytics,” 
“prototyping,” “wireframing,” “brainstorm-
ing,” “project management,” “manag-
ing people,” “requirements gathering,” 
“storytelling,” “sketching,” “pitching (to 
clients or management),” “presenting (to 
clients or management),” and “leading design critiques.” 
For each of the 16 tasks, a majority of respondents reported 
that they have minor or major involvement—even managing 
people. Furthermore, for all tasks except “sketching,”  
respondents with more involvement earned more. That is,  
the more tasks a respondent indicated they take on, the  
higher their salary.
The more tasks a  
respondent indicated 
they take on, the  
higher their salary.

in meetings each week had a median salary of $63K, rising to 
$88K for “4–8 hr/w,” $118K for “9–20 hr/w,” and $148K for 
“over 20 hr/w.” This seems a good time to remind the reader 
that these correlations do not imply causation—we do not  
advise scheduling more meetings under 
the false pretense of boosting one’s salary! 
A more reasonable assumption is that roles 
with more responsibility are associated with 
not only higher salaries, but more time in 
meetings.
The pattern of more pay for more time 
in meetings or more time coding may be 
conflated with the more general pattern 
correlating longer work weeks with higher 
salaries. For the small share (13%) of 
respondents who worked fewer than 40 hours, median salary 
was only $66K, rising to $82K for those working exactly 40, 
and to $90K for those working from 41 to 45 hours per week. 
From here, median salary rose quite rapidly: $120K for the 46- 
to 50-hour workweek and $155K for those working more than 
50 hours per week. As with the demographic variables, we 
resolve some of the ambiguity as to which variable or variables 
best predict salary with a linear model (see Model section). 
“Data analytics”—the least common of the 16 as a major 
task—tended to be done by the same respondents who were 
involved in “user research,” “usability testing,” and “require-
ments gathering.” 
For two very general tasks—“coding” and 
“meetings”—we asked for more exact 
information on how much time is spent 
on them. More than half of the sample 
did not code at all (54%) and only 13% 
coded for more than 8 hours per week. 
There was no clear, simple trend in salary 
as coding hours increased: those in the 
“no coding” and “9–20 hours / week” 
groups earned slightly more than the oth-
ers. If we exclude managers and directors, 
however, salary does rise steadily as coding hours increase, 
from a median of $82K for the non-coders to $98K for the 
9–20 hours/week group; although, for the few respondents 
who reported coding more than 20 hours/week, median salary 
fell back down to $88K. One explanation for the drop: spend-
ing too much time coding leaves less time for long meetings. 
The correlation between meeting hours and salary is no joke:

the sample) was $100K, $108K for those who used all three 
(12%), and only $76K for those who did not use any (32%). 
Aside from operating systems and communications tools, the 
most commonly used tool in the sample was pen and paper 
(with 61% of the sample), followed by Google Analytics (57%) 
and HTML/CSS (53%). It is perhaps a little surprising that the 
top non-OS software used among designers is for analytics—
remember that analytics was the task with fewest respondents 
reporting major involvement—but this might be because there 
is less in-depth attention to or focus on analytics that would 
lead to greater tool specialization or experimentation. Or else, 
Google Analytics just works very well for designers. 
We found respondents using three dominant tools: Adobe 
Illustrator (43%), Bohemian Coding’s Sketch (40%), and 
InVision (38%). Most Sketch users, 63%, also use InVision. 
The latter two positively correlated: 63% of respondents 
who used Sketch also used InVision, while only 24% of 
respondents who did not use Sketch did use InVision. There 
was no significant correlation between either of these two 
and Illustrator: someone who used one was no more or less 
THE SURVEY CONTAINED QUESTIONS IN THE FORM OF 
“do you use this tool in your current role on a regular basis 
(about every week)?” for more than 100 tools. Not all tools 
were specific to design—the list included programming lan-
guages, work organization tools, and operating systems—and it 
wasn’t meant to be exhaustive, with “other” answers available. 
Mac OS X appears to be the clear choice for those in the design 
space, with 88% of the sample using Macs, far more than the 
38% who use Windows and the 12% who use Linux. Windows 
users earned less than Mac users: among those who used one 
(but not both) of these operating systems, Mac users had a  
median salary of $95K and Windows users had a salary of 
$78K, while those who used both had a median salary of $88K. 
Many of the tools we asked about are for communications, 
file sharing, or project management. Among the most com-
mon are Google Drive (59%), Dropbox (58%), Slack (51%), 
GitHub (40%), Trello (32%), Evernote (32%), and Basecamp 
(29%). Of these tools, Slack, GitHub, and Evernote were no-

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
dents in this stack tended to use fewer tools: the average 
number of tools (of any type) used by respondents who 
use Illustrator (but not Sketch) was 12, while for those who 
use Sketch (but not Illustrator), the average number of tools 
used was 16. When we identify tool stack silos like this, 
there is always a degree of uncertainty in the interpretation 
of why it arose without further study: for example, it could 
arise because there are compatibility issues, or because 
those who use this stack don’t need other tools (all their 
use cases are satisfied since the tools are effectively gener-
alized). As usual, we should note that there is a difference 
in salaries between the two groups: users of Illustrator had 
a median salary of $87K; users of Sketch had a median 
salary of $101K; and users of InVision had a median salary 
of $96K. 
The final group of tools on the survey were programming 
languages. JavaScript was by far the most popular language 
(35%, median salary $95K), followed by Python (8%, 
$90K), Ruby (6%, $98K), Java (6%, $88K), and Swift (4%, 
$85K). There were no major correlations between particu-
lar programming languages and design tools; if we include 
programming languages in the clustering schema above, 
they would just form their own cluster. Swift has a stronger 
connection with iOS, as we would expect, but with Android 
as well, indicating that the extent to which these two major 
mobile platforms require specialization among mobile de-
signers is limited. 
likely to use the other. However, if we consider only  
those with “UX,” “UI,” “UI/UX,” “Designer,” or “Graphic 
Designer” job titles, Sketch and Illustrator negatively correlate;  
that is, most UX designers tend to use one but not both (the 
change is caused by the large share of non-UX designers who 
use neither). The same is true for InVision and Illustrator. An 
even clearer division emerges when we start to look at how 
these three correlate with other tools. 
Aside from InVision, design/analytics tools that correlated  
with Sketch—more precisely, tools that were used by a  
significantly greater share of respondents who used Sketch  
than those who did not—included Google Analytics, Keynote,  
Optimizely, Mixpanel/Kissmetrics, Pixate, Marvel, Framer, 
Flinto, Proto.io, and Tableau (among others). Most of these 
tools also correlated with InVision (but not quite as strongly as 
with Sketch), and the few that also correlated with Illustrator—
Keynote, Flinto, and Proto.io—did so to a much lesser degree. 
In fact, in the network of usage correlation between all tools, 
Sketch becomes the most dominant “hub”: many tools correlate 
with it (chief among them InVision), and for many tools, it 
is the best-correlated (or most well-connected) neighbor. 
Among tools outside of the design/analytics category, Slack 
correlated highly with Sketch (as well as with InVision and 
other associated tools listed above). 
In contrast, the only design tools that gravitated to Illustrator 
are two other Adobe products, InDesign and After Effects: 
this is a vendor-based stack silo. More generally, respon-

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
If someone knows (and crucially, if their employer knows) 
that they could walk out today from their at-will employment 
and find equivalent work elsewhere, the employer is likely 
to be willing to pay more. In this sense, ease of finding work 
is a predictor of salary, so we introduced it into the model. 
However, it should be noted that this variable could also be 
considered a dependent variable that we could try to predict 
with other variables (i.e., alongside salary, not “below” it). 
Now, for the model.1  From the 65 questions, we extracted 202 
variables (multiple-choice questions usually have almost as many 
variables as there are answer choices), and from the available 
variables, the algorithm selected the most significant. The 
algorithm favors a model with a smaller number of variables (to 
keep the model simpler) and assigns a coefficient (a positive or 
negative number) to each. To get your salary estimate, start 
 with the constant ($51K), and for each variable that applies to 
you add (or subtract) the corresponding coefficient (or for years 
1 We used the Affinity Propagation algorithm in Scikit-learn to 
perform linear regression with cross validation and the lasso, and 
arrived at a model that includes 40 variables (and an intercept). The 
model has an R2 of .43: about 43% of the variation in salaries was 
explained.
IN ADDITION TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC, company/team, 
tasks, and tools variables used to create the linear model, we 
include two additional variables: bargaining skills and employ-
ability. In both cases, respondents are prompted to self-eval-
uate their skill based on a 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) scale. 
We know the results are likely subjective and imprecise (for 
example, bargaining skills are difficult to quantify and likely 
inconsistent) but we think the results and model would suffer 
if we ignore the topic. It seems fairly clear, for example, that 
if someone routinely accepts lowball offers without putting 
up any fight, they will earn less than someone who bargains 
more aggressively (even if they are just as talented, experi-
enced, and hardworking as the latter). Most respondents 
(66%) self-reported a bargaining score of 3 or 4, with 12% 
reporting a score of 5. Unsurprisingly, each bargaining “point” 
corresponded to a higher salary. 
The other question, also on a five-point scale, was the ease of 
finding a new position, assuming “that the new job is more or 
less equivalent to your current one, in terms of compensation, 
workload, and your interest in the work.” Again, this is highly 
hypothetical and subjective, but is similarly hard to ignore.

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
This model gives us a more rigorous assessment of how much 
variables predict salary, allowing us to revisit some of the 
differences in salary between various groups of respondents. 
Since the model only includes a subset of the available vari-
ables, it shows us which ones are likely to have true correla-
tions with salary and which are more likely to be insignificant 
(even if they might correlate with the significant ones). 
The gap in salary between the US and Europe is reduced 
to +$25K (UK/Ireland and Canada are in between), but the 
coefficient for California is still quite large at +$17K. Aside 
from this and the +$3K value for the Northeast (from NY/NJ), 
no US region was significant enough to be kept in the model 
(so the large salaries in the Mid-Atlantic appear to have been 
somewhat of an accident). 
The gender gap was reduced to –$6,403, although this doesn’t 
really make the previously observed $14K difference any better. 
In some ways, it makes it worse since the model is telling us 
that if we keep everything else constant—experience, skills, 
role—a woman will likely earn $6K less than a man. 
One variable that is conspicuously absent is age, which seems 
to be completely replaced by other variables, most notably 
years of experience. For each year of experience, UX designers 
are predicted to gain $1,292: a rather modest raise, although 
this would be on top of expected salary changes from other 
variables (e.g., new tools or different tasks). 
Education remained an important feature, the academic 
backgrounds of math/stats/physics giving a +$1,158 increase 
and graphic design a –$5,178 decrease. The further penalty 
of –$1,848 for “Graphic Designer” as a title means that if 
there are two people who both do graphic design, one called 
“Graphic Designer” and one called something else, the for-
mer will be expected to earn almost $2K less than the latter. 
The lack of other nonzero coefficients for title variables means 
that with the exception of “graphic designer,” salary is not 
based on what you are called but rather what you do. 
For industry, company size, and team size there were few 
differences suggested by the model from the single-variable 
salary comparisons observed above. The only industry variable 
kept in the model is education (–$7,522); hardware/computers 
did not make it into the model. The boost in salary for large 
company employees is (only) +$1,543, while at the other end 
of the company size scale, self-employed respondents (i.e., 
company size = 1) had a large, positive coefficient of +$12,455. 
The correlation between team size and salary that we noted 
earlier is made clear in the model: those with a team size of at 
least 8 earned $6,661 more than smaller teams; those with a 
team larger than 20 people earned an additional $5,263; and 
teams of only 1 or 2 people had a further penalty of –$6,052. 
The latter penalty also explains part of why the single-person- 
company coefficient is so high: the negative effect of having  
a small team does not apply to them, so the negative,  
35

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
small-team coefficient needs to be cancelled out. Not only did 
larger teams predict a larger salary, but working with people 
in certain roles—namely, product managers and program-
mers—had positive effects on salary (+$7,021 and +$3,633, 
respectively). 
As we would expect, managing people (major involvement) is 
accompanied with a large boost in salary: +$18,409. Almost as 
significant, however, is programming: those who do not pro-
gram at all are expected to earn $16,682 less, according to the 
model. Major involvement (versus minor) does not change the 
salary prediction. While this does not mean that if you learn 
how to program you are guaranteed $16K more, the possibility 
that there is some causative aspect in this relationship (which 
seems somewhat intuitive) should be enough to motivate 
some UX designers to learn how to code (at least a little). 
Given the huge discrepancies between median salaries of 
groups split by meeting hours, it is no surprise to see similarly 
large coefficients in the model. A ray of hope (for those of 
us who are not overly fond of spending half the day on the 
phone) might be found in the fact that while spending at 
least 9 hours/week in meetings bumps predicted salary up 
by $14,168, spending more than 20 hours/week gives only 
an additional $1,379. Workweek hours were also associated 
with large coefficients: +$23,472 for more than 55 hours; 
–$16,834 for less than 35 (and a further $4,129 for a work-
week less than 30 hours). 
None of the major design-specific tools were present in the 
model, although Slack is (+$6,378) and, as previously noted, 
it is highly correlated to Sketch. Aside from Keynote (+$3,198) 
and Dropbox (+$1,434), the only tools with high positive  
coefficients were tools each used by less than 6% of the sample: 
User Zoom (+$5,403), PHP (+$5,147), and Alexa (+$3,661). 
One tool had a negative coefficient: Windows (–$3,740). 
The two self-evaluating scores gave the last coefficients. For 
each point (out of five) for one’s bargaining skills, predicted 
salary increases by about $1K. (This seems like a low estimate, 
but then again, it’s an average, and perhaps it doesn’t matter 
very much for some people in certain situations.) Those who 
would not rate their ease of finding new work higher than a 3 
(out of 5) are penalized –$5,444. 
Even after numbers are plugged in, there is still a fair amount 
of error in the estimation by this model. Among new data 
points—such as yours, if you are in the mood for a little 
math—half should be within $20K of the estimate, and 
three-quarters within $30K, but some larger outliers can be 
expected. Of course, there are many factors, some impossible 
to accurately assess in a survey, much less an anonymous one, 
that will undoubtedly have important effects on salary and 
throw off the estimate, but on average this model should be 
more or less correct.

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
Salary is not static, nor is it the only important part of one’s 
compensation. Respondents were asked to report the change 
in their salary over the last three years: 83% reported some 
positive change, 49% reported a gain of at least $20K, and 
9% reported a gain of at least $60K. As a 
percentage of salary (three years ago), the 
median gain was 22%. Interestingly, the 
same variables used to estimate salary in 
the regression model presented earlier did 
not seem to have much predictive power 
for either the actual or percentage salary 
change; the best models we found left 
more than 90% of the variation in salary 
growth unexplained. 
Bonuses were received in the previous 12 
months by about half of the sample, with 
19% receiving a bonus under $5K, 18% 
from $5K to $10K, and 12% more than $10K. Like salary 
change, the bonus data were not amenable to prediction 
using the rest of the survey data, aside from the trivial result 
that the bigger bonuses tended to be received by those with 
the highest salaries. 
Among non-cash parts of compensation, most respondents 
reported that they receive health insurance 
(81%) and contributions to a retirement 
plan (64%). Smaller cohorts received stock 
options (30%), profit sharing (16%), and 
the opportunity for a sabbatical (10%). Less 
than three weeks of vacation were available 
to 24% of the sample, exactly three weeks 
to 38%, three or four to 26%, and the 
remaining 12% had six weeks or more. Of 
these four groups, the one with the highest 
median salary was the last: $100K and six 
weeks of vacation. Unsurprisingly, vacation 
was more generous in Europe than in the 
US: 4.6 weeks on average in Europe (both in the UK and on 
the continent) and 3.3 weeks on average in the US.

2016 DESIGN SALARY SURVEY
SALARY IS NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD IGNORE, even 
though many of us might not want to spend too much time 
dwelling on money matters or worrying that we don’t make 
enough. The commonly accepted rule that it is not appropriate 
to share information about your salary with colleagues has 
reasonable justification—too much information could culti-
vate an environment of envy or perceived injustice—but no 
information at all about how much one should earn results in 
plenty of confusion and unfairness as well. Both the employer 
and the employee gain from knowing more or less what the 
latter should make. 
Aside from the purpose of determining an appropriate salary 
offer or ask, the information in this report is also intended to 
help those in the design space navigate through the import-
ant career choices: which tasks might you want to spend 
more (or less) time on; which tools might you want to learn; 
and at which types of companies might you want to apply 
for a job. On one hand, the correlation-causation distinction 
means that we cannot say, for example, that “learning” Slack 
(it’s pretty easy) will boost your salary by $6K. 
On the other hand, the fact that we cannot assume causation 
in the observed correlations does not mean there is none. 
When, based on intuition, causation seems possible, and when 
the rewards appear to be large and costs relatively low, it seems 
reasonable to act on an observed correlation even if causation 
is not ensured. A prime example of this is with coding: it is  
intuitive that being able to code, at least a little, would help a 
UX designer working on web, mobile, or (software-enabled) 
hardware; and learning how to code a little is probably not a 
great cost compared to the potential reward—even hypotheti-
cally—of an estimated, eventual $16K salary increase.
In conclusion, we hope that you find this report interesting, 
but above all useful. Design is a quickly changing field, and 
we hope to keep up with it by continuing this research, which 
cannot be possible without your participation. We encour-
age you to try your own data in the model, and if you can
