critics argue that HD is already a bust. Of 
course, with such transformations come 
challenges and concerns, and these will 
doubtlessly occupy the thoughts of broad-
casters well into the foreseeable future.
When this book was initially published in 
the mid-1980s, radio was enjoying unprece-
dented prosperity. The prices being paid for 
radio properties were soaring, and station 
revenues were at exceptional levels. Life was 
good for almost everyone in the industry, 
or so it seemed. Many AM station owners 
were not in on the opulent banquet, and 
a growing number were pulling the plug 
on their operations. Yet on the whole, the 
1980s were auspicious years for the magic 
medium.
The tide shifted as the final decade of the 
twentieth century began. The nation had 
slipped into a nasty recession, taking radio 
with it on its downward slide, but soon the 
medium’s fortunes were on the upswing 
and broadcast properties were again attract-
ing gargantuan sums. The catalyst of this 
unparalleled resurgence was the Federal 
Communications Commission, which elim-
inated station ownership caps through the 
groundbreaking legislation of its Telecom-
munications Act of 1996.
The industry has certainly experienced 
many ups and downs since its modest incep-
tion over 80 years ago, however, and it will 
doubtlessly know the thrill of ascent and 
the angst of decline again. (As this edition 
was being prepared, the economic crisis 
on Wall Street and in the banking and 
housing markets was causing the industry 
to brace itself for another likely downturn 
in its fortunes.) Radio was, is, and hopefully 
Preface
What was said in the preface of the last 
edition remains true in this newest incar-
nation. To the understandable chagrin of 
all but a few radio executives, the industry 
now includes other forms of the medium 
besides terrestrial or broadcast outlets. 
Added under the rubric “radio” (or radio 
media) are satellite and web stations  –  thus 
the subtitle of this book. Says Larry Rosin, 
President, Edison Media Research, “Regard-
less of the platform, consumers see all these 
[audio] options as merely being new forms 
of ‘radio.’” This author agrees. In point of 
fact, there are now many different types of 
radio stations, not just AM and FM.
The industry has literally metamorpho-
sized since the start of the new millen-
nium, and to be sure it barely resembles the 
description in the book’s first edition in the 
1980s. Why? Succinctly stated, the rollout 
of new audio technologies and the elimina-
tion of station ownership caps. For good or 
bad, these have altered the very nature of 
the industry. For example, in the case of the 
near obliteration of ownership caps, today 
one radio company can own hundreds, even 
thousands, of stations, whereas it could own 
only a handful (a few dozen) little more 
than a decade ago.
Indeed, since the first publication of 
this book, the radio industry has wit-
nessed seismic change. In addition to the 
significant regulatory revamping of the last 
decade, radio has undergone unprecedented 
technical overhauling. The advent of high-
definition radio  –  HD Radio  –  promises to 
revolutionize broadcast signal transmission 
and reception, or at least, that is the hope 
of station owners and operators. Meanwhile,

will ­continue to be a wonderfully alive and 
dynamic medium with a seemingly incalcu-
lable life span. It is impossible to imagine a 
world without David Sarnoff’s radio music 
box, but that is not necessary  –  it is safe to 
assume that radio in some form (broadcast, 
satellite, Internet) will continue to be an 
integral part of our lives for a very long 
time to come.
The mission of this book has not changed. 
This edition, like the previous seven, is the 
result of a desire and effort to provide the 
student of radio with the most complete 
account of the medium possible, from the 
insider’s view, if you will. It is presented 
from the perspective of the radio profes-
sional, drawing on the insights and observa-
tions of those who make their daily living 
by working in the industry.
What continues to set this particular 
text apart from others is that hundreds 
of radio people have contributed to this 
effort to disseminate factual and relevant 
information about the medium in a way 
that captures its reality. These profession-
als represent the top echelons of network 
and corporate radio, as well as the rural 
daytime-only outlets spread across the 
country.
I have sought to create a truly practi-
cal, timely, illustrative (a picture can be 
worth a thousand words  –  stations explain 
and reveal themselves through visuals), and 
accessible book on commercial radio station 
operations; a book that reflects through its 
structure and organization the radio station’s 
own organization. Therefore, the depart-
ments and personnel that comprise a radio 
station are our principal focus. I begin by 
examining the role of station management 
and then move into programming, sales, 
news, engineering, production, and traffic, 
as well as other key areas that serve as the 
vital ingredients of any radio outlet.
Because my strategy was to draw on the 
experience of countless broadcast and allied 
professionals, my debt of gratitude is signifi-
cant. It is to these individuals who contrib-
uted most directly to its making that I also 
dedicate this book.
Therefore, I would like to express my 
sincere appreciation to the many individu-
als and organizations that assisted me in 
so many important ways. Foremost among

Since the publication of earlier editions, 
it is certain  –  in an industry noted for its 
nomadic nature  –  that a significant number 
of contributors have moved on to positions 
at other stations (or in some cases left the 
industry). Moreover, it is equally certain 
that many stations have changed call letters, 
because that is the name of the game, too. 
Because of the sheer volume of contributors, 
it would be difficult to establish the current 
whereabouts or status of each without 
employing the services of the FBI, CIA, 
NSA, Secret Service, and CNN. Therefore, 
I have usually let stand the original addresses 
and call letters of contributors except when 
new information has become available; in 
those cases, changes have been made.
As this new edition goes to press, radio’s 
greatest writer, Norman Corwin, nears his 
100th birthday. Therefore, it seems fitting 
that his homage to radio be carried over 
in this new edition as an homage to him 
for all he contributed to the glory of the 
medium.
In any case, good evening or good afternoon, good morning or good night,
Whichever best becomes the sector of the sky
Arched over your antenna.
We wish some words with you
Concerning magic that would make a
Merlin envious
The miracle, worn ordinary now, of just such business as this
Between your ears and us, and oceantides of ether.
We mean the genii of radio
Kowtowing to Aladdins everywhere,
As flashy on the run as light, and full of services to ships at sea and planes in the air and people in their 
living rooms, resembling you.

But time and time again, radio reinvents 
itself and continues to prevail as the Teflon 
medium. Radio doesn’t “kill” other media, 
it just exists . . . and prospers, as reliably as 
a sunrise.
With that said, there are red flags of 
concern. I don’t think radio has anything 
to fear but itself. As radio ownership has 
evolved from individuals and relatively 
small broadcast-centric companies into 
giant corporations, there’s a fear that radio 
is losing its soul. That its passion, its desire 
to create fans instead of users, and its vision-
impaired broadcasters are to blame. The 
FCC has liberal guidelines for inventive 
radio, yet too many stations are innovation-
adverse as if there was this mysterious FCC 
law that guided the sound, preferring to 
maintain a dated playbook as the standard, 
at a time when the competitive landscape 
has never been denser. Fortunately, there are 
answers but it’s going to be the new genera-
tion of thinkers that create and execute a 
new vision.
Radio needs to go into creative hyper 
drive and aggressively challenge traditional 
thinking  –  not only in programming, but in 
literally every area of radio station opera-
tion. While at XM Radio, I was amazed at 
the denial among so many broadcasters who 
wrote off satellite radio for all the wrong 
reasons. Forty years ago, the same denial 
existed among many AM broadcasters who 
trumpeted that FM was a fad for hippies 
and classical music fans. The twenty-first 
century is a bad time for denial. A better 
approach is accepting that there are new 
forms of audio entertainment emerging and 
that radio, from a position of strength, needs 
Foreword to the Eighth Edition
by Lee Abrams
Windows are rolled down as you blaze down 
the open road . . . a hot radio station screams 
out of the speakers. A cold wintry night at 
2 a.m., a distant AM station speaks to the 
American vista, or a controversial beacon of 
the mainstream keeps you company with 
arguable dialogue. These are just a few of 
the reasons that radio is the soundtrack of 
the nation. An indescribable experience that 
when executed with passion and purpose is 
timeless, intoxicating, and magical.
Oddly enough, the obituary for radio has 
been written time and time again. In the 
50s, it was TV. After all, who would listen 
to the Lone Ranger when you could now 
watch it? In the 70s, it was home taping. 
Why bother waiting for your favorite song 
when you could tape it on your cassette 
player and listen at your convenience? Now-
adays, it is the Internet that is the “culprit.” 
xiii 

limited playlists that are behind the curve 
and generic voices with little ­character. 
Radio needs to accept these facts . . . and 
aggressively attack them . . . and write the 
new playbook for the twenty-first century.
Although the scenario is daunting, never 
has there been an opportunity to rethink 
and reinvent. To look at radio as a living 
and breathing entity that needs to be 
fed and nurtured with extreme invention 
and confidence. With all of the challenges 
that face radio in this century, that’s all the 
more reason to be excited about the pos-
sibilities. It’s up to those inside the stations 
to manufacture magic . . . and turn listeners 
into fans. With that said, there’s no reason 
radio cannot and will not enter another 
golden age. It’s in your control.
to refocus its energy and fight back . . . 
with passion, character, and muscle. Satel-
lite radio, Internet radio, iPods, and what-
ever new technologies are created in the 
next few years, are all competition for the 
world’s ears. The economic viability is still 
a question mark, but there’s no shortage of 
compelling sound being created by nontra-
ditional audio providers.
Radio needs to mobilize its benefits: 
theater of the mind production; immedi-
ate and credible information; the bible of 
music, old, new, and of all genres; voices 
that you become addicted to; and the list 
goes on. But if you listen to many stations 
today, that edge is being lost. Production

sound effects, stale news presentations,

Foreword to the Eighth Edition

Chapter 4  —  New contributions by key 
industry sales executives refresh this chapter. 
Selling in the cluster setup and in a vola-
tile economy is assessed more extensively. 
Updated figures include new rate cards and 
sales software programs.
Chapters 5, 7, 8, and 11  —  The content in 
these chapters has been updated to reflect 
the expanding presence of computers and 
use of the Internet and station websites. 
How station consolidation has impacted 
these areas is further considered.
Chapter 6  —  The section on Arbitron’s Por-
table People Meter is expanded and updated 
and how the Internet is used to enhance 
station research is examined.
Chapter 9  —  Stronger emphasis on the 
digital studio highlights this significantly 
revised chapter. Information on the expand-
ing array of new audio tools – equipment 
and Internet applications – is presented in 
the context of studio production.
Chapter 10  —  New and expanded data 
on station classifications and governmen-
tal regulations and the influence of tech-
nology give this chapter a timeliness as 
does updated information on satellite and 
­Internet radio.
The 8th edition strives to be more universal 
and timely in its approach to its subject 
by incorporating material about ALL radio 
­stations – broadcast, satellite, and Inter-
net. The entire text has been updated and 
revised to include dozens of new figures. 
Some of the highlights include:
Chapter 1  —  Digital radio is discussed more 
extensively in terms of its prospects for com-
peting with satellite radio and helping revive 
a sagging terrestrial radio market. Likewise, 
the sections on satellite and Internet radio 
are embellished in terms of programming, 
marketing, and policy and their relationship 
with broadcast radio and other forms of 
audio, namely, mobile multimedia devices.
Chapter 2  —  The impact of station cluster-
ing on management is expanded and several 
new contributors weigh in on a host of 
topics related to running broadcast, satellite, 
and Internet operations and the overseeing 
of the integration of new technologies in a 
difficult economy.
Chapter 3  —  New and evolving formats 
are discussed as well as programming in the

Internet, which is virtually nonexistent in 
many parts of the world, especially in Third 
World countries.
Observes Tribune Company’s COO, 
Randy Michaels, “Listening may be down, 
but radio use remains very high, with over 
90% of everyone over the age of 6 hearing 
the radio every week.” There is no patch of 
land, no piece of ocean surface untouched 
by the electromagnetic signals beamed from 
the more than 40,000 radio stations world-
wide. Over a quarter of these broadcast 
outlets transmit in America alone. Today, 
more than 13,500 stations in this country 
reach 99% of all households, and less than 
1% have fewer than five receivers (most 
have at least eight). There are nearly a billion 
working radios in the United States.
Modern radio’s unique personal approach 
resulted in a shift of the audience’s applica-
tion of the medium: radio went from family 
or group entertainer before 1950 to indi-
vidual companion after the debut of the 
video medium. Although television usurped 
radio’s position as the number one home 
entertainment source over five decades ago, 
radio’s total reach handily exceeds that of 
the video tube. More people rely on radio for 
its multifaceted offerings than on any other 
medium – print or electronic, although the 
Internet is quickly gaining ground. Practi-
cally every automobile (96%) has a radio. 
“There are twice as many car radios in use 
(approximately 140 million) as the total 
circulation (50 million) of all daily news­
papers, and four of five adults are reached 
by radio each week,” contends Kenneth 
Costa, former vice president of marketing 
for the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB).
State of the Fifth Estate1
In the Air – Everywhere
The competitive landscape of broadcast 
radio has changed dramatically in the last 
few years. New audio technologies, such 
as satellite and Web radio, as well as music 
downloading media (MP3s and iPods) and 
mobile music services or mobile ­multimedia 
devices (cell phones and PDAs), have trans-
formed the listening environment. Yet, in the 
first decade of the new millennium, broad-
cast radio continues to hold its own in the 
face of the many new competing audio tech-
nologies and the seismic shifts in its man-
agement and operational structure due to 
the elimination of long-standing ownership 
caps and the subsequent consolidation and 
clustering of thousands of stations. Station 
owner and communications entrepreneur Jay 
­Williams, Jr., states: “Buoyed by deregulation, 
consolidation and Wall Street money, then 
buffeted by increased competition and new 
technology, terrestrial radio executives are 
bracing for a challenging future by explor-
ing programming and format options, more 
sophisticated advertiser relationships, and 
new digital distribution platforms to more 
robustly compete and grow.”
Although overall listening has declined 
(over 15% between 1990 and 2008 accord-
ing to recent estimates and mainly among 
younger listeners), as has the actual time 
people spend tuned to broadcast radio 
(one report in 2006 had time spent listen-
ing (TSL) down by nearly 4% since 2003) 
due to increased competition from other 
audio choices and legislative changes, radio 
continues to be one of the most pervasive 
media on earth, even more so than the 
1 

to move with its audience has never been 
greater. Out-of-home listeners account for 
over 60% of the average audience Monday 
through Friday. In addition, the RAB con-
cluded that 7 of 10 computer purchasers 
and wine and beer drinkers tune into the 
medium daily.
Radio appeals to everyone and is available 
to all. Its mobility and variety of offerings 
have made it the most popular medium in 
history, while this popularity has been on the 
wane in recent years, it continues to be high. 
To most adults, radio is as much a part of their 
day as morning coffee and the ride to work. It 
is a companion that keeps us informed about 
world and local events; gives us sports scores; 
provides us with the latest weather and school 
closings and a host of other information, not 
to mention our favorite music; and asks for 
nothing in return. A Katz Radio Group study 
­concluded “only radio adapts to the lifestyle 
of its audience.” The report dispelled the 
belief that radio listening drops during the 
summer, as does TV viewing, proving that 
radio is indeed a friend for all seasons.
It is difficult to imagine a world without 
such an accommodating and amusing cohort, 
one that not only has enriched our lives by 
providing us with a nonstop source of enter-
tainment, but has also kept us abreast of hap-
penings during times of national and global 
crisis. To most Americans, radio ­continues to 
be an integral part of daily life.
Eight of 10 adults are reached weekly by 
car radio. According to Arbitron’s annual 
report “Radio Today,” the medium “reaches 
more than 94% of the U.S. 121 population 
each week, [and] on average, Americans 
spend around 18 hours per week listening 
to their favorite stations.” As the new mil-
lennium proceeded, this computed to well 
over 230 million Americans, although some 
recent audience studies have suggested 
that listening figures for radio, in particular 
TSL, are on a noteworthy decline due to 
new competing audio media. A Radio’s All 
Dimensional Audience Research (RADAR) 
report also found that working women 
account for nearly 60% of radio listening 
by women, a statistic that reflects the times. 
Meanwhile, radio continued to be tremen-
dously popular among African Americans 
and Hispanics, where the medium’s weekly 
reach is about 95% of that population. 
The number of radio receivers in use in 
America has risen by more than 50% since 
1970, when 325 million sets ­provided lis-
teners with a wide range of audio services. 
In recent years, technological innovations 
in receiver design alone have contributed 
to the ever-increasing popularity of the 
medium. According to the New York Times, 
Americans bought nearly 60 million radios 
annually in the last years of the 1990s, but 
that trend slowed in the new century, due 
to mobile music services. Radio’s ability

CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

A Household Utility
Although radio seems to have been around 
for centuries, it is a relatively recent inven-
tion. Many people alive today once lived in 
a world without radio – hard to imagine, yet 
true. The world owes a debt of gratitude to 
several “wireless” technologists who contrib-
uted to the development of the medium. 
A  friendly debate continues to be waged 
today as to just who should rightfully be 
honored with the title “father of radio.” 
There are numerous candidates, some who 
date as far back as the nineteenth century. 
For example, there is physicist James Clerk 
Maxwell, who theorized the existence of 
electromagnetic waves, which later in the 
century were used to carry radio signals. Then 
there is German scientist Heinrich Hertz, 
who validated Maxwell’s theory by proving 
that electromagnetic waves do indeed exist.
The first choice of many to be anointed 
grand patriarch of radio is Guglielmo 
Marconi, who is credited with devising 
a method of transmitting sound without 
the help of wires – thus the name ­wireless 
telegraphy. A  host of other inventors and 
innovators can, with some justification, 
be considered for the title. Nikola Tesla 
experimented with various forms of wire-
less transmission and although he has 
been largely neglected by historians, today 
there are Tesla Societies that maintain he 
is responsible for the invention of wire-
less transmission and modern radio. Lee 
De Forest, Ambrose Fleming, Reginald 
­Fessenden, and David Sarnoff are a few 
others whose names have been associated 
with the hallowed designation. (A further 
discussion of radio’s preeminent tech-
nologists can be found in Chapter 10.) 
However, of the aforementioned, perhaps 
the pioneer with the most substantial claim 
is Sarnoff. A true visionary, Sarnoff report-
edly conceived of the ultimate application 
of ­Marconi’s device in a now-famous mem-
orandum. In what became known as the 
“radio music box” memo, Sarnoff suppos-
edly suggested that radio receivers be mass-
produced for public consumption and that 
music, news, and information be broadcast 
to the households that owned the appliance.

A Toll on Radio
Though not yet a household word in 1922, 
radio was surfacing as a medium to be 
reckoned with. Hundreds of thousands of 
Americans were purchasing crude, battery-
operated crystal sets of the day and tuning 
the two frequencies (750 and 833 kc) set 
aside by the Department of Commerce 
for reception of radio broadcasts (a third 
frequency was soon added). The majority 
of stations in the early 1920s were owned 
by receiver manufacturers and department 
stores that sold the apparatus. Newspapers 
and colleges owned nearly as many. Radio 
was not yet a commercial enterprise. Those 
stations not owned by parent companies 
often depended on public donations and 
grants. These outlets found it no small task 
to continue operating. Interestingly, it was 
not one of these financially pinched sta-
tions that conceived of a way to generate 
income, but rather AT&T-owned WEAF in 
New York.
According to most broadcast historians, 
the first paid announcement ever broad-
cast lasted 10 minutes and was bought by 
­According to legend, at first his proposal 
was all but snubbed. Sarnoff’s persistence 
eventually paid off, and in 1919 sets were 
available for general purchase. Within a very 
few years, radio’s popularity would exceed 
even ­Sarnoff’s estimations. Recently, some 
scholars have argued that Sarnoff’s memo 
may have been written several years later, 
if at all, as a means of securing his status in 
the history of the radio medium. However, 
the latest consensus gives Sarnoff credit for 
proposing radio as we know it.

remained relatively small, with fewer 
than half a dozen outlets. Under the NBC 
banner, both networks would grow, the 
Blue network remaining the more modest 
of the two.
Less than 2 years after NBC began oper-
ation, the Columbia Broadcasting System 
(CBS, initially Columbia Phonograph Broad-
casting System) began its network service 
with 16 stations. William S. Paley, who had 
served as advertising manager of his family’s 
cigar company (Congress Cigar), formed 
the network in 1928 and would remain its 
chief executive into the 1980s.
A third network emerged in 1934. The 
Mutual Broadcasting System went into 
business with affiliates in only four cities – 
New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Cincinnati. 
Unlike NBC and CBS, Mutual did not own 
any stations; its primary function was that 
of program supplier. In 1941, Mutual led its 
competitors with 160 affiliates. The network 
left the air in April 1999 following a long 
series of financial difficulties.
Although NBC initially benefited from the 
government’s fear of a potential mono­poly 
of communication services by AT&T, it also 
was forced to divest itself of a part of its hold-
ings because of similar apprehensions. When 
the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) implemented more stringent chain 
broadcasting rules in the early 1940s, which 
prohibited one ­organization from operating 
­Hawthorne Court, a Queens based real 
estate company. (Radio scholar Donna 
Halper contends that Boston’s WGI actu-
ally aired a commercial before WEAF.) 
Within a matter of weeks other businesses 
also paid modest “tolls” to air messages 
over WEAF. Despite AT&T’s attempts to 
monopolize the pay-for-broadcast concept, 
a year later in 1923 many stations were 
actively seeking sponsors to underwrite 
their expenses as well as to generate profits. 
Thus, the age of commercial radio was 
launched. It is impossible to imagine what 
American broadcasting would be like today 
had it remained a purely noncommercial 
medium as it has in many countries.
Birth of the Networks
The same year that Pittsburgh station 
KDKA  began offering a schedule of daily 
broadcasts, experimental network operations 
using telephone lines were inaugurated. As 
early as 1922, stations were forming chains, 
thereby enabling programs to be broadcast 
simultaneously to several different areas. 
Sports events were among the first pro-
grams to be broadcast in network fashion. 
Stations WJZ (later WABC) in New York 
and WGY in Schenectady linked for the 
airing of the 1922 World Series, and early 
in 1923 WEAF in New York and WNAC 
in Boston transmitted a football game ema-
nating from Chicago. Later the same year, 
President Coolidge’s message to Congress 
was aired over six stations. Chain broad-
casting, a term used to describe the earliest 
networking efforts, was off and running.
The first major broadcast network was 
established in 1926 by the Radio Corpora-
tion of America (RCA) and was named the 
National Broadcasting Company  (NBC). 
The network consisted of two dozen 
­stations – several of which it had acquired 
from AT&T, which was encouraged by the 
government to divest itself of its broad-
cast holdings. Among the outlets RCA 
purchased was WEAF, which became 
its flagship station. Rather than forming 
one exclusive radio combine, RCA chose 
to operate separate Red and Blue net-
works. The former comprised the bulk of 
NBC’s stations, whereas the Blue network

on catastrophic for the ­fledgling medium. 
Radio reception suffered greatly as the result 
of too many stations broadcasting, almost 
at will, on the same frequencies. Interfer-
ence was widespread. Frustration increased 
among both the listening public and the 
broadcasters, who feared the strangulation 
of their industry.
Concerned about the situation, partici-
pants of the National Radio Conferences 
(1922–1925) appealed to the secretary of 
commerce to impose limitations on station 
operating hours and power. The bedlam 
continued, however, because the head of the 
Commerce Department lacked the neces-
sary power to implement effective changes. 
However, in 1926, President Coolidge 
urged Congress to address the issue. This 
resulted in the Radio Act of 1927 and the 
formation of the Federal Radio Commis-
sion (FRC). The five-member commission 
was given authority to issue station licenses, 
allocate frequency bands to various ser-
vices, assign frequencies to individual sta-
tions, and dictate station power and hours 
of operation.
Within months of its inception, the FRC 
established the Standard Broadcast band 
(500–1500 kc) and pulled the plug on 150 
of the existing 732 radio outlets. In less 
than a year, the medium that had been 
on the threshold of ruin was thriving. The 
listening public responded to the clearer 
reception and the increasing schedule of 
entertainment programming by purchasing 
millions of receivers. More people were 
tuned to their radio music boxes than ever 
before.
Radio Prospers during  
the Depression
The most popular radio show in history, 
Amos ‘n’ Andy, made its debut on NBC in 
1929, the same year the stock market took 
its traumatic plunge. The show attempted 
to lessen the despair brought on by the 
ensuing Depression by addressing it with 
lighthearted humor. As the Depression deep-
ened, the stars of Amos ‘n’ Andy, Freeman 
Gosden and Charles Correll, sought to assist 
in the president’s ­recovery plan by helping 
two separate and distinct networks, RCA 
sold its Blue network, retaining the more 
lucrative Red network.
The FCC authorized the sale of the Blue 
network to Edward J. Noble in 1943. Noble, 
who had amassed a fortune as owner of the 
Lifesaver Candy Company, established the 
American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 
1945. In the years to come, ABC would 
eventually become the largest and most suc-
cessful of all the radio networks.
By the end of World War II, the net-
works accounted for 90% of the radio 
audience and were the greatest source of 
individual station revenue. Today, most of 
the major networks are under the auspices 
of megacorporations. In 1995, Disney 
purchased Cap Cities/ABC and Westing-
house bought CBS. A few years earlier, GE 
reclaimed NBC.
Conflict in the Air
The 5 years that followed radio’s ­inception 
saw phenomenal growth. Millions of receiv-
ers adorned living rooms throughout the 
country, and more than 70 stations were 
transmitting signals. A lack of sufficient 
­regulations and an inadequate ­broadcast 
band contributed to a ­situation that ­bordered

outlets. All materials and manpower were 
directed at defeating the enemy. Mean-
while, existing amplitude modulation (AM) 
stations prospered and enjoyed increased 
stature. Americans turned to their receiv-
ers for the latest information on the war’s 
progress. Radio took the concerned listener 
to the battlefronts with dramatic and timely 
reports from war correspondents, such as 
Edward R. Murrow and Eric Sevareid, in 
Europe and the South Pacific. The imme-
diacy of the news and the gripping reality 
of the sounds of battle brought the war 
into stateside homes. This was the war that 
touched all Americans. Nearly everyone 
had a relative or knew someone involved 
in the effort to preserve the American way 
of life. Broadcast news emerged as a major 
programming factor during the war and 
would play a central role in every subse-
quent conflict.
Programs that centered on concerns 
related to the war were plentiful. Under the 
auspices of the Defense Communications 
Board, radio set out to do its part to quash 
aggression and tyranny. No program of the 
day failed to address issues confronting 
the country. In fact, many programs were 
to restore confidence in the nation’s banking 
system through a series of recurring refer-
ences and skits. When the Amos ‘n’ Andy 
show aired, most of the country stopped 
what it was doing and tuned in. Theater 
owners complained that on the evening the 
show was broadcast, ticket sales decreased 
dramatically.
As businesses failed, radio flourished. The 
abundance of escapist fare that the medium 
offered, along with the important fact that it 
was provided free to the listener, enhanced 
radio’s hold on the public. Not one to over-
look an opportunity to give his program 
for economic recuperation a further boost, 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt launched 
a series of broadcasts on March 12, 1933, 
which became known as the “fireside chats.” 
Although the president had never received 
formal broadcast training, he was com-
pletely at home in front of the microphone. 
The audience perceived a man of sincerity, 
intelligence, and determination. His sensi-
tive and astute use of the medium went 
a long way toward helping in the effort to 
restore the economy.
In the same year that Roosevelt took to 
the airwaves to reach the American people, 
he set the wheels in motion to create an 
independent government agency whose sole 
function would be to regulate all electronic 
forms of communication, including both 
broadcast and wire. To that end, the Com-
munications Act of 1934 resulted in the 
establishment of the FCC.
As the Depression’s grip on the nation 
weakened in the late 1930s, another crisis 
of awesome proportions loomed – World 
War II. Once again radio would prove 
an invaluable tool for the national good. 
Just as the medium completed its second 
decade of existence, it found itself enlist-
ing in the battle against global tyranny. By 
1939, as the great firestorm was nearing 
American shores, 1465 stations were 
authorized to broadcast.
Radio during World War II
Before either frequency modulation (FM) 
or television had a chance to get off the 
ground, the FCC saw fit to impose a wartime 
freeze on the construction of new broadcast

many of the medium’s entertainers and 
sponsors jumped ship as well. Profits began 
to decline, and the radio networks lost their 
prominence.
In 1952, as television’s popularity con-
tinued to eclipse radios, 3000 stations of 
the faltering medium were authorized to 
operate. Several media observers of the day 
predicted that television’s effect would be 
too devastating for the older medium to 
overcome. Many radio station owners around 
the country sold their facilities. Some rein-
vested their money in television, and others 
left the field of broadcasting entirely.
Recalling this bleak period in radio’s 
history in a 1958 magazine article in Wisdom, 
David Sarnoff wrote: “In the Spring of 1949, 
the cry went up that ‘radio is doomed.’” 
Some of the prophets of doom predicted 
that within 3 years sound broadcasting over 
national networks would be wiped out, with 
television taking its place.
“I did not join that gloomy forecast in 
‘49,’ nor do I now. Years have passed, and 
radio broadcasting is still with us and ren-
dering nationwide service. It plays too vital 
a role in the life of this nation to be canceled 
out by another medium. I have witnessed 
too many cycles of advance and adapta-
tion to believe that a service so intimately 
integrated with American life can become 
extinct.”
“We would be closing our eyes to reality, 
however, if we failed to recognize that radio 
has been undergoing fundamental changes. 
To make the most of its great potentials, it 
must now be operated and used in ways 
which take cognizance of the fact that it 
is no longer the only broadcast medium. 
A process of adjustment is necessary, and it 
is taking place.”
A New Direction
A technological breakthrough by Bell Labo-
ratories scientists in 1948 resulted in the 
creation of the transistor. This innovation 
provided radio manufacturers the chance 
to produce miniature portable receivers. 
The new transistors, as they were popularly 
called,  enhanced radio’s mobility. Yet the 
medium continued to flounder throughout 
expressly propagandistic in their attempts 
to shape and influence listeners’ attitudes 
in favor of the Allied position.
Programs with war themes were popular 
with sponsors who wanted to project a patri-
otic image, and most did. Popular commen-
tator Walter Winchell, who was sponsored 
by Jergen’s Lotion, closed his programs with 
a statement that illustrates the prevailing 
sentiment of the period: “With lotions of 
love, I remain your New York correspon-
dent Walter Winchell, who thinks every 
­American has at least one thing to be thank-
ful for on Tuesday next. Thankful that we 
still salute a flag and not a shirt.”
Although no new radio stations were 
constructed between 1941 and 1945, the 
industry saw profits double and the listening 
audience swell. By war’s end, 95% of homes 
had at least one radio.
Television Appears
The freeze that prevented the full develop-
ment and marketing of television was lifted 
within months of the war’s end. Few radio 
broadcasters anticipated the dilemma that 
awaited them. In 1946 it was business as 
usual for the medium, which enjoyed new-
found prestige as the consequence of its valu-
able service during the war. Two years later, 
however, television was the new celebrity 
on the block, and radio was about to experi-
ence a significant decline in popularity.
Although still an infant in 1950, televi-
sion succeeded in gaining the distinction 
of being the number one entertainment 
medium. Not only did radio’s audience 
begin to migrate to the TV screen, but 
FIGURE 1.8

schedule of programs

CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

records. Before long the Top 40 station was 
synonymous with rock and teens.
A few years passed before stations 
employing the format generated the kind 
of profits their ratings seemed to warrant. 
Many advertisers initially resisted spending 
money on stations that attracted primarily 
kids. By 1960, however, rock stations could 
no longer be denied because they led their 
competitors in most cities. Rock and radio 
formed the perfect union.
FM’s Ascent
Rock eventually triggered the wider accep-
tance of FM, whose creator, Edwin H. 
Armstrong, set out to produce a static-free 
alternative to the AM band. In 1938 he 
accomplished his objective, and 2 years 
later the FCC authorized FM broadcasting. 
However, World War II and RCA (which 
had a greater interest in the development 
of television) thwarted the implementation 
of Armstrong’s innovation. Construction on 
FM stations did not begin until 1946. Yet 
FM’s launch was less than dazzling. Televi-
sion was on the minds of most Americans, 
and the prevailing attitude was that a new 
radio band was hardly necessary.
More than 600 FM outlets were on the 
air in 1950, but by the end of the decade 
the number had shrunk by 100. Through-
out the 1950s and early 1960s, FM stations 
the early 1950s as it attempted to formulate 
a strategy that would offset the effects of 
television. Many radio programmers felt that 
the only way to hold onto their dwindling 
audience was to offer the same material, 
almost program for program, aired by televi-
sion. Ironically, television had ­appropriated 
its programming approach from radio, which 
no longer found the system viable.
By 1955, radio revenues reached an unim-
pressive $90 million, and it was apparent to 
all that the medium had to devise another 
way to attract a more formidable follow-
ing. Prerecorded music became a main-
stay for many stations that had dropped 
their network affiliations in the face of 
decreased program schedules. Gradually, 
music became the primary product of radio 
stations, and the disc jockey (deejay, jock) 
their new star.
Radio Rocks and Roars
The mid-1950s saw the birth of the unique 
cultural phenomenon known as rock ‘n’ roll, 
a term invented by deejay Alan Freed to 
describe a new form of music derived from 
rhythm and blues. The new sound took hold 
of the nation’s youth and helped return 
radio to a position of prominence.
In 1955, Bill Haley’s recording of Rock 
Around the Clock struck pay dirt and sold 
over a million copies, thus ushering in a 
new era in contemporary music. The fol-
lowing year Elvis Presley tunes dominated 
the hit charts. Dozens of stations around 
the country began to focus their playlists 
on the newest music innovation. The Top 
40 radio format, which was conceived by 
Todd Storz (while at his favorite watering 
hole in Omaha) and developed by a slew 
of programming innovators about the time 
rock made its debut, began to top the ratings 
charts. In its original form, Top 40 appealed 
to a much larger cross section of the listening 
public because of the diversity of its offerings. 
At first artists such as Perry Como, Les Paul 
and Mary Ford, and Doris Day were more 
common than the rockers. Then the growing 
penchant of young listeners for the doo-wop 
sound figured greatly in the narrowing of

FM’s Ascent

resorted when the word came down from 
Washington that simulcast days were over. 
Automation kept staff size and production 
expenses to a minimum. Many stations 
assigned FM operation to their engineers, 
who kept the system fed with reels of music 
tapes and cartridges containing commercial 
material. Initially, the idea was to keep the 
FM as a form of garnishment for the more 
lucrative AM operation. In other words, at 
combo stations the FM was thrown in as 
a perk to attract advertisers – two stations 
for the price of one. To the surprise of more 
than a few station managers, the FM side 
began to attract impressive numbers. The 
more-music, less-talk (meaning fewer com-
mercials) stereo operations made money. By 
the late 1960s, FM claimed a quarter of the 
radio listening audience, a 120% increase in 
less than 5 years.
Contributing to this unprecedented rise 
in popularity was the experimental progres-
sive format, which sought to provide listen-
ers with an alternative to the frenetic, highly 
commercial AM sound. Rather than focus-
ing on the best-selling songs of the moment, 
as was the tendency on AM, these stations 
were more interested in giving airtime to 
album cuts that normally never touched the 
felt of studio turntables. The progressive or 
album rock format (also called underground 
and freeform), conceived by Larry Miller 
and Tom (“Big Daddy”) Donahue, slowly 
chipped away at Top 40’s ratings numbers 
and eventually earned itself part of the radio 
audience.
The first major market station to choose 
a daring path away from the tried and true 
chart hit format was WOR-FM in New 
York. On July 30, 1966, the station broke 
from its AM side and embarked on a new 
age in contemporary music programming. 
Other stations around the country, foremost 
among them KMPX in San Francisco, did 
not take long in following its lead.
The FM transformation was to break 
into full stride in the early and mid 1970s. 
Stereo component systems were a hot con-
sumer item and the preferred way to listen 
to music, including rock. However, the 
notion of Top 40 on FM was still alien to 
most. FM listeners had long regarded their 
medium as the alternative to the pulp and 
punch ­presentation typical of the Standard 
directed their programming to special-
­interest groups. Classical and soft music were 
offered by many stations. This conservative, 
if somewhat highbrow, programming helped 
foster an elitist image. FM became associated 
with the intellectual or, as it was ­sometimes 
referred to, the “egghead” community. Some 
FM stations purposely expanded on their 
snob appeal image in an attempt to set them-
selves apart from popular, mass appeal radio. 
This, however, did little to fill their coffers.
FM remained the poor second cousin to 
AM throughout the 1960s, a decade that 
did, however, prove transitional for FM. 
Many FM licenses were held by AM station 
operators who sensed that someday the new 
medium might take off. An equal number of 
FM licensees used the unprofitable medium 
for tax write-off purposes. Although many 
AM broadcasters possessed FM frequen-
cies, they often did little when it came to 
programming them. Most chose to simul-
cast their AM broadcasts. It was more cost-
­effective during a period when FM drew 
less than 10% of the listening audience.
In 1961, the FCC authorized stereo 
broadcasting on FM. This would prove to 
be a benchmark in the evolution of the 
medium. Gradually, more and more record-
ing companies were pressing stereo disks. 
The classical music buff was initially consid-
ered the best prospect for the new product. 
Since fidelity was of prime concern to the 
classical music devotee, FM stations that 
could afford to go stereo did so. The “easy 
listening” stations soon followed suit.
Another benchmark in the development of 
FM occurred in 1965 when the FCC passed 
legislation requiring that FM broadcasters in 
cities whose populations exceeded 100,000 
break simulcast with their AM counterparts 
for at least 50% of their broadcast day. The 
commission felt that simply duplicating an 
AM signal did not constitute efficient use 
of an FM frequency. The FCC also thought 
that the move would help foster growth in 
the medium, which eventually proved to 
be the case.
The first format to attract sizable audi-
ences to FM was Beautiful Music, a creation 
of program innovator Gordon McLendon. 
The execution of the format made it par-
ticularly adaptable to automation systems, 
to which many AM/FM combo operations

a technical standard, leaving that task to the 
marketplace. This resulted in a very slug-
gish conversion to the two-channel system, 
and by the 1990s only a few hundred AM 
outlets offered stereo broadcasting. Those 
that did were typically the more prosper-
ous metro market stations that ultimately 
featured talk and information formats.
Eventually, the FCC declared Motorola 
the industry standard-bearer, but by the 
mid-1990s the hope that stereo would 
provide a cure for AM’s deepening malaise 
had dimmed considerably. By this time, 
many AM outlets, which may have ben-
efited by having a stereo signal, were in a 
weaker financial state and unable to convert 
or were less than enthusiastic about any 
potential payback. Many were just holding 
on in the hope that the impending conver-
sion of radio to digital would help level the 
playing field for AM.
Noncommercial/Public Radio
More than 1500 stations operate without 
direct advertiser support. Noncommercial 
stations, as they are called, date back to 
the medium’s heyday and were primarily 
­Broadcast band. The idea of contemporary 
hit stations on FM offended the sensibilities 
of a portion of the listening public. None-
theless, Top 40 began to make its debut on 
FM, and for many license holders it marked 
the first time they enjoyed sizable profits. By 
the end of the decade, FM’s profits would 
triple, as would its share of the audience. 
After three decades of living in the shadow 
of AM, FM achieved parity in 1979 when 
it equaled AM’s listenership. The follow-
ing year it moved ahead. In the late 1980s, 
studies demonstrated that FM attracted as 
much as 85% of the radio audience.
With nearly as many AM stations (4784) 
as FM stations (5720) and only a quarter 
of the audience, the older medium was 
faced with a unique challenge that could 
determine its very survival. In an attempt 
to retain a share of the audience, many AM 
stations dropped music in favor of news and 
talk. WABC-AM’s shift from music radio 
to talk radio in 1982 clearly illustrated the 
metamorphosis that AM was undergoing. 
WABC had long been the nation’s foremost 
leader in the pop/rock music format.
In a further effort to avert the FM sweep, 
hundreds of AM stations went stereo in the 
latter part of the last century. AM broad-
casters hoped this would give them the 
competitive edge they urgently needed. 
It was hoped that music would return to 
the AM side, bringing along with it some 
unique format approaches. A number of 
radio consultants believed that the real pro-
gramming innovations in the years ahead 
would occur at AM stations. “Necessity is 
the mother of invention,” said Dick Ellis, 
programming consultant and former radio 
format specialist for Peters Productions in 
San Diego, California. “Expect some very 
exciting and interesting things to happen on 
AM,” predicted Ellis over a decade ago. In 
some respects, his vision was on target, but 
the full realization of his prediction did not 
come to pass.
AM Stereo
Hoping to help AM radio out of its dol-
drums, in the early 1980s the FCC autho-
rized stereocasting on the senior band. 
However, the commission failed to declare

of its operating budget. Affiliates in turn 
are supported by listeners, community busi-
nesses, and grants from the CPB. Program 
underwriting (the equivalent of sponsor-
ships) is a primary way that public sta-
tions meet their operating budgets. These 
on-air ­announcements run approximately 
15 seconds and include sponsor name and 
information but no direct selling or hype. 
They are purchased by sponsors in much the 
same way that spots are sold on commercial 
stations – from a rate card based on ratings. 
(Public radio station Web sites usually 
provide more detail on this subject.)
The CPB claims that 22.2 million ­listeners 
tune into public radio stations on a weekly 
basis. NPR claims that over 13 million 
Americans tune into their member stations. 
Their literature states that “NPR’s news and 
performance programming attracts an audi-
ence distinguished by its level of education, 
professionalism, and community involve-
ment.” (Programs such as All Things Con-
sidered and Morning Edition have become 
the industry’s premier news and informa-
tion features, achieving both popular and 
­critical acclaim.) Public radio consultant 
Ken Mills declares, “The growth of public 
radio news listening is one of the biggest 
success stories in terrestrial radio of the 
past two decades. Since the early 1990s, lis-
tening to NPR News stations has more than 
doubled. As of 2005, more than 26 million 
listeners hear NPR News each week. NPR 
News stations are often among the most-
listened-to stations in most markets. The 
growing demand for public radio news has 
created an opportunity for public radio 
consultants such as myself. News/talk pro-
gramming and documentaries – the types 
of programming I specialize in – will likely 
continue to be in demand.”
Research shows that NPR listeners are 
consumers of information from many 
sources and are more likely than average 
Americans to buy books. They are moti-
vated citizens involved in public activi-
ties, such as voting and fund-raising. They 
address public meetings, write letters to 
editors, and lead business and civic groups.
Public Radio International (formerly 
American Public Radio) debuted in 1983 
and operated much like NPR. It provided 
listeners with additional ­noncommercial 
run by colleges and universities. The first 
“noncoms” broadcast on the AM band but 
moved to the FM side in 1938. After World 
War II, the FCC reconstituted the FM band 
and reserved the first 20 channels (88–92 
MHz) for noncommercial facilities. Ini-
tially, this gave rise to low-power (10-W) 
stations known as Class D’s. The lower cost 
of such operations was a prime motivator 
for schools that wanted to become involved 
with broadcasting.
In 1967, the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (CPB) was established as 
the result of the Public Broadcasting Act. 
Within 3 years National Public Radio 
(NPR) was formed. Today, more than 400 
stations are members of NPR, which pro-
vides programming. Many NPR affiliates are 
licensed to colleges and universities, and a 
substantial number are owned by nonprofit 
organizations.
Member stations are the primary source 
of funding for NPR. They contribute 60%

operate at lower power, some with as little 
as 10 W. Since the late 1970s, a large per-
centage of college stations have upgraded 
from Class D and now radiate hundreds of 
Watts or more. Most college stations serve 
as training grounds for future broadcasters 
while providing alternative programming 
for their listeners.
Community noncoms are usually licensed 
to civic groups, foundations, school boards, 
and religious associations. Although the 
majority of these stations broadcast at low 
power, they manage to satisfy the program-
ming desires of thousands of listeners.
In some instances, noncoms pose a ratings 
threat to commercial stations. However, 
this threat is usually in the area of classical 
music and news programming. Consequently, 
­commercial and noncommercial radio sta-
tions manage a fairly peaceful and ­congenial 
options, airing popular programs like 
­Garrison Keillor’s A Prairie Home Compan-
ion and many others.
Noncommercial stations can be divided 
into at least three categories: public, 
college (noncommercial educational), and 
­community. A fourth category, noncommer-
cial ­religious stations, has emerged during 
the last couple of decades and continues to 
grow in the second half of the 2000s.
Many public radio stations, especially 
those affiliated with NPR, choose to air 
classical music around the clock; others 
opt to set aside only a portion of their 
broadcast day for classical programming. 
According to the preeminent association 
of college broadcasters, the Intercollegiate 
Broadcasting System (IBS), more than 800 
schools and colleges hold noncommercial 
licenses. The majority of these stations

On Public Radio
Although the distance between com-
mercial and public radio has narrowed 
in recent years, they remain notably 
different. As the largest single source 
of income for public radio stations is 
listener contributions, the program-
ming is listener-driven and the program 
directors read the Arbitron ratings just 
as their commercial colleagues do. 
However, their programming must be 
significantly different in content and 
quality from commercial programs to 
elicit freewill contributions. (In many 
European countries, public service 
broadcasting is supported by a tax on 
receivers, not voluntary contributions.) 
Commercial stations, though often 
involved in community service, have 
one goal: make a profit. Public stations 
have a mission to serve unmet cultural, 
information, and community needs.
The most listened-to programs on 
public radio are news and information 
programs: Morning Edition, All Things 
Considered, and Fresh Air. These are 
characterized by both the thoroughness 
of their coverage and the breadth of 
subjects. They regard news of the arts/
popular culture to be as important to 
understanding the world as news of 
politicians. No commercial network 
comes close to replicating these pro-
grams. Local stations frequently sponsor 
town meetings on important public 
affairs issues or sponsor concerts in 
the community to strengthen their 
local links. Local stations may broad-
cast jazz, Triple A (Adult Alternative 
Album), blue grass, acoustic, classical 
music, or an array of talk programs. 
Some stations are directed to specific 
audiences such as Hispanic or Indian.
Public radio listeners tend to be 
­educated and to include decision 
makers and influentials in their commu-
nities, so their influence is great. Eight 
of 10 newspaper editors rely on it as 
an important source of information, as 
do network television producers and 
anchors. Publishers Weekly said public 
radio is the single most important 
medium for the book business.
In addition to support from listeners, 
public radio also receives corporate 
and business underwriting, and grants 
from foundations and the CPB, which 
was created in 1967 to distribute 
federal funds and protect stations 
against political pressure on program-
ming. Managing a public radio station 
is, therefore, more complex because it’s 
funding is so diverse. At the same time 
it must protect the independence of the 
programming from the funder influence.
Recently, some politicians have ques-
tioned continued federal funding for 
public broadcasting, and various alter-
native systems of this support are being 
explored.

Proliferation and Frag-Out
Specialization – narrowcasting or nichecast-
ing as it came to be called – salvaged the 
medium in the early 1950s. Before that time, 
radio bore little resemblance to its sound 
during the age of television. It was the video 
medium that copied radio’s approach to pro-
gramming during its golden age. “Sightradio,” 
as television was sometimes ironically called, 
drew from the older electronic medium its 
programming schematic and left radio hover-
ing on the edge of the abyss. Gradually, radio 
station managers realized they could not 
combat the dire effects of television by pro-
gramming in a like manner. To survive they 
had to change. To attract listeners they had to 
offer a different type of service. The majority 
of stations went to spinning records and pre-
senting short newscasts. Sports and weather 
forecasts became an industry staple.
Initially, most outlets aired broad-appeal 
music. Specialized forms, such as jazz, 
rhythm and blues, and country, were left off 
most playlists, except in certain regions of 
the country. Eventually, these all-things-to-
all-people stations were challenged by what 
is considered to be the first popular attempt 
at format specialization. As legend now has 
it, radio programmer Todd Storz and his 
assistant Bill Steward of KOWH-AM in 
Omaha, Nebraska, decided to limit their 
station’s playlist to only those records that 
currently enjoyed high sales. The idea for 
the scheme struck them at a local tavern 
as they observed people spending money 
to play mostly the same few songs on 
the jukebox. Their programming concept 
became known as “Top 40.” Within months 
of executing their new format, KOWH 
topped the ratings. Word of their success 
spread, inspiring other stations around the 
nation to take the pop-record approach. 
They too found success.
By the early 1960s other formats had 
evolved, including Beautiful Music, which 
was introduced over San Francisco station 
KABL, and All-News, which first aired 
over XETRA located in Tijuana, Mexico. 
Both formats were the progeny of Gordon 
McLendon and were successfully copied 
across the country.
The diversity of musical styles that 
evolved in the mid-1960s, with the help of 
such disparate performers as the Beatles and 
Glen Campbell, gave rise to myriad format 
variations. Although some stations focused 
on 1950s rock ‘n’ roll (“blasts from the past,” 
“oldies but goodies”), others stuck to current 
hits, and still others chose to play more 
obscure rock album cuts. The 1960s saw 
the advent of the radio formats of soft rock 
and acid and psychedelic hard rock. Mean-
while, country, whose popularity had been 
confined mostly to areas of the South and 
Midwest, experienced a sudden growth in 
its acceptance through the crossover appeal 
of artists such as Johnny Hartford, Bobbie 
Gentry, Bobby Goldsboro, Johnny Cash, 
and, in particular, Glen Campbell, whose 
sophisticated country-flavor songs topped 
both the Top 40 and country charts.
As types of music continued to become 
more diffused in the 1970s, a host of new 
formats came into use. The listening audi-
ence became more and more fragmented. 
Frag-out, a term coined by radio consultant 
Kent Burkhart, posed an ever-increasing 
challenge to program directors (PDs) whose 
job it was to attract a large enough piece 
of the radio audience to keep their stations 
profitable.

CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the 
rise and decline of the disco format, which 
eventually evolved into urban contempo-
rary, and a wave of interest in synthesizer-
based electropop. Formats such as soft rock 
faded from the scene only to be replaced 
by a narrower form of Top 40 called con-
temporary hit. New formats continue to 
surface with almost predictable regularity. 
Among the most recent batch are Adult 
Standards, New AC/Smooth Jazz, Eclectic-
Oriented Rock, All-Weather, Churban, All-
Motivation, and All-Business.
Although specialization saved the indus-
try from an untimely end a half century 
ago, the proliferation in the number of radio 
stations (which more than quadrupled since 
1950) competing for the same audience has 
brought about the age of hyperspecializa-
tion. Today, there are more than 100 format 
variations in the radio marketplace, com-
pared to a handful when radio stations first 
acknowledged the necessity of programming 
to a preselected segment of the audience as 
the only means to remain in business. (For 
a more detailed discussion on radio formats, 
see Chapter 3.)
Profits in the Air
Although radio has been unable to regain 
the share of the national advertising dollar 
it attracted before the arrival of television, it 
does earn far more today than it did during 
its so-called heyday. About 7% of all money 
spent on advertising goes to radio. This com-
putes to billions of dollars.
Despite the enormous gains since WEAF 
introduced the concept of broadcast adver-
tising, radio cannot be regarded as a get-
rich-quick scheme. Many stations walk a 
thin line between profit and loss. Although 
some major market radio stations demand 
and receive more than $1000 for a 1-­minute 
commercial, an equal number sell time for 
the proverbial “dollar a holler.”
Though the medium’s earnings have 
maintained a progressive growth pattern, it 
also has experienced periods of recession. 
These financial slumps or dry periods have 
almost all occurred since 1950. Initially, 
television’s effect on radio’s revenues was 
devastating. The medium began to recoup 
its losses when it shifted its reliance from 
the networks and national advertisers to 
local businesses. Today, 70% of radio’s rev-
enues come from local spot sales as com-
pared to half that figure in 1948.
By targeting specific audience demograph-
ics, the industry remained solvent. In the 
1980s, a typical radio station earned $50,000 
annually in profits. As the medium regained 
its footing after the staggering blow adminis-
tered to it by television, it experienced both 
peaks and valleys financially. In 1961, for 
example, the FCC reported that more radio 
stations recorded losses than in any previ-
ous period because it began keeping records 
of such things. Two years later, however, 
the industry happily recorded its greatest 
profits ever. In 1963, the medium’s reve-
nues exceeded $636 million. In the next few 
years earnings would be up 60%, surpass-
ing the 1.5  billion mark, and would leap 
another 150% between 1970 and 1980. FM 
profits have tripled since 1970 and have sig-
nificantly contributed to the overall industry 
figures.
The AM daytimer segment of the indus-
try has found it the most difficult to stay 
in the black. The FCC requires these radio 
stations to cease broadcasting around sunset 
so as not to interfere with other AM sta-
tions. Of the 2000 daytimers in operation, 
nearly a third reported losses at one time or 
another in the 1980s.
Concerning the challenges of program-
ming an AM daytimer, station manager 
Dan Collier observes, “You don’t have the

elements of the plan included tax ­incentives 
for AM broadcasters who pull the plug on 
their ailing operations and multiple AM 
station ownership in the same market.
As a consequence of the formidable 
obstacles facing the AM daytime operation, 
many have been put up for sale, and asking 
prices have been alarmingly low.
However, many full-time metro market 
AMs have sold for multimillions, for the 
simple reason that they continue to appear 
in the top of their respective ratings surveys. 
Meanwhile, the price for FM stations has 
skyrocketed since 1970.
In general, individual station profits have 
not kept pace with industrywide profits 
due to the rapid growth in the number of 
outlets over the past two decades. To say 
the least, competition is keen and in many 
markets downright fierce. It is common for 
30 or more radio stations to vie for the 
same advertising dollars in large cities, and 
the introduction of other media in recent 
years, such as cable, satellite, and web radio, 
intensifies the skirmish over sponsors.
Economics and Survival
Following the general financial euphoria 
and binge-buying of the 1980s, the early 
1990s experienced a considerable economic 
downturn, which had a jarring impact on 
the radio industry. Had the medium become 
a “top-down” industry, to use the vernacular 
of the day? (See Figure 1.15.)
money for staff. You don’t have the budget 
for ­talented people. You don’t have the 
resources for new equipment or to even 
maintain the equipment you have, which 
is typically in disrepair. These stations are a 
very tough sell to advertisers, so they lapse 
into decline and many eventually go silent. 
It doesn’t have to be that way, but good 
management of this type of station is almost 
as scarce as advertising dollars.”
The unique problem facing daytime-only 
broadcasters has been further aggravated by 
FM’s dramatic surge in popularity. The nature 
of their license gives daytimers subordinate 
status to fulltime AM operations, which have 
found competing no easy trick, especially in 
the light of FM’s success. Because of the lowly 
status of the daytimer in a marketplace that 
has become increasingly thick with rivals, it 
is extremely difficult for these stations to 
prosper, although some do very well. Many 
daytimers have opted for specialized forms 
of programming to attract advertisers. For 
example, religious and ethnic formats have 
proven successful.
Over the years, the FCC has considered a 
number of proposals to enhance the status 
of AM stations. One such proposal suggested 
that the interference problem could be 
reduced if certain stations shift frequencies 
to the extended portion (1605–1705 kHz) of 
the AM band. FCC Docket 87-267, issued in 
the latter part of 1991, cited the preceding 
as a primary step in improving the AM situa-
tion. It inspired many skeptics who regarded 
it as nothing more than a bandage. Other

CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

show a decrease.” The survey showed that 
budgets for equipment purchases were being 
delayed and that “planned spending for most 
areas is somewhat below last year’s.”
To counter the sharp reversal of fortunes, 
many broadcasters formed local market-
ing (also called management) agreements 
(LMAs), whereby one radio station leases 
time and/or facilities from another area 
station. The buzzword in the early 1990s 
became LMAs.
LMAs allowed radio stations to enter into 
economically advantageous, joint operating 
ventures, stated the editors of Radio World. 
They believed that LMAs should remain 
the province of the local marketplace and 
not be regulated by the federal government. 
The publication asserted that LMAs provide 
broadcasters a means of functioning during 
tough economic times and in a ferociously 
competitive marketplace.
Those who opposed LMAs feared that 
diversity would be lost as stations com-
bined resources (signals, staffs, and facili-
ties). A few years later, the relaxation of the 
duopoly rules would raise similar concerns. 
Proponents argued that this was highly 
improbable given the vast number of fre-
quencies that light up the dial. In other 
words, there is safety in numbers, and the 
public will continue to be served. However, 
radio station general manager Pat McNally 
presciently observed, “In the long run LMAs 
and consolidation may cause a loss of avail-
able jobs in our business and help to con-
tinue the erosion of creative salesmanship 
and conceptual selling. Radio station sales 
staffs will become like small rep firms.”
In the 1990s, Century 21 Program-
ming’s Dave Scott observed that LMAs 
had inspired some interesting arrangements. 
“Some of the novel partnerships include 
a suburban station north of Atlanta that 
bought a suburban station south of Atlanta 
and created one studio to feed them both. 
A similar situation occurred in San ­Francisco/
San Jose, and I believe they’re on the same 
frequency (or maybe a notch apart). Around 
Los Angeles, someone got two or three sta-
tions on the same frequency. Necessity is the 
mother of invention, they say.”
Although many industry people were 
guardedly hopeful about the future of 
radio, many saw change as inevitable. “Major 
Many people consider 1991 to have been 
one of the worst years ever for radio. “As a 
result of the proliferation of stations, the 
excessively high prices paid for them during 
the deregulatory buying and selling binge 
of the late 1980s, and the recession, more 
than half of the stations in the country ran 
in the red,” observed Rick Sklar of Sklar 
Communications. (Mr. Sklar passed away 
shortly after this interview.)
Producer Ty Ford agreed with Sklar, 
adding, “The price fallout of the late 1980s 
and early 1990s was due in great part to the 
collapse of the property-value spiral that 
was started by deregulation and the nega-
tive effect that investors had on the broad-
casting business. This resulted in depressed 
or reduced salaries and an inability to make 
equipment updates due to the need to pay 
off highly leveraged station loans.”
According to leading radio consultant 
Kent Burkhart, “The recession in the first 
third of the 1990s crippled financing of 
radio properties. The banks were under 
highly leveraged transaction (HLT) rules 
regarding radio loans; thus the value of 
stations dropped by one-third to one-half. 
The recession created advertising havoc 
too. Instead of five-deep buys, we were 
looking for one through three deep. Emo-
tional sales pitches were rejected. Stations 
streamlined costs due to the economic 
slump. Airshifts were expanded and pro-
motion budgets slashed. The top ten to 
fifteen markets did reasonably well in the 
revenue column, but those markets outside 
of the top majors went searching for new 
ad dollars, which were difficult to find.” The 
total value of radio station sales declined 
65% in a 6-month period between 1990 
and 1991, and radio revenues dropped 4% 
during the same period, according to statis-
tics in Broadcasting magazine (September 
9, 1991). All of this took place during a 
time when operating expenses rose. These 
were troubling figures when compared to 
the salad days of 1988 when $5.8 billion 
was paid for 955 radio stations.
Cash flow problems were the order of the 
day, and this resulted (as Ty Ford pointed 
out) in significant budgetary cuts. This 
was made very evident by a report in the 
December 1991 issue of Broadcast Engineer-
ing magazine that stated, “All radio budgets 
Economics and Survival	
17

Then came the financial crash of 2008. 
The dramatic downturn in the economy 
impacted radio station values and brought 
a decline in advertisers, who were adjusting 
their budgets in light of the recession. Among 
the casualties was the Tribune Company. 
Observed its COO, Randy Michaels, at the 
time this text was being revised, “We aren’t 
quite on the ropes yet. We’re restructuring 
our debt, so we’ll be around for a while 
yet.” In the end, observes Entercom’s Oper-
ations Manager, Dave Neugesser, “While the 
economy may be wreaking havoc, just as 
important are the new audio platforms that 
have grown over the past 5 years. Radio has 
the unfortunate and unfair image of being 
viewed as ‘old’ media. There are newer, 
shinier objects that have become even sexier 
than radio, so the tide has turned away from 
the medium on multiple fronts. Hard work 
and ingenuity are key to its future success 
and survival.”
As 2008 came to an end, Nielsen’s 
“Media Week” reported, “For the second 
consecutive year, radio revenue is expected 
to drop 7% this year to $16.7 billion, the 
lowest total in more than five years. And 
that’s not even the bottom. Next year radio 
revenue could plummet 10%, going as low 
as $15 billion.”
Consolidations, Downsizings, 
and Clusters
As the medium entered the middle of the 
1990s, it was doing more than just fine. The 
headlines in the industry trade publications 
revealed exactly how well the medium had 
recovered: “Radio Draws Advertisers as 
Economy Strengthens” (Broadcasting, May 
1994), “Recovery” (Radio Ink, December 
1993), “Radio Revenues Hit One Billion 
in May” (Radio World, August 1994), 
“National Spot Revenue up 38%” (Broad-
casting, May 1995).
The primary cause of this dramatic 
upsurge was the relaxation of FCC rules, 
foremost among them station ownership 
caps and duopoly. With the advent of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, individ-
ual companies could own several stations 
in the same market (up to eight in large 
­adjustments are being made as the conse-
quence of the recent mini-crash. In the 
future, we will depend on fewer nonrevenue 
producers at stations. We’ll see less people 
per facility. The belt will be tightened for 
good,” notes Bill Campbell, former vice 
­president and general manager of WSNE-FM 
in ­Providence, Rhode Island.
Rick Sklar accurately predicted that 
­satellite-supplied stations would have a role 
in this. “To save money and stay in busi-
ness, large numbers of stations are going 
satellite and others are turning to suppliers 
of ­twenty-four-hour formats for their pro-
gramming because of the economic envi-
ronment.” (See Chapter 11 for more on 
syndicated programming.)
Fred Jacobs, president of Jacob’s Media, 
assessed the state of the Fifth Estate: “In 
the first third of the 1990s, everything 
seemed to be converging, and radio’s future 
was up in the air. Many operators were 
in debt and were feeling the pressures of 
a long economic recession. Similarly, the 
FCC was not providing regulatory focus. 
There was no consensus about the legal-
ity of LMAs, multiple station ownership in 
the same market, and so on. Format frag-
mentation had made for a more competi-
tive ­environment in most cities, including 
medium markets. The available revenue pie 
was now being split among more players. 
Like cable television, radio has become 
very niche-oriented. To make matters even 
more uncertain, Digital Audio Broadcast-
ing (DAB) was and remains a murky issue. 
It’s coming, but we don’t really have a fix 
on when and in what form. Will it create 
even more outlets? If so, where will exist-
ing broadcasters end up and what will be 
the value of their properties? Will there be 
enough advertising revenue to go around?”
Despite the medium’s shaky start in the 
1990s, publisher Eric Rhoads possessed a 
positive outlook. “I believe that radio is 
poised for a strong future over the next ten 
years. Cable is floundering in its local sales 
efforts, and TV is having huge problems. 
Nationally the networks are still high-priced 
and have reduced viewing. In the end, radio 
is the only stable medium. It is targeted and 
cost-effective. This fact will keep the indus-
try alive for a long time. Radio will survive 
and thrive.”

prompted by LMAs would pick up steam 
with the elimination of the duopoly rule, 
which prevented dual station ownership in 
the same market. Greater Media’s David 
Pearlman says, “The Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 is the biggest piece of ­legislation 
in radio history. It has changed everything.”
markets and no limits on national totals – at 
this writing, radio station ownership limits 
were being reviewed by the FCC), and 
this spurred active trading and mergers of 
broadcast properties. (See Figure 1.16.) The 
idea was to reduce competition and thus 
­overhead. The consolidation and ­downsizing

and profits are central to the concept behind 
downsizing and multiple ownership, the 
creative forces in radio are taking a hit. 
In point of fact, in the past few years no 
exciting new programming ideas have been 
developed.”
On this topic, Jay Williams, Jr., observes,
Many argue that consolidation is bad, charg-
ing that radio programming has become less 
innovative and diverse, that local radio news is 
in decline, and the lack of competition within 
each local market has driven up rates for adver-
tisers. Others counter that radio “research” 
combined with the demand for higher ratings 
had already eliminated programming innova-
tion. Proponents for consolidation point to 
the stations previously competing in the same 
format head-to-head that are now co-owned 
allowing one of the stations to carve out a 
new format. They suggest that television and 
24-hour cable news competition, plus the 
rising costs of radio news programming, had 
already precipitated the decline of radio news 
well before consolidation, and that new tech-
nologies, such as the continuous news updates 
on the Internet, have only accelerated the 
pace. And they point to the increasing variety 
of other media and promotional options open 
to advertisers as the reasons that radio rates 
will always remain competitive. It might be 
better if consolidation were viewed as being 
neither good nor bad but as a reaction to the 
changing realities of business.
Williams gives a brief overview of a major 
West Coast cluster inspired by the consoli-
dation approach:
Clear Channel’s greater San Diego cluster 
consists of 13 stations. They also oversee two 
additional suburban stations in Temecula, 
­California about 50 miles away. The Temecula 
stations simulcast two of the San Diego sta-
tions but add local content. The two suburban 
stations have a local sales manager and local 
sales staff. In addition to the stations, they also 
operate Clear Channel Traffic (similar to, but 
competitors of, Shadow and Metro traffic) and 
the Padres sports network as separate business 
entities out of this facility.
Despite the many concerns, business 
improved after the mid-1990s. The dollar 
volume of station transactions (number of 
stations changing hands) approved by the 
FCC soared. Entering the new millennium, 
the radio business was robust, to say the least. 
Annual revenues were heading toward the 
Observes Lynn Christian, “Consolidation – 
market by market – is the word best describ-
ing what was happening in commercial radio 
in the 1990s. The legal authority to own and 
operate several radio stations in almost every 
market has rapidly changed radio’s landscape. 
Radio station operators have become more 
like local cable operators, offering a variety 
of formats on the FM and AM dials.”
One alarming effect of consolidation and 
subsequent downsizing for aspiring broad-
casters is the reduction of available jobs. 
“Individual station staffs get small as com-
panies grow in station holdings. A direct 
result of duopoly softening and the increase 
in ownership limits is fewer jobs, more gen-
eralization, and less specialization. Jacks and 
Jills of all trades will be valuable. Group 
presidents will be taking jobs as station 
managers, especially in clusters or multiple 
station operations,” observes Ed Shane, pres-
ident of Shane Media.
Another concern inspired by consolida-
tion is the potential loss of programming 
diversity. Christian adds, “While cost savings

­financial community in the future of radio,” 
notes Ed  Shane. Bill Campbell, co-owner of 
Blue River Communications, says the future is 
now. “Wall Street is where much of the buying 
and selling of radio outlets occurs nowadays. 
Things have changed to where stations are sold 
through lawyers and brokerage houses more 
than they are from broadcaster to broadcaster. 
Those are pretty much bygone days, and that is 
kind of sad. It became the ‘three-piece-suiters’ 
game in the 1990s. There is little direct nego-
tiating, no bargaining between owners over 
a drink at the corner pub. Stations are com-
modities to be bought and sold by people who 
sometimes have little appreciation or under-
standing of what radio is really all about. Of 
course, the economic inertia of the first part 
of this decade inspired more direct negotia-
tions (strategic alliances) between owners, and 
I think that is good. I’m also detecting a move 
to drive the MBAs out of our business. Broad-
casters who gain general experience beyond 
just management are the future.”
$20 billion mark. A handful of radio corpo-
rations, many owning hundreds of stations, 
recorded yearly earnings in the billion-dollar 
range. However, by 2006, due to a variety 
of factors – namely increased competition, 
Radio Business Report and other industry 
publications were charting the downward 
trajectory of the medium’s annual revenues.
Meanwhile, the large radio station hold-
ings groups began downsizing the number 
of properties they owned. In fact, many 
mega  radio groups (like Clear Channel) 
returned to private ownership forsaking 
Wall Street. The trend in what is called 
“­de-consolidation” was well underway as 
this new edition was being prepared.
Buying and Selling
Today, brokerage firms handle the sale of 
many radio stations. “It’s difficult to over-
look the importance of Wall Street and the

audio broadcasting to level the playing field 
with FM.
Despite the bullishness of the past decade 
in the station acquisition market, Robin 
Martin, CEO of the Deer River Group, 
expresses concerns about the tactics used by 
station owners to keep property values high, 
“The radio industry is too defensive and is 
not pursuing innovative strategies for creating 
new streams of revenue. How the industry 
in general is responding to more competition 
and new technologies does not inform the 
average owner (not a major group owner) 
about how to succeed in this changing envi-
ronment on a local level. Each market, each 
owner, and each station will have unique 
sets of circumstances that would define 
the optimal strategies for that situation. As 
I visit different markets and talk with station 
owners and managers, I find that there are 
creative plans for success of many different 
types in markets of all size and characteristics. 
Forget what the overall industry pundits and 
reports say. Study the specific target market 
to understand how to develop the strategies 
that will begin or continue to generate adver-
tiser loyalty and the willingness to commit 
with more advertising and promotion money 
on the station. Radio generates enough rev-
enues in most markets to give individual 
owners opportunities to make good returns 
on their investments. Regardless of the dire 
news on the national level, there are successes 
to be earned in many markets. The difficult 
truth is that, with some exceptions for turn-
arounds, gone are the days of easy double-
digit increases in sales from traditional ad 
revenues. Cost control and the generation of 
creative concepts to increase advertiser sticki-
ness and new types of revenues are necessary 
ingredients for financial stability, growth, and 
enhanced station values.”
Media broker Doug Ferber offers some 
closing thoughts on the state of radio station 
values in the mid-2000s as well as an inter-
esting prediction, “Overall, things are down 
because advertising revenue is flat with no sign 
of growth rates getting back to mid-to-upper 
single digits any time soon. Listening levels of 
young demos are about the same despite views 
to the contrary (there’s recent research to 
support this). Satellite is dead as it exists today. 
It’s had a negligible effect on mainstream radio 
revenue. Check the stock prices.”
For their services, brokers receive an 
average commission of 7–8% on sales, and 
in some cases they earn additional incen-
tives based on the size of the transaction. 
In recent years, brokers have been very suc-
cessful in negotiating large profits for their 
clients (see Figure 1.18).
Brokerage firms promote the sale of sta-
tions through ads in industry trade maga-
zines, direct mailings, and appearances at 
broadcast conferences. Interested buyers are 
provided with all the pertinent data con-
cerning a station’s geographical location, 
physical holdings, operating parameters, 
programming, and income history, as well 
as economic, competitive, and demographic 
information about the area within reach of 
the station’s signal.
Another recent approach to the buying 
and selling of radio properties is the auction 
method, although this means of selling a 
station is perceived by some as a kind of 
last-resort effort at getting rid of profitless 
stations, most of which are AM. Owing to 
the upsurge in radio’s fortunes, this approach 
has declined.
The average price of an AM station in 
the late 1980s was $450,000, with some 
selling for as little as a few thousand dollars 
and others for as much as several million. 
In 1986 New York station WMCA-AM sold 
for $11  million, and in 1992, WFAN-AM 
received a bid of $70 million, proving that 
AM stations can still command enormous 
sums. In 2000, Clear Channel paid $24 billion 
for AMFM’s group of radio stations.
The average price for FM stations is higher 
than it is for AM. In the early 1990s the 
average price for an FM station exceeded 
several million, and in the mid-2000s was in 
the tens, if not hundreds, of millions. Mean-
while, at this writing, many AM outlets sell 
in the hundreds of thousands. For example, 
in the spring of 2006, Inside Radio reported 
that KJRG in Newton, Kansas, sold for 
$600,000 and WADA in western North 
Carolina went for $350,000.
Many AM broadcasters look for fulltime 
status, improved reception, and stereo to 
increase the value of their properties in the 
coming years, although the stereo ­conversion 
of the band is hardly seen as the panacea it 
once was. Perhaps most ­important is the fact 
that many await the conversion to digital 
22

to remain on their existing frequencies. 
This is something they favor, as satellite 
DAB signal transmission is regarded as a 
significant threat to the local nature of U.S. 
broadcasting. On the other hand, many 
countries are fully supportive of a satel-
lite DAB system because they do not have 
the number of stations the United States 
possesses and thus lack the coverage and 
financial investment.
Of course, digitized terrestrial radio 
(called HD Radio) renders existing analog 
receivers obsolete. This is cause for some 
anxiety among broadcasters who wonder 
how quickly the buying public will convert. 
However, considerable confidence exists 
since consumers’ huge appetitite for new 
and improved sound shows no sign of 
abating. As of this writing, several manu-
facturers are offering HD receivers at prices 
that are becoming more and more afford-
able and competitive and a number of car 
manufacturers provide HD Radio in their 
latest models. Digital converters are also 
available at a modest price.
Considered another plus of digital radio is 
its capacity to do other things. For example, 
iBiquity has developed a technology that 
allows those stations broadcasting digitally 
to transmit data to portable digital services, 
including cell phones. This is attractive 
to the station operator’s bottom line. The 
ability to multicast (provide side-channel 
transmissions) is yet another major plus 
for HD Radio. Known as HD2, it allows 
the medium to provide additional program 
streams (two to eight channels) to the lis-
tening audience.
America is a nation of audiophiles, demand-
ing high-quality sound. Analog broadcasting 
cannot compete with the interference-free 
Digital and HD  
Radio Revolution
DAB makes analog AM and FM outmoded 
systems. With the great popularity of home 
and portable digital music equipment (CD, 
MP3s, iPods), broadcasters are forced to 
convert their signals to remain competitive. 
Thus, DAB, or High Definition (HD) as it 
is more popularly called, looms large in the 
future of radio. The days of analog signal 
propagation are numbered. (For an explana-
tion of both digital and analog signaling, see 
Chapters 9 and 10.)
In the mid-1980s, compact disc players 
were introduced to the consumer market. 
Today, CD players no longer rank as the 
top consumer item for home music repro-
duction, because they have all but been 
replaced by iPods and MP3s. Turntables 
have long gone by the board, and the analog 
tape cassette market is consigned to the 
history books. Digital is here to stay, at least 
until something better comes along.
At first broadcasters viewed DAB as a 
threat. The National Association of Broad-
casters (NAB) looked at the new sound 
technology adversarially. In an interview 
in the July 23, 1990, issue of RadioWeek, 
John Abel, NAB’s executive vice president 
of operations, stated, “DAB is a threat and 
anyone who plans to stay in business for a 
while needs to pay careful attention.”
As time went on, DAB was regarded as 
a fait accompli, something that was simply 
going to happen. Soon broadcasters assumed 
a more proactive posture regarding the 
technology, and then the concern shifted to 
where to put the new medium and how to 
protect existing broadcast operations.
Early on, NAB proposed locating DAB 
in the L-band portion of the electromag-
netic spectrum. It also argued for in-band 
placement. Eventually the FCC saw fit to 
recommend that DAB be allocated room in 
the S-band, and it took its proposal to the 
World Administrative Radio Conference 
(WARC) held in Spain in February 1992. 
This spectrum designation is expected 
to help in-band terrestrial development. 
In-band, on-channel (IBOC) digital signal-
ing, developed by iBiquity Digital Corpora-
tion’s Glynn Walden, permits broadcasters

would operate effectively. The ­specifications 
included:
•	 CD-quality sound
•	 Enhanced coverage area
•	 Accommodation of existing AM and FM 
frequencies
•	 Immunity to multipath interference
•	 Immunity to stoplight fades
•	 No interference to existing AM and FM 
broadcasters
•	 DAB system interference immunity
•	 Minimization of transmission costs
•	 Receiver complexity
•	 Additional data capacity
•	 Reception area threshold
After nearly a century of analog signal 
transmission, radio is venturing into the 
digital domain, which will keep it relevant 
to the demands of a technologically sophis-
ticated listening marketplace as it embarks 
on its next 100 years. As of this writing 
­hundreds of radio stations across the country 
offer digital signals, and the majority are 
also providing expanded listening options 
with HD2 service. At several industry gath-
erings in the first half of the 2000s, former 
NAB president Eddie Fritts presciently pro-
claimed HD Radio as the wave of the medi-
um’s future, saying “Transitioning to digital 
will give radio even better opportunities to 
serve [its] listeners.”
Today, not all industry observers see HD/
HD2 as the solution to the drop in music 
radio listening. Observes Mark Ramsey of 
Mercury Media Research, “Will digital help 
reverse radio’s declining audience? Abso-
lutely not.” Counters Dave Neugesser, “It’s 
not something that’s going to happen over-
night. HD2 gives radio an infinite dial with 
incalculable choices, but it won’t impact the 
market as fast as some would like. Before this 
happens, it has to be standard equipment in 
new cars, and people have to buy HD radios. 
It’s a steep hill, but it can be surmounted.”
Satellite and Cable Radio
Radio broadcasters retain a wary eye on the 
ever-evolving digital audio services being 
made available by satellite companies (see 
Figure 1.20). It is the threat of increased 
reception and greater ­frequency dynamics 
of digital signals. Digital signaling heralds 
a new age in radio broadcasting. Jeff Tellis, 
former president of the IBS, explains why. 
“The reason for the great interest in digital 
broadcasting is its considerable number of 
advantages.” Among them are:
•	 Significantly improved coverage using sig-
nificantly less power
•	 Dramatic improvement in the quality of 
the signal; compare CD to vinyl
•	 More precise coverage control using mul-
tiple transmitters similar to cellular phone 
technology
•	 No adjacent channel reception problems
•	 On-channel booster capabilities eliminat-
ing the need to use separate frequencies 
to extend the same signal
•	 Easy transmission of auxiliary services, 
including format information, traffic, 
weather, text, and selective messaging 
services
•	 Sharing of transmitting facilities – common 
transmitter and antenna
Telecommunications professor Ernest 
Hakanen expands on the cost advantages 
of digital broadcasting. “DAB also promises 
to be economically efficient. Since there 
is no interstation interference between 
digital signals and because of the appeal 
of the spectrum efficiency provided by the 
interleaved environment, all of the channel 
operators in an area could utilize the same 
transmitter. The transmission facilities could 
be operated by a consortium for the con-
struction, operation, and maintenance of 
the common transmission plant. Antenna 
height for DAB systems is also lower than 
current FM standards. Electrical power con-
servation and savings are a huge advantage 
of DAB.”
Picking up on Hakanen’s point about 
consolidating broadcast operations, Lynn 
­Christian says, “The consortium (radio 
station malls or clusters) approach to main-
taining and operating a station is common-
place because of economic reasons, and HD 
Radio is very conducive to a collaborative 
relationship among broadcasters.”
Prior to the WARC meeting in 1992, 
NAB’s DAB Task Force proposed a set of 
standards to ensure that the technology 
24	
CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

Satellite radio is fee driven and offers 
a wide array of program options, which 
include an array of famous personalities, 
among them Howard Stern, Bob Dylan, 
and Martha Stewart. In all, satellite radio 
provides some 200 channels to subscrib-
ers. A monthly cost of $12.95 is charged 
for the coast-to-coast signals (continuously 
in receiver range), but subscribers also 
have to invest money for receiver equip-
ment. ­SiriusXM has signed contracts with 
car manufacturers to install their digital 
receivers and predicts the acquisition of an 
impressive segment of the drivetime listen-
ing audience in the not too distant future. At 
this writing, satellite radio was approaching 
14 million subscribers, which for a company 
whose primary revenue is based on “sign-
ups” is encouraging.
In the mid-2000s, many longtime broad-
cast radio listeners were making the switch 
to satellite for reasons similar to those 
articulated by media scholar and author 
­Christopher Sterling: “Like many older 
Americans, I used to listen to radio, espe-
cially in the car .  . . but in the past year 
here in Washington, the medium has left 
me in the lurch. I  used to listen to three 
stations (usually one at a time), but all have 
dumped friendly formats to slave after 
programming already available on other 
outlets in this market. The  main public 
radio station dropped a decades-long clas-
sical music and talk format to rely totally 
on the latter – including British talk shows 
that keep giving  me numbers I can call 
in London (I note with an ‘I told you so’ 
feeling that their audiences and donations 
are down as a result). The remaining com-
mercial classical music station got caught 
in a shift of Clear Channel station frequen-
cies and now uses a fringe transmitter that 
can’t put a decent signal into downtown. 
And most recently, the oldies station that 
competition that inspires concern for the 
new and evolving audio options. Although 
broadcasters have long employed satel-
lite programming and network services to 
enhance their over-the-air terrestrial signals, 
the idea of a direct-to-consumer alterna-
tive has not been greeted with enthusiasm, 
especially since these nonterrestrial signals 
are available in digital sound, something 
broadcasters are just beginning to offer. For 
several years, the FCC debated the ques-
tion of satellite radio. In the waning years 
of the 1990s, the feds gave licenses to com-
panies, such as CD Radio and XM Satellite 
Radio, to launch their services. Meanwhile, 
the NAB vociferously argued against its 
introduction into the local marketplace. 
Despite all the brouhaha, XM Satellite 
launched its service in September 2001 
and a year later claimed nearly a quarter of 
a million subscribers. Less than a year after 
XM Satellite rolled out its audio service, 
Sirius Satellite Radio debuted. It quickly 
became clear to terrestrial broadcasters 
that there was a new kid in town, one 
who would further accelerate the splinter-
ing of the radio listening audience. In 2008, 
both satellite radio services merged, with 
Mel Karmazin at the helm of the renamed 
SiriusXM.
Over the air broadcasters contend that 
their local orientation betters the services 
of the satellite audio companies, which 
are nationally based programmers. Former 
Infinity Broadcasting senior vice president, 
David Pearlman, says, “Broadcast radio 
is locally rooted and the satellite compa-
nies can’t fulfill that need at the present 
time. This will be its saving grace and 
aid in its ability to withstand this frontal 
attack. With its selling of local news, traffic, 
weather, events, personalities, and services, 
the product differentiation will work in the 
industry’s favor.”

a ­proposed royalty rate compromise bill, 
kn­own as the Small Webcaster Settlement 
Act (H.R. 5469), was passed by Congress. 
It was designed to mitigate the burden, so 
the future for the medium has brightened. 
Rates established by the Digital ­Millennium 
Copyright Act of 1998 had forced many 
radio broadcasters – both commercial and 
noncommercial – to reconsider their plans 
to Web cast. At the time radio industry 
publisher Eric Rhoads made this observa-
tion, “With the current fees, the econom-
ics do not make sense for anyone intent 
on building a business from this. Unless 
Congress steps in and makes a change, the 
RIAA fees are unreasonable and will kill 
the music side of online radio.”
Despite the upheaval resulting from the 
“pay for play” issue, most broadcasters felt 
that it was important to retain a Web pres-
ence, even if it meant offering no music 
programming. It was thought that stations 
broadcasting news, sports, talk, and other 
nonmusic forms of programming were the 
likeliest to remain in the webcasting busi-
ness. Maintaining a Web site for promotional 
purposes, even without audio streaming, 
was perceived as a worthwhile endeavor. 
Commented Jay Williams, Jr., “In the initial 
surge of the dot.com boom, radio stations 
rushed to create web sites that included 
station, music and local event information 
as well as billboard ads. After the Inter-
net bloom faded in 2001, many stations 
stopped streaming audio and many radio 
web sites languished. Station web sites are 
again considered essential, and streaming 
over the Internet is seen as a critical, addi-
tional distribution platform for terrestrial 
radio stations. As more national and local 
advertisers demand a web site presence as 
part of their radio buys, stations have also 
learned the benefits of using these sites to 
relate programming and promotion infor-
mation. Station web sites can give listeners 
direct and immediate access to personali-
ties and can be used for listener research, 
both of which can improve a station’s con-
nection with the audience and the on-air 
product.”
In spite of the formidable issues con-
fronting webcasters, the RAB determined 
that over 4000 stations were ­streaming 
their content as of April 2002, and ­Arbitron/
had played music from the 60s and 70s 
‘moved ahead’ and now focuses on the 
late 70s and the 80s. Why do programmers 
presume nobody of 55 matters? Thank 
heaven for satellite radio where genuine 
choice thrives. I almost never turn on a 
radio anymore.”
Former XM programming chief Lee 
Abrams discounted the potential impact on 
his medium of terrestrial HD Radio. “I’m 
pretty sure these guys will screw up HD. 
They’ll add a Blues channel but it’ll play 200 
blues songs and be run by guys who don’t 
know much about the blues beyond Stevie 
Ray Vaughn.” And about the potential of 
increased local programming on broadcast 
radio stations influencing the fate of his 
medium, Abrams said, “I doubt local radio 
will ever get back to the ­so-called ‘commu-
nity.’ In fact, they’re going the other way 
by cutting costs and taking on more remote 
voice track and syndicated programming.”
To compound the competition for 
the listening audience, cable companies 
provide in-home music services for most 
of their subscribers. For example, Comcast 
cable users receive more than 50 chan-
nels of music that are often quite niche 
specific. These ­commercial-free channels 
of diverse nonstop music, replete with on-
screen information about what is being 
played, are very attractive to subscribers 
and frequently result in the loss of yet 
another portion of traditional radio’s lis-
tening audience.
That said, many media observers believe 
satellite radio’s prospects for succeeding 
in the face of myriad new audio com-
petitors and mounting debt is not good. 
Jason ­Insalaco of The Kelton Agency says, 
“­Satellite radio’s subscription-based model 
has not yet reach critical mass, and I’m not 
sure it ever will.”
Internet Radio
In the early 2000s, many listeners accessed 
their favorite radio station via their com-
puters. However, with the specter of 
costly copyright royalty fees imposed on 
stations streaming music, their numbers 
dwindled and the future of Internet radio 
was cast in doubt. To mollify the situation,

tion from satellite, cable, and online sources. 
Those companies that are planning to 
partner with these new media choices, and 
develop data services, will undoubtedly be 
the big winners in the twenty-first century. 
Broadcast radio, as I have known it during 
the past 50 years, will not be the same in the 
next few years. But what American business 
is the same now? These are revolutionary 
times in radio and in the world.”
Jason Insalaco, observes:
Radio executives programming in the rapidly 
changing media landscape must embrace the 
technological revolution that is upon them. 
Cell phones, the Internet, MP3 players, the 
iPod, and videogames are vying for the audi-
ence’s attention. Programmers must heed these 
encroachments on terrestrial radio or else 
accept extinction. Rather than fear the new and 
evolving audio media, traditional radio needs to 
embrace it for its own benefit. Radio websites 
are great places for listeners to find out about 
the station’s personalities, music, contests, and 
events. Websites are ­cyber-extensions of the 
over the air station brand. Station websites also 
enhance audience interactivity and constitute 
another revenue source for a station.
Edison Media Research ­calculated that online 
radio listening actually grew from 14% in 
1999 to 23% in 2001. Meanwhile, Measure-
Cast reported that Internet radio  listening 
was continuing to grow a year later, so the 
practice was far from ­moribund. Radio Ink 
magazine  cited Jazz FM and Virgin Radio 
in London, L-Love Radio in Sacramento, 
ESPN Radio in ­Connecticut, and WQXR/
FM Radio in New York as the top five simul-
cast ­streamers during the summer of 2002.
Indeed, today stations continue to view 
the Internet as a viable supplement to their 
on-air signals, especially for promotion and 
audience research purposes. Interactive 
radio is a growing reality, as is the oppor-
tunity for everyone with the right com-
puter and software to be a broadcaster or 
­cybercaster. With an Internet encoder, the 
home user can transmit to an international 
audience. This prospect prompts a collective 
sigh from station managers, who are losing 
track of the new forms of competition.
Notes longtime broadcaster Lynn Chris-
tian, “The major concern regarding the 
future of radio is centered on new competi-

The Apple iPod 
represents yet 
another competitive 
threat to broadcast 
radio. The youth 
listening market 
has enthusiastically 
embraced the new 
audio alternative, 
causing further 
anxiety among 
already besieged 
radio station 
programmers and 
managers.
In 2009, the biggest challenge confront-
ing Internet presence related to fees charged 
to provide music. States Paul Kemp of 
­Backbone Networks, an Internet radio soft-
ware ­provider:
The performance royalty rates is probably 
the largest obstacle. Currently, in the US, there 
are a number of different rates and laws that 
apply to internet performance royalty rates. 
This includes the Small Webcasters Settlement 
that requires stations of a certain size to pay a 
percentage of their revenue. There is also the 
commercial Copyright Review Board (CRB) 
rate that requires internet radio stations to 
track performances of a particular piece. This 
rate escalates through next year [2009] when 
it is up for renewal again. The reason this is a 
big challenge for internet radio is that the rate 
is higher than for other broadcast mediums, 
like terrestrial and satellite broadcasts. If the 
rate was equal across all broadcast media we 
suspect there would be a rush to internet 
broadcasting because of the more precise lis-
tener statistics that can be generated and the 
opportunity to more precisely advertise to a 
particular target. The royalty rate discussion 
masks a broader issue that needs to be con-
fronted. The strength of the internet is that it 
is worldwide. As such an internet broadcaster 
would have to pay performance royalties to 
all of the Professional Rights Organizations 
where a connection terminates (the country 
from where the listener connects).
Cognizant of the many obstacles and chal-
lenges that exist in the age of the Internet, 
most radio broadcasters forecast a long-term 
relation between the two mediums, one that 
will benefit both. As radio heads warp speed 
into this “future world,” it is obvious that 
aspiring broadcasters will have to know their 
way around a computer, because the audio 
studio will exist both in the ether and in 
cyberspace. For those interested in this aspect 
of the medium, Radio and Internet Newslet-
ter (RAIN) provides a daily update on the 
key issues involving radio and the Internet.
Mobile Music Services
Cell phones, with music downloading capa-
bilities, and MP3s and iPods constitute the 
biggest competitive challenge to radio, and 
with the ever-expanding WiFi and WiMax 
universe, this will only increase. Mark 
Ramsey says, “We are fast-entering a time 
when ‘radio’ will become a feature of other 
things rather than simply a destination unto 
itself, as it has been up until now.” Although 
many media observers predict that down-
loading will continue to draw huge numbers 
of young listeners away from traditional 
radio, Emmis Communication’s VP of Pro-
gramming, Jimmy Steal, thinks otherwise:
I don’t agree that there is a mass exodus of 
young people away from radio to downloading 
media. According to the Paragon Media Youth 
Radio and New Media study conducted earlier 
this year (Spring 2008), 14–24 year old males 
and females who “listen to music on FM over 
the air more than they listen to music from 
other sources” surged from 27% in 2007 to 41% 
in 2008. All MP3 players need to be fed new 
music! Check out the latest generation Micro-
soft Zune model w/the built in FM receiver. You 
can bet Microsoft did a lot of research Before 
making this radio upgrade. Can we be doing an 
even better job of attracting young listeners? 
Absolutely, in the future radio needs to perme-
ate cell phones as well as all mobile media.
Steal’s boss at Emmis, Jeff Smulyan, 
agrees:
While there has been a migration to iPods, 
recent research indicates that most new music 
is discovered by traditional radio (65%). That’s 
why Zune has added a tagging device to its new 
Zunes, which lets people buy songs they hear 
on the radio included in the Zune. Our goal 
as an industry is to have a radio ­embedded in 
all portable devices (iPods, PDAs, and all cell 
28	
CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

phones) within the next five years We think 
radio is a perfect complement to portable music 
consumption in the future. Nearly half of all cell 
phones sold outside the United States include 
radios. There is a Paragon research study that 
was featured in The New York Times recently 
the showed that among younger listeners, radio 
consumption has actually increased in the last 
year as iPod fatigue begins to occur.
Michael A. Krasness, head of Oxysys, a 
mobile music networking service, expands 
on the virtues of his enterprise:
For the listener, traditional music radio – 
both over-the-air and Internet delivery – is 
about listening to tracks the user already 
knows, plus music discovery by the radio sta-
tion’s playlist, driven by an ad-based revenue 
model. Mobile music services add to that by 
allowing interactive user selection of music, 
active participation in the music discovery 
process, and social networking. As similar ad-
based revenue model may be ­augmented by 
e-commerce through integration of a store. 
Traditional radio certainly provides comple-
mentary services for our users. As a feature for 
our users, Oxy phling! includes simple, inte-
grated access to a number of Internet radio 
stations. For the radio station, they now have 
access to our community of mobile users.
With Pandora Radio, Slacker, and other 
Internet-based mobilized audio services 
likely venturing into nonmusic areas, such 
as talk and sports, the competitive threat 
to broadcast and satellite radio looms larger 
than ever. On the upside, Consultant Ed 
Shane says, “these services have new apps 
for mobile phones that allow reception of 
terrestrial radio.”
LPFM (Low-Power FM)
A microradio movement surfaced in the 
1990s and raised the ire of both broadcast 
regulators and the industry. The debate 
positioned the NAB against what it labeled 
radio “pirates.” After lengthy reflection, 
FCC Chairman William Kennard proposed 
rule-making designed to legitimize these 
unauthorized, tiny wattage outlets. The 
argument used to justify support of LPFMs 
cited the erosion of programming diversity 
in commercial radio as the ­consequence 
of widespread consolidation and mergers. 
According to Kennard this new species of 
broadcaster would give voice to those alien-
ated or disenfranchised by mainstream cor-
porate radio. The FCC’s proposal sought to 
create two types of new licenses on the FM 
band. Power would span 10 (LP10) to 100 
(LP100) watts with service areas restricted 
to three to nine miles. Among many stipu-
lations, the FCC requires that LPFM licens-
ees be nonprofit organizations. This rule 
helped placate commercial broadcasters’ 
concerns that the new category of stations 
would ­represent yet another competitive 
threat. The LPFM rules further require that 
this “sub” or ­“secondary” category of radio 
stations not interfere with the signals  of 
regular full power outlets. As the FCC 
states, “LPFM stations are not protected 
from interference that may be received 
from other classes of FM station.”
Perhaps the greatest threat to the ­existence 
of microstations is the looming conversion 
of regular radio outlets to IBOC digital. This 
will all but squeeze out any chance for the 
continued survival of the community-­centric 
medium. Meanwhile, many proponents of 
LPFM have been alarmed by the microme-
dium’s takeover by conservative religious 
broadcasters, which have been scooping up 
as many noncommercial frequencies (both 
primary and secondary) and translators as 
possible to spread their gospel.
Former executive director of now defunct 
Allston-Brighton 
Free 
Radio, 
Stephen 
Provizer, gives this view of the threatened 
medium. “As an open platform for all voices, 
we had two goals: to disseminate program-
ming that would otherwise be unavailable 
and to empower our participants which, to 
the greatest extent possible, encompassed 
the entire community. The first goal becomes 
increasingly important as the range of con-
sumer choice becomes narrower due to 
ongoing corporization and an obsession with 
demography-driven advertising. The second 
goal, participation, is driven by our belief that 
direct participation is the key to empower-
ment. If an individual in our media-drenched 
culture is going to be able to exercise critical 
judgment toward mainstream media, he or 
she must have the process demystified and 
clarified. Perhaps if media literacy educa-
tion was more available in lower school this 
would not be necessary, but such is not now 
and has never been the case.”

Radio and Government 
Regulations
Almost from the start it was recognized that 
radio could be a unique instrument for the 
public good. This point was never made 
more apparent than in 1912, when, accord-
ing to legend (which was recently challenged 
by scholars who contend that others were 
involved), a young wireless operator named 
David Sarnoff picked up the distress signal 
from the sinking Titanic and relayed the 
message to ships in the vicinity, which then 
came to the rescue of those still alive. The 
survivors were the ­beneficiaries of the first 
attempt at ­regulating the new medium. The 
Wireless Ship Act of 1910 required that 
ships carrying 50 or more passengers have 
wireless equipment on board. The effective 
use of the medium from an experimental 
station in New York City’s Wanamaker 
Building helped save 700 lives.
Radio’s first practical application was as a 
means of communicating from ship to ship 
and from ship to shore. During the first 
decade of the twentieth century, Marconi’s 
wireless invention was seen primarily as a 
way of linking the ships at sea with the rest 
of the world. Until that time, when ships 
left port they were beyond any conventional 
mode of communications. The wireless was 
a boon to the maritime services, including 
the Navy, which equipped each of its war-
ships with the new device.
Coming on the heels of the Titanic disas-
ter, the Radio Act of 1912 sought to expand 
the general control of radio on the domestic 
level. The secretary of commerce and labor 
was appointed to head the implementation 
and monitoring of the new legislation. The 
primary function of the act was to license 
wireless stations and operators. The new 
regulations empowered the Department of 
Commerce and Labor to impose fines and 
revoke the licenses of those who operated 
outside the parameters set down by the 
communications law.
Growth of radio on the national level was 
curtailed by World War I, when the gov-
ernment saw fit to take over the medium 
for military purposes. However, as the war 
raged on, the same young wireless operator, 
David Sarnoff, who supposedly had been 
instrumental in saving the lives of passen-
gers on the ill-fated Titanic, was hard at 
work on a scheme to drastically modify 
the scope of the medium, thus convert-
ing it from an experimental and maritime 
communications apparatus to an appliance 
designed for use by the general public. Less 
than 5 years after the war’s end, receiv-
ers were being bought by the millions, and 
radio as we know it today was born.
As explained earlier, the lack of regu-
lations dealing with interference nearly 
resulted in the premature end of radio. 
By 1926 hundreds of stations clogged the 
airways, bringing pandemonium to the dial. 
The Radio Act of 1912 simply did not 
anticipate radio’s new application. It was 
the Radio Act of 1927 that first approached 
radio as a mass medium. The Federal Regu-
latory Commission’s five commissioners 
quickly implemented a series of actions that 
restored the fledgling medium’s health.
The Communications Act of 1934 
charged  a seven-member commission with 
the responsibility of ensuring the efficient 
use of the airways, which the government 
views as a limited resource that belongs 
to the public and is leased to broadcasters. 
Over the years the FCC has concentrated 
its efforts on maximizing the usefulness of 
radio for the public’s benefit. Consequently, 
broadcasters have been required to devote 
a portion of their airtime to programs that 
address important community and national 
issues. In addition, broadcasters have had 
to promise to serve as a constant and reli-
able source of information, while retaining 
certain limits on the amount of commercial 
material scheduled.
The FCC has steadfastly sought to keep 
the medium free of political bias and 
­special-interest groups. In 1949, the com-
mission implemented regulations making it 
necessary for stations that present a view-
point to provide an equal amount of airtime 
to contrasting or opposing viewpoints. The 
Fairness Doctrine obliged broadcasters “to 
afford reasonable opportunity for the dis-
cussion of conflicting views of public impor-
tance.” Later, it also stipulated that stations 
notify persons when attacks were made on 
them over the air.
Although broadcasters generally acknowl-
edge the unique nature of their business, many 
30	
CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

have felt that the government’s involvement 
has exceeded reasonable limits in a society 
based on a free-enterprise system. Because 
it is their money, time, and energy they are 
investing, broadcasters feel they should be 
afforded greater opportunity to determine 
their own programming.
In the late 1970s, a strong movement 
headed by Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin 
sought to reduce the FCC’s role in broad-
casting, to allow the marketplace to dictate 
how the industry conducted itself. Van 
Deerlin actually proposed that the Broad-
cast Branch of the commission be abolished 
and a new organization with much less 
authority be created. His bill was defeated, 
but out of his and others’ efforts came a 
new attitude concerning the government’s 
hold on the electronic media. President 
Reagan’s antibureaucracy, free-enterprise 
philosophy gave impetus to the deregu-
lation move already under way when he 
assumed office. The FCC, headed by Chair-
man Mark Fowler, expanded on the deregu-
lation proposal that had been initiated by 
his predecessor, Charles Ferris. The deregu-
lation decision eliminated the requirement 
that radio stations devote a portion of their 
airtime (8% for AM and 6% for FM) to 
nonentertainment programming of a public 
affairs nature. In addition, stations no longer 
had to undergo the lengthy process of ascer-
taining community needs as a condition of 
license renewal, and guidelines pertaining 
to the amount of time devoted to commer-
cial announcements were eliminated. The 
rule requiring stations to maintain detailed 
program logs was also abolished. A sim-
plified postcard license renewal form was 
adopted, and license terms were extended 
from 3 to 7 years. In a further step the com-
mission raised the ceiling on the number of 
broadcast outlets a company or individual 
could own from 7 AM, 7 FM, and 7 televi-
sion stations to 12 each. As of March 1992, 
the FCC saw fit to raise the caps on owner-
ship again, this time to 30 AM and 30 FM. 
Later in the year, these were reduced to 18 
AM and 18 FM. Three years later, with a 
Republican Congress in place, a new tele-
communications bill proposed to eliminate 
ownership caps completely. The bill also 
sought to relax the cross-ownership rule, 
which kept a single entity from ­possessing 
a radio, TV, and newspaper company in 
the same market. Meanwhile, radio license 
terms were to be raised to 10 years.
On August 4, 1987, the FCC voted to 
eliminate the 38-year-old Fairness ­Doctrine, 
declaring it unconstitutional and no longer 
applicable to broadcasters. A month before, 
President Reagan had vetoed legislation that 
would have made the policy law.
The extensive updating of FCC rules 
and policy was based on the belief that the 
marketplace should serve as the primary 
regulator. Opponents of the reform feared 
that with their newfound freedom, radio 
stations would quickly turn their backs 
on community concerns and concen-
trate their full efforts on fattening their 
pocketbooks.
Those who support the position that 
broadcasters should first serve the needs 
of society are concerned that deregula-
tion (unregulation) has further reduced 
the medium’s “good citizen” role. “Radio, 
­especially the commercial sector, has long 
since fallen down on its ‘interest, conve-
nience, and necessity’ obligation born of 
the  Radio Act of 1927. While a small 
segment of  the industry does exert an 
effort to address the considerable prob-
lems facing society today, the overwhelm-
ing majority continue to be fixated on 
the financial bottom line. There needs to 
be more of a balance,” observes Robert 
Hilliard, former FCC chief of public and 
educational broadcasting. Proponents of 
deregulation applauded the FCC’s actions, 
contending that the listening audience 
would indeed play a vital role in deter-
mining the programming of radio stations, 
because the medium has to meet the needs 
of the public to prosper.
Although the government continues to 
closely scrutinize the actions of the radio 
industry to ensure that it operates in an effi-
cient and effective manner, it is no longer 
perceived as the fearsome, omnipresent 
Big Brother it once was. Today, broadcast-
ers more fully enjoy the fruits of a laissez-
faire system of economy, although they are 
not immune to commission actions (see 
Figure 1.24).
In the spring of 1996, the Telecom-
munications bill (made a Telecommuni-
cations Act) mentioned earlier became a 
Radio and Government Regulations

reality, and ownership caps were all but 
eliminated. The act opened the floodgates 
for those radio groups wanting to vastly 
expand their portfolios. For example, by 
2002, Clear Channel Radio had acquired 
nearly 1400 stations. Consequently, by the 
mid-2000s, localism had taken a substan-
tial hit, as many of the major radio groups 
had replaced the indigenous broadcasts of 
their stations with voice-tracking and “out-
of-town” programming.
In terms of what interests the FCC most 
regarding station acquisition, radio group 
CEO Robin Martin offers the following 
view: “Over the last decade and more, the 
Commission has relaxed the bureaucratic 
requirements for approval of the transfer 
of licenses to new owners. Most of the 
questions on the forms can be answered 
by checking boxes. However, simple as 
this process might seem, the check marks 
a new owner places in the boxes repre-
sent legal certifications by the proposed 
licensee and should not be taken lightly. 
The FCC has great interest in a certain 
few areas that qualify as threshold ques-
tions of eligibility to be a license holder. 
The percentage of foreign ownership is 
but one example. If the answers to these 
questions do not comply with FCC rules 
and regulations, the transfer will not be 
approved. However, all the ­non-threshold 
questions, while not ­necessarily individu-
ally disqualifying, may in  the aggregate 
lead the FCC staff to inquire further 
about the response to clarify the details 
or to understand if the application is 
fatally defective or can be corrected or 
amended with supplemental information. 
The most important issue for the FCC is 
honesty. If an applicant answers a ques-
tion dishonestly, the Commission will take 
swift action against the applicant should 
it discover falsehoods. The consequences 
of not being truthful with the Commis-
sion are more dire than if the answer was 
truthful and required more explanation 
or even a waiver of the rules. It’s there-
fore important to understand the meaning 
or implications of the questions to avoid 
unwittingly answering incorrectly. Attor-
neys need to be consulted before applica-
tions are submitted.”
Prominent broadcast attorney Erwin 
Krasnow provides the following summary 
pertaining to the downsizing trend of the 
past two decades in FCC regulations for 
radio broadcasters. “The world of FCC regu-
lation has changed dramatically. No more 
ascertainment. No more Fairness Doctrine 
(William Paley once quipped that the Fair-
ness Doctrine was like the Holy Roman 
Empire, which was neither Holy, Roman, 
nor an Empire). No regulation of call signs 
or submission of Annual Financial Reports. 
Virtually all applications and forms are now 
filed electronically, many without the assis-
tance of a communication lawyer. Rather 
than terms of three years, licenses are now 
renewed for eight years (that’s a long time; 
a common law marriage results after only 
seven years).”
Mr. Krasnow waxes poetically about 
the situation in “Deregulation: A Lawyer’s 
Lament”:
Martin, Tate, and McDowell are proceeding 
with deregulation en masse,
But nobody’s thought of the lawyers who 
subsist on the present morass.
When Arcane comparative hearings
Have been paying the partnership’s bills
It will not be an easy conversion to torts and 
divorces and wills.
Plain language rules will be all that are left
No “wherefores” and “hereins” and such
Treasured old forms will be thrown on 
the fire
And for lunch we’ll be forced to go 
Dutch.
So pity your struggling lawyer
Who has served at your side for so long
And write to your Congressman promptly 
to tell him that “deregulation” is wrong.
Jobs and Equality in Radio
Today, the radio industry continues to 
employ tens of thousands, but with all 
the downsizing and consolidation and the 
increase in new and competitive audio 
media, this figure has eroded and likely

will continue to do so in the coming years. 
WBZ/WODS general manager, Ted Jordan, 
says, “Consolidation is causing a lack of a 
career path because so many middle and 
upper management positions have been 
eliminated.” Jim Robertson, vice presi-
dent of Dix Communication, concurs and 
adds, “Consolidation has affected employ-
ment for on air positions and promotion 
jobs due to staffing cutbacks. However, 
if graduates are willing to hit the streets 
selling, things are better.” Since 1972, 
75,000 individuals have found full-time 
employment in radio. Today, opportuni-
ties for women and minorities are greater 
than ever. Until fairly recently, radio has 
been a male-dominated profession (and in 
some respects still is). In 1975, men in the 
industry outnumbered women nearly four 
to one. But that has changed. Now women 
are being hired more than ever before, and 
not just for office positions. Women have 
made significant inroads into program-
ming, sales, and management positions, 
and there is no reason to think that this 
trend will not continue. Ed Shane says, 
“Females have made exceptional inroads, 
especially in sales.” It will take a while, 
however, before an appropriate propor-
tion of women and minorities are working 
in the medium. The FCC’s insistence on 
equal opportunity employment within the 
broadcast industry makes prospects good 
for all who are interested in broadcasting 
careers.
Still there is room for improvement in 
the participation levels of different ethnic 
groups in the radio industry. NAB’s former 
vice president for human resources, Dwight 
Ellis, says, “Current employment trends 
reported by the FCC reveal very little growth 
between 1980 and 1999 in Native American 
broadcast employment, for example. Other 
groups have experienced slow growth too. 
The NAB is committed to assisting the 
growth of employment and station owner-
ship for minorities in the industry. The NAB 
has been a vanguard for minority progress 
in broadcasting. Nevertheless, more must 
be done.”
A common misconception is that a radio 
station consists primarily of deejays with 
few other job options available. Wrong! 
Nothing could be farther from the truth.

Granted, deejays comprise an important 
part of a station’s staff, but many other 
employees are necessary to keep the station 
on the air.
An average-size station in a medium 
market used to employ between 18 and 26 
people, but today due to consolidation, a 
fraction of that number may be used where 
several stations form a cluster or radio mall, 
and on-air personnel may comprise most 
of that figure. Stations are usually broken 
down into three major areas: sales, pro-
gramming, and engineering. Each area, in 
particular the first two, requires a variety 
of people for positions that demand a wide

schools and colleges offer courses in radio 
broadcasting, and most award certificates or 
degrees. As in most other fields today, the 
more credentials a job candidate possesses, 
the better he or she looks to a prospective 
employer.
Perhaps no other profession weighs prac-
tical, hands-on experience as heavily as 
radio does. This is especially true in the 
on-air area. On the programming side, it is 
the individual’s sound that wins the job, not 
the degree. However, it is the formal train-
ing and education that usually ­contribute 
most directly to the quality of the sound 
that the program director is looking for 
when hiring. In reality, only a small per-
centage of radio announcers have college 
degrees (the number is growing), but sta-
tistics have shown that those who do stand 
a better chance of moving into managerial 
positions.
Many station managers look for the 
­college-educated person, particularly for 
the areas of news and sales. Before 1965, 
the percentage of radio personnel with 
college training was relatively low. But the 
figure increased as more and more colleges 
added broadcasting curricula. Thousands 
of communications degrees are conferred 
annually, thus providing the radio industry 
a pool of highly educated job candidates. 
Today, college training is a plus (if not a 
necessity) when searching for employment 
in radio. The job application or resume 
that lists practical experience in addition 
to formal training is most appealing. The 
majority of colleges with radio curricula 
have stations. These small (low-power) 
outlets provide the aspiring broadcaster 
with a golden opportunity to gain some 
much needed on-air experience. Some of 
the nation’s foremost broadcasters began 
their careers at college radio stations. Many 
of these same schools have internship pro-
grams that provide the student with the 
chance to get important on-the-job train-
ing at professional stations. Again, experi-
ence is the key, and it rates high to the 
prospective employer. Small commercial 
stations often are willing to hire broad-
cast students to fill part-time and vacation 
slots. This constitutes professional experi-
ence and is an invaluable addition to the 
resume.
How FCC Rules Are Made
Provided by FCC
I. Initiation of Action
  Suggestions for changes to the FCC Rules and
Regulations can come from sources outside of the
Commission either by formal petition, legislation,
court decision or informal suggestion. In addition,
a Bureau/Office within the FCC can initiate a
Rulemaking proceeding on its own.
II. Bureau/Office Evaluation
   When a petition for Rulemaking is received, it is 
sent to the appropriate Bureau(s)/Office(s) for 
evaluation. If a Bureau/Office decides a particular 
petition is meritorious, it can request that the 
Dockets department assign a Rulemaking 
number to the petition.
   A similar request is made when a Bureau/ Office 
decides to initiate a Rulemaking procedure on its 
own. A weekly notice is issued listing all accepted 
petitions for Rulemaking. The public has 30 days 
to submit comments. The Bureau/Office then has 
the option of generating an agenda item 
requesting one of four actions by the Commision.
If a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) or Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRM) is issued, a docket is
instituted and a docket number is assigned.
III. Possible Commission Actions
   Major changes to the Rules are presented to the
public as either an NOI or NPRM. The Commis-
sion will issue an NOI when it is simply asking
for information on a broad subject or trying to
generate ideas on a given topic. An NPRM is
issued when there is a specific change to the
Rules being proposed.
  If an NOI is issued, it must be followed by ei-
ther an NPRM or a Memorandum Opinion and
Order (MO&O) concluding the inquiry.
IV. Comments and Replies Evaluated
   When an NOI or NPRM has been issued, the
public is given the opportunity to comment
initially, and then respond to the comments that
are made. When the Commission does not 
receive sufficient comments to make a decision, a 
further NOI or NPRM may be issued.
   It may be determined that an oral argument 
before the Commission is needed to provide an
opportunity for the public to testify before the
Commission, as well as for the Bureau(s)/
Office(s) to present diverse opinions concerning 
the proposed Rule change.
V. Report and Order Issued
   A Report and Order is issued by the Commis-
sion stating the new or amended Rule, or stating 
that the Rules will not be change. The proceeding 
may be terminated in whole or in part.
   The Commission may issue additional Report 
and Orders in the docket.
VI. Reconsideration Given
     Petitions for reconsideration may be filed by the
public within 30 days. They are reviewed by the
appropriate Bureau(s)/Office(s) and/or by the
Commission.
VII. Modification Possible
As a result of its review of a petition for
reconsideration, the Commission may issue an
MO&O modifying its initial decision or denying
the petition for reconsideration.

Entry-level positions in radio seldom pay 
well. In fact, many small-market stations 
pay near minimum wage. However, the 
­experience gained at these small-budget 
operations more than makes up for the 
small salaries. The first year or two in radio 
constitutes the dues-paying period, a time 
in which a person learns the ropes. The 
small radio station provides inexperienced 
people with the chance to become involved 
in all facets of the business. Rarely does a 
new employee perform only one function. 
For example, a person hired as a deejay will 
often prepare and deliver newscasts, write 
and produce commercials, and may even 
sell airtime.
To succeed in a business as unique as 
radio, a person must possess many quali-
ties, not the least of which are determi-
nation, skill, and the ability to accept and 
formed in 1928, and Mutual Broadcasting 
System (MBS) followed in 1934. American 
Broadcasting Company (ABC), formed in 
1945, became the largest and most suc-
cessful radio network.
6.  Early station proliferation led to overlap-
ping signals. Signal quality decreased, as did 
listenership. The Radio Act of 1927 formed 
the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), a five-
member board authorized to issue station 
licenses, allocate frequency bands, assign fre-
quencies to individual stations, and dictate 
station power and hours of ­operation. The 
FRC established the ­Standard Broadcast 
band (500–1500 kc).
7.  Radio prospered during the Depression 
by providing cost-free entertainment and 
escape from the harsh financial realities. 
Amos ‘n’ Andy, which made its debut in 
1929, was the most popular radio show in 
history. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 
C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
1.  With nearly 14,000 radio stations in the 
United States, radio is the most available 
source of entertainment, companionship, 
and information.
2.  Guglielmo Marconi is generally consid-
ered  the father of radio, although  David 
Sarnoff and Lee Deforest are likely 
contenders.
3.  As early as 1922, the Department of 
­Commerce set aside two frequencies for 
radio broadcasts. WEAF in New York and 
WGI in Boston aired the first commercials.
4.  Today, most radio networks have been 
subsumed by major corporations (Disney, 
GE, Viacom, Westwood One).
5.  Station networks, first called chain 
broadcasting, operated as early as 1922. 
Radio Corporation of America (RCA) 
formed the first major network in 1926, the 
National Broadcasting Company (NBC). 
Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) was 
benefit from constructive criticism. A 
career in radio is like no other, and the 
rewards, both personal and financial, can be 
­exceptional. “It’s a great business,” says Lynn 
­Christian, former senior vice president of 
the Radio Advertising Bureau. “No two days 
are alike. I recommend it over other career 
opportunities.”

FIGURE 1.28
Presidents have 
long recognized the 
value of radio as 
a communication 
medium.
fireside chats began on March 12, 1933. The 
Communications Act of 1934 established 
the seven-member Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC).
8.  World War II led the FCC to freeze con-
struction of new broadcast outlets; there-
fore, existing AM outlets prospered.
9.  Two years after the end of the war, 
­television usurped the home entertainment 
leadership.
10.  The Bell Lab scientists’ invention of 
the transistor in 1948 helped save radio by 
providing portability. Music became radio’s 
mainstay.
11.  The Top 40 radio format, conceived 
about the same time as the emergence 
of rock music, became the most popular 
format with younger audiences.
12.  Edwin H. Armstrong developed the 
static-free FM band in 1938. The FCC 
authorized stereo FM broadcasting in 1961, 
and in 1965 it separated FM from AM simul-
casts in cities with populations in  excess 
of 100,000. Beautiful Music was the first 
popular format on FM, which relied heavily 
on automation. The progressive format 
focused on album cuts rather than Top 40. 
By the mid-1980s, FM ­possessed 70% of the 
listening audience.
13.  Today, FM often commands up to 80% 
of the audience, although some AM stations 
top their market ratings.
14.  The Corporation for Public ­Broadcasting 
was established in 1967. Three years 
later, National Public Radio began pro-
viding 
funding 
and 
programming 
to 
member ­stations. More than 800 schools 
and ­colleges  hold noncommercial radio 
licenses.
15.  Narrowcasting is specialized program-
ming. Frag-out refers to the fragmenta-
tion of audience because of numerous 
formats.
16.  Highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) 
created economic problems for many 
stations. 
Local 
marketing 
agreements 
(LMAs) allowed broadcasters to form con-
tracts with one another for mutually ben-
eficial purposes.
17.  Consolidation, downsizing, and mergers 
have been prompted by the FCC’s relaxa-
tion of the duopoly and ownership rules.
18.  Seventy percent of radio’s revenues 
come from local spot sales.
19.  Brokerage firms handle the sale of most 
radio stations. Brokers receive a commission 
of between 7 and 8% on sales.
20.  Digital audio broadcasting (DAB), pop-
ularly called High-Definition (HD) Radio, 
is in the process of replacing the conven-
tional analog system of signal transmission 
and reception.
21.  Satellite and cable radio services are 
providing listeners with options besides 
­traditional terrestrial signal reception.
22.  Radio Web sites, once beset by copy-
right issues, have become an central part of 
station operations and are used to promote 
programming and interact with listeners.

unconstitutional and eliminated it. In 2009, 
with a new democratic administration in 
the White House, there was speculation the 
Fairness Doctrine may be restored.
26.  The Republicans wrote a new telecom-
munications bill designed to lift significant 
sanctions from broadcasters. The Telecom-
munications Act of 1996 all but eliminated 
radio station ownership ceilings, result-
ing in the reduction in the level of local 
programming.
27.  The radio industry employs fewer 
people today due to consolidations and 
the subsequent downsizings. Women and 
­minorities have made significant gains in 
recent years. A combination of practical 
experience and formal training remains 
the best preparation for a career in 
broadcasting.

medium-market

Consolidation has 
resulted in many 
new and revised 
positions.
Station Web sites also provide secondary 
revenue opportunities.
23.  Mobile music services spawned by the 
Internet, WiFi, and cell phones draw listen-
ers away from traditional radio, although it 
is anticipated that broadcast and satellite 
radio will become an integral part of these 
audio sources.
24.  Micro- or low-power FM stations consti-
tute a new category of noncommercial radio 
outlets, but the conversion to IBOC digital 
by regular broadcast outlets and the take-
over by religious broadcasters may mean 
the end to the community (neighborhood)-
oriented medium.
25.  In 1949, the FCC formulated the Fair-
ness Doctrine, which obligated broadcast-
ers to present opposing points of view. 
In 1987 the FCC declared the doctrine

Today’s broadcast radio has lost 
several of its former major components. 
First, the introduction of new popular 
music is being overtaken by the Internet 
and other personal electronic media 
choices. Large segments of the radio 
audience no longer go to the radio 
to discover a new recording artist, a 
new release or experimental alternative 
bands or singers. This is a big loss for 
program directors and on-air talent. 
Second, local news is still important to 
radio listeners, but national news has 
been moving away from both radio 
and television networks for the last 10 
years. Cable and satellite networks 
are now, combined, the major source 
for both National and International 
news programming. Only NPR News 
seems to be growing. Third, talk radio 
remains very important to the media, 
especially on the AM dial, but it’s 
being marginalized by the services of 
the half-dozen 24-hour news, sports, 
financial, and weather cable networks 
and by the general national opinion 
that most of talk radio is controlled by 
conservative or right-wing commentators 
and networks. Talk radio is becoming 
stagnant. The only politically liberal 
network, Air America, has had a rocky 
life and short life. Christian radio on 
FM and AM is also diluting much of 
AM’s talk radio audience, too. Trouble-
some times for radio in the midst of an 
economic recession, yet challenging for 
those entrepreneurial professionals who 
believe radio’s problems as we near 
the end of the millennium’s first decade 
are bottoming out.

CHAPTER 1 State of the Fifth Estate

a ­consequence, members of the air staff 
often are regarded as transients or passers-
through by not only the community but 
also the other members of the station’s staff. 
Less likely to come and go are a station’s 
administrative and technical staff. Usually 
they are not looking toward the bright lights 
of the bigger markets, since the town in 
which the station is located is often home 
to them. A small station’s sales department 
may experience some turnover but usually 
not to the degree that the programming 
department does. Sales people also are 
likely to have been recruited from the ranks 
of the local citizenry, whereas air personali-
ties more typically come from outside the 
community.
Running a station in a small market 
presents its own unique challenges (and it 
should be noted that half of the nation’s 
radio outlets are located in communities 
with fewer than 25,000 residents). Sta-
tions in larger markets, however, typically 
are faced with stiffer competition and fates 
that are often tied directly to ratings. In con-
trast to station WXXX in the small Maine 
community, where the closest other station 
is 50 miles away and therefore no com-
petitive threat, an outlet located in a met-
ropolitan area may share the airwaves with 
30 or more other broadcasters. Competition 
is intense, and radio stations in large urban 
areas usually succeed or fail based on their 
showing in the latest listener surveys. The 
metro market station manager must pay 
close attention to what surrounding broad-
casters are doing, while striving to main-
tain the best product possible to retain a 
­competitive edge and prosper.
Station Management 2
Nature of the Business
Radio station management has changed 
­dramatically in just the past few years. 
Indeed, in most markets, especially in larger 
ones, things have gone from managing a 
single or combo outlet to overseeing the 
operations of a half dozen or more, often 
clustered in the same building. On top of 
that, the station manager must now compete 
with new audio media that did not exist at 
the start of this century. Were these not 
enough, compounding the manager’s chal-
lenge is a host of other external factors, fore-
most among them being the up-and-down 
economy (mostly down at this writing) and 
changes in the regulatory landscape.
Of course, some things remain the same. 
As has always been the case, the medium’s 
unique character requires that the manager 
deal with a broad mix of people, from 
on-air personalities to secretaries and from 
sales personnel to technicians. Few other 
businesses can claim such an amalgam of 
employees. Even the station manager of the 
smallest outlet with as few as six or eight 
employees must direct individuals with very 
diverse backgrounds and goals. For example, 
radio station WXXX in a small Maine com-
munity may employ three to four full-time 
air people, who likely were brought in from 
other areas of the country. The deejays have 
come to WXXX to begin their broadcasting 
careers with plans to gain some necessary 
experience and move on to larger markets. 
Within a matter of a few months, the station 
will probably be looking for replacements.
Frequent turnover of on-air person-
nel at small stations is a fact of life. As 
45 

sonable government intervention have made 
the life of the station manager somewhat less 
complicated. Nevertheless, the ­government 
continues to play an important role in 
­American radio, and managers who value 
their license wisely invest energy and effort 
in  fulfilling federal conditions. After all, a 
radio station without a frequency is just a 
building with a lot of expensive equipment.
The listener’s perception of the radio busi-
ness, even in this day and age when nearly 
every community with a small business dis-
trict has a radio station, is often unrealistic. 
Film and television’s portrayal of the radio 
station as a hotbed of zany characters and 
bizarre antics has helped foster a misconcep-
tion. This is not to suggest that radio stations 
are the most conventional places to work. 
Because it is the station’s function to provide 
entertainment to its listeners, it must employ 
creative people, and where these people are 
gathered, be it a small town or a large city, 
the atmosphere is certain to be charged. “The 
volatility of the air staff’s emotions and the 
oscillating nature of radio itself actually dis-
tinguishes our business from others,” observes 
­Kentucky station manager J.G. Salter.
Faced with an audience whose needs and 
tastes sometimes change overnight, today’s 
radio station has become adept at shifting 
gears as conditions warrant. What is currently 
popular in music, fashion, and leisure-time 
activities will be nudged aside tomorrow 
by something new. This, says broadcast 
manager Randy Lane, forces radio stations 
to stay one step ahead of all trends and 
fads. “Being on the leading edge of Ameri-
can culture makes it necessary to undergo 
more changes and updates than is usually 
the case in other businesses. Not adjusting 
to what is currently in vogue can put a 
station at a distinct disadvantage. You have 
to stay in touch with what is happening in 
your own community as well as the trends 
and cultural movements occurring in other 
parts of the country.” The complex internal 
and external factors that derive from the 
unusual nature of the radio business make 
managing today’s station a formidable chal-
lenge. Perhaps no other business demands 
as much from its managers. Conversely, few 
other businesses provide an individual with 
as much to feel good about. It takes a special 
kind of person to run a radio station.
Meanwhile, the government’s percep-
tion of the radio station’s responsibility to 
its consumers also sets it apart from other 
industries. Since its inception, radio’s busi-
ness has been Washington’s business, too. 
Station managers, unlike the heads of most 
other enterprises, have had to conform to the 
dictates of a federal agency especially con-
ceived for the purpose of overseeing their 
activities. Failing to satisfy the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC)’s expecta-
tions can result in stiff penalties such as fines 
and even the loss of an operating license; as 
a result, radio station managers have been 
obliged to keep up with a fairly prodigious 
volume of rules and regulations.
The 1980s and 1990s deregulation actions 
designed to unburden the broadcaster of 
what had been regarded by many as unrea-

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

The Manager as Chief 
Collaborator
There are many schools of thought con-
cerning the approach to managing a radio 
station. For example, there are the standard 
X, Y, and Z models or theories of man-
agement (which admittedly oversimplify 
the subject but give the neophyte a basic 
working model). The first theory embraces 
the idea that the general manager is the 
captain of the vessel, the primary authority, 
with solemn, if not absolute, control of the 
decision-making process. The second theory 
casts the manager in the role of collaborator 
or senior advisor. The third theory forms a 
hybrid of the preceding two; the manager 
is both a coach and a team player, or the 
chief collaborator. Of the three models, 
broadcast managers tend to favor the third 
approach.
Lynn Christian, who has served as the 
general manager of several major market radio 
stations, preferred working for a manager 
who used the hybrid model rather than the 
purely authoritarian model. “Before I entered 
upper management, I found that I performed 
best when my boss sought my opinion and 
delegated responsibility to me. I believe in 
department head meetings and the full dis-
closure of projects within the top organiza-
tion of the station. If you give someone the 
title, you should be prepared to give that 
person some authority, too. I   respect the 
integrity of my people, and if I lose it, I 
replace them quickly. In other words, ‘You 
respect me, and I’ll respect you,’ is the way 
I have always managed.”
Randy Bongarten, network chief, concurs 
with Christian and adds, “Management 
styles have to be adaptive to individual 
situations so as to provide what is needed 
at the time. In general, the collaborator or 
team leader approach gets the job done. 
Of course, I don’t think there is any one 
school of management that is right 100% 
of the time.”
Jim Arcara, former radio network head, 
also is an advocate of the hybrid man-
agement style. “It’s a reflection of what is 
more natural to me as well as my company.

The Manager’s Challenge
In these uncertain economic times 
managing and motivating people are 
the challenges. It is easier to run any 
business when there is money around, 
when cost cuts and belt tightening 
are not the emphasis. But while the 
“fat” years may be in the past, radio 
still continues to thrive. And these are 
exciting times for the medium. Manag-
ing is a talent in its own right. It takes 
talent to lead, and it takes talent to 
find good people. If you find you get 
a kick out of leading people and are 
excited by other people’s good work, 
as much as from your own work, 
you may be a good candidate for 
management. There are many jobs 
in radio. Some people are naturally 
better “actors” than “directors.” Those 
people should probably not be in 
management. But if you enjoy motivat-
ing others and running a team then 
management is something you should 
consider. The keys to managing staff 
include honesty, enthusiasm, creativity, 
and empathy.

sphere. “Since practically every job in the radio 
station is designed to support and enhance 
the air product, establishing a connected-
ness among what is usually a small band of 
employees tends to yield the best results,” 
contends station manager Jane Duncklee. “I 
strongly believe that employees must feel that 
they are a valid part of what is happening and 
that their input has a direct bearing on those 
decisions which affect them and the opera-
tion as a whole. I try to hire the best people 
possible and then let them do their jobs with 
a minimum of interference and a maximum 
of support.”
Marlin R. Taylor, founder of Bonneville 
Broadcasting System and former manager of 
several major-market radio outlets, includ-
ing WRFM, New York, and WBCN, Boston, 
believes that the manager using the collab-
orative system of management gets the most 
out of employees. “When a staff member 
feels that his or her efforts and contribu-
tions make a difference and are appreciated, 
that person will remain motivated. This 
kind of employee works harder and deliv-
ers more. Most people, if they enjoy the job 
­decisions, and they should be given the 
opportunity to do so. An effective manager 
also delegates responsibility.”
General manager Pat McNally finds the 
collaborative approach suitable to his goals 
and temperament. “My management style 
is more collaborative. I believe in hiring 
qualified professional people, defining what 
I expect, and allowing them to do their job 
with input, support, and constructive criti-
cism from me. My door is always open for 
suggestions, and I am a good listener. I con-
sider this business something special, and I 
expect an extra special effort.”
This also holds true for general manager 
Steven Woodbury. “I hire the best people 
as department heads and then work col-
laboratively with these experts. Department 
heads are encouraged to run their areas as if 
they had major ownership in the company. 
That instills a sense of team spirit too. Their 
energy level and decision-making efforts 
reflect this.”
The manager/collaborator approach has 
gained popularity in the past two decades.

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

job will remain elusive. So then what goes 
into becoming a radio station manager? 
According to Jim Robertson, vice president 
of Dix Communications, the main personal 
and professional qualities a station manager 
should possess are honesty and integrity. As 
Robertson says, “Everything else is mute 
without that to start. You must be willing 
to lead by example. Be a part of the process 
not just an overseer. We are not a huge 
operation, which allows me to be much 
more a participant. As the size of the staff 
and the number of stations gets larger, the 
challenge of participation grows, and that 
brings us right back to honesty and integrity. 
These are core ingredients. Add to these the 
importance of leading a balanced life. One 
that allows you to share time with family, 
engage in leisure activities, participate in 
community, and so on. It is very important 
that a manager knows how to balance and 
prioritize these things.”
Emmis 
Communications 
chief, 
Jeff 
Smulyan, says the current times require 
special skills. “A radio manager must be flex-
ible. The media world is changing daily. Pro-
viding leadership that understands a rapidly 
changing world is the most important attri-
bute. None of us understands how technol-
ogy will change the industry. We have to 
provide content that can be deployed in 
several different ways. Content that creates 
a unique listening experience and provides 
they have and like the organization they 
work for, are desirous of improving their 
level of performance and contributing to 
the health and well-being of the station. 
I really think that many station managers 
should devote even more time and energy 
to people development.”
Station general manager Paul Aaron 
believes that managers must first assert their 
authority; that is, make it clear to all that 
they are in charge, before the transition to 
collaborator can take place. “It’s a sort of 
process of evolution. Actually, when you 
come right down to it, any effective man-
agement approach includes a bit of both 
the authoritarian and collaborative con-
cepts. The situation at the station will have 
a direct impact on the management style I 
personally deem most appropriate. As the 
saying goes, “different situations call for dif-
ferent measures.” When assuming the reins 
at a new station, sometimes it is necessary 
to take a more dictatorial approach until 
the organization is where you feel it should 
be. Often a lot of cleanup and adjustments 
are necessary before there can be a greater 
degree of equanimity. Ultimately, however, 
there should be equanimity.”
Surveys have shown that most broadcast 
executives view the chief collaborator or 
hybrid management approach as compatible 
with their needs. “It has pretty much become 
the standard modus operandi in this industry. 
A radio manager must direct as well as invite 
input. To me it makes sense, in a business in 
which people are the product, to create an 
atmosphere that encourages self-expression, 
as well as personal and professional growth. 
After all, we are in the communications 
business. Everyone’s voice should at least be 
heard,” contends Lynn Christian.
What Makes a Manager?
As in any other profession, the road to the 
top is seldom a short and easy one. It takes 
years to get there, and dues must be paid 
along the way. To begin, without a genuine 
affection for the business and a strong desire 
to succeed, it is unlikely that the position 
can ever be attained. Furthermore, without 
the proper training and experience, the top

what matters,” says station general manager 
Richard Bremkamp, Jr.
To radio station manager Roger Ingram, 
experience is what most readily opens 
the door to management. “While a degree 
is kind of like a union card in this day and 
age, a good track record is what wins the 
management job. You really must possess 
both.”
Jane Duncklee began her ascent to 
station management by logging commer-
cials for airplay and eventually moved into 
other areas. “For the past 17 years I have 
been employed by Champion Broadcasting 
Systems. During that time I have worked in 
every department of the radio station, from 
traffic, where I started, to sales, program-
ming, engineering, and finally management 
on both the local and corporate levels.”
Many radio station managers are recruited 
from the sales area rather than programming. 
Since the general manager’s foremost objec-
tive is to generate a profit, station owners 
usually feel more confident hiring someone 
with a solid sales or business background. 
Consequently, three out of four radio man-
agers have made their living at some point 
selling airtime. It is a widely held belief that 
this experience best prepares an individual 
for the realities encountered in the man-
ager’s position. “I spent over a decade and 
a half in media sales before becoming a 
station manager. In fact, my experience on 
the radio level was exclusively confined to 
sales and then for only eight months. After 
that I moved into station management. 
Most of my radio-related sales experience 
took place on the national level with station 
rep companies,” recalls Norm Feuer of Force 
Two Communications.
Station manager Carl Evans holds that a 
sales background is especially useful, if not 
necessary, to general managers. “I spent a 
dozen years as a station account executive, 
and prior to entering radio I represented 
various product lines to retailers. The key to 
financial success in radio exists in an under-
standing of retailing.”
It is not uncommon for station managers 
to have backgrounds out of radio, but almost 
invariably their experience comes out of the 
areas of sales, marketing, and finance. Broad-
caster Paul Aaron worked as a fundraiser for 
the United Way of America before ­entering 
adequate results for advertisers. Being able 
to adjust to the shifting market scene is 
crucial for any manager.”
Entercom’s Dave Neugesser observes, 
“A station manager has to have a complete 
understanding of the three legs that support 
the body of radio – the listener, the client, 
and the station. While much of what we do 
in programming supports the station and 
listener, radio is a business and the client 
is just as crucial. A manager must have a 
clear vision, tight focus, and solid strategy to 
succeed. He or she must have a great team 
to be a great leader.”
Longtime 
broadcast 
executive 
John 
Gehron shares his perspective on what 
makes for a successful manager. “He or she 
must understand what channels the audi-
ence is using and then match content to 
fit the channel. Deciding how to allocate 
resources among the many distribution 
sources is of utmost importance. At the 
same time the manager must not pull too 
many resources from the primary channel 
and diminish its popularity.”
First and foremost, a prospective manager 
needs a good foundation, and formal educa-
tion plays a strong role in this background. 
Hundreds of institutions of higher learn-
ing across the country offer programs in 
broadcast operations. The college degree 
has achieved greater importance in radio 
over the last decade or two, and, as in 
most other industries today, it has become 
a standard credential for those vying for 
management slots. Anyone entering broad-
casting in  the 2000s with aspirations to 
operate a radio station should acquire as 
much formal training as possible. Station 
managers with master’s degrees are not 
uncommon. However, a bachelor’s degree 
in communications gives the prospective 
station manager a good foundation from 
which to launch a career.
In a business that stresses the value of 
practical experience, seldom, if ever, does an 
individual land a management job directly 
out of college. In fact, most station man-
agers have been in the business at least 
15 years. “Once you get the theory nailed 
down you have to apply it. Experience is 
the best teacher. I’ve spent 30 years working 
in a variety of areas in the medium. In 
radio, in particular, hands-on experience is 
50

nature of their jobs, had a solid understand-
ing of the radio rule: Time = Money.
Those in sales, through the very nature of 
their jobs, also enjoyed the pursuit of more 
money.
“I get turned on,” said one general sales 
manager, “when people tell me ‘no.’ I love 
getting them to say ‘yes.’”
Program directors, it was believed, lacked 
that basic grounding. Concerned with creating 
the station’s image, program directors inad-
vertently created an image for themselves as 
“creative” types without concern or respect for 
the “business” aspects of radio.
So how is the program director to compete?
By presenting skills you already possess in 
the most positive, business-oriented format 
and by getting the skills you don’t already 
possess.
In reality, the most attractive candidate 
for a station management position is the 
one whose experience has involved both 
programming and sales responsibilities. No 
general manager can fully function without 
an understanding and appreciation of what 
goes into preparing and presenting the 
air product, nor can he or she hope for 
success without a keen sense of business 
and finance.
Today’s highly competitive and complex 
radio market requires that the person 
aspiring  to management have both formal 
training,  preferably a college degree in 
broadcasting, and experience in all aspects 
of radio station operations, in particular sales 
and programming. Ultimately, the effort 
and energy an individual invests will bear 
directly on the dividends he or she earns, 
and there is not a single successful station 
manager who has not put in 15-hour days. 
The station manager is expected to know 
more and do more than anyone else, and 
rightfully so, since he or she is the person 
who stands to gain the most.
Radio group president Dan Mason relates 
the qualities he sees in the most successful 
station managers: “A keen sense of what is 
‘good business,’ humility to take the blame 
in bad times and to give staff credit in good 
times, fairness and passion for all, respon-
siveness to situations (not reactionary), 
passion for the industry, recognition and 
knowledge of staff (know by first name), 
and ability to keep personal problems out 
of the station.”
radio and contends that many managers come 
from other fields in which they have served 
in positions allied to sales, if not in sales 
itself. “Of those managers who have worked 
in fields other than radio, most have come 
to radio via the business sector. There are 
not many former biologists or glass blowers 
serving as station managers,” says Aaron.
Although statistics show that the station 
salesperson has the best chance of being 
promoted to the station’s head position 
(more general managers have held the 
sales manager’s position than any other), 
a relatively small percentage of radio’s 
managers come from the programming 
ranks. “I’m more the exception than the 
rule. I have spent all of my career in the 
programming side, first as a deejay at sta-
tions in Phoenix, Denver, and Pittsburgh, 
and then as program director for outlets 
in Kansas City and Chicago. I’ll have to 
admit, however, that while it certainly is 
not impossible to become a GM [general 
manager] by approaching it from the pro-
gramming side, resistance exists,” admits 
station manager Randy Lane.
Many in the industry consider the pro-
grammer’s role to be more an artistic func-
tion than one requiring a high degree of 
business savvy. However accurate or inac-
curate this assessment is, the result is that 
fewer managers are hired with backgrounds 
exclusively confined to programming duties. 
Programmers have reason to be encouraged, 
however, since a trend in favor of hiring 
program directors (PDs) has surfaced in 
recent years, and predictions suggest that it 
will continue.
In its useful (albeit aging) text pertain-
ing to how PDs become station managers,

Director to General Manager, the National

The biggest obstacle facing the program direc-
tor with an eye on management is image.
Programming is an operational expense. To 
create the “sound” of the station, the program 
director must spend money to pay staff sala-
ries, to buy programming aids, and to main-
tain studio equipment. Where does the money 
come from? Sales.
And it used to be that only those who were 
in sales were considered for promotion. The 
reasoning? Those in sales, through the very

hierarchy may soon find themselves looking 
for another job.
Fewer than 15% of the nation’s stations 
are owned by individuals or partnerships. 
At these radio outlets, the manager still 
must meet the expectations of the station 
owner(s). In some cases, the manager may 
be given more latitude or responsibility in 
determining the station’s fate, whereas in 
others, the owner may play a greater role 
in the operation of the station.
A basic function of the manager’s posi-
tion is to formulate station policy and 
see that it is implemented. To ensure 
against confusion, misunderstanding, and 
possible unfair labor practices that typi-
cally impede operations, employees often 
receive a station policy manual. This 
manual states the station’s positions on 
a host of issues, such as hiring, termi-
nation, salaries, raises, promotions, sick 
leave, vacation, benefits, and so forth. As 
standard practice, a station may require 
that each new employee read and become 
familiar with the contents of the policy 
manual before actually starting work. Job 
descriptions, as well as organization flow-
charts, commonly are outlined to make it 
abundantly clear to staff members about 
who is responsible for what. A  well-
conceived policy book may contain a 
statement of the station’s programming 
philosophy with an explanation of the 
format it employs. The more comprehen-
sive a policy book, the less likely there 
will be confusion and disruption.
Hiring and retaining good people are 
other key managerial functions. “You have 
some pretty delicate egos to cope with 
in this business. Radio attracts some very 
bright and highly talented people, some-
times with erratic temperaments. Keeping 
harmony and keeping people are among 
the foremost challenges facing a station 
manager,” claims Norm Feuer.
Steve Woodbury agrees with Feuer, 
adding, “You have to hire the right people 
and motivate them properly, and that’s a 
challenge. You have to be capable of inspir-
ing people. Actually, if you are unable to 
motivate your people, the station will fail 
to reach its potential. Hire the best people 
you can and nurture them.”
The Manager’s Duties  
and Responsibilities
A primary objective of the station manager 
is to operate in a manner that generates the 
most profit, while maintaining a positive and 
productive attitude among station employ-
ees. This is more of a challenge than it may 
seem at first, claims radio broadcaster Cliff 
Shank. “In order to meet the responsibility 
that you are faced with daily, you really 
have to be an expert in so many areas: sales, 
marketing, finance, legal matters, technical, 
governmental, and programming. It helps 
if you’re an expert in human nature, too.” 
Jane Duncklee puts it this way: “Manag-
ing a radio station requires that you divide 
yourself equally into at least a dozen parts 
and be a 100% whole in each situation.” 
In the new Telecommunications Act of 
1996 environment, consultant Ed Shane 
observes, “The duties for station manag-
ers have changed radically. For example, 
Chris Wegmann, manager of the Capstar 
cluster at Baton Rouge, has responsibility 
for several AM and FM stations in other 
parts of Louisiana and Texas. Talk about 
dividing yourself.”
In today’s consolidated environment, 
this  is more common than not; says Jay 
­Williams, “Mike Glickenhaus, a Clear 
Channel vice president and market manager, 
originally oversaw nine FM stations in the 
San Diego cluster.”
Station owner Bill Campbell says that the 
theme that runs throughout the classic Tom 
Peters’s book, In Search of Excellence, is one 
that is relevant to the station manager’s task 
today. “The idea in Peters’s book is that you 
must make the customer happy, get your 
people involved, and get rid of departmental 
waste and unnecessary expenditures. A station 
should be a lean and healthy organism.”
Station managers themselves generally 
must answer to a higher authority. The 
majority of radio stations, roughly 85%, 
are owned by companies and corporations 
that both hire the manager and establish 
financial goals or projections for the station. 
It is the station manager’s job to see that 
corporate expectations are met and, ideally, 
exceeded. Managers who fail to operate a 
facility in a way that satisfies the corporate

staff with our somewhat limited budget is 
an ongoing problem. This is true at most 
small market stations, however,” observes 
station manager J.G. Salter.
The rural or small-market station is where 
the majority of newcomers gain their expe-
rience. Because salaries are necessarily low 
and the fledgling air person’s ambitions are 
usually high, the rate of turnover is sig-
nificant. Managers of small outlets spend a 
great deal of time training people. “It is a 
fact of the business that radio people, par-
ticularly deejays, usually learn their trade at 
the ‘out-of-the-way,’ low-power outlet. To 
be a manager at a small station, you have to 
be a teacher, too. But it can be very reward-
ing despite the obvious problem of having 
to rehire to fill positions so often. We deal 
with many beginners. I find it exciting and 
gratifying, and no small challenge, to train 
newcomers in the various aspects of radio 
broadcasting,” says Salter.
Randy Lane also enjoys the instruc-
tor’s role but notes that the high turnover 
rate affects product continuity. “With air 
people coming and going all the time, it 
can give the listening public the impres-
sion of instability. The last thing a station 
wants to do is sound schizophrenic. Estab-
lishing an image of dependability is crucial 
to any radio station. Changing air people 
every other month doesn’t help. As a 
station manager, it is up to you to do the 
best you can with the resources at hand. 
In general, I think small market managers 
Cluster market manager Mike Glickenhaus 
says, “You make sure you have a lot of great 
people. You need more key people who you 
can give lots of responsibility to because you 
don’t have time to micromanage them. It’s 
important to hire the right people and then 
clearly lay out the vision, goals, and many 
of the steps that will be necessary and agree 
on them. You need people who understand 
what it takes, what they have to do, and have 
the direction to get there. Then as manager 
you have to decide what (projects or prob-
lems) you’re going to apply your time to.”
NAB’s executive vice president for radio, 
John David, adds, “There is no longer just 
one key to running successful radio sta-
tions. My advice would be to find as many 
creative people who have a real connec-
tion to the people in the audience. Hire 
them, treat them with respect, listen to 
their input, and pay them. Managers can 
hire people all day that agree with them. 
Hire people who have different ideas but 
are smart enough to carry out the plan with 
enthusiasm once the direction is deter-
mined. That goes for all departments of 
the team, including management. With this 
formula, you won’t be constantly looking 
for people.”
As mentioned earlier, managers of small-
market radio stations are confronted with 
a unique set of problems when it comes to 
hiring and holding onto qualified people, 
especially on-air personnel. “In our case, 
finding and keeping a professional-sounding

thousands or even millions of dollars in 
revenue.”
To ensure that the product the station 
offers is the best it can be, the station 
manager must keep in close touch with 
every department. Since the station’s sound 
is what wins listeners, the manager must 
work closely with the program director and 
engineer. Both significantly contribute to 
the quality of the air product. The program 
director is responsible for what goes on the 
air, and the engineer is responsible for the 
way it sounds.
Meanwhile, the marketing of the product 
is vital. This falls within the province of the 
sales department. Traditionally, the general 
manager works more closely with the sta-
tion’s sales manager than with anyone else.
An excellent air product attracts listen-
ers, and listeners attract sponsors. It is as 
basic as that. “The formula works when all 
departments in a station work in unison and 
up to their potential,” contends Marlin R. 
Taylor. “In radio our product is twofold – the 
programming we send over our frequency 
and the listening audience we deliver to 
advertisers. A station’s success is linked to 
­customer/listener satisfaction, just like a 
retail store’s. If you don’t have what the 
consumer desires, or the quality doesn’t 
meet his standards, he’ll go elsewhere and 
generally won’t return.”
In a fast-moving, dynamic industry like 
radio, where both cultural and techno-
logical innovations have an impact on the 
way a station operates, the manager must 
stay informed and keep an eye toward the 
future. New technologies employed by sta-
tions compound the manager’s task. For 
example, determining how best to employ 
a station’s Web site is ultimately the deci-
sion of the station manager. Radio manager 
Jim ­Robertson notes, “In terms of Web sites, 
they have to be established based on a plan. 
Our country station Web site, 93.7kcountry.
com, is much more advanced at this point 
than our classic rock station WIND-FM. K 
Country’s site is streaming and gets more 
attention every day. WINDFM.com is 
coming along and will be streaming in the 
next few months. Both stations do interac-
tive work with their listeners. We do every-
thing possible on air to get people to go to 
our sites, including Web site only ­contesting. 
do an incredible job with what they have 
to work with.”
Managers of small-market stations must 
wrestle with the problems stemming from 
diminutive budgets and high employee 
turnover, whereas those at large stations 
must grapple with the difficulties inherent 
in managing larger budgets, bigger staffs, 
and, of course, stiffer competition. “It’s all 
relative, really. While the small town station 
gives the manager turnover headaches, the 
metropolitan station manager usually is 
caught up in the ratings battle, which con-
sumes vast amounts of time and energy. Of 
course, even larger stations are not immune 
to turnover,” observes KGLD’s Bremkamp.
It is up to the manager to control the 
station’s finances. Knowledge of bookkeep-
ing and accounting procedures is necessary. 
“You handle the station’s purse-strings. An 
understanding of budgeting is an absolute 
must. Station economics is the responsibil-
ity of the GM. The idea is to control income 
and expenses in a way that yields a sufficient 
profit,” says Roger Ingram.
The manager allocates and approves 
spending in each department (in cluster 
operations this means each station). Heads 
of departments must work within the 
budgets they have helped establish. Budgets 
generally cover the expenses involved in 
the operation of a particular area within 
the station for a specified period, such as a 
6- or 12-month period. No manager wants 
to spend more than what is absolutely 
required. A thorough familiarity with what 
is involved in running the various depart-
ments within a station prevents waste and 
overspending. “A manager has to know what 
is going on in programming, engineering, 
sales, actually every little corner of the 
station, in order to run a tight ship and make 
the most revenue possible. Off course, you 
should never cut corners simply for the sake 
of cutting corners. An operation must spend 
in order to make. You have to have effective 
cost control in all departments. That doesn’t 
mean damaging the product through under-
nourishment either,” says Evans.
David Saperstein, president of Metro 
Networks, observes that, “In the early days, 
radio was a mom-and-pop type of business. 
With the huge dollars in radio today, one 
mistake could cost a station hundreds of 
54

very excited about offering new opportu-
nities for listening with our HD channels, 
and as manager you have to stay abreast of 
things all the time.”
Financial projections for future needs 
must be based on data that include the 
financial implications of prospective and 
predicted events. An effective manager 
anticipates change and develops appropriate 
plans to deal with it. Industry trade journals 
(Broadcasting and Cable, Radio and Records, 
The Radio Ink, Radio Business Report, and 
a host of Internet newsletters) and confer-
ences conducted by organizations such as 
the NAB and the Radio Advertising Bureau 
(RAB) help keep the station manager 
informed of what tomorrow may bring.
About industry trade journals, Ed Shane 
observes, “The consultant (not the come-
dian) George Burns once said ‘Never has 
The Web sites, as good as they are now, 
deserve more attention and resources to 
improve. That is high on my list of things 
to get done over the next couple of years. 
It’s important to keep the sites as unclut-
tered with sales-related material as possible 
and make it more hands on with the really 
important things that our listeners want 
and need. Too many sites, including ours at 
times, look like a laundry list of the clients 
currently on the air rather than an interac-
tive fun site. It’s another important element 
of today’s radio station management.”
In terms of other new technologies, such as 
HD and its side-channels features, ­Robertson 
says that effective strategies for the imple-
mentation of such things are a part of what 
is expected of station managers. “You have to 
know what is going to enhance your product 
in the face of ­mounting ­competition. We are

Publications such as

developments and 
issues.
The Manager’s Duties and Responsibilities 	
55

summarizes the duties and ­responsibilities 
of a station manager: “To me the challenges 
of running today’s radio station include 
building and maintaining audience ratings, 
attracting and keeping outstanding employ-
ees, increasing gross revenues annually, and 
creating a positive community image for 
the station, not necessarily in that order.” 
Richard Bremkamp is more laconic. “It boils 
down to one sentence: Protect the license 
and turn a profit.”
Managing the Cluster
In the latter half of the 2000s, a huge 
­percentage of the nation’s radio stations exist 
in cluster configurations. That is to say, several 
stations owned by the same company are 
gathered together in one ­location. This has 
resulted in the downsizing of station staffs 
and the ultimate enhancement of the bottom 
line for the corporations licensed to operate 
these outlets. The latter is what has motivated 
so much been written by so many about 
so few.’ The differences in today’s trades 
compared to just a few years ago are sig-
nificant. Inside Radio, Radio Only, Radio 
Business Report’s Radio News Today, R&R’s 
Hot Wax, and Alternative Radio Confiden-
tial are all paperless papers. Broadcasting 
is now Broadcasting and Cable. What does 
that say to the student of radio as a career? 
R&R [Radio and Records] claims that more 
company executives subscribe to it than any 
other trade, which was formerly Broadcast-
ing’s forte. Nonetheless, you have to read 
them to be up to date.”
Station consultants and “rep companies,” 
which sell local station airtime to national 
advertising agencies, also support the 
manager in his or her efforts to keep on top 
of things. “A station manager must utilize all 
that is available to stay in touch with what’s 
out there. Foresight is an essential ingredi-
ent for any radio manager. Hindsight is not 
enough in an industry that operates with one 
foot in the future,” says Lynn Christian, who

The Qualities That Make a Station Manager
  1.	 Smart/intelligent. This is some-
thing that I cannot teach or help 
someone with; they are either 
smart or they are not.
  2.	 Organized. A GM or GSM 
[general sales manager] has a 
lot on his or her plate, especially 
with the limited time available to 
accomplish what has to be done. 
An unorganized person will waste 
that time.
  3.	 Good communicator. As a group 
head, I too have a lot on my plate. 
I must rely on my managers to com-
municate with me quickly and effi-
ciently. If they can do that, I have 
the comfort that they are able to 
communicate effectively with their 
staff on the station’s missions and 
goals to be accomplished.
  4.	 Strategic thinker. In today’s world 
there’s no such thing as a quick 
fix. Therefore, I need to have 
someone who can think through 
the long-term effects of each major 
decision that he or she makes.
  5.	 Motivated. In my opinion, you 
cannot motivate people; they are 
either self-motivated or not. All I 
can do is set a work environment 
that motivates them to do their 
best.
  6.	 Businesslike. I need people who 
understand that this is a business, 
not a hobby, and that every deci-
sion that they make has a return 
on investment and will lead to a 
successful business conclusion.
  7.	 Leader. I want a person who is a 
winner, for whom people want to 
work, with the ability to read per-
sonnel, hire the best people, and 
be able to maximize the potential 
of all his or her people.
  8.	 Has a good track record. 
Although it is nice to be able 
to find someone who has a 
winning track record on all or 
most of his or her previous assign-
ments, we also understand that 
no one is born a GM or GSM. 
Therefore, it is not always a 
­criterion.
   9.	 Has a high energy level. I’ve 
always felt that you can determine 
a successful person by watching 
the way he or she walks down the 
hallway. I believe a person with a 
high energy level tends to get his 
or her people to move at a higher 
level also.
10.	 Honest and has integrity. It is abso-
lutely critical that you trust your 
manager, and trust that he or she 
won’t try to make excuses and 
place blame on other people. This 
is a very hard ingredient to deter-
mine up front and may have to be 
acquired eventually.

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

Severino offers a list of the pros and cons 
of the station cluster concept:
Pros: As a manager, you can use each entity 
to cross promote each other (events, 
programming specials, news, formats, 
etc; you can spread expenses); you can 
cross utilize personnel; you can expand 
what is offered to advertisers; you can 
utilize each station’s audience delivery 
and events to best serve the customer; 
you can combine resources to get better 
pricing from vendors (promotional items, 
outside marketing); and you can reduce 
expenses on support staff (business office, 
sales, and so forth).
Cons: As a manager, you cannot get 
involved in the day-to-day detail of each 
entity; you cannot devote full focus on a 
single station; you cannot engage in long-
term strategic thinking of each station 
­enterprise.
Organizational Structure
Radio stations come in all sizes and gen-
erally are classified as small-, medium-, or 
large (metro)-market outlets (see Figures 
2.7–2.9). The size of the community that 
a station serves usually reflects the size of 
its staff. That is to say, the station in a town 
of 5000 residents may have as few as three 
or four full-time employees. It is a question 
of economics. However, some small-market 
radio outlets have staffs that rival those of 
larger-market stations because their income 
warrants it. Few small stations earn enough 
to have elaborate staffs, however. Out of 
financial necessity, an employee may serve 
in several capacities. The station’s manager 
also may assume the duties of sales manager, 
and announcers often handle news responsi-
bilities. Meanwhile, everyone, including the 
station’s secretary, may write commercial 
copy. The key word at the small station is 
flexibility, since each member of the staff is 
expected to perform numerous tasks.
Medium-market stations are located in 
more densely populated areas. An outlet in 
a city with a population of between 100,000 
and a half million may be ­considered 
medium sized. Albany, New York; Omaha, 
Nebraska; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
this sweeping ­reorganization of the broadcast 
radio landscape. The ­long-time model of a 
single station run by a single manager is being 
eclipsed in major and medium markets by 
the post-Telecommunications Act of 1996 
“cluster” paradigm in which a single market 
manager oversees the operation of many sta-
tions – in some cases up to eight. This creates 
a whole new set of challenges for radio man-
agers. Perhaps the biggest challenge for the 
person responsible for the stations in a cluster 
is providing the appropriate amount of focus 
on each.
Tom Severino, Emmis Indianapolis Radio 
Market Manager, observes, “While manag-
ing a single station or even two, you have 
more time to get involved with more detail 
in each department. When you manage a 
cluster of four or more, you have to stay 
focused on the biggest issues that move you 
toward goals. The right people have always 
been your most important asset, and that 
is even more critical in cluster manage-
ment. You have to make sure you have the 
absolute right person in the right position 
because you have to rely on leadership at all 
levels more in a cluster situation. To manage 
this effectively everyone in the organization 
must know what the goals are, how they 
contribute to those goals, how we are doing 
in reaching those goals. Everyone needs to 
be familiar with the values of the company 
as well.”
Dix Communications vice president Jim 
Robertson shares many of Severino’s views 
regarding the management of a station 
cluster. “The on-going balancing act of time 
and resources is by far top of the list from 
my perspective. I am fortunate to have two 
stations (93.7K Country/WOGK) and our 
three station classic rock simulcast (WNDD/
WNDT/WNDN) that are capable of being 
number one in all of the key demograph-
ics. Each station rightfully demands and 
deserves  equal attention. Admittedly, each 
station at times feels like the other is 
favored. I think that is good in a competi-
tive environment. Good communication is 
essential in a cluster operation, especially at 
the department-head level. It allows each 
station’s program director to understand 
why things are happening across the hall at 
the other station. A cluster has to function 
organically.

are typical medium markets. Greater com-
petition exists in these markets, more than 
in the small market where only one or two 
stations may be vying for the listening audi-
ence. Each of the medium markets cited has 
over a dozen stations.
The medium-market radio station aver-
ages 12–20 employees. Although an overlap-
ping of duties does occur even in the larger 
station, positions usually are more limited 
to specific areas of responsibility. Seldom do 
­announcers substitute as news people. Nor do 
sales people fill airshifts, as is frequently the 
case at small outlets. (Reexamine Figure 1.29, 
a medium-market flowchart.)
Large (also referred to as major or 
metro)-market radio stations broadcast in 
the nation’s most populated urban centers. 
New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago rank 
first, second, and third, respectively. The top 
20 radio markets also include cities such 
as Houston, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, 
and San Francisco. Competition is greatest 
in the large markets, where as many as 70 
stations may be dividing the audience pie.
When stations are purchased by large radio 
companies, positions are typically consolidated 
and centralized. For example, middle manage-
ment slots (sales manager, program director, 
etc.) may be eliminated at the local station.
Market manager Tom Severino offers this 
view of how his particular station cluster is 
organized:
Market Manager – general manager of cluster; 
reports to corporate headquarters.
Director of Sales (DOS) – oversees the clus-
ter’s sales operation, including the indi-
vidual stations’ sales managers. The DOS 
reports directly to the market manager.
General Sales Manager (GSMs) – ­supervises 
the sales department of an individual 
station; reports to the DOS.

the size of their market, usually employ 
fewer people. Also keep in mind that 
station clustering and consolidation have 
changed the personnel landscape at many 
stations, as radio groups often concentrate 
the operation of several stations in one 
center. Station clusters often employ over 
100 people.
The following brief descriptions of depart-
ment head duties and responsibilities are 
explained more fully in later chapters. These 
individuals are regarded as station middle 
management and generally report directly 
to the station’s manager. In cluster opera-
tions, these positions are often expanded or 
eliminated all together.
Operations Manager
In noncluster operations, this person is 
second only to the general manager in level 
of authority; the operations manager (not 
all stations have such a slot) is sometimes 
considered the station’s assistant manager. 
The operations manager’s duties include the 
following:
• Supervising administrative (office) staff
• Helping to develop station policies and 
see that they are implemented

Director of Operations for FM – responsible 
for all programming elements, including 
marketing for 97.1 Hank–FM (WLHK), 
B 105.7 (WYXB), and 93.1 RadioNow 
(WNOU). The program director for 
WNOU reports to the director of opera-

Ward Quaal
My Management Philosophy
1.	To succeed, radio stations must 
rededicate themselves to “localism” 
and their involvement in every pos-
sible phase of activity within their 
respective community (this applies 
regardless of format).
2.	Regardless of the size of the market 
involved, those people who are 
making the news, whether in the 
world of academia, government, 
politics in general, and civic leader-
ship, must become a part of a radio 
station’s total operation. In short, 
management must encourage and 
develop their participation so as to 
add to the richness and the superior 
culture of the property.
3.	Basic to every radio operation and 
ultimate success is policy control over 
commercial material – its length, its 
acceptability to a station of the type 
involved, and passing of the “test” as 
to whether the commercial and the 
station complement one another.

• Assigning lists of retail accounts and local 
advertising agencies to sales people
• Establishing sales quotas
• Coordinating on-air and in-store sales 
promotions
• Developing sales materials and rate 
cards.
In cluster situations, a group general 
sales manager may direct the efforts of 
individual sales managers or account 
executives.
Chief Engineer
The chief engineer’s job is a vital station func-
tion. Responsibilities include the following:
• Operating the station within prescribed 
technical parameters established by the 
FCC
• Purchasing, repairing, and maintaining 
equipment
• Monitoring signal fidelity
• Adapting studios for programming needs
• Setting up remote broadcast operations
• Working closely with the programming 
department.
Human Resources
The management of station personnel 
constitutes one of the manager’s greatest 
challenges. Following is prominent radio 
executive Dick Oppenheimer’s perspec-
tive on the subject: “One of the oldest 
sayings I can remember is that the more 
things change, the more they stay the same. 
Perhaps, but that adage certainly does not 
apply to the radio industry any longer.”
“Before there were LMAs, duopolies, and 
super-duopolies, you were the manager of 
one or, at most, two radio stations. Now 
the norm is to manage at least six in your 
market. This is an industry where the inven-
tory is time and the commodity is people. 
In fact, radio is a business totally driven by 
people.”
“I can remember the days when almost 
anything was acceptable. The radio station 
was a totally male-dominated environment, 
except for the few female administrative 
assistants (clerks and secretaries). As a male 
• Handling departmental budgeting
• Keeping abreast of government rules 
and regulations pertaining to the entire 
­operation
• Working as the liaison with the commu-
nity to ensure that the station provides 
appropriate service and maintains its 
“good guy” image.
Duties tend to be more skewed toward 
programming and may even include the job of 
station programmer, or, as in the age of station 
clustering, the operations manager may be 
responsible for a radio group’s programming 
and direct its individual station program direc-
tor. In such cases, the operations manager’s 
duties are designed with a primary emphasis 
on on-air operations. Assistant program direc-
tors commonly are appointed to work with 
the operations manager to accomplish pro-
gramming goals. Not all stations have estab-
lished this position, preferring the department 
head reporting to station manager approach.
Program Director
As one of the three key department head 
positions at a radio station, the program 
director is responsible for the following:
• Developing and executing format
• Hiring and managing air staff
• Establishing the schedule of airshifts
• Monitoring the station to ensure consis-
tency and quality of product
• Keeping abreast of competition and trends 
that may affect programming
• Maintaining the music library
• Complying with FCC rules and regulations
• Directing the efforts of the news and 
public affairs areas.
Sales Manager
The sales manager’s position (called direc-
tor of sales in cluster operations) is a pivotal 
one at any radio station, and involves the 
following:
• Generating station income by directing 
the sale of commercial airtime
• Supervising sales staff
• Working with the station’s rep company 
to attract national advertisers

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

employee comes to you with a complaint, 
have someone else present to verify the 
discussion and its content. Keep in mind 
that in a courtroom, you are the defen-
dant. All the employee has to say is that 
it happened. The burden of proof is 
yours.”
“Of course, one of the best ways to 
prevent problems is through proper hiring. 
It has been my experience that, often times, 
the employee who files charges against you 
is a marginal or questionable employee, that 
is to say, an employee who should not have 
been hired in the first place. Unfortunately, 
it is not until a suit has been filed that you 
learn about an employee’s history of filing 
complaints. However, there are times when 
a complaint is legitimate. Real problems 
can and do exist. You have to be mindful 
of this.
“Handling people is one of the significant 
challenges of any manager. It is also one of 
the most rewarding.”
Whom Do Managers Hire?
Managers want to staff their stations 
with the most qualified individuals. Their 
criteria go beyond education and work 
experience to include various personal-
ity characteristics. “A strong resume is 
important, but the type of person is what 
really decides it for me. The goal is to hire 
someone who will fit in nicely with the 
rest of the station’s members. A station is 
a bit like a family in that it is never too 
large and people are in fairly close contact 
with one another. Integrity, imagination, 
intelligence, and a desire to succeed are 
the basic qualities that I look for when 
hiring,” says Maine station manager Chris-
topher Spruce.
Ambition and a positive attitude are attri-
butes that rank high among most manag-
ers. “People with a sincere desire to be the 
best, to win, are the kind who really bolster 
an operation. Our objective when I headed 
Viacom Radio was to be number one at 
what we did, so any amount of negativity or 
complacency was viewed as counterproduc-
tive,” says Norm Feuer. Lynn Christian, who 
once served as Feuer’s boss while manager 
manager you flattered, pampered, compli-
mented, and cajoled the women employees. 
The station was a close-knit family whereby 
if you did not make notice of the appear-
ance of a female worker she was insulted. 
If you did not put your arm around her, it 
meant you did not care. Likewise, if you did 
not insult or intimidate a male employee, 
something was wrong. Now, any and all 
of that can and probably will inspire a 
lawsuit  – one you cannot win no matter 
what the outcome.”
“The typical radio station had perhaps 15 
employees and although you had middle 
managers you were truly ‘hands-on.’ The 
manager was more than just the boss, he 
was priest, rabbi, psychologist, big brother, 
confidant, and so on. Today, with upward 
of 100 employees, you can no longer be 
‘hands-on.’ You are now a corporate figure-
head. You are responsible to and for your 
corporation for the day-to-day operations 
of your slew of radio stations.”
“Today’s radio station is far different from 
the one of 10 or 20 years ago. Now there’s 
a host of considerations you as manager 
must keep a watchful eye on, including 
sexual harassment, job discrimination, 
hostile work environment, disabilities acts, 
and race, religion, and gender issues. That’s 
for starters.”
“The first thing a manager must do is 
learn all the rules and laws concerning 
areas that impact human resources. You 
shouldn’t attempt this yourself. Hire and 
retain an attorney who specializes in labor 
law. Have the attorney write an employee 
manual and establish the policies that 
are necessary for you to be a competent 
personnel manager. Once you have done 
this, have an initial meeting with your 
management staff and your attorney to 
convey the information necessary to assist 
your people in their management of other 
people.”
“Next have your employees acknowl-
edge receipt of the manual, and each and 
every quarter have reviews with your man-
agement staff regarding the various poli-
cies outlined in the manual as a means 
of detecting and assessing any potential 
problems.”
“Document everything. Remember, if it 
is not in writing, it did not occur. When an

and then you have a real problem on your 
hands.”
Self-respect and esteem for the orga-
nization are uniquely linked, claims J.G. 
Salter. “If an individual does not feel good 
about himself, he cannot feel good about 
the world around him. This is not a ques-
tion of ego, but rather one of appropriate 
self-perception. A healthy self-image and 
attitude in an employee makes that person 
easier to manage and work with. The secret 
is identifying potential problems or weak-
nesses in prospective employees before you 
sign them on. It’s not easy without a degree 
in Freud.”
Other personal qualities that managers 
look for in employees are patience, enthusi-
asm, discipline, creativeness, logic, and com-
passion. “You look for as much as you can 
during the interview and, of course, fill in 
the gaps with phone calls to past employ-
ers. After that, you hope that your decision 
bears fruit,” says Spruce.
The Manager and  
the Profit Motive
Earlier we discussed the unique nature of 
the radio medium and the particular chal-
lenges that face station managers as a con-
sequence. Radio, indeed, is a form of show 
business, and both words of the term are 
particularly applicable since the medium 
is at once stage and store. Radio provides 
entertainment (and information) to the 
public and, in turn, sells the audience it 
attracts to advertisers.
The general manager or market manager 
is answerable to many: the station’s owners 
and corporate heads, listeners, and spon-
sors. However, to keep his or her own job, 
the manager must first please the owner or 
corporate manager. More often than not, 
this person’s first concern is profit. As in 
any business, the more money the manager 
generates, the happier the owner.
Ed Shane observes, “The new radio para-
digm is ‘manager as financial expert.’ Pres-
sure from corporate ownership to feed 
stock prices has changed the way managers 
of a Miami radio station, says that competi-
tiveness and determination are among the 
qualities he, too, looks for, and adds loyalty 
and dedication to the list. “Commitment to 
the station’s philosophy and goals must exist 
in every employee or there are soft spots in 
the operation. In today’s marketplace you 
have to operate from a position of strength, 
and this takes a staff that is with you all 
the way.”
Stability and reliability are high on any 
manager’s list. Radio is known as a nomadic 
profession, especially the programming end. 
Deejays tend to come and go, sometimes 
disappearing in the night. “A manager strives 
to staff his station with dependable people. 
I want an employee who is stable and there 
when he or she is supposed to be,” states 
Duncklee.
A station can ill afford to shut down because 
an air person fails to show up for his or her 
scheduled shift. When a no-show occurs, 
the station’s continuity is disrupted both 
internally and externally. Within the station, 
adjustments must be made to fill the void 
created by the absent employee. At the same 
time, a substitute deejay often detracts from 
efforts to instill in the audience the feeling 
that they can rely on the station.
Managers are wary of individuals with 
fragile or oversized egos. “No prima donnas, 
please! I want a person who is able to 
accept constructive criticism and use it to 
his or her advantage without feeling that 
he is being attacked. The ability to look at 
oneself objectively and make the adjust-
ments that need to be made is very impor-
tant,” observes manager Cliff Shank. Carl 
Evans echoes his sentiments. “Open-mind-
edness is essential. An employee who feels 
that he can’t learn anything from anyone 
or is never wrong is usually a fly in the 
ointment.”
Honesty and candor are universally desired 
qualities, says Bremkamp. “Every station 
manager appreciates an employee who is 
forthright and direct, one who does not 
harbor ill feelings or unexpressed opinions 
and beliefs. An air of openness keeps things 
from seething and possibly erupting. I prefer 
an employee to come to me and say what is 
on his or her mind, rather than keep things 
sealed up inside. The lid eventually pops 
62	
CHAPTER 2 Station Management

The dilemma facing today’s radio station 
manager stems from the complexity of 
having to please numerous factions while 
earning enough money to justify his or her 
continued existence at the station. Marlin 
Taylor has suggested that stations reinvest 
more of their profits as a method of upgrad-
ing the overall quality of the medium. 
“Overcutting can have deleterious effects. 
A station can be too lean, even anemic. In 
other words, you have to put something 
in to get something out. Too much drain-
ing leaves the operation arid and subject to 
criticism by the listening public. It behooves 
the station manager to keep this thought 
in mind and, if necessary, impress it upon 
ownership. The really successful operations 
know full well that money has to be spent 
to nurture and develop the kind of product 
that delivers both impressive financial 
returns and listener praise.”
Although it is the manager who must 
deal with bottom-line expectations, it 
is also the manager who is expected to 
maintain product integrity. The effective 
manager takes pride in the unique role 
radio plays in society and does not hand it 
over to advertisers, notes station manager 
­Bremkamp. “You have to keep close tabs 
on your sales department. They are out to 
sell the station, sometimes one way or the 
other. Overly zealous ­sales people can, on 
occasion, become insensitive to the station’s 
format in their quest for ad dollars. Violat-
ing the format is like mixing fuel oil with 
water. You may fill your tank for less money, 
but you’re not likely to get very far. The 
onus is placed on the manager to protect 
the integrity of the product while making 
a dollar. Actually, doing the former usually 
takes care of the latter.”
Conscientious station managers are aware 
of the obligations confronting them and are 
sensitive to the criticism that crass com-
mercialism can produce a desert or “waste-
land” of bland and uninspired programming. 
They are also aware that while gaps and 
voids may exist in radio programming and 
that certain segments of the population may 
not be getting exactly what they want, it 
is up to them to produce enough income 
to pay the bills and meet the ownership’s 
expectations.
think about their stations. Budgets, once 
an annual affair, are reevaluated quarterly 
and even monthly. Managers now must be 
prepared at a moment’s notice to cancel 
planned advertising expenditures or to move 
the expenditures into another quarter if the 
local cluster (or the company’s region) is 
not making budgets. ‘Budgets’ does not 
mean breaking even. It means achieving 
the percentage increase over the previous 
year’s cash flow. Margins of 45–50% are not 
uncommon.”
Critics have chided the medium for what 
they argue is an obsessive preoccupation 
with making money, which has resulted in 
a serious shortage of high-quality, innova-
tive programming. They lament too much 
sameness. Meanwhile, station managers 
often are content to air material that draws 
the kind of audience that advertisers want 
to reach.
Marlin Taylor observes that too many man-
agers overemphasize profit at the expense 
of the operation. “Not nearly enough of 
the radio operators in this country are truly 
committed to running the best possible sta-
tions they can, either because that might 
cost them more money or they simply don’t 
understand or care what it means to be the 
best. In my opinion, probably no more than 
20% of the nation’s stations are striving to 
become the IBM of radio, that is, striving 
for true excellence. Many simply are being 
milked for what the owners and managers 
can take out of them.”
The pursuit of profits forces the station 
manager to employ the programming 
format that will yield the best payday. In 
several markets certain formats, such as 
classical and jazz, which tend to attract 
limited audiences, have been dropped in 
favor of those that draw greater numbers. 
In some instances, the actions of stations 
have caused outcries by unhappy and dis-
enfranchised listeners who feel that their 
programming needs are being disregarded. 
Several disgruntled listener groups have 
gone to court in an attempt to force stations 
to reinstate abandoned formats. Since the 
government currently avoids involvement 
in programming decisions, leaving it up to 
stations to do as they see fit, little has come 
of their protests.

issues and do so on a quarterly basis, 
­maintaining the results of these surveys 
(often a list of the top 10 issues confront-
ing the community of license) in their 
Public File to attest to their good citi-
zenship. This looks particularly positive at 
license renewal time.
A station manager is aware that it is 
important to the welfare of his or her 
­organization to behave as a good citizen 
and neighbor. Although the sheer number 
of stations in vast metropolitan areas makes 
it  less crucial that a station exhibit civic 
mindedness, the small-market radio outlet 
often finds that the level of business it gen-
erates is relative to its community involve-
ment. Therefore, maintaining a relationship 
with the town leaders, civic groups, and 
religious leaders, among others, enhances a 
station’s visibility and status and ultimately 
affects business. No small-market station 
can hope to operate autonomously and 
attract the majority of local advertisers. Sta-
tions that remain aloof in the ­community 
The Manager and  
the Community
In the early 1980s, the FCC reduced 
the extent to which radio stations must 
become involved in community affairs. 
(This deregulation process continued into 
the 1990s with the Republicans’ creation 
of a sweeping telecommunications bill.) 
Ascertainment procedures requiring that 
stations determine and address commu-
nity issues have all but been eliminated. If 
a station chooses to do so, it may spin the 
hits 24 hours a day and virtually divorce 
itself from the concerns of the commu-
nity. However, a station that opts to func-
tion independently of the community to 
which it is licensed may find itself on the 
outside looking in. This is especially true 
of small-market stations, which, for prac-
tical business reasons, traditionally have 
cultivated a strong connection with the 
community. Therefore, most stations do 
make an attempt to ascertain ­community 
Paul Fiddick
What Makes a Successful Radio Manager?
In reflecting on “what qualities . . .  
make a radio manager successful,” 
I’ve considered the dozens of manag-
ers who have worked for me in my 
stints running the Multimedia radio 
group (when they had one) and the 
last nine years with Heritage. And I’ve 
decided that there are two indicators 
that are essential (among others, I’m 
sure) for high performance. The first 
of these is a bias for action, or what 
industrial psychologists describe as 
task orientation. The concept of entre-
preneurism is closely related to this, 
as is the quality of decisiveness. The 
radio manager must be innately tuned 
to the notion of taking the initiative 
if opportunities are to be exploited 
or – at a minimum – order is to be 
maintained.
The other quality is harder to 
describe. The term I have used is that 
successful managers take things person-
ally. This may seem counterintuitive. 
Shouldn’t managers retain a kind of cool 
objectivity with regard to their work?
What I’ve found is that the job is too 
demanding for that – at least at the 
highest levels. In order to overcome the 
frustrations that come from so many 
aspects of your performance being 
outside of your direct control (i.e., 
ratings, competitive changes, the fact 
that a music station’s primary product is 
produced by someone else), the success-
ful manager must be a driven personal-
ity, and that drive comes from an inner, 
personal need. I do not believe it is coin-
cidental that success and obsessiveness 
go hand in hand in the radio business.

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

­survival. Station consolidation has influenced 
­localism across the country, but most man-
agers continue to recognize that community 
involvement is a key to their success.
The Manager and  
the Government
Earlier in this chapter, station manager 
Richard Bremkamp cited protecting the 
license as one of the primary functions of 
the general manager. By “protecting” the 
license he meant conforming to the rules 
and regulations established by the FCC 
for the operation of broadcast facilities. 
Since failure to fulfill the obligations of a 
license may result in punitive actions such 
as ­reprimands, fines, and even the revoca-
tion of the privilege to broadcast, manag-
ers have to be aware of the laws affecting 
station operations and see to it that they are 
observed by all concerned.
An article in Radio Ink in the early 2000s 
summarized the FCC’s punitive actions 
against stations for rules violations. Here 
are some examples:
• Construction 
or 
operation 
without 
authorization: $20,000
• Unauthorized 
transfer 
of 
control: 
$20,000
• Failure to permit FCC inspections: $18,750
• Failure to respond to FCC communica-
tions: $17,500
• Exceeding power limits: $12,500
• EBS equipment broken or not installed: 
$12,500
• Broadcasting indecent/obscene material: 
$12,500
• Violation of EEO or political broadcast 
rules: $12,500
• Violation of main studio rule: $10,000
• Public file violations: $7500
• Sponsor ID or lottery violations: $6250.
Since then, fines in some areas have 
increased significantly, especially in the area 
of indecency and obscenity.
The manager delegates responsibilities to 
department heads who are directly involved 
in the areas affected by the commission’s 
­regulations. For example, the program 
in which they broadcast seldom realize 
their full revenue potential.
One of the nation’s foremost figures 
in broadcast management, Ward Quaal, 
president of the Ward L. Quaal Company, 
observes, “A manager must not only be tied, 
or perhaps I should say ‘married’ to a station, 
but he or she must have total involvement 
in the community. This is very meaningful, 
whether the market is ­Cheyenne, ­Cincinnati, 
or Chicago. The community participation 
builds the proper image for the station and 
the manager and concurrently aids, dramati-
cally, business development and produces 
lasting sales strength.”
Cognizant of the importance of fos-
tering an image of goodwill and civic 
mindedness, the station manager seeks 
to become a member in good standing 
in the community. Radio managers often 
actively ­participate in groups or associa-
tions, such as the local Chamber of Com-
merce, Jaycees, Kiwanis, Rotary Club, 
Optimists, and others, and encourage 
members of their staff to become simi-
larly involved. The station also strives to 
heighten its status in the community by 
devoting airtime to issues and events of 
local importance and by making its micro-
phones available to citizens for discus-
sions of matters pertinent to the area. In 
so doing, the station becomes regarded as 
an integral part of the community, and its 
value grows proportionately.
Surveys have shown that over one-third of 
the managers of small-market radio stations 
are native to the area their signal serves. This 
gives them a vested interest in the quality of 
life in their community and motivates them 
to use the power of their medium to further 
improve living conditions.
Medium- and large-market station man-
agers realize, as well, the benefits derived 
from participating in community activities. 
“If you don’t localize and take part in the 
affairs of the city or town from which you 
draw your income, you’re operating at a 
disadvantage. You have to tune in your audi-
ence if you expect them to do likewise,” 
says Bremkamp.
The manager has to work to bring the 
station and the community together. 
Neglecting this responsibility lessens the 
station’s chance for prosperity, or even

with the rules and regulations, a manager 
makes certain that everything is in order. 
An FCC inspection checklist is contained 
in the CFR, and industry organizations, 
such as the NAB, provide member sta-
tions with similar checklists. Occasion-
ally, managers run mock inspections in 
preparation for the real thing. A state of 
preparedness 
prevents 
embarrassment 
and problems.
The Public File
Radio stations are required by the FCC to 
maintain a Public File. This, too, is ultimately 
the manager’s responsibility. However, other 
members of a station’s staff typically are 
required to update certain elements of the 
file. The purpose of the file is to provide 
the general population with access to infor-
mation pertaining to the way a station has 
conducted itself during a license period. 
Interest in a station’s Public File often 
increases around license renewal periods, 
when members of a community may choose 
to challenge a station’s right to continue 
broadcasting.
The FCC expects a station’s Public File 
to contain the following (this is subject 
to change as rules and regulations are 
revised):
• The Public and Broadcasting – A Pro-
cedural Manual (revised edition)
• Annual employment reports
• Copies of all FCC applications (power 
increases, original construction permit 
(CP), facilities changes, license ­renewals)
• Ownership reports
• Political file
• Letters from the public
• Quarterly issues
• Local public notices.
The Public File must be located in the 
community in which the station is licensed. 
Most stations keep the file at their main 
studio facility rather than at another public 
location, which is also permissible. The 
Public File is often the first place FCC 
director will attend to the legal station 
­identification, station logs, program content, 
and myriad other concerns of interest to the 
government. Meanwhile, the chief engineer 
is responsible for meeting technical stan-
dards, and the sales manager is held account-
able for the observance of certain business 
and financial practices. Other members of 
the station also are assigned various respon-
sibilities applicable to the license. Of course, 
in the end, it is the manager who must guar-
antee that the station’s license to broadcast 
is, indeed, protected.
All rules and regulations pertaining to 
radio broadcast operations are contained 
in Title 47, Part 73, of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR). The station manager 
keeps the annual update of this publica-
tion accessible to all employees involved 
in maintaining the license. A copy of the 
CFR may be obtained through the Superin-
tendent of Documents, Government Print-
ing Office, Washington, DC 20402, for a 
modest fee. Specific inquiries concerning 
the publication can be addressed to the 
Director, Office of the Federal Register, 
National Archives and Records Service, 
General Services Administration, Washing-
ton, DC 20408.
To reiterate, although the station manager 
shares the duties involved in complying 
with the FCC’s regulations with other staff 
members, he or she holds primary responsi-
bility for keeping the station out of trouble 
and on the air.
As noted in Chapter 1, many of the 
rules and regulations pertaining to the 
daily operation of a radio station have 
been revised or rescinded. Since the CFR 
is published annually, certain parts may 
become obsolete during that period. 
Martha L. Girard, director of the Office 
of the Federal Register, suggests that the 
Federal Register, from which the CFR 
derives its information, be consulted 
monthly. “These two publications must 
be used together to determine the latest 
version of any given rule,” says Byrne. A 
station may subscribe to the Federal Reg-
ister or visit the local library.
Since the FCC may, at any time during 
normal business hours, inspect a radio 
station to see that it is in accordance 
66	
CHAPTER 2 Station Management

work within the agreement that they, along 
with the union, helped formulate.
As stated, unions are a fact of life in many 
major markets. They are far less prevalent 
elsewhere, although unions do exist in some 
medium and even small markets. Most 
small operations would find it impractical, 
if not untenable, to function under a union 
contract. Union demands would quite 
likely cripple most marginal or small-profit 
operations.
Managers who extend employees every 
possible courtesy and operate in a fair and 
reasonable manner are rarely affected by 
agents look when they inspect a station, 
so it must be readily available. It is impera-
tive that the file be kept up-to-date. As a 
general rule, files are retained for a period 
of 7 years.
More detailed information pertaining 
to a station’s Public File may be found in 
Section 73.3526 of the FCC’s Rules and 
Regulations.
The Manager and Unions
The unions most active in radio are the 
American Federation of Television and 
Radio Artists (AFTRA), the National Asso-
ciation of Broadcast Employees and Tech-
nicians (NABET), and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). 
Major-market radio stations are the ones 
most likely to be unionized. The over-
whelming majority of American stations are 
nonunion and, in fact, in recent years union 
­membership has declined.
Dissatisfaction with wages and benefits, 
coupled with a desire for greater security, 
are often motivators that prompt station 
employees to vote for a union. Managers 
seldom encourage the presence of a union 
since many believe that unions impede and 
constrict their ability to control the destiny 
of their operations. However, a small per-
centage of managers believe that the exis-
tence of a union may actually stabilize the 
working environment and reduce personnel 
turnover.
It is the function of the union to act as 
a bargaining agent working in good faith 
with station employees and management 
to upgrade and improve working condi-
tions. Union efforts usually focus on salary, 
sick leave, vacation, promotion, hiring, 
­termination, working hours, and retirement 
benefits.
A unionized station appoints or elects a 
shop steward who works as a liaison between 
the union, which represents the employees, 
and the station’s management. Employees 
may lodge complaints or grievances with 
the shop steward, who will then review the 
union’s contract with the station and proceed 
accordingly. Station managers are obliged to

unions, whose prime objective is to protect 
and ensure the rights of station workers.
The Manager and Industry 
Associations
Every year, the NAB and a variety of spe-
cialized and regional organizations conduct 
conferences and seminars intended to 
generate industry awareness and unity. At 
these gatherings, held at various locations 
throughout the country, radio managers and 
station personnel exchange ideas and share 
experiences, which they bring back to their 
stations.
The largest broadcast industry trade orga-
nization is the NAB, which was originally 
conceived out of a need to improve operat-
ing conditions in the 1920s. Initially only a 
lobbying organization, the NAB has main-
tained that focus while expanding consider-
ably in scope. The primary objective of the 
organization is to support and promote the

In the mid-1990s, however, the National 
Radio Broadcasters’ Association, which 
merged with the NAB in the 1980s, threat-
ened to break from the organization for its 
alleged overemphasis on non-radio matters.
Thousands of radio stations also are 
members of the RAB, which was founded in 
1951, a time when radio’s fate was in serious 
jeopardy owing to the rise in television’s 
popularity. “The RAB is designed to serve 
as the sales and marketing arm of Amer-
ica’s commercial radio industry. Members 
include radio stations, broadcast groups, net-
works, station representatives, and associ-
ated industry organizations in every market 
in all 50 states,” explains Kenneth J. Costa.
Dozens of other broadcast trade organiza-
tions focus their attention on specific areas 
within the radio station, and regional and 
local broadcast organizations are ­numerous. 
The following list is a partial rundown 
of national organizations that support 
the efforts of radio broadcasters. A more

NAB membership dues are based on a 
voluntary declaration of a station’s annual 
gross revenues. The RAB and others take a 
similar approach. Some organizations require 
individual membership fees, which often are 
absorbed by the radio station as well.
Buying or Building a Radio 
Station
The process involved in the purchase of 
an existing radio facility is fairly complex. 
There is much to take into consideration. 
For one thing, it is rarely a quick and easy 
procedure because the FCC must approve 
of all station transfers (sales).
The FCC examines the background of any 
would-be station owner. Licensees must be 
U.S. citizens and must satisfy the ­following 
criteria, among others:
• Must not have a criminal record
• Must be able to prove financial stability
• Must have a solid personal and profes-
sional history.
Anyone interested in purchasing a radio 
property should employ the services of an 
attorney and/or broker who specializes in 
this area (consult Broadcasting and Cable 
Market Place for listings or contact the 
NAB).
The following points should be carefully 
considered before taking definitive action to 
purchase a station:
• Analyze the market in which the station 
is located.
• Evaluate the facilities and assets.
• Hire a technical consultant.
• Assess existing contracts, leases, and agree-
ments.
• Research financial records.
• Examine the Public File.
• Probe the FCC’s file.
According to radio station acquisition 
expert Erwin G. Krasnow, “The due dili-
gence process involved in the acquisition of 
a radio station typically includes a review of 
the general economic and operational con-
ditions, as well as such areas as the finan-
cial and accounting systems, programming, 
technical facilities, legal matters, market-
ing, employee benefits, and personnel and 
environmental matters. The objective of 
due diligence is to obtain information that 
will (a) influence the decision of whether 
or not to proceed with the acquisition; and 
(b) have an effect on the purchase price 
or working capital adjustment.”
Purchasing a broadcast property is unlike 
any other kind of acquisition because of the 
unique nature of the business. It is impor-
tant to keep in mind that in the end a station 
owner does not own a frequency. An opera-
tor is merely granted permission (a license) 
to propagate a signal for a prescribed period 
of time (7 years) and then must reapply to 
continue broadcasting.
If an individual wishes to create a station 
from scratch, an application for a CP must 
70	
CHAPTER 2 Station Management

be filled out and submitted to the FCC. 
This too is quite involved and requires 
special expertise; it is necessary to deter-
mine whether a new station can be accom-
modated on the existing broadcast bands in 
the area of proposed operation.
If it can be proven that an available fre-
quency exists and that no interference will 
occur, a CP may be granted. The applicant 
is then given a specified amount of time 
(usually 18 months) to commence and 
complete construction.
Before proceeding with a CP request, it 
is incumbent on the applicant to meet all 
of the criteria for station ownership set by 
the FCC. A new station must apply to the 
FCC for call letter acquisition. The station 
may request a particular set of calls, offer 
an existing station (possessing the calls it 
wants) a deal to transfer their calls to it, or 
take whatever the FCC issues it. Meanwhile, 
a station receives its frequency (kHz/MHz) 
from the FCC based on what is available in 
the allocation table for a particular market.
Radio company CEO Robin Martin 
offers the following criteria for station 
acquisition.
1.	The attractiveness and strength of the market: 
I view this criterion from the perspective 
of general economic health and growth, 
the number of outlets and competitiveness 
of radio and other media in the market, 
and the general livability of the market (a 
measure of whether the owner would like 
to visit often or live in the market).
2.	The signal coverage of the station: Not every 
station must be a Class B or C FM facil-
ity or a 50,000-W AM, but to be com-
petitive in the target market, the tower 
location and height, combined with the 
authorized power, must be sufficiently 
optimized for the signal to reach the busi-
ness and residential areas of the market 
with a signal that penetrates buildings 
and overcomes topographical obstruc-
tions so the average listener, in a car, at 
work, or home can listen on an average or 
subpar receiver. If listeners or advertisers 
can’t hear the station clearly, the station 
can’t expect to earn their loyalty even 
under the best of management.
3.	The reputation and legacy of the station: 
A key test of success in my due diligence 
of a station is the longevity of the sales 
force. The longer the average tenure of 
the incumbents and the more people 
on the sales force with over 5 years of 
service with the station, the greater the 
likelihood the station is well-regarded 
and successful in the marketplace. 
Another measure of this same success 
is the compensation of the middle half 
of the sales force. Disregarding both the 
best performers and the new recruits, 
higher compensation of the middle of 
the pack sales people indicates that the 
station has strong relationships with 
its advertisers as evidenced by their 
high renewal rate and great number of 
success stories (i.e., the station’s adver-
tising brings customers to the store). The 
success of the station and its competent 
management, along with the resulting 
good compensation, means that sales 
people like working at the station.
4.	The consistency of financial and ratings 
­performance: Long and steady growth in 
sales, cash flow, and ratings are a better 
predictor of future performance than 
recent or occasional sales spikes that 
propel performance up over a short period. 
Numerous changes in programming or 
promotional strategy, in rate philosophy, 
or in staff all indicate an unstable organi-
zation in search of the next new thing to 
FIGURE 2.15

71

the detriment of listeners and advertisers. 
The results of station performance will 
be uneven and unpredictable.
If the target station is a startup or a turn-
around, however, only the first two criteria 
apply meaningfully. The other main consid-
erations for this type of purchase would be 
the strength of the management team, the 
reasonableness of the well-researched busi-
ness plan, and the depth of finances the new 
owner brings to the deal.
1.  Radio managers face greater challenges 
than ever due to new audio competition 
and station consolidation. In addition, radio’s 
unique character requires that station man-
agers deal with a wide variety of talents and 
personalities.
2.  The authoritarian approach to manage-
ment implies that the general manager 
makes all of the policy decisions. The col-
laborative approach allows the general 
manager to involve other station staff in 
the formation of policy. The hybrid or chief-
collaborator approach combines elements 
of both the authoritarian and collaborative 
management models. The chief-collaborator 
management approach is most prevalent in 
radio today.
3.  To attain management status, an individ-
ual needs a solid formal education and prac-
tical experience in many areas of station 
operation – especially sales.
4.  Key managerial functions include oper-
ating in a manner that produces the great-
est profit, meeting corporate expectations, 
formulating station policy and seeing to its 
implementation, hiring and retaining good 
people, inspiring staff to do their best, train-
ing new employees, maintaining communi-
cation with all departments to ensure an 
excellent air product, and keeping an eye 
toward the future, especially in terms of how 
new technological applications, such as Web 
sites and HD, can enhance profitability.
5.  Station clustering and consolidation have 
changed the personnel landscape at sta-
tions as radio groups often concentrate the 
operation of several stations in one central 
location. Some of the positions in a station 
cluster include a market manager, director 
of sales, general sales manager, director of 
operations, and controller.
6.  In noncluster station environments, the 
operations manager is second only to the 
general manager at those outlets that have 
established this position. This individual 
supervises administrative staff, helps develop 
and implement station policy, handles 
departmental budgeting, functions as regu-
latory watchdog, and works as liaison with 
the community.
7.  The program director is responsible for 
format, hires and manages air staff, sched-
ules airshifts, monitors air-product quality, 
keeps abreast of competition, maintains 
the music library, complies with FCC 
rules, and directs the efforts of news and 
public affairs. The sales manager heads 
the sales staff, works with the station’s 
rep company, assigns account lists to sales 
people, establishes sales quotas, coordi-
nates sales promotions, and develops sales 
materials and rate cards. The chief engi-
neer operates within the FCC technical 
parameters; purchases, repairs, and main-
tains equipment; monitors signal fidelity; 
adapts studios for programming needs; sets 
up remote broadcasts; and works closely 
with programming.
8.  Managers hire individuals who possess a 
solid formal education, strong professional 
experience, ambition, a positive attitude, 
reliability, humility, honesty, self-respect, 
patience, enthusiasm, discipline, creativity, 
logic, and compassion.
9.  Says consultant Ed Shane, “The new radio 
paradigm is ‘manager as financial expert.’”

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

10.  Radio provides entertainment to the 
public and, in turn, sells the audience it 
attracts to advertisers. It is the station 
manager who must ensure a profit, but 
he or she must also maintain product 
integrity.
11.  To foster a positive community image, the 
station manager becomes actively involved in 
the community and devotes airtime to com-
munity concerns – even though the FCC has 
reduced a station’s obligation to do so.
12.  Although the station manager del-
egates responsibility for compliance with 
FCC regulations to appropriate department 
heads, the manager is ultimately responsible 
for protecting the license. Title 47, Part 73, 
of the Code of Federal Regulations contains 
the rules pertaining to radio broadcast oper-
ations. Updates of regulations are listed 
monthly in the Federal Register.
13.  Radio stations are required to maintain 
a Public File and to make it available to the 
public during normal business hours.
14.  The American Federation of Television 
and Radio Artists (AFTRA), the National 
Association of Broadcast Employees and 
Technicians (NABET), and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) 
are the unions most active in radio.
15.  The National Association of Broad-
casters (NAB) and the Radio Advertising 
Bureau (RAB) are among the largest radio 
trade industry organizations.
16.  A person must be a U.S. citizen to hold 
a broadcast license. The FCC investigates 
all would-be station owners. To put a new 
station on the air, a construction permit (CP) 
application must be submitted to the FCC.
17.  Call letters and frequencies are issued 
by the FCC.
18.  Radio group CEO Robin Martin says 
the following must be weighed during 
the station acquisition process: strength 
of market, coverage area of the signal, sta-
tion’s reputation, and financial and ratings 
performance.

CHAPTER 2 Station Management

Ultimately, says Emmis programmer Jimmy 
Steal, “Great programming remains a ­constant 
regardless of amount/source of competition 
and the type of ratings methodology. The 
core of successful programming has always 
been unique content, passionate/knowl-
edgeable/distinctive/engaging personalities, 
a consistent source of new music (format 
applicable, of course), and an overall presen-
tation that eschews a sense of fun, a sense 
of energy, a sense of drama (positive drama 
– maybe suspense is a better word here), 
and an overall friend to, or oasis from, the 
daily challenges in the lives of our listening 
constituencies.”
That said, programming in today’s daunt-
ing marketplace is no easy task, observes 
consultant Ed Shane. “The staff reductions 
in postconsolidation radio cause national 
chains to fill the time with something – 
often syndication or repurposed content 
from another market. Ryan Seacrest is a 
perfect example. Seacrest does his morning 
show at KISS in Los Angeles, then por-
tions of the program are edited and repack-
aged for other stations, mostly in the Clear 
Channel family (CC owns KISS), although 
the show is available to stations owned 
by companies other than Clear Channel. 
That reduces local radio to ‘repeater,’ not 
originator.”
Brief descriptions of some of the most 
frequently employed formats in radio today 
follow. There are a host of other formats, or 
subformats – more than 100, in fact. Many 
are variations of those listed. The reader 
should keep in mind that formats morph as 
new trends in lifestyle and culture emerge. 
Radio formats are anything but static.
Programming 3
Program Formats
“The devil is in the details,” wrote famed 
French author Gustave Flaubert, and for 
our purposes in this chapter, we could say 
that the devil is in the programming. Indeed, 
designing a radio station’s sound continues 
to be a bedeviling task, even as large radio 
companies cluster their outlets in the age 
of station consolidation. There is double 
the number of stations today competing 
for the audience’s attention than existed 
in the 1960s, and more continue to enter 
the fray. Other media have proliferated as 
well, resulting in a further distraction of 
radio’s customary audience. The govern-
ment’s laissez-faire, “let the marketplace 
dictate” philosophy, concerning commer-
cial radio programming gives the station 
great freedom in deciding the nature of its 
air product, but determining what to offer 
the listener, who is often presented with 
dozens of audio alternatives, involves intri-
cate planning. In the end, proffers Randy 
Michaels, “Programming is the key. Yes, 
I can hear my favorite songs on an iPod, 
but ‘sometimes you like to drive, some-
times you like to ride.’ A good program-
mer can create an experience that ‘shuffle’ 
cannot. The iPod won’t bring play by play 
sports, breaking news, or introduce me 
to something new. It won’t put events in 
context.”
The bottom-line, of course, is to air the 
type of format that will attract a sizable 
enough piece of the audience demographic 
to satisfy the advertiser. Once a station 
decides on the format it will program, then 
it must know how to effectively execute it. 
75 

the format themselves. The AC format is 
also one of the most effective in attracting 
female listeners.
AC outlets emphasize current and not 
so current (all the way back to the 1970s 
at some AC stations) pop standards, sans 
raucous, or harsh beats – in other words, 
no hard rock. Some AC stations could be 
described as soft rockers. However, the 
majority mix-in enough ballads and easy 
listening sounds to justify their title. The 
main thrust of this format’s programming 
is the music. More music is aired by deem-
phasizing chatter. Music is commonly pre-
sented in uninterrupted sweeps or blocks, 
perhaps 10–12 minutes in duration, fol-
lowed by a brief recap of artists and song 
titles. High-profile morning talent or teams 
became popular at AC stations in the 1980s 
and remain so today. Commercials ­generally 
Adult Contemporary
In terms of the number of listeners, Adult 
Contemporary (AC; also referred to as The 
Mix, Hot AC, Triple A, Urban AC, Soft AC, 
Spectrum AC, and Lite AC) was the most 
popular format in the 1980s and continues 
to draw impressive audiences in the new 
millennium (number 3 most tuned format 
according to Arbitron), although some sub-
categories have lost ground since the last 
edition of this book. Says consultant Ed 
Shane, “Because the AC target audience is 
so diverse, the format has been most prone 
to fragmentation and competition.”
AC is very strong among the 25–49-year  
age group, which makes it particularly 
appealing to advertisers, since this demo-
graphic group has significant disposable 
income. Also, some advertisers spend money 
on AC stations simply because they like

are clustered at predetermined times, and

ments. News and sports are secondary to the 
music. In recent years, ACs have spawned a 
host of permutations, such as Adult Hits 
and Adult Standards, as well as the iPod 
wannabe formats, known as Jack and Mike, 
which typically distinguish themselves 
from their AC counterparts by featuring a 
broader playlist, sometimes venturing as far 
back as the 1960s for music selections. In 
the late 2000s, according to Arbitron, the 
AC subgenre showing the most growth was 
Urban AC.
Contemporary Hit Radio
Once known as Top 40, Contemporary 
Hit Radio (CHR) stations play only those 
records that currently are the fastest selling. 
CHR’s narrow playlists are designed to 
draw teens and young adults. The heart of 
this format’s demographic is the 12–18 year 
olds, although in the mid-1980s it enjoyed a 
broadening of its core audience. Like AC, it 
too has experienced erosion in its numbers 
in recent years. In the Journal of Radio 
Studies (1995–1996), Ed Shane observed 
that the format “was a statistical loser in the 
1990s. What futurist Alvin Toffler called ‘the 
demassification of media’ affected CHR the 
most. There were too many types of music 
to play. No one radio station could create a 
format with elements as diverse as rapper 
Ice T, rockers like Nirvana, country artists 
like George Strait and Randy Travis, or jazz 
musicians like Kenny G or David Benoit. 
Each of those performers fits someone’s 
definition of ‘contemporary hit radio.’ CHR 
lost its focus.”
Consultant Jeff Pollack believed that 
CHR had lost ground because it was not 
in tune with what he called the “streets,” 
and he predicted that the format would 
embrace a more dance-rap sound as well as 
develop more appreciation for alternative 
rock hits. The format is characterized by its 
swift and often unrelenting pace. Silence, 
known as “dead air,” is the enemy. The idea 
is to keep the sound hot and tight to keep 
the kids from station hopping, which is no 
small task since many markets have at least 
two hit-oriented stations.
In the 1995 interview in Radio Ink, 
­programmer Bill Richards predicted that 
the high-intensity jock approach would give 
way to a more laid-back, natural sound. “The 
days of the ‘move over and let the big dog 
eat’ sweepers are over. Top 40 will look for 
more jocks who sound like real people and 
shy away from the hyped deejay approach.” 
CHR deejays have undergone several shifts 
in status since the inception of the chart 
music format in the 1950s. Initially, pop 
deejay personalities played an integral role 
in the air sound. However, in the mid-1960s, 
the format underwent a major change when 
deejay presence was significantly reduced. 
Programming innovator Bill Drake decided 
that the Top 40 sound needed to be refur-
bished and tightened. Thus, deejay talk and 
even the number of commercials scheduled 
each hour were cut back to improve the 
flow. Despite criticism that the new sound 
was too mechanical, Drake’s technique suc-
ceeded at strengthening the format’s hold 
on the listening audience.
In the mid- and late 1970s, the dee-
jay’s role on hit stations began to regain 
its former prominence, but in the 1980s, 
the format underwent a further renovation 
(initiated by legendary consultant Mike 
Joseph) that resulted in a narrowing of its 
playlist and a decrease in deejay presence. 
Super or Hot Hit stations, as they also are 
called, were among the most popular in 
the country and could be found either near 
or at the top of the rating charts in their 
markets.
At the moment, at least, CHR has a bit 
less of a frenetic quality to it and perhaps a 
more mature sound. Undergoing an image 
adjustment, the format is keying in on 
improving overall flow while pulling back 
on jumping aboard the fad bandwagon. The 
continued preening of the playlist will keep 
the format viable, say the experts.
News is of secondary importance on 
CHR stations. In fact, many program direc-
tors (PDs) consider news programming to 
be a tune-out factor. “Kids don’t like news,” 
they claim. However, despite deregulation, 
which has freed stations of nonentertain-
ment program requirements, most retain at 
least a modicum of news out of a sense of 
obligation. CHR stations are very promo-
tion minded and contest oriented.

Fewer than 500 stations (nearly all FM) 
call themselves CHR. Many of these stations 
prefer to be called Rhythm Hits (Churban 
fell out of favor in the late 1990s), which 
combines urban and rock hits, or Pop CHR/
Modern Hits, a narrower-based version of 
Top 40 that draws its playlist from MTV/
VH1 and college stations.
Country
Since the 1970s, the Country format has 
been adopted by more stations than any 
other. Although seldom a leader in the 
ratings race until recent years, its appeal 
is exceptionally broad. An indication of 
country music’s rising popularity is the fact 
that there are over 10 times as many full-
time Country stations today than there were 
25 years ago. Although the format is far 
more prevalent in the South and Midwest, 
most medium and large markets in the 
North have Country stations. Due to the 
diversity of approaches within the format – 
for example, traditional, middle-of-the road 
(MOR), contemporary hit, and so on – the 
Country format attracts a broad age group, 
appealing to young as well as older adults. 
“The Country format has scored very high 
among 25–54-year-olds,” adds Burkhart.
Says Shane, “In spite of predictions, 
Country has not fragmented. There are ways 
to skew the format for older or younger 
demos, but each group demands essentially 
the same music. The difference is in presen-
tation and content between the songs.”
Country radio has always been particu-
larly popular among blue-collar workers.

CHAPTER 3 Programming

and the Organization of Country Radio 
­Broadcasters, the Country music format is 
drawing a more upscale audience today than 
it did in the past. As many FM as AM sta-
tions are programming the Country sound 
in the 2000s, which was not the case just a 
few years ago. Until the 1980s, Country was 
predominantly an AM offering. ­Depending 
on the approach they employ, Country 
outlets may emphasize or deemphasize 
air personalities, include news and public 
affairs features, or confine their program-
ming almost exclusively to music.
According to some programming experts, 
the Country format peaked in the mid-1990s, 
but Arbitron’s “National Radio Format Share 
and Station Counts” in 2008 indicated oth-
erwise, as the format led all others in terms 
of audience size (12.7 share) and station’s 
claiming to be Country – 1683.
Soft Adult/Easy Listening/Smooth 
Jazz
The Beautiful Music station of the 1960s 
became the Easy Listening or Soft Adult 
station of the 2000s. Playlists in this format 
have been carefully updated in an attempt 
to attract a somewhat younger audience. 
The term Beautiful Music was exchanged 
for Easy Listening in an effort to dispel the 
geriatric image the former term seemed to 
convey. Easy Listening is the ultimate “wall-
to-wall” music format. Talk of any type is 
kept minimal, although many stations in 
this format concentrate on news and infor-
mation during morning drive time.
Instrumentals and soft vocals of estab-
lished songs are a mainstay at Soft Adult/
Easy Listening stations, which also share a 
penchant for lush orchestrations ­featuring

become replacement nomenclatures for 
Easy Listening, which, like its predecessor, 
Beautiful Music, began to assume a geriatric 
connotation.
Rock and Alternative
The birth of the Album Oriented Rock 
(AOR) format in the late 1960s (also called 
Underground and Progressive) was the result 
of a basic disdain for the highly formulaic 
Top 40 sound that prevailed at the time. In 
the summer of 1966, WOR-FM, New York, 
introduced Progressive radio, the  forerun-
ner of AOR. As an alternative to the super-
hyped, ultra-commercial sound of  the hit 
song station, WOR-FM programmed an 
unorthodox combination of nonchart rock, 
blues, folk, and jazz. In the 1970s, the 
format concentrated its attention almost 
plenty of strings. These stations boast a 
devoted audience.
Station hopping is uncommon. Efforts to 
draw younger listeners into the Easy Listen-
ing fold have been moderately successful, 
but most of the format’s primary adherents 
are over 50 years. Music syndicators provide 
prepackaged (canned) programming to 
approximately half of the nation’s Easy Lis-
tening/Soft Adult/Smooth Jazz stations, and 
over three-quarters of the outlets within this 
format utilize computer-automated systems 
to varying degrees. Easy Listening has lost 
some ground in the 1990s and 2000s to 
AC and other adult-appeal formats such as 
Album Adult Alternative and something 
called New Age, which some media critics 
describe as Easy Listening for Yuppies.
Soft Adult, Lite and Easy, Smooth Jazz, 
Adult Standards, and Urban AC have

have to be cool and hip without ­sounding 
exclusive. We have to be edgy without being 
offensive. Be smart without sounding conde-
scending. Young and upbeat without sound-
ing immature. As long as those balances are 
maintained on a daily basis, we will continue 
to have success in this format.”
News and Talk
There are News, News/Talk, News Sports, 
News Plus, and Talk formats, and each is dis-
tinct and unique unto itself. News stations 
differ from the others in that they devote 
their entire air schedule to the presentation 
of news and news-related stories and fea-
tures. The All-News format was introduced 
by Gordon McLendon at XETRA (known 
as XTRA) in Tijuana, Mexico, in the early 
1960s. Its success soon inspired the spread of 
the format in the United States. Because of 
the enormous expense involved in presentat-
ing a purely News format, requiring three to 
four times the staff and budget of most music 
operations, the format has been confined to 
larger markets able to support the endeavor.
The News/Talk format is a hybrid. It 
combines extensive news coverage with 
blocks of two-way telephone conversations. 
These stations commonly “daypart” or seg-
mentalize their programming by presenting 
lengthened newscasts during morning and 
afternoon drive time hours and conversa-
tion in the midday and evening periods. 
The News/Talk combo was conceived by 
KGO in San Francisco in the 1960s and 
has gradually gained in popularity so that 
it now leads both the strictly News and the 
Talk formats. Talk radio began at KABC-
AM, Los Angeles, in 1960. However, talk 
shows were familiar to listeners in the 
1950s, since a number of adult music sta-
tions devoted a few hours during evenings 
or overnight to call-in programs. The moti-
vation behind most early Talk programming 
stemmed from a desire to strengthen weak 
time slots while satisfying public affairs pro-
gramming requirements. Like its nonmusic 
siblings, Talk became a viable format in the 
1960s and does well today, although it too 
has suffered due to greater competition. 
In contrast to All-News, which attracts a 
slightly younger and more upscale audience,  
All-Talk amasses a large following among 
exclusively on album rock, while becoming 
less freeform and more formulaic and sys-
tematic in its programming approach.
Today, AOR often is simply called Rock, 
or more specifically Modern Rock or Classic 
Rock, and although it continues to do well 
in garnering the 18–34-year-old male, this 
format has always done poorly in winning 
female listeners, especially when it empha-
sizes a heavy or hard-rock playlist. This 
has proven to be a sore spot with certain 
advertisers. In the 1980s, the format lost its 
prominence owing, in part, to the meteoric 
rebirth of hit radio. However, as the decade 
came to an end, AOR had regained a chunk 
of its numbers, and in the 1990s, it renamed 
itself Modern Rock.
Generally, Rock stations broadcast their 
music in sweeps or at least segue two or 
three songs. A large airplay library is typical, 
in which 300–700 cuts may be active. 
Depending on the outlet, the deejay may 
or may not have “personality” status. In fact, 
the more-music/less-talk approach particu-
larly common at Easy Listening stations is 
emulated by many album rockers. Conse-
quently, news plays a very minor part in the 
station’s programming efforts.
Rock (also called Active Rock) stations 
are very lifestyle-oriented and invest great 
time and energy developing promotions 
relevant to the interests and attitudes of 
their listeners. Reflecting the considerable 
drift away from the AOR nomenclature and 
model, WBCN’s longtime PD, Oedipus, 
declared to the world in 1995, “We’re 
Modern Rock!”
The Alternative Rock format tries for dis-
tinctiveness. That is to say, it attempts to 
provide a choice that is in contrast to the other 
Rock radio approaches. Creating this alter-
native sound is a challenge, says Stephanie 
Hindley, PD of Buzz 99.9: “The Alternative 
format is a great challenge for programmers. 
Think of the music you liked and the things 
you did when you were 18. Now think of 
the music you liked (or will like) and the 
things you did (or will do) at age 34. Despite 
the vast differences in taste in the 18–34 
demographic, we need to play music that 
will appeal to as many people as possible 
within this diverse group. It’s a ­constant bal-
ancing act. We have to play a lot of new 
music without sounding too unfamiliar. We

radio and  ­significantly contributed to the 
­dominance of “chatter” radio in the ratings. 
Today, several hundred stations offer around-
the-clock sports talk, among them WFAN 
and WEEI in the Northeast and KLAC and 
KJR on the West Coast. In addition, several 
sports networks now appear across the radio 
band. Since the mid-1990s, ESPN Radio 
Network, Fox Sports Radio, and Sporting 
News Radio have emerged and are now 
carried by stations throughout the country. 
If AM radio is able to claim a younger demo-
graphic at all, it is because men 18–29 are big 
fans of sports radio. Meanwhile, All Sports 
has begun to migrate to FM in ­significant 
numbers.
According to Arbitron, All Sports ranked 
13th among formats at the start of 2009 
with over 14 million weekly listeners. More 
men tune All Sports radio than women, 
and the audience is almost exclusively over 
25 years old. It is a highly educated audi-
ence with an upper-income.
Consultant Ed Shane makes this obser-
vation regarding the success of the format. 
“The element of ‘guy talk’ is an important 
factor and one of the central ingredients 
that gives this format its special appeal.”
FM Talk
Perhaps the most unique manifestation in 
nonmusic radio is the growing presence of 
talk on FM. Talent consultant Jason Insa-
laco gives his perspective on the rise of the 
discourse format on what has always been 
the dial for music: “While traditional AM 
talk has been profiled in recent years for 
its explosion onto the radio landscape, FM 
talk radio has become a popular format for 
an audience previously ignored by talk pro-
grammers. FM talk’s primary audience is 
25–44 years old. This demographic likely 
did not grow up listening to AM talk radio. 
In fact, the FM talk audience has very likely 
tuned AM very little during its lifetime. FM 
talk does not program itself like a traditional 
full-service AM talk outlet. There is not the 
emphasis on news and traffic, which is a 
staple of the AM talkers. Rather FM talk’s 
focus is personality driven, aka Mancow, 
Tom Leykis, and Opie and Anthony. These 
FM talk stalwarts do incorporate some 
news into their programs, but the main 
blue-collar workers and retirees, and in 2008 
was classified as the second most popular 
format in radio.
One of the recent news and information-
oriented formats calls itself News Plus. Even 
though its emphasis is on news, it fills periods 
with music, often AC in flavor. News Plus 
stations also may carry a heavy schedule of 
sporting events. This combination did well 
for a while in several medium and large 
markets but began to fizzle in favor of newer 
permutations in the early 2000s.
News and/or Talk formats are primarily 
located on the AM band, where they have 
become increasingly prevalent since FM has 
captured all but a few of radio’s music lis-
teners. Meanwhile, the number of nonmusic 
formats is significantly increasing on FM, 
and this trend is predicted to continue as 
music listeners rely more and more on other 
audio sources.
In the late 1990s, over 1000 stations 
offered the information and/or news format. 
This was up nearly 300% since the late 1980s. 
In 2008, Arbitron claimed in excess of 1500 
stations aired the talk format. Over 100 sta-
tions alone concentrated on sports exclu-
sively, and dozens of others were beginning 
to splinter and compartmentalize into news/
info niches, such as auto, health, computer, 
food, business, tourism, and entertainment.
National talk networks and syndicated 
talk shows, mostly of a conservative nature, 
continued to draw huge audiences in the 
new millennium, as more and more Baby 
Boomers became engaged in the political 
and social dialogues of the day. Despite the 
fact that a liberal talk radio network (Air 
America) debuted in the 2000s, its recep-
tion was anything but stellar as right-wing 
hosts (Rush Limbaugh being the king among 
them) continued to rule the genre.
An indication that the information format 
is achieving broader appeal among younger 
listeners is the recent emergence on the FM 
dial of a new hybrid called Talk ‘n’ Rock. This 
format variation to the mainstream Talk tem-
plate has yet to find a viable audience niche.
All Sports
The trend in the last few years in the 
proliferation of the All-Sports format 
has boosted the  popularity of nonmusic 
82	
CHAPTER 3 Programming

Nostalgia is a highly syndicated format, and 
most stations go out-of-house for program-
ming material. Because much of the music 
predates stereo processing, AM outlets are 
most apt to carry the Nostalgia sound. 
Music is invariably presented in sweeps, and, 
for the most part, deejays maintain a low 
profile. Similar to Easy Listening, Nostalgia 
pushes its music to the forefront and keeps 
other program elements at an unobtrusive 
distance. In the 1980s, Easy Listening/­
Beautiful Music stations lost some listeners 
to this format, which claimed a viable share 
of the radio audience.
The Oldies format was first introduced in 
the 1960s by programmers Bill Drake and 
Chuck Blore. Although Nostalgia’s audience 
tends to be over the age of 50, most Oldies 
listeners are somewhat younger. Unlike 
­Nostalgia, most Oldies outlets ­originate their 
own programming, and very few are auto-
mated. In contrast with its vintage music 
cousin, the Oldies format allows greater 
deejay presence. At many Oldies stations, 
air personalities play a key role. Music is 
rarely broadcast in sweeps, and commercials, 
rather than being clustered, are inserted in a 
random fashion between songs.
Consultant Kent Burkhart noted that in 
the early 1990s, “Oldies stations are scoring 
very big in a nice broad demographic. These 
stations are doing quite well today, and this 
should hold for a while.” That said, in 2008 
Arbitron reported that the Oldies format 
experienced the sharpest decline in audience 
numbers of all the vintage-oriented stations –  
with 30 stations dropping the sound in just 
1 year. At the same time, Nostalgia has not 
been shown as having much growth but 
remains fairly solid in some markets. In the 
1990s, Oldies outlets lost audience ground. 
However, over 700 stations still call them-
selves Oldies or Nostalgia. Meanwhile, a 
more dance/contemporary approach, called 
“Jammin’ Oldies,” has attracted additional 
listeners.
Meanwhile Classic Rock and Classic Hit 
stations emerged as the biggest winners 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and of 
the vintage format genres, they can boast 
the biggest audience shares in last part 
of  the  2000s. These yesteryear music sta-
tions draw their playlists from the chart 
toppers (primarily in the rock music area) 
focus is entertainment. FM talk programs 
itself more like an FM music station than 
an AM talk station. It features shorter seg-
ments covering a variety of issues in con-
trast to the 1-hour AM talk sweep. Issues 
discussed typically come from sources like 
Rolling Stone and People magazine and the 
local sports and entertainment section of 
the newspaper. Topics are not necessarily 
caller intensive as with most AM talkers. 
Listener participation is a part of FM talk 
radio; however, there is not the typical 
­topic-monologue-caller participation cycle 
of AM talkers. Moreover, the ‘bumper music’ 
played to intro segments of FM talk comes 
from the latest alternative and rock artists 
found on the competing music stations. This 
gives the station a youthful sound and grabs 
the potential talk listener who is scanning 
the dial. FM talk’s competition comes from 
Alternative/Modern Rock/AOR and Classic 
Rock stations. The future of FM talk looks 
bright. Expect the format to become more 
widespread in the coming years.”
Clearly, the number of FM talk outlets 
in major markets is on the increase. A good 
example is 96.9 FM in Boston, which has 
made serious inroads into the nonmusic 
radio arena. In recent surveys, it has chal-
lenged the city’s long-standing talk-oriented 
stations on AM, a feat that is being dupli-
cated in other markets around the country.
Classic/Oldies/Nostalgia
Although these formats are not identical, 
they derive the music they play from years 
gone by. Although the Nostalgia station, 
sometimes referred to as Big Band, con-
structs its playlist around tunes popular 
as far back as the 1940s and 1950s, the 
Oldies outlet focuses its attention on the 
pop tunes of the late 1950s and 1960s. A 
typical Oldies quarter-hour might consist of 
songs by Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, 
the Beatles, Brian Hyland, Three Dog Night, 
and the Ronettes. In contrast, a Nostalgia 
quarter-hour might consist of tunes from 
the prerock era performed by artists like 
Frankie Lane, Les Baxter, the Mills Brothers, 
Tommy Dorsey, and popular ballad singers 
of the last few decades.
Nostalgia radio caught on in the late 
1970s, the concept of programmer Al Ham. 
Program Formats

ing this format usually are located in met-
ropolitan areas with large, heterogeneous 
populations. UC was born in the early 1980s, 
the offspring of the short-lived Disco format, 
which burst onto the scene in 1978. What 
characterizes UC the most is its upbeat, 
danceable sound and deejays who are hip, 
friendly, and energetic. Although UC outlets 
stress danceable tunes, their playlists gener-
ally are anything but narrow. However, a 
particular sound may be given preference 
over another, depending on the demographic 
composition of the ­population in the area 
that the station serves. For example, UC 
outlets may play greater amounts of music 
of the 1970s and 1980s (and early 1990s) 
and often appear in the top 10 ratings.
Classic Rock concentrates on tunes essen-
tially featured by former AOR stations over 
the past two decades, whereas Classic Hit 
stations fill the gap between Oldies and 
CHR outlets with playlists that draw from 
1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Top 40 charts.
Urban Contemporary
Considered the “melting pot” format, Urban 
Contemporary (UC), attracts large numbers 
of Hispanic and Black listeners, as well as 
white. As the term suggests, stations employ-

CHAPTER 3 Programming

Classical
Although there are fewer than three-dozen 
full-time commercial Classical radio sta-
tions in the country, no other format can 
claim a more loyal following. Despite small 
numbers and soft ratings, most Classical sta-
tions do manage to generate a modest to 
good income. Over the years, profits have 
remained relatively minute in comparison 
to other formats. However, member stations 
of the Concert Music Broadcasters Associa-
tion reported ad revenue increases of up to 
40% in the 1980s and 1990s with contin-
ued growth, albeit modest, in the 2000s. 
Owing to its upscale audience, blue-chip 
accounts find the format an effective buy. 
This is first and foremost an FM format, and 
it has broadcast over the megahertz band 
for almost as long as it has existed.
In many markets, commercial Classi-
cal stations have been affected by public 
radio outlets programming classical music. 
Since commercial Classical stations must 
break to air the sponsor messages that 
keep them operating, they must adjust 
their playlists accordingly. This may mean 
shorter cuts of music during particular 
dayparts – in other words, less music. The 
noncommercial Classical outlet is relatively 
free of such ­constraints and thus benefits 
as a result. A case in point is WCRB-FM 
in Boston, the city’s only full-time Clas-
sical station. Although it attracts most of 
with a Latin or rhythm-and-blues flavor, 
whereas others may air larger proportions 
of light jazz, reggae, new rock, or hip hop. 
Some AM stations around the country have 
adopted the UC format; however, it is more 
likely to be found on the FM side, where it 
has taken numerous stations to the forefront 
of their market’s ratings.
UC has had an impact on Black stations, 
which have experienced erosion in their 
youth numbers. Many Black stations have 
countered by broadening their playlists to 
include artists who are not traditionally pro-
grammed. Because of their high-intensity, 
fast-paced sound, UC outlets can give a 
Top 40 impression, but in contrast, they 
commonly segue songs or present music 
in sweeps and give airplay to lengthy cuts, 
sometimes 6–8 minutes long. Although Top 
40 or CHR stations seldom program cuts 
lasting more than 4 minutes, UC outlets 
find long cuts or remixes compatible with 
their programming approach. Remember, 
UCs are very dance oriented. Newscasts 
play a minor role in this format, which 
caters to a target audience aged 18–34. 
Contests and promotions are important 
program elements.
As noted earlier, several CHR stations 
have adopted urban artists to offer the 
hybrid Churban or Rhythm Hits sound. 
Likewise, many Urban outlets have drawn 
from the more mainstream CHR playlist in 
an attempt to expand their listener base.
FIGURE 3.6
Dozens of other 
formats (often 
variations on 
those listed) have 
emerged since the

specialization in

aired a service from a chapel in ­Washington, 
DC. Not long after that, KFSG in Los Angeles 
and WMBI in Chicago began to devote them-
selves to religious programming. Soon dozens 
of other radio outlets were broadcasting the 
message of God. In the 1980s, over 600 sta-
tions broadcast religious formats on a full-
time basis, and another 1500 stations air at 
least 6 hours of religious features on a weekly 
basis. M Street Journal reports that over 900 
stations air the Religious format today.
Religious broadcasters typically follow 
one of two programming approaches. One 
includes music as part of its presentation, 
and the other does not. The Religious 
station that features music often programs 
contemporary tunes containing a Christian 
or life-affirming perspective. Broadcast edu-
cator Janet McMullen finds that program-
ming Contemporary Christian is a challenge 
for a number of reasons. “With the broad 
the area’s Classical listeners throughout the 
afternoon and evening hours, it loses many 
patrons to public radio WGBH’s classical 
segments. At least in part, public radio’s 
success consists of having fewer interrup-
tions in programming.
Classical stations target the 25–49-year-
old, higher income, college-educated listener. 
News  is typically presented at 60–90-min-
ute intervals and generally runs from 5–10 
minutes. The format is characterized by 
a conservative, straightforward air sound. 
Sensationalism and hype are avoided, and 
on-air contests and promotions are as rare as 
announcer chatter.

tal stage. In 1919, the U.S. Army Signal Corps

place. Today, Progressive Black stations, such 
as WBLS-FM, New York, combine dance 
music with soulful rock and contemporary 
jazz, and many have transcended the color 
barrier by including certain white artists on 
their playlists. In fact, many Black stations 
employ white air personnel in efforts to 
broaden their demographic base. WILD-AM 
in Boston, long considered the city’s Black 
station, is an example of this trend. “We have 
become more of a general appeal station than 
a purely ethnic one. We’ve had to in order to 
prosper. We strive for a distinct, yet neuter 
or deethnicized, sound on the air. The Black 
format has changed considerably over the 
years,” notes longtime PD Elroy Smith. The 
old-line R&B and gospel stations still exist 
and can be found mostly in the South.
Hispanic
Hispanic or Spanish-language stations con- 
stitute 
another 
large 
ethnic 
format. 
KCOR-AM, San Antonio, became the first 
All-Spanish station in 1947, just a matter of 
months after WDIA-AM in Memphis put 
the Black format on the air. Cities with large 
Latin populations are able to support the 
format, and in some metropolitan areas with 
vast numbers of Spanish-speaking residents, 
such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, 
several radio outlets are devoted exclusively 
to Hispanic programming. Reported Arbitron 
in 2008, “As their population continued to 
surge in the United States, Hispanics increased 
the percentage of their representation in 15 
of the 20 non-Spanish-language formats in 
our report, averaging 1.1% more in audience 
composition than in Spring 2006. The only 
formats where Hispanics made up a smaller 
proportion of a format’s listenership were 
UC, Oldies, Alternative and Active Rock.”
Programming approaches within the for- 
mat are not unlike those prevalent at Anglo 
stations. That is to say, Spanish-language radio 
stations also modify their sound to draw a 
specific demographic. For example, many 
offer contemporary music for younger lis-
teners and more traditional music for older 
listeners.
Ed Shane views Hispanic radio as very 
diverse and vibrant. “An impressive multiplic-
ity of programming styles and approaches are 
found in this format. Here in Houston, for 
scope of denominations possessing varying 
beliefs, it is sometimes very hard to keep 
the listening public happy. It is a very fine 
line to walk. You have to be careful not 
to offend or alienate listeners, even in our 
format. This requires careful and thought-
ful programming.” The religious format 
approach also includes the scheduling of 
blocks of religious features and programs. 
Nonmusic Religious outlets concentrate on 
inspirational features and complementary 
talk and informational shows.
Religious broadcasters claim that their 
spiritual messages reach nearly half of the 
nation’s radio audience, and the American 
Research Corporation in Irvine, California, 
contends that over 25% of those tuned to 
Religious stations attend church more fre-
quently. Two-thirds of the country’s Reli-
gious radio stations broadcast over AM 
frequencies.
An indication of the continued popular-
ity of Religious radio in the latter part of 
the 1990s was the launch of ChristianNet, a 
network that offers talk shows from some of 
the biggest names in conservative chatter.
Black/African American
African Americans constitute the largest 
minority in the nation, thus making Black 
one of the most prominent ethnic formats. 
Over 300 radio stations gear themselves 
to the needs and desires of Black listeners. 
WDIA-AM in Memphis claims to be the 
first station to program exclusively to a non-
white audience. It introduced the format in 
1947. Initially, the growth of this format was 
gradual, but in the 1960s, as the Motown 
sound took hold of the hit charts and the 
Black Pride movement got under way, more 
Black stations entered the airways.
At its inception, the Disco craze in the 
1970s brought new listeners to the Black 
stations, which shortly saw their fortunes 
change when All-Disco stations began to 
surface. Many Black outlets witnessed an 
exodus of their younger listeners to the 
Disco stations. This prompted a number of 
Black stations to abandon their more tradi-
tional playlists, which consisted of rhythm 
and blues, gospel, and soul tunes, for exclu-
sively Disco music. When Disco perished 
in the early 1980s, the UC format took its

its large-market audience has decreased 
over the years, particularly since 1980, due 
to the rise in popularity of more specialized 
formats. According to radio program special-
ist Dick Ellis, FS now has a predominantly 
over-40 age demographic, several years 
older than just a decade ago. In some major 
markets, the format continues to do well in 
the ratings mainly because of strong on-air 
personalities. But this is not the format that 
it once was. Since its inception in the 1950s, 
up through the 1970s, stations working the 
MOR sound often dominated their markets. 
Yet the Soft Rock and Oldies formats in 
the 1970s, the updating of Easy Listening 
(Smooth Jazz), and particularly the ascen-
dancy of AC and Talk formats have con-
spired to significantly erode MOR (now FS) 
numbers. For instance, M Street Journal cites 
fewer than 100 of these stations today.
FS is the home of the on-air personality. 
Perhaps no other format gives its air people 
as much latitude and freedom. This is not to 
suggest that FS announcers may do as they 
please. They, like any other announcer, must 
abide by format and programming policy, 
but FS personalities often serve as the cor-
nerstone of their station’s air product. Some 
of the best-known deejays in the country 
have come from the FS (MOR) milieu. It 
would then follow that the music is rarely, 
if ever, presented in sweeps or even segued. 
Deejay patter occurs between each cut of 
music, and announcements are inserted in 
the same way. News and sports play another 
vital function at these stations. During drive 
periods, FS often presents lengthened blocks 
of news, replete with frequent traffic reports, 
weather updates, and the latest sports infor-
mation. Many FS outlets are affiliated with 
major-league teams. With few exceptions, 
FS is an AM format. Although it has noted 
slippage in recent years, it will likely con-
tinue to bridge whatever gaps may exist in 
a highly specialized radio marketplace.
Niche and HD2 Formats
Experts say that the Alternative formats, 
with their narrower focus on specific 
demographic segments, will enjoy greater 
success in the coming years. In an ­interview 
in Broadcasting and Cable, Jeff Pollack 
predicted formats offering more nontra-
example, we have two brands of Tejano, one 
of Exitos (hits), a lot of Ranchera, and a couple 
of Talk stations. In the Rio Grande Valley of 
Texas, there’s a lush, instrumental-and-vocal 
‘Easy Listening’ station in Spanish. The L.A. 
dial is full of Hispanic nuance. Miami, like-
wise, and it has a totally different slant.”
Many Hispanic women are drawn to an 
approach called The Groove, which mixes 
Motown and Latin pop artists. The format 
is marketed by Interstar Programming.
Spanish media experts predicted that 
there would be a significant increase in the 
number of Hispanic stations through the 
2000s, and they were right. Much of this 
growth occurred on the AM band but later 
spread rapidly on FM.
Ethnic
Hundreds of other radio stations country-
wide apportion a significant piece of their air 
schedules (over 20 hours weekly), if not all, 
to foreign-language programs in Portuguese, 
German, Polish, Greek, Japanese, and so on.
Around 30 stations broadcast exclusively 
to American Indians and Eskimos and are 
licensed to Native Americans. Today, these 
stations are being fed programming from 
American Indian Radio on Satellite (AIROS), 
and other indigenous media groups predict 
dozens more Indian-operated stations by 
the end of the next decade. Meanwhile, the 
number of stations broadcasting to Asians 
and other nationalities is rising.
Full Service
The Full Service (FS) format (also called 
Variety, General Appeal, Diversified, etc.) 
attempts to provide its mostly middle-
age listeners a mix of all programming 
genres – music, news, sports, and informa-
tion features. Known for years as MOR, 
the format has attempted to strengthen 
its public service aspect through increased 
information programming. It is really one-
stop shopping for listeners who would like 
a little bit of everything. Today, this type 
of station exists mostly in small markets 
where stations attempt to be good-citizen 
radio for everyone. It has been called the 
bridge format because of its “all things to all 
people” programming approach. However,

culture. We want specific things, not a little 
bit of everything. We’re picky, selfish, brand 
loyal people. Have buffets taken over the 
Italian, Indian, French, Chinese, and Thai 
restaurants? Of course not! Jack is the radio 
buffet – stale, lukewarm, and boring.”
At best, the preceding is an incomplete 
list of myriad radio formats that serve the 
listening public. The program formats men-
tioned constitute the majority of the basic 
format categories prevalent today. Tomor-
row? Who knows? Radio is hardly a static 
industry, but one subject to the whims of 
popular taste. When something new cap-
tures the imagination of the American 
public, radio responds, and often a new 
format is conceived.
Public Radio
Like college stations, most Public radio 
outlets program in a block fashion. That 
is to say, few employ a primary (single) 
format, but instead offer a mix of program 
ingredients, such as news and information 
and entertainment features. National Public 
Radio and Public Radio International, along 
with state Public radio systems, provide 
a myriad of features for the hundreds of 
ditional approaches to mainstream music 
(e.g., Modern Rock and Rhythmic Oldies) 
would be the ratings winners of the next 
few years. The intense fragmentation of the 
listening pool means that the big umbrella 
formats are going to lose out to the ultra-
specific ones.
Alternative Rock, which has never fully 
enjoyed star status, was expected to move up 
toward the front of the pack in the new mil-
lennium. Of course, when it comes to format 
prognostication, the term unpredictable takes 
on a whole new meaning. Indeed, there will 
be a rash of successful niche formats in the 
coming years, due to the ever-increasing frag-
mentation of the radio audience, but exactly 
what they will be is anyone’s guess.
A few years back, no one thought that 
All-Children’s Radio (Radio Disney, Radio 
Aahs) would draw an economically attrac-
tive segment of the listening public, but 
today it is one of the most successful niches 
on the dial (mostly on AM at this writing), 
and there are many other wannabes enter-
ing the cluttered airwaves. New niche 
or splinter formats emerge frequently  – 
Active Rock and Christian Talk are good 
­examples  –  in an industry always on the 
lookout for the next best thing and compet-
ing with a myriad of other listening options. 
In an MP3 and iPhone world, staying fresh 
and current gives radio an edge – one that 
is more and more necessary as the audio 
landscape changes.
In terms of future format innovations, the 
rollout of HD2 side-channels may acceler-
ate the rollout of new niche formats. Says 
Lynn Christian, “Unique programming ideas 
or concepts best suited to an audio presenta-
tion with great potential in all-size markets, 
while utilizing the new HD/HD2 channels, 
has the greatest potential.” However, some 
programmers, such as WIZN/WBTZ’s Matt 
Grasso, don’t expect much to change in the 
foreseeable future. “I don’t think the formats 
will change much. I think the change will 
be within each format. Stations will focus 
on being more local. It’s our biggest strength 
against satellite. We’re here. Let’s entrench 
ourselves into the community and become 
an important and integral part of their lives. 
The only format I can see changing is the so-
called ‘Jack’ format. This knee-jerky response 
to iPods doesn’t seem to fit the American

On Public Radio
Mike Janssen
Public radio facilities around the country. 
Topping the list of prominent music genres 
are classical and jazz. Public radio news 
broadcasts, among them “Morning Edition,” 
“All Things Considered,” and “The Take-
away,” lead all radio in audience popular-
ity for information focused on national and 
world events.
Radio Theater
Poet Stephen Vincent Benet called radio the 
“theater of the mind.” His description was 
coined during the medium’s heyday in the 
1930s and 1940s when a myriad of original 
prose  and verse plays were being produced 
and aired by the ­networks. The foremost 
radiowright of the time was Norman Corwin, 
whose works soared to ­literary heights and 
were tuned into and admired by millions. He 
was joined by many writers whose efforts were 
FIGURE 3.9

I think the Public radio stations and 
networks will have to work together to 
figure out how they can best play a 
more meaningful and relevant role in 
the lives of listeners, given that stations, 
in particular, will find it more difficult 
to compete as new media continue to 
advance. Broadcast radio has long 
enjoyed an edge because it has few 
rivals in the car, to name one space for 
listening. But the advent of widespread 
broadband Internet will shatter that 
advantage, as listeners tune in radio 
stations and other audio sources from 
around the world. And Public radio in 
particular has historically claimed the 
franchise for thoughtful, in-depth radio 
news, but that, too, will fall away as 
competitors use the Internet to reach 
listeners and other media sources con-
tinue to fragment the market.
Public radio can no longer depend 
on the technology of radio to serve as 
its salvation. Instead, stations and net-
works will have to assess and reassess 
what exactly it is that they are able to 
provide that no one else can, given 
the talent in the system and their geo-
graphic reach and presence. And sta-
tions will have to learn how to survive 
without depending on their (until now) 
unchallenged claim on carrying NPR 
programming. Listeners will continue to 
bypass stations to access content from 
national networks. So how can stations 
serve local communities using their own 
resources in ways that make a differ-
ence and attract listener, corporate, 
and foundation support?
I think there’s a lot of opportunity, 
but the system is poorly positioned 
to take advantage of it. Turf battles 
stand in the way of cooperation, and 
stations are too dependent on NPR. 
Fundraising from listeners isn’t sophis-
ticated enough to bring in the money 
needed to innovate on a broader level. 
Fortunately, the tools are out there as 
Web 2.0 continues to evolve. But the 
system needs some real visionaries and 
a new desire to work together to get 
things going.
traditionally geared to the print media. These 
writers saw in the audio medium a chance to 
reach larger audiences with their works, and 
so they generated a significant amount of orig-
inal material for it. Among the most famous 
print authors to ply their craft to the ethereal 
page were W.H. Auden, Arthur Miller, Pearl 
S. Buck, Archibald MacLeish, Irwin Shaw, 
and Edna St. Vincent Millay. The medium 
itself engendered other great writers besides 
Corwin. A close rival was Arch Oboler, whose 
popular thrillers brought chills and thrills 
to the listening audience. Perhaps the most 
famous of all radio dramas was Orson Welles’s 
adaptation of H.G. Wells’s War of the Worlds. 
It was so brilliantly evocative in its perfor-
mances, writing, and production values that it 
quite literally sent its audience into a panic.
Following the arrival of television, radio 
dramas all but vanished from the airwaves. 
The networks were gone, and local stations 
90	
CHAPTER 3 Programming

could ill-afford their manufacture. Over the 
decades since, attempts have been made to 
revive the art form (CBS and Mutual radio 
networks offered short-lived series), but the 
radio drama was and continues to be of 
only passing interest to an audience with a 
rapidly diminishing attention span and visual 
orientation. In recent years, Public radio has 
become engaged in Radio Theater, and it 
is there that the medium’s greatest artistic 
rendering makes occasional appearances.
Fortunately, dozens of Web sites on the 
Internet now preserve these valuable pieces 
of radio art and Americana. A search for 
“radio dramas” will result in a listing of 
everything from pop favorite “The Lone 
Ranger” to Corwin’s historic “On a Note of 
Triumph.”
The Programmer
PDs are radiophiles. They live the medium. 
Most admit to having been smitten by radio 
at an early age. “It’s something that is in your 
blood and grows to consuming proportions,” 
admits programmer Peter Falconi. Longtime 
PD Brian Mitchell recalls an interest in the 
medium as a small child and for good reason. 
“I was born into a broadcasting family. My 
father is a station owner and builder. During 
my childhood, radio was the primary topic 
at the dinner table. It fed the flame that I 
believe was already ignited anyway. Radio 
fascinated me from the start.”
The customary route to the program-
mer’s job involves deejaying and participa-
tion in other on-air-related areas, such as 
copywriting, production, music, and news. 
It would be difficult to state exactly how 
long it takes to become a PD. It largely 
depends on the individual and where he 
or she happens to be. In some instances, 
newcomers have gone into programming 
within their first year in the business. When 
this happens, it is most likely to occur in a 
small market where turnover may be high. 
On the other hand, it is far more common 
to spend years working toward this goal, 
even in the best of situations. “Although my 
father owned the station, I spent a long time 
in a series of jobs before my appointment 
to programmer. Along the way, I worked as 
station janitor, and then got into announc-
ing, production, and eventually program-
ming,” recounts Mitchell.
One of the nation’s foremost air per-
sonalities and hall of famer, Dick Fatherly, 
whom Billboard Magazine has described as 
a “longtime legend,” spent years as a deejay 
before making the transition. “In the 25 
years that I’ve been in this business, I have 
worked as a jock, newsman, production 
director, and even sales rep. Eventually I 
ended up in program management. During 
my career I have worked at WABC, WICC, 
WFUN, WHB, to mention a few. Plenty 
of ­experience, you might say,” comments 
Fatherly.
Experience contributes most toward the 
making of the station’s programmer. However, 
individuals entering the field with hopes of 
becoming a PD do well to acquire as much 
formal training as possible. The programmer’s 
job has become an increasingly demanding 
one as a result of expanding competition. 
“A good knowledge of research methodology, 
analysis, and application is crucial. Program-
ming is both an art and a science today,” 
observes general manager Jim Murphy. Pro-
grammer Andy Bloom concurs with Murphy, 
adding, “A would-be PD needs to school him- 
or herself in marketing research particularly. 
Little is done anymore that is not based on 
careful analysis.”
Publisher B. Eric Rhoads echoes this 
stance. “The role has changed. The PD used 
to be a glorified music director with some 
background in talent development. Today 
the PD must be a marketing expert. Radio 
marketing has become very complex, what 
with telemarketing, database marketing,

direct mail, interactive communication (fax, 
computer bulletin boards), and so forth. 
Radio is changing, and the PD must adapt. 
No longer will records and deejays make 
the big difference. Stations are at parity in 
music, so better ways must be found to set 
stations apart.”
Says Shane, “The ultimate analogy for the 
PD is ‘brand manager,’ overseeing not only 
the product, but also the image and per-
ception of the product. Since programmers 
now must work hand in hand with sellers 
to maximize station revenues, there’s a new 
awareness of the marketing dimension.”

CHAPTER 3 Programming

Cognizant of this change, schools with 
programs in radio broadcasting have begun 
to emphasize courses in audience and 
mar­keting  research, as well as other 
­programming-related areas. An important 
fact for the aspiring PD to keep in mind 
is that more people entering broadcasting 
today have college backgrounds than ever 
before. Even though a college degree is not 
necessarily a prerequisite for the position 
of PD, it is clearly regarded as an asset by 
upper management. “It used to be that a 
college degree didn’t mean so much. A PD 
came up through the ranks of programming, 
proved his ability, and was hired. Not that 
that doesn’t still happen. It does. But more 
and more the new PD has a degree or, at 
the very least, several years of college,” con-
tends Joe Cortese, syndicated air personal-
ity. “I majored in Communication Arts at 
a junior college and then transferred to a 
four-year school. There are many colleges 
offering communications courses here in 
the Boston area, so I’ll probably take some 
more as a way of further preparing for the 
day when I’ll be programming or managing 
a station. That’s what I eventually want to 
do,” says Cortese, adding that experience in 
the trenches is also vital to success.
His point is well taken. Work experi-
ence does head the list on which a station 
manager bases his or her selection for PD. 
Meanwhile, college training, at the very 
least, has become a criterion to the extent 
that if an applicant does not have any, the 
prospective employer takes notice.
Beyond formal training and experi-
ence, Chuck Ducoty, major-market station 
manager, says a PD must possess certain 
innate qualities. “Common sense and a good 
sense of humor are necessary attributes and 
are in rather short supply, I think.” Dick 
Fatherly adds sensitivity, patience, compas-
sion, and drive to the list.
The PD’s Duties and 
Responsibilities
Where to begin this discussion poses no 
simple problem because the PD’s respon-
sibilities and duties are so numerous and 
wide-ranging. Second in responsibility to 
the general manager, the PD (in station 
clusters, the individual station programmer 
reports to the director of operations, who 
oversees all programming for the various 
stations) is the person responsible for every-
thing that goes over the air. This involves 
working with the station manager or direc-
tor of operations in establishing program-
ming and format policy and overseeing their 
effective execution. In addition, he or she 
hires and supervises on-air music and pro-
duction personnel, plans various schedules, 
handles the programming budget, devel-
ops promotions, monitors the station and 
its competition, assesses research, and may 
even pull a daily air-shift. The PD also is 
accountable for the presentation of news, 
public affairs, and sports features, although 
a news director often is appointed to help 
oversee these areas.
The PD alone does not determine a sta-
tion’s format. This is an upper manage-
ment decision. The PD may be involved in 
the selection process, but, more often than 
not, the format has been chosen before the 
programmer has been hired. For example, 
WYYY decides it must switch from MOR 
to CHR to attract a more marketable demo-
graphic. After an in-depth examination of 
its own market, research on the effective-
ness of CHR nationally, and advice from 
a program consultant and rep company, 
the format change is deemed appropriate. 
Reluctantly, the station manager concludes 
that he must bring in a CHR specialist, 
which means that he must terminate the 
services of his present programmer, whose 
experience is limited to MOR. The station 
manager places an ad in an industry trade 
magazine, interviews several candidates, 
and hires the person he feels will take the 
station to the top of the ratings. When the 
new PD arrives, he or she is charged with 
the task of preparing the CHR format for its 
debut. Among other things, this may involve 
hiring new air people, the acquisition of a 
new music library or the updating of the 
existing one, preparing promos and purchas-
ing jingles, and working in league with the 
sales, traffic, and engineering departments 
for maximum results.
On these points, Corinne Baldasano, vice 
president of SW programming, observes, 
“First of all, of course, you must be sure 
The PD’s Duties and Responsibilities	
93

that the station you are programming fills a 
market void, i.e., that there is an opportu-
nity for you to succeed in your geographic 
area with the format you are programming. 
For example, a young adult alternative Rock 
station may not have much chance for 
success in an area that is mostly populated 
by retirees. Once you have determined that 
the format fills an audience need, you need 
to focus on building your station. The basic 
ingredients are making sure your music 
mix is correct (if you are programming a 
music station) and that you’ve hired the 
on-air talent that conveys the attitude and 
image of the station you wish to build. At 
this stage, it is far more important to focus 
inward than outward. Many stations have 
failed because they’ve paid more attention 
to the competition’s product than they have 
their own.”
Once the format is implemented, the PD 
must work at refining and maintaining the 
sound. After a short time, the programmer 
may feel compelled to modify air sched-
ules either by shifting deejays around or 
by replacing those who do not enhance the 
format. Metro Networks president David 
Saperstein says, “You’ve got to continually 
fine-tune the station’s sound. You must 
remove any and all negatives, like exces-
sive talk, annoying commercials, technical 
weaknesses, and so forth. The most criti-
cal rule of thumb is that stations should 
always concentrate on bringing listeners to 
the station, keeping them tuned in, and pro-
viding the right balance of music, personali-
ties, talk, information, and commercials so 
listeners do not have any reason to tune 
elsewhere.”
The PD prepares weekend and holiday 
schedules as well, and this generally requires 
the hiring of part-time announcers. A station 
may employ as few as one or two part-timers 
or fill-in people or as many as eight to ten. 
This largely depends on whether deejays are 
on a 5- or 6-day schedule. At most stations, 
air people are hired to work a 6-day week. 
The objective of scheduling is not merely to 
fill slots but to maintain continuity and con-
sistency of sound. A PD prefers to tamper 
with shifts as little as possible and fervently 
hopes that he has filled weekend slots  
with people who are reliable. “The impor-
tance of dependable, trustworthy air people 
cannot be overemphasized. It’s great to have 
talented deejays, but if they don’t show up 
when they are supposed to because of one 
reason or another, they don’t do you a lot 
of good. You need people who are coop-
erative. I have no patience with individuals 
who try to deceive me or fail to live up to 
their responsibilities,” says Brian Mitchell. A 
station that is constantly introducing new 
air personnel has a difficult time establish-
ing listener habit. The PD knows that to 
succeed he or she must present a stable and 
dependable sound, and this is a significant 
programming challenge.
Production schedules also are prepared 
by the programmer. Deejays are usually 
tapped for production duties before or 
after their airshifts. For example, the 
morning person who is on the air from 
6:00–10:00  a.m. may be assigned produc-
tion and copy chores from 10:00 a.m. until 
noon. Meanwhile, the midday deejay who 
is on the air from 10:00  a.m. until 3:00 
p.m. is given production assignments from 
3:00–5:00 p.m., and so on. Large radio sta-
tions frequently employ a full-time produc-
tion person. If so, this individual handles 
all production responsibilities and is super-
vised by the PD.
A PD traditionally handles the depart-
ment’s budget, which generally constitutes 
30–40% of the station’s operating budget. 
Working with the station manager, the 
PD ascertains the financial needs of the 
programming area. The size and scope of 
the budget vary from station to station. 
Most programming budgets include funds 
for the acquisition of program materials, 
such as albums, features, and contest para-
phernalia. A separate promotional budget 
usually exists, and it too may be managed 
by the PD. The programmer’s budgetary 
responsibilities range from monumental at 
some outlets to minuscule at others. Per-
sonnel salaries and even equipment pur-
chases may fall within the province of the 
program department’s budget. Brian Mitch-
ell believes that “an understanding of the 
total financial structure of the company or 
corporation and how programming fits into 
the scheme of things is a real asset to a 
programmer.”
Devising station promotions and contests 
also places demands on the PD’s time. Large

rather than contrast with each other, pop 
stations tend to reflect one another. This, 
in fact, has been the basis of arguments by 
critics who object to the so-called mirroring 
effect. What happens is easily understood. 
If a station does well by presenting a par-
ticular format, other stations are going to 
exploit the sound in the hopes of doing 
well also. WYYY promotes commercial-free 
sweeps of music and captures big ratings, 
and soon its competitor programs likewise. 
“Program directors use what has proven to 
be effective. It is more a matter of survival 
than anything. I think most of us try to be 
original to the degree that we can be, but 
there is very little new under the sun. Pro-
gramming moves cyclically. Today we’re all 
doing this. Tomorrow we’ll all be doing that. 
The medium reacts to trends or fads. It’s 
the nature of the beast,” notes programmer 
Mitchell. Keeping in step with, or rather one 
step ahead of, the competition requires that 
the PD knows what is happening around 
him or her at all times.
stations often appoint a promotion director. 
When this is the case, the PD and promo-
tion director work together in the ­planning, 
development, and execution of the promo-
tional campaign. The PD, however, retains 
final veto power should he or she feel that 
the promotion or contest fails to comple-
ment the station’s format. When the PD 
alone handles promotions and contests, he 
or she may involve other members of the 
programming or sales department in brain-
storming sessions designed to come up with 
original and interesting concepts. The pro-
grammer is aware that the right ­promotion 
or contest can have a major impact on 
ratings. Thus, he or she is constantly on the 
lookout for an appropriate vehicle. In the 
quest to find the promotion that will launch 
the station on the path to a larger audience, 
the PD may seek assistance from one of 
dozens of companies that offer promotional 
services.
The PD’s major objective is to program 
for results. If the station’s programming fails 
to attract a sufficient following, the ratings 
will reflect that unhappy fact. All medium 
and larger markets are surveyed by ratings 
companies, primarily Arbitron. Very few 
small rural markets, with perhaps one or 
two stations, are surveyed. If a small-market 
station is poorly programmed, the results 
will be apparent in the negative reactions 
of the local retailers. Simply put, the station 
will not be bought by enough advertisers to 
make the operation a profitable venture. In 
the bigger markets, where several stations 
compete for advertising dollars, the ratings 
are used to determine which is the most 
effective or cost-efficient station to buy. “In 
order to make it to the top of the ratings 
in your particular market, you have to be 
doing the best job around. It’s the PD who 
is going to get the station the numbers it 
needs to make a buck. If he doesn’t turn the 
trick, he’s back in the job market,” observes 
Dick Fatherly.
PDs constantly monitor the competition 
by analyzing the ratings and by listening. 
A radio station’s programming is often con-
structed in reaction to a direct competi-
tor’s. For example, Rock stations in the same 
market often counterprogram newscasts 
by airing them at different times to grab 
up their competitor’s tune-outs. However,

The PD’s Duties and Responsibilities	
95

Probably 60% of the nation’s PDs pull an 
airshift (go on the air themselves) on either 
a full-time or part-time basis. A difference 
of opinion exists among programmers con-
cerning their on-air participation. Many feel 
that being on the air gives them a true sense 
of the station’s sound, which aids them in 
their programming efforts. Others contend 
that the 3 or 4 hours that they spend on 
the air take them away from important pro-
gramming duties. Major-market PDs are less 
likely to be heard on the air than their peers 
in smaller markets because of additional 
duties created by the size and status of the 
station. Meanwhile, small- and medium-
market stations often expect their PDs to 
be seasoned air people capable of filling a 
key shift. “It has been my experience when 
applying for programming jobs that man-
agers are looking for PDs with excellent 
announcing skills. It is pretty rare to find a 
small-market PD who does not have a daily 
airshift. It comes with the territory,” says 
consultant Gary Begin.
Whether or not PDs are involved in 
actual airshifts, almost all participate in the 
production of commercials, public service 
announcements (PSA), and promos. In lieu 
of an airshift, a PD may spend several hours 
each day in the station’s production facili-
ties. The programmer may, in fact, serve as 
the primary copywriter and spot producer. 
This is especially true at nonmajor-market 
outlets that do not employ a full-time 
­production person.
The PD must possess an imposing list of 
skills to perform effectively the countless 
tasks confronting him or her daily. There 
is no one person, other than the general 
manager, whose responsibilities outweigh 
the programmer’s. The PD can either make 
or break the radio station. Summing things 
up, chief programmer Jimmy Steal states, 
“A programmer must possess balance and 
understanding of both the science and art 
of show business. A station needs someone 
who understands that strategies and tactics 
are for the conference room, and fun, 
engagement, buzz, innovation, and exceed-
ing listener’s expectations are for over the air 
and on-line. At Emmis we look for someone 
who understands the job description and all 
of the job’s duties. It is incumbent upon us 
to give a detailed definition of what success 
looks like to a prospective programmer, so 
an inspirational leader can positively moti-
vate their team of talent.”
Programming a Cluster 
Operation
The widespread consolidation of the radio 
industry since the late 1990s has resulted 
in a paradigm shift in programming respon-
sibilities. Radio clusters may consist of as 
many as eight stations. In this situation, one 
individual is usually assigned to perform the 
function of general supervisor of all cluster

doxically, many quality radio pros making 
top dollars were cut out in the downsiz-
ing and consolidation frenzy. This often left 
lesser talent in markets with clusters. Worse 
yet with many passionate, quality pros out 
of work, no one has been minding the store 
and developing new talent. This has become 
today’s major challenge – finding and devel-
oping new talent. There used to be a line 
out the door of people wanting to be on the 
radio, but the perception that consolidation 
and ­downsizing have killed the job market 
has dramatically changed that.”
Satellite Radio Programming 
Department
What follows is a brief sketch of the 
­programming department’s organizational 
structure of satellite radio, according to XM 
Satellite’s one-time chief creative officer, 
Lee Abrams: “Here’s how we set up the 
programming area. I was the head overseer 
of programming. For original content, we 
had a senior vice president of music. We 
­programming, and each of the stations 
within the cluster has a designated PD, who 
reports to this person – typically referred 
to as the director of operations. Radio cor-
porations see it as a macrocosm/microcosm 
overseer design and arrangement.
As might be imagined, the challenges of 
programming a cluster are compounded by 
the very number of the stations involved. 
As KIMN PD Gregg Cassidy observes, “Pro-
gramming a single station is very simple 
versus programming a cluster. In program-
ming a single station you have all the time 
necessary to evaluate all areas of your station 
daily. You can check your air talent each 
week, reevaluate your music and music 
rotations and be very creative with your 
on-air promotions and take the necessary 
time to create clever and compelling pro-
duction. Programming a cluster is like being 
a father of many children rather than one 
or two. Time becomes very valuable. In the 
simplest form, I would devote all my energy 
to one station per week.”
According to WIZN/WBTZ’s Matt Grasso, 
consolidation has created other ­problems 
for programmers: “Ironically, if not para-

had a vice president of Talk, who handled 
the ­day-to-day operations of the nonmusic 
channels. Original Talk programming, such 
as Take 5 and XM Traffic, had a PD along 
with a staff of talent and producers. The 
vice president of Talk also spearheaded the 
relations with third party providers. Every 
cluster had a senior PD, and each channel 
had a PD. Channels often had music direc-
tors and deejays. A vice president also 
oversaw the pure operational aspects, like 
computer systems and production. There 
was a staff of senior production directors 
who supervised a group of producers, aka 
audio animators. Supporting the anima-
tors were production assistants, who often 
came from the internship ranks at XM. 
The programming department also had a 
music librarian and staff that oversaw the 
­ingestion of music into the system. Keep in 
mind things changed as they were tweaked 
to enhance the efficiency of the depart-
ment. As they say, it was a work in progress” 
(see Figure 2.7).
Elements of Programming
Few programmers entrust the selection and 
scheduling of music and other sound ele-
ments to deejays and announcers. There is 
too much at stake and too many variables, 
both internal and external, that must be 
considered to achieve maximum results 
within a chosen format.
It has become a very complex undertak-
ing, observes Andy Bloom. “For instance, 
all of our music is tested via callout. At 
least one or two perceptual studies are done 
every year, depending on what questions 
we need answered. Usually a couple of sets 
of focus groups per year, too. Everything is 
researched, and nothing is left to chance.”  
In most cases, the PD determines how 
much music is programmed hourly and in 
what rotation and when news, public affairs  
features, and commercials are slotted. 
Program wheels, also variously known as 
sound hours, hot clocks, and format disks, 
are carefully designed by the PD to ensure 
the effective presentation of on-air ingre-
dients. Program wheels are posted in the 
control studio to inform and guide air 
people as to what is to be broadcast and 
at what point in the hour. Although not 
every station provides deejays with such 
specific programming schemata, today very 
few stations leave things up to chance since 
the inappropriate scheduling and sequenc-
ing of sound elements may drive listeners 
to a competitor. Radio programming has 
become that much of an exacting science. 
With few exceptions, stations use some kind 
of formula in conveying their programming 
material.
At one time, Top 40 stations were the 
unrivaled leaders of formula programming. 
Today, however, even FS and Classic Rock 
outlets, which once were the least formu-
laic, have become more sensitive to form. 
The age of freeform commercial radio has 
long since passed, and it is doubtful, given 
the state of the marketplace, that it will 
return. Of course, stranger things have  
happened in radio. Depending on the extent 
to which a PD prescribes the content of a 
sound hour, programming clocks may be 
elaborate in their detail or quite rudimen-
tary. Music clocks are used to plot out ele-
ments. Clocks reflect the minutes of the 
standard hour, and the PD places elements 
where they actually are to occur during 
the hour. Many programmers use a set of 
clocks, or clocks that change with each hour  
(see Figure 3.15).
“When I speak at college classes,” Ed 
Shane observes, “there’s always a question 
about why format clock hours are struc-
tured the way they are, so let me call what 
follows ‘Clock Construction 101.’ Arbitron 
entries  show that the first quarter hour 
(00:00–00:15) gets the largest number 
of new entries, that is, when the radio is 
turned on for the first time or switched to a 
new station. The third quarter hour (00:00–
30:45) gets the second largest number. The 
second quarter hour (00:00–15:30) gets the 
third largest number, and the fourth quarter 
hour (00:00–45:00) gets the fewest new 
tune-ins. That pattern is why many stations 
load their commercial content in the final 
or fourth quarter hour – trying to prevent a 
new listener from hearing a commercial as 
the first thing when tuning. Since the first 
quarter hour is so valuable in terms of new 
tune-ins, the most valuable programming 
elements should be placed in that segment.

CHAPTER 3 Programming

on – is strategically located in the sound 
hour to enhance flow and optimize impact. 
Balance is imperative: too much deejay 
patter on a station promoting more music 
and less talk, listeners become disenchanted; 
too little news and information on a station 
targeting the over-30 male commuter, the 
competition benefits. “When constructing 
or arranging the program clock, you have 
to work forward and backward to make 
sure that everything fits and is positioned 
correctly. One element out of place can 
become that proverbial hole in the dam. 
Spots, jock breaks, music – it all must be 
weighed before clocking. A lot of experi-
mentation, not to mention research, goes 
into this,” observes radio executive Lorna 
Ozman.
It was previously pointed out that a 
station with a more-music slant limits 
announcer discourse to schedule addi-
tional tunes. Some formats, in particular 
Easy ­Listening/Smooth Jazz, have reduced 
the role of the announcer to not much 
more than occasional live promos and IDs, 
which are written on liner or flip cards. 
Nothing is left to chance. This also is true 
of stations airing the super-tight hit music 
A music station is advised to load the first 
quarter hour with Power Current or Power 
Gold songs, songs that test the best or are 
the biggest hits.”
Indeed, program clocks are set up with the 
competition and market factors in mind. For 
example, programmers will devise a clock 
that reflects morning and afternoon drive 
periods in their market. Not all markets 
have identical commuter hours. In some 
cities morning drive may start as early as  
5:30 a.m.; in others it may begin at 7:00 a.m.  
The programmer sets up clocks accordingly. 
A clock parallels the activities of the com-
munity in which the station operates.
Music stations are not the only ones that 
use program wheels; News and Talk sta-
tions do so as well. News stations, like music 
outlets, use key format elements to maintain 
ratings through the hour. Many News sta-
tions work their clocks in 20-minute cycles. 
During this segment, news is arranged 
according to its degree of importance and 
geographic relevance, such as local, regional, 
national, and international. Most News sta-
tions lead with their top local stories. News 
stories of particular interest are repeated 
during the segment. Sports, weather, and 
other news-related information, such as 
traffic and stock market reports, constitute 
a part of the segment. Elements may be 
juggled around or different ones inserted 
during successive 20-minute blocks to keep 
things from sounding repetitious.
In the Talk format, two-way conversation 
and interviews fill the space generally allot-
ted to songs in the music format. Therefore, 
Talk wheels often resemble music wheels 
in their structure. For example, news is 
offered at the top of the hour, followed by 
a talk sweep that precedes a spot set. This 
is done in a fashion that is reminiscent of 
Easy Listening.
Of course, not all stations arrange their 
sound hours as depicted in these pages. 
Many variations exist, most inspired and 
driven by computers, but these examples 
are fairly representative of some of the 
program schematics used in today’s radio 
marketplace.
Program wheels keep a station on a 
preordained path and prevent wandering.

and then they’re just the metal holding the 
precious stones in place for another period 
of time. What went on in the mid-1970s 
with personality began to recur in the latter 
part of the 1980s. Of course, there are a few 
new twists in the tiara, but what it comes 
down to is the temporary restoration of the 
hit radio personality. It’s a back and forth 
movement, kind of like a tide. It comes in, 
then retreats, but each time something new 
washes up. Deejays screamed at the teens 
in the 1950s, mellowed out some in the 
1960s and 1970s, went hyper again in the 
1980s, and conservatism regained favor in 
the 1990s,” observes Brian ­Mitchell. In the 
first decade of the 2000s, with the pressure 
from so many competing audio options, 
high foreground personalities are beginning 
to look attractive once again as an antidote 
to the music-intensive services.
On the subject of on-air talent, Lynn 
Christian observes, “Requirements have 
changed in the past few years. Stations 
are not just looking for a ‘pretty voice.’ 
Today’s radio management looks for talent 
with facile minds who are great observers – 
people who can listen as well as speak, plus 
possess the ability to ­demonstrate a warm 
format. Deejays say what is written and 
move the music. At stations where deejays 
are given more control, wheels play a less 
crucial function. Outlets where a particular 
personality has ruled the ratings for years 
often let that person have more input as 
to what music is aired. However, even in 
these cases, playlists generally are provided 
and followed.
The radio personality has enjoyed varying 
degrees of popularity since the 1950s. Over 
the years, Top 40, more than any other 
format, has toyed with the extent of deejay 
involvement on the air. The pendulum has 
swung from heavy personality presence in 
the 1950s and early 1960s to a drastically 
reduced role in the mid- and later 1960s. 
This dramatic shift came as the result of 
programmer Bill Drake’s attempt to stream-
line Top 40. In the 1970s, the air personality 
regained some of his or her status, but in the 
1980s, the narrowing of hit station playlists 
brought about a new leanness and ­austerity 
that again diminished the jock’s presence. 
In the mid-1980s, some pop music sta-
tions began to give the deejay more to do. 
“There’s sort of a pattern to it all. For a 
while, deejays are the gems in the crown,

Station Web Sites, Podcasts, 
and Blogs
In this day and age, nearly every radio station 
maintains a Web site. Most do so as an addi-
tional marketing tool, but many provide lis-
teners with Web sites as a cyber-extension of 
their on-air signals, since so many people sit 
in front of their computers at work and at 
home for countless hours. Indeed, a station 
Web site is not only for listening, but it’s 
a visual component of a radio station, a 
means of giving more sight to a once sight-
less medium. Says Ressen Design’s Darryl 
Pomicter, “Web sites compliment all terres-
trial broadcast systems, supplementing and 
expanding content. They give stations reach 
they never had before – locally, nationally, 
and globally.”
Station Web sites hold great value for 
PDs for three vastly different reasons, 
­contends Matt Grasso, WIZN.WBTZ opera-
tions manager. “First off, Pl’s [dedicated lis-
teners] spend a lot of time with your radio 
station, and the Web site is a way to keep 
things fresh and exciting for them. Games, 
exclusive Web-only promotions, staff blogs 
and bios all provide an exclusive, behind 
the scenes look at the product. Next, Time 
Spent ­Listening (TSL) drives the ratings bus 
and your online broadcast boosts it. There 
are a lot of people who are procrastinat-
ing at work. Plug them into your station. 
Give them lifestyle news and information 
and watch your TSL rise. And finally, the 
Web site constitutes new inventory. You 
can clutter your airwaves with so much 
stuff. Your Web site is a new place to do 
business.”
Station Web sites (cyberspace display 
windows, if you will) literally come in all 
sizes, and shapes. That is to say, they can be 
simple offering a limited number of links, and 
they can be highly interactive and multit-
iered with dozens of links. Not all Web sites 
are constructed as income streams, but more 
and more radio stations are viewing Web 
sites as another good source of nontraditional 
revenue. Recently, stations have begun adding 
the iTunes Music Store link to their sites to 
allow their listeners to purchase the tunes 
they air. Emmis was the first station group to 
do so on its ­stations in Chicago, Indianapolis, 
Austin, and St. Louis.
and always interesting personality.” On the 
other side of the coin, talent wants their 
managers to operate in a manner that makes 
for a positive atmosphere and experience, 
says Jimmy Steal. “The keys to managing 
talent are (1) Honesty, (2) Inspiration, (3) 
Creativity, and (4) Empathy.”
In addition to concentrating on the role 
deejays play in the sound hour, the PD 
pays careful attention to the general nature 
and quality of other ingredients. Music is, 
of course, of paramount importance. Songs 
must fit the format to begin with, but 
beyond the obvious, the quality of the art-
istry and the audio mix must meet certain 
criteria. A substandard musical arrangement 
or a disc with poor fidelity detracts from the 
station’s sound. Jingles and promos must 
effectively establish the tone and tenor of 
the format, or they have the reverse effect 
of their intended purpose, which is to attract 
and hold listeners. Commercials, too, must 
be compatible with the program elements 
that surround them.
In all, the PD scrutinizes every compo-
nent of the program wheel to keep the 
station true to form. The wheel helps main-
tain consistency, without which a station 
cannot hope to cultivate a following. Erratic 
programming in today’s highly competitive 
marketplace is tantamount to directing lis-
teners to other stations.

the most popular.

service, too.” Matt Grasso adds, “Podcasts are 
useful to station programming because it’s 
a way to take the station with you. At first 
radio programmers were afraid of iPods; now 
they realize that they are just another way 
to get even closer to the listener.”
A blog is a Web page of entries from a 
single source/author pertaining to a particu-
lar subject or topic. Many station person-
alities and talk show hosts maintain blogs, 
which are sometimes referred to as online 
journals or diaries. Observes Insalaco, “Blog-
ging has become a national phenomenon. 
Talk show host blogs are a popular com-
ponent of a station’s Web site. Consumers 
are processing news at a meteoric pace via 
the Web, cell phones, and Blackberries, so 
station blogs fit into this scheme. While 
Americans are no longer at the mercy of the 
network news broadcasts or the newspaper 
for daily information, the trend of process-
ing news through opinion (whether a good 
thing or a bad thing) has developed. Radio 
hosts can blog about issues related to the 
topics discussed and the guests they have on 
their programs. Blogs can billboard upcom-
ing topics and provide listeners an oppor-
tunity to interact. Also, show blogs provide 
additional information and links to stories 
discussed on the air. Radio station blogs can 
feature show rundowns of the day’s topics 
Larger stations and cluster operations typ-
ically hire an individual (frequently called 
manager of information services – MIS) to 
maintain a station’s Web presence. It falls 
to this person to maintain the appearance 
and relevance of the Web site. The growing 
role of station Web sites has made it another 
potential career option for those interested 
in entering the radio field. Clearly, computer 
skills would rank high on the list of attri-
butes an applicant for this position should 
possess. In addition, an overall knowledge of 
radio programming and marketing would be 
of special value.
Although 
podcasts 
were 
originally 
designed  for downloading to iPods and 
MP3s,  radio stations have found them to 
be a value-added programming feature. 
Thousands of podcasts are available on the 
Internet, and most radio stations now offer 
podcasts of their on-air features on their Web 
sites. Some stations have created exclusive, 
podcast-only programs. Says consultant Jason 
Insalaco, “Podcasting ‘exclusives’ can drive 
Web traffic and increase the time listeners 
spend on the Web site. For example, Web 
site exclusive interviews with newsmakers, 
musical artists, entire unedited press confer-
ences, or even the local high school football 
game can provide supplemental content 
for station podcasts. It’s a good community 
Ed Shane
Programming in a New Age
Radio needs to think of itself in 
a new way. We are content crea-
tors, content developers, and content 
­providers. Transmission and distribution 
are ­irrelevant. That’s why Internet-only 
radio stations show so much promise. 
­Traditional radio is a one-way medium. 
For much of its reign, it seemed 
­interactive when it engaged the imagi-
nation or stimulated phone calls for talk 
show feedback or contesting. The new 
“radio” will use a variety of means to 
distribute content to its constituents.
A radio station client of mine 
recently began streaming its audio via 
the Internet. The PD was very excited, 
because he anticipated hearing from 
new listeners all over the world who 
could discover how good his station 
sounded. The president of the company 
who owned the station took him to 
the window and pointed to a house 
in the neighborhood nearby. “We’re 
not streaming to be heard around 
the world,” he told his PD. “We’re 
­streaming so the 12-year-old girl in 
that house will listen to our station. 
She doesn’t listen to radio, but if she 
likes what you do, she’ll listen on her 
­computer.”

look good to prospective advertisers. The 
purpose of any format is to win a desirable 
segment of the radio audience. Just who 
these people are and what makes them tick 
are questions that the PD must constantly 
address to achieve reach and retention. An 
informed programmer is aware that differ-
ent types of music appeal to different types 
of people. For example, surveys have long 
concluded that heavy rock appeals more to 
men than it does to women, and that rock 
music, in general, is more popular among 
teens and young adults than it is with indi-
viduals over 40. This is no guarded secret, 
and certainly the programmer who is out to 
gain the over-40 crowd is doing himself or 
herself and his or her station a disservice by 
programming even an occasional hard rock 
tune. This should be obvious.
A station’s demographics refer to the 
characteristics of those who tune in: sex, 
age, income, and so forth. Within its demo-
graphics, a station may exhibit particular 
strength in specific areas or cells as they have 
come to be termed. For example, an AC 
station targeting the 24–39-year-old group 
may have a prominent cell in women over 
30. The general information provided by 
the major ratings surveys indicate to the 
station the age and sex of those listening, 
but little beyond that. To find out more, 
the PD may conduct an in-house survey or 
employ the services of a research firm.
Since radio accompanies listeners practi-
cally everywhere, broadcasters pay partic-
ular attention to the lifestyle activities of 
their target audience. A station’s geographic 
locale often dictates its program offerings. 
For example, hoping to capture the atten-
tion of the 35-year-old men, a radio outlet 
located in a small coastal city along the 
Gulf of Mexico might decide to air a series 
of 1-minute informational tips on outdoor 
activities, such as tennis, golf, and deep-sea 
fishing, which are exceptionally popular in 
the area. Stations have always catered to the 
interests of their listeners, but in the 1970s, 
audience research became much more ori-
ented to lifestyle (Figure 3.21).
In the 1990s, broadcasters delved further 
into audience behavior through psycho-
graphic research, which, by examining moti-
vational factors, provides programmers with 
information beyond the purely ­quantitative. 
The PD and the Audience
The programmer, regardless of whether he 
or she works for a broadcast, satellite, or 
Internet radio station, must possess a clear 
perception of the type of listener the station 
management wants to attract. Initially, a 
station decides on a given format because 
it is convinced that it will make money 
with the new-found audience, meaning that 
the people who tune in to the station will

­programmer with a real feel for the area 
in which the station is located, as well as 
a fundamental grasp of research methodol-
ogy and its application, is in the best pos-
sible position to direct the on-air efforts of 
a radio station. Concerning the role of audi-
ence research, Peter Falconi says, “You can’t 
run a station on research alone. Yes, research 
helps to an extent, but it can’t replace 
your own observations and instincts.” Brian 
Mitchell agrees with Falconi. “I feel research 
is important, but how you react to research 
is more important. A PD also has to heed 
his gut feelings. Gaps exist in research, too. 
If I can’t figure out what to do without 
data to point the way every time I make 
a move, I should get out of radio. Success 
comes from taking chances once in a while, 
too. Sometimes it’s wiser to turn your back 
on the tried and tested. Of course, you had 
better know who’s out there before you 
try anything. A PD who doesn’t study his 
audience and community is like a racecar 
driver who doesn’t familiarize himself with 
the track. Both can end up off the road and 
out of the race.”
The PD and the Music
Not all radio stations have a music director. 
The larger the station, the more likely it is to 
have such a person. In any case, it is the PD 
who is ultimately responsible for the music 
that goes over the air, even when the posi-
tion of music director exists. The duties 
of the music director vary from station to 
station. Although the title suggests that the 
individual performing this function would 
supervise the station’s music program-
ming from the selection and acquisition of 
records to the preparation of playlists, this 
Perhaps one of the best examples of a 
­station’s efforts to conform to its listen-
ers’ lifestyle is day-parting, a topic briefly 
touched on in the discussion of program 
wheels. For the sake of illustration, let us 
discuss how an AC station may daypart 
(segmentalize) its broadcast day. To begin 
with, the station is targeting an over-40 
audience, somewhat skewed toward men. 
The PD concludes that the station’s biggest 
listening hours are mornings between 7:00 
and 9:00 a.m. and afternoons between 4:00 
and 6:00 p.m., and that most of those tuned 
in during these periods are in their cars com-
muting to or from work. It is evident to the 
programmer that the station’s programming 
approach must be modified during drive-
time to reflect the needs of the audience. 
Obviously, traffic reports, news and sports 
updates, weather forecasts, and frequent 
time checks are suitable fare for the sta-
tion’s morning audience. The interests of 
homebound commuters contrast slightly 
with those of work-bound commuters. 
Weather and time are less important, and 
most sports information from the previous 
night is old hat by the time the listener 
heads for home. Stock market reports and 
information about upcoming games and 
activities pick up the slack. Midday hours 
call for further modification, since the life-
style of the station’s audience is different. 
Aware that the majority of those listening 
are homemakers (in a less enlightened age 
this daypart was referred to as “housewife” 
time), the PD reduces the amount of news 
and information, replacing them with music 
and deejay conversation designed specifi-
cally to complement the activities of those 
tuned. In the evening, the station redirects 
its programming and schedules sports and 
talk features, going exclusively talk after 
midnight. All these adjustments are made 
to attract and retain audience interest.
The PD relies on survey information and 
research data to better gauge and under-
stand the station’s audience. However, 
as a member of the community that the 
station serves, the programmer knows that 
not everything is contained in formal docu-
mentation. He or she gains unique insight 
into the mood and mentality of the area 
within the station’s signal simply by taking 
part in the activities of day-to-day life. A

The PD and the Music	
105

Programmer Jon Lutes designates music 
categories in the following manner: New 
Music, Medium Current, Hot Current, Hot 
Recurrent, Medium Recurrent, Bulk Recur-
rent, Power Gold, Secondary Gold, Tertiary 
Gold, and so forth. Each station approaches 
cataloging in its own fashion. Here is a 
simple example. An AC outlet receives an 
album by a popular female vocalist whose 
last name begins with an L. The PD audi-
tions the album and decides to place three 
cuts into regular on-air rotation. The music 
director then assigns the cuts the following 
catalog numbers: L106/U/F, L106/D/F, and 
L106/M/F. L106 indicates where the album 
may be located in the library. In this case, 
the library is set up alphabetically and then 
numerically within the given letter that rep-
resents the artist’s last name. In other words, 
this would be the 106th album found in the 
section reserved for female vocalists whose 
names begin with an L. The next symbol 
indicates the tempo of the cut: U(p) tempo, 
D(own) tempo, and M(edium) tempo. The 
F that follows the tempo symbol indicates 
the artist’s gender: Female.
When a station is computerized (and in 
this day and age, few are not), this informa-
tion, including the frequency or rotation of 
airplay as determined by the PD, will be 
entered accordingly.
Playlists are then assembled and printed 
by the computer. The music director sees 
that these lists are placed in the control room 
for use by the deejays. This last step is elimi-
nated when the on-air studio is equipped 
with a computer terminal. Deejays then 
simply punch up the playlists designed for 
their particular airshifts. Ed Shane offers, “To 
hone the music mix for proper balance and 
rotation, stations use music rotation software 
from a variety of suppliers. The most used 
software program is Selector from Radio 
Computing Services (which also supplies 
music test analysis software, traffic software, 
and a digital studio ­operation system). Other 
popular music rotation software is Power-
Gold and Music Master” (see Figure 3.22).
Without a doubt, the use of computers in 
music programming has become standard, 
especially in larger markets where the cost 
of computerization is absorbed more easily. 
The number of computer companies selling 
both hardware and software designed for use 
is not always the case. At some stations, the 
position is primarily administrative or cleri-
cal in nature, leaving the PD to make the 
major decisions concerning airplay. In this 
instance, one of the primary duties of the 
music director might be to improve service 
from record distributors to keep the station 
well supplied with the latest releases. A 
radio station with poor record service may 
actually be forced to purchase music. This 
can be prevented to a great extent by main-
taining close ties with the various record 
distributor reps.
Over the years the music industry and 
the radio medium have formed a mutu-
ally beneficial alliance. Without the product 
provided by the recording companies, radio 
would find itself with little in the way of 
programming material, since 90% of the 
country’s stations feature recorded music. 
At the same time, radio serves as the princi-
pal means by which the recording industry 
gets word of its new releases to the general 
public. Succinctly put, radio sells records.
Although radio stations seldom pay for 
their music (CDs) – recording companies 
send demos of their new product to most 
stations – it must pay annual licensing fees 
to American Society of Composers, Authors, 
and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music 
Incorporated (BMI), or SESAC (Society of 
European Stage Authors and Composers) 
for the privilege of airing recorded music. 
ASCAP provides a “blanket” license for 
music stations. Fees are a percentage of a 
station’s annual income, usually 1–1½% of 
gross income. According to ASCAP, non-
commercial radio stations “pay an annual fee 
determined by the U.S. Copyright Office.”
These fees range from a few hundred 
dollars at small, noncommercial, educational 
stations to tens of thousands of dollars at 
large, commercial, metro market stations. 
The music licensing fees paid by stations 
are distributed to the artists and composers 
of the songs broadcast.
When music arrives at the station, the 
music director (sometimes more appropri-
ately called the music librarian or music 
assistant) processes them through the 
system. This may take place after the PD 
has screened them. Records are catego-
rized, indexed, and eventually added to 
the library if they suit the station’s format. 
106	
CHAPTER 3 Programming

Obviously, a music director must work 
within the station’s prescribed format. If 
the PD feels that a particular song does not 
fit the station’s sound, he will direct the 
music director to remove the cut from rota-
tion. Since the PD and music director work 
closely together, this seldom occurs.
A song’s rotation usually is relative to its 
position on national and local record sales 
charts. For instance, songs that enjoy top 
ranking, say those in the Top 10, will get 
the most airplay on hit-oriented stations. 
When songs descend the charts, their rota-
tion decreases proportionately. Former chart 
toppers are then assigned another rotation 
configuration that initially may result in 
one-tenth of their former airplay, and even-
tually even less. PDs and music directors 
derive information pertaining to a record’s 
popularity from various trade journals, such 
as Billboard, Radio and Records, and Monday 
Morning Replay, as well as listener surveys, 
area record store sales, and numerous other 
by programmers has soared. Among others 
providing computerized music systems are 
Halper and Associates, Jefferson Pilot Data 
Systems, and Columbine Systems. Also, 
some journals, such as Billboard and Radio 
and Records, provide up-to-date comput-
erized music research on new singles and 
albums to assist station programmers.
In light of the extensive reliance on com-
puters, Jon Lutes and Shane Media caution 
that “Music scheduling involves more than 
punching a few buttons on your computer 
keyboard. It helps to have a basic under-
standing of how the computer actually 
operates and what the particular software 
you are using will and will not do.”
At those radio stations where the music 
director’s job is less administrative and 
more directorial, this individual will actu-
ally audition and select what songs are to be 
designated for airplay. However, the music 
director makes decisions based on criteria 
established by the station’s programmer.

On the CHR front, Shane notes that 
“There’s a major change in the way charts 
are constructed. The original Billboard Hot 
100 chart was based substantially on record 
sales. The Gavin Report and other “tipsheets” 
used reports from radio station music direc-
tors who fed information on the positions 
on their own local charts, some validated by 
record sales and requests – some not.”
“When R&R was launched in 1974, its 
charts were also compiled from reports 
from radio station programmers. R&R, 
however, mixed industry news and com-
mentary to create a niche for itself as the 
most important of the music trade publi-
cations in the eyes of the music (record) 
sources. Stations that do not program from 
the current charts compose their playlists 
of songs that were popular in years gone 
by. In addition, these stations often remix 
current hit songs to make them adaptable 
to their more conservative sound. While 
Easy Listening stations do not air popular 
rock songs, they do air softened versions 
by other artists, usually large orchestras. 
Critics of this technique accuse the pro-
ducers of lobotomizing songs to bring them 
into the fold. In nonhit formats, there are 
no “power-rotation” categories or hit posi-
tioning schemata; a song’s rotation tends to 
be more random, although program wheels 
are used.

CHAPTER 3 Programming

mid-1999 both R&R and The Gavin Report 
(now defunct) began using charts based on 
airplay detection with information ­compiled 
by MediaBase, a monitoring service owned 
by Premiere Radio Networks.”
Constructing a station playlist is the single 
most important duty of the music program-
mer. What to play, when to play it, and how 
often are some of the key questions con-
fronting this individual. The music director 
relies on a number of sources, both internal 
and external, to provide the answers but 
also must cultivate an ear for the kind of 
sound the station is after. Some people are 
blessed with an almost innate capacity to 
detect a hit, but most must develop this skill 
over a period of time.
With the advent of station Web site 
streaming, the relationship between the 
industry. Because the charts were based 
on verbal reports from local stations, the 
system was too easily manipulated by a 
station programmer who might report play 
but not actually play the song. This practice 
was known as a “paper add” because the 
record was added to the playlist only on 
paper and did not receive airplay. In 1989, 
Billboard became the first trade publica-
tion to track radio airplay as it happened 
and to count “spins,” or plays, in compiling 
charts. Billboard and its companion publica-
tion, Airplay Monitor, used Broadcast Data 
Systems (BDS) to ­electronically detect 
airplay by matching segments of songs called 
“footprints” to actual play on stations moni-
tored over the air. The practice of paper 
adds decreased because a song reported to 
R&R could be tracked in BDS detections. In

Advice to Programmers
Rule 1: Follow the listeners, not the 
format. So many people in radio 
get caught up in terms like CHR, 
New AC, Alternative, and AAA 
that they lose track of their goal: 
finding listeners.
Consumers of radio think in 
terms of “what I like” and “what I 
don’t like.” By researching your lis-
teners’ tastes and giving them what 
they want (as opposed to what fits 
FIGURE 3.24
Frank Bell.
the industry’s definition of what they 
should have), you’ll maximize your 
chances for success.
Rule 2: Think outside in, not inside out. 
The fact that one company may now 
own several stations in a market and 
is capable, for example, of skewing 
one FM toward younger females and 
the other toward older females does 
not mean that you will automatically 
“dominate females.”
The only reality that counts is that 
of the listener. If listeners feel your 
station serves a meaningful purpose 
for them, they will happily cast their 
Arbitron vote in your favor. If they 
believe you are simply duplicating 
what is already available elsewhere 
on the dial, you will be doomed to 
ratings obscurity.
Rule 3: Early to bed, early to rise, 
Advertise, Advertise, Advertise. In the 
Arbitron game of unaided recall, the 
dominant issue is Top-of-Mindness.
The best way to get that is through 
advertising your name and your 
­station’s benefits on your own air 
and on any other medium you can 
afford. Just for fun, here’s a diagram 
I sometimes use to show first-time PDs 
the various factors that influence their 
station’s ratings:
A
X
Y
B
Your Ratings



X is what your station does.
Y is what your direct competitors do. 
A represents “environmental” factors 
in the market, such as what’s on TV 
during the survey, riots, floods, earth-
quakes, and (in some cases) the OJ 
trial.
B is what the rating service does. In the 
case of Arbitron, this would include 
the response rate, editing procedures, 
and distribution of diaries by race, 
age, and sex.
The most important thing to under-
stand is that as PD, the only part of 
the equation you can control is X. Do 
the best you can to keep your station 
sounding compelling, entertaining, 
and focused on its target audience, 
and don’t get an ulcer over those 
­elements you can’t control.
The PD and the Music

and certain types of features. For example, 
profane language, obscenity, sex- and drug-
related statements, and even innuendos in 
announcements, conversations, or music 
lyrics jeopardize the station’s license. The 
FCC prohibits indecent and profane broad-
casts, and the cost for violating this rule 
can cost the station dearly. For example, in 
2006, the Commission raised the maximum 
charge for offenses in this category from 
$32,500–$325,000 per violation. Fines 
have been on a dramatic rise for infrac-
tions surrounding on-air indecency since 
the early 2000s as the result of some highly 
publicized incidents perpetrated by radio 
personalities like Bubba the Love Sponge, 
Opie & Anthony, and Howard Stern (now 
beyond the reach of these rules on satellite 
radio).
Political messages and station editorials 
are carefully scrutinized by the program-
mer. On-air contests and promotions must 
not resemble lotteries in which the audi-
ence must invest to win. A station that gets 
­something in return for awarding prizes is 
subject to punitive actions. Neither the 
deejays, PD, music director, nor anyone 
­associated with the station may receive 
payment for plugging a song or album 
on the air. This constitutes “payola” or 
“plugola” and was the cause of great indus-
try upheaval in the late 1950s. Today, PDs 
and station managers continue to be par-
ticularly careful to guard against any recur-
rence, although there have been charges 
that such practices still exist.
In fact, in the mid-2000s, the FCC began a 
formal investigation into payola allegations 
against four major radio groups: CBS Radio, 
Clear Channel, Entercom, and Citadel. It 
was the largest federal inquiry since the 
payola scandals prompted congressional 
hearings in 1960. Indeed, PDs must be vig-
ilant of this illegal practice, which seems 
impervious to eradication.
The PD must monitor both commercial 
and noncommercial messages to ensure that 
no false, misleading, or deceptive statements 
are aired, something the FCC staunchly 
opposes. This includes any distortion of the 
station’s ratings survey results. A station that 
is not number one and claims to be is lying 
to the public as far as the FCC is concerned, 
and such behavior is not condoned.
medium and the recording industry got 
more contentious in the 2000s. The record-
ing ­industry insisted on greater compensa-
tion for its licensed music when a station 
offered songs via cyberspace, while broad-
casters argued that their Web site music 
streaming was simply an extension of their 
on-air signal, which was already under a 
fee schedule. The recording industry feared 
Web site users would burn or download 
music free of charge from the station sites, 
and it anticipated this to be a major issue 
as the medium transitioned to digital. As 
of this writing, progress had been made in 
resolving this issue.
The PD and the FCC
The government is especially interested in 
the way a station conducts itself on the air. 
For instance, the PD makes certain that his 
or her station is properly identified once an 
hour, as close to the top of the hour as pos-
sible. The ID must include the station’s call 
letters and the town in which it has been 
authorized to broadcast. Failure to properly 
identify the station is a violation of FCC 
rules.
Other on-air rules that the PD must 
address have to do with program content

CHAPTER 3 Programming

The PD and Upper Management
The pressures of the PD’s position should 
be apparent by now. The station or cluster 
programmer knows well that his or her 
job entails satisfying the desires of many –  
the audience, government, air staff, and, 
of course, management. The relationship 
between the PD and the station or corpo-
ration’s upper echelon is not always serene 
or without incident. Although their alliance 
is usually mutually fulfilling and produc-
tive, difficulties can and do occur when 
­philosophies or practices clash. “Most inhib-
iting and detrimental to the PD is the GM 
who lacks a broad base of experience but 
imposes his opinions on you anyway. The 
guy who has come up through sales and has 
never spent a minute in the studio can be a 
real thorn in the side. Without a thorough 
knowledge of programming, management 
should rely on the expertise of that person 
hired who does. I don’t mean, ‘Hey, GM, 
get out of the way!’ what I’m saying is, 
don’t impose programming ideas and poli-
cies without at least conferring with that 
individual who ends up taking the heat if 
the air product fails to bring in the listeners,” 
says Dick Fatherly.
Station manager Chuck Ducoty contends 
that managers can enhance as well as inhibit 
the programmer’s style. “I’ve worked for 
some managers who give their PDs a great 
deal of space and others who attempt to 
control every aspect of programming. From 
the station manager’s perspective, I think 
the key to a good experience with those 
who work for you is to find excellent people 
from the start and then have enough confi-
dence in your judgment to let them do their 
job with minimal interference. ­Breathing 
down the neck of the PD is just going to 
create tension and resentment.”
Programmer Peter Falconi believes that 
both the PD and the manager should make 
a sincere effort to get to know and under-
stand one another. “You have to be on the 
same wavelength, and there has to be an 
License renewal programming promises 
must be addressed by the PD. The propor-
tion of nonentertainment programming, 
such as news and public affairs features, 
pledged in the station’s renewal applica-
tion must be adhered to, even though such 
requirements have been all but eliminated. 
A promise is a promise. If a station claims 
that it will do something, it must abide by 
its word.
The PD helps maintain the station’s 
Emergency Alert System (EAS), making 
certain that proper announcements are 
made on the air and that the EAS checklist 
containing an authenticator card is placed 
in the control room area. PDs also instruct 
personnel in the proper procedures used 
when conducting on-air telephone conver-
sations to guarantee that the rights of callers 
are not violated.
The station log (which ultimately is the 
chief engineer’s responsibility) and program 
log (no longer required by the FCC but 
maintained by most stations anyway) are 
examined by the PD for accuracy, and he 
or she also must see to it that operators 
have permits and that they are posted in 
the on-air studio. In addition, the station 
manager may assign the PD the responsi-
bility for maintaining the station’s Public 
File. If so, the PD must be fully aware of 
what the file is required to contain. The 
FCC and many broadcast associations will 
provide station operators with a Public File 
checklist upon request. This information is 
available in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(73.3526) as well.
Additional programming areas of inter-
est to the FCC include procedures govern-
ing rebroadcasts, simulcasts, and subcarrier 
activities. The PD also must be aware that 
the government is keenly interested in 
employment practices. The programmer, 
station manager, and other department 
heads are under obligation to familiarize 
themselves with equal employment oppor-
tunity (EEO) and affirmative action rules. 
An annual employment report must be sent 
to the FCC.
The preceding is only a partial listing of 
the concerns set forth by the government 
relative to the PD’s position. For a more 
comprehensive assessment, refer to the CFR 
appendix at the end of Chapter 2.

A winning formula.”
An adversarial situation between the sta-
tion’s PD and upper management does not 
have to exist. The station that cultivates 
an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual 
respect seldom becomes embroiled in skir-
mishes that deplete energy – energy better

manager has confidence and trust in his 
PD, he’ll generally let him run with the 
ball. It’s a two-way street. Most problems 
can be resolved when there is honesty and 
openness.”

observation: “Great upper management

3.  Country is the fastest growing format 
since the 1970s. More prevalent in the 
South and Midwest, it attracts a broad age 
group and offers a variety of subformats.
4.  Easy Listening/Smooth Jazz stations 
evolved from the Beautiful Music stations 
of the 1960s and 1970s. Featuring mostly 
instrumentals and minimal talk, many sta-
tions have become automated and use pre-
packaged programming from syndicators. 
The primary audience is over age 50. Its fol-
lowing has dwindled in recent years owing 
to myriad softer AC formats.
1.  The AC format features recent (since 
the 1970s) and current pop standards. It 
appeals to the 25–49-year age group, which 
attracts advertisers. It often utilizes music 
sweeps and clustered commercials. AC has 
spawned a variety of subgenres, including 
Adult Hits, Adult Standards, and iPod imita-
tors Jack and Mike.
2.  CHR features current, fast-selling hits from 
the Top 40. It targets teens, broadcasts minimal 
news, and is very promotion/contest oriented. 
Some CHRs have ­redirected their playlists to 
create a Modern Hit or Churban sound.

5.  Rock or AOR stations began in the 
mid-1960s to counter Top 40 stations. 
They featured music sweeps with a large 
airplay library, and they played rock 
album cuts. News was minimal. The 
format attracted a predominantly male 
audience aged 18–34. Today, these sta-
tions are usually referred to simply as 
Rock stations.
6.  All-News stations rotate time blocks 
of local, regional, and national news and 
features to avoid repetition. The format 
requires three to four times the staff and 
budget of most music operations.
7.  All-Talk combines discussion and call-in 
shows. It is primarily a medium- and 
major-market format. Like All-News, All-
Talk is mostly found on AM (and is the 
domain of conservative talkers) but is 
now finding a home on the FM band. All-
Sports has boosted the nonmusic format’s 
numbers and now is offered by several 
networks.
8.  The Nostalgia playlist emphasizes popular 
tunes from the 1940s and prerock 1950s, 
presenting its music in sweeps with a rela-
tively low deejay profile.
9.  The Oldies playlist includes hits between 
the 1950s and 1960s, relying on fine air 
personalities. Commercials are placed ran-
domly and songs are spaced to allow deejay 
patter.

One includes music as a primary part of its 
presentation, whereas the other does not.
14.  Ethnic stations serve the listening 
needs of minority groups. Black and His-
panic listeners constitute the largest ethnic 
audiences.
15.  FS stations (formerly MOR) rely on the 
strength of air personalities and features. 
Mostly an AM format, FS attempts to be 
all things to all people, attracting an over-40 
audience.
16.  Niche formats, like All-Children, Busi-
ness, and Tourist Radio, are popping up 
all over the dial as the listening audience 
becomes more diffused and interest grows 
in HD2 stations.
17.  Public and noncommercial stations typ­
ically employ a block format promot-
ing diversity rather than a single form of 
programming.
18.  PDs are hired to fit whatever format 
the station management has selected. They 
are chosen primarily for their experience, 
although education level is important.
19.  The PD is responsible for everything 
that is aired. Second in responsibility to 
the general manager (except in a cluster 
arrangement with a director of operations), 
the PD establishes programming and format 
policy; hires and supervises on-air, music, 
and production personnel; handles the pro-
gramming budget; develops promotions; 
monitors the station and its competitors and 
assesses research; is accountable for news, 
public affairs, and sports features; and may 
even pull an airshift.
20.  The PD’s effectiveness is measured 
by ratings in large markets and by sales in 
smaller markets.
21.  The PD determines the content of 
each sound hour, utilizing program clocks 
to ensure that each element – commercial, 
news, promo, weather, music, and so on – is 
strategically located to enhance flow and 
optimize impact. Even News/Talk stations 
need program clocks.
22.  PDs must adjust programming to the 
lifestyle activities of the target audience. 
They must develop a feel for the area in 
which the station is located, as well as an 
understanding of survey information and 
research data.
10.  Classic Rock concentrates on tunes 
once primarily featured by AOR stations. 
Meanwhile, Classic Hit stations fill the gap 
between Oldies and CHR outlets with play-
lists that draw from 1970s’ and 1980s’ Top 
40 charts.
11.  UC is the “melting pot” format, attract-
ing a heterogeneous audience. Its upbeat, 
danceable sound, and hip, friendly deejays 
attract the 18–34-year age group. Contests 
and promotions are important.
12.  Classical commercial outlets are few, 
but they have a loyal audience. Primarily 
an FM format appealing to a higher income, 
college-educated (upscale, 25–49 years old) 
audience, Classical features a conservative, 
straightforward air sound.
13.  Religious stations are most prevalent on 
the AM band. Religious broadcasters usually 
approach programming in one of two ways.

23.  Finally, the PD must ensure that the 
station adheres to all FCC regulations per-
taining to programming practices, anticipat-
ing problems before they occur. Indecent 
programming has resulted in huge fines, 
so PDs must be especially vigilant in this 
area.
24.  Payola (plugola) has plagued the 
medium since the 1950s and continues to 
this day. The illegal pay-for-play practice 
requires careful monitoring by the station’s 
PD and manager to ensure it does not occur. 
Large fines have been dealt to those sta-
tions violating the FCC laws governing this 
practice.
25.  Web sites, podcasts, and blogs represent 
a way to strengthen a station’s ties to its 
audience.

26.  Stations must pay an annual music-
licensing fee to ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.
27.  In the 2000s, the recording industry 
required that radio stations streaming music 
on their Web sites had to compensate it for 
such use.

Copyright and the Broadcast Industry
One of the least discussed aspects 
of the broadcast industry is the role 
of copyright in broadcast decision 
making. Copyright is the area of law 
that protects the owner of artistic, 
creative, and intellectual works from 
unauthorized use by a second party 
absent the payment of a fee.
There are many examples of the 
type of payment required for the use 
of a creative work. For instance, if a 
radio station wants to play a song 
by Aerosmith, that station must pay 
a royalty to the owner of the musical 
copyright. Meanwhile, if a UHF televi-
sion station wants to schedule 26 epi-
sodes of Will and Grace, it must pay a 
royalty to the syndication company that 
controls the right to distribute copies of 
the popular television comedy.
Music is a very popular area for 
copyright fees. Most musicians do not 
handle the paperwork and fee collec-
tion activities for their music. Instead, 
they assign the rights to a copyright 
clearinghouse. For broadcasters, 
there are three important music clear-
inghouses. The oldest of the clear-
inghouses is the ASCAP. ASCAP has 
satellite offices near most major cities, 
and it monitors radio and television 
station logs, visits night clubs and 
universities, and sells site licenses to 
businesses that want to play music, 
such as fitness gyms and restaurants. 
The second most prominent music clear-
inghouse is BMI. BMI started in the late 
1940s when ASCAP substantially raised 
the royalty rates for music played at 
radio stations. Many of the radio sta-
tions refused to pay the higher rates, 
and they began to sign up ­independent 
recording artists who would get exclu-
sive play on their stations. Several of 
the early legends of Rock ‘n’ Roll, such 
as Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Little 
Richard, received extensive airtime on 
BMI-affiliated stations due to the feud 
between BMI and ASCAP. The third 
music clearinghouse is the SESAC. A 
few years ago, Bob Dylan signed an 
agreement with SESAC for an advance 
of several million dollars. SESAC will 
handle the authorized use of Dylan’s 
music in European and enumerated 
other markets. SESAC is betting that 
future revenues from Dylan’s music will 
be sufficient to offset the huge advance 
paid to Dylan in current dollars.
Paul Goldstein is correct: Copy-
right is primarily about money, and 
it frequently involves decision making 
and speculation about what creative 
works will provide the optimal return 
on an investment. The Beatles sold the 
rights to their most well-known music 
from the 1960s, seriously misjudging 
how popular that music would be 45 
years after its release. Neil Sedaka, a 
prominent 1950s rock musician, sold 
the copyrights to his music shortly after 
the British musical invasion during the 
mid-1960s. Once Sedaka discovered 
that there was a lucrative market for 
music nostalgia and oldies concerts, the 
first thing he did was to repurchase the 
copyrights to his own songs.
Apart from money, there is a very 
sound philosophical rationale for 
maintaining a system of copyrights. 
Copyright laws are designed to create 
an incentive for authors and innovators 
to produce artistic, creative, and intel-
lectual works. There is a benefit in this 
system for the individual as well as for 
society at large. For instance, if you 
took a year off to produce and write 
a radio documentary, you would forgo 
a year’s income and incur expenses to 
complete the desired project. If someone 
else could simply copy your work and 
sell it at a cheaper price because he 
or she had no major costs associated 
with creating the work, it is unlikely that 
any individual would write a second 
screenplay, book, or album. And society 
would be worse off because it would no 
longer be the beneficiary of these crea-
tive works from talented individuals.
In a word, copyright laws are designed 
to create incentives for ­individuals to 
produce creative works and to protect 
these innovators against unauthorized use 
of their work. The high prices that crea-
tors are able to charge is the bargain 
society strikes to obtain a second, third, 
and fourth work from creative individuals. 
A copyright has limitations: it lasts the life 
of an author plus 70 years, or in the case 
of a work-for-hire (something assigned to 
an independent contractor), 95 years. 
The work then goes into the public 
domain to be used by anyone without a 
fee, such as the plays of Shakespeare or 
the music of Beethoven.
Until recently, copyright issues did 
not generate interest among the general 
public. These questions involve a rela-
tionship between producers of creative 
works and the users of these materials. 
Moreover, the distribution of information 
is an expensive process undertaken pri-
marily by large organizations that antic-
ipate profiting from the material. In fact, 
it is fair to characterize the traditional 
copyright relationship as one between 
owners of copyright materials and users 
who typically are big media companies 
or major distributors.
However, this owner-user relationship 
has been undermined by modern technol-
ogy. The development of the Internet and 
the digitization of intellectual property 
make it easier for the average person 
to make copies of creative works with 
relative ease. No special expertise is 
needed, and the works are verbatim 
copies reproduced at relatively low costs.

CHAPTER 3 Programming

The development of the Internet is 
likely to have major implications for 
traditional broadcast stations and 
broadcasting activities. Among these 
developments are as follows:
•	Music File Sharing: The use of MP3 
files to exchange music has become 
one of the most popular activities of 
the millennial decade. It has been 
troublesome to record companies, 
and it will likely affect the number of 
listeners of traditional radio stations 
that continue to program music. If the 
record industry develops a pay-per-
song satellite technology that allows 
anyone to listen to uninterrupted music 
via a radio receiver or even a cell 
phone, traditional radio stations are 
likely to see a decline of listenership. 
In addition, traditional radio stations 
have been exempted from a special 
performance royalty that goes directly 
to the performer; but web stations must 
still pay the fee. Understandably, there 
is substantial controversy over whether 
Internet webcasters, as they emerge, 
should be permitted to have a similar 
exemption like terrestrial stations from 
performance royalties.
•	Webcasting: It is one of the 
growing areas of technological 
innovation. Radio maverick Howard 
Stern recently complained that tradi-
tional broadcast stations were using 
parts of his satellite program without 
paying any royalties. Stern, whose 
career has been associated with 
rebellion, not following the rules, 
and creative expression, wants to 
be compensated fairly for the work 
he creates. Moreover, it is likely that 
webcasters will want to receive royal-
ties for the distribution of their work 
similar to terrestrial stations.
•	Digital Sampling: One of the 
recurrent copyright issues over the 
past decade has been digital sam-
pling. Sampling is taking sounds from 
a previous recording and placing 
them in a new musical work. For 
instance, the first note in the Beatles’ 
well-known song, “A Hard Days 
Night,” is so distinctive that it can be 
recognized as a standalone work. 
There are now several commercial 
digital samplers on the market. One 
of the most popular is the Fairlight 
CMI, or Computer Musical Instru-
ment. It cost around $30,000 to pur-
chase. Sampling has been especially 
popular within Hip-Hop music, and 
several Hip-Hop artists claim that sam-
pling is a culturally expressive activity 
worthy of legal protection because 
of its rearrangements, remixes, and 
otherwise altered sequence and 
quality. However, in Bridgeport Music 
v. Dimension Film (2005), the Sixth 
Circuit ruled against sampling. The 
court stated: “Get a license or do 
not sample.” Thus far, this is the most 
important ruling on sampling, but 
another case will surely confront the 
innovative applications of digital sam-
pling. It is very unlikely that we have 
heard the last word on this issue.
•	Copyright Arbitration Royalty 
Tribune: Although Congress is 
empowered to regulate the develop-
ment of copyright, it has established 
a Royalty Tribune to set reasonable 
rates and to monitor emerging issues. 
At the same time, what rates to 
establish and how to handle web-
casting remain unclear. Even setting 
reasonable rates for subscription 
services has proven to be difficult. In 
1995, Congress passed the Digital 
Performance Rights in Sound Record-
ing Act (DPRA). This act governs sub-
scription digital audio transmissions 
or what we today recognize as XM 
Satellite Radio and Sirius. The Radio 
Industry Association of America 
(RIAA) and the organizations repre-
senting small webcasters have vigor-
ously lobbied the Royalty Tribune 
for favorable rates. Interestingly, the 
National Association of Broadcasters 
(NAB) has refused to provide support 
for the fledgling webcasters and the 
new digital media providers. Instead, 
the NAB has focused on maintaining 
the rights and interests of traditional, 
terrestrial broadcasters. One of the 
emerging problems in broadcast-
ing is the need to incorporate all 
relevant parties in the decision-
making process with respect to 
copyright issues so that small, digital 
­webcasters and the large terrestrial 
broadcasters can address common 
issues that affect their organizations.
•	Convergence: One of the most 
vexing issues facing broadcasters at 
the end of the millennial decade is 
the question of convergence. Con-
vergence refers to the ability to use 
information and content from one 
medium to another medium. Among 
the by‑products of convergence is the 
ability to watch your favorite television 
programs on the Internet, download 
current movies directly to your compu-
ter, and use a wireless telephone with 
a GPS tracking system capable of pin-
pointing the exact location of a caller. 
In a word, convergence is the blurring 
of the lines between and among the 
existing forms of media. Convergence 
will provide innovative services and 
the “new ways of interacting with 
society.” Existing owners of copyrights 
are understandably troubled. In what 
will be a landmark case, Viacom has 
sued YouTube and Google for $1 
billion dollars for infringement of its 
copyrights. Like earlier copyright suits 
dealing with Napster and Grokster, 
Viacom v. YouTube and Google is a 
landmark case about the payment of 
royalties when information is distrib-
uted on the Internet. Broadcasters are 
attempting to be proactive with the 
new digital technologies by asking for 
the insertion of a software code (or a 
broadcast flag system) that regulates 
digital television and digital audio 
receivers on what programs an end 
user will be able to download. This is 
a blocking procedure that will prevent 
an individual without authorization 
from downloading the information, 
including the downloading of content 
(such as music from a radio feed) 
directly to a cell phone. So far, Con-
gress has not adopted this form of 
technological protection, but broad-
casters are rightly concerned about 
the long-term impact of convergence 
on digital rights management (DRM) 
and what the effect of convergence 
will be on their revenues.

Weather is one of the principal reasons people 
choose a radio station. The forecast (or the Radar 
Weather franchise) is only as credible as we make 
it (the information all comes from the same 
place).
5.  Talk between records. The music should 
never stop unless it has to (commercials). Stop-
ping it down to talk, even for a liner that can be 
delivered over an intro, kills the momentum.
6.  There are literally no prepromotes going 
into stop sets. The listener is not given any 
reasons to stick around (and forward momentum 
again stops).
7.  There are recorded PSAs (a corporate 
no-no). The one I heard tells us to wear seat belts. 
Every media, every politician, every do-gooder is 
trying to tell other people what to do. Let’s just 
be the medium that informs and entertains. Let’s 
be an escape from all the other pointed fingers.
8.  Joe signs off his show and also refers to his 
listener as “everybody.” We should talk to only 
one listener at a time. And we should never end 
anything – keep it going, part of forward momen-
tum. Talk about the guy coming up next.
9.  Could you send Joe a memo or talk with 
him on a visit soon? I want to keep that station 
tight and happening; it’s important.
10.  Also, what do you think about adding 
some Beatles songs (over and above what we 
have) for the next month or so? And trading/
giving away some anthology CDs? Thanks.

Re: WLKZ Programming
In listening over the past few days, but only to 
an hour or two total, it appears that much of 
the “big picture” programming philosophy has 
been lost. Perhaps Joe hasn’t reviewed the old 
operation’s manual. But some mechanical changes 
could dramatically help the sound of the station 
until the philosophy is recreated or changed.
1.  One part-timer’s mike was way too hot 
compared to the music. Music should always be 
­dominant; personalities should never overwhelm 
it. The voice should be “in” the music.
2.  Song titles were often announced. Oldies 
listeners know the song titles, and a lot more than 
our own people do about every record. There 
is also the danger that our mostly young talent 
will say something that reveals their age/lack 
of knowledge when talking about music. This is 
unnecessary talk and should be eliminated.
3.  Conversely, there is almost no local 
content. This does not mean PSAs about bean 
suppers; this means the progress on the new 
building in downtown Wolfeboro, or the time 
the town Christmas lights will be turned on, for 
example. It takes more work than announcing a 
song title, but it’s a much better reason to listen.
4.  After the weather was given, the personal-
ity commented, “At least that’s what it says here.”

1920s and early 1930s. Stations, ­networks, 
and advertising agencies often lured clients 
onto the air by naming or renaming pro-
grams after their products, such as Eveready 
Hour, Palmolive Hour, Fleischmann Hour, 
Clicquot Club Eskimos, The Coty Playgirl, 
and so on. Because formidable opposi-
tion to commercialization existed in the 
beginning, sponsorships, in which the 
only reference to a product was in a pro-
gram’s title, appeared the best path to 
take. This approach was known as indirect 
advertising.
As the outcry against advertiser-sup-
ported radio subsided, stations became 
more blatant or direct in their presentation 
of commercial material. Parcels of time, 
anywhere from 1–5, even 10, minutes, 
were sold to advertisers eager to convey 
the virtues of their labors. Industry adver-
tising revenues soared throughout the 
1930s, despite the broken economy. Radio 
sales people were among the few who had 
a salable product. World War II increased 
the rate of sales revenues twofold. As it 
became the foremost source of news and 
information during that bleak period in 
American history, the value of radio’s stock 
reached new highs, as did the incomes of 
sales people. The tide would shift, however, 
with the advent of television in the late 
1940s.
When television unseated radio as the 
number one source of entertainment in the 
early 1950s, time sellers for the deposed 
medium found their fortunes sagging. In 
the face of adversity, as well as opportu-
nity, many radio sales people abandoned

Commercialization: 
A Retrospective
As the first decade of the twenty-first 
century wound down, the level of radio 
advertising did as well, due to a deci-
mated economy. In fact, late in 2007, the 
Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB) reported 
18 consecutive months of decline. Still, 
selling commercials keeps the major-
ity of radio stations on the air. It is 
that simple – yet not so simple. In the 
1920s, broadcasters realized the neces-
sity of converting the medium into a 
sponsor-supported industry. It seemed  
to be the most viable option and the key 
to growth and prosperity. However, not 
everyone approved of the method. Oppo-
nents of commercialization argued that 
advertising would decrease the medium’s 
ability to effectively serve the public’s 
good, and one U.S. senator voiced fears 
that advertisers would turn radio into an 
on-air pawnshop. These predictions would 
prove to be somewhat accurate. By the 
mid-1920s, most radio outlets sold airtime, 
and few restrictions existed pertaining to 
the substance and content of messages. 
Commercials promoting everything from 
miracle pain relievers to instant hair-grow-
ing solutions filled the broadcast day. It 
was not until the 1930s that the govern-
ment developed regulations that addressed 
the issue of false advertising claims. This 
resulted in the gradual elimination of 
sponsors peddling dubious products.
Program sponsorships were the most 
popular form of radio advertising in the 
125 

in an attempt to improve their marketing 
potential, and some FM outlets have taken 
to airing nonmusic formats as a way of sur-
viving the ratings battles.
Selling time in the new millennium 
is a far cry from what it was like during 
the medium’s heyday. Observes general 
manager (GM) Ted Jordan, “Five years ago 
sales people on a call spent a lot of time 
separating their stations from competitors. 
For example “We’re the contest station,” 
“We’re the office station,” etc. Now, with 
consolidation, we gloss over the differ-
ences. “Here’s what it will cost you and 
here’s what we’re willing to add” comes 
up much faster.”
Station account executives no longer 
search for advertisers willing to sponsor 
half-hour sitcoms, quiz shows, or myster-
ies. Today, the advertising dollar generally is 
spent on spots scheduled for airing during 
specific dayparts on stations that attract 
a particular piece of the highly fraction-
alized radio audience pie. The majority of 
radio outlets program prerecorded music, 
and it is that which constitutes the station’s 
product. The salesperson sells the audience, 
which the station’s music attracts, to the 
advertiser or time buyer.
the old in preference for the new, opting 
to sell for television. Radio was, indeed, 
in a dilemma of frightening proportions, 
but it soon put itself back on course by 
renovating its programming approach. 
By 1957, the medium had undergone an 
almost total transformation and was once 
again enjoying the rewards of success. Sales 
people concentrated on selling airtime to 
advertisers interested in reaching specific 
segments of the population. Radio became 
extremely localized and, out of necessity, 
the networks diverted their attention to 
television.
Competition also became keener. Thou-
sands of new outlets began to broadcast 
between 1950 and 1970. Meanwhile, fre-
quency modulation (FM) started to spread 
its wings, preparing to surpass its older 
rival. Amplitude modulation (AM) music 
stations experienced great difficulties in 
the face of the mass exodus to FM, which 
culminated in 1979 when FM exceeded 
AM’s listenership. FM became the medium 
to sell.
In the first half of the 1980s, radio pro-
gramming was easily divisible. Talk was 
found on AM and music on FM. Today, hun-
dreds of AM stations have become stereo

Challenging Radio Sales
Here is what I see as the issues con-
fronting radio sales at the present time:
1.	 Radio ad spending is declining due 
to the economy and shifting media 
allocation strategies.
2.	 Trying to ramp up Web revenues 
fast enough to offset loss of on-air 
advertising and the resulting 
­valuation drops.
  3.	 Managing with fewer resources – 
people, capital, and facilities.
  4.	 Changing audience consump-
tion patterns – shifts to streaming, 
mobile, and players.
  5.	 With revenues and valuations 
declining, more owners are facing 
challenges as they push against 
debt covenants and risk defaults or 
at least loan workouts.

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

Selling Airtime
Airtime is intangible. You cannot see it or 
hold it in your hand. It is not like any other 
form of advertising. Newspaper and maga-
zine ads can be cut out by the advertiser 
and pinned to a bulletin board or taped to 
a window as tangible evidence of money 
spent. Television commercials can be seen, 
but radio commercials are sounds flitting 
through the ether with no visual compo-
nent to attest to their existence. They are 
ephemeral, or fleeting, to use words that 
are often associated with radio advertising. 
However, any informed account executive 
will respond to such terms by stating the 
simple fact that an effective radio commer-
cial makes a strong and lasting impression 
on the mind of the listener in much the 
same way that a popular song tends to per-
meate the gray matter. “The so-called intan-
gible nature of a radio commercial really 
only means you can’t see it or touch it. 
There is little doubt, however, that a good 
spot is concrete in its own unique way. Few 
of us have gone unaffected or, better still, 
untouched by radio commercials. If a spot 
is good, it is felt, and that’s a tangible,” says 
radio sales manager Charles W. Friedman.
Initially considered an experimental or 
novel way to publicize a product, it soon 
became apparent to advertisers that radio 
was far more. Early sponsors who earmarked 
a small portion of their advertising budgets 
to the new electronic “gadget,” while pouring 
the rest into print, were surprised by the 
results. Encouraged by radio’s performance, 
advertisers began to spend more heavily. By 
the 1930s, many prominent companies were 
reallocating substantial portions of their 
print advertising budgets for radio. To these 
convinced advertisers, radio was, indeed, a 
concrete way to market their products.
Yet the feeling that radio is an uncon-
ventional mode of advertising continues to 
persist to some extent even today, espe-
cially among small, print-oriented retailers. 
Usually, the small market radio station’s 
prime competitor for ad dollars is the local 
newspaper. Many retailers have used papers 
for years and perceive radio as a secondary 
or even frivolous means of advertising, con-
tends Friedman. “Retailers who have used 
print since opening their doors for business 
are reluctant to change. The toughest factor 
facing a radio salesperson is the notion that 
the old way works the best. It is difficult to 
overcome inertia.”
Radio is one of the most effective means 
of advertising when used correctly. Of 
course, there is a right way and a wrong 
way to use the medium, and the salesper-
son who knows and understands the unique 
character of his or her product is in the best 
position to succeed. To the extent that a 
radio commercial cannot be held or taped 
to a cash register, it is intangible.
However, the results produced by a care-
fully conceived campaign can be seen in the 
cash register. Consistent radio users, from 
the giant multinational corporations to the 
so-called mom-and-pop shops, know that 
a radio commercial can capture people’s 
attention as effectively as anything crossing 
their field of vision. A 1950s promotional 
slogan says it best: “Radio gives you more 
than you can see.”
On a final note, Ed Shane says that although 
over-the-air advertising remains the primary 
source of income for most stations, “non-
traditional revenue (NTR) streams (such as 
a Web site or special events) help stations 
realize financial goals.”

Selling Airtime

Becoming an Account Executive
A notion held by some sales managers is 
that sales people are born and not made. 
This position holds that a salesperson either 
“has it” or does not, “it” being the innate 
gift to sell, without which all the school-
ing and training in the world means little. 
Although not all sales managers embrace 
this theory, many agree with the view that 
anyone attempting a career in sales should 
first and foremost possess an unflagging 
desire to make money, because without it, 
failure is almost assured.
According to RAB figures, 70% of the 
radio sales people hired by stations are 
gone within 3 years; another study shows 
that 73% of new radio sales people leave 
the business within a year. Although this 
sounds less than encouraging, it also must 
be stated that to succeed in broadcast sales 
invariably means substantial earnings and 
rapid advancement. True, the battle can be 
a tough one and the dropout rate is high, 
but the rewards of success are great.
The majority of newly hired account 
executives have college training. An under­
standing of research, marketing, and finance  
is important. Formal instruction in these 
areas is particularly advisable for persons 
considering a career in broadcast sales. 
Broadcast sales has become a familiar course  
offering at many schools with programs 
in electronic media. Research and mar-
keting courses designed for the broadcast 
major also have become more prevalent 
since the 1970s. “Young people applying 
for sales positions here, for the most part, 
have college backgrounds. A degree indi-
cates a certain amount of tenacity and per-
severance, which are important qualities in 
anyone wanting to sell radio. Not only that, 
but the ­candidate with a degree often is 
more articulate and self-assured. As in most 
other areas of radio, ten or fifteen years ago 
fewer people had college diplomas, but the 
business has become so much more sophis-
ticated and complex because of the greater 
competition and emphasis on research that 
managers actually look for sales people 
with college training,” says general manager 
Richard Bremkamp.
Whether a candidate for a sales posi-
tion has extensive formal training or not, 
he or she must possess a knowledge of the 
product in order to be hired. “To begin 
with, an applicant must show me that she 
knows something about radio; after all, that 
is what we’re selling. The individual doesn’t 
necessarily have to have a consummate 
understanding of the medium, although 
that would be nice, but she must have 
some product knowledge. Most stations are 
willing to train to an extent. I suppose you 
always look for someone with some sales 
experience, whether in radio or in some 
other field,” says general sales manager Bob 
Turley.
Stations do prefer a candidate with sales 
exposure, be it selling vacuum cleaners door-
to-door or shoes in a retail store. “Being 
out in front of the public, especially in a 
selling situation, regardless of the product, 
is excellent training for the prospective 
radio sales rep. I started in the transporta-
tion industry, first in customer service, then 
in sales. After that I owned and operated 
a restaurant. Radio sales was a whole new 
ball game for me when I went to work for 
WCFR in Springfield, Vermont, in the mid-
1970s. Having dealt with the public for two 
decades served me well. In two years I rose 
to be the station’s top biller, concentrat-
ing mainly on direct retail sales. In 1979, 
WKVT in Brattleboro hired me as sales 
manager,” recalls Charles W. Friedman.
Hiring inexperienced sales people is a 
gamble that a small radio station generally 
must take. The larger outlets almost always 
require radio sales credentials, a luxury that 
smaller stations cannot afford. Thus, they 
must hire untested sales people, and there 
are no guarantees that a person who has 
sold lawn mowers can sell airtime, that is, 
assuming that the newly hired salesper-
son has ever sold anything at all. In most 
cases, he or she comes to radio and sales 
without experience, and the station must 
provide at least a modicum of training. 
Unfortunately, many stations fail to provide 
­adequate ­training, and this too contributes 
to the high rate of turnover. New sales 
people commonly are given 2 to 3 months 
to display their wares and exhibit their 
potential. If they prove themselves to the 
sales manager by ­generating new business, 
they are asked to stay. On the other hand, 
if the sales manager is not convinced that 
128 	
CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

the ­apprentice salesperson has the ability 
to bring in the accounts, then he or she is 
shown the door.
During the trial period, the salesperson 
is given a modest draw against sales, or a 
“no-strings” salary on which to subsist. In 
the former case, the salesperson eventually 
must pay back, through commissions on 
sales, the amount that he or she has drawn. 
Thus, after a few months, a new salesperson 
may well find himself or herself in debt for 
$2000 or $3000. As a show of confidence 
and to encourage the new salesperson who 
has shown an affinity for radio sales, man-
agement may erase the debt. If a station 
decides to terminate its association with the 
new salesperson, it must absorb the loss of 
time, energy, and money invested in the 
employee.
Characteristics that managers most often 
look for in prospective sales people include 
ambition, confidence, energy, determina-
tion, honesty, and intelligence. “Ambition is 
the cornerstone of success. It’s one of the 
first things I look for. Without it, forget it. 
You have to be hungry. It’s a great motiva-
tor. You have to be a quick thinker – be 
able to think on your feet, under pressure, 
too. Personal appearance and grooming also 
are important,” says sales manager Gene 
Etheridge.
Station sales manager Joe Martin places a 
premium on energy, persistence, creativity, 
and organization. “Someone who is a self-
starter makes life a lot easier. No manager 
likes having to keep after members of his 
sales team. A salesperson should take ini-
tiative and be adept at planning his day. 
Too many people make half the calls they 
should and could. A salesperson without 
organizational skills is simply not going to 
bring in the same number of orders as the 
person who does. There is a correlation 
between the number of pitches and the 
number of sales.”
Metro market general sales manager Peg 
Kelly values people skills. “Empathy is right 
up there. I need someone who possesses 
the ability to get quick answers, learn the 
client’s business quickly, and relate well 
to clients. It’s a people business, really.” 
Charles W. Friedman also looks for sales 
personnel who are people oriented. “My 
experience has proven that a prospective 
salesperson had better like people. In other 
words, be gregarious and friendly. This is 
something that’s hard to fake. Sincerity, 
or the lack of it, shows. If you’re selling 
airtime, or I guess anything for that matter, 
you had better enjoy talking with people as 
well as listening. A good listener is a good 
salesperson. Another thing that is abso-
lutely essential is the ability to take rejec-
tion objectively. It usually takes several 
‘no’s’ to get to the ‘yes.’”
Friedman believes that it is important for 
a salesperson to have insight into human 
nature and behavior. “You really must be 
adept at psychology. Selling really is a matter 
of anticipating what the prospect is think-
ing and knowing how best to address his 
concerns. It’s not so much a matter of out-
thinking the prospective client, but rather 
being cognizant of the things that play a 
significant role in his life. Empathy requires

radio station itself rather than immediately 
looking elsewhere for sales people. For 
decades, it was believed that programming 
people were not suited for sales. An inex-
plicable barrier seemed to separate the two 
areas. Since the 1970s, however, this atti-
tude has changed to some degree, and sales 
managers now give serious consideration to 
on-air people who desire to make the tran-
sition into sales. Consolidation and down-
sizing in the 1990s also inspired multiple 
roles playing at stations. That is to say, the 
morning deejay may become the afternoon 
salesperson. The major advantage of hiring 
programming people to sell the station is 
that they have a practical understanding of 
the product. “A lot of former deejays make 
good account reps because they had to sell 
the listener on the product. A deejay really 
is a salesperson, when you get right down to 
it,” observes broadcaster Joe Martin.
Realizing, too, that sales is the most direct 
path into station management, program-
ming people often are eager to make the 
shift. Since the 1980s, the trend has been 
greater than ever to recruit managers from 
the programming ranks. However, a sales 
background is still preferred.
The salesperson is invariably among 
the best-paid members of a station. How 
much a salesperson earns is usually left 
up to the individual to determine. Con-
trary to popular opinion, the salesperson’s 
salary generally exceeds the deejay’s, espe-
cially in the smaller markets. In the larger 
markets, certain air personalities’ salaries are 
astronomical and even surpass the general 
manager’s income, but major market sales 
salaries are commonly in the five- and even 
six-figure range.
Entry-level sales positions are fairly abun-
dant (although station consolidation has 
reduced these opportunities), and stations 
are always on the lookout for good people. 
Perhaps, no other position in the radio 
station affords an individual the opportuni-
ties that sales does, but most sales people 
will never go beyond entry level in sales. 
Yet, for those who are successful, the payoff 
is worthwhile. “The climb itself can be the 
most exhilarating part, I think. But you’ve 
got to have a lot of reserve in your tanks, 
because the air can be pretty thin at times,” 
observes Etheridge.
the ability to appreciate the experiences of 
others. A salesperson who is insensitive to a 
client’s moods or states of mind usually will 
come away empty handed.”
In recent years, sales managers have 
recruited more heavily from within the

five. Large, top-ranked metropolitan outlets 
employ as many as eight to ten sales people, 
although it is more typical for the major-
market station to have approximately a 
half-dozen account executives. Of course, 
in cluster operations where team selling 
often exists, these numbers will vary, as a 
salesperson may be selling the airtime of 
several stations. In cluster operations, it is 
not uncommon for there to be dozens of 
sales personnel.
The general sales manager/DOS reports 
directly to the station or station cluster’s 
general manager and works closely with 
the programming department in developing 
salable features. Regular daily and weekly 
sales meetings are scheduled and headed 
by the sales manager, during which time 
goals are set and problems addressed. The 
sales manager also assigns account lists to 
members of his or her staff and helps coor-
dinate trade and co-op deals.
As mentioned earlier, the head of the 
sales department usually is responsible for 
maintaining close contact with the station’s 
rep company as a way of generating income 
from national advertisers who are handled 
by advertising agencies. The relationship of 
the sales manager and rep company is a 
particularly important one and will be dis-
cussed in greater detail later in this chapter. 
In addition, the sales manager must be adept 
at working ratings figures to the station’s 
advantage for inclusion in sales promotional 
materials that are used on both the national 
and local levels.
All sales come under the scrutiny of the 
sales manager, who determines whether an 
account is appropriate for the station and 
The Sales Manager
The general sales manager (also called direc-
tor of sales (DOS) in cluster operations) 
supervises the marketing of a station’s or 
cluster’s airtime. This person is responsible 
for moving inventory, which in the case of 
the radio outlet constitutes the selling of 
spot and feature schedules to advertisers. To 
achieve this end, the sales manager directs 
the daily efforts of the station’s account 
executives, establishes sales department 
policies, develops sales plans and materials, 
conceives of sales and marketing campaigns 
and promotions, sets quotas, and also may 
sell as well.
A station’s sales department customarily 
includes an emphasis on national, regional, 
and local sales. The station’s or the clus-
ter’s general sales manager usually han­
dles national responsibilities. This includes 
working with the station’s rep company to 
stimulate business from national advertis-
ers. The regional sales manager is given the 
responsibility of exploring sales possibilities 
in a broad geographical area surrounding 
the station or stations. For example, the 
regional person for an outlet in New York 
City may be assigned portions of Connecti-
cut, New Jersey, and Long Island. The local 
sales manager at the same station would 
concentrate on advertisers within the city 
proper. The general sales manager oversees 
the efforts of each of these individuals.
The size of a station’s sales staff varies 
according to its location and reach. A typical 
small-market radio station employs between 
two and four account executives, and the 
medium-market station averages about

conditions of the sale meet established stan-
dards. In addition, the sales manager may 
have a policy that requires credit checks 
to be made on every new account and that 
new clients pay for a portion of their spot 
schedule up front as a show of good faith. 
Again, policies vary from station to station.
It is up to the head of sales to keep 
abreast of local and national sales and

and holidays.” A ­station’s approach to 
­discounting must be, of practical necessity, 
included in the rate card: “All programs, fea-
tures, and announcements are provided a 
5% discount if on the air for 26 consecutive 
weeks and a 10% discount if on the air for 
52 weeks.” (See Figure 4.8)
It is important to state as emphatically 
and clearly as possible the station’s position 
on all possible topics affecting a sale. Most 
stations provide clients with rate protection 
for a designated period of time should fees 
for airtime change. This means that if a client 
purchases a 3-month spot schedule in May, 
and the station raises its rates in June, the 
advertiser continues to pay the original rates 
until the expiration of its current contract.
The rate card also contains its feature 
and spot rates (see Figure 4.10). Among 
the most prevalent features that stations 
­marketing trends that can be used to the 
station’s advantage. This requires the sales 
manager to constantly survey trade maga-
zines like Radio Ink, Radio Business Report, 
and ADWEEK, and attend industry seminars 
such as those conducted by the RAB. No 
sales department can operate in a vacuum 
and hope to succeed in today’s dynamic 
radio marketplace.
Statistics continue to bear out the fact 
that sales managers are most often recruited 
to fill the position of general manager. It 
is also becoming more commonplace for 
sales managers to have experience in other 
areas of a station’s operations, such as pro-
gramming and production, a factor that has 
become increasingly important to the person 
who hires the chief account executive.
Radio Sales Tools
The fees that a station charges for airtime 
are published in its rate card. Rates for 
airtime depend on the size of a station’s 
listenership – the bigger the audience, the 
higher the rates. At the same time, the unit 
cost for a spot or a feature is affected by 
the quantity or amount purchased – the 
bigger the “buy,” the cheaper the unit price. 
Clients also get discounts for consecutive 
week purchases over a prescribed period of 
time – say, 26 or 52 weeks.
The sales manager and station manager 
(DOS and market manager in cluster setups) 
work together in designing the rate card, 
basing their decisions on ratings and what 
their market can support. A typical rate 
card will include a brief policy statement 
concerning terms of payment and com-
mission: “Bills due and payable when ren-
dered. Without prior credit approval, cash 
in advance required. Commission to recog-
nized advertising agencies on net charges for 
station time – 15%.” A statement pertaining 
to the nature of copy and when it is due at 
the station also may be included in the rate 
card: “All programs and announcements are 
subject to removal without notice for any 
broadcast which, in our opinion, is not in 
the public’s interest. Copy must be at the 
station 48 hours prior to broadcast date and 
before noon on days preceding ­weekends

may charge $300 for an announcement 
aired at 8 a.m. and $45 for one aired at 
2 a.m. The difference in the size of the 
station’s audience at those hours warrants 
the contrast.
As previously mentioned, the more 
airtime a client purchases, the less expen-
sive the cost for an individual commercial 
or unit. For instance, if an advertiser buys 
10 spots a week during AAA time, the cost 
of each spot would be slightly less than if 
the sponsor purchased two spots a week. 
A client must buy a specified number of 
spots to benefit from the frequency dis-
count. A 6X rate, meaning six spots per 
week, for AAA 60-second announcements 
may be $75; the 12X rate may be $71 and 
the 18X rate $68, and so forth. Thirty-
second spots are usually priced at two-
thirds the cost of a 60-second spot. Should 
a client desire that a spot be aired at a 
fixed time – say, at 7:10 a.m. daily – the 
station will tack on an additional charge, 
possibly 20%. Fixed position drive time 
spots are among the most expensive in a 
station’s inventory.
Many stations use a grid structure. This 
gives stations a considerable degree of rate 
flexibility. For example, if a station has five 
rate-level grids, it may have a range between 
$20 and $50 for a 60-second spot. Clients 
would then be given rates at the lower grid 
if the station had few sponsors on the air, 
thus creating many availabilities (places to 
insert commercial messages). As business 
increased at the station and availabilities 
became scarcer, the station would ask for 
rates reflected in the upper grids. Gridding 
is based on the age-old concept of supply 
and demand. When availabilities are tight 
and airtime is at a premium, that time costs 
more.
Grids are inventory sensitive; they allow 
a station to remain viable when business 
is at a low ebb. Certainly, when inventory 
prices reach a bargain level, this encour-
ages business. For instance, during a period 
when advertiser activity is sluggish, a station 
that can offer spots at a considerable reduc-
tion stands a chance of stimulating buyer 
interest.
When business is brisk at a station, 
because of holiday buying, for example, 
the situation may be exploited in a manner 
offer are traffic, sports, weather, and busi-
ness reports. Newscasts also are available 
to advertisers. Features generally include an 
open (introduction) and a 30- or 60-second 
announcement. They are particularly effec-
tive advertising vehicles because listeners 
tend to pay greater attention. Conditions 
pertaining to feature buys usually appear in 
the rate card: “All feature sales are subject to 
four weeks’ notice for renewal and cancella-
tion.” A station wants to establish credibility 
with its features and therefore prefers to 
maintain continuity among its sponsors. A 
feature with a regular sponsor conveys sta-
bility, and that is what a station seeks.
Because the size of a radio station’s 
audience generally varies depending on the 
time of day, rates for spots (commercials) 
or features must reflect that fact. Thus, the 
broadcast day is divided into time classifi-
cations: 6–10 a.m. weekdays is typically a 
station’s prime selling period and therefore 
may be designated AAA; afternoon drive 
time, usually 3–7 p.m., may be called AA

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

positive to the revenue column. Again the 
supply-and-demand concept is at work (one 
idea on which capitalism is based).
Not all stations grid their rate cards, 
however. Since the late 1970s, this system 
has gained considerable popularity because 
of its relevance to the ever fluctuating 
economy. As apparent in the rate cards 
exhibited in this chapter, grids are delin-
eated by some sort of scale, usually alpha-
betical or numerical.
Clients are offered several spot schedule 
plans suited for their advertising and bud-
getary needs. For advertisers with limited 
funds, run-of-station (ROS) or best-time-
available (BTA) plans are usually an option. 
Rates are lower under these plans because 
no guarantee is given as to what times the 
spots will be aired. However, most stations 
make a concerted effort to rotate ROS and 
BTA spots as equitably as possible, and 
during periods when commercial loads are 
light they frequently are scheduled during 
premium times. Of course, when a station 
is loaded down with spot schedules, espe-
cially around holidays or elections, ROS and 
BTA spots may find themselves buried. In 
the long run, advertisers using these plans 
receive a more than fair amount of choice 
times and at rates considerably lower than 
those clients who buy specific dayparts.
In Radio Advertising’s Missing Ingredient: 
The Optimum Effective Scheduling System by 
Pierre Bouvard and Steve Marx, an inno-
vative system is presented that improves 
the might of a spot schedule. According to 
the authors, “Optimum effective schedul-
ing ensures that the effective reach, those 
hit three or more times, is at least 50% of 
the total reach.” The idea behind optimum 
effective scheduling (OES) is to strengthen 
the impact of client buys. The OES formula 
is designed to heighten the efficiency of 
a spot buy through a system of schedul-
ing based on ratings performance. This is 
accomplished by factoring a station’s turn-
over ratio and cume.
Total audience plan (TAP) is another 
popular package offered clients by many 
stations. It is designed to distribute a cli-
ent’s spots among the various dayparts 
for maximum audience penetration, while 
costing less than an exclusive prime-time 
schedule. The rate for a TAP spot is arrived 
at by averaging the cost for spots in several 
time classifications. For example, AAA 
$80, AA $70, A $58, B $31; thus, the TAP 
rate per spot is $59. The advantages are 
obvious. The advertiser is getting a signifi-
cant discount on the spots scheduled during 
morning and afternoon drive periods. At the 
same time, the advertiser is paying more for 
airtime during evenings. However, TAP is 
very attractive because it does expose a cli-
ent’s message to every possible segment of a 
station’s listening audience with a measure 
of cost effectiveness.
Bulk or annual discounts are available to 
advertisers who buy a heavy schedule of 
commercials over the course of a year. Large 
companies in particular take advantage of 
volume discounts because the savings are 
significant.
Announcements are rotated or “orbited” 
within time classifications to maximize 
the number of different listeners reached. 
If a client buys three drive time spots per 
week to be aired on a Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday, over a 4-week period, the 
time they are scheduled will be differ-
ent each day. Here is a possible rotation 
setup:

Rather than purchase a consecutive week 
schedule, advertisers may choose to pur-
chase time in flights, an alternating pattern 
of being on one week and off the next. For 
instance, a client with a seasonal business or 
one that is geared toward holiday sales may 
set up a plan in which spots are scheduled at 
specific times throughout the year. Thus, an 
annual flight schedule may look something 
like this:
Feb 13–19 Washington’s Birthday Sale
10 A 60s
Mar 14–17 St. Patrick’s Day Celebration
8 ROS 30s
Apr 16–21 Easter Parade Days
20 TAP 30s
May 7–12 Mother’s Day Sale

week that precedes Washington’s Birthday 
to reach the home female audience. The A 
time on this station is 10:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m., 
so a schedule of spots here does a good 
job of targeting women who work at home. 
The client uses a TAP plan to move Easter 
inventory. This will get the client’s spot in 
all dayparts to help her reach as many dif-
ferent people as possible at the best unit 
price. During the back-to-school days of 
late August, the client once again targets 
the strongest female daypart on the station 
and around Christmas time the client pur-
chases the heaviest flight because this is 
the so-called do-or-die period (the time 
when business potential reaches its peak). 
The heavier spot ­purchase will help ensure 
success during this crucial time. Selling in 
flights makes a lot of sense to many adver-
tisers because of its calendar relevance.
Sales people use rate cards to plan and 
compute buys. It is generally perceived as a 
poor idea to simply leave it with a prospec-
tive client to figure out, even if such a request 
is made. First, few laypersons are really adept 
at reading rate cards and, second, a station 
does not like to publicize its rates to its 
­competition, which is what happens when 
too many station rate cards are in circula-
tion. Granted, it is quite easy for any station 
to obtain a competitor’s sales portfolio, but 
stations prefer to keep a low profile as a 
means of retaining a competitive edge.
Radio marketing expert Jay Williams, Jr., 
contends that the station rate card is on its 
way to obsolescence. “Most radio stations 
have gotten away or are getting away from 
using rate cards as much of the business 
is driven by supply and demand. Jennifer 
McCann, GM of Burlington Broadcast-
ers, told me recently that ‘While many 
small market stations still print and rely 
on rate cards, stations in major markets do 
not.’ Using systems similar to ‘yield man-
agement’ systems first introduced by the 
airline industry, medium and larger sta-
tions often use programs such as Maxigrid 
to manage and price their spot inventory 
to ensure their sales goals. A radio station 
is usually faced with uneven and ever-
changing demands on a limited amount 
of commercial time. Certain dayparts near 
the end of the week, special program-
ming, and drive times near holidays might

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

be easily sold out, yet other time periods 
might have plenty of ‘avails.’ Using an 
inventory management system enables sta-
tions to continuously price their inventory 
by day, daypart, and even by the hour well 
in advance. This knowledge gives the sales 
department the up-to-the minute pricing 
and ‘avail’ information it needs to serve 
the client and allows the station to main-
tain the maximum control of its inven-
tory. Even in smaller markets, rate cards 
are not used much except as a point for 
­negotiating. Rate cards are often confus-
ing and focus attention on the individual 
spot cost rather than the total cost of an 
advertising campaign. To compete against 
other media, radio has realized the value 
of creating customized presentations and 
programs for clients to respond to their 
specific needs and goals. Clients and agen-
cies sometimes do ask to see a rate card, 
but they are rapidly becoming extinct.”
Furthermore, observes WIZN’s Matt 
Grasso, “We never let sales people show rate 
cards to clients. Rate cards force the client 
to try to figure out our business, radio, when 
radio reps should be learning about their 
businesses and creating customized presen-
tations for them. Worse, clients always try to 
find the lowest rates on a rate card and then 
want to apply those rates to prime time 
forcing the radio salesperson to negotiate 
with himself. By using computerized inter-
nal rate cards, sales management can quickly 
and easily adjust rates to meet demand and 
ensure proper inventory control.”
Points of the Pitch
Not all sales are made on the first call; none-
theless, the salesperson does go in with the 
hopes of closing an account. The first call 
generally is designed to introduce the station 
to the prospective sponsor and to determine 
the sponsor’s needs. However, the salesper-
son should always be prepared to propose 
a buy that is suitable for the account. This 
means that some homework must be done 
relative to the business before an approach 
is made. “First determine the client’s needs, 
as best as possible. Then address those needs 
with a schedule built to reach the client’s 
customers. Don’t walk into a business cold 
or without some sense of what the place is 
about,” advises Friedman.
Should all go smoothly during the initial 
call, the salesperson may opt to go for an 
order there and then. If the account obliges, 
fine. In the event that the prospective adver-
tiser is not prepared to make an immediate 
decision, a follow-up appointment must be 
made. The callback should be accomplished 
as close to the initial presentation as ­possible 
to prevent the impression made then from 
fading or growing cold. The primary objective 
of the return call is to close the deal and get 
the order. To strengthen the odds, the sales-
person must review and assess any objections 
or reservations that may have arisen during 
the first call and devise a plan to overcome 
them. Meanwhile, the initial proposal may 
be beefed up to appear even more attractive 
to the client, and a “spec” tape (see the later 
section “Spec Spots”) for the business can be 
prepared as further enticement.

Points of the Pitch	
 137

•	 Display self-confidence; believe in your-
self and the product.
•	 Smile; exude friendliness, warmth, and 
sincerity.
•	 Listen; be polite, sympathetic, and 
­interested.
•	 Tell of the station’s successes; provide 
­testimonial material.
•	 Think creatively.
•	 Know your competition.
•	 Maintain integrity and poise.
•	 Look your best; check your appearance.
•	 Be objective and keep proper ­perspective.
•	 Pitch the decision maker.
•	 Ask for the order that will do the job.
•	 Service the account after the sale.
Don’t
•	 Pitch without a plan.
•	 Criticize or demean the client’s previous 
advertising efforts.
•	 Argue with the client. This just creates 
greater resistance.
•	 Bad-mouth the competition.
•	 Talk too much.
•	 Brag or be overly aggressive.
•	 Lie, exaggerate, or make unrealistic 
­promises.
•	 Smoke or chew gum in front of the 
client.
•	 Procrastinate or put things off.
•	 Be intimidated or kept waiting an unrea-
sonable amount of time.
•	 Make a presentation unless you have the 
client’s undivided attention.
•	 Lose your temper.
•	 Ask for too little; never undersell a 
client.
•	 Fail to follow-up.
•	 Accept a “no” as final.
Checklists like the preceding ones can 
serve only as basic guidelines. Anyone who 
has spent time on the street as a station 
account executive can expand on this or any 
other such checklist. For the positive-thinking 
radio salesperson, every call gives something 
back, whether a sale is made or not.
Overcoming common objections is a 
necessary step toward achieving the sale. 
Here are some typical “put-offs” presented 
to radio sales reps:
Should the salesperson’s efforts fail the 
second time out, a third and even fourth 
calls are made. Perseverance does pay off, 
and many sales people admit that just 
when they figured a situation was hope-
less, an account said yes. “Of course, beating 
your head against the wall accomplishes 
nothing. You have to know when your time 
is being wasted. Never give up entirely on 
an account; just approach it more sensibly. 
A  phone call or a drop-in every so often 
keeps you in their thoughts,” says general 
sales manager Ron Piro.
What follows are two checklists. The Do 
list contains some suggestions conducive to 
a positive sales experience, and the Don’t 
list contains things that will have a negative 
or counterproductive effect.
Do
•	 Research the advertiser; be prepared; have 
a relevant plan in mind.
•	 Be enthusiastic; think positive.

merit system. In this way, an account execu-
tive who has worked hard and produced 
results will be rewarded for his efforts by 
being given an agency to work. The top 
billers, that is, those sales people who bring 
in the most business often possess the great-
est number of agencies, or at least the most 
active. Although the percentage of com-
mission a salesperson is accorded, typically 
6–8%, is less than that derived from retail 
sales, the size of the agency buys usually is 
far more substantial.
The third category of station sales comes 
from the national level. In most cases, it 
is the general sales manager who works 
with the station’s rep company to secure 
buys from advertising agencies that handle 
national accounts. Again, national busi-
ness is greater for the metro station than 
it is for the rural. Agencies justify a buy 
on numbers and little else, although it 
is not uncommon for small market sta-
tions, which do not even appear in ratings 
surveys, to be bought by major accounts 
interested in maintaining a strong local or 
community image.
Producer Ty Ford observes that agency 
involvement has decreased in recent years 
because of intensified competition among 
the different media and the unpredictable 
national economy. “Increased competition 
from cable, television, radio, and print has 
forced many ad agencies out of business. 
  1.	 Nobody listens to radio commercials.
  2.	 Newspaper ads are more effective.
  3.	 Radio costs too much.
  4.	 Nobody listens to your station.
  5.	 We tried radio, and it didn’t work.
  6.	 We don’t need any more business.
  7.	 We’ve already allocated our advertising 
budget.
  8.	 We can get another station for less.
  9.	 Business is off, and we haven’t got the 
money.
10.	My partner doesn’t like radio.
There are countless rebuttals for each 
of these statements, and a knowledgeable 
and skilled radio salesperson can turn such 
objections into positives.
Levels of Sales
There are three levels from which the 
medium draws its sales: retail, local, and 
national. Retail accounts for the biggest per-
centage of the industry’s income, over 70%. 
Retail, also referred to as direct, sales involve 
the radio station on a one-to-one basis with 
advertisers within its signal area.
In this case, a station’s account executive 
works directly with the client and earns a 
commission of approximately 15% on the 
airtime he or she sells. An advertiser who 
spends $1000 would benefit the salesperson 
to the tune of $150. A newly hired salesper-
son without previous experience generally 
will work on a direct retail basis and will 
not be assigned advertising agencies until 
he or she has become more seasoned and 
has displayed some ability. Generally speak-
ing, the smaller the radio station, the more 
dependent it is on retail sales, although most 
medium and metro market stations would 
be in trouble without strong business on 
this level.
All stations, regardless of size, have some 
contact with advertising agencies. Here 
again, however, the larger a market, the 
more a station will derive its business from 
ad agencies. This level of station sales gen-
erally is classified as local. The number of 
advertising agencies in a market will vary 
depending on its size. A sales manager will 
divide the market’s agencies among his reps 
as equitably as possible, sometimes using a

RESOLUTIONS FOR SELLERS
(Now a perennial first-of-the-year TACTICS topic, these resolutions
are designed to inspire and motivate the sales staff.) 
I will have breakfast at 7:30 AM with at least two clients a week.
Each week, I will read a trade magazine from three client businesses.
I will set aside one hour a day to prepare written presentations.
One Saturday morning per month will be set aside to call on retailers. 
I will read at least one book on selling and one book on advertising each month.
I’ll carry a list of my top 10 prospects and call on at least one each day. 
I’ll follow each sales presentation with a hand-written “Thank You” note.  
I will remind myself each day that 8% of sales are made after the fifth call.  
I will demonstrate to my prospects that I am willing to work for their business.
I will always ask, “Is there something else you’d like to hear about?”
I will remind myself each day that I am not selling time—my business is
creating opportunities, processing ideas and distributing information.

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

­Stations now frequently offer ‘agency dis-
counts’ to direct-retail clients just to close the 
sale. Also, more retail companies are forming 
their own in-house agencies.” Although this 
may be true, the ad agency is still an impor-
tant factor in station revenues.
Each level of sales – retail, local, or 
national – must be sufficiently cultivated if 
a station is to enjoy maximum prosperity. 
Neglecting any one of these levels would 
result in a loss of station revenue.
Spec Spots
One of the most effective ways to convince 
an advertiser to use a station is to provide a 
fully produced sample commercial, or “spec 
spot.” If prepared properly and imagina-
tively, a client will find it difficult to deny 
its potential. Spec tapes often are used in 
callbacks when a salesperson needs to break 
down a client’s resistance. More than once, 
a clever spec spot has converted an adamant 
“no” into an “okay, let’s give it a shot.” Spec 
spots also are used to reactivate the interest 
of former accounts who may not have spent 
money on the station for a while and who 
need some justification to do so.
Specs also are effective tools for moti-
vating clients to “heavy-up” or increase 
their current spot schedules. A good idea 
can move a mountain, and sales people 
are encouraged by the sales manager to 
develop spec tape ideas. Many sales manag-
ers require that account executives make at 
least one spec tape presentation each week. 
The sales manager may even choose to cri-
tique spec spots during regularly scheduled 
meetings.
The information needed to prepare a 
spec spot is acquired in several ways. If a 
salesperson already has called on a pro-
spective client, he should have a very good 
idea of what the business is about as well 
as the attitude of the retailer toward the 
enterprise. The station sales rep is then in 
a very good position to prepare a spot that 
directly appeals to the needs and percep-
tions of the would-be advertiser. If a sales-
person decides that the first call on a client

On the Future Market for Radio
The radio industry has undergone 
radical but positive change in recent 
years and will continue to experi-
ence significant evolutionary changes 
between now and the end of the 
decade. Ironically, these changes are, 
in many ways, the result of a constant 
that we have witnessed throughout 
the history of the medium. Radio 
­consistently has shown a tremendous 
ability to adapt to a variety of market 
conditions, whether they be economic 
or competitive in nature. It is this flex-
ibility, a by-product of intelligent indus-
try leadership, that has fueled radio’s 
growth in the past and will continue to 
elevate the industry to new heights in 
the years to come.

together. This means selling the advertiser 
a sufficient number of commercials spread 
over a specific period of time. An occasional 
spot here and there doesn’t do much in this 
medium. There’s a right way to sell radio, 
and that isn’t it.”
Our lists of dos and don’ts of selling sug-
gested that the salesperson “ask for the order 
that will do the job.” It also said not to under-
sell an account. Implicit in the first point 
is the idea that the salesperson has deter-
mined what kind of schedule the advertiser 
should buy to get the results expected. Too 
often sales people fail to ask for what they 
need for fear the client will balk. Thus, they 
settle for what they can get without much 
resistance. This, in fact, may be doing the 
advertiser a disservice, because the buy that 
the salesperson settles for may not fulfill 
declared objectives. “It takes a little courage 
to persist  until you get what you think will 
do the job. There is the temptation just to 
take what the client hands you and run, but 
that technique usually backfires when the 
client doesn’t get what he expected. As a 
radio sales rep, you should know how best 
to sell the medium. Don’t be apologetic 
or easily compromised. Sell the medium 
the way it should be sold. Write enough 
of an order to get the job done,” says sales 
manager Ron Piro.
Inflated claims and unrealistic promises 
should never be a part of a sales presenta-
tion. Avoid “If you buy spots on my station, 
you’ll have to hire additional sales people to 
handle the huge crowds.” Sales people must 
be honest in their projections and in what 
a client may expect from the spot sched-
ule he or she purchases. “You will notice 
a gradual increase in store traffic over the 
next few weeks as the audience is exposed 
to your commercial over WXXX” is the 
better approach. Unfulfilled promises ruin 
any chances of future buys. Too often sales 
people, caught up in the enthusiasm of the 
pitch, make claims that cannot be achieved. 
Radio is a phenomenally effective advertis-
ing medium. This is a proven fact. Those 
who have successfully used the medium 
can attest to the importance of placing an 
adequate order. “An advertiser has to buy a 
decent schedule to get strong results. Fre-
quency is essential in radio,” notes Piro. A 
radio sales axiom says it best: “The more 
warrants ­preparing a spec tape, then he or 
she may collect information on the busi-
ness by actually browsing through the store 
as a customer might. This gives the sales-
person an accurate, firsthand impression of 
the store’s environment and merchandise. 
An idea of how the store perceives itself, 
and specific information such as address 
and hours, can be derived by checking its 
display ad in the Yellow Pages if it has one 
or by examining any ads it may have run in 
the local newspaper. Flyers that the business 
may have distributed also provide useful 
information for the formulation of the copy 
used in the spec spot. Listening to com-
mercials the advertiser may be running on 
another station also gives the salesperson an 
idea of the direction in which to move.
Again, the primary purpose of a spec 
spot is to motivate a possible advertiser to 
buy time. A spec spot that fails to capture 
the interest and appreciation of the indi-
vidual for which it has been prepared may 
be lacking in the necessary ingredients. It 
is generally a good rule of thumb to avoid 
humor in a spec spot, unless the salesperson 
has had some firsthand experience with the 
advertiser. Nothing fails as abysmally as a 
commercial that attempts to be funny and 
does not come across as such to the client – 
thus, the saying “What is funny to one person 
may be silly or offensive to another.”
Although spec spots are, to some extent, 
a gamble, they should be prepared in such 
a way that the odds are not too great. Of 
course, a salesperson who believes in an idea 
must have the gumption to go with it. Great 
sales are often inspired by unconventional 
concepts.
Objectives of the Buy
A single spot on a radio station seldom brings 
instant riches to an advertiser. However, 
a thoughtfully devised plan based on a 
formula of frequency and consistency will 
achieve impressive results, contends general 
manager John Gregory. “It has to be made 
clear from the start what a client hopes to 
accomplish by advertising on your station. 
Then a schedule that realistically corre-
sponds with the client’s goals must be put

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

competing radio outlets, and today, station 
sales people are also tapping the Internet 
and using e-mail to enhance their search for 
clients. Every business in the area is listed 
in the Yellow Pages, which contains many 
display ads that provide useful information. 
Local television stations are viewed with 
an eye toward their advertisers. Television 
can be an expensive proposition, even in 
smaller markets, and businesses that spend 
money on it may find radio’s rates more 
palatable. On the other hand, if a business 
can afford to buy television, it often can 
afford to embellish its advertising cam-
paign with radio spots. Many advertisers 
place money in several media – newspaper, 
radio, television – simultaneously. This is 
called a mixed media buy and is a proven 
advertising formula for the obvious reason 
that the client is reaching all possible audi-
ences. Finally, accounts currently on other 
stations constitute good prospects because 
they obviously already have been sold on 
the medium.
In the course of an average workday, a 
salesperson will pass hundreds of businesses, 
some of which may have just opened their 
doors, or are about to do so. Sales reps must 
keep their eyes open and be prepared to 
make an impromptu call. The old saying 
“the early bird gets the worm” is particu-
larly relevant in radio sales. The first account 
executive into a newly launched business 
often is the one who gets the buy.
A list containing dozens of accounts 
does not necessarily ensure a good income. 
If those businesses listed are small spend-
ers or inactive, little in the way of com-
missions will be generated and billing will 
be low. The objective of list building is not 
merely to increase the number of accounts, 
but rather to raise the level of commis-
sions it produces. In other words, a list 
that contains 30 accounts, of which 22 
are active, is preferable to one with 50 
accounts containing only 12 that are doing 
business with the station. A salesperson 
does not get points for having a lot of 
names on his list.
It is the sales manager’s prerogative to 
shift an account from one salesperson’s 
list to another’s if he or she believes the 
account is being neglected or handled 
incorrectly. At the same time, certain 
spots aired, the more impressions made, 
and the more impressions made, the more 
impressed the client.”
Prospecting and List Building
When a salesperson is hired by a radio 
station, he or she is customarily provided 
with a list of accounts to which airtime may 
be sold. For an inexperienced salesperson, 
this list may consist of essentially inactive 
or dormant accounts, that is, businesses that 
either have been on the air in the past or 
those that have never purchased airtime on 
the station. The new sales rep is expected 
to breathe life into the list by selling spot 
schedules to those accounts listed, as well 
as by adding to the list by bringing in new 
business. This is called list building, and it 
is the primary challenge facing the new 
account executive.
A more active list, one that generates 
commissions, will be given to the more 
experienced radio salesperson. A salesper-
son may be persuaded to leave one station 
in favor of another based on the contents of 
a list, which may include large accounts and 
prominent advertising agencies. Lists held 
by a station’s top billers invariably contain 
the most enthusiastic radio users. Sales 
people cultivate their lists as a farmer does 
his fields. The more the account list yields, 
the more commissions in the salesperson’s 
pocket.
New accounts are added to a sales rep’s 
list in several ways. Once the status of 
the list’s existing accounts is determined, 
which is accomplished through a series of 
in-person calls and presentations, a salesper-
son must begin prospecting for additional 
business. Area newspapers are a common 
source. When a salesperson finds an account 
that he wishes to add to his or her list, the 
account must be “declared.” This involves 
consulting the sales manager for approval to 
add the account to the salesperson’s existing 
list. In some cases, the account declared may 
already belong to another salesperson. If it is 
an open account, the individual who comes 
forward first usually is allowed to add it to 
his or her list.
Other sources for new accounts include 
the Yellow Pages, television stations, and

requires careful planning and organization. 
Ron Piro advises preparing a day’s itiner-
ary the night before. “There’s nothing worse 
than facing the day without an idea of where 
to go. A salesperson can spare himself that 
dreaded sensation and a lot of lost time by 
preparing a complete schedule of calls the 
night before.”
When preparing a daily call sheet, a 
salesperson, especially one whose station 
covers a vast area, attempts to centralize, as 
much as possible, the businesses to be con-
tacted. Time, energy, and gas are needlessly 
expended through poor planning. A sales 
rep who is traveling 10 miles between each 
presentation can get to only half as many 
clients as the person with a consolidated 
call sheet. Of course, there are days when 
a salesperson must spend more time travel-
ing. Not every day can be ideally plotted. It 
may be necessary to make a call in one part 
of the city at 9 a.m. and be in another part 
at 10 a.m. A salesperson must be where he 
or she feels the buys are going to be made. 
“Go first to those businesses likeliest to buy. 
­in-house accounts, those handled by the 
sales manager, may be added to a sales 
rep’s list as a reward for performing well. 
A salesperson’s account list also may be 
pared down if the sales manager concludes 
that it is disproportional with the others 
at the station. The attempt to more equi-
tably distribute the wealth may cause a 
brouhaha with the account person whose 
list is being trimmed. The sales manager 
attempting this feat may lose a top biller; 
thus, he or she must consider the ramifica-
tions of such a move and proceed accord-
ingly. This may even mean letting things 
remain as they are. The top biller often is 
responsible for as much as 30–40% of the 
station’s earnings.
Planning the Sales Day
A radio salesperson should make between 
75 and 100 in-person calls a week, or on the 
average of 15–20 each day, if possible. This

spent finding out that the store manager or 
owner is not on the premises when you get 
there, other, more productive calls can be 
made,” says Charles Friedman.
If a client is not available when the 
salesperson appears, a callback should be 
arranged for either later the same day or 
soon thereafter. The prospective advertiser 
should never be forgotten or relegated to a 
call 3 months hence. The sales rep should 
try to rearrange his or her schedule to 
accommodate a return visit the same day, 
given that the person to see is available. 
However, it is futile to make a presentation 
to someone who cannot give full attention. 
The sales rep who arrives at a business only 
to find the decision maker overwhelmed 
by distractions is wise to ask for another 
appointment. In fact, the client will per-
ceive this as an act of kindness and consid-
eration. Timing is important.
A record of each call should be kept 
for follow-up purposes. When calling on a 
myriad of accounts, it is easy to lose track 
of what transpired during a particular call. 
Maintaining a record of a call requires little 
more than a brief notation after it is made. 
Notes may then be periodically reviewed to 
help determine what action should be taken 
on the account. Follow-ups are crucial. 
There is nothing more embarrassing and 
disheartening than to discover a client, who 
was pitched and then forgotten, advertising 
on another station. Sales managers usually 
The tone of the day will be sweetened by 
an early sale,” contends Piro.
Sales managers advise their reps to list 
more prospects than they expect to contact. 
In so doing, they are not likely to run out of 
places to go should those prospects they had 
planned to see be unavailable. “You have to 
make the calls to make the sales. The more 
calls you make, the more the odds favor a 
sale,” points out Gene Etheridge.
Itineraries should be adhered to regard-
less of whether a sale is made early in the 
day, says WNRI’s John Gregory. “You can’t 
pack it in at ten in the morning because 
you’ve closed an account. A salesperson 
who is easily satisfied is one who will never 
make much money. You must stay true to 
your day’s game plan and follow through. 
No all-day coffee klatch at the local Ho-Jo’s 
or movie matinee because you nailed an 
order after two calls.”
The telephone is one of the salesperson’s 
best tools. Although it is true that a client 
cannot sign a contract over the phone, much 
time and energy can be saved through its 
effective use. Appointments can be made 
and a client can be qualified via the tele-
phone. That is to say, a salesperson can 
ascertain when the decision maker will be 
available. “Rather than travel twenty miles 
without knowing if the person who has the 
authority to make a buy will be around, take 
a couple of minutes and make a phone call. 
As they say, ‘time is money.’ In the time

Selling Personality
In the quickly evolving media land-
scape, winning radio personalities will 
save radio stations from advertiser 
erosion. Personality cannot be dupli-
cated. A hit music single cannot sell a 
product or compel a listener to patron-
ize an advertiser. A radio personality 
can easily accomplish this objective. A 
radio personality extolling the benefits 
of an advertiser in a live-read commer-
cial is always more effective than the 
best produced spot. A live appearance 
or broadcast by a radio personality 
can bring throngs of listeners to a retail 
advertiser. The hottest chart topping 
single can never compel and connect 
like radio talent. A radio personality 
not only entertains the listener with 
fresh, compelling content every day, 
the person behind the mic also nurtures 
listener loyalty and connection. Advertis-
ers desire this “stickiness” because the 
more the consumer is connected to a 
personality, the more likely the listener 
will trust and heed what he or she says 
about a product or service.

require that sales people turn in copies of 
their call sheets on a daily or weekly basis 
for review purposes.
Selling with and without 
Numbers
Not all stations can claim to be number 
one or two in the ratings. In fact, not 
all stations appear in any formal ratings 
survey. Very small markets are not visited 
by ­Arbitron or other rating services for the 
simple reason that there may be only one 
station broadcasting in the area. An outlet 
in a nonsurvey area relies on its good repu-
tation in the community to attract adver-
tisers. In small markets, sales people do not 
work out of a ratings book and clients are 
not concerned with cumes and shares. In 
the truest sense of the word, an account 
person must sell the station. Local busi-
nesses often account for more than 95% 
of a small market station’s revenue. Thus, 
the stronger the ties with the community, 
the better. Broadcasters in rural markets 
must foster an image of good citizenship 
to make a living.
Civic mindedness is not as market-
able a commodity in the larger markets 
as are ratings points. In the sophisticated 
­multistation urban market, the ratings book 
is the bible. A station without numbers in 
the highly competitive environment finds 
the task of earning an income a difficult 
one, although there are numerous exam-
ples of low-rated stations that do very well. 
However, “no numbers” pretty much puts 
a metro area station out of the running for 
agency business. Agencies almost invari-
ably “buy by the book.” A station without 
numbers “works the street,” to use the 
popular phrase, focusing its sales efforts on 
direct business.
An obvious difference in approaches 
exists between selling the station with 
ratings and the one without. In the first 
case, a station centers its entire presenta-
tion around its high ratings. “According to 
the latest Arbitron, WXXX-FM is number 
one with adults 24 to 39.” Never out of the 
conversation for very long are the station’s 
numbers, and at advertising agencies the 
station’s standing speaks for itself. “We’ll 
buy WXXX because the book shows that 
they have the largest audience in the demos 
we’re after.”
The station without rating numbers sells 
itself on a more personal level, perhaps focus-
ing on its unique features and special blend 
of music and personalities, and so forth. In an 
effort to attract advertisers, nonrated outlets 
often develop programs with a targeted retail 
market in mind; for example, a home “how-
to” show designed to interest hardware and 
interior decor stores, or a cooking feature 
aimed at food and appliance stores.
The salesperson working for the station 
with the cherished “good book” must be 
especially adept at talking numbers, because 
they are the key subject of the presenta-
tion in most situations. “Selling a top-rated 
metro station requires more than a pedes-
trian knowledge of numbers, especially 
FIGURE 4.18

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

when dealing with agencies. In big cities, 
retailers have plenty of book savvy, too,” 
contends Piro.
Selling without numbers demands its 
own  unique set of skills, notes WNRI’s 
Gregory. “There are really two different 
types of radio selling – with numbers and 
without. In the former instance, you’d better 
know your math, whereas in the latter, 
you’ve got to be really effective at molding 
your station to suit the desires of the indi-
vidual advertiser. Without the numbers to 
speak for you, you have to do all the selling 
yourself. Flexibility and ingenuity are the 
keys to the sale.”
Advertising Agencies
Advertising agencies came into existence 
more than a century ago and have played an 
integral role in broadcasting since its incep-
tion. During radio’s famed heyday, adver-
tising agencies were omnipotent. Not only 
did they handle the advertising budgets of 
some of the nation’s largest businesses but 
also they provided the networks with fully 
produced programs. The programs were 
designed by the agencies for the specific 
satisfaction of their clients. If the networks 
and certain independent stations wanted a 
company’s business, they had little choice 
but to air the agency’s program. This prac-
tice in the 1920s and 1930s gave ad agencies 
unprecedented power. At one point, adver-
tising agencies were the biggest supplier of 
network radio programming. By the 1940s, 
agencies were forced to abandon their direct 
programming involvement, and the industry 
was left to its own devices, or almost. Agen-
cies continued to influence the content of 
what was aired. Their presence continues to 
be felt today, but not to the extent that it 
was prior to the advent of television.
Agencies annually account for hundreds 
of millions in radio ad dollars. The long, 
and at times turbulent, marriage of radio 
and advertising agencies was, and contin-
ues to be, based on the need of national 
companies to convey their messages on 
the local level and the need of the local 
broadcaster for national business. It is a 
two-way street.
Today, hundreds of advertising ­agencies 
use the radio medium. They range in size 
from mammoth to minute. Agencies such 
as Young and Rubicam, J. Walter Thompson, 
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Leo Burnett 
bill in the hundreds of millions annually and 
employ hundreds. More typical, however, 
are the agencies scattered throughout the 
country that bill between one-half and 
two-and-a-half million dollars each year 
and employ anywhere from a half dozen to 
20 people. Agencies come in all shapes and 
sizes and provide various services, depend-
ing on their scope and dimensions.
The process of getting national busi-
ness onto a local station is an involved one. 
The major agencies must compete against 
dozens of others to win the right to handle 
the advertising of large companies. This 
usually involves elaborate presentations and 
substantial investments by agencies. When 
and if the account is secured, the agency 
must then prepare the materials – audio, 
video, print – for the campaign and see to 
it that the advertiser’s money is spent in the 
most effective way possible. Little is done 
without extensive marketing research and 
planning. The agency’s media buyer over-
sees the placement of dollars in the various 
media. Media buyers at national agencies 
deal with station and network reps rather 
than directly with the stations themselves. It 
would be impossible for an agency placing

Advertising Agencies	
 147

a buy on 400 stations to personally transact 
with each.
There are basically three types of agen-
cies: full-service agencies, which provide 
clients with a complete range of services, 
including research, marketing, and produc-
tion; modular agencies, which provide spe-
cific services to advertisers; and in-house 
agencies, which handle the advertising needs 
of their own business.
The standard commission that an agency 
receives for its service is 15% on billing. For 
example, if an agency places $100,000 on 
radio, it earns $15,000 for its efforts. Agen-
cies often charge clients additional fees to 
cover production costs and some agencies 
receive a retainer from clients.
The business generated by agencies 
­constitutes an important percentage of 
radio’s revenues, especially for medium and 
large market stations. However, compared 
to other media, such as television, radio’s 
allocation is diminutive. The nation’s top 
three agencies invest over 80% of their 
broadcast budgets in television. Nonethe-
less, hundreds of millions of dollars are 
channeled into radio by agencies that rec-
ognize the effectiveness of the medium.
Rep Companies
Rep companies are the industry’s middle-
men (see Figure 4.20). Rep companies 
are given the task of convincing national 
agency media buyers to place money on 
the stations they represent. Without their 
existence, radio stations would have to find 
a way to reach the myriad of agencies on 
their own – an impossible feat.
With few exceptions, radio outlets con-
tract the services of a station rep company. 
Even the smallest station wants to be 
included in buys at the national level. The 
rep company basically is an extension of 
FIGURE 4.20

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

a station’s sales department. The rep and 
the station’s sales manager work together 
closely. Information about a station and its 
market are crucial to the rep. The burden 
of keeping the rep fully aware of what is 
happening back at the station rests on the 
sales manager’s shoulders. Because a rep 
company based in New York or Chicago 
would have no way of knowing that its 
client station in Arkansas has decided to 
carry the local college’s basketball games, 
it is the station’s responsibility to make 
the information available. A rep cannot sell 
what it does not know exists. Of course, a 
good rep will keep in contact with a station 
on a regular basis simply to keep up on 
station changes.
There are far fewer radio station reps than 
ad agencies, and with the clustering of sta-
tions by radio corporations, the number of

rep ­companies has dwindled ­dramatically 
as broadcasters assume the burden of 
­representing themselves. Today, there are just 
a handful of major rep companies handling 
the 9000-plus commercial stations around 
the country because the huge radio compa-
nies assume this function in-house. “In their 
heyday in the 70s, many national and regional 
rep firms served individual stations and group 
radio owners, but because of pressures from 
increased costs, pressure from client sta-
tions on commission rates, and the creation 
of unwired network radio, an attempt to 
compete with the lower rates of traditional 
radio networks that lowered radio rates, many 
were forced to close or merge through the 
80s and 90s. With consolidation, where one, 
two, or three groups now control most radio 
stations in a given market, the need for mul-
tiple reps evaporated,” says Williams.
Rep Companies	
 149

Adds Ed Shane about the decline of rep 
firms, “The demise of Katz changes the 
national selling landscape. With only one firm 
representing radio to national advertisers, 
national business is likely to shrink. National 
Business is largely transactional, and radio 
has allowed national advertisers to abuse the 
rate card or to load up ‘value added’ promo-
tions in order to substantiate rates.”
Major rep firms pitch agencies on behalf 
of hundreds of client stations. The large and 
very successful reps often refuse to act as 
the envoy for small market stations because 
of their lack of earning potential. A rep 
company typically receives a commission 
of between 5 and 12% on the spot buys 
made by agencies, and because the national 
advertising money usually is directed first 
to the medium and large markets, the 
bigger commissions are not to be made 
from handling small market outlets. Many 
rep companies specialize in small market 
stations, however, especially in the age of 
consolidation.
Although a small rep company may work 
for the agencies on behalf of numerous sta-
tions, it will seldom handle two radio outlets 
in the same market. Doing so could result in 
a rep company being placed in the unten-
able position of competing with itself for 
a buy, thus creating an obvious conflict of 
interest. In the past few years, many larger 
rep firms have taken on multiple stations 
in the same market due to the clustering 
approach of their clients.
The majority of station reps provide 
­additional services. In recent years many 
have expanded into the areas of program-
ming and management consultancy, and 
almost all offer clients audience research 
data, as well as aid in developing station 
promotions and designing sales materials 
such as rate cards.
Web Site, Podcast, and HD2 
Selling
Web sites, new HD2 channels, and pod-
casts have become additional sources of 
revenue at many stations. Until recently 
station Web sites were perceived as an 
extension of the promotion department 
more than a means for generating income. 
Some ­stations entice clients to purchase 
spot plans by comping them Web site 
ads. Web site presence is another way to 
add value to traditional commercial buys. 
This is also true for station podcasts. 
Contends Jason Insalaco, “Radio account 
executives can benefit from this source by 
selling additional exposure to advertisers. 
Another thing to keep in mind is that pod-
casting and streaming allow local clients 
of lesser means who previously could not 
afford a conventional broadcast schedule 
the chance to purchase less ­expensive 
web commercials. Account executives 
can attest to the difficulty of selling the 
intangible (sightless) nature of radio. Web 
­advertising helps overcome this objection. 
Visual banner ads allow streaming listeners 
to click on ads that will take them directly 
to a client’s webpage. Furthermore, radio 
programmers now have access to immedi-
ate data to provide advertisers the number 
of users streaming their station and down-
loading specific podcasts. The current 
Arbitron ratings systems provides audience 
data four weeks later and is arguably arbi-
trary due to sampling inconsistencies and 
often erratic results. However, streaming 
and podcasting is a win-win for program-
mers who strive to retain the fickle listener 
and garner additional income.”
Meanwhile, it is hoped that the new HD 
side-channels (HD2 channels) will provide 
additional revenue streams for stations. 
While the HD movement has been slow to 
launch, expectations indicate that advertiser 
interest in the innovative formats emerging 
(and predicted to emerge) will increase. In 
several major markets, HD2 formats have 
already attracted sponsors seeking a more 
niche clientele.
Nontraditional Revenue
It has been estimated that over $600 million 
in radio revenue comes from co-op adver-
tising – no small piece of change, indeed. 
However, as a consequence of a negative 
economy, the co-op market went a bit flat in 
the first half of the 1990s, says broadcaster 
Peter Drew. “There was less co-op. Things 
150 	
CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

were tight on every level, of course. It was 
more difficult to qualify and collect. It was 
the result of higher accruals and inventory 
requirements. Still, co-op money is worth 
pursuing. A little more effort is required to 
acquire it.” Likewise, due to the teetering 
economy in the late 2000s, co-op opportu-
nities dwindled and account executives had 
to dig deeper to find it.
Co-op advertising involves the coopera-
tion of three parties: the retailer whose 
business is being promoted, the manufac-
turer whose product is being promoted, 
and the medium used for the promotion. 
In other words, a retailer and manufacturer 
get together to share advertising expenses. 
For example, Smith’s Sporting Goods is 
informed by the Converse Running Shoes 
representative that the company will 
match, dollar for dollar up to $5000, the 
money that the retailer invests in radio 
advertising. The only stipulation of the deal 
is that Converse be promoted in the com-
mercials on which the money is spent. This 
means that no competitive product can be

­mentioned. Converse demands exclusivity 
for its contribution.
Manufacturers of practically every con-
ceivable type of product, from lawn mowers 
to mobile homes, establish co-op advertis-
ing budgets. A radio salesperson can use 
co-op to great advantage. First, the station 
account executive must determine the 
extent of co-op subsidy a client is entitled 
to receive. Most of the time the retailer 
knows the answer to this. Frequently, 
however, retailers do not take full advan-
tage of the co-op funds that manufacturers 
make available. In some instances, retailers 
are not aware that a particular manufac-
turer will share radio advertising expenses. 
Many potential advertisers have been moti-
vated to go on the air after discovering the 
existence of co-op dollars. Mid-sized retail-
ers account for the biggest chunk of the 
industry’s co-op revenues. However, even 
the smallest retailer likely is eligible for 
some subsidy, and a salesperson can make 
this fact known for everyone’s mutual 
advantage.

The sales manager generally directs a 
station’s co-op efforts. Large stations often 
employ a full-time co-op specialist. The 
individual responsible for stimulating co-op 
revenue will survey retail trade journals 
for pertinent information about available 
dollars. Retail associations also are a good 
source of information, because they gener-
ally possess manufacturer co-op advertising 
lists. The importance of taking advantage 
of co-op opportunities cannot be over-
stressed. Some stations, especially metro 
market outlets, earn hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in additional ad revenue through 
their co-op efforts.
From the retailer’s perspective, co-op 
advertising is not always a great bargain. 
This usually stems from copy constraints 
imposed by certain manufacturers, which 
give the retailer a 10-second tag-out in a 
30- or 60-second commercial. Obviously, 
this does not please the retailer who has 
split the cost of advertising 50/50. In recent 
years, this type of copy domination by the 
manufacturer has decreased somewhat, and 
a more equitable approach, whereby both 
parties share evenly the exposure and the 
expense, is more commonplace.
Co-op also is appealing to radio stations 
because they do not have to modify their 
billing practices to accommodate the third 
party. Stations simply bill the retailer and 
provide an affidavit attesting to the time 
commercials aired. The retailer, in turn, bills 
the manufacturer for its share of the airtime. 
For its part, the manufacturer requires receipt 
of an affidavit before making payment. In 
certain cases, the station is asked to mail affi-
davits directly to the manufacturer. Some 
manufacturers stipulate that bills be sent to 
audit houses, which inspect the materials 
before authorizing payment.
Event marketing is another key form 
of nontraditional revenue generation. This 
involves the creation of a popular event, 
such as a food or arts festival, wherein mer-
chants pay to be associated with it. This 
has become a very common and successful 
way for stations to make income without 
adding to their on-air spot loads. Says Jay 
Williams, Jr., “Stations are going outside the 
traditional spot load box and engaging in 
different ways to generate income for their 
stations.”
Trade-Outs
Stations commonly exchange airtime for 
goods, although top-rated outlets, whose 
time is sold at a premium, are less likely 
to swap spots for anything other than cash. 
Rather than pay for needed items, such 
as office supplies and furnishings, studio 
equipment, meals for clients and listeners, 
new cars, and so forth, a station may choose 
to strike a deal with merchants in which 
airtime is traded for merchandise. There are 
advertisers who use radio only on a trade 
basis. A station may start out in an exclu-
sively trade relationship with a client in the 
hope of eventually converting him to cash. 
Split contracts also are written when a client 
agrees to provide both money and merchan-
dise. For example, WXXX-FM needs two 
new office desks. The total cost of the desks 
is $800. An agreement is made whereby the 
client receives a $1400 ROS spot sched-
ule and $600 cash in exchange for the 
desks. Trade-outs are not always this equi-
table. Stations often provide trade clients 
with airtime worth two or three times the 
­merchandise value to get what is needed. 
Thus, the saying “need inspires deals.”
Many sales managers also feel that it 
makes good business sense to write radio 
trade contracts to fill available and unsold 
airtime, rather than let it pass unused. Once 
airtime is gone, it cannot be retrieved, and 
yesterday’s unfilled availability is a lost 
opportunity.

1.  At the close of the first decade of the new 
millennium, radio advertising was down sub-
stantially. Yet, selling commercials still keeps 
most radio stations on the air. Between 1920 
and today, advertising revenues and forms 
reflected the ebb and flow of radio’s popu-
larity. Today, advertising dollars are selec-
tively spent on spots aired during times of 
the day and on stations that attract the type 
of audience the advertiser wants to reach.
2.  An effective radio commercial makes a 
strong and lasting impression on the mind 
of the listener.
3.  A successful account executive needs an 
understanding of research methods, market-
ing, finance; some form of sales experience; 
and such personal traits as ambition, confi-
dence, honesty, energy, determination, intel-
ligence, and good grooming.
4.  Since the 1970s, programming people 
have made successful job transitions to sales 
because they have a practical understanding 
of the product they are selling.
5.  Although an increasing number of station 
managers are being drawn from programming 
people, a sales background is still preferred.
6.  The sales manager, who reports directly 
to the station or cluster’s general manager, 
oversees the account executives, establishes 
departmental policies, develops sales plans 
and materials, conceives campaigns and pro-
motions, sets quotas, works closely with the 
program director (PD) to develop salable 
features, and sometimes sells.
7.  Rates for selling airtime vary according to 
listenership and are published on the station’s 
rate card. The card lists terms of payment and 
commission, nature of copy and due dates, 
station’s approach to discounting, rate pro-
tection policy, feature, and spot rates. Rate 
cards are beginning to fade from the scene as 
new approaches to selling airtime evolve.
8.  Station listenership varies according to 
time of day, so rate card daypart classifica-
tions range from the highest costing AAA 
(typically 6–10 a.m. weekdays) to C (usually 
midnight–6 a.m.). Fixed-position drive time 
spots are usually among the most expensive 
to purchase.
9.  Computerized rate cards allow rates to be 
quickly adjusted while using a grid structure 
allows for considerable rate flexibility. Grids 
are inventory sensitive and they let a station 
remain viable when business is slow.
10.  For advertisers with limited funds, ROS, 
BTA, or TAP are cost-effective alternatives.
11.  Because few accounts are closed on the 
first call, it is used to introduce the station 
to the client and to determine its needs. Fol-
low-up calls are made to offset reservations 
and, if necessary, to improve the proposal. 
Perseverance is essential.
12.  Radio sales are drawn from three levels: 
retail, local, and national. Retail sales are

CHAPTER 4 Sales﻿

direct sales to advertisers within the sta-
tion’s signal area. Local sales are obtained 
from advertising agencies representing busi-
nesses in the market area. National sales are 
obtained by the station’s rep company from 
agencies representing national accounts.
13.  A fully produced sample commercial 
(spec spot) is an effective selling tool. It is 
used to break down client resistance on call-
backs, to interest former clients who have 
not bought time recently, and to encourage 
clients to increase their schedules.
14.  The salesperson should commit the adver-
tiser to sufficient commercials, placed prop-
erly, to ensure that the advertiser achieves 
his or her objectives. Underselling is as self-
defeating as overselling.
15.  New accounts are added to a salesper-
son’s list by “prospecting” searching newspa-
pers, Yellow Pages, television ads, competing 
radio station ads, and new store openings. 
Only open accounts may be added (those 
not already declared by another salesperson 
at the same station).
16.  Because a salesperson must average 15–20 
in-person calls each day, when preparing a 
daily call sheet it is important to logically 
sequence and centralize the businesses to be 
contacted. Also, advance telephone contacts 
can eliminate much wasted time.
17.  Station Web sites, new HD2 channels, 
and podcasts are additional opportunities 
for revenue at stations. The Internet and 
e-mail are useful sales and prospecting tools 
for account executives.
18.  A salesperson at a station with a high 
rating has a decided advantage when con-
tacting advertisers. Stations with low or no 
numbers must focus on retail sales (work the 
street), developing programs and program-
ming to attract targeted clients. Stations in 
nonsurvey areas must rely on their image of 
good citizenship and strong community ties.
19.  Ad agencies annually supply hundreds 
of millions of dollars in advertising revenue 
to stations with good ratings. Media buyers 
at the agencies deal directly with station 
and network reps.
20.  A station’s rep company must convince 
national agency media buyers to select their 
station as their advertising outlet for the 
area. Therefore, the station’s sales manager 
and the rep must work together closely.
21.  Among NTR sources are co-op advertis-
ing, which involves the sharing of advertis-
ing expenses by the retailer of the business 
being promoted and the manufacturer of 
the product being promoted, and events 
marketing, wherein stations create events in 
which merchants invest their promotional 
dollars.
22.  Rather than pay for needed items or to 
obtain something of value for unsold time, 
a station may trade (trade-out) advertising 
airtime with a merchant in exchange for 
specific merchandise.

Appendix: A Station Owner Conveys His Sales  
Philosophy to His Manager
To: Rich Krezwick
Fr: Jay Williams, Jr.
Re: sales
Although I am not familiar with what happens 
every day, I do think I have a general idea of the 
sales philosophy and structure that has gotten us 
where we are, both positively and negatively. As I 
see the declining sales as a percentage of goal in a 
marketplace that is hotter now than at any time 
in the past 4 years, I think it’s time we continue 
our discussion on a more specific level. To that 
end, I thought I would outline what I see from 
here (to see where you agree/disagree or can 
supply additional information) and suggest some 
solutions (as I have certainly seen similar trends 
many times before). First my suggestions:
1.  Let’s get Casey out of the station for a few 
days (your suggestion, actually). I think he needs 
some perspective, and there’s nothing like seeing 
another problem to see your own better.
2.  Let’s give Casey a sales call quota. 
Sales managers learn both real problems (not 
­self-­manufactured) on the street, and they learn 
­solutions. More importantly, they’re on the front 
lines with their sales people and can better relate 
to them and teach them. He needs to be more of 
a player-coach. Perhaps, a minimum of 20 calls 
a week.
3.  Let’s do real meetings that teach the “con-
sultant sell.” This, in my opinion, is the ­philosophy 
that has always been missing (in the past year 
or so) that (a) makes us look as if we don’t 
care about the client’s problems and (b) puts 
downward pressure on rates. The ­consultant sell, 
which I do every day for DMR and ­frequently 
for WLKZ, talks about clients’ needs and revolves 
around solutions. I never, as a result, and I do 
mean never, get into a rate ­discussion. Conversely, 
WXLO is now selling spots and inventory. We’re 
like a beer distributor, competing against other 
beers. It’s totally the wrong way to sell.
4.  Let’s figure out a way to hire someone to 
really handle vendor, interactive phones, and other 
nonspot revenues that you and I both know can be 
sold at a premium instead of the despicable “value 
added.” Perhaps, you should be the sales manager 
of this special sales branch, starting with one or 
two people. The two-check philosophy in action. 
Get us in the direction you and I have talked 
about – as a marketing group instead of spot sales 
people (or really, spot whores as I see it).
5.  Let’s put a stop to any sales criticism of 
programming, even if it’s warranted. At Fairbanks 
broadcasting, I learned how little criticisms can 
become a culture if unchecked. In reality, they 
are more than critiquing the product they must 
turn around and sell, they (sales people) are 
giving themselves an excuse for poor sales, low 
rates, and giveaways to clients. I was brought up 
with the philosophy that only the best could sell 
for station XXXX; if you can’t, get the hell out 
of the way and we’ll hire someone who can. It 
changed the paradigm – and the success of the 
stations I worked with.
6.  Let’s hire at least one more, maybe 
two more, sales people and specifically target 
­Metrowest and southern New Hampshire. I know 
people like Peter’s Auto Sales in Nashua, and 
other major advertisers, that need business from 
south and west of Nashua. We can help, but we 
don’t have the horses to develop that business. 
With not enough sales people competing for the 
available spots, it also lessens demand and that, 
in WXLO’s “beer distributor” mentality, lowers 
rates.
As we’ve talked about much of this, I’m sure you 
will agree with much of it, but I think we must 
now act quickly. Fourth-quarter buys and rates 
are being set; too much later and the die will 
be cast and we won’t be hitting the cash flow 
numbers you want and the station needs. I offer 
these as my first steps to change the structure. 
(I’m referring to a $4000/person seminar taught 
by a consultant to the Motorola management 
last week. In shorthand, most manage events. 
Some manage the patterns caused by the 
events, yet these both yield poor results as they 
are reactions to past events. Smart managers 
manage structure.) Our structure, and the 
philosophy you generated and that I generated 
in programming, is being changed in sales. This 
change in structure (because of the coterminous 
change in philosophy) is changing our patterns 
(sales curves) and events (individual sales, rates, 
complaints, bonuses to clients, low-rate packages, 
etc.). That’s why I have proposed these solutions 
versus mere package or rate changes, etc. Let me 
know what you think.

was left to its own resources. The networks 
put forth substantial efforts to gather news 
and did very well without the wire ser-
vices on which they had come to rely. Late 
in 1934, United Press (UP), International 
News Service (INS), and Associated Press 
(AP) agreed to sell their news services to 
radio, thus ending the boycott. However, 
by then the medium had demonstrated its 
ability to fend for itself.
Radio has served as a vital source of 
news and information throughout the 
most ­significant historical events. When the 
nation was gripped by economic turmoil 
in the 1930s, the incumbent head-of-state, 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, demonstrated the 
tremendous reach of the medium by using 
it to address the people. The majority of 
Americans heard and responded to the 
president’s talks.
Radio’s status as a news source reached 
its apex during World War II. On-the-spot 
reports and interviews, as well as commen-
taries, brought the war into the nation’s 
living rooms. In contrast to World War I, 
when the fledgling wireless was exclusively 
used for military purposes, during World War 
II, radio served as the primary link between 
those at home and the foreign ­battlefronts 
around the globe. News programming 
during this troubled period matured while 
the public adjusted its perception of the 
medium, casting it in a more austere light. 
Radio journalism became a more credible 
profession.
The effects of television on radio news 
were wide ranging. While the medium in 
general reeled from the blow dealt it by 
the enfant terrible, in the late 1940s and 
News 5
News from the Start
Due in great part to industry consolidation 
and the ever-increasing availability of new 
media, such as the Web, iPhones, Blackber-
ries, etc., broadcast radio news has witnessed 
a decline in audience size as well as the 
size of station news departments. Notes Ed 
Shane, “The diminishing number of news 
people and news broadcasts is alarming.” 
It was not always that way. Indeed, the 
medium of radio was used to convey news 
before news of the medium had reached 
the majority of the general public. Ironi-
cally, it was the sinking of the Titanic in 
1912 and the subsequent rebroadcast of the 
ship’s coded distress message that helped 
launch a wider awareness and appreciation 
of the newfangled gadget called the wireless 
telegraph. It was not until the early 1920s, 
when the “wireless” had become known as 
the “radio” that broadcast journalism actu-
ally began to evolve.
A historical benchmark in radio news is 
the broadcast of the Harding–Cox election 
results in 1920 by stations WWJ in Detroit 
and KDKA in Pittsburgh, although the first 
actual newscast is reported to have occurred 
in California a decade earlier. Despite these 
early ventures, news programming pro-
gressed slowly until the late 1920s. By then, 
two networks, NBC and CBS, were provid-
ing national audiences with certain news 
and information features.
Until 1932, radio depended on newspa-
pers for its stories. That year, newspapers 
officially perceived the electronic medium 
as a competitive threat. Fearing a decline in 
readership, they imposed a blackout. Radio

of President Kennedy, and the subsequent 
shootings of Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
Senator Robert Kennedy over radio. In 1965 
when most of the northeast was crippled by 
a power blackout, battery-powered radios 
literally became a lifeline for millions of 
people by providing continuous news and 
information until power was restored.
During the 1970s through the 1990s, 
news on both the world and local levels 
reached radio listeners first. Today, despite 
the Internet and 24-hour cable news net-
works, the public still knows that radio 
delivers the news instantly and as it happens 
about occurrences at home and halfway 
around the world.
News and Today’s Radio
More people claim to listen to radio for 
music than for any other reason, although 
studies are showing that it is changing due 
to a growing reliance on other audio media 
sources. Somewhat surprising, however, is 
early 1950s, news programming under-
went a sort of metamorphosis. Faced 
with drastically reduced network sched-
ules, radio stations began to localize their 
news efforts. Attention was focused on 
area news events rather than national 
and international. Stations that had relied 
almost exclusively on network news began  
to hire news people and broadcast a regular 
schedule of local newscasts. By the mid-
1950s, the transformation was nearly com-
plete, and radio news had become a local 
programming matter. Radio news had 
undergone a 180-degree turn, even before 
the medium gave up trying to directly 
compete on a program-for-program basis 
with television. By the time radio set a 
new and revivifying course for itself by 
programming for specific segments of the 
listening audience, local newscasts were 
the norm.
Since its period of reconstruction in the 
1950s, radio has proven time and time again 
to be the nation’s first source of information 
about major news events. The majority of 
Americans first heard of the assassination

that many of these same people admit to 
relying on the medium for the news they 
receive. Recent studies have found that 
although most of those surveyed tuned in 
to radio for entertainment, three-quarters 
considered news and information pro-
gramming important. These surveys also 
ascertained that radio is the first morning 
news source for two-thirds of all full-time 
working women.
According to Arbitron, 60% of the News/
Talk/Information audience are men of age 
18 and over while the balance are women in 
the same age range. Most of these listeners 
get their first news of the day from radio. 
In comparison, only 16% of adults rely on 
newspapers as the first source of daily news. 
Practically, all the nation’s 9000 commercial 
stations program news to some extent, and 
there are over 2000 stations that specialize 
in news programming. Radio’s tremendous 
mobility and pervasiveness have made it an 
instant and reliable news source for millions 
of Americans.
Despite all of this, however, consultant 
Ed Shane argues that “Radio news is in a 
sad state.” The deregulation of the medium 
since the 1980s has inspired a decline in 
local radio news service, according to many 
sources. “Listen to the news on many local 
stations and you’re hearing announcers from 
Metro Network’s MetroSource, a linkup of 
Metro’s local traffic services into a combina-
tion newswire and network. Because Metro 
has operations in 81 markets, covering 2000 
radio and TV stations, the system creates a 
formidable presence. To its credit, Metro 
covers news pretty well. Presentation is not 
its forte. Outsourcing one of radio’s essential 
services is a cost-cutting measure, and does 
not enhance quality. After the devastating 
Oklahoma City tornadoes in May 1999, the 
National Association of Broadcasters placed 
an ad in USA Today and other publications 
congratulating ‘local broadcasters’ for their 
fine job of informing the public about the 
impending storms and then covering the 
damage that ensued. Most of the quotations 
in the ad were from TV stations or about 
TV stations. Radio complained, of course, 
but a local official was quoted as saying 
‘radio just simulcasts TV audio.’”
Says WBZ GM (General Manager) Ted 
Jordan, “In one sense we suffered from the 
same market compression as everyone else. 
But in other ways, it’s easier today as there

What remains to be seen (heard) 
is how close the “actual” can come 
to the “theoretical.” Theoretically, and 
logically, what would continue to value 
local radio stations to listeners and dif-
ferentiate AM/FM broadcasters from 
iTunes, satellite radio, and the plethora 
on Internet-related content now becom-
ing every-bit-as-portable via iPhone, 
WiMax, etc. is local content. But as 
a practical matter, debt now prohibits 
most radio station owners from deliver-
ing such content. Sadly, radio’s biggest 
owners treated stations like real estate. 
And like real estate, stations now  
go-begging for buyers. Clearly, the 
theoretical fix would be uber-well-heeled  
buyers spotting the opportunity of a  
lifetime: radio’s gazillion in-place 
­receivers and the pre-existing listener 
habit of the demographic, which con-
trols most wealth and, as a generation, 
is in the process of inheriting their par-
ent’s wealth. Baby Boomer’s children 
are already radio’s lost generation. But 
the real-life Homer and Marge Simpson 
characters, mega-consumers who fuel 
the U.S. economy, would be retrieved 
and maintained if stations offered 
programming more compelling than 
FM’s race to go Al Christmas first and 
AM’s self-imposed typecasting as “Not 
from your city/you’re wrong, I’m right/
bad Republicans.” Whether Bill Gates 
or other as-wealthy folk will seize this 
opportunity remains to be seen.

was more AM competition. All things con-
sidered, the news quality is as good, but 
now the systems in place are better, the net-
works we use (ABC & CBS) are better and 
more responsive, and the stringers are better. 
We used to have our own Washington, DC, 
bureau because we didn’t trust the networks 
to deliver the story. Now we can. They have 
really become responsive to the needs of the 
local stations. There is now a greater sharing 
of resources at our operations. We have a 
dotted line relationship with WBZ TV. Their 
news people give updates on our air and our 
anchors appear on television. We are able to 
co-brand the stations and get a larger share 
of mind.”
Adds Jay Williams, “They have been 
able to cut costs by reallocating resources, 
working with their TV affiliate, using better 
systems, working more closely with the net-
works, and the like. As to the talk that there 
are fewer real news sources today, I know 
Ted believes that not to be the case. Just the 
opposite, in fact.”
The Newsroom
The number of individuals working in a 
radio station newsroom will vary depend-
ing on the size of a station, whether it is 
part of a cluster operation or a single outlet, 
and its format. On the average, a station in a 
small market employs one or two full-time 
news people. Of course, some outlets find it 
financially unfeasible to hire news people. 
These stations do not necessarily ignore 
news rather they delegate responsibilities 
to their deejays to deliver brief newscasts at 
specified times, often at the top of the hour. 
Stations approaching news in this manner 
make it necessary for the on-air person to 
collect news from the wire service during 
record cuts and broadcast it nearly verbatim –  
a practice known as “rip ‘n’ read.” Little, 
if any, rewrite is done because the deejay 
simply does not have the time to do it. 
The only thing that persons at “rip ‘n’ read” 
outlets can and must do is examine wire 
copy before going on the air. This elimi-
nates the likelihood of mistakes. Again, all 
this is accomplished while the records are 
spinning.
NPR reporter Corey Flintoff warns against 
neglecting to examine wire copy before air­
time. “We’ve all been caught with stuff that 
appears to scan at first sight but turns out to 
be incomprehensible when you read it.”
Music-oriented stations in larger markets 
rarely allow their deejays to do news. Occa-
sionally, the person jockeying the overnight 
shift will be expected to give a brief news-
cast every hour or two, but in metro markets, 
this is fairly uncommon. There is generally 
a newsperson on duty around the clock.  
A top-rated station in a medium market 
typically employs four full-time news 
people; again, this varies depending on the 
status of the outlet (one of a cluster of sta-
tions) and the type of programming it airs. 
For example, Easy Listening stations that 
stress music and de-emphasize talk may 
employ only one or two news people. Mean-
while, an AC station in the same market 
may have five people as its news staff in 
an attempt to promote itself as a heavy 
news and information outlet, even though 
its primary product is music. Certain music 
stations in major markets hire as many as 
a dozen news employees. This figure may 
include not only on-air newscasters but 
also writers, street reporters, and technical 
people as well. Stringers and interns also 
swell the figure.
During the prime listening periods when 
a station’s audience is at its maximum, 
newscasts are programmed with greater fre-
quency, sometimes twice as often as during 
other dayparts. The newsroom is a hub of 
FIGURE 5.3

activity as news people prepare for news-
casts scheduled every 20–30 minutes. Half 
a dozen people may be involved in assem-
bling news but only two may actually enter 
the broadcast booth. A primetime newscast 
schedule may look something like this:
Drive Coverage, a.m.

Midday and evening are far less frenetic 
in the newsroom, and one person per shift 
may be considered sufficient.
A standard-size newsroom in a medium 
market will contain several pieces of audio 
equipment, not to mention office furniture 
such as desks, computers, typewriters, file 
cabinets, and so on. Reel-to-reel record-
ers and cassette and cartridge machines 
are important tools for the newsperson. 
The newsroom also will be equipped with 
various monitors to keep news people on 
top of what is happening at the local police 
and fire departments and weather bureau. 
Various wire service machines provide 
the latest news, sports, stock, and weather 
information, as well as a host of other data. 
Depending on the station’s budget, two or 
more news services may be used. Stations 
with a genuine commitment to news create 
work areas that are designed for maximum 
efficiency and productivity.
In situations where newsrooms have been 
combined and consolidated, more person-
nel, equipment, and space may be in evi-
dence since the plant itself may be serving 
myriad signals. Cluster operation newsrooms 
accommodate reporters and news readers 
assigned to the various stations under the 
one roof.
News in Satellite Radio originates from a 
host of outside sources. Both Satellite ser-
vices (XM and Sirius) provide feeds (chan-
nels) from ABC, NBN, CBS, CNN, Fox, 
ESPN, NPR, BBC, and so forth. Satellite 
radio is not in the business of generating 
news itself, so the “newsroom” (as we have 
been referring to it) does not exist, although 
this may change in the future.
The All-News Station
Stations devoted entirely to news program-
ming arrived on the scene in the mid-1960s. 
Program innovator Gordon McLendon, 
who had been a key figure in the devel-
opment of two music formats, Beautiful 
Music and Top 40, implemented All-News 
at WNUS-AM (NEWS) in Chicago. In 
1965, Group W, Westinghouse Broadcast-
ing, changed WINS-AM in New York to 
All-News and soon did the same at more of 
its metro outlets: KYW-AM, Philadelphia, 
and KFWB-AM, Los Angeles. While Group 
W was converting several of its outlets to 
nonmusic programming, CBS decided that 
All-News was the way to go at WCBS-AM, 
New York; KCBS-AM, San Francisco; and 
KNX-AM, Los Angeles.
Not long after KCBS in San Francisco 
began its All-News programming, another 
Bay City station, KGO-AM, introduced the 
hybrid News/Talk format in which news 
shares the microphone with conversation 
and interview features. Over the years, the 
hybrid approach has caught on and leads 
the pure All-News format in popularity.
Because of the exorbitant cost of running 
a news-only operation, it has remained pri-
marily a metro market endeavor. It often 
costs several times as much to run an effec-
tive All-News station as it does to run one 
broadcasting music. This usually keeps small-
market outlets out of the business. Staff 
size in All-News stations far exceeds that 
of formats that primarily serve up music. 
Although a lone deejay is needed at an Adult 
Contemporary or Top 40 station, All-News 
requires the involvement of several people 
to keep the air sound credible.
Even though the cost of running a news 
station is high, the payback can more than 
justify expenditures. However, this is one 
format that requires a sizable initial invest-
ment, as well as the financial wherewithal 
and patience to last until it becomes an 
established and viable entity. Considerable 
planning takes place before a station decides 
to convert to All-News, since it is not simply

media observers predict that All-News will 
make inroads into FM as that band gives 
over large segments of its music audience to 
Internet downloading.
The Electronic Newsroom
The use of computers and online resources in 
the radio newsroom has increased to where 
they are now the norm since being intro-
duced in December 1980 at KCBS in San 
Francisco. Computers linked to the various 
wire and Internet information services are 
used to access primary and background data 
on fast-breaking stories and features. Many 
stations have installed video display termi-
nals (VDTs) in on-air studios. Instead of 
handheld copy, newscasters simply broad-
cast off the screens. Desktop computers 
a matter of hiring new jocks and updating 
the music library. Switching from a music 
format to All-News is dramatic and any-
thing but cosmetic.
AM has always been the home of the 
All-News station. There are only a handful 
of FM news and information outlets. The 
format’s prevalence on AM has grown con-
siderably since the late 1970s when FM 
took the lead in listeners. The percentage 
of All-News and News/Talk formats on 
AM continued to increase in the 1980s as 
the band lost more and more of its music 
listeners to FM. However, All-News sta-
tions in a handful of metro markets keep 
AM at the top of the ratings charts. In the 
early 1990s, it was common to find one 
AM outlet among the leaders, and almost 
invariably it programmed nonmusic. This 
has changed little in the mid-2000s. Some

has revolutionized newsgathering. Says 
broadcaster and academic Larry Miller, 
“The evolution has been from old-fashioned 
teletype ‘wire’ by landlines, to satellites, to 
computers and the Internet. Even audio is 
accessed online.”
According to broadcast scholar David 
Reese, “Today, newsrooms use station Web 
sites to deliver news, and recent studies 
indicate that acquiring information this 
way is growing in popularity. Adds Jason 
Insalaco, “The listener is no longer going to 
remain captive to a news station to learn 
the day’s headlines. An added plus is that 
many station websites offer live information 
on traffic flow and so forth. Station websites 
give outlets needed additional cache in the 
multimedia environment.”
Other technology has contributed greatly 
to the efficiency and performance of the 
electronic newsroom. For instance, in recent 
years, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital 
Network) has significantly improved the 
quality of phone interviews. With ISDN, 
technology newsrooms can create seamless 
reports (in terms of audio fidelity), thus cre-
ating the impression (or illusion) that all the 
voices on the air come from the same studio 
and even from the same microphone.
have replaced typewriters in the newsrooms 
at larger stations as well as at the smaller 
stations since the 1990s. The speed and 
agility with which copy can be produced 
and edited makes a computer the perfect 
tool for broadcast journalists.
In 
1986, 
Boston 
All-News 
station 
WEEI-AM installed Media Touch’s Touch-
stone system, thus converting their entire 
operation to computer. News people access 
and store data and even activate equipment 
simply by touching a computer screen.
Computers have become the norm even 
in nonmetro market outlets. “There’s not 
much resistance remaining against comput-
ers in the newsroom, especially, since the 
advent of cheaper PCs and the improve-
ment of programs like Newspro, which is 
the system we use here at NPR. It allows 
us to access and manipulate about a half-
dozen wire services. We can split screen and 
write stories while searching the wires and 
so on. There are many more sophisticated 
systems too. Systems like D-CART incor-
porate digital audio right onto the screen,” 
comments Cory Flintoff.
Furthermore, some companies provide 
specifically tailored software for news-
rooms. “There are computer software pack-
ages these days that a newsroom can buy. 
In my day we used the old file and cards 
and rolodex, but today newsrooms that can 
afford it use software to file stories, keep 
archives of copy, record and play actualities, 
and so forth.” says radio consultant Donna 
Halper.
Producer Ty Ford observes, “Computers 
are an integral part of radio newsrooms with 
auto-download of wire copy to word pro-
cessing terminals, as well as search-by-word 
or topic search, auto-word count and digital 
archiving of sound bites with a computer 
database for retrieval. To put it in the con-
temporary lexicon, radio news is ‘online.’”
More and more newsrooms use the 
Internet and e-mail. It make sense that 
the information highway be accessed by 
a medium determined to keep its listen-
ing public informed and up-to-date. The 
Internet has become the best resource for 
information on every conceivable topic. As 
a search medium, there is none better. Data 
of each variety are at the fingertips of all 
news people today. The world of cyberspace

“Because I’m the only newsperson on duty, 
I have to spend a lot of time verifying facts 
on the phone and recording actualities. I 
don’t have the luxury of assigning that work 
to someone else, but it has to be done.”
Larry Jewett perceives his responsibilities 
similarly. “First and foremost, the news direc-
tor’s job is to keep the listener informed of 
what is happening in the world around him. 
A newsperson is a gatherer and conveyor of 
information. News is a serious business. A 
jock can be wacky and outrageous on the air 
and be a great success. On the other hand, a 
newsperson must communicate credibility 
or find another occupation.”
Gathering local news is the most time-
consuming task facing a radio news director, 
according to news director Cecilia Mason. 
“To do the job well you have to keep moving. 
All kinds of meetings – ­governmental, civic, 
business – have to be covered if you intend 
being a primary source of local news. A 
station with a news commitment must have 
the resources to be where the stories are, 
too. A news director has to be a logisti-
cal engineer at times. You have to be good 
at prioritizing and making the most out of 
what you have at hand. All too often, there 
are just too many events unfolding for a 
news department to effectively cover, so 
you call the shots the best way that you 
can. If you know your business, your best 
shot is usually more than adequate.”
In addition to the gathering and reporting 
of news, public affairs programming often 
is the responsibility of the news director. 
This generally includes the planning and 
preparation of local information features, 
such as interviews, debates, and even docu-
mentaries. Ultimately, the news director’s 
primary goal is to assure the credibility of 
the station’s news operation. For the well-
schooled and conscientious news director, 
this means avoiding advocacy and empha-
sizing objectivity. Says media scholar Indra 
de Silva, “So much of broadcast news today 
is opinion and commentary – infotainment 
– rather than dispassionate and unbiased 
reporting. That is a corruption of the long-
held ideal that news should be fair and bal-
anced. Editorializing a newscast essentially 
misleads the audience, which ultimately 
is a violation of the broadcaster’s public 
trustee role.”
The News Director
News directors, like other department heads, 
are responsible for developing and imple-
menting policies pertaining to their area, 
supervising staff members, and handling 
budgetary concerns. These are basic to any 
managerial position. However, the news 
department poses its own unique challenges 
to the individual who oversees its operation. 
These challenges must be met with a consid-
erable degree of skill and know-how. Educa-
tion and training are important. Surveys have 
concluded that station managers look for 
college degrees when hiring news directors. 
In addition, most news directors have, on the 
average, five years of experience in radio news 
before advancement to the managerial level.
The news director and program director 
(PD) work together closely. At most sta-
tions, the PD has authority over the news 
department, since everything going over the 
air or affecting the air product is his or 
her direct concern and responsibility. Any 
changes in the format of the news or in 
the scheduling of newscasts or newscasters 
may, in fact, have to be approved by the 
station’s programmer. For example, if the 
PD is opposed to the news director’s plans 
to include two or more recorded reports 
(actualities) per newscast, he may withhold 
approval. Although the news director may 
feel that the reports enhance the newscasts, 
the PD may argue that they create conges-
tion and clutter. In terms of establishing the 
on-air news schedule, the PD works with 
the news director to ensure that the sound 
of a given newsperson is suitably matched 
with the time slot he or she is assigned.
Getting the news out rapidly and accu-
rately is a top priority of the news director. 
“People tune radio news to find out what is 
happening right now. That’s what makes the 
medium such a key source for most people. 
While it is important to get news on the 
air as fast as possible, it is more important 
that the stories broadcast be factual and 
correct. You can’t sacrifice accuracy for the 
sake of speed. As a radio news director, my 
first responsibility is to inform our audience 
about breaking events on the local level. 
That’s what our listeners want to hear,” says 
Judy Smith, who functions as a one-­person 
newsroom at the San Antonio station. 
166	
CHAPTER 5 News

What Makes a Newsperson?
College training is an important criterion 
to the radio news director planning to hire 
personnel. It is not impossible to land a 
news job without a degree, but formal 
education is a definite asset. An individual 
planning to enter the radio news profession 
should consider pursuing a broadcasting, 
journalism, or liberal arts degree. Courses 
in political science, history, economics, and 
literature give the aspiring newsperson the 
kind of well-rounded background that is 
most useful. “Coming into this shrinking 
field today, a college degree is an attrac-
tive, if not essential, credential. There’s 
so much that a newsperson has to know. 
I think an education makes the kind of 
difference you can hear, and that’s what 
our business is about. It’s a fact that most 
people are more cognizant of the world 
and write better after attending college. 
Credibility is crucial in this business, and 
college training provides some of that. A 
degree is something that I would look for 
in prospective news people,” says Cecilia 
Mason.
Even though education ranks high, 
most news directors still look for expe-
rience first. “As far as I’m concerned, 
experience counts the most. I’m not sug-
gesting that education isn’t important. It 
is. Most news directors want the person 
that they are hiring to have a college back-
ground, but experience impresses them 
more. I believe a person should have a 
good understanding of the basics before 
attempting to make a living at something. 
Whereas a college education is useful, a 
person should not lean back and point to 
a degree. Mine hasn’t gotten me a job yet, 
though I wouldn’t trade it for the world,” 
notes Jewett. Newsman Smith agrees that 
“The first thing I think most news direc-
tors really look for is experience. Although 
I have a bachelor of arts degree myself, 
I wouldn’t hold out for a person with a 
college diploma. I think if it came down 
to hiring a person with a degree versus 
someone with solid experience, I’d go for 
the latter.”
Gaining news experience can be some-
what difficult in the age of downsizing 
and consolidation, at least more so than 
FIGURE 5.6

newsrooms are 
becoming scarce 
as the result of 
deregulation and 
consolidation.
acquiring deejay experience, which itself 
is more of a challenge today than it was 
a decade ago. Small stations, where the 
beginner is most likely to break into the 
business, have slots for several deejays 
but seldom more than one for a newsper-
son. It becomes even more problematic 
when employers at small stations want 
the one person that they hire for news to 
bring some experience to the job. Larger 
stations place even greater emphasis on 
experience. Thus, the aspiring newsperson 
is faced with a sort of Catch 22 situation, 
in which a job cannot be acquired without 
experience and experience cannot be 
acquired without a job.
News director Frank Titus says that there  
are ways of gaining experience that will 
lead to a news job. “Working in news at 
high school and college stations is very 
valid experience. That’s how Dan Rather 
and a hundred other newsmen got started. 
Also working as an intern at a commer-
cial radio station fattens out the resume. 
If someone comes to me with this kind of 
background and a strong desire to do news, 
I’m interested.”
Among the personal qualities that most 
appeal to news directors are enthusiasm, 
assertiveness, energy, and inquisitiveness. “I 
want someone with a strong news sense and 
unflagging desire to get a story and get it 
right. A person either wants to do news or 
doesn’t. Someone with a pedestrian interest 
What Makes a Newsperson?	
167

An individual who is knowledgeable 
about the area in which a station is located 
has a major advantage over those who are 
not, says Whitman. “A newsperson has to 
know the town or city inside out. I’d advise 
anybody about to be interviewed for a news 
position to find out as much as possible 
about the station’s coverage area. Read back 
issues of newspapers, get socioeconomic  
stats from the library or chamber of com-
merce, and study street directories and 
maps of the town or city in which the 
station is located. Go into the job interview 
well informed, and you’ll make a strong 
impression.”
Unlike a print journalist, a radio newsper-
son also must be a performer. In addition to 
good writing and newsgathering skills, the 
newsperson in radio must have announcing 
abilities. Again, training is usually essential. 
“Not only must a radio newsperson be able 
to write a story, but he or she has to be 
able to present it on the air. You have to 
be an announcer, too. It takes both training 
and experience to become a really effec-
tive newscaster. Voice performance courses 
can provide a foundation,” says Smith. Most 
in radio journalism is more of a hindrance to 
an operation than a help,” contends Mason. 
Titus wants someone who is totally devoted 
to the profession. “When you get right down 
to it, I want someone on my staff who eats, 
drinks, and sleeps news.”
On the practical side of the ledger, 
news­man Sherman Whitman says that 
typing or keyboard skills are essential. “If 
you can’t type, you can’t work in a news-
room. It’s an essential ability, and the more 
accuracy and speed the better. It’s one of 
those skills basic to the job. A candidate 
for a news job can come in here with 
two degrees, but if that person can’t type, 
that person won’t be hired. Broadcast stu-
dents should learn to type.” Meanwhile, 
Jewett stresses the value of possessing a 
firm command of the English language. 
“Proper punctuation, spelling, and syntax 
make a news story intelligible. A newsper-
son doesn’t have to be a grammarian, but 
he or she had better know where to put a 
comma and a period and how to compose 
a good clean sentence. A copy of Strunk 
and White’s Elements of Style is good to 
have around.”

Going on the air with copy riddled with 
errors is inviting disaster. The only things 
right about the preceding news copy are that 
it is typed in uppercase and double-spaced. 
Here are a few suggestions to keep in mind 
when preparing a radio news story:
1.	 Type neatly. Avoid typos and cross-outs. 
Eliminate a typing error completely. If it 
is left on the page, it could trip you up 
during a broadcast.
2.	 Use uppercase throughout the story. It is 
easier to read. Do not forget, the story you 
are writing is going to be read on the air.
3.	 Double-space between lines for the same 
reason uppercase is used – copy is easier to 
read. Space between lines of copy keeps 
them from merging when read aloud.
4.	 Use one-inch margins. Do not run the 
copy off the page. Uniformity eliminates 
errors. At the same time, try not to break 
up words.
colleges with broadcasting programs offer 
announcing and newscasting instruction.
Entry-level news positions pay modestly, 
whereas news people at metro market sta-
tions earn impressive incomes. With experi-
ence come the better paying jobs. Finding 
that first full-time news position often 
takes patience and determination. Several 
­industry trade journals, such as Broadcast-
ing, the Radio-Television News Directors 
Association’s 
(RTNDA) 
Communicator, 
Radio and Records, and others, list news 
openings.
Preparing the News Story
Observes Valerie Geller, “News programming 
is shorter, faster, and sharper.” Given this, 
clean copy is essential. News stories must 
be legible and intelligible and designed for 
effortless reading by the newscaster or several 
different newscasters. Typos, mispunctuation, 
awkward phrasing, and incorrect spelling are 
anathema to the person at the microphone. 
Try reading the following news story aloud 
and imagine yourself in a studio broadcasting 
to thousands of perplexed listeners:

or ­opportunity to consult the dictionary. 
“Keep it simple and direct. No compound-
complex sentences with dozens of esoteric 
phrases and terms. Try to picture the lis-
tener in your mind. He is probably driving a 
car or doing any number of things. Because 
of the nature of the medium, writing must 
be concise and conversational,” contends 
Judy Smith.
Corey Flintoff agrees that “Copy should 
be adapted to a conversational style. 
Titles should be simplified and numbers 
rounded off.”
News stories must be well structured and 
organized. This adds to their level of under-
standing. The journalist’s five W’s – who, 
what, when, where, and why – should be 
incorporated into each story. If a story fails 
to provide adequate details, the listener may 
tune in elsewhere to get what radio com-
mentator Paul Harvey calls “the rest of the 
story.”
When quoting a source in a news story, 
proper attribution must be made. This 
increases credibility while placing the 
burden of responsibility for a statement on 
the shoulders of the person who actually 
made it:
THE DRIVER OF THE CAR THAT STRUCK
THE BUILDING APPEARED INTOXI-
CATED, ACCORDING TO LISA BARNES,
WHO VIEWED THE INCIDENT.
Observes Flintoff on the matter of attri-
bution, “I prefer to identify a source at the 
beginning of the sentence on the theory 
that its more conversational. Thus, ‘Lisa 
Barnes, a witness, said the driver...’ or ‘Lisa 
Barnes saw the car crash into the build-
ing. She said the driver....’ Incidentally, I 
think there’s a danger of legal problems 
using a witness’s speculation that someone 
is drunk. I’ve had similar problems in the 
past, and I never use anything about poten-
tial intoxication unless there’s a police test 
for drugs or alcohol.”
Uncorroborated statements can make a 
station vulnerable to legal actions. The reli-
ability of news sources must be established. 
When there are doubts concerning the facts, 
the newsperson has a responsibility to seek 
verification.
  5.	 Avoid abbreviations, except for those 
meant to be read as such: YMCA, 
U.S.A., NAACP, AFL/CIO.
  6.	 Write out numbers under ten, and use 
numerals for figures between 10 and 
999. Spell out thousand, million, and so 
forth. For example, 21 million people, 
instead of 21,000,000 people. Numbers 
can be tricky, but a consistent approach 
prevents problems.
  7.	 Use the phonetic spelling for words 
that may cause pronunciation difficul-
ties, and underline the stressed syllable: 
Monsignor (Mon-seen-yor).
  8.	 Punctuate properly. A comma out of 
place can change the meaning of a 
sentence.
  9.	 When in doubt, consult a ­standard style 
guide. In addition, both AP and UPI 
publish handbooks on newswriting.
10.  Use Spellcheck or a dictionary. Mis-
spelling causes problems and embarrass­
ment.
Notice how much easier it is to read a 
news story that is correctly prepared:
THE 
PRESIDENT 
STATED 
TODAY 
THAT HE
WILL SEEK REELECTION TO A SECOND
TERM IN OFFICE, DESPITE RUMORS
THAT HE WILL LEAVE WASHINGTON TO
PURSUE A CAREER IN HOLLYWOOD.
Since radio news copy is written for 
the ear and not for the eye, its style must 
reflect that fact. In contrast to writing 
done for the printed page, radio writing is 
more conversational and informal. Neces-
sity dictates this. Elaborately constructed 
sentences containing highly sophisticated 
language may effectively communicate to 
the reader but create serious problems for 
the listener, who must digest the text while 
it is being spoken. Although the reader has 
the luxury to move along at his or her own 
pace, the radio listener must keep pace with 
the newscaster or miss out on information. 
Radio writing must be accessible and imme-
diately comprehensible. The most widely 
accepted and used words must be chosen so 
as to prevent confusion on the part of the 
listener, who usually does not have the time 
170	
CHAPTER 5 News

Organizing the Newscast
News on music-oriented radio stations com-
monly is presented in 5-minute blocks and 
aired at the top or bottom of the hour, During 
drivetime periods, stations often increase the 
length and/or frequency of newscasts. The 
5 minutes allotted news is generally divided 
into segments to accommodate the pre-
sentation of specific information. A station 
may establish a format that allows for two 
minutes of local and regional stories, one 
minute for key national and international 
stories, one minute for sports, and 15 seconds 
for weather information.  A 30- or 60-second 
commercial break will be counted as part of 
the five-minute newscast.
The number of stories in a newscast 
may be preordained by program manage-
ment or may vary depending on the sig-
nificance and scope of the stories being 
reported. News policy may require that no 
stories, except in particular cases, exceed 
15 seconds. Here, the idea is to deliver 
as many stories as possible in the limited 
time available, the underlying sentiment 
being that more is better. In 5 minutes, 
15–20 items may be covered. In contrast, 
other stations prefer that key stories be 
addressed in greater detail. As few as 5–10 
news items may be broadcast at stations 
taking this approach.
Stories are arranged according to their rank 
of importance, the most significant story of 
the hour topping the news. An informed 
newsperson will know what stories deserve 
the most attention. Wire services weigh 
each story and position them accordingly in 
news roundups. The local radio newsperson 
decides what wire stories will be aired and 
in what order.
Assembling a five-minute newscast takes 
skill, speed, and accuracy. Stories must be 
updated and rewritten to keep news broad-
casts from sounding stale.
This often requires that telephone calls 
be made for late-breaking information. 
Meanwhile, on-the-scene voicers (actuali-
ties) originating from audio news services 
(UPI, AP) or fed by local reporters must be 
recorded and slotted in the newscast. “Pre-
paring a fresh newscast each hour can put

the station’s news and programming efforts. 
Rates for wire service vary depending on 
the size of the radio market, and audio 
service is available for an additional fee. 
Some 1800 stations use UPI and AP audio 
news feeds.
Broadcasters are evenly divided over 
the question as to which is the best wire 
service. Each news service has about the 
same number of radio stations under 
contract.
Both major wire services have kept pace 
with the new technologies. In the mid- 
1980s, UPI alone purchased 6000 Z-15 
desktop computers from Zenith Data 
Systems. Satellites also are used by the two 
news organizations for the transmission of 
teletype, teletext, and audio. The wire ser-
vices have become as wireless as the wire-
less medium itself.
The audio cuts provided by the news 
services are an integral part of most station 
newscasts. Observes radio scholar Larry 
Miller, “When these audio clips are sent 
to subscribing stations, they will also send 
along a menu which will list the type of 
cut (A-actuality, V-voicer, or W-wrap), who 
it is, what it’s about, how long it runs, and 
the outcue. Miller cautions that audio cuts 
should be used sparingly, “They should not 
be overused to pad out a newscast. Rele-
vance, audio quality, and length should rule 
the decisions regarding how much audio to 
use. With the proper application of these 
sources, even a one-person news operation 
can sound like a big city newsroom.”
Radio Network News
During the medium’s first three decades, 
the terms networks and news were virtually 
synonymous. Most of the news broadcast 
over America’s radio stations emanated 
from the networks. The public’s depen-
dence on network radio news reached its 
height during World War II. As television 
succeeded radio as the mainstay for enter-
tainment programming in the 1950s and 
1960s, the networks concentrated their 
efforts on supplying affiliates with news and 
information feeds. This approach helped 
the networks regain their footing in radio 
you in mind of what it must have been like 
to be a contestant on the old game show 
‘Beat the Clock.’ A conscientious newsper-
son is a vision of perpetual motion,” observes 
Cecilia Mason.
Finally, most news people read their news 
copy before going on the air. “Reading 
stories cold is foolhardy and invites trouble. 
Even the most seasoned newscasters at 
metro market stations take the time to read 
over their copy before going on,” comments 
Whitman. Many news people read copy 
aloud in the news studio before airtime. 
This gives them a chance to get a feel for 
their copy. Proper preparation prevents 
unpleasant surprises from occurring while 
on the air.
Wire and Internet Services
Without the aid of the major broadcast 
news wire services and the inestimable 
number of news-oriented Web sites that 
exist (CNN, MSNBC, Fox, Drudge Report, 
etc.) and blogs, radio stations would find 
it almost impossible to cover news on 
national and international levels. The wire 
services and Internet are a vital source 
of news information to nearly all of the 
nation’s commercial radio stations. Both 
large and small stations rely on the news 
copy fed them by either the AP or the UP 
International (UPI), the two most promi-
nent news wire services. Meanwhile, the 
Internet is a primary source of data and 
information.
Broadcast wire services came into exis-
tence in the mid-1930s, when UP (which 
became UPI in 1958 after merging with 
INS) began providing broadcasters with 
news copy. Today, the UPI and AP serve 
over 7500 broadcast outlets.
Both news sources supply subscriber 
stations with around-the-clock coverage of 
national and world events. Over 100,000 
stringers furnish stories from across the 
globe. The AP and UPI also maintain 
regional bureaus for the dissemination of 
local news. Each wire service transmits over 
20 complete news summaries daily. In addi-
tion, they provide weather, stock market, 
and sports information, as well as a for-
midable list of features and data useful to 
172	
CHAPTER 5 News

The usual length of a network newscast 
is five minutes, during which time affili-
ates are afforded an opportunity to insert 
local sponsor messages at designated times. 
The networks make their money by selling 
national advertisers spot availabilities in 
their widely broadcast news. Stations also 
pay the networks a fee for the programming 
they receive.
According to Metro Network president 
David Saperstein, today “more and more 
stations are realizing the benefits that exist 
in outside news services, which provide 
the information that listeners would oth-
erwise seek elsewhere. This allows the 
station to focus its marketing dollars, thus 
directing resources toward optimizing and 
maintaining what draws and keeps listen-
ers.” Of course, this latter trend has raised 
additional concerns about the decline in 
local news coverage as cited in recent 
RTNDA surveys. Station consolidations 
have resulted in the erosion of local news 
operations.
Radio Sportscasts
Sports is most commonly presented as an 
element within newscasts (refer back to 
Figure 5.9). Although many stations air 
sports as programming features unto them-
selves, most stations insert information, 
such as scores and schedules of upcoming 
games, at a designated point in a news-
cast and call it sports. Whether a station 
emphasizes sports largely depends on its 
audience. Stations gearing their format for 
youngsters or women often all but ignore 
after a period of substantial decline. By the 
mid-1960s, the majority of the nation’s sta-
tions used one of the four major networks 
for news programming.
In 1968, ABC decided to make available 
four distinct news formats designed for 
compatibility with the dominant sounds 
of the day. American Contemporary Radio 
Network, American FM Radio Network, 
American Entertainment Radio Network, 
and American Information Network each 
offered a unique style and method of news 
presentation. ABC’s venture proved enor-
mously successful. In the 1970s, over 1500 
stations subscribed to one of ABC’s four 
news networks.
In response to a growing racial and ethnic 
awareness, the Mutual Broadcasting System 
(MBS) launched two minority news net-
works in 1971. Though the network’s Black 
news service proved to be a fruitful venture, 
its Spanish news service ceased operation 
within two years of its inception. Mutual 
discovered that the ethnic group simply 
was too refracted and diverse to be effec-
tively serviced by one network and that 
the Latin listeners they did attract did not 
constitute the numbers necessary to justify 
operation.
In 1973, the network also went head-to-
head with ABC by offering a network news 
service (Mutual Progressive Network) that 
catered to rock-oriented stations. Mutual’s 
various efforts paid off by making it second 
only to ABC in number of affiliates. After 
years of financial difficulties, MBS went 
silent in 1999, ending nearly seven decades 
of radio news service.
The News and Information Service (NIS) 
was introduced by NBC in 1975 but ended 
in 1977. NIS offered client stations an All-
News format. Fifty minutes of news was 
fed to stations each hour. The venture was 
abandoned after only moderate acceptance. 
CBS, which has offered its member stations 
World News Roundup since 1938, and NBC 
have under 300 affiliates apiece.
Several state and regional news networks 
do well, but the big three, ABC, NBC, and 
CBS, continue to dominate. Meanwhile, 
independent satellite news and information 
networks and the cable news services, such 
as CNN, have joined the field and more are 
planned.

a sport through the eyes and body of the 
athlete,” contends radio sports director John 
Colletto.
Unlike news that requires an impartial and 
somewhat austere presentation, sportscasts 
frequently are delivered in a casual and even 
opinionated manner. “Let’s face it, there’s a 
big difference between nuclear arms talks 
between the United States and the Soviets 
and last night’s Red Sox/Yankees score.  
I don’t think sports reports should be treated 
in a style that’s too solemn. It’s entertain-
ment, and sportscasters should exercise 
their license to comment and analyze,” says 
Colletto.
Although sports is presented in a less 
heavy-handed way than news, credibility 
is an important factor, contends Colletto. 
“There is a need for radio sportscasters 
sports. Adult-oriented stations, such as 
Middle-of-the-Road, will frequently offer 
a greater abundance of sports information, 
especially when the station is located in 
an area that has a major league team.
Stations that hire individuals to do sports, 
and invariably these are larger outlets since 
few small stations can afford a full-time 
sportsperson, look for someone who is well 
versed in athletics. “To be good at radio 
sports, you have to have been involved as 
a participant somewhere along the line. 
That’s for starters, in my opinion. This 
doesn’t mean that you have to be a former 
major leaguer before doing radio sports 
but to have a feel for what you’re talking 
about, it certainly helps to have been on the 
field or court yourself. A good sportscaster 
must have the ability to accurately analyze

CHAPTER 5 News

to establish credibility just as there is for 
­news people to do so. If you’re not believ-
able, you’re not listened to. The best way 
to win the respect of your audience is by 
demonstrating a thorough knowledge of the 
game and by sounding like an insider, not 
just a guy reading the wire copy. Remember, 
sports fans can be as loyal to a sportscaster 
as they are to their favorite team. They want 
to hear the stories and scores from a person 
they feel comfortable with.”
The style of a news story and a sports 
story may differ considerably. Although news 
is written in a no-frills, straightforward way, 
sports  stories often contain colorful collo-
quialisms and even popular slang. Here is an 
example by radio sportswriter Roger Crosley:
THE DEAN COLLEGE RED DEMON

ZOLLO YESTERDAY TO AN 18–16 COME

Sportscasters are personalities, says Col-
letto, and as such must be able to commu-
nicate on a different level than newscasters. 
“You’re expected to have a sense of humor. 
Most successful sportscasters can make an 
audience smile or laugh. You have to be able 
to ad-lib, also.”
The wire services, networks, and Internet 
are the primary source for sports news at 
local stations. On the other hand, informa-
tion about the outcome of local games, such 
as high school football and so forth, must be 
acquired firsthand. This usually entails a call 
to the team’s coach or a direct report from 
a stringer or reporter.

Radio News and the FCC
The government takes a greater role in reg-
ulating broadcast journalism than it does 
print. Although it usually maintains a hands-
off position when it comes to newspapers, 
the government keeps a watchful eye on 
radio to ensure that it meets certain oper-
ating criteria. Since the FCC perceives the 
airways as public domain, it expects broad-
casters to operate in the public’s interest.
The FCC requires that radio reporters 
present news factually and in good faith. 
Radio News and the FCC

the newsperson represents. Of course, a 
newsperson wants as much information as 
possible about an incident, but the public’s 
right to privacy must be respected.
Objectivity is the cornerstone of good 
reporting. A newsperson who has lost his 
or her capacity to see the whole picture is 
handicapped. At the same time, the news-
person’s job is to report the news and not 
create it. The mere presence of a member 
of the media can inspire a disturbance or 
agitate a volatile situation. Staging an event 
for the sake of increasing the newsiness 
of a story is not only unprofessional but 
illegal. Groups have been known to await 
the arrival of reporters before initiating a 
disturbance for the sake of gaining public-
ity. It is the duty of reporters to remain as 
innocuous and uninvolved as possible when 
on an assignment. Recall Indra de Silva’s 
comment earlier about the need for news 
to be presented in a thoughtful and consci-
entious way.
Several industry associations, such as 
RTNDA and Society of Professional Journal-
ists, have established codes pertaining to the 
ethics and conduct of broadcast reporters.
Traffic Reports
Traffic reports are an integral part of 
­drivetime news programming at many met-
ro-politan radio stations. Although providing 
listeners with traffic condition updates can 
be costly, especially air-to-ground reports 
that require the use of a helicopter or small 
plane, they can help strengthen a station’s 
community service image and also gener-
ate substantial revenue. To avoid the cost 
involved in airborne observation, stations 
sometimes employ the services of local 
auto clubs or put their own mobile units 
out on the roads. A station in Providence, 
Rhode Island, broadcasts traffic conditions 
from atop a 20-story hotel that overlooks 
the city’s key arteries. Fixed cameras at key 
traffic locations are also used.
Says David Saperstein, “Companies like 
Metro Network provide stations with out­
side traffic reporting services in a manner 
that is more cost- and quality-effective than 
a station handling it themselves.”
Stories that defame citizens through reck-
less or false statements may not only bring 
a libel suit from the injured party but action 
from the FCC, which views such behav-
ior on the part of broadcasters as contrary 
to the public’s interest. Broadcasters are 
protected under the First Amendment and 
therefore have certain rights, but as public 
trustees, they are charged with the addi-
tional responsibility of acting in a manner 
that benefits rather than harms members 
of society.
Broadcasters are free to express opinions 
and sentiments on issues through editori-
als. However, to avoid controversy, many 
radio stations choose not to editorialize 
even though the FCC encourages them to 
do so.
News Ethics
The highly competitive nature of radio 
places unusual pressure on news people. In 
a business where being first with the story 
is often equated with being the best, certain 
dangers exist. Being first at all costs can be 
costly, indeed, if information and facts are 
not adequately verified. As previously men-
tioned, it is the radio journalist’s obligation 
to get the story straight and accurate before 
putting it on the air. Anything short of this 
is unprofessional.
The pressures of the clock, if allowed, 
can result in haphazard reporting. If a story 
cannot be sufficiently prepared in time for 
the upcoming news broadcast, it should be 
withheld. Getting it on-air is not as impor-
tant as getting it on-air right. Accuracy is the 
newsperson’s first criterion. News accounts 
should never be fudged. It is tantamount to 
deceiving and misleading the public.
News reporters must exhibit discretion 
not only in the newsroom but also when on 
the scene of a story. It is commendable to 
assiduously pursue the facts and details of a 
story, but it is inconsiderate and insensitive 
to ignore the suffering and pain of those 
involved. For example, to press for com-
ments from a grief-stricken parent whose 
child has just been seriously injured in an 
accident is callous and cruel and a disser-
vice to all concerned, including the station 
176	
CHAPTER 5 News

Traffic reports are scheduled several times 
an hour throughout the prime commuter 
periods on stations primarily catering to 
adults, and they range in length from 30–90 
seconds. The actual reports may be done 
by a station employee who works in other 
areas of programming when not surveying 
the roads, or a member of the local police 
department or auto club may be hired for 
the job. Obviously, the prime criterion for 
such a position is a thorough knowledge of 
the streets and highways of the area being 
reported.
News in Music Radio
In 1980s, the FCC saw fit to eliminate the 
requirement that all radio stations devote a 
percentage of their broadcast day to news 
and public affairs programming. Opponents 
of the decision argued that such a move 
would mark the decline of news on radio. 
In contrast, proponents of the deregula-
tion commended the FCC’s actions that 
allow for the marketplace to determine 
the extent to which nonentertainment 
features are broadcast. In the late 1980s, 
RTNDA expressed the concern that local 
news coverage had declined. This, they said, 
had resulted in a decrease in the number 
of news positions around the country. Sup-
porting their contention they pointed out 
that several major stations, such as KDKA, 
WOWO, and WIND, had cut back their 
news budgets.
At that time, RTNDA’s Bob Priddy noted, 
“There has been a perceived decline in the 
amount of news broadcast. I don’t see this 
as a cold-hearted act on the part of station 
managers, but rather one frequently inspired 
by economics. The decline in news program­
ming is particularly alarming when you 
realize that it is at a time when a number of 
new stations are entering the airwaves.”
In 1992, RTNDA’s president, Dave 
­Bartlett, declared, “Deregulation really hasn’t 
taken news off radio. News is far from dead 
on the medium. The vast majority do news. 
All deregulation did was allow the market-
place to adjust at will. A lot of shifting has 
occurred, but the aggregate is the same.” A 
couple of years later, a survey published in 
the association’s newsletter, Communicator, 
told a different story. The report revealed 
that hundreds of radio newsrooms had, in 
fact, closed down and it suggested that many 
more would likely occur. In 1994, Radio 
World reported that over 1100 radio news 
operations had closed since the deregulation 
of the medium.

Cecilia Mason says that economics alone 
will help keep news a viable entity at many 
radio stations. “While a lot of stations con-
sider news departments expense centers, 
news is a money maker. This is especially 
true during drivetime periods when practi-
cally everyone tuned wants information, be 
it weather, sports, or news headlines. I don’t 
see a growing movement to eliminate news. 
However, I do see a movement to soften 
things up, that is, to hire voices instead 
of radio journalists. In the long run, this 
means fewer news jobs, I suppose. Econom-
ics again. While stations, for the most part, 
are not appreciably reducing the amount 
of time devoted to airing news, I suspect 
that some may be thinning out their news 
departments. Hopefully, this is not a prelude 
to a measurable cutback. News is still big 
business, though.”
“Responsible broadcasters know that it is 
the inherent duty of the medium to keep the 
public apprised of what is going on,” claims 
Larry Jewett. “While radio is primarily an 
entertainment medium, it is still one of the 
country’s foremost sources of information. 
Responsible broadcasters – and most of us

News director Sherman Whitman believes 
that the radio audience wants news even 
when a station’s primary product is music. 
“The public has come to depend on the 
medium to keep it informed. It’s a volatile 
world and certain events affect us all. Sta-
tions that aim to be full-service cannot do 
so without a solid news schedule.”

CHAPTER 5 News

C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
are – realize that we have a special obliga-
tion to fulfill. The tremendous reach and 
immediacy that is unique to radio forces 
the medium to be something more than just 
a jukebox.”
News director Frank Titus believes that 
stations will continue to broadcast news in 
the future. “There might be a tendency to 
invest less in news operations, especially at 
more music-oriented outlets, as the result 
of the regulation change and rampant con-
solidations, but news is as much a part of 
what radio is as are the deejays and songs. 
What it comes right down to is people 
want news broadcasts, so they’re going to 
get them. That’s the whole idea behind 
the commission’s FCC’s actions. There’s 
no doubt in my mind that the marketplace 
will continue to dictate the programming 
of radio news.”
News director Roger Nadel concurs. “As 
the age of the average listener increases, 
even people tuning in ‘music’ stations find 
themselves in need of at least minimal doses 
of news. So long as those stations are doing 
well financially, owners can be content to 
maintain some kind of a news operation. 
News is not likely to disappear; not even at 
music stations.”
In recent years, this optimism has sig-
nificantly diminished as a result of station 
clustering, consolidation, and downsizing 
and the continued elimination of radio news 
requirements. Competition from the wave 
of new audio services has also influenced 
the role of news in terrestrial radio.
1.  Although the first newscast occurred in 
1910, broadcast journalism did not evolve 
until the early 1920s. The broadcast of the 
Harding–Cox election results in 1920 was 
a historical benchmark.
2.  Because newspapers perceived radio 
as a competitive threat, UP, INS, and AP 
refused to sell to radio outlets from 1932 
until 1934. Radio, however, proved that it 
could provide its own news sources.
3.  The advent of television led radio outlets 
to localize their news content, which meant 
less reliance on news networks and the crea-
tion of a station news department.
4.  Surveys by the National Association 
of Broadcasters and the Radio Advertising  
Bureau found that more people tune in 
to radio news for their first daily source 
of information than turn to television or 
newspapers.
5.  The size of a station’s news staff depends 
on the degree to which the station’s format 
emphasizes news, the station’s market size, 
the emphasis of its competition, and station 
consolidations. Small stations often have no 
news people and require deejays to “rip ‘n’ 
read” wire service copy.
6.  Large news staffs may consist of news-
casters, writers, street reporters, and tech 
people, as well as stringers and interns.
7.  Computers in radio newsrooms are used 
as links to the various wire, news, audio, 
and database services, as display terminals 
for reading news copy on the air, and as 
word processors for writing and storing 
news. Software is available to newsrooms 
for archiving and other purposes.
8.  The news director, who works with and 
for the PD, supervises news staff, develops 
and implements policy, handles the budget, 
ensures the gathering of local news, is 
responsible for getting out breaking news 
stories rapidly and accurately and plans 
public affairs programming.
9.  News directors seek personnel with 
both college education and experience. 
However, finding a news slot at a small 
station is difficult since its news staffs 
are small, so internships and experience 
at high school and college stations are 
important. In addition, such personal 
qualities as enthusiasm, aggressiveness, 
energy, inquisitiveness, keyboarding skills, 
a knowledge of the area where the station 
Chapter Highlights	
179

is located, announcing abilities, and a 
command of the English language are 
assets.
10.  News stories must be legible, intel-
ligible, and designed for effortless read-
ing. They should sound conversational, 
informal, simple, direct, concise, and 
organized.
11.  Actualities (on-the-scene voicers) are 
obtained from news service feeds, online 
sources, and by station personnel at the 
scene.
12.  Wire services and the Internet are the 
primary sources of national and interna-
tional news for most stations. AP and UPI 
are the largest news wire services.
13.  The FCC expects broadcasters to report 
the news in a balanced and impartial 
manner. Although protected under the First 
Amendment, broadcasters making reckless 
or false statements are subject to both civil 
and FCC charges.
14.  Ethically, newspersons must maintain 
objectivity, discretion, and sensitivity.
15.  The FCC’s deregulation of news and 
public affairs programming in the 1980s, 
widespread station clustering in recent years 
due to consolidation, and emerging new 
information media have prompted concerns 
by industry officials and others that radio 
news service is on the decline if not on the 
cusp of extinction.

As World War II approached, another 
major ratings service, known as the Pulse, 
began to measure radio audience size. 
Unlike its competitors, Pulse collected 
information by conducting face-to-face 
interviews. Interest in audience research 
grew steadily throughout the 1930s and 
culminated in the establishment of the 
Office of Radio Research (ORR) in 1937. 
Funded by a Rockefeller Foundation grant, 
the ORR was headed by Paul F. Lazars-
feld, who was assisted by Hadley Cantril 
and Frank Stanton. The latter would go on 
to assume the presidency of CBS in 1946 
and would serve in that capacity into the 
1970s. Over a 10-year period, the ORR 
published several texts dealing with audi-
ence research findings and methodology. 
Among them were Lazarsfeld and Stanton’s 
multivolume Radio Research, which covered 
the periods of 1941–1943 and 1948–1949. 
During the same decade, Lazarsfeld also 
published book-length reports on the pub-
lic’s attitude toward radio: The People Look 
at Radio (1946) and Radio Listening in 
America (1948). Both works cast radio in 
a favorable light by concluding that most 
listeners felt the medium did an exemplary 
job. The Pulse and Hooper were the pre-
vailing radio station rating services in the 
1950s as the medium worked at regaining 
its footing following the meteoric rise of 
television. In 1965, Arbitron Ratings began 
measuring radio audience size through the 
use of a diary, which required respondents 
to document their listening habits over a 
seven-day period. By the 1970s, Arbitron 
reigned as the leading radio measurement 
company, whereas Hooper and Pulse faded 
6 Research
Who Is Listening?
As early as 1929, the question of listen-
ership was of interest to broadcasters and 
advertisers alike. That year Cooperative 
Analysis of Broadcasting (CAB), headed by 
Archibald M. Crossley, undertook a study 
to determine how many people were tuned 
to certain network radio programs. Informa-
tion was gathered by phoning a preselected 
sample of homes. One of the things the 
survey found was that the majority of lis-
tening occurred evenings between 7:00 and 
11:00 p.m. This became known as radio’s 
“prime time” until the 1950s.
On the local station level, various methods 
were employed to collect audience data, 
including telephone interviews and mail-out 
questionnaires. However, only a nominal 
amount of actual audience research was 
attempted during the late 1920s and early 
1930s. For the most part, just who was listen-
ing remained somewhat of a mystery until 
the late 1930s.
In 1938, C.E. Hooper, Inc. began the 
most formidable attempt up to that time 
to provide radio broadcasters with audi-
ence information. Like Crossley’s service, 
Hooper also used the telephone to accu-
mulate listener data. CAB relied on listener 
recall; Hooper, however, required that 
interviewers make calls until they reached 
someone who was actually ­listening to 
the radio. This approach became known 
as the “coincidental” telephone method. 
Both survey services found their efforts 
limited by the fact that 40% of the radio-
listening homes in the 1930s were without 
a telephone.

users audience measurement services that 
are valid, reliable, and effective, (2) to 
avoid and determine minimum disclosure 
and ethical criteria for media audience 
measurement services, and (3) to provide 
and administer an audit system designed 
to inform users as to whether such audi-
ence measurements are conducted in con-
formance with the criteria and procedures 
developed.
The Ratings and  
Survey Services
The extreme fragmentation of today’s lis-
tening audience, created by the almost ines-
timable number of stations and formats, 
makes the job of research a complex but 
necessary one. All stations, regardless of 
size, must put forth an effort to acquaint 
themselves with the characteristics of the 
audience, says Edward J. Noonan, codirec-
tor, Survey Research Associates. “A station 
cannot operate in a vacuum. It has to know 
who is listening and why before making 
any serious programming changes.” Today, 
this information is made available through 
several ratings services and research com-
panies. More stations depend on Arbitron 
audience surveys than any other.
Since the collapse of Birch/Scarborough, 
broadcasters have had little choice but to 
subscribe to Arbitron – that or go without 
the listening estimates on which so many 
agencies and advertisers rely. However, the 
radio audience survey industry has begun 
from the scene. To provide the radio net-
works and their affiliates and advertisers with 
much-needed ratings information, Statisti-
cal Research, Inc., of New Jersey, introduced 
Radio’s All Dimension Audience Research 
(RADAR) in 1968. The company gathers its 
information through telephone interviews 
with more than 6000 households. In the 
1990s, Arbitron retained its hold on first 
place among services measuring radio audi-
ences, especially since the demise of Birch/
Scarborough, which gained considerable 
acceptance following its debut in the late 
1970s. In 1991, this audience measurement 
company became yet another victim of the 
economic malaise.
Ratings companies must be reliable, and 
credibility is crucial to success. Therefore, 
measurement techniques must be tried and 
true. Information must be accurate, since 
millions of dollars are at stake. In 1963, the 
Broadcast Rating Council was established 
to monitor, audit, and accredit the various 
ratings companies. The council created 
performance standards to which rating ser-
vices are expected to adhere. Those that 
fail to meet the council’s operating criteria 
are not accredited. A nonaccredited ratings 
service will seldom succeed. In 1982, the 
Broadcast Rating Council was renamed 
the Electronic Media Planning Council 
to reflect a connection with the ratings 
services dealing with the cable television 
industry.
Renamed the Media Rating Council 
(MRC) in 1997 to include Internet con-
stituencies, the MRC’s declared purpose is

Ed Cohen
On Arbitron
Really, the role of Arbitron is still the 
currency (sales) aspect tied in with 
­Scarborough and other qualitative 
services to try and differentiate close 
competitors to agencies and major 
advertisers. Sure, Arbitron is used for 
programming and many program-
mers and talent (that still have jobs) 
are bonused on Arbitron results, but 
the prime use is setting rates. The 
­qualitative aspect is becoming more 
important, especially with Portable 
People Meter (PPM) where there is little 
difference in audience size between the 
top stations and those further down in 
the ranker.

to expand, if only slowly. For example, 
in recent years, additional listener/ratings 
services have begun to emerge. AccuRat-
ings is one example. It began to measure 
audiences in major metropolitan areas in 
the mid-1990s. Troy research is another. 
It relies on Internet-based research that 
involves online surveys pertaining to sta-
tions’ music playlists. Similar companies 
were beginning to surface to the relief of 
many broadcasters concerned with Arbi-
tron’s hold. Arbitron’s dominance has 
indeed caused anxiety in the radio com-
munity. Many managers and programmers 
were more than disturbed by the failure of 
the alternative measurement service. Arbi-
tron covers over 250 markets ranging in 
size from large to small. Arbitron claims 
over 2700 radio clients and a staff of 3000 
interviewers who collect listening informa-
tion from 2 million households across the 
country. All markets are measured at least 
once a year during the spring; however, 
larger markets are measured on an ongoing 
basis year round. Until the early 1980s, 
metro markets traditionally were rated in 
the spring and fall. However, 6 months 
between surveys was considered too long 
in light of the volatile nature of the radio 
marketplace.
To determine a station’s ranking, Arbi-
tron follows an elaborate procedure. First, 
the parameters of the area to be surveyed 
are established. Arbitron sees fit to measure 
listening both in the city or urban center, 
which it refers to as the Metro Survey Area 
(MSA), and in the surrounding ­communities 
or suburbs, which it classifies Total Survey 
Area (TSA). Arbitron classifies a station’s 
primary listening locations as its Areas of 
Dominant Influence (ADI).
Once the areas to be measured have been 
ascertained, the next thing Arbitron does is 
select a sample base composed of individu-
als to be queried regarding their listening 
habits. Metro-mail provides Arbitron with 
computer tapes that contain telephone and 
mailing lists from which the rating company 
derives its randomly selected sample. Arbi-
tron conducts its surveys over a 3- to 4-week 
period, during which time new samples are 
selected weekly.
When the sample has been established, 
a letter is sent to each targeted household. 
The replacement letter informs members of 
the sample that they have been selected to 
participate in a radio-listening survey and 
asks their cooperation. Within a couple of 
days after the letter has been received, an 
Arbitron interviewer calls to describe the 
purpose of the survey as well as to deter-
mine how many individuals aged 12 or 
older reside in the household. Upon receiv-
ing the go-ahead, Arbitron mails its 7-day 
survey diary, which requires respondees 
to log their listening habits. An incentive 
stipend of a dollar or two accompanies the 
document. The diary is simple to deal with, 
and the information it requests is quite 
basic: time (day/part) tuned to a station, 
station call letters or program name, 
whether AM or FM, and where listening 
occurred – car, home, elsewhere. Although 
the diary asks for information pertaining 
to age, sex, and residence, the actual iden-
tity or name of those participating is not 
requested.
Prior to the start of the survey, a rep-
resentative of Arbitron makes a presur-
vey follow-up call to those who have 
agreed to participate. This is done to make 
certain that the diary has been received 
and that everyone involved understands 
how to maintain it. Another follow-up call 
is made during the middle of the survey 
week to ascertain if the diary is being kept 
and to remind each participant to return 
it promptly on completion of the survey. 
Outside the metro area, follow-ups take 
the form of a letter. The diaries are mailed

Arbitron claims that 65 of every 100 
diaries it receives are usable. Diaries that 
are inadequately or inaccurately filled out 
are not used. Upon arriving at ­Arbitron 
­headquarters, diaries are examined by 
editors and rejected if they fail to meet 
criteria. Any diary received before the con-
clusion of the survey period is ­immediately

12 days after the end of the survey period. 
Diaries with blank or ambiguous entries 
also are rejected. Those diaries that survive 
the editors’ scrutiny are then processed 
through the computer, and their information 
is tabulated. Computer printouts showing 
audience estimates are sent to subscribers.

computers. To date, Arbitron has prepared 
over 380,000 radio market reports.
Ever evolving its services, Arbitron rolled 
out another online product for its radio 
clients in 2006. In an ­announcement on its 
Web site, it stated “Arbitron Inc., in con-
junction with comScore Media Metrix, a 
division of comScore Networks, Inc., has

made available to subscribers since the 
1990s. Information regarding a station’s 
past and current performances and those

finger. ­Breakouts and tailor-made reports are 
provided on an ongoing basis by Arbitrends 
to assist stations in the planning of sales and 
marketing strategies. The survey company 
has over 13 billion characters reserved on 
computer disk packs. Arbitron also makes 
available its Arbitrends Rolling Average

a 
prebalanced 
sample 
of 
­households during the evening hours, 7 
days a week, to acquire the information 
they needed. “Respondents aged twelve or 
older were randomly selected from both 
listed and nonlisted telephone house-
holds. These calls were made from highly 
supervised company WATTS facilities,” 
notes Phil Beswick, vice president of the 
defunct Birch/Scarborough broadcast ser-
vices. The sample sizes varied depending 
on the size of the market being surveyed. 
For example, Birch/Scarborough con-
tacted approximately 1100 households in 
a quarter of a million U.S. participants 
within the comScore global consumer 
panel. Using proprietary and patent-pend-
ing technology, comScore passively and 
continuously captures the online behavior 
of these panelists, including online radio 
listening behavior.”
Arbitron’s most formidable rival in recent 
years was Birch/Scarborough, headquar-
tered in New Jersey. As a radio audience 
measurement service, Birch ­provided clients 
with both quantitative and ­qualitative 
data on local listening patterns, audience 
size, and demographics. Birch ­interviewers

recall interview, in my estimation, yields the 
most reliable information. Not only that, it 
is quick and current – important factors in 
a rapidly moving and hyperdynamic radio 
marketplace.”
In her book Listening In, scholar Susan 
Douglas presciently noted that new tech-
nologies have been developed to more effec-
tively track listening. For instance, she cites 
databases such as MapMAKER that “can 
map the geography of a radio station’s listen-
ers and correlate their location with retailer 
trading areas.” Says Douglas, “The company 
is developing a pocket people meter, based 
on the ‘latest military technology,’ designed 
to track radio listening electronically no 
matter where the person is and to eliminate 
the [Arbitron] diary altogether.”
On the subject of music testing, Coleman 
Research’s Rebecca Reising notes that her 
company’s approach is unique. “We devel-
oped F.A.C.T., short for Fit Acceptance and 
Compatibility Test. F.A.C.T.’s proprietary 
research methods and sophisticated data-
bases make it much more powerful, reliable, 
and useful than old-fashioned music testing 
methods. As quick and efficient as old tests, 
F.A.C.T. provides a sophistication of inter-
pretation of music tests not offered by any 
other research company.”
In the hyperactive radio industry arena, 
both traditional and novel audience survey 
techniques must ultimately prove them-
selves by assisting stations in their unrelent-
ing quest for stronger ratings numbers.
Qualitative and  
Quantitative Data
Since their inception in the 1930s, ratings 
services primarily have provided broadcasters 
with information pertaining to the number of 
listeners of a certain age and gender tuned to 
a station at a given time. It was on the basis 
of these quantitative data that stations chose 
a format and advertisers made a buy.
Due to the explosive growth of the 
electronic media in recent years, the audi-
ence is presented with many more options, 
and the radio broadcaster, especially in 
larger markets, must know more about 
his intended listeners to attract and retain 
a medium market and between 2000 and 
8000 in major metro markets.
A wide range of reports were available 
to clients, including the Quarterly Summary 
Report, estimates of listening by location, 
county by county, and other detailed ­audience 
information; Standard Market Report, audi-
ence analysis especially designed for small 
market broadcasters; Capsule Market Report, 
listening estimates in the nation’s smallest 
radio markets; Condensed Market Report, 
designed specifically for radio outlets in 
markets not provided with regular syndi-
cated measurements and where cost was a 
key consideration; Monthly Trend Report, an 
ongoing picture of the listening audience so 
that clients might benefit from current shifts 
in the marketplace; Prizm, lifestyle-oriented 
radio ratings book that defined radio audi-
ences by lifestyle characteristics in more than 
85 markets; and BirchPlus, a microcomput-
erized system (IBM-PC) ratings retrieval and 
analysis. Fees for Birch/Scarborough services 
were based on market size. Birch provided 
subscribers with general product consump-
tion and media usage data. In late 1994, 
Arbitron purchased 50% of the Scarborough 
Research Corporation, with plans to offer 
stations expanded data about their listeners.
Dozens of other research companies 
throughout the country (among them 
Coleman Research, Bolton Research Cor-
poration, Mark Kassof & Company, Spec-
trum Research, Frank N. Magid Associates, 
DIR, Star, Paragon Research, Shane Media, 
Hagan Media Research, Gallup Services, 
Mediabase, TAPSCAN, Rantel Research, 
and others cited herein) provide broadcast-
ers with a broad range of useful audience 
information. Many use approaches similar 
to Arbitron (and formerly Birch) to collect 
data; still others use different methods. 
“Southeast Media Research offers four 
research methods: focus groups, telephone 
studies, mail intercepts, and music tests,” 
explains Don Hagen, the company’s presi-
dent. Christopher Porter, associate director 
of Surrey Research, says that his company 
uses similar techniques.
Meanwhile, audience researcher Dick 
Warner claims that the telephone recall 
method is the most commonly used and 
effective approach to radio audience sur-
veying. “The twenty-four-hour telephone

by the company to create timely reports to 
radio station subscribers.
In 2006, Arbitron announced that it 
would begin the transition to the PPM. 
It’s use of the traditional 7-day paper diary 
commenced in 1965, so its conversion to 
this new measurement technology repre-
sented an historic landmark. Five years in 
development yielded a positive response to 
the rollout of the PPM as CBS contracted 
the use of the device in 35 of its markets. 
Beasley Broadcast Group and Spanish 
Broadcasting System did likewise. On the 
heals of these deals, four other major radio 
groups – Bonnevile International Corpora-
tion, Emmis Communications Corporation, 
Greater Media, Inc., and Lincoln Financial 
Media – signed multiyear contracts for 
PPM radio ratings. Recently, PPM received 
approval from the Media Ratings Council, 
which signaled to the industry that the 
device was likely here to stay.
Ed Shane says the PPM may never be 
employed in small markets. “I daresay small 
markets will never see PPM because of the 
cost of implementation. It’s a much more 
important element in the sales process in 
large markets because of the transactional 
nature of buying. The smaller the market, 
the more selling is based on relationships 
and – most importantly – on results at the 
cash register.”
Tripp Eldredge, president of Direct Mar-
keting Research, explains how the PPM 
works, “To reiterate, it’s a small pager-
like device that survey panelists keep 
with them during their daily activities. 
The unit records inaudible codes emitted 
from any encoded audio source (including 
radio stations, television stations, and in-
store audio). The meter captures a near-
continuous stream of data as whenever and 
for as long as the panelist is exposed to 
the encoded media. The media needs to 
be audible for the meter to pick up the 
encoded audio. The meters are ‘docked’ at 
night and the data collected are transmit-
ted to Arbitron’s data center.”
Eldredge offers his views as to why the 
PPM is superior to the old paper method 
of gathering audience data. “The PPM is 
both passive and longitudinal. Both qualities 
lead to a superior methodology. Because it’s 
passive, it doesn’t rely on the memory or 
them. Subsequently, the need for more 
detailed information arose. In the 1990s, 
in-depth research was available to broad-
casters from numerous sources. In this age 
of highly fragmented audiences, advertis-
ers and agencies alike have become less 
comfortable with buying just numbers and 
look for audience qualities, notes Surrey’s 
Christopher Porter. “The proliferation of 
stations has resulted in tremendous audi-
ence fragmentation. There are so many 
specialized formats out there, and many 
target the same piece of demographic pie. 
This predicament, if it can be called that, 
has made amply clear the need for qualita-
tive, as well as quantitative, research. With 
so many stations doing approximately the 
same thing, differentiation is of paramount 
importance.”
Today, a station shooting for a top spot 
in the ratings surveys must be concerned 
with more than simply the age and sex of its 
target audience. Competitive programming 
strategies are built around an understand-
ing and appreciation of the lifestyles, values, 
and behavior of those listeners sought by a 
station.
Portable People Meter
Another approach to measuring station lis-
tenership has emerged in the form of the 
PPM created by Arbitron. The plan is to 
have this small mobile device replace the 
conventional paper diary method of tabulat-
ing audience size. Says Jeff Smulyan, “Elec-
tronic measurement is long overdue. We 
are finally getting credit for the huge audi-
ence we felt we had all along in Arbitron’s 
previous methodology. In Los Angeles, for 
example, one of our Emmis station’s cume 
was up 70% and our other Emmis station 
cume has almost quadrupled. That’s a lot 
of people listening to us that we were not 
getting credit for.” No longer will survey 
participants take an active role in record-
ing their listening patterns. The PPM does 
it by detecting codes embedded in radio 
broadcasts. This cell phone size device will 
be carried by Arbitron measurement panel-
ists for an agreed upon period of time, and 
the information it records can be accessed

could not track the changes in P1 from week 
to week or month to month. The meter can 
because it tracks the same consumers from 
day to day, etc. This new metric will provide 
new and better feedback  to  programmers 
and potentially advertisers as they begin to 
understand how loyalty impacts listening 
and how it is impacted by programming 
and marketing components.”
Eldredge observes that the PPM is not 
without its shortcomings, “Currently, the 
PPM shows an approximately 20% decrease 
in AQH listening to many stations. In a 
related note, the overall time spent listen-
ing to radio is lower, although there are 
about double the total audiences of sta-
tions. The meter shows that there are far 
more people tuning into a station than the 
diary has shown. Because there are more 
people identified, the average time spent 
listening is lower. That’s not necessarily a 
shortcoming of the PPM as much as it is 
an indication that the diary was not able 
to pick up about half of the actual stations 
tuned, resulting in consumers inadvertently 
overstating their listening volumes to the 
stations they remembered.”
­consciousness of the respondent to gather 
data and more importantly report it correctly. 
The diary relies on proper station identifica-
tion as well as proper reporting of behav-
ior on a quarter-hour by quarter-hour basis. 
Because it’s longitudinal, it provides much 
more stable results for the time periods most 
relevant to advertisers and broadcasters. Much 
of the differences in the diary methodology 
can be a result of sampling error, depending 
on the time period in question. The meter 
eliminates much of the instability due to ran-
domness because it’s kept for an average of 
six months. Also, the long-term nature of the 
meter may serve to eliminate the survey bias 
inherent in the diary process.”
“There are some important new insights 
the PPM will provide that result from its 
longitudinal nature. One very important 
new benefit is the ability to track loyalty and 
brand-switching over time. The diary process 
would infer the preferred station through 
the week-long measurement. The First 
Preference (P1) is the station that gets the 
majority of a consumer’s listening. P1 drives 
the majority of a station’s AQH (average 
quarter hour listening). However, the diary

programming. However, PPM data also 
indicates that strong morning show per-
sonalities are continuing to exhibit success 
equal to, if not greater, AQH compared 
to the old diary methodology. The early 
lessons of PPM are that the new measure-
ment device highlights the strengths and 
weaknesses of the station. If a morning 
show was ­underperforming according to 
the diaries, it will likely become even more 
flaring under PPM. Programmers have a 
large amount of weekly data at their fin-
gertips with PPM. It also is showing that 
midday and afternoon drive listening is 
reaching audience levels sometimes equal 
to morning drive. As programmers become 
more comfortable with PPM, they will 
take more risks on the air. If the early data 
shows that something new is not working, 
programmers can quickly change course 
application of the cell phone for audi-
ence measurement purposes. Also in 2006, 
Mediamark Research developed a beeper-
size portable device designed to calculate 
­audience shares for radio stations. Jump 
ahead to 2009 and Arbitron announced 
plans to sample listening via cell phones. 
Obviously, the next edition of this book will 
have more to say about the PPM’s effec-
tiveness and application, as well as other 
new portable ratings devices, which may be 
embraced by the market.
In terms of what the PPM means to 
on-air personnel, Jason Insalaco posits the 
view that “early results indicate music is 
winning over deejay patter. Consequently, 
programmers of struggling morning shows 
are pulling back their personalities from 
the usual bits, interviews, and banter and 
offering more music-intensive morning

the respondees. Of course, more detailed 
interviews are time consuming and usually 
require refined interviewing skills, both of 
which can be cost factors.
Mail surveys can be useful for a host of 
reasons. To begin with, they eliminate the 
need to hire and train interviewers. This 
alone can mean a great deal in terms of 
money and time. Because no interviewers 
are involved, one source of potential bias 
also is eliminated. Perhaps most important 
is that individuals questioned through the 
mail are somewhat more inclined toward 
candor since they enjoy greater anonymity. 
The major problem with the mail survey 
approach stems from the usual low rate of 
response. One in every five questionnaires 
mailed may actually find its way back to 
the station. The length of the questionnaire 
must be kept relatively short and the ques-
tions succinct and direct. Complex ques-
tions create resistance and may result in the 
survey being ignored or discarded.
Large and major market outlets usually 
employ someone to direct research and 
survey efforts. This person works closely 
with upper management and department 
heads, especially the program director (PD) 
and sales manager. These two areas require 
data on which to base programming and 
marketing decisions. At smaller outlets, 
area directors generally are responsible for 
conducting surveys relevant to their depart-
ment’s needs. A case in point would be the 
PD who plans a phone survey during a 
special broadcast to help ascertain whether 
it should become a permanent program 
offering. To accomplish this task, the pro-
grammer enlists the aid of a secretary and 
two interns from a local college. Calls are 
made, and data are collected and analyzed.
The objective of a survey must be clear 
from the start, and the methodology used to 
acquire data should be as uncomplicated as 
possible. Do-it-yourself surveys are limited 
in nature, and overly ambitious goals and 
expectations are seldom realized. However, 
in-house research can produce valuable infor-
mation that can give a station a competitive 
edge. Today, no radio station can operate in 
a detached way and expect to prosper.
Every station has numerous sources of 
information available to it. Directories con-
taining all manner of data, such as population 
without having to wait months to discern a 
trend as they did under the previous diary 
system.”
In-House Research Techniques
Research data provided by the major survey 
companies can be costly. For this reason and 
others, stations frequently conduct their 
own audience studies. Although stations 
seldom have the professional wherewithal 
and expertise of the research companies, 
they can derive useful information through 
do-it-yourself, in-house telephone, face-to-
face, and mail surveys.
Telephone surveying is the most com-
monly used method of deriving audience 
data on the station level. It generally is less 
costly than the other forms of in-house 
research, and sample selection is less 
complicated and not as prone to bias. It 
also is the most expedient method. There 
are, however, a few things that must be 
kept in mind when conducting call-out 
surveys. One, not everyone has a phone 
and many numbers are unlisted. People 
also are wary of phone interviews for fear 
that the ultimate objective of the caller is 
to sell something. The public is inundated 
by phone solicitors (both human and com-
puterized). Finally, extensive interviews 
are difficult to obtain over the phone. 
Five to 10 minutes usually is the extent 
to which an interviewee will submit to 
questioning. Call-out interview seminars 
and instructional materials are available 
from a variety of sources, including the 
telephone company itself.
Internet and e-mail services provide 
another valuable means for those radio 
stations that survey their audiences. Many 
stations employ computers for call-out 
research purposes. There are many obvious 
benefits, interactivity and archiving fore-
most among them. The face-to-face or per-
sonal interview also is a popular research 
approach at stations, although the cost can 
be higher than call-out, especially if a vast 
number of individuals are being surveyed 
in an auditorium setting. The primary 
advantages of the in-person interview 
are that questions can be more substan-
tive and greater time can be spent with

Treatment (DST), a technique designed to 
increase the response rate among Blacks. 
The survey company provides incentives 
over the customary 50¢–$1 to certain 
Black households. Up to $5 is paid to some 
respondents. DST employs follow-up calls 
to retrieve diaries.
During its years of operation, Birch/
Scarborough Research employed special 
sampling procedures and bilingual inter-
viewers to collect data from the Hispanic 
population. According to the company, its 
samples yielded a high response rate among 
Blacks. Thus, Birch did not use other special 
sampling controls. Ethnic listening reports

statistics and demographics, manufacturing 
and retailing trends, and so on, are available 
at the public library, city hall, chamber of 
commerce, and various business associations. 
The American Marketing Association and 
American Research Foundation also possess 
information designed to guide stations with 
their in-house survey efforts.
Research Deficits
Although broadcasters refer deferentially to 
the ratings surveys as the “book” or “bible,” 
the stats they contain are audience-listening 
estimates – no more, and, it is hoped, no 
less. Since their inception, research compa-
nies have been criticized for the methods 
they employ in collecting audience listening 
figures. The most prevalent complaint has 
had to do with the selection of samples. 
Critics have charged that they invariably 
are limited and exclusionary. Questions 
have persisted as to whether those surveyed 
are truly representative of an area’s total 
listenership. Can 1% of the radio universe 
accurately reflect general listening habits? 
The research companies defend their tactics 
and have established a strong case for their 
methodology.
In the 1970s, ratings companies were 
criticized for neglecting minorities in their 
surveys. In efforts to rectify this deficiency, 
both Arbitron and Birch established special 
sampling procedures. The incidence of non-
telephone households among Blacks and 
Hispanics tends to be higher. The survey 
companies also had to deal with the problem 
of measuring Spanish-speaking people. 
Arbitron found that using the personal-
­retrieval technique significantly increased 
the response rate in the Spanish commu-
nity, especially when bilingual interviewers 
were used. The personal-retrieval technique 
did not work as well with Blacks, since it 
was difficult to recruit interviewers to work 
in many of the sample areas. Thus, Arbitron 
used a telephone retrieval procedure that 
involved callbacks to selected households 
over a 7-day period to document listening 
habits. In essence, the interviewer filled out 
the diaries for those being surveyed. In 1982, 
Arbitron implemented ­Differential Survey

Similar complaints of skewed or incon-
clusive surveys persist today, but the proce-
dures and methods used by the major radio 
audience research companies, although far 
from perfect, are more effective than ever. 
Christopher Porter says the greatest miscon-
ception about research data is that they are 
absolutes etched in granite. “The greatest 
fallacy is that research findings are gospel. 
This goes not only for the quantitative 
studies but for focus groups as well. Regard-
less of the methodology, any findings should 
be used as a ‘gut adjuster,’ rather than a ‘gut 
replacer.’ Sampling error is often ignored 
in a quantitative study, even in an Arbi-
Both survey companies employed addi-
tional procedures to survey other nontele-
phone households, especially in markets that 
have a large student or transient population. 
In the late 1970s, a Boston station ­targeting 
young people complained that Arbitron 
failed to acknowledge the existence of over 
200,000 college students who did not have 
personal phone listings. The station, which 
was rated among the top five in the market 
at the time, contended that a comprehen-
sive survey of the city’s listening audience 
would bear out the fact that they were, in 
fact, number one.

erized service, BirchPlus. However, both 
services experienced steady growth.
Compounding the task of audience sur-
veying, says Ed Shane, is the fact that “lower 
response rates are affecting all research.” 
Continues Shane, “Telephone research opera-
tions have the same problem because people 
are burned out on solicitation by phone. For 
a recent research project, we made 20,100 
phone calls to yield 405 respondents. As 
already indicated, some researchers suggest 
turning to the Internet for surveys. It’s sure 
convenient, because the respondents come 
to the researcher. However, until Internet 
usage levels are as ubiquitous as the tele-
phone, the sample generated from Internet 
surveys is not projectable across the popula-
tion as a whole.”
David 
Pearlman 
concurs. 
“Audience 
research is increasingly hard to acquire. 
Response rates are the foremost issue facing 
Arbitron, or any one else measuring listen-
ing or consumer habits.” Adds, consultant 
Gary Begin, “Until PPM or some other 
­methodology is fully realized, getting diary 
keepers to make accurate entries will largely 
depend on their remembering a station’s 
name or frequency, and that, as we well 
know, is a dubious business.”
Adding to all this, notes Shane, is the fact 
that “radio research has been all but elimi-
nated from station budgets as simply too 
costly. That leaves little understanding of 
the audience and its needs and desires.”
tron report. When we report that 25% of a 
sample feels some way about something, or 
when a station with a 4.1 beats one with a 
3.8 in a book, most station managers and 
PDs take all these statistics at face value.”
Rip Ridgeway, former vice president of 
Arbitron Ratings, believes that stations place 
too much emphasis on survey results. “I 
think that station hierarchy puts too much 
credence on the ratings estimates. They’re 
an indicator, a sort of report card on a sta-
tion’s performance. They’re not the abso-
lute end all. To jump at the next numbers 
and make sweeping changes based on them 
generally is a big mistake.”
Radio executive Lorna Ozman concurs 
with both Porter and Ridgeway and warns 
that research should help direct rather than 
dictate what a station does. “I use research, 
rather than letting it use me. The thing 
to remember is that no methodology is 
without a significant margin of error. To treat 
the results of a survey as gospel is danger-
ous. I rely on research to provide me with 
the black-and-white answers and depend 
on myself to make determinations on the 
gray areas. Research never provided a radio 
station with the glitter to make it sparkle.”
Station general manager (GM) Richard 
­Bremkamp also expresses concern over what 
he perceives as an almost obsessive empha-
sis on survey statistics. “The concern for 
numbers gets out of hand. There are some 
really good-sounding stations out there that 
don’t do good book, but the money is in 
the numbers. Kurt Vonnegut talks about the 
‘Universal Will to Become’ in his books. In 
radio that can be expanded to the Universal 
Will to Become Number One. This is good 
if it means the best, but that’s not always 
what it means today.”
The proliferation of data services has 
drawn criticism from broadcasters who 
feel that they are being oversurveyed and 
over-researched. When Arbitron introduced 
its computerized monthly ratings service 
(Arbitrends), the chairman of its own radio 
advisory council opposed the venture on 
the grounds that it would cause more con-
fusion and create more work for broadcast-
ers. He further contended that the monthly 
service would encourage short-term buying 
by advertisers. Similar criticism was lodged 
against Birch/Scarborough’s own comput-

­responsibility of the individual buying 
media for an agency. It should be appar-
ent by now that many things are taken into 
consideration before airtime is purchased.
Careers in Research
The number of media research companies 
grew rapidly since the late 1960s but slowed 
in the post-Telecom Act 1990s as station 
consolidation became the rule of the land. 
Today dozens of research houses nationwide 
offer audience measurement and survey 
data to the electronic media and allied fields. 
Job opportunities in research have increased 
proportionately. Persons wanting to work in 
the research area need sound educational 
backgrounds, says ­Surrey’s Porter. “College is 
essential. An individual attempting to enter 
the field today without formal training is 
at a serious disadvantage. In fact, a master’s 
degree is a good idea.” Dr. Rob Balon, presi-
dent of Balon and Associates, agrees with 
Porter. “Entering the research field today 
requires substantial preparation. College 
research courses are where to start.”
Researcher Ed Noonan is of the same 
opinion. “It is a very competitive and 
demanding profession. Formal training is 
very important. I’d advise anyone planning a 
career in broadcast research to get a degree 
in communications or some related field 
and heavy-up on courses in research meth-
odology and analysis, statistics, marketing, 
and computers. Certain business courses are 
very useful, too.”
To Don Hagen of Southeast Media 
Research, a strong knowledge of media 
is a key criterion when hiring. “One of 
the things that I look for in a job candi-
date is a college background in electronic 
media. That’s the starting point. You have 
to know more today than ever before. 
Audience research has become a complex 
science.”
As might be expected, research directors 
also place considerable value on experi-
ence. “The job prospect who offers some 
experience in the research area, as well as 
a diploma, is particularly attractive,” notes 
researcher Dick Warner. Ed Noonan concurs. 
“Actual experience in the field, even if it is 
How Agencies Buy Radio
The primacy of numbers perhaps is best 
illustrated through a discussion of how 
advertising agencies place money on radio 
stations. It is the media buyer’s job to effec-
tively and efficiently invest the advertiser’s 
money – in other words, to reach the most 
listeners with the budget allotted for radio 
use. According to media buyer Lynne Price, 
the most commonly employed method 
determines the cost per point (CPP) of a 
given station. Lynne explains the proce-
dure: “A media buyer is given a budget and 
a gross rating point (GRP) goal. Our job 
is to buy to our GRP goal, without going 
over budget, against a predetermined target 
audience, i.e., adults 25 to 54, teens, men 
18 to 34, etc. Our CPP is derived by taking 
the total budget and dividing by the GRP 
goal, or total number of rating points we 
would like to amass against our target audi-
ence. Now, using the CPP as a guideline, we 
take the cost per spot on a given station, 
and divide by the rating it has to see how 
close to the total CPP the station is. This 
is where the negotiation comes in. If the 
station is way off, you can threaten not to 
place advertising until they come closer to 
what you want to spend.”
The other method used to justify station 
buys is cost per thousand (CPM). Using this 
technique, the buyer determines the cost 
of reaching 1000 people at a given station. 
The CPM of one station is then compared 
with that of another’s to ascertain efficiency. 
To determine a station’s CPM, the buyer 
must know the station’s average quarter-
hour audience (AQH persons) estimate in 
the daypart targeted and the cost of a com-
mercial during that time frame. The follow-
ing computation will provide the station’s 
CPM: by dividing the number of people 
reached into the cost of the commercial, the 
CPM is deduced.
25 (000) AQH
$30 for 60 seconds
$1.20 CPM

Thus, the lower the CPM, the more 
efficient the buy. Of course, this assumes 
that the station selected delivers the 
target ­audience sought. Again, this is the

basic to the researcher’s personality.” Don 
Hagen adds objectivity and perceptiveness 
to the list, and consultant Dwight Douglas 
emphasizes interactive skills. “People skills 
are essential, since selling and servicing 
research clients are as important as the 
research itself.”

ing researchers to work in radio to get a 
firsthand feel for the medium. “A hands-on 
knowledge of the broadcast industry is 
invaluable, if not vital, in this profession.”
In the category of personal attributes, 
Dick Warner puts inquisitiveness at the top 
of the list. “An inquiring mind is essential. 
The job of the researcher is to find and 
collect facts and information. Curiosity is

on their age, listening habits (e.g., 
favorite station), favorite music types, 
ethnicity, county of residence, and 
anything else of importance to the 
station (client). These surveys run 
15–20 minutes.
Respondents are selected at random. 
We also do tracking studies, which 
include respondents from the original 
survey and which measure changes in 
opinion (usually 6 months out from the 
original survey).
Perceptual studies are the founda-
tion of research, because they provide 
overall market information: percep-
tions of the client’s station and its 
­competitors, which the station uses 
to make programming, marketing, 
and sales decisions. The information 
gathered also aids us in designing a 
research program for the station.
• Music and program testing. There are 
several commonly used methods for 
testing music and program elements.
1.	Auditorium testing. This is the 
industry standard for testing music 
that may be aired on the station. 
Respondents are screened accord-
ing to station listenership, and paid 
an incentive between $35 and 
$50, depending on the market size. 
The typical test involves 100–150 
respondents; they are usually split 
into two groups. Each group gathers 
at a hotel, where they listen on 
speakers to 350–400 hooks (5–10 
seconds of a song, the most memo-
rable part). In total, 700–800 hooks 
will be tested. The respondents score 
each hook, using a 1–5 (or similar) 
scale. They also note if they are 
familiar with the song, and give it a 
burn score if they’re tired of hearing 
the song.
Bolton does “Personalized Music Tests” 
(PMT) instead of auditorium tests. 
Respondents in a PMT come 
to a facility at a time of their 
choice, and they test the hooks 
on ­Walkman-style cassette players 
with headphones. We’ve found that 
we have a better turnout than the 
auditorium tests and that the results 
are better because each respondent 
hears the hooks the same way (in 
an auditorium, respondents are at 
different distances from the speak-
ers) without distractions from other 
listeners. Auditorium tests are still 
the industry standard, however.
2.	Perceptual analyzer tests. In both of 
the previous methods, responders 
typically score hooks with paper and

client instant information. As the 
scores are given, the computer pro-
duces an instant, continuous EKG-
like graph that shows averages for 
different groups – a station’s “core” 
listeners and its competitors’ listen-
ers, for instance. We’ve found this 
method (we call the test “BoltScan”) 
to be most useful in testing music 
in the original order that it actu-
ally aired, thereby showing us both 
popular songs that keep listeners 
tuned in, and the stuff that causes 
tune-out. It works the same way for 
testing morning shows, comedy bits, 
and so on.
3.	Call-out music research. This is 
a staple of radio programming. 
Respondents of a specific age and 
listening group – typically core listen-
ers in a tight age range – are called 
at home and asked to score 25–30 
hooks. The test is obviously short 
and can be conducted biweekly 
or even weekly. This information is 
most useful for trending the famili-
arity, popularity, and burnout of 
songs (usually new songs) over time. 
Callout is a task often assigned 
to station interns, but a number of 
research companies offer the service 
as well.
4.	Focus groups and listener panels. 
Focus groups are, of course, used 
for all kinds of consumer product 
testing, and radio is no exception. 
Again, respondents are screened 
for age and listenership. Chosen 
participants are paid a small incen-
tive and come to a focus group 
facility or hotel room in groups of 
8–12. Station staff observe while the 
moderator asks respondents about 
their likes and dislikes of station 
attributes, including music prefer-
ences, personalities, competing sta-
tions, etc.
Listener panels are more informal 
and are usually done in-house 
by the station. Respondents are 
recruited on the air or from the 
­station’s database. Again, respond-
ents are asked for their opinions 
about the station.
5.	Statistics. Although some compli-
cated statistical methods are some-
times used, the vast majority of data 
analysis involves “descriptive” statis-
tics: frequency and average scores. 
Frequency is a computation of how 
many people fit into a category 
or choose a given response to a 
question. Averages (mean, median, 
mode) are measures of average 
or typical performance. For most 
research reports, these basic statis-
tics are enough.
Some more sophisticated statistics 
are used to look for relation-
ships and differences between 
groups: ­correlation ANOVA 
(analysis of ­variance) t-tests, chi-
square, and cluster and factor 
analysis. For instance, we often 
use cluster ­analysis to separate 
respondents into distinct groups, 
such as Modern Rock and Classic 
Rock lovers. This helps a station 
to ­determine which artists are 
unique elements in a specific audi-
ence’s tastes.

Dwight Douglas.
Christopher Porter sees the fragmen-
tation and niching as creating a greater 
demand for research. “With the inevitabil-
ity of more competition in already over-
crowded markets, the need to stay abreast 
of market developments is critical. Yes, the 
role of research will continue to grow.”
Although the role of research in the pro-

The Future of Research in Radio
Most experts agree that the role of research 
in radio will continue to grow despite the 
trend toward downsizing and clustering. 
They base their predictions on the ever-
increasing fragmentation and niching of the 
listening audience, which makes the jobs 
of targeting and positioning more complex. 
“The field of broadcast research has grown 
considerably in the last two decades, and 
there is every reason to suspect that the 
growth will continue. As demographic 
targets and formats splinter, there will be 
an increasingly greater need to know. Much 
of the gut feel that has propelled radio 
Why do research? Not every radio 
programmer is a convert to the gospel 
of research. It is expensive, and sta-
tions are always on a tight budget. 
Many programmers have done just 
fine using experience and their gut 
to get them through. In addition, as 
people become more guarded with 
their privacy, both in terms of personal 
information and home invasion with the 
telephone, research becomes a more 
difficult and expensive proposition.
Yet, the market intelligence research 
provides is vital to the stations. As 
deregulation approaches, and station 
values skyrocket, gut feelings alone 
won’t be enough to keep a multimil-
lion dollar station on top. Research 
provides information that can make the 
gut feeling more of a sure thing or tell 
you that your gut is all wrong. But it is 
a tool, much as a computer or a tape 
recorder is. Even the best research is 
useless if it’s not studied and properly 
applied. Also, shoddy research can do 
a lot more harm than good.

in methodology and a greater diversity of 
applicable data as the result of high-tech 
innovations. I think the field of research will 
take a quantum leap in the years to come. 
It has in the past, but the size of the leap 
will be greater into the 2000s.”
Today it is common for stations to budget 
5–10% of their annual income to the 
research, and Christopher Porter believes 
it will probably increase. “As it evolves,” he 
says, “it is likely that the marketplace will 
demand that more funds be allocated for 
research purposes. Research may not guar-
antee success, but it’s not getting any easier 
to be successful without it.”
Research has been a part of radio broad-
casting since its modest beginnings in the 
1920s, and it appears that it will play an 
even greater role in the operations of sta-
tions as the new century deepens.
will be more movement there than in past. 
Call-out research will continue to be a 
mainstay for the small station.”
“Cost-effective ways to perform and 
utilize sophisticated psychographic data 
have made the computer standard equip-
ment at most stations, small and large alike. 
Research is becoming a way of life every-
where, and computers and station Web site 
are an integral part of the information age. 
Computers encourage more do-it-yourself 
research at stations, as well, and Web sites 
allow for the collection of data and the inter-
action with audience,” contends WGAO 
station manager Vic Michaels.
Gary Begin contends that advances in 
research technology also will continue to 
improve the nature and quality of research. 
“As with the portable ratings devices now 
being touted, we’ll see more improvement 
C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
1.  Beginning in the late 1920s, surveys were 
conducted to determine the most popular 
stations and programs with various audi-
ence groupings. Early surveys (and their 
methods) included C.E. Hooper, Inc. (tel-
ephone), CAB (telephone), and The Pulse 
(in-person). In 1968, RADAR (telephone to 
6000 households) began to provide informa-
tion for networks. The current leader among 
local market audience surveys is Arbitron 
(week-long diary).
2.  In 1963, the Broadcast Rating Council 
was established to monitor, audit, and 
accredit ratings companies. In 1982, it was 
renamed the Electronic Media Planning 
Council to reflect its involvement with 
cable television ratings. Renamed the Media 
Rating Council in 1997, it now represents 
Internet constituencies, as well as radio, TV, 
cable, and print.
3.  Arbitron measures listenership in the 
MSA, that is, the city or urban center, and 
the TSA, which covers the surrounding 
communities.
4.  A station’s primary listening locations are 
called ADI.
5.  The Arbitron daily diary logs time tuned 
to a stations; station call letters or program 
name; whether AM or FM; where listening 
occurred; and the listener’s age, sex, and 
area of residence.
6.  From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, 
Birch/Scarborough gathered data by calling 
equal numbers of male and female listen-
ers aged 12 and over. Clients were offered 
seven different report formats, including 
a computerized data retrieval system. The 
company went out of business on December, 
31, 1991.
7.  With today’s highly fragmented audi-
ences, advertisers and agencies are less com-
fortable buying just ratings numbers and 
look for audience qualities. Programmers 
must consider not only the age and sex of 
the target audience but also their lifestyles, 
values, and behavior.
8.  The PPM is a pager-size device that 
records radio audience listening patterns. 
Its creator, Arbitron, hopes it will eventu-
ally replace its long-used 7-day paper diary. 
The cell phone may well serve to record 
radio-listening habits as well.

computer, Web site, face-to-face, and mail 
methods.

dictate, what a station does.

ratings to determine the most cost-effective 
buy for their clients. Two methods they use 
are the cost per rating point (CPP) and the 
CPM.

numbers of broadcast research companies 
(several dozen nation wide) has created a 
growing job market, a college education 
is necessary. Courses in communications, 
research methods, statistics marketing, 
computers, and business are useful. Benefi-
cial personal traits include inquisitiveness, 
objectivity, perceptiveness, and interper-
sonal skills.

STRATEGY
With the introduction of PPM, there are now two rating methodologies by which stations are
evaluated. PPM conﬁrms much of our understanding of radio listening that came from the
diary methodology. At the same time, the panel-based nature of PPM yields new insights
into how consumers use radio over time compared to the results from the 1-week diary. 
Both methodologies reveal the importance of core listeners to radio stations. In both diary
and PPM, P1’s provide, on average, nearly two-thirds of the listening to a station. For all
intents and purposes, these P1’s are relatively loyal to their given station. As goes the
P1, so go the ratings. As a result, the most important strategic objective of the marketing
campaign continues to be directed at reinforcing the loyalty of existing P1’s and building
more. Effective marketing campaigns, whether PPM or diary-based are
• highly targeted to existing and potential P1’s; 
• focused, with a clear, beneﬁt-driven message and call-to-action;
• reinforced through varied, frequent, and repeated communications. 
PPM also provides new insights into consumers over time. For example, in the White Paper, 
“P1’s In A PPM World,” published by dmr, The University of Wisconsin’s A.C. Nielsen
Center for Marketing Research and Arbitron, all P1’s are not created equal. Some P1’s are
very light users of radio and some are very heavy users of radio. In fact, the heavy radio
listeners contribute 80–90% of the total amount of listening to the market, even though
they represent just 50% of the population. In addition, P1’s aren’t as loyal as we originally
assumed. Most P1’s switch with one other station, if they switch at all. Finally, PPM panels
are ongoing and reported monthly, as compared to quarterly with diaries. The ongoing
nature of PPM also serves to change the strategic planning of the marketing plan. 
Based on our new understanding of radio users through PPM, the following criteria
should be considered as part of an effective marketing campaign in PPM markets:
• identify and focus the message and media plan primarily on HEAVY radio listeners;
• develop a monthly or semimonthly plan to build and reinforce loyalty;
• develop and ongoing and interactive relationships with the Heavy and Loyal listeners.
The success of every marketing campaign is driven by its ability to
• target the appropriate and likely core listeners;
• present a message that provides a compelling and salient beneﬁt;
• delivered using a multilayered, multimedia approach designed to build loyalty. 
• Consistent and directed toward developing an ongoing and interactive relationship
TARGETING IS KEY
The key to any marketing communications plan is reaching the correct audience. No
matter what the composition of elements one uses, if the campaign is directed to the   
MARKETING GOALS
There are several objectives stations strive to reach when executing a marketing campaign.
For example: 
211

wrong consumer, it will waste time and money. In radio, there are several sophisticated
tools that help to precision-target the right consumers by their listening over a deﬁned
geographic area and in some cases by psychographical model. For the diary markets, 
these tools include Arbitron’s PD-Advantage, MapMaker, and Maximizer. Additionally, 
Nielsen’s PRIZM-coding classiﬁcation is also available. In PPM markets, Arbitron’s new
PDA-web and the PPM Analysis tool provide substantial insight into geographic targeting.
TARGETING GOALS
The targeting goal is threefold: (1) reach the best prospects for WXXX to produce new
P1’s or potential P1’s for the station in the targeted households; (2) maintain the current 
level of P1’s, and (3) cultivate more loyalty among the existing P1’s. 
Before we talk about the steps in the targeting analysis, let’s ﬁrst review the value of 
WXXX and the competitors’ heavy listeners. The concept of heavy users applies across
many different consumer categories. In his book, The End of Marketing As We Know It,
Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Ofﬁcer, Sergio Zyman said that much of the 50% increase in
Coca-Cola sales in just 5 years was driven by their strategy to gain and maintain heavy 
users of soft drinks (not just Coke P1’s). Zyman writes, “Heavy users are obviously more
proﬁtable than light users. So once you recognize them as a speciﬁc segment, you can
tailor your marketing to maintain and increase the usage of your heavy consumers and 
win your competitors’ heavy consumers… develop programs that address heavy users.” As 
we noted earlier, PPM underscores the strength and importance of heavy radio listeners
because while they are only 50% of the population, they account for nearly 90% of all
radio listening. With limited dollars and time, your marketing plan should be targeting 
the very small portion of the market who are P1’s and potential P1’s for your station and
are heavy users of radio. 
THE MESSAGE
Consumers receive, on average, more than 5000 commercial messages per day. To break
through, your message needs to be clear, beneﬁt-driven and action-oriented. In addition,
it should be anticipated, relevant, and expected. It is a waste of time to simply push
unwanted ads at consumers and expect them to embrace your marketing communications.
Today, it is more critical than ever to begin a relationship with your listeners or potential
listeners. The more personalized and relevant the message, the greater the likelihood that
the consumer will engage with it. In addition, marketing messages and communications 
must be authentic (believable and provable) and consistent across every touchpoint of 
your station brand. Too often marketing communications are separate and different
from the overall brand message or promise. Not only do those messages fall short of 
engagement, they may ultimately devalue the brand in the mind of the consumer. 
THE PLAN
Many marketing plans aren’t planned at all. They result from a short burst of necessity, 
budget availability, and or competitive behavior. As a result, they focus on a tactical
medium (TV, billboards, direct mail, etc.) rather than a strategic plan. To break through
to the consumer, your plan must have frequency, which reinforces the message you are
communicating. It also aids learning and engagement if it is delivered via multiple media.
Multiple component campaigns have a much greater likelihood of success. For example, 
Arbitron uses a multivaried approach to recruiting ratings households (in both diary and 
PPM) beginning ﬁrst with a postcard or letter survey, then following up with a live phone
call or voicemail, continuing with a conﬁrmation letter or postcard, etc. An effective plan
employs multiple elements to ensure the message is noticed and attended to by the target
consumer.

PERSONAL PHONE CALLS
Personal, live phone calls continue to be an efﬁcient and cost-effective way of identifying, 
targeting, and developing a relationship with P1’s and potential P1’s on a large scale
over a relatively short time period. The phone provides for the achievement of four steps
quickly: (1) impression, (2) awareness, (3) recall, and (4) sampling. For PPM, the value of 
the phone call is particularly signiﬁcant because of its ability to create a “take-action-now” 
immediate usage occasion, which will immediately register in PPM.
The personal call element of an integrated campaign can also capture radio usage level
and perceived loyalty as well as purchase habits, opinions, preferences, and other lifestyle
information. Once a station commits to obtaining this information, it will have initiated
an active database of loyal, heavy listeners – the foundation for an on-going interactive 
relationship. Unlike the shotgun approach of “everyone’s a target” from TV or billboards,
personal phone calls are much more effective because it essentially ﬁlters for the
households and consumers who are phone-responsive, rather than all people everywhere.
This is particularly important in PPM because of the added importance of the heavy loyal
P1’s who while representing just a small percentage of the cume contribute and drive as 
much as half the audience.
DIRECT MAIL
Direct mail is another valuable tool to include in an integrated marketing campaign.
Direct mail is personal, speciﬁc, and targeted to reinforce a station’s marketing position
and brand with a strong visual message. Direct mail can provide the continuity with print,
billboards, and web-based promotions. Types of direct mail include personalized laser-
printed letters with enclosures like magnets, coupon packets, reply cards, personalized
billboards, videos and DVDs, CDs, newsletters, calendars, and birthday and thank-you 
cards. New technologies and web integration have provided a whole new area of direct 
mail called Personalized Domains which allow the consumers name to be the foundation
of the Web site they’re directed to on the printed piece.
E-MAIL MARKETING
By using an e-mail marketing system, you can send individualized focused messages
instantly, with powerful attention-getting graphics or ﬂash animation to your database.
Some systems provide a built-in bounce-back and reply management to simplify the
backend operations. With database-driven e-mail systems, you can track activity levels and
engagement levels of your key listeners and segment those who are connectors. 
TEXT MESSAGING
Many campaigns today employ a text messaging component. Texting is particularly
valuable because it allows a consumer to take action immediately, not wait to send in a
card or log-in to a Web site, or call and try to get through. The key to adding a successful
text messaging component to your marketing campaign is to ask for a quick registration
at some point so that you can determine which members of your database are actively
using that channel. That can be done with a special bounce-back text driving the texting 
phone to a mobile Web site and/or a conventional site for a short entry. 
WEBFORM
Webforms are a critical component of a strong relationship marketing campaign and
initiative. By creating an enrollment form, you allow the listeners the chance to engage 
APPENDIX 6B: Tripp Eldredge, President Direct Marketing Results (dmr)	
213

Figure 6.25
Continued
and interact with the station. It’s also a perfect way to quickly gather usage and loyalty
information to help segment the database and focus on those heavy listeners. Once active, 
you can use the data to create more personalized domains as discussed in the direct mail
section above. Webforms are commonplace today, but it’s critical to keep them short and
relatively easy. It may also be important to have a mobile version depending on your
audience demographics.
INTERNET AND SEARCH MARKETING
The Internet enables delivery of personalized messages within targeted content and real-
time interaction. It’s an essential component to any effective marketing campaign because
of the interactivity and immediacy it provides. In particular, search marketing provides a
unique platform to connect and engage targeted consumers while online at work or at
home and engage quickly with the station and easily register for the station database. The
Internet also provides an excellent vehicle for word-of-mouth and pass-along advertising
particularly with its new social media component.
SOCIAL MEDIA
With the advent of MySpace and Facebook, social media has rocketed to the top of the
marketers’ tool kit. However, it’s relatively unknown or not well used by radio stations.
The basis for success of social media marketing is allowing your consumers or the
community to control part, or all, of the message instead of forcing or broadcasting
what you believe the message should be. Including a social media component to your
marketing plan is becoming more important because of the power and value of the
community. The objective of a social media component is to “join the conversation” that
consumers are (or can be) having about your brand and how it relates to their life. In
many cases, this rich and fertile sharing can be more valuable and far-reaching than any
conventional research you’re conducting. At the very least, it provides an avenue into the
natural patterns of communities that center around a radio station brand.
One particular social media tool that is growing dramatically with the ubiquitous nature
of the mobile phone is Twitter. Twitter provides a simple, yet powerful platform to enable
like-minded individuals to converse in 160-character bursts. Twitter conversations about
virtually anything (and in many cases, about radio stations) are happening right now on
Twitter. To see if they’re talking about a station you know, just go to search twitter.com

Chapter 6 research

broadcasters of the pretelevision era were 
just as determined to get the audience to 
take notice as they are today. From the 
start, stations used whatever was at hand to 
capture the public’s attention. Call letters 
were configured in such a way as to convey 
a particular sentiment or meaning: WEAF/
New York, Water, Earth, Air, Fire; WOW/
Omaha, Woodmen Of the World; and 
WIOD/Miami, Wonderful Isle Of Dreams. 
In addition, placards were affixed to vehi-
cles, buildings, and even blimps as a means 
of heightening the public’s awareness.
As ratings assumed greater prominence 
in the age of specialization, stations became 
even more cognizant of the need to promote. 
The relationship between good ratings and 
effective promotion became more appar-
ent. In the 1950s and 1960s, programming 
innovators such as Todd Storz and Gordon 
McLendon used promotions and contests 
with daring and skill, even a bit of lunacy, 
to win the attention of listeners.
The growth of radio promotion has par-
alleled the proliferation of frequencies. 
“The more stations you have out there, 
the greater the necessity to promote. Let’s 
face it, a lot of stations are doing about 
the same thing. A good promotion sets you 
apart. It gives you greater identity, which 
means everything when a survey company 
asks a listener what station he or she tunes. 
Radio is an advertising medium in and of 
itself. Promotion makes a station salable. 
You sell yourself so that you have some-
thing to sell advertisers,” observes Las Vegas 
radio station promotion director (also called 
­promotion manager) Charlie Morriss. Sta-
tions that once confined the bulk of their 
Promotion 7
Past and Purpose
In the fiercely competitive audio mar-
ketplace, radio stations must of necessity 
resort to heavy-handed self-aggrandizement. 
“WXXX – the station without equal,” “For 
the best in music and news tune WXXX,” 
or “You’re tuned to the music giant – 
WXXX” certainly illustrate this point. Why 
must ­stations ­practice self-glorification? The 
answer is simple: to keep the listener inter-
ested and tuned. The highly fragmented 
radio ­marketplace has made promotion a 
basic component of station operations. Five 
times as many stations vie for the listen-
ing audience today as did when television 
arrived on the scene. It is competition that 
makes promotion necessary.
Small and large stations alike promote 
and market themselves. In the single-station 
market, stations promote to counter the 
effects of other media, especially the local 
newspaper, which often is the archrival 
of small-town outlets. Since there is only 
one station to tune to, promotion serves to 
maintain listener interest in the medium. In 
large markets, where three stations may be 
offering the same format, promotion helps 
a station differentiate itself from the rest. In 
this case, the station with the best promo-
tion often wins the ratings war.
Radio recognized the value of promotion 
early. In the 1920s and 1930s, stations used 
newspapers and other print media to inform 
the public of their existence. Remote broad-
casts from hotels, theaters, and stores also 
attracted attention for stations and were 
a popular form of promotion during the 
medium’s golden age. Promotion-conscious

Johnny Rabbitt. It would be hard to calcu-
late the number of deejays who have lived 
atop flagpoles or in elevators for the sake of 
a rating point.
In the 1980s, the shenanigans ­continued. 
To gain the listening public’s attention, a 
California deejay set a world record by 
sitting  in every seat of a major league 
­ballpark that held 65,000 spectators. In 
the process of the stunt, the publicity 
hungry deejay injured his leg. However, he 
went on to accomplish his goal by garner-
ing national attention for himself and his 
station. Another station offered to give away 
a mobile home to contestants who camped 
out the longest on a platform at the base 
of a billboard. The challenge turned into 
a battle of wills as three contestants spent 
months trying to outlast each other. In the 
end, one of the three was disqualified, and 
the station, in an effort to cease what had 
become more of an embarrassment than 
anything else, awarded the two holdouts 
recreational vehicles.
Today, promotions have gotten edgier, 
especially on those stations featuring shock 
jock shows. Things can and do get out of 
hand when personalities go to the extreme to 
draw listeners’ attention with on-air pranks 
and giveaways. Prior to migrating to satellite, 
Howard Stern held all manner of scatologi-
cal promotions and contests, many centered 
around women removing their clothes, and 
Opie and Anthony asked ­listeners to have 
sex in public places. This ultimately got them 
removed from the air, thus proving there are 
limits to what a station can do to get atten-
tion from an audience. Of course, after a 
successful stint (or exile) on satellite radio, 
the duo was hired back by terrestrial radio – 
proving again that ratings matter most. The 
tone and tenor of station promotions have 
certainly changed over the decades, notes 
Larry Miller. “Although occurring in what 
now seems a gentler and kinder world, my 
personal favorite is the one about a station 
in LA in the early 1950s that sent out a ‘free 
Valhalla Oil credit card’ to listeners. Well, 
there was no such oil company, but loyal 
listeners nevertheless spent a good deal of 
time searching for a Valhalla gas station. 
Everybody had a laugh.”

promotional effort to spring and fall to coin-
cide with rating periods now find it neces-
sary to engage in promotional campaigns on 
an ongoing basis throughout the year, notes 
Morriss. “More competition and monthly 
audience surveys mean that stations have 
to keep the promotion fire burning continu-
ally, the analogy being that if the flame goes 
out you’re likely to go cool in the ratings. 
So you really have to hype your outlet every 
opportunity you get. The significance of the 
role of promotion in contemporary radio 
cannot be overstated.”
The vital role that promotion plays in 
radio is not likely to diminish as hundreds 
of more stations enter the airways by the 
turn of the century.
“Promotion has become as much a part 
of radio as the records and the deejays who 
spin them, and that’s not about to change,” 
contends promotion director John Grube.
Promotions – Practical  
and Bizarre
The idea behind any promotion is to win 
listeners. Over the years, stations have used 
a variety of methods, ranging from the 
conventional to the outlandish, to accom-
plish this goal. “If a promotion achieves 
top-of-the-mind awareness in the listener, 
it’s a winner. Granted, some strange things 
have been done to accomplish this,” admits 
­Mississippi broadcaster Bob Lima.
Promotions designed to captivate the 
interest of the radio audience have inspired 
some pretty bizarre schemes. In the 1950s, 
Dallas station KLIF placed overturned cars 
on freeways with a sign on their undersides 
announcing the arrival of a new deejay, 
216	
CHAPTER 7 Promotion

“As a publicity stunt and also to get 
people to use the local public library, a 
station in Ft. Worth, Texas, a couple years 
back announced it had hidden cash in 
small denominations in the fiction section. 
Approximately 800 people descended on 
the library and proceeded to pull books 
off the shelves looking for the money. The 
library had not been notified that the station 
was going to make the announcement, and 
it was totally taken by surprise. The librarian 
said that approximately 4000 books were 
pulled from the shelves – some of them 
had pages torn out – and that people were 
climbing on the bookcases and making a 
tremendous mess. The station was forced to 
make a public apology, and it promised full 
financial restitution.”

Promotions – Practical and Bizarre 	
217

One of the most infamous examples of a 
promotion gone bad occurred when a station 
decided to air-drop dozens of turkeys to a 
waiting crowd of listeners in a neighbor-
hood shopping center parking lot. Unfortu-
nately, the station discovered too late that 
turkeys are not adept at flying at heights 
above 30 feet. Consequently, several cars 
were damaged and witnesses were trauma-
tized as turkeys plunged to the ground. This 
promotion-turned-nightmare was depicted 
in an episode of the television sitcom WKRP 
in Cincinnati.
The list of glitches is seemingly endless. 
In the late 1960s, a station in central 
­Massachusetts asked listeners to predict how 
long its air personality could ride a carousel 
at a local fair. The hardy airman’s effort was 
cut short on day 3 when motion sickness got 
the best of him and he vomited on a crowd 
of spectators and newspaper photographers. 
A station in California came close to disaster 
when a promotion that challenged listeners 
to find a buried treasure resulted in half 
the community being dug up by overzeal-
ous contestants. In Massachusetts, a station 
invited listeners to retrieve money-filled 
balloons dropped by helicopters into the 
surf, and contestants came close to drown-
ing as the balloons floated out to sea.
These promotions did indeed capture 
the attention of the public, but in each 
case, the station’s image was somewhat tar-
nished. The axiom that any publicity, good 
or bad, is better than none at all can get 
a station into hot water, contends station 
promotion director Chuck Davis. “It’s great 
to get lots of exposure for the station, but 
if it makes the station look foolish, it can 
work against you.”
The vast majority of radio contests and 
promotions are of a more practical nature 
and run without too many complica-
tions. Big prizes, rather than stunts, tend 
to draw the most interest and thus are 
offered by stations able to afford them. 
In the mid-1980s, WASHAM, ­Washington, 
DC, and KSSK-AM, Honolulu, both gave 
a lucky listener a million dollars. Cash 
prizes always have attracted tremendous 
response. ­Valuable prizes other than cash 
also can boost ratings. For example, Los 
Angeles station KHTZ-AM experienced a 
sizable jump in its ratings when it offered 
listeners a chance to win a $122,000 house 
(this was a decade ago). Increased ratings 
also resulted when KHJ-AM, Los Angeles, 
gave away a car every day during the month 
of May.
Promotions that involve prizes, both large 
and small, spark audience interest, says 
Rick Peters, vice president of programming, 
Sconnix Broadcasting. “People love to win 
something or, at least, feel that they have 
a shot at winning a prize. That’s basic to 
human nature, I believe. You really don’t 
have to give away two city blocks, either. 
A listener usually is thrilled and delighted 
to win a pair of concert tickets.”
Although numerous examples can be 
cited to support the view that big prizes 
get big audiences, there is also ample evi-
dence that low-budget giveaways, involv-
ing T-shirts, albums, tickets, posters, dinners, 
FIGURE 7.3

CHAPTER 7 Promotion

and so forth, are very useful in building 
and maintaining audience interest. In fact, 
some surveys have revealed that smaller, 
more personalized prizes may work better 
for a station than the high-priced items. 
iPods, concert tickets, and dinners-for-two 
rank among the most popular contest 
prizes, according to surveys. Cheaper items 
usually also mean more numerous or fre-
quent giveaways.
The Promotion Director’s/
Manager’s Job
Not all stations employ a full-time promo-
tion director. But most stations designate 
someone to handle promotional responsi-
bilities. At small outlets, the program direc-
tor (PD) or even the general manager (GM) 
assumes promotional chores. Larger stations 
and station clusters with bigger operating 
budgets typically hire an individual or indi-
viduals to work exclusively in the area of 
promotion. “At major-market stations, you’ll 
find a promotion department that includes 
a director and possibly assistants. In mid-
dle-sized markets, such as ours, the promo-
tion responsibility is often designated to 
someone already involved in programming,” 
says Bob Lima.
Observes Ed Shane: “Some promotion 
managers consider themselves ‘market-
ing directors.’ There are two levels of job 
responsibility for promotion people. Some 
are glorified ‘banner hangers,’ who make 
sure the grunt work is done at a station pro-
motion or a live broadcast. Others are true 
department heads who exhibit leadership 
and vision within their operations.”
Indeed the promotion director’s respon-
sibilities are manifold. Essential to the posi-
tion are a knowledge and understanding 
of the station’s audience. A background 
in research is important, contends Grube. 
“Before you can initiate any kind of pro-
motion you must know something about 
who you’re trying to reach. This requires 
an ability to interpret various research data 
that you gather through in-house survey 
efforts or from outside audience research 
companies, like Birch and Arbitron. You 
don’t give away beach balls to 50-year-old 
men. Ideas must be confined to the cell 
group you’re trying to attract.”
Writing and conceptual skills are vital to 
the job of promotion director, says Morriss. 
“You prepare an awful lot of copy of all 
types. One moment you’re composing press 
releases about programming changes, and 
the next you’re writing a 30-second promo 
about the station’s expanded news cover-
age or upcoming remote broadcast from a 
local mall. Knowledge of English grammar 
is a must. Bad writing reflects negatively on 
the station. The job also demands imagina-
tion and creativity. You have to be able 
to come up with an idea and bring it to 
fruition.”
Chuck Davis agrees with Morriss and 
adds that although the promotion person 
should be able to originate concepts, a 
certain number of ideas come from the 
trades and other stations. “When this is the 
case, and it often is, you have to know how 
to adapt an idea to suit your own station. 
Of course, the promotion must reflect your 
location. Lifestyles vary almost by region. 
A promotion that’s successful at a station 
in Louisiana may bear no relevance to a 
station with a similar format in Michigan. 
On the other hand, with some adjust-
ments, it may work as effectively there. 
The creativity in this example exists in the 
adaptation.”
Promotion directors must be versatile. 
A familiarity with graphic art generally is 
necessary, since the promotion director will 
be involved in developing station logos and 
image IDs for advertising in the print media

­sponsors and station promotions,” contends 
Morriss.
Like other radio station department 
heads, it is the promotion director’s respon-
sibility to ensure that the rules and regula-
tions established by the FCC, relevant to 
the promotions area, are observed. This will 
be discussed further later in the chapter, in 
the section Promotions and the FCC.
and billboards. The promotion department 
also participates in the design and prepara-
tion of visuals for the sales area.
The acquisition of prize materials through 
direct purchase and trades is another duty 
of the promotion person, who also may be 
called on to help co-ordinate sales co-op 
arrangements. “You work closely with 
the sales manager to arrange tie-ins with

been a very soft market, it makes sense to 
­acknowledge the value and ­importance of an 
effective promotion ­(marketing) director.”
Who Promotion  
Directors Hire
In each section devoted to hiring in preced-
ing and subsequent chapters, college train-
ing is listed as a desirable, if not necessary, 
attribute. This is no less true in the area 
of radio station promotion. “My advice to 
an individual interested in becoming a pro-
motion person would be to get as much 
formal training as possible in marketing, 
research, graphics, writing, public relations, 
and, of course, broadcasting. The duties of 
Of course, it is important that a promo-
tion director maintains a high level of com-
munication with other station personnel, 
particularly the program director and sales 
manager, who are almost always an inte-
gral part of a promotion’s execution and 
implementation. Everyone should be in the 
know-about contests and promotions.
On a final note (corroborating Ed Shane’s 
preceding contention), Lynn Christian 
observes that “The word marketing has 
become the rallying cry today. At a BPME 
meeting the question was raised as to 
whether a promotion director should be 
designated ‘marketing director,’ and given 
upgraded status in a station – that is, parity 
with the program director and sales manager. 
In the light of the horrendous competi-
tion and the  need to survive in what has

­promotion. Broadcasters already possess 
the best possible vehicle to reach listen-
ers, and so it should come as no surprise 
that on-air promotion is the most common 
means of getting the word out on a station. 
The challenge confronting the promotion 
director is how to most effectively market 
the station so as to expand and retain lis-
tenership. To this end, a number of pro-
motional devices are employed, beginning 
with the most obvious – station call letters. 
“The value of a good set of call letters 
is inestimable,” says KGLD’s Bremkamp. 
“A good example is the call letters of a 
station I once managed which have long 
been associated with the term rich and 
all that it implies: ‘Hartford’s Rich Music 
Station – WRCH.’”
Call letters convey the personality of a 
station. For instance, try connecting these 
call letters with a format: WHOG, WNWS, 
WEZI, WODS, WJZZ, WIND, and WHTS. 
If you guessed Country, News, Easy Listen-
ing, Oldies, Jazz, Talk, and Hits, you were 
correct. The preceding call letters not only 
identify their radio stations but they liter-
ally convey the nature or content of the 
programming offered.
Larry Miller adds, “Anything that can be 
made to spell ‘KISS’ is always a favorite 
with listeners, starting with a KISS station 
in the Northwest back in the 1950s. Other 
similar calls include ‘Magic’ for a soft AC, 
‘Zoo’ for a wild and crazy CHR or Hot 
AC, or ‘Rock’ as in K-Rock. In Hawaii, 
calls that spell Hawaiian words have 
always been popular, such as K-POI. In 
the early 1970s, the ABC group of O&O 
FMs changed call letters to reflect ‘hip’ or 
local culture with calls like KLOS in LA or 
KSFX in San Francisco or WRIF in Detroit 
or WPLJ (white port and lemon juice) in 
New York.”
When stations do not possess call letters 
that create instant recognition, they often 
couple their frequency with a call letter 
or two, such as JB-105 (WPJB-FM 105) 
or ­KISS-108 (WXKS-FM 108). This also 
improves the retention factor. Slogans 
frequently are a part of the on-air ID. 
“Music Country – WSOC-FM, Charlotte,” 
“A Touch of Class – WTEB-FM, New 
Bern,” and “Texas Best Rock – KTXQ-FM, 
Fort Worth” are some examples. Slogans 
the promotion director, especially at a large 
station, are diverse,” notes Rick Peters of 
TK Communications.
Charlie Morriss agrees with Peters and 
adds, “A manager reviewing the credentials 
of candidates for a promotion position will 
expect to find a statement about formal 
training, that is, college. Of course, nothing 
is a substitute for a solid track record. Expe-
rience is golden. This is a very hands-on 
field. My advice today is to get a good edu-
cation and along the way pick up a little 
experience, too.”
Familiarity with programming is impor-
tant, contends Lima, who suggests that pro-
spective promotion people spend some time 
on the air. “Part-timing it on mic at a station, 
be it a small commercial outlet or a college 
facility, gives a person special insight into the 
nature of the medium that he or she is pro-
moting. Working in sales also is valuable. In 
the ­specific skills department, I’d say the pro-
motion job candidate should have an eye for 
detail, be well organized, and possess exem-
plary writing skills. It goes without saying that 
a positive attitude and genuine appreciation 
of radio are important as well.”
Both John Grube and Chuck Davis cite 
wit and imagination as criteria for the job 
of promotion. “It helps to be a little wacky 
and crazy. By that I mean able to conceive 
of entertaining, fun concepts,” says Grube. 
Davis concurs, “This is a convivial medium. 
The idea behind any promotion or contest 
is to attract and amuse the listener. A zany, 
off-the-wall idea is good, as long as it is 
based in sound reasoning. Calculated crazi-
ness requires common sense and creativity, 
and both are qualities you need in order to 
succeed in promotion.”
The increasing competition in the radio 
marketplace has bolstered job opportuni-
ties in promotion. Thus, the future appears 
bright for individuals planning careers in 
this facet of the medium.
Types of Promotions
There are two primary categories of 
station promotions: on-air and off-air. 
The on-air category will be examined first 
since it is the most prevalent form of radio 
222	
CHAPTER 7 Promotion

A contest must be designed to enhance 
a station’s overall sound or format. It 
must fit in, be compatible. Obviously, 
a mystery sound contest requiring the 
broadcast of loud or shrill noises would 
disrupt the tranquility and continuity of 
an Easy ­Listening station and result in 
tune-out.
Successful contests are timely and 
relevant to the lifestyle of the station’s 
target audience, says Bob Lima. “A contest 
should offer prizes that truly connect with 
the listener. An awareness of the needs, 
desires, and fantasies of the listener will 
help guide a station. For example, giving 
away a refrigerator on a hot hit station 
would not really captivate the 16-year-old 
tuned. This is obvious, of course. But the 
point I’m making is that the prizes that 
are up for grabs should be something the 
listener really wants to win, or you have 
apathy.”
The importance of creativity already has 
been stated. Contests that attract the most 
attention often are the ones that challenge 
the listener’s imagination, contends Morriss. 
“A contest should have style, should attempt 
to be different. You can give away what 
is perfectly suitable for your audience, but 
you can do it in a way that creates excite-
ment and adds zest to the programming. 
The goal of any promotion is to set you 
apart from the other guy. Be daring within 
reason, but be daring.”
­exemplify a ­station’s image. When effec-
tive, they capture the mood and flavor 
of the station and leave a strong impres-
sion in the listener’s mind. It is standard 
programming policy at many stations to 
announce the station’s call letters and 
even its slogan each time a deejay opens 
the microphone. This is especially true 
during ratings sweeps when survey com-
panies ask listeners to identify the sta-
tions they tune into. “If your calls stick in 
the mind of your audience, you’ve hit a 
home run. If they don’t, you’ll go score-
less in the book. You’ve got to carve them 
into the listener’s gray matter and you 
start by making IDs and signatures that 
are as memorable as possible,” observes 
Rick Peters.
Jay Williams, Jr., observes that call letters 
are being used less and less in the digital 
age. “Stations identify themselves using their 
frequencies (92.5) today more than their call 
letters. This has become the case since the 
radio dial became digitized. The emphasis is 
now more numerical than alphabetical. Even 
the alphanumeric approach (Magic 92) has 
faded in favor of simply stating the station’s 
frequency.”
It is a common practice for stations 
to “bookend” – place call letters and/or 
frequencies before and after all breaks 
between music. For example, “WHJJ. Stay 
tuned for a complete look at local and 
national news at the top of the hour on 
WHJJ.” Deejays also are told to graft the 
station call letters onto all bits of infor-
mation: “92.9 Time,” “102.5 Temperature,” 
“102.5 Weather,” and so on. There is a 
rule  in radio that call letters can never 
be overannounced. The logic behind this 
is clear. The more a station tells its audi-
ence what it is tuned to, the more apt it 
is to remember, especially during rating 
periods.
On-air contests are another way to cap­
ture and hold the listener’s attention. Con-
tests must be easy to understand (are the 
rules and requirements of the contest easily 
understood by the listener?) and possess 
entertainment value (will non­participants 
be amused even though they are not actu-
ally involved?). A contest should engage the 
interest of all listeners, players and nonplay-
ers alike.

on. For example, a station might announce 
a name three times a day for a chance to 
win $1000. ‘We’d like to thank John Smith 
for listening to Classic Rock WXYZ.’ Then 
this person would have 20 minutes to call 
in and win and since only he can win, he’s 
not ­competing with the whole city to get 
through on the phone. Plus, he feels impor-
tant that he’s eligible to win a special contest 
from the station. In the end, of course, a 
great promotion makes people want to tune 
the station.”
Radio stations employ off-air promo-
tional techniques to reach people not 
tuned in. Billboards are a popular form of 
outside promotion. To be effective, they 
must be both eye-catching and simple. 
Only so much can be stated on a billboard, 
since people generally are in a moving 
vehicle and have only a limited amount 
of time to absorb a message. Placement 
of the billboard also is a key factor. To be 
effective, billboards must be located where 
they will reach a station’s intended audi-
ence. Although an All-News station would 
avoid the use of a billboard facing a high 
school, a rock music outlet may prefer the 
location.
Bus cards are a good way to reach the 
public. Cities often have hundreds of buses 
on the streets each day. Billboard compa-
nies also use benches and transit shelters 
to get their client’s message across to the 
population. Outside advertising is an effec-
tive and fairly cost-efficient way to promote 
On-air promotion is used to inform the 
audience of what a station has to offer: station 
personalities, programs, and special features 
and events. Rarely does a ­quarter-hour 
pass on any station that does not include 
a promo that highlights some aspect of 
programming:
“Tune in WXXX’s News at Noon each 
weekday for a full hour of …”
“Irv McKenna keeps ‘Nightalk’ in the 
air midnight to six on the voice of the 
valley – WXXX. Yes, there’s never a dull 
moment …”
“Every Saturday night WXXX turns the 
clock back to the fifties and sixties to bring 
you the best of the golden oldies …”
“Hear the complete weather forecast on 
the hour and half hour throughout the day 
and night on your total service station – 
XXX …”
On-air promotion is a cost-efficient and 
effective means of building an audience 
when done correctly, says John Grube. 
“There are good on-air promotions and weak 
or ineffective on-air promotions. The latter 
can inflict a deep wound, but the former 
can put a station on the map. As broadcast-
ers, the airtime is there at our disposal, but 
we sometimes forget just how potent an 
advertising tool we have.”
Marketing expert Andrew Curran points 
to another area of promotion. “A stealth 
promotion might include members of the 
station database and is something that only 
the people eligible to win know is going

CHAPTER 7 Promotion

to their television promotion as a contribut-
ing factor.
Bumper stickers are manufactured by 
the millions for distribution by practi-
cally every commercial radio station in the 
country. The primary purpose of stickers is 
to increase call letter awareness. Over the 
years, bumper stickers have developed into 
a unique pop-art form, and hundreds of 
people actually collect station decals as a 
hobby. Some station bumper stickers are 
particularly prized for the lifestyle or image 
they portray. Youths, in particular, are fond of 
displaying their favorite station’s call letters. 
Stations appealing to older demographics 
find that their audiences are somewhat less 
enthusiastic about bumper stickers.
Stations motivate listeners to display 
bumper stickers by tying them in with 
on-air promotions:
WXXX WANTS TO GIVE YOU A 
THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALL YOU HAVE 
TO DO IS PUT AN X-100 BUMPER 
STICKER ON YOUR CAR TO BE ELIGI-
BLE. IT’S THAT SIMPLE. WHEN YOUR 
CAR IS SPOTTED BY THE X-100 ROVING 
EYE, YOUR LICENSE NUMBER WILL 
BE  ANNOUNCED OVER THE AIR. YOU 
WILL THEN HAVE THIRTY MINUTES TO 
CALL THE STATION TO CLAIM YOUR 
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS….
Hundreds of ways have been invented to 
entice people to display station call letters. 
The idea is to get the station’s name out 
to the public, and 10,000 cars exhibiting a 
­station’s bumper sticker is an effective way 
to do that. Says Ed Shane, “Visibility is part of  
the answer. Station promotion has reached 
new levels of creativity and ­intrusion –  
skateboard jumpers, rolling radios, inflata-
bles in the boots, guitars, frogs.”
Stations give away thousands of items dis-
playing station call letters and logos annu-
ally. Among the most common promotional 
items handed out by stations are posters, 
T-shirts, calendars, key chains, coffee mugs, 
music hit lists, book covers, pens, and car 
litter bags. The list is vast.
Plastic card promotions have done well 
for many stations. Holders are entitled to 
a variety of benefits, including discounts 
at various stores and valuable prizes. The 
bearer is told to listen to the station for 
a radio station, although certain billboards 
at heavy traffic locations can be extremely 
expensive to lease.
Newspapers are the most frequent 
means of off-air promotion. Stations like 
the reach and targeting that newspapers 
can provide. In large metro areas, alter-
native newspapers, such as the Boston 
Phoenix, are  very effective in deliver-
ing certain listening cells. The Phoenix 
enjoys one of the largest readerships of 
any independent press in the country. Its 
huge ­college-age and young  professional 
audience makes it an ideal promotional 
medium for ­stations after those particular 
demographics. Although the readership of 
the more conventional newspapers tradi-
tionally is low among young people, it is 
high in older adults, making the mainstream 
publications useful to stations targeting the 
over-40 crowd.
Newspapers 
with 
large 
circulations 
provide a great way to reach the popula-
tion at large, but they also can be very costly, 
although some stations are able to trade 
airtime for print space. Newspaper ads must 
be large enough to stand out and overcome 
the sea of advertisements that often share 
the same page. Despite some drawbacks, 
newspapers usually are the first place radio 
broadcasters consider when planning an 
off-air promotion.
Television is a costly but effective pro-
motional tool for radio. A primary advan-
tage that television offers is the chance 
to target the audience that the station is 
after. An enormous amount of information 
is available pertaining to television viewer-
ship. Thus, a station that wants to reach 
the 18–24 year olds is able to ascertain the 
programs and features that best draw that 
particular cell.
The costs of producing or acquiring 
ready-made promos for television can run 
high, but most radio broadcasters value the 
opportunity to actually show the public 
what they can hear when they tune to 
their station. WBZ-AM in Boston used local 
television extensively to promote its former 
morning personality, Dave Maynard, and 
its current sunrise news team. Ratings for 
the Westinghouse-owned station have been 
consistently high, and management points

information as to where to use the card. 
In addition, holders are eligible for special 
on-air drawings.
Another particularly effective way to 
increase a station’s visibility is to sponsor 
special activities, such as fairs, sporting events, 
theme dances, and concerts. ­Hartford’s Big 
Band station, WRCQ-AM, has received 
­significant attention by presenting an annual 
music festival that has attracted over 25,000 
spectators each year, plus the notice of other 
media, including television and newspapers.
Personal appearances by station person-
alities are one of the oldest forms of off-air 
promotion but still a very effective one.

Remote broadcasts from malls, beaches, and 
the like also aid in getting the word of the 
station out to the public.
One last means of marketing a station is 
offered by Jay Williams, Jr., CEO, Direct 
Marketing Results: “Promotion and market-
ing have never been more critical. In the 
current economy, stations have to do every-
thing they can to draw and hold an audi-
ence. Direct marketing through mail and/
or by telephone is a very cost-effective way 
to target an audience and to keep a station 
in front of radio listeners, ­especially during 
rating periods. Telepromoting is becom-
ing more prevalent. Directed or targeted 
226	
CHAPTER 7 Promotion

­marketing makes sense because stations 
must be more ­effective with what they have. 
The ­business of radio is changing. Audiences 
are fragmenting, brand loyalties are eroding. 
Mass marketing is losing its impact. Person-
to-person or individualized marketing deliv-
ers tangible results.”
Ed Shane concurs with Williams, adding, 
“Direct marketing is the wave of the one-
to-one future. More direct mail, telemarket-
ing, database management, and computer 
interaction.”
Sales Promotion
Promoting a station can be very costly, as 
much as half a million dollars annually in 
some metro markets. To help defray the 
cost of station promotion, advertisers are 
often recruited. This way both the station 
and the sponsor stand to benefit. The 
station gains the financial wherewithal to 
execute certain promotions that it could 
not do on its own, and the participating 
advertiser gains valuable exposure by tying 
in with special station events. Stations 
­actually can make money and promote 
themselves simultaneously if a client pur-
chases a substantial spot schedule as part of 
a ­promotional package. Says Larry Miller, 
“An effective promotional campaign should 
try to include a sales component, in part 
to help allay the costs of advertising. If it’s 
done right, it will bring in new business for 
the station.”
There are abundant ways to involve adver-
tisers in station promotion efforts. They run 
the gamut from placing advertisements and 
coupons on the back of bumper stickers to 
joining the circus for the day; for example, 
“WXXX brings the ‘Greatest Show on 
Earth’ to town this Friday night, and you go 
for half price just by mentioning the name 
of your favorite radio station – WXXX.” 
The ultimate objective of a station/sponsor 
collaborative is to generate attention in a 
cost-efficient manner. If a few dollars are 
made for the station along the way, all the 
better.
As stated previously, the promotion 
director also works closely with the sta-
tion’s sales department in the preparation 
and design of sales promotion materials, 
which include items such as posters, cover-
age maps, ratings breakouts, flyers, station 
profiles, rate cards, and much more.

Selling Promotions
Marketing is changing. Twenty 
years ago, 70% of marketing was 
advertising. It’s now 40%. It may be 
20% in 10 years. Direct to consumer, 
B to B, events, and branding are 
replacing advertising in many cases. 
Radio needs to get more of the pro-
motion dollars and not rely on just 
advertising. Radio can deliver results 
for advertisers, and it can promote 
effectively if it reaches a desirable 
audience. Radio stations must select 
a target audience available to them 
given the constraints of the signal and 
competition environment. The best 
stations feature programming that is 
different, desirable, and difficult to 
duplicate. Too many managers have 
made stations generic in an effort 
to cut costs. This is a mistake. I can 
hear my favorite music on a personal 
device without commercials.

including radio. Each of these three areas 
presents the promotion director with ques-
tions that must be addressed before launch-
ing a campaign. As stated earlier in this 
chapter, it is imperative that the promotion 
or contest fit the station’s sound – in other 
words, be compatible with the format. This 
accomplished, the next consideration is the 
relevancy of the promotion to the station’s 
audience. For example, does it fit the listen-
er’s lifestyle? Third, is the idea fresh enough 
in the market to attract and sustain interest?
Observes programming executive Corinne 
Baldassano, “You must institute ongoing 
research to make sure your target audi-
ence is happy with what it’s hearing. You 
can make adjustments depending on the 
feedback you get from the research. Those 
stations that have succeeded have been sin-
gle-minded in their desire to achieve their 
goals. They establish a market position and 
do everything they can to fulfill audience 
expectations. The other major ingredient 
for success with promotions is fun. You 
have to have fun with the promotion while 
you’re doing all the work. If you and your 
staff have a good time, it is conveyed to the 
listeners and potential advertisers. It makes 
a station hard to beat.”
Concerning the basic mechanics of the 
contest, the general rule is that if it takes a 
long time to explain, it is not appropriate 
for radio. “Contests that require too much 
explanation don’t work well in our medium. 
That is not to say that they have to be thin 
and one-dimensional. On the contrary, radio 
contests can be imaginative and captivat-
ing without being complicated or complex,” 
notes John Grube.
The planning and implementation of 
certain promotions may require the involve-
ment of consultants who possess the exper-
tise to ensure smooth sailing. Contests can 
turn into bad dreams if potential problems 
are not anticipated. Rick Sklar, who served 
as program director for WABC in New York 
for nearly 20 years, was responsible for some 
of the most successful radio promotions 
ever devised, but not all went without a 
hitch. In his autobiographical book, Rocking 
America (St. Martin’s Press, 1984), Sklar 
told of the time that he was forced to hire, 
at great expense, 60 office temporaries for a 
period of 1 month to count the more than 
Research and Planning
To effectively promote a station, the indi-
vidual charged with the task must possess 
a thorough knowledge of the station and its 
audience. This person must then ascertain 
the objective of the promotion. Is it the 
aim of the promotion to increase call letter 
awareness, introduce a new format/feature/
personality, or bolster the station’s com-
munity service image? Of course, the ulti-
mate goal of any promotion is to enhance 
listenership.
Effective promotions take into account 
both internal and external factors. An under-
standing of the product, consumer, and com-
petition is essential to any marketing effort,

CHAPTER 7 Promotion

Careful planning during the develop-
mental phase of a promotion generally will 
prevent any unpleasant surprises, says Bob 
Lima. “Practical and hypothetical projec-
tions should be made. Radio can fool you by 
its pulling power. If a promotion catches on, 
it can exceed all expectations. You’ve got to 
be prepared for all contingencies. These are 
nice problems to have, but you can get egg 
on your face. Take a good look at the long 
and short of things before you bolt from the 
starting gate. Don’t be too hasty or quick 
to execute. Consider all the variables, then 
proceed with care.”
Lima tells of a successful promotion at 
WVMI that required considerable organiza-
tion and planning. “We called it ‘The Great 
Easter Egg Hunt.’ What was basically an 
Easter egg hunt at a local park here in Biloxi 
attracted over 11,000 people. A local bottler 
co-sponsored the event and provided many 
of the thousands of dollars in prizes. The 
station hyped the event for several weeks 
over the air, and a little off-air promotion 
was done. The reason the promotion worked 
so well is that there actually was a need for 
a large, well-organized Easter event. We did 
our homework in selecting and executing 
this promotion, which turned out to be a 
big winner.”
Charlie Morriss shares an account of a 
successful promotion at radio station KOMP. 
170 million ballots received in response to 
the station’s “Principal of the Year” contest. 
The previous year the station had received 
a paltry 6 million ballots.
On another occasion, Sklar had over 
4  million WABC buttons manufactured 
as part of a promotion that awarded up 
to $25,000 in cash to listeners spotted 
wearing one. What Sklar did not antici-
pate was the huge cost involved in ship-
ping several million metal buttons from 
various points around the country. The 
station had to come up with thousands 
of unbudgeted dollars to cover air freight. 
Of course, both miscalculations were miti-
gated by the tremendous success of the 
promotions, which significantly boosted 
WABC’s ratings.
An even more bizarre experience befell 
Dallas deejay Ron Chapman when he jok-
ingly asked listeners to send $20 without 
explaining why. The listening faithful, 
assuming Chapman’s request to be a part 
of a legitimate station promotion, mailed in 
nearly a quarter of a million dollars. This left 
the station (KVIL-FM) with the interesting 
problem of what to do with the money. 
“We’re flabbergasted,” exclaimed Chapman. 
“We never expected this to happen.” The 
moral to this tale is never underestimate 
the power of the medium. Plan before 
implementing.

listening stopped and got out of their car 
to check their license plate to see if they had 
won. This caused a monumental traffic jam, 
and the authorities were not pleased.”
The point already has been made that a 
station can ill afford not to promote itself 
in today’s highly competitive marketplace. 
Promotions are an integral part of contem-
porary station operations, and research and 
planning are what make a promotion a 
winner.
Budgeting Promotions
Marketing expert Andrew Curran opens 
this section with his views on the chal-
lenges of finding resources to promote a 
station: “In my experience, since revenue 
growth in radio has been relatively flat in 
recent years, marketing budgets are often 
the first thing to cut, especially in the third 
and fourth quarters of the year when a 
company needs to hit its financial numbers. 
In addition, it seems that stations seem to 
get the most marketing money when the 
ratings are down and instant results need 
to be delivered to get revenue up. Certainly 
this makes for some tense campaigns and 
often – if the promotion is successful and 
ratings go up – marketing dollars are moved 
to another station that is in need of help 
rather than allowing the original station 
to strengthen its position with additional 
marketing.”
Obviously, cost projections are included 
in the planning of a promotion. The 
­promotion director’s budget may be sub-
stantial or all but nonexistent. Stations 
in small markets often have minuscule 
budgets compared with their giant metro 
market counterparts. But then again, the 
need to promote in a one- or two-station 
market generally is not as great as it is 
in ­multistation markets. To a degree, the 
­promotion a station does is commensurate 
with the level of competition.
A typical promotion at an average-size 
station may involve the use of newspapers, 
plus additional handout materials, such as 
stickers, posters, buttons, and an assortment 
of other items depending on the nature of 
the promotion. Television and billboards 
“Jocks flew around the Las Vegas skies in 
several World War II fighter planes owned 
by Miller Beer while our call letters were 
written by a skywriter. The effect was stun-
ning. This promotion worked because sky-
writing is so rare these days and not many 
people have seen a squadron of vintage 
warplanes. It also worked because it didn’t 
cost us a penny. It was a trade agreement 
with Miller. We gave them the exposure, 
and they gave us the air show. Of course, 
a lot of details had to be worked out in 
advance.”
The most effective promotion in recent 
years at New London’s WSUB involved 
awarding contestants an elaborate night out 
on the town. Chuck Davis relates: “Our 
‘Night Out’ promotion has been popular 
for some time. The station gets premium 
concert tickets through a close alliance with 
a New York concert promoter. It then finds 
a sponsor to participate in the giveaway 
and provides him with counter signs and 
an entry box so that people may register in 
his store. The sponsor then becomes part 
of the promotion and in return purchases 
an air schedule. Contestants are told to go 
to the store to register for the ‘Night Out,’ 
thus increasing store traffic even more. In 
addition, the sponsor agrees to absorb the 
expense of a limousine to transport the 
winners, who also are treated to a precon-
cert dinner at a local restaurant that pro-
vides the meals in exchange for promotional 
consideration – a mention on the air in our 
‘Night Out’ promos. In the end, the sta-
tion’s cost amounts to a couple of phone 
calls, a cardboard sign, and a box. Reaction 
has always been great from all parties. The 
sponsor likes the tie-in with the promo-
tion. The restaurant is very satisfied with 
the attention it receives for providing a few 
dinners, and the concert promoter gets a 
lot of exposure for the acts that he books 
simply by giving the station some tickets. It 
works like a charm. We please our audience 
and also put a few greenbacks in the till.”
In the end, making certain that everything 
is kosher with the execution of a promotion 
or contest is absolutely crucial, notes Larry 
Miller. “Another perhaps apocryphal tale of 
things going amiss is the San Francisco Top 
40 station that did a Lucky License Plate 
contest during morning drive. Everybody

prize recipient $20,000 a year for 50 years. 
The station spent nearly an equal amount 
to promote the big giveaway. Most of the 
promotional cost resulted from a heavy use 
of local television.
A decade ago KHTZ-FM in Los Angeles 
spent over $300,000 on billboards and tele-
vision to advertise its dreamhouse giveaway. 
The total cost of the promotion approached 
a half million dollars. The price tag of the 
may also be utilized. Each of these items will 
require an expenditure unless some other 
provision has been made, such as a trade 
agreement in which airtime is swapped for 
goods or ad space.
The cost involved in promoting a contest 
often constitutes the primary expense. 
When WASH-FM in Washington, DC, gave 
away a million dollars, it spent $200,000 
to purchase an annuity designed to pay the

temporary hit-formatted outlet,  moving 
it from ‘worst to first’ in a matter of 
months. They did a little advertising and 
gave away some money. I  estimate that 
their giveaways totaled less dollars than 
some of their competitors spent on straight 
­advertising. But the station’s success was 
built on three key factors: product, service, 
and employee incentives. Indeed, they 
do have a quality product. Second, they 
are providing a service to their custom-
ers or listeners, and, third, the care and 
feeding of the air staff and support team 
are obvious at all times. You don’t neces-
sarily have to spend a fortune on promo-
tion.” Larry Miller agrees, “A really good 
promotion director can do effective pro-
motions without spending a lot of money. 
First, utilize ‘on air’ promotions; second, 
trade out for stuff like contest prizes and 
newspaper advertising. You can do much 
for very little through a combined effort 
with programming.”
Since promotion directors frequently are 
expected to arrange trade agreements Pro-
motions and the FCC with merchants as a 
way to defray costs, a familiarity with and

house was $122,000. Both of these high-
priced contests accomplished their goals – 
increased ratings. In a metro market, one 
rating point can mean a million dollars in ad 
revenue. “A promotion that contributes to 
a two- or three-point jump in the ratings is 
well worth the money spent on it,” observes 
Rick Peters.
The promotion director works with 
the station manager in establishing the 
­promotion budget. From there, it is the 
promotion director’s job to allocate funds 
for the various contests and promotions 
that are run throughout the station’s fiscal 
period. Just as in every other area of a 
station, computers are becoming a promi-
nent fixture in the promotion department. 
“If you have a large budget, a computer 
certainly makes life a lot easier. The idea is 
to control the budget and not let it control 
you. Obviously computers have been a big 
help in this respect,” states Marlin R. Taylor, 
who also contends that large sums of money 
need not be poured into promotions  if a 
station is on target with its programming. 
“In 1983, the Malrite organization came 
to New York and launched Z-100, a con-

•	 Tie-breaking procedures
The public must not be misled concern-
ing the nature of prizes. Specifics must be 
stated. Implying that a large boat is to be 
awarded when, in fact, a canoe is the actual 
prize would constitute misrepresentation, 
as would suggesting that an evening in the 
Kon Tiki Room of the local Holiday Inn is 
a great escape weekend to the exotic South 
Seas.
The FCC also stipulates that any changes 
in contest rules must be promptly conveyed 
to the public. It makes clear, too, that any 
rigging of contests, such as determining 
winners in advance, is a direct violation 
of the law and can result in a substantial 
penalty, or even license revocation.
Although the FCC does not require that 
a station keep a contest file, most do. Main-
taining all pertinent contest information, 
including signed prize receipts and releases 
understanding of the station’s rate struc-
ture is necessary. Trading airtime for use in 
promotions is less popular at highly rated 
stations that can demand top dollars for 
spots. Most stations, however, prefer to 
exchange available airtime for goods and 
services needed in a promotion, rather than 
pay cash.
Promotions and the FCC
Although the FCC has dropped most of its 
rules pertaining to contests and promotions, 
it does expect that they be conducted with 
propriety and good judgment. The basic 
obligation of broadcasters to operate in the 
public interest remains the primary consid-
eration. Section 73.1216 of the FCC’s rules 
and regulations (as printed in the Code of 
Federal Regulations) outlines the do’s and 
don’ts of contest presentations.
Stations are prohibited from running a 
contest in which contestants are required 
to pay in order to play. The FCC regards as 
lottery any contest in which the elements 
of prize, chance, and consideration exist. In 
other words, contestants must not have to 
risk something to win.
Contests must not place participants in 
any danger or jeopardize property. Award-
ing prizes to the first five people who suc-
cessfully scale a treacherous mountain or 
swim a channel filled with alligators cer-
tainly would be construed by the FCC as 
endangering the lives of those involved. 
Contestants have been injured and sta-
tions held liable more than once. In the 
case of the station in California that ran 
a treasure hunt resulting in considerable 
property damage, it incurred the wrath of 
the public, town officials, and the FCC. In 
a more tragic example of poor planning, a 
listener was killed during a “find the disk 
jockey” contest. The station was charged 
with negligence and sustained a substan-
tial fine.
Stations are expected to disclose the mate-
rial terms of all contests and promotions 
conducted. These include the following:

Stations that award prizes valued at 
$600 or more are expected by law to file

CHAPTER 7 Promotion

C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
1.  To keep listeners interested and tuned, 
stations actively promote their image and 
call letters. Small-market stations promote 
themselves to compete for audience with 
other forms of media. Major-market stations 
use promotion to differentiate themselves 
from competing stations.
2.  Radio recognized the value of promotion 
early and used print media, remote broad-
casts, and billboards to inform the public. 
Later, ratings surveys proved the impor-
tance of effective promotions.
3.  Greater competition because of the 
increasing number of stations and monthly 
audience surveys means today’s stations 
must promote themselves continually.
4.  The most successful (attracting listener-
ship loyalty) promotions involve large cash 
or merchandise prizes.
5.  A successful promotion director possesses 
knowledge and understanding of the station’s 
audience; a background in research and mar-
keting, writing, and conceptual skills; the 
ability to adapt existing concepts to a par-
ticular station; and a familiarity with graphic 
art. The promotion director is responsible 
for acquiring prizes through trade or pur-
chase and for compliance with FCC regula-
tions covering promotions.
6.  On-air promotions are the most common 
method used to retain and expand listener-
ship. Such devices as slogans linked to the 
call letters and contests are common.
7.  To “bookend” call letters means to place 
them at the beginning and conclusion of 
each break. To “graft” call letters means 
to include them with all informational 
announcements.
8.  Contests must have clear rules and must 
provide entertainment for players and non-
players alike. Successful contests are com-
patible with the station’s sound, offer prizes 
attractive to the target audience, and chal-
lenge the listener’s imagination.
9.  Stealth promotions include members of 
a station’s database and are known only to 
the people eligible to win.
10.  Off-air promotions are intended to 
attract new listeners. Popular approaches 
include billboards, bus cards, newspa-
pers, television, bumper stickers, discount 
cards, giveaway items embossed with call 
letters or logo, deejay personal appear-
ances, special activity sponsorship, remote 
broadcasts, direct mail, faxing, and tele-
marketing. Station Web sites are promo-
tional tools.
11.  To offset the sometimes-substantial cost 
of an off-air promotion, stations often col-
laborate with sponsors to share both the 
expenses and the attention gained.
12.  FCC regulations governing promotions 
are contained in Section 73.12116. Basically, 
stations may not operate lotteries, endanger 
contestants, rig contests, or mislead listeners 
as to the nature of the prize.
13.  Promax International provides infor-
mation and services to station promotion 
directors.

public service announcements [PSAs]) to 
be aired and a record of what was actually 
aired. It serves to inform the on-air operator 
of what to broadcast and at what time, and 
it provides a record for, among other things, 
billing purposes.
Let us examine the process involved in 
logging a commercial for broadcast begin-
ning at the point at which the salesperson 
writes an order for a spot schedule.
1.	The salesperson writes an order and 
returns it to the station.
2.	The sales manager then checks and 
approves the order.
3.	The sales secretary types the order.
4.	Copies of the formalized order are dis-
tributed to the traffic manager, sales 
manager, billing, salesperson, and client.
5.	The order is placed in the traffic schedul-

Although the preceding is both a sim-
plification and generalization of the actual 
process, it does convey the basic idea. Keep 
in mind that not all stations operate in exactly 
the same manner. The actual method for 
preparing a log will differ also from station 
to station depending on whether it is done 
manually or by computer. Those outlets 
using the manual system (very few remain) 
often simplify the process by preparing a 
master or semipermanent log containing 
fixed program elements and even long-term 
advertisers. Short-term sponsors and other 
Traffic and Billing 8
The Air Supply
What was printed here nearly a quarter of 
a century ago remains a fact today: a station 
sells airtime – that is its inventory, its product. 
The volume or size of a given station’s inven-
tory depends chiefly on the amount of time it 
allocates for commercial matter. For example, 
some stations with Easy Listening and Adult 
Contemporary formats deliberately restrict 
or limit commercial loads as a method of 
enhancing overall sound and fostering a “more 
music, less talk” image. Other outlets simply 
abide by commercial load stipulations as out-
lined in their license renewal applications.
A full-time station has more than 10,000 
minutes to fill each week. This computes to 
approximately 3000 minutes for commer-
cials, based on an 18-minute commercial 
load ceiling per hour. In the eyes of the sales 
manager, this means anywhere from 3000 to 
6000 availabilities or slots – assuming that a 
station sells 60- and 30-second spot units – 
in which commercial announcements are 
inserted.
From the discussion in the first seven chap-
ters, it should be apparent that inventory 
control and accountability at a radio station 
are no small job. They are, in fact, the primary 
duty of the person called the traffic manager.
The Traffic Manager
A daily log is prepared by the traffic manager 
(also referred to as the traffic director). This 
document is at once a schedule of program-
ming elements (commercials, features, and 
237 

It also falls within the traffic manager’s 
purview to make sure that copy and pro-
duction tapes are in on time. Most stations 
have a policy, often stated in their rate card, 
requiring that commercial material be on 
hand at least 48 hours before it is sched-
uled for broadcast. Traffic manager Carol 
Bates of Providence, Rhode Island, says that 
getting copy before the air date can be a 
problem. “It is not unusual to get a tape 
or copy a half-hour before it is due to air. 
We ask that copy be in well in advance, 
but sometimes it’s a matter of minutes. No 
station is unfamiliar with having to make up 
spots due to late copy. It’s irritating but a 
reality that you have to deal with.”
Station traffic manager Jan Hildreth says 
that holiday and political campaign periods 
can place added pressure on the traffic person. 
“The fourth quarter is the big money time in 
radio. The logs usually are jammed, and avail-
abilities are in short supply. The workload in 
the traffic department doubles. Things also get 
pretty chaotic around elections. It can become 
a real test for the nerves. Of course, there’s 
always the late order that arrives at 5 p.m. on 
Friday that gets the adrenaline going.”
There are few station relationships closer 
than that of the traffic department with pro-
gramming and sales. Programming relies on 
the traffic manager for the logs that func-
tion as scheduling guides for on-air person-
nel. Sales depends on the traffic department 
to inform it of existing availabilities and to 
process orders onto the air. “It is crucial to the 
operation that traffic have a good relation-
ship with sales and programming. When it 
doesn’t, things begin to happen. The program 
director (PD) has to let traffic know when 
something changes; if not, the system breaks 
down. This is equally true of sales. Traffic is 
kind of the heart of things. Everything passes 
through the traffic department. Cooperation 
is very important,” observes radio station 
traffic manager Barbara Kalulas.
The Traffic Manager’s 
Credentials
A college degree usually is not a criterion 
for the job of traffic manager. This is not 
to imply that skill and training are not 
changes will be entered on an ongoing basis. 
This method significantly reduces typing. 
The master may be imprinted on plastic or 
Mylar, and entries can be made and erased 
according to need. Once the log is prepared, 
it is then copied and distributed.
It is the traffic manager’s responsibility to 
see that an order is logged as specified and 
that each client is treated fairly and equitably. 
A sponsor who purchases two spots, 5 days 
a week, during morning drive, can expect to 
receive good rotation for maximum reach. 
It is up to the traffic manager to schedule 
the client’s commercials in as many quarter-
hour segments of the daypart as possible. The 
effectiveness of a spot schedule is reduced 
if the spots are logged in the same quarter-
hour each day. If a spot is logged at 6:45 a.m. 
daily, it is only reaching those people tuned 
at that hour each day. However, if on one 
day it is logged at 7:15 a.m. and then at 
8:45 a.m. on another, and so on, it is reaching 
a different audience each day. It also would 
be unfair to the advertiser who purchased 
drivetime to have spots logged only prior 
to 7:00 a.m., the beginning of the prime 
audience period.
The traffic manager maintains a record 
of when a client’s spots are aired to help 
ensure effective rotation. Another concern 
of the traffic manager is to keep adequate 
space between accounts of a competitive 
nature. Running two restaurants back-to-
back or within the same spot set likely 
would result in having to reschedule both 
at different times at no cost to the client.

CHAPTER 8 Traffic and Billing

­necessary, and more and more everybody at 
a radio station has at least some college edu-
cation. Obviously, the demands placed on 
the traffic manager are formidable, and not 
everyone is qualified to fill the position. “It 
takes a special kind of person to effectively 
handle the job of traffic. Patience, an eye for 
detail, plus the ability to work under pres-
sure and with other people are just some 
of the qualities the position requires,” notes 
radio executive Bill Campbell.
Typing or keyboard skills are vital to the 
job. A familiarity with computers and word 
processing has become necessary, because 
most stations have given up the manual 
system of preparing logs in favor of the 
computerized method.
Many traffic people are trained in-house 
and come from the administrative or clerical 
ranks. It is a position that traditionally has 
been filled by women. Even though traffic 
salaries generally exceed that of purely sec-
retarial positions, this is not an area noted 
for its high pay. Although the traffic manager 
is expected to handle many responsibilities, 
the position generally is perceived as more 
clerical in nature than managerial.
Traffic managers frequently make the tran-
sition into sales or programming. The con-
siderable exposure to those particular areas 
provides a solid foundation and good spring-
board for those desiring to make the change.
Directing Traffic
Computers vastly enhance the speed and 
efficiency of the traffic process. Comput-
ers store copious amounts of data, retrieve 
information faster than humanly possible, 
and schedule and rotate commercials with 
precision and equanimity, to mention only 
a few of the features that make the new 
technology especially adaptive for use in the 
traffic area (see Figures 8.2–8.4).
Computers are an excellent tool for 
inventory control, contends former broad-
cast computer consultant Vicki Cliff. “Radio 
is a commodity not unlike a train carload 
of perishables, such as tomatoes. Radio sells 
time, which is progressively spoiling. The 
economic laws of supply and demand are 
classically applied to radio. Computers can 
assist in plotting that supply-and-demand 
curve in determining rates to be charged for 
various dayparts at any given moment.
“Inventory control is vital to any busi-
ness. Radio is limited in its availabilities 
and seasonal in its desirability to the client. 
In a sold-out state, client value priorities 
must be weighted to optimize the station’s 
billing. All things being equal, the credit 
rating of the client should be the deciding 
factor. Computers can eliminate the human 
subjectivity in formulating the daily log.”
The cost of computerizing traffic has 
kept a small percentage of stations from 
converting from the manual system, notes 
Cliff. “Purchasing a personal computer for

the traffic function is okay, but if a station 
desires to perform several functions, it may 
find itself out of luck. There are limits as to 
what can be done with a personal computer. 
On the other hand, a larger capacity, main-
frame computer can be a major expense, 
although the functions it can perform are 
extraordinary. An online, real-time system 
can be costly also. Line expenses can really 
add up. Those station managers considering 
computerizing must gather all possible data 
to determine if the system they’re consider-
ing will cost justify itself.”
In an interview in Radio Ink, WPOC-
FM’s Jim Dolan observed that “The move 
right now is toward putting your sales force 
in the field armed with laptops and instanta-
neous online access to inventory, availability, 
and contract information. And the PC-based 
systems seem to be evolving faster than the 
minicomputer systems in this regard.”
Various types of traffic and billing soft-
ware are available. Dozens of companies, 
most notably Radio Traffic, Marketron, 
Columbine, Bias Radio, Custom Business 
Systems, Jefferson Pilot, and The Manage-
ment, specialize in providing broadcasters 
with software packages. Prices for computer 
software vary depending on the nature and 
content of the program.
Compatible hardware is specified by the 
software manufacturer. Most software is 
IBM-PC compatible, however. Companies 
and consultants specializing in broadcast 
computerization are listed in Broadcasting 
Yearbook.
According to the NAB, the majority of 
stations were utilizing computers, especially 
in the area of traffic, in the 1990s. Notes 
Jay Williams, Jr., “Traffic and accounting for 
many affiliated stations are now being done 
by modem from corporate offices. Even sales 
is becoming more computer-powered. It 
won’t be long before avails and pricing will 
be offered to stations, acceptance of an order 
will be confirmed by a keystroke, and the 
commercial downloaded on command.”
Traffic in Clusters
In the age of widespread station clustering, 
it is common for a centralized traffic (and 
billing) department to handle the work of 
several outlets that are owned by the same 
company or group. In this case, the staff of 
the “hub” department (the one handling all  
of the work) may be enlarged to accommodate  
the increased demands. Obviously, this also 
means that the traffic departments at the 
various stations in the cluster are no longer nec-
essary and therefore are typically eliminated.
Williams adds, “Consolidation and technol-
ogy have provided opportunities for savings in 
traffic, bookkeeping, engineering, production, 
and other internal operations. Technology soon 
will allow stations to automatically accept 
and schedule orders directly from approved 
clients and agencies; the acceptance of this 
‘offer-buy-schedule’ software will streamline 
the traffic-billing process even more.”
Dave Scott, CEO of RadioTraffic.com, 
further discusses the impact of consolida-
tion of radio station traffic operations. “In 
the era when an owner could only have two 
stations in a market (prior to the Telecom 
Act), one traffic person often did all the ‘back 
room’ commercial scheduling and billing 
for two stations. So six or seven stations 
would have had three or four people. After 
consolidation, it’s not usual for seven sta-
tions to have one or two people handling all 
commercial scheduling and billing. This has 
FIGURE 8.4

CHAPTER 8 Traffic and Billing

been possible partly through ­combination 
sales (where one or two sales people handle 
sales of ads for six, seven, or eight stations) 
and partly through more efficient traffic and 
billing software (made so one order entry 
process could get all the details into all six, 
seven, or eight stations).
Some of this has been due to the mul-
titasking aspect of Windows software and 
some due to faster and more powerful 
desktop computers, along with the advent of 
networking of several computers together so 
all sales people could do some order entry.
What we do at our company is take mul-
tiple station operation two steps further. 
First, RadioTraffic.com software is Internet 
enabled, so sales people don’t have to phone 
in to find out about unsold availabilities. 
This is important because ad time is perish-
able. You can’t sell the time a few minutes 
ago if you didn’t sell it in advance.
Internet connectivity also means sales 
people don’t have to drive back to the station 
to get new orders or change orders entered 
by traffic people. They can do so with any 
computer or the Internet anywhere. That 
includes laptop computers with wireless 
Internet access, any computer at an Inter-
net café, and any PDA with wireless Inter-
net. Station people and clients have secure 
access to full account information from any 
Internet computer, just the way as one has 
account info from their bank or credit card 
company. Here at RadioTraffic.com we also 
offer client invoices, affidavits, and state-
ments that talk. Merely click on the day 
and time of any commercial and you can 
hear an aircheck playback of it along with 
what came before and after, all over the 
Internet. All this makes traffic run smoothly 
in cluster situations.”
Billing
At most stations, advertisers are billed for the 
airtime they have purchased after a portion 
or all of it has run. Few stations require that 
sponsors pay in advance. It is the job of the 
billing department to notify the advertiser 
when payment is due. Al Rozanski, former 
business manager of WMJX-FM, Boston, 
explains the process involved once a ­contract 
has been logged by the traffic department. 
“We send invoices out twice monthly. Many 
stations bill weekly, but we find doing it every 
2 weeks cuts down on the paperwork consid-
erably. The first thing my billing person does 
is check the logs to verify that the client’s 
spots ran. We don’t bill them for something 
that wasn’t aired. Occasionally a spot will 
be missed for one reason or another, say a 
technical problem. This will be reflected on 
the log because the on-air person will indi-
cate this fact. Invoices are then generated in 
triplicate by our computer. We use an IBM 
System 34 computer and Columbine soft-
ware. This combination is extremely versatile 
and efficient. The station retains a copy of the 
invoice and mails two to the client, who then 
returns one with the payment. The client 
also receives an affidavit detailing when spots 
were aired. If the client requests, we will 
notarize the invoice. This is generally neces-
sary for clients involved in co-op contracts.” 
The billing procedure at WMJX-FM is rep-
resentative of that at many stations.
Not all radio stations have a full-time 
business manager on the payroll. Thus, the 
person who handles billing commonly is 
responsible for maintaining the station’s 
financial records or books as well. In this 
case, the services of a professional accoun-
tant may be contracted on a regular periodic 
basis to perform the more complex book-
keeping tasks and provide consultation on 
other financial matters.
Accounts that fail to pay when due are 
turned over to the appropriate salesperson 
for collections. If this does not result in 
payment, a station may use the services of 
a collection agency. Should its attempt also 
fail, the station likely would write the busi-
ness off as a loss at tax time.
Dave Scott adds the cluster angle to the 
preceding, “In the era of group ownership a 
seamless automatic consolidation of finan-
cial reporting from clusters of stations in 
different cities, states, and regions, as well as 
national totals, is needed. Previously, clusters 
would combine their stations and fax weekly 
reports to headquarters. Now, group owners 
know their own pacing on an hour-by-hour 
basis, just the way a chain retailer would 
have their cash registers tied together for 
consolidated sales pacing and restocking.”

for broadcast and to provide information 
for both the traffic and billing departments 
pertaining to their particular functions. 
A log creates accountability. It is both a 
programming guide and a document of 
verification.
Stations are now at liberty to design logs 
that serve their needs most effectively and 
efficiently. The WMJX log form shown in 
Figure 8.11 is an example of a log that has 
been designed to meet all of its station’s 
needs in the most economical and uncom-
plicated way.
There are no stipulations regarding the 
length of time that logs must be retained. 
Before the elimination of the FCC program 
log regulations, stations were required to 
retain logs for a minimum of 2 years. Today 
most stations still hold onto logs for that 
amount of time for the sake of accountabil-
ity, and with computers as archive sources, 
logs may be kept indefinitely without creat-
ing physical space issues.

1.  Each commercial slot on a station is 
called an availability. Availabilities consti-
tute a station’s salable inventory.
2.  The traffic manager (or traffic director) 
controls and is accountable for the broad-
cast time inventory.
3.  The traffic manager prepares a log to 
inform the deejays of what to broadcast 
and at what time.
4.  The traffic manager is also responsible 
for ensuring that an ad order is logged 
as specified, that a record of when each 
client’s spots are aired is maintained, and 
that copy and production tapes are in  
on time.
5.  Programming relies on the traffic manager  
for the logs that function as scheduling  
guides for on-air personnel; the sales depart-
ment depends on the traffic manager to 
inform them of existing availabilities and 
to process orders onto the air.
6.  Although most traffic people are trained 
in-house and are drawn from the adminis-
trative or clerical ranks, they must possess 
patience, an eye for detail, the ability to 
C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
work under pressure, and keyboarding 
skills.
7.  Most traffic departments have been com-
puterized to enhance speed and efficiency. 
Therefore, traffic managers must be com­
puter knowledgeable.
8.  In many instances, consolidation (cluster-
ing) has eliminated individual station traffic 
and billing departments and a single traffic 
hub within the cluster prepares logs and 
sponsor invoices for all the stations. In some 
cases, outside companies have assumed  
the task. 
9.  Based on the spots aired, as recorded 
and verified by the traffic department, the 
billing department sends invoices weekly or 
biweekly to each client. Invoices are nota-
rized for clients with co-op contracts.
10.  Since the FCC eliminated program log 
requirements in the early 1980s, stations 
have been able to design logs that inform 
programming personnel of what is sched-
uled for broadcast and that provide neces-
sary information for the traffic and billing 
departments.

Appendix: A Traffic Manager’s Account
Clients may want to advertise on a consistent 
basis to have their name and message in the 
public awareness, or they may want to hype a 
particular event or sale.
Commercials may be produced by the radio 
station production department from a script 
or copy points provided by the client. Finished 
commercials can be sent in the form of reel, 
over the Internet (MP3), or through commercial 
delivery systems. However the commercial 
arrives, the information about how to run that 
commercial must go to the traffic manager. The 
acceptable dates and times for each commercial 
are entered into the computer as well as rotation 
instructions if there are multiple commercials 
running for a client. Code numbers or 
information about the commercials that must be 
provided on the invoice are also entered.
Once all the contracts and traffic instructions 
are input, the traffic manager assembles and 
arranges a daily log. A multilevel priority system 
is used to ensure that the clients specifying 
the most detailed placement are scheduled 
first. If the traffic and in-studio computers are 
linked, the commercial log is immediately in 
place and ready to be merged with the music 
log. Any additions, deletions, or adjustments 
are registered as they occur. If the traffic and 
in-studio computer systems are not linked, the 
completed commercial log is transferred by disk 
and changes are entered manually into the traffic 
software.
Invoices specifying the date and time that each 
commercial aired are generated from the finalized 
log information.

Every radio station has a person who 
manages “traffic.” Traffic management is the 
scheduling of commercials. Client orders are 
entered into the traffic software specifying the 
dates, times, length, and rate of the requested 
commercials.
Once the order is entered, the questions “Who 
wants to advertise?” and “When do they want to 
be on the air?” are answered. Clients can choose to 
run a certain number of commercials over a period 
of days, or they can opt for a specific number of 
commercials on specific days. In general, the more 
detailed the client specifications for placement, the 
greater the cost of the commercial.
After deciding when they want to run 
and how much flexibility they have in 
day placement, the client must choose the 
scheduling plan. Every radio station has a “run of 
station” plan that means the client’s commercials 
will be placed randomly by the computer in 
whatever openings are available. This is generally 
called ROS or BTA (best times available) and is 
the least expensive placement option. A client 
may want to ensure that his commercials will 
run throughout the day. A plan that guarantees 
an even distribution throughout the dayparts is 
the next step up from an ROS schedule. Clients 
who specifically want a certain number of 
commercials in a particular daypart on a chosen 
day will pay the highest rate for the individual 
commercial unit. The customary dayparts are 6 
a.m.–10 a.m., 10 a.m.–3 p.m., 3 p.m.–7 p.m.,  
7 p.m.–Mid.
The next question after “Who” wants to 
advertise and “When” is “What do they want  
to advertise?” The two most common reasons 
for advertising are “image” and “event.”

just in the process of evolving and ­therefore 
lacked the technical and creative wherewithal 
to present a more sophisticated spot.
Things changed by 1930, however. The 
austere, no-frills pitch, occasionally accom-
panied by a piano but more often done a 
cappella, was gradually replaced by the dia-
logue spot that used drama or comedy to sell 
its product. A great deal of imagination and 
creativity went into the writing and produc-
tion of commercials, which were presented 
live throughout the 1930s. The production 
demands of some commercials equaled and 
even exceeded those of the programs they 
interrupted. Orchestras, actors, and lavishly 
constructed sound effects commonly were 
required to sell a chocolate-flavored syrup or 
a muscle liniment. By the late 1930s, certain 
commercials had become as famous as the 
favorite programs of the day. Commercials 
had achieved the status of pop art.
Still, the early radio station production 
room was primitive by today’s standards. 
Sound effects were mostly improvised show 
by show, commercial by commercial, in 
some cases using the actual objects with 
which sounds were identified. Glass was 
shattered, guns fired, and furniture over-
turned as the studio’s on-air light flashed. 
Before World War II, few sound effects were 
available on records. It was just as rare for a 
station to broadcast prerecorded commer-
cials, although 78 rpm and wire recordings 
were used by certain major advertisers. The 
creation of vinyl discs in the 1940s inspired 
more widespread use of electrical transcrip-
tions for radio advertising purposes. Today, 
sound effects are taken from CDs and 
downloaded from the Internet.
Production 9
A Spot Retrospective
Radio has entered a new era in mixing and 
sound imaging. Still, a typical broadcast radio 
station produces thousands of commercials, 
public service announcements (PSAs), and 
promos annually. Meanwhile, satellite radio 
stations will mix a vast array of liners, 
voicers, promos, and features, and Web radio 
operations frequently do likewise.
Initially, commercials were aired live, 
due to a lack of recording technology. In 
the 1920s, most paid announcements con-
sisted of lengthy speeches on the virtues 
of a particular product or service. Perhaps 
the most representative of the commercials 
of the period was one of the first ever to 
be broadcast, which lasted over 10 minutes 
and was announced by a representative 
of a Queens, New York, real estate firm. 
Aired live over WEAF in 1922, by today’s 
standards the message would sound more 
like a classroom lecture than a broadcast 
advertisement. Certainly, no snappy jingle 
or ear-catching sound effects accompanied 
the episodic announcement.
Most commercial messages resembled the 
first until 1926. On Christmas Eve of that 
year the radio jingle was introduced, when 
four singers gathered for a musical tribute 
to Wheaties cereal. It was not for several 
years, however, that singing commercials 
were commonplace. For the most part, com-
mercial production during the medium’s first 
decade was relatively mundane. The reason 
was twofold: the government had resisted 
the idea of blatant or direct commercialism 
from the start, which fostered a low-key 
approach to advertising, and the medium was

of radio as an advertising medium than did 
Stan Freberg. Through skillful writing and 
the clever use of sound effects, Freberg 
transformed Lake Michigan into a basin of 
hot chocolate crowned by a 700-foot-high 
mountain of whipped cream, and no one 
doubted the feat.
Today, the sounds of millions of skillfully 
prepared commercials trek through the 
ether and into the minds of practically every 
man, woman, and child in America. Good 
writing and production are what make the 
medium so successful.
Formatted Spots
In the 1950s the medium took to format-
ting to survive and prosper. Today listeners 
are offered myriad sounds from which to 
choose; there is something for practically 
every taste. Stations concentrate their efforts 
on delivering a specific format, which may 
be defined as Adult Contemporary, Country, 
Easy Listening, or any one of a dozen others. 
As you will recall from the discussion in 
The live spot was the mainstay at most 
stations into the 1950s, when two inno-
vations brought about a greater reliance 
on the prerecorded message. Magnetic 
recording tape and 33 LPs revolutionized 
radio production methods. Recording tape 
brought about the greatest transformation 
and, ironically, was the product of Nazi 
scientists who developed acetate recorders 
and tape for espionage purposes. The adop-
tion of magnetic tape by radio stations was 
costlier and thus occurred at a slower pace 
than 33 rpm, which essentially required a 
turntable modification.
Throughout the 1950s, advertising agen-
cies grew to rely on LPs. By 1960, mag-
netic tape recorders were a familiar piece 
of studio equipment. More and more com-
mercials were prerecorded. Some stations, 
especially those automated, did away with 
live announcements entirely, preferring to 
tape everything to avoid on-air mistakes.
Commercials themselves became more 
sophisticated sounding since practically 
anything could be accomplished on tape. 
Perhaps, no individual in the 1960s more 
effectively demonstrated the unique nature

The Production Room	
253
Chapter 3, each format has its own distinc-
tive sound, which is accomplished through 
a careful selection and arrangement of 
compatible program elements. To this end, 
commercials attempt to reflect a station’s 
format. In the age of consolidation, says 
Larry Miller, “There is a tendency to do 
one size fits all at the agency level. In-house 
local retail may be more customized to fit 
the format. We used to make a point of 
avoiding loud rock ‘n’ roll spots at the clas-
sical station I worked for, but I’m not sure 
if that’s still a consideration.”
The Production Room
In general, metro market stations and clus-
ters employ a full-time production person 
(known variously as production director, 
production manager, production chief, and 
more recently as chief imager or head audio 
animator). This individual’s primary duties 
are to record voice-tracks and mix com-
mercials and PSAs. Other duties involve 
the maintenance of the bed and sound 
effects library and the mixdown of promo-
tional material and special programs, such 
as public affairs features, interviews, and 
documentaries.
Stations that do not have a slot for a full-
time production person divide work among 
the on-air staff. In this case, the program 
director (PD) often oversees production 
responsibilities, or a deejay may be assigned 
several hours of production duties each day 
and be called the production director.
At most medium and small outlets, 
on-air personnel take part in the production 
process. Production may include the simple 
transfer of an agency spot into the computer 
system, a mixdown that requires a single 
bed (background music) under a 30-­second 
voicer, or a multielement mixdown of a 
60-second two-voicer with sound effects 
and several bed transitions. Station produc-
tion can run from the mundane to the excit-
ing and challenging (mixing a commercial 
without words ­conveyed through a conflu-
ence of sounds).
Most production directors, in this digital  
age often called imaging directors, are 
recruited from the on-air ranks, having 
acquired the necessary studio ­dexterity 
and know how to meet the demands of 
the position. In addition to the broad range 
of mixdown skills required by the job, a 
solid knowledge of editing is essential. The 
production director routinely is called on 
to make rudimentary edits or perform 
more complex editing chores, such as the 
rearrangement of elements in a 60-second 
concert promo. (Editing is covered in more 
detail later in this chapter.)
The production/imaging director works 
closely with many people but perhaps most 
closely with the program director. The person 
responsible for production is expected to 
have a complete understanding of the sta-
tion’s programming philosophy and objec-
tive. This is necessary because commercials 
FIGURE 9.2

254	
CHAPTER 9 Production
constitute an element of ­programming and 
therefore must fit in. A production person 
must be able to determine when an incom-
ing commercial clashes with the station’s 
image. When a question exists as to the 
spot’s appropriateness, the program director 
will be called on to make the final judg-
ment, because it is he or she who is ulti-
mately responsible for what gets on the air. 
In the final analysis, station production is 
a product of programming. In most broad-
cast organizations, the production direc-
tor answers to the program director. It is a 
logical arrangement given the relationship 
of the two areas.
The production/imaging director also 
works closely with the station copywriter. 
Their combined efforts make or break a 
commercial. The copywriter conceives of 
the concept, and the producer brings it to 
fruition. The traffic department also is in 
close and constant contact with production, 
because one of its primary responsibilities is 
to see that copy gets processed and placed 
in the on-air studio where it is scheduled 
for broadcast.
Once again the extensive clustering of 
station facilities in the age of consolidation 
finds many production responsibilities cen-
tralized. By now many radio groups have 
established one production hub to mix 
the spots of their other outlets, especially 
when in the same market. Typically, this 
has resulted in the downsizing of individual 
station production staffs and the elimina-
tion of comprehensive mixdown studios at 
these sites.
The Studios
A radio station has two kinds of studios: 
on-air and production. Both share basic 
design features and have comparable equip-
ment. In cluster operations where stations 
are colocated, there is often a single primary 
production facility. For ease of move-
ment and accessibility, audio equipment 
­commonly is set up in a U-shape within 
which the operator or producer is seated.
The standard equipment found in radio 
studios includes microphones, an audio 
console (commonly referred to as the 
“board”), computer workstations (on-air 
studio usually networked to production 
studio – this computer would also contain 
automation software, such as Audio Vault), 
video display monitors, compact disc 
machines, mini-disc machines, digital effects 
boxes, patch panel (digital consoles typi-
cally have these built in), and a distribution 
amplifier (see Figure 9.4).

variation thereof.

Audio Console
The audio console is the centerpiece, the 
very heart of the radio station. Dozens of 
manufacturers produce audio consoles, and 
although design characteristics vary, the basic 
components remain relatively constant. Con-
soles come in all different sizes and shapes 
and all contain inputs that permit audio 
energy to enter the console, outputs through 
which audio energy is fed to other locations, 
VU meters that measure the amount or level

of sound, pots (faders) that control gain or 
the quantity of sound, monitor gains that 
control in-studio volume, and master gains 
for the purpose of controlling general output 
levels (see Figures 9.6–9.8).
Since the late 1960s, the manufacture of 
consoles equipped with linear faders has 
surpassed those with rotary faders. Slide 
(another term used) faders perform the 
same function as the more traditional pots, 
and they are easier to read and handle.
Cue Mode
A low-power amplifier is built into the 
console so that the operator may hear 
audio from various sources without it actu-
ally being distributed to other points. The

purpose of this is to facilitate the setup 
of certain sound elements, such as records 
and tapes, for eventual introduction into the 
mixdown sequence (see Figure 9.9).
Computers
Computers have become the soul of the 
audio	 studio – both on-air and produc-
tion. Observes Vic Michaels, “Studio com-
puters would contain editing software, like 
Pro Tools or Adobe Audition. The on-air 
computer would also contain automation 
software, such as Audio Vault. It would also 
possess Selector, which is needed to tell the 
Audio Vault system what to play. At my 
station, we have three computers in produc-
tion: one is for Audio Vault automation, the 
second is for Selector music software, and 
the third is for editing on Pro Tools. All 
three are networked to the on-air computer. 
Everything now is “audio files.” When one 
makes a commercial or records a song off 
a CD, it becomes an audio file that can be 
moved from computer to computer.”

Digital (Mini) Disc Machines	
259
Digital (Mini) Disc Machines
Analog cart machines were replaced by ran-
dom-access mini-disc (record/­playback) tech-
nology. These machines have not become as 
popular as the cart machines they replaced, 
because of other studio innovations. The so-
called new-age cart machine allows produc-
ers to digitally archive vast amounts of audio 
on mini reusable discs. Says station manager 
Vic Michaels, “They replaced the old-line 
carts, because they were faster, programma-
ble, visual, digital, and competitively priced.” 
Companies like Sony, 360 Systems, Harris, 
Denon, and Otari manufactured the mini-
disc machine, which replaced the traditional 
analog cart machine at most stations – another 
victim of the computer age.
Among other things, digi-disc machines

hesitation or drag common in its analog

CHAPTER 9 Production
of production equipment has not entirely 
vanished. Observes Skip Pizzi: “Digital 
audio had its greatest initial acceptance as 
CD hardware, to the point where it was 
estimated that over half of the radio sta-
tions in the USA used CD to some extent. 
In major markets, this figure rose steeply. 
Many of these stations programmed music 
exclusively from CD, or nearly so. The prac-
tice of providing promotional copies of new 
releases on CD by record companies (fol-
lowing an earlier period of general reluc-
tance to do so) became common practice. 
Second- and third-generation professional 
CD players aided in the process of accep-
tance” (see Figure 9.20).
CD players employ a laser beam to read 
encoded data at a rate of 4.3218 million bits 
per second. A compact disc is 4.7 inches 
wide and 1.2 mm thick, and players are 
quite light and compact as well. This feature 
alone makes them attractive to broadcasters. 
But what makes a CD player most appeal-
ing to broadcasters is its superior sound. 
Compact disc players offer, among other 
features, far greater dynamic range than 
standard turntables and a lower signal-to-
noise ratio. They also eliminate the need for 
physical contact during cueing, and wowing 
and distortion are virtually gone.
Because digital discs are specially coated, 
they are much more resistant to damage than 
are analog discs. This is not to suggest that 
CDs are impervious; they are not. In fact, the 
majority of CD-related problems stem from 
the discs themselves and not the players.

Compact Discs
Compact disc players entered the radio 
­production studio in the 1980s. Although 
CD players have become less and less 
evident in studios, their value as a piece

Compressors, Equalizers, and Audio Processing	
261
CD-Rs allow one time burning, whereas 
CD-RWs allow multiple burnings.
Compressors, Equalizers, and 
Audio Processing
“There are three domains of audio,” says 
producer Ty Ford. “They are amplitude, 
frequency, and time.” Some stations alter 
amplitude to create the illusion of being 
louder without actually changing level. 
This is called compressing the signal. 
Production people use compressors to 
enhance loudness as well as to eliminate 
or cut out ambient noise, thus focusing on 
specifics of mix. Compression often is used 
as a method of getting listeners to take 
greater notice of a piece of ­production 
and as a remedy to certain problems (see 
Figure 9.22).
Equalizers (EQs) work the frequency 
domain of audio by boosting and/or cutting 
lows (hertz\obHz\cb range) and highs (kilo-
hertz\obkHz\cb range). EQs allow produc-
ers to correct problems as well as to create 
parity between different elements of pro-
duction. They are also useful in creating 
special effects. EQs are available in-board 
(part of the audio console) and out-of-board 
(stand-alone unit) and as part of certain 
integrated audio effects processors.
Despite initial claims of the invincibility of 
the digital disc, experience has shown that 
mishandling of discs is courting disaster. 
CDs cannot be mistreated – that is, used 
as Frisbees or placemats for peanut butter 
sandwiches – and still be expected to work 
like new. The simple fact is that although 
compact discs are more resistant to damage, 
they can be harmed.
A CD reads a disc from its core outward, 
moving from 500 rpm on the inside to 
200 rpm on the outer edge of the disc. 
Most CD players feature a variety of effect 
options, which can be of particular use to 
a production mix. Accessing cuts on a CD 
player is quick and simple, though excerpt-
ing segments from a track for inclusion in a 
mixdown can be somewhat less expedient. 
Nonetheless, CD players are still useful in 
the production studio. Compact discs are a 
wonderful source for bed music (music that 
serves as background under voiced copy) 
and sound effects.
Working with a CD unit is anything but 
complicated. Press a button and a tray ejects 
(on top-loaded models a door pops open). 
A disc is placed into the tray, and the press 
of the same button returns the tray and disc 
into the player. The ­operator then selects the 
track to be played and presses the appropri-
ately numbered button. The audio rolls.
Burnable CD units (CD-R and CD-RW) 
are prominent in the production room.

CHAPTER 9 Production
and are wired to an audio console so that 
the sounds they produce may be inte-
grated into mixdown. Samplers are also 
found in certain audio effects processors 
with musical instrument digital interface 
(MIDI). A sample is a digital recording of 
a small bit of sound.
“A lot of musical instrument (MI) gear has 
been introduced into the radio ­production 
studio. Synths, samplers, and sequencers are 
pretty commonplace today,” notes Ty Ford.
Many software applications, such as Cool 
Edit Pro and Pro Tools, have these and other 
signal processing built in.
Patch Panels and ISDNs
A patch panel consists of rows of 
inputs and outputs connected to various 
external sources – studios, equipment, 
Most audio processors (also called effects 
processors or simply boxes) are time-domain 
devices. Stations use these digital boxes to 
create a wide range of effects such as reverb, 
echo, and flange.
In the last few years, radio stations 
have become increasingly interested in 
what audio processors have to offer their 
mixes. Today these boxes are a familiar, 
often integral, item in production rooms 
at the majority of stations. Their value in 
the creation of commercials, PSAs, promos, 
and features is inestimable. The use of 
samplers and synthesizers is common in 
radio production rooms too. Samplers let 
a production person load a studio audio 
source (recorder, live mike) into its built-in 
microprocessor and then manipulate the 
digitized data with the aid of a musical 
keyboard to create a multitude of effects. 
Samplers employ magnetic microfloppies

remote locations, network lines, and 
so forth. Patch panels essentially are 
routing devices that allow for items not 
directly wired into an audio console to 
become a part of a ­broadcast or produc-
tion mixdown. Today, says Vic Michaels, 
“Patch panels are still ­utilized but not 
as frequently as before. Use is based on 
a station’s needs. Digital ­consoles now 
have internal patch ­capabilities built 
right into the console so one can patch in 
certain effects or sources to any channel” 
(see Figure 9.23).
ISDNs are digital phone lines that bring 
voices and other audio to studios with 
near perfect sound quality. Because voice 
tracking has become the means by which 
so many stations fill their airwaves, ISDN 
connections have become invaluable.
As production director Matt Grasso 
observes, “The day of the scratchy cell phone 
or muddy dedicated line is over. Your talent 
sounds like they are right in the studio. If 
they are at a club, not only can they talk, 
but they can broadcast the music they are 
playing there right over the air with the 
same quality you would get from a CD 
player in the main studio. ISDN means no 
reel to reels or DATS coming to a station 
via snailmail either.”

Microphones
Microphones are designed with different 
pickup patterns. Omnidirectional micro-
phones are sensitive to sound from all 
directions (360°), whereas bidirectional 
microphones pick up sound from two direc-
tions (180°). The unidirectional microphone 
draws sound from only one path (90°), and 
because of its highly directed field of receptiv-
ity, extraneous sounds are not amplified. This 
feature has made the unidirectional micro-
phone popular in both the control and pro-
duction studios, where generally one person 
is at work at a time. Most studio consoles 
possess two or more microphone inputs so 
that additional voices can be accommodated 
when the need arises (see Figure 9.25).
Omnidirectional and bidirectional micro-
phones often are used when more than one 
voice is involved. For instance, an omnidi-
rectional may be used for the broadcast or 
recording of a round-table discussion, and the 
bidirectional during a one-on-one interview.

CHAPTER 9 Production
Announcers must be aware of a micro-
phone’s directional features. Proper position-
ing in relation to a microphone is important. 
Being outside the path of a microphone’s 
pickup (off-mike) affects sound quality. At 
the same time, being too close to a micro-
phone can result in distortion, known as 
popping and blasting. Keeping a hand’s 
length away from a microphone will usually 
prevent this from ­occurring. ­Windscreens 
and blast filters may be attached to a micro-
phone to help reduce distortion.
Digital Editing
Old time tape editing is a lost art that ranged 
from a simple repair to a complicated rear-
rangement of sound elements. Today the 
old razor approach to editing and splicing 
tape is all but ancient history, having lost 
ground to “nondestructive” tapeless digital 
methods.
Computers handle the bulk of editing 
in the production room. This tapeless 
approach involves loading audio into a RAM 
or hard disc and making edits via a monitor 
(with the aid of a mouse, a keyboard, or 
a console). Although this ­technology has 
been costly in the past, today prices are 
quite affordable, motivating more and more 
stations to convert to the tapeless studio. 
Computerized audio workstations were 
once ­perceived as the studio of the future, 
but they are the studio of today (see radio 
production expert David Reeses’ discus-
sion and advice on digital editing in this 
chapter).
David Reese
Basic Digital Audio Editing (and a few tips)
Today, nearly all audio-production 
employs a computer (or computer-
based audio equipment) with audio 
editing software and involves four basic 
processes: recording, editing, mixing, 
and mastering.
Step 1: Recording Audio. This can 
be accomplished by recording with a 
microphone, by opening an existing 
audio file, or by extracting audio from 
a CD. If you’re live recording, watch 
volume levels and err on the low side. 
TIP: Record around –10 db on the VU 
meter. Low audio levels can generally 
be raised with the editing software: 
over-modulated, high-volume audio 
can’t be fixed and will leave you with 
distorted audio.
Step 2: Editing Audio. Audio editing 
is similar to word processing – you 
are using a lot of cut, paste, and copy 
functions. Not only can you hear the 
audio, but you can “read” the audio 
waveform. You see a visual representa-
tion of the audio with a vertical axis 
showing volume level and a horizontal 
FIGURE 9.27

perception.

Copywriting

accompany the words and sounds broad-
cast. The station employee who prepares 
written material is called a copywriter. A 
copywriter job consists primarily of writing 
commercials, promos, and PSAs, with the 
emphasis on the first of the three.
Not all stations employ a full-time 
copywriter. This is especially true in small 
Copywriting
As stated earlier, poet Stephen Vincent 
Benet, who wrote for radio during its 
heyday,  called the medium the theater of 
the mind. Indeed, the person who tunes 
into radio gets no visual aids but must 
manufacture images on his or her own to 
axis showing time. It’s usually easy to 
see groups of words and the spaces 
between words. Editing often involves 
making an “edit in” point and an “edit 
out” point and then cutting out a word, 
several words, or a chunk of music. 
TIP: Always make your edit in point just 
before the first word you want to cut 
out and your edit out point just before 
the first word you want to leave in. This 
will maintain proper phrasing and the 
natural flow of words; however, if you 
make a mistake, remember, most editing 
functions include an “Undo” command.
Step 3: Mixing Audio. Most audio 
production uses two “tracks” (stereo) or 
several tracks (multitrack). Once you’ve 
edited the various tracks, mixing is 
the blending of those tracks together. 
One aspect of the mix is balancing 
levels. For example, a simple radio 
spot might include an announcer vocal 
track and a music bed. In mixing them 
together, you would want to lower the 
volume of the music when the vocal is 
playing. Mixing also involves panning 
tracks to the left or right channel or 
somewhere in between. TIP: Use audio 
processing, like echo or reverb, to 
add “depth” to the sound track. You 
can also use equalization to enhance 
specific tracks or segments giving them 
brighter highs or a bass boost. Don’t 
forget to save your mix so you can go 
back and make changes, if necessary.
Step 4: Mastering Audio. The final 
step is to listen critically to your work 
several times and make any fine-
tuning adjustments. TIP: If you hear 
any “plosives” (those “pops” on p, t, 
b sounds), you usually can’t eliminate 
them, but you can diminish them. 
With your editor, select just the plosive 
part and slightly decrease the volume 
to reduce the impact of the plosive 
sound. In most cases, a multitrack 
production will be mastered down 
to stereo and saved as the finished 
product. You may need to transfer your 
audio file from the production com­
puter to another server for eventual 
playback or you may need to burn a 
copy onto CD for playback, to give a 
client, or just to archive.
Digital editing gives you almost 
unlimited ways to manipulate audio 
and to build a creative, finished 
product. Don’t be afraid to experiment; 
you never know what unique effect you 
might come up with.

CHAPTER 9 Production
markets where economics dictate that the 
salesperson write for his or her own account. 
Deejays also are called on to pen com-
mercials. At stations with bigger operating 
budgets, a full-time copywriter often will 
handle the bulk of the writing chores.
Copywriters must possess a complete 
understanding of the unique nature of the 
medium, a familiarity with the audience for 
which the commercial message is intended, 
and knowledge of the product being promoted. 
A station’s format will influence the style of 
writing in a commercial; thus, the copywriter 
also must be thoroughly acquainted with the 
station’s particular programming approach. 
Commercials must be compatible with the 
station’s sound. For instance, copy written for 
Lite AC usually is more conservative in tone 
than that written for Modern Rock stations, 
and so on.

number, should be repeated and ­directions 
should be as simple as possible. The use 
of landmarks (“ACROSS FROM CITY 
HALL . . .”) can reduce confusion. Listen-
ers are seldom in a position to write down 
something at the exact moment they hear 
it. Copy should communicate, not confuse 
or frustrate.
Of course, the purpose of any piece of 
copy is to sell the client’s product. Creativ-
ity plays an important role. The radio writer 
has the world of the imagination to work 
with and is limited only by the boundaries 
of his own.
Announcing Tips
Although the radio announcer ranks have 
dwindled as radio companies consolidate 
and downsize their staffs and employ voice-
tracking to serve multiple stations, thou-
sands of men and women in this country still 
make their living before the microphone. In 
few other professions is the salary range so 
broad. A beginning announcer may make 
little more than minimum wage, whereas 
a seasoned professional in a major market 
may earn a salary in the six-figure range.
Although announcer salaries can be 
very modest in smaller markets, the finan-
cial rewards tend to be substantial at 
metro market stations, which can afford to 
pay more. Of course, competition for the 
metro market station positions is keener, 
and expectations are higher. “You have to 
pay your dues in this profession. No one

Some basic rules pertain to the mechan-
ics of copy preparation. First, copy is typed 
in uppercase and is double-spaced for ease 
of reading. Next, left and right margins are 
set at 1 inch. Sound effects are noted in 
parentheses at that point in the copy where 
they are to occur. Proper punctuation and 
grammar are vital, too. A comma in the 
wrong place can throw off the meaning of 
an entire sentence. Be mindful, also, that 
commercials are designed to be heard and 
not read. Keep sentence structure as uncom-
plicated as possible. Maintaining a conversa-
tional style will make the client’s message 
more accessible.
Timing a piece of copy is relatively simple. 
There are a couple of methods: one involves 
counting words, and the other counting lines. 
In the first approach, 25 words would consti-
tute 10 seconds; 65 words, 30 seconds; and 
125 words, 1 minute. Counting lines is an 
easier and quicker way of timing copy. This 
method is based on the assumption that it 
takes, on average, 3 seconds to read one line 
of copy from margin to margin. Therefore, 
9 to 10 lines of copy would time out to 30 
seconds, and 18–20 lines to 1 minute. Of 
course, production elements such as sound 
effects and beds must be included as part 
of the count and deducted accordingly. For 
example, 6 seconds worth of sound effects 
in a 30-second commercial would shorten 
the amount of actual copy by 2 lines.
Because everything written in radio is 
intended to be read aloud, it is important 
that words with unusual or uncommon 
pronunciations be given special attention. 
Phonetic spelling is used to convey the 
way a word is pronounced. For instance: 
“DINNER AT THE FO’C’SLE (FOKE-SIL) 
RESTAURANT IN LAITONE (LAY-TON) 
SHORES IS A SEA ADVENTURE.” Incor-
rect pronunciation has resulted in more than 
one canceled account. The copywriter must 
make certain that the announcer assigned to 
voice-track a commercial is fully aware of 
any particulars in the copy. In other words, 
when in doubt spell it out.
Excessive numbers and complex direc-
tions  are to be avoided in radio copy. 
Numbers, such as an address or telephone

CHAPTER 9 Production
Voice quality still is very important in 
radio. There is an inclination toward the 
voice with a deeper register. This is true for 
female announcers as well as male. However, 
most voices possess considerable range and 
with training, practice, and experience even 
a person with a high-pitched voice can 
develop an appealing on-air sound. Forcing 
the voice into a lower register to achieve 
a deeper sound can result in injury to the 
vocal chords. “Making the most of what you 
already have is a lot better than trying to be 
something you’re not. Perfect yourself and 
be natural,” advises Morin.
Relaxation is important. The voice simply 
is at its best when it is not strained. ­Moreover, 
announcing is enhanced by proper breath-
ing, which is only possible when one is 
free of stress. Initially, being “on-mike” can 
be an intimidating experience, resulting in 
nervousness that can be debilitating. Here 
are some things announcers do to achieve a 
state of relaxation:
1.	Read copy aloud before going on the air. 
Get the feel of it. This will automati-
cally increase confidence, thus aiding in 
relaxation.
2.	Take several deep breaths and slowly 
exhale while keeping your eyes closed.
3.	Sit still for a couple of moments with 
your arms limp at your sides. Tune out. 
Let the dust settle. Conjure pleasant 
images. Allow yourself to drift a bit, and 
then slowly return to the job at hand.
4.	Stand and slowly move your upper torso 
in a circular motion for a minute or so. 
Flex your shoulders and arms. Stretch 
luxuriously.
5.	When seated, check your posture. Do not 
slump over as you announce. A curved 
diaphragm impedes breathing. Sit erect, 
but not stiffly.
6.	Hum a few bars of your favorite song. The 
vibration helps relax the throat muscles 
and vocal chords.
7.	Give yourself ample time to settle in 
before going on. Dashing into the studio 
at the last second will jar your focus and 
shake your composure.
In most situations, an accent – regional 
or otherwise – is a handicap and should be 
eliminated. Most radio announcers in the 
walks out of a classroom and into WNBC. 
It’s usually a long and winding road. It takes 
time to develop the on-air skills that the 
big stations want. It’s hard work to become 
really good, but you can make an enormous 
amount of money, or at least a very com-
fortable income, when you do,” says radio 
personality Mike Morin.
The duties of an announcer vary depend-
ing on the size or ranking of a station. In the 
small station, announcers generally fill news 
and/or production shifts as well. For example, 
a midday announcer at WXXX, who is on 
the air from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m., may be held 
responsible for the 4 and 5  p.m. newscasts, 
plus any production that arises during that 
same period. Meanwhile, the larger station 
may require nothing more of its announcers 
than the taping of voiceovers. Of course, the 
preparation for an airshift at a major-market 
station can be very time consuming.
An announcer must, above all else, 
possess the ability to effectively read copy 
aloud. Among other things, this involves 
proper enunciation and inflection, which 
are improved through practice. Program-
mer Bill Towery contends that the more 
a person reads for personal enjoyment or 
enrichment, the easier it is to communicate 
orally. “I’d advise anyone who aspires to the 
microphone to read, read, read. The more 
the better. Announcing is oral interpretation 
of the printed page. You must first under-
stand what is on the page before you can 
communicate it aloud. Bottom line here is 
that if you want to become an announcer, 
first become a reader.”
Having a naturally resonant and pleasant-
sounding voice certainly is an ­advantage.

that time, I’ve watched old positions I held 
in radio disappear to voice-tracking.”
Despite concern for the impact voice-
tracking has on the announcing profession 
and radio localism, more and more stations 
are using it, and the future would suggest 
that this practice – for better or worse – 
will grow.
The Sound Library
Music is used to enhance an advertiser’s 
message – to make it more appealing, more 
listenable. The music used in a radio com-
mercial is called a bed simply because it 
backs the voice. It is the platform on which 
the voice is set. A station may bed thou-
sands of commercials over the course of a 
year. Music is an integral component of the 
production mixdown.
South do not have a drawl, and the major-
ity of announcers in Boston put the “r” in 
the word car. A noticeable or pronounced 
accent will almost always put the candidate 
for an announcer’s job out of the running. 
Accents are not easy to eliminate, but with 
practice they can be overcome.
Voice-Tracking
In the age of station consolidation and clus-
ters (station malls), radio corporations are 
finding it cost efficient to feed their sta-
tions prerecorded voices. In other words, 
these days as much station announcing 
takes place away from the station as it 
does at the station. Radio companies hire 
announcers to provide their stations with 
their voicing needs, so there is less and less 
on-sight voice origination. One announcer 
may be the voice of a hundred stations. 
Through satellite feeds and ISDN lines, local 
station airwaves are filled with out-of-town 
voices. When voice-tracking is done at the 
station level, it is to allow more multitasking 
opportunities for the announcer. Says Ed 
Shane, “Voice-tracking is an ideal produc-
tivity tool, allowing air talent to prerecord 
their air shifts in order to use their work 
time producing commercials, appearing live 
at sponsor locations, or doing a variety of 
jobs other than waiting for songs to end in 
order to deliver a 10-second talkover.”
Voice-tracking has generated concern 
because the ranks of announcers are being 
thinned down. Jackie O’Brien, Metro Net-
works director of operations, observes, “The 
field of radio broadcasting has changed tre-
mendously over the past few years. Many 
positions have been lost due to the innova-
tion of voice-tracking. While this may be a 
cost-efficient way to run a radio group, it has 
taken away the personality of the service. 
When I started in broadcasting, I felt the 
position was more than the sound of my 
own voice. There was a commitment made 
to service the public with news, informa-
tion, and a little entertainment. This meant 
staying on through a snowstorm or cover-
ing local elections. It also meant talking the 
occasional lonely heart out of suicide. I’ve 
been at Metro Networks for four years. In

Today, sound libraries are almost always 
delivered via downloads. However, many 
stations still derive bed music from other 
sources. Demonstration CDs (demos) sent 
by recording companies to radio stations are 
a familiar source, since few actually make 
it onto playlists and into on-air rotations. 
These CDs are particularly useful because 
the music is unfamiliar to the listening audi-
ence. Known tunes generally are avoided in 
the mixdown of spots because they tend to 
distract the listener from the copy. However, 
there are times when familiar tunes are used 
to back spots. Nightclubs often request that 
popular music be used in their commercials 
to convey a certain mood and ambiance.
Movie soundtrack CDs are another good 
place to find beds because they often contain a 
variety of music, ranging from the bizarre to the 
conventional. They also are an excellent source 
for special audio effects, which can be used to 
great advantage in the right commercial.
On-air CDs are screened for potential 
production use as well. Although several 
tracks may be placed in on-air rotation and 
thereby eliminated for use in the mixdown 
of commercials, some cuts will not be pro-
grammed and therefore will not be available 
for production purposes.
Syndicated bed music libraries are avail-
able at a price and are widely used at larger 
stations. Broadcasting Yearbook contains 
a complete listing of production compa-
nies offering bed music libraries. Similarly, 
a search of the Internet will yield lists of 
audio production sources. The majority of 
stations continue to lift beds from in-house 
CDs (see Figure 9.34).
Music used for production purposes 
is catalogued so that it can be located 
and reused. Syndicated libraries come 
fully catalogued. An old system employed 
index cards, which could be stored for 
easy access in a container or on a rotating 
drum. At most stations today, computers 
are used to store production library infor-
mation and files.
If a file exists for a bed that is not in 
current use and the bed is appropriate for 
a new account, then either a fresh file will 
be prepared or the new information will be 
added into the existing file.
No production studio is complete 
without a commercial sound effects library, 
but in the digital age, many effects are 
made in‑house. Sound effects libraries can 
be purchased for as little as $100, or they 
can cost thousands. The quality and selec-
tion of effects vary accordingly. Specially 
tailored audio effects also can run into the 
thousands but can add a unique touch to a 
station’s sound.

3.  Dialogue spots, using drama and comedy 
to sell the product, became prominent in 
the 1930s. Elaborate sound effects, actors, 
and orchestras were employed.
4.  With the introduction of magnetic 
recording tape and 33 LPs in the 1950s, live 
commercial announcements were replaced 
by prerecorded messages.
5.  The copy, delivery, and mixdown of com-
mercials must be adapted to match the sta-

9.  For ease of movement and accessibility, 
both on-air and production studio equip-
ment are arranged in a U-shape.
10.  The audio console (board) is the central 
piece of equipment. It consists of inputs, 
which permit audio energy to enter the 
console; outputs through which audio 
energy is fed to other locations; VU meters, 
which measure the level of sound; pots 
(faders), which control the quantity (gain) 
of sound; monitor gains, which control 
in‑studio volume; and master gains, which 
control general output levels.
11.  When operating the console in cue 
mode, the operator can listen to various 
audio sources without channeling them 
through an output.
12.  Digital cart audio devices (360 Systems) 
have replaced the standard analog cart deck. 
They let producers digitally mix and archive 
extensive amounts of audio.
13.  Compact disc players use a laser beam 
to decode the disc’s surface, which elimi-
nates stylus and turntable noises, distortion, 
and record damage. Recordable CDs are 
now in use.
14.  Audio processors, samplers, digital 
carts, and MIDI enhance a radio produc-
tion studio’s product. Software such as 
Cool Edit Pro and Pro Tools have these 
features built in.
15.  A patch panel is a routing device, con-
sisting of inputs and outputs, connecting the 
audio console with various external sources.
16.  Microphones are designed with ­different 
pickup patterns to accommodate different 
functions: omnidirectional (all directions), 
bidirectional (two directions), and unidirec-
tional (one direction).
17.  Audio editing ranges from simple 
repairs to complicated rearrangements of 
sound elements. Today the once conven-
tional razor-cut approach to tape editing has 
been replaced by nondestructive computer 
and multitrack methods.
18.  Digital audio workstations, which rely 
on computer technology and software 
(Pro Tools is very popular), are currently 
used in a vast number of radio production 
studios.
19.  The station copywriter, who writes the 
commercials, promos, and PSAs, must be 
familiar with the intended audience and the 
product being sold. The station’s format and 
programming approach influence the style 
of writing. Copy should be typed in upper-
case, be double-spaced, and have 1-inch 
margins. Sound effects are noted in paren-
theses, and phonetic spellings are provided 
for difficult words.
20.  Aspiring announcers must be able to 
read copy aloud with proper inflection 
and enunciation. A naturally resonant and 
pleasant-sounding voice without a regional 
accent is an advantage.

originates elsewhere, especially in cluster 
operations and when stations are a part of 
major station groups.
22.  Every station maintains a sound library 
for use in spot mixdowns. Commercially pro-
duced sound effects, bed music collections, 
and unfamiliar cuts from CDs and the 
Internet (and even LPs) are common source 
materials. Digital equipment and computer 
workstations allow producers to create their 
own in-house effects.

electrical oscillations and transmitting them 
from an antenna proved far more effec-
tive. Fessenden’s wireless voice message was 
received hundreds of miles away.
Few pioneer broadcast technologists con-
tributed as much as Edwin Armstrong. His 
development of the regenerative and super-
heterodyne circuits vastly improved receiver 
efficiency. In the 1920s Armstrong worked 
at developing a static-free mode of broad-
casting, and in 1933 he demonstrated the 
results of his labor – FM. Armstrong was a 
man ahead of his time. It would be decades 
before his innovation would fully be appre-
ciated, and he would not live to witness the 
tremendous strides it would take.
Had it not been for these men, and many 
others like them, there would be no radio 
medium. Today’s broadcast engineers and 
technologists continue in the tradition of 
Engineering 10
Pioneer Engineers
Radio at its core is a technology. Therefore, 
anyone who has ever spoken into a micro-
phone or sat before a radio receiver owes 
an immense debt of gratitude to the many 
technical innovators who made it possible. 
Guglielmo Marconi, a diminutive Italian 
with enormous genius, first used electro-
magnetic (radio) waves to send a message. 
Marconi made his historical transmission, 
and several others, in the last decade of 
the nineteenth century. Relying, at least in 
part, on the findings of two earlier scientists, 
James Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz, 
Marconi developed his wireless telegraph, 
thus revolutionizing the field of electronic 
communications.
Other wireless innovators made significant 
contributions to the refinement of Marconi’s 
device. J. Ambrose Fleming developed the 
diode tube in 1904, and 2 years later Lee de 
Forest created the three-element triode tube 
called the Audion. Both innovations, along 
with many others, expanded the capability 
of the wireless.
In 1906, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated 
the transmission of voice over the wireless 
from his experimental station at Brant Rock, 
Massachusetts. Until that time, Marconi’s 
invention had been used to send Morse code 
or coded messages. An earlier experiment 
in the transmission of voice via the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum also had been con-
ducted. In 1892, on a small farm in Murray, 
Kentucky, Nathan B. Stubblefield managed 
to send voice across a field using the induc-
tion method of transmission, yet Fessenden’s 
method of mounting sound impulses atop

convert the carrier into sound waves, and 
­distribute them to the frequency tuned. Thus, 
in order for a station assigned a frequency of 
950 kHz (a kilohertz equals 1000 hertz [Hz]) 
to reach a radio tuned to that position on the 
dial, it must alter its carrier wave 950,000 
cycles (Hz) per second. The tuner counts the 
incoming radio frequency.
AM/FM
AM and FM stations are located at differ-
ent points in the spectrum: AM stations 
are assigned frequencies between 540 and 
1700 kHz on the Standard Broadcast band, 
and FM stations are located between 88.1 
and 107.9 MHz (megahertz equals 1 million 
hertz) on the FM band.
Ten kilocycles (kc) separate frequencies in 
AM, and there are 200 kc between FM fre-
quencies. FM broadcasters utilize 30 kc for 
over-the-air transmissions and are permitted 
to provide subcarrier transmission (SCA) to 
subscribers on the remaining frequency.  The 
larger channel width provides FM listeners a 
better opportunity to fine-tune their favor-
ite stations as well as to receive broadcasts 
in stereo. To achieve parity, AM broadcasters 
developed a way to transmit in stereo, and 
by 1990 hundreds were doing so. The fine-
tuning edge still belongs to FM, because its 
sidebands (15 kc) are three times wider than 
AM’s (5 kc).
FM broadcasts at a much higher frequency 
(millions of cycles per second) compared 
to AM (thousands of cycles per second). At 
such a high frequency, FM is immune to 
low-­frequency emissions, which plague AM. 
Although a car motor or an electric storm gen-
erally will interfere with AM reception, FM is 
static free. Broadcast engineers have attempted 
to improve the quality of the AM band, but 
the basic nature of the lower ­frequency makes 
AM simply more prone to interference than 
FM. FM broadcasters see this as a key com-
petitive advantage and refer to AM’s move to 
stereo as “stereo with static.”
Signal Propagation
The paths of AM and FM signals differ from 
one another. Ground waves create AM’s 
primary service area as they travel across 
their forebears. Without their knowledge 
and expertise, there would be no broad-
cast industry because there would be no 
medium. Radio is first and foremost an engi-
neer’s medium. It is engineers who put the 
stations on the air and keep them there.
Radio Technology
Radio broadcasters utilize part of the electro-
magnetic spectrum to transmit their signals, 
and they are obliged to pay spectrum fees of 
up to $1500 annually (depending on their 
size) for this privilege. A natural resource, 
the electromagnetic spectrum is composed 
of radio waves at the low-frequency end 
and cosmic rays at the high-frequency end. 
In the spectrum between are infrared rays, 
light rays, X rays, and gamma rays. Broad-
casters, of course, use the radio wave portion 
of the spectrum for their purposes.
Electromagnetic waves carry broadcast 
transmissions (radio frequency) from station 
to receiver. It is the function of the transmit-
ter to generate and shape the radio wave to 
conform to the frequency the station has 
been assigned by the FCC. Audio current 
is sent by a line from the control room to 
the transmitter. The current then modulates 
the carrier wave so that it may achieve its 
authorized frequency. A carrier wave that 
is undisturbed by audio current is called an 
unmodulated carrier.
The antenna radiates the radio frequency. 
Receivers are designed to pick up ­transmissions,

the earth’s surface. High-power AM stations 
are able to reach listeners hundreds of miles 
away during the day. At night AM’s signal 
is reflected by the atmosphere (ionosphere), 
thus creating a skywave that carries con-
siderably farther, sometimes thousands of 
miles. Skywaves constitute AM’s secondary 
service area.
In contrast to AM signal radiation, FM 
propagates its radio waves in a direct or 
line-of-sight pattern. FM stations are not 
affected by evening changes in the atmo-
sphere and generally do not carry as far 
as AM stations. A high-power FM station 
may reach listeners within an 80- to 100-
mile radius because its signal weakens as 
it approaches the horizon. Because FM 
outlets radiate direct waves, antenna height 
becomes nearly as important as power. In 
general, the higher an FM antenna, the 
farther the signal travels.
Skywave Interference
The fact that AM station signals travel 
greater distances at night is a mixed bless-
ing. Although some stations benefit from 
the expanded coverage area created by the 
skywave phenomenon, many do not. In 
fact, over 2000 radio stations around the 
country must cease operation near sunset, 
and thousands more must make substan-
tial transmission adjustments to prevent 
interference. For example, many stations 
must decrease power after sunset to ensure 
noninterference with others on the same 
frequency: WXXX-AM is 5000 W (5 kW) 
during the day, but at night it must drop to 
1000 W (1 kW). Another measure designed 
to prevent interference requires that certain 
stations direct their signals away from sta-
tions on the same frequency. Directional 
stations require two or more antennas to 
shape the pattern of their radiation, whereas 
a nondirectional station that distributes its 
signal evenly in all directions needs only a 
single antenna. Because of its limited direct 
wave signal, FM is not subject to the post-
sunset operating constraints that affect most 
AM outlets.
Station Classifications
To guarantee the efficient use of the broad-
cast spectrum, the FCC established a classifi-
cation system for both AM and FM stations. 
Under this system, the nation’s 10,000 radio 
outlets operate free of the debilitating inter-
ference that plagued broadcasters prior to 
the Radio Act of 1927.

AM classifications are as follows:
•	 Class A: Clear channel stations with 
power not exceeding 50 kW. Their fre-
quencies are protected from interference 
up to 750 miles. Among the pioneer, or 
oldest, stations in the country are KDKA, 
WBZ, WSM, and WJR.
•	 Class B: Stations with power ranging from 
a minimum of 250 W to a maximum of 
50 kW. They must protect Class I outlets 
by altering their signals around sunset. As 
a Class B station, WINZ-AM in Miami 
is required to reduce power from 50 kW 
to 250 W so as not to intrude on other 
stations at 940 kHz. These stations also 
operate on regional channels. If a station 
is authorized to operate in the expanded 
band (1610–1700), the maximum power 
is 10 kW.
•	 Class C: Stations that operate on local and 
regional channels with power between 
250 and 1000 W. They may operate 
without time restrictions.
•	 Class D: Stations that operate either 
daytime, limited time, or unlimited time 
with a nighttime power less than 250 W. 
Daytime-only stations are Class D.
Section 73.21 of the Code of Federal Regu-
lations, Part 73, provides more details on 
AM station classifications.
New AM band space (1605–1705 kHz) 
is currently being allocated, and the FCC is 
encouraging existing AM license holders to 
shift to the new space as a means of reduc-
ing interference on the clogged band.
FM classifications include the following:
•	 Class C: The most powerful FM outlets 
with the greatest service parameters, these 
stations may be assigned a maximum 
ERP of 100 kW and a tower height of up 
to 2000 feet. Class C radio waves carry, 
on average, 70 miles from their point of 
transmission.
•	 Class B: These stations operate with less 
power – up to 50 kW – than Class Cs and 
are intended to serve smaller areas. The 
maximum antenna height for stations in 
this class is 500 feet, and signals generally 
do not reach beyond 40–50 miles.
•	 Class A: The least powerful of commercial 
FM stations; they seldom exceed 3 kW ERP 
(except in select cases where a ceiling of 
6 kW is imposed) and 328 feet in antenna 
height. The average service contour for sta-
tions in this category is 10–20 miles.
•	 Class D: Set aside for noncommercial 
stations with 10 W ERP, this type of 
station is most apt to be licensed to a 
school or college.

Chapter 10 Engineering

In the 1980s, the FCC introduced three 
new classes of FM stations under Docket 
80–90 in an attempt to provide several 
hundred additional frequencies, and more 
subclasses were added later. They are as 
follows:
•	 Class C1: Stations granted licenses to 
operate within this classification may be 
authorized to transmit up to 100 kW ERP 
with antennas not exceeding 984 feet. 
The maximum reach of stations in this 
class is about 50 miles.
•	 Class C2: The operating parameters of 
stations in Class C2 are close to Class Bs. 
The maximum power granted Class C2 
outlets is 50 kW, and antennas may not 
exceed 492 feet. Class C2 stations reach 
approximately 35 miles.
•	 Class C3: These stations operate with 
shorter antennas and with power that 
typically exceeds 6 kW ERP.
•	 Class B1: The maximum antenna height 
permitted for Class B1 stations (328 feet) 
is identical to Class As; however, Class 
B1s are assigned at least 25 kW ERP. Class 
B1 signals carry 25–30 miles.

Boeing HS 702 satellites) were set aloft in a 
­geostationary orbit, Sirius Satellite Radio’s 
birds (three SS/L-1300 satellites) rotate in 
an elliptical pattern ensuring that each satel-
lite spends around 16 hours over the United 
States. Offering CD-quality digital radio, 
these satellite radio signals are beamed to 
nearly 10 million receiving dishes located 
in cars and homes. Satellite radio uses the 
S-band (2.3 GHz) for its digital audio radio 
service (DARS). Both services keep a satel-
lite ready for launch in the event one of 
their satellites malfunctions. Program origi-
nation from ground stations are uplinked 
to the satellites and then relayed to ter-
restrial end users (subscribers). Receivers 
unscramble the incoming signals, which 
offer over 100 channels each. In addition, 
the signals contain encoded data for display 
on receivers allowing listeners to see what is 
being broadcast (artist, song, etc.). Ground 
repeaters are employed when needed to 
strengthen incoming satellite signals. An 
international satellite radio service called 
WorldSpace utilizes the L-band to provide 
digital audio to Africa and Asia. According 
to former XM Satellite’s chief program-
mer, Lee Abrams, the operation’s techni-
cal department consists of four key areas: 
studios, hardware development, satellites 
and repeaters, and IT.
Internet Radio
Since the 1990s, radio has been available 
over the Internet. There are two types of 
Internet radio stations: those generated 
by broadcast stations and those that are 
Web-only in origin. In the case of the first 
LPFM classifications include the following:
Class L1: 50–100 W ERP
Class L2: 1–10 W ERP
In view of the ongoing revisions made to 
FM classifications, we suggest you consult 
Section 73.210 of the current Code of 
Federal Regulations, Part 73.

medium’s appeal, which has been battling 
copyright issues concerning the use of music 
through the decade.
The process of distributing an Internet 
radio signal is not complex. Internet radio 
operations possess an encoding computer, 
which converts the audio in a stream. The 
audio is then sent to a server and it routes 
the audio data over the Internet to the com-
puter plug-in of the end-user/listener.
Digital Audio Broadcasting  
(HD Radio)
Radio has been undergoing a metamorpho-
sis as analog signal processing is being sup-
planted by digital processing. The reason for 
category, stations typically simulcast their 
broadcast signals over the Web. The second 
category of Internet station is typically 
more eclectic in its programming offerings, 
because the formatting constraints preva-
lent in broadcast radio do not exist in the 
independent, cyber-only outlets. Unlike 
traditional terrestrial stations, whose reach 
and operating parameters are limited, there 
are no geographical limitations in Internet 
radio. With Web access, anyone anywhere 
can enjoy the medium. A Web station ema-
nating from Dayton, Ohio, may be heard in 
Bangkok, Thailand, and tens of thousands 
of broadcasts are available. Unlike terres-
trial and satellite radio, Internet radio has 
the capability of providing a full range of 
visual data, such as photos, text, and links. 
Interactivity also adds further cache to the

the transformation is simple: the demand 
for better and more evolved sound is at 
an all-time high. Broadcast stations must 
convert to digital, or they will not be com-
petitive with audio alternatives, such as 
MP3 players, satellite radio, and mobile 
music services.
The full conversion to digital broadcast-
ing is being planned and is likely to be com-
pletely realized within a few years. At the 
1992 World Administrative Radio Confer-
ence (WARC), conducted by the Interna-
tional Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 
Spain, the FCC proposed use of the S-band

(2310–2360 MHz) for the propagation of 
DAB signals.
Although some things remain to be 
resolved, in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital 
radio, as created by iBiquity, has been given 
the go-ahead. This is something the NAB 
has long supported as a way of maintaining 
a station’s brand identity as established by 
its frequency numbers.
Although the present system of analog 
broadcasting essentially replicates sound 
waves (with inherent shortcomings), digital 
converts sound waves into a bit-stream of 1’s 
and 0’s for processing into a low ­bandwidth.

products. Part of their appeal, according 
to telecommunications professor Ernest 
Hakanen, is the fact that they “will allow 
for much more faithfulness of signal repro-
duction. High-definition (HD) receivers are 
designed to use reflected signals as alter-
native sources of information when the 
primary signal deteriorates. Using receiv-
ers that correct the fading and interference 
problems associated with AM and FM 
broadcasts, DAB signals that include spe-
cific information that can ‘tell’ the receiver 
how to compensate for information lost 
between transmitter and receiver can be 
received.”
Eventually, the existing analog system 
of AM and FM broadcasting will be passé. 
It is not likely, however, that the conver-
sion to digital will occur overnight. Some 
predict that analog broadcasting will be 
around for a few more years and that, even 
when digital is the preeminent broadcasting 
system, analog AM and FM stations will 
still be out there – that is, until the FCC 
no longer perceives them as providing a 
viable service. In any event, the switch to 
digital is mandated, and so digital is inevi-
table. Analog broadcasting will go the way 
of the turntable.
Radio engineer Aaron Reed expresses 
his views on the issues that will confront 
the full implementation of digital radio. 
“Dealing with the political boondoggle and 
the necessary paradigm shift in how ‘radio’ 
will be done after its implementation 
(from the technical changes necessary to 
augment the programming delivery to the 
altering of the way people think of radio 
as a mostly one-way medium) will prove 
a major challenge to any engineer. Couple 
that with station managers demanding they 
be digital because ‘the other guy is’ but 
then balking at the hefty price and you 
can see the problems. It won’t be easy, and 
inevitably many stations will try to do it 
on the cheap and fail because DAB is not 
something that can be done incrementally. 
Just saying your station is digital is not 
going to get the listeners. Something far 
more radical in the programming services 
that stations offer will be required. The 
potential is there. Whether engineers and 
their moneymen are willing to do it is the 
big question.”
In digital, sound waves are assigned numeric 
values and become coded pulses.
Simply put, in digital, sounds are quanti-
fied. This allows a more accurate represen-
tation of audio signals. Unlike analog, which 
is limited in what it can reproduce, digital 
provides greater frequency response and 
dynamic range. Thus, more audio informa-
tion is conveyed to the listener, who hears 
more. Another positive feature from the 
broadcast operator’s perspective is the fact 
that digital signals do not require as much 
power as do analog signals.
Obviously, the transition to digital 
requires the manufacture of new receiv-
ers, and several companies now offer such

Smart Receivers
It is now possible to get more than just audio 
from a radio receiver. The new HD sets and 
satellite radio receivers are programmable 
and provide visual screens offering copious 
data. In fact, consumers are able to format 
scan without actually having to listen to 
stations. These so-called smart receivers 
feature emergency alerting capabilities, 
traffic announcements, advertisements and 
promos, music tagging options, and other 
informational services via a built-in LCD 
display panel. This was proposed in the early 
1990s by Radio Broadcast Data Systems but 
never realized. Now with the existence of 
digital and satellite radio it has come to 
fruition.
Some programmers opposed the idea 
of “sightradio” (a throwback term used to 
describe television at its onset) because 
they felt that it was difficult to categorize 
a format given the existing options, espe-
cially with a limited number of letters. The 
thought of a quasi-teletext component to 
radio inspires mixed emotions in many 
broadcasters. Will people be watching radio, 
and what exactly will that mean? In the 
main, however, “screen” radio is perceived 
as an important value-added feature for the 
medium, and ­something it must offer in the 
computer age.
Although it is difficult at this time to 
predict the future impact and role of these 
innovations, it is certain, with the conver-
sion to digital, that eventually receivers will 
do more than simply tune frequencies.
One other plus offered by smart-receiver 
technology is that it will allow car radios 
to automatically retune a different station 
offering the same format when a vehicle 
leaves the coverage area of the first station.
Becoming an Engineer
Most station managers or chief engineers look 
for experience when hiring technical people. 
Formal training such as college ranks high 
but not as high as actual hands-on technical 
experience. “A good electronics background 
is preferred, of course. This doesn’t neces-
sarily mean 10 years of ­experience or an 
advanced degree in electronic ­engineering, 
FIGURE 10.18

but rather a person with a solid ­foundation 
in the fundamentals of radio electronics, 
perhaps derived from an interest in amateur 
radio, computers, or another hobby of a 
technical nature. This is a good starting 
point. Actually, it has been my experience 
that people with this kind of a background 
are more attuned to the nature of this busi-
ness. You don’t need a person with a physics 
degree from MIT, but what you do want is 
someone with a natural inclination for the 
technical side. Ideally speaking, you want 
to hire a person with a tech history as well 
as some formal in-class training,” contends 
Kevin McNamara, Director of Engineering, 
Beasley Broadcasting Group.
Chief engineer Jim Puriez concurs. “A 
formal education in electronics is good, but 
not essential. In this business if you have 
the desire and natural interest, you can learn 
from the inside out. You don’t find that 
many broadcast engineers with actual elec-
tronics degrees. Of course, most have taken 
basic electronics courses. The majority are 
long on experience and have acquired their 
skills on the job. While a college degree is a 
nice credential, I think most managers hire 
tech people on the basis of experience more 
than anything else.”
Station engineer Sid Schweiger also cites 
experience as the key criterion for gaining

an examination. An understanding of basic 
broadcast electronics and knowledge of the 
FCC rules and regulations pertaining to 
station technical operations were necessary 
to pass the lengthy examination. Today a sta-
tion’s chief engineer (also called chief opera-
tor) need possess only a Restricted Operator 
Permit. Those who held First Class licenses 
prior to their elimination now receive either 
a Restricted Operator Permit or a General 
Radiotelephone license at renewal time.
It is left to the discretion of the individual 
radio station to establish criteria regarding 
engineer credentials. Many do require a 
General Radiotelephone license or certifica-
tion from associations, such as the Society of 
Broadcast Engineers (SBE) or the National 
Association of Radio and Telecommunica-
tions Engineers (NARTE), as a preliminary 
means of establishing a prospective engi-
neer’s qualifications. The appendix at the 
end of this chapter contains a reproduction 
of SBE’s membership application form.
Communication skills rank highest on 
the list of personal qualities for station 
­engineers, according to McNamara. “The old 
a broadcast engineer’s position. “When I’m 
in the market for a tech person, I’ll check 
smaller market stations for someone inter-
ested in making the move to a larger station. 
This way, I’ve got someone with experience 
right from the start. The little station is a good 
place for the newcomer to gain experience.”
In his column in Radio World (June 9, 
1999), editor Paul J. McLane lamented the 
dearth of young people entering the field and 
the need for specialists with various technical 
and computer skills. Wrote McLane, “Fluency 
never stops. People I respect say radio engi-
neers should learn to think large, and that 
goes for digital audio and data training.”
Numerous schools and colleges offer 
formal training in electronics. The number 
shrinks somewhat when it comes to those 
institutions actually providing curricula in 
broadcast engineering. However, a number 
of technical schools do offer basic electronics 
courses applicable to broadcast operations.
Before August 1981, the FCC required 
that broadcast engineers hold a First Class 
Radiotelephone license. To receive the 
license, applicants were expected to pass

also is available should a technical problem 
arise. Larger stations and cluster operations 
with more studios and operating ­equipment 
often employ an engineer on a full-time 
basis. It is a question of economics. The 
small station can little afford a ­day-to-day 
engineer, whereas the larger station or 
cluster usually finds that it can ill afford to 
do without one.
Beasley Broadcast Group’s McNamara 
considers protecting the station’s license his 
number one priority. “A station is only as 
good as its license to operate. If it loses it, 
the show is over. No other area of a station 
is under such scrutiny by the FCC as is the 
technical. The dereg movement in recent 
years has affected programming much more 
than engineering. My job is to first keep the 
station honest, that is, in compliance with 
the commission’s rules. This means, keep 
the station operating within the assigned 
operating parameters, i.e., power, antenna 
phase, modulation, and so on, and to take 
corrective action if needed.”
Chief engineer Steve Church says that 
maintenance and equipment repairs consume 
a large portion of an engineer’s time. “General 
repairs keep you busy. One moment you may 
be adjusting a pot on a studio console and the 
next replacing a part on some remote equip-
ment. A broadcast facility is an amalgam of 
equipment that requires care and attention. 
Problems must be detected early or they 
can snowball. The proper installation of new 
equipment eliminates the chance of certain 
­stereotype of the station ‘tech-head’ in white 
socks, chinos, and shirt-pocket pen holder 
weighed down by its inky contents is losing 
its validity. Today, more than ever, I think, 
the radio engineer must be able to commu-
nicate with members of the staff from the 
manager to the deejay. Good interpersonal 
skills are necessary. Things have become 
very sophisticated, and engineers play an 
integral role in the operation of a facility, 
perhaps more now than in the past. The 
field of broadcast engineering has become 
more competitive, too, with the elimination 
of many operating requirements.”
Because of a number of regulation changes 
in the 1980s, most notably the elimination 
of upper-grade license requirements, the 
prospective engineer now comes under 
even closer scrutiny by station management. 
The day when a “1st phone” was enough to 
get an engineering job is gone. There is no 
direct “ticket” anymore. As in most other 
areas of radio, skill, experience, and training 
open the doors the widest.
Because the very landscape of radio has 
changed as the result of the Telecommunica-
tions Act of 1996, station clusters abound. This 
means a chief engineer or director of a cluster’s 
technical operation has formidable responsi-
bilities. Instead of keeping one station on the 
air, this person may have as many as eight 
signals to watch over. In cluster operations, 
there may be several experienced engineers 
on site or one senior engineer who directs the 
duties of several techs and producers.
The Engineer’s Duties
The FCC requires that all stations designate 
someone as chief operator. This individual is 
responsible for a station’s technical opera-
tions. Equipment repairs and adjustments, as 
well as weekly inspections and calibrations 
of the station transmitter, remote control 
equipment, and monitoring and metering 
systems, fall within the chief operator’s area 
of responsibility.
Depending on the makeup and size of 
a station or cluster, either a full-time or 
part-time engineer will be contracted. Many 
small outlets find they can get by with a 
weekly visit by a qualified engineer who 
FIGURE 10.21

of certain ­requirements, namely, the tech 
logs, a station is still required to meet the 
operating ­stipulations of their license. Actu-
ally, enforcement action has been on the 
rise at the FCC, perhaps in reaction to the 
deregs. The commission is really interested 
in station technical operations. Keeping daily 
logs ensures compliance,” says McNamara.
§ 73.1820 Station Log
(a) Entries must be made in the station 
log either manually by a properly licensed 
operator in actual charge of the transmitting 
apparatus, or by automatic devices meeting 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section. Indications of operating param-
eters that are required to be logged must 
be logged prior to any adjustment of the 
equipment. Where adjustments are made to 
restore parameters to their proper operating 
values, the corrected indications must be 
logged and accompanied, if any parameter 
deviation was beyond a prescribed toler-
ance, by a notation describing the nature 
of the corrective action. Indications of all 
parameters whose values are affected by 
the modulation of the carrier must be read 
without modulation. The actual time of 
observation must be included in each log 
entry. The following information must be 
entered:
(1) All stations: (i) Entries required by 
§  17.49 of this chapter concerning any 
observed or otherwise known extinguishment 
or improper functioning of a tower light:
(A) The nature of such extinguishment 
or improper functioning.
(B) The date and time the extinguish-
ment or improper operation was observed 
or otherwise noted.
(C) The date, time and nature of adjust-
ments, repairs or replacements made.
(ii) Any entries not specifically required in 
this section, but required by the instrument 
of authorization or elsewhere in this part.
(iii) An entry of each test of the EAS 
procedures pursuant to the requirement of 
Subpart G of this part and the appropriate 
EAS checklist. All stations may keep EAS 
test data in a special EAS log, which shall 
be maintained at any convenient location; 
however, such log should be considered a 
part of the station log.
problems later on. The station’s chief must 
be adept at a whole lot.”
Other duties of the chief engineer include 
training techs, monitoring radiation levels, 
planning maintenance schedules, and han-
dling a budget. Many stations hire outside 
engineering firms to conduct performance 
proofs, but it is ultimately the ­responsibility 
of the chief operator to ensure that the 
outlet meets its technical performance level. 
Proofs ascertain whether a station’s audio 
equipment performance measurements fall 
within the prescribed parameters. A sta-
tion’s frequency response, harmonic distor-
tion, FM noise level, AM noise level, stereo 
separation, crosstalk, and subcarrier suppres-
sion are gauged. If found adequate, the proof 
is passed. If not, the chief sees to it that 
necessary adjustments are made. Although 
the FCC no longer requires Proof of Per-
formance checks, many stations continue to 
observe the practice as a fail-safe measure.
The duties of a station engineer are wide 
ranging and demanding. It is a position 
that requires a thorough grasp of electron-
ics relative to the broadcast environment, 
knowledge of FCC rules and regulations 
pertaining to station technical operations, 
and, ­especially in the case of the chief engi-
neer, the ability to manage finances and 
people.
Station Log
In 1983, the FCC dispensed with its require-
ment that radio stations keep maintenance 
and operating logs. In their place the com-
mission created a new and considerably 
modified document called the Station Log, 
which stations must maintain. The new 
log requires that information pertaining to 
tower light malfunctions, Emergency Alert 
System (EAS) tests, and AM directional 
antenna systems be entered. Station Logs 
are kept on file for a period of 2 years.
Despite the fact that the FCC has elimi-
nated the more involved logging proce-
dures, some stations continue to employ 
the old system. “I like the accountabil-
ity that maintenance and operating logs 
provide. We still use them here, and they 
are inspected daily. Despite the elimination

1981; 49 FR 33663, Aug. 24, 1984)
The Emergency Alert System
In 1994, the FCC established the EAS, 
which replaced the old Emergency Broad-
cast System (EBS). The EBS came into exis-
tence following World War II as the nation 
and the world entered the nuclear age. The 
system was designed to provide the presi-
dent and heads of state and local govern-
ment with a way to communicate with the 
public in the event of a major emergency.
In the 1990s, EBS was viewed as out-
moded due to the revolution in technology, 
and it was significantly revamped. EAS is 
intended to upgrade the effectiveness of 
broadcast warnings by employing digital 
equipment and sophisticated automa-
tion. Its speed and timeliness are greatly 
enhanced under the new protocol. Stations 
were expected to have the new EAS system 
fully installed by mid-1997. At present, sta-
tions take the following steps should the 
president and/or heads of state and local 
government agencies deem it necessary to 
alert the public of a potential or imminent 
disaster:
1.	Receive Emergency Action Notification 
(EAN) via AP/UPI feeds, network feed, 
(8) The indicating equipment conforms 
to the requirements of § 73.1215 (indicat-
ing instruments – specifications) except 
that the scales need not exceed 2 inches in 
length. Arbitrary scales may not be used.
(c) In preparing the station log, original 
data may be recorded in rough form and later 
transcribed into the log. (43 FR 45854, Oct. 
4, 1978, as amended at 44 FR 5873, Oct. 
11, 1979; 47 FR 24580, June 7, 1982; 48 FR 
38481, Aug. 24, 1983; 48 FR 4480, Sept. 30, 
1983; 49 FR 33603, Aug. 23, 1984)
§ 73.1835 Special Technical Records
The FCC may require a broadcast station 
licensee to keep operating and maintenance 
records as necessary to resolve conditions 
of actual or potential interference, rule 
violations, or deficient technical operation. 
(48 FR 38482, Aug. 24, 1983)
§ 73.1840 Retention of Logs
(a) Any log required to be kept by station 
licensees shall be retained by them for a 
period of 2 years. However, logs involving 
communications incident to a disaster or 
which include communications incident to 
or involved in an investigation by the FCC 
and about which the licensee has been noti-
fied, shall be retained by the licensee until 
specifically authorized in writing by the 
FCC to destroy them. Logs incident to or 
involved in any claim or complaint of which 
the licensee has notice shall be retained by 
the licensee until such claim or complaint 
has been fully satisfied or until the same has 
been barred by statute limiting the time for 
filing of suits upon such claims.
(b) Logs may be retained on microfilm, 
microfiche, or other data-storage systems 
subject to the following conditions:
1. Suitable viewing-reading devices shall 
be available to permit FCC inspection of 
logs pursuant to § 73.1226, availability to 
FCC of station logs and records.
2. Reproduction of logs, stored on data-
storage systems, to full-size copies, is 
required of licensees if requested by the 
FCC or the public as authorized by FCC 
rules. Such reproductions must be com-
pleted within two full work days of the time 
of the request.

The FCC and Radio
In evaluating the service to the 
radio medium provided by the Federal 
Communications Commission, it is 
necessary to understand that the Com-
mission was created by Congress in 
the Communications Act of 1934 and 
that the agency, therefore, carries out 
the wishes of that body. If the Commis-
sion wants to implement regulations for 
which it lacks the statutory authority, it 
must first obtain the approval of Con-
gress.
The Commission’s service to the 
radio medium is twofold. First, it sets 
the technical standards under which the 
medium operates. Second, it ensures 
an adequate and equitable distribution 
of radio services throughout the United 
States. The Commission was created 
by Congress to specifically carry out 
these objectives. Prior to the existence 
of the Commission and its predecessor, 
the Federal Radio Commission, radio 
broadcasting in this country was in a 
state of chaos. There was no spectrum 
planning. Operators put the stations on 
the air wherever they wanted. If a new 
station caused interference to a station 
already on the air, the operator of the 
older station often would just increase 
power – sort of an electronic shouting 
match. There were also no standards 
for radio receivers to prevent them from 
causing radiofrequency interference. 
So when Congress created the FCC, 
it charged it with making the radio 
medium “serve the public interest need 
and necessity.”
The Commission’s principal missions 
are accomplished with this objective in 
mind. Some of the agency’s rules set 
minimum and maximum power require-
ments for radio stations; others set inter-
ference and distance standards – all 
with the objective of making sure that 
when a listener tunes to a radio station, 
he or she will be able to hear it clearly. 
The Commission’s role in setting techni-
cal standards also extends to the equip-
ment used in the transmission of radio 
signals. Manufacturers of transmitters 
and receivers are required to receive 
FCC “type acceptance” approval 
before putting their products on the 
market. This insures that a clean signal 
is transmitted and received and that the 
equipment does not cause interference 
to other stations or electronic services. 
Other Commission rules deal with 
spectrum planning and are intended 
to ensure an equitable distribution of 
radio stations throughout the country so 
that as many communities as possible 
will have a local radio station and pos-
sibly access to several different stations 
to provide a multitude of voices.
The Commission recognizes the 
different types of services that radio 
stations provide to listeners. To this 
end, it will often establish rules to 
foster the growth of a group of sta-
tions providing a unique service. For 
example, in 1945 the Commission 
reserved the first 20 channels in the 
FM band (88.1–91.9 MHz) for radio 
stations licensed to nonprofit, educa-
tional institutions and organizations 
to be operated as noncommercial, 
educational radio stations. The Com-
mission then established a set of rules 
for this type of station, including both 
technical standards and spectrum 
planning. Similarly, in 2000 the Com-
mission accepted applications for the 
first Low Power FM (“LPFM”) stations 
to further enhance the public’s access 
to local, noncommercial FM radio 
stations.
Finally, in looking at the Commi- 
ssion’s service to the radio medium, 
one must realize that the Communica-
tions Act is a living document. It has 
been amended many times to allow for 
new technologies in the radio medium, 
and the Commission has implemented 
regulations to carry out these changes. 
There is no doubt that the Communica-
tions Act will continue to be amended 
to take into consideration future 
changes in radio service and the Com-
mission will proscribe regulations imple-
menting these changes.

Communications Commission.

Stations not designated to remain in opera-
tion in the event of an EAN then remove their 
carriers from the air after advising ­listeners 
where to tune for further ­information. 
Those participating stations continue to 
broadcast information as it is received from 
the nation’s base of operations. Every radio 
station is required to install and operate an 
EAS monitor. Failure to do so can result in a 
substantial penalty imposed by the FCC.
Stations are also required to test the EAS 
by airing both an announcement and an 
attention signal. EAS tests are documented 
in the Station Log when they are broadcast. 
The entry must include the time and the 
date of the test.
292	
Chapter 10 Engineering

The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) makes funds available to 
stations designated to remain on the air 
during an authentic emergency through the 
Broadcast Station Protection Plan. Under 
this provision the government provides 
financial assistance to EAS stations for the 
purpose of constructing and equipping a 
shelter designed to operate for at least 14 
days under emergency conditions.
In the 1990s, the FCC began an inquiry 
into whether the system needed updating or 
replacement. Critics of the old EBS claimed 
that the system had become obsolete. In 
late 1992, proposed EBS revisions included 
the following:
•	 Replacement of the existing emergency 
alerting system.
•	 Updating of EBS equipment.
•	 Cable media involvement in emergency 
alerting.
•	 Self-testing of the system.
•	 Mandated equipment standards.
•	 Rules to prohibit false and deceptive use 
of the system.
•	 Revised EBS test script.
Today EAS embraces many of these 
­revisions, as well as additional innova-
tions and procedures. It is always a system 
under evaluation as world events, such 
as 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, increase 
the need for an effective emergency alert 
system.
Automation
The FCC’s decision in the mid-1960s 
­requiring that AM/FM operations in markets 
with populations of more than 100,000 
originate separate programming 50% of the 
time provided significant impetus to radio 
automation. Before then combo stations, 
as they were called, simulcast their AM 
programming on FM primarily as a way of 
curtailing expenses. FM was still the poor 
second cousin of AM. (In the late 1980s, 
the FCC dropped most of its simulcast 
requirements. Since then many stations 
have resorted to simulcasting as a means of 
dealing with the realities of fierce competi-
tion and a declining AM market.)

Today, over a third of all commercial sta-
tions are automated. Some are fully auto-
mated (computer driven); others rely on 
automation for part of their broadcast day. 
Automation is far more prevalent on FM, 
but in the late 1970s and 1980s many AM 
outlets were employing automation systems 
to present Nostalgia and Easy Listening pro-
gramming. The advent of AM stereo also 
generated some use of automation on the 
Standard Broadcast band, but since AM 
stereo all but fizzled, this specific applica-
tion of automation remained minuscule.
Although a substantial initial investment 
usually is necessary, the basic purpose of 
automation is to save a station money, 
and this it does by cutting staffing costs. 
Automation may also reduce the number 
of personnel problems. However, despite 
early predictions that automation eventu-
ally would replace the bulk of the radio 
workforce, very few jobs have actually 
been lost. In fact, new positions have been 
created.
Automated stations employ operators as 
well as announcers and production people 
(unless satellite-fed by syndicators). The 
extent to which a station uses automation 
often bears directly on staffing needs. Obvi-
ously, a fully automated station will employ 
FIGURE 10.28

cluster operation.

Channel.
Responding to the rule changes, many 
stations resorted to automation systems 
as a way to keep expenses down. Inter-
estingly enough, however, automation for 
programming, with its emphasis on music 
and deemphasis on chatter, actually helped 
FM secure a larger following, resulting in 
increased revenue and stature.
294	
Chapter 10 Engineering

fewer programming people than a partially 
automated outlet.
An automation system consists of a com-
puter that also produces logs, music sheets, 
invoices, affidavits, and so on. Automated 
operations typically consist of a fully loaded 
computer system containing all of a sta-
tion’s music and announcement inven-
tory. Indeed, the day of in-house loading 
of format elements is all but gone. Satellite 
syndicators using computers control local 
station ingredients (news, weather, promos, 
spots) remotely from the uplinks.
Today, thanks to the prevalence of 
computers, larger stations may employ a 
manager of information systems (MIS), 
who serves the computer tech needs of an 
outlet or entire cluster operation. This is 
another example of the so-called station in 
a box trend.
Posting Licenses and Permits
The FCC requires that a station’s license 
and the permits of its operators be posted. 
What follows are the rules pertaining to 
this requirement as outlined in Subpart H, 
§ 73.1230, of the FCC’s regulations.
§ 73.1230 Posting of Station and 
Operator Licenses
(a) The station license and any other instru-
ment of station authorization shall be 
posted in a conspicuous place and in such a 
manner that all terms are visible at the place 
the licensee considers to be the principal 
control point of the transmitter. At all other 
control or ATS monitoring and alarm points 
a photocopy of the station license and other 
authorizations shall be posted.
(b) The operator license of each station 
operator employed full-time or part-time or 
via contract shall be permanently posted and 
shall remain posted so long as the opera-
tor is employed by the licensee. Operators 
employed at two or more stations, which are 
not colocated, shall post their operator license 
or permit at one of the stations, and a photo-
copy of the license or permit at each other 
station. The operator license shall be posted 
where the operator is on duty, either:
(1) At the transmitter; or
(2) At the extension meter location; or
(3) At the remote control point, if the 
station is operated by remote control; or
(4) At the monitoring and alarm point, if 
the station is using an automatic transmis-
sion system.

Posting Licenses and Permits	
295

(c) Posting of the operator licenses and the 
station license and any other instruments of 
authorization shall be done by affixing the 
licenses to the wall at the posting location, 
or by enclosing them in a binder or folder 
which is retained at the posting location so 
that the documents will be readily available 
and easily accessible. (43 FR 45847, Oct. 
4, 1978, as amended at 49 FR 29069, July 
18, 1984)
C h a p t e r  H i g h l i g h t s
1.  Guglielmo Marconi first used electromag-
netic (radio) waves to send a message at the 
end of the nineteenth century. Marconi used 
earlier findings by James C. Maxwell and 
Heinrich Hertz.
2.  J.  Ambrose Fleming developed the diode 
tube (1904), and Reginald Fessenden trans-
mitted voice over the wireless (1906).
3.  Edwin Armstrong developed the regen-
erative and superheterodyne circuits, and 
first demonstrated the static-free FM broad-
cast signal (1933).
4.  Broadcast transmissions are carried on 
electromagnetic waves. The transmitter 
creates and shapes the wave to correspond 
to the “frequency” assigned by the FCC.
5.  Receivers pick up the transmissions, con-
verting the incoming radio frequency (RF) 
into sound waves.
6.  AM stations are assigned frequencies 
between 535 and 1705 kHz, with 10 kc 
separations between frequencies. AM is dis-
rupted by low-frequency emissions, can be 
blocked by irregular topography, and can 
travel hundreds (along surface level ground 
waves) or thousands (along nighttime sky 
waves) of miles.
7.  Because AM 
station 
signals 
travel 
greater distances at night, to avoid skywave 
­interference, over 2000 stations around the 
country must cease operation near sunset. 
­Thousands more must make ­substantial 
nighttime 
transmission 
adjustments 
(decrease power), and others (directional 
stations) must use two or more antennas to 
shape the pattern of their radiation.
8.  FM stations are assigned frequencies 
between 88.1 and 107.9 MHz, with 200 kc 
separations between frequencies. FM is static 
free, with direct waves (line-of-sight) carry-
ing up to 80–100 miles. Both AM and FM 
stations are licensed for 8 years as of this 
writing.
9.  To guarantee efficient use of the broad-
cast spectrum and to minimize station-to-
station interferences, the FCC established 
four classifications for AM stations and 
eight classifications for FM. Lower classifi-
cation stations are obligated to avoid inter-
ference with higher classification stations. 
Recent FCC actions have created more 
subclassifications.
10.  Satellite radio employs both geo-
synchronous (former XM) and elliptical 
(Sirius) orbits from over 22,000 miles in 
space. When necessary, ground repeaters are 
used to strengthen signals.
11.  Analog is being replaced by digital audio 
(DAB/HD) because digital audio provides 
superior frequency response and greater 
dynamic range. New spectrum space may 
be allocated to accommodate the digital 
service.
12.  A station’s chief engineer (chief opera-
tor) needs experience with basic broad-
cast electronics, as well as a knowledge of 
the FCC regulations affecting the station’s 
technical operation. The chief must repair 
and adjust equipment, and perform weekly 
inspections and calibrations. Other duties 
may include installing new equipment, 
training techs, planning maintenance sched-
ules, and handling a budget.

13.  A Proof of Performance involves check-
ing the station’s frequency response, har-
monic distortion, FM noise level, AM noise 
level, stereo separation, crosstalk, and sub-
carrier suppression.
14.  Although the FCC dispensed with the 
maintenance and operating log requirements 
(1983), a Station Log must be maintained. 
The log lists information about tower light 
malfunctions, EAS tests, and AM directional 
antenna systems.
15.  The EAS (formerly the EBS), imple-
mented after World War II, provides the 
government with a means of communicating 
with the public in an emergency. Stations 
must follow rigid instructions both during 
periodic tests of the system and during an 
actual emergency.
16.  Over one-quarter of today’s ­commercial 
stations are fully or partially automated. 
More prevalent in FM stations, automa-
tion reduces staffing costs but requires a 
­significant equipment investment. Auto-
mated programming elements are aired 
when a trip mechanism is activated by a 
cue tone, which is impressed on all program 
material. Either an operator or a compu-
ter can maintain the programming chain.

At many stations, satellite programming 
services use ­computers (at both uplink and 
downlink sites) to control station automa-
tion systems.

systems.
18.  Direct satellite-fed stations need little 
equipment because programming originates 
at the syndicator’s studios.

and the permits of its operators be accessi-
ble in the station area.

Fact Sheet: Hints on Filing Comments  
with the FCC
The FCC is interested in any experiences, 
knowledge, or insights that outside parties 
may have to shed light on issues and questions 
raised in the rule-making process. The public 
and industry have the opportunity to comment 
upon Petitions for Rule Makings, NOIs, NPRMs, 
Further NPRMs, Reports and Orders, and others’ 
comments on the aforementioned documents. It 
is a common misconception that only a lawyer 
can file comments with the FCC, but all that is 
necessary is an interest in an issue and the ability 
to read and follow directions.
Prior to drafting comments it is crucial to read 
and understand fully the item on which you wish 
to comment. Usually, the NPRM, NOI, or other 
item will specify and invite comment upon the 
issue(s) that the Commission is interested in 
studying further. Examination of the issue(s) and 
relevant documents is the most important part of 
the comment process. Comments may take any 
form, but the following hints may assist you in 
writing them.
Format. There is no required format for informal 
comments, although if you plan to file formally, 
it is required that they be typed, double-
spaced, and on 8.5  11 paper. Additional 
requirements for formal filings are set forth in 
Sections 1.49 and 1.419 of the FCC Rules. The 
Docket Number or Rule Making Number of 
the item at hand should be included on your 
comments and can be found on the front page 
of the Commission document or public notice. 
You should also include your name and complete 
mailing address.
Content. Your comments should state who you 
are and what your specific interest is. (You do not 
need to represent yourself in an official capacity. 
You may, for example, express your opinion as 
a concerned consumer, concerned parent, etc., 
and sign your name.) State your position and 
the facts directly, as thoroughly but as briefly as 
possible. Explain your position as it relates to 
your experience and be explicit. Make clear if the 
details of a proposed rule or only one of several 
provisions of the rule are objectionable. If the 
rule would be acceptable with certain safeguards, 
explain them and why they are necessary.
Support. Statements of agreement or dissent 
in comments should be supported to the best 
extent possible by factual (studies, statistics, etc.),

Consultant Donna Halper shares a 
similar view of the impact of consolidation 
on her profession, “It’s certainly affected 
radio consulting. With fewer independent 
stations that means radio conglomerates are 
relying more on voice-tracking and syndica-
tion. It used to be that consultants trained 
and developed talent in small and medium 
markets, but these days a company might 
simulcast the same programs on two or 
more of their stations or use voice-tracking 
from another city to give the impression 
that a live and local personality is on the 
air. They may also have an in-house person 
who oversees the stations. Yet, this saves 
the companies money on hiring talent 
(and also saves them from hiring a consul-
tant), but it also presents a problem. Many 
of these companies are not planning for 
the future. Rush Limbaugh and Howard 
Stern will not live forever, and without 
developing new talent, who will take their 
place? As we witnessed during the 9/11 
and ­Hurricane Katrina crises, people DO 
want live and local radio, yet in many 
markets, there are no local personalities 
at all. Sooner or later somebody will have 
to start developing talent again and creat-
ing radio stations that are unique. We are 
already raising a generation of young adults 
who don’t rely on radio the way their 
parents did. To get these people back (and 
I do believe it can be done) radio needs to 
return to its roots and get involved with 
the community again. As a consultant and 
someone who loves radio, I hope we will 
see more local personalities and more local 
programming. Radio needs to get back to 
being a friend again.”

Two things directly contributed to the rise 
of radio consultants: more stations – from 
2000 in the 1950s to 12,000 in 2000 – and 
more formats – from a half dozen to several 
dozen during the same period. Broadcast 
consultants have been around almost from 
the start, but it was not until the medium set 
a new course following the advent of televi-
sion that the field grew to real prominence. 
By the 1960s, consultants were directing 
the programming efforts of ­hundreds of 
stations. In the 1970s, over a third of the 
nation’s stations enlisted the services of 
consultants. Today, the field of radio con-
sultancy has shrunk substantially due to the 
corporatization of the radio industry. The 
ranks have dwindled to half of its former 
number. Says former top radio consultant 
Kent Burkhart, “Since consolidation many 
of the small consulting companies have shut 
their doors. Most of the large consulting 
companies with lots of assets (meaning an 
exclusive format, research partners, mar-
keting connections, etc.) have done well 
financially…but not as well as before. Prior 
to consolidation our company (Burkhart/
Abrams) was charging a certain fee for each 
station in a group. However, since consoli-
dation many groups have hired one chief 
programming executive for a lot less money 
than the aforementioned fee per station. 
I  thought consolidation would change the 
face, operations, and efficiency our consult-
ing company and others. It didn’t sound 
like fun to me, so prior to the consolida-
tion rollout I sold our consulting company 
in 1995.”
303 

consults Spanish radio, the market for his 
services is strong. “It’s been a fascinating 
experience working for stations in major 
markets, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, 
and San Francisco, where you have all the 
tools, like research and marketing budgets 
to compliment programming efforts. At the 
same time in the smaller markets that I 
consult, I have to rely more on creativity 
due to the limited budgets and tools. The 
dynamic of these two different situations 
keeps me on the cutting edge of doing new 
and exciting things to improve the perfor-
mance of my client radio stations. Consoli-
dation hasn’t impacted my business. Maybe 
in the future.”
Whether the radio consultancy function 
will be completely absorbed by corporations 
remains to be seen. However, consultants 
continue to play an important role in the 
shaping and management of the medium 
today. Observes prominent radio consul-
tant George Burns, “The principal role of 
radio consultants has evolved considerably 
since Mike Joseph started the whole thing 
in the 1950s. We began by being very spe-
cifically task oriented. A consultant was 
assumed to have greater expertise at the job 
Echoing Halper’s sentiments, consultant 
Doug Erickson says, “The biggest challenge 
for radio consultants today is the corporate 
resistance to new ideas. As radio has become 
a consolidated industry, it has become more 
conservative in many ways. General manag-
ers (GM) and program directors (PDs) feel 
more pressure to make the ‘right’ choice 
and this often leads to making the ‘safest’ 
choice – which is not always in the best 
interest of the station. As a consultant I 
try to make station management aware of 
the risks of doing nothing innovative. If ter-
restrial radio is to continue to be a part of 
the daily lives of most people, it must find 
a new way to remain personal and relevant, 
and it must do as much to touch the hearts 
of listeners as it does their ears.” Mean-
while, consultant Gary Berkowicz says that 
consolidation has not impacted his busi-
ness greatly but admits it has taken its toll 
on the field, “I still fly over 100,000 miles 
a year, so I’d say things are pretty good. 
In all seriousness, there is no doubt that it 
has changed. There are fewer consultants 
today, and somewhat fewer opportunities 
and stations to work for.” Also, from the 
perspective of Juan Carlos Hidalgo, who 
FIGURE 11.1

abundance of radio 
consulting services 
from which stations 
can choose. Courtesy 
Lund Consultants.

Chapter 11 Consultants and Syndicators

than anyone that the station could afford 
­fulltime. Currently consultants serve pri-
marily as outside (and, it is hoped, impar-
tial) monitors of station progress. The job 
is to assure management that everything 
possible is being done to maximize the sta-
tion’s potential. If ­something is not func-
tioning properly or needs to be changed, 
consultants are expected to give voice to 
these concerns. Over the years, the job has 
become infinitely more complex. Musical 
and nonmusical aspects of programming 
have spread widely apart. Research has 
become a separate discipline. And lately, the 
marketing side of radio has achieved a ‘life 
of its own.’ Different consultants approach 
each station’s progress from varying points 
of view. Specialization was inevitable.”
Stations use consultants for various 
reasons,  says Fred Jacobs, president of 
Jacob’s Media: “Stations realize that they 
need an experienced, objective ear to make 
intelligent evaluations. Consultants are also 
exposed to ideas and innovations from 
around the country that they can bring to 
their client stations. As radio has become 
more competitive, stations understand that 
their need for up-to-date information about 
current trends in programming and market-
ing has increased.”
Dave Scott, former president of Century 
21 Programming (now TM Century), Dallas, 
Texas, adds that a lack of research expertise 
on the local station level prompts many sta-
tions to use consultants. “We’re well into the 
information age, the age of highly sophis-
ticated research techniques and computer-
ized data. It takes a lot of resources to assess 
a market and prescribe a course of action. 
Most stations do not have the wherewithal. 
At the former Century 21 Programming, 
each of our consultants went through more 
ratings surveys and research data than most 
station owners, managers, or program direc-
tors did in a lifetime. The way the market-
place is today, using a consultant generally is 
a wise move. Radio stations that attempt to 
find their niche by trial and error make costly 
mistakes. A veteran consultant can accelerate 
a station’s move on the road to success.”
Donna Halper agrees with Scott and 
adds, “Consultants give their client sta-
tions an objective viewpoint and another 
experienced person’s input. Consultants 
are support people, resource people, who 
bring to a situation a broader vision rather 
FIGURE 11.1

than the purely local perspective. Consul-
tants, and not just out-of-work PDs who 
call themselves consultants but in reality 
aren’t, have a lot of research, information, 
and expertise they can make available to a 
client with an ailing station.”
Mikel Hunter of Mikel Hunter Broad-
cast Services, Las Vegas, says consultants’ 
help stations develop a distinctiveness that 
they need to succeed. “Unfortunately most 
station PDs are bandwagon riders. Many 
watch what other stations do around the 
country and clone them in their markets. 
Sometimes this works. Often it doesn’t. It 
likely was a consultant who helped design 
the programming of that successful station 
being copied, and the consultant did so 
based on what was germane to that particu-
lar market, not one a thousand miles away. 
Therein lies the problem. Simply because 
a station in Denver is doing great book by 
programming a certain way does not guaran-
tee that a station in Maryland can duplicate 
that success. A good consultant brings origi-
nality and creativity to each new situation, 
in addition to the knowledge and experi-
ence he possesses. The follow-the-leader 
method so prevalent among programmers 
actually creates a lot of the problems that 
consultants are called on to remedy.”
Fewer than 100 broadcast consultants 
are listed in the various media directories 
around the country. More than half of this 
number specializes in radio. Says Ed Shane, 
“I remember a time when there were 250 
programming consultants listed in the 
R&R directory. The number has tumbled 
since consolidation. One-man shops that 
couldn’t make it as clients were swallowed 
by competing companies. Some consulting 
firms merged (Holland Cooke and McVay 
Media, for example). Others folded to go 
in-house at major companies (Jack Taddeo 
to Capstar, for instance).”
In general, consultancy companies average 
around 20–30 employees but may be com-
posed of as few as two or three and in some 
cases are a one-person operation. Many 
successful program directors also provide 
consultancy to stations in other markets 
in addition to their regular programming 
duties. A  growing number of station rep 
companies provide their client stations 
consultancy services for an additional fee. 
Again, in the age of station consolidation 
and massive radio groups, consultancy often 
originates in-house.
Consultant Services
Successful consultant Valerie Geller believes 
that station concentration actually creates a 
need for her services and expertise. “Pro-
grammers and managers tend to be stretched 
very thin these days because of consolida-
tion; thus experienced consultants are more 
needed than ever.” Stations hire program 
consultants to improve or strengthen their 
standings in the ratings surveys. An outside 
consultant may share general program 
decisions with the station’s PD or may be 
endowed with full control over all deci-
sions affecting the station’s sound, con-
tends Halper. “I have as little or as much 
involvement as the client desires. Depend-
ing on the case, I can hire and train staff (or 
fire staff), design or fine-tune a format, or 
simply motivate and direct deejays, which 
is actually anything but simple. Whatever a 
station wants, as a professional consultant 
I can provide. Usually, I make recommen-
dations and then the owner or GM decides 
whether or not I will carry them out. At 
some of my stations, I’ve functioned as the 
acting PD, for all intents and purposes. At 
other client stations, I’ve been sort of the 
unofficial mother figure, providing support, 
encouragement, and sometimes a much-
needed kick in the behind.”
Among other services, Fred Jacobs says 
his company offers “in-market visits for 
monitoring and strategizing; ongoing moni-
tors of client competition from airchecks 
or station ‘listen lines’; critiques of on-air 
talent, assistance/design of music scheduling 
and selection; computer programs that assist 
with promo scheduling, database market-
ing, and morning show preparation; design 
of off-air advertising and coordination with 
production; and design/implementation of 
market research for programming, image, 
and music.”
Most consultant firms are equipped to 
provide either comprehensive or limited 
support to stations. “In some cases, consul-
tants offer a packaged ‘system for success’ 
306	
Chapter 11 Consultants and Syndicators

in the same way a McDonald’s hamburger 
franchise delivers a ‘system for success’ to an 
investor. The consultant gets control. In other 
instances, consultants deliver objective advice 
or research input to a station more on a one-
to-one basis. This parallels the role of most 
accountants or attorneys in that the decisions 
are still made by the station management, 
not the consultant,” notes Dave Scott.
In the mid-1990s, niche consultants came 
into vogue. For example, a consulting service 
called Air Support focuses on improving the 
ratings of station morning shows by working 
on “talent development, preparation, creativ-
ity, and performance,” reports Radio Ink.
Program consultants diagnose the prob-
lems that impair a station’s growth and 
then prescribe a plan of action designed to 
remedy the ills. For example, station WXXX, 
located in a 20-station market, is one of 
three that programs current hits, yet it lags 
behind both of its competitors in the ratings. 
A consultant is hired to assess the situa-
tion and suggest a solution. The consultant’s 
preliminary report cites several weaknesses 
in WXXX’s overall programming. The con-
sultant’s critique submitted to the station’s 
general manager may be written like this:
Dear GM:
Following a month-long analysis of WXXX’s 
on-air product, here are some initial impres-
sions. A more extensive report on each of the 
areas cited herein will follow our scheduled 
conference next week.
1.  Personnel: Morning man Jay Allen lacks 
the energy and appeal necessary to attract and 
sustain an audience in this daypart. Although 
Allen possesses a smoothness and warmth that 
would work well in other time slots, namely 
midday or evenings, he does not have the 
“wake-up and roll” sound, nor the type of 
humor listeners have come to expect at this 
time of day. The other “hot hit” stations in the 
market offer bright and lively morning teams. 
Allen does not stand up against the compe-
tition. His contrasting style is ill-suited for 
AM drive, whereas midday man Mike Curtis 
would be more at home during this period. His 
upbeat, witty, and casual style when teamed 
with news people Chuck Tuttle and Mark 
Fournier would strengthen the morning slot.
Tracy Jessick and Michelle Jones perform 
well in their respective time periods. ­Overnight 
man Johnny Christensen is very ­adequate – 
potential as midday man should Curtis be 
moved into morning slot. Weekend personnel 
uneven. Better balance needed. Carol Mirando, 
2:00–7:00 p.m. Sunday, is the strongest of the 
part-timers. Serious pacing problems with 
Larry Coty in 7:00 p.m. to midnight slot on 
Saturday. Can’t read copy.
2.  Music: Rotation problems in all dayparts. 
Playlist narrowing and updating necessary. Better 
definition needed. As stands, station verges on 
Adult Contemporary at certain times of the 
day, especially during a.m. drive. On Monday 
the fourteenth, during evening daypart, station 
abandoned currents and assumed Oldies sound. 
More stability and consistency within format 
essential. Computerized music scheduling pos-
sible solution. Separate report to follow.
3.  News programming: General revamp-
ing necessary. Too heavy an emphasis during 
FIGURE 11.2

difference at many

Consultants.

4.  General programming: Too much clutter! 
A log-jam in drive dayparts. Spots clustered 
four deep in spot sets, sometimes at quarter 
hour. So much for maintenance. Rescheduling 
needed for flow purposes as well. “Consumer 
Call” at 8:00 a.m., noon, and 5:00 p.m. not 
suitable for demos. “Band News” good, but too 
long. One-minute capsule versions scheduled 
through day would be more effective. Friday 
evening “Oldies Party” too geriatric – breaks 
format objective. Sends target demos off to 
competition by appealing to older listeners 
with songs dating back to 1960s. Public affairs 
programs scheduled between 9:00 a.m. and 
noon on Sundays delivers teens to competi-
tion that airs music during same time period. 
Jingles and promos dated. Smacks of decade 
ago. New package would add contemporary 
luster needed to sell format to target demo.
5.   Promotions: “Bermuda Triangle” contest 
aimed at older demos. Contest prizes geared 
for 25–39-year-old listener. Ages station. 
Concert tie-in good. Album giveaway could 
be embellished with other prizes. Too thin as 
is. Response would indicate lack of motiva-
tion. True also of “Cash Call.” Larger sums 
need to be awarded. Curtis’s “Rock Trivia” 
on target. Hits demos on the money. Expand 
into other dayparts. Bumper stickers and 
“X-100” calendar do not project appropri-
ate image. New billboards and bus-boards 
also need adjusting. Paper ads focus on weak 
logo. Waiting to view TV promo. Competition 
promos are very weak. A good “X-100” TV 
promo would create advantage in this area. 
Opportunity.
6.  Technical: Signal strong. Reaches areas 
that competition does not. Significant null in 
Centerville area. Competition’s signals unaf-
fected. Occasional disparity in levels. Spots 
sometimes very hot. Promos and public service 
announcements (PSAs), especially UNICEF 
and American Cancer Society, slightly muddy. 
In general, fidelity acceptable on music. Extra-
neous noise, possibly caused by scratches or 
dirt, on some power rotation cuts. Stereo sepa-
ration good. Recommend compressor and new 
limiter. Further plant evaluation in progress. 
A more detailed report to follow.
Following an extensive assessment of a 
station’s programming, a consultant may 
suggest a major change. “After an in-depth 
evaluation and analysis, we may conclude 
that a station is improperly positioned in 
its particular market and recommend a 
format switch. Sometimes station manage-
ment disagrees. Changing formats can be 
pretty traumatic, so there often is resis-
tance to the idea. A critique more often 
both drive periods. Cut back by 20–30% in 
these two dayparts. Fifteen-minute “Noon 
News” needs to be eliminated. Tune-out factor 
in targeted demos. Same holds true for half-
hour, 5:00–5:30 p.m., “News Roundup.” Hourly 
5-minute casts reduced to minute headlines 
after 7:00 p.m. Both content and style of news-
casts presently inappropriate for demos sought. 
Air presentations need adjusting to better, more 
compatibly suit format. Tuttle and Fournier of 
morning show are strong, whereas p.m. drive 
news would benefit from a comparable team. 
Ovitt, Hart, and Lexis do not complement 
each other. Van Sanders is effective in evening 
slot. More sounders and actualities in hourly 
newscasts. Greater local slant needed, espe-
cially on sports events.

recommends that adjustments be made in 
an existing format than a changeover to 
a different one. There are times when a 
consultant is simply called upon to assist 
in the hiring of a new jock or newsperson. 
Major surgery is not always necessary or 
desired,” says Halper.
Today, the majority of stations in major 
and medium markets switching formats 
do so with the aid of a consultant (or an 
­in-house programming executive in cluster 
situations). According to the National Asso-
ciation of Broadcasters (NAB), 3–5% of the 
nation’s stations change formats each year. 
Consultant fees range from $500 to more 
than $1200 a day, depending on the com-
plexity of the services rendered and the size 
of the station.
Consultant Qualifications
Most consultants begin as broadcasters. 
Some successfully programmed stations 
before embarking on their own or joining 
consultancy firms. According to fabled pro-
grammer Rick Sklar, deceased president of 
Sklar Communications, consultants who 
have a ­background in the medium have 
a ­considerable edge over those who do 
not. “The best way to fully understand and 
appreciate radio is to work in it. As you 
might imagine, radio experience is very 
helpful in this business.” Jacobs agrees 
with Sklar. “Ideally a consultant should 
have a successful background in program-
ming, with expertise in a number of areas, 
including research, sales, marketing, and 
promotion. The key word is success – a 
solid track record in a number of different 
market situations is invaluable. Consul-
tants also need to have strong communi-
cation and ­tracking skills to best work with 
a variety of clients in markets around the 
country.” Not all consultants have exten-
sive backgrounds in the medium. Most 
do possess a thorough knowledge of how 
radio operates on all its different levels, 
from having worked closely with stations 
and having acquired formal training in 
FIGURE 11.4

Station Consulting
The principal reason stations hire 
consultants is the experience, knowl-
edge, and wisdom that are not neces-
sarily available to them on a local 
basis or in a market that is smaller. 
Today’s program directors can be 
responsible for multiple stations, pull 
airshifts, and also do the job of a few 
other people. I can focus in on one 
station, develop a strategy, and make 
sure that strategy is being followed. In 
terms of the effect of consolidation on 
the field of radio consultancy, if one 
of the large companies likes you, it’s 
good. If not, it can be tough to get new 
clients. Many of the larger companies 
don’t use outside consultants, so that 
has also added some interesting twists. 
There are still many broadcasters who 
need the savvy of solid consultants. As 
far as the effects of all the new audio 
technologies on the consultancy profes-
sion, it has not been as significant as 
one might think. Radio stations are 
still judged by the ratings and ratings 
are still determined by having the best 
sounding and best-marketed product. 
Terrestrial radio still fights for every ad 
dollar available, so the ratings are now 
more important than ever.

not use consultants argue that local flavor 
is lost when an outsider comes into a 
market to direct a station’s programming. 
Donna Halper contends that this may be 
true to some degree but believes that most 
­professional consultants are sensitive to a 
station’s local identity. “Some consultants 
do clone their stations. Others of us do not. 
In fact, I’d say most do not. For those of us 
who recognize local differences, there need 
not be any loss whatsoever as a consequence 
of consultant-­recommended changes. But 
the hits are pretty much the hits, and good 
radio is something that Tulsa deserves as 
well as Rochester. So I do try to localize 
my music research and acquire a good feel 
for the market I’m working in. But as far 
as basic rules of good radio are concerned, 
those don’t vary much no matter what the 
market is. It’s important for a station to 
reflect the market it serves, and I support 
my clients in that. Because I work out of 
Boston doesn’t mean that my AOR client in 
Duluth should sound like a Boston album 
rocker. It should sound like a solid AOR 
station that could be respected in any city 
but fits the needs of Duluth.”
Consultant Dwight Douglas says that 
localization is essential for any radio station 
and that consultants are amply aware of 
this fact. “It is an industry axiom that a 
station must be a part of its environment. 
An excellent station will be uniquely local 
in relating to its audience. That tends to take 
the form of news, weather, sports, public 
service, general information, and jock talk. 
A good consultant will free a station from 
music worries and allow it to concentrate 
on developing local identity. We work hard 
at customizing formats to suit the geode-
mographics or lifestyles of the audiences of 
our client stations.”
A station has an obligation to retain 
its sense of locality regardless of what a 
consultant may suggest, contends Mikel 
Hunter. “No station should simply turn 
itself over body and soul to a consultant. 
Local flavor does not have to be sacrificed 
if a station has a strong PD and a general 
manager who doesn’t insist that the PD 
merely follow the consultant’s suggestions. 
A station should not let itself become a 
local franchise. Consultants are a valu-
able resource, but both the station and 
colleges offering research methodology, 
audience measurement, and broadcast 
management courses. “A solid education 
is particularly important for those plan-
ning to become broadcast consultants. It 
is a very complex and demanding field 
today, and it is becoming more so with 
each passing day. My advice is to load up. 
Get the training and experience up front. 
It is very competitive out there. You make 
your own opportunities in this profession,” 
says Dave Scott.
Both Halper and Scott rate people skills 
and objectivity highly. “Consulting requires 
an ability to deal with people. Decisions – 
for example, changing formats – ­sometimes 
result in drastic personnel changes. A con-
sultant must be adept at diplomacy but 
must act with conviction when the diag-
nosis has been made. Major surgery invari-
ably is traumatic, but the idea is to make 
the patient, the station, healthy again. You 
can’t let your own personal biases or tastes 
get in the way of what will work in a given 
market,” observes Halper. Dave Scott shares 
Halper’s sentiments. “A consultant, like a 
doctor, must be compassionate and at the 
same time maintain his objectivity. It is our 
intention and goal as a program consultant 
service to make our client stations thrive. 
As consultants, we’re successful because we 
do what we have to do. It’s not a ques-
tion of being mercenary. It’s a question of 
doing what you have to do to make a station 
prosper and realize its potential.”
Consultant company executives also 
consider wit, patience, curiosity, ­sincerity, 
eagerness, competitiveness, and drive – not 
necessarily in that order – among the other 
virtues that the aspiring consultant should 
possess. Adds Gary Berkowitz, “All of 
those things are important. Indeed experi-
ence, integrity, and honesty top the list, as 
does the ability to tell clients what you 
really think versus what they might want 
to hear.”
Consultants: Pros and Cons
There are as many opponents of program 
consultants within the radio industry as 
there are advocates. Broadcasters who do

the ­consultant must pool their wisdom to 
make the plan work.”
Jacobs strikes a similar note of caution 
regarding the importance of local connec-
tion. “With a consultant, a station can con-
ceivably lose some of its localness if there 
isn’t adequate effort to give it a ­hometown 
flavor. But the loss of local presence is far 
more likely with satellite-delivered formats. 
Consultants need to work closely with 
station management (and vice versa) to 
find local ties and signposts, because listen-
ers care most about what’s happening in 
their town. It’s always important to under-
stand that there are regional differences in 
taste, personalities, and music. Many high-
powered on-air personalities would be 
hard-pressed to duplicate their success in 
another market.”
The cost factor is another reason why 
some stations do not use consultants. 
“Consultants can be expensive, although 
most consultants scale their fees to suit 
the occasion, that is, the size of the market. 
A few hundred dollars a day can be exor-
bitant for many smaller stations. But the 
cost of the research, analysis, and strat-
egy usually is worth the money. I believe 
that a station, in most cases, gets every-
thing it pays for when it uses a consul-
tant. It’s worth investing a few thousand 
to make back a million,” contends Dwight 
Douglas.
Dave Scott believes that certain stations 
can become too dependent on consultants. 
“A consultant is there to provide support 
and direction when needed. If a station 
is  infirm, it needs attention, perhaps 
extensive care. However, when a station 
regains its health, an annual or semi-
annual checkup is usually sufficient. A 
checkup generally can prevent problems 
from recurring.”
Mikel Hunter agrees with Scott, adding, 
“A radio doctor needs the cooperation of his 
client. On the other hand, a station must 
insist that a consultant do more than diag-
nose or critique. Positive input, that is, a 
remedying prescription, is what a consul-
tant should provide. Conversely, a station 
should be willing to use the aid that the 
consultant provides.”
Statistically, those stations that use pro-
gramming consultants more often than not 
experience improved ratings. In case, after 
case consultants have taken their client sta-
tions from bottom to top in many of the 
country’s largest markets. Of course, not 
all succeed quite so dramatically. However, 
a move from eleventh place to sixth in a 
metro market is considered a noteworthy 
achievement and has a very invigorating 
effect on station revenue. “The vast major-
ity of ­consultants benefit their clients by 
increasing their position in the book. This 
means better profits,” notes Halper, who has 
improved the ratings of 90% of her client 
stations.

oriented and less concerned with ground 
level activities.”
Program Suppliers
The widespread use of automation equip-
ment commencing in the 1960s sparked 
significant growth in the field of program-
ming syndication. Initially, the installation 
of automation systems motivated station 
management to seek out syndicator ser-
vices. Today, the highly successful and 
sophisticated program formats offered by 
myriad syndicators often inspires stations 
to invest in automation equipment. Of 
course, many of the large radio corpora-
tions create programming for distribution 
to their own stations, and this has had an 
effect on the number of program suppliers 
still in operation. Observes Jay Williams, 
“The syndication business has changed 
because of consolidation, which reduced 
the opportunities for selling programs by 
syndication companies on the one hand 
and on the other made the larger compa-
nies aware that they should be syndicating 
programs on their own. I think some of the 
most innovative syndication is being done 
now by News Corp, which has taken their 
TV personalities, most recently ‘Brian and 
the Judge,’ who have individually made 
a name for themselves on the Fox News 
Channel, and developed new radio pro-
grams for them (even though they don’t 
actually appear together on television). 
Formats like Adult Contemporary (where 
product is becoming more generic and less 
innovative) are declining in numbers across 
the country, whereas the numbers of News/
Talk and Sports stations are increasing, so 
there are opportunities for syndicating talk 
programming. Short form programming 
syndication appears to have very limited 
appeal. On the other hand, long form 
program syndication, which can garner 
ratings over time, appears to be increasing. 
Finally, advertisers believe ads work better 
in talk programming since they blend with 
the format and the spot clusters don’t have 
to be as long.”
It is estimated that over half of 
the ­country’s radio outlets purchase 
About the future of radio consultancy, 
George Burns says, “I see the role of con-
sultants undergoing considerable change 
in the next few years. The rules of owner-
ship and the very principles under which 
our industry is organized are altering radi-
cally. ­Consultants will probably take even 
more of an advisory role and have less 
involvement in the day-to-day operations 
of a station. The new and larger broad-
casting companies, in all size markets, will 
keep expertise in-house and rely less on 
outside input in these areas. I see consul-
tants operating at ‘higher levels’ in the 
future. They will be working on organi-
zation, ­continuing education, motiva-
tion, compensation, human resources, and 
other ‘top management’ concerns. Consul-
tants, I believe, will become more policy

products are not only penetrating new 
markets but larger markets as well, where 
until now, traditional thinking has held that 
locally originated programming was the only 
way to go.”
The demand for syndicator product has 
paralleled, if not exceeded, the increase in 
the number of radio outlets since the l960s. 
Again, the new millennium has brought a 
change in the field of program syndication 
with the large radio corporations often 
assuming the chore of program generation 
in-house.
Every part of the broadcast day is served 
by syndicators, and morning drive in par-
ticular, observes Ed Shane. “Syndicated 
morning shows are widespread and prolif-
erating. There are almost too many to keep 
track of. At a quick glance, you’ve got Bob 
and Sheri, John Boy and Billy, Bob and Tom, 
Mark and Brian, Steve and DC, Big D and 
Bubba, Mancow, Opie & Anthony, and on 
and on.”
Syndicator Services
The major program syndicators usually 
market several distinctive, fully packaged 
radio formats. “In its heyday, Peters Pro-
ductions made available a complete format 
service with each of their format blends. 
They were not merely a music service. Their 
programming goal was the emotional grati-
fication of the type of person attracted to 
a particular format,” says Dick Ellis, whose 
former company offered a dozen differ-
ent formats, including Beautiful Music, 
Easy Listening, Standard Country, Modern 
­syndicated ­programming of some type, 
which may consist of as little as a series 
of one- or ­two-minute features or as much 
as a 24-hour, year-round station format. 
Longtime program specialist Dick Ellis 
cites economics as the primary reason 
why stations resort to syndicators. “When 
I programmed for Peters Productions 
they supplied high-quality programming 
and engineering at a relatively low cost. 
For instance, for a few hundred dollars 
a month  a small market operator gets 
a successful program director, a highly 
skilled mastering engineer, all the music 
he’ll ever need (no  service problems 
with record companies) recorded on the 
highest quality tapes available. It takes a 
programmer eight hours to program one 
twenty-four-hour cut reel. It takes a mas-
tering engineer eight hours to remove all 
the pops and clicks found on even brand 
new records, plus place the automation 
tones. All of this frees the local operator 
to concentrate his efforts on promotion 
and, of course, sales.”
William Stockman, who led Schulke 
Radio Productions (SRP was purchased by 
Bonneville Broadcasting System in the mid-
1980s), says that stations are attracted to 
syndicators because of the highly profes-
sional, major market sound they are able to 
provide. “By using SRP’s unique program-
ming service, a smaller station with limited 
resources can sound as polished and sophis-
ticated as any metro station.”
Both economics and service motivate 
radio stations to contract syndicators, con-
tends former Satellite Music Network 
(now part of ABC Radio) programmer 
Lee Abrams (now heading the program-
ming effort of XM Satellite). “Stations are 
attracted to our affordable, high-quality 
programming. It’s just that simple. Syndies 
provided an excellent product within a 
cost-effective context. Their expertise in 
delivering niche concepts was very appeal-
ing to radio operators.”
The late and great Rick Sklar observed, 
“In today’s cost-conscious economic climate, 
more and more radio station operators are 
turning to suppliers of twenty-four-hour 
formats for their programming. Whether 
delivered via satellite, conventional tape, 
CD or DAT, these increasingly ­sophisticated

Dave Scott. Observes Ed Shane, “The key 
to using syndicator or network program-
ming is to make it sound like it belongs 
to the station. Even big personality shows 
like Rush and Dr. Laura can make use of 
local avails and bumpers for personalized 
call letters and promos.”
Audience and market research and anal-
ysis are conducted by syndicators before 
implementing a particular format. “Our 
clients receive comprehensive consulting 
services from our seasoned staff. We begin 
with a detailed study of our client station’s 
market. We probe demographics, psycho-
graphics, and population growth trends of 
a station’s available audience. We analyze a 
client’s competition quantitatively through 
available ratings and qualitatively from 
airchecks. Then the programming our 
service provides is professionally positioned 
to maximize our client’s sales, ratings, and 
profits. All of our programming is solidly 
backed by systematic studies of the listening 
tastes of each format’s target audience. Our 
research includes call-out and focus group 
studies, in-depth market analysis, attitudinal 
audience feedback, psychographic patterns 
and tests, and several in-house computers 
with ratings data online,” says Dave Scott.
Format programming packages include 
hundreds of hours of music, as well as 
breaks, promos, and IDs, by seasoned metro 
market announcers. Customized identity 
elements, such as jingles and other special 
formatic features (taped time checks), are 
made available by the majority of syndica-
tors. “We try to cover all bases to ensure 
the success of our clients. We back each 
of our formats a dozen different ways. For 
example, image builders in the form of 
promotions, contests, and graphics also are 
an element of our programming service 
at Radio Arts,” says programmer Larry 
Vanderveen.
To stay in step with the ever-changing 
marketplace, syndicators routinely update 
the programming they provide their sub-
scribers. “When you want people to listen 
to a station a lot, you’ve got to keep them 
interested in it. To do so you have to air 
a sound that’s always fresh and current. 
Tape updates are plentiful. We give sta-
tions the most extensive initial collection 
Country, Adult Contemporary, Standard 
MOR, Super Hits, Easy Contemporary, and 
a country and contemporary hybrid called 
Natural Sound.
Century 21 Programming also was a leader 
in format diversity, explains Dave Scott. 
“Our inventory included everything from 
the most contemporary super hits sound to 
several Christian formats. We even offered a 
full-time Jazz format. We had programming 
to fit any need in any market.”
Drake-Chenault Enterprises (now owned 
by Jones Satellite Networks) was among 
the oldest and largest of syndicators and 
specialized in Beautiful Music. Today, Clas-
sical Music Network, TM Century, Jones 
Satellite Network, Westwood One, United 
Station Radio Network, and NBG Radio 
Networks also are among the most success-
ful of those syndicators marketing several 
program formats. Some syndicators prefer 
to specialize in one or two programming 
areas. For example, Bonneville Broadcast-
ing and Churchill Productions primar-
ily specialize in the adult Easy Listening 
format.
Syndicator formats are fully tested before 
they are marketed, explains Stockman. “At 
Schulke our strategy was to reorient the 
music from essentially a producer-oriented 
to a consumer-oriented product. Music 
was tested on a cut-by-cut basis in several 
markets coast-to-coast. Using patented and 
proven methodology, music was carefully 
added or selectively deleted. By determin-
ing what songs the listeners like to hear 
and which songs they dislike, SRP assem-
bled a totally researched library that has 
been on the air via our subscriber stations 
since March 1983. Every song played on 
our stations has been rated by the listeners 
as a ‘winner’ and all the ‘stiffs’ that have 
a high dislike factor have been eliminated 
altogether.”
Customized sound hours are designed 
for each format to ensure consistency 
and compatibility on the local station 
level. “An exact clock is tailored for our 
client station after our market study. The 
format we provide will perfectly match 
the station in tempo, style, music mix, 
announcing, promos, news, weather, and 
commercial load,” says program syndicator

a fee containing spots. Leasing agreements 
generally stipulate a minimum 2-year term 
and assure the subscriber that the syndica-
tor will not lease a similar format to another 
station in the same market. Should a station 
choose not to renew its agreement with the 
syndicator, all material must be returned 
unless otherwise stipulated.
The majority of format syndicators also 
market production libraries, jingles, and special 
features for general market consumption.
What is the difference between a network 
and a syndicator? Ed Shane explains, 
“Networks and syndicators are essentially 
or almost the same. Premiere calls Rush 
­Limbaugh a ‘network’ and Dr. Laura a 
‘syndicated show.’ United Stations Radio 
Network works the same way. (It has more 
to do with the way spots are sold than the 
realities of programming.) Westwood One 
is more of a network, combining CBS News, 
CNN Radio, long form music programs, 
Metro Traffic and News with syndicated 
programming like country music specials. 
ESPN is networked for all talk shows and 
live sports (NFL football play-by-play, for 
example) by ABC.”
of music tapes available. Then we follow 
them up with hundreds more throughout 
the year. For instance, our CHR, AOR, 
and Country subscribers receive over 100 
updates annually. All categories have fre-
quent updates, so our client’s sound stays 
fresh and vital,” says Dave Scott, who adds 
that the lines of communication are kept 
open between the client and syndicator 
long after the agreement has been signed. 
“Since the success of our clients is very 
important to us, continuing consultation 
and assistance via a toll-free hotline is 
always available twenty-four hours a day. 
Automation-experienced 
broadcasters 
are in our production studios around the 
clock, and consultants can be reached at 
work or home any time. Help is as close 
as the phone.”
Syndicators assist stations during the 
installation and implementation stage of a 
format and provide training for operators 
and other station personnel. Comprehen-
sive operations manuals are left with sub-
scribers as a source of further assistance.
Syndicators offer programs on a barter 
basis, for a fee without presold spots or for

Billy Bush.
Billy Bush
Interviewed by Jay Williams Syndication
Jay Williams – Billy, although you’re 
best known as a TV star, you began 
your career in radio. What attracted 
you to radio?
Billy Bush – The intimacy of radio.  
I got to talk with people in a one-
on-one conversation and that was 
extremely cool and it still is.
JW – What kinds of jobs did you 
have in radio, and which were the 
most rewarding for you?
BB – I had the luxury of starting in 
a small market where I had every job. 
I was a sales guy during the day, and 
boy is that a humbling experience, and 
I was on the air one night a week, and 
on the weekends I did promotions. I 
pumped up the station balloon and I 
handed out hundreds of fliers. There 
is not a job in radio I have not done 
outside of management, and I never 
want to do that.
JW – With “Access Hollywood” and 
your syndicated “Billy Bush Show,” 
you shift from one medium to the other 
every day. Is that difficult? Also, what 
are the major differences as a per-
former between the two mediums?
BB – In radio, the greatest prepa-
ration is just knowledge. It’s just 
knowing what you’re talking about. 
It’s about drawing on life experi-
ences. In TV, you have a lot of people 
helping you. You’ve got a lot of 
people preparing and editing and all 
that. In radio, you need to be your 
own research department. So radio’s 
a lot more difficult.
JW – Tell us about radio. What 
makes radio unique in your view?
BB – The car, because the car is a 
unique environment, and radio will 
always be the easiest and best choice 
for people. People who are texting and 
using the Internet in their car are very 
few and far between. The automobile 
is ideal for radio and that single inven-
tion years ago is what makes radio 
unique, and it’s what will insure that 
radio will be there forever.
JW – As we are talking, radio is 
going through technological changes, 
316	
Chapter 11 Consultants and Syndicators

facing new competition and economic 
distress. Yet, your well-received syn-
dicated show is rapidly expanding 
across the country. How do you see 
radio’s future?
BB – Radio’s future is secure because 
of the car. I said that. But my syn-
dicated show is a great answer for 
people who are facing economic prob-
lems because it’s cost effective. I don’t 
cost them ­anything. They just have to 
give me some inventory. They give me 
4 minutes an hour, and that’s it. So it’s 
an opportunity cost and not an actual 
outlay of cash.
JW – Syndication seems to be 
growing, too. From the old network 
programs such as Paul Harvey news to 
later off-network radio syndication, such 
as Howard Stern, Bob and Tom, Rush 
Limbaugh, more stations seem to be 
embracing syndication. Do you see that 
as a growing trend and why?
BB – Yes, because syndication makes 
sense. If you have great talent and 
content, then you’re just giving up time. 
If the ratings are big, then you’ll be 
able to charge more for the commer-
cials that you do get revenue for. So 
it’s all about choosing the right talent, 
the biggest will survive and I believe 
we are in that direction.
JW – Your show is marketed by West-
wood One, one of the largest syndica-
tion companies. Tell us about your role 
verses theirs, how much are you person-
ally involved, and how much control do 
you have over your own show?
BB – I have entire control over edi-
torial, what I put out there is what 
goes on the air. In that regard it’s 
great. I’m very personally involved 
and I control all the content. As for 
the sales and marketing of the show, 
I weigh in whenever I want to, but we 
agree between Westwood and me. 
If I feel strongly about anything, I’m 
confident my voice is heard and I’ll 
usually prevail because at the end of 
the day the talent has to be happy to 
provide. However, having done every 
job in radio, I have total respect for the 
people who do things outside of what 
I do, and I’m totally open to whatever 
they have to say.
JW – It must be demanding prepar-
ing and voicing a new show every 
day. Who and what does it take to 
produce your show?
BB – I have a broadcast producer, 
Michelle Salvatore, who takes in all my 
content and who arranges and orga­
nizes our schedule and lays out what 
the show is going to be each day. I 
have five bookers who book guests 
for me on the radio show. I book a 
lot myself because my BlackBerry has 
gotten pretty deep over the years. We 
have three editors on the other side of 
things who package the show at the end 
of the day. We are spread out perfectly.
JW – You are heavily involved with 
getting new station clients. Tell us a bit 
about how that process works.
BB – Everything is sales in life, and 
each client, each station I’m on needs 
to feel that if they need to get in touch 
with me they can. The truth is, they 
can. Anyone can call and set up a time 
to talk on the phone through Michelle 
or anybody else or my assistant, Marla, 
and I will talk to any station clients. 
There are walls because it makes it 
easier for everyone, but if someone 
needs to weigh in with me, they can.
JW – “The Billy Bush Show” com-
petes with locally produced shows in 
many markets. How do you react to 
objections from potential clients that 
your show “won’t work in this market 
because it isn’t local”?
BB – Entertainment is everywhere. 
There is an insatiability for celebrity 
content. What I do is provide an every-
man’s perspective to it. I tell people 
about what it’s like behind the scenes. 
I make it personably relatable for them 
because they hear someone they trust 
and listen to and connect with deal 
with celebrities in these situations and 
they love it. Also I’m honest; I tell it like 
it is. If someone is difficult, I share that.
JW – How do you position your 
show against other syndicated shows? 
What makes “The Billy Bush Show” 
unique or better?
BB – My main competition, I think, is 
probably Ryan Seacrest, although there 
are others. I’m not positive how Ryan 
does his show, but I do believe there’s 
a lot of people taking his existing 
content and putting it out there. What 
I do is a totally new and original show 
for my stations every single day. A lot 
of syndicated shows are packaged. 
They do three, four, or five shows at a 
time. I do a new show every day with 
new analysis, new insights, and new 
guests.
JW – Do you think more radio sta-
tions will embrace syndicated shows 
because it gives them access to better 
on-air talent than they can find locally 
or because, in some cases, syndicated 
shows may save them money?
BB – The answer is a little bit of 
both, absolutely. The best on-air talent 
will survive and grow, and those par-
ticular people will continue to survive. 
The better known you are, the better 
chance you have out of the gate. 
Although that doesn’t mean local 
people can’t rise to that level. And yes, 
my show saves a lot of money for sta-
tions because they’re not paying me. 
They’re giving me commercial time and 
if my ratings are good, they’re going 
to get more money for the commercial 
time that they do have left.
JW – Does syndication help or hurt 
radio?
BB – I think syndication helps radio 
because you want to have big names 
in your field. You want to be as rel-
evant and taken as seriously as every-
one else. The bigger stars you have on 
radio, I think, the higher the profile of 
radio but the trap is – and I hope radio 
stations don’t fall into it – to go for the 
biggest name you can get just because 
of the name. At the end of the day, 
they have to deliver, they have to work, 
they have to have that strong ethic. 
And the biggest radio names are really 
hardworking people.
JW – You’re a big TV star, you travel 
the world to do pageants, events, even 
the Olympics, and you certainly don’t 
need extra work. So why did you 
launch “The Billy Bush Show” and get 
back into radio?
BB – Because I love radio, and 
because radio gives me the opportu-
nity to expand upon my thoughts. It 
gives me a chance to walk a tightrope 
without a net. I love being able to 
express my opinions. I know Holly-
wood and understand it very well and 
I have an insider’s perspective, and 
I love being able to share that with 
people.

concluded that over three-quarters of the 
nation’s stations receive some form of sat-
ellite programming. The majority of sta-
tions with satellite dishes use them to draw 
network feeds. However, the percentage of 
stations receiving product from syndicators 
and other programming services has more 
than doubled during the past couple of 
decades, and the use of station hardware 
(other than computers) for syndicator pro-
gramming is nearly extinct. It is more cost 
effective and efficient to catch the digital 
satellite signals than it is to handle actual 
product on the local station level. In fact, 
the majority of program syndicators have 
ceased to mail material to stations, opting 
to beam it to them instead.
Satellite-fed syndicator programs are 
often archived for later replay. Drew 
Carey of Clear Channel Communications 
discusses the procedure for doing so for 
one of his company’s shows: “The Bob & 
Tom Show is designed to air in its entirety 
for the full four hours as sent with no 
editing. Stations in the Central, Mountain, 
and Pacific time zones run the show either 
at 5 to 9 a.m. or 6 to 10 p.m. depending 
upon their competitive situation. Stations 
use one of three methods to delay broadcast 
of the show: 1. Station automation systems 
(record to system, such as Audio Vault, 
then replay automatically), 2. Record to 
DAT then replay (requires the station be 
staffed overnight and during playback), and 
Hardware Requirements and

Everything is computer-based now, and the

enormously since 1980. An NAB survey

adequate hardware, too. We utilize a number 
of highly regarded audio experts to make 
the sound and the client’s are the very best 
possible. In fact, we use special audiophile 
‘super disks,’ master tapes from record com-
panies, noise reduction, click editing, and 
precise level control or slight equalization, 
if needed,” says Scott.
Periodic airchecks of subscriber stations 
are analyzed from a technical perspective to 
detect any deficiencies in sound quality.

Concerning audio quality, syndicators are 
very particular about sound quality and make 
every effort to ensure that their program-

formats created a market for consultants. 
Today, the ranks of radio consultants has 
been reduced due to consolidation and 
major radio companies typically have their 
own in-house consultant in the form of an 
experienced programming executive.
2.  Consultants provide various services, includ-
ing market research, programming and format 
design, hiring and training of staff, staff moti-
vation, advertising and public relations cam-
paigns, news and public affairs restructuring, 
and technical evaluation (periodic airchecks 
of sound quality).

ground experience in the medium, solid 
educational preparation, and strong inter-
personal skills.

sultants fear losing the station’s local flavor, 
becoming a clone of other stations, and the 
substantial cost.

consultants more often than not experience

APPENDIX 11A: Station Critique
To: GM/BRadio
Fr: Donna L. Halper, Halper & Associates
Re: Critique of tapes of B
Thanks for sending along the latest batch 
of tapes for me to critique. I do hear some 
improvements since I last visited the station. On 
the other hand, I am still hearing some areas that 
we need to work on. Most of what I noticed are 
problems with formatics, although a few little 
things stood out. In no particular order,
1.  Bet is back to being too close to the mic, 
causing her to pop her Ps again. The good news 
is that on this tape, her voice is now VERY 
­midrange – and not high-end or “cutesy,” and she 
sounds more natural. The bad news is that she 
seems determined to use verbal clichés (however, 
she is not the only one with this habit). For 
example, when she reads the liner about “playing 
the music that made FM great,” she repeatedly 
says “and here’s another great example” when 
she introduces the next song. She is also trying 
too hard to make simple format elements sound 
enthusiastic: the school lunch menu basically just 
needs to be read, rather than embellished upon 
for two minutes. I know she is trying, but it just 
sounds artificial to get that excited about school 
lunches. The entire staff seems stuck on the 
phrases keep it locked and music from . . . (“that 
was music from the Beatles; now here’s music 
from Steely Dan”). In real life, do we really talk 
that way, or do we talk about great SONGS, or 
use phrases like “a classic from. . . . ” We need to 
VARY what we say, or else we sound like robots. 
Thus, if I just said “Now, here’s a classic from 
Bob Dylan,” I don’t want to use that phrase for 
every front-sell. Ditto for “keep it locked” – it’s a 
rather overused AOR phrase as it is, but boy, do 
our jocks say it a lot . . . can’t we find some other 
ways to invite people to listen?
2.  Virtually everyone seems to have acute 
lineritis. It’s a disease where you want to read 
a lot of liners all at once. I heard “the all-new 
FIGURE 11.14

B-, the station that plays the classic hits and 
the music that made FM great!!!” ONE LINER 
PER BREAK IS JUST FINE, THANKS. If we 
just used “the all-new B-” or “your station for 
Classic Hits,” we don’t need to add in two more 
liners. A good front-sell might be as simple 
as “on the home of classic hits, B-, here’s Cat 
Stevens.” Or “playing the music that made FM 
great, we’re B-, with Fleetwood Mac.” Simple is 
better, in other words.
3.  How much weather do we need in 
middays? During morning drive, the announcer 
should give time, temp, and say good morning 
to the audience each break; that isn’t neces-
sary the rest of the day. Unless there are major 
storms coming, I wouldn’t have so many 
weather forecasts during the workday – folks 
already got there, the kids are in school, etc. 
But we should still be friendly: I seldom heard 
Dave say his name (I assume it was Dave?), 
and I like a liner that thanks people for listen-
ing or invites them to tell a friend about the 
All-New B-.
4.  Although I agree that call letters are 
crucial, I heard them used way too much at 
some times: It is not conversational to say “on 
the all- new B-, here’s Bob Seger on the all-new 
B-.” That just sounds repetitious. My training 
has been to use call letters going into a song and 
use them when coming out of a long music set 
(“That was Traffic on the All-New B-, and we 
also heard Joan Baez and Dan Fogelberg.”) But 
to use them two or three times within the same 
front-sell strikes me as too much of a good thing. 
Also, I’m hearing B- a lot more than I’m hearing 
Classic Hits. And a final grammatical note – you 
CAN’T say “the classic hits of all time” – you can 
play the greatest hits, but classic hits are a format 
description and a positioning statement. I’d 
suggest “playing ALL the classic hits” or “playing 
nothing but classic hits” or “playing the classic 
hits of the past and the classic hits of today” – 
you get the idea.
5.  More clichés – why is Wednesday 
called hump day? Again, do we really talk that 
way? And in several of the forecasts I heard 
various people do, I heard about scattered 
rain – I knew that showers could be scattered, 
but rain? I remind everyone to keep being 
­CONVERSATIONAL – how would you talk 
to a FRIEND? Would you really say “It’s 52 
minutes past the hour of 6 o’clock”? I also like 
consistency – some jocks, as mentioned earlier, 
said their name often, some said it repeatedly, 
some seldom said it at all. Some used one liner 
over and over, some used a variety. These ele-
ments must be formatted in so that all the 
liners are rotated evenly. Also, I’m not sure if 
it was the skimmer, but I heard some problems 
with levels when a song ended. The jock’s voice 
sounded much louder or much softer than the 
song at certain times. A request – could you tape 
an hour of each jock and NOT scope it down 
– in other words, just put a tape in a boom-box 
and let it run, so that I can hear an uninter-
rupted hour, commercials and all? I’d like to 
hear what the audience heard.
More critique later – I’ll go over the music 
in more detail in my next memo. What I heard 
sounded basically hit-oriented, which is good, but 
let’s stress CLASSIC HITS too, because we are 
getting to a point where the variety of the music 
is right on target! I’ll be in touch.
P.S. I meant to mention that the PSA or Street-
Sheet outro may be too long, although it may 
also be the jock ad-libbing. The ending of a PSA 
should be brief and to the point. What I heard

was over a MINUTE of numbers and advice – “If 
your church, social club, or nonprofit organization 
has a message you want to be publicized, just 
send the who-what-when-where-how-and-why, 
etc.” – boy, that’s wordy!!! It’s better to be simple, 
without tons of addresses and phone numbers. 
You are wiser to advise those with something 
to send to call B- for our fax number, rather 
than taking up so much time telling them they 
can phone it or fax it or mail it, then giving the 
address on top of everything. This slows the 
station down too much. It also goes without 
saying that the way something is sent to us on a 
press release may not sound good read verbatim 
on the air. What I heard B- reading sounded as 
if we had just put the press release right into 
the studio with no rewrite. Local news and local 
PSAs should be rewritten for clarity, and it helps 
that they be conversational. (I would also like to 
hear our local news, by the way, plus how Chris 
sounds.) Perhaps the announcers were nervous 
because they were doing an aircheck, but they do 
need to become accustomed to taping themselves 
regularly so that they can eliminate the verbal 
crutches they use and make their show sound 
smoother.

APPENDIX 11B: Network Radio/Syndication
FIGURE 11.18
This interview with 
Ron Hartenbaum 
was conducted 
by Jay Williams, 
Jr. Courtesy same.
Interview with: Ron Hartenbaum, CEO, Jones Radio Networks (New York) 
Difference between network and syndication? “You can’t separate them, there is no difference. 
It’s a fallacy to think there is; the same thing is happening” with network and syndication. In 
the old model, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) used to separate networks as 
they distributed programming regularly using dedicated telephone lines (and that distribution 
method was how a network was described). That was done throughout the 30s, 40s, and 50s. 
“That’s an ancient way of distribution, with bad ﬁdelity, and no longer applies. Now network-
syndication programming is distributed in a variety of ways . . . CD, the Internet, wired and 
wireless, satellite . . . it’s based on which method is the most ‘cost effective’ for them.” 
“There is no difference between syndication and network – it’s all national programming. 
A Matchbox 20 Concert or a Tony Bennett special for the Thanksgiving Weekend might be 
distributed by CD, as there is not an urgent time constraint. Breaking news, though, wouldn’t 
go out on CD. You would use the distribution method that is best and most cost efﬁ cient for 
the product you’re sending out. If it’s live, immediate, and interactive (with phone calls) such 
as Rush Limbaugh, it’s delivered via satellite; if it’s not time sensitive, it may be mailed out 
on CD. But it’s all national radio.” 
“It’s all audio. It’s how do we deliver a signal to as many ears as we can. How do we deliver 
an audience to an advertiser.” And the trend is to deliver increasingly speciﬁ c audiences that 
can appeal to speciﬁc types of advertisers. “National radio and network radio are the same.” 
Even the old radio networks have changed, although they retain part of their names. CBS/
Viacom Radio is now handled by Westwood One, itself a division of Viacom. The GE/NBC 
Network is also distributed by Viacom. ABC/Disney is still the ABC Radio Network. 
Current Example. Jones Radio works with the CNN Radio Network “en Espanol.” CNN creates 
the news, but Jones Radio Network handles all the advertising and all the afﬁ liate sales. 
Programming is delivered on the Internet. And using the special client feature, in a special 
password protected part of the Web site – called Ala Carta – stations can pick the items and 
information that best suits their speciﬁc mix of Hispanics in their individual communities. 
For example, New York might want programming for Puerto Rican and Cuban Hispanics that 
would not be needed in Los Angeles where most of the population consists of Mexican and 
Central American Hispanics. This distribution ﬂexibility and choice are both the present and 
future of syndication. 
National radio revenues are over $1 billion annually. There are only four major companies: 
Westwood One (the largest with almost half that revenue), ABC, Premier, and Jones; there 
once were over a dozen. 
“But how do you look at Sirius and XM? These are national radio stations just using a different 
model.” In other words, people looking to buy national radio would include these two 
satellite radio systems in their plans. 
Ron also believes that “streaming media” could have been part of national radio but was 
killed by the “greed of music publishing and actor’s union’s rights fees. Internet radio was 
economically squashed before it could get started – everybody ended up losing.” 
The future: There probably won’t be much more consolidation and there could even be more 
producers and distributors of content in the future. 
324

FIGURE 11.18
Continued
The distribution model is always changing. Ron used the example of mail . . . moving from 
horseback to rail, truck, airplanes, and the Internet. But it’s still mail. 
He suggests that a triangle is the best way to show the business model. At the top is product/
program/content. At the lower left corner is the audience/circulation/distribution. At the lower 
right side is generation of ad sales revenue. If you make a good product (program) then 
“people will want it,” they’ll want to listen to it or watch it. If they watch, you can generate  
ad sales revenue (and then, “if you’re smart, you’ll put some of that revenue back into the 
product”). Jones is in all three parts of this model – programming, distribution and sales. Ron 
adds: “You learn in business school that if you’re standing still, you’re losing. You have to 
constantly evolve your product and your product lines” and that means you have to invest in 
them.
Ron also believes that there are only three ways that programming/content is being 
distributed: Pay/subscription, Ad supported, or a blend of the two. “Someone has to make 
money. There are costs to generate news and to develop music programming.” 
[He has this analogy for college students who think music is free and should remain that 
way – “What if you went to college, went to all the classes, took all the tests, wrote all the 
papers, and handed in the work and didn’t get a grade? “Where’s my grade?” you’d say; 
we’d say that we’ve downloaded all your information on the Internet and we don’t need to 
give you a grade.”] 
[We also discussed news programming and Ron gave some thoughts you may want to use in 
a separate section. There is increasing pressure on these big companies to eliminate money-
losing divisions. Either you amortize your costs over a variety of channels and outlets (as 
NBC) or you look to mergers to be able to reduce those costs (ABC’s talks with CNN). Rupert 
Murdoch was one of the ﬁrst to work with a “global platform” and “by having papers and 
networks all over the world, he doesn’t have to open a foreign bureau, he’s already there. 
A Fox News anchor can get information from a New York  Post reporter in New York or a 
co-owned newspaper in Sydney in seconds. You must either get more customers for your 
programming or reduce your costs.”]

This interview with 
Tom Griswold 
was conducted 
by Jay Williams, 
Jr. Courtesy same.
Interview with Tom Griswold, of the Bob & Tom Show, Indianapolis “Quotations” are from Tom
Griswold  
Show is delivered to 125 stations nationwide via satellite. 
 
It’s distributed by Premier Radio Network (owned by Clear Channel).
 
Interesting note . . . Premier used to have separate salespeople for certain shows and they 
are now moving to a model where all the sales people will sell all the shows. 
 
Shows are fed live from 6:00 to 10:00 A.M. Eastern time . . . with three 6 minute breaks 
per hour for local programming (commercials, news updates, etc). Some stations, mostly in 
the Mountain States or on the West Coast, will tape delay the broadcast to ﬁt their morning 
time slots.
Bob and Tom try to entertain . . . and don’t focus on their local area at all. “If you listen
to the show, you wouldn’t know where we were here” (Indianapolis). Tom doesn’t think
syndicated shows like Bob and Tom will replace local shows but believes “there will be a mix 
of local and syndicated shows. There is still a big demand for a lot of local content.” 
“We tip-toed into it (syndication) starting out with three afﬁliates. But the show took off 
quickly. One magazine had voted us as one of the ‘most stolen-from radio shows in America,’
and it was great to be able to get our show out there.” 
Preparing for a show. “There’s at least one aspect that’s easier. If you make a comment about 
a local institution, it could cost your station billings from some advertiser who gets upset. But 
when you’re getting material from all over the nation, rarely do you get negative feedback.
And there’s a lot more ammo to choose from nationally – you don’t have to rely on what 
happened at the local school board.”
Live is very important. “I could listen to tapes or CD’s, but I listen to radio just to keep in 
touch.” 
XM and Sirius – “both of them will make it” . . . maybe not with the same stockholders, but 
they will be able to produce great shows and have great talent. These national satellite radio
networks “are delivering variety with low commercial loads; local radio stations have lots of 
commercials and all sound the same. XM even went after Howard Stern – they know the 
next step is to get great talent on the air.” John considers satellite radio, national radio, or 
syndicated radio, just in a slightly different form.

Interview with John H. Garabedian
Radio and TV entrepreneur, former president of Superadio Networks, and current host of
“Open House Party.” John also started V66 in Boston, probably the ﬁrst music video television
station.
“Quotation marks” are from John Garabedian
Much of the live programming is done using C-Band satellite distribution (vs. the less reliable
KU satellite systems). The costs of satellite distribution keeps coming down and a satellite 
uplink only costs about $150,000, so programming can come from almost anywhere. 
Hundreds of successful programs are distributed nationally . . . including Delilah, Paul Harvey 
news, Rush Limbaugh, and Howard Stern. It’s over a $1 billion business.
John says there’s not much difference between network radio and syndication but suggests the
difference is that Network programs are rated by RADAR, a national service (now owned by
Arbitron) that produces ratings for radio network programming. He says that other than that,
there is really no difference. 
He says that Superadio, now owned by Access One Communications (also owners of American
Urban Radio Network and individual radio stations), sends out over 5000 CDs a week!
John believes that “live and local shows” are overrated in radio.
“Everyone in radio thinks you have to have a local morning show to win. That radio is local.
That’s wrong. Don’t waste your time with the ‘Bob and Debbie’ show. The people who
control radio in the future will be the people who have the talent . . . ” “Howard Stern died
for our (syndicators’) sins. He said, ‘Don’t put on local shows – just put on the Howard Stern
Show and you’ll be #1,’ and he was right.” 
The goal of the big radio groups is “to control all their own programming. There will be
more centrally programmed live shows.” If they don’t do it nationally, they’ll probably start
doing it regionally. “They can take the best talent from all of their classic rock stations and
make one really great radio station” that people will really want to listen to and save a
fortune in costs in the process. “And local PD’s won’t screw up making bad music decisions.” 
All programming, he believes, will become more national.

Afterword
Jay Williams, Jr.
The Future of Radio
The cliché, “The future’s just not what it 
used to be,” applied to radio, is also 
true. The radio industry is experienc-
ing wrenching structural upheaval, sea 
changes in operating philosophies, 
painful personnel layoffs, plunging 
revenues and business valuations, and 
uncertainty about its future. But this 
85-year-old medium has been counted 
out before, and it came back stronger 
than ever.
Two Breathtaking 
Inventions
Radio, Marconi’s invention that magi-
cally reproduced sound from thin air, 
was an instant success. From the early 
1920s, families gathered around the 
large consoles to hear drama, news, 
orchestras, and FDR’s “Fireside Chats.” 
Late into the night, kids listened to sta-
tions from far-away cities, mesmerized 
by the mysterious glowing tubes that 
created the staticky sound. Television 
arrived to a war-weary country in the 
1950s, and TV’s explosive impact 
cannot be overstated! TV was radio 
with pictures. Universally loved radio 
stars like Jack Benny jumped to this 
new medium, and experts predicted 
radio’s demise. But radio adapted and 
innovated, dropping network dramas 
for live news, personalities, and music. 
Programming innovations, coinciding 
with the rise of rock ‘n’ roll music and 
the invention of inexpensive, portable 
battery-powered transistor radios, gave 
radio a new life and future.
Technology Changed 
Consumer Expectations
In the early 70s, another invention 
upended the very concept of broad-
casting. Before the VCR, families had 
to watch the “Carol Burnett Show” 
at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, or miss it 
entirely. The VCR changed how media 
was used by transforming “real time” 
into “my time.” The VCR marked the 
beginning of a new era of consumer 
control of media. Another 20 years 
later, computer and digital technology 
spawned a tsunami of innovations that 
have changed the media landscape 
completely.
Digital technology has transformed 
the way we live and work, propelled by 
systems and devices only dreamed of a 
few years ago. Once meaningless letter 
and alphanumeric combinations such as 
MP3, DVD, iPod, PDA, Ti-Vo, SMS, and 
GPS are now digital necessities. The 
fierce battle to supply consumers with 
entertainment, information, and commu-
nication options is having its impact on 
all media, including radio. One battle 
for the keys into the consumers’ homes 
is evidenced by competing ads for 
cable, satellite TV, and “bundled” fiber 
optics telephone services. But the critical 
battle is for control of enhanced digital 
handheld devices that have become 
more versatile and powerful even as 
they shrink. Portability, the once unique 
edge radio owned, is making hand-
helds indispensable for consumers.
Technology itself has become its 
own force driving listening and media 
decisions. Technology precipitated the 
growth of the Internet, huge numbers 
of distribution channels, wireless com-
munications, and social networking 
that, along with increasingly flexible 
and glamorous devices, lure consumers 
328

with boundless content choices, and 
­on-demand capabilities.
Technology, Regulation, 
and New Competition
Digital technology, coupled with the 
Telecom Act of 1996 that legalized 
publicly traded radio companies 
and the consolidation of the industry, 
revolutionized radio operations. Unat-
tended operations, digital workstations, 
ISDN lines, and centralized billing and 
traffic systems streamlined radio opera-
tions. Voice-tracking hour-long music 
programs in minutes enhanced person-
nel productivity and flexibility. Group 
operators utilized digital technology to 
reduce costs by putting their best on-air 
people and syndicated products on 
multiple stations. But while technology 
delivered new efficiencies, it also gave 
rise to new competition and challenges.
Until the 1990s, “radio” described 
the AM and FM stations licensed to 
a limited number of frequencies in a 
given city or market because of the lim-
itations of the radio spectrum. Technol-
ogy demolished those limitations. The 
term “radio” now encompasses new 
distribution channels that encompass 
thousands of Internet stations, Sirius-XM 
and other satellite radio services, web-
based “personalization technology-
powered” stations such as Pandora, 
low-power FM stations (soon to become 
more prolific), and HD (high defini-
tion) channels. Not only are all these 
“stations” vying for their share of the 
listeners and ultimately revenues, they 
compete for consumers’ time and minds 
with an immense number of global 
providers shoving content through an 
endless stream of devices: TV, comput-
ers, iPods, BlackBerrys, Xbox, Kindle, 
and many more.
The Impact on Radio
Traditional or “old media” is under 
siege. Newspapers, some published 
for 200 years, are in rapid economic 
decline, battered by free, up-to-the 
second online versions and an eco-
nomic crisis that demolished advertis-
ing budgets. Yellow pages, television, 
magazines, and radio have all felt the 
impact; even “new media” including 
satellite and Internet radio are suffer-
ing. This new choice-filled environment 
arrives at an inopportune time for 
terrestrial radio. Too much talk, too 
many commercials, lack of compelling 
content, flagging community involve-
ment, homogenized music, absence 
of exciting head-to-head competition, 
and staff reductions have contributed 
to radio’s vulnerability. Radio has been 
too content to simply “broadcast,” 
spending few resources on listener 
feedback or relationships. Revenue and 
valuation declines, accelerated by a 
weakened economy, forced many debt-
stressed operators to slash overhead 
well beyond “streamlining.” Hundreds 
of personalities, news and sportscast-
ers, salespeople, and managers nation-
wide have been axed from payrolls. 
Although locally programmed stations 
operated by dedicated broadcasters 
still exist, those numbers are declin-
ing. The golden age of local radio has 
passed.
Radio Reacts
Terrestrial radio broadcasters view the 
future with trepidation, but they are 
making changes to meet it. High defi-
nition, HD radio, rapidly launched in 
2006, uses digital technology to create 
new “side channels” from existing ter-
restrial signals. Although listeners must 
buy a new HD radio to receive these 
new stations, listeners can receive them 
free. Promising more unique program-
ming, broadcasters see HD radio as a 
new way forward.
Many broadcasters are pressing 
for the expansion of more precise 
electronic audience measurement 
technologies such as the PPM, the 
Personal People Meter, to replace the 
diary system of listening “estimates” to 
establish more credibility with adver-
tisers and agencies determined to 
get better value for their advertising 
dollars. Other broadcasters are striving 
to develop new sources of revenue by 
updating and monetizing station web-
sites, developing promotional and event 
marketing tie-ins, and targeting new 
sources of advertising such as govern-
ment programs and recruitment.
In this choice-filled environment, it is 
not surprising that people have become 
more “atomized” than ever before. 
Traditional social institutions such as the 
church, town meetings, fraternal and 
service organizations are disappearing; 
humans, who require social interaction 
for enjoyment and health, are progres-
sively drawn toward “causes” and 
social networking to supply the “com-
munities” that they need. This presents 
an opportunity for radio to nurture 
social involvement on a local level.
Radio Requires 
Renewal and 
­Reinvestment
Radio’s core strengths remain; expand-
ing on them is the best course to ensure 
terrestrial radio’s future. Radio has well-
known personalities, personalities so 
influential that President Obama chided 
political opponents by saying, “You 
can’t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and 
get things done.” Like Limbaugh or not, 
the president’s comment is testimony 
to radio’s power and influence. From 
Don McNeill, to Larry Lujack, Howard 
Stern, and Mark Levin, personalities 
have made radio compelling through 
generations. These familiar voices 
serve as companions and friends, com-
manding enduring loyalties unlike any 
other media. That’s because listening 
to radio, even in a carpool, is a per-
sonal, one-on-one experience. Radio is 
the perfect multitasking medium that is 
often used surfing the web, studying, 
or in the workplace. Radio has the 
best opportunity to be local, be inte-
grated in the community and provide 
a social network. With the decline of 
newspapers, magazines, yellow pages, 
and other media, radio also has a 
renewed opportunity to capture new 
local advertising revenue. Radio serves 
as an editor. In this world of expanding 
choice and complexity, radio serves as 
a personal filter, eliminating the neces-
sity of wading through limitless material 
by selecting the most interesting, enter-
taining, and popular sources of music 
and information. Unlike an iPod, radio

continuously refreshes and edits content 
for the listener, adding the benefit of 
“surprise.” Radio is free, easy to use, 
portable, and universally accessible. 
Almost 95% of all Americans listen to 
radio once a week, amazingly loyal 
to radio’s relatability, reliability, per-
sonalities, and content. The industry 
must now press to ensure that radio is 
included in as many handheld devices 
as possible.
Focus on the Future
Radio’s future requires reinvestment. 
This will mean finding, training, and 
promoting on-air talent to rebuild 
radio’s product and appeal. Radio 
must reframe itself for the advertiser 
and abandon its antiquated “mass 
appeal” approach. Radio should focus 
on its exceptional efficiency as a tar-
geted, personal medium that reaches 
age 251 working consumers in a local 
market. Gone are the days of compet-
ing with TV or newspapers on a mass 
scale; that’s no longer relevant. The 
radio industry knows too little about its 
own customers; fixing this will require 
a commitment to identify, target, and 
develop a relationship with radio’s 
core listeners to enable it to be more 
responsive, useable, and relatable. 
Radio must quickly look outside itself 
to expand its reach and brand by 
integrating into far reaching social net-
working communities. Radio’s leaders 
must oppose the so-called Fairness 
Doctrine, issue-strangling legislation 
that failed in the 60s. Under the prin-
ciple that every station must broadcast 
“opposing views,” virtually impossible 
to administer in a political environment 
with multiple positions, this proposal 
ignores the existence of the “unregu-
lated” media marketplace that includes 
satellite, Internet, cable TV, and other 
distribution channels. If the “Fairness 
Doctrine” is revived, the loser will be 
local terrestrial radio that, financially 
unable to hire enough lawyers or pay 
government fines, will forfeit politically 
oriented personalities to other outlets. 
Given the decline of newspapers 
with their free press guarantees, any 
government regulation of broadcast 
content will cast a chilling pall on Free 
Speech. Importantly, it will take rein-
vigorated confidence and belief in the 
medium by a breed of radio leaders 
who see possibilities, not obstacles. 
With a new infusion of leadership, 
radio, even in its most traditional form, 
will still be there to inform, stimulate, 
and entertain in more ways than ever 
before.
A Personal Note
If you’re a student, inquisitive, obser­
vant, and willing to work, you can be 
an important part of radio’s future. 
Radio, as with all media, needs 
intelligent young people at all levels 
who can communicate clearly and 
knowledgeably. Editing and filtering 
information to listeners are impor-
tant, thoughtful processes requiring a 
familiarity with history to give events 
proper context and the ability to write 
interestingly and concisely. Understand-
ing business and observing consumer 
trends is important for sales and sales 
managers who are ultimately success-
ful by helping their advertising clients 
become successful. A desire to become 
involved in shaping and serving the 
needs of a community and its organi-
zations, charities, and infrastructure 
is essential to radio’s mission and 
continued importance. An understand-
ing of technology, what it can do, and 
an ability to imagine what it might 
do in the future will also serve you 
well. ­Sherlock Holmes once said to 
Dr. Watson, “You see, but you do not 
observe. There is a distinction.” Suc-
cessful radio reflects its community; this 
cannot be done by those who do not 
observe what they see around them.
