Preface
When I met S¨onke Adlung, of Oxford University Press, during the annual meet-
ing of the European Materials Research Society in Strasbourg in June 1996,
he was taking care of the exhibition booth in his editorial role, while I was
co-organizing a symposium dedicated to visible-light emitters.
Nitrides were booming world-wide at that time. During the preceding three
years, many researchers, including myself, had reoriented their research activities
to nitrides after several Japanese researchers, including Prof Isamu Akasaki and
Drs Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura, had made signiﬁcant breakthroughs
in various scientiﬁc areas such as materials science and device physics. These
breakthroughs had led to the realization and commercialization of blue light-
emitting diodes based on nitride semiconductors. More recently, in January 2006,
a blue laser was demonstrated in Japan. Most of the attendees at the visible-light
symposium had come to Strasbourg to hear, in a very crowded conference room,
the talk by Shuji Nakamura, planned for Friday the 7th, so that they could see
with their own eyes the coherent blue light-ray of a nitride-based laser exciting
the ﬂuorescence of a paper screen.
During the afternoon of that Friday, S¨onke, with whom I was chatting in front
of the OUP booth, suggested that I edit a book dedicated to nitrides. Group III
Nitride Semiconductor Compounds: Physics and Applications was edited one
and-a-half years later in 1998, and it was followed by Low-Dimensional Nitride
Semiconductors in 2002. Today you are holding III-Nitride Semiconductors and
their Modern Devices.
Ten years have passed since the second volume of this series was published.
We believed a few months ago, in light of recent new developments in the ﬁeld,
that it was time to oﬀer a modernized compilation of today’s research activities.
We kept the initial format: a book accessible to the larger community, including
PhD students at the beginning of their studies and not yet familiar with the
world of semiconductor physics. Light emission/detection is a newly developing
area. Therefore, I asked Professor Amano of Nagoya University, one of the fathers
of nitrides, to write a general introductory chapter to provide an overview of the
needs and realizations in that area. His chapter combines a review of economic
issues and societal needs, together with growth aspects, physics characterization,
and device realizations. All other chapters were written by leading researchers in
speciﬁc ﬁelds. Dr Izabella Grzegory has been growing bulk gallium nitride since
the beginning of her career. I had in my hands some very tiny pieces of her trans-
parent gallium nitride bulk crystal as early as January 1986! I found it natural to

vi
PREFACE
ask her to take care of the chapter dedicated to the homoepitaxial challenge, and
she wrote it in collaboration with her colleagues at Warsaw: Michal Bockowski,
Piotr Perlin, Czeslaw Skierbiszewski, Tadeusz Suski, Marcin Sarzynski, Stanislaw
Krukowski, and Sylwester Porowski. They share it with us here, and they indic-
ate how far they have advanced since their early studies in Poland at the end
of the 1970s. Nitrides being often deposited by using modern epitaxial growth
techniques (see for instance, the ﬁrst book of this series), to review the status
of the research at the nitride–silicon interface is of value. I asked Professor Alois
Krost and Dr Armin Dadgar, of the Otto-von-Guericke-University at Magdeburg,
to address this message at the dawn 2013. This constitutes the third chapter,
which precedes the chapter dedicated to the growth of bulk aluminium nitride
(a very promising substrate for the years to come), written by Zlatko Sitar and
Ronny Kirste of the North Carolina State University at Raleigh. Since the begin-
ning of the 1980s, semiconductor quantum dots have been known to be, beyond
the scope of promising concepts, eﬃcient adimensional localization centers for
electrons and holes, oﬀering the possibility of realizing low-threshold lasing. We
now know that quantum dots are useful for realizing single-photon sources and
entangled-photon pair-emitters. Andre Strittmatter, of the Technical University
of Berlin, agreed to write the ﬁfth chapter, dedicated to the growth of such light-
emitters. Band-gap engineering issues are particularly important regarding the
growth of heterostructures on lattice mismatched substrates. Chapters 6 and 7
were written by researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique F´ed´erale de Lausanne
and Mie University, respectively. Aluminum indium nitride was initially pro-
posed by Professor Marc Ilegems (now retired) and Dr Jean Fran¸cois Carlin.
I thus naturally asked the colleagues that are currently holding Marc’s stick
to accept the burden of reviewing the status and importance of the AlInN
alloy at the composition lattice-matched to GaN. Drs Rapha¨el Butt´e, Gatien
Cosendey, Lorenzo Lugani, Marlene Glauser, Antonino Castiglia, Guillaume
Perillat-Merceroz, Jean-Fran¸cois Carlin, and Professor Nicolas Grandjean did
this very nicely. Aluminum-rich AlGaN alloys are also very important for target-
ing deep-ultraviolet applications. These alloys are treated by an internationally
recognized expert in the area of crystal growth of chalcopyrites and nitrides:
Professor Hideto Miyake, of Mie University. There are tremendous develop-
ments these days regarding the properties of light-emitters grown on non-polar
or semipolar orientations. Writing such a chapter, while retaining clarity and a
reasonable length, required considerable eﬀort by Professor Michael Kneissl and
Dr Tim Wernicke of the Technical University and Ferdinand-Braun-Institute
at Berlin. The result is impressive. In Chapter 9, Drs Rudeesun Songmuang
and Eva Monroy address the single-nanowire devices, which was quite challen-
ging from the beginning. Dr Jean-Yves Duboz, of the Centre of Research on
Hetero-Epitaxy and its Applications, in Valbonne, agreed to write on advanced
photonic and nanophotonic devices, the topic of Chapter 10. Dr Yvon Cordier,
of the Centre of Research on Hetero-Epitaxy and Applications, Valbonne, and
Drs Tatsuya Fujishima, Bin Lu, Elison Matioli, and Professor Tom´as Palacios,

of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, next address nitride-
based electron devices, widely investigated for the next generation of high-power
and high-frequency applications.
The potentialities of having large conduction-band oﬀsets in nitride het-
erostructures enables targeting of intersubband transitions in low-dimensional
nitrides, which are in particular investigated at the Institute of Fundamental
Electronics by Drs Maria Tchernycheva and Fran¸cois Julien. They both accepted
my invitation to write the chapter dedicated to applications of nitride hetero-
structures in the mid-infrared. The large oscillator strength of nitrides paves the
way to fascinating optical properties, among which is the slow-light propagation
phenomenon. Drs Tatiana Shubina and Mikhail Glazov, of the IOFFE Institute in
St Petersburg, together with Dr Nikolay Gippius of the General Physics Institute
of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow, placed aside the Cyrillic alpha-
bet in order to write the thirteenth chapter, and I share the responsibility with
them. Then follow three chapters dedicated to very prospective issues. Nitride
devices and their biofunctionalization for biosensing applications are treated in a
fourteenth chapter by my oﬃce neighbor Professor Csilla Gergely at Montpellier,
and Walter R. L. Lambrecht and Atchara Punya, of the Department of Physics
at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, address, in a very didactical
way, the physics of heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds and perspectives
for a new class of materials that are, mutatis mutandis, the analogs of the chal-
copyrites. Finally, it has been proposed recently by Professor Alexey Kavokin
to produce a radiative relaxation process between a forbidden excitonic trans-
ition populated by non-linear two-photon spectroscopy and an allowed one. Two
photons are successively emitted—the ﬁrst by cascading at an energy in the tera-
hertz frequency region, and the second occurring at the host material band-gap
energy. This process arm-twists the black-body radiation law, and may lead
to a new class of THz emitters. I have asked Drs Oleksandr Kyriienko and
Ivan Shelykh, of the University of Iceland, in Reykjavik, and the Division of
Physics and Applied Physics, Anyang Technological University of Singapore, and
Professor Alexey Kavokin, of the University of Southampton, to provide readers
with suﬃcient elements for them to eventually handle this kind of research. The
cover picture represents a photonic billiard designed by Didier Felbacq, realized
and shined with a blue laser by Emmanuel Rousseau.
This book obviously departs from perfection, and is not exhaustive. I deeply
hope, however, that it fulﬁls most of the needs of people in academic laborat-
ories and most of the companies. To conclude, I would like to acknowledge all
the contributors, and in addition, Jessica White, S¨onke Adlung, Gandhimathi
Ganesan, and Victoria Mortimer at Oxford University Press.

Development of the nitride-based
UV/DUV LEDs
Hiroshi Amano
1.1
Introduction
The commercialization of the blue LED started in 1993 [1], and three primary-
color LEDs are now available commercially. Since 1993, the applications of LEDs
in various ﬁelds have expanded widely. Three years after the commercialization of
the blue LED, violet blue LD was developed [2], which is the shortest-wavelength
LD to be realized in the visible region. The use of the white LED, which is
composed of a blue LED with phosphors, has led to general lighting applica-
tions of LEDs in addition to conventional display applications. All these newly
developed devices, including blue LEDs and violet blue LDs, are composed of
group III nitride semiconductors. Research activity and commercial activity have
stimulated each other, forming a highly eﬀective feedback loop. Breakthroughs
made through research have rapidly resulted in the placement of new devices
on the market. These new devices are applied in ways not always expected
by researchers. The demand for new applications is also acting as a motivat-
ing force for new research and development. Therefore, the development of the
group-III-nitride-related ﬁeld is progressing very well.
The successful use of the group III nitrides in blue and the white LEDs and
the violet blue LD has led to attempts to realize LEDs and LDs in much shorter
wavelength regions such as the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-ultraviolet (DUV) re-
gions. UV/DUV LEDs and UV LDs will be useful for sterilization, lithography,
laser-induced ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, biomedical applications, chemical sens-
ing, chemical reaction control, prototyping, drilling, and optical storage, and
for use as an excitation source for phosphors and catalysts. For example, the
application of a UV/DUV LED to the treatment of skin diseases has been
reported [3].
Attempts to fabricate UV/DUV LEDs and UV LDs have been made by many
researchers, and rapid progress has been attained. The ﬁrst UV LED was repor-
ted by Pankove in 1972 and used colloidal carbon and nominally undoped n-type
GaN [4]. Since the ﬁrst pn-junction UV LED that emitted 375 nm light in 1989
[5], the emission wavelength of nitride-based LEDs has become shorter. In 2006
it reached 210 nm—the target shortest wavelength based on semiconductor light
emitters [6]. AlN was used as the active region. The emission wavelength of
UV LDs has also become shorter. Figure 1.1 shows the emission wavelength of

short-wavelength UV LDs as a function of calendar year. In 2008 the wavelength
reached 336 nm of the shortest-wavelength semiconductor LD, though it was
operated upon the pulsed mode [7]. This value has not been improved yet.
However, the performances of UV/DUV LEDs and UV LDs are still inferior to
those of blue/white LEDs. Figure 1.2 summarizes the development of the EQE
of UV/DUV LEDs as a function of calendar year. In 2012, the EQE reached
14.3% at 2 mA with an emission wavelength of 285 nm, which is still inferior to
that of state-of-the-art blue LEDs by a factor of six.
Clarifying the factors that limit the EQE of UV/DUV LEDs and UV LDs
is necessary to improve their performance. In general, there are three factors

that limit the EQE of LEDs: (1) internal quantum eﬃciency (ηIQE), (2) carrier
injection eﬃciency (ηIE), and (3) light extraction eﬃciency (ηLEE). Figure 1.3
shows schematically the eﬃciency-limiting process of LEDs.
Among these factors, IQE is dependent on the radiative recombination rate
of each material and the rate of non-radiative recombination, including Auger
recombination. Theoretically, the radiative recombination coeﬃcient of free ex-
citons in AlN is larger than that for GaN or InN [8]. Therefore, AlGaN-based
QWs should be more radiative or should have a higher IQE than InGaN-based
QWs. One of the most important factors for improving IQE is the growth of
AlGaN with low defect density. In the following section, the development of
the growth of AlGaN and the relationship between IQE and defect density are
described.
Carrier injection eﬃciency is strongly dependent on the hole concentration
in the p-type cladding layer as well as the alloy composition. With increasing
Al content in p-type AlGaN, the hydrogen-like eﬀective mass acceptor activa-
tion energy becomes large. Therefore, the room-temperature hole concentration
decreases with increasing Al content. Of course, hole concentration can be in-
creased by increasing the acceptor concentration. However, the heavy doping of
Mg causes serious problems. Therefore, there is an optimum Mg concentration
for obtaining a high hole concentration. In the following section, the eﬀect of a
low hole concentration in a p-type cladding layer on the performance of UV/DUV
LEDs is discussed.

Development of the nitride-based UV/DUV LEDs
The light extraction eﬃciency is the most important parameter that limits the
performance of UV/DUV LEDs. In general, face-up or face-down conﬁgurations
are used for LEDs. The face-up conﬁguration requires a transparent electrode.
Unfortunately, suitable electrode materials that are transparent in the UV/DUV
region are uncommon. In contrast, the face-down conﬁguration requires a highly
reﬂective electrode. There are some suitable materials that are reﬂective in the
DUV region. High contact resistivity to p-type AlGaN is one of the most seri-
ous issues. In the case of conventional Ni/Au, Indium-Tin-Oxide, or Ag-Pd-Cu
electrodes, p-GaN, which is opaque to UV and DUV light, is required to realize
low contact resistivity.
In the following section, issues regarding IQE that are related to the crystal
growth of AlGaN, IE and LEE are discussed in more detail.
1.2
Eﬃciency limiting process
1.2.1
Internal quantum eﬃciency
The MOVPE growth of AlGaN alloys was ﬁrst performed by Matloubian and
Gershenzon in 1985 [9]. The parasitic-gas-phase reaction between an Al source
such as trimethylaluminum (TMAl) and ammonia (NH3) [10], the decomposition
of TMAl in the gas phase to Al4C3 [11], or the very low rate of diﬀusion of an
Al precursor in an NH3-rich gas ﬂow, causes a reduction in the growth rate and
polymerization in the gas phase. Several groups have reported the eﬀectiveness
of alternative-source gas supplies or ﬂow-rate modulation using methods such as
pulsed-atomic-layer epitaxy [12], the alternative-source feeding technique [13],
migration-enhanced MOCVD [14], and the NH3 pulse-ﬂow multilayer growth
method [15]. An alternative-source supply was initiated by atomic-layer epitaxy
[16], then modiﬁed by gas-ﬂow-rate modulation during growth by MOVPE [17].
The eﬀectiveness of these gas-ﬂow-modulation techniques for the growth of AlN
and the fabrication of UV and DUV LEDs is summarized in reviews [18, 19].
Another approach to the growth of high-quality AlN is to grow AlN under a
relatively low NH3 partial-pressure at a high temperature. In the case of GaN
growth, the ratio of the molar fraction of group V source gases such as NH3 to
that of group III source gases such as trimethylgallium (TMGa), which is called
the V/III ratio, is approximately 1000 or even higher. For InGaN growth, the
V/III ratio should be much higher because of the high dissociation pressure of
nitrogen in InN. In contrast, the V/III ratio during AlN growth can be lower
[20, 21].
Recent experiments have shown that relatively high-quality AlN can be grown
at a V/III ratio of as low as 10, which is two orders of magnitude lower than that
for the growth of GaN. The growth temperatures of AlN and AlGaN are also
an important issue. The sublimation temperature of AlN is much higher than
that of GaN [22, 23]. Therefore, the epitaxial growth temperature of AlN is also
expected to be higher than that of GaN.

1400◦C, and (g)–(i) 1600◦C. The cross-sectional dark-ﬁeld TEM images in
the top row were taken under two-beam conditions with the incident beam
g// [0002] ((a), (d), and (g)). The TEM images in the middle row were taken
with g// [11–20] ((b), (e), and (h)). The TEM images on the bottom row
show bright-ﬁeld plan-view TEM images with g// [11–20] ((c), (f), and (i)).
Figure 1.4 shows cross-sectional dark-ﬁeld TEM images observed under
two diﬀerent incident beam conditions and bright-ﬁeld plan-view images of
MOVPE-grown AlN on a 6H-SiC substrate grown at diﬀerent temperatures [24].
With increasing growth temperature, the screw-type dislocations almost disap-
peared, as shown in (g), and the density of edge-type dislocations was also much
reduced, as in (i).
The AlN molar fraction of AlGaN is considered to be linearly dependent on
the ratio of the ﬂow rate of TMAl to the total ﬂow rate of group III alkyls; that,
is the sum of the ﬂow rates of TMAl and TMGa. This linear relationship holds
only at relatively low-growth temperatures. At high-growth temperatures, GaN
desorption leads to the growth of high-AlN-molar-fraction AlGaN. The thermo-
dynamic analysis conducted by Koukitsu et al. is very helpful in estimating the

vapor–solid relationship of AlGaN [25, 26]. Figure 1.5 shows the results of exper-
imental and thermodynamic analysis of the relationship between the Al content
in AlGaN and the growth temperature for two diﬀerent V/III ratios under a
ﬁxed TMGa/(TMGa+TMAl) supply ratio [26]. The experimental results agree
relatively well with the thermodynamic analysis.
To grow low-dislocation-density GaN, epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) us-
ing a dielectric mask has been very successful. However, a dielectric mask cannot
be applied to the selective growth of AlN-containing materials owing to the de-
position of polycrystals on the mask. Therefore, AlGaN growth on a maskless,
groove-patterned template has been investigated.
AlGaN growth on a groove-patterned GaN template in combination with a
low-temperature-deposited AlN interlayer (LT interlayer) has been found to be
very useful for the fabrication of UV LEDs and LDs with emission wavelengths
longer than 350 nm [27], whereas AlGaN growth on a patterned AlN template is
useful for the fabrication of UV/DUV LEDs with emission wavelengths shorter
than 350 nm [28–30]. Figure 1.6 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of AlN
grown at 1,450◦C on a Si-face 6H SiC substrate [31]. There is a lattice mismatch
between the AlGaN and the underlying AlN layer. Therefore, it is not easy to
grow low-dislocation-density AlGaN on AlN even though dislocation density in
underlying AlN is low.
Figure 1.7 summarizes the compositional dependence of the threading dislo-
cation density (TDD) in AlGaN grown on an AlN template with a dislocation
density of 107 cm−2 [32]. The lattice mismatch increases with increasing Ga con-
tent. Therefore, in the initial stage, the dislocation density increases with the Ga
content. However, after a certain thickness is reached, island and lateral growth
dominate, especially in high-Ga-content AlGaN, so the dislocation density tends
to decrease. A grooved template is eﬀective for further reducing the dislocation
density.

The IQEs of UV/DUV MQWs with diﬀerent TDDs were characterized by
measuring the excitation density dependence of photoluminescence (PL) using
an ArF excimer laser with a wavelength of 193 nm as the excitation source, which
is known as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) analysis [33–36]. In the case of UV/DUV

should be negligibly small. When the generation rate (G) is equal to the total
recombination rate (R), G = R and the PL integrated intensity are given by
the following formulae.
G = R = An + Bn2
(1.1)
IPL = ηBn2
(1.2)
Here, n is the excited carrier density, A is the non-radiative recombination con-
stant, B is the radiative recombination constant, and η is a constant determined
on the basis of the PL collection eﬃciency. Diﬀerences in the B value cause an
error in the absolute IQE value. It is currently unclear which value of B should
be used. However, the relative trend of the TDD dependence of IQE can be
discussed regardless of the chosen value of B.
By combining the above two formulas, G can be rewritten as
G =
A
√Bη

IPL + 1

Then, the non-radiative coeﬃcient A is deduced by curve ﬁtting, and the IQE
can be expressed as

duced assuming B to be 0.2 × 10−10 cm3/s. In this assumption, a non-radiative

1.2.2
Current injection eﬃciency
One of the most important and serious issues in the realization of high-eﬃciency
UV and DUV light emitters is conductivity control—particularly the control of
p-type conductivity. Highly conductive p-type layers are necessary to improve
the performance of UV/DUV emitters.
However, the control of p-type conductivity in AlxGa1-xN has proven to be
extremely diﬃcult. With increasing Al content in AlxGa1-xN, the activation en-
ergy of Mg dopants increases as well as the resistivity of the alloys. In addition,
although high-crystalline-quality AlxGa1-xN ﬁlms are necessary, it is diﬃcult to
grow them owing to the high concentration of dislocations in AlxGa1-xN alloys.
For this reason, it is very important to grow high-crystalline-quality AlxGa1-xN
and control the p-type conductivity of AlxGa1-xN. There have been several re-
ports on the analysis of Mg-doped p-type AlxGa1-xN by variable-temperature
Hall measurements, PL and CL [38–41]. The analysis of Mg-doped p-type AlN
is also one of the main challenges for the realization of high-eﬃciency UV and
DUV devices.
To determine the activation energy of Mg in AlGaN, it is necessary to avoid
other unwanted eﬀects such as residual impurities and extended defects. High-
temperature growth has been found to be eﬀective for reducing the concentration
of residual impurities. Figure 1.11 shows the concentrations of hydrogen, oxygen,
silicon, and carbon in nominally undoped AlN grown at 1,100◦C and 1,600◦C
[24]. As shown, the concentration of residual impurities is less than the detection
limit of SIMS in HT-grown AlN.

Fig. 1.12. Eﬀective activation energy of Mg acceptor in Al0.5Ga0.5N meas-
ured by temperature-dependent Hall eﬀect measurement as a function of
Mg concentration to the power of −1/3.
For Mg doping, Et-Cp2Mg or Cp2Mg is transported into the growth cham-
ber during growth. The as-grown layer becomes highly resistive upon hydrogen
passivation [42]. Post-growth annealing is usually conducted to activate the
hydrogen-passivated Mg [43].
Figure 1.12 shows the eﬀective acceptor activation energy of Mg in
Al0.5Ga0.5N as a function of the Mg concentration to the power of −1/3. The
eﬀective activation energy decreases with increasing Mg concentration up to
4 × 1019 cm−3. Above this concentration, the activation energy increases again.
The reason for the decrease in activation energy with increasing Mg concentration
is the Coulomb interaction between negatively charged Mg ions and positively
charged valence band holes [44, 45].
In contrast, the reason for the increase in activation energy above a Mg con-
centration of 4 × 1019 cm−3 has not yet been clariﬁed. Microscopic observation of
highly Mg-doped GaN and AlN shows the existence of inversion domain bound-
aries. Figure 1.13 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of Mg-doped/undoped
AlN on a sapphire (0001) substrate. Black dots can only be observed in the
Mg-doped layer, which are thought to be inversion domain boundaries caused
by Mg segregation at the surface. Similar dots have been reported to exist in
heavily Mg-doped GaN [46, 47].
Therefore, the optimum Mg concentration can be deduced and the composi-
tional dependence of the maximum hole concentration at room temperature can
be estimated. As shown in Fig. 1.14, the expected hole concentration in AlN is
only 3 × 1012 cm−3 at room temperature.
In a p-type AlGaN with such a low hole concentration, current injection eﬃ-
ciency (ηIE) should be low. At present, there is no method of directly measuring
ηIE. In this chapter, our attempts to estimate ηIE in a UV LD is explained.
The sample discussed was reported in ref. [48] and its structure is depicted in

A = 1.2 × 109 s−1, B = 2.4 × 10−11 cm3 s−1, ηIQE slightly below Jth: 34%,
λLD: 354.2 nm. The Auger coeﬃcient is thought to be negligible.
In this LD, a 20 nm p-type Al0.5Ga0.5N electron blocking layer was grown on
a p-type Al0.1Ga0.9N waveguide layer to avoid waveguide loss. SRH measurement
by current injection was conducted. In the case of PL measurement, the same
MQW structure without the p-type layers was measured. Figure 1.16 shows a
comparison of the eﬃciency measured by excitation-density-dependent PL and
electroluminescence (EL) current injection. If we assume that ηIQE measured by
PL gives the true ηIQE and that measured by EL gives the product of ηIQE and
ηIE, we can estimate ηIE, which is about 30–35%.

In the case of DUV LEDs, the situation is more serious because the hole
concentration in the p-type cladding decreases with increasing Al content. To
overcome this problem, several approaches have been considered. One is the use
of a multiple quantum barrier structure [49]. This idea was ﬁrst investigated by
Iga et al. [50] in 1.5-μm-range InGaAsP/InP and visible AlGaInP lasers. The
maximum EQE achieved was 1.2% at an emission wavelength of 250 nm.
Another approach is the use of a polarization ﬁeld. By using a compositionally
graded p-type AlGaN layer on AlN with an Al face, polarization-induced hole
doping is possible [51, 52].
Current state-of-the-art DUV LEDs have an EQE of 14.3% at 2 mA with an
emission wavelength of 285 nm. In these DUV LEDs, ηIE has been estimated to
be higher than 70%.

Light extraction eﬃciency
Compared with ηIQE and ηIE, ηLEE is still limited to a low value, as explained
in the introduction. One solution is to use a partially reﬂective electrode in the
face-down conﬁguration [53]. Figure 1.17 shows schematically the structure. The
output power was increased by 55% without a serious increase in the operating
voltage.

Summary
The recent development of UV/DUV LEDs and UV LDs and the factors limiting
their eﬃciency have been discussed. The reduction of TDD is essential to improve
IQE, while the use of polarization charges is found to be eﬀective in improving
IE. The remaining issue is the LEE. The development of new DUV transparent
electrode materials and/or DUV reﬂective materials with a large work function
and a new design rule and concept for devices using these polarized wide-band-
gap semiconductors are highly anticipated.

Introduction
GaN and its alloys with InN and AlN are at present an extremely important
group of semiconductors. Due to their outstanding physical properties GaN-
related compounds are basic for various applications of fundamental importance.
In particular, GaN, AlN, and InN are direct band-gap highly stable crystals and
can thus be used as very eﬃcient light sources. Moreover, their energy gaps of
0.65, 3.5, and 6.2 eV for InN, GaN, and GaN respectively, cover an extremely
large spectral range including the whole visible part of the spectrum.
On the other hand, technology of this important group of materials started its
development only in last two decades of twentieth century, though the ﬁrst GaN-
based light-emitting diode (LED) had already been demonstrated by Pankove
et al. (1971). A set of fundamental problems were, and still are, related to a lack
of single-crystalline high-quality native GaN substrates, p-type doping, lattice
mismatch between GaN and its ternaries with In and Al. All these problems
were a kind of challenge, and were solved by ways which are not typical for other
semiconductors such as Si or GaAs.
The main barrier for obtaining large high-quality bulk crystals of GaN is
related to thermodynamic properties of this compound, and in particular its
extreme melting conditions and very high decomposition pressure of nitro-
gen at elevated temperatures necessary for crystallization (see Section 2.2).
Therefore, as substrates for epitaxy, highly mismatched sapphire crystals with
low-temperature buﬀer (nucleation) layers of AlN (Amano et al., 1986) or
GaN (Nakamura et al., 1992) have been used to obtain device-quality mater-
ial. The p-type doping was ﬁrst achieved by electron irradiation of Mg-doped
GaN (Amano et al., 1989). Otherwise, the crystal was semi-insulating due to
passivation of Mg acceptor with hydrogen.
Sapphire-based heteroepitaxy allowed construction of eﬃcient LEDs (Amano
et al., 1989) despite a very high dislocation density of 108–1010 cm−2 in the epi-
taxial structures. For laser diodes (LDs) a further improvement of the material

quality was necessary (Nakamura and Fasol, 1997), and was achieved by epi-
taxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG), still on patterned sapphire substrates (Usui
et al., 1997).
First results conﬁrming quite obvious advantages of the use of low dislocation
density bulk GaN crystals came in the late 1990s (for a review see Grzegory and
Porowski, 2002 and Section 2.4). The substrate crystals were a few-millimeters-
large GaN platelets grown from solution in liquid gallium at very high pressure
of nitrogen (1–2 GPa) (Grzegory et al., 1995; Grzegory et al., 2005).
Despite their small size these crystals contained an extremely low number
(<100 cm−2) of dislocations, so properties of GaN homoepitaxial layers such
as straight atomic step ﬂow morphology, extremely narrow (<0.1 meV) exciton
peaks in the PL spectra and very slow decay of the PL due to suppression of the
non-radiative recombination, have been reported. The strongly n-type pressure
grown GaN crystals have been tested by Nakamura (1999) as substrate for the
InGaN 405 nm laser. The cw 30 mW devices with a lifetime exceeding 3000 h were
then constructed. The 30 mW power has been achieved at a current of 62 mA.
For typical InGaN MQW LDs on sapphire, at a current of 62 mA, the output
power was about 15 mW. This increase in eﬃciency conﬁrmed that dislocations
were the main limiting factors for high-power GaN-based lasers.
At present, the great majority of GaN-based laser diodes is being produced on
GaN free-standing single crystalline substrates. However, these substrates are not
sliced from perfect bulk crystals as in typical cases, but grown by hydride vapor
phase epitaxy (HVPE) on foreign (again!) material (mostly GaAs) by a “wafer by
wafer” approach, which means a single wafer of GaN obtained on a single GaAs
(or sapphire) substrate. Moreover, the method based on GaAs heteroepitaxy
developed by Sumitomo Electric Industries (2010; Motoki 2010) includes special
procedures (dislocation elimination by epitaxy on inversed pyramids—DEEP or
A-DEEP) to obtain areas in the substrate with dislocation densities suﬃciently
low for high-power laser diodes. The crystals are therefore intentionally non-
uniform (they contain domains of inversed polarity), and the LDs have to be
positioned in the low-dislocation-density sectors.
The free-standing GaN wafers grown by HVPE and removed from sapphire
(i.e. Oshima et al., 2010) are uniform but with a dislocation density of the order
of 106 cm−2 and with crystalline planes deformed (bowed) due to a large lattice
and thermal mismatch between sapphire and GaN.
It is worth noticing that the bulk growth of GaN by HVPE on the GaN free-
standing substrates is a kind of homoepitaxial challenge in itself. There are no
reports of the successful growth of a bulk GaN crystal thicker than 5–6 mm by
HVPE, despite the method being highly advanced.
In this chapter the use of GaN crystals grown by both high nitrogen pressure
solution (HNPS) and ammonothermal method for laser diodes and laser diode
arrays is discussed. The pressure-grown crystals are of high structural perfec-
tion, and can be of high electric conductivity and high degree of uniformity,
which is especially important for integrated multi-laser devices. In Section 2.2,

20
The homoepitaxial challenge
thermodynamic properties of GaN, including melting conditions, are described.
Then, in Section 2.3, the methods of GaN crystallization relevant to this chapter,
i.e. the HNPS and the ammonothermal ones, are presented. The HVPE as a
leading method is also discussed, for reference.
In Section 2.4 some of the most important features of homoepitaxy by both
MOVPE (metal organic vapor phase epitaxy) and MBE (molecular beam epi-
taxy) on the pressure-grown crystals are shown, with special emphasis on the
results obtained by plasma-assisted MBE (PA MBE), which is not common for
GaN-based technology dominated by MOVPE, but provides very encouraging
results if the pressure-grown crystals are used as substrates.
Section 2.5 is devoted to the development of nitrides epitaxy by PA MBE
towards fabrication of LDs and laser diode arrays over a large spectral range.
In Section 2.6 an advantage related to the very high free electron concentration
possible in the pressure-grown GaN crystals is discussed. The physical basis for
this advantage is a refractive index contrast between the very high and lower
conductivity GaN. Section 2.7 shows another possibility following from high uni-
formity and ﬂat crystalline planes in the pressure-grown crystals: the lateral
patterning enabling local variation of the substrate miscut, thus the arrays of
lasers emitting light with diﬀerent wavelengths. Section 2.8 presents the state-
of the art results on high-power LDs and laser diode arrays based on epitaxial
structures grown on both ammonothermal and HNPS GaN substrates.
2.2
Thermodynamics of GaN
2.2.1
Melting conditions of GaN
Aluminum, gallium, and indium nitrides are strongly bonded compounds, cre-
ating relatively low-density crystalline lattices in which the metallic atoms are
surrounded by four nearest neighbors (nitrogen atoms). Such structure is stabil-
ized by interatomic interactions strongly dependent on the mutual orientation
of the triples of the metal-nonmetal atoms. Such interactions are covalent in
nature, i.e. they are created by the dominant overlap of the wavefunction of the
neighboring atoms. In addition, the diﬀerence of the energies of the external or-
bitals of metal and nitrogen atoms is suﬃciently large that it contributes to ionic
fraction of the bonding energy.
Generally, melting transitions entail disappearance of the long- and short-
range order. In order to destroy a strongly bonded lattice, thermal agitation
has to be high, therefore melting of these compounds occurs at relatively high
temperatures. The demolition of the covalent bonding closes the band gap, there-
fore molten homogeneous nitrides should be metallic, similar to other III-V
semiconductors.
In contrast to the above, the presence of nitrogen shows the nitrides as
qualitatively diﬀerent from other elemental or compound III–V and II–VI semi-
conductors. Nitrogen has an exceptional tendency to form very strongly bonded
diatomic molecules; in fact, the N2 molecule is the strongest bonded diatomic

21
molecule of all, with a bond energy equal to 9.72 eV (Barin, 1994). It is there-
fore expected that nitrogen, liberated from the crystalline lattice of the nitrides,
would have a strong tendency to form molecules. Nitrogen in molecular form
resembles noble gases, and interacts very weakly with other nitrogen molecules
(Strak and Krukowski, 2007). In good approximation this interaction may be
represented by pair-wise potential (Bohm and Ahlrichs, 1985). Nitrogen critical-
point parameters, both temperature (126.19 K) and pressure (3.3978 MPa)
(Jacobsen et al., 1986), are much lower than the expected values of these para-
meters at the melting points of the nitrides, therefore under these conditions
pure nitrogen is a supercritical ﬂuid. The molecular structure is very diﬃcult to
atomize, as shown by the results of shock-wave compression experiments where
at about 33 GPa and 6000 K, nitrogen underwent continuous molecular to non-
molecular transition (Nellis et al., 1984). Low-temperature diamond anvil data
indicated that at room temperature nitrogen remains in molecular structure up
to 130 GPa (Reichlin et al., 1985). These results were conﬁrmed by the demon-
stration that nitrogen transforms to an amorphous phase, most likely a narrow
band-gap semiconductor, at 70–250 GPa and 10–510 K (Gregoryanz et al., 2001;
Goncharov et al., 2000; Eremets et al., 2001). DFT calculations conﬁrmed that
nitrogen is stable in the molecular form up to pressures of 70 GPa (McMahan
and LeSar, 1985; Martin and Needs, 1986). Therefore, it is expected that pure
nitrogen remains in the molecular form at pressures and temperatures well above
the melting parameters of the nitrides.
Group III metals are diﬀerent from nitrogen in all possible aspects. In the
condensed phase they are metals bonded by uniform attraction of free electrons
and positive ions. Their angular dependence of the interaction is weak, so their
crystalline lattices are not rigid and their melting temperatures are relatively
low, equal to 933.47 K, 302.9146 K, and 429.7485 K for aluminum, gallium,
and indium respectively (Glushko, 1979). In contrast, the radial component is
very strong, leading to high enthalpies of evaporation, equal to 3.32 eV/atom,
2.81
eV/atom,
and
2.50
eV/atom
for
these
substances
(Barin,
1994;
Glushko, 1979). Accordingly, their vapor pressures are very low and the boiling-
point (0.1 MPa) temperatures are high, equal to 2792 K, 2477 K, and 2345 K,
for these three metals respectively. It is therefore natural to assume that at the
expected nitride melting temperatures, pure Al, Ga, and In are metallic liquids.
The interaction of the group III metals and nitrogen is relatively strong.
Nevertheless, little is known about its magnitude and other characteristics. An
order of magnitude may be deduced from DFT simulations of nitrogen adsorption
on the III group metal surfaces that showed strong catalytic eﬀect, leading to
dissociation of molecular nitrogen at adsorption on these metals (Romanowski
et al., 2001). The catalytic inﬂuence lowers the N2 dissociation energy barrier
from 9.81 eV to much below 4 eV, proving a strong interaction between In, Ga,
Al, and nitrogen. At the surface, the nitrogen atoms are attached in stable (Al)
or metastable (Ga and In) positions. It has to be noted that these calculations
assumed negligible solubility of the nitrogen, as observed during growth from

22
The homoepitaxial challenge
solution in technically accessible nitrogen pressures, i.e. up to 1.5 GPa (Grzegory
et al., 2001). From these calculations we could infer that at low concentration
nitrogen dissociate, in metal liquids remaining in the atomic form. Unfortunately,
no information on the physical properties of the mixture of metals and higher
nitrogen contents is available. It is not clear whether nitrogen and metal separate
into nitrogen and metal-rich ﬂuids or create a solution of atomic metals and
nitrogen. These issues remain to be solved in the future.
The above-described complex scenario was not accounted for in the early
attempts to solve the mystery of nitrides melting. Two approaches were used:
dynamic and thermodynamic. Dynamic theory was based on the Lindemann cri-
terion of melting, according to which, the melting occurs when the amplitude of
thermal lattice vibrations exceeds a speciﬁed x0 fraction of the interatomic spa-
cing (atomic radius) (Lindemann, 1910), which relates the melting temperature
TM, the Debye temperature Θ, and the atomic mass M:
TM = kBx2
0d2MΘ2
9ℏ2
.
(2.1)
Usually, the atomic fraction x0 ranges from 0.2 to 0.25 (Ziman, 1964). The applic-
ation of the dynamic criterion to the melting of semiconductors was criticized by
Van Vechten (1972), who claimed that the approach is deﬁcient because the liquid
phase is not involved. For GaN, melting temperature evaluated with eq. (2.1) is
2291 K.
Van Vechten invoked a thermodynamic approach to the melting of semicon-
ductors in which the melting temperature is expressed as the ratio of the enthalpy
(ΔHF ) and entropy (ΔSF ) of fusion:
TM = ΔHF
ΔSF ,
(2.2)
using these parameters for silicon as a base for scaling for other compounds
(Van Vechten, 1972). Enthalpy was initially scaled with the Fermi energy, while
the entropy, derived as the sum of the contribution from melting of the metallic
phase, mixing and dissociation of covalent bonds, was assumed to be constant.
In the subsequent more sophisticated approach, the enthalpy of fusion was cal-
culated as the sum of the metallic phase melting contribution, the volume term,
and the energy of dissociation of covalent bonds (Van Vechten, 1973). The
second term was responsible for the pressure-dependence of the melting tem-
perature. Since it was assumed that a tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductor
was less dense, thus following the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, the pressure coef-
ﬁcient of the melting temperatures of all nitrides was determined as negative.
The last term assumed sp3 hybridization of the bonding of the nitrides, which
turned out to be justiﬁed for AlN only. Recent results obtained from soft X-ray
spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations showed
that bonding in GaN proceeds via N 2s–Ga 3d and N 2p–Ga 4s, 4p separately
(Magnuson et al., 2010). Thus the basic assumptions of the theory were put into

23
the question. The entropy was taken using an earlier introduced dependence
(Van Vechten, 1973). Using this approach, Van Vechten derived the temperature
of fusion to be 3487 K, 2791 K, and 831 K for AlN, GaN, and InN respect-
ively. Later, the melting temperature of indium nitride was corrected to 2200 K
(Grzegory, 1995).
High-pressure experiments were used for the determination of melting of GaN
detected by in situ X-ray diﬀraction (Utsumi et al., 2003). The results of the
measurements indicated that GaN was stable at pressures above 6.0 GPa at
temperatures up to 2493 K. At higher temperatures the crystal was melted,
and crystallized when cooled down, so that small single-crystalline samples were
obtained. It was concluded that GaN melts congruently at 2493 K. The pressure
dependence of the melting temperature was also determined, showing that the
pressure-related variation of the melting temperature was very small, below the
precision of the temperature measurements, for pressures increased up to 10 GPa.
Another high-pressure experiment brought a diﬀerent set of data: at pressure of
7.5 GPa GaN was stable up to 2573 K, and unstable at the temperature of
100 K higher (Sokol et al., 2007). Thus it was concluded that the GaN melting
pressure is about 7.5 GPa and the temperature is located within 2573—2673 K.
In addition, the X-ray measurements reported in Sokol et al. (2007) indicated
that gallium nitride melts incongruently at this pressure range. It was conjectured
that the transition to congruent melting occurs at even higher pressures (Sokol
et al., 2007). In summary, these experiments showed that GaN melting occurs
at very high pressures above 6.0 GPa and temperatures close to 2500 K.
The nature of the transition is still undetermined, as it is not clear whether
molten gallium and nitrogen remain in atomic state or are separated into the
atomic gallium liquid and molecular supercritical nitrogen ﬂuid.
Numerical simulations may potentially shed more light on the issue of nitride
melting. In absence of extensive experimental data, they are particularly useful,
despite formidable potential diﬃculties. They are related to drastic change of
the properties of the coexisting phases and complex interactions between atoms,
and possible molecules.
In the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of GaN melting transition the
two main approaches were based either on two-body or three-body interactions.
The two-body interactions were used by Harafuji et al. (2004). The authors ap-
plied extensive MD simulations and obtained two diﬀerent pressure dependences
of the melting temperature:
TM =

2538 + 177 × P −4.62 × P 2
P < 8GPa
2825 + 210 × P −5 × P 2
P > 9GPa
(2.3)
with the discontinuity in the vicinity of 8–9 GPa. The melting point was identiﬁed
at TM = 2500–2550 K (at normal pressure). Additionally, an extensive metasta-
bility region was obtained during cooling. Two-body potential was also used by
Moon et al. (2007) in MD simulations from which the melting temperature was

The homoepitaxial challenge
estimated as 3080 K. Three-body Tersoﬀempirical potential (Tersoﬀ, 1988, 1989)
was applied by Moon and Hwang (2003), who modeled melting of zincblende
GaN obtaining TM = 2302 ± 330 K. Finally, Wang and Zhu (2006) used
Stillinger–Weber potential (Stillinger and Weber, 1985) and obtained melt-
ing temperature of wurtzite GaN: TM = 4200 K, much above the other
estimates.
In summary, melting of nitrides remains one of the great unresolved issues of
condensed-matter physics, important for applications and for basic understand-
ing of the matter. Neither the existence or the character of the transition is
positively identiﬁed. High-pressure experiments are necessary to determine the
range of possible parameters. It is also worth noting that MD simulations us-
ing many-body potential may not be suitable for verifying the character of the
transition, and that massively parallel ab initio MD simulation are the best way
to solve the issue.
Table 2.1 compares melting temperatures and pressures of most typical semi-
conductor materials. The melting conditions of GaN are derived from Utsumi
et al. (2003) where, as already mentioned, they have been determined exper-
imentally by the in situ X-ray high-pressure high-temperature measurements.
The table shows that both temperature and pressure at melting of GaN are
much higher than for typical semiconductors. They are rather similar to the
conditions used for high-pressure synthesis of diamond.
2.2.2
High-pressure thermodynamics of GaN: phase diagrams
As directly reﬂected in the high value of melting temperature, gallium nitride
is a strongly bonded compound (with a bonding energy of 9.12 eV/atom pair
(Melnik et al., 1998)) in comparison with typical III–V semiconductors such as
GaAs (bonding energy of 6.5 eV/atom pair). Consequently, the free energy of the
crystal is very low in relation to the reference state of free N and Ga atoms. On the
other hand, the N2 molecule is also strongly bonded (4.9 eV/atom (Barin, 1994)).
Therefore, the free energy of GaN constituents at their normal states, Ga and

N2, becomes quite close to that of the crystal. Figure 2.1 shows where the free
energy of GaN (1 mole) and the free energy of the system of its constituents
(Ga + 1/2N2) is shown as a function of temperature and N2 pressure. With
increasing temperature, G(T) of the constituents decreases faster than G(T) of
the crystal, and at higher temperatures the nitride becomes thermodynamically
unstable. The crossing of G(T) curves determines the equilibrium temperature
where GaN coexists with its constituents at given N2 pressure. The application
of pressure increases the free energy of the constituents to a much higher degree
than G(T) of the crystal. As a consequence, the equilibrium point shifts to higher
temperatures and the GaN stability range extends.
The equilibrium pN2-T conditions for GaN have been studied by several
groups (Karpinski and Porowski, 1984; Karpinski et al., 1984; MacChesney
et al., 1970; Thurmond and Logan, 1972; Madar et al., 1975; Unland et al., 2003).
The most complete and consistent results have been obtained by Karpinski and
Porowski (1984) and Karpinski et al. (1984) by direct synthesis and by decompos-
ition experiments performed by both the gas-pressure technique (for pressures
up to 20 kbar) and high-pressure anvil technique (up to 70 kbar). The curve
following from these data is shown in Fig. 2.2. In the temperature range of
1100–1690◦C (corresponding to the pressure range of 0.1–20 kbar), the curve
was described by the van’t Hoﬀequation:
ΔHF = 1
2Rd log aN2
d(1/T) ,
(2.4)
where ΔHF is the formation enthalpy of GaN, and aN2 is the equilibrium activity
of N2 gas with ΔHF constant and equal to −37.7 kcal/mole.
Figure 2.3 shows the equilibrium pN2-T curves for AlN, GaN, and InN. The
curve for AlN has been calculated by Slack and MacNelly (1976). The curve
for InN has been proposed by Grzegory (1996), and follows from Diﬀerential

Thermal Analysis and annealing of InN at high N2 pressure. The curves for GaN
and InN, at higher pressures deviate from linear dependence due to the non-ideal
behavior of N2 gas.
The diagrams of Fig. 2.3 indicate extremely large diﬀerences in thermal sta-
bility of III–V nitrides: This is caused mainly by the diﬀerences in bonding
energy of the crystals. Bonding energy in III–V nitrides is 11.52, 9.12, and 7.72
eV/atom pair for AlN, GaN, and InN, respectively. The consequences of this
high bonding energy are high melting temperatures and good thermal stability
for the considered compounds, especially AlN and GaN. Indium nitride is much
less stable than GaN, and this is the main reason for diﬃculties in growth of InN
and In-rich InGaN epitaxial layers, since low temperatures and high potential of
nitrogen are necessary.
The extension of the GaN stability range by the application of pressure al-
lows the growth GaN crystals from the solution in the liquid Ga. Figure 2.4
shows the N solubility data resulting from the annealing of Ga in N2 atmosphere
in the three-phase equilibrium conditions (Grzegory, 1995; Grzegory, 1996). Even
the highest temperature available for large-volume gas pressure systems (about
2000 K) is quite far from the melting temperature of GaN (Table 2.1). Therefore,
the N concentrations are not high (below 1 at. %), and the growth experiments
have to be long to obtain high-quality crystals with dimensions appropriate for
research and applications. For this reason, an additional requirement for the
experimental system is the extended time for stable work.
The solid line in Fig. 2.4 is the liquidus line for Ga–GaN system calcu-
lated in ideal solution approximation (Grzegory, 1995; Grzegory, 1996) with

ideal solution approximation (Grzegory, 1995; Grzegory, 1996).

Van Vechten’s melting temperature of 2790 K (Van Vechten, 1973). For this
approximation the solubility can be expressed as follows:
n = n0
ΔHsol

,
(2.5)
where ΔHsol is the heat of dissolution. For GaN, ΔHsol = 44.7 kcal/mole =
0.49 eV/bond, and expresses the bonding energy in the crystal in relation to
its mother phase (the solution). It is equivalent to heat of crystallization, since
ΔHsol = −ΔHcryst.
The analysis of thermodynamical properties of GaN and the system of its
constituents explains the role of high pressure as a factor increasing ther-
modynamical potential of the constituents that makes the crystal stable at
temperatures necessary for crystallization. The pressure, however, is important
also for kinetics of GaN synthesis. The synthesis of GaN from its constituents
is possible due to dissociative chemisorption of N2 molecule on the Ga surface,
as was shown by Romanowski et al. (2001) by using the Density Functional
Theory calculations. The nitrogen molecule dissociates on the Ga surface only if
it overcomes the potential barrier of about 3.5 eV. Therefore, the density of the
interacting gas is of crucial importance.
Both the increase of thermodynamical potential of gaseous nitrogen and
the enhancement of N2 dissociation by lowering of the potential barrier can
be achieved by other (not compression) methods such as the excitement of N2
plasma or the use of species containing nitrogen atoms bonded weaker than in
Fig. 2.5. The result of GaN synthesis from the liquid Ga and N2 plasma. The
liquid has been pushed out from the initial droplet covered by GaN crust, by

N2 molecule (NH3). These eﬃcient sources of nitrogen are commonly used in
epitaxial growth techniques of nitrides: NH3 in MOVPE and HVPE, and nitro-
gen plasma in plasma-assisted MBE. It was demonstrated (Porowski and Jun;
Lucznik et al.) that in microwave nitrogen plasma of 60 Torr and temperature
as low as 1100◦C, a very eﬃcient GaN (and even InN!) synthesis is possible. The
excited N2 gas was a very eﬃcient source to saturate a Ga droplet with atomic
nitrogen and to form a GaN crust on the droplet surface. However, since the pres-
sure in the system was much lower than the equilibrium one (about 100 bar for
1100◦C), the N2 gas phase started to nucleate and grow in the liquid. This resul-
ted in the formation of the structure shown in Fig. 2.5, the empty “Ga droplet”
covered with irregular polycrystalline GaN.
2.3
Crystal growth of GaN
As indicated in Section 2.2.1, GaN melts congruently at high nitrogen pressure
(>6 GPa) and high temperature (>2497 K) (Utsumi et al., 2003). Due to these
extreme melting conditions, GaN cannot be grown from its stoichiometric melt
with methods commonly used for other semiconductors such as Si or GaAs.
Therefore, GaN single crystals have to be grown using methods combining lower
pressures and lower temperatures.
There are several alternative approaches for growing GaN crystals. First
is crystallization from the vapor phase, called Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy
(HVPE), by which GaN is deposited on a foreign substrate (such as sapphire or
GaAs), through the reaction of ammonia with gallium chloride at temperatures
about 1050◦C and at ambient pressure. The foreign substrate is then removed by
etching, laser lift-oﬀ, or self lift-oﬀtechniques, and then a large-diameter free-
standing GaN wafer can be obtained. Another important approach producing
GaN crystals of the highest quality in terms of their structure and size is crystal-
lization from solution in supercritical NH3, called the ammonothermal method
(Doradzinski et al., 2010). This is a high-pressure method analogous to the hy-
drothermal crystallization of quartz or oxide crystals such as ZnO. In place of
water as a solvent, ammonia is used.
Gallium nitride can be also grown from solution in gallium–sodium mixtures.
The growth is carried out at temperatures from 700◦C to 900◦C and a nitrogen
pressure up to 5 MPa (Kawamura et al., 2008). This method has been developed
at Osaka University and produces bulk GaN single crystals a few millimeters
thick, with a diameter of two or three inches and a defect density of the order of
105 cm−2.
The crystals with the lowest dislocation density, 102 cm−2, have been obtained
by the High Nitrogen Pressure Solution (HNPS) method (Grzegory et al., 1995;
Grzegory et al., 2005). This method is based on the direct synthesis reaction
between liquid gallium and nitrogen at high temperature (up to 1800 K) and
high nitrogen pressure (up to 2 GPa). The spontaneous growth of HNPS-GaN
results in crystals having the form of small hexagonal platelets (of about 1 cm2).

30
The homoepitaxial challenge
In the following, both high-pressure methods of GaN crystallization HNPS
and ammonothermal are described. For comparison, crystallization by HVPE
as the most common method of growing free-standing GaN substrates is
characterized.
2.3.1
GaN by HVPE
The HVPE (Maruska and Titjen, 1969; Seifert et al., 1981; Usui et al., 1997)
is the most advanced GaN crystallization method in terms of obtaining large-
diameter single-crystalline free-standing substrates. There are two approaches to
the fabrication of such GaN wafers: epitaxial growth on foreign substrates, and
bulk crystallization. The epitaxial growth on foreign substrates includes depos-
ition of a few hundreds of micrometers thick GaN layer on GaAs or sapphire,
and separation of the substrate by chemical etching (GaAs) or by methods based
on engineering of strain in a GaN-sapphire system. Usually, the initial substrates
are patterned in a special way in order to enforce lateral overgrowth mechanisms
allowing signiﬁcant reduction of dislocation density in the ﬁnal GaN wafer.
The big advantage of the HVPE method is the relatively fast growth rate of
up to 500 μm/h. However, the main disadvantage is the phenomenon of parasitic
nucleation. This superﬂuous GaN nucleation occurs in many places in the HVPE
reactor, and often leads to uncontrolled changes in crystal growth conditions
during the crystallization run. Thus, the crystallization time must be suﬃciently
short, and unfortunately this necessitates a thin crystal. This is the main reason
why GaN crystals grown by HVPE are generally not thicker than 1 mm.
Some diﬃculties are also observed with doping to obtain highly n-type or
semi-insulating substrates by HVPE. With increasing donor (Si, Ge) or acceptor
(Fe) concentrations in HVPE-GaN crystals, the structural quality decreases.
Typical free carrier concentration for free-standing GaN material does not exceed
1018 cm−3.
The next disadvantage of HVPE technology is lattice bowing of the grown
GaN crystals. The absolute value of bowing radii of crystallographic planes of
GaN grown by HVPE on sapphire is usually not bigger than 10 meters. This
is the reason why free-standing HVPE-GaN crystals are not commonly used as
seeds for further HVPE growth.
It is possible to grow crystallographically ﬂat, free-standing HVPE-GaN by
changing the growth mode during the HVPE process, from a ﬂat one to a rough
one. However, such crystals may contain inversion domains. The best HVPE
“free-standing GaN” technology has been developed by SEI (Motoki et al., 2007;
Motoki, 2010). In their process, very good quality free-standing HVPE-GaN
crystals have been grown by depositing GaN on GaAs wafers. GaAs has a
thermal expansion coeﬃcient similar to GaN, therefore the crystallized GaN
on GaAs is not so curved. An additional reason why SEIs substrates are crystal-
lographically ﬂat is due to the growth method. It is based on selective growth
of the nitride and subsequent regrowth on the surface containing large inverse

pyramidal pits (DEEP and A-DEEP methods). Thus, the crystal is grown in
the controlled rough-growth mode with the presence of intentionally introduced
inversion domains.
The defects in SEIs crystals are collected in an “organized” manner consisting
of 400-μm wide stripes, alternating with low and high defect density. In spite
of an inhomogeneous threading dislocation density varying from 104 cm−2 to
5 × 108 cm−2, high-quality laser diode structures have been grown on these sub-
strates, and they are the basis for the manufacture of BluRay laser diodes. Laser
chips are positioned on the stripes of low density of defects and without the
inversion domains to produce reliable devices. The free carrier concentration in
SEIs substrates is about 5 × 1018 cm−3. In the HVPE process the impurities are
incorporated into GaN in an anisotropic way (Grzegory et al., 2007). The growth
of pits is not the growth in the crystallographic c-direction, but in semi-polar
directions. Therefore, the free carrier concentration in SEIs substrates is relat-
ively high. As mentioned, SEI has demonstrated 6-inch GaN substrates, most
likely obtained by DEEP or A-DEEP growth methods.
The best method for producing good-quality, free-standing GaN crystals
grown on sapphire by HVPE using the ﬂat growth mode has been developed
by Hitachi Cable by a technique named “Void Assisted Separation” (VAS)
(Oshima et al., 2010). The growth proceeds on a sapphire substrate covered
with an ultrathin layer of MOCVD-GaN and nanometric titanium nitride (TiN).
The method allows 3-inch GaN substrates with a dislocation density of about
106 cm−2, uniformly distributed over the surface of the crystal, a free carrier
concentration of about 1018 cm−3, and a lattice bowing radius smaller than
10 meters.
An alternative approach—i.e. the real bulk growth with subsequent slicing
and polishing of the resulting crystals—is technically more diﬃcult because of
parasitic deposition during long HVPE growth runs and exhausting of the gal-
lium ingot. Nevertheless, there are reports on the successful growth of 2-inch
GaN boules with a thickness of up to 10 mm. The “bulk approach” has the
additional advantage that the crystal can be sliced in various directions. Thus
substrates of required orientations including non-polar and semi-polar ones can
be obtained. The most important result on bulk crystallization of GaN by HVPE
has been reported be Fujito et al. (2009) from Mitsubishi Chemical Co. In this
work, a beautiful GaN crystal with diameter of 52 mm and thickness of 5.8 mm,
free of morphological instability features, with a dislocation density of 106 cm−2,
was shown. The main problem to solve indicated by the authors was a decrease
of the crystal diameter with thickness, due to the formation of inclined facets at
the crystal border.
These results strongly supported the view that HVPE can be an eﬀective ap-
proach to produce high-quality, thick-bulk GaN crystals. It is very probable that
the use of a perfect seed crystal obtained by i.e. ammonothermal method, with
no bowing and with very low dislocation density, could signiﬁcantly accelerate
the progress in bulk crystallization of GaN by HVPE. It should, however, be

32
The homoepitaxial challenge
remembered that HVPE of GaN is very sensitive to crystallographic orientation
of the crystallization front regarding incorporation of impurities. It can be relev-
ant for the creation of internal stresses in the growing crystals, especially if the
growth proceeds with a high rate where three-dimensional growth features can
appear. Also, the appearance of semi-polar side facets can introduce sectors of
diﬀerent physical properties than crystal growing on the (0001) polar surface.
2.3.2
High-nitrogen-pressure solution growth of GaN
If the concentration of atomic nitrogen in the liquid gallium exceeds the equi-
librium value, the excess nitrogen is removed from the liquid by formation of
N-rich phases: N2 if the pressure in the system is lower than required for GaN
at given T, or GaN crystals if the pressure is high enough for stability of GaN.
At the p-T conditions corresponding to the GaN stability range, the solubility
of nitrogen in gallium is an increasing function of temperature (Fig. 2.4). So, if a
temperature gradient is maintained in the system, crystal growth is expected in
the cooler part of the solution, which is schematically shown in Fig. 2.6. This is
because nitrogen dissolved in the hotter part (larger equilibrium concentration)
is transported by diﬀusion and convection, which leads to the appearance of
excess nitrogen in the cooler part (lower equilibrium concentration).
At present, GaN is crystallized in gas-pressure chambers with an internal
volume of 1500 cm3 and 4500 cm3, allowing crucibles with internal diameters of
25 and 50 mm respectively. The high-pressure–high-temperature reactors con-
sisting of the pressure chambers and the multizone furnaces are equipped with
additional systems necessary for in situ annealing in vacuum, electronic sta-
bilization and programming of pressure and temperature, and cooling of the
pressure chamber. Pressure in the chamber is stabilized with a precision better
than 10 bar. The temperature is measured by a set of thermocouples arranged
along the furnace and coupled with the standard input power control electronic

systems based on Eurotherm units. This allows stabilization of temperature of
±0.2 deg. and programmable changes of temperature distribution in the crucible.
The 4500 cm3-high pressure chamber of internal diameter 100 mm is presented
in Fig. 2.7.
The experiments on spontaneous (unseeded) crystallization of GaN were
performed mostly in the vertical conﬁguration corresponding to Fig. 2.6 at tem-
peratures of 1700–1850 K (Grzegory et al., 2005). The temperature diﬀerence
between the hot and the cold zones of the solution was usually 20–50 K. The
pressure of N2 exceeded the equilibrium value corresponding to the highest tem-
perature in the system to keep the solubility relation in agreement with the
Ga–GaN liquidus shown in Fig. 2.4. In such a conﬁguration, dissolved nitrogen
is transported to the crystallization zone by diﬀusion and convection. At the
typical conditions of our experiments, the convection mechanism plays a dom-
inant role (Grzegory et al., 2002). The crystals nucleated spontaneously on the
crucible walls at the cooler zone of the solution, and a typical duration of the
processes was 80–150 hours.
The dominating morphological form of GaN crystals grown by the high-
pressure method is a thin hexagonal platelet (Fig. 2.6). The large hexagonal
surfaces of the platelets correspond to {0001} polar crystallographic planes of

34
The homoepitaxial challenge
the wurzite structure. The side faces of the crystals are mainly the polar {1011}
and also non-polar {1010} planes. The maximum lateral size of the platelets
for 100–150 h processes is 10–20 mm, whereas the thickness is 80–120 μm. The
crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grown slowly, with a rate <0.1 mm/h
into {1010} directions (perpendicular to the c-axis), are usually single crystals
of perfect morphology, suggesting stable layer-by-layer growth. They are trans-
parent, with ﬂat mirror-like faces. The habit of the crystals does not change for
solutions containing Mg or Be.
As one can deduce from the form of the crystals, the growth is strongly
anisotropic, being much faster (about 100 times) in directions perpendicular to
the c-axis. This relation is valid at supersaturations corresponding to the average
growth rate in {1010} directions of 0.05–0.1 mm/h. The supersaturation in the
growth solution is determined mainly by the growth temperature, temperature
gradients, and mass transport mechanisms in gallium, and also by the local
surrounding for a particular crystal (neighboring crystals).
The signiﬁcant increase of ΔT (i.e. up to 100 K) does not lead to a spectacular
increase of the growth rates but rather to growth instabilities on the {0001} polar
surfaces of the crystals. The most frequently observed features of the unstable
growth are cellular structures, accelerated growth at the edges exposed to the
N-ﬂow, and in the extreme case the hollow needles elongated into c-directions.
As already mentioned in Section 2.2, the N2 molecules dissociate at the con-
tact with the Ga surface. However, to approach the surface they have to overcome
a quite high (about 3.5 eV) potential barrier which lowers substantially the rate
of nitrogen dissociation and its further dissolution in the metal. For oxygen
interacting with Ga, there is no potential barrier for dissociation (Krukowski
et al., 2001), and therefore even traces of this impurity in the growth system are
sources of the unintentional oxygen doping of GaN. Consequently, the crystals
are strongly n-type with a free electron concentration of about 5 × 1019 cm−3
(metallic conductivity) and mobility of about 60 cm2/Vs. These free carriers can
be fully eliminated by an Mg acceptor added to the growth solution. Then the
resistivity of the crystals becomes as high as 104–106 Ωcm at 300 K. Usually the
GaN:Mg crystals become p-type with an activation energy of 150 meV.
The presence of the native point defects in the crystals has been checked
by positron annihilation measurements (Saarinen et al., 1997). High concen-
tration of Ga vacancies (VGa) has been found in the conductive crystals, in
contrast to the Mg-doped samples where no Ga-vacancies has been observed.
This agreed with the theoretical prediction that the formation energy of VGa
decreases with the increase of the Fermi-level energy (Neugebauer and Van de
Walle, 1994), suggesting that the creation of these defects is thermodynamically
controlled.
The most important advantage of the pressure-grown GaN is the extremely
low density of dislocations (lower than 100 cm−2) as shown by defect selective
etching in molten KOH–NaOH eutectics (Weyher et al., 1997) of (0001) Ga-polar
surfaces of both n-type and Mg-doped crystals.

Crystal growth of GaN
35
As was mentioned earlier in the conditions where the platelets are crystal-
lized, the growth of GaN is strongly anisotropic, being about 100 times faster
in directions perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal than parallel to c. It in-
dicates that the nucleation rates on the polar 0001 surfaces are extremely small.
The observed changes in the crystal morphology at the increased supercooling
of the solution, suggest that at higher supersaturations the nucleation on these
surfaces becomes very fast and its rate is very sensitive to changes of the growth
conditions. In this case, the nucleation is diﬃcult to control. In the applied con-
ﬁguration, where a set of crystals is growing simultaneously, it is impossible to
control precisely the conditions for a particular crystal or, moreover, for a par-
ticular face. The size of the crystals is limited by the available volume of the
uniform supersaturation zone in the high-pressure reactors in the temperature
gradient conﬁguration used up to now, for this kind of experiment. Therefore,
the crystal size is limited to 1–2 cm in their lateral dimension and to 0.1 mm in
their thickness. The only solution to enhance the growth on the {0001} surfaces
in a stable way is to apply methods of directional crystallization.
Figure 2.8 shows a scheme of the Multi Feed Seed conﬁguration used re-
cently (Bockowski et al., 2012) for directional crystallization of GaN by HNPS
method. Several (0001) oriented HVPE-GaN seeds are positioned in a vertical
Fig. 2.8. Scheme of the MFS conﬁguration; section of the crucible; the free
standing (0001) oriented HVPE-GaN substrates are positioned vertically; li-
quid gallium discs are between them; due to the temperature gradient applied
the bottom sides of HVPE-GaN crystals are dissolved in liquid gallium sup-
plying atomic nitrogen to the solution; nitrogen is then transported in the
liquid gallium by convection or diﬀusion to the underlying seed where the
crystallization takes place.

36
The homoepitaxial challenge
stack conﬁguration with liquid gallium between the seeds. Under high nitrogen
pressure (∼1 GPa) an axial temperature gradient is applied along the crucible.
The seeds are overgrown on their (0001) surface. They dissolve in liquid gallium
from their lower (0001) surface, supplying atomic nitrogen to the solution. The
nitrogen is transported to the underlying crystal. Each seed is overgrown and
dissolved at the same time, but at a slightly diﬀerent temperature varying from
1420◦C to 1450◦C.
A typical crystal grown in the MFS conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2.9. A
stable and macroscopically ﬂat crystallization is observed. The pits visible in the
material are situated on the bottom (nitrogen surface) of the seed crystal. No pits
are observed on the surface of the pressure-grown material. Two types of surface
morphology are noted; macrosteps and hillocks (see Fig. 2.9(b) and (c)). The
presence of these two modes of growth depends on the temperature gradient
applied. For a larger gradient, a growth rate of 5 μm/h can be obtained and
macrostep propagation is detected. In this case some voids and gallium inclusions
are observed in the crystals. In comparison, for a low-temperature gradient, the
density of voids and inclusions decreases from 103 cm−2 to 100 cm−2 and the
growth rate is reduced to not higher than 1 μm/h.
The deposition of HNPS-GaN layers and the dissolution of HVPE-GaN im-
prove the structural quality of the obtained crystals. A large improvement is
observed between HVPE-GaN and free-standing HNPS-GaN after removing the
residual HVPE-GaN from the nitrogen surface of the crystal. The absolute
value of the bowing radius can increase from 2 m to 30 m, since removing
the HVPE substrate helps to release stress in the HNPS-GaN. For 500 hours
of crystallization, one can obtain up to 500 μm thick of MFS-HNPS-GaN (see
Fig. 2.10).

diodes.
Laser diodes manufactured using MFS-HNPS-GaN (Sections 2.5–2.8) sub-
strates show a threshold voltage ∼4.5V@2.5kA/cm2, at emission wavelengths
from 390 nm to 440 nm and lifetimes exceeding 5000 hours. The average dislo-
cation density revealed by defect selective etching in the laser diode structures
does not exceed 5 × 106 cm−2. In turn, the average dislocation density for the
MFS-HNPS-GaN is about 1 × 106 cm−2. A “plasmonic” GaN substrate (Section
2.6), with a high free carrier concentration up to 1020 cm−3, can be grown at high
temperatures of 1440◦C. Dependence of free electron concentration in crystals

The homoepitaxial challenge
A “plasmonic” GaN substrate (Section 2.6) has the advantage of increasing
the refractive index contrast between substrate and epitaxial structure, sup-
pressing optical mode leakage into the substrate and optimizing the optical mode
distribution in the active region. This feature simpliﬁes the laser diode structure,
since otherwise a thick AlGaN layer or an AlGaN/GaN superlattice is required
to prevent light propagating from the active (MQW) region into the substrate.
Unfortunately, including aluminum increases the strain in the system and often
leads to macroscopic bowing, cracking, or misﬁt dislocations in the epistructure
(Gorczyca et al., 2010; Sarzynski et al., 2006).
Today the main disadvantage of the MFS conﬁguration is the slow growth
rate. It is planned to optimize the growth conditions by adding impurities such
as sodium or lithium to the solution in order to increase the nitrogen solubility
in gallium.
2.3.3
Ammonothermal growth of GaN
At present, the highest-quality real bulk crystals of GaN in terms of their struc-
tural properties and size are grown by ammonothermal method (Doradzinski
et al., 2010). The ammonothermal method is based on dissolution of GaN
in supercritical ammonia mediated by chemical reactions, with mineralizers
transferring GaN into highly soluble molecules. The mineralizers can be acidic
(NH+
4 ) or basic (NH−
2 ) in character, thus the ammonoacidic (Purdy, 1999) and
ammonobasic (Dwilinski et al., 1995) methods are distinguished. The most ad-
vanced results (Doradzinski et al., 2010) are achieved by the Polish company
Ammono S.A. using an ammonobasic approach at a pressure of 0.2–0.3 GPa and
temperature of 400–600◦C. In the ammonobasic system where pure alkali metals
or alkali metal amides (LiNH2, NaNH2, or KNH2) are used as mineralizers, GaN
nutrient (Fig. 2.12) is dissolved in supercritical NH3 by the formation of soluble
metal amide compounds according to the following reactions:
KNH2 + GaN + 2NH3 →KGa(NH2)4
(2.6)
2NaNH2 + GaN + 2NH3 →Na2Ga(NH2)5
(2.7)
The crystals are grown in retrograde solubility range (Fig. 2.13), therefore the
crystallization zone is hotter than the saturation one. It can lead to higher-purity
material because of the regular solubility character of most of the impurities in
the system. The solubility data shown in Fig. 2.13 indicate that solubility is an
increasing function of pressure, whereas it decreases with temperature.
The autoclaves for ammonothermal growth of GaN are constructed of nickel
superalloys characterized by excellent mechanical properties and high resistivity
against the ammonobasic environment. This is in contrast to the ammonoacidic
systems which require special noble metals liners arranged inside the reaction

chamber. Due to the low viscosity of supercritical ammonia solvent a very eﬃ-
cient mass transport by convection and high degree of supersaturation uniformity
in the crystallization zone can be achieved. Therefore, simultaneous use of many
seeds in large-volume chambers as well as perfect scalability with the size of
the autoclave has been achieved. At present, Ammono S.A. manufactures 1- and
1.5-inch GaN wafers and is on the road to start the production of 2-inch crystals.
Figure 2.14(a) shows a bulk GaN crystal grown by Ammono S.A. Such a crys-
tal can be sliced along polar {0001}, non-polar, and semipolar crystallographic
planes in order to obtain substrates of diﬀerent orientations for epitaxial growth.
One of the ﬁrst 2-inch crystals is shown in Fig. 2.14(b).
Ammono crystals are extremely ﬂat with bowing radii of the crystallographic
planes reaching up to 1000 m. Threading dislocation density is of the order of
104 cm−2 which is reﬂected in extremely narrow X-ray rocking curves being often
narrower than 20 arcsec for both symmetric and asymmetric reﬂections.
Electrical properties of the crystals can be controlled by doping during crys-
tallization process. The free electron concentration as high as 2 × 1019 cm−3
has been achieved which is very useful for construction of laser diodes. Native
defects in the Ammono-GaN crystals have been studied by positron annihila-
tion spectroscopy (Tuomisto et al., 2010). A high concentration of Ga vacancy
related defects in n-type crystals and no such defects in the p-type ones was
observed.
High-power laser devices fabricated on Ammono’s crystals have already been
reported (e.g. by another Polish company, TopGaN (Perlin et al., 2011b)) and
are discussed in the following parts of this chapter, especially in Sections 2.5
and 2.8.
It seems that the only drawback of the ammonothermal method are extremely
low crystallization rates, being as low as about 20 μm/day for the ⟨0001⟩direction
and even lower for the non-polar ones. This slows down development of the

method, especially at its seed-multiplication stage. However, on the other hand,
the multi-seed processes in large-volume autoclaves could compensate for this
disadvantage.
2.4
Epitaxy of nitrides on single-crystalline HNPS GaN:
early results
Homoepitaxy is the deposition of a thin layer of a crystalline material on the
crystalline substrate of the same material, having, therefore, exactly the same
crystal structure and thermal expansion coeﬃcients. If the substrate is perfect,
the homoepitaxial layer should also be a perfect crystal. To approach this res-
ult experimentally, a very good coupling between the substrate and the growing
layer is necessary. Technically it necessitates excellent preparation of the sub-
strate surface and the choice of the conditions of epitaxy, assuring growth of
the continuous layer with a ﬂat surface corresponding usually to one of low-
indices crystallographic planes of the grown material. Such a stable growth can
proceed by a two-dimensional layer by layer mechanism (mostly at low temper-
atures and/or on low indices exactly oriented surfaces) or by the atomic step
ﬂow (on surfaces vicinal to the low-indices ones). From the point of view of the
uniformity of the resultant layer, the step ﬂow growth mode is the optimum one,
because the incorporation of unintentional and intentional impurities is often
very sensitive to the microscopic situation on the growing surface. The growth
by propagation of an array of the well-determined steps should lead, therefore, to
the most uniform distribution of the impurities and minimization of the strains
in the homoepitaxial layer.
These obvious advantages of homoepitaxial growth of nitrides were demon-
strated with the use of pressure-grown HNPS-GaN platelets of extremely
low dislocation density. These results are discussed, e.g., in Grzegory and
Porowski (2002). In particular, it was shown that for proper surface prepar-
ation and optimized conditions of the epitaxial growth, the structure of GaN
homoepitaxial layers in terms of dislocation density, follows the structure of the
GaN substrates. Figure 2.15 compares surface morphology of GaN epitaxial lay-
ers deposited by MOCVD on a GaN crystal grown by HNPS (see Section 2.3.2)
and on GaN/sapphire substrate, in the same run (Leszczynski et al., 1999). The
atomic step ﬂow on the surface of the homoepitaxial layer is not perturbed as
observed for a GaN layer containing threading dislocations.
If a GaN homoepitaxial layer is near-dislocation-free, its optical properties
depend mostly on the concentration and distribution of point defects incorpor-
ated during the epitaxial growth. It is a function of the purity of the growth
system, the growth conditions, and the orientation of the substrate.
Due to the lack of strains and the high degree of homogeneity of the homoep-
itaxial GaN, the exciton related peaks in low-temperature PL spectra could be
extremely narrow. The FWHM of the bound exciton lines less than 0.5 meV
was observed for layers grown by both MOCVD (i.e. Stepniewski et al., 1999;

Kirchner et al., 1999) and MBE (i.e. Teisseyre et al., 1996; Grandjean et al., 2000)
on the Ga-polar surfaces of the HNPS-grown GaN substrates. For layers de-
posited on the N-polar surfaces the spectra were usually much wider due to
the enhanced and non-uniform incorporation of unintentional impurities on this
chemically active side of the GaN crystal. This was suppressed by the use of
surfaces vicinal to the (0001) plane, as was shown by Zauner et al. (2000), who
obtained narrow excitonic spectra for GaN layers grown on misoriented N-polar
surfaces of the GaN pressure-grown substrates.
For GaN layers grown by MBE with NH3 nitrogen source it was shown
(Grandjean et al., 2000) that the band edge PL integrated intensity at RT
for the homoepitaxial GaN was about 60 times larger than for GaN grown on
sapphire with the same growth conditions. Also, the decay of the PL in these
homoepitaxial layers was much slower than for corresponding (grown in similar
conditions) heteroepitaxial GaN. This indicated a substantial suppression of the
non-radiative recombination by elimination of threading dislocations from the
layers.
The PL decay has also been studied at high excitations (Jursenas et al., 2001)
for GaN layers grown by MOCVD on sapphire and pressure-grown GaN sub-
strates. The decay time (at RT) of 450 ps measured for homoepitaxial material
was ﬁve times longer than for corresponding heteroepitaxial layers grown in the
same conditions.
The optically pumped LT stimulated emission (Holst et al.) experiments con-
ﬁrmed that the near-dislocation-free GaN is a much more eﬃcient source of light
than GaN containing dislocations. The stimulated emission in a GaN homoep-
itaxial layer grown by MOCVD started at the excitation power density lower

than 1 MW/cm2, whereas for GaN grown on SiC only at 10 MW/cm2. The
stimulated emission peak for the homoepitaxial layer was as narrow as about
5 meV (about 40 meV for GaN/SiC).
The growth of GaN/AlGaN structures on GaN pressure-grown crystals has
been studied mainly by MBE (Christiansen et al., 1999; Foxon et al., 1999;
Frayssinet et al., 2000). Near-dislocation-free GaN/AlGaN multi-quantum wells
and structures have been grown on the N-polar surfaces of GaN crystals by RF
plasma-assisted MBE (PA MBE) (Christiansen et al., 1999; Foxon et al., 1999)
and on the Ga-polar surfaces by MBE with NH3 nitrogen source (R MBE)
(Grandjean et al., 2000; Frayssinet et al., 2000). As a rule, the optical prop-
erties of the structures without dislocations were much better than for similar
structures grown in the same conditions, on sapphire. For example, the integ-
rated intensities of the PL coming from similar structures (8 ML GaN SQW
with the Al0.1Ga0.9N 50 nm barriers) grown by R MBE (Grandjean et al., 2000)
on sapphire and bulk pressure-grown GaN substrates were compared. It was
shown that for the structure deposited on GaN, the PL was much stronger,
especially at RT. For the structure grown on GaN substrate, the PL intens-
ity started to decrease with temperature only at about 100 K, due mainly
to the thermal escape of carriers from the quantum well towards the AlGaN
barriers, as was observed for classical III-V QW heterostructures with disloca-
tions densities lower than 103 cm−2 (Lambkin et al., 1990). For heteroepitaxial
structure, the presence of dislocations strongly inﬂuenced the non-radiative re-
combination processes. The PL intensity started to decrease at much lower
temperatures due to delocalization of excitons and their further interaction with
dislocations.
Dislocations in the structures grown on the almost defect-free substrates can
obviously appear as a result of the lattice mismatch between GaN and its tern-
aries InGaN and AlGaN. This was analyzed by Leszczynski et al. (2001) by
X-ray measurements of lattice parameters of various GaN-based epitaxial layers
deposited on GaN substrates as a function of InGaN (AlGaN) composition and
thickness. It was shown that the boundary between fully strained and relaxed
InGaN (AlGaN) layers is at a safe distance from the mismatch–thickness area
for layers necessary for a typical blue laser structure.
As already mentioned in the introduction, strongly n-type pressure-grown
GaN crystals have been tested by Nakamura (1999) as substrate for the InGaN
405 nm laser. The cw 30 mW devices with a lifetime exceeding 3000 h were
constructed based on epitaxial structures grown by MOCVD. The 30 mW power
has been achieved at a current of 62 mA. For typical InGaN MQW LDs, at a
current of 62 mA, the output power was about 15 mW. This increase in the
eﬃciency conﬁrmed that dislocations were the main limiting factors for high-
power GaN-based lasers.
As appeared later, the pressure-grown GaN substrates were especially im-
portant for development of epitaxial growth of quantum nitride structures by
Plasma Assisted MBE. Section 2.5 is devoted to this issue.

The homoepitaxial challenge

Development of nitrides epitaxy by PA MBE
The growth of structures discussed here was performed in a customized V90
Riber MBE reactor equipped with two Veeco RF plasma sources, operating at
240–450 W for 0.8–2 sccm of N2 ﬂow. The pressure during the growth was
1.5–7 × 10−5 Torr. The value of the active nitrogen ﬂux was in the range of
4–13 nm/min. This was quantiﬁed by growing GaN in Ga-rich conditions. Three
types of substrate were used for the growth from:
(i) High nitrogen pressure solution (HNPS), HNPS-GaN.
(ii) Ammonothermal growth, Ammono-GaN.
(iii) Hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), HVPE-GaN.
The epi-ready, bulk (0001) substrates, with miscut of about 0.5 degree with
respect to c-polar plane, were prepared in a two-step procedure consisting of
mechanical and chemo-mechanical polishing. All layers discussed in this section
were grown on the (0001) Ga-polarity surface.
2.5.1
Growth conditions for PAMBE
The analysis of experimental data for GaAs or Si indicates that the optimum
growth temperature for two-dimensional step-ﬂow mode equals about half the
melting temperature, TM (Burton et al., 1951; Ishizaka and Murata, 1994). This
rule is also valid for GaN growth, where the GaN melting point lies somewhere
between 2540 K (experimentally determined for 6 GPa by Utsumi et al., 2003)
and 2800 K (theoretically calculated i.e. Van Vechten, 1973), and the optimum
growth temperature used in MOVPE is in the range 1050–1100◦C (1320–1370 K).
On a microscopic scale, at T = 0.5 TM atomic kinks start to become active;
i.e. atoms can detach from an atomic kink (Burton et al., 1951; Ishizaka and
Murata, 1994) at a rate comparable to typical attachment rates during depos-
ition. This rule is strict for Kossel crystal and is also fulﬁlled for real crystal
structures.
The diﬃculty for GaN growth in MBE is that for temperature 0.5 TM =
1320 K, a high nitrogen overpressure (about 60 bars for N2) is required to prevent
GaN decomposition (Karpinski and Porowski, 1984; Karpinski et al., 1984). For
more chemically active N precursors, such as ammonia, the situation is better,
but still an overpressure in the range of 0.1–2 bar must be used. Such overpres-
sures are not compatible with MBE technology, which relies on high vacuum
conditions for the delivery of atoms from the eﬀusion cells to the growing layer.
In fact, for typical MBE growth conditions GaN begins to decompose at
temperatures in excess of 800◦C, restricting the epitaxy to temperatures much
below the optimum point. Indeed, due to the arguments given above and the
low diﬀusivity of N adatoms, the early eﬀorts to grow GaN in MBE at tem-
peratures below 800◦C, using group V-rich conditions typical for III–V epitaxy,
gave unsatisfactory results. These early diﬃculties, seemingly well grounded in
the simple thermodynamics of the processes involved, led many to believe that

45
the only path for successful growth of nitrides in MBE reactors is to push the
growth conditions as close as possible to those present in MOVPE reactors.
The breakthrough in the study of growth kinetics in PAMBE came with
the ﬁnding that in Ga rich conditions it is possible to grow relatively smooth
layers at low growth temperatures (Elsass et al., 1999; Heying et al., 2000;
Heying et al., 1999; Adelmann et al., 2002; Manfra et al., 2004; Skierbiszewski
et al., 2004). However, such growth conditions were prone to the formation of
Ga droplets on the GaN surface, and high-quality material was mainly formed in
the regions between the droplets. Further study of the Ga auto-surfactant eﬀect
revealed that this problem could be avoided provided the Ga:N ﬂux ratio was
maintained in a very narrow range of values—low enough to be just below the
formation of the droplets, but high enough to ensure the formation of a metallic
Ga bilayer on the Ga polarity surface (Elsass et al., 1999; Heying et al., 2000;
Heying et al., 1999; Adelmann et al., 2002; Manfra et al., 2004; Skierbiszewski
et al., 2004).
This apparent conundrum of ﬁnding two-dimensional step-ﬂow growth at tem-
peratures signiﬁcantly lower than 0.5 TM can be resolved by considering that the
decomposition of GaN (and therefore the activity of atomic kinks) is controlled
by a kinetic barrier. Schoonmaker et al. (1965) demonstrated more than 40 years
ago that the height of this barrier is strongly reduced when GaN is covered by
liquid Ga or In. It was also experimentally evidenced and discussed by Groh
et al. (1974) and Newman (1997) that, for a given temperature, the presence of
a metal layer on a GaN surface accelerates etching of GaN in comparison to the
exposed surface. Therefore, in the metal-rich regime for PAMBE (we can call it
liquid phase epitaxy-like conditions) the formation energies of the kink sites are
reduced, substantially lowering the minimum growth temperature necessary to
sustain the desired two-dimensional step-ﬂow growth mode.
Another important process necessary for high-quality growth at low temperat-
ure, which has also been a subject of intensive theoretical studies, is the adatom
diﬀusivity. Perhaps the most insightful were results of modeling based on the
density-functional theory which pointed towards the existence of a very eﬃcient
lateral diﬀusion channel for nitrogen adatoms on a semiconductor surface just be-
low the thin metallic ﬁlm (Neugebauer et al., 2003). Surprisingly small activation
energies for this so-called adlayer enhanced lateral diﬀusion (AELD) facilitate
high-quality step-ﬂow epitaxy at low temperatures. This enhanced surface mo-
bility of nitrogen adatoms, coupled with the reduction in the kink formation
energy discussed earlier, promotes two-dimensional growth nucleation and step-
ﬂow growth at temperatures far below those needed for “classical” group V-rich
conditions.
The importance of the two mechanisms described above—i.e. kink activity
and adatoms mobility—is well illustrated by quite recent results demonstrat-
ing that high-quality GaN can be grown with PAMBE under “classical” N-rich
conditions, in the absence of a metallic layer on the surface, provided that the
growth temperature is high enough to cause concurrent decomposition of GaN

46
The homoepitaxial challenge
(Koblmuller et al., 2007). It should be emphasized nevertheless that such growth
conditions are not suitable for the epitaxy of InGaN because of the prohibitively
high evaporation rate of In, and are likely to have only limited use for the epi-
taxy of AlGaN, because of the pinning of the atomic step kinks on Al atoms (due
to much higher AlN bond energy) and too-low Al atoms surface mobility. Still,
such growth conditions provide a very useful alternative for PAMBE growth of
high-quality GaN without the danger of Ga droplet formation.
2.5.2
The role of threading dislocations and miscut angle on surface
morphology in low-temperature PAMBE
It was found that for PAMBE, in the group III metal-rich regime, spiral growth
is always present on substrates containing a high density of threading disloca-
tions (TDs) (Heying et al., 1999). Such morphological features are located at
the intersection of a TDs with the crystal surface, and are formed in all crys-
tal growth processes proceeding through two-dimensional nucleation (Swendsen
et al., 1976). It is important to realize that such spiral growth leads to the forma-
tion of hillocks whose steepness increases monotonically with increasing tightness
of the spiral. In Fig. 2.16 we present a comparison of the surface morphology of
InGaN layers grown by PAMBE on GaN/sapphire templates and on GaN bulk
crystals grown by the high nitrogen pressure solution growth technique (TDs
density <100 cm−2). Nearly straight and parallel atomic steps are present on
InGaN layers grown on a bulk substrate, while a dislocation mediated step-ﬂow
growth mode is observed on the GaN/sapphire substrate.
From our experience, at temperatures higher than 710◦C PAMBE growth on
high-dislocation-density GaN/sapphire substrates results in nearly ﬂat surfaces
(hillocks height below 2 nm). However, as the growth temperature decreases,
the tightness of the spirals and thus the height of the hillocks increases rapidly.

Development of nitrides epitaxy by PA MBE
47
Indeed, at temperatures around 600◦C (where InGaN layers are typically grown),
hillock heights can exceed 7 nm. As a consequence of the non-uniform dislocation
distribution in the substrate, the hillock diameters and sidewall inclinations vary
substantially across the surface. Such local disorder on the surface acts as a seed
for “catastrophic” degradation of epitaxial layers, particularly when the layers
exceed the critical thickness. Thus, low-dislocation substrates should enable the
growth of metastable layers, allowing the system to “supercool” considerably
before various undesirable crystallographic and morphological transitions are
triggered (e.g., inversion domains, InN precipitates, Mg precipitates, dislocation
clusters, etc.). Importantly, even though metastable, such layers can be extremely
robust once grown, due to the very high melting temperatures for GaN and
related compounds. As a consequence of the GaN wurzite symmetry, growth pro-
cesses are highly anisotropic, impacting on atomic step morphology. In Fig. 2.17
we present a comparison of the morphology of InGaN layers grown under
identical conditions on two bulk GaN substrates having diﬀerent miscut orienta-
tion: towards [1100] (Fig. 2.17(a)) and [1120] (Fig. 2.17(b)) directions. For miscut
towards [1100] we observe nearly straight parallel atomic steps, while for [1120]
the atomic steps are considerably more disordered, showing step meandering,
e.g. atomic steps with a characteristic zigzag shape (Shen et al., 2007).
2.5.3
The growth of high-In-content InGaN layers by PAMBE
For PAMBE the highest-quality InGaN structures on c-plane (0001) surface are
grown in the In-rich growth regime (Neugebauer et al., 2003; Skierbiszewski
et al., 2009; Riechert et al., 1996; Siekacz et al., 2008; Siekacz et al., 2009).

PAMBE on bulk GaN substrates with miscut orientation towards [1100]

48
The homoepitaxial challenge
It was already demonstrated (Riechert et al., 1996; Siekacz et al., 2008) that
the decrease in the growth temperature TG, by reducing the decomposition of
the InN-fraction, can be used eﬀectively to increase In content in the layers.
However, reduction of TG can deteriorate the layer quality due to the reduction
of surface adatom mobility. Therefore, we propose an alternative path to achieve
high-In-content layers—by increase of the nitrogen ﬂux, which can improve InN
stability at higher temperatures. In Fig. 2.18 we demonstrate the dependence of
the indium content for 40-nm thick InGaN layers as a function of the substrate
temperature at ﬁxed gallium ﬂux, ΦGa = 2.63 nm/min, for two nitrogen ﬂuxes
ΦN, equal to 4.1 and 6.5 nm/min. The indium content x was determined after
the growth, using XRD reciprocal space mapping (Siekacz et al., 2008).
The expected decrease of the indium content for constant N ﬂux with in-
creasing growth temperatures is clearly seen. Importantly, for higher N ﬂux we
obtained higher In content for a given growth temperature. The decrease of the In
content for higher growth temperatures is explained by temperature-activated
dissociation of In-N bonds, which leads to the nitrogen loss from the growing
layer.
In order to investigate the inﬂuence of N ﬂux on indium incorporation and
the possibility of achieving long-wavelength emission, we have grown a series
of 2.2-nm single quantum well (SQW) structures with varying N ﬂux, using a
constant growth temperature and Ga ﬂux. The structures were grown on HVPE
(0001) GaN crystals. After the 100-nm GaN buﬀer layer, the 20 nm In0.06Ga0.94N
barriers with 2.2 nm InxGa1−xN well were grown. In Fig. 2.19(a) we present
the PL results from these samples. Increasing the N ﬂux from 5.5 nm/min to
12.5 nm/min we were able to shift the PL from 460 nm up to 540 nm, i.e. from
blue to green emission wavelength. This result show that change of the N ﬂux

is a very eﬀective method for tuning the light emission wavelength of InGaN
QWs grown by PAMBE. As we will demonstrate later, it will be a key factor in
achieving green laser action. We used the measured PL energies to estimate the In
content in these structures. For that we calculated the expected transition energy
from SQW, solving the Schr¨odinger equation in both conduction and valence
bands, following the procedure described in Christmas et al. (2005). The results
of these calculations are presented in Fig. 2.19, and indicate that by doubling
the nitrogen ﬂux we were able to change the In content from approximately 18%
to 28% in SQW.
The most important practical message from our experiments is that we can
increase the In content at a given growth temperature, increasing the nitrogen
ﬂux. As presented in the next Section, the growth of InGaN with high ΦN is also
beneﬁcial for the optical quality of grown layers.
2.5.4
The inﬂuence of the growth conditions on the optical properties
of InGaN QWs
Homogeneous InGaN QWs with a low concentration of dislocations and point
defects have to be grown for the achievement of long-wavelength lasing. As we
demonstrated, the increase of the In content in InGaN layers can be realized by

50
The homoepitaxial challenge
i) reduction of the growth temperature or ii) increase of the N ﬂux. The ﬁrst
approach is eﬀective in increasing the In content, but at low growth temperat-
ures the optical quality of the InGaN is dramatically deteriorated, as illustrated
by a strong drop in LED eﬃciency (Siekacz et al., 2009). Here we examined
whether an increase of N ﬂux provides a better alternative to decreasing growth
temperature for the production of InGaN structures with an optical quality suﬃ-
cient to sustain laser action at longer wavelengths. For LD development we need
to minimize localization potentials and non-radiative recombination processes
in QWs. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy is an ideal tool
for monitoring both of these parasitic eﬀects.
The TRPL experiments provide information on the carrier dynamics dur-
ing and after their pulse laser excitation. The observed PL decay time, τP L,
depends on the radiative (τR) and non-radiative (τN) recombination times
(τ −1
P L = τ −1
R
+ τ −1
N ). For a perfect QW (i.e., a sample without point defects, etc.)
the τ −1
P L is determined by the characteristics of the QW conﬁning potential and
only weakly changes with temperature (for this situation, τP L = τR). For practic-
ally attainable QWs the factor τ −1
N
cannot be neglected because of the presence
of non-radiative recombination centers, such as point defects or dislocations. The
τN is known to decrease with increasing temperature, and as a result, at room
temperature, τP L is strongly reduced for poor-quality QWs. This means that
the role of non-radiative recombination centers in InGaN QWs can be compared
eﬀectively by measuring the τP L for QWs at room temperature. In order to per-
form such a comparison, TRPL in InGaN QWs deposited using diﬀerent growth
parameters was measured at nominally identical conditions. The samples were
excited by a 350-nm laser line with a 76 MHz repetition rate and a pulse dura-
tion of 150 fs from a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser. In order to observe eﬀects
associated with point defects, measurements were performed at low excitation
conditions (the average excitation power was a few mW). The PL signal was
dispersed by a 0.3-m focal length monochromator and detected by a Si streak
camera.
In Fig. 2.20 we plot as an example the decay of PL intensity at 425 nm for
one of our samples, together with the laser pulse temporal proﬁle. The τP L has
been obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data with a one-exponential decay of
PL signal. The τP L determined in such a way are plotted in Fig. 2.21, together
with the PL spectrum taken just after the excitation.
As we pointed out, by decreasing the growth temperature we can shift the PL
from 420 nm (see Fig. 2.21(a), sample A) to 520 nm (Fig. 2.21(b), sample B) for
the constant nitrogen ﬂux of 4.1 nm/min. For sample A we observe no spectral
dispersion of τP L = 0.8 ns. Such a behaviour of τP L is typical of homogeneous
QWs, i.e., QWs where the carrier localization induced by indium content ﬂuc-
tuations can be neglected. For sample B, the PL decay time is qualitatively
diﬀerent, and τP L increases from 3 ns at λ = 485 nm to 13 ns at λ = 570 nm.
Such a spectral dispersion of τP L implies carrier localizations in this QW, and
can be attributed to indium content ﬂuctuations. In general, it is expected that

such a localization can eﬀectively reduce the inﬂuence of non-radiative recombin-
ation channels, but on the other hand it is much harder to obtain the population
inversion necessary for lasing in such a system. Therefore, the spectral dispersion
of τP L can be used as a ﬁngerprint of carrier localization, giving valuable feed-
back for optimizing InGaN QWs growth procedure. As we have already shown,
when we increased the N ﬂux we were able to grow InGaN QWs with the same
In content (around 26%) at higher growth temperature, as indicated by PL (see
Fig. 2.21(c), sample C). For this sample the TRPL measurements show no spec-
tral dispersion of τP L. This indicates that samples A and C are comparable
from the viewpoint of carrier localization. Note that sample A has considerably
lower In content in QW: 12%. In addition to the homogeneity improvement,
the increased nitrogen ﬂux probably contributes to the reduction in the number
of non-radiative recombination centers in the layers by reducing the number of

nitrogen vacancies. Such a possibility is supported by the observed increase in
the absolute value of τP L for the sample shown in Fig. 2.21(c) in comparison to
that in Fig. 2.21(a). Since at room temperature τP L is expected to be domin-
ated by a non-radiative recombination component τN, this increase is not likely
to be caused by the larger built-in electric ﬁeld for the high-In-content QWs of
sample C and the related decrease in the oscillator strength for this transition.
2.5.5
Optical lasing from InGaN QWs
The laser structures for optical pumping were grown on HVPE bulk substrates
with a dislocation density 106–107 cm−2. The structures consist of 0.5-μm
Al0.08Ga0.92N bottom cladding followed by a 400-nm GaN waveguide. The active
region located in the middle of the waveguide consists of one or three InxGa1−xN
QW with a thickness from 2.2 nm to 3.5 nm and 10 nm In0.06Ga0.94N barriers.
The upper Al0.08Ga0.92N cladding have a thickness of 0.3 μm, and structures
were capped by 5-nm GaN layer. The optical lasing was obtained from cleaved
laser stripes with length L = 0.4–1.2 mm excited by third harmonics (355 nm)
of a Nd:YAG laser beam with an aperture size of 0.25 mm; see inset to Fig. 2.22
for experimental conﬁguration details. The laser pulses had a duration of 5 ns
and a repetition rate of 20 Hz.
In Fig. 2.22 we compare optical spectra below and above the lasing threshold
for two structures, with QWs optimized for an emission around 420 nm and
495 nm. We achieved optically pumped lasing from these structures at 409 nm
and 472 nm, respectively. The structure which lased at 409 nm was grown with
N ﬂux 4.1 nm/min, and that lasing at 472 nm with higher N ﬂux 6.5 nm/min,
using otherwise nominally identical growth conditions. The lasing emission in-
tensity as a function of the pumping power is shown in Fig. 2.23. It is clear that

we are able to achieve lasing at 409 nm much earlier than at 472 nm. Although
better optical eﬃciency of QW for the 409-nm laser cannot be ruled out, we
attribute this eﬀect primarily to the superior light conﬁnement in the waveguide
at a shorter wavelength (same design for both lasers).
The largest available active nitrogen ﬂux for the nitrogen plasma source ini-
tially mounted on our MBE system was 6.5 nm/min, suﬃcient to grow the
structure lasing at 472 nm. After upgrading the MBE system with a second
RF-plasma source, the maximum nitrogen ﬂux of 14 nm/min became avail-
able. This allowed us to further shift the PL emission towards the green region
while maintaining a high-growth temperature of InGaN. In Fig. 2.24 we demon-
strate spontaneous and stimulated emission from two SQW laser structures with
quantum well widths of 2.2 nm and 3.5 nm, respectively. The growth conditions
for both structures were nominally identical, and other than QW thickness the
design was the same, with the active region consisting of 10 nm InGaN barri-
ers containing 6% In and SQW with an In content of about 25%. As seen in
Fig. 2.24, the maximum of the spontaneous emission is at a longer wavelength
for the structure with wider QW: 545 nm vs. 525 nm. We attribute this shift to
the stronger QCSE expected for the wider well. Note that for each laser struc-
ture we show stimulated emission from two laser bars of diﬀerent length, and
in both cases the stimulated emission from longer bar is red-shifted compared
to that from the shorter bar. We were able to shift stimulated emission from
487 nm to 494 nm for the laser structure with the well width d = 2.2 nm,
and from 488 nm to 501 nm for the one with the well width d = 3.5 nm, by
increasing the laser bar length from 0.7 nm to 1.2 nm for both cases. This ef-
fect is very general. Indeed, for all the investigated laser structures we have
found that lasing at longer wavelengths can be realized with a longer resonator
length L.

Laser diodes
Laser diode structures were grown on (0001) Ga-polarity, conductive GaN sub-
strates with low dislocation density 103–104 cm−3 (HPNS-GaN, Ammono-GaN),
and with a dislocation density of 106–107 cm−2 (HVPE-GaN). For the laser di-
odes (LDs) operating at 405–420 nm, we used the structure shown in Fig. 2.25
(Skierbiszewski et al., 2005).
The 40-nm GaN:Si buﬀer layer and 450-nm Al0.08Ga0.92N:Si cladding were
grown under Ga-rich conditions at 720◦C. The bottom waveguide, MQWs, EBL,
top waveguide, top cladding, and contact layer were grown in In-rich conditions
at 650◦C. The active region consisted of three 3-nm In0.1Ga0.9N wells with 7-nm
In0.02Ga0.98N barriers. The devices were processed as ridge-waveguide, oxide-
isolated lasers. The mesa structures were etched to a depth of 0.3 μm. The
20-μm-wide and 500-μm-long stripes were used as laser resonators. The oxid-
ized Ni/Au ohmic contacts were deposited on the top surface of the devices,
and Ti/Au contacts were deposited on the backside of the highly conducting
n-GaN substrate crystal. The cleaved laser mirror facets were coated with sym-
metrically reﬂecting mirrors. Figure 2.26(a) shows the light current voltage (LIV)
characteristics of the CW LDs with lasing threshold current density and voltage

of 5.5 kA/cm2 and 5.7 V, respectively. Lasing was observed up to 60 mW of
optical output power (30 mW per facet) at a wavelength of 411 nm, as indicated
in Fig. 2.26(b) (Skierbiszewski et al., 2006). This conﬁrms that growth of high-
quality layers by PAMBE has been achieved; the smooth interfaces required for
LDs can be obtained as shown in Fig. 2.25(a).
The optically pumped stimulated emission at 501 nm was a good starting
point for true blue and green laser diodes. It is worth stressing here that not

only eﬃcient QWs are essential for LDs, but also such design of the LDs en-
suring conﬁnement of the optical modes inside the laser waveguide. For the LDs
operating at wavelengths longer than 430 nm, we found that the crucial factor for
achieving lasing is optimization of the claddings and the waveguide. The details
of a single quantum well (SQW) LDs structure lasing at 455 nm are presen-
ted in Fig. 2.27 (Skierbiszewski et al., 2012b). In order to reduce penetration
of the optical modes into the GaN substrate we have grown special claddings
comprised of 2-μm heavily doped GaN:Si at the level of 7 × 1019 cm−3 and 4 μm
GaN/Al0.05Ga0.95N superlattice. For further localization of the optical modes in-
side the waveguide, and to reduce losses in the gold p-type contact, we also used
an “optical conﬁnement layer” (OCL), 80 nm of In0.07Ga0.93N, and changed the
upper cladding from InGaN/InAlGaN to GaN/AlGaN. As arises from theoretical
calculations, the new claddings and waveguide with OCL helped signiﬁcantly (i)
to decrease absorption of the optical modes in the upper gold contact, and (ii) to
reduce penetration of the optical modes to the GaN HVPE substrate. The other
interesting feature of SQW LDs grown by PAMBE is a relatively small blue shift
from spontaneous (at 465 nm) to lasing emission (at 455 nm); Fig. 2.28(b). This
is achieved by employing OCL and staggered SQWs which reduce piezoelectric
ﬁelds inside SQW.
We also introduced a new design of AlGaN-claddings-free separate conﬁne-
ment heterostructure (SCH) LDs grown by PAMBE, and demonstrated LDs
operation from 435 nm to 460 nm (Skierbiszewski et al., 2012a). The LD struc-
ture details are shown in Fig. 2.29. The 0.5-μm GaN:Si buﬀer layer is followed
by undoped 0.3-μm GaN. Next, the asymmetric high-indium-content undoped

“Plasmonic” GaN substrates and their use for lasers
As we have shown earlier (Section 2.3), the crystals of GaN grown by the HNPS
method can be strongly n-type doped with free electron concentration as high as
1019–1020 cm−3, depending on growth temperature. This can be used as an ele-
ment of the refractive index engineering in InGaN-based laser diodes (i.e. Perlin
et al., 2009; Perlin et al., 2011a; Perlin et al., 2012) to achieve eﬃcient trans-
versal conﬁnement of the optical mode. Typically, in nitride-based LDs a wider
band gap AlGaN alloys are used as cladding layers providing optical conﬁnement.
However in contrast to the lattice-matched GaAs-AlGaAs system, the lattice mis-
match between the GaN waveguide and AlGaN cladding makes the AlGaN layer
suﬀer from tensile strain which leads to its cracking and generation of defects.
Additionally, the refractive index contrast between GaN and AlGaN decreases
with emission wavelength. This limits the possibility of creating a suﬃciently
strong optical conﬁnement in the device, and causes a signiﬁcant leakage of the
optical mode to the substrate (Smolyakov et al., 2005; Laino et al., 2007), increas-
ing the internal losses in the laser, especially for longer wavelengths. To suppress
the mode leakage the AlGaN claddings as thick as 2 μm (Laino et al., 2007) or
even 5 μm (Nagahama et al., 2000) are used.

The eﬀect of mode penetration into the substrate is sometimes visualized
by the formation of a carbon deposit (Package Induced Failure) being the res-
ult of light-induced reactions on the facet of the laser. This eﬀect is shown in
Fig. 2.31(a).
Perlin et al. (2009, 2011a, 2012) have shown that the use of a highly con-
ductive HNPS GaN substrate allows suppressing the mode leakage completely
in laser diodes with AlGaN lower cladding as thin as 0.5–0.8 μm. This was pos-
sible because of a signiﬁcant decrease of dielectric constant, and consequently a
reduction of the refractive index of GaN at frequencies closer to the plasma fre-
quency. This dependence can be well described by the following equation (Perlin
et al., 1995):

Figure 2.32 shows the dependence of refractive index contrast between strongly
n-type and undoped GaN on the wavelength for various electron concentrations.
For the blue spectral range (450 nm) the refractive index contrast reaches 0.5%
for an electron concentration of 5 × 1019 cm−3 and 1% for 1 × 1020 cm−3. This
provides the possibility of constructing the laser diode using such a type of
substrate as a part of its optical waveguide.

It is clear that the refractive index contrast induced by free electrons at a con-

mode to the substrate in contrast to the conventional HVPE-grown substrate
with an electron concentration of 1018 cm−3.

structure the optical mode extends deep into the substrate, while in the case of
the plasmonic substrate the mode is well conﬁned around the active area.
An important and quite obvious eﬀect is a signiﬁcant reduction in the
threshold current density. For considered cases it was from 5.2 kA/cm2 to
2.3 kA/cm2 (Perlin et al., 2009).
The threshold current density of the laser structure with an AlGaN cladding
of thickness 0.5 μm has been simulated (Perlin et al., 2012) as a dependence on
the refractive index contrast of the substrate compared to the undoped GaN. For
around 0.5% the threshold current density suddenly dropped. This 0.5% index
change corresponds roughly to the electron concentration of 5 × 1019 cm−3, in
agreement with the results mentioned previously.
It is therefore shown that the concept of using plasmonic substrates is a way
of improving and simplifying the design of blue and green InGaN laser diodes.
It can help to design optimum laser structures with minimized strain, and can
fully proﬁt from the advantages provided by plasmonic substrates.

Laser diode arrays on laterally patterned substrates
2.7.1
Background
In spite of the growing popularity of semipolar and non-polar substrate ori-
entations, most of the III-nitride optoelectronic devices are still grown on
polar c-plane GaN templates or free-standing GaN substrates. The predominant
growth technique is metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). In the case
of MOVPE, good morphology and chemical uniformity of AlInGaN layers are
obtained only in the step-ﬂow growth mode, on vicinal surfaces. On such vicinal

62
The homoepitaxial challenge
surfaces we can distinguish atomic steps, separated by atomically ﬂat terraces.
By the vicinal angle δ, we understand the angle between the GaN c-plane and
its real surface, also termed as oﬀ-cut, oﬀ-orientation, miscut, oﬀ-axis, or misor-
ientation angle. Let h be the atomic step height and w the atomic terrace width.
Then we have tan δ = h/w. Good morphology of epitaxial layers can be obtained
only for δ in a certain range, which for GaN grown by MOVPE is between 0.3
and about 1◦.
For 0 < δ < 0.2◦the step-ﬂow growth mode with parallel and well-ordered
atomic steps by MOVPE is not possible because of the lack of an eﬀective and
well-determined source of atomic steps. During growth on exact-oriented subst-
rates the atomic steps tend to ﬂow around the dislocations which are always
present, at surface densities of 104–107 cm−3 for free-standing GaN, and
108–109 cm−3 for GaN templates on foreign substrates. As a result, for MOVPE
layers grown on exact oriented substrates the density and direction of atomic
steps become random. For δ > 0.2◦the density and direction of the atomic steps
are uniform.
For GaN/sapphire and GaN/SiC templates used mostly for light-emitting di-
ode and transistor fabrication, the vicinal angle of the GaN epilayer is determined
by the miscut angle of the foreign substrate.
In the case of free-standing GaN (made by HVPE, HNPS or ammonothermal
methods) used for the production of laser diodes, the desired vicinal angle
is realized by polishing the substrate to high precision. Polishing causes,
however, a signiﬁcant loss of the material. This becomes an issue in view of
the increasing size of free-standing GaN substrates and their still high price.
Starting from exact c-plane-oriented 2-inch GaN wafer it requires as much as
440 μm (51.2 mm × tan(0.5 degree)) of material per side to be polished oﬀ
to reach 0.5 degree miscut. Therefore, a 300-μm thick 0.5-degree miscut GaN
substrate requires initially at least a 1200-μm thick GaN crystal, which accounts
for a 25% yield only.
For the step ﬂow growth mode, at a given vertical growth rate, v, we can
deﬁne the lateral velocity of the atomic steps, s:
s =
v
sin δ
(2.10)
According to eq. (2.10), the surface atomic steps during epitaxial growth move
faster for smaller δ. It is well known that for increasing δ, the amount of indium
incorporated into InGaN layers grown by MOVPE in the step-ﬂow mode, at ﬁxed
pressure, temperature, and In precursor ﬂow, decreases (Tachibana et al., 2008;
Keller et al., 2008; Leszczynski et al., 2011). This eﬀect is shown in Fig. 2.35.
Although all experimental results obtained so far conﬁrm the eﬀect described
above, they are focused on how indium content depends on δ, without paying
attention to whether the substrate miscut was chosen towards the a or m axis.
This issue certainly requires more study, but the ﬁrst results show that indium
content is not sensitive to the azimuth of substrate miscut; see Fig. 2.35(b).

Room-temperature PL wavelength of a InGaN/GaN MQW structure grown

The precise control of the quantum-well chemical composition is the key factor
in the fabrication of all InGaN-based optoelectronic devices. The band gap and
hence the emitted wavelength depends on indium content of QWs, and there-
fore in the planar light-emitting diodes and laser diodes technology it is very
important that the vicinal angle is uniformly constant across the substrate.
Concerning the physics of diﬀerent indium incorporations on diﬀerently
angled surfaces, there are two models present in the literature:
i) Indium is incorporated on the atomic terraces at a constant rate and is
not incorporated on the atomic steps (Krysko et al., 2007). For larger δ,
according to Nakamura and Chichibu (2000), we have a higher density of
atomic steps (narrower terraces) and therefore less indium. In this model
the indium content should not depend on v for a substrate of a given δ.
ii) Indium incorporation depends on s, because to avoid thermal desorption
the indium adatom has to be quickly surrounded by the neighboring gal-
lium adatoms (Keller et al., 2008). In this model, the indium incorporation
should increase for smaller δ and constant v and also increase for larger v
and constant δ.
Based on Leszczynski et al. (2011), for a 50-nm InGaN layer grown on an ho-
mogeneous GaN substrates at 820◦C and reactor pressure of 300 mbar at
v = 0.7 ˚A/s, the indium content increased from 8% to 13% for δ decreasing
from 1.8 to 0.3◦. For the same growth temperature and pressure, and δ = 1◦the
indium content increased from 7% to 12% for v increasing from 0.35 to 1.0 ˚A/s.

64
The homoepitaxial challenge
Therefore, it should be concluded that for the step-ﬂow growth mode of InGaN
by MOVPE, model ii) is more likely.
2.7.2
Laser diode arrays on laterally patterned HNPS GaN substrates
Basing on the ﬁndings above we used patterned freestanding GaN for fabrication
of monolithic LDs emitting light at diﬀerent wavelengths. We will mention three
applications of such multi-color LDs:
i) Two-wavelength interferometry with the advantage of increased accuracy
and elimination of the phase ambiguity (Wang et al., 1995; de Groot and
Kishner, 1991).
ii) Down-conversion to generate terahertz frequencies by mixing two laser
beams with slightly diﬀerent wavelengths (Hoﬀmann and Hofmann, 2007).
iii) Three-dimensional imaging by prismatic projectors, in which the stereo-
scopic feature works by ﬁltering the two slightly diﬀerent wavelengths in
each eye by special glasses.
For the purpose of illustration we present below the two-wavelength laser di-
ode emitting light in the violet region (about 400 nm). The GaN substrate
was grown by the high-pressure nitrogen solution method (Section 2.3) and pol-
ished mechanically to obtain zero vicinal angle on the whole surface. Then the
substrate was patterned in a special way. Variable orientation of the substrate
surface was obtained by special photolithography and ion-etching procedures
(Figs. 2.36 and 2.37). The substrate uniformly coated by photoresist was exposed
with a variable light dose in a laser writer device. After resist development, a
variable-thickness resist layer was obtained. Its proﬁle was transferred onto the
substrate surface by ion-etching, since the resist etching rate was the same as
for GaN.

the slope angle was 2.0◦.
The substrate was patterned to obtain two sets of parallel, diﬀerently angled
regions aligned along the m-axis: the ﬁrst (A) had a width of 80 μm, and the
second (B) 35 μm (see Fig. 2.38).
The undulations depth was 0.5 μm for both slopes. As a result, the slope
angles and their vicinal angles were 0.35 ± 0.1◦for A and 0.85 ± 0.1◦for B.
Then an LD structure was grown by MOVPE in the same reactor as for the

GaN:Mg subcontact layer. During processing each of the laser stripes was placed
exactly in one of the angled regions, also shown schematically in Fig. 2.38.
Again, let us mark LD chips grown in the 0.35 and 0.85-degree regions as A
and B, respectively. The laser stripes width was 3 μm and the resonator length
700 μm for both A and B. We tested the LDs in the cw mode and the threshold
current was 80 mA for A and 120 mA for B, giving a threshold current density
of 3.8 and 5.7 kA/cm2, respectively, and the threshold voltage was about 5.5 V
for both chips. Due to thermal roll-over the maximum optical power was about
70 mW for A and 40 mW for B. Lasing spectra at optical power of 10 mW were
acquired, and are shown in Fig. 2.39. The lasing wavelength was 405.8 ± 0.2 nm
for set A and 401.0 ± 1 nm for set B. The I–V characteristics for selected A and
B are shown in the inset in Fig. 2.39.
The reason for the diﬀerence in threshold current for A and B is currently not
known and requires further study. Operating voltage at the same current was
lower for B, which could be attributed to the fact that the hole concentration

in Mg-doped GaN is higher for a higher miscut, even though Mg concentration
is equal (Suski et al., 2008; Suski et al., 2010). The observed diﬀerence in lasing
wavelength is a consequence of variation in indium content between A and B.
We reject the possibility of the wavelength variation due to variation of the
QW width (quantum conﬁned Stark eﬀect) because the vertical growth rate is
independent of the vicinal angle δ (Franssen et al., 2008). Moreover, due to the
high density of carriers injected into the MQWs the electric ﬁeld is screened
(Wang et al., 2004; Kuroda and Takeuchi, 2002). The larger spread of the lasing
wavelength observed in B is also currently studied.
To conclude, the indium content of InGaN layers grown by MOVPE can be
controlled not only in the growth direction by the growth parameters but also
in the growth plane by the local vicinal angle of the substrate. In particular, it
is possible to control the wavelength of LDs grown on exact-oriented substrates
by patterning and thus avoid polishing the whole substrate to the desired vicinal
angle. It should also be possible to fabricate multi-wavelength LD arrays, which
would have several applications.
2.8
High-power lasers and arrays on Ammono and HNPS GaN
substrates
High optical power, short-wavelength laser diode sources are needed for a number
of applications, including material processing, table-top projectors (beamers),
and movie projectors. The requirements for these light sources are high optical
power in the multi-watt range, compactness, and competitive price. However, the
fabrication of high-power single-stripe emitters is challenging. The ﬁrst reason is
that the light-power density at the facet of the laser increases rapidly with the
increasing power, approaching the optical damage threshold of the laser mirror.
Figure 2.40 shows the power density on the laser facet calculated for 1 W of
optical power. For a stripe width of around 4 μm the power density is close
to 40 MW/cm2, a value commonly associated with catastrophic optical mirror
damage in nitrides (Ikeda et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the use of broad-area
devices was shown to be quite unsuccessful in the case of nitrides structures.
For instance, the real broad-stripe laser diode with the stripe width of 100 μm
were never demonstrated. The broad-area devices tend to overheat, and fail to
operate under a CW regime of current injection (Goto et al., 2003).
Laser diode array is a technical solution which is free of many problems
(mentioned earlier) and meeting most of the requirements for high-power light
source. However, laser diode arrays have to be large enough to contain from ten
up to even thirty emitters, which means a lateral size up to 1 cm. This large chip
size requires uniform structures deposited on very-high-quality substrates (low
and uniform defect density). We fabricated our laser diode arrays on high-quality
gallium nitride substrates synthesized via ammonothermal method (Section 2.3)
or by multi-feed seed HNSP method (Section 2.3). An example of the laser
structure grown on Ammono substrate is shown in Fig. 2.41.

The laser structures presented here were grown by the metalorganic vapor

crystals were ﬁrst cut with a well-deﬁned miscut (between 0.3–0.6◦) and then
lapped and ﬁnally mechanochemically polished to obtain an atomically ﬂat sur-
face. The laser structures were grown in the following way. An initial cladding
layer of 800 nm of Al0.08Ga0.92N:Si was deposited on the n-type GaN substrate,
then a GaN:Si guiding layer of 100 nm and 50 nm In0.02Ga0.98N current in-
jection layer. The active area was formed from 3.5-nm In0.08Ga0.92N quantum

were capped with a 10-nm GaN layer and a 20-nm electron blocking layer of

with 465-nm Al0.08Ga0.92N:Mg p-cladding and a 30-nm GaN:Mg subcontact
layer.
The laser diode arrays were processed (Fig. 2.42) in the way similar to con-
ventional single-emitter laser diodes (ridge waveguide, oxide isolated devices).
The ridge width was from 3 to 10 μm, the resonator length was 700 μm, and the
number of emitters was from three to thirty-four.
Here we want to present the results obtained on two types of laser diode
arrays: a wider-stripe (10 μm width) mini array and large sixteen emitters full-
size arrays.
The mini-arrays were fabricated as an assembly of three emitters (stripes)
with a stripe width of 10 μm and array pitch of 80 μm. We fabricated mini-
arrays with three and ﬁve emitters in one chip (Perlin et al., 2011b). These chips
were mounted in a CS-style package having two copper electrodes contacting the
bottom and top surfaces of the array.

Summary and conclusions

device is apparently related with a worse dependence between the total thermal
load and chip size which deﬁnes the eﬃciency of the heat dissipation from the
device.
The large arrays contained sixteen to thirty-four emitters with stripe width
of 3 μm and array pitch of 300 μm. The arrays were mounted in a CS-style
package, in a similar way as mentioned in the case of mini-arrays (Fig. 2.45).
After packaging, the arrays were mounted on a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and
set on the water-cooled stage.
For the sixteen-emitter laser diode array the maximum optical power demon-
strated was 4 W at 6 A, as shown in Fig. 2.44. The optical power was limited by
the capability of the external cooling systems. It is worth noticing that the op-
erating current density was only around 18 kA/cm2, which oﬀers the possibility
of obtaining a reasonable lifetime exceeding 5000 h.
The obtained results indicate the great potential and the importance of nitride
laser diode arrays for constructing very high optical power emitters especially
for large movie projectors.

Summary and conclusions
Homoepitaxy of GaN is still a challenge in many aspects, mostly because of the
still limited availability of large, perfect GaN substrates, especially in non-polar
and semi-polar orientations.
The existing methods of GaN crystal growth have their advantages, but also
serious limitations slowing down the progress in bulk crystallization. For HVPE
the main drawback is bowing of crystallographic planes due to stresses induced
by foreign substrates and by growth mechanisms themselves. Therefore, real bulk
crystallization by this method is still a challenge.
The crystals grown by ammonothermal and HNPS methods are of high struc-
tural perfection, but the low rate of their growth slows down the progress towards
mass production and cost eﬀectiveness. On the other hand, GaN crystals grown
under pressure are excellent substrates for laser diodes. Due to their uniformity
and excellent electrical properties, high-power devices including laser diode ar-
rays were constructed. With the use of the pressure-grown substrates, constant
progress is being achieved in the development of the plasma-assisted MBE ap-
proach to laser diode fabrication. The results strongly suggest that PA MBE can
be at least as eﬃcient as MOVPE in growing epitaxial quantum structures for
high-performance GaN-based laser diodes covering a large spectral range.
Further development of GaN bulk crystallization by high-pressure methods is
therefore highly desirable, especially for high-power laser diode and laser diode
array applications. The GaN crystallization process itself still contains questions
of basic importance, including melting conditions of GaN, bulk growth mechan-
isms by HVPE or the scalability limit of the ammonothermal method. The eﬀort
put into solving these issues can be compensated in the near future with new
important applications of GaN-related compounds.

Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN
on silicon
Armin Dadgar and Alois Krost
3.1
Introduction
GaN epitaxial growth has a long history reaching back to the late 1960s [1], and
even growth on silicon reaches back to the early 1970s [2]. But, apart from a
few devices demonstrated, it took more than twenty years to enter mass produc-
tion. The biggest diﬃculty for GaN growth at the beginning of GaN research
was the lack of suitable homosubstrates for epitaxial growth, leading to low
material quality and a high background carrier concentration. Added to this
was the diﬃculty of p-type doping, which required thermal annealing to activ-
ate the Mg acceptor. The most commonly used substrate for GaN growth has
been, and still is, sapphire, but also SiC is used, mostly for high-power or high-
frequency applications. Silicon, which oﬀers the best crystalline properties, large
substrate diameters, and lowest substrate cost, was always in principle attract-
ive for GaN growth, but many diﬃculties appear when it is used as a substrate
in GaN epitaxy. Around 2000, GaN-on-silicon technology made some import-
ant breakthroughs: the demonstration of an MBE-grown LED structure [3, 4],
the development of thicker crack-free GaN layers using an AlGaN intermediate
layer [5], and LT-AlN interlayers [6] grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy
(MOVPE). Since then it has developed rapidly, and in the meantime it has been
proven as a competitive technology to the growth on sapphire in the case of LEDs
and even as an advantageous technology in the segment of high-voltage electron-
ics. We discuss the major problems of GaN epitaxy on silicon with a focus on
the growth by MOVPE, and discuss solutions for epitaxy and device design to
achieve state-of-the-art GaN-on-silicon layers, and demonstrate the beneﬁts of
such layers for device applications.
3.2
The GaN-on-silicon challenges
The diﬃculties in GaN-on-silicon growth have been widely discussed during the
last twelve years with a focus on lattice and thermal mismatch, but in our ex-
perience this focus ignores other diﬃculties in GaN-on-Si layer growth. In sum
they are:
1. high lattice mismatch, low material quality,
2. high thermal mismatch,

3. meltback etching,
4. plastic substrate deformation,
5. vertical conductivity.
In the following we will brieﬂy discuss the state of the art of these topics.
3.2.1
Lattice mismatch
The magnitude of GaN and AlN lattice mismatch on silicon is comparable to
lattice mismatch of GaN on sapphire [7]. Using Si as substrate the bond lengths
of AlN (1.89 ˚A) and GaN (1.95 ˚A) to Si (2.34 ˚A) diﬀer by –19.2 and –16.7 %,
respectively. Thus for AlN on silicon, typically applied as a starting or seeding
layer, the situation is comparable to the growth on sapphire. Consequently, the
density of misﬁt dislocations at the substrate/group-III-nitride interface is about
the same order of magnitude. The major issue arising from the high misﬁt is the
small coherence length of initial nuclei, leading to small nuclei with no long-range
attachment and thus a tendency for high in-plane twist in addition to the usually
relatively rough and unstable silicon surface if compared to sapphire. On sapphire
the nuclei can be better aligned by applying GaN seeding layers which start as a
2D seed which is then heat-treated to form a few larger 3D islands. Upon further
growth they increase in size, coalesce, and again form a 2D layer. By this method,
large defect-free islands can be grown. Using AlN seeding layers on sapphire a
high material quality probably beneﬁts from the identity of one atom; namely,
aluminum. On a microscopic scale most probably an Al2O3-AlN transition is
formed. Optimizing this by the addition of oxygen, such seeding layers enable an
excellent material quality [8] and reduced in-plane twist [9]. Directly-on-silicon
GaN seeding layers do not apply, due to the diﬃculty in growing GaN directly on
silicon, as discussed towards the end of this paragraph. The low surface mobility
of Al usually applied for growing AlN seeding layers hinders lateral growth as
for GaN on sapphire. In addition, the lower stability of the Si surface and the
reactivity of Al and Si, enabling the formation of an alloy, most probably inhibits
a good alignment if the seeding layer growth conditions are not well optimized.
In sum, the small size of the nuclei leading to a relatively high misalignment of
the nuclei, the usually imperfect or microscopically rough Si(111) surface, and
its reactivity with group-III and group-V elements, are not beneﬁcial for high
material quality. Thus special care has to be taken in seeding layer optimiza-
tion, starting with surface preparation and substrate heating. The seeding layer
determines the overall quality that can be achieved, and a poor seeding layer
usually inhibits a subsequent high-quality GaN layer. Due to the six-fold sym-
metry of the GaN crystal the three-fold surface symmetry of silicon (111) is the
ﬁrst choice for growth. On this surface GaN is oriented with its c-axis vertically
to the Si surface plane, thus (0001)AlN ∥(111)Si or [0001]AlN ∥[111]Si. The
in-plane alignment is [1120]AlN ∥[110]Si, along the preferred cleavage direction
of both materials, or [1100]AlN ∥Si[112] (Fig. 3.1). Thus cleavage of GaN on Si is
more easily applied as on sapphire, where a 30-degree rotation of the GaN layer

on the substrate also leads to a 30-degree misalignment of the preferred (1100)
cleavage plane of GaN to that of sapphire. As a consequence, cleaved layers on
sapphire show rugged cleavage planes.
The alignment of the AlN seeding layer on the substrate depends a lot on
the growth conditions and the substrate orientation chosen. There are many
approaches to grow AlN on Si, e.g., using diﬀerent temperatures [10], Al [11, 12],
ammonia or even silane pre-ﬂow [13, 14]. It has been also demonstrated that
under identical growth conditions the growth on Si(110) can be superior to the
growth on Si(111) [15]. In this case, TEM studies revealed the arrangement of
AlN on Si and showed that for AlN on Si(110) in the [001]Si ∥[1¯100]AlN direction
a nearly perfect lattice matching is achieved with a 2:1 periodicity (Fig. 3.2)
[15–18]. In the perpendicular direction the situation is as on Si(111), usually
with a ≈4:5 matching which in sum results in a poor overall matching leading to
diﬀerent bond lengths and a higher initial strain anisotropy in the AlN islands
forming on the Si surface. For the growth on Si(110) the better alignment in one
direction is already leading to better quality in comparison to Si(111).
In contrast to the growth on Si(111) and Si(110), the growth on Si(001)is more
demanding [19–22]. Disregarding the situation of two perpendicular surface re-
constructions and by this two perpendicular preferred alignments on this surface,
even for one type of surface reconstruction lattice mismatch is large and amounts
to 19% and 30% with an alignment of [0001]AlN ∥[001]Si and in-plane either

[01¯10]AlN ∥[110]Si or [¯2110]AlN ∥[110]Si [21, 23, 24]. Thus a good alignment
is very diﬃcult to achieve, but functional device layers and devices have been
demonstrated on up to 150-mm diameter Si substrates [25–27]. Nevertheless, on
all substrate orientations a lot depends on the growth conditions of the seeding
layer, and its optimization is the key for high-quality layers. Taking particular
care on a proper optimization will yield best layers.
3.2.2
Thermal mismatch
Thermal mismatch is the most problematic issue for GaN-on-Si growth. Although
the thermal expansion coeﬃcient is not known exactly for GaN up to growth
temperature it can be estimated to be roughly twice that of silicon leading to
a thermal mismatch above 50 %. Silicon has a thermal expansion coeﬃcient at
room temperature of 2.6 · 10−6 and 4.48 · 10−6 at 1050◦C [28], which averages to
4.04 · 10−6 between typical GaN growth temperature around 1050◦C and room
temperature. The diﬀerence in thermal expansion is somewhat similar to GaN
on sapphire, but, with opposite preﬁx. Thus GaN on sapphire usually is under
compressive stress after cooling from growth temperature, while it is under tensile
stress if grown on silicon. As a consequence for MOVPE growth, crack-free layers
in excess of 1 μm are not possible to realize as long as no special buﬀer layer
schemes which induce compression in the layer stack as AlN/AlGaN buﬀers
or interlayers are applied [5, 6, 29, 30]. Cracking is the preferential relaxation
process of group-III-nitrides if high tensile stress is present. For AlN and GaN
under tensile stress, plastic relaxation has not been reported so far.

82
Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
Today many methods exist which are all either based on pre-straining the
growing GaN layer or by growing in reduced areas, small enough to suppress
cracking. Attempts to solve thermal mismatch by using silicon on insulator sub-
strates failed. Here it was believed that a thin Si layer can glide upon the Si
carrier, and by this relieve stress. However, in reality the glide process would
lead to a displacement of the upper Si / GaN structure in the range of tens to
hundreds of micrometers, depending on the substrate size. SiO2 being a brittle
material does not support such a long-distance glide process, and either cracking
or delamination of the layer will occur [31].
3.2.3
Meltback etching
Meltback etching is quite underestimated, and every material grower will face this
situation in GaN MOVPE growth on silicon. It was ﬁrst described by Ishikawa
et al. [32] and found to lead to SiN and SiGaN deposits [7]. It usually is more
problematic at higher growth temperatures and for thin seeding and thin low
Al-content buﬀer layers. AlN and AlGaN help to prevent this reaction, but not
all device structures allow suﬃciently thick layers to prevent it in any case.
Depending on the growth system a high temperature, AlN seeding and/or buﬀer
layer can free signiﬁcant amounts of gallium which were previously deposited
on the reactor or susceptor walls, and promote meltback etching during growth,
especially when growing thick layers. This is promoted during AlN growth by the
typically low-growth pressure and low V–III ratio for AlN. Ways to circumvent
this are conditioning or heating the reactor prior to growth without the substrate,
with a substrate dummy, or using a system where parts can be exchanged easily.
Alternatively, a proper design of seeding and buﬀer layer growth with a focus on
coalesced smooth layers free from pits is beneﬁcial to hinder meltback etching.
Particles mostly from reactor deposits or from dust prior to loading the sub-
strate can either disturb nucleation and later lead to meltback etching in the
direct vicinity of them, or when deposited on the wafer during (Al-rich) buﬀer
layer growth then lead to a locally too-thin buﬀer and start the reaction from
such defects. Typically, meltback etching is propagating along the GaN/Si in-
terface; thus it is not only a local problem, but with advancing growth time
it can destroy signiﬁcant parts of the wafer. Additionally, it forms 3D objects
which can be several tens of microns high, leading to trouble in processing. It
most probably also produces Si or SiH4 that can be incorporated in undoped
or p-doped layers, changing the electrical properties, and liquid gallium is also
sometimes found in these areas. A variety of appearances of meltback etching
is shown in Fig. 3.3. The appearance diﬀers, but often meltback etching shows
a Ginko leaf-like appearance which represents the propagation of the reaction
between layer and substrate. Also, circular or just rough appearances have been
observed, depending on growth conditions and growth time.
Unfortunately, meltback etching has not been investigated in detail yet, thus
knowledge of the reactions and its impact on the layers grown, as well as possible
routes to circumvent it, is scarce.

layer thickness was only around 3 μm! A typical Ginko leaf (f) appearance is
shown in image (e). Typically, such a meltback etching reaction propagates
along the Si/AlN/GaN interface.
3.2.4
Plastic substrate deformation
Plastic deformation of the substrate is an important topic and often a lim-
itation for the maximum thickness of prestrained layers to achieve crack-free
GaN-on-silicon substrates [33–38]. At typical AlN and GaN growth temperatures

84

samples on Si(111). The slip lines in Si are well visible and, depending on the
strength of deformation and position on the substrate, striations are visible

(>1000◦C) silicon is a relatively soft material and does not withstand high
stresses which occur for prestrained layers in excess of several-micron thickness.
If plastic deformation occurs, the slip planes of Si are usually well visible by
diﬀerential interference contrast (Nomarski) microscopy (Fig. 3.4). The deform-
ation of the substrate, though, leads to a non-reproducible high bow, since once
deformed the substrate is permanently bowed, even if the layer is removed. Weak
plastic deformation, e.g., just the onset, can be acceptable, especially when only
part of the wafer, such as the edges, are aﬀected. However, very often this cannot
be well controlled. Another eﬀect that was observed for 100 and 150 mm sub-
strates were single cracks with additional slip planes that appear reproducible
only in speciﬁc regions of the wafer edge. These can be correlated with the impact
of the substrate ﬂat region on the substrate symmetry. Typically a substrate ﬂat

The GaN-on-silicon challenges
85
and to a smaller portion a substrate notch are breaking the substrate rotational
symmetry and, when high stresses are applied, lead to a preferred anisotropy
orientation of the bow. Therefore, the combination of the substrate ﬂat and
crystalline symmetry leads to slip lines and cracks occurring at the same single
position of the wafer, but not being repeated at positions one would expect from
the crystal symmetry solely, e.g., after a rotation of 120◦and 240◦for Si(111)
substrates.
There are also diﬀerences in the stiﬀness of silicon substrates. These dif-
ferences were already investigated in the 1980s [39]. Here it was found that
Czochralski and ﬂoat-zone grown substrates diﬀer strongly in their stiﬀness,
which was attributed to their impurity concentration. It has been observed that
indeed substrates with high concentrations of dopants such as oxygen or nitro-
gen, but also typical dopants such as As or P, do decrease the eﬀect of plastic
deformation in GaN epitaxy. At the high growth temperatures of GaN on Si
and the high compressive stresses that are required during growth to avoid crack
formation after cooling, very high impurity concentrations are advisable which
are not standard in the silicon industry, where a high purity is typically targeted
by the crystal grower. Therefore, at present one is best advised to order special
custom-made substrates to eﬃciently reduce the eﬀect of plastic deformation and
avoid diﬀerences for diﬀerent Si substrate batches. Even a Si substrate with a
slightly lower quality can be acceptable, since the impact of a lower quality on
the AlN/GaN layers is rather small and the beneﬁt of an eﬃcient slip blocker
can be bigger.
Due to their high crystalline perfection and typically high purity, ﬂoat-
zone substrates are very sensitive to plastic deformation, and the maximum
layer thickness achievable is signiﬁcantly lower when compared to Czochralski-
grown Si.
Another way to postpone the eﬀect of plastic deformation is by using thicker
substrates. This not only delays the onset of plastic deformation but also reduces
the overall bow during growth, and by this helps to improve layer homogen-
eity. But also thicker substrates are limited in thickness, due to the demands of
the crystal growth and processing equipment. And even when wafer thinning is
applied prior to processing, the higher cost also has to be taken into account.
3.2.5
Vertical conductivity
A popular argument for LEDs on silicon substrates has often been the possible
vertical contacting of devices via the substrate. While LEDs on Si substrates
will never be able to compete with thin-ﬁlm LEDs due to their limitation in
light extraction, other devices such as photovoltaic cells or electronics might
beneﬁt from vertical contacts or junctions. A major problem with vertical con-
tacts is the usually applied Al-rich seeding layer. It has been shown that using
AlGaN or thin seeding layers reduces the contact resistivity [40], but it is still
a loss for vertical structures which would limit device performance signiﬁcantly.

86
Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
For photovoltaic solar-cell structures based on InGaN the situation is diﬀerent,
and at high In contents around 40% a p-Si/n-InGaN junction is expected to
yield low resistivities [41, 42]. However, applying such a layer again leads to
an interface reaction, most probably the onset of meltback etching, if grown
by MOVPE visible by darker areas in the Si substrate close to the interface
in Fig. 3.5. Although the growth temperature of high-In-content InGaN is low,
the gases involved in the process and the direct contact of Ga with Si lead to
the formation of small hollows in the substrate surface, and layers often show
high amounts of In as In droplets on the surface. An alternative is AlInN as
a seeding layer, which reduces the amount of holes (Fig. 3.18) and also en-
ables high In contents. Due to its low band-gap energy at high In contents the
AlInN band-gap energy is comparable to In0.40Ga0.60N at In contents of 53%
[43, 44]. Thus it is most probably also suited as low-resistivity contact material
to p-Si.
Apart from the growth of low-resistance Si/group-III-nitride heterostructures
one can use standard seeding and buﬀer layers in combination with standard Si
technology, and form via contacts from the Si backside to a conducting GaN
layer or from the n-GaN layer into the Si substrate [45].

Seed layer growth
87
3.3
Seed layer growth
Seed layer growth on Si substrates is the most important growth step. A poor
seeding layer quality, from the crystalline standpoint, will never yield in a high
layer quality of subsequent layers, although they are usually of better quality
than the seeding layer. It is very important to optimize this layer ﬁrst to achieve
best results for the functional layers of a device structure. There are several
methods known for seed layer growth as high-temperature (HT) AlN [29], low-
temperature (LT) AlN [6], Al-preﬂow [46–50], no Al or N preﬂow [51–53], or
even nitridation and then AlN growth [13], Al(Ga)N [40], growth on HfN [54],
or other buﬀer layer materials as aluminum oxide [55, 56] or SiC [57, 58]. Today,
AlN-based seeding layers are commonly applied due to their good results and
reliability, especially with regard to meltback etching protection.
Nevertheless, often each seeding layer growth method can be optimized to
a high-quality level. When optimizing, and for later production, one important
issue is reproducibility. Here, deposits in the reactor chamber, but also the quality
of the Si substrate surface, play an important role. Some groups use Si substrates
direct from the vendor’s tray and heat treat them under H2 to clean and deoxidize
them, while others use a pre-process chemical etch to form a hydrogen terminated
surface [59] and then either heat-treat the substrates or directly heat up and start
AlN seed layer growth.
It is very diﬃcult to ﬁnally judge on the many diﬀerent approaches, but there
are pros and cons for each method. Long heating and baking always bears the risk
of contaminating the Si surface with deposits from the interior of the reactor. This
is mainly a reproducibility problem, since these deposits may vary in the rate at
which they evaporate during substrate bake. After maintenance a clean reactor
will behave diﬀerently from one with thick coatings. In contrast to sapphire the
silicon surface has a high reactivity, and contaminants usually easily diﬀuse into
the crystal lattice. But the good thing about the baking method is the simplicity
if one is able to achieve a high reproducibility. Wet chemical etching prior to
growth is diﬀerent from what is commonly believed: relatively demanding, since
standard etching systems often leave a thin trace of contaminants on the surface
which leads to a diﬀerent morphology or even a poor crystal quality at these
wafer regions. In most processes this is uncritical, but in epitaxy every surface
defect can become decorated. As already mentioned, the seeding layer is also
important with regard to meltback etching and a good seeding or Al-rich buﬀer
layer has a fully coalesced surface, and by this seals the Si substrate from Ga
which is grown on top of this seed and buﬀer layer.
Several investigations have been performed to understand the microscopic
nature of the AlN/Si interface (Fig. 3.6) which rarely can be observed without
an amorphous interlayer, as in the work by Liu et al. [47], or with a clean and an
amorphous interface, as in the work of Radtke et al. [49]. Often a SiN layer
or amorphous AlN layer forms at the interface [51, 60], especially for high-
temperature-grown AlN [48]. However, such SiN cannot be fully amorphous,

Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon

layer with Al-predeposition of one sample at two diﬀerent sample positions
(within less than 1 mm distance). While the left image shows a distor-

some small areas a perfect transition from Si to AlN. (TEM by P. Veit,

as often believed on the basis of TEM images, or it must not be continuous,
otherwise no epitaxial growth would be possible. TEM typically applied for
these investigations averages through the sample cross-section, thus it is diﬃ-
cult to judge on the quality and details of this SiN layer. There is the additional
possibility that some of the SiN forms during AlN growth.
As long as the surface is not continuously covered with AlN, which is usually
the case (see Fig. 3.7), Si and N can react, forming SiN. The nitridation process
of Si involves Si diﬀusion to the surface and there the formation of SiN. For a
thickness of ≈6 nm this process is self-limiting [61] and the formation of crystal-
line (0001) oriented β-Si3N4 on Si(111) in an ammonia ambient at temperatures
above 1075 K has been reported [62, 63]. Also, such a β-Si3N4 layer which has a
coincidence site lattice of 1:2 to Si(111) and 2:5 to AlN has been used in MBE

The surface is not smooth, and surface pits are a high risk for meltback
etching when GaN is grown on such a layer.

to improve the quality of the subsequent layers [64]. From the island shape of
AlN during initial epitaxy, such a process might be involved and interrupted by
AlN coalescence before thick SiN forms.
Some processes used for seeding layer growth even force the nitridation of
the Si surface by a preﬂow of ammonia [13, 64]. Indeed, AlN can be grown
on such treated surfaces, but to our knowledge best layers usually involve Al
preﬂow. Aside the initial growth of the AlN seed, an AlN buﬀer requires high-
quality AlN which can be grown at optimized conditions on the initial seeding
layer. As mentioned earlier, one prerequisite to reduce meltback etching is the
growth of a continuous layer free from pits. For AlN growth this usually requires
high growth temperature and low V–III ratio. But a high growth temperature
of the seeding layer can deteriorate or roughen the unprotected surface of the
substrate with a melting point of only 1410◦C. In addition, the thermal gradient
present in cold wall MOVPE systems, as well as the stress induced by the growing
high-temperature layer, can be suﬃcient to initiate plastic substrate deformation
already during seed or buﬀer layer growth at extreme temperatures.
3.4
Stress management
Stress management, often also termed strain engineering, is the key for GaN
device growth on silicon. Apart from thermal stress arising upon cooling, other
sources of stress are present which often lead to an additional source of tensile
stress. In, sum we ﬁnd the following sources of stress:
• Initial 3D growth: hydrostatic compressive stress [65].
• Island coalescence: tensile stress [66].
• Lattice mismatch: tensile (Al-rich)[67] or compressive (In-rich).
• (Edge) dislocation climb: decrease of compressive stress[66, 68–70].
• Doping: tensile stress (silicon doping) [66, 70–73].
• Cooling: tensile stress when grown on silicon.
Typically, in device structures several of these stress sources are present. Thus
the control and manipulation is the key to solve cracking for GaN on Si, but also
to reduce the bow to acceptable values for processing. A key instrument for this
is in situ curvature control. By this, the growth steps introducing stress and the
eﬃciency of countermeasures can be monitored.
Indirectly, it even enables a monitoring of the layer quality. When the material
quality is poor, compressive stress is diﬃcult to apply. Additionally, once applied
it quickly reduces to low values by stress induced edge dislocation climb but also
when doping with Si, both indicating a high edge dislocation density. Layers
which do not show this eﬀect or only weakly typically are of high quality with
edge dislocation densities below 109 cm−2. Monitoring the curvature signal thus
enables a fast optimization of the seeding and buﬀer layers without additional
measurements. Details on doping and stress can be found in Section 3.4.1.3.

Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
Stress management for GaN on Si typically involves a layer with a lower in-
plane lattice parameter as AlN or AlGaN. As alternative but also an extension
of this method selective growth in ﬁelds small enough to prevent crack-formation
is applicable.
3.4.1
Stress management by Al(Ga)N layers
Al-rich layers are commonly applied for stress management of GaN-on-Si. They
can either only apply in the lower part of the buﬀer layer or be distributed in
the whole GaN stack. However, usually they are only present in the lower non-
functional part of the device grown, because the higher band-gap energy and
lower conductivity is usually detrimental for device operation.
3.4.1.1
Buﬀer layer
The most common approach is the growth of an AlGaN
buﬀer layer inducing compression on the subsequently grown GaN. This approach
has already been used by Ishikawa et al., and led to the basic device structure
of Nitronex FETs [29, 32, 74]. To be successful with such a structure a high
material quality is prerequisite to maintain the compression built up. Typically,
edge-type dislocations in material under high compressive stress incline, and
this inclination leads to a shortening of the lattice plane, and they terminate as
schematically shown in Fig. 3.8. This reduction of the crystal volume leads to a

Fig. 3.8. Dislocation climb in group-III-nitrides typically leads to a shortening
of the lattice plane which is terminated by an edge-type dislocation. The side
view, commonly shown in TEM images as in Fig. 3.12, is shown schematic-
ally in the left scheme where the inclination is induced by compressive stress
leading to vacancy incorporation or, even for layers under tensile stress, by
silicon incorporation at the dislocation probably inducing a similar mechan-
ism as vacancy incorporation. The right image shows the plan view where the
additional lattice plane is shown in grey and the direction of its movement by
the arrow. Note that in the left part of this plan-view image, lattice planes
are more closely spaced due to the additional lattice plane terminated by the
dislocation.

reduction in compressive stress. Therefore, to be successful the AlN seeding layer
growth must be performed carefully with the aim of minimizing the edge-type
dislocation density.
Additionally, the change in AlGaN composition should be well chosen. Huge
steps in the lattice constant of the relaxed alloys reduce the critical thickness
for fully strained growth, and will lead to the formation of misﬁt dislocations
or cracks at an earlier stage than smaller changes in lattice parameter. On the
other hand, high-strain gradients support the inclination and annihilation of
dislocations, as shown in Fig. 3.12. Apart from FET growth, such layers are also
used as a buﬀer for other device types to achieve thick GaN layers, e.g., for LED
applications. Nevertheless, a high GaN buﬀer thickness solely using this method
is diﬃcult to achieve in combination with low bow values. It has, however, been
demonstrated that by a proper optimization of the layers a 4-μm thick GaN
buﬀer can be grown using only this method [75].
3.4.1.2
Interlayers
The use of interlayers can be manifold. By interlayers we
mean the insertion of layers in a GaN or an AlGaN buﬀer structure typically be-
low the functional device layers. The common basic principle is to use layers with
a smaller lattice constant than the main buﬀer layer, e.g., AlGaN in the case of
GaN. Upon relaxation of the narrow lattice material the subsequently grown buf-
fer usually is under compression which can fully or partially compensate tensile
thermal stress. Two main approaches can be distinguished: superlattices or single
layers or single layer stacks.
Superlattices
A combination of AlN and GaN is most often used for superlattice
growth. This approach was ﬁrst successfully demonstrated by Feltin et al. for a
green LED structure [76]. They analyzed stress development and demonstrated
that these SL layers induce compressive stress on the subsequently grown GaN
to compensate for tensile thermal stress. Having only a relatively thin GaN main
layer this method was not very successful for LEDs, but for FET devices this
method gained a lot of interest in the mid-2000s. Sugahara et al. and Iwakami
et al. [30, 77] demonstrated a HV-FET with a thick AlN/GaN SL followed by a
600-nm thick GaN buﬀer and the active device layer. A beneﬁt of these SL layers
is the potentially high resistivity, especially for vertical conduction. However, for
such devices it is most likely also important to suppress the formation of pyro-
and piezoelectrically-induced 2DEG and 2DEH gases at the interfaces, which
could lead to parasitic conduction paths. Thus, compensation doping using C
or Fe is most likely necessary for FET applications when applying such buﬀer
structures.
Al-rich AlGaN interlayers
At present, the most commonly applied layers
for strain engineering are Al-rich interlayers distributed with distances above
100 nm, typically between 500 and 3000 nm, in the GaN matrix. The mode of
action of these layers is based on their partial or full relaxation and subsequent
GaN growth, whereas this GaN layer grows pseudomorphically or only partially

92

relaxed on top of these interlayers, thus under compressive stress. For relaxation
it is not prerequisite to initially form misﬁt dislocations at the interface. Also
micro-cracks or island growth can lead to compression on the subsequent GaN
layer; e.g., when AlN is grown at high temperatures it usually cracks when ex-
ceeding a critical thickness, but does not necessarily introduce misﬁt dislocations
at the stage of cracking. On the other hand low-temperature AlN grows in an
island shape with islands of a lateral size of ≈10–20 nm. In both cases, over-
growth with GaN will ﬁll the crack or the space between the islands, and due
to the high strain ﬁelds misﬁt dislocations are preferentially generated at these
positions. Surprisingly, with the upper interface GaN does not relax in a manner
as does AlN, and therefore fewer misﬁt dislocations are formed (Fig. 3.9). This
has been shown in detail by Markurt et al. [78]. With each misﬁt dislocation
at the lower GaN/AlN interface the AlN layer is more and more relaxed, and
with each missing misﬁt dislocation on the upper AlN/GaN interface, thus miss-
ing relaxation of GaN on the AlN interlayer, the new lattice parameter of the
partially relaxed AlN layer is beneﬁcial in building up compressive stress in the
subsequently grown GaN layer.
Such interlayers can be grown in many ways as pure AlN at high or low
temperature, as, e.g., AlGaN but also as AlInN, as long as the In content is well
below 17%. Even alloying boron, e.g., to compress AlN on Si, might be possible,
but until now it has not been demonstrated, and BN itself seems to be diﬃcult
to grow in the wurtzitic phase and to be more suited as a masking layer similar
to in situ deposited SiN. It should be noted that for group-III-nitride growth
the hexagonal BN phase has been applied for release and simple layer transfer
from a sapphire substrate which should in principle also apply for the growth
on Si [79, 80]. In the end, each type of interlayer must be well optimized with
regard to composition, thickness, and growth conditions. There is no general
rule, and there are even diﬀerences for nominally identical layers in diﬀerent

growth systems, most likely due to diﬀerent parasitic prereactions and eﬀective
precursor pressures.
In XRD measurements interlayers are often not identiﬁed as pure AlN but
as AlGaN. This can be due to the interruption of this layer by cracks or by
island formation, thus the layer consist of AlN and GaN. Such cracks or the gaps
in the AlN layer ﬁll up with GaN and are also the origin of at least a part of
the relaxation process necessary to change the strain state of the subsequently
grown GaN layer. Apart from this observation it is also indicated that AlGaN is
grown due to a too-low stability of the GaN surface when AlN is grown under
unfavorable growth conditions for GaN, leading to an incorporation of Ga in
the growing layer. When intentionally applied, indeed growing AlGaN instead of
AlN can lead to a better material quality and even to higher compressive stress
of the subsequently grown layer (Fig. 3.10); the origin might be in a too-strong
deterioration of the lattice (strain ﬁelds leading to tilt and twist on a small
scale) if highly mismatched AlN is grown, but it might be also correlated with
the better mobility of Ga atoms during epitaxial growth improving the overall
crystalline quality of the layer.
Fritze et al. have demonstrated that in a device buﬀer structure with three
AlGaN interlayers, the three interlayers act diﬀerently on strain and quality de-
velopment [35]. There it has been shown that the ﬁrst layer is only inducing
compression on the subsequently grown GaN, while the second further enhances
the degree of compression but also enhances the material quality slightly. The

third layer has no impact on strain but signiﬁcantly improves the material
quality. This result indicates that an optimization for each layer is advisable
High compressive stress induced by the interlayers is enhancing edge dislo-
cation climb leading to a reduction of compressive stress [68–70]. Thus, a high
dislocation density can be already detected during growth if a high compressive
stress is reduced during GaN layer growth, e.g., visible in a change of the in situ
curvature slope. This method for growth control works well for layers with edge
dislocation densities above ≈1 × 109 cm−2. For lower dislocation densities the
eﬀect is rather small.
Doping with silicon has been also reported to lead to dislocation climb, here
even for layers which are under tension (see also Section 3.4.1.3). We have also
found indications that a reduced GaN growth temperatures decreases dislocation
climb. But, signiﬁcantly lowering the growth temperature often leads to a lower
material quality, thus it is not a well suited method to reduce this eﬀect.
3.4.1.3
Doping
A topic not only related to the growth of group-III-nitrides
on silicon is the impact of doping on strain and how to circumvent it.
Numerous reports exist in the literature on the impact of silicon doping on
stress [66, 70–73, 81–84]. In the meantime, many models were developed, either
claiming Si-induced surface-roughening inducing edge dislocation climb [70],
stress-induced edge-dislocation climb by vacancy formation [68], dislocation
masking resulting in edge-dislocation climb [138, 66], Si “atmospheres” blocking-
edge dislocation climb [85–87], or Fermi-level induced-edge dislocation climb as
the origin of this observation [83, 84]. As has been observed by several authors,
compressive stress and/or high Si doping concentrations do lead to an increasing
tensile stress. In the latter case, even for a layer already under tensile stress, this
tensile stress increases upon Si doping [66], which cannot be explained by a simple
energy-balance model. The mechanism seems to be speciﬁc to Si doping because,
e.g., Ge doping, in concentrations even higher than Si, does not necessarily show
this eﬀect, and thus excludes a Fermi-level induced mechanism as claimed by
Xie et al. [83, 84]. The latter eﬀect can be excluded at typical GaN growth
conditions as, e.g., used by machine vendors as AIXTRON for GaN growth
(PReactor = 200 mbar, V–III approx. 1000) [138, 88]. It cannot be ruled out yet
that at growth conditions with lower growth pressure and likely lower V–III ratio
a Fermi-level induced vacancy model might additionally induce dislocation climb.
It should be noted that from all experiments it can be concluded that perfect
dislocation-free group-III-nitrides do not suﬀer from signiﬁcant tensile stress gen-
eration by Si doping. This is only an eﬀect when edge dislocations are present.
Therefore, it can be also used to monitor the layer quality already during growth
by an in situ curvature measurement, since the change of the curvature slope
during Si doping is correlated to the edge-type dislocation density [66].
In general, for typical heteroepitaxial material, especially on Si substrates,
where dislocation densities are often higher than on sapphire or more diﬃcult to
reduce, Ge doping is an interesting alternative to Si [138, 89–91]. For GaN on

sapphire even a small amount of tension is acceptable, but for GaN on Si it is
often not. Not only the absence or low impact on stress is interesting for layers on
Si, but also the higher achievable doping concentration. Often, device layers are
limited in thickness on Si and need to be interrupted by strain engineering layers
leading to a higher vertical resistivity. A good current spreading and low-contact
resistivities can be achieved using Ge dopants, because doping concentrations up
to 3 × 1020 cm−3 can be achieved without degradation of the layers [88]. But at
typical GaN growth temperatures the incorporation of Ge using either GeH4 or
a metalorganic compound as isobutylgermane is driven by the compound’s vapor
pressure above the GaN surface, and is very ineﬀective. About three orders of
magnitude higher Ge concentrations in the gas phase are required to achieve a
comparable doping concentration as for Si doping. In addition, the incorporation
depends strongly on the crystal facet. For a-plane GaN a roughly two-orders-of-
magnitude higher Ge incorporation has been observed [92] which is not the case
for Si doping. Although Ge has been found not to diﬀuse in GaN, the high amount
of Ge in the reactor bears the risk of memory eﬀects, as it can be observed for
Mg doping.
3.4.2
Selective growth
Alternatively to the usage of interlayers or to expand their potential for thick
layers, selective growth by substrate patterning or patterning a buﬀer layer with a
dielectric mask based on, e.g., SiO2 or Si3N4 can achieve thicker layers [31, 93–96].
Here, tensile stress from cooling to room temperature can be partially relieved in
the patterned regions, with crack generation often observed in the Si substrate
regions between the overgrown areas due to the lower stiﬀness of the substrate
in comparison with the group-III-nitride layer. When using dielectric masks, one
diﬃculty is material transport from the mask to the unstructured region, where
an enhanced growth rate is observed at the edge regions. Al-rich compounds
tend to form polycrystalline deposits on the mask, which can disturb the growth
of thicker layers due to the unavoidable lateral growth from the mask openings.
An alternative approach is to etch the substrate prior to growth, also avoiding
the usage of any masking material. The trenches formed are required to be deep
enough to suppress a coalescence of the layer growing in the trench with the one
above. The required suppression of meltback etching at the trench edges is an
additional diﬃculty of this method.
3.5
Dislocation reduction
As mentioned earlier, dislocation reduction starts with an optimized seeding
layer. With low initial dislocation densities it is much simpler to achieve an
overall satisfying dislocation density in the active layers.
Independent of this, most methods for dislocation reduction in the buﬀer
layer involve lateral or 3D growth. Around the year 2000, methods which com-
monly involve an interruption of growth as epitaxial lateral overgrowth were very

popular [97–101], or pendeo-epitaxy [57, 102–106]. If a buﬀer layer were required
this method is quite time-consuming, requiring two growth steps. Alternatively
one can prepattern the substrate either with masked regions or etched trenches.
This has been successfully applied by Strittmatter et al. [106]. However, this
method is diﬃcult to control, and meltback etching is a common problem. One
can also transfer ELO methods to the microscale and start the growth on a
substrate with, e.g., a nano- or micropatterned surface [107].
Nevertheless, such methods are more time-consuming, and therefore methods
which improve the quality by in situ methods are more often used. A well-
established method on silicon substrates is the application of a SiN masking
layer which is believed to form a nearly closed layer hindering GaN nucleation
on top of it [10, 108, 109]. Only in small openings of this layer new nuclei form,
grow laterally, and coalesce, leading to a reduced dislocation density (Fig. 3.11)
[110, 111]. Depending on the layer grown prior to the mask, and its strain state
and quality, the GaN grown atop can be still under compression. Indeed, it can
even lead to a stronger compression during growth, as is evident from signiﬁcantly
reduced tensile stress at room temperature [112], but usually the 3D growth mode
to a larger part relaxes previous compressive stress.
The SiN layer usually is hard to be visualized in TEM directly, but its im-
pact on dislocations can be viewed [110]. Usually, screw-type dislocations can

97
be more easily annihilated which already stems from the much higher statistical
probability that two dislocations with opposite burgers vector react, while for
edge-type dislocations, with six possible burger vectors, it is less probable.
Recently, HR-TEM images and calculations revealed the exact structure of the
SiN masking layer, which is found to be a SiGaN3 layer [113].
Apart from this diﬃculty in visualizing the layers in HR-TEM, in SEM a
SiN layer typically can be easily visualized by the contrast it forms due to the
enhanced electron concentration it induces as for a doped layer. In principal,
any layer acting as anti-surfactant can be used instead of SiN, but only few are
known to be suitable as an in situ layer, which is the only method suited for mass
production. With BN acting as anti-surfactant, small amounts of boron alloyed
in AlN or GaN might act similarly to Si, with the beneﬁt that it does not intro-
duce n-doping in the layer. Thus it is potentially better suited for high-frequency
and high-power electronics based on silicon substrates. Another approach is the
growth of strained layers. Especially edge-type dislocations tend to bend at the
interfaces and within strained layers reducing stress by a climb process [68, 70].
For suﬃciently high dislocation densities this increases the recombination prob-
ability and yields in an overall reduction in dislocation density. Strained layers
can be already introduced as buﬀer layers. A common growth scheme for crack-
free GaN on Si involves an AlN seeding layer followed by a graded AlGaN layer.
In this graded layer an increasing compressive stress is introduced in the layer,
which often leads to an increased dislocation climb (Fig. 3.12). The GaN layer
grown atop the AlGaN is further strained. Usually, some misﬁt dislocations are
formed at the interface, but this is not relaxing all compressive stress, and in-
clined dislocations which annihilate at a high rate can usually be observed [69].
This process is most probably assisted by an initial 3D growth mode originating

85%, 66%, and 52%) grown on AlN, showing dislocations with a-component
(edge and mixed dislocations). The interfaces are marked by the white lines.
An increasing compressive stress is induced in the AlGaN layers, ﬁrst by
the AlN seed and buﬀer, then by the following layers. While dislocations
propagate vertically in the AlN which is grown under tensile stress, they
bend in the AlGaN layers where they are under an increasing compression.

in the diﬀering lattice parameters of the AlGaN and GaN layers, leading to
dislocation bending, as is observed for 3D growth on, e.g., in situ SiN masks.
Also, strain ﬁelds, as in superlattices, can be used to force dislocation climb,
increase annihilation probability, and reduce the dislocation density. This was
ﬁrst demonstrated by Feltin et al. [76], and should also apply for high-voltage
buﬀer layers of AlN and GaN, as demonstrated by Iwakami et al. [77].
3.6
Light-emitting diodes
Light-emitting diodes are still the main driver for GaN research. In 2012, the
majority of LEDs were still grown on sapphire substrates, Sanken had been
selling simple blue and green LED on Si for several years, Latticepower an-
nounced that they were ramping up LED on silicon production [114], and Toshiba
began selling GaN-on-Si LEDs based on Bridgelux growth development on 200-
mm Si substrates. Apart from these three companies which already oﬀer LEDs,
others, such as OSRAM OS and Samsung, demonstrated high eﬃciencies for
GaN-on-Si LEDs.
The main driver for this is the expectation that GaN-based LEDs epitaxi-
ally grown on silicon substrates enable a signiﬁcant reduction in manufacturing
cost [115]. This stems from the possible use of large-diameter substrates and
using depreciated Si fabs to mass produce LEDs. As long as eﬃciency and yield
are competitive for sapphire technology, there are many beneﬁts in growth, pro-
cessing, and also operation. Until now, light-emitting diodes grown on silicon
substrates have been known as laboratory demonstrations for more than ten
years [3, 4, 76, 93, 94, 116, 117], but they were long not believed to be a po-
tential alternative to the growth on sapphire and SiC. The main reason for this
belief was the poor eﬃciency due to light absorption by the Si substrate and
the common belief that the material quality on silicon cannot compete with that
on sapphire and SiC. But, although the material quality has long been inferior
to that on sapphire and SiC, the reason for low eﬃciency mostly originates in
absorption by the Si substrate. It is much higher than the often-assumed 50%
if compared to sapphire. The reason is that not only back-emitted light is ab-
sorbed to about 30–40%, but also laterally-emitted light will be absorbed after a
few reﬂections at the Si/III-nitride interface. Consequently, the poor eﬃciency is
mostly due to optical losses and not necessarily an inferior material quality. After
about 0.5 mW output power of a blue LED was achieved in 2003 [118] an output
power close to 0.9 mW at 20 mA and 477 nm, reported in 2004, [66] was the
record value until 2007. The main reason for the stagnation in improvement was
light-absorption by the Si substrate, which will be discussed later in this chapter.
But already a poor material quality—namely, dislocations—are signiﬁcantly re-
ducing the internal quantum eﬃciency of LEDs [119–121]. Thus, for high-power
LEDs it is required to reduce the dislocation density at least to the low 108 cm−3
range. Lower values are not simply achievable, and usually do not signiﬁcantly
improve quantum eﬃciency. Dislocation densities in the low 108 cm−3 range can

be typically achieved by a growth scheme employing a high-quality AlN seeding
layer followed by an AlGaN transition layer stack, as, e.g., in Fritze et al. [35].
The role of this AlGaN layer stack is to induce compression, which results in two
eﬀects. First, dislocations incline, increasing their recombination probability (see
Fig. 3.12), and compressive prestress prevents cracking. This eﬀect is observed
only when a high-quality seeding layer is grown, thus when in situ curvature
measurements are performed they already enable judgment of the crystalline
quality. The GaN layer grown on top of this buﬀer then usually grows under
compressive stress, which prevents cracking upon cooling. Often directly on the
AlGaN layer or after a thin GaN layer an in situ deposited SiN mask is inser-
ted [117, 118]. This masking layer reduces the compression of the following GaN
layer but signiﬁcantly reduces dislocations by the promotion of 3D island growth.
Then a thicker GaN buﬀer is grown, often with strain-engineering layers based
on AlGaN or AlN grown at high or low temperature [6]. For a successful LED
device the last functional n-doped GaN and active device layers should not be
interrupted by any Al-rich layer for strain engineering. Such strain-engineering
layers usually increase series resistance and lead to an increase in operation
voltage around 0.5 V for each layer. Typical thicknesses of the ﬁnal GaN layers
are above 2 μm, even when highly doped with Si. A prerequisite for this is low
density of edge and mixed dislocations (see also Section 3.4.1.3).
In principle, GaN-based LEDs can be grown in a large variety of other struc-
tures. Patterned substrates or selective growth helps in reducing stress and avoids
cracking [93, 96], and nanowire LEDs are thought of as a high-brightness altern-
ative due to perfect material and good light extraction [122, 123], but they are
diﬃcult to contact and in detail the large surfaces present additional problems.
Also light extraction, if looked at in detail, it is not as good as for thin-ﬁlm LEDs.
LED structures can be grown on silicon-on-insulator substrates [124, 125], and
also Bragg reﬂectors were inserted to improve light extraction [126, 127]. Also,
AlGaN-based UV-LEDs on Si substrates were investigated [128].
Today, typical GaN-on-Si LEDs are no longer contacted through the Si sub-
strate on which they are grown [129, 130], though Sanken is selling such a device
which has a high electrostatic discharge stability of 5000 V. For high external
quantum eﬃciencies, LED structures on Si are processed as thin-ﬁlm LEDs where
light extraction is signiﬁcantly enhanced. By simple calculations (Figs. 3.13 and
3.14) one already ﬁnds that the light of an LED on Si substrate is either directly
extracted vertically or, to a much smaller amount, arises from light reﬂected at
the Si substrate (>60% loss) or from a region close to the side facets and later-
ally emitted. Taking these losses into account, even better reﬂecting buﬀer layers
than Si as, e.g., HfN [54], will not signiﬁcantly enhance light emission, because
all or at least a larger portion of laterally emitted light is still lost. To signiﬁc-
antly prevent this, extremely high reﬂectivities close to 100% are required. Thus,
even for high-brightness LEDs with a silver-based reﬂector surface, roughening is
crucial to minimize reﬂection losses and extract light with as little loss or as few
reﬂections as possible. Alternatively, one can conclude that vertical nano- or

Fig. 3.13. Calculated amount of laterally emitted light and its extraction from
LED structures. Left: Impact of multiple reﬂections on attenuation. Even
for a high reﬂectance of 80% only 1% of light remains after 20 reﬂections.
This strongly reduces laterally emitted light extraction as shown on the right
image for 40% substrate reﬂectivity and diﬀerent device sizes. Small devices
on an absorbing Si substrate enable better light extraction.
microstructures engineered with structures which reduce reabsorption of the
laterally emitted light can also be used for high-eﬃciency and high-power LEDs.
Regarding material quality it is well known that dislocations reduce the in-
ternal quantum eﬃciency [131]. While internal quantum eﬃciencies are low at
high dislocation densities of 1010 cm−2, yielding in substantial losses in the
quantum eﬃciency of several 10%, the eﬀect is much lower at lower disloca-
tion densities, and amounts to only a few percent at dislocation densities in the
low 108 cm−2 range.
In the meantime, thin-ﬁlm LED concepts were developed for layers grown
on Si, namely partial or full substrate removal [130–133], where this method
signiﬁcantly enhances light-extraction eﬃciency and leads to high internal eﬃ-
ciencies [134, 135] and wallplug eﬃciencies of 58% [136] at high light-extraction
eﬃciencies around 70%, comparable to LEDs grown on sapphire [136].
At present, the commonly applied method of Si substrate removal involves
grinding and wet chemical etching of the original III-nitride Si carrier while the
layer is glued or bonded to a new carrier as Si or copper [132, 137]. It is a
relatively simple and fast method. Recently, a separation method on sapphire
was demonstrated which involves a 3-nm thin BN layer as a buﬀer [79, 80].
This should in principle be also applicable to Si substrates. If it does introduce
new diﬃculties, as delamination during growth of the highly strained ﬁlm has
to be investigated. By today it has been proven that substrate removal applied
to GaN on Si yields a comparable optical output power if the device structure
on Si is well-optimized [35]. The beneﬁt of growth on Si is the ease of substrate
removal by mechanical and chemical methods. Additionally, low-cost Si carriers
can be used for thin-ﬁlm LED bonding, in contrast to Ge-based carriers often
used for layers grown on sapphire due to the better thermal match upon bonding.

Light-emitting diodes

Fig. 3.14. The left image shows the origin of light emitted and extracted lat-
erally at the side facets of a 300 × 300 μ2m and 4-μm thick LED structure
in epoxy resin, of which only the lower left quadrant is shown. This calcu-
lation does not take into account roughened surfaces or interfaces but only
laterally-emitted light within an opening angle of 38◦(e.g., for GaN in an
epoxy resin matrix). A signiﬁcant portion of light extracted laterally origin-
ates in a 10-μm wide edge region, while less than 10% and 1% of light from
a region >30μm and >120 μm from the edge leaves the structure, respect-
ively. Thus light emitted laterally in the inner part of the structure is mostly
absorbed. From this region only vertically-emitted light and a small fraction
of backward-emitted and reﬂected light will be visible, as shown in the right
image, where in total 33% of all light emitted in the six 38◦light cones is
extracted. In principle the limitation to six 38◦light cones allows only 63%
of all light generated internally to be extracted if 100% substrate reﬂectivity
and no absorption losses are assumed. Therefore, in the example here, 6.1%
of all light generated internally is extracted at the side facets (left image),
and in total only about 20% can be extracted (right image). Reﬂection losses
and the limitation to a 38% light cone are the most signiﬁcant limitations for
LED light extraction. Surface roughening, reducing multiple reﬂections, and
circumventing the limitation of the light extraction angle, ideally combined
with thin-ﬁlm techniques, will signiﬁcantly increase LED brightness for layers
grown on silicon substrates.
Another beneﬁt of using silicon is the higher thermal conductivity in comparison
to germanium.
Although the active part of a GaN-based LED on silicon is quite similar to
the one on sapphire, growth needs to be optimized, and the freedom in design is
more limited. The latter originates in the limited thickness achievable without
any strain-engineering means. While on sapphire one can grow 5-μm thick layers
and more without any growth interruption, on silicon, this is usually limited to
2–3 μm, depending on the material quality. Si doping further limits this thickness
if a high number of edge-type dislocations are present. In addition to contacting,

102
Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
high doping levels are required, making the choice of an alternative n-type dopant
source as Ge interesting to avoid problems, as the limitation in doping to the low
1019 cm−3 range when using Si and the limitation when the edge-type dislocation
density is still too high to neglect its impact on tensile stress generation [88, 138].
A total thickness of the functional layers of an LED around 2–3 μm can be
suﬃcient for current distribution, nevertheless it may limit LED designs in the
future.
LED device layer growth on large substrates above 100 mm diameter was
ﬁrst demonstrated in 2006 [139–141], and it was shown that there is even a
beneﬁt with regard to bow and homogeneity. In the meantime, Si substrates
with diameters as large as 200 mm were demonstrated, with wallplug eﬃciencies
of 43% and IQE of 90% and very narrow (0002) and (10¯12) ω-rocking curves
of 220 and 320 arcsec, respectively. The dislocation density was determined to
2–3 · 108 cm−2 [142]. With regard to larger wafer diameters, there is no indica-
tion that scaling is signiﬁcantly limited except by reactor design. Reactor design
in MOVPE is usually based on cold-wall reactor concepts. Using large-diameter
substrates, wafer bow will lead to temperature and with it thickness and compos-
itional inhomogeneities. This can be reduced and also eliminated with the use
of warm- or hot-wall reactor concepts. Alternatively, single-wafer reactors are
very capable of achieving homogeneous temperature proﬁles, even on 300-mm
Si substrates, because the temperature proﬁle can usually be adjusted between
the diﬀerent radially arranged heating zones, as, e.g., in Thomas Swan (now
AIXTRON Ltd) CCS reactors.

Electronics
In the beginning, III-nitride electronics was typically connected to RF-
electronics, and it was believed that there is a huge market, especially in the
communication sector. However, it turned out that high-frequency operation is
not as straightforward to achieve, and the market for telecommunication base
stations turned out to be rather small. Especially here, device growth cost turned
out to be less important than for mass products. But in the mid-2000s another
type of device came into the focus: high-power, especially high-voltage, FETs.
They do not require operation frequencies in the GHz range, and can even be pro-
duced on Si substrates at low cost. Typical operation frequencies are targeted in
the kHz to MHz range where the residual conductivity of the substrate does not
govern device losses. With high-breakdown ﬁeld strengths of 3.3 · 106 V/cm−3
[143] and high-drift saturation velocities the potential of GaN yields further than
that of SiC, but at present the lack of GaN substrates reduces the market to a
voltage range above that of Si and below that of SiC. The focus of such devices
is voltage transformation as, e.g., in switching power supplies and high current
switching. Especially in the voltage range from 600 to 1200 V it is believed
that such devices can reach a better price and performance than pure Si-based
devices, and it is still possible that they can replace SiC at higher voltages. For

GaN-based switching power supplies high conversion eﬃciencies well above 90%
are expected at low and high load states. In addition, even high-current devices
based on Si might be replaced due to the expected higher conversion eﬃciency
and smaller device size of GaN-based switches. HV-FETs on Si are expected to
be produced in quantities (substrate area) similar to GaN-based LEDs.
The typical GaN high-voltage device is, as already mentioned, an FET. It is
not operated vertically but laterally, and the 2D electron gas of a GaN/AlGaN
heterostructure is typically used for current switching. The main disadvantage is
the lack of a simple and reliable method to achieve normally-oﬀor enhancement
mode FET operation, though there are numerous reports of such devices on Si
substrates. This type of device is required to achieve fail-safe transformers.
3.7.1
RF transistors
High-frequency devices on silicon are more diﬃcult to realize than on sapphire or
SiC due to the residual conductivity of the Si substrate. This leads to parasitic
charges below the buﬀer structure which are even more problematic due to the
limited total layer thickness if no interlayers are applied. If applied, interlayers
can but must not lead to problems as parasitic charges. In sum, these issues lead
to potentially high RC values. Another diﬃculty is the thermal resistance of
silicon, which is about a factor of three higher than for SiC commonly used as a
substrate of high-performance RF-FETs. Apart from these problems it has been
already demonstrated that GaN-on-Si-based RF-FETs are in principle capable
of high-frequency, high-power operation.
At least for operation at mobile telecommunication frequencies around 2 GHz,
most problems can be solved as, e.g., NITRONEX is selling RF devices based on
an AlN/AlGaN/GaN buﬀer on silicon. Here no interlayers for strain engineering
are used, but the graded AlGaN buﬀer is applied for stress control yielding in
low wafer bow and crack-free layers. Recently also high-frequency operation at
40 GHz with 2.5 W/mm has been demonstrated [144]. Here the buﬀer on Si
consisted of an AlGaN transition layer followed by 1.5 μm Al0.08Ga0.92N and
a 150 nm thin GaN layer, followed by 6 nm of AlN and a 3-nm SiN capping
layer. More details on FETs in general can be found in Chapters 6 and 11.
3.7.2
HV transistors
High-voltage devices require a well-insulating buﬀer layer which can be achieved
by high Al-content or compensation doping of GaN. The theoretically expected
values of the breakdown voltage for such layers have, however, not been achieved
yet. The main reason are dislocations, and of them, most likely screw-type dis-
locations. In general, dislocations are potential breakdown paths, since they are
charged due to dangling bonds in the dislocation core and by attracting impurit-
ies [145]. It has been shown that improving the material quality, namely, reducing
the dislocation density, increases the breakdown ﬁeld strength, enabling higher
operation voltages at identical ﬁlm thicknesses for diﬀerent layer qualities, as

vertically through a grounded substrate (3).
shown in Fig. 3.16, where a maximum breakdown ﬁeld strength of 150 V/μm or
1.5 · 106 V/cm has been achieved [36].
Apart from the material quality the layer thickness limits the breakdown
voltage. Si has an about an order-of-magnitude lower breakdown ﬁeld strength
[37] and is, compared to GaN, highly conductive. For GaN on Si three breakdown
paths have been observed (Fig. 3.15). When the device is mounted with an
insulating layer below (ﬂoating substrate), the substrate breakdown occurs via
two paths. Path 1 is between the contacts, which can be along the surface or
laterally in the device-layer structure. This is the common breakdown path for
small contact distances, also for devices mounted with a grounded substrate.
The breakdown voltage along this path is strongly inﬂuenced by the material
quality. Although dislocations propagate vertically and should not interfere with
the device properties they do inﬂuence the breakdown ﬁeld strength. Details of
this mechanism are not well understood. One explanation might be a vertical
breakdown path (2 or 3), even for small contact distances. In addition, it has not
yet been veriﬁed if lateral dislocation networks, which appear in the case of lattice
relaxation and are part of strain-engineering layers, are possible breakdown paths
lowering the breakdown voltage. If this is the case, buﬀer-layer design has to be
reconsidered for many device structures.
Path 2 is the breakdown path observed for contact distances approximately
larger than twice the group-III-nitride thickness. Here, breakdown is vertical
through the buﬀer layer into the substrate, which usually is not highly insulating
and has a low-breakdown ﬁeld strength. Thus the substrate can be also treated
as a shortening between the GaN regions below the top contacts. This path leads
to a saturation of the breakdown voltage even at larger contact distances, as in
Fig. 3.16. For insulating substrates this path does not exist as well as the third
breakdown path. This is simple vertical breakdown through the group-III-nitride
layer and the substrate to ground. For contact distances up to approximately
10 μm, a distance which is still enabling low-resistance devices, the insulation of

Fig. 3.16. Buﬀer breakdown of FET structures without an active AlGaN layer
and diﬀerent contact distance. The breakdown voltage increases with increas-
ing distance and saturates at a value depending on buﬀer quality. In addition
to this saturation, the slope for small contact distances diﬀers in dependence
of the material properties. Here, high-quality buﬀer layers enable smaller
contact distances and higher breakdown voltages.
the substrate (not grounded) nearly doubles the breakdown voltage for layers up
to 5 μm in thickness. Although thicker layers enable high breakdown voltages
even with the substrate grounded, they are more costly and more diﬃcult to
manufacture due to wafer bow and possible plastic substrate deformation.
In addition to the current paths mentioned previously, additional lateral cur-
rent paths can originate in the usage of heterostructures for strain compensation
in the buﬀer. AlGaN and GaN are known to lead to 2DEGs at the lower and in
principle also 2DHGs at the upper interface for cation terminated (0001) GaN.
One possible solution is compensation doping with deep acceptors and deep
donors. At present, two dopants are applied for this purpose: carbon [146] and
iron. Iron is not very popular for processing in the Si industry due to the fear of
cross-contamination, while carbon doping usually requires non-standard growth
conditions. It is not yet certain that these growth conditions are well-suited to
achieve a high material quality, thus in general Fe doping provides more freedom
with regard to the growth parameters. Although Fe does not diﬀuse signiﬁcantly
in GaN but shows memory eﬀects in many MOVPE reactors. Therefore, doping
should be stopped early, before the intentionally undoped region of the buﬀer
layer interferes with the active region of the device.
Most devices presented to date are based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.
They usually consist of a GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, of which the last
GaN layer is an approximately 3-nm thick capping layer. Also, SiN has been
applied as a capping and passivating layer [147]. Simple AlGaN/GaN FETs are

106
Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
normally-on or depletion-mode FETs. Here, without an applied gate voltage the
2DEG is not depleted below the gate, and current ﬂows even at zero voltage
applied to the gate. For many applications this is an unwanted property, not
being fail-safe and potentially dangerous if a circuit failure enables high current
ﬂow through the device. Thus a lot of eﬀorts are nowadays focusing on normally-
oﬀor enhancement-mode FETs which can be operated in a fail-safe mode. Several
concepts exist to realize such devices. A p-GaN buﬀer [148] or an insulating buﬀer
[149] was applied by Yoshida et al. for high-power operation of an AlGaN/GaN
FET on Si. Alternatively, the AlGaN layer can be grown thin [150] or partially
or fully removed below the gate contact [151, 152]. As a consequence the missing
polarization charges will deplete the 2DEG below the contact, and no current
can ﬂow. Also, ﬂuorine implantation was applied [153] or partial removal of an
in situ grown SiN capping layer [154]. Until now there is no well-established
technique for enhancement-mode FETs.
HV devices are predicted to replace Si devices in the voltage range from
300 to 1200 V, and devices with breakdown voltages above 700 V [146, 155,
156] have already been demonstrated. At higher voltages the device cost can
be suﬃciently low to compete with Si especially being smaller than Si-based
devices. By enabling higher operation frequencies in power supplies they enable
a higher eﬃciency, making them attractive for mass production. At present, all
devices are usually based on GaN/AlGaN, but with AlInN replacing AlGaN,
group-III-nitride-based FETs might become even more attractive for HV-FET
applications. AlInN can be grown lattice-matched, potentially reducing device
failure during operation. In addition to the lattice-matched case, as well as for
higher Al contents, it enables a factor of two higher electron concentrations in
the 2DEG [157, 158] nowadays, also at carrier mobilities similar or only slightly
lower than for GaN/AlGaN [159], and thus a much lower channel resistance. This
can lower the resistance of the device or enable smaller devices, and by this, an
even lower cost. GaN/AlN heterostructures oﬀer the best option with regard to
high electron concentrations and high mobilities, but they are diﬃcult to grow
and highly strained, potentially leading to early device failure.

Limits of GaN-on-Si MOVPE technology and new developments
Limitations of a technology are very often not real limitations in the long term,
even when arguments as basic physics are put up. Quite often it turns out that
they are only in the head of the arguer that makes a technology limited. E.g.,
at the end of the 1990s GaN on Si was commonly believed to be always full of
cracks for thicker layers as required for devices, and also that it is highly doped
with Si diﬀusing from the substrate into the layer as known from the group-
III arsenides [160]. Both have been proven wrong: cracks can be eliminated by
strain engineering, though it was argued that thermal expansion coeﬃcients do
not allow this and Si does not diﬀuse [161, 162] but forms a stable nitride on
the non-group-III-nitride covered surface that blocks diﬀusion as discussed in

Section 3.3. Consequently, limitations are not necessarily general limitations,
and scientists always try to push the limit further.
After a short summary of currently known limitations or problems we will
show research examples of some of them apart from the current mainstream of
research for GaN on Si.
3.8.1
Limits of GaN-on-Si MOVPE technology
There are numerous limits of the technology which apply only to GaN on Si, or
at least to a larger degree, some of them have been mentioned in the previous
chapters:
• Requirement of strain-engineering layers, limitation of uninterrupted GaN
thickness, at present 4 μm [75].
• Thick layers require compressive prestress, leading to plastic substrate
deformation [33, 36].
• Compressive prestress leads to signiﬁcant wafer bow which leads to homo-
geneity problems for large wafer diameters in cold-wall MOVPE systems.
• Al-rich seeding layers obstruct low-resistance Si/Al(Ga,In)N/GaN junctions
[40].
• Al-rich seeding layers and Al-rich interlayers lead to higher thermal resist-
ance [163].
• High-resistance

There are possibly many more limitations of the technology on Si, as there are
limitations on all heterosubstrates. In our view these are the most important for
GaN on Si technology currently limiting device design and upscaling to large
substrate diameters. Nevertheless, many high-performance devices can be real-
ized on silicon substrates, and the initial success of LEDs on Si and also as
key technology enabling low-cost GaN HV-FETs demonstrates that the limit of
GaN on Si can be pushed much further than ﬁrst anticipated or even expected
to be achievable at all. Thus new developments, some seeming more as academic
fun-work, ﬁnally might lead to real applications. Some new developments on Si
substrates are presented in the next section, from material growth research work
closely related to the present mainstream of semi-polar research, to topics which
are less intensely studied, such as photovoltaic solar cells and GaN on Si for
micro-electro-mechanical systems.

New developments
3.8.2.1
Semipolar GaN
Semi- and non-polar GaN has been an active ﬁeld of
research in recent years. For light emitters in the green-to-orange wavelength
region it is thought to be beneﬁcial because high In-content quantum wells are
less or not impacted by the quantum-conﬁned Stark eﬀect (QCSE) which is

108
Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
strongest along the piezoelectric c-axis. It has been demonstrated to be espe-
cially useful for laser devices—in particular, cladding-free lasers were realized
[164]—but with the absence of the QCSE to reach longer wavelengths higher
In-content QWs are required, making epitaxial growth more demanding. E.g.,
it has been demonstrated that high In-content layers are impacted by stacking
fault generation due to lattice relaxation [165]. Apart from small-sized high-
quality m-plane and semipolar bulk substrates cut from thick c-axis oriented
GaN boules, larger-sized non- or semipolar layers are currently usually grown on
heterosubstrates. But direct growth on heterosubstrates typically leads to stack-
ing faults which degrade device performance. One way to circumvent this is to
use growth methods which apply lateral (usually c-axis oriented) growth where
stacking faults are not present or only in the N-polar -c direction. On silicon
this has been demonstrated successfully by the group led by Sawaki which shows
high-quality layers free or virtually free from stacking faults on low-cost Si. For
this the Si substrates are etched prior to growth, so that inclined Si(111) facets
occur on which c-axis-oriented GaN is grown. Due to the inclination versus the
surface normal semi- or non-polar layers are achieved. The method yields very
low stacking fault and dislocation densities, and is very well suited for polar-
ization reduced device growth [166]. With this method one can grow semipolar
GaN(1¯101) on 7◦oﬀ-oriented Si(001) [167], GaN(11¯22) on Si(113) [168, 169], and
non-polar (11¯20) GaN on a (110) Si substrate [170].
As an alternative to this method, Ravash and coworkers have demonstrated
that also on planar Si substrates, GaN with inclination angles up to approx-
imately 25◦can be grown. This corresponds to a reduction of the polarization
in growth direction of approx. 50 % [171]. For this purpose, high-index Si as
Si(112) and Si(113) were used [172, 173] and a low-temperature AlN seeding
layer applied [174]. When using high-temperature AlN seeding layers only c-axis
oriented GaN can be grown [15, 174]. The surface of high-index Si substrates
inclined between the Si(001) and Si(111) orientation is thought to consist of
Si(001) and Si(111) sections [172, 175]. AlN growth on these high-index surfaces
seems to be preferred on the small Si(111) sections as c-axis-oriented AlN which
are inclined versus the surface normal. The growth process is diﬃcult to control,
because only thin AlN seeding layers lead to the wanted inclination and single
crystalline smooth layers. This again puts meltback etching, which is diﬃcult
to suppress with such thin seeding layers, into focus. Nevertheless, it is possible
to control this by using high-temperature AlN and especially AlGaN following
the seeding layer. Stacking faults are also present in these layers, but the use
of LT-AlN interlayers, also required for stress control, signiﬁcantly reduces their
density [176, 177]. It is expected that optimized interlayers can in general reduce
the density of stacking faults to values well below 104 cm−1 when an inclination
of the c-axis towards the [10¯10] direction is present, since dislocation elimin-
ation by this method works also for (10¯13) oriented GaN. Other methods to
reduce the stacking fault density have been presented in recent years, ranging
from graded AlN/AlGaN/GaN layers to avoid 3D growth, and by this reduce

stacking faults on SiC substrates [178] or ex situ-deposited Sc metal layers which
were subsequently nitridated [179]. However, they are not as eﬃcient, and are
more diﬃcult to apply in the case of ScN.
The mechanism of stacking-fault elimination by LT-AlN layers can be viewed
as an inverse process to stacking-fault generation in InGaN layers on m-planar
GaN, as described by Fischer et al. [165]. With AlN a material with a smaller
lattice constant is grown on GaN. When stacking faults of type I1 are present,
this AlN layer relaxes, preferably by eliminating I1 stacking faults. On the upper
interface to GaN, less relaxation takes place, leading to compressively strained
GaN, and only generating stacking faults of type I2 which can glide along the
basal plane and form small (less than 100 nm long) closed loops, which thus do
not impact the following layers (Fig. 3.17).

Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
3.8.2.2
Photovoltaic solar cells
GaN-based photovoltaic solar cells have been
discussed for quite some time. When alloying In, in principal the whole visible
solar spectrum plus near-UV and IR can be accessed for charge-carrier gener-
ation. Several concepts have been tested, mostly based on nanowires [180] or
quantum wells [181, 182]. QWs have the beneﬁt of possible strained growth but
the disadvantage of a low absorption volume. Bulk layers are diﬃcult to grow
without relaxation. Nevertheless, it is especially interesting to grow photovoltaic
solar cell layers on low-cost substrates. For this, silicon is the ideal cell material,
and in principle a simple tandem cell can be realized when growing InGaN with
In contents above 40%, which is expected to yield a conversion eﬃciency above
30% [183].
First, tests of direct InGaN growth on Si(111), which should result in a low-
contact resistance for p-Si/n-InGaN [41, 42], revealed that even at low growth
temperatures below 700◦C, meltback etching occurs. This eﬀect can be reduced
by applying a high In content AlInN seeding layer which suppresses a Ga–Si
reaction. Nevertheless, InGaN growth is still highly columnar and In droplet
formation diﬃcult to avoid (Fig. 3.18). Taking into account the low In pre-
cursor eﬃciency of today’s MOVPE growth systems, this approach requires
higher precursor eﬃciency to be competitive with other photovoltaic solar cell
approaches.
Until now only InGaN-based cells based on GaN buﬀer layers or InGaN
QWs have been realized. A GaN/Si tandem cell, however, was demonstrated

in this case with additional UV illumination to generate electron hole pairs in
the GaN top cell.
3.8.2.3
Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)
The main applications of
GaN-based MEMS are diﬀerent kinds of oscillators on Si. Here, usually thin bars
based on GaN/AlGaN structures are etched and the Si below them removed.
Depending on their geometry, these free-standing bars can vibrate at diﬀerent
frequencies and be used, e.g., for frequency ﬁltering [185]. Apart from these ap-
plications, GaN is also interesting for other devices where, e.g., high-temperature
operation or aggressive media are present. Such a device is a miniature high-
pressure sensor as demonstrated by Zimmermann et al. [186]. This miniature
sensor depends on a Si bar with a FET structure, and bending the bar changes
the carrier density and with it the resistance of the 2DEG, which is then measured
and is in principal suited for pressure measurements at high temperatures.
Another example of a MEMS device which generates energy and can be tuned
electrically is the balance spring of a watch (Fig. 3.19). These balance springs are
often manufactured from Si instead of metal by a dry etching process. Growing
c-axis-oriented AlN on top of such Si spiral spring surfaces yields additional
piezoelectric material which can be used to generate energy. Here the diﬃculty in
MOVPE growth lies in a required homogeneous coverage of the whole Si surface
with a c-axis-oriented group-III-nitride layer perpendicular to the surface which
cannot be achieved, e.g., by sputtering techniques. With this, piezoelectric layer
energy in the range of nanowatts can be generated, e.g., to charge electronics
which in return can correct the motion of the balance spring by applying a
voltage. This correction of the spring’s oscillation frequency by quartz-controlled

Epitaxial growth and beneﬁts of GaN on silicon
electronics can yield high accuracy in a mechanical watch. One can think of other
micro-oscillating devices where energy is gained and used to operate electronics
for other functions or oscillation control.
Especially in the ﬁeld of MEMS, many applications can be thought of which
make use of the piezo- and pyroelectric properties of the group-III-nitrides for
sensors, ﬁlters, or frequency tuning. Here the maturity of the Si technology is of
huge beneﬁt when it comes to etching special structures as free-standing group-
III-nitride layers or bars or thin Si layers which are subsequently overgrown, as
in the case of the spiral spring material.

The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
Ronny Kirste and Zlatko Sitar
4.1
Introduction
Tremendous eﬀorts have been made in the growth of bulk GaN and AlN over
the last decade. While the most recent results on GaN growth are presented in
Chapter 2, this chapter deals with the development of AlN crystals and wafers,
as well as AlN-based technology. After a short introduction on AlN bulk growth,
which emphasizes the need for high-quality substrates, three AlN growth meth-
ods are discussed: (1) sublimation/physical vapor transport (PVT), (2) hydride
vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), and (3) solution growth method. In this context,
the inﬂuence of diﬀerent process parameters, growth environment, and growth
seeds will be discussed. In addition, the optical and structural properties of bulk
AlN crystals obtained by the three methods are described. Since bulk AlN is
mainly used as a substrate, the properties of epitaxially overgrown thin AlN
and AlGaN layers will be discussed, thus demonstrating their superior quality
as compared to layers grown on non-native substrates, i.e., sapphire or SiC.
Promising applications based on AlGaN/AlN are presented in the framework
of LEDs and lasers emitting in the mid-ultraviolet or UVC wavelength regime
(200–280 nm). Finally, a brief outlook on the development of AlN-based techno-
logy is presented.
4.2
Bulk AlN: a pathway to high-quality AlGaN
Bulk AlN crystals are envisioned as a source of substrates for the growth of
devices using Al-rich AlxGa1−xN layers (x ≥0.7). These devices include UV
solid-state emitters (LEDs and LDs) and detectors in the 200–280 nm range,
high-power switches needed in power conversion devices, and high-frequency
devices for application in radar and communication technologies.
Figure 4.1 gives an overview of possible applications of UV LEDs and lasers
based on AlGaN. These applications include solid-state lighting by using a phos-
phorous converter, sensing and detection (protein analysis, drug detection, cell
imaging, security features for currency and documents), lithography, and disin-
fection and water puriﬁcation (based on the absorption peak of DNA at 254 nm).
In addition to these optoelectronic devices, electronic devices based on high-
Al-content AlGaN, although in the nascent development stages, show much
potential:

• High-power electronics. Based on the large bandgap of AlN, this material
has an extremely high electric breakdown ﬁeld of ∼20 MV/cm, making it an
excellent candidate for electrical devices operating at high voltage/power [1].
• Radiation hard devices and radiation detectors. AlN is extremely radiation
hard. Devices based on this material are only marginally harmed by hard
radiation [2].
• High-temperature devices. AlN is thermally stable and oﬀers a high thermal
conductivity (320 W/mK) [3].
It is well recognized that high-quality AlGaN can be enabled only by large-
area native substrates. Technologically feasible solutions are the use of native
GaN and AlN substrates for low and high Al-content AlGaN, respectively, since
only a low lattice mismatch combined with a low dislocation density in the
substrate enables low dislocation densities in epitaxial grown AlGaN layers.
However, due to a signiﬁcant lattice mismatch between AlN and GaN, neither of
the substrates can cover the growth of the full spectrum of AlGaN compositions.
An overview of the properties and parameters of typical substrates used for
the growth of AlGaN is given in Table 4.1. These include sapphire, SiC, and Si,
as well as the native substrates, GaN and AlN. Due to diﬀerent lattice sizes and
thermal expansion coeﬃcients of substrates and AlGaN layers, the layers could
be strained, relaxed by forming extended defects, or, in the worst case, even
cracked. The lattice mismatch between the layer and substrate is given by [4]:

Apart from the low lattice mismatch for high Al-content AlGaN layers, AlN
uniquely unites high thermal conductivity, high breakdown voltage, and chemical
inertness, which alone would beneﬁt many devices.
4.3
Growth of AlN crystals
Originally, AlN was synthesized in 1862 by Briegleb and Geuther by heating
aluminum ﬁllings under nitrogen gas ﬂow. Due to an increase of weight, they
concluded that Al and N had reacted to form AlN [10]. First attempts towards
real crystal growth of this compound were made much later by Slack et al. in the
1970s. They suggested growth via sublimation in a closed tungsten crucible or in
an open tube with a gas ﬂow [11]. These experiments resulted in millimeter-sized
AlN crystals. Later, these experiments were extended to grow AlN crystals by
the Al pellet drop method in a tungsten crucible in an rf-heated tungsten furnace
under a nitrogen atmosphere [12]. The resultant crystals were of up to 1 cm in
length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Very few new eﬀorts in AlN crystal growth were
undertaken in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. However, shortly after
the successful p-doping of GaN and the ﬁrst available GaN-based LEDs, there
was increased interest in AlN [13]. This led to a renaissance of layer and later
bulk growth of AlN at the end of the 1990s [14].
The three major approaches for the growth of bulk AlN crystals that have
been exploited are:

124
The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
• Sublimation or physical vapor transport (PVT).
• Hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE).
• Growth from solutions.
Currently, the most promising method appears to be PVT in combination
with AlN seeding. While solution growth and HVPE basically result in the
growth of thick layers, PVT provides voluminous bulk crystals of high quality.
Furthermore, only PVT can produce suﬃciently large native seeds for subsequent
crystal growth, which is crucial for high-quality AlN bulk crystals.
4.3.1
Physical vapor transport
For PVT or sublimation growth, AlN-powder (source) is sublimed at temper-
atures above 2000◦C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Due to a temperature gradient
between the source and seed, aluminum and nitrogen atoms recondense on the
seed and form an AlN bulk crystal. A schematic of a reactor for growth via PVT
is shown in Fig. 4.2.
AlN powder is contained in a crucible (source). The crucible is inductively
heated and due to the high applied temperature (>2000◦C), the AlN is non-
congruently sublimed:
AlN solid ↔Algas + 1
2N gas
2
(4.2)
On the opposite side of the crucible, a seed is positioned which is heated to
temperatures slightly lower than the source. Due to the thermal gradient, the
sublimed gas molecules from the source will diﬀuse towards the seed and lead
to the growth of AlN via a reverse reaction. It is crucial that both the source
and seed temperatures are controlled and highly stable for the duration of the
crystal growth process (50–100 hours).
In general, vaporization of Al could be taken into account as the source for
the Al-gas (growth via vaporization). However, attempts using vaporization of
Al-metal instead of sublimation of AlN demonstrated that this method was not
suitable for long-term growth, since the Al-metal source in these experiments
was quickly covered with an AlN crust (due to the presence of nitrogen) which
hindered further vaporization of Al and, thus, suppressed the growth rate of
AlN [16].
The crucible with the AlN powder (Al-source) is typically heated by in-
duction. The temperature is measured with a pyrometer (Fig. 4.2). Possible
temperatures for the growth of AlN close to atmospheric pressure cover a broad
range from 1800◦C up to 2500◦C. The lower limit is determined by the temper-
ature when nitrogen and aluminum start to react signiﬁcantly. For temperatures
below 1800◦C, no signiﬁcant reaction takes place, hindering the growth of any
crystals. The upper limit for the AlN crystal growth near the atmospheric pres-
sure is given by the boiling point of Al. At atmospheric pressure and temperatures

above 2500◦C, AlN is not stable and decomposes. In order to allow for higher
temperatures, some attempts were made to grow AlN at elevated nitrogen pres-
sures of up to 1 GPa [17]. Although the ﬁrst results were promising, little progress
has been made over the past few years in the high-pressure growth of AlN. Thus,
most current eﬀorts focus on growth at near-atmospheric pressure. Thereby, little
inﬂuence of the pressure on the growth has been observed [16]. Despite the fact
that bulk AlN crystals can be grown at temperatures as low as 1800◦C, temper-
atures around 2200◦C are more favorable in order to achieve high growth rates
and good crystal quality [11, 16]. In addition to temperature, the temperature
gradient between the source and seed is an important parameter for the control
of transport and growth rate. Typical values for the temperature gradient are
around 50◦C/cm. With these reactor parameters, growth rates in the c-direction
between 50 μm/h (1800◦C), and 1 mm/h (2300◦C) can be achieved [15, 16].
However, high growth rates may lead to a reduced crystal quality so that growth

126
The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
rates are usually maintained at several hundred μm/hour. Taking these control-
lable parameters (pressure, temperature, temperature gradient) into account in
a one-dimensional model, the growth rate of an AlN crystal can be described
by [18]:
vg = k exp

ΔS −ΔH
T

RT 1.2p1.5
ΔT
δ
(4.3)
Here, vg is the growth rate, p is the total pressure, T is the temperature, ΔT/δ
is the temperature gradient between the AlN source and seed, R is the universal
gas constant, S is the entropy, and H the enthalpy. The pre-exponential term k
is an adjustable parameter containing the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Al in nitrogen.
Not many materials are suitable for crucibles for PVT growth of AlN, as not
many materials withstand temperatures >2200◦C. In addition, crucibles must
be inert to the reaction with the Al vapor at high temperature, not a source of
substantial contamination, reusable, and available in the shape and size needed
for the growth. These demands drastically decrease the number of possible can-
didates. Several materials have been tested, including graphite- and boron-based
conglomerates, pure tungsten, tantalum, and TaC [14, 16, 19, 20]. Graphite cru-
cibles have been used at low temperatures, but are generally unsuitable for AlN
growth at higher temperatures due to the formation of the volatile aluminum
carbide, which causes quick deterioration of the crucible. Any B-containing com-
pound introduces enough B into the vapor phase to poison the growth surface,
which inhibits the growth in the non-polar directions [16]. So far, the best results
have been obtained with crucibles made of tungsten and TaC [21].
Following the reaction schemes presented above, the only source materials
needed for the PVT growth of AlN are Al and nitrogen. The nitrogen source
typically is ultra-high purity grade molecular nitrogen. AlN powder is used as
a source of Al almost exclusively, but the commercially available AlN powder
contains several impurities and surface contaminants, mainly oxygen, carbon,
silicon, and hydroxides. In order to reduce the impurity levels in the AlN source
powder, several groups suggested annealing, recrystallization, or the use of larger
AlN blocks [14, 19].
4.3.2
Hydrid vapor phase epitaxy
In HVPE, the growth of thick AlN layers is enabled via a chemical reaction
of aluminum chloride gas and ammonia, and was demonstrated by various
groups [22–24]. This reaction takes place in a temperature-controlled furnace
at a relatively low temperature (900–1100◦C), leading to high-purity AlN de-
posits. The growth rate by this method is about one tenth of that obtained by
PVT, but the control of unwanted impurities is easier due to a considerably lower
deposition temperature. A schematic drawing of the HVPE process is displayed
in Fig. 4.3.

HVPE growth is typically performed at temperatures in the range of
900–1100◦C and more recently at temperatures up to 1400◦C, which is much
lower than those used for PVT growth, strongly reducing the demands for the
reactor parts. Reactor tubes are often made of quartz glass, and the substrate
is resistively heated. It is crucial that Al is supplied as AlCl3, as any unsatur-
ated Al clorides attack quartz hardware. Although cheaper and easier to handle,
this reactor construction may introduce some limitations for high-temperature
growth with HVPE.
Only a small inﬂuence of the temperature on the growth rate of AlN was
observed. When the growth temperature was increased from 950◦C to 1100◦C
an increase of the growth rate from 0.9 to 1.7 μm/h was demonstrated [22]. This
constant growth rate, practically independent of the temperature, proves that
the growth mainly takes place in the mass transport limited regime [26]. It was
emphasized that temperatures on the order of 1400◦C are necessary to obtain
crystals of higher quality [27]. In order to achieve these temperatures, Nagashima
et al. modiﬁed an HVPE reactor by combining a conventional hot-wall type
furnace and a heated susceptor with an integrated heating element [26]. Using
this modiﬁed reactor, growth temperatures between 1200◦C and 1400◦C were
reached. Still, the growth rates were independent of temperature and reached up
to 85 μm/h by increasing the supply of precursors. Since the growth of AlN via
HVPE is in the mass transport limited regime, the main parameter inﬂuencing
the growth rate is the AlCl3 input pressure, presenting the supply of Al. Indeed,

128
The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
several works demonstrated a linear correlation between the AlCl3 input pressure
and growth rate [22, 26]. Using high input pressures of 2·10−3 atm, growth rates
as high as 122 μm/h were achieved [22]. However, growth rates above 30 μm/h led
to poor crystal quality, as observed by the FWHM of XRD rocking curves [26, 28].
4.3.3
Solution growth
In the solution-growth method, a seed is introduced into an Al/N-containing
solution, mostly under a nitrogen atmosphere [29]. Since the growth from the
solution method takes place close to the thermal equilibrium, AlN crystals of
very high quality can be expected. However, only very few eﬀorts were made for
the growth of AlN via this method, which produced small crystals [29–31].
Figure 4.4 shows a schematic of the setup for solution growth. A seed, which
is mounted on a rotating shaft, is introduced into a solution containing Al and
N. For the seed, high-quality AlN bulk crystals must be used. When the seed
is dipped into the solution, Al and nitrogen atoms are expected to deposit onto
the seed.
The reaction scheme for the solution growth depends primarily on the chosen
solvent. Originally, Ca3N2 was chosen as the nitrogen source and AlN powder as
the Al-source [30]. In this case, the following reaction scheme can be assumed [32]:
Ca3N2 + 2Al ↔3Ca + 2AlN
(4.6)
Other prospective solvents include NaN3, Be3N2, Mg3N2, and Li3N, whereby
Kangawa et al. concluded from theoretical calculations that Li3N has a high
potential for the solution growth method, since it combines both low melting
point and high probability of nitrogen supply [32]. So far, crystals grown by
the solution method have been rather small and of relatively poor quality. With
growth rates around 0.5 μm/h, up to 5-μm thick AlN layers were grown on
AlN/SiC [33]. Higher growth rates of up to 10 μm/h were reported, but the defect
density in these crystals drastically increased [32]. Based on general requirements
for the solvents, which include suﬃcient solubility of Al, thermal stability, a low
melting point, and the feasibility of separating the solvent from the grown AlN

crystals [30], in addition to nitrogen-containing compounds, Sn–Ca or Cu–Al–Ti
were also proposed [29, 31].
The growth temperature for solution growth is typically much lower than that
of sublimation growth (around 1100◦C), drastically lowering the demands and
stress for the experimental setup. However, for solvents with a high melting point
or when a higher temperature was desired in order to improve crystal quality,
growth temperatures as high as 1600–1800◦C were applied [29, 30].
Despite its appeal from the thermodynamic standpoint, the solution-growth
method faces many unresolved challenges. Of the three growth methods discussed
in this review, the solution growth is the least developed, and future work will
have to ﬁnd practical solutions to all the challenges and ultimately prove the
potential of this growth method.
4.3.4
Seeding of AlN crystal growth
The structural quality of the grown AlN crystals obtained by a particular method
depends directly on the type and quality of seed crystals. Seed crystals are needed
to provide structural information for the condensing Al and N atoms, including
polarity and orientation. Over the years, two approaches to seeding have been
used in AlN crystal growth: (1) foreign seeds like SiC, and (2) native AlN seeds.
The ﬁrst approach is convenient and provides “instant gratiﬁcation” as SiC is
readily available in diﬀerent sizes, but severely limits crystal quality due to lattice
and thermal mismatch (results in dislocation density in the 106–107/cm2 range),
while the second approach provides initially small but very-high-quality crys-
tals with dislocation density <103/cm2. Since native AlN seeds are not readily
available, the second approach necessitates initially two steps: (1) production of
seed crystals by spontaneous nucleation, and (2) seeded growth coupled with
controlled and gradual expansion of single crystalline boules, which provide
increasingly larger and larger seeds and wafers of high quality.
First attempts with seeded growth were made with SiC crystals. 6H-SiC was
chosen due to its relatively high-temperature stability, enabling high-temperature
growth, and reasonably small diﬀerences in the lattice constant and thermal
expansion coeﬃcient to those of AlN (see Table 4.1). However, growth on SiC
seeds is still highly mismatched heteroepitaxy, generating copious defects and
strain at the heteroepitaxial interface. The ﬁrst results for SiC seeded growth
were presented in 1996 by Balkas et al. [34]. The crystals grown during these ﬁrst
attempts showed cracks and incorporation of Si and C. An extensive theoretical
investigation of the strain in AlN on 6H-SiC revealed that the diﬀerence in the
thermal expansion coeﬃcients in combination with the high growth temperatures
was responsible for cracking [35]. In addition, this study predicted that AlN on
SiC needs to be at least 2 mm thick in order to prevent cracking during the cool-
down (assuming a growth temperature of 2000◦C). So far, the only possibility
to avoid cracking seems to be the formation of voids [33, 36, 37]. AlN bulk
crystals grown on SiC seeds can reach dislocation densities down to the 106/cm2
range, which is close to the theoretical limit predicted for a mismatched epitaxial

130
The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
system. SiC has been used in both PVT and HVPE [28, 37, 38]. In addition to
SiC, sapphire has been widely exploited, especially in HVPE [22, 26, 39]. Thereby,
similar problems in defect management as with SiC occurred.
Since native AlN seeds were not available at the onset of AlN crystal
growth eﬀorts, initial attempts to grow voluminous crystals were made by self-
seeding [12]. For self-seeding, a small growth target was used, typically a conical
tube, to limit the number of stable nuclei [40]. Due to the limited space in the
target zone and grain competition, a few or even a single crystalline nucleus sur-
vived, which acted as a self-seeded base for further crystal growth. However, due
to the randomness of the grain selection process, and constrained growth envir-
onment, the resultant crystals were small, randomly oriented, and had relatively
high dislocation density [40, 41].
Native AlN seeds are paramount for high-quality crystals and wafers. These
seeds are typically obtained by spontaneous nucleation and growth of Lely-like,
c-oriented platelets close to equilibrium conditions [21]. The ﬁrst results of bulk
growth of AlN on native seeds were presented in 2002 by Schlesser et al. [16].
These ﬁrst attempts resulted in transparent crystals with XRD rocking curve
FWHMs as low as 25 arcsec. No cracking was observed. By establishing a proced-
ure which includes the growth of an AlN boule, cutting and polishing a wafer from
that boule, and subsequent regrowth on that wafer, Noveski et al. established a
procedure which led to increased native seed size over time [42]. Using this pro-
cedure, commercially available wafers with diameters exceeding 25 mm were
grown, whereby a further size increase is in progress [21]. Occasionally, boules
with diameters of up to 50 mm have been demonstrated experimentally, but little
is known about their quality and they are not available commercially [43].
Very recently, the ﬁrst results of HVPE-grown AlN on PVT-grown substrates
were presented [44]. These experiments tried to combine the advantages of PVT
and HVPE by exploiting the high crystalline quality achieved by PVT with the
high controllability of point defect incorporation in the HVPE growth. Indeed,
using this combination, the growth of UV-transparent crystals with a dislocation
density comparable to that of the PVT substrates was demonstrated. Despite
the fact that native seeding has proven superior to SiC seeds, this technique is
used mainly in the PVT growth. Due to the lack of native seeds on the market,
the HVPE and solution growth methods still rely mainly on the growth on SiC
or sapphire. This is solely based on the fact that, so far, only a couple of PVT
groups world-wide were able to yield large enough, high-quality seeds to make
the seeded growth process using native AlN seeds self-sustaining.

Properties of state-of-the-art bulk AlN
The properties of bulk AlN crystals are determined by the used seeds, purity
of the source materials, reactor parts, and growth conditions. Diﬀerent point
defects (native and impurities) and extended defects may be incorporated into
the AlN crystals, which inﬂuence their structural and optical properties.

4.4.1
Structural properties
The structural quality of bulk AlN is strongly dependent on the applied growth
conditions. High crystal quality may refer to low defect concentration (with
less focus on point defects and more focus on extended defects such as dislo-
cations) and low strain. Methods to investigate the structural properties include
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and X-ray topography, Raman spectroscopy, transmis-
sion electron microscopy (TEM), and etching experiments in conjunction with
optical microscopy.
An easy yet eﬀective method to probe the quality of crystals is X-ray diﬀrac-
tion (XRD) [45]. This method is widely used, since it is fast, non-destructive,
and reliable. Typically, a rocking curve of the (002)-diﬀraction peak is analyzed.
Results from asymmetric scans are not often found in literature, as most authors
compare only the rocking curves of the (002)-peak to enable a fast assessment
of the samples.
For the ﬁrst AlN bulk crystals grown by PVT for which XRD data were avail-
able, the FWHM of the (002)-peak may be estimated to a few hundred arcsec.
Following these ﬁrst results, the FWHM steadily decreased as crystal quality
improved, and is more recently quoted in the low teens [21]. However, this value
depends greatly on seeding, as discussed previously, and higher values for the
FWHM of the (002)-peak exceeding half a degree may still be found in liter-
ature [46]. Typical XRD rocking curves of the (002)-peak of PVT-grown AlN
are displayed in Fig. 4.5 [21]. The FWHM of the sharpest peak is denoted as
13 arcsec. This spectrum was recorded from a wafer cut from the top part of
a boule. The other two spectra were recorded from wafers cut from the same
boule but in the middle and at the bottom, respectively. A strong decrease of

The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
the FWHM of the (002)-peak is observed toward the top of the boule. This is
interpreted as an increasing crystalline quality of the boule with ongoing growth.
The origin of this behavior is presumably due to reduced stress and higher uni-
formity of the growth conditions during later stages of the growth [21]. Using
XRD, the dislocation density of PVT-grown AlN crystals on native seeds can
be calculated to 106/cm2 [46–48]. For crystals of lower dislocation density, other
methods have to be used.
Currently, bulk AlN crystals grown by HVPE on SiC may reach FWHMs
of the (002)-peak as low as 40 arcsec [28]. Calculating the dislocation densities
for such samples highlights values of 106–107/cm2 [22, 28]. These dislocation
densities are close to the theoretical limit that can be achieved for foreign seeding.
A further reduction of the dislocation density can be expected only if native seeds
are used in HVPE [44].
Analyzing the FWHM of XRD peaks is indirect and applicable only to the
samples with high dislocation density. Dislocations in AlN have been directly
observed by X-ray topography and TEM. Figure 4.6 (left) displays a bright-ﬁeld
image of an AlN crystal with a dislocation density of 108/cm2. Furthermore,
some dislocation bending is observed. This can be understood as a strain relief
mechanism [49].
For dislocation densities below 103/cm2, X-ray topography must be used.
Furthermore, using this technique, other defects such as cracks, inclusions, and
scratches can be easily identiﬁed and counted [50, 51]. An X-ray topography
image of a PVT-grown AlN crystal with low dislocation density is displayed
in Fig. 4.6 (right). In addition, diﬀerent types of defects are marked. Using this

technique a dislocation density as low as 800–1000/cm2 has been determined [50].
In addition, the authors were able to show that the distribution of the dis-
locations, as well of that of inclusions (density of the order of 105/cm3), was
inhomogeneous, with large areas of the wafer nearly free from dislocations. This
suggests that TEM has only limited usability if used for the determination of
dislocation densities in high-quality AlN crystals.
Another method which is easy to perform is wet KOH-etching and sub-
sequent investigation with an optical microscope or scanning electron microscope
(SEM) [52]. This method is based on the fact that AlN is an anisotropic crystal
in which diﬀerent crystallographic planes etch with diﬀerent etching rates. This
makes it possible to distinguish between low-angle grain boundaries, dislocations,
polishing scratches, and others [46, 47]. However, this method will not allow a
distinction between threading edge and screw dislocations. After the etching, the
visible dislocations may be counted (etch pit density—EPD) and projected to
the whole wafer to calculate the defect density. Using this method, dislocation
densities of PVT-grown crystals of 104/cm2 were determined [46].
4.4.2
Optical properties and impurities
In general, the optical properties below the bandgap of bulk AlN crystals are
determined by the incorporation of point defects, i.e., vacancies and substi-
tutional atoms. For the latter, oxygen, silicon, carbon, and hydrogen are the
dominating species. This ﬁnding is explained by the fact that these materials
are often involved in the growth process, either as a part of the source material
(hydrogen, oxygen, silicon) or in the crucible or reactor parts (silicon, carbon,
oxygen). Typical methods used to investigate the optical properties are absorp-
tion/transmission measurements and luminescence. Defect concentrations can be
determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) or positron annihilation
spectroscopy (vacancies).
Although pure AlN is expected to be transparent down to ∼200 nm [53],
even high-quality AlN crystals show some degree of coloration which ranges
from transparent, yellow, orange, or brown, to even black (opaque), indicating
absorption centers around 2.1 eV and higher [54, 55]. A typical crystal is shown
in Fig. 4.7 [21].
While the color itself gives a ﬁrst impression of the optical properties in
the visible part of the spectrum, more detailed analyses are needed to determ-
ine the location of absorption centers. For this purpose, standard transmission/
absorption experiments are often used.
Absorption spectra of bulk AlN crystals grown by PVT in a tungsten furnace
are shown in Fig. 4.8 [55]. A few absorption centers below the band gap can
be observed. These absorption centers deﬁne the color of the crystal. While
the main absorption for yellowish or brownish crystals starts around 2.0 eV,
crystals transparent in the visible have only a very weak absorption in that
region (orange curve in Fig. 4.8). In the UV region, additional absorption bands

are observed with an onset around 3.2 eV. These absorption bands may be very
broad, and stretch up to an energy around 5.4 eV. The strong absorption at
higher energies is related to the band-edge of AlN (∼6 eV). In a ﬁrst approach,
four major absorption bands can be identiﬁed that are observed in most AlN
crystals. An overview of the positions, onset, and the possible origin of these
absorption centers is given in Table 4.2.
The center at around 2.8 eV is responsible for absorption in the red-to-green
region. One of the ﬁrst explanations for this center was given by Slack et al.,
who explained it as either related to a nitrogen vacancy or carbon [12]. These

ﬁndings were based on chemical analysis and evaluation of the growth conditions.
With the beginning of the renaissance of bulk AlN growth in the late 1990s,
this explanation was ﬁrst conﬁrmed by Bickerman et al. but later disputed by
Sedhain et al. [56, 58]. The latter explained the absorption at 2.8 eV as an ex-
citation from the valence band to an electronic state of an aluminum vacancy
(VAl). The contribution of Al vacancies to absorption in that region seems to be
reasonable, since especially in yellow crystals, very high vacancy concentrations
were detected by positron annihilation spectroscopy in bulk AlN crystals [59].
Additionally, the electronic state of such vacancies was calculated to be
2.1–2.5 eV above the valence band [62]. However, the most recent investiga-
tions assume that oxygen, which is also one of the most likely impurities in AlN,
may be involved [55]. The observations and explanations for the absorption cen-
ter around 3.6 eV are comparable to that of the center at 2.8 eV. It is typically
explained by a transition between an Al vacancy and the conduction band or a
shallow donor [55, 59].
The two UV absorption bands with absorption coeﬃcients often well above
100 cm−1 are of high technological interest, as AlN crystals are envisaged as
substrates for UV LEDs and LDs in the range of 200–280 nm. Since most LEDs
are based on light extraction through the back side (substrate), a strong absorp-
tion center in this spectral region will hinder successful application. Originally,
the occurrence of the UV absorption bands was explained by oxygen [12, 56].
Furthermore, it was assumed that both absorption bands in the UV are con-
nected, since the center shifted from 4.3 to 4.7 eV with increasing oxygen
contamination in the samples [63]. Later, this model included an Al vacancy
(VAl), so that the UV absorption was explained as a transition from VAl to
oxygen [20]. This explanation was based on the observation that AlN with UV
absorption centers often had a high amount of oxygen incorporated. But with
ongoing exploration of AlN and progress in the control of the growth, it was
demonstrated that the oxygen level is relatively high in most samples (1018 cm−3,
see Fig. 4.10) while these crystals do not necessarily exhibit an UV absorption
band. On the other hand, some samples with low oxygen contamination were
found to have a strong UV absorption. Recently, more detailed investigations
demonstrated that either both, or at least the high-energy UV absorption bands,

136
The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
can be fully explained by the substitutional carbon impurity. Indications for
carbon as the origin of the UV absorption were found by Bickermann et al., who
showed an unusually high carbon amount in samples with low oxygen contam-
ination and UV luminescence [60]. This ﬁnding was later conﬁrmed by Collazo
et al. [61]. In this work it was demonstrated that the UV absorption strongly
declined for samples with a decreasing carbon level. This ﬁnding was supported
by theoretical DFT calculations, which predicted a carbon-related absorption
band above 4 eV.
The counterparts to the absorption measurements are luminescence invest-
igations (photoluminescence—PL or cathodoluminescence—CL). Typically, ﬁve
below-band-gap luminescence bands are observed in bulk AlN crystals: 320 nm
(3.9 eV), 340 nm (3.65 eV), 400 nm (3.1 eV), 460 nm (2.7 eV), and 600 nm
(2.1 eV). The most energetic luminescence (3.9 eV) was assigned to the absorp-
tion center at 4.7 eV [61]. Thus, its origin is connected to the incorporation of
carbon. The emissions at 340 nm and 400 nm are often the strongest defect
related luminescence signals and seem to be well understood. For these lumin-
escence lines, a connection to oxygen is discussed [2, 58, 64]. This is based on
a broad range of investigations including afterglow and time-resolved behavior.
A more detailed model involves an oxygen impurity and Al vacancy (VAl-O),
whereby this explanation is widely accepted [65]. For the emission at 460 nm,
very little is known. Many authors observed similar behavior of this luminescence
band to that centered around 400 nm and some dependence on oxygen incor-
poration, which provides indications that oxygen might be involved [64]. Others
observed a strong connection to the emission at 3.9 eV and the absorption at
4.8 eV, which might be an indicator that carbon is involved [61]. The origin
of the red emission is also unclear. This luminescence is often weak and is not
observed in all crystals. So far, the most reasonable explanation has been given
by Sarua et al., who stated a combination of nitrogen vacancies and excess Al
to be responsible for the emission band around 600 nm [66].
Independent of the explanations of the individual absorption and emission
bands, most authors agree that the main defects responsible for these features
are vacancies (Al/N), oxygen, and carbon. This assignment is supported by meas-
urements with a broad range of methods. For the vacancies, positron annihilation
spectroscopy was used to conﬁrm a high level of incorporation [59]. Carbon and
oxygen are typically probed with secondary ion mass spectroscopy. High amounts
of these atoms were found in diﬀerent crystals [56, 67]. Additionally, silicon and
hydrogen were identiﬁed as impurities by SIMS [67]. Si is known to form a shal-
low donor in AlN. For hydrogen, which is incorporated in various complexes, no
inﬂuence on the optical properties is known [68, 69].
The origin of the diﬀerent defects can be found in either the setup used for the
growth (carbon, oxygen, silicon) or the source materials used (silicon, hydrogen,
oxygen). Point defect incorporation in the AlN crystals is not uniform in all cases.
This concerns the time point (regarding the growth) of incorporation in large AlN
boules, as well as some sensitivity to diﬀerent crystal planes. For example, while
www.ebook3000.com

Applications and devices
137
carbon is incorporated at a comparable amount over the whole boule, the oxygen
level appears to decrease over time [12]. However, this diﬀerent incorporation
might strongly diﬀer between the growth setups, reﬂecting the used crucibles,
source materials, and reactor parts. In contrast, the diﬀerent incorporation of
defects depending on the crystal planes appears to be independent of the growth
method. As an example, Bickermann et al. demonstrated that the incorporation
of oxygen is reduced on {1013} facets compared to {0001} facets by around one
order of magnitude, while at the same time the carbon concentration rises by a
factor of 3–4 for these facets [60].

4.5.1
Properties of AlN and AlGaN epitaxial layers on AlN
AlN bulk crystals are grown as substrates for the fabrication of AlGaN-based
electronic and optoelectronic devices. Epitaxial AlN and AlGaN ﬁlms were grown
on AlN substrates via MOCVD, and it was conﬁrmed that these ﬁlms have a
very high structural quality, far beyond that of AlN layers grown on sapphire
and SiC.
The quality of AlN homoepitaxy on substrates fabricated from PVT boules
is clearly shown in Fig. 4.9 [67]. No diﬀerence between the substrate and the ho-
moepitaxial layers could be observed by TEM or XRD. Thus, the homoepitaxial
layers adopted the lattice parameter and orientation of the bulk AlN substrates.
Both layer and substrate exhibited a high structural quality and were strain-free.
These results demonstrate impressively the advantages of bulk substrates.
In addition to the high structural quality, a low concentration of unintentional
impurities in the epilayers is required for the successful fabrication of devices,

since these impurities may lead to compensation eﬀects and may reduce the
carrier lifetime and mobility due to impurity scattering. Figure 4.10 presents a
SIMS depth proﬁle of silicon, carbon, and oxygen for a 1 μm thick homoepitaxial
AlN layer grown by MOCVD [67]. A high concentration of these impurities
is found in the AlN substrate, as discussed previously. The concentration of
these impurities decreases for the homoepitaxial layers by one to three orders of
magnitude. The strongest decrease is observed for silicon and carbon, while the
oxygen concentration remains in the range of 1018 cm−3.
The high structural quality and low defect concentration of homoepitaxial
AlN layers are also reﬂected in the PL spectra from these layers [70]. For AlN lay-
ers grown on sapphire, the near-band-edge (NBE) luminescence consists mainly
of the free A-exciton (XA) and a silicon-related, donor-bound exciton (D0X) [68].
Despite the steady increase in the quality of AlN/sapphire layers, this structure
of the NBE emission has not changed since the ﬁrst publication. However, for ho-
moepitaxial AlN layers, a further ﬁne-structure in the bound exciton region was
resolved (Fig. 4.11) [71]. Due to the increased quality of these layers, the FWHM
of the excitonic emission was reduced to 450 μm. This value is small enough that
three diﬀerent donor-bound excitons (D0X1-D0X3) can be resolved. An overview
of the observed lines and a suggested assignment is given in Table 4.3.

splitting is the increased crystal quality due to the used AlN bulk substrate.
Similar observations were made for the defect luminescence of homoepitaxial
layers. In a direct comparison of AlN layers grown on sapphire and AlN, Sedhain
et al. were able to demonstrate that the defect luminescence around 4.7 eV
is much stronger in samples grown heteroepitaxially [72]. Depending on the

growth direction, the defect luminescence of some layers grown on sapphire was
even stronger than that of the near-band-edge luminescence, conﬁrming reduced
defect incorporation in homoepitaxially-grown AlN samples.
The results discussed for AlN were widely reproduced for AlGaN layers grown
on bulk AlN crystals [67, 73, 74]. Similar to the binary system, an improved
structural quality, a decreased defect incorporation and better optical properties
were observed for layers grown on bulk AlN compared to those grown on sapphire.

Devices on bulk AlN substrates
Despite the excellent quality of bulk AlN crystals and epitaxially-grown AlN
and AlGaN ﬁlms thereon, there are only a very few preliminary realizations of
electronic and optoelectronic devices on AlN substrates. Devices that have been
demonstrated include LEDs and LDs, HFETs, and Schottky diodes.
Among the devices that have been realized on bulk AlN, LEDs can be con-
sidered as the most mature. However, due to the limited commercial availability
of AlN substrates, these devices are far from perfect and much research needs to

be done in the future to fully utilize AlN substrates. The ﬁrst demonstration of a
UV-LED on AlN substrates was made by Nishida et al. [75, 76]. Comparing LED
structures grown on bulk AlN and on AlN/sapphire, the advantages of AlN sub-
strates were suggested. However, in this work the main advantage of the bulk AlN
substrate was solely its higher thermal conductivity (Table 4.1), which was ex-
pressed by an increase of the saturation current injection from 150 mA to 300 mA
and a reduction of the red shift of the electroluminescence from a few nm down
to only 1 nm [75, 76]. The authors did not fully exploit the advantages of AlN
substrates, as they used only low Al-content AlGaN (4%—emission at 345 nm)
for their active layers, which is highly mismatched with AlN. Thus, no reduction
of dislocations could be expected in the active layers of these devices. Later,
a comprehensive comparison of LEDs emitting at wavelength around 300 nm
grown on sapphire and AlN was presented by Ren et al. [77]. The electrical char-
acteristics of the device grown on AlN exceeded those of the device on sapphire
(Fig. 4.12). This ﬁnding was based on the sharper onset of the LED grown on
AlN, a much reduced sheet resistance of 160 Ω/2 (compared to 560–840 Ω/2 for
devices on sapphire) and an increased light output. For the latter, an increase
up to a factor of 3.5 was observed, directly proving the advantages of bulk AlN
substrates. A calculation of the external quantum eﬃciency (EQE) highlighted a
value of 0.14%. Comparing this to typical EQEs achieved by LEDs on sapphire
in the same wavelength, an improvement by a factor of 4–5 was achieved.
Mid-UV LEDs on bulk AlN with an emission at 248 nm were demonstrated
by Grandusky et al. [78]. Despite the high injection currents of up to 300 mA, no

shift in the emission line was observed, conﬁrming the high thermal stability of
the device. A pulsed injection led to a peak EQE of 1.44% with an output power
of 1.44 mW. For the cw mode, slightly lower EQE and output power levels were
achieved, whereby the drop was attributed to self-heating.
A few examples of laser structures grown on AlN substrates are available
in the literature [79–81]. The ﬁrst demonstration of a 300 mW output laser
grown on an AlN bulk substrate was presented by Kneissl et al. in 2007 [79].
They reported on electrically driven laser emission around 370 nm using InGaN
quantum wells. For this device, a threshold current of 800 mA was determined
which corresponded to a current density of 13.3 kA/cm2. An emission power
of 300 mW for pulsed current injection was measured, and an EQE of 6.7%
was calculated. Again, these structures were highly mismatched with the AlN
substrate. Furthermore, optically pumped devices with emission ranging down
to 308 nm were realized. However, due to the use of Ga-rich active layers and not
optimized growth conditions, LDs with emission at a lower wavelength revealed
a strongly increasing threshold power density reaching only values observed in
devices grown on sapphire substrates.
More recently, transverse electric polarized lasing at 280.8 nm and 263.9 nm
for AlGaN based multi-quantum-wells and double heterojunction structures fab-
ricated on single crystalline AlN substrates was demonstrated [81]. With cavities
shorter than 200 μm, well-deﬁned, equally spaced longitudinal modes with line
widths as narrow as 0.014 nm were observed. The low threshold pumping dens-
ity of 84 kW/cm2 in these structures suggests that the electrically pumped sub
300 nm ultraviolet laser diodes are imminent.
In addition to optoelectronic devices, (high-power) electronic devices will be
one of the most important ﬁelds of applications for bulk AlN substrates. Due to
the reduced dislocation density and the superior electrical and thermal properties
of the AlN crystals (Table 4.1), devices grown on AlN substrates are expected to
sustain higher electrical ﬁelds while heating up less, thus being more reliable and
featuring an extended lifetime. However, only very limited results are available
for such devices. Among the electrical devices that have been demonstrated are
HFETs [82], X-ray detectors [2], and Schottky diodes [83].

Outlook
The market for near- and mid-UV light emitting devices is expected to grow dra-
matically over the next few years. To date, most light-emitters for applications
in this spectral range are mercury lamps. There is a high demand to substi-
tute mercury lamps with solid-state emitters, since lower power consumption
and drastically enhanced lifetimes are expected from these devices. Without any
doubt, AlGaN will be the dominating material for any solid-state UV emitters
in the future, and the present body of work shows that for high-quality AlGaN
with high Al content, AlN substrates are indispensible.

The growth of bulk aluminum nitride
The structural properties of ﬁlms grown on AlN wafers are vastly superior
to those grown on sapphire or SiC. Dislocation densities down to 103 cm2 have
been demonstrated. This value is six orders of magnitude lower than what is
typically achieved on SiC or sapphire substrates. The surface preparation of AlN
is also at a very advanced level. With mechanical and chemomechnical polishing,
a surface roughness with RMS values down to 0.1 nm can be achieved. So, what
is hindering the broader use of AlN substrates?
Firstly, AlN substrates are not readily available. There are less than a handful
of suppliers of AlN wafers around the world, and the quality of wafers diﬀers dra-
matically from supplier to supplier. This is primarily a consequence of diﬀerent
seeding techniques, as discussed previously.
Secondly, the size of AlN wafers is small compared to other competing sub-
strates. Since the device production eﬃciency roughly scales as the square of
the wafer diameter, most device manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see ap-
proach. Based on current analyses, entry-level wafer sizes for optoelectronics
and electronics are 50 mm and 100 mm, respectively.
Thirdly, the cost of AlN substrates is still very high. This is not unusual
nor of any real concern, as all other materials technologies have taken a similar
path. As crystal growth processes become more eﬃcient and the boules larger,
the price eventually reduces. However, current high prices signiﬁcantly limit the
pool of early adaptors.
Fourthly, optical absorption in the UV is high. As discussed, many bulk
AlN crystals reveal a relatively strong UV absorption band in the UV region
around 265 nm. Since LED emission is typically coupled out through the
substrate, absorption in the substrate drastically reduces the eﬃciency of the
light-emitting devices. Therefore, a better understanding of this UV absorption
is needed. Recent investigations have shown a connection between carbon and
the UV absorption.
Lastly, although great results on AlN and AlGaN epitaxy and on the proper-
ties of these layers on AlN substrates have been reported, thus far, most devices
have been only ﬁrst demonstrations and have not fully exploited the properties
of the AlN substrates. As a result, the performance of these devices has not been
overwhelmingly diﬀerent from those grown on sapphire. In order to advance this
promising technology, much more focused work is needed to develop doping and
strain-management schemes that will serve as basic building blocks for future
devices.

Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
Andr´e Strittmatter
5.1
Introduction
The concept of quantum dots (QD) as initially proposed by Arakawa and Sakaki
in 1982 was motivated by the quest for semiconductor materials providing higher
radiative eﬃciencies, lower power consumption, and better temperature stability
for light emitters such as laser diodes [1]. In the most simple picture quantum dots
are three-dimensional boxes out of a semiconductor material conﬁning charge
carriers in discretized electronic quantum states. Such conﬁnement is achieved if
the dimensions of the boxes are less than the de-Broglie wavelength of the charge
carriers. This quantum-mechanically deﬁned quantity, however, is of the order
of a few nm up to 20–30 nm for III/V semiconductors. Not only the small sizes
are challenging for a materials scientist to realize, but also controlling densities
of such tiny objects over several orders of magnitude.
Attempts to engineer quantum dots by means of patterning and etching
largely failed, as defect generation deteriorates their optoelectronic properties.
A groundbreaking alternative, the self-organized growth of quantum dots, was
established around the mid-1990s in GaAs semiconductors and related alloys [2].
Most widely adopted today for the growth of quantum dots is the Stranski–
Krastanow mode where coherently strained layers grow initially two-dimensional
before nanometer-sized islands are formed upon exceeding a critical layer thick-
ness [3]. Coherently strained islands of 10–30 nm base length, 1–5 nm height, and
with densities from 106–1011 cm−2 are controlled by parameters such as tem-
perature, layer thickness, and growth interruption. Another technique, droplet
epitaxy, matured recently for site-controlled growth of single QDs and quantum
dot molecules [4].
The successful realization of quantum dot-based laser diodes with lower
laser threshold current density and improved temperature stability validated
their utility for optoelectronic applications [1, 5]. Quantum dots grown by the
Stranski–Krastanow method are also demonstrated for InP and related alloys,
and in the SiGe/Si material system. Interfacial strain due to lattice mismatch
between diﬀerent compounds is also present in the nitride material system. The
limits of 2.5% strain at AlN/GaN interfaces and 11% strain at InN/GaN inter-
faces makes the SK growth mode likely to be available for the nitrides too. It
is also fairly easy to motivate research on nitride quantum dots, as the prospect
of increased internal quantum eﬃciencies will eventually lead to better perform-
ances of optoelectronic consumer devices such as lamps, projectors, traﬃc lights,
147

and the like. Another prospective area is single nitride-based quantum dots for
novel applications such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography which
require generation of single and entangled photons on demand. For operation
of single-photon emitters at room temperature a separation of the quantum-
mechanical states of charge carriers well above the kinetic energy of 25 meV
at room temperature is a prerequisite. The nitride semiconductor family allows
for combination of wide-gap matrix materials and narrow-gap quantum dots
which would provide the necessary energy spacing within the quantum dots.
Nitride-based quantum dots are therefore considered as potential candidates for
room-temperature single-photon emitters.
This chapter is devoted to concepts for realizing nitride quantum dots by
epitaxial methods. It starts with GaN quantum dots grown on AlN, as these
quantum dots can be grown using the Stranski–Krastanow regime and important
parameters controlling their properties are identiﬁed. It covers both the mo-
lecular beam epitaxy (MBE) as well as the metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy
(MOVPE) method, and will also summarize results for non-planar and semi-
polar QDs. Next, an attempt is made to present successful growth techniques for
InGaN-based QDs. This comprises Stranski–Krastanow growth mode, droplet
epitaxy, and surface pre-treatments using various chemicals. Of course, the in-
tensively discussed subject of spontaneous QD formation within InGaN layers
will be touched. InN quantum dots are treated separately, as it is probably the
most challenging part of nitride growth. The chapter ends with current strategies
for site-controlled growth of InGaN QDs, which is mainly done using growth of
hexagonal pyramids and subsequent InGaN overgrowth of the apexes.

5.2.1
Molecular beam epitaxy
For strained layer systems the Stranski–Krastanow growth regime has been es-
tablished as a reliable self-assembling method for coherently strained quantum
dots. Typically, the layer growth starts two-dimensional (2D) but upon exceed-
ing a critical layer thickness a transition to three-dimensional (3D) islands is
observed. For this transition to occur, the energy balance between surfaces, in-
terfaces, and edges is decisive. When 3D islands form, the surface energy plus
the energy of edges is increased as more surface area and edges are formed as
compared to 2D growth. At the same time, strain energy is decreased as strained
material is removed from the highly strained 2D layer and transferred into less
strained quantum dots. In total, the QD formation process succeeds if the en-
ergy gain due to strain relaxation surpasses the energy budget required for newly
created surfaces and edges. Strain energy increases with lattice mismatch and
layer thickness, whereas surface energies depend on crystallographic orientation
but also on speciﬁc surface terminations.

of the basal planes (aGaN=3.189 ˚A vs. aAlN=3.11 ˚A). As known from the
InGaAs/GaAs system, this is about the lower limit for the Stranski–Krastanow
mode [6]. Variations of the surface energy may therefore become signiﬁcant for
the 2D/3D growth mode transition to take place. In MBE growth, this complex-
ity manifests in the sensitive dependency of QD formation on the stabilization of
a Ga-bilayer on the growth surface. In such a case, only 2D growth is observed
up to the limits of plastic relaxation where dislocations form. This is understood
as the consequence of a highly enhanced nitrogen diﬀusivity on the surface.
However, 2D growth is established for Ga/N >1 in the case of plasma-assisted
(PA) nitrogen cells and Ga/N <1 in the case of radio-frequency-assisted (rf-
assisted) ammonia cells used for the nitrogen supply [7, 8]. If growth conditions
are favoring Ga-bilayer formation, the formation of QDs is achieved by applying a
growth interruption under vacuum. Thereby, excess Ga atoms evaporate from the
surface and stoichiometry between Ga and N is established. Under stoichiomet-
ric conditions, however, 3D islands are energetically favored and QDs rapidly
appear on the surface [9]. Quantum dots are also obtained if growth conditions
are chosen which avoid the Ga-bilayer formation. For PA-MBE such conditions
refer to growth using Ga/N-ratio <1. The critical layer thickness at which the
2D/3D transition starts is determined to about 2.5–3 monolayers (ML) GaN [10].
Up to about 8 ML GaN, QD feed on material transfer from the GaN wetting
layer (WL), which is consumed until 2.5 ML of GaN remain in the wetting layer.
This is illustrated in Fig. 5.1, where the high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (HRTEM) image of a 3 QD layer stack is shown. Each QD layer was

formed during a 120 s long growth interruption after deposition of a 3 ML thick
GaN layer under Ga-rich conditions. The thin continuous dark line connecting
the QDs is referred to as the remainder of the wetting layer. In the inset the
thickness of the WL is resolved to 2.8 MLs. Typical MBE growth temperatures
for GaN-QDs are similar to growth temperatures of thick, two-dimensional lay-
ers, i.e., 680–800◦C. An exponential increase of the density from 3·1010 cm−2 to
2·1011 cm−2 is observed when the GaN thickness is increased from 2.8 MLs to
6 MLs [9]. Once QDs are formed during growth interruptions the supply of nitro-
gen stimulates Ostwald ripening, i.e., small dots dissolve and large dots grow in
size [7]. Well-deﬁned shapes of truncated hexagonal pyramids with a lateral size
between 10–25 nm and 2–5 nm height are found both in TEM and AFM meas-
urements. The side facets of the dots belong to {1103} crystallographic planes
which make an angle of 32◦with the (0001) basal plane of the wurtzite struc-
ture in GaN. This shape is preserved during AlN cap layer growth because of
the very low intermixing of Ga and Al atoms at the interface between GaN and
AlN [12].
Vertical stacking of up to 200 QD planes is reported in the GaN/AlN system
[11, 13]. Capping layer growth by AlN results in planarization of the growth
front if the layer thickness exceeds the average QD height [12]. Vertically correl-
ated QDs are found for AlN spacer layer thicknesses ≤8 nm [14]. An example
of vertically correlated dots is displayed in Fig. 5.2. Instead of a random dot
distribution in each plane an arrangement into vertical columns is found. One
can also notice the lateral size increase of the dots in the upper planes. The
vertical correlated growth is due to local strain ﬁelds in the AlN matrix sur-
rounding the GaN QDs. For small AlN spacer layer thicknesses the strain ﬁelds
may protrude to the growth plane of subsequent QDs, thereby reducing locally

the free energy for QD formation. Uncorrelated stacks of QDs are observed for
spacer thicknesses of 20 nm in MBE. The analysis shown in Fig. 5.3 reveals an
increase of the lateral QD size from about 25 nm to 50 nm along with a reduction
of the statistical size broadening. Thereby, the ground state optical transition
undergoes a red-shift and the FWHM of the ensemble luminescence becomes
narrower. A detailed survey of the epitaxy of GaN quantum dots by MBE is
given by Daudin [15].
5.2.2
Metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy
In 1996, Tanaka et al. reported the very ﬁrst result on GaN QD growth employing
silicon surface pre-treatment in MOVPE growth [16]. The method allows growth
of GaN quantum dots on AlxGa1−xN (0.07 ≤x ≤0.20) buﬀer layers by MOVPE.
In this case a SiNx mask may form and the growth of GaN resembles a mode
which may be best described by selective area growth (SAG). Self-assembled
QD formation via a 2D/3D transition was observed for GaN growth on AlN in a
temperature range of 960–970◦C using a horizontal reactor geometry. The appar-
ently large diﬀerence to MBE growth temperatures is to a great extent caused
by the indirect measurement with a thermocouple, reading an inner susceptor
temperature which may be oﬀset to the surface temperature by up to 150◦C. As
shown in Fig. 5.4, the QD density can be eﬀectively controlled between 2·108 and
5·1010 cm−2 by tuning the GaN coverage from 3.4 and 9 MLs. Besides, control of
the dot density is achieved by growth interruptions of 3–30 s and by tuning the
V/III ratio during GaN growth. High QD densities of >1010 cm−2 are obtained
at very low V/III ratios of 20–30, whereas for V/III ratios of >10000 one ﬁnds
densities between 107 and 109 cm−2 [17, 18]. This agrees well with the conclusion

from MBE results that the surface diﬀusion of Ga atoms is regulated by the nitro-
gen supply. Interestingly, for high V/III ratios the critical layer thickness for QD
formation is well below 2.5 MLs and non-exponential growth of the QD density
is observed. These discrepancies to MBE results has been ascribed to tolerances
on the growth-rate estimations as well as to possibly non-homogeneous wetting
layer thicknesses which might be locally exceeding the critical value of about
2 MLs. There is also a noticeable reduction in lateral size of the QD pyramids
from 35 nm to 20 nm when the V/III ratio is reduced, and hence the density
is increased [17, 18]. Vertically ordered stacks of up to ten QD planes separated
by 20 nm AlN spacer layers are also fabricated using MOCVD. The relatively
large vertical distance of 20 nm as compared to the upper limit of 8 nm seen for
MBE-grown, vertically correlated QD samples is explained by the larger lateral
QD size (20 nm to 10 nm) [19]. Similar to the results obtained by MBE, photolu-
minescence spectra also show reduced size broadening and red-shift of the peak
wavelength upon stacking, indicating more homogeneous and larger dot sizes.
5.2.3
Growth on non-polar and semipolar planes
Spontaneous as well as piezoelectric polarization charges build up at interfaces
normal to the [0001] direction due to the inversion asymmetry of atomic sites for
group-A and group-B atoms. The binary nitrides AlN-GaN-InN exhibit strong
polarization ﬁelds across their {0001} interfaces [20] which separate electron

and hole charge carriers along opposite directions. In consequence, the wave-
function overlap of electron and holes is reduced, radiative recombination rates
are low, and emission peak wavelength of quantum wells and quantum dots
strongly depends on injected carrier density. For light-emitting devices such as
LEDs and laser diodes those consequences are detrimental for their performance.
Polarization ﬁelds can be canceled on non-polar (m-plane, {1100} and a-plane,
{1120}) and greatly reduced on semipolar {1122} surfaces, and increased per-
formance with respect to light output eﬃciency is expected [21, 22]. Even though
quantum dots conﬁne the charge carriers into small volumes the eﬀects of the
polarization ﬁelds on radiative recombination rate and emission wavelength are
strong [23]. This has motivated studies on QD growth on non-polar and semipolar
surfaces.
Non-polar GaN QDs are obtained by MBE growth both on m-plane
AlN(1100) and a-plane AlN(1120) buﬀer layers [24–26]. The Stranski–Krastanow
growth regime is achieved using Ga-rich conditions for both surface orientations.
This is not easy to understand, given the fact that for Ga-rich conditions surface
roughening occurs on m-plane surfaces and layer-by-layer growth is observed
for a-plane material. An explanation can be given by assuming diﬀerent sur-
face energies of the planes covered by Ga atoms similar to what is observed for
GaN/AlN(0001) growth. The Stranski–Krastanow regime is accordingly modi-
ﬁed by growth interruption strategies to account for the diﬀerences in growth.
For m-plane QDs, growth interruption are applied without nitrogen stabiliza-
tion to remove excess Ga atoms from the surface by evaporation. In the case of
a-plane QDs, growth interruption is performed under nitrogen to bind excessive
Ga atoms on the surface. The 2D/3D transition occurs for GaN layer thicknesses
around 2 MLs, which is similar to growth on AlN(0001). In addition, the strain
state of the AlN buﬀer layer is decisive on whether QDs or QW structures result
from the growth. For m-plane AlN/SiC(1100) buﬀers, relaxation of the buﬀer
with increasing thickness (>500 nm) promotes QD formation, since the lattice
mismatch between GaN/AlN progressively increases.
Non-polar In0.12Ga0.88N-QDs have been realized by MOVPE on m-plane free-
standing GaN substrates [27]. In order to achieve the Stranski–Krastanow growth
regime for such low In-content, compressive strain was introduced additionally
by a low-temperature AlN interlayer and an AlGaN/AlN superlattice structure
into a 190-nm thick GaN buﬀer layer prior to the QD growth.
Symmetric {1103} side facets are observed for c-plane (polar) quantum dots
resulting in truncated hexagonal pyramids. The lower symmetry of the non-polar
a- and m-planes lead to pronounced asymmetries of the shapes of non-polar
QDs. As Figs. 5.5a and 5.5b show, a-plane GaN quantum dots are symmetric
perpendicular to the [0001] c-axis direction but asymmetric perpendicular to
the [1100] direction. The side facets perpendicular to the c-axis are identiﬁed
as (0221) and (2021) planes, respectively, while the asymmetric side facets are a
low-angle (1121) plane and a high-angle (1122) plane, respectively [28]. Figure 5.6
shows the shape of m-plane QDs in comparison to c-plane QDs when viewed from

the [1120] direction. A strong asymmetry with respect to the [1100] direction can
be seen [26]. As a rule of thumb, the low-angle facet points in the +c-direction,
whereas the high-angle facet points in the opposite −c-direction [29]. A very
similar asymmetry of the dot shape is found for InGaN/GaN QDs grown on
m-plane GaN [27].
Semipolar GaN{1122} and InGaN{1122}-QDs are also realized by MBE
[30, 31]. Stranski–Krastanow growth is realized under Ga-rich conditions by ap-
plying growth interruptions after GaN deposition on AlN(1122) buﬀer layers [30].
Under Ga-rich conditions, the GaN growth remains two-dimensional. However,

during the growth interruption, 3D islands are formed if the GaN thickness is lar-
ger than about 3 ML. Figure 5.7 shows respective surface images as recorded by
AFM prior and after deposition of 5 MLs GaN, with subsequent growth interrup-
tion under vacuum of 90s. For the shape of semipolar GaN(1122) QDs possible
variants are deduced from HRTEM analysis [32]. According to this model, the
QDs are slightly asymmetric along [1123] with delimiting (1126) and (1120) side
facets, respectively. For the opposite in-plane direction, [1100], symmetric shapes
may be observed if either of two equivalent (1011) or (1012) facets delimit the
QDs. However, the model further accounts for the possibility of an asymmet-
ric shape along [1100] if both facets coexist in the dot shape. Due to imperfect
growth of AlN buﬀer layers on {1122} surfaces, QD nucleation on other than
{1122} planes is possible [32, 33]. The impact of polarization ﬁelds on the optical
properties of non-polar and semipolar QDs is greatly reduced as compared to
c-plane structures. This is exempliﬁed by photoluminescence experiments shown
in Figs. 5.8 and 5.9. As seen in Fig. 5.8, the luminescence peak does not shift with
increasing QD size below the bandgap of bulk GaN at 3.47 eV, which indicates
reduced polarization ﬁelds. In contrast, the emission peak wavelength of polar
QDs shifts even into the visible spectral range due to piezoelectric polarization
ﬁelds [8]. For the same reason, the emission peak of polar QD luminescence shifts
towards higher energies with increasing excitation density as the polarization is
progressively screened by photoexcited carriers. The comparison of respective
excitation-dependent PL spectra shown in Fig. 5.9 demonstrates that this shift
of the emission wavelength is not present in a-plane (non-polar) QDs.
Despite the progress on non-polar and semipolar QDs a remaining common
problem of non-polar and semipolar nitride heterostructures is an increased

probability for defect generation within the basal plane of the wurtzite unit
cell, as eﬃcient strain relief results from such defects. For instance, basal plane
stacking faults terminated by partial dislocations are usually found in heteroep-
itaxially grown layers [34–36]. In the case of m-plane QDs, dislocations in the
[1120] direction are identiﬁed both at the lower and upper GaN/AlN interface
of QD structures [37]. There are also dislocations running in the [1100] direction
at a-plane AlN/GaN interfaces of the wetting layer [28]. For both orientations,
c-axis strain is relieved plastically by dislocation generation within the intersec-
tion of the c-plane and the growth plane. However, in-plane strain of the lattice
planes perpendicular to the c-axis planes, i.e., parallel to [1100] and [1120], is
relieved elastically through the QD formation.

5.3.1
Phase separation and In segregation eﬀects
Quantum dots in the InGaN material system are achieved in numerous ways,
since the instability of the material enables several possibilities for the growth.
This section starts with highlighting several issues of the InGaN compound which
are important for the understanding of InGaN quantum dot growth. Generally
speaking, issues are due to the large diﬀerences of the atomic radii of the ele-
mental constituents indium and gallium. In numbers, the Ga-N bond length of
1.95 ˚A is about 10% smaller than the In-N bond length of 2.15 ˚A which leads
to micro-strains in the unit cell when indium atoms are incorporated on Ga
sites. Consequently, the system’s energy is increased when In atoms are incor-
porated on Ga sites. The unit cell reacts by stretching and bending of bonds
around In atoms in order to minimize the potential energy of the crystal [38].
Another option for the compound to restore its minimum energy is phase sep-
aration by spinodal and binodal decomposition. By calculating the enthalpy of
mixing alloy decomposition is expected for temperatures below 1400◦C. At a
typical growth temperature of 800◦C immiscibility of InN and GaN is predicted
for 0 ≤xIn ≤0.88 (see Fig. 5.10). Due to compressive strain exacerbated by GaN
barriers onto InGaN the immiscibility region is, however, narrowed and shifted

Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
towards high-In containing layers, and the critical temperature is lowered below
about 700◦C [39]. One should also recall that those calculations refer to ther-
modynamic equilibrium conditions which are not established during epitaxial
growth methods like MBE or MOVPE. However, growth interruptions and very
low growth rates, which are part of quantum dot formation in the SK regime,
are likely to promote equilibration processes.
Important for In incorporation into the growing crystal is also the In-N bond
energy (1.89 eV) which is only 80% of the Ga-N bond energy (2.34 eV). Moving
an indium atom from one lattice site to another is therefore much more favored
than for a gallium atom. Indium atoms sitting on a crystal’s surface also make
fewer bonds with nitrogen atoms than for the four-fold coordinated group-III lat-
tice sites in the bulk. In addition, indium atoms at crystal surfaces accommodate
strain more eﬃciently by rearranging their bonding to next-neighbors. For these
reasons, segregation of In atoms towards the surface is very likely to occur, as
the total energy of the system becomes reduced thereby. Segregation phenom-
ena are investigated by Monte Carlo simulation of In0.10Ga0.90N layer growth.
Figure 5.11 shows that the surface In coverage exceeds by large amounts (>50%)
the nominal bulk value, and less than 5% of indium is found in the bulk [40].
Through such a surface layer the chemical potential of In atoms is raised close to
the value where In droplet formation starts. Northrup et al. also calculated that
In incorporation is favored on {1122} surfaces because of In-In bilayer formation
promoting In incorporation on such surfaces [41]. They identiﬁed the cores of
threading dislocations on GaN(0001) as centers for In agglomeration.
Under such circumstances, controlling the self-organized growth of quantum
dots in the Stranski–Krastanow regime may deviate from the binary GaN/AlN

eﬀects.
5.3.2
Stranski–Krastanow growth mode
The layer thickness for the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional
growth as characteristic feature of the SK growth mode depends on lattice
mismatch and therefore on In composition for the ternary InxGa1−xN mater-
ial. In situ growth mode analysis during MBE using Reﬂection High-Energy
Diﬀraction (RHEED) is used to investigate the 2D/3D critical layer thickness.
The results for MBE using ammonia are shown in Fig. 5.12 for 0 < xIn< 0.50.
By investigation of the QD formation at 550◦C growth temperature, the min-
imum In composition for SK-QD formation is around 12%, below which only
surface roughening occurs [42]. A diﬀerent onset of the transition at 18% indium
content is measured for plasma-assisted MBE using nitrogen. For such an MBE
method, SK-QD require stoichiometric or slightly nitrogen-rich conditions. For
an In0.35Ga0.65N layer, the critical layer thickness is 1.7 MLs, which is also lower
than the value taken from Fig. 5.12. In terms of compositional dependence of
the critical layer thickness and lower boundary for the 2D/3D transition, the
InGaN material systems resembles very much the behavior of the well-studied
InGaAs/GaAs system [6].
Proper MOVPE growth conditions for QD formation are diﬀerent from those
reported for MBE. Foremost, growth temperatures ranging from 600 to 800◦C

and V/III ratios of several thousands are applied owing to the low decomposi-
tion rate of ammonia (NH3). These values are more alike quantum-well growth
parameters, which is in contrast to InGaAs/GaAs(001), where lower growth tem-
peratures and low V/III ratios are favored. Also, the critical layer thicknesses
for QD formation of 5–10 MLs for In compositions of around 20–40% are signi-
ﬁcantly larger than for MBE (Fig. 5.13). In part, the latter deviations can be
attributed to uncertainties due to ex situ calibration of growth rate and compos-
ition of InGaN layers for MOVPE. The right panel of Fig. 5.13 shows an example
of the decrease of the QD density with increasing temperature. An exponential
relation of the QD density with inverse temperature is measured [43, 44].
Typical dimensions of InGaN QDs are between 1 and 5 nm height and 5 and 30
nm base length both for MOVPE and MBE growth. The electronic conﬁnement
in the lateral direction may not be suﬃcient for discretization of energy levels
because of the much smaller excitonic Bohr radius of only about 3.4 nm. This
may also explain that the 2D/3D transition is not easily detected in the emission
spectra as a transition from a spectrally narrow quantum-well emission to an
inhomogeneously size-broadened QD ensemble luminescence.

Relatively high ammonia partial pressures are needed to stabilize InGaN sur-
faces against In droplet formation. The investigation of the impact of diﬀerent
V/III ratios on QD formation at growth temperatures of 755◦C using InGaN
layers with approximately 20–30% indium indicates that an optimum for the
NH3 ﬂow rate (and hence for the V/III ratio) exists [46]. At very high ammonia
ﬂow rates, large three-dimensional objects can show up on the surface which
are either relaxed clusters or do not provide three-dimensional quantum conﬁne-
ment for charge carriers. In contrast, very low ammonia ﬂow rates may lead to
suppression of the QD formation as In atoms may evaporate from the surface.
Growth interruptions (GRI) after deposition of the wetting layer are com-
monly used in MOVPE of InGaAs/GaAs(001) QDs to control average QD size
and density of QD ensembles. Material transfer from the WL into QDs and
from small to large QDs leads to red-shifted emission spectra with increasing
growth interruption times. Simultaneously, the QD density gradually decreases
due to the dissolution of smaller QDs. The evolution of size and density of InGaN
QDs is aﬀected by indium desorption eﬀects as illustrated by Fig. 5.14. During
ammonia-stabilized growth interruptions the size distributions at 60s GRI shows
a reduction in height and width of the QDs and an increase in QD density as
compared to 30s GRI. Indium desorption competes with the QD nucleation dur-
ing the initial stage of the GRI. Afterwards, the QD density decreases and the
QD sizes increase, indicating material transfer from small to large QDs. The
continued blue-shift of the emission spectra indicate the desorption of In atoms
into the gas phase also at this stage.
In order to provide suﬃcient optical gain for laser diode devices, stacking of
QD planes need to be considered. Thus, overgrowth of QDs with GaN barrier
layers is necessary which, due to the volatility of the In-N bond, cannot be
performed at temperatures far above the QD growth temperatures. By choosing

Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
the same temperature for QDs and barrier layers, overgrowth of QDs is achieved
for xIn<0.5 [42, 48, 49]. At very high In concentrations in the QDs, dissolution
during overgrowth takes place both for MBE and for MOVPE [50]. Insight into
vertically correlated growth of stacked InGaN quantum dot layers has not yet
been gained.
5.3.3
Spontaneous quantum dot formation in InGaN layers
The high radiative eﬃciency of nitride-based light-emitting diodes (LED) despite
high dislocation densities in heteroepitaxially grown layers is often attributed to
localization centers within InGaN layers. Excitons in InGaN have a Bohr radius
of around 3 nm, which approximately sets the length scale on which ﬂuctuating
properties of an InGaN layer may lead to quantum-dot-like carrier conﬁnement.
As outlined at the beginning of this chapter, compositional ﬂuctuations in InGaN
are promoted by In segregation but may also be driven by phase separation.
Fluctuations within InGaN layers on the length scale of a few nanometers are of-
ten observed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. One has argued
that the TEM investigation itself artiﬁcially introduces such ﬂuctuations if expos-
ure times are taken too long (>1 min.), but time series show that ﬂuctuations are
resolved even with short exposure times (<1 min.) [53, 54]. Figure 5.15 shows a
statistical analysis of In ﬂuctuation and thickness deviations within InGaN/GaN
samples grown by MOVPE on Si(111) substrates [51]. The analysis is based on
cross-sectional TEM images taken at several locations across the sample. The
average In composition and mean thickness of the InGaN layers were conﬁrmed
by X-ray diﬀraction measurements. As can be seen, both thickness and In con-
centration are widely scattered and the length scales are small enough to provide
3D localization.

Complementary results from luminescence experiments exhibiting sharp emis-
sion lines with emission linewidths of the order of 500 μeV conﬁrm QD
formation [55]. From time-resolved PL spectra shown in Fig. 5.16 an average
size of the localization centers of 3–4 nm and a very broad energy distribution
are conﬁrmed [56–58].
Signiﬁcant impact on the localization centers by post-growth annealing and
growth interruptions has been identiﬁed [59]. Annealing of samples exhibiting
pronounced ﬂuctuations after growth at temperatures above 950◦C is leading to
the disappearance of In-rich clusters in InGaN/GaN-MQW layers [60]. Growth
interruptions in an ammonia atmosphere after quantum well growth promote
In desorption out of the layers. For short growth interruptions of 5–30s, excess
In which is initially incorporated into clusters within the quantum well layers
is removed and the in-plane localization of charge carriers is reduced, leading
to decreasing photoluminescence intensity [61]. The magnitude of compositional
ﬂuctuations also increases with In content in the well layers [62]. Especially
for In concentration xIn = 0.3, quantum dot formation is evidenced by numer-
ous means. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements indicate a
tendency towards enhanced in-plane localization with increasing well thickness
from 1.2 to 3.9 nm. Corresponding activation energies for carrier delocalization
are 27.1 meV, 31 meV, and 35 meV [63].

Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
5.3.4
Thermal annealing and surface pre-treatment methods
Annealing of InGaN layers is also used to initiate quantum dot formation. After
deposition of a thin In0.20Ga0.80N layer annealing at the quantum well growth
temperature in pure nitrogen atmosphere leads to In droplets on the surface.
These In droplets may transform into InGaN quantum dots upon capping with
GaN. The density of these droplets increases from 5·109 to 3·1010 cm−2 with de-
creasing growth temperature of the cap layer between 900◦C and 700◦C. Using an
annealing atmosphere of H2/NH3 a meander-like InGaN layer surface is created.
These structures are attributed to additional etching eﬀects which hydrogen has
on InGaN layers. Similar structures are obtained for layers with very high In-
content of xIn >90% when annealed at 700◦C and 750◦C, respectively. Spinodal
decomposition is predicted to take place at such high In concentrations [39, 50].
By TEM analysis of uncapped InGaN layers thermally treated at 700◦C and
750◦C, large truncated pyramids and spherical islands with 20 nm height and
40–50 nm base length are found besides ﬂat structures of 1–1.5 nm height. High In
concentrations of 80–90% are measured for the large pyramidal and spherical ob-
jects, whereas only 20% In is remaining in the ﬂat structures. Upon overgrowth,
the large objects dissolve and the excess In may form a quantum well layer with
6–7% In above the layer containing the ﬂat meandering structures. Quantum dots
are identiﬁed by sharp emission lines emerging in low-temperature luminescence
spectra and by an increased radiative eﬃciency at room temperature.
Opposite to InGaAs/GaAs-based QDs which are very sensitive to surface re-
combination, ex situ surface patterning methods may be eﬀective to fabricate
luminescent InGaN quantum dot structures. This can be inferred from the re-
latively strong luminescence intensities of InGaN surfaces which point to low
non-radiative surface recombination rates.
A very eﬀective way of producing InGaN quantum dots is to pre-treat the
growth surface prior to the InGaN growth. By supplying Si to the growth sur-
face the growth mode for subsequent GaN and InGaN layers changes from
2D to 3D growth, thus leading to high-density arrays of quantum dots (see
Fig. 5.17) [16, 48]. Originally, an anti-surfactant eﬀect by silicon atoms suppress-
ing In diﬀusion on the surface has been assumed. More probable is the formation
of SiNx nano-masks on the surface, which lead to selected area growth within
the openings of the nano-masks [49, 64]. This is further supported by growth
experiments in which Si and ammonia are simultaneously fed into the growth
chamber to intentionally allow for SiNx formation on the growth surface. Similar
three-dimensional growth modes are obtained for appropriate exposure times,
and thin SiNx-layers are in such cases identiﬁed beneath the InGaN quantum
dots. For extended Si and ammonia treatment times InGaN growth can be com-
pletely suppressed [49]. Very high quantum dot densities approaching 1011 cm−2
are realized with Si pre-treatment. A disadvantage of the approach is related to
the Si donor properties in the nitride material system. Due to the spatial and
temporal proximity of the Si treatment to the quantum dot growth it is very

likely that Si atoms will incorporate into quantum dots where Si would act as a
charged impurity state. Conclusive evidence that Si atoms are not incorporated
into QDs are not reported so far.
Another approach of surface pre-treatment is wet-chemical removal of SiO2
masks completely covering a GaN surface. These masks are deposited ex situ
without any subsequent patterning. Direct growth of InGaN layers on such sur-
faces results in 3D growth and QD ensembles with a density of 9·1010 cm−2
result. As Fig. 5.18 shows, average lateral QD size is increasing, while density
decreases gradually with increasing deposition times, indicating coalescence of
the islands.
5.3.5
InN quantum dots
InN has become a topic of interest for its band gap, being as small as 0.6–0.7 eV
[66]. Potential application as active material for the important 1.3–1.55 μm
wavelength region as well as in solar energy conversion using solar cells is expec-
ted if InN growth could be suﬃciently mastered. Unfortunately, c-plane InN is
highly lattice-mismatched by >10% to GaN(0001) and AlN(0001) lattice planes,
making it very susceptible to plastic lattice relaxation. Otherwise the Stranski–
Krastanow regime beneﬁts from such strain values, and growth of coherently
strained optically active quantum dots might be possible. The fairly low disso-
ciation temperature for InN of around 550◦C sets upper boundaries on growth
temperature making growth of smooth heterostructures even more complicated.
Using MBE high-density (4·1011cm−2) arrays of InN quantum dots are
grown for InN layer thicknesses ≥4 ML and growth temperatures around

growth chemistry on V/III ratio. Another study monitoring oscillations of the
characteristic RHEED pattern indicates a critical layer thickness for the 2D/3D
transition of about 2 MLs [68]. In the same study, however, plastic relaxation
after the ﬁrst InN monolayer is noticed, i.e., prior to the 2D/3D transition. The
case for MOVPE-grown InN quantum dots is a little diﬀerent, as the precursor
pyrolysis of trimethylindium and in particular ammonia requires temperatures
well above 400◦C. Still, quantum dot structures of roughly 25 nm diameter and
3–6 nm height are realized at 550◦C temperature and very high nominal V/III
ratios of 15000 [69]. Note that the actual V/III ratio is much lower, as decompos-
ition of ammonia at 550◦C amounts to only about 0.01%. In the nitrogen carrier
gas, quantum dot densities are of the order of 107–108 cm−2. An argon carrier
gas atmosphere allows reduction of the nominal V/III ratio to 5000, while at
the same time the QD density is increased to 5·1010 cm−2 [71]. Unfortunately,
structural analysis by TEM reveal misﬁt dislocation networks at the interface
between MOCVD-grown InN layers and the underlying GaN buﬀer layer [72].
Photoluminescence signals detected at energies around 950 meV, besides being
weak, show no correlation to characteristic quantum dot properties such as size
and barrier material, which underlines the still persisting diﬃculties to realize
the potential of InN for optoelectronic applications [70].
5.4
Site-selective growth
Deterministically addressable individual quantum dots are of major interest
for devices operating under the constraints of purely quantum-mechanically
deﬁned electronic states like in atoms. Nitride-based quantum dots are promising
sources for single photon emission due to large conduction and valence band oﬀ-
sets between AlN-GaN-InN, which may yield large conﬁnement potentials and

168
Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
energy level splittings larger than the kinetic energy at room temperature [73, 74].
Nucleation of single quantum dots at pre-deﬁned sites during growth is pos-
sible only if the surface free energy is locally altered, whereby nucleation of
atomic species such as In or Ga atoms is attractive at those sites. As the base
size of a quantum dot takes on only a few nanometers, the surface free en-
ergy has to be changed on about the same length scale. Many technologies
exist nowadays to create nanometer-sized patterns on a surface for ordering of
nanostructures [75]. For example, electron-beam lithography, nano-imprinting,
and focused ion beam implantation were successfully applied for site-controlled
growth of InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots [4]. However, one problem of such surface
patterning methods is their limited reach of inﬂuence being restricted to a few
nanometers. In case of nitride growth the short-range impact raises concerns, as
growth on lattice-mismatched substrates yields huge densities of threading dis-
locations which act also as nucleation sites by locally widening the lattice [11].
Also, emission-line broadening by spectral diﬀusion arising from defects in the vi-
cinity of QDs can be reduced by burying the usually contaminated initial growth
surface by a few hundred nm thick buﬀer layer.
Most approaches for site-controlled quantum dot growth in the nitrides are
utilizing, therefore, selective area epitaxy under growth conditions which result
in pyramidal cones with very sharp, nanometer-sized apexes and {1011} smooth
side facets [76, 78–82]. MOVPE is preferred over MBE because of the larger
diﬀusion lengths attainable on the masked areas. After growing nominally 30
nm of GaN onto a SiO2 masked template with sub-μm openings pyramids, as
shown in Fig. 5.20, can be obtained [76]. Suitable growth conditions for the

formation of GaN hexagonal pyramids favor growth in the [0001] direction and
suppress lateral adatom diﬀusion on the (0001) plane. Growth temperatures of
around 900◦C yield smooth GaN(0001) surfaces [83, 84]. On top of hexagonal
GaN pyramids, quantum dots can be formed by depositing thin layers of InGaN.
The nanometer-scaled size of the apexes naturally leads to three-dimensionally
conﬁned quantum-dot structures without being forced to fulﬁll the conditions of
the SK regime. Excitonic emission of single quantum dots located at the apexes
of the pyramids is demonstrated as shown in Fig. 5.21 [77]. Linewidths as small
as 350 μeV at temperatures of 5 K are measured, conﬁrming comparable optical
quality to QDs on planar substrates.
5.5
Summary
Many techniques have been developed to engineer quantum dots in the ni-
tride material systems. Strain-driven formation, the realm of the Stranski–
Krastanow growth regime, is successfully used for GaN/AlN-, InGaN/GaN-, and
InN/GaN-QDs. Other approaches, such as droplet epitaxy or thermal annealing,

170
Epitaxial growth of nitride quantum dots
are also applicable. Still a matter of debate, spontaneous QD formation within
InGaN needs further investigation, but signatures of its existence are found in
transmission electron microscopy as well as in photoluminescence experiments.
As a possible direction towards higher radiative eﬃciencies, non-polar and semi-
polar quantum dots can be realized by Stranski–Krastanow growth, which results
in a greatly reduced impact of polarization ﬁelds on optical properties of the QDs.
Light-emitting devices (LED) based either on spontaneously formed localiz-
ation centers or by intentionally employing SK-QDs are demonstrated [85, 86].
Especially in the green spectral region, where the high In content will drive
the Stranski–Krastanow growth mode, surface segregation, and decomposition,
respectively, quantum-dot formation is important to understand. Laser action
under optical pumping is also achieved, but electrical operation is yet to be
demonstrated [44].
Future research may be directed towards electrically driven single-photon
emitters based on nitrides. First, techniques are developed to control the nucle-
ation site of a single quantum dot on the apex of pyramids. These concepts need
to be further developed to integrate those single dots into pn junctions, for ex-
ample, and attention must be given to achieve narrow emission lines well below
100 μeV. This may require reduction of the size of quantum dots even further
than the size obtained by Stranski–Krastanow growth or droplet epitaxy.

Introduction
The aim of the present chapter is to provide the readers with an update on re-
cent advances regarding the growth, the characterization, and the use of InAlN
layers nearly lattice-matched (LM) to GaN. This ternary alloy is the least well
known of the III-nitride family, and despite growth attempts dating back to
the early 1980s (Starosta, 1981) it was scarcely studied until 2003, when Carlin
and Ilegems demonstrated the potential of such layers for photonics through
the report of high-reﬂectivity crack-free InAlN/GaN distributed Bragg reﬂectors
(DBRs) (Carlin and Ilegems, 2003). It was soon followed by several other applic-
ations taking advantage of the nearly strain-free character of the InAlN/GaN
combination. We can thus cite among others (i) the realization of GaN/InAlN
multiple quantum well (MQW) structures suitable for near-infrared intersubband
applications (Nicolay et al., 2005), (ii) the selective lateral oxidation of InAlN
layers (Dorsaz et al., 2005a) and their subsequent selective etching (Simeonov
et al., 2008) that can be exploited to achieve an eﬃcient current conﬁnement in
III-N light-emitting devices (Dorsaz et al., 2005a; Castiglia et al., 2007) or to
realize advanced photonic structures such as microdisks (Simeonov et al., 2008)
or air-gap Bragg mirrors (Altoukhov et al., 2009), (iii) the characterization of
LM GaN/InAlN heterojunctions exhibiting a high two-dimensional carrier dens-
ity together with a high room-temperature mobility and a low sheet resistance
(Gonschorek et al., 2006) that have been successfully processed to demonstrate
high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on SiC featuring a gain cutoﬀ
frequency ft in excess of 200 GHz (Sun et al., 2010c), (iv) and the realiza-
tion of ultraviolet photodiodes (Senda et al., 2008). Beyond those applications,
this ternary alloy is still challenging the III-nitride community through several
features. Thus, in Section 6.2, relevant information on the structural proper-
ties of bulk InAlN layers, including the growth of high-quality InAlN layers on
freestanding GaN (FS-GaN) substrates, are given. In particular, the origin of
the hillocks and the V-defects apparently inherent to InAlN layers grown on

grown either by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) or by molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) (Zhou et al., 2007; Sahonta et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2012),
and the control of residual impurities such as carbon and oxygen (Chung
et al., 2011) are discussed. In Section 6.3, optical and electronic properties such
as the signiﬁcant scatter in the reported bowing parameter for the bandgap
Eg (Aschenbrenner et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008; Iliopoulos et al., 2008; Jones
et al., 2008; Sakalauskas et al., 2010), the anomalously large Stokes shift (S) that
exceeds several hundreds of meV (Butt´e et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Carlin
et al., 2005), the dispersion of the optical refractive index, and the valence-band
oﬀset value are discussed. In Section 6.4 we brieﬂy account for the properties
of GaN/InAlN quantum wells (QWs) and MQWs. In section 6.5 the successful
use of LM InAlN/(Al)GaN bilayers for the realization of DBRs and microcavit-
ies is described. In Section 6.6 we focus on InAlN cladding layers employed for
edge-emitting laser diodes (LDs). In Section 6.7 we detail the latest advances
reported for nearly LM InAlN/GaN HEMTs. Finally, a general conclusion and
perspectives for this topic are presented in Section 6.8.

Growth and structural properties of bulk InAlN layers
6.2.1
Growth characteristics of InAlN ﬁlms
The growth of InAlN layers has been mainly studied using MOVPE, and on
several aspects it remains a rather challenging task. First, the huge growth
temperature diﬀerence between AlN (∼1100◦C) and InN (∼600◦C) requires an
intermediate growth temperature for InAlN (∼800◦C), which strongly decreases
the surface diﬀusion length of Al adatoms. Moreover, the large diﬀerence between
the length and the energy of In-N and Al-N bonds is responsible for indium sur-
face segregation (Massies et al., 1987) and phase separation (Redondo-Cubero
et al., 2010), respectively. Whereas the former eﬀect mainly aﬀects superlattices
including InAlN layers rather than thick single InAlN layers, as will be discussed
hereafter in the DBR section, the latter, related to spinodal decomposition, can
strongly aﬀect the crystalline quality and the surface morphology of thick In-rich
InAlN layers (Hums et al., 2007).
The indium content fulﬁlling the LM condition between InxAl1−xN and GaN
is an important parameter which has generated great interest. The latter amounts
to about 17% for structures grown on c-plane sapphire substrates (Lorenz
et al., 2006) and about 18% for those grown on c-plane FS-GaN substrates
(Darakchieva et al., 2008). This discrepancy is ascribed to the diﬀerent residual
strain state of GaN buﬀers grown on the two types of substrate. Furthermore,
it is worth pointing out that an indium content satisfying the LM condition at

room temperature for InAlN layers grown on both types of substrate will res-
ult in tensile strain at the InAlN growth temperature because of the diﬀerence
between InAlN and GaN thermal expansion coeﬃcients. This has to be kept
in mind when growing InAlN-based structures, in order to avoid cracks and/or
dislocation generation.
InAlN growth parameters have been widely studied during the past few years
(Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2011; Lorenz et al., 2010; Sadler
et al., 2010; Ichikawa et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Sadler et al., 2012). As can
be seen in Fig. 6.1, increasing the growth temperature strongly reduces the in-
dium incorporation because of a large indium desorption rate (Kim-Chauveau
et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2011; Lorenz et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012). For a given
temperature, increasing the indium precursor ﬂux also favors indium incorpor-
ation, but only up to a given value (Sadler et al., 2009a; Sadler et al., 2011a;
Chung et al., 2011). Surprisingly, when increasing the aluminum precursor ﬂux
indium incorporation also increases, but without the saturation eﬀect reported
for the trimethylindium ﬂow rate for the range of trimethylaluminum ﬂow rates
investigated (Chung et al., 2011). This is ascribed to an increase in the InAlN
growth rate, which results in reduced indium desorption. Introducing a small
amount of H2 has proven to be eﬀective in order to improve the InAlN surface
morphology, but an increased hydrogen ﬂux also reduces indium incorporation
(Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011). Increasing the ammonia ﬂux, and thus the V/III
ratio, allows improving the surface roughness and decreasing the pit density
(Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011). At ﬁrst sight, the inﬂuence of the nitrogen ﬂux
seems identical to that of NH3 (Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011). When increasing
the growth pressure, the indium incorporation is improved, but this is done at

the expense of the surface roughness (Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011). It has also
been shown that no noticeable eﬀect on the growth rate, the indium incorpor-
ation, and the surface morphology occurs for a substrate miscut angle varying
between 0◦and 0.5◦(Sadler et al., 2012). As shown in Fig. 6.2, the carrier gas
ﬂows have a great impact on the InAlN quality. When performing growth with a
low carrier gas ﬂow, InAlN layers LM to GaN, whose absorption edge should lie
in the UV range (at ∼4.45 eV), exhibit a brownish aspect, indicating that light
absorption occurs at visible wavelengths. Eventually the transparency of the lay-
ers is improved, and thus the residual absorption is decreased when growth is
carried out using a suﬃciently high carrier gas ﬂow.
Another aspect of relevant interest deals with the residual doping in nomin-
ally undoped InAlN layers, since the latter will strongly impact the ability to
intentionally dope such an alloy, which is crucial if we wish to introduce n- or p-
type doped layers in optoelectronic devices. Chung and coworkers have therefore
studied the impurity incorporation, namely carbon and oxygen, and its depend-
ence on the growth conditions of optimized InAlN layers, i.e., layers where no
relaxation or degradation occurred, by performing secondary ion mass spectro-
metry measurements (Chung et al., 2011). As far as carbon incorporation is
concerned, it appears that [C] values in the 3–4 × 1017 cm−3 range are obtained
for low growth pressures (<100 Torr). It was concluded that carbon mainly ori-
ginates from the methyl groups from the decomposition of trimethylindium since
AlN grown under conditions identical to InAlN layers was characterized by [C]
values in the low 1017 cm−3. In addition, for a given pressure, the InAlN al-
loy is more sensitive to carbon contamination compared with the InGaN one,

Growth and structural properties of bulk InAlN layers

probably due to the stronger binding energy between Al and C atoms vs. that
between Ga and C ones. On the other hand, the incorporation of oxygen does
not appear to be aﬀected by growth parameters such as the growth pressure, the
growth rate, the V/III ratio, and the addition of H2 as carrier gas to N2. In any
case, InAlN layers exhibit high [O] values (in excess of 1 × 1018 cm−3), which is
ascribed to the strong aﬃnity of oxygen atoms to aluminum ones, and the low
growth temperatures.
6.2.2
Structural properties of bulk InAlN layers
As far as structural properties of InAlN layers are concerned, most of the
published works deal with MOVPE-grown layers, but there are also some pub-
lications focusing on MBE-grown ﬁlms. Therefore, we will ﬁrst brieﬂy describe a
few features of InAlN layers grown by MBE before detailing the main structural
speciﬁcities of MOVPE-grown layers reported in the literature.
MBE-grown InAlN layers LM to GaN.
Optimum growth conditions have
been described for layers deposited by plasma-assisted MBE (PAMBE) (Ive
et al., 2008; Fern´andez-Garrido et al., 2008). Using transmission electron mi-
crocopy (TEM), it has been shown that InAlN layers grown on GaN are
characterized by a honeycomb structure, which probably originates from the
GaN/InAlN interface (Zhou et al., 2007; Katzer et al., 2005). Those InAlN lay-
ers are composed of cells ﬁve to ten nanometers in diameter with an indium
content close to the LM composition, surrounded by In-rich vertical walls (In
content ∼30%). Sahonta et al. (2009) proposed as an origin for this peculiar
structure that Al-rich islands would ﬁrst form because of the joint low alu-
minum mobility and the In-desorption occurring under the growth conditions
considered. Then, an aluminum adsorbed layer would form, facilitating the in-
corporation of indium, preferentially at the edges of the islands where the strain
is partially relieved and where tensile strain may be present due to the coales-
cence of islands. This honeycomb structure would be kept during the subsequent
growth of the InAlN layer. Note that such a honeycomb structure is inherent to
all PAMBE-grown InAlN layers LM to GaN reported so far (Zhou et al., 2007;
Sahonta et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2012; Katzer et al., 2005; M´anuel et al., 2010;
Gaˇcevi´c et al., 2011; Dasgupta et al., 2011). Interestingly, it was shown that
when inserting a 1-nm thick AlN interlayer between the GaN and InAlN layers,
the growth of a 60-nm thick In0.18Al0.82N layer with a homogeneous composition
is made possible (M´anuel et al., 2010). Concerning ammonia-based MBE, thin
homogeneous In0.18Al0.82N layers about 25 nm thick have been obtained (Wong
et al., 2012).
MOVPE-grown InAlN layers LM to GaN: structural defects.
Various types of
defects have been reported for thick MOVPE-grown InAlN ﬁlms. Cracks are
usually observed for an indium composition lower than 17%, i.e., when the
InAlN layers are under tensile strain (Sadler et al., 2009a; Sadler et al., 2011a;

182
Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
Miao et al., 2010). Metallic indium particles are sometimes seen at the surface,
but they can be eliminated by an appropriate tuning of the growth paramet-
ers (Sadler et al., 2009a; Sadler et al., 2011a; Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011; Sadler
et al., 2011b). The presence of so-called hillocks (whose height and diameter typ-
ically range from 1 to 3 nm and from 50 to 200 nm, respectively) is systematic,
and it has been the subject of numerous publications in the recent literature
(Sadler et al., 2009a; Sadler et al., 2011a; Miao et al., 2010; Kim-Chauveau
et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2011; Lorenz et al., 2008). Their precise origin is
still unclear. Indium segregation can also occur around threading dislocations.
Finally, V-defects appear either on top of threading dislocations or without any
dislocation from a certain critical InAlN thickness.
Hillocks. The formation of hillocks is observed by all the groups growing InAlN
layers by MOVPE, whatever the substrate type (Sadler et al., 2009a; Sadler
et al., 2011a; Miao et al., 2010; Kim-Chauveau et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2011;
Lorenz et al., 2008). A typical atomic-force microscopy (AFM) image of a 50-nm
thick In0.2Al0.8N layer grown on a FS-GaN substrate with a dislocation density
∼4 × 107 cm−2 is shown in Fig. 6.3. Hillocks with a diameter of 50–100 nm and
a height of ∼1 nm are aligned along atomic steps. The origin of these hillocks
is not fully understood yet, but they might play a role regarding the optical
properties of those layers as reported hereafter (Chen et al., 2010).
Dislocations. In the relevant literature, growth is generally performed on
(0001) GaN templates grown on sapphire. Consequently, threading dislocations
are inevitably present in the templates, and they propagate in the InAlN lay-
ers. Indium segregation has been shown to occur around those dislocations, as
conﬁrmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) (Song et al., 2010;
5.67 nm

Kioseoglou et al., 2011). Such In-rich dislocations are known to act as highly
conductive channels, which are detrimental to the eﬃciency of devices (Song
et al., 2010; Kioseoglou et al., 2011).
A quantitative study relying on TEM techniques such as Z-contrast imaging,
strain measurement, and EDX, and also including a systematic comparison of
experimental results with calculations using an elastostatic free-energy model,
has been reported (Mouti et al., 2011). Thus, for edge-type threading disloca-
tions this model shows that one half of the (0001) plane is under tensile strain,
while the second half is under compressive strain. Consequently, indium segreg-
ation should occur in the tensile region, because In atoms are bigger than Al
atoms. This was indeed conﬁrmed by high-resolution Z-contrast images showing
that indium segregation occurs only on the tensile side of the dislocation core.
Concerning screw dislocations, it is theoretically predicted that indium should se-
gregate on the core of the dislocation because of the stress ﬁeld. Experimentally,
such an In-rich region was also observed exactly on the core of the dislocation
on a high-resolution Z-contrast image. Using molecular dynamics calculations,
it was also shown that indium should segregate around screw dislocations in the
InAlN alloy (Lei et al., 2010). Such segregation phenomena occurring on dislo-
cations illustrate the importance of performing growth on FS-GaN substrates
to minimize the formation of conductive channels that detrimentally aﬀect the
eﬃciency of optoelectronic devices.
V-defects formed on top of threading dislocations. V-defects (or V-pits) are
inverted empty pyramids with a hexagonal base, which are often observed in
In-based alloys such as InGaN and InAlN. As shown in numerous studies, dis-
locations with a Burgers vector with a screw component lead to the formation
of a V-defect in InAlN ﬁlms LM to GaN, whereas pure edge dislocations do
not (Miao et al., 2009; Mouti et al., 2011; Song et al., 2010). However, it
was also observed that under speciﬁc conditions, V-defects can also appear
on top of pure edge dislocations (Venn´egu`es et al., 2012). Indium segregation
around the core of threading dislocations with a screw component could be re-
sponsible for the formation of V-defects as proposed for InGaN layers (Shiojiri
et al., 2006). Indium-rich regions would then favor the formation of inclined
facets, as shown by ﬁrst-principles calculations (Northrup and Neugebauer,
1999).
V-defects not due to threading dislocations. In addition to the V-defects which
are present on top of threading dislocations, smaller V-defects not connected to
any dislocations have also been observed lately (Miao et al., 2010; Venn´egu`es
et al., 2012). This is consistent with the fact that the density of V-defects is
not systematically correlated to the density of threading dislocations (Sadler
et al., 2010). Because these smaller V-defects were ﬁrst observed in the case of
In-rich compressively-strained InAlN layers, it was concluded that they origin-
ate from the relaxation of the compressive strain (Miao et al., 2010). However,
Venn´egu`es et al. (2012) also observed those smaller V-defects not connected to
any dislocations in InAlN layers with an indium concentration between 15.5 and

184
Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
16%, i.e., for layers under tensile strain (Venn´egu`es et al., 2012). These smaller
V-defects appeared from a thickness of 100 nm.
To acquire a deeper understanding of such defects, 100-nm thick In0.2Al0.8N
layers grown on FS-GaN substrates with a nominal threading dislocation density
of 4 × 107 cm−2 (i.e., 1.6 dislocations for a 2 × 2 μm2 area) have been charac-
terized. On the AFM image (Fig. 6.4), hillocks and V-defects occurring at the
core of bigger hillocks are visible. The density of V-defects is much larger than
the dislocation density, thereby indicating that threading dislocations are not
the only origin for the formation of V-defects. The reason why such defects
can nucleate in InAlN ﬁlms is not properly understood at the moment, but the
literature about GaN and InGaN ﬁlms can provide some useful clues. Those
defects could be due to residual impurities like O, or to residual doping, as it
was previously shown that the V-defect density in GaN increased with O, Mg,
or Si doping (Liliental-Weber et al., 1997). It could also originate from struc-
tural defects other than threading dislocations (Cho et al., 2001) or to In-rich
dots (Northrup and Neugebauer, 1999; Watanabe et al., 2003). Eventually, it
was shown that V-defects could release the strain in compressed InGaN layers
(Song, 2005; Won et al., 2010). It could also be the case in slightly compressed
In0.2Al0.8N layers.
Structure and composition of V-defects. Figure 6.5 is a schematic of a typical
V-defect. The six facets of the V-defect are generally {11¯2x} ones (Kehagias
et al., 2009; Kehagias et al., 2011; Mouti et al., 2011; Venn´egu`es et al., 2012),
but for thick samples, {1¯101} facets may also appear (Venn´egu`es et al., 2012;

of dislocations, Z-contrast imaging and EDX measurements reveal that indium
atoms also segregate on the six ⟨1¯10x⟩branches of the V-defects. While V-defects
are growing, it gives In-rich {11¯20} triangular portions of planes under them.
When observing the samples in the ⟨0001⟩direction, it gives six branches clearly
visible on TEM images (Kehagias et al., 2009; Kehagias et al., 2011; Mouti
et al., 2011; Venn´egu`es et al., 2012).
A similar V-defect is visible in Fig. 6.6: on the Z-contrast scanning TEM
(STEM) image taken in the ⟨0001⟩direction, bright branches are visible because
of indium segregation occurring along the ⟨1¯10x⟩branches of the V-defect.
MOVPE-grown InAlN layers LM to GaN: critical thickness for phase separation.
Hums et al. (2007) found that InAlN layers with an indium composition ranging
between 13% and 31% are single-phase and fully-strained on GaN for the thick-
nesses considered (16 nm for 31.1% of indium, 43 nm for 16.6% of indium).
Similar results were also found for thin InAlN layers (14 nm) with an indium
composition ranging between 13% and 18% (Darakchieva et al., 2008). However,

thicker layers covering the same range of indium composition (thickness ∼100
nm), though single-phase, were partially relaxed (Darakchieva et al., 2008).
InAlN layers of identical thickness but with a larger nominal indium content
exhibited spontaneous phase separation, with the ﬁrst 65 nm characterized by
an indium content of 22% and the next 35 nm with 26.4% of indium. Another
group published similar change of composition for a 120-nm thick layer, with the
ﬁrst sublayer containing 24% of In and the second one 19% (Lorenz et al., 2008).
The change in composition was accompanied by a three-dimensional (3D) mor-
phology with an increased roughness rising from 1 to 6 nm. It was attributed to
strain relaxation. A change in morphology from 2D to 3D has also been observed
and attributed to strain relaxation mediated by the Stranski–Krastanov mech-
anism in a weakly strained ﬁlm (Krost et al., 2011), but without unambiguous
signature that such a strain-relaxation mechanism indeed occurs. A change in
composition was observed for an InAlN layer grown on sapphire with a nom-
inal indium content of 18%, close to the LM composition (Redondo-Cubero
et al., 2010). Spontaneously, the 50-nm thick In0.18Al0.82N layer transformed
into an In0.15Al0.85N upper layer. It was then deduced that the morphological
degradation and the lower indium content were not due to strain relaxation. A
degradation occurring beyond a certain critical thickness was also observed by
TEM (Kret et al., 2011). It was shown that a homogeneous layer was obtained for
an indium content close to LM conditions for thicknesses up to ∼100 nm, whereas
a columnar structure with phase separation appears on InAlN layers with a nom-
inal indium content of 20% and 27% from a critical thickness of 200 and 10 nm,
respectively.

Growth and structural properties of bulk InAlN layers
187
A mechanism has been proposed to explain this change of composition (Chen
et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012). First, V-defects appear on top of threading dislo-
cations, followed by the coalescence of those V-defects. Then, growth occurs on
the inclined facets of the V-defects, which leads to a rough upper layer with a
lower indium composition. This probably explains why two layers with diﬀerent
compositions have been observed by other groups, the upper one being rougher
(Redondo-Cubero et al., 2010; Hums et al., 2007; Darakchieva et al., 2008; Lorenz
et al., 2008). However, some V-defects are not linked with threading dislocations
on TEM images (Chen et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012). It is probable that V-defects
also appear without the need for threading dislocation as mentioned previously.
Then they coalesce, leading to an InAlN upper layer with a diﬀerent composi-
tion and a columnar structure as described by Kret et al. (2011). This is further
illustrated by TEM observations performed on a 500-nm thick In0.2Al0.8N layer
grown on a FS-GaN substrate (see Fig. 6.7) where a similar columnar upper layer
is indeed visible from a certain thickness despite the absence of dislocations.
To summarize, the mechanism responsible for the degradation of InAlN lay-
ers would proceed as follows. First, hillocks are formed at the beginning of the
growth, for thicknesses below 50 nm. Then, V-defects progressively appear, for
an InAlN thickness ranging from 50 to 200 nm, on top of threading dislocations
or not via a mechanism not yet elucidated. Finally, those V-defects coalesce, for
an InAlN thickness about 100–200 nm, and an upper columnar InAlN layer
with a diﬀerent average composition is subsequently formed because of the
growth which proceeds on the inclined facets of the V-defects. To conclude this
section, it seems crucial to understand the V-defect formation in order to pos-
sibly avoid or at least minimize the degradation of InAlN layers with increasing
thickness.

Optical and electronic properties of bulk InAlN layers
Following the description of the main structural properties of bulk InAlN layers,
it is of relevant interest to focus on their optical and electronic properties. Among
the important parameters which are still under debate, we can cite the case
of the bandgap bowing parameter b. Indeed, a speciﬁc issue with this ternary
alloy is that there is no convergence toward a single value for b that would
correctly reproduce the variation in the bandgap, depending on whether the
epilayers of interest are indium- or aluminum-rich. The reason could be ascribed
to various causes that are listed hereafter. First, it is worth pointing out that
an accurate determination of b should rely on a consistent set of experimental
data, i.e., the position of the band edge should be derived by a given technique.
Obviously, mixing photoluminescence (PL) and absorption measurements does
not make sense, all the more since the extremely large Stokes shift measured in
this ternary alloy would lead to a huge scatter in the data. Anyhow, as far as PL is
concerned, a signiﬁcant variation is expected for the Stokes shift (S), independent
of the layer quality, since the degree of disorder is likely to vary across the whole
composition range. It has thus been highlighted via ab initio calculations that
the strong variations reported experimentally for the value of the band gap of the
InAlN alloy could originate from the varying degree of indium clustering at the
local scale, i.e., depending on whether a perfect random alloy or a clustered one
is considered (Gorczyca et al., 2009; Gorczyca et al., 2010). Note in this respect
that even for MOVPE-grown layers with the same nominal indium content the
two types of structural conﬁguration might occur (Gorczyca et al., 2010). In
any case, the determination of b based on absorption measurements appears
much more suitable. In addition, another parameter of signiﬁcant importance to
properly consider to derive b is the strain state of the InAlN layer of interest.
Indeed, even if the substrate of choice for the growth of such layers is usually
c-plane sapphire, the underlying template on which the InAlN layer is grown can
be either AlN or GaN. For a given indium content, the InAlN layers will therefore
always experience a compressive strain if grown on an AlN template, whereas
for layers grown on GaN templates they could be either compressively (In-rich
layers) or tensely strained or even be strain-free. To date, the most accurate
treatment regarding the dependence of b in the InAlN alloy is probably that given
by Sakalauskas et al. (2010). In this work, the strain inﬂuence on the band-gap
energy is readily accounted for via a k · p model which includes the strain-induced
energy shift, which then allows derivation of the unstrained band gap for the
whole In composition range. Using the conventional empirical expression:

closely related to that introduced by Iliopoulos et al. (2008), where a modiﬁed
bowing parameter b1(x) expressed as
b1(x) =

(6.4)
is considered. The justiﬁcation for the introduction of such a composition-
dependent bowing parameter is ascribed to the signiﬁcant charge transfer
occurring in the InAlN alloy when spanning the whole composition range, owing
to the large electronegativity diﬀerence between aluminum and indium atoms
(Iliopoulos et al., 2008; Ferhat and Bechstedt, 2002).
Another puzzling feature of bulk InAlN layers nearly LM to GaN originates
from their unusually large Stokes shift, which can reach a value equal to 0.8–1 eV
(Butt´e et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Carlin et al., 2005). A
broad luminescence line is usually monitored in the 330–340 nm range both in
PL (Butt´e et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008) and in cathodo-
luminescence (CL) (Wei et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2011), whose exact origin is
presently unknown. Its redshift with increasing temperature remains well below
the usual dependence expected for the band edge, thereby underlying strong car-
rier localization. So far, no clear consensus has been reached to know whether
a direct connection could be drawn between composition ﬂuctuations and the
origin of the luminescence, since even thin homogeneous layers (∼40–50 nm
thick) grown by MOVPE with no apparent phase separation reported, e.g., via
Z-contrast imaging in STEM or EDX, also exhibit such an anomalously large
Stokes shift. The large S value could possibly be intrinsic to the InAlN alloy.
It could indeed originate from the numerous possible conﬁgurations for the In
atoms within atom-supercells, each of them being characterized with diﬀerent
energy gaps leading to diﬀerent signatures in absorption or emission spectra
(de Carvalho et al., 2012). Chen et al. (2010) decomposed the broad struc-
tureless luminescence lineshape into two components, with a low-energy band
ascribed to recombinations occurring in the hillocks that would act as quantum
dot-like structures. For PAMBE-grown layers, the lateral phase separation lead-
ing to indium-rich walls surrounding honeycomb cells could potentially explain
the Stokes shift with respect to the absorption edge (Butt´e et al., 2007; Zhou

190
Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
et al., 2007). Such luminescence could also originate from deep defects, but no
ﬁrm demonstration has been reported in the literature. In particular, no clear
correlation could be made between the luminescence and the V-defects, which
would act as localized exciton recombination centers or deep-level impurities, as
has been done for InGaN MQW layers (Wu et al., 1998). Note also that spectra
extracted from polarization-resolved PL measurements performed on such layers
exhibit only random polarization (Taniyasu, 2012). The latter further support
the localized nature of the carriers, whereas for such an Al-rich ternary alloy
the polarization selection rules would suggest a stronger edge luminescence with
respect to the surface one, i.e., the emitted light with E//c would dominate over
E⊥c. (Taniyasu, 2012).
Studies addressing the value of the optical refractive index nop for InAlN
layers LM to GaN are also extremely scarce (Carlin and Ilegems, 2003;
Aschenbrenner et al., 2010; Sakalauskas et al., 2010; Carlin et al., 2005). The ﬁrst
report made by Carlin and Ilegems when demonstrating the successful fabrication
of highly reﬂective crack-free InAlN/GaN DBRs showed that in the blue–green
wavelength range the refractive index contrast to GaN Δnop/nop amounts to
about 7–8%. It was highlighted that for such InAlN layers with an indium con-
tent of 17–18% the dispersion of nop in the green-to-UV range is well matching
that of the AlGaN alloy with an aluminum content of 46% (Carlin et al., 2005),
as experimentally determined by Brunner et al. (1997). This is further conﬁrmed
by the good agreement observed between reﬂectivity measurements performed
on Bragg mirrors or vertical cavity structures and corresponding transfer matrix
simulations. A more systematic study of the spectral dependence of nop for in-
dium contents in the 10–24% range has been recently performed by variable-angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry (Aschenbrenner et al., 2010; Sakalauskas et al., 2010),
where the experimental dielectric function is accounted for by a conventional mul-
tilayer including surface roughness eﬀects via the Bruggeman eﬀective medium
approximation. For InAlN layers LM to GaN, a good qualitative agreement with
past studies (Carlin and Ilegems, 2003; Sakalauskas et al., 2010) is reported con-
sidering all the above-mentioned issues that can aﬀect the quality and the growth
of this ternary alloy. Another parameter of particular relevance is the band align-
ment at the InAlN/GaN heterointerface. Discarding spontaneous polarization
mismatch issues in this LM system leading to the formation of two-dimensional
electron gases, it was recently shown by means of X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) that the band alignment is probably of type I with a small
valence-band oﬀset (VBO) equal to 0.2 ± 0.3 eV (Akazawa et al., 2010). Thus
it means that the conduction-band oﬀset (CBO) is as large as 0.9–1.0 ± 0.3 eV,
thereby indicating a signiﬁcant deviation with respect to the common anion rule,
as the CBO:VBO ratio is much higher than 70:30. Such a small VBO value is in
agreement with that computed for the evolution of the conduction and valence
band edge positions with respect to the vacuum level for the InAlN alloy, by
Jones et al. (2008). Note also that such a CBO:VBO ratio does not seem to
have a noticeable impact on the interband transition energy of InAlN/GaN QW

Optical features of GaN/InAlN quantum wells
In a previous review on InAlN layers LM to GaN we highlighted the interest
of GaN/InAlN single and multiple QWs for optoelectronic applications (Butt´e
et al., 2007). Besides the large CBO making such heterostructures suitable for the
fabrication of high-speed mid-infrared intersubband photodetectors and modu-
lators operating in the 2.4–4 μm range (Nicolay et al., 2005), they could represent
a promising alternative to the GaN/AlGaN system to realize eﬃcient interband
light-emitters. We recall that owing to their strain-free nature, LM GaN/InAlN
QWs grown along the c-axis will only experience a built-in electric ﬁeld due to
the spontaneous polarization mismatch occurring at the heterointerfaces, which
is speciﬁc to this layer combination for this crystalline orientation. It was shown
experimentally that those single wells experience a built-in ﬁeld amounting to
∼3.64 MV·cm−1 (Butt´e et al., 2007). Such a value is in good agreement with that
deduced from calculations for GaN/InAlN heterostructures with an indium con-
tent of 10–25% pseudomorphically grown on a GaN epilayer which includes the
piezoelectric polarization (obviously this component is equal to zero for a per-
fectly LM heterostructure), and the non-linear dependence of the spontaneous
polarization discontinuity with varying indium content.
To illustrate the interesting prospects of GaN/InAlN QWs as light-emitters,
we compare in Fig. 6.8(a) the room-temperature PL spectrum of three types of
representative 2-nm thick single QWs, namely a GaN/Al0.17Ga0.83N QW, a LM
GaN/InAlN QW and an In0.17Ga0.83N/GaN one, measured using the UV line
(λ = 244 nm) of a frequency-doubled cw Ar+ laser operating in the low-density
regime (i.e., in absence of screening of the built-in ﬁeld) and detected by a mono-
chromator UV-enhanced CCD combination. Unsurprisingly, the intensity of the
InGaN/GaN QW well exceeds that of the GaN/AlGaN one, as expected for such
a ternary QW where localization eﬀects are known to ensure a high radiative
eﬃciency up to room temperature. However, we can notice that for a similar emis-
sion wavelength—∼350 nm, i.e., in a spectral region where quantization eﬀects
still dominate over the quantum conﬁned Stark eﬀect (QCSE)—the GaN/InAlN
QW outperforms the GaN/AlGaN one. As an illustration in Fig. 6.8(b), the ratio
of the integrated PL intensity (I) at various temperatures up to 300 K (I300K)
to that measured at 10 K (I10K) is displayed for the three above-mentioned
single QWs. If we make the usual, optimistic and crude, assumption that the
I300K/I10K ratio is a reliable indicator of the internal quantum eﬃciency (IQE)
at RT (thus assuming that at 10 K only radiative recombinations occur), the
three systems exhibit an IQE of 32% for the present InGaN/GaN QW vs. 4.6%
and 0.4% for the GaN/InAlN and the GaN/AlGaN ones, respectively. It therefore

demonstrates the promising potential of LM GaN/InAlN heterostructures for the
realization of eﬃcient near-UV light emitters. The reason for the larger IQE of
GaN/InAlN QWs compared to the GaN/AlGaN ones could be two-fold. First,
the former exhibit a larger localization energy with respect to the latter, for
which it is typically smaller than 20 meV. In addition, the band oﬀsets are lar-
ger, which leads to a better quantum conﬁnement. Both features could prevent
thermalization escape phenomena toward non-radiative centers to occur in the
GaN/InAlN QW system.

Growth properties
As already mentioned, InAlN with an In content of ∼18% is lattice-matched to
GaN while exhibiting a refractive index contrast to GaN of 7–8% in the blue–
green wavelength range (Carlin and Ilegems, 2003). This makes such an alloy of
great interest for the realization of III-nitride-based high-quality DBRs. Other
approaches usually rely either on the use of AlGaN/GaN (Waldrip et al., 2001;
www.ebook3000.com

Natali et al., 2003) or AlN/GaN (Ng et al., 2000) bilayers. The main draw-
back of such systems is the large in-plane lattice parameter mismatch between
the diﬀerent layers composing the DBR, causing a large build-up of the strain
with an increasing number of pairs, which eventually results in cracks and
misﬁt dislocation generation. A strain-compensation technique based on su-
perlattice interlayers has been proposed to improve the quality of AlN/GaN
DBRs (Huang et al., 2006), and it has even led to the demonstration of blue
cw electrically driven vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) on sap-
phire (Lu et al., 2010). However, such a method is not suited for devices grown
on low-dislocation-density FS-GaN substrates since the accumulated strain with
this bilayer system would inevitably generate threading dislocations, without
resulting in a signiﬁcant gain over growth carried out on a sapphire substrate.
InAlN-based DBRs with a stopband centered either in the UV (Feltin
et al., 2006) or in the visible (Butt´e et al., 2005) range have been demonstrated
on c-plane sapphire. Reﬂectivity spectra measured on such DBRs are depicted
in Fig. 6.9. For the realization of UV DBRs, AlGaN is used as the second layer
together with InAlN in order to avoid GaN absorption below 370 nm. Such UV
DBRs have been successfully used to demonstrate RT polariton lasing in nitride-
based microcavities (Christopoulos et al., 2007; Christmann et al., 2008), and
DBRs with a stopband in the visible region have been used for the realization
of electrically driven resonant-cavity light-emitting diodes (Dorsaz et al., 2005b)
and optically pumped VCSELs (Feltin et al., 2007a).
The transfer of such DBRs on FS-GaN substrates would allow a great increase
in the device performances, due to the much lower threading dislocation density
that would directly beneﬁt the device internal eﬃciency, and improved thermal
management. However, the growth of such DBRs on FS-GaN is not straightfor-
ward. Indeed, having fewer threading dislocations also means a reduced residual
strain accommodation. In this context, a careful growth optimization of such

Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
DBRs on FS-GaN has to be performed. It has been found that the indium-to-
aluminum precursor gas ﬂux ratio has to be large in order to ensure ﬂat interfaces
and a smooth DBR top surface as well as an optimum peak reﬂectivity (Cosendey
et al., 2011). This has been ascribed to indium surface segregation—a well-known
eﬀect occurring in indium-containing ternary alloys of the III-nitride and the III-
arsenide family, which is due to the much larger bond length involving indium
atoms compared to aluminum or gallium ones (Massies et al., 1987). A pos-
sible explanation for the way indium surface segregation aﬀects the quality of
InAlN-based DBRs is the following. In the presence of a few InAlN atomic layers
with an indium content much lower than the LM value, at the beginning of each
InAlN layer the lattice-matched condition in such sublayers is no longer fulﬁlled,
so that a large tensile strain builds up. Then, depending on the indium sur-
face segregation coeﬃcient, the total thickness of those indium-poor sublayers
might eventually reach the critical thickness where strain is no longer accom-
modated by elastic deformation but causes the generation of misﬁt dislocations.
Subsequently, it has been assumed that increasing the indium-to-aluminum pre-
cursor gas ratio reduces the indium surface segregation coeﬃcient by increasing
the amount of indium adatoms on the sample surface during growth. By doing so,
the nominal indium content satisfying the lattice-matched condition is reached
before the critical thickness.
Another point that has to be stressed once more concerning the MOVPE
growth of InAlN-based DBRs is the large-growth temperature diﬀerence between
GaN (about 1050◦C) and InAlN (about 850◦C). This means that when consid-
ering the most basic approach for growing such DBRs the surface of each InAlN
layer is subject to a temperature ramp up to 1050◦C. This is above the thermal
stability of lattice-matched InAlN, which is about 960◦C (Gadanecz et al., 2007).
Indeed, such an annealing step greatly aﬀects the InAlN surface morphology
(Brice et al., 2010). Figure 6.10 shows two AFM images, the ﬁrst one for an
as-grown 50-nm thick InAlN layer LM to GaN (Fig. 6.10(a)) and the second one
for a similar 50-nm thick InAlN layer that has been annealed in situ at 1065◦C
for two minutes (Fig. 6.10(b)). Both layers have been grown on a FS-GaN sub-
strate under the same conditions than for InAlN layers inserted in the DBRs
exhibiting the best optical properties. The AFM images show that after an-
nealing the surface morphology switches from small hillocks to a mesh of small
cracks. To illustrate the impact of the temperature ramp, Fig. 6.10(c) shows a
Z-contrast STEM image of an InAlN/GaN DBR. InAlN layers appear darker
than GaN ones due to their lighter atomic weight. But, close to the InAlN/GaN
interfaces, InAlN layers are even darker, suggesting that indium desorption in-
deed occurs during the temperature ramp. To circumvent this drawback, Sadler
et al. (2009b) proposed two solutions for the growth of GaN layers used in DBRs.
They can be grown at low temperature, but it results in a ﬁnger-like GaN surface
morphology, which is detrimental to the reﬂectivity of the DBRs. The second ap-
proach relies on the low-temperature growth of a thin GaN sublayer followed by
a temperature ramp and the subsequent growth of GaN at high temperature.

This latter method seems much more promising, since it should not alter the
GaN surface morphology while preventing indium desorption at each InAlN/GaN
interface.
6.5.2
Optical properties
As discussed previously, the substrate should have a crucial impact on the qual-
ity of III-nitride based heterostructures. As an illustration, we brieﬂy discuss
the quality of LM InAlN/GaN DBRs grown onto two diﬀerent types of c-plane
FS-GaN substrates. The ﬁrst substrate type exhibits a dislocation density of
1 × 106 cm−2, whereas the second substrate exhibits a larger dislocation density
amounting to 4 × 107 cm−2. Identical growth conditions were employed for the
two DBRs (see Cosendey et al. (2011)) except for a slight variation in the layer
thicknesses resulting in a stopband shift of ∼20 nm. AFM scans of the ﬁnal top
GaN layer have been performed on both structures to compare the dislocation
density. For the DBR grown on the second substrate, a dislocation density sim-
ilar to that of the substrate is found, in strong contrast with the DBR grown
on the high quality FS-GaN substrate for which a dislocation density of 1 × 109
cm−2 is extracted. This larger dislocation density might be ascribed to a slight

196
Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
diﬀerence in the indium surface segregation coeﬃcient originating from the dif-
ferent thermal conductivity for the two substrates. In addition to standard
structural characterization tools (namely AFM, scanning, and transmission elec-
tron microscopes) the following characterization method has been used: on top of
both DBRs a seven-pair ZrO2/SiO2 Bragg mirror has been deposited by electron-
beam evaporation, resulting in λ/2 GaN-ZrO2 cavities. Afterwards, the in-plane
disorder, which is directly linked to the DBR structural and optical properties,
has been probed through 2D micro-transmission mappings using the continuous
spectrum of a xenon lamp as the incident light source. The light was focused
down to a spot size ∼2 μm in diameter on the sample, using a long working
distance near UV microscope objective (×100) with a numerical aperture of 0.5.
The transmitted light was then collected by a UV ﬁber in far-ﬁeld conﬁguration
ensuring an angular selection of ∼0.6◦. Transmission spectra of the cavities have
been acquired every micron over a 50 × 50 μm2 area (Fig. 6.11). For the DBR
structure grown onto the low-dislocation-density substrate (Fig. 6.11, left-hand
column) a low photonic disorder is evidenced. The cavity mode position is ﬂuc-
tuating by ±0.45 nm (∼0.1%) and can be related to cavity thickness changes
of ±1 nm, which is similar to the rms surface roughness determined by AFM.
The quality factor (Q) for the microcavity grown onto the high-quality FS-GaN
substrate reaches values up to 800, matching those deduced from transfer matrix
simulations. On the other hand, for the DBR structure grown onto the interme-
diate dislocation density substrate (Fig. 6.11, right-hand column), the photonic
disorder is considerably increased. The Q factor only amounts to half that of
the former one, whereas an identical value was expected a priori. Such an ana-
lysis clearly demonstrates that the dislocation density measured on the ﬁnal top
GaN layer does not play a crucial role for the achievement of samples character-
ized with a low photonic disorder. The observed diﬀerence might originate from
diﬀerent polishing procedures used for the two kinds of substrate.
6.5.3
Applications
As far as UV InAlN/AlGaN DBRs are concerned, they proved instrumental in
achieving RT polariton lasing in III-nitride microcavities. In such a case the
coupling strength between the cavity photon mode and the excitons in the act-
ive material overcomes their damping rates, allowing the system to enter into a
non-perturbative regime, the so-called strong-coupling regime (SCR). The new
eigenmodes of the system are then the lower and upper polaritons. In the low-
density limit these quasiparticles behave as bosons, and polariton condensation
is triggered when the ground-state occupancy exceeds unity. The spontaneous
decay of this macroscopic quantum state results in a non-linear coherent emis-
sion, often referred to as polariton lasing, which is expected to happen at a
lower threshold current density than in the case of the conventional stimulated
emission ruled by the Bernard–Durrafourg condition, as is the case for VCSELs
(Imamoglu et al., 1996).

An appropriate choice for the active medium to perform SCR studies is the
spectrally narrow excitonic transition of bulk GaN or that of GaN/AlGaN QWs
(Feltin et al., 2007b). Such an active medium requires UV DBRs. As men-
tioned previously, AlGaN layers are used together with InAlN layers. Indeed
AlGaN can be grown LM to InAlN by decreasing the indium content in the
latter (xIn < 18%). On a thirty-ﬁve-pair In0.15Al0.85N/Al0.2Ga0.8N DBR a peak

reﬂectivity of 99.3% has been measured at 340 nm (Feltin et al., 2006). As the
DBR is no longer LM to the GaN buﬀer layer, a strain-engineering solution re-
lying on the use of short-period GaN/AlN superlattices has been successfully
employed to avoid the formation of cracks (Feltin et al., 2006). When completed
by a top dielectric DBR, high-quality factor cavities can be formed. In this way,
polariton lasing under optical pumping has been observed in such cavities, using
either bulk GaN as an active medium (Christopoulos et al., 2007) or GaN/AlGaN
MQWs (Christmann et al., 2008), which oﬀer the advantage of a larger exciton
binding energy and oscillator strength compared with their bulk counterpart.
InAlN/GaN DBRs grown on c-plane FS-GaN substrate have also been used
for the realization of optically pumped vertical external cavity surface-emitting
lasers (VECSELs) (Zeng et al., 2012). A forty-two-pair DBR has been over-
grown by a high-temperature (HT) GaN layer followed by an active region made
of twenty-four InGaN (2 nm)/GaN (4.5 nm) QWs capped with another HT GaN
layer for a total optical cavity thickness of 5λ/2. The high crystalline quality of
the DBR allows obtaining a half-cavity with a very smooth top surface (rms
surface roughness of 0.20 nm measured on a 10 × 10 μm2 AFM scan). The inset
in Fig. 6.12 shows a 2 × 2 μm2 AFM scan of the surface of the VECSEL sample,
which is characterized with regular atomic steps indicating that the growth pro-
ceeds under the step-ﬂow growth mode. A top dielectric DBR consisting of four
SiO2/ZrO2 pairs with a peak reﬂectivity of 86.6% has then been deposited on the
sample. As reference, a second identical sample has received a top DBR made
of seven pairs of SiO2/ZrO2, exhibiting a peak reﬂectivity of 98.1%. This latter
sample has been used in a VCSEL conﬁguration in order to evaluate the quality

of the structure. The sample has been optically pumped using the 355 nm line of
a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser, and exhibits lasing with an average threshold
power of about 260 W/cm2. Spectra measured below and above threshold are
shown in Fig. 6.12. Then, both samples have been mounted in an external cavity
conﬁguration, using an external concave mirror with a reﬂectivity of 99.5% and
a curvature radius of 50 mm. The threshold pump power and the lasing mode
linewidth decrease when the external cavity length is increased from 25 mm to
50 mm. This is ascribed to a decreasing cavity mode size when approaching
the semi-confocal conﬁguration, and to reduced external cavity losses for longer
VECSEL cavities. The main advantage of a VECSEL with such a large external
cavity is the possibility of inserting intracavity elements such as a saturable
absorber for the realization of mode-locked VECSELs.
Another application of high-quality highly reﬂective InAlN-based DBRs is
the realization of monolithic VCSELs grown on FS-GaN substrate (Cosendey
et al., 2012), which could be a serious alternative to hybrid VCSELs using two
dielectric DBRs (Omae et al., 2009; Onishi et al., 2012). The main advantage of
the monolithic approach is a much easier process ﬂow, avoiding the requirement
for removing the cavity from the substrate and the subsequent wafer bonding
step, and which also makes the cavity thickness control much easier. VCSEL
structures made of a 7λ cavity comprising a 5 InGaN/InGaN QW active region
centered at one of the antinodes of the optical ﬁeld were grown on a forty-two-
pair InAlN/GaN DBR on FS-GaN. Devices were processed using a standard
ITO current spreading layer as the top p-electrode, and a passivated p-GaN sur-
face followed by a top seven-pair TiO2/SiO2 DBR. Details about this epitaxial
structure and processing are given elsewhere (Cosendey et al., 2012). The elec-
troluminescence (EL) intensity vs. pulsed driving current characteristics of such
devices are shown in Fig. 6.13(a) for a device with a 60-μm mesa diameter and

a 8-μm current aperture. The pulse width is 200 ns and the duty cycle 1%. The
lasing threshold current is about 70 mA. The measured spontaneous emission
coupling factor is as high as 6.3 × 10−2, but it might be slightly overestimated
because of the lack of points for high injection currents. The corresponding EL
spectra, measured below and above lasing thresholds, are depicted in Fig. 6.13(b).
The cavity mode is well centered with respect to the stopband of the bottom
InAlN-based DBR, which can be clearly seen on the spectra.
A possible further improvement for electrically driven devices making use of
such InAlN-based DBRs would be to develop conductive Bragg mirrors. It would
allow avoiding the requirement for intra-cavity contacts, which would lead to
shorter cavities. Concerning n-doped DBRs, the doping of InAlN and GaN layers
should not be an issue, but the free charge planes appearing at the interfaces
due to the polarization mismatch between InAlN and GaN layers should be
properly considered in order to ensure a good vertical current transport through
such DBRs. On the other hand, the development of p-doped DBR would be
more challenging. It would avoid the use of any transparent conductive oxide
as a current-spreading layer inside the VCSEL cavity, which would decrease the
losses and thus reduce the threshold current density.
Another route to explore would be the development and study of semipolar
and/or non-polar InAlN layers. Devices using such DBRs would have the no-
ticeable property to exhibit a reduced QCSE in their QW-based active region.
This would not only increase the oscillator strength of the QWs, but could also
result in new device properties. Thus, recently a non-polar VCSEL has been
demonstrated which exhibits polarization-locked light emission inherited from
the in-plane crystalline anisotropy of the QWs (Holder et al., 2012). However,
the in-plane lattice parameter anisotropy along such an orientation would not
allow for perfectly LM conditions to GaN contrary to the situation occurring
along the c-axis. We would rather refer to strain minimization instead.

InAlN cladding layers for edge-emitting lasers
One of the most important aspects to keep in mind for the design of a nitride-
based LD structure is the optical mode conﬁnement into the waveguide. In this
respect, the optical characteristics of InAlN layers with a composition lattice-
matched to GaN make this material system a perfect candidate for the fabrication
of claddings in GaN-based LDs with an emission wavelength ranging from the
UV to the green. They could thus advantageously substitute for the commonly
used AlGaN claddings.
As can be deduced from the work of Brunner et al. (1997), the AlGaN alloy
exhibits a rather low refractive index contrast to GaN in the range of com-
positions having a small lattice-mismatch with the latter (a few percent in Al
composition). Such a low refractive index contrast makes high optical mode
conﬁnement in the active region harder to achieve. For the same reason, the
transversal optical mode will probably extend into the GaN substrate, giving

InAlN cladding layers for edge-emitting lasers

rise to a poor far-ﬁeld quality. Thick GaN/AlGaN superlattices or bulk AlGaN
cladding layers with low Al content are therefore required in order to decouple
the laser structure from the n-GaN substrate and provide at the same time the
suitable optical mode conﬁnement (Nakamura, 1997; Sitar et al., 1990). As a
matter of fact, AlxGa1−xN alloys with an Al content well below 10% are widely
used as cladding materials for violet and blue LDs. A typical violet LD epitaxial
structure emitting at 415 nm is shown in Fig. 6.14(a), together with the corres-
ponding refractive index and simulated near-ﬁeld intensity proﬁles (Fig. 6.14(b)).
Depending on the bottom cladding thickness, the guided mode can extend into
the underlying GaN substrate (Fig. 6.14(b)), giving rise to optical losses and to
a poor optical conﬁnement.
The mode leakage into the substrate also aﬀects the beam quality of the LD
devices. Modeling of the LD structure shown in Fig. 6.14(a) with bottom and
upper Al0.07Ga0.93N claddings shows that although a bottom cladding with a
thickness of at least 1 μm would be suitable for the achievement of high optical
mode conﬁnement into the waveguide (Fig. 6.15(a)), this thickness would not be
enough to provide a high-quality transverse emission pattern (Fig. 6.15(b)). A
narrow intensity peak located at negative angle around –10◦is observed. It is
due to the mode leakage occurring in the GaN substrate. In order to suppress
this parasitic peak, the mode leakage in the substrate has to be further reduced.
Hence, bottom claddings with a minimum thickness of 2 μm should be grown.
It is then straightforward to conceive that the problem becomes even more
critical when moving toward emission wavelengths in the blue–green region
(λ > 450 nm). Diﬀerent approaches have been proposed to circumvent this issue
(Yoshizumi et al., 2009; Tyagi et al., 2010). One solution is to grow AlGaN-free
structures on non-polar or semi-polar GaN substrates, including thick InGaN

QWs and InGaN inner guides (Yoshizumi et al., 2009). Although the published
results are quite promising, the lack of proper substrates could eventually be a
major issue in terms of device production.
Recently, several studies on edge-emitting lasers including InAlN LM bottom
claddings or optical blocking layers have been carried out (Castiglia et al., 2008;
Castiglia et al., 2009; Schenk et al., 2009; Castiglia et al., 2010; Charash
et al., 2011; Kim-Chauveau et al., 2012). Lasing has been demonstrated under
optical pumping (Schenk et al., 2009) and under electrical injection (Castiglia
et al., 2008; Castiglia et al., 2009; Castiglia et al., 2010; Charash et al., 2011; Kim-
Chauveau et al., 2012). Improved device optical characteristics can be achieved
by implementing InAlN bottom claddings LM to GaN. As mentioned previously,
Δnop/nop exceeds 6% for the LM InAlN/GaN system in the green wavelength
region, whereas this value is limited to less than 2% when using standard low
Al content AlGaN claddings. Furthermore, the use of a lattice-matched mater-
ial allows growing thick layers without introducing additional strain or defects
during the growth.
Potential drawbacks when using such material for optoelectronic applications
have to be taken into account. The wider energy bandgap, about 4.4–4.5 eV at
300 K for LM InAlN (Butt´e et al., 2007), compared to GaN, represents an en-
ergy barrier for eﬃcient carrier transport at heterointerfaces. Moreover, because
of the deep nature of the donors in such material, high dopant concentrations
are required to achieve an eﬃcient n-type doping. Nonetheless, InAlN optical
characteristics can lead to improved laser performances in terms of threshold
current density, slope eﬃciency, and beam shape quality.
Implementing InAlN claddings in GaN-based LDs requires an accurate op-
tical design of the LD structure. Since p-type doping has not been demonstrated
yet in LM InAlN, the use of this alloy in LD structures under electrical injec-
tion is limited to the fabrication of the bottom cladding, while keeping AlGaN

with a low Al content for the upper p-type cladding. On such structures, the
diﬀerences in the index contrast between the lower and the upper part of the LD
structure could lead to an asymmetric distribution of the optical mode inside
the waveguide.
The inﬂuence of the position of the bottom InAlN cladding with respect to
the waveguide has been investigated (Castiglia et al., 2009). Three LD struc-
tures grown on sapphire substrates are compared. The general LD structure
including an InAlN bottom cladding is shown in Fig. 6.16. Here t1 and t2 are
the n-AlGaN and the n-InAlN thicknesses, respectively. The reference structure
consists of a 500-nm thick n-doped Al0.07Ga0.93N layer (structure A; t1 = 500
nm, t2 = 0). The waveguide region consists of a 112-nm thick n-GaN layer, fol-
lowed by an In0.12Ga0.88N (3 nm)/GaN:Si (12 nm) MQW active region, a 20 nm
thick Al0.2Ga0.8N:Mg electron-blocking layer and an 80 nm thick p-GaN layer.
The LD structures are ﬁnally completed by growing a 125-period 2-nm/2-nm
Al0.15Ga0.85N/GaN p-cladding layer followed by a 10-nm thick p-GaN capping
layer for the electrical contact. The second structure is similar to structure A, but
it includes a 300-nm thick n-doped In0.17Al0.83N cladding ([Si] ∼3 × 1019 cm−3)
LM to GaN, which is placed below the n-doped AlGaN cladding layer (struc-
ture B; t1 = 500 nm, t2 = 300 nm). Finally, a structure with a 300-nm thick
In0.17Al0.83N n-cladding ([Si] ∼3 × 1019 cm−3) instead of the n-doped AlGaN
cladding has also been grown (structure C; t1 = 0, t2 = 300 nm).
Gain-guided LD structures with a cavity length of 800 μm and a stripe
width of 2 μm were fabricated. The devices were characterized under pulsed
current conditions, and lasing action at 415 nm was achieved on the three
diﬀerent structures. Threshold current densities of 39 kA/cm2, 30 kA/cm2, and
35 kA/cm2 and diﬀerential quantum eﬃciencies of 0.33, 0.43, and 0.24 W/A
were measured on 800 × 2 μm2 devices for structures A, B, and C, respectively.

Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
It must be pointed out that the high values found for the threshold current
density mainly originate from the weak lateral-mode conﬁnement due to the
lack of ridge structure. Devices including a hybrid In0.17Al0.83N/Al0.07Ga0.93N
cladding (structure B) show a threshold current 25% lower than standard
devices (structure A), whereas the improvement is limited to 10% for devices
having only a LM InAlN layer as bottom cladding (structure C). Structure B
also exhibits the highest slope eﬃciency.
AlGaN claddings with an Al content between 4% and 10% are commonly
adopted in standard violet LD structures. Here we ﬁxed such composition to
7% and evaluated the inﬂuence of the n-AlGaN cladding thickness t1 on the
conﬁnement factor and the transverse far-ﬁeld quality.
In order to account for the experimental results and to evaluate the impact
of the LM InAlN cladding on the mode conﬁnement factor, optical modeling of
LD structures on FS-GaN substrates is carried out. The ﬁeld distribution in the
transverse direction is calculated using the CAvity Model FRamework (CAMFR)
full-vectorial Maxwell solver.2 The refractive indices at 415 nm for AlGaN ternary
alloys were extracted from experimental data measured by Brunner et al. (1997),
while for LM InAlN the refractive index was taken from Carlin et al. (2005). The
125-period GaN/Al0.15Ga0.85N p-cladding is identiﬁed with an AlGaN cladding
having an average Al content of 7%. Due to the lack of reliable InGaN refractive
index data the QWs refractive index was assumed to be ∼2.6.
The optical conﬁnement factor Γact is deﬁned as the fraction of transverse
optical intensity overlapping with the active region:
Γact =

act E2
t (y)dy

structure E2
t (y)dy
(6.5)
where Et is the transverse vectorial electric ﬁeld. The mode conﬁnement per QW
(Γ1QW ) can then be deﬁned as the ratio between Γact and the number of QWs.
By extension, the mode overlap of each layer i can be deﬁned as the fraction of
optical intensity overlapping with a speciﬁc layer i. In this way the mode overlap
with the n-GaN substrate (Γn) and with the p-GaN (Γp) layer can be evaluated
in order to account for the mode leakage into the substrate and the optical losses
related to Mg doping.
The optical conﬁnement factor per QW Γ1QW , the substrate leakage Γn, and
the ﬁeld overlap with the p-type region Γp can be evaluated for the structure
shown in Fig. 6.16(a) as a function of the thicknesses t1 (n-AlGaN thickness)
and t2 (n-InAlN thickness). As expected the optical mode conﬁnement is im-
proved when increasing the AlGaN bottom cladding thickness. Moreover, the
mode conﬁnement dramatically increases when a thicker n-InAlN thickness is
used below the standard AlGaN cladding (Fig. 6.17(a)). From the modeling,
a bare n-InAlN cladding having a thickness of 300 nm should be enough to

maximize the Γ1QW value. Similarly, the implementation of a bottom InAlN
cladding leads to a substantial decrease in the mode leakage into the substrate
(Fig. 6.17(b)). As observed for the conﬁnement factor, the mode leakage sup-
pression is higher when the n-InAlN layer is placed closer to the waveguide due
to the increased refractive index contrast between the waveguide and the under-
lying cladding. At the same time, the optical mode is pushed toward the p-type
region when adding an InAlN cladding layer (Fig. 6.17(c)). The overlap with the
p-type region Γp increases with t2 and decreases when increasing the distance of
the InAlN layer from the waveguide.
The modeling also suggests that when an InAlN cladding layer LM to GaN is
placed directly below the n-type guide (structure C), the mode distribution inside
the waveguide becomes strongly asymmetric due to the higher index contrast on
the n-side compared to the p-side. As a consequence, the lasing mode is shifted
toward the p-type region that may lead to higher absorption in the p-type layers
(i.e., to increased internal losses). Thus, a hybrid InAlN/AlGaN cladding oﬀers
the best compromise, as it allows keeping a nearly symmetric LD waveguide
design while suppressing further optical leakage in the substrate.
Blue LD structures including a thin LM InAlN bottom optical blocking layer
(t1=900 nm; t2=100 nm) grown on c-plane freestanding GaN substrates have also
been reported and compared to standard structures (t1=1 μm; t2=0) (Charash
et al., 2011).
Index-guided LD structures with a cavity length of 600 μm and a ridge width
of 2 μm were fabricated. From the electrical point of view the structures, which
include a 100 nm thick InAlN layer, suﬀer from an increased operating voltage.
The J −V characteristics are shifted by 1-2 V to higher voltages when inserting
an InAlN optical blocking layer (OBL) below the LD structure (Fig. 6.18(a)). As
previously stated, LM InAlN has a wide energy bandgap compared to GaN. The
large conduction band oﬀset will aﬀect the electron ﬂow in the direction of the

p-n junction, which likely leads to an increased operating voltage in structures
with an InAlN OBL.
Lasing action is achieved at RT for both types of structures under cw elec-
trical injection (Fig. 6.18(b)). They show a comparable threshold current density
(around 4 kA/cm2) and diﬀerential eﬃciency (ηdiﬀ= 0.55 W/A per facet without
coating). The lack of improvement in the lasing properties of the InAlN OBL
LDs can be explained by the presence of a 1-μm thick n-Al0.07Ga0.93N cladding,
which is already adequate to provide the required optical mode conﬁnement
(Fig. 6.17(a)). In principle, the presence of the InAlN OBL should allow decreas-
ing the n-AlGaN thickness without compromising the optical mode conﬁnement.
Nonetheless, the InAlN OBL eﬃciently suppresses the parasitic mode leakage
into the substrate. Measurements of the far-ﬁeld emission patterns (Figs. 6.18(c)
and 6.18(d)) indicate that the structures possess the same vertical divergence
angle of 39◦. However, the standard devices exhibit intensity dips on the negative
part of the fast axis. This characteristic is a clear sign of parasitic mode leakage
into the GaN substrate. This undesired feature is completely suppressed in the
far-ﬁeld of the InAlN containing LD, so that mode leakage into the substrate is
strongly reduced.
To conclude this section, the InAlN alloy with an In content of 17–18% can
be successfully used as a bottom cladding layer in edge-emitting LDs without
degrading the device output performances. An improved beam shape is obtained
due to the reduced mode leakage into the FS-GaN substrate. The high Δnop/nop
value together with the LM condition represent a promising approach for the

at long wavelengths. Note, however, that additional research on n-type InAlN is
compulsory for achieving improved electrical characteristics.

InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
Since the ﬁrst realization of high-quality InAlN/GaN heterostructures, re-
search on InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) has rapidly
progressed, and these devices emerged as an attractive alternative to their
AlGaN/GaN counterparts. Indeed InAlN/GaN heterostructures oﬀer various
advantages both in terms of power-handling capability and operational fre-
quency, which is inherited from the LM condition of InAlN to GaN. To be more
quantitative the huge spontaneous polarization discontinuity at the InAlN/GaN
heterointerface gives rise to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with dens-
ity as high as 3 × 1013 cm−2 (Kuzmik, 2001). The conduction-band proﬁle of
a typical InAlN/GaN heterostructure and the corresponding electronic density
are shown in Fig. 6.19. For comparison, in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures the
important strain due to the lattice-mismatch between AlGaN and GaN lim-
its the Al content of the barrier to ∼30% and the 2DEG electron density to
∼1.5 × 1013 cm−2. The enhanced electron sheet density, combined with the high
electron mobility (>1200 cm2/V·s) provided by the insertion of an AlN spacer

Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
between GaN and InAlN and the high saturation velocity of GaN (3 × 107 cm/s),
allows InAlN/GaN HEMTs to reach current densities of >2 A/mm (Sun
et al., 2010c), which roughly constitutes an improvement by a factor of two
over AlGaN/GaN-based technologies. InAlN/GaN HEMTs therefore oﬀer the
opportunity of reaching power densities unattainable with other nitride-based
systems.
At the same time, due to the reduced surface-related depletion eﬀects in
InAlN/GaN heterostructures, high-density 2DEGs can be achieved with barriers
as thin as 10 nm or even less (Medjdoub et al., 2008; Gonschorek et al., 2008).
This allows keeping a high gate aspect ratio even in deeply scaled-down devices
without the need for performing a gate recess, thus avoiding excessive short
channel eﬀects in transistors with a sub-100-nm gate footprint. The scaling op-
portunities oﬀered by InAlN/GaN HEMTs, combined with the high saturation
electron velocity of GaN, open up the possibility of reaching cutoﬀfrequencies
well above 100 GHz, and therefore compete with the GaAs based technology.
Indeed, very high cutoﬀfrequencies in excess of 300 GHz have been obtained
(Yue et al., 2012), despite the relatively low maturity of the InAlN/GaN-based
technology, demonstrating the impressive potential of this platform. InAlN/GaN
HEMTs have also shown impressive temperature stability, with device operation
demonstrated up to 900◦C for 50 hours without failure (Maier et al., 2010).
Interestingly, the cause of failure at these extreme conditions has been identiﬁed
to be the contact metallization rather than the semiconducting material itself.
Indeed, operation at 1000◦C has been achieved recently due to the implementa-
tion of refractory metal-based contacts (Maier et al., 2012), which nicely shows
the extremely robust nature of InAlN/GaN heterostructures. Furthermore, the
high chemical stability of these heterostructures makes InAlN/GaN HEMTs the
ideal amplifying element for harsh environment sensing, especially if combined
with diamond as sensing material (Dipalo et al., 2009). Furthermore, the absence
of misﬁt strain in LM InAlN/GaN heterostructures is thought to be beneﬁcial for
the HEMT reliability. There are indeed evidences that in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
the accumulation of misﬁt strain and voltage-induced strain through the inverse
piezoelectric eﬀect can be responsible for device degradation and failure (Park
et al., 2009). InAlN/GaN HEMTs therefore combine several unique and exciting
properties that make them ideal candidates for high-power and high-frequency
applications. The state-of-the-art of the ﬁeld and the future research axis are
described in Section 6.7.1.

Growth of InAlN/GaN high electron mobility heterostructures

that the insertion of a 1-nm AlN spacer between the semi-insulating GaN buﬀer
and the InAlN barrier is necessary for achieving room-temperature mobilities of
>1000 cm2/V· s (Gonschorek et al., 2006), and that smooth heterointerfaces are

required in order to reduce interface roughness scattering, which after optical
phonon scattering is the main mechanism limiting the mobility at room temper-
ature (T¨ulek et al., 2009). Variation in the In content of the InAlN barrier changes
the spontaneous polarization mismatch with the GaN channel, and at the same
time the lattice mismatch introduces a piezoelectric component to the polariza-
tion. This aﬀects the 2DEG density, which is enhanced in heterostructures with
lower In content (Mikulics et al., 2010). However, lattice-mismatched heterostruc-
tures suﬀer from a lower stability (Gadanecz et al., 2007), and highly strained
layers may also present cracks (Liu et al., 2012). Therefore, care must be taken
to avoid excessive strain when growing lattice-mismatched heterostructures.
Most of the reports on InAlN/GaN heterostructures published up to now deal
with MOVPE-grown materials. Although sapphire has been the ﬁrst platform
for the development of high-quality InAlN/GaN heterostructures (Gonschorek
et al., 2006), reports of heterostructures with high electron mobility and low
sheet resistivity grown on SiC (Guo et al., 2010) and Si (Cheng et al., 2010) rap-
idly appeared. Indeed, high-resistivity buﬀer layers for these diﬀerent substrates
have been extensively optimized for AlGaN/GaN-based applications, and their
transfer to InAlN/GaN heterostructures was therefore relatively straightforward.
Low sheet resistivities, around 200 Ω/2, have been reported for all these sub-
strates. The frequency and power performances of MOVPE-grown HEMTs are
reviewed in Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3. More recently, the growth of InAlN/GaN
heterostructures by pulsed MOVPE (PMOVPE) has been reported, both on sap-
phire (Xue et al., 2011b) and SiC (Xue et al., 2011a). In PMOVPE ammonia
and the metalorganic precursors are supplied as a sequence of separate pulses,
which should promote the diﬀusion of the precursors on the growing surface and
therefore improve the InAlN quality. However, despite these potential advant-
ages, the mobility of PMOVPE and MOVPE-grown 2DEGs are up to now quite
similar.
Reports on metal-polar MBE-grown InAlN/GaN heterostructures are instead
much scarcer. While PAMBE has the serious drawback of producing InAlN
layers of poor uniformity and with lateral composition inhomogeneities (Choi
et al., 2012), uniform lattice-matched InAlN/GaN heterostructures with high
electron mobility (1600 cm2/V·s) and low sheet resistivity (244 Ω/2) have been
obtained recently with ammonia-MBE (Wong et al., 2012), which provides a
growth environment closer to the MOVPE one than PAMBE. The research on
MBE-grown InAlN/GaN HEMTs is, however, in its early stage, and works really
addressing the performances of MBE-grown HEMTs are still lacking.
N-polar heterostructures have also been recently explored. In such het-
erostructures the inversion of the polarization with respect to metal-polar
heterostructures requires the GaN channel to be grown on top of the InAlN
barrier. The 2DEG is therefore contacted from the GaN channel and not from
the InAlN barrier as in metal-polar HEMTs. This constitutes an interesting
strategy for the minimization of the contact resistance (Nidhi et al., 2010)
which, as described in Section 6.7.2, is a key requirement for the fabrication of

high-frequency devices. N-polar InAlN/GaN heterostructures have been obtained
both by MOVPE (Brown et al., 2010) and PAMBE (Dasgupta et al., 2011), but
this ﬁeld is still in its infancy, and reports on processed HEMTs are still limited.
However, N-polar InAlN/GaN HEMTs have already shown record transconduct-
ance of 1105 mS/mm (Nidhi et al., 2012) and are therefore highly promising for
high-frequency applications.
6.7.2
InAlN/GaN HEMTs for high-frequency applications
The frequency behavior of transistors is usually described by the current and
power gain cutoﬀfrequencies ft and fmax, i.e., the frequencies at which the
current or power gain become unitary, respectively. The gain cutoﬀfrequencies
of an HEMT depend on many parameters. While the intrinsic properties of the
semiconductor material deﬁne the ultimate performance attainable in an ideal
transistor, the experimental values of ft and fmax are always aﬀected by the
presence of parasitic elements that introduce delay times, feedback, and power
consumption. A careful device design and processing is therefore as important as
the quality of the epitaxial material if high-performance transistors are desired.
As a general rule, the current cutoﬀfrequency ft is proportional to the inverse
of the electron transit time under the gate, which gives the following dependence
on the gate length LG:
ft =
vt
2πLG
(6.6)
where vt is the electron transit velocity. This ideal equation is valid as long as
parasitic delay times and short channel eﬀects are not strong. Parasitic delay
times are mainly due to contact and access resistances, and are reduced by min-
imizing the Ohmic contact resistivity and by decreasing the drain-source and
gate-source separation. Ohmic contacts to the 2DEG are usually obtained by
deposition of a Ti/Al-based metal stack followed by rapid thermal annealing
(Zhou et al., 2010a). This allows for a contact resistivity of about 0.3 Ω·mm.
For lower contact resistivity, alternative solutions have to be adopted. Regrown
Ohmic contacts seem very promising in this sense. The regrown scheme con-
sists in the etching of the barrier and part of the buﬀer in the contact region,
followed by the regrowth, usually by MBE (Guo et al., 2011) of highly doped
n-GaN, which is eventually contacted with standard Ti/Al contacts. This has
allowed for a substantial reduction of the contact resistivity, down to 0.16 Ω·mm
(Yue et al., 2012), and the achievement of record ft of 370 GHz in 30-nm gate
devices.
On the other hand, short channel eﬀects become important when the gate
lateral dimension becomes comparable to the gate-channel separation. For
InAlN/GaN HEMTs, where the InAlN barrier can be made as thin as 10 nm
without suﬀering from surface-related depletion eﬀects, short channel eﬀects
become important only at gate lengths of 50 nm or less, which means that
sub-100-nm gates can be realized without the need for a gate recess. However,

211
strong short channel eﬀects have been observed with 30-nm long gates (Tirelli
et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011b). Therefore, the further scaling down of the gate lat-
eral dimension will require new strategies in order to thin down further the barrier
while keeping a high gate aspect ratio without inducing signiﬁcant surface-related
depletion eﬀects. Furthermore, the use of an AlGaN (Lee et al., 2011c) or InGaN
(Lee et al., 2011b) back barrier improves the 2DEG conﬁnement, which looks
quite promising for short-channel-eﬀect attenuation.
Concerning fmax, its maximization requires both a high ft and the reduc-
tion of the gate resistance and of the parasitic elements that introduce feedback
in the transistor, in particular the gate-drain capacitance. The use of T-shaped
gates (Fig. 6.20(a)) is therefore particularly important for the fabrication of
high-performance HEMTs, as it combines a short gate footprint with a wide
cross-section for gate resistance minimization. Rectangular gates (Fig. 6.20(b)),
although characterized by lower capacitances allowing for ft > 300 GHz, are gen-
erally quite resistive and do not permit high fmax. At present, the best fmax value
reported for an InAlN/GaN HEMT is 220 GHz (Tirelli et al., 2011), obtained in
a fully passivated device with a T-shaped gate and a 30-nm footprint.
The values of ft and fmax reported so far for sub-μm gate InAlN/GaN HEMTs
as a function of the gate length are summarized in Fig. 6.21, where it can be seen
that ft scales indeed as the reverse of the gate length, with an approximately
constant ft · LG product of ∼10 GHz·μm, independent of the substrate material
used. It has to be noted, however, that the fastest transistors have been obtained
on SiC. fmax values are instead more scattered and do not follow this simple
trend, which is mainly the consequence of the strong eﬀect of the gate resistance
on this parameter.

HEMTs as a function of the gate length LG. The data refer to HEMTs
grown on sapphire, Si, and SiC substrates. The values of ft show a good
scaling with the reverse of the gate length and are ﬁtted with a constant
ft · LG product of 10 GHz·μm. The larger scattering of the fmax values is
due to the dependence of fmax on other transistor parameters, in particular
the gate resistance. Data are taken from: 1. Medjdoub et al. (2007a), 2.

It is also worth noting that high-speed InAlN/GaN HEMTs are adapted for
low-noise operation. Minimum noise ﬁgures of 0.62 and 1.5 dB have been reported
at 10 and 20 GHz, respectively, for a device grown on SiC (Sun et al., 2010a),
showing the great potentials of the InAlN/GaN-based technology for low-noise
microwave applications.
6.7.3
Power performance of InAlN/GaN HEMTs
If sapphire has been the ﬁrst substrate material for InAlN/GaN HEMTs, its
poor thermal conductivity (42 W/m·K) seriously limits the thermal dissipation,
causing strong self-heating eﬀects and limited current densities (Gonschorek
et al., 2011). At present, reports on the power performances of InAlN/GaN
HEMTs on sapphire are rather scarce. In the early days of InAlN/GaN HEMTs,
www.ebook3000.com

InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors
213
an output power of 1.5 W/mm at 10 GHz with corresponding power added
eﬃciency (PAE) of 18% was reported (Gaqui`ere et al., 2007), while more re-
cently an output power of 2.9 W/mm at 18 GHz with a PAE of 28% has been
obtained (Lecourt et al., 2011b). For high-power devices, however, more eﬃcient
heat dissipation is required, and other substrate materials have been investig-
ated with the aim of improving thermal management aspects. SiC has been up
to now the most successful substrate material, as its high thermal conductiv-
ity (390 W/m·K) allows for very eﬃcient heat extraction. Indeed, InAlN/GaN
HEMTs grown on SiC have shown excellent power performances, with power
densities of 10 W/mm at 10 GHz (Sarazin et al., 2010), 5.8 W/mm at 35 GHz
(Crespo et al., 2010) and a PAE of about 50%. Despite the high performances
of InAlN/GaN HEMTs on SiC, the high cost of SiC wafers will probably limit
their application to ﬁelds where performances are the priority, such as highly
eﬃcient power ampliﬁers or the next generation of radars (Pengelly et al., 2012).
For widespread applications, cheaper substrate materials are needed. Si combines
high thermal conductivity (148 W/m·K) with low prices, and would be therefore
the best trade-oﬀbetween cost and power density. Up to now, the only report on
the power performance of InAlN/GaN HEMTs on Si concerns a device display-
ing a 2.5 W/mm maximum output power at 10 GHz (Sun et al., 2009), but it is
expected that the rapid progress made in the InAlN/GaN HEMT technology on
Si will lead to improved performances.
At present, the output power of InAlN/GaN HEMTs is limited by the re-
latively low breakdown voltage of these devices due to parasitic gate leakage
currents as high as several mA/mm (Sun et al., 2010b), mainly originating from
the gate electrode. Research eﬀorts are therefore under way in order to under-
stand the origin of these currents. In analogy with the work of Zhang et al. (2006)
for AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, Arslan et al. (2009) and Chikhaoui et al.
(2010) attributed the reverse bias current of Ni/Au Schottky contacts on
InAlN/GaN heterostructures to a Frenkel–Poole emission process from a trap
level located near the metal–semiconductor interface into a continuum of states
associated with threading dislocations and located 0.37 eV below the conduc-
tion band edge. The activation energy for the emission process was found to be
0.12–0.13 eV. However, the nature of this trap level has not been determined yet.
Furthermore, Frenkel–Poole emission is an eﬃcient process only if the emitting
trap level can be eﬃciently populated, i.e., if it lies close to the Fermi level of
the metal electrode. This constitutes a weak point, as a Schottky barrier height
of >1.47 eV has been reported for Ni/InAlN junctions (Donoval et al., 2011),
which is too high to be compatible with the proposed mechanism. The mechan-
ism behind gate leakage is therefore not completely clear at present, and further
investigations are needed in order to better understand the transport properties
of InAlN Schottky contacts.
A very eﬀective way of reducing gate leakage currents is the insertion of
an insulating dielectric layer between the heterostructure and the gate metal.
Several oxides have been investigated, such as HfO2 (Abermann et al., 2009),

214
Properties of InAlN layers nearly lattice-matched to GaN
ZrO2 (Abermann et al., 2007; Abermann et al., 2009; Kuzmik et al., 2008),
Al2O3 (Pozzovivo et al., 2007), and GdScO3 (ˇCiˇco et al., 2011), deposited both
by MOVPE or atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Abermann et al., 2009). A sig-
niﬁcant reduction in the gate leakage current, ranging from three to six orders
of magnitude depending on the InAlN surface preparation method, has been re-
ported for all the materials (Abermann et al., 2007; Pozzovivo et al., 2007; ˇCiˇco
et al., 2011). Moreover, the ft · LG product was not degraded in HEMTs with
gate insulation (Medjdoub et al., 2007b), and pulsed measurements revealed
that the passivation of the InAlN surface eﬀectively reduces the current col-
lapse observed in Schottky barrier HEMTs (Kuzmik et al., 2008). Interestingly,
passivation with Al2O3 induces a signiﬁcant reduction in the sheet resistivity
(Chung et al., 2009), probably due to an oxide-induced shift of the InAlN sur-
face potential, which makes Al2O3 an attractive passivation dielectric even for
Schottky barrier HEMTs, where the gate metal is not isolated from the InAlN
surface (Chung et al., 2009). Insulation with Al2O3 can also be achieved through
the thermal oxidation of the InAlN barrier at elevated temperature (∼800◦C)
in an O2-rich atmosphere. This diﬀusion-limited oxidation process (Alomari
et al., 2010) allows for the growth of a few nm thick Al2O3 passivation layer
that eﬀectively reduces the gate leakage currents. The interface trap density of
the thermally grown oxide was measured to be 2.5 × 1012 cm−2 (Eickelkamp
et al., 2011), which corresponds to the values reported for MOVPE and ALD-
grown Al2O3. From current–voltage measurements, a barrier height of 2.30–2.38
eV was evaluated, which compares well to the value of 2.57 eV obtained from
photocurrent measurements (Kov´aˇc et al., 2011). An interesting aspect of the
thermal oxidation of InAlN is the possibility of performing it on selected regions
deﬁned lithographically. This has allowed for a self-aligned process where the
InAlN surface is oxidized just in the gate region, allowing for the passivation of
the access and output regions of the HEMT with other materials such as Si3N4
(Alomari et al., 2009).
6.7.4
Enhancement-mode InAlN/GaN HEMTs
The devices presented so far are depletion-mode (D-mode), or normally-on
HEMTs, i.e., the threshold gate-source voltage (Vth) below which the 2DEG is
completely depleted and the transistor is pinched oﬀis negative. However, pos-
itive Vth values would be of high interest, especially for power applications, as
this would allow for failsafe operation and reduced circuit complexity. Research
eﬀorts have therefore been devoted to the realization of enhancement-mode (E-
mode), or normally-oﬀ, InAlN/GaN HEMTs. In a ﬁrst attempt, a high-In-content
InAlN/GaN heterostructure was proposed with the aim of engineering the polar-
ization charge at the heterointerface and the 2DEG density (Choi et al., 2010).
This resulted in a device with a threshold voltage of +0.2 V, but the high resistiv-
ity of the 2DEG in the access and output regions was responsible for a very low
current density and an elevated on-resistance. If this was the ﬁrst demonstration

of a normally-oﬀInAlN/GaN HEMT, it pointed out at the same time the need
for solutions able to produce devices with low access and output resistance.
Figure 6.22 illustrates two device concepts, both based on a selective gate
recess, that have produced high-performance normally-oﬀInAlN/GaN HEMTs.
The ﬁrst approach (Fig. 6.22(a)) is based on an InAlN/GaN heterostructure with
an ultrathin 1-nm thick nearly LM InAlN barrier, well below the critical thick-
ness for 2DEG formation (Ostermaier et al., 2009). The heterostructure is capped
with a heavily doped (1020 cm−3) 6-nm thick n+ GaN layer, which provides carri-
ers for the 2DEG formation and at the same time saturates the surface trap levels
(Kuzmik et al., 2010), preventing the high-frequency current collapse. A selective
ﬂuorine-based plasma etching of the GaN capping layer (Ostermaier et al., 2010a)
allows placing the gate electrode on the InAlN barrier, thus selectively depleting
the 2DEG in the gate region. A positive threshold voltage of +0.7 V is therefore
obtained while at the same time keeping low the access and output resistance.
Furthermore, a high ft · LG product of 16.8 GHz·μm was reported, showing the
high potential of E-mode InAlN/GaN HEMTs for high-frequency applications.
Later technological optimizations produced a device with a very high transcon-
ductance of 640 mS/mm (Ostermaier et al., 2010b), while the introduction of
a ZrO2 insulating layer between the gate metal and the InAlN barrier allowed
engineering the threshold voltage up to +2.3 V (Alexewicz et al., 2012).
A second possible approach is presented in Fig. 6.22(b). Here a more stand-
ard InAlN/GaN heterostructure is adopted with a thickness above the critical
one for the 2DEG formation. This gives a low sheet resistivity and consequently
keeps low the access and output resistance, while the normally-oﬀoperation is

obtained by selectively etching the InAlN barrier down to the AlN spacer layer in
the gate region (Wang et al., 2010). The implementation of this approach on SiC
demonstrated the feasibility of E-mode InAlN/GaN HEMTs with high saturated
current density (1.9 A/mm) and transconductance as high as 800 mS/mm. Very
low leakage levels and ON/OFF current ratios as high as 1012 have been sub-
sequently achieved by means of a postprocessing annealing at 400◦C for interface
defect reduction (Wang et al., 2011b), while relatively high (>1.5 V) threshold
voltages have been obtained through the insertion of an insulating layer below
the gate (Morgan et al., 2011).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the main growth parameters aﬀecting the quality of InAlN layers
nearly LM to GaN grown by MOVPE, including impurity incorporation, have
been ﬁrst reported with an emphasis on the critical role of the growth tem-
perature as well as those of the precursor ﬂux and the carrier gas ﬂow on the
indium incorporation and the layer growth rate. The nature of the main struc-
tural defects and their evolution with increasing layer thickness has also been
addressed.
Regarding optical properties, it was pointed out that even if a composition-
dependent band-gap bowing parameter can better account for the evolution of
the unstrained band-gap over the whole indium composition range, a b value of
∼5.4 eV will reasonably reproduce experimental values. Following recent theor-
etical work, it was suggested that the large reported Stokes shift for the InAlN
might probably be inherent to the various atomic conﬁgurations for indium atoms
within the wurtzite phase, leading to regions with strongly varying band-edge
energy and thus to a strong diﬀerence in absorption and in emission spectra.
XPS measurements and theoretical studies also indicate a type I GaN/InAlN
heterointerface characterized with a small VBO amounting to ∼0.2 eV. PL
measurements performed on GaN/InAlN QWs show that such a system could
constitute a promising active region for near-UV emitters compared with their
GaN/AlGaN counterparts. The larger IQE at RT of the former compared with
the latter could be due to an enhanced localization energy and band oﬀsets
minimizing thermalization escape phenomena.
Switching to optoelectronic applications, the potential of crack-free highly
reﬂective InAlN/GaN DBRs grown on FS-GaN substrates was illustrated via
the achievement of electrically driven VCSELs and optically pumped VECSELs.
It was pointed out that the quality of the substrate and its surface preparation
are probably playing a major role on the in-plane photonic disorder. It was also
demonstrated that the InAlN alloy can be successfully used as a bottom cladding
layer in edge-emitting LDs while preserving the device output performances.
Thanks to the large refractive index contrast of InAlN with GaN, a reduced
mode leakage and an improved far-ﬁeld pattern over AlGaN-based claddings are
reported.

Finally, the present status of InAlN/GaN HEMTs has been summarized.
It has been recalled that such structures oﬀer very promising possibilities for
high-power and high-frequency applications up to very high temperatures (ex-
ceeding several hundreds of degrees Celsius) with a predicted high reliability
owing to the absence of misﬁt strain. High current cutoﬀfrequency operation is
inherited from the large electron transit velocity and the possibility of achieving
short gate length while using a design avoiding short channel eﬀects. When grown
on SiC substrates, power densities of several W/mm (e.g., 10 W/mm at 10 GHz)
and a PAE of 50% have been reported for InAlN/GaN HEMTs. For devices grown
on Si the ﬁgures of merit are lower, but fast progress is expected in this rapidly
evolving ﬁeld. It was also highlighted that such HEMTs oﬀer promising per-
spectives for the realization of E-mode, or normally-oﬀ, devices that would allow
for failsafe operation and reduced circuit complexity. All the above-mentioned
aspects fully reveal the tremendous potential of the InAlN alloy both for opto-
electronic and microelectronic applications. Provided a continuous improvement
of the InAlN layers is indeed sustained, it is probable that such a material system
will play a crucial role in forthcoming commercial III-nitride-based devices.

Growth and optical properties
of aluminum-rich AlGaN heterostructures
Hideto Miyake
7.1
Introduction
AlxGa1-xN alloys have attracted signiﬁcant attention owing to their emission
covering the wavelength range from 210 to 365 nm upon changing the AlN mole
fraction x. This characteristic has been actively applied to the development of
deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [1, 2]. However, the emission eﬃ-
ciency of LEDs with wavelengths of less than 280 nm is rather low, partly due to
the high resistivity of p-AlGaN and the low quality of the AlGaN template. Many
methods have been proposed for improving the crystal quality of AlGaN, such as
growth on GaN substrates and the use of low-temperature buﬀer layer technology
[3–5]. However, cracks are generated in AlGaN using these methods in the case
of a high AlN mole fraction owing to the large diﬀerence in the lattice constants
and the thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate and growth layer.
Moreover, the crystal quality is generally low because of the high dislocation
density [6–8]. Other groups have recently obtained crack-free AlGaN layers with
high crystal quality for all AlN mole fractions using an AlN/sapphire substrate
[9–17]. However, they did not discuss the growth mechanism of AlGaN on AlN.
Moreover, the successful doping of AlxGa1-xN is a great major requirement for
the development of high-eﬃciency devices, and many groups have studied the
doping of AlxGa1-xN [18, 19].
In this chapter, the growth of Si-doped AlGaN and AlGaN/AlGaN multiple-
quantum wells on an AlN/sapphire substrate by low-pressure metalorganic vapor
phase epitaxy (LP-MOVPE) with an in situ monitoring system have been re-
ported. The quality and growth mechanism of AlGaN on AlN was discussed.
GaN and AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of 0.28 were free from stress be-
cause of the occurrence of three-dimensional (3D) growth. The lattice constant
a of AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of 0.4 was larger than that at an AlN
mole fraction of 0.28 despite the two-dimensional (2D) growth mode. AlGaN
with an AlN mole fraction of more than 0.6 was coherently grown on AlN owing
to the fact that the AlN/sapphire template used in this work was subjected to
compression. For this reason, in the samples with an AlN mole fraction of more
than 0.6, the crystal quality was high because of the coherent growth on the
underlying AlN.

Growth of Si-doped AlGaN on AlN/sapphire templates
A 0.8–1.0-μm thick epitaxial AlN layer on sapphire (0001) was used as a substrate
to grow AlxGa1-xN. As a measure of the crystallinity of this AlN substrate, the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray rocking curve (XRC) was
50–100 arcsec for (0002) diﬀraction and 400–550 arcsec for (10–12) diﬀraction.
The AlGaN ﬁlm was grown by LP-MOVPE on an AlN/sapphire template with
an in situ monitoring system. Trimethylgallium (TMG), trimethylaluminum
(TMA), and ammonia (NH3) were used as precursors for Ga, Al, and N, respect-
ively. H2 was used as the carrier gas and CH3SiH3 was used as the doping source.
The reactor pressure was ﬁxed at 50 Torr. The AlN mole fraction in AlGaN
was controlled by varying the growth temperature, and two high-Al-composition
layers were inserted at the ﬁrst stage of growth as a buﬀer layer.
The crystal quality and AlN mole fraction were determined from the lattice
constant measured by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD). XRD analysis was conducted in
accordance with Hooke’s law for a wurtzite structure,
εzz = −2C13
C33
εxx
(7.1)
where εzz and εxx are the strains in the c-axis and a-axis directions, respectively,
in the c-plane, and Cij are the elastic stiﬀness constants. The Al mole fraction x
was determined by comparing the a-axis and c-axis lattice constants evaluated
by XRD with those obtained from Vegard’s law assuming eq. (7.1). The carrier
concentration and mobility were determined by Hall eﬀect measurements.
Figure 7.1 shows the growth rate and AlN mole fraction in AlGaN under dif-
ferent TMG ﬂow rates. The growth rates of AlN and GaN were calculated from

the growth rate of AlGaN and its mole fraction using the lattice constants of AlN
and GaN. The growth rate of AlN was constant. In contrast, the growth rates of
GaN and AlGaN increased with increasing TMG ﬂow rate. In addition, Fig. 7.2
shows the growth rate and AlN mole fraction in AlGaN at diﬀerent growth tem-
peratures. Similarly to when AlGaN was grown under diﬀerent TMG ﬂow rates,
the growth rate of AlN was constant, regardless of the growth temperature. In
contrast, the growth rates of GaN and AlGaN increased with decreasing growth
temperature, which is considered to be due to the suppression of Ga desorp-
tion at lower growth temperatures. The AlN mole fraction in AlGaN increased
linearly with increasing growth temperature. Thus, it is possible to control the
growth rate and the AlN molar fraction by controlling the growth temperature.
AlGaN ﬁlms with AlN mole fractions varying from 0.05 to 0.91 were obtained
by increasing the growth temperature from 1100 to 1200◦C. Smooth and crack-
free AlGaN ﬁlms were obtained with AlN mole fractions of 0.51 and above, and
atomic steps were observed for those surfaces by atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Figure 7.3 shows the dependence of the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the X-ray rocking curve (XRC) peak on the AlN mole fraction. The crystal
quality deteriorates as the AlN mole fraction decreases to approximately 0.4, and
then improves as the AlN mole fraction decreases further. It is considered that
this is due to a diﬀerent growth mechanism occurring below an AlN mole fraction
of 0.4, and that the misﬁt dislocation increases because of the lattice constant
diﬀerence between AlxGa1-xN and AlN as the AlN mole fraction decreases to
approximately 0.40, which leads to the deterioration of crystal quality. Figure 7.4
shows in situ reﬂectance intensity spectra for GaN and AlGaN grown with AlN
mole fractions of 0.28, 0.40, and 0.58 on an AlN/sapphire substrate. The crystal
quality improves as the AlN mole fraction decreases to below 0.4 because of the

ference in the lattice constant between the growth layer and the substrate. The
subsequent horizontal growth causes the bending of the propagation direction
of the edge dislocations, which is thought to lead to improved crystal quality. At
an AlN mole fraction of 0.4 and above, the growth mode changed to the layer-
by-layer mode (2D growth mode). Because the diﬀerence in the lattice constants

between the AlGaN layer and the AlN underlying layer decreases with increasing
AlN mole fraction, the density of misﬁt dislocations was reduced; thus, the
FWHM value decreased as the AlN mole fraction was increased from 0.4 to 0.6.
Figure 7.5 shows the relationship between the lattice constants a and c for
AlxGa1-xN on the AlN/sapphire templates with various AlN mole fractions. The

which can be derived from eq. (7.1), implying that the lattice constant c changes
with the slope of –(2C13 /C33) × (c0 /a0) with respect to the lattice constant a
[20, 21]. From Fig. 7.6, GaN and AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of 0.28 are free
from stress because of the 3D growth (Fig. 7.4). The value of a for AlGaN with
an AlN mole fraction of 0.4 is larger than that for an AlN mole fraction of 0.28,
despite the occurrence of 2D growth (Fig. 7.4). This indicates that the lattice
mismatch between the AlGaN and underlying AlN has an adverse eﬀect on the
crystal quality through a change in the growth mechanism to 2D growth when x
is nearly 0.4. On the other hand, AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of more than
0.6 is coherently grown on AlN owing to the fact that the AlN/sapphire template
used in this work is subjected to compression and has excellent crystal quality.

by SIMS.
For this reason, in the samples with an AlN mole fraction of more than 0.6, the
crystal quality is high because of the coherent growth on the underlying AlN.
Figure 7.6 shows the carrier concentration and mobility of Si-doped AlGaN as
a function of Si concentrations. The Si concentration was evaluated by secondary
ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Here, the AlN mole fraction is ﬁxed at approxim-
ately 0.65. The carrier concentration increases linearly with the Si concentration
up to an Si concentration of 2 × 1018 cm–3, indicating that the activation rate is
approximately 1, while that for a Si concentration of 4 × 1018 cm–3 is lower owing
to self-compensation. On the other hand, the mobility decreased monotonically
with increasing Si concentration.
7.3
Growth of Si-doped AlGaN/AlGaN multiple-quantum wells
Currently, research on AlxGa1-xN-based UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is
popular. However, their external quantum eﬃciency is low because the growth
of p-type AlxGa1-xN with a high AlN mole fraction and a low resistivity is dif-
ﬁcult, and thereby the hole injection eﬃciency is low. Previously, we studied the
application of Si-doped AlxGa1-xN single-layer thin ﬁlms grown on epitaxial AlN
substrates to electron-beam-excited UV light sources [22, 23]. Here, we fabric-
ated multiple quantum well (MQW) structures using Si-doped AlGaN/AlGaN
supperlattices and evaluated their light emission characteristics in an attempt to
realize deep-UV light emission with a higher output and eﬃciency.
Figure 7.7 shows the layer structure of AlGaN MQWs on an AlN/sapphire
template. Two high-AlN-mole-fraction AlGaN layers with a thickness of 0.1 μm
each and an Si-doped AlGaN layer with a thickness of 0.2 μm as buﬀer layers were

grown before the growth of AlGaN MQWs. It is necessary to examine the thick-
ness of well layers to obtain a good carrier conﬁnement eﬀect in quantum well
structures. Here, we examined samples with diﬀerent thicknesses of well layers:
the thickness of the well layers was 0.7–2.2 nm with a constant barrier thickness
of 7 nm and a total MQW thickness of 600 nm controlled by varying the number
of MQW pairs. The AlN mole fractions of the well layers (Si-doped AlyGa1-yN
layers) and the barrier layers (Si-doped AlxGa1-xN layers) were y = 0.69 ± 0.01
and x = 0.81 ± 0.01, respectively. The ﬂow rate of CH3SiH3 was 0.45 nmol/min.

conﬁrming that the AlGaN MQW structure was almost coherently grown on
the AlN substrate. As shown in Fig. 7.9, cross-sectional transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) revealed an abrupt interface of the MQWs as well as the
ﬁlm uniformity of the well and barrier layers. The dislocation density calcu-
lated from the XRC FWHM was approximately 108 cm–2 for all the samples.
Figure 7.10 shows the results of cathodoluminescence (CL) evaluation. The accel-
eration voltage of the electron beam was 5 kV. A deep-UV CL peak was observed
at a wavelength of approximately 250–260 nm for all samples, and the strongest
peak was observed for the sample with a well layer thickness of 1.5 nm. This is
considered to be because the carriers generated in the barrier layers were con-
ﬁned in the well layers to enable eﬃcient radiative recombination. The decrease
in peak intensity below a well thickness of approximately 1.5 nm might have
been caused by the sharpness of the boundary between the well and the barrier,
because the lattice constant along the AlGaN c-axis was about 0.5 nm, mak-
ing it diﬃcult to fabricate a well with a thickness of less than 1 nm. Moreover,
the decrease in peak intensity above a well thickness of approximately 1.5 nm
is thought to be due to the increase in the degree of wavefunction separation
caused by the internal ﬁeld in the quantum well. The reduction of overlap re-
duces the probability of recombination between electrons and holes. Thus, we
conﬁrmed that the optimum well thickness is approximately 1.5 nm. Moreover,

it is considered that light polarized as E ⊥c was obtained even for the high-
AlN-mole-fraction AlyGa1-yN because of the signiﬁcant quantum eﬀect on the
valence band structure, and strong radiation was obtained from the (0001) plane
[24]. In general, however, light polarized as E ||c is dominant for AlxGa1-xN thin
ﬁlms coherently grown on AlN substrates when x > 0.6, resulting in diﬃculty
in obtaining the radiation from the (0001) plane for wavelengths shorter than
approximately 250 nm.
In order to optimize the thickness of barrier layers, we evaluated samples
with barrier thicknesses of 3–15 nm with the optimized well thickness of 1.5 nm
and a total MQW thickness of 600 nm controlled by varying the number of
MQW pairs. The AlN mole fractions of the well layers (Si-doped AlyGa1-yN
layers) and the barrier layers (Si-doped AlxGa1-xN layers) were y = 0.59 ± 0.01
and x = 0.70 ± 0.02, respectively. The ﬂow rate of CH3SiH3 was 0.45 nmol/min.
The peak wavelengths for all the samples were in the range of 250–260 nm,
as shown in Fig. 7.11. Similarly to the optimization of well thickness, we fo-
cused on the peak intensity of the CL spectra. The highest peak intensity
was observed at a barrier thickness of 7 nm. The decrease in peak intensity
below a barrier thickness of 7 nm is thought to have been caused by the de-
crease in the number of carriers trapped in the wells. Moreover, the decrease
in peak intensity above a barrier thickness of 7 nm was probably caused by
the increase in the number of carriers trapped by non-radiative recombination

MQWs (–1–124) for the samples with well and barrier thicknesses of 1.5 and
7 nm, respectively. Clear reciprocal lattice points corresponding to each layer
were observed, indicating that the two high-AlN-mole-fraction AlGaN layers
and the Si-doped AlGaN layer, which were inserted as buﬀer layers, were al-
most coherently grown on the AlN substrate. Moderate lattice relaxation was
observed for the MQWs, meaning that the MQW structure contributed to stress
relaxation.
It is essential to examine the thickness of emission layers in electron beam ex-
citation. Here, we fabricated three MQW samples with diﬀerent total thicknesses.
The thicknesses of the well and barrier layers were ﬁxed at 1.5 and 7 nm, respect-
ively. The number of periods of the MQW structure was set to 50, 75, or 100 to
obtain MQW structures with total thicknesses of 425, 637, or 850 nm, respect-
ively. Figure 7.14 shows the change in CL peak intensity with acceleration voltage
for the AlGaN MQWs with diﬀerent total thicknesses of the MQW structure.
For all the samples, the CL peak intensity increased with increasing accelera-
tion voltage of the electron beam and then saturated. The acceleration voltage
at which the CL peak intensity started to saturate decreased with decreasing
total thickness of the MQW structure: the CL peak intensity for the sample
with ﬁfty periods (approximately 0.4 μm) was about half that for the sample
with 100 periods (approximately 0.8 μm) at 10 kV. This was because the penet-
ration depth of the electron beam was increased by increasing the acceleration
voltage and the electron beam transmitted through the MQW structure with
a smaller total thickness. Therefore, the thickness of the emission layers should
be set considering the penetration depth of the electron beam in electron-beam-
excited light emission. In this study, a high-emission output was obtained using

The doping of impurities into quantum wells has been proposed as a means of
improving electric and optical characteristics. Modulation doping into quantum
wells has also been proposed as a technique applicable to high-output laser di-
odes (LDs), LEDs, and high-electron-mobility transistors. These methods use
the change of the band structure caused by impurity doping, and impurities are
generally doped into barrier layers. Nevertheless, the eﬀect of impurity doping
on electron beam excitation has not yet been clariﬁed.
Here, we fabricated four samples and compared their characteristics to ex-
amine the eﬀect of doping Si into quantum wells on electron beam excitation:
(1) no Si was doped, (2) Si was doped only into the barrier layers, (3) Si was
doped only into the well layers, and (4) Si was doped into both the well and
barrier layers. For all four samples, the thicknesses of the well and barrier layers
were 1.5 and 7 nm, respectively, the number of periods was 75, and the total
thickness of the MQW structure was 637 nm. The AlN mole fractions of the well
layers (Si-doped AlyGa1-yN layers) and the barrier layers (Si-doped AlxGa1-xN
layers) were y = 0.59 ± 0.01 and x = 0.73 ± 0.01, respectively. The ﬂow rate of
CH3SiH3 was 0.45 nmol/min during the fabrication of the Si-doped samples.
Figure 7.15 shows the results of CL evaluation for the four samples. The ac-
celeration voltage of the electron beam was 5 kV and the irradiation current was
3 × 10–10 A. A deep-UV CL peak was observed at a wavelength of approxim-
ately 255 nm for all four samples. The CL intensities for the sample with the
Si-doped well layers and the sample with the Si-doped well and barrier layers
were much higher than those for the undoped sample and the sample with the

Si-doped barrier layers. This may be because the defect concentration in the well
layers, where carriers were concentrated, was decreased by doping Si, resulting
in eﬃcient radiative recombination.
Finally, the doping of Si into well layers was examined for diﬀerent CH3SiH3
ﬂow rates. For the samples used in this examination, Si was doped only into the
well layers at a CH3SiH3 ﬂow rate of 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 sccm. Figure 7.16 shows the
results of CL evaluation for the above samples. It was found that there was a peak
of the CL intensity for the diﬀerent amounts of doped Si. In this examination,
the highest CL intensity was observed at a CH3SiH3 ﬂow rate of 0.45 nmol/min.
This marked diﬀerence in CL intensity for the diﬀerent amounts of doped Si is
considered to support the eﬀectiveness of Si doping into the well layers of MQW
structures.

Fabrication of AlGaN MQWs for electron-beam target
for deep-ultraviolet light sources
In an attempt to satisfy the technical requirements of deep-UV LEDs, we focus
on a UV light source using AlGaN as a target for electron-beam (EB) pump-
ing, because the target does not require p-type AlGaN. Such UV light sources
with a simple structure are also suitable for use as large-scale light sources.
Furthermore, the emission wavelength can be designed without using a ﬁlter by
changing the AlN mole fraction in the AlGaN. Recently, Watanabe et al. have
fabricated a device using BN powder with an emission wavelength of 225 nm, a
maximum output power of 1 mW, and a power eﬃciency of 0.6% [25]. However,
it was diﬃcult to control the emission wavelength. Oto et al. obtained 240-nm
emission with an output power of 100 mW by EB pumping using 128-nm-thick
AlxGa1-xN/AlN quantum wells, and a power eﬃciency of 40% was achieved with
no metal back layer on the EB input surface [26], though a detailed investig-
ation of the characteristics has not been reported yet. In this study we have
grown Si-doped AlGaN MQWs on AlN/sapphire templates by LP-MOVPE, and
investigated their characteristics in detail for the purpose of developing AlGaN
MQW targets for EB-pumped deep-UV light sources for industrial applications.
With the optimized well and barrier thicknesses, we next evaluated the deep-
UV light output power. Figure 7.17 shows the deep-UV light output power and
conversion eﬃciency of an AlGaN MQW target, with optimized well and barrier
thicknesses, pumped by a 10-kV, 5-mm-diameter EB. The AlGaN MQW with
an Al metal back layer (thickness 20 nm) was pumped by the EB, and the deep-
UV light emitted from the target that passed through the sapphire substrate to
the outside was measured using a calibrated silicon photodetector. The spectral
sensitivity of the detector was checked before and after the evaluation, and it
was conﬁrmed that there was no change in sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 7.16,
the deep-UV light output power gradually increases with EB input power. The
AlGaN MQW target exhibits a deep-UV light output power of more than 15 mW
at a wavelength of 256 nm, and the estimated conversion eﬃciency is more than

optimization described previously, the peak intensity of the optimized structure
was about ten times higher than that of an AlGaN single-layer structure [23].
However, in the deep-UV light output power evaluation here, the light output
power of the optimized structure for an EB input power of 1.0 W was only about
ﬁve times higher than that of an AlGaN single-layer structure. It seems to be
caused by the fact that the target temperature depends on EB input power, and
light extraction eﬃciency depends on the buﬀer layer structure.

Conclusions
The growth of Si-doped AlGaN on an AlN/sapphire substrate as an underly-
ing layer was performed using LP-MOVPE. The AlGaN ﬁlms were grown with
diﬀerent AlN mole fractions by changing the growth temperature. GaN and
AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of 0.28 were free from stress because of the
3D growth. In the case of AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of nearly 0.4, the
lattice mismatch between the AlGaN and underlying AlN had an adverse eﬀect
on the crystal quality. AlGaN with an AlN mole fraction of more than 0.6 was
coherently grown on AlN, and in the samples with an AlN mole fraction of more
than 0.6 the crystal quality was high because of the coherent growth on the
underlying AlN. Moreover, AlGaN was subjected to Si doping. The carrier con-
centration increased linearly with the Si concentration up to a Si concentration
of 2 × 1018 cm–3, indicating that the activation rate was approximately 1.
The structure of Si-doped AlGaN MQW targets was optimized for application
to EB-pumped deep-UV light sources by the CL analysis. It was found that the
optimum well and barrier layer thicknesses were 1.5 and 7 nm, respectively. We

evaluated the deep-UV light emission from Si-doped AlGaN MQW targets that
were pumped by a 10-kV, 5-mm-diameter EB. A deep-UV light output power of
more than 15 mW with a conversion eﬃciency of more than 0.75% was achieved
at a wavelength of 256 nm and an EB input power of 2.0 W. These results
indicate the potential of using a p-type-AlGaN-free simple structure for AlGaN
MQW targets for application to EB-pumped deep-UV light sources.

Optical and structural properties
of InGaN light-emitters on non-polar
and semipolar GaN
Michael Kneissl and Tim Wernicke
Today group III-nitride-based visible-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibiting re-
cord external quantum eﬃciencies and InGaN quantum well laser diodes in the
near-UV to the green spectral range have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, a
large number of technological problems and scientiﬁc questions remain. One of
the most critical issues for InGaN-based LEDs and laser diodes is the presence of
large polarization ﬁelds along the (0001) direction. These can be signiﬁcantly re-
duced or completely eliminated by growing on non- and semipolar GaN surfaces.
Controlling the polarization ﬁelds in III-nitride heterostructures is particularly
critical for light emitters in the blue and green spectral regions. Triggered by
the ﬁrst demonstration non-polar GaN quantum wells grown on LiAlO2 by
Waltereit and colleagues in 2000 (Waltereit et al., 2000), impressive advances
in the area of non-polar and semipolar nitride semiconductors and devices have
been achieved. Today, a large variety of group III-nitride heterostructures free
of polarization ﬁelds exhibit exceptional performance and the fundamental un-
derstanding of polar, semipolar, non-polar nitrides has made signiﬁcant leaps
forward. In the following chapter we will review the diﬀerent approaches for het-
eroepitaxial growth of non- and semipolar GaN ﬁlms on sapphire, SiC, silicon,
and LiAlO2 substrates, and discuss challenges related to surface morphologies,
structural defects, and optical properties. Diﬀerent strategies for defect reduc-
tion for heteroepitaxially grown GaN layers will also be discussed. In addition,
the structural and optical properties of InGaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on
m-plane and diﬀerent semipolar surfaces, i.e., (10¯12), (10¯11), (20¯21), (11¯22), as
well as c-plane GaN substrates, will be reviewed. The dependence of the indium
incorporation eﬃciency on the growth surface orientations as well as the emission
properties, in particular the polarization of the light emission, for InGaN QWs
grown on semi- and non-polar surfaces will be discussed. We will also present

Spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization

8.1
Spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization in InGaN/GaN
quantum wells on c-plane, semipolar, and non-polar crystal
orientations
The initial driving force for the development of non-polar and semipolar ni-
trides was and still is the reduction of polarization ﬁelds in conventional (0001)
c-plane InGaN/GaN QWs, which lead to long radiative recombination times
and poor internal quantum eﬃciencies (IQE) due to the quantum-conﬁned Stark
eﬀect (QCSE) (Miller et al., 1984; Takeuchi et al., 1997; Berkowicz et al., 2000).
The origin of the spontaneous polarization is the lack of inversion symmetry in
wurtzite crystal structures, the polar nature of the Ga-N bond (represented by
diﬀerent electro-negativity values), and the unequal bonding lengths between Ga
and N along c- and a-directions (Piprek, 2007). Therefore, in InGaN/GaN hetero-
structures interface charges are generated due to the non-vanishing spontaneous
and piezoelectric polarization. For InGaN QWs grown on GaN, piezoelectric
ﬁelds are generated by the compressive strain that the InGaN layer experiences.
As the covalent bonds within the c-plane are compressed, the bond length along
the c-direction increases (Piprek, 2007). This leads to a further deviation of the
c/a ratio which in turn leads to a stronger polarization, denoted as piezoelectric
polarization. Due to the symmetry of the wurtzite unit cell, the ﬁeld is always
oriented along the [0001] c-axis. Considering a slab of III-N bulk crystal, the
dielectric displacement is constant within and outside the crystal. As a result, an
electric ﬁeld and its associated sheet charges at the crystal surface are generated.
In the picture of band-structure diagrams, the electric ﬁeld causes a tilt of the
conduction and valence bands. However, if the bands cross the Fermi level, free
carriers are generated and the ﬁelds are screened. Typically, surface sheet charges
are screened at a distance of ∼40 nm in GaN (Netzel et al., 2009). Considering
a quantum well within bulk GaN (or another III-nitride alloy), only the change
of the total polarization ΔP, i.e., the sum of spontaneous and piezoelectric po-
larization, at the quantum well interfaces is important for the calculation of the
polarization ﬁeld. The spontaneous polarization ﬁeld along growth direction can
be calculated by Δ Psp (ϑ) = (Psp
barrier – Psp
well) cos ϑ, were Psp
barrier and Psp
well are
the spontaneous polarizations of the barrier and well, interpolated by Vegard’s
law from the binary constants (Psp
AlN = −0.081, Psp
GaN = −0.029, Psp
InN = −0.032,
(Bernardini et al., 1997)) and ϑ is the inclination angle of the growth plane to
the c-plane, i.e., ϑ = 0 for polar and ϑ = 90◦for non-polar nitrides. Due to the
symmetry of the strain tensor and the piezoelectric tensor, there is no diﬀer-
ence between m-plane-type (10¯1l) and a-plane-type (11¯2l) semipolar planes. To
obtain the piezoelectric polarization the full strain of a structure has to be cal-
culated. Due to the reduced in-plane symmetry in semipolar GaN, this leads to
anisotropic and shear strain, making it necessary to consider all components of
the piezoelectric tensor (Romanov et al., 2006). This leads (for a negative value
of the piezoelectric tensor element e15) to a zero crossing of the piezoelectric
polarization for a certain semipolar orientation. This zero crossing depends on

246
Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
the exact values of the material constants (Feneberg et al., 2006), which are still
being debated. However, a number of experimental results (Raß, 2012; Feneberg
et al., 2010) suggest that the parameters proposed by Romanov et al. (2006) are
a very good ﬁt. A detailed calculation of the total and piezoelectric polariza-
tion in pseudomorphically strained InGaN on GaN and strained AlGaN on GaN
heterostructures can be found in Romanov et al. (2006).
For InGaN/GaN heterostructures, the diﬀerence in spontaneous polariza-
tion is rather small. Large piezoelectric constants in comparison to classical
III/V compounds (Bernardini et al., 1997) and a large lattice mismatch
between InN and GaN of 11% makes piezoelectric ﬁelds dominating in
the InGaN/GaN system causing
98% of the polarization ﬁeld (for c-plane:
ΔPsp
In0.15Ga0.85N/GaN = 0.0005 C/m, ΔPsp
In0.15Ga0.85N/GaN = 0.022). The internal
electric ﬁeld for an In0.15Ga0.88N/GaN QW in dependence of ϑ is depicted in
Fig. 8.1. For the c-plane InGaN QW the ﬁeld F has a magnitude of nearly
2 MV/cm. The zero crossing angle ϑs, can be found at ∼45◦independent of
the indium content. Very close to this point is the (10¯12) orientation with
ϑ = 43.19◦(F = 0.2 MV/cm). More commonly used orientations are (11¯22) at
ϑ = 58.4◦(F = –0.35 MV/cm), (10¯11) at ϑ = 61.96◦(F = –0.4 MV/cm), (20¯21)
at ϑ = 75.09◦(F = –0.35 MV/cm) and the (10¯10) at ϑ = 90◦(F = 0 MV/cm)
orientations (all angles given for GaN). In fact, Schr¨odinger–Poisson calculations
at a carrier density of 1018 cm−3 show that these ﬁelds have a much smaller
impact on the transition energy than the diﬀerent strain states of the QWs
(Wernicke et al., 2012) (see chapter 4b), i.e., such small ﬁelds are easily screened

in devices and other properties, such as surface morphology (Wernicke et al.,
2011; Ploch et al., 2012a; Ploch et al., 2012c), indium uptake (Wernicke et al.,
2012; Browne et al., 2012) (see also Section 8.4.1), critical layer thickness (Ploch
et al., 2012b; Hardy et al., 2012), etc. become more important.
AlGaN/GaN heterostructures exhibit a much larger diﬀerence of the spon-
taneous polarization and a smaller lattice mismatch. Therefore the spontaneous
polarization for c-plane AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is nearly by a factor of
two larger than the piezoelectric polarization. For semipolar AlGaN this is no
longer true due to the complex interdependence of the polarization ﬁeld on the
inclination angle with respect to the c-plane. For strained AlGaN layers on GaN
(relevant for electron blocking layers), at ∼70◦piezoelectric and spontaneous
polarization cancel each other out, leading to a zero crossing of the polariz-
ation ﬁeld. However, calculations for AlGaN strained to AlN and AlGaN, as
these are important for UV-LEDs, are still missing. Also, more conclusive ex-
perimental data are needed to conﬁrm the calculations for the InGaN/GaN and
the AlGaN/GaN material systems. There are indications that applying Vegard’s
law to spontaneous and piezoelectric material parameters imposes non-negligible
errors to the calculations (Miller et al., 2002; Winzer et al., 2005).
The polarization ﬁelds in InGaN/GaN quantum wells result in the QCSE,
which has signiﬁcant eﬀects on the carrier recombination (Miller et al., 1984).
The ﬁeld-induced spatial separation of electron and hole wavefunctions leads
to a reduced wavefunction overlap and consequently to increased radiative
recombination lifetimes (Berkowicz et al., 2000). Since non-radiative and ra-
diative recombination processes are competing, longer radiative recombination
lifetimes lead to a decrease of the internal quantum eﬃciency. It should be
noted, however, that the non-radiative recombination lifetime also depends on
the orientation (Langer et al., 2011). Nevertheless, smaller ﬁelds allow for much
larger quantum well thicknesses in LED heterostructures that in turn reduces
LED droop, i.e., drop in external quantum eﬃciency at higher carrier densities
(Gardner et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2012). In addition, the modal gain in semipolar
lasers increases with thicker QWs due to the increased wavefunction overlap
(Scheibenzuber et al., 2009) (see also chapter 6a). Another beneﬁt of semi-
polar LEDs is the reduced blue-shift of the emission wavelength with increasing
injection current due to the screening of polarization ﬁelds by free carriers
(Kuokstis et al., 2002). This is a big problem for polar c-plane LED; which
experience large emission wavelength shifts and changes in color temperature
with the drive current. One drawback, however, is that semipolar and non-polar
InGaN quantum-well LEDs require a substantially higher indium mole fraction
in order to obtain the same emission wavelength as polar LEDs. Calculations
as well as experimental data show that the polarization ﬁelds in c-plane QWs
lasers are not fully screened even for high carrier densities at lasing threshold.
Actually the red-shifted emission in polar lasers due to the QCSE helps to reach
green laser emission at lower indium mole fractions (Strauß et al., 2011).

248
Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
Also it is important to note that the direction of the polarization ﬁeld in
InGaN heterostructures changes for substrate inclination angles above 45◦. This
does not aﬀect the recombination in quantum wells but aﬀects the carrier in-
jection for structures typically grown from the n-side to the p-side (Kawaguchi
et al., 2012). Therefore it can be advantageous to grow devices on orientations
with ﬂipped polarity, e.g. (20¯2¯1) instead of (20¯21).
8.2
Performance characteristics of violet, blue, and green (0001)
c-plane InGaN quantum well LEDs and laser diodes
(0001) c-plane InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) already exhibit outstanding
levels of performance. This, of course, can also be attributed to two decades
of intense research worldwide, since the ﬁrst demonstration of blue III-nitride-
based LEDs on (0001) GaN/sapphire by Nakamura et al. (1991, 1994, 1995).
Figure 8.2 shows the measured external quantum eﬃciencies (EQE) of InGaN
single and multiple quantum well LEDs grown on c-plane (0001) sapphire
substrates emitting in the violet-to-green spectral range. In addition, the EQEs
of InGaP-based LEDs emitting in the red, orange, and yellow wavelength
spectrum are plotted. As can be seen from Fig. 8.2 the EQE of InGaN-based
LED peaks near 450 nm and rapidly decreases for longer wavelengths. Although
yellow and even red-emitting c-plane InGaN QW LEDs have been demonstrated
(Mukai et al., 1999), their eﬃciencies cannot compete with the performance
of InGaP-based red and yellow LEDs. However, the peak eﬃciencies of InGaP
LEDs appear also to be limited to a narrow spectral range near 650 nm, and
is rapidly decreasing for shorter wavelengths. This situation creates a spectral

region in the green–yellow wavelength range between about 530 nm and 600 nm,
where all semiconductor LEDs exhibit relatively poor external quantum
eﬃciencies—a circumstance that is often addressed as the so-called “green
gap”. For InGaN quantum-well LEDs the drop in EQE originates from multiple
causes: (1) at longer wavelengths the increasing indium mole fraction in
the InGaN QWs results in an increase in the spontaneous and piezoelectric
polarization charges at the InGaN/GaN interfaces (Schmidt et al., 2007). The
resultant polarization ﬁelds result in a spatial separation of the electron and
hole envelope wave-functions and a red-shift of the emission wavelength due
to the quantum-conﬁned Stark eﬀect (QCSE) (Miller et al., 1984). Simulations
of the electron-hole wavefunction overlap for (0001) InGaN/GaN quantum
well show that the envelope electron-hole wavefunction overlap is reduced by
more than 50 % when going from a blue emitter to a green or yellow LED
(Arif et al., 2008). Consequently, the radiative recombination lifetimes in the
InGaN QWs increase signiﬁcantly at longer emission wavelengths (Chichibu
et al., 1999). (2) In addition, at higher indium mole fraction the formation of
extended and point defects in the InGaN layers is enhanced, leading to shorter
non-radiative recombination lifetimes (Lu et al., 2010; Chichibu et al., 2006).
Since the internal quantum eﬃciency ηIQE depends on the radiative lifetime
τrad as well as non-radiative lifetime τnr according to following relationship
ηIQE =
Rrad
Rrad + Rnr
=
1/τrad
1/τrad + 1/τnr
both of these detrimental eﬀects will lead to a reduction in the internal and
consequently also external quantum eﬃciency of the light-emitting devices.
Obviously, the eﬀects also depend on additional factors, such as the threading
dislocation density and temperatures (Karpov and Makarov, 2002; Chichibu
et al., 2006) and may be partially suppressed by potential barriers forming
threading dislocations (Hangleiter et al., 2005).
Furthermore, the EQE also changes with the injection current and current
densities—a phenomenon that is also often described as “droop” or “eﬃciency
droop”. As can be seen in Fig. 8.3, droop is observed for GaN-based LEDs at all
emission wavelengths starting at diﬀerent current densities. Droop is a signiﬁc-
ant impediment for high-power LEDs, e.g. for application in solid-state lighting,
where high light output power levels at low chip cost are required, which can
be achieved only by operating these devices at high current densities. For ex-
ample, the ﬁrst generation of high-power InGaN MQW LEDs were operated at
a dc current of 350 mA with chip sizes in the order of 1 mm2. Currently, high-
power LEDs are operating at currents up to 2 A, which corresponds to current
densities of 200 A/cm2 for the same chip size, and future generations of LEDs
will certainly be driven at even higher current levels. The physical mechanisms
underlying the droop eﬀect are still not completely understood, and are intens-
ively discussed among a number of research groups. Proposed mechanisms for
the droop eﬀect include Auger recombination (Shen et al., 2007; David and

age (Kim et al., 2007b; Piprek, 2010), density-activated defect recombination
(DADR) (Hader et al., 2010), and changing radiative recombination rate and
rate equation analysis (Ryu et al., 2009). It is not the intention here to discuss
the pros and cons of the diﬀerent possible mechanisms. However, almost regard-
less of the speciﬁc cause, the droop eﬀect is certainly inﬂuenced by the strong
polarization ﬁelds in c-plane light-emitting heterostructures. For example, the
large polarization ﬁelds in InGaN/GaN QWs limit the thickness of the QWs,
since thicker QWs will result in a stronger separation of electron and hole envel-
ope wavefunctions, due to the QCSE. Thick InGaN QWs, however, are preferred
for reducing the carrier density in the QWs, in order to reduce Auger recombina-
tion and carrier leakage-related droop eﬀects. Therefore, reducing or eliminating
the polarization ﬁelds in InGaN QWs should also lead to a reduced droop in
III-nitride-based LEDs.
Another challenge for (0001) c-plane light-emitters is the change in peak
emission wavelength with increasing current density. The high carrier densities
at high current densities lead to a partial screening of the polarization ﬁeld in
the InGaN QWs, which in turn reduces the quantum-conﬁned Stark eﬀect. As
a consequence, the peak emission is shifted to shorter wavelengths at higher
current densities (Mukai et al., 1999). This eﬀect is more pronounced for longer-
wavelength LEDs, where the higher indium mole fraction in the InGaN QWs
leads to stronger polarization ﬁelds. Figure 8.3 shows the emission spectra and
external quantum eﬃciencies for blue and green c-plane InGaN MQW LEDs
measured at diﬀerent current densities, and Fig. 8.4 shows the change in emission

wavelength for the same set of LED vs. the drive current. As can be seen, in
all cases the emission shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher currents due to
the screening of the polarization ﬁelds with higher carrier densities. It should
be noted that part of the wavelength shift can be attributed to the ﬁlling of
potential ﬂuctuations that originate from compositional inhomogeneities in the
InGaN QWs. However, this alone cannot explain the observed behavior.
Similarly, c-plane InGaN QW laser diodes are aﬀected by the polarization
ﬁelds. Although the ﬁrst violet laser diodes were demonstrated in late 1995
(Nakamura et al., 1996a; Nakamura et al., 1996b; Nakamura and Fasol, 1997)
and continuous-wave operation with low threshold current densities were shown
just a few years later (Nakamura et al., 1998a; Nakamura et al., 1998b), the
development of blue- and especially green-wavelength InGaN laser diodes lagged
signiﬁcantly compared to the rapid development of high-eﬃciency blue and green
LEDs. For many years the realization of green InGaN-based laser diodes was con-
sidered extremely diﬃcult, if not impossible. Although many factors contribute
to these challenges, the large polarization ﬁelds in c-plane InGaN QWs were
considered to be one of the main causes for the great challenges to realize green
laser diodes. Therefore, the development of laser diodes on non-polar and semi-
polar GaN surfaces is considered one of the most promising approaches for the
realization of high-eﬃciency and high-power true green laser diodes.
Nevertheless, by advancing the waveguide heterostructure and reducing nano-
scopic and microscopic defects in the InGaN materials, several groups have

into the green spectral range. Figure 8.5 shows the reported threshold current
densities of c-plane InGaN QW laser diodes for diﬀerent emission wavelengths
reported for diﬀerent time-periods. Currently c-plane green laser diodes emit-
ting at wavelengths as long as 532 nm have been demonstrated (Schwarz and
Scheibenzuber, 2011). At slightly shorter wavelengths, cw operation of ridge-
waveguide laser diodes with output power levels of more than 100 mW have been
shown (Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011). Almost simultaneously, high-power
green laser diodes on diﬀerent semipolar GaN surfaces have been demonstrated
by several groups (Kubota et al., 2008; Okamoto et al., 2009; Yoshizumi
et al., 2009; Enya et al., 2009; Kelchner et al., 2009; Tyagi et al., 2010; Raring
et al., 2010; Yanashima et al., 2012) emitting at wavelengths as long as 535 nm,
with a light output of more than 100 mW. At the moment the performance char-
acteristics of green lasers on polar and semipolar GaN are very close and which
of these approaches will succeed will be determined sometime in the future.
Parameters such as threshold current densities, wallplug eﬃciency, and output
power will play an important role in that decision, but other important criteria,
such as laser diode lifetimes, manufacturability, and chip cost will certainly play
an important role as well.

Growth of non-polar and semipolar GaN buﬀer layers
for device applications
Most of the excellent non- and semipolar device results were achieved on GaN
bulk substrates (see Sections 8.5 and 8.6). Therefore we will review GaN growth
on bulk substrates. However, for mass production, low-cost large-area substrates
are desirable. These must be heteroepitaxial substrates, since low-cost large-area
semipolar bulk GaN substrates are currently not available.
8.3.1
Growth of GaN on low-defect bulk GaN substrates
The growth of GaN layers on low defect density GaN bulk substrates is governed
by surface diﬀusion processes. However, interaction with threading dislocations
can lead to the formation of macroscopic defects (Wernicke et al., 2011), even
at the low density of ∼105–1 × 107 cm−2 present in bulk substrates (Fujito
et al., 2008). These can be avoided using substrate miscut or proper growth
conditions that limit the adatom diﬀusion length.
In Fig. 8.6 the macroscopic surface morphologies (Normarski contrast images)
of on-axis (10¯12), (10¯11), (11¯22), (20¯21) and (10¯10) GaN layers grown with diﬀer-
ent temperatures and pressures are shown. The (10¯10) surfaces exhibit pyramidal
structures for all growth parameters. These form at screw dislocations when a

Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
pinned surface step leads to a local enhancement of the growth rate (Farrell
et al., 2010). On m-plane GaN this pyramidal surface structure can be avoided
using miscut substrates (Hirai et al., 2007b). The miscut leads to a deﬁned step
orientation and a suﬃciently high step density to completely hinder the formation
of growth spirals. Also, for layers grown on semipolar GaN macroscopic features
can be observed: triangular pyramids on (10¯11), shallow round pyramids on
(10¯12), and elongated hillocks on (11¯22). For (10¯11) triangular pyramids, a dark
spot was found in the center which indicates the presence of a dislocation (not
shown). These are strong indications that dislocations cause macroscopic fea-
tures also in semipolar GaN. However, by changing the growth parameters these
features can be reduced or even eliminated. Two diﬀerent classes of plane can be
distinguished. The low-indexed (10¯11) and (10¯12) smooth with increasing reactor
pressure, whereas the higher-indexed (11¯22) and (20¯21) planes are smoothest for
low reactor pressures. A similar behavior is known from the stability a-plane vs.
m-plane facet (Sun et al., 2008). The m-plane facet is more stable, and smooth
layers can be grown at various growth conditions. The a-plane is rather unstable,
and for a full coalescence low reactor pressure and high temperatures are required
(Chen et al., 2004).
Looking at the microscopic surface morphology of (11¯22) and (20¯21) layers,
distinct stripe patterns are visible (Fig. 8.7). For the (11¯22) surfaces, undulations
with short period are found along [1¯100], and with a longer period along [11¯2¯3]
(Ploch et al., 2012a). On (20¯21) surfaces, undulations with short period are found
along [10¯14], which is the projection of the c-plane onto the growth plane, also de-
noted as c′ (Ploch et al., 2012c). No undulations were found along [11¯20]. These
stripe patterns are the result of anisotropic surface diﬀusion and provide a less
stable surface (in comparison to the (10¯11) and (10¯10) surfaces). Surface diﬀu-
sion activation energies were calculated for (10¯10) and (11¯20) GaN (Lymperakis

and Neugebauer, 2009), showing that adatoms can diﬀuse easily along close-
spaced nitrogen-atom rows. For (10¯10) these are oriented along [1¯210], and the
activation energy for diﬀusion is 4.5 times lower than along the perpendicular
[0001]. For a-plane the closely spaced nitrogen-atom rows are aligned parallel
[0001], and the activation energy for diﬀusion along the perpendicular [1¯100] dir-
ection is higher by a factor of two. Geometrical considerations suggest the same
for the (10¯1l)-type tilted m-plane surfaces (like (10¯11), (10¯12), and also (20¯21))
and (11¯2l)-type tilted a-plane surfaces (like (11¯22)) (Dinh, 2012). In fact, an-
isotropic diﬀusion can explain the formation of undulations on both (11¯22) and
(20¯21) surfaces. In this case the undulation is formed by adatom diﬀusion, and
its period is proportional to the diﬀusion length. For (11¯22) surfaces the undu-
lation with high spatial frequency is oriented along [1¯100] which exhibits a high
diﬀusion barrier on (11¯2l)-type surfaces. Longer diﬀusion occurs along [11¯2¯3].
In fact, from the temperature dependence of the undulation periods, activation
energies of 0.8 eV and 1.3 eV along [11¯2¯3] and [1¯100], respectiviely, were derived
(Ploch et al., 2012a). For (20¯21) the undulations are oriented along the c′ dir-
ection, which exhibits a high diﬀusion barrier on (10¯1l)-type surfaces. However,
in order to explain the occurrence of undulations at all, the facet stability has
to be taken into account (Ploch et al., 2012c). As mentioned above, facets that
exhibit a very high stability are the (10¯11) and (10¯10) facets. Therefore it is
energetically favorable to form areas with (10¯11) and (10¯10)-like surfaces. For
(11¯22) surfaces, the 10¯11 plane are titled by ± 26◦towards [1¯100]. Therefore un-
dulations along [1¯100] are stabilized by the presence (10¯11) micro-facets. For the
(20¯21) surface orientation the (10¯11) plane is titled by 13◦towards [10¯14], and
the (10¯10) plane is tilted by 15◦towards [¯101¯4]. This stabilizes undulations along
[10¯14].
For heteroepitaxial (11¯22) GaN the same dependencies were found. However,
the presence of stacking faults deteriorates the surface (Ploch et al., 2012a), as
was also reported for m-plane GaN (Hirai et al., 2007a).
8.3.2
Growth of GaN on planar heteroepitaxial substrates
In order to reduce the LED device fabrication costs, large-area low-cost sub-
strates are in demand. Polar c-plane LEDs have been demonstrated on (0001)
sapphire and (111) silicon with up to a 6-inch diameter (Dadgar et al., 2006;
Lu et al., 2011). Therefore the easiest approach is to grow heteroepitaxial GaN on
foreign substrates, e.g. sapphire and silicon. The resultant growth plane depends
on the local atomic arrangement and lattice mismatch, i.e., for every substrate
material and orientation an epitaxial relationship is deﬁned. An overview of dif-
ferent orientations that have been realized is given in Fig. 8.8. Non-polar (11¯20)
a-plane GaN was ﬁrst grown on (10¯12) r-plane sapphire (Sano and Aoki, 1976),
but can also be grown on (11¯20) a-plane SiC (Craven et al., 2004b). (10¯10)
m-plane GaN was realized on (100) γ-LiAlO2 (Hellman et al., 1997), (10¯10)
m-plane SiC (Gardner et al., 2005), and (10¯10) m-plane sapphire. Also, semipolar

GaN can be grown heteroepitaxially. (10¯1¯1) GaN was realized on (100) spinel
(Baker et al., 2005), (10¯1¯3) GaN on (110) spinel (Baker et al., 2005) and (10¯10)
m-plane sapphire (Matsuoka and Hagiwara, 2001; Baker et al., 2006), and (11¯22)
GaN on (10¯10) m-plane sapphire as well. Semipolar (11¯26) GaN was grown on
(10¯12) r-plane sapphire by using an AlInN nucleation layer (Bastek et al., 2010).
Semipolar GaN of (10¯1l) type with relatively small inclination angles of 18◦, 26◦,
29◦, 31◦, 34◦, and 47◦can be grown on high-indexed Si substrates by nucleation
of (0001) GaN on Si (111) microfacets (Ravash et al., 2010). Obviously, the epi-
taxial relationship for all these substrates is not unique. For example, on m-plane
sapphire, (10¯10), (10¯1¯3), and (11¯22), GaN was grown. Actually, many more ori-
entations can occur (Ploch et al., 2010), but none of the others were ever observed
to be dominant. A selection of the orientation can be reached by ex situ pretreat-
ment to achieve (10¯10) orientation (Armitage and Hirayama, 2008), nitridation of
the surface to achieve (11¯22) orientation (Baker et al., 2006; Ploch et al., 2010),
and vice versa, to achieve (10¯13) orientation without nitridation. Also, com-
position and growth conditions of the nucleation layer, e.g. AlN (Bougrioua
et al., 2007) or high-temperature GaN nucleation layers to achieve (11¯22) GaN
on m-plane sapphire (Lee et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2010), as well as the subsequent
growth process to select a single domain (Ploch et al., 2011) can lead to a layer
with a single surface orientation. Another issue with heteroepitaxial growth is
twinning (formation of domains with diﬀerent in-plane relationship) due to an
ambiguous epitaxial relationship, as observed for (10¯11) GaN on spinel (Kaeding
et al., 2006) or (10¯1¯3) GaN on sapphire (Frentrup et al., 2011). This can be solved
by using the proper substrate miscut (Kaeding et al., 2006).

Growth of non-polar and semipolar GaN buﬀer layers
257
But even for phase-pure semipolar or non-polar GaN, basal-plane stacking
faults (BSF) and associated defects are typically observed for all heteroep-
itaxial layers grown on planar substrates with a very high density (BSF
105–106 cm−1, threading dislocation density ∼1010 cm−2 (Craven et al., 2002a;
Baker et al., 2005; Venngus et al., 2007)). BSF are faults in the wurtzite ABAB
stacking order, e.g. ABABCBCB, and represent a two-dimensional cubic inclu-
sion within a hexagonal matrix. Diﬀerent types of stacking faults are possible
(Stampﬂand Van de Walle, 1998), classiﬁed by the number of cubically co-
ordinated layers and the displacement vector. Associated defects are partial
dislocations as well as prismatic stacking faults (Li et al., 2005). BSF can be
identiﬁed by transmission electron microscopy as well as by their luminescence
(Li et al., 2005), especially the I1 BSF at 3.42 eV. In terms of defect density,
m-plane GaN is exceptional. Here the BSF density and threading dislocation
density are surprisingly low (104 cm−1 and 109 cm−2), possibly due to a very
small lattice mismatch (Neumann et al., 2009). However, due to an ambiguity
in the nucleation site, stacking mismatch domains occur (Waltereit et al., 2000;
Wernicke, 2010) which might cause the formation of BSF.
Stacking faults do not contribute to non-radiative recombination, but they
deteriorate the surface morphology and thereby heterointerfaces. Also, the
associated defects contribute to non-radiative recombination.
Several reasons for stacking-fault formation were observed: (1) growth of
(000¯1) at the early coalescence (Wu et al., 2003), (2) ambiguous epitaxial rela-
tionship relating to the stacking sequence (Venn´egu`es et al., 2008), (3) formation
at monoatomic steps in the substrate (Vanﬂeet et al., 2003), and (4) relaxation
of strain (Cho et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011).
8.3.3
Strategies for defect reduction for heteroepitaxially grown GaN
As described in the previous section, heteroepitaxial layers grown on planar for-
eign substrates exhibit very-high-defect densities. Many diﬀerent attempts were
undertaken to reduce the density of BSFs and dislocations. A BSF density of
less than ∼104 and dislocation densities below 108 cm−2 would be desirable,
since for such values optically pumped green lasing was observed (Strittmatter
et al., 2010). The observation in c-plane GaN that the threading dislocation dens-
ity decreases with thickness by dislocation annihilation applies to stacking faults
and partial dislocations in non-polar GaN (Tavernier et al., 2004). In principle,
the partial dislocations could bend and annihilate together with the stacking
fault. However, climb or glide on the c-plane of these dislocations seems to be
hindered by the presence of the stacking faults, making it impossible to use the
growth of thick layers for defect reduction. In semipolar GaN a dislocation and
BSF reduction was observed, leading to suﬃciently low-defect densities (Usikov
et al., 2010). The mechanism is unresolved as yet, but it could be caused by
glide of partial dislocations in the c-plane due to shear stress that is not present
in non-polar GaN (Romanov et al., 2006). Another defect-reduction approach

258
Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
successfully employed for c-plane GaN is three-dimensional growth. This idea
was applied to non- and semipolar GaN as well (Hollander et al., 2008; Sun
et al., 2009a; Sun et al., 2009b). A reduction of the BSF and dislocation density
was achieved, but the defect densities are not yet at the desired levels.
Also, in situ and ex situ nanomasking with SiN (Chakraborty et al., 2006b;
Johnston et al., 2009) and ScN (Johnston et al., 2009) or TiN (Tavernier
et al., 2004) has been examined, and typically a strong reduction of threading
dislocation density could be observed, but no or very little reduction of the BSF
density.
The only successful approach to reduce the BSF density to a level at or be-
low ∼104 cm−1 based on a maskless in situ technique was to exploit the strain
relaxation for BSF reduction. This can be accomplished by introducing low-
temperature AlN layers (Dadgar et al., 2011). The SF terminate at the (Al,Ga)N
interface by the formation of partial misﬁt dislocations. However, this mechan-
ism works only for (10¯1l)-type planes (Schulz et al., 2013). After a strong BSF
reduction at the interface, the dislocation density can be reduced further by dis-
location annihilation after growth of thick layers down to a level near 108 cm−2
(Usikov et al., 2010).
Another approach also known from c-plane GaN is lateral epitaxial over-
growth (ELOG) (Beaumont et al., 2001). For this technique, GaN is partly
covered by a lithographically patterned dielectric mask (e.g., SiO2 or SiNx).
During overgrowth, GaN does not grow on the mask, but adatoms diﬀuse to the
GaN surface and are incorporated in the overgrown GaN. This way, GaN can
grow vertically and laterally to form a coalesced layer (see Fig. 8.9). Defects from
the underlying GaN layer are terminated at the mask, and the laterally grown
region above the mask is mostly defect-free. This technique was successfully ap-
plied to a-plane (Wu et al., 2003), m-plane (Haskell et al., 2005) and (11¯22) GaN
(Bougrioua et al., 2007). Usually, stripe masks are employed which ﬁt well to the
surface symmetry of semipolar and non-polar GaN. Due to the low symmetry
of the surface, the stripe orientation is very crucial (Craven et al., 2002b) as it
strongly inﬂuences the defect reduction as well as the formation of facets, the
lateral growth rate, and the coalescence of the layers (Netzel et al., 2008). Here
we will discuss brieﬂy ELOG of a-plane GaN with the low-index stripe orient-
ations of [1¯100], [1¯101], and [0001] stripe orientations (90◦, 45◦and 0◦to the
c-direction). As depicted in Fig. 8.10 for [0001] stripes, the overgrown crystal
develops 10¯10 m-plane facets that lead to some dislocation reduction (as can
be seen from CL), but due to the equivalency of the 10¯10 surfaces the lateral
growth rate is limited. Also, the inclined top facets impede coalescence. The
monochromatic CL image at 3.42 eV also show that BSF can be found in the
coherently grown region (window) as well as in the laterally grown region (wing).
Since the BSF are perpendicular to the stripe orientation they can enter the lat-
erally overgrown region. The [1¯101] stripes develop (10¯1¯1), (11¯20), (01¯11), and
(¯1102) facets which exhibit very diﬀerent growth rates. The fast lateral growth of
the (01¯11) and (¯1102) facets causes a strong dislocation reduction. The inclined

(10¯1¯1) facets are overgrown during the coalescence, leading to a reduction of
threading dislocation density even in the wing regions (Wernicke et al., 2009).
The fast lateral growth and the (11¯20) facet also support coalescence of the lay-
ers. But also for this stripe orientation, BSF can enter the wing region, since they
are inclined to the stripe direction. [1¯100] stripes exhibit a rectangular proﬁle
with (000¯1), (11¯20), and (0001) facets, again with very anisotropic growth rates.
The CL mapping shows a very strong reduction of threading dislocation and BSF
density in the [0001]-grown wing (Wu et al., 2008; Bastek et al., 2008). This shows
that BSF can be reduced by lateral overgrowth only if the growth direction is
perpendicular to the basal plane. By side-wall epitaxy (Imer et al., 2006) a fur-
ther reduction of the defect densities could be realized. These studies show why
many attempts to reduce the BSF density do not produce suﬃciently low BSF
densities if the crystallographic nature of this defect is not taken into account.
In all cases the BSF easily penetrate overgrown regions, as long as the growth is
not in the [0001] direction.
Although the defect densities obtained by the ELOG approach are very good,
growth on stripe-patterned substrates can achieve even lower defect densities and
can be employed for arbitrary surface orientation. The basic idea is to nucleate
(0001) oriented GaN on a tilted side facet of a foreign substrate and to achieve
a semipolar surface by coalescence. Growth on Si <111> etched into (001) Si
by KOH was reported ﬁrst (Honda et al., 2001). Using diﬀerently oriented Si
substrates (10¯11) (Honda et al., 2002), (11¯22) (Tanikawa et al., 2008a), (11¯20)
(Tanikawa et al., 2008b) and (10¯10) (Ni et al., 2010), oriented GaN was grown.

Also, sapphire can be structured so that (0001) c-plane GaN nucleates on either
(0001) c-plane or (11¯20) a-plane-like surfaces. With this technique, (10¯10) (Okada
et al., 2008), (11¯20) (Okada et al., 2011a), (10¯11) (Schwaiger et al., 2010), (11¯22)
(Schwaiger et al., 2011) and (20¯21) (Okada et al., 2011b) GaN layers have been
fabricated. The key for such layers is to control nucleation sites by masking with
SiO2 and by the nucleation conditions. In addition, achieving coalescence is a
major issue requiring optimization of substrate miscut and growth conditions.
For structured substrates the c-plane nucleation allows rather low threading dis-
location densities which are further reduced by the subsequent growth, and dislo-
cation densities as low as 1 × 105 cm−2 have been achieved (Murase et al., 2011).
Also, the formation of stacking faults during nucleation can be prevented in this
way. However, the layers still exhibit a low density of stacking faults (the density
of BSF bundles is typically 2 × 103 cm−1 (Schwaiger et al., 2011)) due to an ex-
posed (000¯1) facet during coalescence. But approaches for eliminating these resid-
ual stacking faults were proposed (Schwaiger et al., 2011). Heteroepitaxial growth
of low-defect-density non- and semipolar GaN is much more challenging than
c-plane growth, especially due to the formation of basal-plane stacking faults and

associated defects. So far, the most promising approach appears to be the use of
c-plane nucleation on side facets of structured sapphire or silicon substrates.
8.4
Growth of InGaN layers and quantum wells on m-plane and
diﬀerent semipolar surfaces, i.e. (10¯12), (10¯11), (20¯21), (11¯22)
InGaN quantum wells are the most important part of visible emitting LEDs and
lasers. Recombination dynamics in non- and semipolar InGaN are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent, not only due to the reduced polarization ﬁelds (see also Section 8.1) but
also due to the reduced symmetry of the surfaces leading to anisotropic and shear
strain. Also, there are major diﬀerences in the growth of InGaN due to diﬀerent
surfaces and reconstructions leading to diﬀerent adatom bonding strengths, ad-
atom incorporation, and adatom diﬀusion barriers (see Section 8.3.1). This leads
to a diﬀerent indium incorporation for the diﬀerent non- and semipolar surfaces.
8.4.1
Indium incorporation eﬃciency for diﬀerent surface orientations
The indium incorporation depends strongly on the surface orientation (Wernicke
et al., 2012). However, a conclusive picture cannot yet be drawn, since growth
parameters have an impact on the relative indium incorporation on diﬀerent
planes (Browne et al., 2012). Thus, the reported relative indium incorporation
of the (11¯22) varies from higher (Tanikawa et al., 2011; Wernicke et al., 2012)
to similar (J¨onen et al., 2012) to lower incorporation (Browne et al., 2012) in
comparison to the (0001) c-plane. Because the presence of morphological defects,
e.g. caused by dislocations or BSF, typically increases the indium incorporation
(Chakraborty et al., 2005b), we will focus only on QW grown on high-quality
bulk substrates. Firstly, the indium content of a semipolar InGaN layer is not
easily accessible by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) due to a triclinic distortion of the
unit cell caused by anisotropic strain and shear strain (Romanov et al., 2006).
Diﬀerent methods of analyzing the XRD data were proposed for pseudomorph-
ically strained InGaN layers on GaN (Young et al., 2011) as well as for layers
with an arbitrary strain state (J¨onen et al., 2012). Additionally, measurements
on quantum wells are more diﬃcult, since the material volume is usually small
and evaluation requires the knowledge of the exact barrier and quantum-well
thickness. The comparison of the emission wavelength, e.g. from PL or EL meas-
urements, is much easier and more reliable than the comparison of the indium
content. However, extracting the relative indium incorporation requires complex
calculations that imposes rather large uncertainties. Finally, it must be kept in
mind that indium content from luminescence experiments relate to regions with
the highest indium content (Kuokstis et al., 2002), whereas XRD provides the
average indium content. Larger localization energies therefore cause a deviation
of local PL indium content and average XRD indium contents. The emission
energy for a set of QWs grown on polar, semipolar, and non-polar GaN with
diﬀerent growth temperatures at a gas phase composition xgas of 25% is shown
in Fig. 8.11 (Wernicke et al., 2012). The following order-of-emission energies can

be extracted: (10¯11) < (11¯22) = (0001) < (20¯21) < (10¯10) = (10¯12). This ratio
can be found for the whole temperature range. This means that long-wavelength
emitters on (10¯11) can be grown at substantially higher temperatures than on
the c-plane, and even more so on (10¯10) GaN. From this set of data the corres-
ponding indium content was calculated using k.p theory and Schrdinger–Poisson
calculations (Schade et al., 2011b). Again, a hierarchy for the indium incorpor-
ation eﬃcency can be found throughout the entire temperature range: (10¯11)
> (11¯22) > (0001) = (20¯21) = (10¯10) = (10¯12) (Wernicke et al., 2012). Thus
the (10¯11) surface shows the highest indium incorporation. Also, the (11¯22) ex-
hibits increased indium incorporation, whereas incorporation of indium on the
other planes is relatively similar. We also compared the indium incorporation
into thick (>30 nm) InGaN layers on (0001) and (20¯21) GaN, which can be
accurately measured by XRD. The indium incorporation for (20¯21) InGaN was
lower by a factor of ∼2 at 725◦C, and xgas up to 41% was measured (Wernicke
et al., 2012). This is in contradiction to the results of the QWs, and indicates a
much higher localization energy in (20¯21) InGaN, a strong (vertical) segregation
a c-plane or a higher polarization ﬁeld in (20¯21). Overall, ﬁnal conclusions cannot
be drawn yet, and additional optical and structural investigations are necessary.
Although the indium incorporation is highest on (10¯11), the best device res-
ults are obtained on other planes (see Sections 8.4 and 8.5). Other factors such
as point-defect incorporation and critical layer thickness must be considered
as well.

8.4.2
Optical properties of non-polar and semipolar InGaN QWs
The reduced impact of the QCSE in semipolar InGaN QWs can be seen in
the smaller shift of the emission wavelength with increasing well-width (Craven
et al., 2004a) and increasing injection-current (Sharma et al., 2005). In addition,
as the wavefunction overlap in non-and semipolar QWs increases, the recombin-
ation lifetime decreases (Netzel et al., 2010a). This could of course be caused
by a short non-radiative life time—even at 10 K—which we could exclude by
comparison to c-plane samples (Netzel et al., 2011b). In addition, the exciton
binding energy in non- and semipolar QWs is enhanced (Netzel et al., 2010b).
This allows the observation of excitonic recombination rather than bimolecular
recombination at room temperature for (10¯10) and (11¯22) InGaN quantum wells.
PL measurements also revealed a delayed S-shape of the quantum-well lumin-
escence emission energy (Netzel et al., 2011a; Wernicke et al., 2012). This is
a sign for an increased localization energy (Li et al., 2005). InGaN QWs on
(0001) c-plane typically exhibit an S-shape turning point of ∼150 K, whereas
semi- and non-polar InGaN QWs can exhibit turning points at temperatures
exceeding 300 K (Netzel et al., 2011b). This is accompanied by an increased
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the emission spectra. In order to diﬀer-
entiate between long-range ﬂuctuations and microscopic localization, micro-PL
measurements were performed. These scans show very small ﬂuctuations of the
emission energy in 5 × 5 μm2 areas as shown in Fig. 8.12. The emission energy
of the (11¯22) In0.24Ga0.76N varies by only 12 meV and the minimum intensity
is 78 % of the local maximum, which is small in comparison to c-plane QWs.
Single spectra (spatial resolution is 400 nm) reveal a local FWHM that increases

strongly with the emission wavelength (Fig. 8.13). This is another indication to
highly localized states in non- and semipolar QWs.
The reduced quantum conﬁned Stark eﬀect is not the only diﬀerence for the
recombination in semipolar and c-plane QWs. The anisotropic and shear strain
that causes the zero crossing of the piezoelectric ﬁeld (see Section 8.1) also
aﬀects the band structure (Schade et al., 2011b), causing polarized emission
and a shift of the transition energy (Wernicke et al., 2012). The reduction of
surface symmetry lifts the isotropic symmetry of the hole wavefunction within
the basal plane. The three typical valance subbands of (0001) InGaN (light-hole
LH, heavy-hole HH, and split-oﬀhole SH band) mix into new subbands.
The symmetry of the wavefunction deﬁnes the selection rules and thus the
polarization of the emitted light. In c-plane GaN the light emitted from the LH
and HH band is polarized perpendicular to the c-axis isotropically in the basal
plane, and the SH is polarized parallel to the c-axis. For non-polar InGaN the
topmost valence band (called A1) is formed from a mix of LH and HH, and is po-
larized mostly perpendicular to the c-direction. For semipolar QWs, the valence
bands are formed again from a mix of LH and HH bands, and with increasing
shear strain (maximum at 45◦) a portion of the SH band. This leads to a reduced
degree of polarization of the single subbands. The calculations also predict an or-
thogonal polarization of the second-highest (B1) subband (Fig. 8.14), at least for
small k-values (Schade et al., 2011a). The model also describes the polarization
switching (change of the subband polarization from perpendicular to c towards
parallel to c) observed for (11¯22) InGaN quantum wells by increasing the indium
content. The switching point is present for all indium content, and dominant c′

Fig. 8.14. Optical polarization degree of the top-most subbandlevel A1 and the
second top-most subbandlevel B1 of an In0.15Ga0.85N QW strained to GaN
in dependence of the tilt angle to the c-plane. A polarization degree of 1 rep-
resents total polarization with E perpendicular to the c axis. A polarization
degree of -1 corresponds to a polarization of the subband parallel to c′ (the
projection of the c-axis). Measurement points represent the polarization at
5 K of violet-emitting InGaN QWs (∼15 % indium content). At this tem-
perature the B1 subband is not populated, and the A1 polarization can be
measured directly (Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011; Schade et al., 2012b).

polarization was experimentally veriﬁed for (10¯12) InGaN QWs. The switching
point increases to higher angles with increasing indium content to a maximum
angle of 69◦(calculated for InN on GaN). The (20¯21) and (10¯10) cannot be
aﬀected by polarization switching. Since subband polarization and distance
depend strongly on strain, strain relaxation inﬂuences the polarization (Koslow
et al., 2012). The polarization degree of an InGaN QW at room temperature
is not only given by the subband polarization, but is further reduced by occu-
pation of the orthogonally polarized B1 subband. Therefore, a high degree of
polarization can be achieved only for inclination angles >65◦for a wide range of
indium content, due to high subband polarization and subband spacing (Schade
et al., 2011a; Schade et al., 2011b). Also, inclination angles between 15◦and 55◦
might allow for a high degree of polarization for suﬃciently high indium content
if the subband distance is large enough. Only the (10¯11) exhibits a rather low de-
gree of polarization for all indium content. Experimentally observed polarization
values agree mostly with the calculated ones (Schade et al., 2011a). The trend is
even observed in localization centers with diﬀerent indium content causing the
inhomogeneous broadening (Schade et al., 2012a). Surprisingly, the polarization
observed in (20¯21) QWs is much lower than expected (Schade et al., 2011a).

266
Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
Although the subband polarization ﬁts the calculated values very well, the meas-
ured subband spacings are much larger, leading to a higher degree of polarization
at room temperature than expected from the calculation (Schade et al., 2011b).
This eﬀect of split subbands can be used to produce LEDs with strongly
polarized emission, and also increases the optical gain in lasers (see Section 8.6).
The eﬀect can also be used to extract the quasi-Fermi level and thereby the
carrier density in the quantum well (Schade et al., 2012b).

Performance characteristics of non-polar and semipolar
InGaN QW LEDs
8.5.1
External quantum eﬃciencies and emission wavelength
Within the past decade the eﬃciency and spectral range of non- and semipolar
LEDs has increased rapidly. First, non- and semipolar InGaN QW LEDs were
demonstrated on heteroepitaxially-grown defect-reduced (11¯20) GaN on a-plane
sapphire substrates (Chakraborty et al., 2004) as well as on (10¯1¯1) and (10¯1¯3) ori-
ented GaN grown on (100) and (110) spinel (MgAl2O4) substrates (Chakraborty
et al., 2005a). However, due to the relatively large threading dislocation dens-
ities and basal-plane stacking faults in these heteroepitaxially grown layers,
the light output of the LEDs just barely exceeded one mW, and the external
quantum eﬃciencies were a fraction of 1% (Chakraborty et al., 2005a). The
performance of non- and semipolar LED improved signiﬁcantly with the devel-
opment of low-defect-density bulk GaN substrates cut along non- and semipolar
orientations. First, blue- and violet-emitting InGaN QW LEDs were demon-
strated on low-defect-density (10¯10) m-plane GaN single crystals by Okamoto
et al. as well as Chakraborty et al. with EQE of 3.1 % and 1.1 %, respect-
ively (Okamoto et al., 2006; Chakraborty et al., 2006a). Simultaneously, ﬁrst
blue, green, and even amber InGaN quantum-well LEDs were realized on (11¯22)
semipolar bulk GaN substrates with EQEs of 4.0 %, 4.9 %, and 1.6 %, respect-
ively (Funato et al., 2006). After these initial breakthroughs, the eﬃciency of
non- and semipolar LEDs increased signiﬁcantly within a short period of time.
Schmidt et al. (Schwarz and Kneissl, 2007) reported on high-eﬃciency non-polar
InGaN QW violet LEDs on low-defect-density bulk m-plane GaN substrates
with EQEs of 38.9 %, and high-eﬃciency semipolar blue LEDs on free-standing
(10¯1¯1) bulk GaN substrates have been demonstrated by Zhong et al. (2007)
with EQEs of 29%. Shortly thereafter, Sato et al. (2007) reported high-power
green InGaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW) light-emitting diodes grown on low
extended-defect-density semipolar (11¯22) bulk GaN substrate with peak external
quantum eﬃciencies of more than 12 %. More recently, high-power and high-
eﬃciency blue InGaN LEDs have also been demonstrated by Koslow et al. on
semipolar (30¯33) GaN substrates with peak EQEs of 26.5 % (Koslow et al., 2010),
and Pan et al. on semipolar (20¯2¯1) GaN with maximum external quantum
eﬃciencies of 50.1 % (Koslow et al., 2010).

Non-polar and semipolar InGaN QW LEDs

Figure 8.15 shows examples of InGaN MQW and SQW LED heterostructure
on semipolar (10¯1¯1) and (20¯2¯1) GaN substrate, respectively. The active region
of the LED on (10¯1¯1) GaN substrate is comprised of six periods of 3-nm thick
InGaN quantum wells separated by 20-nm wide undoped GaN barriers. The
MQW stack is covered by a 10-nm thick nominally undoped Al0.15Ga0.85N elec-
tron blocking layer followed by a 200-nm thick Mg-dopded GaN contact layer.
Although the design of the device heterostructure appears quite straightforward
and is very similar to c-plane LEDs, there are some remarkable diﬀerences. Kim
et al. (2007a), as well as Zhong et al. (2007), demonstrate high-eﬃciency non-
and semipolar blue LEDs on m-plane and (10¯1¯1) GaN with a nominally un-
doped Al0.15Ga0.85N electron blocking layers (EBL). This design detail is very
diﬀerent from c-plane LED, where the functionality of the EBL within an LED
heterostructure depends on the ability to incorporate p-type AlGaN:Mg electron
blocking layers. Another interesting detail is the utilization of 12-nm thick InGaN
single-quantum-well active region in semipolar LEDs, as described e.g. by Pan
et al. (2012), and also shown in Fig. 8.15b). This design is a direct result of the
reduced polarization ﬁelds in semipolar InGaN/GaN heterostructures, which,
due to a signiﬁcantly reduced piezoelectric ﬁeld, enables the use of thick InGaN
QWs without detrimental eﬀect on the electron-hole envelope wavefunction
overlap. As a consequence of the larger QW thickness and the shorter radiative re-
combination lifetimes, the carrier densities for a ﬁxed current density are also re-
duced, which could reduce higher-order carrier-density eﬀects such as Auger-type
recombination. This should result in much smaller eﬃciency droop at increasing

8.5.2
Polarization eﬀects and eﬃciency droop
As described in the previous section, the indium incorporation eﬃciency during
growth of InGaN quantum wells and layers depends strongly on the surface
orientation of the layers. Whereas non-polar GaN surfaces seem to exhibit
reduced indium incorporation eﬃciencies, some of the semipolar surface orient-
ations appear to have a high indium incorporation compared to InGaN on polar
(0001) surfaces (Wernicke et al., 2012). Therefore, some of the semipolar orient-
ations, in particular (10¯11), (11¯22) and (20¯21), seem ideally suited for realizing
long-wavelength light emitters, as can be also seen in Fig. 8.16.
A number of groups have investigated the magnitude and direction of the po-
larization ﬁeld in polar and semipolar (11¯22) InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs)
by bias-dependent photoluminescence (Funato et al., 2010) and electroreﬂectance
spectroscopy (Renner et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2010). These
investigations reveal signiﬁcantly reduced polarization ﬁeld strength in semipolar
InGaN/GaN quantum wells compared to c-plane QWs. Whereas the polariza-
tion ﬁeld in InGaN/GaN QWs is in the range of 1–1.4 MV/cm, even at moderate
indium mole fractions as low as 9 %, the polarization ﬁeld in (11¯22) QWs was
found to be –0.68 MV/cm and 0.26 MV/cm, even at high indium contents of 38 %
and 49 %, respectively. These studies seem to also reveal polarization switching,
e.g. a piezoelectric polarization ﬁeld that is oriented in the opposite direction

compared to the piezoelectric ﬁeld in c-plane InGaN/GaN QWs. The observed
polarization switching behaviour seems to depend on the indium mole fraction in
the InGaN QW and the resultant pseudomorphic strain in the heterostructure.
Modelling results by Yan et al. (2010) show that the ordering of the two top-most
valence bands of (11¯22) semipolar InGaN on GaN is highly dependent on the
shear strain and the anisotropic strain in the c-plane, which might explain the
observed change of the electric ﬁeld orientation for (11¯22) InGaN/GaN QWs.

Performance characteristics of non-polar and semipolar
InGaN QW lasers
8.6.1
Gain characteristics of InGaN quantum-well lasers on non-polar
and semipolar GaN and eﬀects of the excitation stripe orientation
Due to the broken symmetry in semi- and non-polar III-nitride laser heterostruc-
tures, the optical properties will become directional-dependent. This anisotropy
aﬀects in particular the optical gain in non- and semipolar InGaN laser diodes.
The anisotropic strain in InGaN quantum wells pseudomorphically grown on non-
and semipolar GaN substrates is further adding to the anisotropy in the optical
gain. Recently, Scheibenzuber et al. (Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011) as well
as Rass et al. (2010b, 2012) have theoretically and experimentally investigated
the optical gain and polarization for diﬀerent directions of the laser resonators
as well as surface orientations. Furthermore, due to the birefringence of wurtzite
III-nitride materials, other optical properties also become directional-dependent,
e.g. the real part of the refractive index. As a consequence, the laser threshold
current densities as well as the optical polarization of the laser light depend
strongly on the surface orientation, the direction of the laser resonator, and the
strain in the InGaN/GaN quantum wells. For example, investigation of InGaN
quantum-well laser diodes grown on (11¯22) GaN substrate show very diﬀerent
threshold power densities as well as polarization characteristics, depending on
whether the laser resonator is oriented along the [10¯10] m-direction or the [11¯23]
c′-direction. The threshold power densities for ampliﬁed stimulated emission for
resonators oriented along the [10¯10] m-direction are almost twice as large as
threshold power densities for the resonators along the [11¯23] c′-direction. This
behaviour can be explained by anisotropic optical gain for the two diﬀerent res-
onator orientations. Figure 8.17 shows the measured and calculated gain spectra
for (11¯22) InGaN SQW laser heterostructures with resonator orientations along
the [10¯10] m-direction or the [11¯23] c′-direction. For similar excitation power
densities the highest peak gain is obtained for laser resonators oriented along
the [11¯23] c′-direction and the TE polarized optical modes. As a consequence,
the lowest threshold power densities are also obtained for the same resonator ori-
entation, and the laser emission is predominantly TE polarized. This behaviour
is conﬁrmed by theoretical calculation of the optical gain in (11¯22) laser diodes
(Scheibenzuber et al., 2009; Scheibenzuber, 2012) that is shown in Fig. 8.17 b)

within the c-plane is isotropic and therefore also the valence band structure is
isotropic. Heavy- and light-hole valence bands are basically degenerate at the
gamma point and contribute evenly to the optical gain. Consequently, (0001)
InGaN QW lasers exhibit predominantly TE polarized gain and show lasing in
the TE mode regardless of the resonator orientation. For non-c-plane InGaN

QWs the strain is anisotropic, reducing the symmetry of the band structure.
Therefore, it is expected that the optical gain on non- and semipolar InGaN QWs
shows a directional dependence, and the degeneracy of the heavy and light hole
valence bands is lifted. For non-polar (10¯10) m-plane InGaN quantum wells the
X′-band is the energetically highest valence band, and hence optical transitions
and gain exhibit TE polarized emission with the electric ﬁeld vector E perpendic-
ular to the (0001) c-axis. The 6 x 6 k.p calculations of Scheibenzuber et al. (2009)
also show that the optical gain in non-polar InGaN QWs should be strongly TE,
and that the peak gain for the same charge carrier density should be signiﬁcantly
larger than for polar (0001) QWs, which should result in a signiﬁcant reduction
in the threshold current density for non-polar InGaN quantum-well laser diodes.
Due to the anisotropic strain, the valence bands in semipolar InGaN quantum
wells are a superposition of diﬀerent quantum levels. As a result, the optical
transitions include contributions from diﬀerent polarization states which depend
on the indium mole fraction and strain in the QWs, as well as the speciﬁc orient-
ation of the growth surface. For (11¯22) InGaN QWs the A1 valence band is the
top-most valence band followed by the B1 valence band. Modelling of the gain

272
Optical and structural properties of InGaN light-emitters
characteristics of (11¯22) InGaN QWs by Scheibenzuber et al. (2009) shows that
the material gain for TE mode for semipolar quantum wells with a c′ [11¯2¯3] res-
onator orientation is signiﬁcantly higher than the material gain for the TM. This
behaviour was also conﬁrmed in gain measurement by Rass et al. (2012) that
are plotted in Fig. 8.17. These experiments also demonstrated that the net gain
for the c′ [11¯2¯3] resonator orientation is higher than for the resonator aligned
along the m [1¯100] direction. Simulations by Scheibenzuber et al. (2009) also
showed that for similar charge-carrier densities, semipolar InGaN QWs exhibit
much higher TE optical gain than polar (0001) QWs, which should translate
in a signiﬁcant reduction in the threshold current density for semipolar laser
diodes. Figure 8.19 (a) exhibits the light-output vs. pump-power characteristic
for optically excited InGaN QW lasers grown on (11¯2¯2) GaN substrates. As can
be seen, the threshold power density Pth of lasers with the resonators oriented
along the c′ [11¯23] is nearly a factor of two smaller than for laser resonators
oriented along the m [1¯100] direction, conﬁrming the anticipated behaviour. The
situation in semipolar laser diodes is further complicated due to the birefringence
of wurtzite crystal materials. This leads to diﬀerent conﬁnement factors for TE,
TM polarized modes and to the formation of ordinary and extraordinary modes
for resonators along the m [1¯100] direction (Rass et al., 2012). In Fig. 8.19 (b) the
polarization of eigenmodes for lasers in (11¯22) GaN substrates is plotted for ex-
citation power densities above the ampliﬁed stimulated emission (ASE) threshold
and was normalized to the peak power. As can be seen, the polarization angle of
the c′ [11¯23] has its maximum at 90◦corresponding to the TE mode, whereas the
m [1¯100] exhibits a maximum at a polarization angle near 55◦, corresponding to
the extraordinary mode. A systematic study of blue and violet lasers on diﬀerent
semipolar and m-plane GaN substrates, plotted in Fig. 8.19 (c), shows that for
all resonators oriented along the c′ direction the ASE is always TE-polarized. In
contrast, lasers with the resonator oriented along the m or a direction always ex-
hibit ASE polarization angles Θ, close to the growth plane angle α. In the latter
case the optical polarization is governed by the birefringence of the III-nitride
materials. Nevertheless, the preferred resonator alignment remains the c′ [11¯23]
direction, since lasers oriented in the m [1¯100] direction always exhibit higher
threshold-power densities (Raß, 2012).
8.6.2
Fabrication of laser cavities (e.g., etched, cleaved facets)
The fabrication of smooth mirror facets for laser heterostructures grown on
non- and semipolar GaN is quite challenging. The best approach depends on
the surface orientation as well as on the orientation of the laser resonator. On
(0001) c-plane laser diodes grown on bulk GaN substrates, fabrication of smooth
cleaved facets is quite straightforward. The laser resonators grown on the polar
c-plane surface are typically oriented in the m-direction. Since the m-plane also
is a low-energy surface it provides a natural cleaving plane for the formation
of smooth cleaved facets that are perpendicular to the c-plane. Therefore, the

fabrication of high-quality mirrors on c-plane GaN is quite similar to the well-
established approaches of GaAs and InP-based laser diodes. In the case of laser
diodes on non-polar surfaces, e.g. lasers on m-plane GaN, two diﬀerent resonator
orientations are possible, either aligned along the c-direction or aligned along the
a-direction. The laser-scribing and cleaving process utilizes a focused UV laser
beam from a frequency-tripled 355-nm Nd:YAG laser that scribes narrow grooves
into the backside of the GaN substrate. The grooves are typically 10–20 μm wide

and reach about half-way into the GaN substrate. The laser-scribed groove de-
termines the cleavage direction for the laser facet, which is obtained in a second
step by manually cleaving along the scribed grooves.
The quality of the facets depends on the substrate orientation and on
the orientation of the resonator, i.e. the crystal plane that is being cleaved.
For laser diodes on bulk m-plane GaN, both resonator orientation, i.e. in the
[0001] c-direction and [11¯20] a-direction, the laser-scribing and cleaving pro-
cess yields smooth facets that are aligned perpendicular to the laser resonator.

on semipolar bulk GaN is much more diﬃcult, and the facet quality depends
strongly on the resonator direction. For example, facets for InGaN quantum-well
laser diodes grown on (11¯22) bulk GaN can be cleaved either along the [10¯10]
m-direction or [11¯2¯3] c′-direction. Whereas the [10¯10] laser facets show relatively
smooth surfaces, no low-energy cleavage plane exist for the resonator cleaved
in the [11¯2¯3] c′-direction. When facets are cleaved along the [11¯2¯3] c′-direction
the cleaved surfaces exhibit large steps and terraces that are not perpendicu-
lar to the resonator direction. The rough surfaces are probably generated by
cleaves along competing lower-energy surfaces, resulting in large steps and ter-
races. Jens Raß and colleagues have systematically studied the formation of
facets by laser-scribing and cleaving on laser heterostructures grown on diﬀer-
ent non- and semipolar bulk GaN substrates, as well as with diﬀerent resonator
orientations (Rass et al., 2010a; Raß, 2012). An overview of the resultant facet
quality on the diﬀerent growth planes and resonator orientations is summarized
in Table 8.1.
Another approach for realizing laser facets is by dry etching. The advantage
of this technique is that the facet quality depends only slightly on the reson-
ator and substrate orientation. Therefore, this approach is suitable for almost
all non- and semipolar laser diodes. The patterning process consists of three
steps. First a 500-nm thick SiNx layer is deposited by plasma-assisted chemical
vapor deposition (PECVD), followed by a layer of photoresist, which is photo-
lithographically patterned in order to deﬁne openings in the SiNx mask for the
subsequent dry-etching process. After the SiNx mask is formed, the group-III-
nitride laser heterostructure is etched by a chlorine-based inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) etching or reactive ion etching step. Figure 8.20 (b) shows an SEM
image of a (11¯2¯3) facet of a laser heterostructure grown on a semipolar (11¯22)
bulk GaN substrate obtained by inductively coupled plasma (IPC) etching. By
optimizing the dry-etching conditions, i.e. accelerating voltages and substrate
temperature, nearly vertical mesa sidewalls with a facet angle of 83◦relative to

semipolar GaN surface orientations and for diﬀerent resonator orientations (Rass
et al., 2010a).

the laser waveguide plane can be obtained. To further improve the facet quality,
additional wet chemical treatment steps can be used, e.g. by etching the exposed
mesa sidewalls in hot KOH dissolved in ethylene glycol (Rass et al., 2010a).
Alternatively, the facet can be smoothed as well as realigned close to the ideal
90◦angle by subsequent focused ion-beam etching (FIB) step. Figure 8.20 (c)
shows an SEM image of an extremely smooth and perpendicular (11¯2¯3) facet
after focused ion-beam etching (FIB). Although this technique yields excellent
result it is not suitable for mass production of laser facets, due to the slow
etching process. Overall, the dry-etching approach results in good mirror facets,
though with the disadvantage that the laser facet extends only a few microns
from the top surface, which can cause some interference of the laser beam with
the remaining substrate.
8.6.3
State-of-the-art of non-polar and semipolar InGaN laser diodes
Since the demonstration of the ﬁrst non-polar laser diode on m-plane GaN in
2007 by Schmidt et al. (Schwarz and Kneissl, 2007), and more or less simul-
taneously by Okamoto et al. (2007), progress in the performance characteristics
of InGaN laser diodes on non- and semipolar GaN has been tremendous. At
present, current-injection InGaN quantum-well laser diodes have been realized
on a number of diﬀerent semipolar surface orientations, including laser diodes on
(11¯22), (10¯1¯1), (20¯21), (20¯2¯1), and (30¯31) GaN substrates (Asamizu et al., 2008;
Tyagi et al., 2007; Enya et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2010). The
laser emission wavelengths have been pushed towards the true green spectral
range (Takagi et al., 2012; Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011) and high-power
blue laser diodes (Farrell et al., 2011; Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011) have
been demonstrated.
Figure 8.21 summarizes the reported performance characteristics of InGaN
QW laser diodes grown on diﬀerent non- and semipolar substrates in the vi-
olet, blue, and green spectral regions. As can be seen, laser diodes with low
threshold current densities can be achieved both for non- and semipolar sur-
face orientations, and lasers operating continuous-wave (cw) have been realized
in the entire spectral range. Nevertheless, which of these diﬀerently oriented
non- and semipolar orientations will be best suited to meet the requirements
put forward by applications such as laser projection and micro-displays is still
to be decided. The ideal orientation will certainly depend on the speciﬁc emis-
sion wavelength that is being targeted. Obviously, achieving the lowest threshold
current densities, lowest operating voltages, highest diﬀerential quantum eﬃcien-
cies, highest output power levels, and long lifetimes will determine the choice of
the ideal substrate orientation. All these parameters are governed by a number
of diﬀerent factors that themselves depend on the surface orientation. Critical
factors such as indium incorporation eﬃciency, low-resistance Mg- and Si-doped
layers, optical gain, transverse mode conﬁnement, strain relaxation, and form-
ation of defect heterostructure interfaces, homogeneity of the InGaN, InAlN,

and AlGaN layers, and ease of fabrication, e.g. formation of facets and laser
resonators, will have to be taken into account. For example, high-eﬃciency and
low-threshold blue laser diodes have been realized on m-plane GaN substrate
showing light-output power-levels of several Watts (Raring et al., 2011). On
the other hand, recent experimental data suggest that the m-plane surface is
not well suited for obtaining true green laser diodes, which has been attrib-
uted mainly to the low incorporation eﬃciency on (10¯10) surfaces (Wernicke
et al., 2012; Northrup, 2009). In order to obtain true green laser diodes emit-
ting in the 520–535 nm spectral range, currently the most promising approach
appears to be growth on GaN substrates with (20¯21), (20¯2¯1), and (30¯31) orient-
ation (Huang et al., 2011; Schwarz and Scheibenzuber, 2011; Takagi et al., 2012).
High-power green laser diodes on semipolar (20¯21) GaN substrates operating at
wavelengths beyond 530 nm with cw output power levels of more than 100 mW
and wallplug eﬃciencies of nearly 8 % (Takagi et al., 2012). Laser diodes on semi-
polar (20¯21) GaN substrates hold the current record for the longest emission
wavelength ever achieved with a group-III-nitride-based device with laser emis-
sion at 535.7 nm (Takagi et al., 2012). Nevertheless, other semipolar orientations
also show promising results, e.g. recently AlGaN cladding-free InGaN quantum-
well laser diodes grown (30¯31) GaN have been demonstrated with threshold
current densities as low as 5.6 kA/cm2 and emission wavelength near 445 nm

(Hsu et al., 2010). Remarkably, an extremely small wavelength shift of only
4 nm between the peak electroluminescence wavelength and the laser emission
wavelength has been observed. This is similar to blue laser diodes on m-plane
GaN, and considerably lower than the wavelength shift for polar blue laser di-
odes on (0001) GaN, indicating very small piezoelectric ﬁelds in the InGaN
quantum wells (QWs). Another peculiarity of non- and semipolar lasers is the
use of AlGaN-cladding-free heterostructure designs. Whereas (0001) laser diodes
almost always incorporate AlGaN n- and p-cladding layers in their separate con-
ﬁnement heterostructure in order to increase the transverse mode conﬁnement,
this is often not the case for non- and semipolar lasers (see Fig. 8.22). One reason
is the anisotropic strain in lattice-mismatched AlGaN cladding layers grown on
non- and semipolar GaN substrates, resulting in stress relaxation and the form-
ation of misﬁt dislocation at the GaN/AlGaN heterostructure interface (Young
et al., 2010). Thus the critical layer thickness for AlGaN/GaN heterostructure is
signiﬁcantly reduced, and consequently AlGaN-cladding-free laser heterostruc-
tures employing thick InGaN waveguide layers have been developed, and low
threshold lasers have been successfully demonstrated (Rass et al., 2012; Farrell
et al., 2011).
Just recently, the ﬁrst non-polar vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser diode
(VCSEL) on m-plane GaN substrates has been realized by Holder et al. (2012),
emitting near 412 nm. The laser cavities were formed by selective photoelectrical
chemical etching (PEC) in order to remove the GaN substrate and subsequent
deposition of SiO2/Ta2O5 distributed Bragg reﬂectors on the top and bottom to
form the VCSEL cavity. Although the threshold current densities of these ﬁrst
non-polar VCSELs were very high, the VCSEL devices exhibited very interesting
optical properties, such as polarization locking of the laser emission along the
[1¯210] a-direction, which is a consequence of the band alignment of the wurtzite
crystal structure.

Summary and outlook
As the examples described in this chapter have shown, the device characterist-
ics of non- and semipolar laser diodes as well as LEDs have already reached
outstanding levels of performance. High-power non- and semipolar blue laser di-
odes have been realized, and the emission wavelength of semipolar laser diodes
has been extended well into the green spectral range. Despite the short time
since their ﬁrst demonstration, non- and semipolar lasers are already compet-
ing seriously with conventional group-III-nitride laser diodes on (0001) c-plane
GaN. In addition, high-eﬃciency blue, green, yellow, and even red LEDs have
been demonstrated on non- and semipolar GaN. Besides high output power
and external quantum eﬃciencies, these devices show unusual optical proper-
ties, e.g. strong optical polarization of the spontaneous emission, which may be
interesting for applications in LCD displays. Some of these LEDs also show very-
low-eﬃciency droops due to the reduced polarization ﬁeld in non- and semipolar
nitrides. This may enable high-power and high-current-density operation of blue,
green, and white LEDs, which could be a signiﬁcant competitive advantage in
the high-power LED lighting market. Whether non- and semipolar laser diodes
and LEDs will eventually emerge as the winning approach, and if so, which sur-
face orientations will be the best choice, is still open. The decision will depend on
many factors, some of which are not related to the superior physical properties
but are more mundane, such as fabrication cost and device yields. Nevertheless,
this discussion has shown that InGaN light emitters on non- and semipolar
surfaces provide a wide parameter space for advancing the performance of ni-
tride LEDs and lasers—an opportunity that should not be underestimated nor
missed.

GaN-based single-nanowire devices
Rudeesun Songmuang and Eva Monroy
9.1
Introduction
The downscaling of semiconductor devices is a continuous trend in the microelec-
tronics industry. Following this trend, semiconductor nanowires (NWs) become
a powerful and diverse kind of functional nanomaterials for electronics, opto-
electronics, and biotechnology. An attractive feature of these one-dimensional
(1D) nanostructures is the fact that their chemical and physical characteristics
(chemical composition, size, electronic or optical properties) can be rationally
controlled during their synthesis in a predictable manner. Furthermore, NWs
provide an opportunity to combine diﬀerent materials, since their large surface-
to-volume ratio allows misﬁt strain to be elastically released without dislocation
formation, which extends the range of size and band-gap engineering beyond the
limits of planar systems.
This chapter presents a summary of new device concepts incorporating GaN
NWs as active media. The text is structured as follows:
• Nanowire

controlled-by-design GaN-based NW heterostructures and discuss the res-
ultant structural and optical properties.
• Energy conversion: We ﬁrst present a comprehensive study of single GaN
NWs operated as photoconductors—devices which are characterized by giant
photocurrent gain and by a visible rejection of several orders of magnitude.
The potential application of In-containing core-shell structures to photo-
voltaics is also discussed. Finally, we introduce the operation of NWs as
piezoelectric transducers for energy harvesting.
• Nanoelectronics: Progress in the performance of single-NW ﬁeld-eﬀect tran-
sistors (FETs) is discussed. Then, the potential of band-gap engineering via
NW heterostructures for nanoelectronic applications is demonstrated via
their electrical characteristics. For instance, the two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) formed in GaN/AlN/AlGaN NW radial heterostructures can be
operated as a nanoscale high-mobility transistor. On the other hand, AlN
axial-double-barriers inserted in GaN NW can show diﬀerent transport re-
gimes, opening the possibility to realize single electron transistors (SETs) or
resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs), depending on the heterostructure design.
• Sensorics: Due to their chemical robustness and its large surface-to-volume
ratio, the application of GaN NWs as chemical sensors has been proposed.

Nanowire synthesis
A number of growth techniques can be applied to spontaneously synthesize crys-
talline GaN NWs; for example, the reaction of Ga/Ga2O3 mixtures with ﬂowing
NH3 in anodic alumina membranes (Cheng et al. 1999), the arc-discharge in N2
atmosphere (Han et al. 2000) or the direct reaction of Ga and NH3 in the presence
of In power (Chen and Yeh 2000), etc. We can classify the most common pro-
cedures to synthesize GaN NWs into two standard approaches: catalytic-based
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanisms, and catalyst-free growth.
In this section an overview of both approaches for synthesizing GaN NWs as
well as their heterostructures is brieﬂy presented. The electronic properties of
GaN/Al(Ga)N nanostructures in NWs probed by optical characterization is also
discussed.
9.2.1
Catalyst-induced NW growth
Catalyst-induced growth of semiconductor NWs is generally attributed to a VLS
mechanism, which was ﬁrst demonstrated by Wagner and Ellis (1964) in the
Si material system. In this process, metal nanoclusters are heated up above
the eutectic temperature, resulting in the formation of alloy liquid droplets.
The metal/semiconductor phase diagram and/or knowledge of their chemical
reactivity are key criteria for selecting the catalyst. While being fed to the growth
system, the vapor atoms of the growing material become adsorbed at the droplet
surface and are then transferred into the crystal phase via the supersaturation of
the alloy liquid droplets. The NW formation occurs at the interface between the
supersaturated droplets and the substrate because of the faster chemical reaction
and nucleation of the crystal phase at that area. The NW diameter is determined
by the size of the droplet, which is in turn controlled by the original size of the
metallic clusters. Randomly produced catalytic nanoparticles lead to randomly
positioned NWs with a broad range of diameters. The catalytic synthesis of
crystalline GaN NWs can involve metals such as In (Chen et al. 2001), Co (Chen
et al. 2001), Fe (Kuykendall et al. 2003; Duan 2000), Ni (Chen et al. 2001;
Johnson et al. 2002; Lan et al. 2004), Ni/Co (Chen et al. 2001), Fe/Co (Chen
et al. 2001), Au (Kuykendall et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2005; Tang et al. 2008), Au/Pd
(Kuykendall et al. 2003; Nam et al. 2005) or Ta (Shi et al. 2010).
Kuykendall et al. (2003) applied metal-initiated metal–organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) to synthesize VLS-GaN NWs. Tri-methylgallium (TMG)
and NH3 sources were used as Ga and N precursors. A thin ﬁlm of Ni, Fe, or
Au was thermally evaporated onto silicon or c-plane or a-plane sapphire. The
obtained NWs were single crystals for all the used substrates and catalysts (scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

images in Fig. 9.1(a–c)). For NWs grown on Fe-coated sapphire, the predomin-
ant NW growth direction was [110], while Ni-coated or Au-coated sapphire led
to NW growth along the [210] direction, with a triangular cross-section enclosed
by (112), (1–12), and (001) side planes (inset of Fig. 9.1(a)). GaN NWs growing
along the [001] direction were rarely observed.
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a widely selected technique
for the catalytic growth of III-N NWs, there were some eﬀorts to synthesize
VLS-GaN NWs by other growth techniques. There was an attempt to use an
Ni catalyst to induce the formation of GaN NWs on Si substrates by plasma-
assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) (Ch`eze et al. 2010, 2010b). However,
the metal catalyst strongly deteriorates the structural and optical properties in
comparison to catalyst-free NWs grown by the same technique. GaN NWs can
also be grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), but the dissociation of
Ni–Au catalyst during the synthesizing process can terminate the NW growth
(Seryogin et al. 2005).
A key feature of semiconductor NWs is the possibility to adjust electronic
properties by heterostructuring (Lauhon et al. 2002), and to modulate the incor-
poration of n-type and/or p-type dopants (Cui et al. 2000; Duan et al. 2001). In
the case of GaN NWs, electrical studies show that unintentionally-doped NWs
are intrinsically n-type (Huang et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2002). P-type doping has
been demonstrated by introduction of Mg impurities during the CVD process
of Ni-induced GaN NWs on c-plane sapphire (Zhong et al. 2003), using NH3,
Ga, and Mg3N2 as precursors. Such Mg-doped GaN NWs have wurtzite crystal

structure and grow along the ⟨0001⟩direction with an epitaxial relationship with
c-plane sapphire. Evidence of active Mg dopants was obtained from electrical
transport measurements.
Concerning bandstructure engineering in the NWs, heterostructures can
be created either along (axial) or perpendicular (radial or core-shell) to the
growth axis. Based on the nature of CVD or MOCVD growth, most of
the heterostructures synthesized by these techniques are radial heterostruc-
tures. Figure 9.2 presents the schematic and scanning transmission electron

microscopy (STEM) images of core-shell InGaN multiple-quantum-well (MQW)
NWs grown by MOCVD on r-plane sapphire (Qian et al. 2004, 2008). The syn-
thesis principle is the following. First, the NW axial growth is activated by
the VLS mechanism using Ni catalyst, leading to GaN NWs growing along the
[11-20] direction with a triangular cross-section. Then, the growth conditions
must be altered to favor the radial deposition of InGaN MQW on the NW side-
wall surface. The In composition is adjusted by varying the growth temperature.
This growth concept has been applied to implement core/multi-shell NWs with
an n-GaN core and InxGa1−xN/GaN/p-AlGaN/p-GaN shells, to be operated as
nanoscale light-emitting diodes (Qian et al. 2005).
Instead of using external catalysts, one of the constituents of the NW ma-
terial can serve as the VLS catalyst. Self-catalytic behavior was investigated
in situ by real-time TEM while heating a GaN thin-ﬁlm in a vacuum (Stach
et al. 2003). GaN decomposition leads to the formation of isolated liquid Ga
nanoparticles which behave as catalysts for NW growth. Self-catalytic NWs are
also observed by direct reaction of Ga with NH3 (He et al. 2001), direct evap-
oration of GaN powders (Zhou et al. 2003), or heating a mixture of GaN and
In powders (Kim et al. 2010). An advantage of a self-catalytic process is that
undesired contamination from foreign metal catalysts can be avoided.
9.2.2
Catalyst-free NW growth
Several growth techniques can spontaneously provide GaN NWs without a metal
catalyst, which allows a straightforward adaptation of conventional doping and
heterostructure growth approaches. Kim et al. (2002b) reported catalyst-free
GaN NWs deposited on sapphire by low-temperature HVPE. The NW morpho-
logy depends on growth conditions such as growth temperature and time, as
shown in Fig. 9.3. The potential of this technique is supported by the demon-
stration of p- and n-type doping, the growth of dislocation-free InGaN/GaN
MQWs in GaN NWs, and the growth of InGaN alloyed NWs (Kim et al. 2003,
2004, 2004b). Later on, Kuykendall et al. (2007) applied low-temperature HVPE
to tune the In composition of single-crystalline InxGa1−xN NWs over the entire
compositional range.
Alternatively, catalyst-free GaN NWs can also be generated via selective-
growth MOCVD (Deb et al. 2005; Hersee et al. 2006; Bergbauer et al. 2010),
as illustrated in Fig. 9.4(a). Those NWs grow along the ⟨0001⟩wurtzite axis
are enclosed by m-plane sidewalls. To prevent the NW coalescence, Hersee
et al. (2006) applied alternate pulsed ﬂow of TMG and NH3 once the NWs
emerged out of the SiNx hole-mask. In contrast, Bergbauer et al. (2010) showed
that it is possible to keep continuous ﬂow conditions to realize GaN NWs on
SiO2-patterned c-plane sapphire. An important parameter is a well-adjusted
H2/N2 carrier-gas mixture. Increasing the H2 fraction promotes the NW
geometry rather than the formation of pyramid-like structures (Bergbauer
et al. 2010, 2011; Li et al. 2011). As an alternative to lithographically deﬁned

templates, the in situ deposition of a thin SiNx layer on c-sapphire was found to
promote the formation of GaN NWs (Koester et al. 2010). The NW morphology
and structural quality are strongly aﬀected by the duration of the SiNx depos-
ition and the NW nucleation time, while their vertical growth is enhanced by an
additional SiH4 ﬂow. Finally, the crystal polarity of the substrate also plays a
signiﬁcant role on the morphology of the grown nanostructures: GaN NWs with
vertical sidewalls present N polarity (Fig. 9.4(b)) whereas pyramidal-shaped
structures are Ga-polar (Fig. 9.4(c)) (Chen et al. 2010; Li et al. 2011). The
change of shape is attributed to the stability of the diﬀerent crystallographic
planes in the MOCVD atmosphere (Li et al. 2011).
Concerning band-gap engineering of catalyst-free MOCVD-grown c-GaN
NWs, radial InGaN/GaN heterostructures have been fabricated on the m-plane
sidewalls (Koester et al. 2011). The emission wavelength can be controlled by

varying the In content in the MQWs and the quantum-well (QW) thickness.
The absence of piezoelectric ﬁeld due to the non-polar heterostructure nature
has been veriﬁed. However, a limitation of GaN catalyst-free NWs grown by
MOCVD is their relatively large diameter, usually several hundreds of nano-
meters, which hinders eﬃcient elastic strain relaxation in lattice-mismatched
heterostructures. Recently, Chen et al. (2011) suggested a catalyst-free method
to obtain by MOCVD nanoscale GaN wires exhibiting high optical quality. The
approach is to grow GaN NWs on bare c-sapphire using very low precursor
ﬂow while keeping similarly low V/III ratio compared to the standard GaN NW
growth, which favors a reaction-limited growth regime.
On the other hand, PAMBE is known as a standard way to achieve nanometer-
size catalyst-free GaN NWs. The NWs are generally defect-free and grow along
the c-axis of the wurtzite structure. The spontaneous growth of NWs was ini-
tially demonstrated on sapphire (Yoshizawa et al. 1997, 1998) and Si substrates
(S´anchez-Garc´ıa et al. 1998). The GaN NW morphology can be controlled
by technological parameters such as N/III ratio and substrate temperature.
N-rich atmosphere was found to favor the NW geometry, while Ga excess pro-
motes two-dimensional (2D) growth (Calleja et al. 2000; Ristic et al. 2008;
Fern´andez-Garrido et al. 2009). Additionally, high growth temperature is found
to be mandatory, since low-temperature growth activates the formation of

296
GaN-based single-nanowire devices
GaN 2D compact layers even under N-rich conditions (Songmuang et al. 2007;
Fern´andez-Garrido et al. 2009).
The NW shape is very sensitive to the nucleation process. GaN NWs grown
directly on Si(111) substrates are usually not well oriented perpendicular to the
substrate surface, possibly due to the formation of thin SiNx at the early stage of
the deposition (Grandal et al. 2007). The vertical alignment can be drastically
improved by inserting a thin AlN layer prior to the NW growth (Songmuang
et al. 2007). The thickness and the morphology of AlN buﬀer layers signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence GaN NW morphology (Bertness et al. 2007; Sekiguchi et al. 2007; Ristic
et al. 2008; Brubaker et al. 2011).
During the NW nucleation stage, it was suggested that the deposited GaN
initially forms three-dimensional (3D) GaN islands, driven by the strain ac-
commodated inside the ﬁlm (Songmuang et al. 2007; Ristic et al. 2008; Landr´e
et al. 2009; Consonni et al. 2010), and later transform into the wire-like struc-
ture. Consonni et al. (2010) attributed the shape evolution to a drastic change
in the total free energy, mainly caused by the anisotropy of surface energy. After
this ﬁrst stage, GaN NW growth proceeds by two contributions: namely, the
direct material deposition on the NW top and the Ga diﬀusion along the wire
sidewalls up to their apex (Debnath et al. 2007; Calarco et al. 2007; Songmuang
et al. 2007; Ristic et al. 2008). The marker technique based on NW heterostruc-
tures showed that the NW axial growth rate is limited by the supplied N ﬂux,
revealing that the contribution of N adatom diﬀusion is negligible. In addition,
a signiﬁcant contribution of Ga diﬀusion shifts the Ga-limited and N-limited re-
gimes of GaN NWs growth from those in 2D GaN layers (Songmuang et al. 2010).
In contrast, the contribution of Al atom diﬀusion to the NW growth was found
to be insigniﬁcant due to the small diﬀusion length of Al at the NW growth
temperature.
Similar to the case of GaN NWs grown by MOCVD, the polarity of PAMBE-
grown GaN NWs is under debate. Cherns et al. (2008) and Foxon et al. (2009)
reported that the growth of GaN on 5-nm thick AlN on c-sapphire under N-rich
conditions gave defect-free Ga-polar NWs emanating from a compact, highly de-
fective N-polar layer, indicating the polarity-dependent growth rate of the NWs.
They claimed that the preferential growth of Ga-polar NWs is consistent with
the faster growth of Ga-polar inversion domains in a surrounding N-polar matrix
during the growth of continuous GaN layers by MBE under N-rich (Romano and
Myers 1997). Consistently, Brubaker et al. (2011) reported that although the AlN
buﬀer layer shows a mixed crystallographic polarity indicated by piezoresponse
force microscopy and polarity-sensitive etching, convergent beam electron dif-
fraction (CBED) indicates that GaN NWs are Ga-polar. In contrast, Hestroﬀer
et al. (2011) used resonant X-ray diﬀraction and CBED to show that GaN NWs
grown on Si substrate were N-polar, independent of the presence or otherwise
of a thin AlN buﬀer layer. This observed N-polarity agrees with ﬁndings us-
ing aberration-corrected STEM with HAADF imaging and the newly developed
annular bright-ﬁeld imaging (De la Mata et al. 2012; den Hertog et al. 2012).

In order to realize NW-based devices, the control of NW doping is essen-
tial. It was found that unintentionally doped GaN NWs are n-type, with a
carrier concentration that depends on the background doping in the growth
chamber. Adding Si impurities during the NWs growth can further increase the
electron concentration; however, it also modiﬁes the NW morphology. Furtmayr
et al. (2008) suggested that the presence of Si enhances the nucleation on the wire
sidewall, resulting in an increased NW diameter. The presence of Mg impurities
also leads to a continuous increase of the radial growth rate with a simultaneous
reduced axial growth. Mg incorporation to attain p-type conductivity requires
a decrease of the growth temperature, which drastically increases the NW lat-
eral growth. Despite the morphology modiﬁcation induced by adding impurities
during the growth, light-emitting devices based on p-n junctions in NWs were
demonstrated (Kikuchi et al. 2004).
Unlike MOCVD, using PAMBE it is more diﬃcult to synthesize core-shell
heterostructures than axial heterostructures. This fact is attributed to the high
NW density in the range of 1010 cm−3 and to the directionality of the impinging
molecular beams, which results in shadowing eﬀects and non-uniformity of the
shell. Nevertheless, Carnevale et al. (2011) showed that axial or radial GaN/AlN
heterostructures can be achieved by adjusting separately the NW nucleation and
the adatom mobility during the NW growth. Once the nucleation process is con-
cluded, high growth temperature activates the axial heterostructure formation
(Fig. 9.5(a)), while low growth temperature reduces adatom mobility and thus
promotes the formation of coaxial GaN/AlN superlattices (Fig. 9.5(b)).
Pioneer work on axial AlGaN/GaN heterostructures in GaN NWs were
demonstrated by Ristic et al. (2003, 2005, 2005b). However, Al(Ga)N sec-
tions in GaN NWs present a signiﬁcant lateral growth and induce a shell
around the base of the GaN NWs, because of the low Al adatom diﬀusion length
(Carlaco et al. 2007; Songmuang et al. 2010). Furthermore, the diﬀerent kin-
etics of the atomic species leads to a non-uniform chemical distribution in
ternary insertions, whether they are AlGaN (Allah et al. 2012) or InGaN
(Tourbot et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2010). In the case of AlGaN barriers, it
was proposed that the lateral growth-rate depends on the material composi-
tion (Furtmayr et al. 2011). Besides, non-uniform material distribution along
the radius of the AlGaN insertions was observed, suggesting a spontaneous
formation of Al-rich shell around Al-poor core in AlGaN barriers (Songmuang
et al. 2011; Allah et al. 2012), which creates a complex strain distribution in the
nanoinsertions.
The electronic properties of axial GaN/Al(Ga)N nanodisks embedded in
GaN NWs have been deeply investigated by optical studies. The photolumines-
cence (PL) of polar GaN/Al(Ga)N nanodisks in NWs showed signatures of both
quantum conﬁnement and polarization-induced Stark eﬀect (Ristic et al. 2003,
2005b; Renard et al. 2009; Furtmayr et al. 2011; Songmuang et al. 2011).
However, the Stark eﬀect in NW heterostructures is less pronounced than in
QWs due to the particular strain distribution in the nanodisk structures, which

can involve elastic relaxation by the sidewalls and compression by the Al-rich
NW shell.
NWs are also an attractive medium to access the inherent properties of single
nano-objects. Renard et al. (2008) used micro-PL to probe single GaN/AlN
nanodisks embedded in single GaN NWs, showing a PL line width in the
range of 2 meV which is attributed to excitonic transition, as illustrated in
Fig. 9.6(a–b). Photon-correlation measurements provided a proof that the trans-
ition stems from a single discrete level, conﬁrming the quantum dot-like behavior
of the disk (Renard et al. 2009). Rigutti et al. (2010) compared the photolu-
minescence spectrum from individual GaN NWs containing single and multiple
AlxGa1−xN/GaN quantum discs. A single-line spectrum was found from single
nanodisks, while the multiple nanodisks showed multiple peaks with total spec-
tral broadening that depends on the Al content in the barrier. Correlating with
TEM images of the same NWs, the spectral dispersion was attributed to the
strain relaxation in the nanodisk, which is strongly aﬀected by the Al-rich
shell, and to monolayer ﬂuctuations of the nanodisk thickness. The same conclu-
sion was found in the spatially resolved cathodoluminescence of AlN/GaN NW
heterostructures (Zagonel et al. 2011).

Energy conversion
In this section, we ﬁrst present a comprehensive study of single GaN NWs oper-
ated as photoconductors. Then, the application of In-containing NWs structures
to photovoltaics is discussed; ﬁnally, we analyze the performance of GaN and
InN NWs as piezoelectric converters for energy harvesting.
9.3.1
Photoconductive detection
The photodetector capabilities of single NWs are under study for a variety of
materials, such as Si (Zhang et al. 2008; Alvarez et al. 2011), Ge (Kim 2010b),
GaAs (Schricker et al. 2006); ZnO (Soci et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2010b; Peng
et al. 2011), ZnTe (Cao et al. 2011), CdS (Gu and Lauhon 2006), or SnO2
(Hu et al. 2011). Focusing on III-nitrides, a number of publications address the
behavior of single GaN NWs as photoconductors (Calarco et al. 2005; Polenta
et al. 2008; Richter et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2007, 2008; Sanford et al. 2010; Rigutti
et al. 2010b; De Luna Bugallo et al. 2011; Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012, 2012b).
For a correct interpretation of the NW performance, structural parameters
such as growth axis, crystallographic orientation of the sidewalls, NW diameter,
and doping level are particularly relevant. Indeed, the angle between the po-
larization vector and the NW growth axis determines the internal electric ﬁeld
in heterostructured NWs, and the distribution of surface states and Fermi-level

300
GaN-based single-nanowire devices
pinning at the sidewall facets has an impact on the free carrier distribution in
the NWs, due to their large surface-to-volume ratio. In the case of GaN NWs,
surface states induce an upwards band bending at the surface that can result in
a total depletion of the NW. Applying the abrupt depletion approximation to
a cylindrical structure (Luscombe and Frenzen 2002; Dobrokhotov et al. 2006;
Sanford et al. 2010), total depletion occurs for an NW radius
Rc =

4ϵϵ0Φ
e2Nd
where ϵϵ0 are the dielectric constant and the permitivity of vacuum, Φ is the
surface potential (conduction band edge—Fermi level), e is the electron charge,
and Nd is the doping level.
In this section, and unless indicated, we focus on (000-1)-oriented NWs with
{10-10} m-plane sidewall facets, which is the most common crystallographic
conﬁguration for self-assembled NWs grown by PAMBE or MOCVD. For the
fabrication of single-NW devices, NWs are generally detached from their original
substrate and dispersed on SiO2/Si or SiNx plates, and contacted by e-beam
lithography.
Dark current.
Figure 9.7 compares typical current–voltage (I–V ) curves of
single n-i-n and undoped (000-1)-oriented NWs with a diameter of ≈50 nm,

measured in the dark (in the air and in vacuum) and under ultraviolet (UV) illu-
mination (in the air). N-i-n structures consist of two Si-doped n-type edges and
an undoped middle section with a nominal length of 400 nm. Focusing on the
characteristics in the dark, we observe a strong dependence of the dark current on
the measurement atmosphere. Measurements in the air render current levels one
order of magnitude lower than in vacuum (Bertness et al. 2011; Gonz´alez-Posada
et al. 2012b), in agreement with results in CdS NWs (Gu and Lauhon 2006).
In the dark, n-i-n NWs present the I ∝V α (α ≥2) behavior characteristic of
space-charge-limited transport, as expected due to the surface-induced depletion
of the non-intentionally-doped sections.
Space-charge-limited current was ﬁrst studied in insulators, where it is the
dominant mechanism when the charge injected by the electrodes exceeds the
free carrier density in the intrinsic material. In ideal insulators the I −V curve
presents a characteristic I ∝V 2 dependence (Mott–Gurney law) (Rose 1955;
Lampert 1956). However, in low-dimensional materials such as NWs, the presence
of surface states leads to I ∝V α with α > 2 (Gu and Lauhon 2006). In the
literature, space-charge-limited current is observed for undoped GaN NWs with
diameters below 100 nm (Calarco et al. 2005, 2011; Sanford et al. 2010; Gonz´alez-
Posada et al. 2012). Space-charge-limited current has also been reported as the
dominant transport mechanism in undoped CdS (Gu and Lauhon 2006), GaAs
(Schricker et al. 2006), or ZnO (Soci et al. 2010) NWs.
On the other hand, undoped NWs in Fig. 9.7 present current densities at least
two orders of magnitude lower than n-i-n devices. The approximately linear I−V
characteristic is explained by the trap-ﬁlling process characteristic of insulators
prior to the application of the voltage (Lampert 1956). Under illumination, un-
doped NWs display larger on/oﬀcurrent contrast in comparison to n-i-n NWs.
However, the overall photocurrent level in undoped NWs is smaller by at least
one order of magnitude.
Light absorption and polarization.
In general, the coupling of the light into the
NW can be conﬁrmed by analyzing the photoresponse as a function of the po-
larization angle, θ, when exciting with linearly polarized light. The absorption
properties of semiconducting NWs are strongly dependent on the polarization
of the incident radiation. The two major mechanisms responsible for this phe-
nomenon are (i) the modiﬁcation of energy distribution by size quantization
(Peter and Kerry 1990; Xinyuan et al. 2004), and (ii) the dielectric conﬁnement
of the optical electric ﬁeld due to the diﬀerence in the dielectric constants of the
NW, ϵNW , and the environment, ϵenv (Maslow et al. 2006; Ruda and Shik 2005;
Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012). While the former mechanism is signiﬁcant only
in very thin NWs (diameter < 10 nm), the relevance of the latter is dictated by
the ϵNW /ϵenv ratio, though it has to be treated diﬀerently if the NW diameter
is much smaller than the light wavelength. In the case of thin NWs (diameter
< 100 nm), due to the suppression of the perpendicular component of the elec-
tric ﬁeld vector inside the NW, the ratio of the absorption coeﬃcient for light

polarization parallel and perpendicular to the NW axis is given by (Ruda and
Shik 2005)

This theoretical ratio is about 30 for GaN. For thicker NWs the non-uniform
distribution of the ﬁeld inside the NW must also be taken into account, and the
k///k⊥ratio becomes strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength.
The inset in Fig. 9.8 presents the photocurrent from a single NW exposed to
linearly polarized UV light (Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012). The anisotropy of the
optical absorption results in the photocurrent varying as I = I0cos(2θ), where θ
is the light polarization angle with respect to the NW axis (Maslow et al. 2006).
Linearity, gain, and spectral response.
The quantitative analysis of the photore-
sponse requires an assessment of the linearity of the device with the impinging
optical power, P. Figure 9.8 presents the results of the characterization performed
under continuous-wave (CW) illumination, as well as at diﬀerent light-chopping
frequencies. The photocurrent scales sublinearly with P following approximately
a power law I ∝P β with β < 1, though both the photocurrent magnitude and
the value of β depend on the frequency. A sublinear response with the optical
power has been reported in NWs based on other materials, such as Si (Zhang

et al. 2008), Ge (Kim et al. 2010b), ZnO (Soci et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2010b),
SnO2 (Hu et al. 2011), or ZnTe (Cao et al. 2011). This strong non-linearity, also
comparable to observations in GaN 2D photoconductors (Monroy et al. 2003), is
generally associated with high gain, persistent photoconductivity eﬀects, and a
strong photoresponse to excitation below the GaN band gap. The photodetector
gain, G, deﬁned as the number of electrons detected per absorbed photon, can
be estimated from the photocurrent, I, via the equation:
G = I
P
h c
λ e
where h is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the excitation
wavelength. Note that this equation provides an underestimation of G, since
it assumes the detector internal quantum eﬃciency to be unity, i.e. the light
reﬂected or transmitted through the NW is neglected. Taking the NW size into
account, G reaches values of 106−107 for an irradiance of 0.2 mW/cm2.
The magnitude of G can vary as a function of the measuring atmosphere and
the doping proﬁle in the NW. Whereas for n-i-n NWs gain measurements in
vacuum and in the air are in the same range (±5%), for undoped NWs the gain
measured in vacuum can be more than one order of magnitude higher than in
the air. Despite the enhancement of the photocurrent in vacuum, its sublinear
behavior with the optical power remains unchanged, i.e. β remains constant
within an error bar ±5%. A similar enhancement of the photoresponse in vacuum
has been reported in ZnO NWs (Soci et al. 2007).
Figure 9.9 presents the spectral photoresponse of a single GaN NW (n-i-n
or undoped, samples grown by PAMBE) measured by the lock-in technique at
various frequencies. The photocurrent spectra present a ﬂat spectral response
for wavelengths above the GaN band gap (λ < 350 nm), while the response to
λ > 450 nm is below the resolution limit of the system (Gonz´alez-Posada
et al. 2012, 2012b). Similar results are obtained in the case of MOCVD-grown
GaN NWs (De Luna Bugallo et al. 2011). In order to verify the NW blindness
to visible light, they were exposed to 0.5 W/cm2 of the 488 nm line of an Ar
laser. The NWs show no sensitivity to this illumination, neither under CW illu-
mination nor at diﬀerent chopping frequencies (2−100 Hz), which conﬁrms a UV
(350-nm)/visible (488 nm) contrast of more than six orders of magnitude. This
result sets a critical diﬀerence in performance with GaN 2D photoconductors,
whose visible rejection ratio decreases markedly when decreasing the measuring
frequency, to the point of being lower than one decade for CW measurements
(Monroy et al. 2003). This poor visible rejection of GaN 2D photoconductors,
orders-of-magnitude worse than expected from the spectral variation of the GaN
absorption coeﬃcient, is explained by the fact that the photocurrent gain is asso-
ciated with charge separation at extended defects. In the case of GaN NWs, the
huge UV/visible contrast is understood as a result of the absence of extended de-
fects, except for the surface dangling bonds. Furthermore, the NW sidewalls are
{10-10} m-planes, whose dangling bonds do not create occupied states within

the band gap (Van de Walle and Segev 2007). The cutoﬀwavelength can be
shifted into the visible spectral range by incorporating InGaN insertions in the
NW structure (De Luna Bugallo et al. 2011).
Time response.
N-i-n NWs present non-exponential dynamics with an ini-
tial decay constant around 4–10 ms independent of the measuring environment
(Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012). In the case of undoped NWs, their behavior is
similar to n-i-n devices when operated in the air, but persistent photoconductiv-
ity eﬀects in the range of tens to hundreds of seconds are activated under vacuum
(Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012b).
Photodetection mechanism.
Under illumination, we observe a variation of the
NW conductivity Δσ. Keeping in mind that the conductivity is given by σ = enμ,
where n is the carrier density and μ is the carrier mobility, a change in conduct-
ivity, Δσ = e(μΔn + nΔμ), can occur either due to change in the carrier concen-
tration, Δn, or to a change in the carrier mobility, Δμ. The carrier concentration
should scale linearly with the excitation, in contrast with the observed non-linear
behavior of the photocurrent. Moreover, the carrier lifetime measured by PL
in the ns range (Pf¨uller et al. 2010) is in contradiction with the photocurrent
decay times described above (millisecond times for n-i-n NWs and signiﬁcantly
longer for undoped NWs). We can hence conclude that the photodetector re-
sponse is dominated by Δμ, which is aﬀected by the band bending induced

by the surface and by the scattering associated with surface states (Gonz´alez-
Posada et al. 2012b). Thus, the non-linear photocurrent gain in NWs is assigned
to hole-trapping at surface states (Calarco et al. 2005; Soci et al. 2010), which
results in a spatial separation of the electron and hole. When light is switched
oﬀ, photogenerated carriers recombine at a non-exponential rate, due to the
time-dependent potential barrier associated with the surface band bending. The
current recovery involves also a rearrangement of the surface charge, which is at
the origin of the slow photocurrent components. The recombination process is
accelerated in presence of adsorbed oxygen, which decreases the carrier lifetime
(Reshchikov et al. 2009; Foussekis et al. 2009; Pf¨uller et al. 2010).
The diﬀerent response of n-i-n NWs and undoped NWs is assigned to the
diﬀerent location and behavior of the Fermi level at the surface. Surface states
play a major role on the undoped NW photocurrent dynamics due to the un-
pinned Fermi level at the clean m-plane surfaces (Carterm and Stampﬂm 2009;
Bertelli et al. 2009). In the case of n-i-n NWs, the pinning of the Fermi level
close to the conduction band at the n-regions and the reduction of the surface
potential due to residual silicon on the sidewalls reduce the photoinduced sweep
of the Fermi level, preventing persistent eﬀects and reducing the environment
sensitivity. Therefore, an important projection of the present work is that the
doping proﬁle of the NW is a parameter critical for determining not only its
performance as a photodetector, but also its functionalization capabilities for
use as a chemical sensor.
9.3.2
Photovoltaics
Strategies on photovoltaic research today pursue two major targets: reduction of
production costs and increase of conversion eﬃciency (Luque 2011). The former
aim motivates eﬀorts on low-cost materials such as amorphous Si, polycrystalline
Si, CuInSe, CuInGaSe, etc. However, the maximum eﬃciency achieved with
these materials is below 15% because of their high impurity/defect densities,
which reduce the minority carrier diﬀusion length. On the other hand, eﬀorts to
improve the eﬃciency are oriented towards multi-junction architectures using
III–V compounds (GaInP/GaInAs/Ge or GaInP/GaxIn1−xAs/GayIn1−yAs).
These devices attain 30% conversion eﬃciency for commercial modules and
hold the record eﬃciency of 44% for an GaInNAs solar cell under concentrated
light (announced by Solar Junction in October 2012). However, III–V tandem
solar cells are based on Ge or GaAs substrates, both of which are expensive and
limited in size.
The consideration of InGaN as a potential alternative for multi-junction
devices stems from its direct band gap spanning from 0.65 eV to 3.42 eV. An ad-
ditional interest of the InGaN alloy is the naturally obtained alignment between
the conduction band of n-type In0.46Ga0.54N and the valence band of p-type
Si, which might be an advantage for the implementation of InGaN-Si tandem
devices (Hsu and Walukiewicz 2008). Current results on 2D InGaN solar cells

306
GaN-based single-nanowire devices
render values of open circuit voltage, VOC, in the 2–2.4 eV range with a ﬁll factor,
FF, up to 80%, though the solar conversion eﬃciency remains poor (record at
3.4% under AM1.5G at 200 suns and room temperature, Yamamoto et al. 2012).
The low eﬃciency is linked to the growth challenges of In-rich InGaN layers,
which have a tendency to phase separation into In-rich and Ga-rich clusters.
In addition, p-doping of In-rich InGaN must overcome the strong propensity of
InGaN to be unintentionally n-type doped. Currently, this problem is circum-
vented either using p-type GaN (Farrell et al. 2011; Yamamoto et al. 2012) or
an In-graded InGaN p-layer (Yamamoto et al. 2012b)—approaches that are con-
fronted with the generation of defects associated with the large lattice mismatch
between InN and GaN (≈11%).
The NW geometry appears as a promising substitute or complement to the
2D technology thanks to the eﬃcient strain relaxation that is provided by the
free lateral surface. Furthermore, semiconductor NWs allow the independent
optimization of light absorption (light trapping in the NW layer) and car-
rier collection, while reducing the active material volume (Tian et al. 2007).
First realizations of NW solar cells based on dye-sensitized ZnO or TiO2
NWs appeared in 2002, and they were followed by intense research on Si
NWs (Tian et al. 2007; Kempa et al. 2008; Garnett and Yang 2008) and the
ﬁrst demonstrations of III–V NW solar cells (Colombo et al. 2009; Czaban
et al. 2009; Goto et al. 2009). Regarding III-nitride materials, a study of
single III-N NWs operated as photovoltaic devices has been reported by Dong
et al. (2009) using InGaN/GaN core/shell NWs with triangular cross-section (Ni
catalyst, MOCVD growth). Single-NW devices yielded an open-circuit voltage
VOC = 1−2 V, a short-circuit current density JSC = 390 −59 μA/cm2, and a
best ﬁll factor FF = 56%. Their conversion eﬃciency remains ≈0.19% under
AM1.5G conditions due to the relatively low In content. Devices incorporat-
ing GaN NW ensembles on silicon substrates have been demonstrated following
two approaches: GaN p-i-n junction within the NW using silicon as a sup-
port (catalyst-free PAMBE growth) (De Luna Bugallo et al. 2010), and hybrid
n-silicon/p-GaN NW device (Au catalyst, CVD growth) (Tang et al. 2008b). The
former device can be considered as a validation of the technological approach, al-
though the devices are selective UV detectors with a peak zero-bias responsivity
of 90 mA/W at 356 nm wavelength. In the case of hybrid structures, the devices
proﬁt from the broadband photoresponse of the silicon substrate. Cells with
VOC ≈0.95 V , JSC ≈7.6 mA/cm2 and FF = 38% were demonstrated, reaching
a conversion eﬃciency of ≈2.73% under AM1.5G conditions.

Energy harvesting via piezoelectric eﬀects
The capability of piezoelectric materials to convert mechanical energy into
electrical energy can be exploited for the fabrication of nanogenerators or self-
powering nano-devices (Zhang et al. 2011). Piezoelectric NWs are particularly

suitable as electromechanical transducers because of their high length-to-
diameter ratio. The low maturity of the ﬁeld results in numerous technological
choices being investigated in terms of material (PZT, ZnO, CdS, GaN, or InN),
NW shape (cylindrical, hexagonal, conical), and NW dimensions (length between
1 μm and a few tens of microns, diameters between a few tens of nm and a few
microns). Recently, rising attention focuses on wurtzite materials, namely ZnO,

GaN, InN or CdS (Wang and Song 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Su et al. 2007; Lin
et al. 2008; Lu et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010, 2010b; Xu et al. 2011; Zhang
et al. 2011), due to their coupling of semiconducting and piezoelectric proper-
ties, which opens prospects for on-chip integration of energy-conversion structure
and signal-processing electronics or additional sensing capabilities.
A number of piezoelectric measurements on III-nitride NWs have been made.
Huang et al. (2010) bent GaN NWs with an atomic-force microscope (AFM),
using a conductive tip to measure the induced voltages. The samples under
study consisted of three-fold symmetrically distributed GaN NW arrays which
were epitaxially grown on GaN-on-sapphire templates by MOCVD using Ni as
catalyst. These GaN NWs present a triangular cross-section enclosed by (000-1),
(2-1-12) and (-2112) planes, and the angle between the NWs and the substrate
surface is about 62◦. Scanning the tip across the GaN NW array produces an
average piezoelectric output voltage of −20 mV on a 500-MΩ load resistance.
Similar experiments have been performed on ≈1 μm long individual
(000-1)-oriented GaN NWs synthesized catalyst-free by PAMBE on Si(111)
wafers. Su et al. (2007) recorded current peaks of ≈0.03 nA when bending a
single NW, whereas Xu et al. (2011) measured an electric potential of 150 mV for
intrinsic GaN NWs, and as high as 200 mV for n-doped GaN/AlN (8 nm)/GaN
heterostructured NWs.
InN has also been considered as a potential material for nanogenerators. With
this purpose, Huang et al. (2010b) characterized the piezoelectric response of
InN NWs synthesized by a VLS method using Au nanoparticles as catalyst and
ammonia and pure In as precursors, leading to a high density of (1-100)-oriented
NWs. Measurements on 1−3 μm long InN NWs with a diameter of 25−100 nm
render an average output voltage of −120 mV, with some peak output voltages
reaching −1000 mV. The large signal is explained by the non-polar growth axis,
which should theoretically provide a response twenty times larger than the one
expected in NWs with identical geometry grown along [0001] (see Fig. 9.10).

GaN NW ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors
Semiconductor NWs have the potential to become key building blocks for a
variety of electronic devices, including FETs. NW-FETs are interesting both as
a vehicle for investigating basic carrier-transport behavior and as a promising
element for high-performance electronics. NW-FETs have been fabricated from
various semiconductors (Cui et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003; Zheng et al. 2004;
Gretak et al. 2004; Xiang et al. 2006; Dayeh et al. 2007) and with diﬀerent gate
geometries, such as back-gate (Fig. 9.11(a)) or top-gate. Due to their freest-
anding cylindrical shape, all-around gate devices (Bryllert et al. 2006) can be
implemented in NWs, enabling lower oﬀ-state (passive) power consumption in
comparison to planar devices (Auth et al. 1997).

Generally, GaN-based NW-FETs are realized by transferring GaN NWs onto
an oxide-covered heavily-doped Si wafer. At least two metallic contacts are
deﬁned on the NWs in order to create ohmic source and drain electrodes. The
gate voltage can be applied by a fabricated top-gate or using the Si substrate
as a back-gate. Both the carrier nature and the carrier concentration in the NW
channel can be extracted from the FET characteristics (Cui et al. 2000). In a
linear operating regime, the electron density is given by
n =
Qtot
eπr2L
where Qtot is the total charge in the NW, r is the NW radius, and L is the NW
channel length. The total charge is estimated by Qtot = CVth, where C is the
NW capacitance and Vth is the threshold voltage required to deplete the wire.
The capacitance per unit length of the cylindrical-plane geometry is given by
C = 2πϵϵ0L
ln(2h/r)
where h is the thickness of the oxide substrate. Furthermore, the carrier mobility,
μ, can be derived from the transconductance of the NW-FET by the expression
G(Vds) = ∂Isd
∂Vg
= μCVsd
L2
where Isd, Vsd and Vg are the source-to-drain current, the source-to-drain voltage,
and the gate voltage, respectively
Huang et al. (2002) has demonstrated FETs based on individual GaN NWs
synthesized via a laser-assisted catalytic growth method. The studied NWs are
single crystals with wurtzite structure. The NW diameter and length are in

the order of 10 nm and 10 μm, respectively (inset of Fig. 9.11(a)). The gate-
dependent Isd −Vsd characteristics at room temperature shown in Fig. 9.11(b)
conﬁrms that the NWs are n-type, since the device is turned oﬀby applying
a certain negative Vg. Interestingly, these devices exhibit a good switching be-
havior with a transconductance G > 1 μS (inset of Fig. 9.11(b)). The electron
mobility in these GaN NW-FETs is in the range of 150–650 cm2/Vs, with an
electron concentration around 1018−1019 cm−3. This mobility value is substan-
tially larger than those in NW-FETs based on single GaN NWs grown by CVD
(Kim et al. 2002; Stern et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2006), though it is comparable
to values measured in NWs grown by direct reaction of NH3 with ﬂowing gallium
vapor (Motayed et al. 2007, 2008). However, it must be kept in mind that the
measured transconductance is greatly inﬂuenced by the source and drain contact
resistance, and hence the extracted mobility may not reﬂect the true intrinsic
value (Lu and Lieber 2006).
An important issue concerning NW-FET characteristics is the extremely large
NW surface-to-volume ratio, which renders the total channel conductivity espe-
cially sensitive to the surface and hence to the environment. Indeed, attempts
to correlate the electrical performance of GaN NW-FETs with their structural
properties concluded that NWs with smaller diameters exhibit signiﬁcantly lower
mobility than the larger ones (Motayed et al. 2007), which is explained by
the eﬀect of the sidewall scattering on the overall mobility (Sundaram and
Mizel 2004). These surface eﬀects make NW-FET ultrasensitive nanosensors for
detecting a wide range of gases, chemicals, and biomedical species (Patolsky et al.
2007).
9.4.2
GaN NW single-electron transistors
In nanoscale systems, electrical transport is governed mainly by the electron
charging and the quantized energy in a conﬁned structure (Kastner 1992). De
Franceschi et al. (2003) demonstrated that single InP NWs can behave as a
single electron transistor (SET) at a low enough temperature, when the char-
ging energy becomes greater than the thermal energy. However, so far, electrical
investigations of GaN NW-FETs focus mostly on their room-temperature opera-
tion and their transistor characteristics, while the quantum transport phenomena
and their potential for quantum devices remain relatively unexplored.
The signature of single-electron tunneling transport was observed in single
GaN NWs by Kim et al. (2004c). Electrical transport measurements were per-
formed on back-gated NW-FETs based on either lightly or heavily n-type doped
GaN NWs synthesized by a thermal vapor deposition method (Lyu et al. 2003).
The Isd −Vg characteristics at low temperature reveal distinct oscillations in
both types of NWs. This observation is ascribed to a single-electron tunneling
eﬀect, in which the electron charging energy (Ec) is associated with the ad-
dition of one electron to the NW channel. This energy can be obtained from
the relation Ec = e2/C, where C is the capacitance of the NWs described previ-
ously. The irregularity of the observed Isd −Vg oscillations suggests that multiple

conﬁned islands form randomly along the NWs, which might originate from
various defects and/or an inhomogeneous dopant distribution.
Later on, low-temperature electron transport was studied in NW-FETs based
on n-i-n GaN NWs grown by PAMBE (Songmuang et al. 2010b). This growth
technique oﬀers high-purity wurtzite GaN NWs grown along the c axis. In addi-
tion, it is straightforward to control the doping along the wire axis, making the
transport through single high-quality GaN islands possible. This n-i-n GaN NW-
FETs are completely turned oﬀby a certain negative Vg, revealing the n-type
character of the NW channel.
The black trace in Fig. 9.12(a) is Isd −Vsd of a single n-i-n GaN NW-FETs
with a linear characteristic at room temperature, while the grey trace reveals
a non-linear behavior at 4.2 K. The suppression of Isd around zero bias is
a signature of the Coulomb-blockade eﬀect, which becomes dominant at low
temperature. This eﬀect is also visible in the variation of the diﬀerential con-
ductance (∂Isd/∂Vsd) vs. Vg and Vsd, shown in Fig. 9.12(b). The sequence of
diamond-shape dark regions correspond to the values of Vsd −Vg where the trans-
port is entirely suppressed. This trace of single-electron tunneling implies that
the undoped region of the NW conﬁnes a single electronic island, at least for
some gate voltage ranges. Within each Coulomb diamond, the island contains a
well-deﬁned, integer number of electrons. Similar phenomena were reported in
modulation-doped silicon NWs (Hofheinz et al. 2008).
The height of the Coulomb diamonds can provide an estimation value of
Ec, which is around a few meV in this case. The diamond size measured along
the horizontal axis, ΔVg, provides the coupling capacitance to the back gate,
Cg = e/ΔVg ≈3 aF, corresponding to an island length of ≈100 nm. The estim-
ated size is comparable to the extension of the undoped region of the n-i-n GaN
wire. This suggests a relatively low amount of crystal disorder, which leads to
the formation of multiple electronic islands resulting in irregular and overlapping
Coulomb diamonds.

GaN-based single-nanowire devices
9.4.3
GaN/AlN/AlGaN core-shell NW high-electron-mobility transistors
Semiconductor heterostructures conﬁning a 2DEG have served as a key platform
for high-speed electronic applications and fundamental physics studies. In such
heterostructures, the impurity scattering in the conduction channel is suppressed,
which signiﬁcantly improves the carrier mobility and the device performance.
NW radial heterostructures are a promising option to further miniaturize 2DEG
devices. Moreover, the eﬃcient strain relaxation in the NW geometry inhibits
the formation of dislocations, which behave as electron-trapping and scatter-
ing media. The reduced dimensionality, together with the band-gap engineering
potential in NW radial heterostructures, open the possibility to further en-
hance the carrier mobility via the quantum conﬁnement, as shown in InAs/InP
(Jiang et al. 2007) and Si1−xGex/Ge core shell NWs (Xiang et al. 2006;
Nah et al. 2012).
GaN/AlN/AlGaN NW radial heterostructures synthesized by MOCVD via
VLS mechanism using Ni as catalyst (Fig. 9.13(a)) can be operated as high-
performance nanoscale transistors (Li et al. 2006). These NWs grow along the
⟨11-20⟩direction and are enclosed by (0001) and {-110-1} facets. The large in-
ternal electric ﬁeld induced by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization across
the GaN/AlN/AlGaN radial heterojunction leads to the formation of an electron
gas inside the GaN core. The thin epitaxial AlN interlayer between the GaN core
and AlGaN outer shell is used for reducing alloy scattering from the AlGaN shell
and for improving the electron conﬁnement.
To evaluate their electrical characteristic, NW-FETs were fabricated in a
standard back-gate geometry. The measurement of Isd −Vsd as a function of

Vg reveals that the GaN/AlN/AlGaN NW-FET operates in an n-type depletion
mode with a large peak transconductance of 2.4 μS at Vsd = 1 V . This value
is higher than that of a reference undoped GaN NW-FET with the same
diameter (Fig. 9.13(b)). Temperature-dependent measurements show that the
on-state conduction and the transconductance of the GaN/AlGaN/AlN NW-
FETs increase when decreasing the measurement temperature, in contrast to the
behavior observed in Si-doped GaN NW-FETs (Yu et al. 2005) and 2D doped
semiconductors, which show a decrease in the device on-current at low temper-
ature as the charge carriers from the dopants are frozen. These results conﬁrm
the formation of the conﬁned electron gas in radial NW heterostructures.
The intrinsic electron mobility extracted from transconductance measure-
ments with a correction to account for the contact resistance are 2,300 and
21,000 cm2/Vs at room temperature and 5 K, respectively. The mobility at room
temperature is several times higher than that reported in n-type GaN NW-FET
(650 cm2/Vs) (Huang et al. 2002). In addition, the electron mobility was found
to increase drastically as the temperature decreases from room temperature to
100 K, which is attributed to the reduction of phonon scattering (Fig. 9.13(c)).
Below 100 K, the mobility saturates due to the suppression of phonon scattering,
as observed in conventional planar HEMT structures (Skierbiszewski et al. 2005;
Henriksen et al. 2005).
The device performance was signiﬁcantly improved by incorporating a
6-nm-thick high-k ZrO2 gate dielectric and metal top-gate electrodes, result-
ing in on-current and transconductance values of 500 mA/mm and 420 mS/mm,
respectively. An almost-ideal sub-threshold slope of 68 mV per decade and an
on/oﬀcurrent ratio of 107 were obtained for the 1-μm-long device.
9.4.4
GaN/AlN axial-heterostructure resonant tunneling devices
Resonant tunneling diodes (RTD) are unipolar quantum devices which are at-
tractive for terahertz-frequency applications. Oscillators based on RTDs diodes
have recently shown operation frequencies up to 1.1 THz. (Suzuki et al. 2010;
Feiginov et al. 2011). The large and adjustable band oﬀsets of III-N hetero-
structures are a useful feature for the design of devices relying on quantum
conﬁnement and tunneling transport. This unique property is expected to
provide a larger peak-to-valley ratio in resonant tunneling current compared
to other materials. However, the negative diﬀerential resistance (NDR) observed
in GaN/AlN RTDs grown on the polar (0001) face exhibits instabilities and re-
producibility issues (Kikuchi et al. 2002; Golka et al. 2006; Bayram et al. 2010)
stemming from the high dislocation density and the strong polarization-induced
electric ﬁeld. III-Nitride NW heterostructures oﬀer an alternative approach with
an additional degree of freedom for strain relaxation, which not only provides
dislocation-free material, but also attenuates the piezoelectric eﬀects. In fact, the
potential of NW heterostructures for nanoscale RTDs was ﬁrstly demonstrated
in InP/InAs NW heterostructure (Bj¨ork et al. 2002).

314
GaN-based single-nanowire devices
Recently, electron-resonant-tunneling transport was presented in single
defect-free n-i-n GaN NWs containing closely-spaced (4 nm) AlN double barriers
(Songmuang et al. 2010b) grown catalyst-free by PAMBE (Fig. 9.14(a)). The
devices were fabricated with a typical back-gate NW-FET geometry, placing
the double-barrier structure between the source and drain contacts. Their low-
temperature Isd −Vsd characteristics show much stronger non-linearity than
that of a reference single n-i-n GaN NW, with Isd being asymmetrically sup-
pressed over a larger range of Vsd (Fig. 9.14(b)). This pronounced asymmetry
is ascribed to the polarization discontinuities at the GaN/AlN interfaces, which
cause a depletion and an accumulation region at the two sides of the AlN double
barrier.
NDR features appear at both negative and positive bias, and are attributed
to the onset of tunneling via the conﬁned levels between the AlN barriers. As in
conventional RTDs, NDR occurs when a quantized level lines up with the conduc-
tion band of the injecting contact (Sze 1981). The value of Vsd displaying NDR

riers is resolved in the image (white arrows). The sharp contrast observed at
the right facet of the NW (black arrow) corresponds to native gallium oxide.

features can be tuned by adjusting the electrostatic potential via the applied
Vg, in order to shift the resonance energy level (Fig. 9.14(c)). Diﬀering from
AlN/GaN RTDs based on 2D layers, the NDR features in NWs are reproducible
for both bias sweeping directions, and no degradation of the device characteristic
is found after repeated measurements.
Rigutti et al. (2010c) studied the electrical transport through GaN NWs
containing multiple GaN/AlN nanodisks. They found that the GaN shell sur-
rounding GaN/AlN nanodisks signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the device characteristics.
When the GaN shell does not exist, the current ﬂows mainly though the multiple
nanodisks, and a reproducible NDR is observed and attributed to the electron
tunneling through the electronic states available in those nanodisks. On the
contrary, the NDR feature disappears when a GaN shell is present, as the current
ﬂows mainly through the shell close to the lateral surface.
There has been an attempt to take advantage from the suppressed internal
electric ﬁeld of AlN/GaN heterostructures grown on the non-polar orientation
of III-N material by growing the AlN/GaN double barriers on the m-plane
sidewall of a GaN NW by using MBE technique (Carnevale et al. 2012). The
electron transport was measured by using an SEM equipped with nanomanipu-
lators, capable of contacting individual NWs. The NDR found in the ensemble
and individual AlN/GaN core-shell NWs is explained by the resonant tunnel-
ing through the AlN/GaN double barrier. Individual NW measurements show a
negative diﬀerential resistance at room temperature with a peak current density
of 5 × 105 A/cm2.
9.4.5
GaN/AlN axial-heterostructure single-electron transistors
Mastering the electron tunneling transport opens the way towards single-electron
transistors (SETs). These devices have been intensively studied in III-As and
Si (Tarucha et al. 1996; Kouwenhoven 2001; Hanson et al. 2007). In contrast,
there are very few reports on the potential of such devices in III-N materials
(Chou et al. 2005, 2006; Nakaoka et al. 2007). It was ﬁrstly shown that InP/InAs
NW heterostructure can be operated as single-electron transistors (Thelander
et al. 2003), which oﬀers a way to study few-electrons InP/InAs quantum dots
(Bj¨ork et al. 2004, 2005).
The potential of GaN/AlN NW heterostructures for single-electron tunnel-
ing devices was recently demonstrated (Songmuang et al. 2010b). Devices were
fabricated with back-gate geometry using defect-free GaN/AlN double-barrier
NW axial heterostructures grown by PAMBE. An essential requirement for
single-electron transport is a sizeable conduction at small bias voltages, at-
tained by lowering quantized energy levels at or below the Fermi level, EF
(Tarucha et al. 1996). In III-N nanostructures grown along the polar direction,
the polarization-induced triangular shape of the potential proﬁle along the NW
growth axis enables the lowest electron conﬁned level E1 to be below EF simply
by increasing the GaN insertion height (Fig. 9.15(a)). Following this principle,

the distance between AlN double-barrier were designed to be around 6 nm, larger
than the one required for the fabrication of GaN/AlN NW-RTDs.
Figure 9.15(b) shows two Isd −Vsd characteristics at 4.2 K and diﬀerent
gate voltages. The gate-dependent suppression of Isd on a 10-mV range around
zero bias is due to the Coulomb-blockade eﬀect. This is conﬁrmed by the con-
ductance oscillations and by the characteristic diamond-shape features in the
color plot of ∂Isd/∂Vsd(Vg, Vsd) (Fig. 9.15(c)–(d)). The asymmetric shape of the
Coulomb diamonds denotes a diﬀerent capacitive coupling of the GaN island to
the source and the drain leads, ascribed to the polarization-induced asymmetry
of the conduction-band proﬁle. The characteristic size of the Coulomb dia-
monds gives a charging energy Ec ≈10 meV and a gate capacitance Cg ≈0.1 aF,
corresponding to an island size of a few nm, which matches well with the height
of the GaN insertion between the AlN barriers.
The magniﬁed view in Fig. 9.15(e) shows additional structures appearing as
lines (i.e. ∂Isd/∂Vsd peaks) parallel to the diamond edges, ascribed to the onset
of single-electron tunneling through some excited states in the GaN island. Their
presence constitutes direct evidence of a discrete energy spectrum: the motion of

electrons within the dot is quantized not only along the NW axis but also in the
transverse plane due to the ﬁnite NW diameter. From the separation between
the observed excited-state lines and the corresponding diamond edges, the level
separation is in the range of 1−10 meV. Because the NW diameter is an order of
magnitude larger than the GaN quantum-dot height, this energy distance should
be associated to the size quantization in the transverse plane.

Sensorics
In a chemical sensor the active surface area is one of the important factors de-
termining the detection limits or sensitivity. Due to their large surface-to-volume
ratio, NWs are well suited for direct measurement of changes in their optical or
electrical properties (e.g. PL, conductance/resistance, impedance) when exposed
to various analytes. Furthermore, in the case of GaN, its chemical inertness and
capability of operating in extreme environments (high temperatures, presence of
radiation, extreme pH levels) is highly desirable for sensor design.
Chen et al. (2009) and Gonz´alez-Posada et al. (2012b) have reported the
dependence of the conductivity, photocurrent, and photocurrent decay time of
single GaN NWs on the ambient conditions, notably on the presence of oxy-
gen (Chen et al. 2009; Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012b) and hydrogen (Chen
et al. 2009). The results are comparable even if the works describe the perform-
ance of m-oriented CVD-deposited NWs (Chen et al. 2009) and (000-1)-oriented
PAMBE-grown NWs (Gonz´alez-Posada et al. 2012b). An enhancement of the
chemical sensitivity of GaN NWs by insertion of an AlN barrier has been pro-
posed by den Hertog et al. (2012). The photocurrent response of single GaN
NWs to UV illumination in vacuum, air, and pure oxygen at room temperature
are illustrated in Fig. 9.16. As a function of the measuring environment, two ma-
jor diﬀerences are identiﬁed: (i) the average steady-state photocurrent measured
in vacuum is higher than the one in air/oxygen; (ii) the transient photocurrent
shows that the photoresponse in air or oxygen is faster than in vacuum. These
observations are assigned to adsorbate-induced variations of the surface band
bending and carrier lifetime.
Although these eﬀects can ﬁnd applications in the domain of chemical
sensors, the speciﬁcity of the surface/adsorbate interactions is limited. The
idea of functionalizing or decorating the NW surface with metal or metal-oxide
nano-particles or nano-clusters aims at solving this deﬁciency.
Teubert et al. (2011) and Wright et al. (2009) have studied the Pt-
functionalization of GaN NWs for detection of H2, measuring chemically induced
variations of the NW PL or the NW resistance, respectively. With this purpose,
NW samples were coated with a Pt layer of a nominal thickness of 5–7 nm, which
spontaneously arranges forming Pt islands. Figure 9.17 plots the PL response
of GaN NWs with embedded GaN/AlGaN nanodisks to H2 and O2, comparing
bare surfaces and NWs functionalized by deposition of Pt. Hydrogen-induced
dipole ﬁelds can suppress the surface recombination in Pt-coated NWs leading

Fig. 9.17. Transient response of the relative PL intensity from AlGaN nanodisks
inserted in GaN NWs to variations of the gaseous environment (T = 150◦C).
In the presence of hydrogen (H2 concentration of 0.1% in synthetic air) an
increase of the PL intensity for Pt-coated NWs is observed. In contrast, a de-
crease of the PL signal is detected in the presence of oxygen (O2 concentration
of 0.1% in nitrogen) which can be suppressed by Pt coverage. (Reprinted, with

to an enhanced PL intensity in hydrogen-containing atmosphere. For uncoated
NWs, the oxygen-induced enhancement of the surface recombination induces a
reduction in PL intensity.
Regarding the eﬀect on the NW resistance, non-linear relative variations of
≈1.7% and ≈1.9% are obtained when exposing the Pt-coated NWs to 200 ppm
and 2000 ppm of H2 in N2, respectively. Better results are obtained by replacing
Pt with Pd, which results in relative responses of ≈7.4% at 200 ppm and ≈9.1%
at 1500 ppm of H2 in N2 (Lim et al. 2008). More recently, relative responses of
34.1% at 100 ppm H2 were achieved by anealing the Pd-coated GaN to form
Ga2Pd5 nanodots (Kim et al. 2011).
Aluri et al. (2011) demonstrated highly selective and sensitive sensors us-
ing GaN NWs decorated with TiO2 nanoclusters. Hybrid sensor devices were
developed by fabricating two-terminal devices using single GaN NWs followed
by the deposition of TiO2 nanoclusters using RF magnetron and annealing at
700◦C. The catalytic properties of TiO2 enables selective sensing of aromatic
compounds with additional selectivity for methyl group substitution, i.e. these
sensors can distinguish toluene from other aromatic compounds. In the proposed
device the reaction of the analyte is measured as a variation of the photocur-
rent under UV excitation. Thus, a change of photocurrent was observed when
the sensors are exposed to the vapors of aromatic compounds (toluene, ben-
zene, ethylbenzene, and xylene mixed with air), while they had no response to
non-aromatic organic compounds such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, chlo-
roform, acetone, and 1,3-hexadiene. The sensitivity range for the noted aromatic
compounds was from 1% down to 50 ppb at room temperature. The authors

speculate that photoinduced oxygen desorption and subsequent capture of holes
by organic adsorbate molecules on the surface of TiO2 clusters produces a local
gating eﬀect, which is responsible for the sensing action.
By addition of sputtered Pt, single GaN/(TiO2-Pt) NWs become only sens-
itive to methanol, ethanol, and hydrogen, whereas higher carbon-containing
alcohols (n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol) did not produce any sensor re-
sponse (Aluri et al. 2012). Reference single GaN/Pt NWs were only sensitive to
hydrogen, and not to methanol or ethanol. Figure 9.18) shows the comparative
summary of the sensing behavior of GaN/TiO2 NWs, GaN/(TiO2-Pt) NWs and
GaN/Pt NWs to 1000 ppm of various analytes in air. The sensitivity is deﬁned as
the relative variation of the single NW resistance when exposed to the analyte,
i.e. Rgas−Rair/Rair, where Rgas and Rair are the resistances of the sensor in the
presence of the analyte-air mixture and in the presence of air only, respectively
(Rair is replaced by Rnitrogen for H2 sensing experiments).
On the other hand, semiconductor NWs, having a diameter comparable
to biologically-relevant molecules, are interesting nanostructures for biosensing

Fig. 9.18. Comparative sensing behavior of functionalized GaN NWs to
1000 ppm of various analytes in air: light grey bar graphs represent single
GaN/TiO2 NWs, light and dark grey bars represent single GaN/(TiO2-Pt)
NWs, and the dark grey plot represents single GaN/Pt NWs. Other chemicals
which did not produce any response in any one of the sensors are not included
in the plot. The zero line is the baseline response to 20 sccm of air and N2.
The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean sensitivity values
for every chemical computed for ﬁve diﬀerent devices with diameters in the
range of 200–300 nm. (Reprinted with permission from Aluri et al. (2012),

devices (Cui et al. 2001). Recent studies have demonstrated successful application
of GaN NWs as transducers in highly sensitive label-free DNA-sensing, using
cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and PL techniques
(Chen et al. 2009b; Ganguly et al. 2009). The DNA-immobilized GaN NWs
are found to possess distinct Faradaic characteristics compared to the unmod-
iﬁed NWs. Based on these results, Chen et al. (2011b) have demonstrated
label-free identiﬁcation of speciﬁc DNA sequences by connecting a sample of
GaN NWs synthesized on Si by Au-catalyzed CVD to the gate of a com-
mercial n-MOSFET, reaching a detection limit in the level of 10−18 molar,
about six orders of magnitude lower than that of GaN 2D layers in the same
conﬁguration.

Conclusions
In summary, this chapter is an introduction to new device concepts incorporating
GaN NWs as active elements. The NW geometry set the bases for ultimate device
miniaturization, and its large surface-to-volume ratio extends the range of size
and band-gap engineering beyond the limits of planar systems. The development
of new methods to synthesize defect-free III-N NWs with controlled-by-design
chemical and physical characteristics (geometrical dimensions, doping proﬁle,
radial and axial heterostructuring . . .) has enabled the introduction of these
nano-objects in application domains such as energy conversion, nanoelectronics,
optoelectronics, and sensorics. First prototypes of single-NW photoconductors,
In-containing core-shell-NW photovoltaic devices, piezo-electric nanogenerators,
single-NW FETs, SETs, RTDs, and opto-chemical and electro-chemical trans-
ducers, have laid the foundations of a cutting-edge technology with the potential
to revolutionize the semiconductor ﬁeld.

Advanced photonic and nanophotonic
devices
Jean-Yves Duboz
GaN materials are currently reaching a maturity which allows them to be used
for many exploratory fundamental thematics and applications. Among them, ad-
vanced photonic devices are rapidly emerging. This fast progress arises mainly
from the fact that the concepts behind these devices have been explored and
demonstrated with other materials—in particular, GaAs-based heterostructures.
The motivation for copying or extending this research in GaN-based heterostruc-
tures lies in the speciﬁc properties of nitrides (band-gap energies and oﬀsets,
excitonic parameters) which permit demonstration of the same concepts at much
higher temperatures for electrical/optical injection. Hence, these novel devices
have a chance to move from research laboratories to real-life applications. The
operating wavelength also is a major diﬀerence, changing from the near-infrared
for arsenides to the visible/near-UV for nitrides. While many novel devices based
on GaAs are targeting ﬁber-optics communications, novel devices based on GaN
are aiming at other applications, some of them being identiﬁed, for instance in
displays, optical storage, and processing, and some of them still remaining to be
deﬁned. Among these novel devices, I will describe the progress in the ﬁeld of po-
lariton lasers and Bose–Einstein condensation in planar microcavities. Although
nitride cavities still have much smaller Q factors than arsenide or CdTe cavities,
quite comparable results have been obtained thanks to the intrinsic excitonic
features of GaN. I will also describe photonic crystal nanoresonators, where the
results are improving very rapidly, and microdisk resonators. Although quality
factors in these cavities are decades below the state of the art reached in Si
or GaAs, interesting results have already been obtained. Micro- and nanowires,
with axial or whispering gallery modes, will ﬁnally be described. Applications to
devices such as nanowire emitters will be brieﬂy mentioned.

Planar microcavities
10.1.1
Linear regime: basics
A planar microcavity is an active medium with a refractive index nr and a
thickness L in between two planar mirrors, forming a cavity of length Lcav. Note
that Lcav can be larger than L for non metallic mirrors. The optical transmission
spectrum shows resonances for wavelengths equal to 2nrLcav/p, where p is the
order of the mode. Microcavities are designed to operate with small p values so

that the free spectral range (FSR) between the p mode and the next one is large,
and only one longitudinal mode (with energy Ec) will be considered. The width
of the cavity mode Γc is related to the cavity Q factor (Q = Ec/Γc). Q describes
the energy stored in the cavity or the reinforcement (compared to free space) of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. As Q increases, the interaction of the ﬁeld with the
active medium increases and leads to peculiar eﬀects. This is obtained for large
mirror reﬂectivities R. The cavity ﬁnesse deﬁned by
F = FSR
Γc

(10.1)
takes a simple expression F = π/(1 −R) when R approaches unity. The active
medium, a semiconductor, has excited states called excitons corresponding to
correlated electron-hole pairs. The system is out of equilibrium and needs to
be pumped by an external (optical or electrical) excitation. Excitons can relax
and emit a photon at the energy EX. In a cavity the photon will be reﬂected
by mirrors and stay in the cavity for a time equal to ℏ/Γc = Qℏ/Ec, assuming
that the photon energy is close to the cavity mode energy. As Q increases, this
time increases and can be long enough so that the photon is reabsorbed by the
medium before escaping the cavity. In this case, the excitation in the system is
partly a photon (when bouncing back and forth in the cavity) and partly an
electronic excitation (when absorbed in the medium). It is described in terms of
a polariton—a particle that mixes a photon and an exciton. The system is said to
be in the strong coupling regime. The condition for reaching the strong coupling
is that the interaction time (time to emit or to absorb a photon) is shorter than
the photon lifetime (limited by the escape from the cavity through the mirror)
and the exciton lifetime (limited by non-radiative decay). This condition can
also be expressed in terms of energy. If the homogeneous spectral broadening of
the exciton is ΓX, then one can calculate the energy of the two new eigenmodes
resulting from the coupling (of energy Ω) of the photon with the exciton :

When the photon and exciton mode energies are similar, this expression becomes

(10.3)
A splitting between the two modes appears if Ω > 1/2(ΓX −Γc). Slightly diﬀer-
ent expressions of the spliting can be found (Kavokin 2003), and the condition
that is generally used is Ω > ΓX and Γc, or Ω > √ΓX × Γc. This is the strong
coupling regime, characterized by the Rabi energy 2Ω which is the mode-
splitting energy when the photon and exciton mode broadening can be neglected.

(10.4)
For a high-cavity ﬁnesse, Ω2 can be expressed as Fα0LΓXΓc/π, where α0 is the
excitonic absorption coeﬃcient. The strong coupling condition Ω > √ΓX × Γc
becomes α0L > π/F = 1 −R = T. This means that the photon absorption in
the cavity must be larger than the losses due to the mirror transparency, which
is the condition intuitively expressed earlier. As the excitonic absorption coef-
ﬁcient in nitrides in very high, the strong coupling condition is actually not so
diﬃcult to meet in terms of cavity ﬁnesse. With α0 = 5 × 104cm−1 in bulk GaN,
L = 40 nm (this length of interaction takes the ﬁeld distribution into account),
which gives a 0.8 reﬂection coeﬃcient. Let us take R = 0.85. This corresponds to
a ﬁnesse of 20. In a typical microcavity with Bragg mirrors, the cavity length Lcav
is much larger (by a factor 5 to 10) than the active medium thickness L due to a
non-negligible penetration depth of light in the Bragg mirrors. Hence, the typical
mode order p is ranging from 5 to 10. For p = 8, the free spectral range is of the
order of 400 meV. The F = 20 cavity thus has an optical mode broadening of
20 meV and a Q factor of 160. At 300 K the exciton broadening is in the range
of 15–20 meV (Siozade 2000). Hence, the strong coupling regime can be achieved
at room temperature with a modest Q-factor cavity.
10.1.2
Linear regime: results
The ﬁrst observation of strong coupling in GaN was achieved in a modest Q
factor (Q = 60) cavity (Antoine-Vincent 2003) at low temperature and then at
room temperature (Semond 2005). Compared to GaAs, one peculiarity of ni-
trides is that the spin–orbit coupling is small and the three excitons A, B, and C
related to the valence band maxima are close to each other and can couple to the
cavity mode. At low temperature, this leads to a ﬁne polariton structure where
A and B polaritons can be identiﬁed (Sellers 2006a). At room temperature, A, B,
and C excitons are not clearly resolved but still contribute to the coupling, with
an oscillator strength depending on polarization (Butte 2006). It was pointed
out that the oscillator strength is one order of magnitude larger in bulk GaN
than in bulk GaAs. This explains why the strong coupling could be observed
in modest Q-factor cavities in GaN, while the same observation in II-VIs or in
arsenides required larger Q factors (Q = 350 in GaAs QWs (Weisbuch 1992),
Q = 650 in ZnCdSe QWs (Kelkar 1995), Q = 415 in CdTe QWs (LeSiDang
1998)). In addition, the latter achievements in GaAs and II-VIs were based on
QWs, i.e. less material than with a bulk active region. The strong coupling
was also achieved with GaN QWs in a cavity with larger Q values (200–800)
(Feltin 2006; Christmann 2006a). Again, it was pointed out that the oscillator
strength in nitride QWs is ten times larger than in arsenide QWs, explaining

that the strong coupling regime can be obtained in spite of broader exciton
and photon modes. The impact of the inhomogeneous excitonic broadening on
the strong coupling was analysed. The strong coupling condition is related to
the exciton coherence time, and is thus related to the homogeneous broadening.
However, when the inhomogeneous broadening increases, the number of excitons
coupled to the mode decreases (or their eﬀective oscillator strength decreases)
and the strong coupling may disappear. The transition value for the inhomogen-
eous broadening was estimated to be 45 meV, i.e. larger than the Rabi splitting of
30 meV (Christmann 2006a). However, when GaN QWs are replaced by InGaN
QWs, the much larger inhomogeneous broadening prevents any strong coupling
observation, in contradiction to a claim for a strong coupling observation pub-
lished by another group (Tawara 2004). The inhomogeneous broadening of the
cavity mode due in plane ﬂuctuations of the cavity thickness is also a key para-
meter. By reducing the area of the optical analysis the Q factor of the cavity is
signiﬁcantly increased from 200 to 2800 (Christmann 2006b). The nearly optim-
ized cavity was ﬁnally obtained by increasing the number of QWs, leading to a
Rabi splitting of 50 meV at 300 K (Christmann 2008).
Another speciﬁcity of nitride is the fact that they can be grown on various
substrates, still keeping good optical and electrical properties. This has been
demonstrated for LEDs or HEMTs, where high-performance devices have been
fabricated on GaN, sapphire, SiC, and Si substrates. This is in contrast with
arsenides, where homoepitaxy has been the only approach so far for obtaining
device-quality material. The ﬁrst observation of strong coupling was made in
GaN grown on Si (Antoine-Vincent 2003), where the Si acts as a mirror. Latter,
a bottom nitride Bragg mirror with larger reﬂectivity was added (Sellers 2006a).
Cavities were also grown on sapphire. In this case, the bottom Bragg mirror
was AlInN/GaN lattice-matched to GaN (Feltin 2006a), thus yielding both a
high Q factor (a few thousands) and a good active region crystallographic qual-
ity (narrow exciton linewidth) (Feltin 2006b; Christopoulos 2007). Today, the
highest reported Q factor in nitrides is 6400 (Butte 2009a). Cavities have also
been grown on 6H-SiC (Tawara 2004) and on GaN substrates (Lu 2011). While
the top mirror is almost always a dielectric Bragg mirror, various approaches
have been used for the bottom mirror. In addition to epitaxial AlGaN/AlGaN
or AlInN/AlGaN Bragg mirrors already mentioned, dielectric stacks are also
used as bottom Bragg mirrors after substrate removal. This was done ﬁrst for
LEDs on Si in the weak coupling regime (Duboz 2003), and was extended to
cavities in the strong coupling regime (Bejtka 2008). The technological process
takes advantage of the easy removal of the Si substrate. Removing substrates
others than Si is more diﬃcult but has nevertheless been achieved with SiC by
reactive ion etching, leading to a Q = 400 cavity after bottom-mirror deposition
(Tawara 2004), and with sapphire by laser lift-oﬀleading to a Q = 500–1000
after bottom-mirror deposition (Pattison 2007; Song 1999).
Interestingly enough, the technological development achieved in nitride cav-
ities has allowed development of ZnO-based cavities which include an epitaxial

nitride bottom mirror (Medard 2009; Guillet 2011a; Guillet 2011b) and also de-
velopment of perovskite microcavities (Lanty 2011). Table 10.1 shows that the
larger exciton binding energy, associated to a larger oscillator strength, in GaN
(also in ZnO) leads to larger Rabi splitting energies than in smaller band-gap
materials. This chapter does not cover cavities in the weak coupling regime. We
just recall that very early cavities were fabricated in the 1990s for LEDs and op-
tically pumped VCSELs (Redwing 1996; Krestnikov 1999; Someya 1998). While
the main diﬀerences lie in the active region (thickness, homogeneous broaden-
ing), the cavity fabrication is similar for weak and strong coupling regimes, and
high Q cavities have been fabricated by hybrid approaches with a bottom epi-
taxial mirror (Kako 2002) or by a fully dielectric approach involving substrate
removal (Song 2000a; Song 2000b; Martin 2001).
10.1.3
Non-linear regime: basics
In the strong coupling regime, the system can be described in terms of polari-
tons which are composite bosons. While this has no consequence in the linear
regime, it becomes a key factor in the non-linear regime. Cavity polaritons have
a dispersion (energy versus in-plane wave vector) which depends on the detuning
between the bare cavity mode and the exciton mode. In the so-called positive
detuning (the cavity mode energy is larger than the exciton energy, so that un-
coupled modes do not overlap) the anticrossing of coupled modes leads to a lower
polariton branch which is dominated by the exciton dispersion with a shallow
minimum at k = 0. In the negative detuning the lower polariton branch has
a deep minimum at k = 0 dominated by its photon part. In the k = 0 region
where the polariton is dominated by its photon part (in particular in the negative
detuning situation), the polariton mass can be deduced from the optical mode
dispersion to be equal to
mpol = pπℏnr
cLcav
= n2
rh
cλ = n2

(10.5)
where Ephot is the photon energy. For a GaN cavity, this is about 2 × 10−5m0.
Compared to excitons, which have a mass of the order of m0, polaritons have a
much lower mass. It is interesting to compare this with GaAs and CdTe, where

the photon energy is smaller but the refractive index nr is larger, so that the
polariton mass is about the same. Bosons distribute in energy following the
Bose–Einstein statistics:
fBE(E, T, μ) =
1
exp

(E−μ)
kT

−1
(10.6)
where the particle energy E is positive or nul (we take the ground-state energy
equal to zero as a reference) and μ is negative or nul. The chemical potential μ
is given by the fact that the sum of all occupied states should give the number
of particles. The chemical potential increases with the particle density. In 1D or
2D one can show that the sum over all states, except the E = 0 state, diverges
when the chemical potential tends to zero. Hence, one can always ﬁnd a non-
zero value for μ which leads to an arbitrary large density of bosons. However, in
3D, the sum over all states, except the E = 0 state, is convergent, and even for
μ = 0, cannot be larger than a critical density nc. Hence, if the density exceeds
nc, the extra particles n −nc must condense in the E = 0 ground state which
has an inﬁnite occupation for μ = 0. This is the Bose–Einstein condensation in
3D proposed by Bose and Einstein in 1925, and experimentally demonstrated in
1995 in trapped alkali atoms leading to the Nobel Prize in 2001 (Nobel 2001).
In 1D and 2D, the system is not forced to fully condense in the ground state
but will locally condense in droplets, and the system experiences a phase trans-
ition towards a superﬂuid state, refered to as the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition
(Kavokin 2003). It is interesting to note that the size of a droplet can be com-
parable to the size of the real system under study (less than 100 μm), so that
locally the BE condensation and the KT transition are equivalent to each other
(Kavokin 2003). This transition occurs at a ﬁnite temperature, below which a
normal phase and a superﬂuid phase coexist. Although not strictly equivalent,
the Bose–Einstein condensation and the KT transition are similar to each other,
and can be qualitatively described by the same rough and simple consideration.
On the one hand, in the KT transition in 2D at the temperature TKT , the dens-
ity of particles in the superﬂuid phase is given by ns = 2mkTKT
πℏ2
. On the other
hand, the criterion for condensation is that the de Broglie wavelength becomes
comparable to the distance between particles:
λDB =

2πℏ2
mkT = (1/n2D)1/2
(10.7)
Both criteria turn out to be similar, within a factor of 2. Let us emphasize that
this description is very basic. In the high-temperature-high density region, the in-
teractions between bosons, which are an essential ingredient of the KT transition,
play an important role, and a more reﬁned approach is needed (Kavokin 2003).
The important point arising from our basic description is the following. By us-
ing the Bose–Einstein condensation criterion, one immediately observes that the

transition temperature increases as 1/m. Compared to atoms, or even to ex-
citons, polaritons are much lighter and oﬀer a perspective of condensation at
much higher temperatures.
Figure 10.1 shows the phase diagram for GaAs, CdTe, GaN, and ZnO. One
observes that condensation can occur at much higher temperatures in GaN and
ZnO than in GaAs or CdTe. The diagram also shows that the polariton con-
densate can make a transition at high density towards a VCSEL. This happens
because of the composite nature of the polariton, which is not a pure boson, which
induces polariton–polariton interactions. When the distance between polaritons
or excitons becomes comparable to the exciton radius, then the Coulombic in-
teractions can no longer be neglected, and induce a transition from the exciton
gas to an electron-hole plasma (polariton Mott transition). The criterion for the
excitonic Mott transition in 2D can be roughly written as
(nMott)−1/2 = 2 × rexc =
e2
4πϵ0ϵEexc

where ϵ is the static dielectric constant of the material. Equation 10.8 shows that
the transition density increases as E2

dius and exciton Mott density for 2D and 3D systems for various semiconductors.
The phase diagram in Fig. 10.1 shows this transistion as an horizontal line.
Above this transition, excitons and polaritons are broken and the system is
no longer in the strong coupling regime. At high temperature, excitons and

polaritons are broken by the thermal energy when kT > Eexc. The transition
temperature increases as the exciton energy. This phase diagram shows that
GaN, together with ZnO, are ideal candidates for condensation at high temperat-
ure. In addition to thermodynamic consideration, the condensation also depends
on kinetics. Contrary to cold atoms, polaritons are out of equilibrium and must
be created continuously. Before condensing in the ground state, polaritons have
to be created in excited states and then have to relax their energy along the
dispersion curve. The injection is achieved either electrically or, more frequently,
optically. Excitons are created at high energy, relax in the lower polariton branch
(LPB) at large wavevectors by optical phonon emission, and then relax along the
LPB by acoustic phonon emission and other inelastic scattering phenomena. The
energy and wavevector are conserved at each phonon emission. For negative de-
tuning (and even for small positive detuning), the LPB shows a clear minimum at
k = 0 (trap), a ﬂat region at large k, and an inﬂexion region between. Relaxation
along the LPB in the ﬂat region is mediated by acoustic phonons. In the inﬂex-
ion region the slope (>105 m/s) becomes much larger than the sound velocity
(<8000 m/s in GaN (Deger 1998)) and the energy–wavevector conservation can
no longer be veriﬁed. Relaxation by acoustic phonon emission becomes ineﬃcient,
and polaritons accumulate in this region (relaxation bottleneck) (Kavokin 2003).
Other processes such as polariton–polariton and electron–polariton scattering
become the most eﬀective relaxation mechanisms.
While the inﬂexion point in the LPB tends to prevent condensation, it can
become beneﬁcial in other cases. The middle of the inﬂexion region can be seen
as a symetry point between the k = 0 region and the ﬂat region at larger k. Then,
a polariton–polariton scattering between two polaritons sitting in the inﬂexion-
point region can lead to one polariton scattered to k = 0 (ground state) and the
other one scattered to a large k value, with energy and wavevector conservation.
This scattering can be stimulated by the polariton occupancy of the ground
state (boson eﬀect), which can be achieved by sending a weak optical beam
normal to the cavity. As a result, the ground-state occupancy will be increased
and the beam at normal incidence ampliﬁed. This stimulated scattering or para-
metric ampliﬁcation ﬁrst became evident in 2000 in GaAs cavities (Savvidis
2000).

Non-linear regime: results
Although not within the scope of this chapter, we recall some results obtained
in the weak coupling regime. Optically pumped VCSELs have been obtained
in high Q cavities (Someya 1998; Someya 1999; Song 2000a; Kako 2002). The
threshold is clearly observed, and can be expressed either in terms of absorbed
power in the active region (a few kW/cm2) or in terms of electron-hole pair
density (a few 1019 cm−3). The non-linearity of the emission around the threshold
allows measurement of the β factor in the range of 2 × 10−2. Later, current-
injected VCSELs were demonstrated at low temperature (Lu 2008a) and room
temperature (Higuchi 2008; Omae 2009; Lu 2010; Kasahara 2011). The β factor
in an electrical device is reduced to 5 × 10−3, due to electrical contacts, and
the Q factor is in the range of 200 with a bottom epitaxial mirror (Lu 2010).
With a more complex process and a full dielectric cavity, Q can be as high as
3700 (Higuchi 2008). These devices are in the weak coupling regime due to the
reduced number of QWs, and/or the inhomogeneous broadening of the InGaN
QWs, which reduces their eﬀective oscillator strength.
In the strong coupling regime, polariton lasers were devised a long time
ago (Immamoglu 1996). The theory predicted that polariton lasers should be
obtained in GaN at room temperature (Malpuech 2002). It took a few years,
however, before a real breakthrough was achieved. Shortly after the observation
of condensation eﬀects in CdTe at low temperature in 2006 (Kasprzak 2006), po-
lariton lasing was observed at room temperature in GaN (Christopoulos 2007).
The cavity was made of bulk GaN with a bottom AlInN/AlGaN Bragg mirror
and a top dielectric mirror. Figure 10.2 shows the non-linearity of the emis-
sion at threshold, suggesting a β factor of 1.5 × 10−4, which is rather low. The
emission remains at the lower polariton branch energy with a small energy shift
due only to polariton–polariton interactions. The emission becomes very nar-
row (≤1.7 meV) at threshold, consistent with a sudden increase of the temporal

coherence (a temporal coherence of 700 fs has been directly measured in agree-
ment with the emission linewidth) and the massive occupancy of the ground
state. Authors estimate that the ground-state occupancy reaches 10 above
threshold.
The optical pumping power at threshold is 1 mW (or 30 W/cm2), corres-
ponding to an estimated polariton density of 2 × 1018 cm−3. This is one order of
magnitude lower than in VCSELs operating in the weak coupling regime, thus
realizing the hopes for a low threshold (ideally thresholdless) laser. This density
remains smaller than the Mott density for excitons measured by Binet et al.
(Binet 1999), in the range of 3 × 1018 cm−3. As interactions between polaritons
are twice smaller than between excitons, a polariton density of 2 × 1018 cm−3
can clearly be considered to be below the polariton Mott transition. Interestingly,
no relaxation bottleneck was observed, suggesting that the dynamics might be
more favorable at room temperature than at low temperature, which is an addi-
tional advantage of nitrides operating at room temperature. One year after this
breakthrough, the same team observed polariton lasing in a similar cavity but
with GaN quantum wells as the active region (Christmann 2008). The threshold
pumping power density was about 20 W/cm2, comparable to the value with bulk
GaN, and the exciton density less than 1010 cm−2 in each quantum well, which
is two orders of magnitude below the Mott density in a QW (Table 10.2).
Detailed study of the threshold power density as a function of temperature
and detuning emphasised kinetic (dynamics of relaxation along the LPB at low
temperature) or thermodynamic (thermal escape of polaritons from the ground
state at high temperature) dominating eﬀects (Butte 2009b). Optimum detuning
between cavity and exciton modes, i.e. leading to the lowest pumping-power
threshold, moves towards more negative values when the temperature increases
(Levrat 2010). The polarization of the light emitted by the condensate is an
interesting property. In GaAs (Ballili 2007) and CdTe (Kasprzak 2006) quantum-
well cavities, the light is linearly polarized along some crystallographic direction,
due to some residual anisotropy. In the case of a cavity based on bulk GaN, light
emission is found to be polarized (linearly or circularly) within each pulse, but
with a random change from pulse to pulse (Baumberg 2008). Hence, the ground
state appears to be degenerate and a spontaneous symmetry breaking appears
in the condensate, which is considered to be evidence of a BEC. An important
aspect of the condensation is the spatial coherence. In the condensed phase or
condensed droplet, the system should exhibit lateral spatial coherence. In other
words, one should be able to construct interferences between two separate regions
of the emission spot. This has been observed in CdTe (Kasprzak 2006) and GaAs-
based condensates (Wertz 2010; Deng 2007; Ballili 2007), but not yet in GaN
condensates.
Polariton lasing has also been observed in a hybrid system where the ZnO act-
ive region is grown on top of nitride Bragg mirrors (Guillet 2011a; Guillet 2011b).
Although not a pure GaN result, this achievement clearly follows from the devel-
opments made in the ﬁeld of nitride cavities, and deserves to be mentioned here.

340
Advanced photonic and nanophotonic devices
It has been observed that depending on temperature and detuning, the device
can exhibit a laser action either in the weak coupling (VCSEL) (Guillet 2011a)
or in the strong coupling regime (polariton laser) (Guillet 2011b). Polariton las-
ing was claimed at room temperature also in a similar nitride/ZnO cavity by
another group (Lu 2012). But the clearest results in the domain remain within
the French consortium which has obtained the full condensation phase diagram
at room temperature in a ZnO cavity (private 2012). Still in the ﬁeld of hybrid
systems, a quite surprising result has been obtained in a full dielectric cavity
where a GaN nanowire has been inserted in the central region (Das 2011). The
nanowire (60-nm diameter, 750 nm long) was grown by MBE, detached and
deposited on an SiO2 layer on top of an SiO2/TiO2 Bragg mirror. Then SiO2
and a second SiO2/TiO2 Bragg mirror were deposited, leading to a symmet-
ric and full dielectric cavity. The advantage of this structure is to combine a
very-high-quality material (nanowires are almost defect free) and a cavity with
very-high-reﬂectivity DBRs and a small eﬀective length, hence leading to a large
Rabi splitting. As a matter of fact, a Rabi splitting of 48 meV was measured.
The detuning was chosen negative (−20 meV), which is the most favorable case
for condensation at room temperature. When increasing the pump power, a
ﬁrst threshold was observed, and was attributed to polariton lasing, as shown
in Fig. 10.3. The exciton density at threshold is estimated to be in the range
of 2 × 1016 −1 × 1017 cm−3, which is surprisingly low. A second threshold is
observed at much higher (by a factor 2700) power than the ﬁrst one, attrib-
uted to a weak coupling transition and laser operation. Similar observations

(i.e. two consecutive thresholds) had been made previously in GaAs cavities
(Nelsen 2009; Bajoni 2008).
As can be seen from the aforementioned GaN polariton results, progress in
nitrides is following that in GaAs with a couple of years delay. In 2008 a few
groups reported polariton emission under current injection in GaAs cavities at
temperatures from 10 K to 300 K (Khalifa 2008; Bajoni 2008b; Tsintzos 2008;
Tsintzos 2009). From a theoretical point of view, a current-injected polariton
laser should be feasible in nitrides (Solnyshkov 2009). In nitride cavities, how-
ever, electrical injection is more diﬃcult, in particular on the p side. Injection

through epitaxial DBRs is highly challenging, and is impossible for dielectric
DBRs. In these conditions, intracavity contacts are to be preferred, and lead to
good performance VCSELs (Kasahara 2011). A polariton LED has been reported
at room temperature (Lu 2011). The cavity was grown on a GaN substrate, with
an epitaxial nitride DBR, an InGaN/GaN QW-based active region, and a top
dielectric mirror. Intracavity contacts were used in order to inject the current.
Figure 10.4 shows the electroluminescence as a function of temperature, showing
the anticrossing at a temperature close to 300 K. The anticrossing was also evid-
enced by studying the luminescence as a function of angle. An original approach
combining an electrically driven LED and MQW structure inside a cavity has
been described by the EPFL group (Butte 2011). According to a rough estima-
tion, an LED with a realistic eﬃciency is powerful enough to optically pump the
QWs to a level suﬃcient to reach condensation. The experimental demonstration
remains to be done. The current situation is that there has not been any report of
a polariton laser with electrical injection so far. However, given the fast learning
curve in this ﬁeld, it is quite realistic to state that an electrical polariton laser
based on nitrides should be achieved in the coming years. Similarly, one should
be able, in the near future, to create and manipulate polaritons in nitrides as is
done in arsenides (Ferrier 2011; Tosi 2012), with the diﬀerence that it might be
possible to do it at room temperature and under higher densities, opening new
avenues in optics.
10.2
Photonic crystal
Photonic crystals (PCs) were proposed in 1987 by E. Yablonovitch (Yablonovitch
1987) and S. John (John 1987). These pioneers had to face some criticism
(Maddox 1990) for three years before the concept was demonstrated (Ho 1990;
Yablonovitch 1991). The photonic band-gap material is a generalization to 3D
of the grating or of the Bragg mirror. The destructive interference between all
diﬀracted waves can completely forbid the propagation of waves in any direction,
any polarization, and for a given spectral window. Then, the concept has been
enlarged to structures where the propagation is severely aﬀected in many direc-
tions. This is particularly the case for semiconductors where the fabrication of
3D PCs is very challenging, and where most fabricated structures are 2D+1D: in
one direction, the light is conﬁned in a waveguide and the propagation along the
guide is controlled by a 2D grating. In this case, the 2D grating may forbid the
propagation of guided modes but does not forbid the propagation of non-guided
modes. PC can be used mainly in two diﬀerent ways. First, optical modes close
to the band-gap edges present peculiar properties (slow propagation, negative ef-
fective index) which can be used for increasing the interaction with the material
and for special optic eﬀects (super prism, negative lens, invisibility cap . . .). They
can also be used as multidirectional feedback devices to obtain surface emitting
sources (high-power lasers or LEDs). Second, a cavity can be introduced in the
PC leading to a high-Q and small-volume optical resonator. This is the world of

where Q is the cavity quality factor, nr is the refractive index, and Veﬀis the
eﬀective mode volume. The interest in photonic crystal cavities can be immedi-
ately seen from this expression, as the modal volume can be made very small,
in the range of the wavelength in the material, λ/nr. This can be understood
easily in the simplest cavity obtained by altering one period, which is equal to
λ/nr, thus localizing the ﬁeld on such a scale. Many fascinating results were
achieved in such cavities fabricated in a membrane based on silicon or arsenides.
The Purcell eﬀect (observation of a Purcell factor signiﬁcantly larger or smal-
ler than unity) in the weak coupling regime was observed with a single GaAs
quantum dot in a photonic crystal membrane nanocavity (Badolato 2005). The
strong coupling was observed with an arsenide single quantum dot (Yoshie 2004;
Reithmaier 2004). Low-threshold nanolasers based on PCs were demonstrated
with InAs quantum dots (Bordas 2009; Nomura 2009). In terms of pure cavity
performance, Q values in excess of 1 million and volumes close to λ3 have been
reported, mostly in Si-based PC cavities. A good review of best results obtained
in photonic crystals can be found in Sciencewatch (2008). In the nitrides, the ﬁrst
PC was fabricated by Coquillat in 2001 (Coquillat 2001). The main objective was
to exploit resonant (propagating) modes and phase-matching possibilities in or-
der to increase the generation of second harmonics (Coquillat 2004). As a result,
the PC (1D grating in this case) allowed an increase in the second harmonic gen-
eration at 395 nm by a factor of 5000 (Torres 2004). Resonant PC propagating
modes in a thin GaN/sapphire slab were observed, in spite of the mode coupling
with the substrate, showing that PC eﬀects can be observed even in non-ideal
(but easier-to-fabricate) conﬁgurations (Rosenberg 2005). The eﬀect of substrate
coupling on the band gap and band edges was also investigated. While the band
gap is still visible in a transmission experiment in a GaN/sapphire slab, the
coupling with the substrate reduces the transmission contrast (Caro 2008). Still
in the GaN/sapphire system, the most sudied problem has been the extraction
of light by a PC in a light-emitting diode. The starting problem is the internal
reﬂection, which traps the light inside the material and reduces the LED eﬃ-
ciency. Among various solutions, PCs have been proposed to extract the light
(Oder 2004; Wierer 2004; Kim 2005). The extraction improvement remained,
however, limited to a factor of 1.5 to 2. The reasons for this quite disappoint-
ing result were accurately analysed by David (David 2005; David 2006a), who
undoubtedly reported the most sophisticated study of light extraction by PCs
in LEDs. The ﬁrst problem is the distance between the emitting QWs and the
PC. It has to be short to maximize the coupling. However, electrical injection

344
Advanced photonic and nanophotonic devices
prevents excessive reduction of this distance. Hence, results obtained by photo-
luminescence cannot be directly transfered to LEDs. Another point to mention
about photoluminescence is that it is often measured in conditions where the
internal quantum eﬃciency is high, which increases the extraction. Actually,
any photon-recycling scheme gives an extraction eﬃciency of unity in a mater-
ial where the internal quantum eﬃciency is unity. In an LED, some internal
losses due to contacts, doped layers, and non-radiative recombination cannot
be supressed. Second, the PC extraction must be omnidirectional, as the light
emission is omnidirectional in the QWs. Square PC and even triangular PC
are not ommidirectional. Hence, David has proposed (David 2006b) the use of
Archimedean tilings which combine triangular and square lattices in the PC. The
principle is to increase the number of equivalent points in the reciprocal lattice
which extract the light (i.e. lead after diﬀraction to a wavevector in the extrac-
tion air cone). The Archimedean PC allows an increase of this number to 12,
compared to 6 in the triangular lattice, and is more eﬃcient than the triangular
PC in GaN/air slabs. Unfortunately, for air/GaN/sapphire slabs, this no longer
holds. This is the reason why LEDs with a removed substrate and a PC etched
in the n:GaN layer were proposed and fabricated (David 2006c; Cho 2008), with,
however, a performance strongly limited by light absorption on metal contacts
(David 2006c). Another alternative is to embed the PC in the structure with a
regrowth process (David 2008; Matioli 2009). This yields a better extraction of
all guided modes (Matioli 2010), leading to an extraction eﬃciency in the range
of 0.5–0.6.
Although impressive, similar or even larger extraction eﬃciencies are obtained
by less sophisticated approaches. A detailed analysis was made by Wiesmann
(Wiesmann 2009). The extraction eﬃciency of an optimized PC can reach 0.7,
which is the same value as the one reached with a rough surface. A simple ex-
planation is that an optimized PC should provide extraction omnidirectionality,
which the rough surface does also. In the Fourier domain the rough surface
has a larger number of components than the PC, each of them having a smal-
ler amplitude, ﬁnally resulting in a comparable eﬃciency (Wiesmann 2009).
Directionality might actually be a clearer bonus of PC LEDs for applications
where the brilliance is an issue (Wiesmann 2009). A half-intensity emission angle
of 17◦is obtained with a PC and a very thin GaN LED structure (Lai 2010),
while the corresponding angle in a Lambertian source would be 60◦. Such PCs
can be used to fabricate surface-emitting lasers if the material is pumped at
high intensity and has some gain. The stimulated emission can then be observed
(Chang 2006). However, in the absence of vertical conﬁnement the stimulated
emission hardly leads to laser operation. The vertical feedback was provided by
a Bragg reﬂector grown below the active region, while the PC was etched on
the top surface (Lu 2008b). The feedback can be undestood as follows. In the
plane of the layer the light is diﬀracted for some resonant modes of the PC. For
these modes, the ﬁeld intensity is reinforced and the modal gain is larger. As the
diﬀraction k vector in the plane is comparable to the light k vector, the light is

diﬀracted perpendicular to the surface, upwards or downwards. The bottom mir-
ror redirects all the light towards the top surface. A clear laser action has been
demonstrated, as shown in Fig. 10.5, with a linewidth of 0.1 nm above threshold
(Lu 2008a). By varying the PC period, and keeping the same hole/period ra-
tio, one observes that the lasing wavelength does not vary as the period, as one
could naively expect. This is due to the fact that the gain in InGaN QWs is not
spectrally broad enough. Hence, the system chooses the PC resonant mode that
has the best spectral overlap with the gain spectrum. As shown in Fig. 10.6, the
lasing wavelengths for various PC periods correspond to diﬀerent PC modes, Γ,
M, and K.
Another interesting feature in this laser is the polarization. As shown in
Fig. 10.7, the polarization of each laser operating at a given PC mode is given
by the symmetry of the mode. Due to the six-fold symmetry of the PC, one
could expect that the resultant polarization is nul. However, imperfections in
the PC are suﬃcient to break the symmetry, and the system chooses one of the
six possible directions and the laser emission is thus polarized (Lu 2008c). Such
a structure obviously does not provide rigorous control of spontaneous emission
(many modes in the plane, and even more out of the plane), and thus leads to a
modest, but not so small, β factor of 5 × 10−3, smaller by a factor of 2 than in
a VCSEL, but larger than in a ridge laser by a factor of 100.
While the PC etched on the top surface can be used for optically pumped
lasers, it induces injection problems for electrical lasers. An alternative, as for
LEDs (David 2008; Matioli 2009; Matioli 2010), is to embed the PC in the
structure (Matsubara 2008), as shown in Fig. 10.8. Below threshold, the mode
dispersion can be measured by angle-resolved luminescence. The resonant edge
modes are observed as shown in Fig. 10.9. In the Γ region, the detail of the band

structure is nicely resolved. Above threshold, only one mode is lasing, at almost
normal angle and with a small divergence of 1◦.
As already explained, the second thematic area for PCs is the world of
nanophotonics. Nanocavities have been fabricated in GaN with 2D PCs in a
membrane. In the ﬁrst report by UCSB (Choi 2005; Meier 2006), the mem-
brane was fabricated by a selective photoelectrochemical etching of a sacriﬁcial
InGaN layer underneath the GaN layer. The resultant Q factors were a modest
300 in an H2 circular cavity (7 missing holes) and 800 for an L7 linear cavity
(seven missing holes in the Γ-K direction), at wavelengths in the 460–480 nm
range. Random structural defects and surface roughness were believed to be lim-
iting factors. The main diﬃculty in this process was the membrane fabrication.
Alternative approaches are based on substrate removal. While sapphire is diﬃ-
cult to remove and requires a laser lift-oﬀprocess, SiC can be etched chemically,
or more precisely, photoelectrochemically. Such a nanocavity has been fabricated
(Arita 2007). A Q factor of 2400 has been achieved in an L7 cavity at room tem-
perature and at a wavelength of 382 nm. More recently, the same group was able
to reach Q values above 5000 at 380 nm in a nanobeam PC (tapered array of
holes in a narrow ridge) (Sergent 2012a), and even above 6300 (current record
value) with a layer transfer process (Sergent 2012b).
Silicon being by far the easiest substrate to process and to remove, a quite ob-
vious way to produce GaN membranes is to grow nitrides on Si substrates. This
approach has been pioneered by CRHEA-CNRS since 2007. The ﬁrst problem to
solve was to produce eﬃcient emitters in a thin GaN layer. Indeed, the membrane
needs to be thin in order to support a small number of guided modes (ideally

the membrane must be λ/2nr thick to be single mode, i.e. typically 83 nm for
a wavelength of 400 nm and a refractive index of 2.4). Then the diﬃculty is to
achieve a high crystallographic quality in such a thin layer grown by heteroep-
itaxy with a large lattice-mismatch and a resultant large dislocation density.
QWs grown in such conditions have a poor radiative eﬃciency, in particular at
room temperature. Using quantum dots can be a solution, as the 3D conﬁnement
leads to a smaller sensitivity of recombination to the defects, as was demonstrated
with eﬃcient GaN/AlGaN QDs at room temperature (Sergent 2009). The second
issue, which was initially thought to be a problem, was the diﬃculty in etching
GaN with a process that could respect the hole diameter and give smooth and
vertical etched surfaces so as to maximize the Q value. For this reason, an ori-
ginal approach was followed. The PC was ﬁrst etched in Si, beneﬁting from the
mature Si process, and the GaN layer was grown on the Si PC by conformal
epitaxy. The Si was ﬁnally underetched through the holes or through additional
larger apertures, leading to a thin AlN membrane with GaN QDs. The photolu-
minescence at room temperature revealed a Q factor of 1800 at 425 nm in an L3
cavity (Neel 2011). Although appealing, this approach turned out to suﬀer from
problems such as parasitic epitaxy in the holes, and could not reach larger Q
values. A more classical approach was then used. The GaN was grown ﬁrst, and
then the PC was fabricated. Progress in ICP etching has led to the production
of high-quality structure, with smooth sidewalls, and Q values as high as 4800
were recently achieved in Notomi cavities (SamGiao 2012). Other groups such as
EPFL have also followed this approach, obtaining a Q value of 5200 at 420 nm
in an L7 cavity (Vico Trivino 2012). This remains quite far from record values
obtained in GaAs or in Si. However, such cavities proved to be good enough
for showing laser eﬀects. A ﬁrst report was based on cavities (H1,H2,H3) in a
triangular PC etched in bulk GaN (Lai 2007). The vertical emission showed a
single line for the small H1 cavity but many lines for larger H2 and H3 cavi-
tites, suggesting the presence of diﬀerent transverse modes in the cavities. The

second report related to a PC membrane laser. The structure (Lin 2011) was
copied from the ﬁrst UCSB structure. The GaN membrane was fabricated by
photoelectrochemical etching of a sacriﬁcial InGaN layer. Various cavities were
fabricated (H1, H2, L3), and also resonant band-edge modes have been used.
The laser eﬀect was demonstrated at room temperature by optical pumping, as
shown in Fig. 10.10. From the position of the lasing peak, it remains diﬃcult to
clearly assign the emission to cavity modes or to band-edge modes. The emission
is clearly polarized even for H1 and H2 cavities, where a net polarization is not
expected due to the six-fold sysmmetry. Obviously, the symmetry is broken by
some imperfections and the light is emitted with a preferential polarization, and
the polarization ratio can reach 25.

Microdisks
Microdisks are optical resonators, with lateral dimensions in the micron range
(or a few microns) and a vertical light conﬁnement in the range of the wavelength
in the material. They were ﬁrst studied in the early 1990s in the context of semi-
conductor lasers (McCall 1992). The light conﬁnement is due to total internal
reﬂection at the semiconductor/air interface. Optical modes are travelling around
the periphery of the disk, and the resonance condition deﬁning the modes can
be simply expressed as 2πRneﬀ= mλ, where neﬀis the eﬀective optical index
taking into account the vertical conﬁnement of the light. This formula based
on geometrical optics assumes that the light is following the disk periphery very
closely. In reality, the photon modes have a non-zero lateral extension and are not
restricted to the disk periphery. In addition, some modes can be reﬂected further

inside the disk. This can be described accurately by the Maxwell equations and
the Bessel functions in cylindrical coordinates. The resultant whispering gallery
modes can be described by two numbers: the azimuthal m number describing the
number of periods of the electromagnetic ﬁeld amplitude along the periphery, as
in the simpliﬁed formula (the ﬁeld intensity having 2m maxima or minima), and
the radial number n giving the number of intensity maxima along the radius.
Modes with n = 1 correspond to modes close to the periphery, while modes with
larger n numbers are located closer to the disk center. Taking into account the
light polarization TM ( ⃗B perpendicular to the disk) or TE, modes are described
by TMm,n and TEm,n. A common approximation is to take a ﬁeld equal to zero
at the disk periphery (similar to the inﬁnite-well approximation for an electron
in a quantum well). However, the ﬁeld is not nul at the interface, and there is
an evanescent ﬁeld extending outside the disk. In a cylindrical geometry one can
show that there is some energy leaking outside the disk, which limits the Q value.
A rough estimate of Q can be taken as (McCall 1992; Slusher 1993):
Q = 1

eﬀ. The vertical light conﬁnement in
nitride microdisks gives typical values of 1.75 for neﬀ, leading to x = 0.82 and
J = 0.33. Hence, the radiation-limited Q value varies in nitride disks as
Qrad ≈1
7e0.66m ≈1
7e0.66×2πRneﬀ/λ
(10.11)
At a wavelength of 350 nm, it varies as 1
7e20×R, with the radius R expressed
in microns. We immediately observe that the radiation-limited Q value is very
large, showing that radiation is not the limiting factor. Unfortunately, it also
shows that perfect microdisks are very poor emitters. In addition, the energy is
emitted in a continuum around the disk and not easy to collect. The residual ab-
sorption also introduces a limit for Q. One can relate the energy broadening
δE (Qα = E/δE) to the photon lifetime (δE = ℏ/τ), and relate the photon
lifetime to the absorption α by (c/neﬀ× τ × α = 1), and one easily ﬁnds Qα:
Qα = 2πneﬀ
αλ
(10.12)
Assuming a residual absorption coeﬃcient 1000 times lower than the band-edge
value, which is quite easy to achieve in a good-quality material (α = 50 cm−1),
one obtains Qα = 6200 at 350 nm. This shows that residual absorption can
be a limiting factor in particular in large disks where other limiting mechan-
isms are negligible. The scattering by surface roughness is the third limitation

for the Q value. The Rayleigh scattered energy varies as λ−4, so that Qss varies
as λ3. A detailed calculation (Borselli 2005) leads to the following expression:
Qss =

(10.13)
where we have assumed that the surrounding medium is air, and nr is the
material index, h is the disk thickness, Lc is the correlation distance of the
roughness, and σ is the roughness amplitude. Qss decreases as the square of
the roughness, and decreases when the index contrast increases. In this respect,
nitrides can take advantage of a smaller index contrast than smaller band-gap
materials.
The modal eﬀective volume can be made quite small. This is not as intuitive
as in the case of photonic crystal cavitites, but whispering-gallery modes (modes
with n = 1) have eﬀective volumes calculated by
Veﬀ=

(10.14)
and found to be in the range of a few (λ/nr)3 (Srinivasan 2006). ϵ is the dielec-
tric function at optical frequencies, equal to the square of the optical index.
The modal volume is found to decrease almost linearly with the disk diameter.
However, for small disks, Q becomes radiation-limited and the Q/Veﬀratio
strongly decreases with the decreasing diameters. For large disks, Q is limited
by other mechanisms such as residual absorption, and Q/Veﬀdecreases with in-
creasing diameters. As a result, the largest ratio is found for diameters of a few
microns, where Q can reach 105 and the eﬀective volume is about 2(λ/nr)3.
One severe drawback of microdisks is the radiation pattern, which is isotropic
in the plane of the disk. Hence, eﬃciently collecting the emitted light is chal-
lenging. A solution can be to couple the disk with a linear waveguide or a ﬁber
taper. Another solution can be to deform the disk slightly from the circular geo-
metry and introduce preferred radiation directions. The typical localization of
the light in the disk and exit angle of the light from the disk may depend strongly
on the disk deformation in these so-called chaotic resonators (Gmachl 1998). A
defect can also be introduced in the disk, leading to preferential localizations
and exit angles for the light. All these approaches must trade oﬀthe Q value for
the directionality.
The ﬁrst results in microdisks were obtained in GaAs during the 1995–2005
period with InAs QD emitters, and included lasers, then the observation of the
Purcell eﬀect, and then of the strong coupling regime (see references in Srinivasan
(2006)). In nitrides, ﬁrst whispering-gallery modes were observed in 1998 (Mair
1998) in thin layers grown on sapphire and large disks (9 μm diameter).
Whispering-gallery modes were observed also in 2 μm thick GaN layers (not
single mode in the vertical direction) and very large disks (25−750 μm diamet-
ers) (Chang 1999). Observed modes were high-order radial modes (not circulating

at the disk periphery) which could be brought to lasing at 365 nm by optical
pumping. The directionality issue was adressed in a spiral-shaped disk or pillar
of large size (500 μm diameter) (Chern 2003). The diameter increases slightly
counter-clockwise (CCW) and abruptly returns to its initial value at the notch
position. This reduces the Q factor in particular for mode-propagating CCW,
but leads to an increased emission at the notch position and along a certain dir-
ection. Results on more sophisticated microdisks (small diameter, vertical single
mode) were obtained in 2004 at UCSB, with an optically pumped microdisk
laser emitting at 415 nm (Haberer 2004). The disk was obtained by selective
photo-electro-chemical etching of an InGaN sacriﬁcial layer, and the emitting
region was made of InGaN QWs. Lasing was observed at 10 K with a large
threshold power density (a few MW/cm2) on 4 μm diameter disks. The device
was largely improved later, and CW lasing was observed in 2006 at room temper-
ature with a threshold power density as low as 300 W/cm2 (Tamboli 2007). One
additional reason for such a low threshold is the small diameter (1.2 μm) and the
reduced number of modes overlapping with the gain region. A similar approch
based on selective etching of nitrides was demonstrated with AlInN as a sacriﬁ-
cial layer (Simeonov 2008). Room-temperature lasing was achieved from 409 to
475 nm with a threshold power density of 166 kW/cm2 in microdisks with a dia-
meter of 3−5 μm. These microdisks have Q factors of up to 3500, limited by the
QW absorption. The absorption due to the emitting medium is a key issue. While
the residual absorption can be made negligible in a cold cavity (without emitter),
it is inherent in cavities with emitters and can limit the Q factor. A good solution
to minimize it is to use an active medium with a large Stokes shift, i.e. absorbing
at higher energy than the emission energy: in other words, reducing the density
of states at the emission energy. The use of quantum dots is obviously a good
solution, as will be shown later in this section. In InGaN quantum wells, localiz-
ation due to lateral variations of In content and/or of thickness (in particular, in
the presence of an internal ﬁeld) leads to a situation quite similar to the QD case.
This has been beautifully shown by the UCSB team. While the microdisks fabric-
ated on polar material (leading to the low-threshold laser mentioned above) have
typical Q factors of 4000, similar disks fabricated on non-polar material have Q
factors of 1500–2000, limited by absorption in InGaN QWs, where the Stark
eﬀect is absent and the Stokes shift is small (Tamboli 2009). As for photonic
crystals, the under-etching of Si can be exploited to fabricate microdisks. The
ﬁrst report concerned a simple GaN on Si (Choi 2006), and lasing was observed
at 365 nm at 4 K on 20 μm-diameter disks. The main problem when growing the
active region directly on Si is the crystal quality. Indeed, the layer has to be thin
(about λ/2), and it is very challenging to reduce the dislocation density in such
a thin layer grown on a highly mismatched substrate. This is a ﬁrst motivation
to use quantum-dot emitters, as the 3D conﬁnement makes them less sensitive
to defects. The second motivation is to reduce the density of states, as already
explained. This approach has been pionnered by CRHEA, and intense emission
has been observed in QDs inserted in very thin AlN and AlGaN layers grown on

been used to measure Q factors as large as 7300 at a wavelength of about 400
nm for n = 1 modes (propagating at the periphery of the disk) in 5 μm disks,
as shown in Fig. 10.11 (Mexis 2011). The Q value is smaller for n = 2 modes
(propagating closer to the center) due to the absorption in the central post. Q
is found to be smaller when the AlN layer is replaced by AlGaN layer due to
residual absorption. Finally, Q values are smaller in 2 μm diameter disks than
in 5 μm disks, as the modes overlap more with the post, both for n = 1 and
n = 2, as shown in Fig. 10.12 (Mexis 2011). The mode volumes, in units of

60 and 30 for the 2-μm and 5-μm disks respectively. The eﬀect is thus large, and
should be observable, but has not been observed so far experimentally. Reasons
for that are the homogeneous broadening at 300 K that reduces the eﬀective
Purcell eﬀect, and the dominating non-radiative recombination which masks the
eﬀect in time-resolved PL measurements.

Nanowires
Nanowires for cavity quantum electrodynamics have been developed in arsen-
ides ﬁrst, where a Purcell factor of 5 has been measured in a 1 μm diameter
pillar (Gerard 1998), corresponding to a coupling coeﬃcient β in the vertical
mode of the pillar of 0.9. Compared to planar cavities where β is in the range
of 10−2, micropillars emit photons more eﬃciently in a given (vertical) mode,
which is a key issue for single photon sources, for the generation of squeezed
states of light, and in particular for quantum cryptography. A few years later a
clear photon antibunching (g(2)(0) = 0.18) was measured in a micropillar coupled
(in the strong coupling regime) to a single InGaAs quantum dot (Press 2007).
This single-photon source has a Purcell factor of 61 and a β factor of 0.97 (we
note that the QD linewidth is much narrower at low temperature than the cavity
mode, so that the spectral overlap is unity). The Q factor reaches 20 000, but
the pillar diameter is quite large (1.8 μm), so that the mode volume is not that
small (in the range of 18 in reduced units). GaAs/AlGaAs nanowires also allowed
observation of 0D polariton lasing (Bajoni 2008).
Nanowires have also been developed in nitrides for many applications and
with diameters ranging from a few tens of nm to above 1 μm (microwires).
Given the nanometric size and the general problem of crystallographic quality
in GaN, the bottom-up approach (direct growth of wires) has been the preferred
option (instead of processing planar layers as in arsenides). Indeed, this approach
allows the eradication of strain problems and related dislocations which arise in
heteroepitaxy of nitrides on foreign substrates. Plasma molecular beam epitaxy
turned out to be the ideal tool for growing nanowires. The ﬁrst nanowires were
obtained in 1997 on sapphire at Sophia University in Tokyo (Yoshizawa 1997),
with diameters in the range of 50–100 nm. Similar nanowires were obtained by
the ISOM group in Madrid on sapphire and Si (111) (Calleja 2000). AlGaN
nanowires were also grown (Al content of 0.20–0.30, diameter of 30 nm), with
inserted GaN disks (Ristic 2003), with properties only slightly diﬀerent from
quantum-well properties due to surface potential and lateral variation of strain
(Ristic 2005a). We will not discuss the details of growth of these nanowires, but
focus on optical resonators. Nanocavities were obtained by the Madrid group
(Ristic 2005b) with GaN nanodisks inserted between GaN/AlGaN Bragg mirrors.
The optical properties, however, did not exhibit any particular feature, showing
that these structures remain far from being optimized. In particular, in these
small-diameter columns (20–60 nm), the optical modes largely extend laterally in

air, so that a more accurate calculation would be needed for all layer thicknesses
in order to match the cavity and exciton energies.
The Sophia University group has fabricated nanoLEDs based on nanowires
grown by plasma MBE (Kikuchi 2004; Kishino 2012). The CEA-CNRS group in
Grenoble also developed plasma MBE nanowires (Landre 2009). Their interest
in terms of extraction eﬃciency in LEDs has been discussed (Henneghien 2011).
As LEDs and lighting are not the scope of this chapter, these issues will not be
discussed here. A review can be found elsewhere (Li 2012).
Accurately positioning the nanocolumns turns out to be crucial for many
applications, and many approaches have been sucessfully proposed (Hersee 2006,
Sekiguchi 2008), but have not led to improved optical nanoresonators.
Other methods, such as the VLS growth with a Ni catalyst, have been used
to produce GaN nanowires with a diameter of 30–150 nm and a length of several
hundreds of micrometers (Johnson 2002). This very large length/diameter ratio
(typically 100) favors the stimulated emission of axial modes, while whispering-
gallery modes suﬀer from high radiation losses. Hence, stimulated emission was
observed in a L = 16 μm long wire, with a mode spacing of 1.7 nm consistent with
the expected value
λ2
2nrL. The cavity ﬁnesse (1.4) is low, as the facet reﬂectivity
is low, and the optical mode linewidth is comparable to the free spectral range,
leading to barely visible modes. However, the Q value reaches 100–1000 as the
cavity is very long, and lasing emission could be observed (Johnson 2002). The
threshold pump power is, however, quite high, with an electron-hole pair density
above the exciton Mott transition (Binet 1999). Nanowires were also fabricated
by MOCVD in the group of C. Lieber (Zhong 2003; Qian 2004; Qian 2005). Non-
polar nanowires with a triangular section have been obtained (Gradeˇcak 2005),
with typical dimensions similar to those grown by VLS. Again, axial Fabry–Perot
modes were observed, and laser action was observed under optical pumping. The
improvement in overall quality (material, roughness) led to a reduced threshold
power of 22 kW/cm2. By inserting InGaN QWs in a core shell geometry in these
triangular wires, emission and laser action could be achieved over a large spectral
range (400–480nm) (Qian 2008). The overlap between the optical mode in the
center of the triangular guide and the wells grown on the triangle edges was 0.24
for 26 QWs (0.12 for 13 QWs), which gives an overlap of about 0.009 per QW.
This is actually larger than the usual values (0.007 per QW) in edge-emitting
lasers with AlGaN or even AlInN cladding layers. This results comes as a sur-
prise, as QWs in edge-emitting lasers are grown in the center of the guide where
the mode amplitude is maximum, while they are grown oﬀset from the mode
maximum in these nanowires. However, the overall mode-conﬁnement is higher
in the nanowire, as the GaN/air interface has a much higher index contrast
than the AlGaN/GaN interface, ﬁnally leading to a better overlap in nanowires.
Apart from these details there is no major diﬀerence between these long nanowire
lasers and a conventional edge-emitting laser, which would be narrow and short.
The fabrication of the nanowire-based optically injected laser is easier, as there
is no processing step. However, for electrical devices the nanowire approach is

356
Advanced photonic and nanophotonic devices
much more complicated, and has not yet allowed fabrication of electrical injec-
tion lasers. Given their aspect ratio, the core-shell geometry is by far the most
favorable conﬁguration for fabricating lasers in these long wires.
In shorter and broader nanowires (or microwires), radial (meaning non-
axial) modes are in competition with axial modes. Two types of radial mode
can propagate. First, Fabry–Perot modes can resonate between the facets of
hexagonal wires when the diameter (in hexagons, “diameter” should be under-
stood as the distance between facets opposite each other) is a multiple of λ/2nr
(about 75 nm at a wavelength of 365 nm). Second, whispering-gallery modes
can propagate as in microdisks (see the previous section) when the diameter is
a multiple of λ/nrπ (for n = 1 modes circulating close to the periphery). Hence,
both modes can coexist in some nano–micro wires. This has been observed in
GaN wires with a diameter of about 2 μm (Coulon 2012). A signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence between whispering-gallery modes in wires and disks is the dispersion along
the wire axis, which reduces the apparent mode Q factor if the measurement is
not angle-resolved (Q of up to 100 was measured). When the measurement is
angle-resolved, the Q factor is as high as 700 in 5-μm diameter wires (Trichet

Conclusion

2012). In doped GaN, the exciton broadening and the residual absorption lead
to a weak coupling between the exciton and the optical mode. In undoped GaN,
a strong coupling is observed with a large Rabi splitting energy of 115 meV at
temperatures from 10 to 300 K, while the transition linewidth is as small as
7.5 meV, leading to a very large splitting/linewidth ratio of 15 (Trichet 2012)
and a good splitting visibility, as can be seen in Fig. 10.13. Attempts were carried
out to produce lasing from these polaritons, but without success. We recall, to
ﬁnish, that polariton lasing was achieved in a nanowire, but the nanowire was
simply used as the emitting region inserted in a dielectric planar cavity, as has
been described in the planar cavity section (Das 2011).

Conclusion
Nanophotonics in nitrides is following the avenues opened by other materials
such as arsenides. In many areas the gap in performance between arsenides and
nitrides has been reduced, and nitride even caught up in the domain of room-
temperature polariton lasing. As in other materials, nanophotonics in nitrides
has remained so far very academic. In terms of pure science, the speciﬁcities of
nitrides (the same could be written for ZnO) are the exciton stability at high
temperature and density, and the strong exciton–phonon interaction. This has
led to the demonstration of some aspects which were not observable in other
materials. However, one must admit that these speciﬁcities and possible advant-
ages of nitrides for pure science in nanophotonics remain quite limited. Then,
a legitimate question could be: Why should we keep exploring nanophotonics
with nitrides? The ﬁrst answer is that many breakthroughs in science were made
in areas where they were not expected, and exploring and pushing the limits of
current knowledge remains essential. There are still speciﬁcities of nitrides which
have not been fully explored, such as the small spin–orbit coupling and the ex-
pected long spin coherence lifetime, the large phonon energy, the electronic band
structure, and the possibility of having very energetic carriers (under electric or
optical excitation), and many others. Hence, domains such as spin optronics or
non-linear photonics in materials very far from equilibrium may have a better
chance of emerging in nitrides rather than in any other material. The second
answer is related to applications. So far, no application has been found for nan-
ophotonics in nitrides. However, this remark also holds for other materials, and
simply follows from the current immaturity of nanophotonics. Applications are
not to be expected in the short term. In the longer term, nitrides will bene-
ﬁt from higher operation temperature and higher power level than many other
materials. They will also beneﬁt from a wider spread (in terms of industrial im-
portance, and the number of industrial players) than any other optically active
semiconductors, so that integrating nanophotonics with other nitride devices or
developing nanophotonic devices starting from the existing nitride technology
will be easier than with any other material. Compared to arsenides, there will
be no real competition, as the spectral regions covered by both materials do

not overlap. While arsenide nanophotonics is largely dominated by the optical
emission, detection, and processing of photons in the near-infrared (1−1.6 μm),
with applications in optical computing, quantum calculation, cryptography, and
so on, nitrides will probably be used for visible photons with applications such
as optical storage, displays, and biophotonics (most biomolecules are sensitive
in the near UV and visible range). Nanophotonic devices should allow the emis-
sion of light with low optical power but high brightness and directionality, and
under low electrical power. This last point is essential. Most applications require
electrical devices, and this is clearly an area where GaN nanophotonics should
develop and improve, if it is to aim at moving from research laboratories to
commercial devices.

Nitride-based electron devices
for high-power/high-frequency applications
Yvon Cordier, Tatsuya Fujishima, Bin Lu,
Elison Matioli, and Tom´as Palacios
Progress in the development of III-nitride materials has made possible the
fabrication of many diﬀerent types of electron devices. This chapter describes
the main advantages of GaN-based electronics as well as some of the main elec-
tronic devices developed with this material system. Section 11.1 introduces the
key material properties and ﬁgures of merit that make III-nitride materials ideal
for many high-power/high-frequency applications. Section 11.2 focuses on the
diﬀerent GaN diode structures developed so far, while Section 11.3 discusses
GaN bipolar transistors. Finally, section 11.4 studies ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors, both
lateral and vertical.
11.1
Relevant GaN properties for electron devices
The unique and broad spectrum of properties of wurtzite III-nitride materi-
als oﬀers an unprecended level of ﬂexibility for the design of advanced electron
devices. Table 11.1 shows some of these material properties and the main ad-
vantages of these materials for electronics. First, their band gap is direct and
tunable from 0.7 eV in the case of InN to 6.2 eV in AlN. The large band-
gap energies enable large conduction and valence band discontinuities in many
heterostructures, signiﬁcantly helping with carrier conﬁnement. These mater-
ials are also highly polar, which allows the use of polarization doping to
induce two- and three-dimensional charge layers without the need of doping
[Yu97, Ambacher99, Rajan04]. Both the electron mobility and velocity (νs) in
GaN are high, especially in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) induced at
the interface of AlxInyGa1-x-yN/GaN heterostructures. This enables the fabrica-
tion of devices with high cut-oﬀfrequencies (for instance, high electron mobility
transistors, HEMTs), but also for low-loss power switching devices that need low
on-state resistances. In addition, the large band gap induces a very low intrinsic
carrier density (ni) that ensures good charge control even at high temperatures.
Furthermore, the combination of these properties with a high critical electric ﬁeld
(Ec), up to ten-fold higher in GaN than in Si, makes these materials ideal for
power applications. Finally, the thermal conductivity (ΘK) of GaN is similar to
that of silicon, while that of AlN is 30% higher, which helps to eﬃciently remove
the generated heat in these devices. The only signiﬁcant drawback of III-nitrides

Nitride-based electron devices
relates to the low hole mobility and the poor p-type doping activation, which
has prevented the fabrication of high-performance hole-based electronic devices
until now.
Beyond the individual material properties, many ﬁgures of merit (FOM) have
been proposed to benchmark the merit of diﬀerent material systems for a given
application. One of the most widely used at one time is the Johnson Figure
of Merit (JFOM) [Johnson65], which gives an idea of material suitability for
high-power applications at high frequencies:
JFOM =
	Ec × νs
2π

Table 11.2 shows a comparison of the JFOM in the main semiconductor families.
It is clear that wide band-gap materials like GaN, AlN, diamond, and silicon
carbide are excellent candidates for high-frequency power applications. Other
FOMs have been proposed for more speciﬁc cases [Baliga89]. Among these, the
Keyes FOM considers thermal limitations due to transistor switching:
KFOM = ΘK ×
 cνs

where c is the speed of light. The Baliga FOM was developed to compare the
ultimate performance of ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors for low-frequency power-switching
applications, where the conduction losses dominate:
BFOM = ε × μe × Egap

while the Baliga high-frequency FOM (BHFFOM) benchmarks these devices at
high frequency, where switching losses dominate:
BHFFOM = μe × E2

where VG is the gate drive voltage and VBr the breakdown voltage. The latter
can be related to an experimental ﬁgure of merit involving the on-state speciﬁc
resistance Ron of the device and its critical electric ﬁeld:

Finally, a Combined Figure of Merit (CFOM) was developed to simultaneously
account for the high-frequency, high-power and high-temperature performance
[Shur04]:

No matter what FOM is used, wide-band-gap materials dominate high-frequency
and high-power applications. Among wide-band-gap semiconductors, GaN-based
materials are arguably the most mature ones in terms of wafer-size availability,
technology, and market prospects.
11.2
GaN two-terminal devices
There is a wide variety of GaN two-terminal devices. In this section we de-
scribe those of main interest for electronic applications, starting with Schottky
and bipolar junction diodes. Other devices, such as Gunn-eﬀect diodes, tunnel
junctions, and ﬁnally resonant tunneling diodes, are also presented.
11.2.1
High-breakdown Schottky diodes
The Schottky diode is probably the simplest, but still relevant, electron device
based on GaN. The high breakdown voltage achievable in GaN and its combina-
tion with a high carrier concentration in the channel to lower on-state resistance
make it ideal for high-breakdown rectiﬁers. Such power rectiﬁers are mainly de-
veloped for replacing 600 V silicon-based diodes in switching applications such as
power-factor correction (PFC) [Alquier12]. The extremely short switching time
of Schottky devices (ns) and the lack of reverse recovery thanks to its unipolar
character are important advantages of these diodes [Zhou06]. SiC devices have
been the main option for these applications for many years, though it has been
reported recently that GaN rectiﬁers present equal or even better performance
at a fraction of the cost [Cohen05].
GaN-based Schottky rectiﬁers are generally vertical devices based on several
micron-thick n-type GaN ﬁlms, and a highly doped contact layer (Fig. 11.1).
Depending on the thickness and the doping level of the top layer (drift layer),
the breakdown is limited by punch-through or by GaN avalanche [Bandic98]
(Fig. 11.2). Various device architectures have been proposed for high-breakdown-
voltage (HBV) Schottky diodes, depending on the substrate used for GaN growth
(Fig. 11.1). The growth of GaN is typically achieved on insulating sapphire sub-
strates, or on conductive silicon carbide or silicon substrates. In all these cases it
is necessary to remove the substrate or use through-wafer vias to make vertical
devices, due to either the insulating character of the substrate or the highly res-
istive AlN buﬀer layers used for the growth. This problem does not exist when the
diodes are grown directly on highly doped GaN substrates, though the substrate
cost in this case dominates the availability of these devices.
Another approach for fabricating Schottky diodes is to develop a pseudo-
vertical device for which a low-doped thick GaN layer is grown on top of a

highly doped one. In this case it is necessary to etch several micrometers of GaN
to be able to deposit the ohmic contact on the highly doped bottom layer. The
critical step here is the control of the etching depth by reactive ion etching (RIE)
or inductively coupled plasma etching (ICP).
The ohmic contact formation on highly doped GaN layer is easily obtained
after deposition and annealing of metal stacks with Ti that beneﬁt from the
formation of conductive TiN [Lin94] or TiAl3 [M´enard10]; this provides con-
tact resistances in the 10−6–10−5 Ωcm2 range. The Schottky contact on GaN
can be obtained by deposition of metals with a large work function (e.g., Au,

Pd, Ni, and Pt). The Schottky barrier height (ΦB) is typically of 1 eV or less,
indicating the probable presence of Fermi-level pinning at the metal/GaN in-
terface [Roccaforte10]. This is certainly due to electron tunneling via surface
defects such as threading dislocations, as conﬁrmed by the dependence of the
reverse leakage current with the crystal quality [Alquier12]. The diode current
obeys the thermionic emission theory at low bias, while more complex transport
involving thermionic ﬁeld emission and tunneling occurs at large reverse bias.
The reverse leakage currents of simple diodes are generally larger than expected,
and associated breakdown voltages of the pseudo-vertical devices are often be-
low 100 V. This is partly due to the electric ﬁeld crowding at the edges of the
Schottky contact. In order to lower the electric ﬁeld in this region, the combina-
tion of a p-type doped guard ring and a ﬁeld plate is suitable. Unfortunately, Mg
implantation and activation annealing steps have been reported as very diﬃcult,
and the use of resistive guard rings with Mg, In, Ar, or He is preferred [Liu09].
Using this technology, diodes with a forward capability of 100 A/cm2 at 1.2 V
and with more than 600 V reverse breakdown voltage have been demonstrated
on GaN on sapphire substrates, in spite of the large dislocation density typ-
ical of GaN heteroepitaxy [Alquier12]. The use of low-dislocation-density GaN
substrates helps for the reduction of the reverse leakage current and the enhance-
ment of the breakdown voltage. 5-μm thick GaN layers grown on GaN substrates
with threading dislocation densities lower than 106 cm−2 led to the fabrication
of diodes with a breakdown voltage over 1100 V, a forward current capability of
500 A/cm2 at 1.46 V, a speciﬁc on-state resistance of 0.71 mΩ.cm2, and a result-
ant ﬁgure of merit (VBr2/Ron) of 1.7 GW/cm2 [Saitoh10]. The achievement of
such a defect reduction is, however, still very diﬃcult for GaN grown on large-area
silicon wafers, even when noticeable improvements have been made with 4-μm
thick crack-free continuous GaN ﬁlms on 4- and 6-in. Si substrates [Frayssinet11]
and with 5-μm thick GaN on 3C-SiC/Si(111) substrates [Cordier10].
Finally, an important challenge for applications is that GaN Schottky diodes
experience performance degradation while increasing the temperature. As shown
in Fig. 11.3, the reverse leakage current increases as well as the series resistances
at forward bias larger than 1V.
The main diﬃculty for the realization of HBV Schottky diodes is the sens-
itivity of the leakage current to the crystal quality and to surface treatments
such as plasma etching, implantation, and annealing [Pearton99, Pearton00]. An
alternative approach to vertical or pseudo-vertical devices is the fabrication of
planar diodes. A planar GaN diode can be obtained with both the ohmic contact
and the Schottky contact deposited on top of a lightly doped GaN layer. In that
case, however, the device is severely limited by a high on-state resistance (in
spite of the achievement of low-resistance ohmic contacts via the implantation
of low-doped GaN layers [Burm97]), and in terms of the trade-oﬀbetween the
on-state resistance and the breakdown voltage. In a similar manner, replacing
GaN with an alloy such as AlGaN helps in achieving higher Schottky barrier and
larger breakdown voltage [Zhang00], but the crystal and surface quality as well

as the lower electron mobility are generally important drawbacks with respect
to GaN diodes. An attractive alternative consists in combining the advantage of
a wide band-gap barrier material such as AlGaN or AlInN with the low-access
resistance of the two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface with GaN
[Chen08]: namely, a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure (see
Section 11.4.1).
11.2.2
Bipolar GaN diodes (p-n or p-i-n)
p-i-n diodes are expected to have larger reverse blocking voltages than Schottky
diodes due to the lower leakage current of the reverse-biased junction [Zhang01],
[Mochizuki11]. However, the junction barrier leads to a higher forward turn-on
voltage. Furthermore, when switching from forward to reverse bias, the minority
carriers stored in quasi-neutral regions must be removed. This is responsible for
longer switching times (in relation to minority carrier lifetime), and their diﬀu-
sion in the direction opposite to the initially applied electric ﬁeld leads to reverse
current spikes and switching losses. In addition, these vertical devices share some
common challenges with the Schottky-based devices, such as the sensitivity of
leakage current to crystal defects such as dislocations [Kozodoy98], and the ne-
cessity to implement surface passivations and ﬁeld plates for high breakdown
voltage. The device structure of a GaN bipolar diode generally consists of an
n+/n bottom layer capped with a p GaN layer doped with Mg to form the
junction, and terminated with a p+ contact layer. The doping level is generally
below 1016 cm−3 to avoid premature breakdown at the junction. The on-state
resistance of these devices depends critically on the p-doping eﬃciency and the

surface preparation for ohmic contact formation. However, the low Mg activa-
tion in III-N semiconductors makes necessary the incorporation of a very large
density of Mg atoms, in the range of 1017 to 1019 per cm3. In spite of higher
contact resistivity than for n-type contacts, the forward-biased p-n diode can
beneﬁt from photon recycling eﬀects so that relatively low on-state resistances
can be achieved [Hatakeyama11].
Like Schottky rectiﬁers, the fabrication of devices on GaN free-standing sub-
strates has quickly improved device performance [Limb06, Hatakeyama11]. p-n
diodes with ﬁeld-plates demonstrated breakdown voltages over 1100 V, a knee
voltage of about 2 V (Fig. 11.4), and speciﬁc on-resistance of 0.4 mΩ·cm2, with
a resultant ﬁgure of merit (VBr2/Ron) of 3.0 GW/cm2.
As in the case of Schottky diodes, high temperatures enhance the reverse
leakage current but with a lower magnitude for large reverse bias [Kozodoy98],
[Uesugi11]. At the same time, the increase in temperature lowers the forward
threshold voltage of the diode.
11.2.3
Gunn diodes
The bulk negative diﬀerential resistance (NDR) eﬀect is a very popular phe-
nomenon in III–V compounds such as GaAs and InP. In these materials it is
due to the transfer of electrons between the high-mobility central valley and the

low-mobility satellite valley, and leads to a decrease and saturation of the elec-
tron velocity beyond a critical electric ﬁeld. As shown in Fig. 11.5, this leads
to a charge inhomogeneity (dipole), traveling from the cathode to the anode
of a diode (named Gunn diode), and ﬁnally gives rise to transit-time current
oscillations that can be exploited for the microwave and millimeter-wave signal
generation. The signiﬁcantly higher electrical strength of wide-band-gap semi-
conductors allows operation with higher doping levels and at higher bias, which
should lead to oscillators with much better power performance than their III–V
counterparts.
Various possibilities are suggested for the nature of the NDR in nitrides. The
ﬁrst one, as in GaAs, is the electron intervalley transfer [Kolnik95], but the large
energy barrier separating neighbor valleys in GaN (2.1 eV) may push the eﬀect to
very large electrical ﬁelds. Another possibility is the inﬂexion of the central val-
ley [Krishnamurthy97]. Wraback measured the electron velocity along the c axis
of wurtzite GaN with femtosecond optical pulse-probe experiments using 80-fs
pump and probe pulses [Wraback03]. Transient velocity overshoot was observed
along the c axis at electric ﬁelds as low as 130 kV/cm. According to Monte Carlo
calculations, at electric ﬁelds below 300 kV/cm this velocity overshoot is not as-
sociated with intervalley transfer, but with band non-parabolicity in the central
valley. Calculations of transport in the basal plane suggest that a similar velocity
overshoot would need much higher electric ﬁelds (∼175 kV/cm) in this plane.

Previously, a critical ﬁeld of 180 kV/cm was measured on thick GaN samples
[Barker05] with 200-ns-long pulse measurements. At this ﬁeld, a maximum velo-
city of 2.5 × 107 cm/s was measured in the basal plane. When the pulse width is
reduced to 10 ns, AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with a two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) showed an apparent saturation velocity near 3.1 × 107 cm/s, at a
ﬁeld of 140 kV/cm. The latter indicates that sample heating (lattice heating and
hot phonons) may play an important role in such measurement. It is also worth
noting that the NDR eﬀect is also expected for zincblende GaN [Kolnik95].
In a classical model the main criterion of the active layers for Gunn instabil-
ities is the (doping × length) product. This criterion is based on the fact that
the accumulated electron domain growth rate should be higher than the transit
frequency through the layer [Alekseev00]; furthermore, the threshold electric
ﬁeld for NDR determines the maximum doping level. The frequency capability
of GaN diodes is, however, still controversial. Indeed, the ultimate frequency is
highly dependent on the involved relaxation times. Alekseev reported that the
frequency capability of GaN-based NDR devices was of 700 GHz in the case
of the intervalley-transfer-based NDR and 4 THz in the case of the injection-
based NDR (relaxation time of 0.15 ps). However, Aslan has indicated that
collision-dominated Monte Carlo simulations of the velocity-ﬁeld relation typ-
ically do not take into account the relatively long (0.35 ps) non-equilibrium
longitudinal optical (LO) phonon lifetime in GaN, and more important, the
Monte Carlo method was often used even when the diode was too short for assum-
ing a transport dominated by collisions (i.e., 100 nm) [Aslan11]. Alternatively,
based on the velocity–ﬁeld relation derived from the pulse-probe experiments
reported by Wraback, the use of higher electric ﬁelds in an ultra-short GaN
channel (i.e., 250 nm) was proposed to ensure operation in the quasi-ballistic
transport regime. As shown in Figure 11.6, compared with Monte Carlo results
[Wraback03], such a regime can lead to noticeably high-velocity overshoots (as
high as 7 × 105 m/s). Device simulations in such submicron channel devices pro-
ject power-added eﬃciency (PAE) up to 3.4% at 1.5 THz frequency [Aslan11].
At the same time, simulations for GaN diodes with thermal eﬀects predicted a
PAE of 1–2% at frequencies slightly below 200 GHz for 1–2-μm-channel devices
on submicron-GaN-thickness ﬁlms [Tang09].
As the NDR is expected in both vertical and basal plane directions, in bulk
GaN as well as for 2DEGs a variety of device conﬁgurations has been investig-
ated. The simplest one is the N+/N/N+ diode shown in Fig. 11.7. An oscillator
can be built with such a diode when a high enough DC bias is applied inside
an RLC circuit [Alekseev00], [Aslan11]. The fact that a relatively high elec-
tric ﬁeld is necessary to induce NDR has an important impact on the device
design and technology, as electromigration and other degradation eﬀects (e.g.
avalanche breakdown) have to be avoided [Mutamba06]. An alternative approach
to accelerate electrons without having to increase the external bias is to insert
graded-composition AlGaN barriers in a manner similar to the way by which
graded gap AlGaAs emitters were used in GaAs devices [Montanari05].

Some of the previous issues (including air breakdown) have been partly solved
by Yilmazoglu, who has shown bias oscillations in a pulse reﬂected from a vertical
GaN Gunn diodes (5μm, n = 1 × 1017 cm−3) connected to a series inductance
and subjected to 70-ns bias pulses. The voltage across the GaN Gunn diode
terminals was about 200 V and the DC peak power 190 W, which emphasizes
that thermal management is a major issue for GaN Gunn diodes [Yilmazoglu08].

electrical connections inside light-emitting devices [Grundmann07] or multi-
junction solar cells. The GaN tunnel junction is, however, quite peculiar due
to the large polarization-induced electric ﬁelds present in c-oriented wurtzite
heterostructures, and the large band-gap of these materials. If one examines the
case of the interband electron tunneling, it is clear that GaN is not a good candid-
ate compared to heavily doped germanium p-n junction diodes [Esaki58]. This is
due to the large band-gap of GaN (3.4 eV), coupled with the diﬃculty in achiev-
ing highly doped p-type GaN which result in p-n junctions with wide depletion
regions (∼25 nm). However, the polarization-induced electric ﬁeld present at the
AlGaN/GaN or the InGaN/GaN interfaces can be suﬃcient to enable the correct
alignment of the conduction and valence bands of a properly designed structure.
As shown in Figure 11.8, the polarization ﬁeld of 12 MV/cm at the AlN/GaN
interface is suﬃcient to align the bands for an AlN thickness below 5 nm
[Leconte07]. If the GaN layer located on the top of the AlN barrier is p-type
doped, it is then easy for holes to tunnel through the thin barrier into the n-type
doped layer, even for 0 V bias. Such a Zener diode is more conductive under
reverse bias due to the asymmetry of the band diagram, and can be used for the
rectiﬁcation of small AC signals [Simon09].

Nitride-based electron devices
The use of narrower-bandgap nitride ﬁlms would improve the performance
of tunnel junctions. For instance, an InGaN/GaN/InGaN structure is expected
to have better tunneling than the previously discussed GaN/AlN/GaN, though
the growth of thick indium-rich InGaN layers is still a challenge. An alternative
method is based on using GaN/InGaN/GaN junctions [Krishnamoorthy10]. The
band diagram of such a junction is shown in Fig. 11.9. One can see that the
inserted 6.4-nm thick In0.33Ga0.67N layer is able to align the p and n GaN regions
at 0 V. It should be noted that the structure has to be grown with N-polarity
in order to keep the p-type doped layer on the top. In spite of the thickness
and the presence of spikes due to the band discontinuities, the lower band-gap
of InGaN results in larger current densities compared to the AlN-based diode
or a reference GaN p+/n+ junction. The reverse current density is 100 A/cm2
at 1 V, which is high enough to enable the use of tunnel junctions in III-nitride
devices such as LEDs, lasers, and solar cells.
The resonant tunneling eﬀect can be used for building high-speed digital cir-
cuits [Haddad97] or for injecting electrons with a precisely controlled energy
in vertical unipolar devices such as quantum cascade lasers, resonant hot elec-
tron transistors, or long-wavelength intersubband detectors (see Chapter 12).
Resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) are the basic building-blocks of all these
devices. In these diodes, the tunnel current ﬂow reaches a maximum when the
energy of electrons from the emitter is resonant whith one of the quantum-
well energy states. For further increase of the bias, the tunnel current ﬂow
decreases sharply and the minimum of the total current is determined by leakage,
scattering, and thermionic current ﬂow.

A RTD device basically consists of a 0.5–2 nm thick GaN quantum well
located between 1–3 nm AlGaN barriers and N-type doped GaN contact lay-
ers (Fig. 11.10). The occurrence of a resonant tunneling eﬀect induces a sharp
decrease of the electrical current passing through the double-barrier struc-
ture when electrons from the emitter region no longer tunnel due to the
misalignment of the energy of electrons on the emitter side with the quant-
ized state within the central quantum well (negative diﬀerential resistance). In
principle, the AlGaN/GaN double-barrier diodes oﬀer advantages such as ma-
terial robustness, high breakdown ﬁeld, and large conduction-band discontinuity
(ΔEc∼1.7–1.9 eV for AlN/GaN). However, the asymmetric band diagram in-
duced by the presence of the polarization ﬁelds at the interfaces of c-oriented
wurtzite structures is a challenge for the design of RTDs in nitride semicon-
ductors (Fig. 11.11). Preliminary results show asymmetric I–V characteristics
(Fig. 11.10). Furthermore, the sensitivity of this device to point defects and
dislocations acting as traps or leakage path makes the realization of resonant
tunneling diﬃcult and highly non-uniform (Fig. 11.10). Many authors noticed
the instability of the I–V characteristics [Foxon03, Golka06] independently of dis-
location density. As these structures were grown at relatively low temperatures
by plasma-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), traps in AlN barriers are prob-
ably involved [Hermann04, Sakr11]. This pushed Bayram to grow AlN/GaN/AlN
RTD structures by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on low-
dislocation-density GaN on sapphire templates [Bayram10a]. This produced I–V
characteristics with current peak-to-valley ratio and hysteresis comparable to
MBE-grown RTDs on GaN substrates by Golka. The growth of low Al content
(Al ∼0.2) AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN structures on low-dislocation-density GaN has
been shown to improve the stability of I–V characteristics (by using MOCVD
[Bayram10b] and MBE [Li12]).

The asymmetric conduction-band proﬁle due to the polarization-induced ele-
ctric ﬁelds is responsible for asymmetric current–voltage behavior, which is
undesirable for most of the high-frequency applications. As the asymmetry is
due mainly to the GaN band bending at the top and at the bottom of the
double-barrier structure (Fig. 11.11), the insertion of a graded AlGaN emitter or
collector has been proposed to make the structure more symmetric [Berland11].
Another proposed solution consists in growing the structure on non-polar GaN
(e.g. m-plane GaN susbtrate) [Bayram10b], or on cubic GaN [Zainal10].
11.3
Bipolar junction transistors and heterojunction bipolar
transistors (BJT and HBT)
Bipolar junction transistors (BJT) are made of two back-to-back p-n diodes
(Fig. 11.12). Under normal operating conditions, the ﬁrst junction (emitter-base)
is forward-biased so that minority carriers are injected into the base while the
other junction (base-collector) is reverse-biased, and minority carriers transiting
trough the base are collected in the collector layer. A small change of the emitter–
base junction-barrier energy has a very important eﬀect on the number of
minority carriers injected into the base. Most of these carriers reach the collector
and, as a consequence, the collector current is controlled by small changes in the
base bias. As the voltage at the base–collector junction can be much higher than
the one at the emitter–base junction, power ampliﬁcation arises in the transistor.
The current gain deﬁned as the ratio of the collector current over the base
current is an important ﬁgure of merit for bipolar transistors. It represents the
modulation eﬃciency of the minority carrier current in the collector with respect
to the base current. The base current is due to the recombination of carriers in the
base, minority carrier injection from the base into the emitter, and leakage cur-
rent at the base–collector junction. A good bipolar transistor necessitates that

the minority carriers injected into the base reach the collector region without
recombining with majority carriers or defects. For this to happen, a thin base
layer with high carrier mobility and velocity is required. At the same time, a thin
base requires a high doping level to limit the increase of the base resistance as
well as the reduction of the eﬀective base width under high collector bias (Early
eﬀect). As the doping level in the base should be lower than the one in the emit-
ter to limit the injection of carriers from the base into the emitter, it is clear
that the design of a bipolar junction transistor is made of multiple trade-oﬀs.
The use of an emitter with a wider band-gap energy than the base (emitter–
base heterojunction) drastically reduces the undesirable injection of carriers from
the base in this heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). Furthermore, this al-
lows reduction of the doping level of the emitter, which reduces the junction
capacitance and is beneﬁcial for high-frequency applications. In addition, a wide-
band-gap collector is often used for enhancing the breakdown voltage in these
transistors.
The high critical electric ﬁeld and electron velocity of GaN makes this ma-
terial system very attractive for high-voltage HBT devices [Xing01]. In addition,
GaN HBTs oﬀer two important advantages over ﬁeld-eﬀect devices for mi-
crowave power ampliﬁcation: higher current densities, and linearity. Furthermore,
for high-frequency applications, the shrinking of the transistor gate length in
ﬁeld-eﬀect devices is more technologically challenging than to control the base
thickness through heteroepitaxy. However, GaN is a direct band-gap material
and the radiative recombination in the base cannot be completely avoided, which
limits the eﬃciency of the collector current modulation. But the main diﬃculty
arises from the diﬃculty of achieving high p-type doping in GaN or AlGaN (i.e.
above 1018 cm−3) as well as suﬃcient hole mobility. For these reasons, the n-p-n

382
Nitride-based electron devices
transistors are preferred to p-n-p ones, and some authors proposed the n-GaN/
p-SiC/n-SiC hybrid heterojunction as an alternative [Pankove94]. Although such
a device demonstrated a current density of 1.8 kA/cm2 and a power density of
30 kW/cm2, it suﬀered from low breakdown voltage (below 10 V) and noticeable
leakage of current, preventing common-emitter operation. The low breakdown
voltage is believed to be due to the combination of high doping levels and crystal
defects at the GaN/SiC heterojunction.
Recent progress made in the doping of GaN with Mg has led to the demon-
stration of pure GaN n-p-n BJTs. Even with the limited performance of these
early devices, these transistors exhibited excellent thermal stability, with no de-
gradation at 300◦C [Yoshida99]. The device-processing technology is, however,
diﬃcult due to the required dry etching of the emitter region, which damages the
base layer. In order to overcome this diﬃculty, the GaN emitter can be select-
ively regrown onto the base after patterning a dielectric mask deposited after the
growth of the base–collector junction [Limb00]. Limb et al. reported high-voltage
operation (>80V) but with a limited current gain of 3, due to the high lateral
resistance of the base layer.
As discussed previously, the use of AlGaN/GaN, GaN/InGaN and AlGaN/
InGaN heterojunctions allow signiﬁcant improvement in the performance of
HBTs. In addition, thanks to the large polarization ﬁelds present in wurtzite
materials, graded composition alloys can be grown for lowering the base resist-
ance [Asbeck00]. n-p-n AlGaN/GaN HBTs with a current gain of 35 have been
obtained [Xing01]. Pearton reported current gains of 15–20 in n-p-n structures
[Pearton00]. More recently, p-n-p AlGaN/GaN HBTs grown on GaN substrates
have demonstrated a maximum current gain of 85 and a maximum collector
current density of 7.3 kA/cm2 at a collector–emitter voltage of 30 V, which cor-
responds to a maximum power-dissipation density of 219 kW/cm2 [Kumakara08].
The same devices grown on sapphire exhibited noticeably lower current gain,
attributed to the larger dislocation density and self-heating.
p-type doped InGaN base layers have a resistivity of only one tenth of
that in p-GaN layers, which has led to the development of AlGaN/InGaN and
GaN/InGaN HBTs [Makimoto02, 03, 04]. In addition, the chemical stability of
InGaN layers simpliﬁes the emitter etching process and allows the regrowth of
an external base layer for an even lower access resistance. This is crucial for
low-oﬀ-set voltages. In these InGaN-base devices, the presence of band-oﬀsets
and polarization charges can signiﬁcantly increase the breakdown voltage (up
to 100 V), but at the expense of the current gain, so that graded composition
layers at the base–collector junctions are inserted with resultant diﬀerential cur-
rent gain (dIc/dIb) of several thousands and breakdown voltages up to 50 V.
Moreover, the insertion of a graded composition InGaN layer at the emitter–
base interface has been proposed to provide a larger energy barrier for holes,
which allows higher emitter-injection eﬃciency, higher current gain, and pos-
sibly the achievement of an emitter–base junction with higher crystal quality

a peak current gain of 105 and a collector current density >6.5 kA/cm2 has been
demonstrated on a sapphire substrate. In [Lochner11] a device made on free-
standing GaN substrate produced a maximum collector current of 12.3 kA/cm2
and a current gain of 90. In this device (Fig. 11.13, left), the reduction in local-
ized states (traps), as well as threading dislocation density, may have contributed
to signiﬁcant improvement of the diﬀusion length of minority carriers.
Continuous improvement in material quality and device technology has also
led to a signiﬁcant increase in the high-frequency capability of GaN HBTs. As
shown in Fig. 11.13 (right) [Shen11], a device grown on a high-quality GaN-on-
sapphire template with a current density above 16 kA/cm2 has demonstrated
a maximum current-gain cut-oﬀfrequency of 5.3 GHz at 4.7 kA/cm2 and a
power-gain cut-oﬀfrequency of 1.3 GHz. This is still far from the theoretical
projections of more than 200 GHz for a 50-nm base width [McCarthy01a], but
there is signiﬁcant room for improvement by optimizing the device topology.
Unfortunately, like SiC, GaN and related compounds still suﬀer from a low hole
mobility, which severely limits the performance of HBTs. This limitation has
fostered the development of alternative unipolar vertical devices, such as the
hot-electron transistor [Shur00, Dasgupta11].

Field-eﬀect transistors
Field-eﬀect transistors have been the most successful GaN electron devices until
now. They are widely used in RF power ampliﬁcation and high-voltage power-
switching. In this section, we will review some of the most common ﬁeld-eﬀect

transistor structures, device design, and state-of-the-art performance for these
two applications. Section 11.4.1 will discuss lateral high electron mobility tran-
sistors (HEMT) for high-frequency power ampliﬁers, while Section 11.4.2 will
introduce the main diﬀerences in the design of these devices when used in
high-voltage switching applications. Finally, Section 11.4.3 focuses on vertical
ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors used mainly in power applications.
11.4.1
High-frequency GaN-based HEMTs for RF and mixed-signal
applications
AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) were the ﬁrst nitride-
based HEMT structures to be developed [Khan94]. The AlGaN/GaN beneﬁts
from high electron mobility (∼2000 cm2/V·s) and high two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) density (∼1013 cm−2). Contrary to other material systems, such
as AlGaAs/GaAs or Si/SiGe, the high 2DEG density is not induced by doping,
but by donor-like surface states at the AlGaN surface, which accumulate at
the interface of AlGaN/GaN due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization
electric ﬁelds inside the AlGaN layer [Ibbetson00]. The 2DEG density in this
case is determined mainly by the thickness and aluminum content in the AlGaN
barrier layer (Fig. 11.14).
To use these devices in power ampliﬁers, it is important to ensure that the
power gain cut-oﬀfrequency fMAX is several times larger than the intended
operating frequency, as this will determine the gain and, to some degree, the

thickness and composition.

eﬃciency of the ampliﬁer [Chung10]. fMAX can be calculated with the following
expression:
fMAX ∼=
fT
2

(Ri + Rs + Rg)g0 + 2πfT RgCgd
where Cgd is the gate-drain capacitance, g0 is the output conductance, and Ri,
Rs, and Rg are the input, source, and gate resistances, respectively. The optimiz-
ation of fMAX relies closely on the maximization of fT as well as on the reduction
of parasitic elements such as Ri, Rs, Rg, Cgd, and g0 [Tasker89, Nidhi06].
The reduction of gate length is an important factor to improve fT and there-
fore fMAX, but as the gate length is reduced, the horizontal electric ﬁeld increases
and becomes comparable to the vertical ﬁeld, which conﬁnes the carriers on the
2D channel. This two-dimensional distribution of the electric ﬁeld under the gate
results in short-channel eﬀects which degrade the device performance by shift-
ing the threshold voltage, increasing the output conductance (g0), reducing the
transconductance and resulting in poor pinch-oﬀand limited frequency perform-
ance [Sze81]. These degrading eﬀects can be signiﬁcantly reduced by maintaining
a large aspect ratio (Lg/tb, where Lg is the transistor gate length and tb the bar-
rier thickness). Along with ultra-short gate lengths to maximize fT , the search for
new barrier materials and back-barrier structures to better conﬁne the electrons
in the channel and provide a suitable aspect ratio (Lg/tb) are key technologies
for increasing the frequency performance of these devices.
Minimizing the parasitic elements is just as important. The reduction of con-
tact resistance has been investigated through the use of recessed ohmic contacts
[Buttari02] and regrown contacts [Dasgupta10, Guo12]. Ultra-low contact resist-
ance of 27 Ω · μm has been achieved in N-polar GaN transistors by regrowing InN
in the ohmic contacts, which allows the contact to be made to a narrow-band-
gap material [Dasgupta10]. In parallel, the access resistances from the contacts
to the gate need to be minimized by reducing the source-to-drain distance or,
ultimately, by using a self-aligned process [Shinohara11a, Nidhi09]. The optim-
ization of T-shaped gates is also essential to reduce gate resistance Rg and gate
capacitance Cgd [Chung10, Denninghoﬀ12]. The following sections will discuss
these and other technologies yielding state-of-the-art frequency performance in
nitride-based HEMTs.
Scaling transistor gate length.
The geometrical shape of the gate directly de-
termines its resistance and capacitance. The gate resistance Rg is proportional
to ρW/A, where ρ is the gate-metal resistivity, W is the gate width, and A is
the cross-sectional area of the gate. As the gate length is reduced to maximize
frequency performance, the gate resistance becomes prohibitively high due to the
reduction of the area A. The implementation of T-shaped gates eﬃciently reduces
gate resistance through a larger metal (hat) on top of the short gate (foot). To
reduce additional parasitic capacitances, the distance between the hat and the
channel, or the height of the gate foot, needs to be as large as possible, though

386
Nitride-based electron devices
it is limited by mechanical stability of the T-gate. The gate-to-drain capacitance
in the saturation regime, given approximately by Cgd = 2ϵW/(1 + 2Xdep/Lg),
where Xdep is the extension of the depletion region [Ladbrooke89], can be reduced
by shrinking the gate foot Lg.
The shape of the T-gate has been improved, and high-aspect-ratio T-gates
have been demonstrated on both gallium polar (Ga-polar) and nitrogen polar
(N-polar) HEMTs. For example, a N-polar GaN/AlGaN MIS-HEMT has shown
an fMAX of 351 GHz [Denninghoﬀ12], where an Lg of 80 nm and 1.1-μm-tall
T-gates with a 370-nm-tall foot were used to simultaneously minimize gate res-
istance (Rg) and parasitic gate–drain capacitance (Cgd) [Denninghoﬀ12]. A more
aggressive scaling of the gate length combined with the optimization of contact
and access resistances pushed the limits of both fT and fMAX in nitride-based
HEMTs. A 40-nm-gate implemented on a AlN/GaN/AlGaN double heterojunc-
tion (DH) HEMT structure resulted in a peak fT of 220 GHz and a peak fMAX
of 400 GHz [Shinohara10]. Later, in 2011, Shinohara et al. set the state-of-the-
art DC and RF performance through a deeply scaled self-aligned gate operating
in both depletion mode (D-mode) and enhancement mode (E-mode). A 20-nm-
gate AlN/GaN/AlGaN double-heterojunction HEMT exhibited a simultaneous
fT /fMAX = 310/364 GHz (Fig. 11.15) [Shinohara11b].
Although the transistor gate length plays an important role in determining
the transistor operating frequency, as the frequency increases, other parameters
also become important and ultimately dominant. For example, in 2006 the use
of a 30-nm gate length in an Al0.4Ga0.6N/GaN HFET on sapphire substrate
was demonstrated [Higashiwaki06]. This HEMT structure showed a maximum
drain current density of 1.49 A/mm, and a peak extrinsic transconductance
of 402 mS/mm, yielding an fT /fMAX of 181/186 GHz. A high aspect ratio
was maintained by the 8-nm thick AlGaN barrier. More recently, a similar gate
length of 30 nm was applied to a lattice-matched In0.17Al0.83N/GaN HEMT
Fig. 11.15. (a) Deeply-scaled self-aligned gates of 35 nm and 20 nm were fab-
ricated on an AlN/GaN/AlGaN double-heterojunction HEMT. (b) Peak

on a SiC substrate with optimized access resistances and carrier conﬁnement,
yielding a much higher fT of 300 GHz due to the signiﬁcant reduction in parasitic
delays and short-channel eﬀects [Lee11a]. These results show the importance of
scaling the gate length to improve fT , but also highlight the need of combining
other technologies to eﬀectively reduce the parasitic resistances and capacitances.
The following sections address these technologies as well as the search for new
nitride-based barrier materials.
Barrier thickness scaling.
As the gate length is scaled, a suitable aspect ra-
tio (Lg/tb) needs to be maintained to avoid short-channel eﬀects and minimize
the output conductance. The recess of the AlGaN barrier under the gate re-
gion can be used to improve the aspect ratio and minimize short-channel eﬀects
[Ando03, Chini04]. However, dry etching the AlGaN barrier can induce damage
on the channel under the gate and degrade the mobility of the carriers. Also, dry
etching often yields a non-uniform recess across the wafer and therefore large
inhomogeneity on the device performance. New barrier materials with larger
polarization discontinuities than the traditional AlxGa1−xN (x < 0.35) allow
reduced barrier thicknesses, improved gate control over the electrons in the chan-
nel, and a subsequent improvement in short-channel eﬀects. Some of these new
barrier materials include In1-xAlxNy, AlN, AlxInyGa1-x-yN, and N-polar GaN. In
the following we discuss speciﬁc technologies applied to these materials yielding
state-of-the art performance.
InAlN/GaN.
The use of a GaN lattice-matched In0.17Al0.83N layer as an
alternative barrier for AlGaN/GaN-based HEMTs was ﬁrst proposed by
Kuzm´ık [Kuzm´ık01]. Its polarization-charge discontinuity to the underlying GaN
(ΔP0 = 2.73 × 1013 e · cm−2), solely due to spontaneous polarization, is almost
three times larger than in Al0.2Ga0.8N/GaN (ΔP0 = 1.18 × 1013 e · cm−2), which
accounts for both spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization ﬁelds. This al-
lows large 2DEG density from thinner barriers [Butte07, Lecourt11], which
enables excellent gate-to-channel aspect ratios down to very short gate-lengths.
The feasibility of ultrathin-barrier InAlN/GaN HEMTs was demonstrated in a
3-nm-thick InAlN barrier [Medjdoub08], with an outstanding stability at high
temperatures of up to 1000◦C [Medjdoub06]. This lattice-matched barrier also
potentially avoids reliability concerns associated with strain in the conventional
lattice-mismatched AlGaN/GaN heterostructures [Kuzm´ık09]. The eﬀect of bar-
rier strain on device reliability in transistors based on the InxAl1–xN/AlN/GaN
heterostructure has been investigated experimentally for both tensile and com-
pressive strain ﬁelds. While devices under tensile and compressive strain showed
large degradation and loss of drain current after electrical stress, the nearly-
lattice-matched In0.17Al0.83N barrier exhibited very low degradation along with
relatively high current density, suggesting better reliability of the nearly-lattice-
matched InAlN as barrier materials [Kayis12].
The frequency performance of InAlN/GaN HEMTs has improved signiﬁc-
antly over recent years. From the initial fT /fMAX of 26/40 GHz [Medjdoub07],

388
Nitride-based electron devices
Wang et al. reported lattice-matched InAlN/GaN HEMTs with an fT /fMAX of
82/161 GHz with a 100-nm gate-length and 25 nm Al2O3 passivation [Wang10].
By improving material quality, shrinking the gate length to 55 nm, and se-
lectively removing the passivation, the performance was increased to fT /fMAX
of 205/191 GHz [Sun10a, Sun10b]. However, despite these results the device
performance is still below the theoretical predictions. A signiﬁcant boost in fre-
quency performance was achieved by applying an O2 plasma treatment under the
gate [Lee11b]. These devices showed a more than two orders of magnitude reduc-
tion in the gate leakage and a 30%–50% increase in fT, resulting in fT = 245 GHz
for a gate length of 30 nm. The use of the O2 treatment in the device access
regions also improves the frequency performance by reducing the gate-length ex-
tension [Wang11a]. This resulted in an increase of fT from 125 to 210 GHz for a
60-nm rectangular gate with a high-DC drain-current density of 2.1 A/mm and
a peak extrinsic transconductance of 487 mS/mm.
The use of a thin layer of InGaN as back-barrier to the electrons in the chan-
nel increases the carrier conﬁnement, since the polarization ﬁeld in the InGaN
layer raises the conduction band in the GaN buﬀer with respect to the GaN
channel [Palacios06]. This improvement in conﬁnement and short-channel eﬀects
was demonstrated in devices with an In0.15Ga0.85N back-barrier and a 10-nm-
thick InAlN barrier on a 26-nm thick GaN channel. A peak fT of 300 GHz
with an on-resistance of 1.2 Ω · mm and an extrinsic transconductance gm.ext of
530 mS/mm [Lee11a] was obtained in devices with a 30-nm gate-length. While,
in principle, further scaling down the GaN channel thickness would also improve
carrier conﬁnement in the channel, in practice it degrades the carrier mobility in
the channel due to the proximity of the interface and alloy scattering caused by
the InGaN back barrier layer. This higher interface scattering caused a reduc-
tion of the eﬀective electron velocity from 1.45 × 107 cm/s to 1.16 × 107 cm/s
when thinning down the channel from 26 nm to 4 nm, degrading its frequency
performance [Lee11c].
AlN/GaN.
The AlN/GaN system allows for further reduction of the barrier
thickness while maintaining very high carrier densities at the heterostructure
interface. There has been great progress on the material quality [Binari97,
Alekseev99], resulting in electron sheet densities up to 3.65 × 1013 cm−2 along
with relatively high electron mobilities of 1460 cm2/V.s utilizing extremely thin
(5 nm) AlN layers [Smorchkova00]. The use of advanced fabrication techno-
logies in AlN/GaN HEMTs has led to the demonstration of record frequency
performances in these devices. First, Al2O3 gate dielectrics deposited by atomic-
layer deposition (ALD) have been used to reduce gate leakage in highly scaled
AlN/GaN MOS-HEMTs. An ultrathin 2-nm-thick Al2O3 dielectric and a gate
length of 40 nm reduced the forward-bias gate current by two orders of magnitude
without degrading the DC and RF performance [Corrion11]. In addition, the use
of AlGaN back-barrier and n+-GaN ohmic contacts regrown by MBE resulted in
better carrier conﬁnement and lower parasitic resistances, demonstrating a peak

fT /fMAX of 220/400 GHz in 40-nm-gate devices [Shinohara10]. The relatively
low fT compared to fMAX was limited by an excess drain delay associated with
the extended drain depletion at higher Vds. The reduction of the source–drain
distance down to 170 nm signiﬁcantly reduced the electron transit time at higher
Vds and enhanced the average electron velocity. This technology combined with
n+-GaN ohmic regrowth and Al0.08Ga0.92N back-barrier exhibited a small on-
resistance of 0.44 Ωmm, maximum drain current density of 2.3 A/mm, peak
extrinsic transconductance of 905 mS/mm, and a fT /fMAX of 260/394 GHz
with a 45-nm gate length [Shinohara11a]. Finally, a self-aligned gate technology
was developed to further enhance both DC and RF performance by simultan-
eously reducing the gate length to 20 nm and the source-drain distance to
100 nm, which further reduced drain delay and enhanced the electron velocity
to 1.5 × 107 cm/s. This resulted in Ron = 0.29 Ω · mm, Idmax = 2.7 A/mm and
a peak extrinsic gm = 1.04 S/mm. This technology was applied for both deple-
tion and enhancement mode devices exhibiting record frequency performances in
both operation modes. The depletion-mode device demonstrated a fT /fMAX of
310/364 GHz, and the enhancement-mode device showed a fT /fMAX of 343/236
GHz (Fig. 11.16) [Shinohara11b].
InAlGaN/GaN.
Nitride-based quaternary barriers have also attracted interest
recently, due to the challenge to obtain carrier mobilities in InAlN/GaN het-
erostructures at the level of those of other nitride-based heterostructures, such
as AlGaN/GaN or AlN/GaN. This limitation is believed to be due to inter-
face roughness scattering [Cao07], which is higher than in other GaN HEMTs
due to the immiscibility between AlN and InN [Takayama01]. InAlGaN quatern-
aries are expected to have a narrower immiscibility gap [Takayama01], which
is reﬂected in the high mobilities (>1700 cm2/Vs at ns = 1.8 × 1013 cm−2)
observed in lattice-matched In0.16Al0.74Ga0.10N/AlN/GaN heterostructures
[Ketteniss10].
Excellent performance has been demonstrated on In0.13Al0.83Ga0.04N/AlN/
GaN transistors on SiC substrates. These devices show a drain-current density of
2.1 A/mm, a peak extrinsic transconductance of 548 mS/mm, and a high fT of
220 GHz with a 66-nm gate-length. This high-frequency performance is the result
of high electron mobility (1790 cm2/Vs) at a carrier density of 1.8 × 1013 cm−2
[Wang11b].
N-polar GaN.
While several methods have been investigated to reduce the
ohmic contact resistance for Ga-face AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, it has been diﬃ-
cult to achieve values lower than 200 Ωμm.1 N-polar GaN oﬀers the possibility
of achieving very low contact resistance values, since the contacts are not made
1Recently, very-low-contact resistances have been obtained in Ga-face devices by etching
away the AlGaN barrier and regrowing n+-GaN contacts, yielding contact resistances down to
50 Ωμm· [Guo12].

through a wide-band-gap barrier material such as AlGaN [Rajan07]. The high
electron densities (1 × 1013 cm−2) of metal–InN ohmic combined with a graded
InxGa1-xN layer between the GaN channel and surface InN resulted in an ultra-
low ohmic contact resistance of 27 Ω·μm [Dasgupta10]. Moreover, the reversed
polarization ﬁelds of N-polar GaN/Al(In,Ga)N oﬀers other advantages over Ga-
polar Al(In,Ga)N/GaN HEMTs, such as improved electron conﬁnement [Park11]
and ﬂexibility to scale the gate-to-2DEG distance without changing the charge
density in the 2DEG, as the Al(In,Ga)N barrier in N-polar devices is on the
backside of the 2DEG. The frequency performance of N-polar GaN HEMTs has
rapidly improved [Nidhi09, Nidhi10] with a demonstrated fMAX of 351 GHz
[Denninghoﬀ12] and fT of 163 GHz [Nidhi11]. These results were achieved
through the combination of gate-length scaling, reduction of vertical gate-to-
channel distance and the lateral access region, and minimization of parasitic
access resistance and capacitance (see Fig. 11.17).
Power ampliﬁers.
Large breakdown voltage, high carrier concentration and
mobility, and excellent thermal and chemical stability make nitride transistors
ideal for high-performance power ampliﬁers. Nitride-based HEMTs on SiC sub-
strates oﬀer more than one order of magnitude higher power densities than any
other semiconductor technology. 41.4 W/mm of output power density has been
demonstrated with a power-added eﬃciency (PAE) of 60% at 2 GHz [Wu06].
In addition, the smaller size of GaN RF transistors, compared to Si or GaAs
devices, signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes circuit design and impedance matching.
The availability of resistive silicon susbtrates (resistivity above 1kΩ·cm)
makes possible the development of III-nitride RF devices on this substrate
[Cordier02]. GaN HEMTs on silicon oﬀer a lower-cost solution to high-eﬃciency
power ampliﬁcation below the X band. As in the case of GaN HEMTs on SiC
substrates, there has been a steady improvement in device performance. By
2002, saturated power densities of less than 2 W/mm at 2 GHz had been ob-
tained. In 2003, 6.6 W/mm [Betash03], and in 2004, 12 W/mm [Johnson04],
were demonstrated at 2 GHz, while in 2006, 5.1 W/mm were reported at 18 GHz
[Ducatteau06].
Power generation at mm and sub-mm wave frequencies represent the next
challenge for GaN power ampliﬁers. The combination of high-frequency perform-
ance, described in the previous sections, with the high breakdown and current
capability of GaN devices, has allowed the recent demonstration of impresive
results at these frequencies. For example, at Ka-band, 10 W/mm at 40 GHz
have been measured with PAE of 33% [Palacios05]. W-band GaN monolithic
microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) with output an power of an 842 mW at
88 GHz in continuous wave operation [Micovic10] have been recently demon-
strated, which represents 96% more power than the highest power reported for
the best competing solid-state technology based on InP [Chen98, Samoska11].
More recently, a state-of-the-art 1.7 W, W-band power ampliﬁer MMICs with
power added eﬃciencies in excess of than 20%, and a small signal gain of 21 dB

392
Nitride-based electron devices
has been demonstrated. This was achieved through the use of a 150-nm T-gate
GaN HEMT with an output power exceeding 300 mW and a peak-power added
eﬃciency (PAE) of 37% [Brown11]. By combining twelve GaN MMICs in a low-
loss radialline combiner network, a W-band solid-state power ampliﬁer with an
output power of 5.2W at 95 GHz has been achieved with an overall combined
eﬃciency of 8.75% [Schellenberg10].
11.4.2
Lateral GaN high-voltage power transistors
In addition to RF applications, the unique properties of GaN-based HEMTs
have also attracted great interest in high-voltage power-switching applications,
where the transistors are switched between their oﬀand on states, as shown in
Fig. 11.18. These devices are the centerpiece of power electronic circuits.
Two important parameters of a power-switching transistor are the oﬀ-state
blocking voltage (BV ), also known as breakdown voltage (VBr), and on-state
resistance (Ron), many times given as the speciﬁc on-resistance, Ron·A, to take
into account the total area of the transistor (A).
The breakdown voltage of AlGaN/GaN high-voltage HEMTs has been stead-
ily improved over the years. In 2001 the ﬁrst 1 kV AlGaN/GaN HEMT grown on
semi-insulating SiC substrate was reported [N.-Q. Zhang01a] with Ron·A of only
3.4 mΩ·cm2. In 2006, 1.6 kV breakdown voltage was reported in an AlGaN/GaN
HEMT grown on sapphire substrate [Tipirneni06]. In the same year, the break-
down voltage of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT grown on SiC reached up to 1.9 kV,
with Ron·A as low as 2.2 mΩ·cm2 [Dora06a]. In 2012, Lee et al. demonstrated
InAlN/GaN HEMTs grown on SiC with a breakdown voltage of 3 kV and a spe-
ciﬁc on-resistance of 4.3 mΩ·cm2 [Lee12], while Sun et al. fabricated AlGaN/GaN
HEMTs with a breakdown of 1.8 kV and Ron·A equal to 1.9 mΩ·cm2 [Sun12].
These encouraging results, many times better than conventional Si devices, have
demonstrated the great potential of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs as the next generation
of power switches.

the speciﬁc resistance of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure decreases at low
voltages due to the impact of the contact resistances, which has not been
taken into account in the vertical structures (Si, 4H-SiC, and Bulk GaN).
The theoretical speciﬁc on-resistance Ron·A as a function of breakdown
voltage VBr (FOM in Section 11.1) of Si, SiC, and GaN power transistors is

For lateral AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, the limit of speciﬁc on-resistance can be cal-

between the gate and drain [Tipirneni06, N.-Q. Zhang01a], and the on-resistance

ical AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with sheet resistance of 400 Ω/square and contact
resistance of 0.5 Ω·mm oﬀer a 2–3 orders-of-magnitude reduction of speciﬁc on-
resistance compared to Si, and better performance than SiC. At lower voltages

Nitride-based electron devices
the contact resistance of lateral AlGaN/GaN HEMTs starts to play a bigger role
in the on-resistance than in the Si and SiC vertical devices.
Due to the low cost and large size of Si wafers, AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown
on Si(111) substrates promise to reduce the cost of GaN devices. Since the
demonstration of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on 100-mm-diameter Si(111) substrate in
2002 [Brown02], substantial progress has been achieved. 6-inch GaN-on-Si wafers
have now been made available commercially and recently AlGaN/GaN HEMT
structures have also been demonstrated on 200-mm-diameter Si(111) substrate
[Cheng12].
In addition to the buﬀer and gate leakage currents, the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
on Si substrates have an additional leakage path through the conductive Si sub-
strate when compared with AlGaN/GaN HEMTs grown on insulating sapphire
[Fontser`e13] and semi-insulating SiC substrates, as illustrated in Fig. 11.20. This
drain-to-substrate leakage causes the breakdown voltage to saturate at large
gate-to-drain separations, at which the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs reach the max-
imum breakdown voltage [Visalli09, Lu10a]. The limitation of the Si substrate
on the maximum device breakdown voltage can be overcome by transferring
the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs from the Si substrate onto an insulating substrate
[Lu10b, Srivastava10], after which a 1.5 kV breakdown voltage can be achieved
from devices with an original breakdown voltage of less than 600 V [Lu10b].
However, this removal of the Si substrate can potentially increase fabrication
cost and device thermal resistance.
The breakdown voltage of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs Si substrates is closely re-
lated to the wafer growth conditions. For example, screw dislocations have been
shown to increase the leakage of GaN devices [McCarthy01b, Hsu02], and ni-
trogen vacancies and impurity donors have also been proposed for the origin
of n-type background doping in GaN [Neugebauer94, Look03]. Several wafer-
growth technologies have been developed to improve the breakdown voltage of
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Deep-level, such as iron and carbon, doping have been
used to compensate for the unintentional n-type background doping in GaN to
reduce the buﬀer leakage current [Choi06, Kato07]. The growth of thick buf-
fer layers on Si substrates has also proven to be an eﬀective way to improve
gate leakage

device breakdown voltage [Iwakami07, Ikeda08, Selvaraj09, Visalli09, Rowena11].
The thick buﬀer layer reduces the screw dislocations and increases the GaN
epi-layer vertical resistance, thus reducing the substrate leakage current and
increasing breakdown voltage [Rowena11]. Combining the C-doping and a 6-
μm-thick buﬀer structure, AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on 4-inch Si substrate have
reached a high breakdown voltage of 1.8 kV [Ikeda08]. However, the growth
of a thick III-n buﬀer on Si substrate can cause large wafer bow and cracking in
the GaN ﬁlm, due to the large lattice and thermal mismatch, while the incorpor-
ation of carbon and iron in the buﬀer can cause carrier-trapping in AlGaN/GaN
HEMTs [Klein01, Rudzinski06, Ramdani12], increasing the device on-resistance.
Due to these issues, achieving high-breakdown-voltage AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on
Si substrate is still one of the most challenging problems in GaN power devices.
Trapping and dynamic on-resistance.
Device instability related to current
collapse, DC-RF dispersion, or poor dynamic on-resistance has limited the per-
formance of GaN devices over the last few years. As shown in Fig. 11.21, the
current collapse or dynamic on-resistance characterizes the degradation of tran-
sistor performance under high-stress (high drain and/or gate bias) switching
(pulsing or high-frequency continuous wave operation) conditions compared to
low-stress DC conditions.

However, these systems cannot reproduce the complex waveforms used in
power electronics. In order to extract device dynamic on-resistance in the
large drain-voltage swing, a voltage-clamping sensing circuit can be used
[Lu11].
Charge-trapping in deep levels in the buﬀer and in surface states of the ni-
tride semiconductor (Fig. 11.22) has been the most widely accepted explanation
for the origin of current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs [Klein01, Rudzinski06,
Binari01, Vetury01, Koley03, Verzellesi05]. For GaN buﬀer with deep traps, when
the device is biased at high drain-source voltage, the buﬀer traps are ﬁlled by
high-energy channel electrons. The resultant negatively charged traps therefore
deplete the 2DEG in the channel, causing current collapse and DC-RF dispersion
[Klein00, 01]. For the surface-trapping, the most accepted model is the theory of
a “virtual gate” [Vetury01] formed between the gate and drain of AlGaN/GaN
HEMTs by electrons tunneling from the gate to the surface at high drain-to-gate
bias conditions [Green00, Vetury01, Koley03]. Similarly, the electrons can also be
trapped inside the AlGaN barrier layer [Mitrofanov04, Joh11]. Several deep trap
levels corresponding to the slow transient of device turn-on/oﬀcurrent have been
extracted [Vertiatchikh02, Mizutani03a-b, Mitrofanov04, Tapajna10, Joh11].
However, the exact origin of these trap levels is not completely understood
yet. A recent study has shown the improvement of pulsed I–V performance
of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs when measured in vacuum [Pei09], suggesting the
inﬂuence of ambient air on device-trapping. Indeed, Gao et al. showed that
water vapor in the air can cause signiﬁcant current collapse in AlGaN/GaN
[Gao12] HEMTs, which may lead to reconsideration of the conventional surface
electron-trapping model.
Surface passivation technology has been developed to prevent the form-
ation of a “virtual gate” on the surface and reduce the trapping eﬀects in
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. While several dielectric materials have been studied
[Green00, Lu09, Arulkumaran04], SixNy has been the most widely used pas-
sivation layer. The actual mechanism by which the surface SixNy passivation
works has not been completely understood yet. For the surface passivation, some

of the current hypotheses include the prevention of electrons from reaching
the semiconductor surface [Vetury01, Koley03], reduction of trap-state density
[Vertiatchikh02, Hashizume01], and change of surface donor states [Vetury01].
A recent study has also shown that the hydrophobic property of SixNy plays an
important role in the reduction of current collapse [Gao12]. Alternative passiv-
ation methods have also been developed, such as using a p-GaN cap layer or a
very thick GaN cap layer to screen and reduce the surface potential ﬂuctuation
[Coﬃe02, Shen04].
There is a trade-oﬀbetween passivation and breakdown voltage in AlGaN/
GaN HEMTs. Negative charge trapped in surface states helps to compensate
for the positive charge in the depletion region between the gate and drain in
the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs in oﬀ-state, reducing the peak electric ﬁeld and in-
creasing the breakdown voltage [N.-Q. Zhang01b, Tan02]. When the surface of
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is passivated with dielectrics such as SixNy, the electric
ﬁeld at the gate edge increases, which also enhances the gate leakage and reduces
the breakdown voltage of the transistors. In order to reduce the high electric ﬁeld
at the gate edge, various gate and source ﬁeld-plate structures have been used
[N.-Q. Zhang00, Saito03, Xing04, Saito07], as shown in Fig. 11.23. Combining
the surface passivation and ﬁeld-plates, high-voltage AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with
more than 600 V breakdown and low trapping eﬀects can be achieved [Saito07].
Normally-oﬀGaN devices.
Due to the high charge density induced by the
polarization diﬀerence at the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, these HEMTs are
typically depletion-mode (D-mode or normally-on) devices. However, normally-
oﬀenhancement-mode (E-mode) transistors are easier to drive by external
circuits, and are highly desirable in power electronics applications due to safety
considerations.

plasma treatment, (b) p-type gate, (c) surface potential engineering, and (d)

Fluorine-based plasma treatment underneath the gate region has been used
to make E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMTs [Cai05, Chu11], as shown in Fig. 11.24(a).
The negatively-charged ﬂuorine ions F−implanted into the AlGaN layer from
the ﬂuorine-based plasma deplete the 2DEG in the channel, converting the
D-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT into an E-mode device [Yuan08]. Although Mizuno
et al. [Mizuno07] showed the F−plasma treated E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMTs
are stable at 200◦C, other reports have observed negative shifts in the threshold
voltage with increasing temperature [Wang09]. Threshold voltage instability
after high ﬁeld stress and gate over-drive conditions have also been reported in
these devices [Yi07, Ma10]. Other than the ﬂuorine plasma, E-mode AlGaN/GaN
HEMTs by hydrogen-plasma treatment have also been demonstrated, though
they show similar instability issues [Lu09].
Another type of normally-oﬀE-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT is the p-GaN,
p-AlGaN or p-InGaN gate AlGaN/GaN transistor [Hu00, Suh06, Uemoto07,
Shimizu08], shown in Fig. 11.24(b). Due to the built-in potential between the
p-type gate and the channel, the 2DEG underneath the gate is depleted at zero
gate bias, forming the E-mode transistor. In these devices the trade-oﬀbetween

the 2DEG density in the device access region and the threshold voltage needs to
be considered. High 2DEG density with low access resistance outside the gate
results in low threshold voltage, while high threshold voltage results in high ac-
cess resistance. Due to the large forward gate leakage current when the gate
p/n junction is turned-on, these devices also have limited gate voltage swing. As
a result, threshold voltage above 1 V and high current density are diﬃcult to
achieve in this structure.
A third approach for fabricating E-mode devices is based on engineering
the surface potential of the transistor structure [Ohmaki06, Higashiwaki07,
Medjdoub10], as shown in Fig. 11.24(c). It has been observed that the deposition
of a thin dielectric on the surface of AlGaN/GaN HEMT increases the 2DEG
density [Green00, Arulkumaran04]. The E-mode devices using this method have
a very thin AlN or AlGaN barrier layer where the 2DEG is formed only after
the deposition of such a surface passivation dielectric layer. Since no passivation
dielectric is underneath the gate, the channel remains depleted. The limitation
of this technology is its marginal positive threshold voltage and very low voltage
swing.
Since the 2DEG in the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is induced by the net polar-
ization ﬁeld in the AlGaN barrier [Ibbetson00], recess-etching of the AlGaN
barrier in the gate region depletes the 2DEG in the channel and shifts the
device threshold voltage into positive values [Lanford05, Saito06], as shown
in Fig. 11.24(d). There has been great progress in recessed-gate E-mode
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Combing the gate recess with gate dielectric, devices
with threshold voltage larger than 2 V have been demonstrated [Oka08,
Kanamura10, Lu10c]. The recessed-gate metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs
(MIS-HEMTs) have high drain current density [Kanamura10, Im10, Lu10c], due
to their large forward gate-bias capability. One of the major concerns of this
approach is, however, the impact of the timed dry-etching step on the threshold
voltage uniformity. A new AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure has been proposed to
improve this uniformity [Ota09].
Another challenge of recessed-gate E-mode AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs is the
degradation of channel electron mobility, which makes the channel resistance the
major contribution of the total device resistance. In order to reduce the channel
resistance and maintain high breakdown voltage, a dual-gate structure has been
proposed where a short-channel recessed-gate E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT is
connected to a long-channel D-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMT [Lu10c] (Fig. 11.25).
Since the E-mode channel length is short, its impact on the total resistance of
the combined structure is reduced. The depletion of the channel underneath the
long-channel D-mode gate helps to shield the E-mode short channel from high
drain voltage, improving the breakdown voltage. However, the short-channel E-
mode region is very sensitive to the electrostatic integrity of the entire device
design. The oﬀ-state leakage can be large if the short-channel gate is not well
shielded from the drain voltage. To solve this problem, a 3D tri-gate structure has
been recently proposed in E-mode AlGaN/GaN HEMTs [Lu12] (Fig. 11.26). Due

to excellent channel control, very-low-leakage current (<1μA/mm) high-voltage
normally-oﬀAlGaN/GaN HEMT can be realized.

Vertical GaN power transistors
In spite of the excellent performance demonstrated by GaN HEMT transistors
in power applications, their current density, reliability, and cost is limited by
the poor scalability of lateral structures. This has motivated several groups
to develop vertical GaN transistors, and this work has leveraged the rapid
development of GaN bulk substrates used for GaN laser diodes and GaN
high-power LEDs.

Diﬀerent device structures have been studied, such as GaN trench-gate
MOSFETs [Otake07, 08, Kodama08], GaN vertical HEMTs [Yaegashi11], and
GaN-CAVETs (current aperture vertical electron transistors) [Ben-Yaacov04,
Kanechika07]. This section will discuss in detail the device structures and
characteristics of GaN-CAVETs and GaN trench-gate MOSFETs.
CAVET.
GaN-CAVETs are similar in structure to conventional Si-DMOSFETs
(double-diﬀused metal-oxide semiconductors) (Fig. 11.27). The high-electric-ﬁeld
region of a GaN-CAVET is below the gate electrode instead of at the surface
(as in a GaN HEMT), so a higher breakdown voltage is expected compared with
conventional GaN-HEMTs (Fig. 11.27b, right). Also, as the high electric ﬁeld
peaks far from the surface where the surface states are, dispersion-free devices
are expected [Chowdhury12].
The standard device fabrication process ﬂow and schematic device structure
of a GaN-CAVET are shown in Fig. 11.28. First, an n+-GaN layer with
∼1018 cm−3 doping is grown on a c-plane sapphire substrate by MOCVD. This
layer will become the drain contact of the device. For this, an n+-GaN substrate
can also be used [Chowdhury12]. An n-GaN drift layer is then grown with a
doping density around ∼1016 cm−3, followed by an n-GaN current spreading
layer with a doping in the ∼1017 cm−3 range. Then, a Ti/Ni metal layer on
PECVD SiO2 is deposited as a hard mask to deﬁne the aperture size, and Mg
ions are implanted to form the current blocking layer (CBL). Typical conditions
for this ion implantation are an energy of 50 keV and a dose of 1 × 1015 cm−2.
The size and doping density of the aperture region strongly aﬀects the total
resistance of the GaN-CAVET. The Ti/Ni and SiO2 hard masks are then

removed by wet etching, and the unintentionally-doped (uid)-GaN access region
and (AlN) and AlGaN barriers are then regrown on this implanted wafer by
MOCVD. During the regrowth, Mg ions have been reported to diﬀuse into the
regrown AlGaN/(AlN)/GaN layer, which degrades the transport properties of
the channel and shifting the threshold voltage. To prevent this diﬀusion the
AlGaN/GaN structure can be grown at low temperature by molecular beam
epitaxy [Chowdhury12]. A thin layer of carbon-doped GaN is also grown at the
regrowth interface in order to compensate for the residual Si-doping typically
seen at this interface and which causes leakage current.
The ohmic contacts in these devices are typically formed by Si ion implanta-
tion to prevent the metal spikes seen in alloyed contacts [Dora06b], which could
cause a short through the current-blocking layer. When a foreign substrate is

used, an etching step is required to form the drain contact on the drain layer.
Usually, Cl2-based reactive ion etching (RIE) is used to etch III-nitrides. The
mesa isolation also uses the same gas system. Ti/Al/Ni contacts are deposited
as the source and drain contacts, while a Ni/Au/Ni metal stack has been used
for the gate electrode. To demonstrate an E-mode CAVET, the wafer is exposed
to CF4 plasma before gate-metal deposition [Chowdhury08]. Also, to reduce the
gate leakage current, a CAVET with SiN gate insulator deposited by MOCVD
has been reported [Chowdhury12].
The DC and pulsed Ids–Vds characteristics of a D-mode GaN-CAVET are
shown in Fig. 11.29(a). The maximum drain current density (Imax) and the
extrinsic transconductance (gm) were 5.6 × 103 A/cm2 and 54 mS/mm, respect-
ively, while the pinch-oﬀvoltage (Vp) of the device was −2 V. The DC-RF
dispersion of this device was relatively small, because the AlGaN surface was not
exposed to a high electric ﬁeld. The transfer characteristics (Ids–Vgs) of the GaN-
CAVET with diﬀerent CF4 plasma exposure times are shown in Fig. 11.29(b).
The corresponding threshold voltages (Vth) were −1.5, −0.5, and 0.6 V, for no
plasma, and 5 and 10 min plasma exposure, respectively.
GaN vertical MOSFET.
There are at least two types of GaN trench-gate
MOSFETs: V-shaped [Otake08] and U-shaped [Kodama08]. The schematic cross-
sectional structure of the V- and U-shape GaN vertical MOSFET is shown in
Fig. 11.30. The most important advantage of these GaN vertical MOSFETs as
compared to the CAVET is their intrinsic E-mode operation (threshold voltage
>3 V). On the other hand, it is very challenging to form a damage-free MOS
interface by using Cl2-based dry chemistry to form the gate trench.
For the fabrication of GaN vertical MOSFETs, the n-GaN drift layer and the
p-GaN channel layer are grown on an n+-GaN substrate by MOCVD. There are

two diﬀerent ways to form the n-GaN source layer: a) direct growth, and b) Si ion
implantation. In the case of Si ion implantation, Si ions are implanted into the p-
GaN layer to form n+-GaN source region. Then an activation annealing process
is performed at around 950◦C in N2 atmosphere. The trench structure is formed
by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching with Cl-based gases (Cl2/SiCl4,
Cl2/BCl3). The slope of the trench walls can be changed with the etching condi-
tions. The source ohmic metal deposition and annealing processes are typically
done before the trench fabrication in order to protect the GaN sidewalls from
the high-temperature process. To form the U-shape vertical GaN-MOSFETs, a
TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydride)-based wet etching at 85◦C is used after
the dry etching of a V-shape trench to obtain the smooth m-plane surface. Two
diﬀerent gate dielectrics have been reported for these structures: a) a 100-nm-
thick SixNy ﬁlm deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD);
and b) a double-layered structure consisting of 1-nm SixNy/100-nm SiO2 depos-
ited by electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) plasma deposition. The role of the
1-nm SixNy layer is to stabilize the trench surface. Al-based metals deposited
by electron-beam evaporator or plasma-assisted sputtering deposition are widely
used for source and drain electrodes. As the gate electrode, Ni/Au ﬁlm depos-
ited by e-beam evaporator and phosphorous-doped polysilicon ﬁlm deposited by
LP-CVD have been reported.
The transfer characteristics (Ids–Vgs) of V-shaped and U-shaped GaN vertical
MOSFETs are shown in Fig. 11.31. Both structures show enhancement-mode
operation. The measured threshold voltages of V-shaped and U-shaped GaN
vertical MOSFET are 3.7 V and 10 V. However, the calculated threshold voltages
for the V-shaped and U-shaped GaN vertical MOSFET are around 20 V and
40 V, respectively, from the acceptor density in the p-GaN channel layer. This

diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical values is due to the existence of
a parasitic n-type layer at the sidewalls of the gate trench due to the generation
of N-vacancies and/or etch damage. The net doping density in that region is
therefore very diﬀerent from that in bulk p-GaN. Figure 11.32 shows the DC
characteristics for the V-shaped devices. A channel mobility of 131 cm2/(V·s)

can be extracted from these measurements. This low value signiﬁcantly increases
the total on-resistance. The drain current and on-resistance at Vds = 1 V and
Vgs = 12 V are 33.2 mA and 9.3 mΩ·cm2. The breakdown voltage of a vertical-
trench GaN-MOSFET is determined by the acceptor density in the p-GaN
channel layer, the thickness of p-GaN channel layer, the donor density in the
n-GaN drift layer, the thickness of the n-GaN drift layer, and the gate oxide
thickness. The drain breakdown voltage of U-shaped GaN vertical MOSFETs at
a gate voltage 0 V is 180 V (Fig. 11.32, right). The strong increase in the gate
current at the breakdown voltage indicates that the breakdown is occurring at
the gate region. The on-resistance in this device is below 10 mΩ·cm2.

Conclusion
During the past few years, GaN electronics has undergone very important de-
velopments in terms of frequency and power capability. Starting with simple
structures made of GaN, p-i-n and Schottky diodes conﬁrmed the great poten-
tional of III-nitrides for power applications. The good control of the growth of
InGaN alloys has made possible the fabrication of heterojunction bipolar tran-
sistors with improved performance. At the same time, high-electron-mobility
transistors based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, ultrathin-barrier AlN/GaN
and AlInN/GaN heterostructures show impressive performance in terms of
breakdown voltages and operation frequencies. Even tunnel transport devices
such as resonant tunneling diodes and devices based on the Gunn eﬀect are
quickly improving in performance due to advances in the growth, device struc-
ture, and fabrication technology of all these GaN-based electronic devices.
However, in spite of all these promising results, the material quality is still
severely limiting the maximum performance of GaN electronics. The use of AlN
and GaN bulk substrates, which are quickly being developed for the optoelec-
tronics market, oﬀer new opportunities for achieving the ultimate performance
of GaN electronics.

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional
nitrides

Introduction
Intersubband transitions (ISB) are resonant optical transitions between conﬁned
states of semiconductor heterostructures either in the conduction band or in the
valence band. They were ﬁrst observed in the 1970s at far-infrared wavelengths
in Si accumulation layers [Kamg 74]. In 1985, West and Eglash reported the ob-
servation of 10-μm wavelength ISB absorption in GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As quantum
wells (QW) [West 85]. This was made possible by the progress of epitaxial growth
techniques allowing atomic-layer control of layer thicknesses. In the pioneering
work of West and Eglash, it was shown that ISB transitions are characterized by
a large optical dipole moment, whose length scales like the QW thickness, and
that the resonant wavelength can be tailored in a wide spectral range through a
proper choice of the layer thickness. During the ensuing years, extensive invest-
igations led to the demonstration of ISB transitions in various material systems,
such as InGaAs/AlInAs, InAs/AlSb, or SiGe/Si in the form of QWs [Paie 06],
but also quantum dots (QD) [Sauv 97, Webe 99]. The interest was motivated
by fundamental aspects but even more by the development of a new class of
control-by-design optoelectronic devices such as, for example, focal-plane arrays
of quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIP) [Levi 87] or quantum cascade
lasers (QCL) [Fais 94].
Using conventional III–V semiconductors, the operation wavelength of ISB
devices such as QWIPs or QCLs can be tuned from the mid-infrared to the THz
spectral range. Operation at short wavelengths is limited by the material
transparency and by the available conduction-band oﬀset (∼0.35 eV for dir-
ect gap GaAs/AlGaAs and ∼0.52 eV for lattice-matched InGaAs/InAlAs). To
access the near-infrared spectral domain and in particular the 1.3−1.55-μm
wavelength range used for ﬁber-optics telecommunications, materials with a
band oﬀset above 1.5 eV are required. There are only few semiconductor sys-
tems capable of producing ISB transitions at telecommunication wavelengths:
namely, InGaAs/AlAs(Sb) [Neog 99, Hira 94], ZnSe/BeTe [Akim 01, Akim 02],
CdS/ZnSe/BeTe [Li 06a, Cong 07], GaInAsN/AlAs [Ma 07] and GaN/Al(Ga)N
[Suzu 99, Gmac 00, Kish 02b, Helm 03b]. Among these materials, nitride semi-
conductors have shown the highest potential for device applications. This is
due to their remarkable properties, such as a high conduction-band oﬀset
(∼1.75 eV for AlN/GaN) [Tche 06b] and their remote lateral valleys, as well

as an ultra-short ISB absorption recovery time of the order of 140–400 fs
[Iizu 00, Hebe 02, Hama 04, Hama 05, Wang 05, Wang 06], which is ten times
faster than in InGaAs QWs [Iizu 00, Hira 94]. However, in order to reach short
infrared wavelengths, ultrathin layers are required because of the rather large
electron eﬀective mass in nitrides. This explains why the development of ni-
tride ISB devices has been crucially dependent on the progress in the epitaxial
growth techniques of these materials with atomic-layer thickness control; namely,
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD). Finally, in addition to short-infrared-wavelength ISB devices, III-
nitrides are ﬁnding appealing applications in the THz frequency domain because
of their large optical phonon energy.
This chapter presents an overview of the physics and device applications
of ISB transitions in III-nitrides. It is organized along the following lines.
Section 12.2 addresses the theoretical aspects of nitride ISB transitions. Section
12.3 reviews the spectroscopic investigations of ISB transitions in QWs and QDs
as well as polar, semipolar, and cubic nitrides. Sections 12.4–12.6 recast the
present state-of-the-art of nitride ISB devices for optical modulation, detection,
and light-emission.
12.2
Intersubband transitions in nitride heterostructures:
theoretical aspects
First, theoretical study of ISB transitions in GaN/Al(Ga)N QWs was performed
by Suzuki et al. [Suzu 97]. The authors have predicted the possibility of tun-
ing the ISB transition energy to the telecommunication wavelengths and to
achieve 1.55 μm for 1.3–1.5-nm-thick GaN QWs with barriers containing at
least 80% Al. Electron scattering rates have been calculated [Suzu 98] show-
ing that for a 1.5-nm-thick GaN/Al0.8Ga0.2N QW the dominant mechanism
for ISB relaxation is the interaction with longitudinal-optical phonons with a
characteristic time of ∼100 fs. The carrier thermalization to the subband min-
imum (intrasubband relaxation) is due to electron–phonon, electron–electron,
and electron-impurity scattering, and is as fast as ∼10 fs. The quantum con-
ﬁnement in GaN/Al(Ga)N heterostructures have been further simulated by
diﬀerent authors [Kish 02b, Kish 02a, Suzu 03, Iizu 02, Hosh 02]. Kishino et al.
[Kish 02b, Kish 02a] have calculated the ISB energy e12 in a GaN/AlN QW as
a function of its thickness using the eﬀective-mass approximation. This study
allowed evidence for a strong impact of the internal electric ﬁeld on the trans-
ition energy in large QWs, and to calculate a lower limit for the ISB wavelength
equal to 1.07 μm. Similar calculations by Iizuka et al. [Iizu 02], taking the elec-
tric ﬁeld in the well as a ﬁtting parameter, allowed estimation of its value as
5–6 MV/cm. Hoshino et al. [Hosh 02] showed that the ISB energy increases
when increasing the internal ﬁeld. Finally, Suzuki et al. [Suzu 03] have performed
self-consistent calculations by solving Schr¨odinger–Poisson equations accounting
for the non-parabolicity of the conduction band of GaN.

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
In the following, we expose the theoretical framework used for the description
of ISB transitions in nitride heterostructures.
12.2.1
Eﬀective-mass approximation
The basic optical properties of ISB transitions can be derived using the en-
velope function formalism [Bast 81, Whit 81, Bast 82]. This formalism is less
general than ab initio
methods, and its validity is limited to the vicinity of
high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. However, due to the ﬂexibility and
the relative computational simplicity of this model it is widely used to describe
the quantum conﬁnement in semiconductor heterostructures. In the envelope-
function approximation, the wavefunction is developed over the basis formed by
the periodic components of the Bloch functions of the bulk material, and then
only a small number of terms corresponding to the nearest energy bands is re-
tained. In this way, the wavefunction component varying slowly on the crystal-cell
scale–the envelope function–is separated from the rapidly varying component:
ϕ(r) =

i
ui,k=0(r)ψi(r),
(12.1)
where ui,k=0(r) is the periodic part of the Bloch function at the center of an
energy band i, and ψi(r) is the corresponding envelope function.
To describe the ISB transitions, the sum can be often limited to only one
energy band—the so-called eﬀective-mass approximation [BenD 66].
The envelope function satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation:
	
−ℏ2
2 ∇


M ∗(r)

∇+ UH(r)

ψ(r) = Eψ(r),
where UH(r) is the heterostructure potential and

is the inverse eﬀective

For the QW case, the translational invariance in the (x, y) layer plane allows fac-
torization of the envelope function into plane waves in the x and y direction and
z-dependent envelope function ψl(r) =
1
√
S eik||·r||Ψl(z), where k|| and r|| are the
wavevector and the coordinate in the layer plane, and S is the considered crystal
surface. The function Ψ(z) satisﬁes the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation:

12.2.2
Band non-parabolicity
The inﬂuence of other energy bands induces a non-parabolicity of the energy
dependence on the wavevector k [Nels 87, Bast 81, Bast 82, Leav 91, Sirt 94].
Despite the high band-gap of GaN, implying a weak coupling between the con-
duction and the valence bands, the non-parabolicity eﬀect in GaN/AlN QWs
is important for near-infrared ISB transitions [Tche 06b]. The non-parabolicity
mainly impacts the excited states in the heterostructure, and reduces the ISB
transition energy with respect to the parabolic case.
To obtain a correct prediction of the energy levels, the conﬁnement in ni-
tride heterostructures can be described using the 8-band k·p model [Kand 08].
However, this approach is computationally heavy. Alternatively, the non-
parabolicity eﬀect can be accounted for by using a simpliﬁed model with the
energy-dependent eﬀective mass [Tche 06b]. For GaN/AlN heterostructures with
the layer plane perpendicular to the c-axis, the following expression for the
energy-dependent eﬀective mass in GaN was proposed [Vard 09]:
m∗(E) = 0.22m0(1 + 0.068E + 0.003E2),
(12.3)
where E is an energy in eV, measured from the conduction band edge.
12.2.3
Hartree approximation
To induce ISB absorption in a heterostructure, the fundamental energy state
must be populated with carriers. This is achieved by doping the active region.
For doped structures, the model of one electron in an empty conduction band
is no longer valid. In particular, one should take into account the Coulomb
interaction of electrons with ionized donors as well as between free carriers.
These phenomena can be introduced via the Hartree approximation, in which
the Coulomb interactions between individual carriers are replaced by an aver-
age electrostatic potential. The energy levels and the corresponding envelope
functions are calculated by solving self-consistently the Schr¨odinger and Poisson
equations:

Internal electric ﬁeld
GaN/AlN heterostructures grown in the polar direction sustain large internal
electric ﬁelds in the layers induced by the diﬀerence of the spontaneous and
piezoelectric polarization between the well and barrier materials [Bern 97]. The
polarization discontinuity gives rise to bound charges of opposite sign at each
interface and consequently to an internal electric ﬁeld of opposite sign in the well
and barrier layers. For a thin layer of GaN within an AlN matrix, the internal
ﬁeld in the GaN well can be as large as 10 MV/cm.
As illustrated in Fig. 12.1, the heterostructure potential UH(z) in nitride QWs
has a saw tooth shape given by:
UH(z) =
eFw(z −z1)

where Fw (Fb) is the electric ﬁeld in the QW (barrier), ΔEc is the conduction
band oﬀset, and the coordinates zi are deﬁned by the heterostructure geometry.
In the case of nitride superlattices, the internal electric ﬁeld is often calculated
assuming zero potential drop at each period1 [Bern 98, Lero 98]:
−e(LbFb + LwFw) = 0,
where Lw (Lb) is the QW (barrier) thickness. Taking into account the continuity
of the perpendicular component of the electric displacement vector D at the
heterointerfaces, we obtain:
ε0εwFw + Pw = ε0εbFb + Pb,
where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εw (εb) is the relative permittivity of the
QW (barrier) material, and Pw (Pb) is the polarization in the QW (barrier). The
internal ﬁeld can be expressed as:
Fw = Pb −Pw
ε0
Lb
Lbεw + Lwεb
Fb = −Pb −Pw
ε0
Lw
Lbεw + Lwεb
.
(12.7)
These expressions show that the electric ﬁeld in the QW increases with the
polarization discontinuity and with the barrier thickness, and decreases with the
well thickness.
The solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (12.2) for an undoped nitride QW
can be expressed analytically in terms of Airy functions. A numerical solution is
required for doped heterostructures to account for the subband population.
Figure 12.1b shows the calculated dependence of the ISB transition energy on
the well thickness for an undoped GaN/AlN QW with 3-nm-thick AlN barriers.
The calculations were performed using eﬀective mass approximation assuming
a conduction-band oﬀset of 1.75 eV and a non-parabolicity in GaN given by
eq. (12.3). Two regimes can be distinguished for the ISB energy dependence as
illustrated in Figs. 12.1a and b on the example of a thin (1.3-nm) and a thick
(3-nm) GaN/AlN QW. For small well thicknesses, the e2 state is conﬁned by the
QW interfaces, which means that the transition energy is governed mostly by
the well thickness, i.e. by the quantum size eﬀect. When reducing the well thick-
ness, the calculated e12 transition energy increases, goes through a maximum for
∼0.9 nm, and then decreases. Indeed, when the QW thickness is reduced below
0.9 nm, the e2 state becomes delocalized in the triangular potential in the right
barrier, and is almost insensitive to the QW thickness, whereas the energy of the
e1 state continues to increase. Experimentally, the ISB absorption vanishes when
the well thickness is reduced because of the delocalization of the e2 state in the
1The validity of periodic conditions will be discussed in Section 12.2.5.

barrier layers and the consequent reduction of the associated oscillator strength.
For well thicknesses above 2 nm, the ground and the ﬁrst excited states are
conﬁned by the V-shaped potential in the GaN well. The transition energy is
therefore ruled by the magnitude of the internal ﬁeld.
The electric ﬁeld imposes a lowest limit on the ISB energy that can be at-
tained. Indeed, in a wide well both e1 and e2 energy levels are conﬁned by the
triangular potential, and the eﬀective QW size is reduced. The lowest ISB energy
for GaN/AlN heterostructure is estimated to be ∼0.25 eV (λ ∼5 μm). To reach
longer wavelengths, the internal electric ﬁeld should be reduced, for example, by
reducing the Al content in the barriers, as discussed in Section 12.3.4.
The external electric ﬁeld can be used to eﬃciently tune the ISB transition
energy via the Stark eﬀect. For a 2.5-nm-thick QW a variation of the ﬁeld by
∼0.5 MV/cm shifts the transition energy by more than 50 meV. This eﬀect can
be exploited to design electro-optical modulators [Holm 06].
For thick enough QWs, an ISB absorption from the ground state e1 to the
second excited state e3 can be observed [Hosh 02]. This transition is allowed
by the built-in electric ﬁeld that breaks the potential symmetry. As shown in
Fig. 12.1b, the calculated e13 transition energy is maximal for QW thickness of
∼1.5 nm.
12.2.5
Band bending
The polarization discontinuity between heterostructure layers discussed previ-
ously not only modiﬁes the ISB transition energy but also leads to strong
band-bending eﬀects, as well as the formation of a depletion layer on one side
of the active region and of an accumulation layer with a 2D electron gas on the
other side of the active region. In addition, it has major consequences on the
distribution of carriers within the active layers.
The band-bending in the active region depends on the cladding layer com-
position [Mach 09]. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 12.2, which presents the
conduction-band proﬁle and electron concentration in a ten-period GaN/AlN
QW superlattice sandwiched between either GaN or Al0.5Ga0.5N claddings. The
QW and barrier thickness is 2 nm. The QWs are n-doped at 2 × 1019 cm−3, while
the claddings are n-doped at 5 × 1018 cm−3. The calculations were performed
using a Schr¨odinger–Poisson solver (C-band) with material parameters from
[Vurg 03]. It can be seen that for GaN claddings (Fig. 12.2a) the band proﬁle is
distorted. A large depletion zone appears at the upper heterostructure/cladding
interface, and a 2D electron gas is formed at the lower cladding/heterostructure
interface. In spite of the homogeneous doping in the QWs, the electron concen-
tration is strongly inhomogeneous: only four QWs over ten are populated. This
eﬀect is of major importance for the design of ISB devices, since unpopulated
QWs do not contribute to the ISB absorption.
The band-bending can be avoided by a proper choice of the cladding layer
composition. AlGaN claddings with an Al percentage equal to the average Al

content in the active region should be used to obtain a ﬂat potential proﬁle and an
homogeneous electron concentration. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 12.2b.
In this case, the periodic conditions (12.7) can be applied for all QWs of the
superlattice. In the case of GaN claddings, the periodic conditions are valid only
for the ﬁrst four QWs.
12.2.6
Many-body eﬀects
The previously described Hartree approximation (12.4) for a doped QW predicts
a screening of the internal electric ﬁeld by free carriers. Because the screened
potential proﬁle in the well tends to ﬂatten, a reduction of the ISB transition
energy when increasing the carrier concentration is predicted by the Hartree
model. However, experimental measurements show the opposite behavior: the
ISB energy for doped samples is systematically blueshifted with respect to the
non-intentionally doped samples [Helm 03b, Kand 10]. This apparent contradic-
tion can be clariﬁed by taking into consideration the many-body interactions,
which become important at large carrier concentrations. They are, namely, the
depolarization shift, the excitonic correction, and the electron–electron exchange
interaction.
The depolarization shift α, which reﬂects the resonant screening of the ex-
ternal infrared ﬁeld by the collective oscillation of the electron plasma, results in
an increase of the transition energy. The excitonic correction β stems from the
Coulomb interaction between the excited electron and the quasi-hole formed in
the ground subband. In contrast to the previous eﬀect, it leads to a reduction

of the ISB energy. The eﬀective absorption energy of the electron gas, ecoll

where e12 is ISB transition energy for a single electron transition [Alle 76,

For the electron–electron exchange interaction, diﬀerent approaches have been
proposed. In the Hartree–Fock approximation the exchange interaction appears
as an additional term in the Schr¨odinger equation [Fock 30]. This term has a non-
local nature, which renders the exact solution very computationally intensive. To
avoid computational diﬃculties, one approach is to estimate the contribution of
the exchange interaction using perturbation theory [Band 88, Band 89], where
Hartree envelope functions are used as a basis and the ﬁrst perturbative cor-
rection of the energy is calculated. Bandara et al. showed that the exchange
interaction mainly aﬀects the fundamental subband e1 by lowering its energy,
which results in an increase of the ISB transition energy. If one neglects the
thermal excitation, the modiﬁcation of the e1 subband energy is given by

related to the surface carrier density nS by kF =

2πnS, and Ψ1 is the envelope
function for the fundamental subband calculated within Hartree approximation.
The exchange correction predicts a rapid increase of the ISB transition energy
with carrier concentration [Tche 06b, Helm 03b]. However, since the approach of
Bandara et al. is based on a perturbation theory, its predictions are valid only
for moderate carrier concentrations, for which Δeexch

Another approach to account for the exchange interaction is to follow the
local density approximation [Hedi 71] and to replace the non-local term in the
Schr¨odinger equation by a local eﬀective exchange-correlation potential Vxc(n(z))
deﬁned in (12.8). The Vxc(n(z)) is added to the Schr¨odinger equation and the

As expected, when accounting only for screening of the internal ﬁeld, the ISB
energy decreases with carrier concentration. The triangles show the solution of
Schr¨odinger and Poisson equations (12.9), where the exchange-correlation poten-
tial has been added. The exchange interaction tends to increase the ISB transition
energy compared to Hartree approximation, though this interaction alone cannot
invert the global trend. The squares represent the depolarization shift e12
√1 + α,
which translates into a rapid increase of the ISB energy with carrier density. The
diamonds show the excitonic shift e12
√1 −β, which competes with depolariz-
ation shift and reduces the ISB energy. When all many-body corrections are
included (the circles), the resultant ISB energy increases for carrier concentra-
tions above 3 · 1012 cm−2. At large carrier concentrations, the ISB transition
energy blueshift is dominated by the depolarization shift.

Optical properties of intersubband transitions
The transition rate between subbands |i> and |f> induced by a plane wave of
amplitude F and frequency ω is given by the Fermi golden rule:
| < f|W|i > |2 = 2π
ℏ
e2F 2
4m∗2ω2 | < f|ε · p|i > |2δ(Ef −Ei −ℏω),
where p is the impulse operator, ε is the polarization vector of the electromag-
netic wave, m∗is the eﬀective mass, Ef (Ei) is the energy of the ﬁnal (initial)
subband, and δ(E) is the delta function reﬂecting the energy conservation.
The matrix element < f|ε · p|i > can also be expressed in terms of the dipole
operator:
< f|ε · p|i >= im∗(Ef −Ei)
eℏ
ε · μif,
where the dipole momentum of the i–f transition is deﬁned as μif =< f|er|i >.
For a GaN/AlN QW absorbing at telecommunication wavelengths, the dipole
momentum length μif/e is about 25% of the QW thickness.
Using the expression of the wavefunction as a product of a rapidly varying
function and a slowly varying envelope function (12.1), the matrix element can
be approximated by [Bast 88]:
< f|ε · er|i > ≃< uf(r)|ε · er|ui(r) >< ψf(r)|ψi(r) >
+ < uf(r)|ui(r) >< ψf(r)|ε · er|ψi(r) > .
(12.10)
The ﬁrst term in (12.10) is non-zero only when ui(r) and uf(r) are of opposite
parity. It corresponds to the interband transitions. Since the un(r) functions are
orthogonal, the second term couples only states from the same band and gives
rise to the ISB transitions.

Taking into account the envelope function expression in a QW ψn(r) =

where εz is the z projection of the light-polarization vector.
From this expression, important properties of the ISB transitions can be
derived. Firstly, the ISB transitions are possible only between states having
the same in-plane wavevector ki
|| = kf
||. For parabolic bands this implies that
the transition energy Ei −Ef and the transition rate does not depend on k||.
Secondly, the absorption is forbidden between states having the same parity
of the envelope function. Thirdly, the ISB transitions can be induced only by
an electromagnetic wave with a non-zero component along the quantization
axis z. The ISB absorptions are therefore TM-polarized, and they can be easily
distinguished from any other absorption in the material. Finally, the transition
rate depends only on the envelope functions and can be tailored by the QW
design.
The ISB absorption coeﬃcient is deﬁned as the energy loss by unit volume
by unit time, divided by the intensity of incident light:

Near-infrared intersubband absorption in polar GaN/AlN quantum wells
Interest in ISB transitions in nitride heterostructures arose in the late 1990s after
theoretical work by Suzuki et al., showing that ISB transitions in GaN/Al(Ga)N
can cover the telecommunication domain [Suzu 97]. First experimental studies
carried out on MOCVD grown GaN/Al0.65Ga0.35N QWs have demonstrated ISB
absorptions at 3–4 μm [Suzu 99]. At the beginning 2000, shorter wavelengths
(1.41–4.15 μm) were achieved in MBE-grown GaN/AlxGa1−xN QWs with
x = 0.65–0.85 [Gmac 00, Gmac 01a, Hebe 02, Zhou 03]. MBE-grown GaN QWs
with pure AlN barriers were studied for the ﬁrst time by Iizuka et al. [Iizu 02],
showing ISB absorption at 1.3–2.2 μm. The shortest ISB wavelength of
λ = 1.08 μm was reported by Kishino et al. [Kish 02b] for a three-monolayer
(ML) (∼0.8 nm) thick GaN/AlN QW. Helman et al. [Helm 03b] studied the de-
pendence of the ISB energy in GaN/AlN QWs on the doping, and showed that the
ISB wavelength experiences a blueshift when increasing the carrier concentration.
Figure 12.4a shows a typical example of transmission spectra of MBE-grown
GaN/AlN QWs measured at room temperature in a multi-pass waveguide con-
ﬁguration [Tche 06b]. The samples contain 20 periods of GaN QWs with 3 nm
thick AlN barriers. The QWs are n-doped with Si at 5 × 1019 cm−3. The ISB
absorption is observed only for TM-polarized light, in agreement with polariza-
tion selection rules. The absorption shifts towards lower energies, with increasing
QW width from 4 MLs (1 nm) to 7 MLs (1.8 nm).

from top to bottom is equal to 1, 1.3, and 1.8 nm. b) Calculated energy for e12
and e13 ISB transitions in a GaN/AlN QW with 3-nm barriers. Circles show
the experimental data, and solid (dashed) curves correspond to calculations
in the hypothesis of a structure strained on GaN (AlN). (After [Kand 08].)
Comparison of the measured and calculated ISB transition energy is repor-
ted in Fig. 12.4b. Calculations were performed using the Nextnano3 8-band k·p
Schr¨odinger–Poisson solver for a GaN/AlN superlattice within two diﬀerent hy-
potheses of a heterostructure fully strained on GaN and on AlN [Kand 08]. For a
GaN well thickness of between 4 and 6 ML (1–1.5 nm), the e12 transition energy
covers the spectral range used for ﬁber-optic telecommunication. For thick QWs
the ISB transition energy is sensitive to the strain state, which has an impact
on the piezoelectric component of the internal electric ﬁeld. The internal ﬁeld is
enhanced for a tensile-strained structure (strained on GaN), which results in an
increase of the ISB transition energy compared to the case of a compressively
strained structure (strained on AlN).
The typical full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ISB absorption in
GaN/AlN QWs is between 60 and 120 meV. A record low broadening of 40 meV
at λ = 1.43 μm (ΔE/E ∼4.6%) has been reported by Nevou et al. [Nevo 06b] in
non-intentionally doped GaN/AlN QWs studied by a photoinduced absorption
technique. The absorbance resonance either exhibits a Lorentzian lineshape or is
structured with two or three well-deﬁned peaks, each of them having a Lorentzian
shape. The structuring of ISB absorption of GaN/AlN QWs is interpreted as
originating from absorbance in well regions with diﬀerent thicknesses equal to
an integer number of monolayers [Tche 06b]. Indeed, thickness ﬂuctuations of

428
Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
±1 ML (±0.26 nm), which occur during the growth, create potential minima
deep enough to localize carriers even at room temperature. For 4–6-ML-thick
GaN QWs, a 1-ML increase of the thickness translates into a strong ISB energy
shift of about 60 meV. This value is comparable to the broadening factor, and
therefore results in structuring of the absorbance spectrum instead of inhomo-
geneous broadening. For comparison, in material systems such as GaAs/AlGaAs
or InGaAs/InAlAs, the minimal thickness necessary to have two bound levels
in the well is much larger than in the GaN/AlN system, of the order of sev-
eral nanometers. For such large thicknesses a ﬂuctuation of 1 ML results only
in a small shift of the ISB absorption energy contributing to the broadening
[Helm 99].
The MOCVD technique, because of its large growth rate, is less suited for
the fabrication of QWs absorbing at telecommunication wavelengths with thick-
ness control down to 1 ML. An additional diﬃculty is related to the Ga/Al
interdiﬀusion favored by the high growth temperature. However, ISB absorption
wavelength close to telecommunication range (λ ∼1.6 μm) has been reported
in MOCVD grown GaN/AlN QWs [Nico 06, Nico 07]. It has been shown that
the interdiﬀusion depends on the strain state in the heterostructure, and can be
strongly reduced in heterostructures under compressive strain grown on AlN on
sapphire templates [Nico 07].
12.3.2
Intersubband transitions in In-containing heterostructures
In order to reduce the strain accumulation and the defect formation in super-
lattices, In-containing alloys have been proposed as a solution. The substitution
of AlGaN in the barriers by Al1−xInxN allows the reduction of the lattice mis-
match (the exact lattice matching to GaN is achieved for x = 0.18) [Butt 07].
It was shown that thick AlInN layers can be grown on GaN templates without
crack formation to form low-loss waveguides at 1.55 μm [Lupu 08]. Nicolay et al.
have reported the observation of ISB absorption at λ ∼3 μm in MOCVD-grown
lattice-matched GaN/Al0.82In0.18N QWs [Nico 05]. ISB absorption between 2.3
and 2.9 μm has been also observed in MBE-grown GaN/AlInN QWs [Mali 09].
It should be noted that the conduction-band oﬀset is reduced by adding In
in the barriers. Therefore, the near-infrared spectral range cannot be attained
for lattice-matched AlInN/GaN structures. This material combination remains
well-suited for ISB devices operating at λ > 2.5 μm.
An alternative strategy for strain management consists in designing strain-
compensated heterostructures. This can be achieved using GaInN/AlInN su-
perlattice on GaN substrates. The advantage of this solution with respect to
GaN/AlInN heterostructures is that it preserves a high conduction-band oﬀ-
set compatible with ISB transitions in the near-infrared range. ISB absorptions
at λ ∼1.5 μm have been demonstrated in MBE-grown strain-compensated
GaInN/AlInN QWs [Cywi 06, Skie 06, Moty 06, Kudr 08, Cywi 08].

12.3.3
Coupled GaN/AlN quantum wells
To design the active region of many ISB devices, coupled QWs are required.
Because of the high conduction-band oﬀset between GaN and AlN, the design of
coupled QWs can be based either on an ultra-thin AlN barrier or on a ternary
alloy in the barrier to achieve eﬃcient coupling.
Coupling between GaN QWs was ﬁrst investigated by C. Gmachl et al.
[Gmac 01b, Hebe 02]. The spectroscopic studies of GaN/Al0.65Ga0.35N-coupled
QWs with the coupling barrier thickness varied from 0.7 nm to 6 nm have re-
vealed broad ISB absorptions (FWHM ∼300 meV) presenting multiple peaks in
λ = 1.35−2.9 μm spectral range. The QWs were highly doped (1020 cm−3) in
order to populate the ground state and to establish a common reference energy
at the Fermi level. The structuring of the ISB absorptions in symmetric double
QWs was attributed to transitions towards excited states exhibiting anticrossing.
Quantum conﬁnement in coupled GaN/AlN QWs has been modeled by Suzuki
et al. [Suzu 03] in order to design structures absorbing at 1.3–1.55 μm for ultra-
fast switching applications. These calculations, performed within the envelope
function formalism, proposed the use of ultra-thin (0.25
nm) AlN layers to
achieve coupling. The ISB absorption with e12 and e13 ISB absorption at telecom-
munication wavelengths in double GaN/AlGaN QWs was also modeled by Lei
et al. [Lei 08b, Lei 08a] and by Cen et al. [Cen 09b] showing strong dependence
of the transition energy on the internal ﬁeld.
Coupled GaN/AlN QWs with an ultra-thin coupling barrier have been studied
experimentally by Tchernycheva et al. [Tche 06a]. Figure 12.5 (middle) shows a
TEM image of coupled QWs with a 0.5-nm-thick AlN barrier grown by plasma-
assisted MBE. Excellent control of the coupling-barrier thickness from period to
period was achieved. The absorbance spectra of two coupled QW samples with
diﬀerent QW thickness (Fig. 12.5, left) exhibit a pronounced ISB absorption
revealing two peaks. These peaks are attributed to the e12 transition between
the ground states of both QWs and the e13 transition between the ground state
of the second QW in growth order, and the excited state delocalized in both
QWs. Comparison of spectroscopic results with simulations showed that the
description of the ultra-thin barrier using an abrupt potential proﬁle and the
internal ﬁeld calculated following the same formula as for thick layers [Suzu 03]
produce wrong predictions of the transition energies. Agreement with experiment
is achieved when the ultra-thin AlN barrier is approximated by a triangular
potential introduced in a thick GaN QW, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (right). This can
be understood by taking into account the theoretical prediction by Bernardini
et al. [Bern 98] that the potential drop at the GaN/AlN heterointerfaces is not
abrupt. Based on ab initio calculations, it has been shown that the potential at
the GaN/AlN interface varies almost linearly over 1 ML between the GaN and
the AlN values. This eﬀect can be disregarded when dealing with heterostructures
with layer thicknesses larger than 1 nm. However, when the layer thickness is
as small as 1–2 ML, the oﬀset spreading should be taken into account to obtain
reliable predictions of ISB transition energies.

An alternative approach for coupled QWs using a ternary alloy coupling bar-
rier has been studied by Driscoll et al. [Dris 07]. The authors fabricated double
QWs with an AlGaN coupling barrier with 39–53% Al content, whereas the sep-
arating barrier was composed of pure AlN. With this strategy, strong interwell
coupling was observed for a coupling barrier thickness of 1.3 nm. These structures
have been further used by the authors for development of all optical switches,
where an optical control pulse produces a large Stark shift of the ISB absorp-
tion via a redistribution of electrons in coupled QWs [Li 06b], as discussed in
Section 12.4.1.
12.3.4
Mid-infrared intersubband absorption in AlGaN/GaN quantum wells
Until recently, most research on GaN-based ISB transitions has been focused on
near-infrared applications, with a challenge to reach the 1.3–1.55 μm spectral
range. However, nitrides can also produce interesting applications in the mid-
and far-infrared domain. Due to the extended material transparency, nitride ISB
devices can cover the entire range of 1.3 μm to 13 μm and 19 μm to THz. The
energy of the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon is much higher than in other
III–V materials (92 meV for GaN to be compared with 36 meV for GaAs), so
that nitride ISB devices can access the spectral range forbiden to other III–V
materials because of their Reststrahlen absorption.

Intersubband spectroscopy of nitride quantum wells

To push the ISB transitions in nitride nanostructures to mid-infrared
wavelengths, the internal ﬁeld must be reduced. This can be achieved by changing
the growth plane to non-polar, such as m-plane {1-100} or a-plane {11-20}, or
semipolar, such as {11-22} [Laho 08a]. Alternatively, cubic GaN can also be used
[DeCu 07, Mach 11]. However, the growth in non-polar and semipolar directions
and the growth of cubic nitrides is much less mature than the polar growth.
For [0001]-oriented GaN/AlGaN heterostructures, polarization eﬀects can be
attenuated by lowering the Al content in the barriers and increasing the QW
width. Figure 12.6(left) shows the calculated ISB energy as a function of the
QW width for diﬀerent compositions of 2-nm-thick AlGaN barriers. This calcu-
lation performed for a nominally undoped QW shows that in order to tune the
transition to 8–12 μm wavelength range, the Al content in the barriers should be
chosen close to 10–20% and the well width should be 4–7 nm. The calculation
also predicts an ISB absorption below the Reststrahlen band of GaN for 10% Al
composition and a QW width above 9 nm.
ISB absorption in GaN/AlGaN QWs up to ∼4 μm has been reported in
early works [Suzu 99, Ng 02] and later extended to 5.3 μm by P´er´e-Laperne
et al. [Pere 09]. Kandaswamy et al. have further shown in a systematic invest-
igation that the absorption in GaN/AlGaN QWs can be shifted almost to the
Reststrahlen band of GaN [Kand 09]. Figure 12.6(right) displays the ISB ab-
sorption spectra of Si-doped GaN/AlGaN superlattices grown by plasma-assisted
MBE on sapphire and on semi-insulating GaN-on-Si(111) templates. The ISB ab-
sorption peak is tuned in a large spectral range and attains 9 μm for 7-nm-thick
GaN/Al0.1Ga0.9N QWs.
In practice, the ISB absorption energy of AlGaN/GaN QWs is larger than
that predicted by the theoretical calculations of Fig. 12.6(left). This is due to
the modiﬁcation of the ISB transition energy by the QW doping. A systematic

investigation [Kand 10] of the inﬂuence of the surfacic electron concentration on
the ISB absorption of GaN/AlGaN QWs has shown that increasing the carrier
concentration results in a strong blueshift of the ISB absorption, which is ac-
companied by a large enhancement of the broadening. This eﬀect is illustrated
in Fig. 12.7, showing the transmission spectra for 7-nm-thick GaN/Al0.1Ga0.9N
QWs doped with Si at a nominal concentration ranging from n = 1 × 1019 cm−3
to 2 × 1020 cm−3 (equivalent surfacic concentration nS = 7 × 1012 cm−2 to
1.4 × 1014 cm−2). The ISB absorption is progressively blueshifted, and the shift
attains 50% of the e12 transition energy for the maximal doping. The blueshift
is attributed to many-body eﬀects dominated by the depolarization shift, as
discussed in Section 12.2.6.
12.3.5
Tuning ISB transitions to the terahertz frequency domain in polar
GaN/AlGaN quantum wells
The terahertz (THz) spectral region is of particular importance for applications
such as medical diagnostics, security screening, trace molecule sensing, astronom-
ical detection, or non-invasive quality control. In terms of sources, this region is
covered with arsenide-based quantum cascade lasers. However, the main limita-
tion for these devices is their cryogenic operating temperature. Nitride materials
are predicted to provide a solution for THz lasers operating at temperatures
extending beyond 300 K [Bell 09].

Intersubband spectroscopy of nitride quantum wells
433
The ﬁrst step in view of the development of GaN THz QCLs is the tuning
of the ISB transition to the far-infrared domain. As presented in Section 12.3.7,
ISB absorption at THz frequencies has been observed in cubic GaN/AlGaN QWs
[Mach 11], but this is very challenging in the case of polar wurtzite nitrides
because of the internal electric ﬁeld. The strategy followed for tuning the ISB
absorption to the mid-infrared region may potentially provide a solution, though
it requires a very low Al content in the barriers as well as a thick QW. In this
case the transition energy is diﬃcult to control, since it is extremely sensitive
to the carrier concentration via screening of the internal ﬁeld and many-body
eﬀects.
A more robust design for achieving ISB absorption in the THz has been
proposed by Machhadani et al. [Mach 10]. The main idea is to use a step QW
to approach a ﬂat potential proﬁle. The design is illustrated in Fig. 12.8(left),
showing the conduction-band proﬁle and the square of the envelope functions
for a structure consisting of an Si-doped 3-nm-thick GaN QW, 15-nm-thick
Al0.05Ga0.95N step barrier, and a 3-nm-thick Al0.1Ga0.9N spacer barrier. The
composition in the step AlGaN barrier is chosen equal to the average Al content
in the structure, therefore the potential in the step barrier is almost ﬂat ex-
cept for a slight band-bending due to the Coulomb interaction between electrons
and ionized donors. The ground and excited electronic states are conﬁned in the
GaN well and Al0.05Ga0.95N step barrier. The predicted e12 energy is 10 meV
(2.4 THz).

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
A sample consisting of forty periods of step QWs was grown by plasma-
assisted MBE on GaN-on-Si template. The transmission measurement shown
in Fig. 12.8(right) reveals an ISB absorption peaked at 2.1 THz (8.7 meV),
in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The rather large FWHM of the
absorption equal to 0.72 THz (that is, Δλ/λ = 34%) is attributed to the electron
impurity and electron–electron scattering. By reducing the step barrier thickness
to 10 nm, the ISB absorption was shifted to 4.2 THz [Mach 10].
12.3.6
Intersubband transitions in semipolar GaN/AlN
quantum wells
As mentioned in Sections 12.3.4 and 12.3.5, minimizing the internal electric ﬁeld
constitutes a major challenge for tuning the ISB absorption to the mid- and
far-infrared spectral range. For near-infrared applications, the device design in
some particular cases may take advantage of the internal ﬁeld (as, for example,
in quantum cascade detectors described in Section 12.5.3). However, for most
applications in the near-infrared the internal ﬁeld presents a number of draw-
backs. First, it reduces the oscillator strength of the ISB transition with respect
to a square QW of the same thickness, leading to a lower ISB absorption or
emission eﬃciency. In addition, it induces a band-bending, creates depleted re-
gions in heterostructures, and modiﬁes the alignment of coupled QWs. This in
general complicates the design of ISB devices, in which a high degree of con-
trol over the QW population and over the energy-level alignment is required. It
is therefore desirable to reduce the internal electric ﬁeld while keeping a high
conduction-band oﬀset.
This can be achieved by changing the growth direction in order to bring
the electrical polarization vector in the layer plane. One possibility is to use a
non-polar growth plane, such as m-plane {1-100} or a-plane {11-20}. However,
growth of non-polar III-nitrides is challenging due to the strong anisotropy of the
surface properties, resulting in layers with a high density of crystalline defects.
An alternative approach is the growth on semipolar planes, such as {11-22}. The
advantage of the semipolar orientation is that it allows to considerably reduce
the internal electric ﬁeld [Chak 05, Roma 06] while presenting a lower in-plane
anisotropy than non-polar surfaces [Laho 07, Laho 08b].
The observation of ISB absorptions in GaN/AlN semipolar QWs has been
reported by L. Lahourcade et al. [Laho 08a]. The non-intentionally doped
GaN/AlN multiple QWs were studied by photoinduced absorption infrared spec-
troscopy, which revealed ISB resonances in the 2.4–3.8 μm range. The measured
ISB energies together with the results of interband photoluminescence spectro-
scopy conﬁrmed the strong reduction of the internal electric ﬁeld in the QWs to
∼0.6 MV/cm [Laho 08a].
Figure 12.9 shows the comparison of the ISB absorption in polar and
semipolar QWs. Semipolar and polar Si-doped GaN/AlN superlattices with a
QW width from 1.2 to 3 nm and AlN thickness of 3 nm were simultaneously

grown on m-plane and c-plane sapphire substrates. As seen, the ISB absorption
in semipolar QWs is redshifted. It covers the 1.5–3.3 μm range for semipolar
structures compared to 1.45–2 μm in polar structures. This red shift of the trans-
ition energy in large semipolar QWs with respect to the polar case conﬁrms the
electric ﬁeld reduction. We also note that the ISB absorption has a diﬀerent spec-
tral shape: for polar QWs the ISB spectrum is the sum of Lorentzian resonances,
whereas a Gaussian shape is observed in the semipolar case. This dissimilarity
can be ascribed to a diﬀerent carrier localization in these two cases.

Intersubband transitions in cubic GaN/Al(Ga)N quantum wells
The issue of the internal electric ﬁeld inherent to the polar nature of wurtzite
crystals is removed in zincblende nitride materials. Although the stable phase
for nitride crystals is the hexagonal phase, cubic material can be synthesized
under speciﬁc growth conditions using substrates of cubic symmetry [As 09].
Cubic GaN exhibits a slightly smaller direct band-gap (3.299 eV [Vurg 03]) than
its hexagonal counterpart. Cubic AlN has an indirect band-gap, which value is
still not well known (Vurgaftman et al. [Vurg 03] recommend a value of 4.9 eV
for the X-valley gap). Despite this uncertainty, a high conduction-band oﬀset of
1.4 ± 0.1 eV at Γ point has been reported for cubic GaN/AlN heterostructures
[Mach 11, Miet 11]. The electron eﬀective mass in cubic GaN is in the range
0.11m0 [Pugh 99]–0.17m0 [Suzu 96] (to be compared to 0.2m0 in wurtzite GaN
[Vurg 03]). These material parameters allow tuning of the ISB transition energy
in cubic GaN/AlN QWs to the near-infrared domain.
The near-infrared ISB absorptions in cubic GaN/AlN QWs have been ob-
served initially by DeCuir et al. [DeCu 07]. Infrared quantum-well photodetector

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
(QWIP) using cubic material has been demonstrated [DeCu 08]. Resonant tun-
neling in cubic GaN/AlGaN double-barrier structures has also been reported
[Zain 10].
Machhadani et al. [Mach 11] have shown further that by changing the QW
thickness and Al content in GaN/AlGaN QWs it is possible to tune the ISB
absorption wavelength over a huge spectral interval from 1.4 μm (214 THz) to
63 μm (4.76 THz). Figure 12.10 shows the low-temperature far-infrared trans-
mission spectrum of a stack of 12-nm-thick GaN/Al0.05Ga0.95N QWs. The ISB
absorption is observed at 19.7 meV (4.76 THz). This result demonstrates the
interest in cubic nitrides for applications in the THz spectral region. It should
be noted that the LO-phonon energy in cubic GaN is almost the same as in
wurtzite GaN (92.7 meV [Braz 06]), whereas the eﬀective mass is much smaller.
A lower eﬀective mass would result in a higher gain and lower threshold current
density in QCLs based on this material system.

Intersublevel absorption in GaN/AlN quantum dots
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanostructures presenting quantum conﬁne-
ment in three spatial directions. Contrary to QWs, QDs can exhibit TE-polarized
absorption for intersublevel (or intraband) transitions between states conﬁned in
Fig. 12.10. Far-infrared transmission spectra of cubic GaN/Al0.05Ga0.95N QWs

the layer plane. The three-dimensional conﬁnement also modiﬁes the electron–
phonon interaction in this system, resulting in a longer dephasing time than in
the QW case [Nevo 08].
GaN/AlN QDs can be formed by MBE using the so-called Stranski–Krastanov
mode, in which the strain relaxation during the growth leads to island formation
[Daud 97]. The QDs have the shape of a truncated hexagonal pyramid with {10-
13} facets standing on 2-ML-thick wetting layer [Cham 04]. The resultant dot
surfacic density is large (1011−1012 cm−2), which is a key point for obtaining
eﬃcient intraband absorption.
The energy states of GaN/AlN QDs were calculated using an 8-band k·p
model [Andr 00, Andr 01, Vard 09] and using a tight-binding method account-
ing for the electric-ﬁeld screening by carriers [Ranj 03]. The calculations show
that the electrons are localized at the pyramid apex due to the internal elec-
tric ﬁeld. It was also demonstrated that the built-in ﬁeld in GaN/AlN dots can
provide a strong additional lateral conﬁnement for carriers localized in the dot
[Will 05].
The observation of intraband absorption was ﬁrst reported for large GaN/AlN
QDs grown on Si (111) and sapphire substrates [Moum 03]. The intraband ab-
sorption of nominally undoped QDs with a height of 4–4.5 nm and a diameter of
∼20 nm grown by ammonia MBE was probed by photoinduced absorption spec-
troscopy. The QDs exhibit a TM-polarized intraband absorption at 0.5–0.6 eV
attributed to the transition between the ground state s and the ﬁrst excited
stated, with one node of the envelope function along the growth axis (denoted
as pz state) [Moum 03]. The intraband absorption for TE light polarization in
these QDs was observed at 0.15 eV attributed to the s-px transition, where px
is the excited state in the layer plane [Helm 03a].
GaN/AlN QDs of a smaller height (1–1.5 nm) were shown to present intra-
band absorption at telecommunication wavelength [Tche 05, Guil 06]. Si-doped
GaN/AlN QDs were grown by plasma-assisted MBE on AlN-on-sapphire tem-
plates. The structure consists of twenty periods of QDs with 3-nm-thick AlN
barriers and one additional uncapped QD layer on the surface to assess the dot
morphology by AFM (Fig. 12.11, left). Strong TM-polarized intraband absorp-
tions peaking at wavelengths ranging from 1.38 to 1.67 μm were observed at
room temperature. The transition energy is governed by the QD height and is
almost diameter-independent. The eﬀect of various parameters (the amount of
GaN deposited, the substrate temperature, and the growth interruption time
after each GaN layer) was analyzed. In particular, the increase of either the
substrate temperature or the growth interruption time leads to the formation of
bigger QDs and shifts the intraband transition to lower energy. This is illustrated
in Fig. 12.11(right), showing the intraband absorption spectra of QDs grown at
diﬀerent substrate temperatures. The s-px TE-polarized absorption in similar
samples was evidenced by photocurrent spectroscopy. The transition energy was
found to be equal to 0.15 eV (0.23 eV) for a QD diameter of 16 nm (11 nm)
respectively [Vard 09].

In the following sections we review recent progress in the ﬁeld of ISB devices
based on nitride QWs and QDs.

GaN-based intersubband light modulators
12.4.1
All-optical switches
One remarkable feature of nitride-based materials is the extremely short recovery
time of the ISB absorption. As pointed out by Suzuki and Iizuka [Suzu 98], this
is a consequence of very eﬃcient scattering processes via electron–LO-phonon
interaction in these highly polar materials. The ISB absorption recovery time has
been measured using time-resolved pump-probe techniques to be in the range
of 140–400 fs in GaN/AlGaN single and coupled QWs at room temperature
[Iizu 00, Gmac 01a, Hebe 02, Rapa 03, Hama 04, Iizu 05]. This oﬀers prospects
for ultrafast ISB devices operating at multi-Tbit/s data-rates.
One ISB device exploiting the ultrafast absorption recovery time is the all-
optical switch, which was originally demonstrated at long infrared wavelengths
using the GaAs/AlGaAs material system [Noda 93]. Suzuki et al. proposed
making use of GaN/ AlGaN QWs for achieving all-optical switching at telecom-
munication wavelengths [Suzu 97, Suzu 00]. The principle of operation illustrated
in Fig. 12.12 is based on the saturation of the ISB absorption by an intense con-
trol pulse. In the absence of the control pulse, the signal at the wavelength
of the ISB transition is completely absorbed. In the presence of the control
pulse, the signal experiences no attenuation because the ISB absorption is satur-
ated. These ultrafast all-optical devices may become building blocks for future
ultra-broadband all-optical networks with enhanced capacity and functionality,

in which the information is transmitted and processed in the optical domain
[Wada 00].
Optical modulation due to the ISB absorption saturation in GaN/AlN mul-
tiple QWs embedded in a ridge waveguide structure grown by MBE was ﬁrst
demonstrated in 2004 by Iizuka et al. [Iizu 04]. Using a 120-pJ control pulse at
1.7 μm wavelength, the extinction ratio for the 1.55-μm signal pulse was meas-
ured to be 2.4 dB, and the device exhibited a response time of 0.36 ps. It was
found that the extinction ratio could be further enhanced by improving the crys-
talline quality of the material in order to minimize the polarization-dependent
losses (PDL) induced by the edge dislocations, which lead to attenuation of the
control pulse propagating in the waveguide [Iizu 06b]. By combining MOCVD
growth of the GaN lower cladding layer and MBE growth of the GaN/AlN
QWs and upper cladding layer, a signiﬁcant reduction of the PDL was observed.
Under 150 (25) pJ control pulses, an extinction ratio of 11.5 (3) dB and a re-
sponse time of 110 fs were demonstrated for 400-μm-long tapered waveguides
[Iizu 05, Iizu 06a]. All-optical switching at a wavelength as short as 1.43 μm was
reported for a waveguide with AlN cladding layers [Kumt 07, Shim 07].
In order to reduce the control pulse energy for switching, Iizuka et al. pro-
posed to decrease the cross-section of the waveguide and to make use of spot-size
conversion using tapered waveguides [Iizu 09]. An extinction ratio of 5 dB was
demonstrated with only 25 pJ control pulse energy. Another strategy for redu-
cing the control pulse energy was investigated by Li et al. [Li 07a], aimed at
minimizing the optical losses induced by the high density of defects at the in-
terface between the nitride buﬀer and sapphire substrate, as well as increasing
the optical mode overlap within the active region. By using a waveguide with an
AlN lower cladding, thirty periods of GaN/AlN QWs, and a GaN upper clad-
ding, a 10-dB modulation depth at 1.55 μm wavelength could be achieved with
only thirty-eight pJ control pulses [Li 07b]. Theoretical predictions show that
the control pulse energy for switching could be further reduced by a factor over
30 using properly designed AlN/GaN/AlGaN coupled QWs [Li 06b].
Another approach for reducing the switching energy is to make use of GaN/
AlN QDs. Indeed, it was pointed out that the electron dephasing time is

440
Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
signiﬁcantly longer in GaN-based QDs than in QWs [Nevo 08], which should
translate into a smaller saturation intensity. In addition, the large density of
GaN/AlN QDs, which is typically achieved through MBE growth, ensures eﬃ-
cient intraband absorption. The ultrafast relaxation and absorption saturation
has been investigated by Nevou et al. in a 200-period GaN/AlN QD superlattice
[Nevo 09]. The recovery time of the s-pz intraband absorption at λ = 1.55 μm
was assessed using degenerate pump-probe experiments at room temperature.
As shown in Fig. 12.13a, the measurements reveal a multi-exponential decay of
the diﬀerential transmission with an ultrafast (∼160 fs) and a slower (∼1.5 ps)
time constant attributed respectively to the excited state lifetime and to the
thermalization time in the ground state.
Figure 12.13b shows the normalized transmittance through the QD sample as
a function of the incident power density and intensity. The saturation intensity is
estimated to be in the range 0.15–1.4 W/μm2, which is signiﬁcantly smaller than
the value of 9.46 W/μm2 reported for GaN/AlN QWs [Li 07b]. A detailed com-
parison of third-order non-linearities leading to absorption saturation between
GaN/AlN QWs and QDs has been investigated in [Vald 08].
12.4.2
Electro-optical modulators
Electro-optical modulators are key components for the ﬁber-optics telecom-
munication systems at λ = 1.55 μm. The present driving technology relies on
the quantum-conﬁned Stark eﬀect of interband absorption in InGaAsP-based
QWs. These interband modulators allow high modulation bandwidths in excess
of 100 GHz. It was predicted that ISB modulators would provide new tech-
nological solutions for even higher-bandwidth and low-driving-voltage devices

almost insensitive to the input power and temperature [Holm 07]. In addition,
they would provide better handling of chirp issues during the commutation pro-
cess with respect to current technologies based on interband electro-absorption
[Holm 06]. Frequency chirp broadens the spectral bandwidth of the modulated
optical signal and introduces additional performance degradation when the signal
propagates [Hui 09].
Electro-absorption ISB modulators have been investigated at long infrared
wavelengths in the GaAs/AlGaAs material system based either on Stark shifting
of ISB absorption [Harw 87], photoinduced ISB absorption [Juli 91], or charge-
transfer between coupled QWs [Vodj 91]. In view of an electro-optical modulator
at telecommunication wavelengths, Holmstr¨om proposed the use of the Stark
shift of ISB absorption of GaN/AlGaN/AlN step QWs under an applied bias
[Holm 06]. He predicted, for a 13-μm-long ridge-waveguide device containing
four-step QWs, an RC-limited speed of f-3dB=100 GHz with a 50 Ω shunt
resistance, and a DC peak-to-peak voltage of 2.8 V for a 10-dB extinction ratio.
Nevou et al. reported on an ISB electro-absorption modulation device operat-
ing at room temperature, which relies on electron tunneling in GaN/AlN-coupled
quantum wells (CQW) [Nevo 07a]. The active structure grown by RF plasma as-
sisted MBE consists of a 3-nm-thick well, which acts as an electron reservoir, of a
1-nm-thick AlN coupling barrier, and of a narrow 1-nm-thick well designed to ex-
hibit ISB absorption at 1.3 μm. The TEM image of three periods of the CQWs is
displayed in Fig. 12.14b, showing the good reproducibility of the layer thickness.
Similar structure has also been reproduced by using ammonia-MBE [Duss 10].
As illustrated in Fig. 12.14a, by applying a positive bias on the CQW structure,
electrons are transferred from the reservoir well to the active well, which gives
rise to electro-absorption modulation at λ = 1.3–1.6 μm. Under reverse bias, elec-
trons tunnel back to the reservoir well, and the device becomes transparent at
telecommunication wavelengths. Figure 12.15a shows room-temperature diﬀer-
ential transmission spectra for positive and negative applied biases. For positive

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
applied biases, the ISB absorption at λ = 2.3 μm corresponding to the reservoir
well decreases, while the absorption at λ = 1.2–1.67 μm, corresponding to the
active-well increases. This reﬂects the charge transfer from the reservoir to the
active QW. An opposite behavior is observed for the negative applied bias. Both
modulation peaks at λ = 2.3 μm and λ = 1.4 μm exhibit a blueshift of ∼30 meV
when the bias is increased from −30 V to +30 V. This blueshift is a consequence
of the Stark shift of the ISB transition in the reservoir and active wells.
The response time of the CQW modulator was investigated by processing
mesa devices with mesa sizes down to 15 × 15 μm2 [Khei 08]. As shown in
Fig. 12.15b, the optical modulation bandwidth at 1.3 μm wavelength increases
when the mesa size is reduced, and is RC-limited at 3 GHz for the smaller me-
sas. The intrinsic speed of the CQW modulator is expected to be much faster,
since the limiting mechanism is the electron tunneling time through the thin AlN
coupling barrier, which is of the order of a few ps.
Another interesting approach for ISB light modulation was investigated by
Baumann et al. [Baum 06b]. The structure resembles that of a high-electron-
mobility transistor. A GaN/AlN superlattice with 1.5-nm-thick well and barrier
layers was grown on top of a GaN buﬀer layer. A metallic gate contact was fabric-
ated on top of a 100-nm-thick SiN dielectric layer deposited on the surface. Under
negative applied bias, the superlattice is depleted and therefore transparent at

1.5 μm. Only an ISB absorption at 2.2 μm was observed arising from the two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at the interface between the GaN buﬀer
layer and the superlattice. By applying a positive gate bias, electrons are trans-
ferred from the 2DEG to the GaN/AlN QWs, giving rise to an additional ISB
absorption at 1.5 μm.
For compatibility with ﬁber-optics technology it is desirable to integrate
the electro-absorption modulator into an optical waveguide with a strong op-
tical mode overlap within the active region to enhance the modulation depth.
Figure 12.16 shows a sketch of a GaN-based ridge-waveguide ISB modulator re-
lying on an electron population/depletion scheme [Mach 09]. The active region
consists of only three periods of 1.3-nm-thick GaN wells with 3-nm-thick AlN
barriers, and is inserted in the core of a 1-μm-thick Al0.5Ga0.5N waveguiding
layer. The operation of the device is illustrated in Fig. 12.16a. Under negat-
ive applied bias, the 3 QWs are depleted and the modulator is transparent. In
turn, under positive applied bias, the ground state of each well is below the
Fermi level, and the electron population of the wells gives rise to ISB absorp-
tion at 1.5 μm wavelength. The device was grown by RF plasma MBE on an
AlN on c-sapphire template and processed into 2.6-mm-long and 50-μm-wide
ridge waveguides with top and bottom metallic contacts. Figure 12.17a shows
the waveguide transmission at room temperature under various applied biases
measured with an injection-lensed ﬁber and a tunable semiconductor laser diode.
For TE-polarized light, the transmission is practically ﬂat and does not depend
on applied bias. In contrast, for TM-polarized light the spectra reveal an ISB ab-
sorption increasing with applied bias as a result of the population of the ground
state of the QWs. One can also notice a 32-meV blueshift of the absorption

Figure 12.17b shows the TM-polarized transmission of the modulator versus ap-
plied bias for diﬀerent wavelengths. The modulation depth is of the order of 13.5
dB for −9V/+7V applied bias and 10 dB for 5 V voltage swing. Note that a
value of 12 dB is required for optical modulators in order to achieve 10−12 bit
error rates in current-technology ﬁber-optics data-transmission systems.
All modulation devices described so far rely on amplitude modulation of
the ISB absorption. Based on Kramers–Kronig relations, the ISB absorption
should also translate into a variation of the refractive index at wavelengths
in the vicinity of the ISB resonance. Such an eﬀect opens prospects for the
realization of ISB phase modulators. Refractive index modulation by ISB trans-
itions has been studied at long infrared wavelengths in GaAs/AlGaAs step QWs
[Dupo 93]. Fast electrical control of ISB phase modulation would be desirable
at 1.3–1.55 μm wavelengths in view of optical networks, switching, and rout-
ing devices. A few theoretical works have addressed the potential of GaN-based
QWs for ISB refractive index modulation [Cen 09a]. The refractive index non-
linearities in GaN/AlN waveguides have been observed by Li et al., presenting
prospects for all-optical cross-phase modulators [Li 08].
ISB phase modulation at telecommunication wavelengths has been investig-
ated using the same structure as the GaN-based waveguide depletion modulator
shown in Fig. 12.16 [Lupu 12]. By analyzing the oscillations of the waveguide
transmission spectrum due to the beating interference between the fundamental
and higher-order modes, the refractive index variation associated with the ISB
absorption of the 3 GaN/AlN QWs could be determined. Figure 12.18 shows

the refractive index shift versus bias at room temperature for wavelengths in the
1.462–1.503 μm range. The index variation with bias from complete depletion
to full population of the QWs is around 5 × 10−3. This value is similar to the
typical index variation achieved in InP, and is an order of magnitude higher than
the index variation obtained in silicon. It can be enhanced further by increasing
the electron concentration in the GaN/AlN QWs or the number of QWs.

GaN-based intersubband photodetectors
12.5.1
Quantum well infrared photodetectors
Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIP) rely on ISB absorption and
photocurrent generation from the transfer of electrons photoexcited from the
fundamental state of the QWs into the continuum under an applied bias
[Levi 87, Levi 93]. QWIPs have been studied thoroughly in standard III–V semi-
conductors for long-infrared-wavelength focal-plane arrays and imagers. The ﬁrst
GaN-based QWIP was demonstrated in 2003 by Hofstetter et al. [Hofs 03].
The device grown by MBE on a c-sapphire substrate relies on twenty n-doped
GaN/AlN QWs with well and barrier thickness of 2 nm sandwiched between two
Al0.5Ga0.5N contact layers. The photoresponse of the device peaked at 1.76 μm
and allowed detection at 1.55 μm. The peak responsivity was estimated to be
0.1 mA/W at 10 K and the photocurrent could be observed up to T = 170 K. In
2005, Ushida et al. reported a GaN/AlN QWIP operating at room temperature

446
Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
at 1.47 μm with a top Schottky contact [Uchi 05]. The device contains 50 QWs
with 1.42-nm-thick GaN wells and 3.14-nm-thick Si-doped AlN barriers. The
maximum responsivity was estimated to be 0.11 mA/W for a DC bias of
15 V at room temperature. Photoconductive devices were also demonstrated
at a peak wavelength of 1.6 μm using strain-compensated GaN/AlN superlat-
tices [Baum 05a]. The large dark current associated with these photoconductive
QWIPs probably arising from defect-mediated leakage paths prevented operation
beyond 120 K. Later, Hofstetter et al. demonstrated photovoltaic QWIPs at tele-
communication wavelengths operating up to room temperature, using GaN/AlN
superlattices grown by MBE [Hofs 06] or MOCVD [Baum 06a]. These photovol-
taic devices were shown able to detect a modulated laser beam at 1.55 μm at
frequencies up to 2.37 GHz [Gior 07]. Although a combination of ISB absorption
and tunneling eﬀects within the superlattice were originally evoked to explain
the photovoltaic mechanism of detection [Baum 05b], it was shown through a
systematic study of short-period GaN/AlN superlattices with diﬀerent well and
barrier thicknesses that the photovoltaic detection mechanism arises from optical
rectiﬁcation [Hofs 07]. Such a second-order optical non-linear process is allowed
in GaN/AlN QWs because of the asymmetric potential induced by the spontan-
eous and piezoelectric polarization discontinuity [Nevo 06c]. It was shown that
by replacing the GaN/AlN QWs by QDs, a factor of 60 could be gained in terms
of maximum responsivity, and that the temperature for peak responsivity could
be as large as 160 K instead of 80 K for QWs [Hofs 10].
QWIP detectors have also been investigated at far-infrared wavelengths by
Sudradjat et al. [Sudr 12]. The device relies on a double-step QW design, where
two diﬀerent (Al)GaN compositions are used both in the wells and in the bar-
riers in order to create a virtually ﬂat multiple-quantum-well potential-energy
proﬁle. The device exhibits photocurrent at a peak wavelength of 23 μm (13 THz
frequency) up to 50 K, with a responsivity around 7 mA/W.

Quantum dot infrared photodetectors
The ﬁrst quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIP) in the GaN/AlN
material system were reported at liquid-nitrogen temperature by Doyennette
et al. [Doye 05], and at room temperature by Vardi et al. [Vard 06]. Samples
containing twenty-one periods of 1-nm-high GaN QDs with 3-nm-thick AlN
barriers were grown by MBE on AlN-on-sapphire templates. The electron
population of the QDs was provided by silicon doping of the GaN layer at a
nominal concentration of 1 × 1020 cm−3. The QD density was estimated to be
in the range 5−7 × 1011 cm−2. All samples exhibit TM-polarized absorption in
the 1.45–1.67 μm range ascribed to the intraband transition from the ground
s state to the pz excited state [Doye 06]. In contrast to standard QDIPs based
on vertical transport, the operation of these QD detectors relies on in-plane
conductivity of photoexcited electrons in the 2-ML-thick GaN wetting layer.
The current is collected by two Ti/Al/Ti/Au metal contacts deposited on the

surface and annealed to enhance metal diﬀusion into the semiconductor layers,
as illustrated in Fig. 12.19a.
Figure 12.19b shows transmission and photocurrent spectra at room tem-
perature of a GaN/AlN QDIP at telecommunication wavelengths. The device
exhibits photocurrent only for TM-polarized light, following the intraband s-pz
selection rules. Because the pz state is at a lower energy than the WL ground-
state, it was pointed out that the transfer of photoexcited electrons to the
WL could involve the absorption of optical phonons [Doye 06]. This mechan-
ism explains the blueshift of the photocurrent spectra with respect to the QD
absorption. This interpretation was further supported by the observation of an
exponential increase of the photocurrent with temperature. The peak respons-
ivity of the GaN/AlN QDIPs was measured to be in the range 8–12 mA/W at
300 K under 10 V applied bias. Further studies have shown that deep levels in
the AlN barrier layers may also contribute to the photocurrent, giving rise to
negative photoconductivity eﬀects [Vard 10].
Photocurrent under TE-polarized light attributed to bound-to-bound s-pxy
intraband transitions in GaN/AlN QDs has also been reported in the 5–8-μm
mid-infrared spectral range [Vard 09]. The photocurrent mechanism was ex-
plained in terms of lateral electron-hopping, giving rise to in-plane conductivity.
12.5.3
Quantum cascade photodetectors
Quantum cascade detectors (QCD) are ISB photovoltaic devices, which can be
operated at zero bias [Gend 04]. The unit cell of a QCD device consists of an
active QW where ISB absorption takes place, and of an extractor stage used
to transfer photoexcited electrons from one period to the next one, giving rise
to a photovoltage in an open-circuit conﬁguration, or to a photocurrent if the

448
Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
device is loaded on a resistor. The absence of dark current stemming from the
operation at zero bias is particularly favorable to enhance the signal-to-noise ra-
tio and to improve the dynamic range and integration time of infrared imagers.
Another appealing feature of QCDs is their intrinsically low capacitance, which
enables high-frequency response. QCDs have been demonstrated in several ma-
terial systems: namely, GaAs/AlGaAs, InGaAs/InAlAs, and InGaAs/AlAsSb,
operating at wavelengths in the range 2.1–84 μm [Gior 09]. For mid-infrared
QCDs, the design of the extractor stage relies on multiple QWs whose thickness
is sequentially increased to achieve a ladder of ground states separated by the
energy of one LO phonon. This design allows for fast electron transfer through
the extractor via enhanced electron–LO-phonon interaction.
GaN-based quantum cascade photodetectors
The ﬁrst GaN-based QCD was
demonstrated in 2008 by Vardi et al. [Vard 08a]. In contrast to GaAs- or
InP-based QCDs, the design of the extractor region makes use of the polar-
ization discontinuity between GaN, AlN, and AlGaN. Figure 12.20a shows the
conduction-band proﬁle of this GaN-based QCD. The active QW consists of an
n-doped 6 ML-(1.56-nm)-thick GaN well with a 4-ML-(1-nm)-thick AlN barrier.
The extractor is formed by a superlattice containing 4-ML-thick Al0.25Ga0.75N
wells and 4-ML-thick AlN barriers. The composition of the AlGaN layers has
been chosen to engineer the band-bending in the extractor region in order to
achieve an energy ladder of the ground states of the extractor QWs with an
energy separation close to the LO-phonon energy. The device grown by MBE
contains forty periods of active regions between two Al0.25Ga0.75N contact layers
n-doped with Si at 1 × 1019 cm−3.

Figure 12.20b shows the ISB absorption and photovoltage spectrum measured
at room temperature under TM-polarized irradiation. The absorption spectrum
is structured into three peaks corresponding to the absorption of active QWs with
a thickness of 5, 6, and 7 MLs, respectively. The photovoltage is maximum at a
wavelength of 1.7 μm, which corresponds to an active QW thickness of 6 MLs.
The fact that the responsivity is smaller for a QW thickness of 5 or 7 MLs is
explained by the misalignment of the active QW excited state with respect to
the highest energy state in the extractor. The calibrated peak responsivity was
measured to be ∼10 mA/W (∼1000 V/W) at λ = 1.7 μm. The responsivity
decreases from its maximum value by a factor of ∼3 at λ = 1.5 μm.
In order to tune the peak QCD responsivity at 1.3–1.55 μm, Sakr et al.
have reported an optimized design of the extractor and active QWs [Sakr 10].
The active region is composed of a 1.5-nm-thick GaN QW doped with silicon
at 5 × 1019 cm−3 and 1-nm-thick AlN barriers. The extractor consists of four
periods of 1-nm-thick Al0.3Ga0.7N QWs with 1.5-nm-thick AlN barriers. The
QCD structure with forty periods sandwiched between Si-doped Al0.3Ga0.7N
contact layers was grown by MBE. Figure 12.21a shows a TEM image, which
reveals abrupt interfaces as well as good reproducibility of the layer thickness.
As shown in Fig. 12.21b, the photovoltage spectrum at room temperature is
peaked at 1.42 and 1.50 μm, with a full width at half maximum of 120 meV
(λ = 1.37−1.57 μm) in line with the absorption spectrum.
The presence of the internal ﬁeld oﬀers an additional degree of freedom for the
design of GaN-based QCDs, making the band engineering quite ﬂexible. It also
provides a symmetry-breaking of the potential in the active QW, which permits
ISB transitions not only between the ground e1 and ﬁrst excited state e2 but also

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
between e1 and the second excited state e3, the latter transition being forbidden
in a symmetric potential. This feature has been exploited for demonstrating a
two-color GaN/AlGaN QCD [Sakr 12a]. The design relies on an active GaN QW
supporting three bound states and on a multi-QW stage with two state ladders
for eﬃcient extraction of electrons from the e2 and e3 states of the active QW
(see Fig. 12.22a). A sample containing forty periods sandwiched between two
Si-doped Al0.3Ga0.7N contact layers was grown by ammonia-MBE on an AlN-
on-c-sapphire template. Figure 12.22b presents the ISB photovoltage spectrum
of the QCD device at room temperature. Two photovoltage peaks are observed
at 1.7 and 1 μm under TM-polarized illumination. These two peaks correspond
to the photovoltage generated by the e1e2 and e1e3 transitions, respectively, in
agreement with the ISB absorption measurements and with the simulation of
the band diagram. It should be noted that the 1-μm detection wavelength is the
shortest value ever reported for an ISB detector, whatever the material system.
Another illustration of the ﬂexibility of the design of GaN-based QCDs is the
demonstration of simpliﬁed QCD device with an alloy extractor [Sakr 12b]. As
shown in Fig. 12.23a, the sophisticated multiple QW extractor region is replaced
by an Al0.58Ga0.42N thick layer, whose composition is chosen to produce an
internal ﬁeld of −0.4 MV/cm and achieve a graded potential. A forty-period
structure was grown by ammonia MBE on an AlN-on-c-sapphire template. The
active QW consists of an 8-ML-thick GaN layer n-doped with Si and two AlN
barriers with a thickness of 2 nm and 1 nm, in growth order respectively. The
thinner AlN barrier is designed to force photoexcited electrons to predominantly
tunnel to the right extractor in growth order. As seen in Fig. 12.23a, the active
QW supports two bound states while the thick alloy layer supports more than ten

bound states, with some of the excited states in close resonance with the active
QW excited state. The thickness and composition of the alloy extractor have
been chosen in order to achieve an energy separation between the ground state
of the extractor and that of the next-period active QW close to the LO-phonon
energy. As illustrated in Fig. 12.23b, the device exhibits at room temperature
both TM-polarized ISB absorption and photovoltage at a peak wavelength of
1.9 μm. This simpliﬁed design oﬀers many advantages in terms of robustness and
growth simpliﬁcation. It is also easily scalable in terms of target wavelength.
Ultrafast operation of quantum cascade photodetectors
GaN-based QCDs are
intrinsically very fast devices. The intrinsic speed limitation is determined by
the carrier transit time from one period to the next one across the extractor
stage. The intrinsic speed of GaN/AlGaN QCDs has been assessed by time-
resolved degenerate pump-probe measurements at 1.55 μm wavelength of the
device photocurrent [Vard 11].
Figure 12.24 shows the photocurrent as a function of the pump-probe delay.
The dip at zero pump-probe delay is due to the saturation of the ISB absorption
in the active QWs. The dynamics of the photocurrent is governed by competing
mechanisms, i.e. the ISB relaxation of photoexcited electrons to the ground state
of the active QW and the tunneling of electrons into the extractor followed by
the transit through the extractor. Based on a rate equation model [Vard 11], the
best ﬁt to the experimental measurements, shown by the solid line in Fig. 12.24,
corresponds to an ISB scattering time in the active QW of 0.1 ps and a transit
time through the extractor of 1 ps. The intrinsic frequency bandwidth of the
GaN-based QCD is then expected to be above 160 GHz.
In practical QCD devices, the frequency bandwidth is limited by the extrinsic
RC time constant, where R is the access resistance and C the active region

capacitance. The electro-optical frequency response of GaN/AlGaN QCDs was
ﬁrst investigated by Vardi et al. [Vard 08b]. The devices based on the design
described in [Vard 08a] were processed in the form of square mesas with 50 Ω
coplanar access lines for the top and bottom metallic contacts. The size of the me-
sas was 25 × 25 and 17 × 17 μm2. The central part of the top surface of the mesas
was kept free from metallization in order to allow illumination at a 45-angle of
incidence onto the surface. The electro-optical response was investigated by meas-
uring the photocurrent at λ = 1.55 μm under illumination by an RF-modulated
laser diode. As shown in Fig. 12.25, the frequency response is that of a ﬁrst-order
RC ﬁlter with a cut-oﬀfrequency at −3 dB of 11.4 GHz and 19.7 GHz for the
25 × 25 μm2 and 17 × 17 μm2 mesa detectors, respectively. The value of the ac-
cess resistance and of the active region capacitance was estimated from separate
S-parameter measurements. It was found that the capacitance scales with the
mesa surface, and is as low as 45 fF for the 17 × 17 μm2 mesas. The access resist-
ance was deduced to be 210 (180) Ω for the 17 × 17 μm2 (25 × 25 μm2) mesas.
In order to push the cut-oﬀfrequency even further, it is necessary to decrease
both the capacitance and the contact resistance. The capacitance can be reduced
by decreasing the device surface or by increasing the number of periods of active
regions. In order to improve the top contact resistance, one solution is to metallize
the whole top surface of the mesa QCDs. This imposes illumination of the mesa
QCD from the side facet. Figure 12.26a shows a top view of a QCD processed
along these guidelines [Sakr 13]. The sample structure is the same as shown
in Fig. 12.21 (described in Ref [Sakr 10]). The QCDs with a peak detection
wavelength of 1.5 μm are processed in the form of square mesas with a size of

GaN-based intersubband light emitters
ISB light emission has been widely investigated in various III–V material sys-
tems, such as InGaAs/InAlAs, GaAs/AlGaAs or InAs/lnSb, in the mid-infrared
spectral range and in the THz frequency domain. These intense research eﬀorts
translate into the demonstration of high-performance unipolar lasers relying on
either current injection or optical pumping, such as the quantum cascade laser
[Fais 94] or the quantum fountain laser (QFL) [Gaut 97]. III-nitride semicon-
ductors, because of their large conduction-band oﬀset, oﬀer the potential to push
the ISB emission to much shorter wavelengths, while oﬀering prospects for high-
performance lasers at THz frequencies, because of the large LO-phonon energy in
this material system. ISB light emission has been investigated in III-nitride-based
QWs or QDs using linear or non-linear optical processes. In the following we
review the progress achieved so far.
12.6.1
ISB light generation in GaN-based QWs through non-linear
optical processes
In semiconductor QWs, the second-order non-linear susceptibility is known to
be strongly enhanced, when the waves are in close resonance with ISB trans-
itions [Bouc 90]. However, since the second-order non-linear susceptibility is
identically zero in a potential with inversion symmetry, an asymmetric poten-
tial is required to beneﬁt from the ISB resonance enhancement. This is the
case for hexagonal-phase GaN/AlGaN QWs grown along the c-axis which nat-
urally exhibit an asymmetric saw-tooth potential. Large second-order non-linear
susceptibilities were predicted by Liu et al. [Liu 00] in GaN/AlGaN QWs at
near-infrared wavelengths due to ISB resonant enhancement.
The observation of room-temperature light emission by an ISB second-
harmonic generation process (SHG) was ﬁrst reported by Nevou et al. in lightly
doped GaN/AlN QWs grown on AlN/c-sapphire templates [Nevo 06c]. The
sample contained 200 periods of 10-ML (2.6 nm) thick GaN wells separated by
3-nm-thick AlN spacer layers. The QWs were designed to exhibit three bound
states in the conduction band with almost identical e1e2 and e2e3 ISB transition
energy corresponding to a wavelength of ∼2 μm. Under optical pumping by an
optical parametric oscillator (OPO), light generation at a wavelength of ∼1 μm
was observed. The harmonic power spectrum versus pump wavelength clearly

showed a resonant enhancement of SHG at the pump wavelength of ∼2 μm,
which corresponds to the double-resonance condition with the e1e2 and e2e3
ISB transitions. The conversion eﬃciency was found to be sixteen times larger
in the QW sample than in a reference bulk GaN sample, and could be enhanced
further by increasing the doping concentration in the QWs.
12.6.2
Intraband emission of GaN-based quantum dots via a resonant
Raman process
The emission properties of GaN/AlN QDs associated with intraband radiative
recombinations have been studied by Nevou et al. [Nevo 08]. The investigated
sample consisted of 200 periods of GaN/AlN QD layers with a dot height and
diameter of 1.7 ± 0.1 nm and 6 ± 1 nm, respectively. The sample exhibited TM-
polarized s-pz intraband absorption peaking at 1.55 μm. Under TM-polarized
optical excitation of the side facet at a wavelength of 1.37 μm, a back-scattered
emission at 1.48 μm was observed at room temperature. The emission was found
to be TM-polarized as expected from the s-pz transition selection rules. This
emission wavelength, made possible by the large conduction-band oﬀset oﬀered
by GaN/AlN heterostructures, is the shortest value ever reported for an ISB
emitter, whatever the material system.
The intraband emission was ascribed to a resonant Raman process involving
zero-momentum LO phonons, as illustrated in Fig. 12.27. Such resonant Raman
emission process is expected to be selective in terms of dot height, since it involves

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
only the QDs within the size distribution, which can satisfy the energy conser-
vation requirement. As a consequence, it was pointed out that the observed
broadening of the emission, ∼9 meV, should reﬂect the homogeneous linewidth
of the pz-s transition. It was also predicted that the resonant Raman process can
provide population inversion and stimulated gain under intense optical excitation
[Nevo 08]. In order to obtain further insight into the homogeneous broadening of
the s-pz intraband transition, non-linear hole burning measurements have been
performed on the same sample [Nguy 10]. A value of the homogeneous linewidth
of ∼15 meV has been obtained at a temperature of 5 K, which is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the homogeneous broadening achieved in GaN/AlN QWs (∼40 meV
estimated from absorption measurements [Nevo 06b]).
12.6.3
Intersubband luminescent devices
It is well known that in contrast to its interband counterpart ISB luminescence
is not an eﬃcient process. The radiative time associated with ISB spontaneous
emission is in the nanosecond range in the near-infrared, and in the tenths of a
microsecond range in the THz domain. In contrast, non-radiative ISB scattering
at short infrared wavelengths is dominated by electron–LO-phonon interactions
and proceeds on a subpicosecond time-scale, while at long infrared wavelengths
it is dominated by electron–electron or electron-impurity scattering as well as
interface roughness or alloy disorder diﬀusion and proceeds on tenths of a pico-
second. In both cases, this translates into a very weak ISB luminescence eﬃciency.
It should be noted that this does not hinder the realization of high-performance
ISB lasers, since, in the population inversion regime, short stimulated radiat-
ive time as well as large stimulated gain can be achieved because of the strong
oscillator strength associated with ISB transitions.
Room-temperature ISB luminescence from GaN/AlN QWs at near-infrared
wavelengths around 2 μm was ﬁrst reported by Nevou et al. [Nevo 06a,
Nevo 07b]. The investigated samples contained 200–250 periods of 2.1-nm (8-ML)
thick GaN wells separated by 3-nm-thick AlN spacer layers. As shown in
Fig. 12.28a, the QWs support three bound electron states. Under continuous-
wave optical excitation at 0.98 μm wavelength in resonance with the e1e3 ISB
absorption, a TM-polarized emission related to the e3e2 ISB transition was ob-
served at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 12.28b. The peak wavelength
was as short as 2.1 μm. The internal quantum eﬃciency was estimated to be
∼0.3 μW/W of pump power. This low value is a consequence of the adverse
eﬀect of non-radiative electron scattering mechanisms. Accounting for the small
collection eﬃciency, the actual power of the detected emission was around 10 pW.
A large enhancement of the detected emission power (0.3 μW) could be achieved
by Driscoll et al., under intense pulsed optical excitation by an optical parametric
oscillator [Dris 09]. The investigated sample contained 200 periods of Si-doped
GaN/AlN QWs with a slightly smaller QW thickness (1.8 nm), leading to an
ISB emission wavelength of 2.05 μm.

12.6.4
Towards THz quantum cascade lasers
Although ISB luminescence has been observed at near-infrared wavelengths,
demonstration of lasing action in III-nitride based heterostructures through
either electrical injection or optical pumping remains quite challenging in this
spectral range, beside some theoretical propositions to make use of Raman pro-
cesses [Sun 06]. One reason stems from the ultrafast non-radiative ISB scattering
via LO-phonon emission, which is expected to impose very large injection-
current or pumping-power density to achieve population inversion. It was pointed
out in a few theoretical works that the situation would be much more favor-
able at long infrared wavelengths corresponding to the THz frequency domain
[Jova 04, Sun 05, Bell 08, Bell 09]. In GaAs-based materials currently used
for THz QCLs, there is a considerable slow-down of non-radiative scattering
mechanisms when the ISB transition energy is not suﬃcient for allowing emission
of optical phonons [Kohl 01].
It was also shown that GaN-based materials paves the way for THz QCLs op-
erating at temperatures much above room temperature [Bell 08, Bell 09]. Indeed,
one intrinsic reason limiting the operation of GaAs-based THz QCLs to cryogenic
temperatures is the small energy of the LO phonon in GaAs (36 meV, 8.2 THz).
As the temperature is increased, electrons in the upper lasing subband acquire
suﬃcient thermal energy for activating fast (<1 ps) non-radiative relaxations via
LO-phonon emission towards the lower lasing subband, hence ruining the popu-
lation inversion. As illustrated in Fig. 12.29, GaN-based QCLs should not suﬀer

from these parasitic non-radiative channels because of the large energy of the
LO phonons (∼90 meV), almost three times higher than in GaAs. In addition,
standard III–V semiconductor devices (such as GaAs-based QCLs) cannot be
operated in the 4.6–11 THz frequency range because of their Reststrahlen band,
i.e. the spectral region where the material is completely opaque due to absorption
by optical phonons. The larger energy of optical phonons in GaN oﬀers prospects
for THz quantum cascade devices, which can operate in a much broader spectral
range from 1 to 15 THz.
The ﬁrst attempt to fabricate GaN-based QCLs at a target frequency of
7.5 THz was reported by Terashima and Hirayama using GaN/InAlGaN QWs
and then GaN/ Al0.2Ga0.8N QWs grown by RF MBE [Tera 09, Tera 10]. The
authors claimed the observation of THz spontaneous emission at low temperat-
ures, but the emitted power was too small to allow measurement of the emission
spectrum. By growing a similar GaN/Al0.2Ga0.8N QCL structure on a low-
dislocation-density free-standing GaN substrate, a strong improvement of the
emitted power was reported, as well as the observation of a quite sharp electro-
luminescent line at 1.37 THz [Tera 11]. All these designs were based on a resonant
phonon scheme where a fast depopulation of the lower lasing state is provided by
LO-phonon emission. However, it was shown by Yashida et al. that this resonant
phonon scheme may not be the most appropriate design for providing suﬃcient
gain for lasing action, because of the broadening of the subband levels caused by
the very strong interaction between electrons and LO phonons in GaN [Yasu 12].
Observation of ISB electroluminescence at THz frequencies has been repor-
ted using in-plane transport of electrons at room temperature in GaN/AlGaN
step QWs [Juli 11]. The device relied on forty periods of Al0.1Ga0.9N/GaN/
Al0.05Ga0.85N step QWs exhibiting ISB absorption at 2.1 THz [Mach 10]. Two
ohmic contacts have been processed on the surface of the device to contact the
2D electron gas in the step QWs. Under application of a bias, some electrons
in the ground subband with suﬃcient in-plane kinetic energy could be scattered
into the ﬁrst excited subband, giving rise to an ISB spontaneous emission peak-
ing at 2 THz, as illustrated in Fig. 12.30. It should be noted that although
this mechanism opens prospects for fast modulated THz light sources, it cannot
provide population inversion.

transport. Right: TM-polarized electroluminescent spectrum at room tem-
perature under 15 V applied bias (bottom curve) and transmission spectrum
at 4 K for TM- and TE-polarized light (top curves).
One requirement for GaN-based QCLs is the control of vertical transport,
which has proved to be elusive until recently. One main diﬃculty stems from the
large densities of dislocations and other structural defects that are typically found
in III-nitride materials, especially when grown on highly lattice-mismatched sub-
strates. Such defects can act as strong scattering centers as well as leakage current
paths. Negative diﬀerential resistance (NDR) has been observed at room tem-
perature in GaN/AlGaN double-barrier structures and attributed to resonant
tunneling [Kiku 02, Bely 04, Golk 06, Bayr 10]. However, the current–voltage
characteristics exhibit hysteresis with two levels of current, and the NDR is not
reproducible for positive and negative voltage sweeps as well as for multiple scans,
and disappears at low temperatures. These anomalies have been related to the
presence of activated ﬁlling of trap states in double-barrier resonant tunneling
diodes [Sakr 11].
More convincing results have been achieved using GaN/AlGaN multiple QWs.
In particular, sequential resonant tunneling has been reported in superlattices
grown on free-standing GaN substrate containing GaN/AlGaN-coupled QW
structures, and THz emission has been observed, though it could not be unam-
biguously ascribed to ISB emission [Sudr 10]. In a recent work, vertical electron
transport has been investigated in a seven-period GaN/AlN MQW structure,
leading to the observation at room temperature of ﬁve reproducible NDR fea-
tures assigned to the successive resonant electron tunneling between the ground
(e1) and the ﬁrst excited (e2) states of adjacent QWs in a quantum cascade-like
conﬁguration [Sakr 12c].

Intersubband transitions in low-dimensional nitrides
12.7
Conclusions
In this chapter we have reviewed the ﬁeld of ISB transitions in III-nitride semi-
conductors, which has emerged within the last ﬁfteen years following the progress
in terms of epitaxial growth of these materials with atomic-layer thickness con-
trol. The basic properties of ISB transitions in nitrides have been presented,
with special emphasis on the eﬀect of internal electric ﬁelds. We have also
presented an overview of the insight gained on physical properties through spec-
troscopic investigations of ISB transitions in nitride QWs and QDs. Finally, we
have described the progress towards ultrafast ISB devices at ﬁber-optics tele-
communication wavelengths, as well as recent developments towards ISB devices
operating in the THz frequency domain, which will certainly constitute a driving
line of research in future years.

The slow light in gallium nitride

13.1
Introduction
Development of all-optical schemes of quantum communication and informa-
tion processing implies a precise control of photon pulses—in particular, their
spectral and temporal characteristics. For example, the operation of quantum lo-
gics, random-access memory, data synchronization, and network buﬀering need
a deﬁnite delay of photons (Matsko et al., 2001; Milonni, 2002). Therefore “slow
light”, propagating with a velocity much lower than the speed of light in va-
cuum, has been studied intensively in recent years. Related eﬀects include “fast
light” with the superluminal pulse velocity, and “stopped” light, when an optical
pulse is trapped (or caught) (Bigelow et al., 2003-1). The slowdown of light can
be done by diﬀerent methods. Many of them assume the use of dispersive me-
dia with a sharp change in optical parameters, e.g., a dielectric with a resonant
absorption line (Loudon, 1970) or an atomic system with electromagnetically
induced transparency (Harris, 1997). The factor of optical dispersion being a
fundamental eﬀect in any material is important for other ways to produce the
slow light. In the following section we review brieﬂy the history and methods of
producing slow light, focusing basically on the eﬀects of the optical dispersion.
GaN and related materials are very promising for diﬀerent applications
in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. This wide-gap semiconductor possesses
strong excitonic resonances, and thus is suitable for light retardation due to
optical dispersion. The value of longitudinal–transverse splitting, ℏωLT , about
1 meV promotes the emergence of exciton–polaritons, stable up to room tem-
perature. Section 13.3 describes the basic mechanisms of the light transfer in
GaN, and Section 13.4 considers experimental facts concerning slow light in
GaN obtained by time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy and supported by other methods.
Since the thesis by D. S. Rozhdestvensky, of 1912 (Frish, 1976), there has been
a long tradition of using optical dispersion studies to determine the parameters of
a resonant line. The so-called “Rozhdestvensky hooks” in the interference pattern
near an atomic line hold information on its oscillator strength. It does not need
to be justiﬁed that exact data on excitonic resonances are needed to design
smart semiconductor devices. In Section 13.5 the advantages of time-of-ﬂight
spectroscopy for determining the parameters of bulk semiconductors, as well as
investigating the ﬁne structure of an excitonic spectrum, are demonstrated.

Slow light: history and recent studies
477
A light pulse consists of a large number of frequency components, each of
those travels in a dispersive medium with its own phase velocity. This can cause
a certain degree of pulse distortion, its broadening, and reshaping on an energy–
time plane. Section 13.6 is devoted to a description of the distortion of the light
pulses in GaN and ZnO.
In this chapter we restrict ourselves to relatively low-temperature and lin-
earity in the intensity regimes, bearing in mind the limitations of our approach.
Namely, strong interaction with phonons can signiﬁcantly modify the light trans-
fer at elevated temperatures. At high excitation powers it can be also aﬀected
by non-linear eﬀects. These processes require detailed study.
We thank A. A. Toropov and B. Monemar for many fruitful discussions of the
slow-light phenomenon in semiconductors, and the help of G. Pozina and J. P.
Bergman in experimental studies is highly appreciated.

Slow light: history and recent studies
13.2.1
Group velocity in a medium with optical dispersion
In spite of very diﬀerent mechanisms, accomplishing the slowdown of light, two
systems—(i) dielectric with a resonant absorption line, and (ii) atomic system
with electromagnetically induced transparency—have a common feature. This
is the strong dispersion of optical parameters near a resonant frequency ω0
(Fig. 13.1). Speciﬁcally, the variation of the refractive index n ≡n(ω) results
in the slowdown of group velocity vg(ω).
The fundamental study of light propagation and its group velocity in a dis-
persive medium was initiated more than a century ago by A. Sommerfeld and
L. Brillouin. In their works a number of interesting eﬀects, such as the emer-
gence of precursors, was predicted, and they drew attention to the variation of

The slow light in gallium nitride
the group velocity in a resonant system (Brillouin, 1960). While the phase velo-
city vph(ω) = c/n(ω) is the speed at which the phase front of a monochromatic
wave propagates through a medium with n(ω), the group velocity characterizes
the motion of the envelope of the wave packet of a photon pulse. The commonly
used expression for vg(ω) as a function of frequency ω is written as
vg(ω) = ∂ω
∂k =
c
n(ω) + ω ∂n
∂ω
(13.1)
Here, k(ω) = ω/(c

ε(ω)) is a wavevector of light; ε(ω) is the dielectric function
of a medium, c is the light speed in vacuum. Strictly speaking, eq. (13.1) is
valid for transparent (non-absorbing) media only, otherwise the group velocity
may become meaningless; see below. The denominator in eq. (13.1) represents
the group refractive index, whose real part deﬁnes vg(ω). If the spectrum of an
optical pulse falls into the range of strong n(ω) dispersion, the factor ∂n/∂ω
starts to dominate the denominator. As a result, vg(ω) decreases greatly. At
the same time, the phase velocity is not inﬂuenced by this factor; its variation is
much smaller. Both the group index and wavevector are complex in an absorbing
dielectric; thus, the wave passing through such a medium is attenuated.
It was recognized long ago that in the medium with an absorption line the
group velocity, given by eq. (13.1), may be superluminal in certain frequency
ranges, may be negative in others, and may even equal zero. This intricate
situation has been discussed in several textbooks (e.g., Born and Wolf, 1965).
It was noted that the term of group velocity loses its strict physical meaning
for an electromagnetic wave in the region of abnormal dispersion (Landau and
Lifshitz, 1984). Recent analysis of the group velocity concept for absorbing media
can be found in Sonnenschein et al. (1998). For a Gaussian light-pulse the possib-
ility of the vg(ω) variation from negative to superluminal values has been shown
theoretically, along with the unchanged width of the pulse for many exponential
absorption depths (Garrett and McCumber, 1970). It is worth mentioning that
this abnormal vg(ω) does not imply violation of the causality principle, but is
instead a consequence of pulse-shape distortion. The superluminal group velo-
city of a pulse does not imply energy transfer (Loudon, 1970), which cannot be
faster than the phase velocity of light in vacuum (Crisp, 1971). The same is true
for the information, whose transfer rate is limited by c (Molotkov, 2010). This
limitation is important for quantum cryptography, because it provides security
in communication systems.
The passage of light-pulses through the resonant medium was intens-
ively studied during the epoch of the development of communication systems
(Vainshtein, 1976). The theory of energy transfer has been developed for spatially
dispersive media with exciton-polaritons, both inﬁnite and bounded (Bishop and
Maradudin, 1976; Agranovich and Ginzburg, 1984). The remarkable decrease of
energy transport velocity down to a velocity of 4 × 103 m·s−1 has been predicted
for the exciton–polariton at a resonance in a semiconductor, e.g., GaAs (Puri
and Birman, 1981). It has been demonstrated that a width of exciton-polaritons

resonance Γ strongly aﬀects this velocity. Its value may decrease by orders of
magnitude with decreasing Γ/ω0 value (Loudon et al., 1997).
13.2.2
Light propagation in semiconductors near excitonic lines
The rise of lasers in the early 1960s drastically intensiﬁed experimental studies
of the light velocity. First, such studies were carried out in gaseous systems. The
velocity of an optical pulse in an Ne absorption cell placed inside a self-locked He–
Ne laser has been found to be superluminal (Faxvog et al., 1970). In a direct-gap
semiconductor GaAs, the pioneer observation of the slow light propagation at an
exciton-polariton resonance has been achieved using a cross-correlation technique
(Ulbrich and Fehrenbach, 1979). Polariton group velocity in these experiments
varied from c/3.6 down to c/2000, when the central frequency of a dye laser
was tuned through the resonance in a 3.7-μm-thick GaAs crystal. The shape of
the laser pulse on the time-intensity plane, registered by the cross-correlation
technique, was almost unchanged during this tuning.
The results obtained in GaP:N crystals (Chu and Wong, 1982) seemed to
verify the theoretical predictions (Garrett and McCumber, 1970). In this exper-
iment a laser was tuned to a weak bound A exciton line. The samples have dif-
ferent doping and thicknesses up to 76 μm. The vg(ω) values extracted from the
experimental data exceeds c, tends to inﬁnity, and even becomes negative. The
shape of the pulses did not exhibit signiﬁcant distortion, similar to that in the ex-
periment by Ulbrich and Fehrenbach. It is worth noting that the cross-correlation
technique used at that time did not allow the registration of the pulse spectrum
on the energy–time plane, which remained unknown. The results of the dramatic
vg(ω) variation stimulated extensive theoretical investigations in order to exclude
the causality violation. The model of the pulse propagation has been improved
to take into account the ﬁnite thickness of the systems (Halevi and Fuchs, 1985).
A variety of time-resolved (TR) techniques were used to study the polariton
eﬀects in CuCl. It has been found that the propagation time in the 1.7-mm-
thick sample was about 150 ps for the lower branch polariton and 700 ps for
the higher one (Segawa et al., 1978). A variation of the polariton lifetime in
the bottleneck region was investigated by exploiting a narrowband tunable laser
(Segawa et al., 1979). TR non-degenerate four-wave mixing was used to determ-
ine the damping constant of the exciton-polaritons (Masumoto et al., 1983).
At low temperature, the value of this parameter is as small as 10 μeV with
20 meV detuning from the exciton resonance. It increases by an order of mag-
nitude when approaching the transverse exciton energy. The temporal response
of photoluminescence (PL) in this material was measured in both geometries—
conventional “backward” and “forward”, i.e., with registration from the opposite
side of a sample (Kuwata et al., 1988). The additional peak in the spectra near
the Z3 exciton of the backward PL is ascribed to the light reﬂection from the
opposite boundary of a crystal. It was noticed that such a signal propagates at
double distance in its passage inside a crystal. In view of the delay-time of this

480
The slow light in gallium nitride
reﬂex, the group velocity smaller than c/104 has been found near the exciton
resonance (Ikehara and Itoh, 1991). It was not a record, however, because in
some materials, such as anthracene, the measured velocity of exciton-polaritons
was below that of sound (Vidmont et al., 1983).
The time-of-ﬂight measurements using the pulsed lasers proved the polariton
mechanism of the light transfer in a set of II–VI crystals. It has been recognized
that the temporal evolution of the pulse cannot be described by the vg(ω) of
the wave packet, when it propagates very close to the exciton resonance in CdSe
(Itoh et al., 1981). To perfectly ﬁt the data on the light propagation in CdZnTe it
has been necessary to take into account all excitonic resonances, but not only the
ground one (Sermage et al., 1998). With increasing excitation power, non-linear
eﬀects such self-induced transparency were observed at the A exciton in CdSe
(Nielsen et al., 2001) and at the bound exciton in CdS (J¨utte et al., 1996). This
transparency induces a noticeable increase in vg(ω) in these materials. In Cu2O,
quantum beats were recorded by the time-resolved technique. They appear due to
interference between the lower and upper polariton branches of the 1S quadrupole
exciton (Fr¨olich et al., 1991).
Very demonstrative results on slow light in semiconductors have been ob-
tained with the development of new detection systems. When the Hamamatsu
streak camera was invented it became possible to record the optical precursors in
CuCl (Sakai et al., 2002), predicted long ago (Brillouin, 1960). PL propagation
experiments at the donor-bound exciton (BX) resonance in single-crystal ZnO
(Xiong et al., 2005) have shown the curvature of the PL streak on the energy–
time plane, not demonstrated previously. The group velocity at the resonance
(3.36 eV) was measured to be 6 × 106 m·s−1. The signal was attenuated by
95% on traversing a 0.5-mm-long crystal. The temperature-dependent measure-
ments showed an absence of noticeable delay at 100 K, corresponding roughly
to the thermal detrapping of the donor-bound excitons. Xiong et al. have ex-
plained their results using a disputable model of propagation of a bound-exciton
polariton that hampers, in part, the timely recognition of their results.
In GaN, two mechanisms of the light transfer—namely, ballistic (polaritonic)
and diﬀusive—has been found with the studies of both PL and photon-pulse
propagations (Shubina et al., 2008). The light velocity of 2.1 × 106 m·s−1 has
been registered. The pulses of a tunable ps or fs laser do not excite PL when
they propagate below the bound exciton lines. This allowed demonstration of
the distortion of the photon pulses without PL admixture. The results of light
propagation in GaN were considered as promising for realization of all-optical
schemes (Wiersma, 2008).
Analysis of the time-of-ﬂight data obtained in forward and backward ex-
perimental geometries using the developed model to ﬁt the pulse shape on
the energy-time plane has allowed determination of the low-temperature para-
meters of free and bound excitons in GaN (Shubina et al., 2011-1) and ZnO
(Shubina et al., 2011-2). The homogeneous width of exciton-polaritons in these
semiconductors at 2 K was found to be 0.01 and 0.003 meV, respectively, with

measurements in the close vicinity of free exciton resonances. The minimal docu-
mented group velocity in ZnO was about c/(1.5 × 103), but the applicable delay
value corresponds roughly to c/100, due to strong signal attenuation.
The time-of-ﬂight studies of ps and fs laser pulses propagation through
(ZnCd)Se (Godde et al., 2010) have exhibited the purely polaritonic mechan-
ism of light transfer in this compound. In a 745-μm-thick crystal, the time delay
up to 350 ps has been recorded. This maximal delay decreases to 50 ps at 55 K,
presumably due to the thermal quench of the exciton-polaritons. Time-resolved
measurements in diﬀerent crystal orientations have been attemped to check the
valence-band ordering in ZnO (Chen et al., 2011). Using the model developed in
Shubina et al. (2008), Chen et al. have demonstrated that the diﬀusion process in
ZnO is practically absent, due to low concentration of numerous types of donors,
bounding excitons in the studied perfect crystals.
All these studies of the slow light in semiconductors have been performed
at relatively low temperatures, while the resonant scattering by phonons, which
is signiﬁcant in polar semiconductors (Klingshirn, 2007), can modify and even
prohibit the light retardation as the temperature rises. In particular, the output
signal at room temperature can be the scattered light predominantly. The delay
of this signal is much smaller than that needed due to the high group velocity
at the energy of scattered photons (Shubina, 2012).
13.2.3
Electromagnetically induced transparency and other eﬀects
In spite of the noticeable delay, the light slowing in the semiconductors due
to optical dispersion was inevitably accompanied by dramatic attenuation of
signal intensity. Therefore, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
(Harris et al., 1990; Boller et al., 1991) was considered as a new approach to
obtain the slow light. The EIT phenomenon features two previously incompatible
characteristics: steepness of the ∂n/∂ω dependence, and small attenuation in a
certain energy range (see Fig. 13.1b). EIT exists in the presence of two optical
ﬁelds in a medium possessing three quantum levels arranged in the so-called Λ-
scheme (Fig. 13.1b, inset). A laser beam (linearly polarized) couples two states
in the left arm of the scheme. For a weaker probe beam (circularly polarized), the
ground state is a coherent superposition of the two lowest levels. Thus, quantum
interference takes place due to two alternate excitation paths from this ground
state to the excited state. To provide the interference, a frequency diﬀerence
between the coupling and probe electromagnetic ﬁelds should be equal to the
diﬀerence between the two lowest levels in the Λ-scheme. When the coupling
beam has suﬃcient intensity it depletes the superposition state. This opens a
narrow window (hole) in the spectrum, where attenuation of a probe beam is
signiﬁcantly suppressed. Thus, the probe beam can propagate almost without
loss and with very slow speed.
The most impressive results in light retardation by EIT have been obtained
using atomic systems. In a gas of sodium atoms cooled by a laser beam down
to 50 nK, the velocity of an optical pulse of 17 m·s−1 has been achieved

482
The slow light in gallium nitride
(Hau et al., 1999). Progress in this ﬁeld presented opportunities for deterministic
photon synchronization by integration of a single-photon source with the
slow-light medium (Eisaman et al., 2005; Hau, 2011). However, to provide the
∂n/∂ω steepness required, the transparency window should be very narrow. In
other words, the operating bandwidth is small. Due to the uncertainty principle,
only the pulses of microsecond duration can propagate in such a narrow window,
while shorter pulses would be strongly distorted.
For optical buﬀers there is one more limitation besides possible pulse-shape
distortion. This is the ratio of the delay to the output pulse duration ν, which
should be much higher than unity, while for EIT a best ratio of 4:1 has been
reported. It was achieved in an isotopically pure lead vapor with a pulse ve-
locity of c/165 and 55% intensity transmission for a 10-cm-long cell (Kasapi
et al., 1995). Some corroboration of the possibility for improving the ratio in a
slow-light medium has been published (Boyd et al., 2005), though more realistic
considerations, which take into account the background absorption and signal
broadening, were not so optimistic. On the other hand, certain improvements in
the delay time–bandwidth product has been demonstrated (Tucker et al., 2005;
Matsko et al., 2007). The reshaping procedure has been proposed to correct, in
part, the shape of output pulses (Eastman et al., 2004).
Besides EIT, various mechanisms have been exploited to realize the slow-
down of light in dispersive media. These include coherent population oscillations
(Bigelow et al., 2003-2), stimulated Brillouin scattering (Okawachi et al., 2005),
stimulated Raman scattering (Dahan et al., 2005), and so on. The relatively
large ν value of about 7 with three-fold attenuation was realized in a spec-
tral hole between two resonant lines in rubidium vapors at room temperature.
However, the operating rate of such a system is even lower than at EIT. Some
of these experiments have somewhat disputable explanations (Aleksandrov and
Zapasskii, 2004).
The light slowdown can be achieved using semiconductor quantum-well/
quantum-dot absorbers and optical ampliﬁers, where the process can be
controlled electrically together with changing the pump laser intensity and
wavelength (Chang-Hasnain and Chuang, 2006). In doped quantum wells, light
slowing down to c/40 induced by the hyper-Raman process has been reported
(Frogley et al., 2006). Note that this value was found indirectly from analysis of
the changes in absorption spectra. Another possible way to slow down light is
the use of photonic crystals (Vlasov et al., 2005), because higher-order photonic
modes have a low group velocity.
A promising trend in slow-light formation is related to the solitons—single
waves excited in a non-linear medium. The soliton can propagate at a long dis-
tance without noticeable attenuation and broadening (Zabusky and Kruskal,
1965). This is why the solitons, also called “optical bullets”, can be used for
information transfer with controllable delay in all-optical schemes (Silberberg,
1990). Full stop of the light signal due to its transformation into a stand-
ing soliton has been observed in rubidium vapor (Bajcsy et al., 2003). This

stop took place because in atomic vapors and Bose–Einstein condensates
the group velocity of the solitons decreases monotonically after the switching
oﬀof a pumping laser (Rybin et al., 2005). These optical bullets can propag-
ate in a system of optically coupled waveguides, when they are modulated
in a speciﬁc way to suppress the light dispersion (Lederer and Biehlig, 1994;
Sukhorukov and Kivshar, 2006; Minardi et al., 2010). Solitons have been observed
in semiconductor microcavities (Taranenko et al., 2001; M. Sich et al., 2012).
Progress in these studies is very fast, though control over the light velocity
and overcoming the delay–bandwidth product problem is still a challenge.
13.2.4
Light scattering and diﬀusion
The multiple scattering process of photons is associated with intriguing phe-
nomena, such as weak localization and coherent back-scattering of light (Van
Albada and Lagendijk, 1985). The distinction between the group velocity and
the velocity of energy transfer in the scattering media has been established during
numerous discussions (Barabanenkov and Ozrin, 1992; Van Tiggelen et al., 1993).
Experimentally, photon scattering and diﬀusion has been studied in various dis-
ordered media, including dielectrics (Van Albada et al., 1991), polymers (Garcia
et al., 1992), liquid crystals (Van Tiggelen et al., 1996), semiconductors (Gamarts
et al., 1977, Ivchenko et al., 1977), and even interstellar space, for which the the-
ory of light propagation was developed for the ﬁrst time (Chandrasekhar, 1960;
Gnedin, Dolginov, 1963). In the scattering medium containing TiO2 spheres of
220 nm diameter, which were considered as resonant Mie scatterers, the velocity
of electromagnetic energy transfer diﬀers by an order of magnitude from the
phase velocity (Van Albada et al., 1991). Note that this medium is optically in-
ert, i.e. no reabsorption of phonons inﬂuences the energy transfer. The multiple
scattered light has been also observed in ensembles of ZnS nanocrystals which,
in this case, act as disordered media (Kurita et al., 1999).
In semiconductors, where exciton-polariton modes can be supported, it was
ﬁrst demonstrated that scattering by neutral donors can aﬀect the line shape of
exciton-polariton emission. It has been observed in GaAs by means of meas-
urements with temporal resolution in backward reﬂection geometry (Steiner
et al., 1986). Time-of-ﬂight studies of perfect GaN crystals carried out in com-
bination with far-ﬁeld angular measurements have revealed the diﬀusion of the
photons due to the elastic resonant scattering by neutral donor-bound exciton
(BX) centers (Shubina et al., 2008).
The principal issue for the semiconductors is that one needs to distinguish
between three competing processes: i) ballistic (polariton-like) propagation with
conservation of energy and wavevector k; ii) elastic scattering with the conser-
vation of energy, when the direction of the photon movement may be changed;
and iii) inelastic relaxation or scattering with changing k-vector and energy. It
is diﬃcult to distinguish the inelastic scattering and reabsorption/re-emission
processes, which frequently imply exciton–phonon interaction (Ivchenko, 2005).

484
The slow light in gallium nitride
Both the relaxation process and the inelastic scattering, in contrast to the elastic
one, are usually accompanied by spectral diﬀusion, i.e. change of the emission
energy.
To discriminate between the diﬀerent mechanisms one should take into ac-
count that the strength of the scattering is sensitive to the detuning from an
exciton resonance, being diﬀerent for elastic and inelastic types of scattering. The
cross-section of photon–acoustic phonon scattering has a weaker (non-resonant)
frequency-dependence in the vicinity of a donor-bound exciton line (Calleja and
Cordona, 1977). Thus, the delay of light will vary more or less monotonically
with energy. On the contrary, the spectral dependence of the delay due to the
resonant diﬀusion should increase strongly with the approach of the bound ex-
citon energy (Shubina et al., 2008). The intensity quenching of the transmitted
emission and its cut-oﬀenergy have to depend on concentration of the scattering
centers. Besides, scattering by acoustic phonons should be strongly temperature-
dependent (Wan et al., 1993; Stanley et al., 1997; Viswanath et al., 1998). The
spectrum of transmitted PL resembles a redshifted “Prussian helmet”, when the
exciton–acoustic-phonon interaction is substantial (Liptay et al., 2007). Thus,
the peculiarities of a pulse spectrum, its delay dependencies, and distortion can
help to distinguish between the mechanisms.
13.3
Two mechanisms of light transfer in GaN: ballistic
and diﬀusive
When considering light transfer in wide-gap semiconductors, two main physical
mechanisms are important. First of all, optical dispersion results in the modi-
ﬁcation of phase and group velocities of light-propagation, and generally, delays
optical pulse propagation compared with that in the empty space. Second, im-
perfections of structure result in the scattering of light, which may give rise to
diﬀusive propagation of photons. The coexistence of these two mechanisms was
demonstrated for GaN (Shubina et al., 2008), and their schematic presentations
are shown in Fig. 13.2. In the following, we outline basic theoretical concepts of
light-propagation in crystals.
13.3.1
Optical dispersion in a medium with several resonances of free
and bound excitons
The key quantity deﬁning the optical properties of the system is the frequency
ω and the wavevector k-dependent dielectric susceptibility tensor ˆϵ(ω, k), which
links the Fourier components of the displacement D and electric E ﬁelds inside
the medium:
Di(ω, k) = ϵij(ω, k)Ej(ω, k),
(13.2)
where i, j = x, y, or z are Cartesian coordinates. In what follows we consider
for simplicity the following speciﬁc geometry of experiment: light propagates
along the c-axis of the GaN, k ∥z ∥[0001], and the ﬁeld is linearly polarized

in the xy plane, say, along the x axis. We neglect eﬀects related to possible
optical activity of the wurzite GaN. In this case, the vector nature of the ﬁelds
can be disregarded, and the dielectric susceptibility tensor reduces to a scalar
ϵ(ω, k) = ϵxx(ω, k) ≡ϵyy(ω, k).
For frequencies in the vicinity of the fundamental absorption edge of GaN,
the main contribution to the dielectric susceptibility is provided by excitons.
The dielectric polarization P of a single exciton resonance is related to its
center-of-mass wavefunction, and satisﬁes the following equation of motion
(Ivchenko, 1982)

P = d2

(13.3)
were ω0 is the exciton resonance frequency, M is its eﬀective mass, Γ is the non-
radiative damping, and d is the optical dipole moment of the exciton. Hence,
the displacement ﬁeld D = ϵbE + 4πP, where ϵb is the background dielectric
constant (whose frequency and spatial dispersion can, as a rule, be neglected),
and the dielectric susceptibility in the presence of a single exciton resonance has
the form:
ϵ = ϵb −
fω0
ω −ω0 −ℏk2
2M + iΓ
,
(13.4)
where we have introduced the oscillator strength of the exciton transition
f = 4πd2/(ℏω0). The longitudinal–transverse splitting of the bulk exciton
is given by ℏωLT = ℏω0f/εb. Hence, dielectric susceptibility has a pole at
the frequency ω corresponding to the excitation frequency of the exciton,
ω = ω0 + ℏk2/(2M) −iΓ. Equations (13.3) and (13.4) allow for simple classical
interpretation where the optically active exciton state is treated as a classical
dipole with a certain frequency, which is excited by the electromagnetic wave
propagating in the system.

486
The slow light in gallium nitride
In real semiconductors there are several types of excitons contributing the sus-
ceptibility ϵ(ω, k) (Hopﬁeld, 1960; Lagois, 1977). In particular, in wurzite GaN
there are three types of free excitons A, B, and C related to the corresponding
subbands of the complex valence band. Moreover, inevitable impurities, such as
Si and O donors, cause exciton localization and give rise to bound exciton (BX)
states. Disorder in any real system also causes ﬂuctuations of excitonic para-
meters, primarily the resonance frequency ω0, i.e. inhomogeneous broadening.
As a result, in the excitonic spectral region the dielectric susceptibility can be
modeled as
ϵ = ϵb +

(13.5)
where the subscript j enumerates all relevant excitonic states and the convolution
with the Gaussian function takes into account the inhomogeneous broadening,
and Δj is the corresponding broadening of the resonance.
For completeness, we present here the expressions for the oscillator strengths
of various exciton transitions. In semiconductors the dipole moment of an exciton
is determined by the interband momentum matrix element and the wavefunction
of an electron–hole pair at coinciding coordinates (Elliott, 1957). In particular,
for free excitons we obtain
ffree =

(13.6)
where aB is the excitonic Bohr radius, e is the electron charge, and pcv is the in-
terband momentum matrix element. If excitons are bound to donors with density
N, the oscillator strength takes the form (Rashba and Gurgenishvili, 1962)

where Ψ(r) is the envelope function describing exciton center-of-mass local-
ization on the donor. For an order-of-magnitude estimate one has fbound ∼
ffreeNVloc, where Vloc is the localization volume of the exciton.
Knowledge of the dielectric function ϵ(ω, k) makes it possible to model
the pulse propagation in the medium and extract all excitonic parameters for
comparison of the delays and pulse shapes with available experimental data.
Neglecting the spatial dispersion Mj →∞in eq. (13.5), one can estimate the
delay time TB as a function of light frequency via the sample thickness L and
the group velocity vg(ω) = dω/dk, where k = k(ω)(ω/c)Re{

The more elaborate approach is based on the ﬁtting of the transmitted pulse
shape, assuming the linear regime of the light propagation. To that end, the
spectrum of the impinging laser pulse E0(ω) is approximated as a Gaussian with
central frequency ω0 and the envelope maximum at time t = 0. The amplitude
and phase of the pulse in the frequency domain are given by the Fourier transform
at a crystal boundary. We introduce the amplitude transmission coeﬃcient of the
sample T(L, ω), which can be calculated via ϵ(ω, k) using the Pekar boundary
conditions. It takes into account the multiple reﬂections of light at the crystal
boundaries (Landau and Lifshitz, 1984; Chui, 1992), as well as its delay and
attenuation during propagation inside the medium. This allows recasting of the
transmitted ﬁeld in the form (Vainshtein, 1976; Shubina et al., 2011-2)
E(L, t) =

(13.9)
where E0(ω) is the Fourier transform of the pulse incident on the sample surface.
For direct comparison with streak-camera images we use the Gabor transform,
providing time-frequency representation of the transmitted intensity.
13.3.2
Diﬀusive propagation of light and resonant photon scattering
by bound excitons
The light delay caused by excitonic contributions to the dielectric susceptibil-
ity equation (13.5) is a purely coherent process, which can be interpreted as a
ballistic propagation of exciton–polariton whose group velocity diﬀers from the
speed of light in vacuum. Additionally, excitons can scatter light, resulting in dif-
fusive propagation of photons inside the medium. This eﬀect can be described in
terms of the classical diﬀusion equation for the coordinate- and time-dependent
concentration of photons nω(z, t) with the frequency ω:
∂nω(z, t)
∂t
= Dω
∂2nω(z, t)
∂z2
−nω(z, t)
τω
,
(13.10)
where Dω is the photon diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and we have also introduced the
phenomenological photon lifetime τω in the system caused by real absorption
processes.
The key quantity in eq. (13.10) is the photon diﬀusion coeﬃcient related to
the group velocity, vg(ω), and the mean free path, ltr(ω), as
Dω = vg(ω)ltr(ω)
3
.
(13.11)
If the main contribution to the photon scattering is provided by the donor-
bound excitons, then the photon mean free path can be expressed via the donor
concentration density N and the transport cross-section, σtr(ω), as
ltr =
1
Nσtr(ω).
(13.12)

488
The slow light in gallium nitride
The cross-section has a resonant character (Berestetskii et al., 1971; Lang
et al., 2007):
σtr(ω) ∝
d4
BXω4
0,BX
(ω −ω0,BX)2 + Γ2 .
(13.13)
This equation should be averaged with the Gaussian distribution of ω0,BX
(similar to eq. (13.5)) to allow for inhomogeneous broadening in a real system.
Obviously, the enhancement of the bound-exciton scattering cross-section results
in signiﬁcant reduction of the photon mean free path and, correspondingly, of the
diﬀusion length if the photon energy approaches the bound-exciton resonance.
This provides a signiﬁcant delay in light propagation via imperfections in a
crystal.
Interestingly, due to the interplay of the light diﬀusion and light absorption,
the delay time has a non-trivial dependence on the sample length. If absorption
processes are relatively weak, the delay time for the diﬀusive propagation is
given by
TD = L2
2Dω
,
(13.14)
and is quadratic in the sample length. However, if absorption is suﬃciently strong
(τω ≪TD), the delay time depends linearly on the sample thickness (Shubina
et al., 2008):
T ′
D = L

 τω

.
(13.15)
This regime can be realized in GaN epilayers in the vicinity of neutral donor
bound-exciton resonances.
13.4
Time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy of light propagating through
GaN crystals
Studies in time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy have been performed using high-quality
free-standing GaN layers grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), which
have the width of neutral donor bound-exciton lines in the range 0.3–0.5 meV,
pronounced A and B free exciton (FE) lines, and the lowest carrier concentration
of (5−8)×1015 cm−3. The samples have diﬀerent thicknesses L varying from
0.3 to 2 mm. A tunable Ti:sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser and a tunable
picosecond laser (Mira-HP) were used as light sources. A Hamamatsu streak
camera with a temporal resolution less than 20 ps was used for detection.
Two geometries of measurement have been exploited: i) the conventional
backward one, and ii) forward transmission spectroscopy, when the light was
detected from the opposite side of a sample with respect to the excitation. In
the backward geometry with the 4.66 eV laser energy excitation, the doublet of
BX lines related to the Si and O donors dominates the spectrum. The emission
peaks of A and B FE are well resolved. In the transmission geometry, the PL

signal quenches above a certain boundary, which is very close to the BX doublet.
The sharp cut-oﬀis at 3.470 eV in the 1-mm-thick sample, being smoother
and redshifted in the 2-mm one. Below the cut-oﬀenergy the transmitted PL
resembles that registered in the conventional geometry, with one remarkable ex-
ception. It appears with a delay in time, which increases gradually towards the
cut-oﬀ, attaining 470 ps in the 1-mm sample (Fig. 13.3).
The sharp decrease in intensity of the transmitted PL near the BX lines is
accompanied by the change of its decay curves (Fig. 13.4). The initial fast-decay
characteristic for conventional backward PL disappears. It appears that related
processes are terminated before the light exits the crystal, which is possible if
their characteristic times are less than the time of the light-propagation. At
slightly lower photon energies, where the delay is smaller, the fast component in
the PL decay curves is recovered. The characteristic decay times of the transmit-
ted PL increase slightly towards the BX lines, probably due to scattering as the
photon passes through the sample. Note that this is in the energy range where the
FE-BX scattering process has been suggested to be important (Korona, 2002). It
can contribute to the observed diﬀerence in the decay of no-phonon PL lines and
their phonon replicas, because the latter are in the ﬁeld of relative transparency
(Monemar et al., 2010).
To study the propagation of the laser pulse solely, without superimposing
the transmitted pulse with the PL excited by the laser, the central energy of
an fs laser pulse was tuned to 3.465 eV. The bending of the pulse towards BX
is observed in the samples of diﬀerent thicknesses L, similar to PL. The delay
time-dependence on L is very close to the linear (T ∼L), as is expected for
polariton propagation. An additional curved streak (“reﬂex”) has been recorded
in the 1-mm sample of best quality (Fig. 13.5). It appears at times corresponding

to the triple coherent passage of a wave packet, as a result of reﬂection from
sample boundaries. The appearance of the reﬂex is an argument in favor of
the predominant ballistic passage. From the point of common sense, a photon
should lose any memory on an initial direction after a few acts of scattering. This
conclusion has been proved by the modelling of the shapes of an optical pulse
with the ballistic and diﬀusive propagations.
With a temperature rise, the free exciton resonances are shifted towards lower
energies, following the band-gap variation. It results in the attenuation of the
pulse, until its full disappearance. The reﬂex corresponding to the polariton
propagation vanishes ﬁrst from the time-resolved images, while certain decay of
the optical signal, given by its curvature, exists up to 80–100 K. This temperature
corresponds roughly to the delocalization of bound excitons. At higher temper-
atures one can anticipate the enhanced resonant interaction between excitons
and phonons, whose population increases with a rise in temperature.
To gain additional information on the light transfer we have measured the
far-ﬁeld angular dependence of the transmitted light. We expected the ballistic
propagation to yield a narrow angular diagram of the output intensity, while the
diﬀusion could provide a much broader distribution, because the light should
be scattered into the full solid angle. For this experiment we used a Xe lamp,
whose light passed through a monochromator impinging normally to the sample
surface. The measurement revealed a superposition of two components in the
transmitted signal: relatively narrow and broad ones (Fig. 13.7). The intensity
ratio between these two components depends on the photon energy. The ballistic

part dominates in the region of relative transparency, while the diﬀusive one
prevails in the vicinity of the BX resonances.
The coexistence of two regimes of light propagation without signiﬁcant broad-
ening of the pulse implies that their delay times do not diﬀer strongly. It is worth
the reminding that for conventional diﬀusion the delay time would increase quad-
ratically with the sample thickness. However, in the spectral range of strong
absorption the diﬀusion also obeys the linear dependence (see Section 13.3 and
eq. (13.15)). The photons that travel along a twisting trajectory, which diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from a direct way of polariton propagation, simply cannot reach
the opposite faces of the crystal. The applicability of the two models presented

inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton line has been taken into account by
means of convolution with the Gaussian with the width Δj. The free exciton
energies were obtained from the ﬁtting of reﬂection spectra. For each of these
resonances, ℏΓj is about 10 μeV, which is comparable with the homogeneous line-
width of an exciton-polariton in other semiconductors (Masumoto et al., 1983).
The inhomogeneous width ℏΔj is taken close to the average PL linewidth in
PL spectra. The oscillator strength for the bound excitons fBX ≈2 · 10−5 is
taken somewhat smaller than a value estimated according to eq. (13.7) for the
measured electron concentration ∼5 · 1015 cm−3. The exciton localization ra-
dius is assumed to be approximately equal to the Bohr radius (Suﬀczynski and
Wolniewicz, 1989). The oscillator strength for the A, B, and C excitons is found
as a result of simultaneous ﬁtting of cw transmission and delay-time spectra. In
the next section a more precise way of determining the excitonic parameters will
be described.
In the diﬀusive regime the photon mean free path ltr(ω) and, respectively, the
diﬀusion constant Dω are determined by the light-scattering cross-section σ(ω);
see eqs. (13.11)–(13.12). A reasonable ﬁt of the delay dependencies has been
obtained with γ = 0.75 meV and the same fBX as in the ballistic model. Strictly
speaking, eq. (13.13) describes scattering caused by individual BX; that is, it is
valid only for the diluted donor concentration, i.e. when N1/3λ ≪1, where λ is a
wavelength inside the crystal. Near BX, this is fulﬁlled for N ∼1015 cm−3, while
our best sample has N ∼5 · 1015 cm−3. However, two types of the donor are in
GaN; namely, a neutral oxygen donor on the N site, and a neutral silicon donor
on the Ga site. In PL spectra the lines at 3.4714 eV and 3.4723 eV are associated
with an A exciton bound to these O and Si donors, respectively. With full width
at half maximum (FWHM) for both lines about 0.3 meV (Monemar et al., 2008),
they are well separated. Thus, the scattering is dominated by the O donor centers,
hence the actual N is smaller than the Hall electron concentration. Besides, the
spatial distribution of donors is inhomogeneous. The donor clusters act as virtual
scattering centers with eﬀective concentration and localization radius.
These simulations show that the experimental data can be reasonably ﬁtted in
both models. The method of separating the polaritonic and diﬀusive components
will be discussed in the next section. The calculated dependencies clarify the
origin of the sharp cut-oﬀof light propagation near BX resonances. It appears
because the group velocity of light strongly decreases here, while the resonant
absorption and scattering is enhanced.

Excitonic parameters of wide-gap semiconductors
Until now there is huge variation in reported values of the exciton oscillator
strength and longitudinal–transverse splitting (ωLT ) of GaN, which is caused
by various factors, such as diﬀerent elastic strain (Gil et al., 1996), the quality
of samples (Reynolds et al., 2002), and, certainly, by the speciﬁcs of various
experimental techniques. A high value of ωLT can be obtained if it is deﬁned via

a separation between photoluminescence (PL) peaks, which are inﬂuenced by a
thermalization process (Gil et al., 1998). To extract the free exciton parameters
the modeling of reﬂectivity spectra are commonly used (Stepniewski et al., 1997;
Torii et al., 1999). The uncertainty of this method is caused by a large number
of ﬁtting parameters. Besides, both PL and reﬂectivity techniques probe an area
close to the sample surface rather than its volume, whereas the properties of
these regions may diﬀer (Lagois, 1981; Monemar et al., 2010). As a result, the
published data on the homogeneous width for an A exciton vary from 0.2 meV
(Torii et al., 1999) up to 2.1 meV (Toda et al., 2005). This parameter is commonly
considered as an empirical damping constant (Γeff), though it has a certain
physical meaning. Its inverse value characterizes the dephasing/relaxation time
(Takagahara, 1985).
To reﬁne the excitonic parameters of bulk semiconductors we have proposed
the following (Shubina et al., 2011-1, 2011-2):
i) To use the data on processes taking place inside the crystal; namely, cw
transmission and pulse propagation. When a sample is thick enough, the
surface eﬀects are negligible.
ii) To model the ballistic reﬂexes, because they do not contain any contribution
of diﬀusive photons.
The typical images of the reﬂexes, emerging with the shift of the pulse energy
from the BX lines towards a transparency region, are presented in Fig. 13.9. The
delay and shape of these reﬂexes reproduce the variation of the group velocity,
which in turn is controlled by the parameters of the exciton resonances. The
light spot marked 0L is reﬂected straight from the front surface. Those marked
as 2L and 4L correspond to the two-fold and four-fold passage of the light inside

the crystal, respectively. Besides the exclusion of the diﬀusion factor, the use
of n·L replicas increases the accuracy of the methods, because their study is
equivalent to the study of crystals with exactly the same parameters but of
diﬀerent thicknesses.
Figure 13.10a illustrates the importance of the elimination of a diﬀusion
contribution. It shows the spectral dependencies of the delay times measured
along the pulses of diﬀerent energies for the same length of propagation; namely,
through the 2-mm-long sample and for 2L replicas in the 1-mm-long sample. The
delay time of the basic transmitted pulse in the 1-mm sample, multiplied by two
in order to simulate the 2-mm length, is also shown. Obviously, the delay times
per unit length are smallest for the 2L reﬂexes, when the photon scattering, en-
hancing the light path, is excluded. The diﬀerence in the dependencies for the
1-mm and 2-mm samples is related to diﬀerent donor densities, which inﬂuence
the scattering cross-sections. It can be used to estimate the contribution of the
diﬀusion and its parameters.
The simulation shows that the inﬂuence of the neutral donor bound excitons
is noticeable only at a distance less than 1–2 meV from their peaks. The oscillator
strength and homogeneous width of the BX excitons for the 1-mm sample are
found to be 5·10−6 and 1 μeV, respectively. These parameters are assumed to be
similar for both BX lines, related to the oxygen and silicon donors. A deviation
from these values exceeding 10% does not allow to reproduce the shape of the

reﬂexes shown in Fig. 13.9. The inhomogeneous width of the BX resonances is
determined by consideration of the light attenuation in the close vicinity of these
lines. A width of more than 35 μeV causes quenching of the higher-energy tail
of the reﬂexes at the energies where the signal is actually observed.
A similar approach has been applied to study ZnO (Shubina et al.,
2011-2). The overall pulse delay in this material, which reached 1.6 ns at 3.374 eV
with a 0.3-mm propagation path, is determined by the free exciton-polariton
resonances. The BX lines inﬂuence locally; they provide dips, cutting the pulses
into several parts, and induce extra retardation of light nearby. Because of the
large number of donor types, the partial density of each of them is apparently
not too high in the best ZnO samples. Therefore, the scattering and diﬀusion
of photons is not pronounced. The delay times of the replicas in ZnO occur
strongly proportional to the multiplicity of their passage. Both the directly trans-
mitted signal and replicas can be ﬁtted using the same values of the excitonic
parameters.
The reﬁned parameters of exciton-polaritons in GaN and ZnO are given
in Table 13.1. (The data on distant C exciton are not presented here). These
data demonstrate that the exciton–polaritons propagating within GaN at low
temperature have an homogeneous width in the order of 10 μeV, and the oscil-
lator strength is about 30% lower than the currently accepted values. In ZnO
the ℏωLT ≈3 meV turns out to be higher than the currently accepted 2 meV
(Klingshirn et al., 2010). The Γ value of 3 μeV at 2 K is the lowest among those

published for polaritons in semiconductors. The unusual transparency of ZnO
was noticed in the ﬁrst spectroscopic studies of its excitonic spectrum, when a
certain discrepancy was observed between the absorption data and the value de-
duced from the Kramers–Kronig analysis of reﬂectivity spectra (Thomas, 1960).
Note that markedly higher values of Γ would result in full opaqueness in the
transmission spectra in the range where the narrow BX lines can be clearly re-
solved. However, there is a certain uncertainty in the exact values caused by the
determination of the parameter a bit below the exciton peak. Some increase of
them can be predicted for the measurements directly at the resonance (Masumoto
et al., 1983).
Because even a very weak line causes noticeable absorption if a sample is
suﬃciently thick, the number of BX lines resolved by time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy
is higher than in the PL spectra. It allows us to reconstruct a ﬁne structure of
energy spectrum of bound excitons. The full list of BX lines and their parameters
in ZnO recorded by this method can be found in Shubina et al. (2011-2).

Distortion of optical pulse near excitonic resonances
A light pulse generally contains a superposition of light-waves of diﬀerent
frequencies. Each individual frequency component of the pulse travels at its
own phase velocity, which is determined by the refractive index of a mater-
ial (Vainshtein, 1976). When entering a dispersive medium, the envelope of the

498
The slow light in gallium nitride
pulse begins to change shape. The higher-energy tail of the pulse might move for-
wards or backwards with respect to the rest, depending on the sign of the group
index (Wiersma, 2008). In order to provide high-speed data-processing photonic
devices must operate with short pulses, fs or ps. The spectral width of such
pulses can approach several meV. In the close vicinity of an exciton resonance,
huge variation of all optical parameters takes place along the pulse spectrum.
It results in the curvature of the pulse shape on the energy–time plane and its
non-homogeneous attenuation. The following distortion with propagation of the
short light-pulses can be anticipated:
1. Shift of the “center of gravity” of a pulse to lower energy.
2. Asymmetrical modiﬁcation of the higher-energy and lower-energy fronts of
the pulse.
3. Cutting of the pulses into separated parts by narrow absorption lines.
4. Extra retardation of an optical signal near these lines.
5. Quantum interference (beating) between separated parts of the signal of
close energies.
These features can be found in experimental images of the laser pulses
propagating through GaN and ZnO crystals (see, e.g., Shubina et al., 2008,
2011-1, 2011-2). Note that there is a range of optimal thicknesses, where ﬁne
features such as the replicas and beating can be observed. For a distinct repres-
entation we have simulated the images of the fs laser pulses for two propagation
lengths (Fig. 13.11), using the model described in Section 13.3 and the excitonic
parameters extracted from the experimental data (Section 13.5). For direct com-
parison with the experimental images we use the Gabor transform with the
temporal window of ∼15 ps. With L ≈0.3 mm, the images reproduce the modi-
ﬁcation of the pulse shapes on the energy–time plane induced by the narrow BX
lines, further to the basic curvature and attenuation.
Figure 13.12 presents, for comparison, experimental images of fs and ps laser
pulses propagating through the 0.3-mm long ZnO sample. In general, the tunable
ps laser provides higher resolution at the time-of-ﬂight spectroscopy, which is
why it has been used to monitor reﬂexes in GaN and the ﬁne spectrum of BX
excitons in ZnO in our studies. By comparison with the image of the fs pulses,
one can conclude that the smaller the pulse duration the less the disturbance of
the pulse fronts. Thus, there is a chance for excluding the cutting of the pulse
by the narrow BX lines with proper choice of the laser wavelength.
The observed modiﬁcation of the optical pulses in the vicinity of exciton
resonances can inﬂuence the threshold and frequency characteristics of a set
of optoelectronic devices—high-frequency ones, or those where the light should
propagate a suﬃciently long way. Among them there are vertical cavity surface-
emitting lasers, and polariton lasers with a semiconductor microcavity. It also
concerns conventional laser heterostructures, where the light travelling through
a planar waveguide passes through a distance of 1–2 mm.

The slow light in gallium nitride

Concluding remarks
Our time-of-ﬁght studies of wide-gap semiconductors GaN and ZnO have demon-
strated that slow light transfer with a group velocity of ∼c/100 is possible in the
spectral range of strong optical dispersion near excitonic lines. Simulation of
the shape of laser pulses on the energy–time plane enables us to determine the
excitonic parameters of bulk semiconductors at low temperatures, as well as to
establish that the resonances in these materials must have a low damping and
limited broadening to allow the light propagation near them. Besides, time-of-
ﬂight spectroscopy opens a new route for reﬁning an excitonic spectrum of bound
excitons.
As anticipated, slowing down the light velocity by excitons is accompanied by
distortion of the light pulses and their strong attenuation. Moreover, a noticeable
delay in studied semiconductors has been observed only at relatively low temper-
atures. This limits the immediate use of the results obtained for photonics and
optoelectronics, which need in delay units operating at room temperature for
random-access memory, data synchronization, pattern correlation, and network
buﬀering. For all these purposes, it is necessary to have the delay of the light by
several times exceeding the pulse duration with reasonable intensity attenuation.
We believe that the time-of-ﬁght studies of various semiconductors, both polar
and nonpolar, over a wide temperature range will enable to make a ﬁnal conclu-
sion on the applicability of the optical dispersion in these materials to provide
the slow light.
In general, we should conclude that an ideal approach to produce the slow
light is currently absent, in spite of interesting results and certain progress in
this ﬁeld. It concerns both nonlinear eﬀects and the optical dispersion at exciton
resonances in semiconductors. Such a situation implies the necessity of further
investigation of diﬀerent mechanisms in various material systems, bearing in
mind that the study of optical dispersion is a fundamental issue for any method
of slow-light realization.

Nitride devices and their
biofunctionalization for biosensing
applications
Csilla Gergely
14.1
Introduction
The past two decades have witnessed considerable interest in biosensor develop-
ment. The heart of these hybrid analytical devices is the immobilized biologically
sensitive material integrated within a transducer. A biosensor ultimately con-
verts the biological information into a quantitatively measurable signal, usually
in the form of optical, acoustic, electrical, or magnetic responses. In the realm
of biosensors, semiconductor-based devices constitute a promising alternative
for molecular detection based on high-sensibility responses in electron transfer,
adsorption, surface recombination, photoconductivity, and light-induced contact
potential measurements.
Next-generation aﬃnity-based biosensors will require signiﬁcant improve-
ments in sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and parallelism in order to meet future needs in
a variety of ﬁelds, including in vitro medical diagnostics, pharmaceutical discov-
ery, and drug and pathogen detection. The interface between biological molecules
and semiconductor surfaces is a key issue in the development of eﬃcient devices
based on biomolecular recognition.
The use of high-sensitivity semiconductor materials such as nitrides can con-
siderably enhance biosensing performances. For example, indium nitride (InN)
has proven to have robust surface properties and unusually strong surface-
electron accumulation, and gallium nitride (GaN) reveals outstanding chemical
stability and is transparent, enabling easy optical readout, rendering nitrides as
very promising substrates for biological detection. In terms of interfacing them
with biological materials, nitrides also present the advantage of a relatively easy
functionalization due to their aﬃnity to various organic linkers. Nitrides can be
selectively functionalized with peptides produced by a biotechnological method
called “phage display”, which can be crucial when the retention of contrast in
multi-material components is necessary. Biomolecules’ capturing can be elec-
trically or optically monitored by metal semiconductor ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors or
photonic crystal resonances, respectively. Photonic crystals provide strong light
conﬁnement and can be designed to localize the electric ﬁeld in the low-refractive-
index region, which makes the sensors extremely sensitive to a small change of
refractive index produced by the biomolecular binding event. Moreover, their

nanostructured design makes them ideal candidates for the development of mini-
aturized biosensors with very low requirements in terms of volume of biological
material.
14.2
Conﬁgurations of nitride devices for sensing
Any biosensor system should include the analyte recognition, signal transduc-
tion, and readout processes. Sensors rely on measurable responses of the target
molecule, such as chemical reactions with electron transfer, adsorption, surface
recombination, photoconductivity, and change in contact potential with light.
These external chemical stimuli can drastically alter semiconductor properties,
and can be measured by monitoring surface current, potential, or impedance
characteristics. Hence semiconductors are ideal matrices, including the sensor
element and the transducer, for the development of a variety of chemical and
biosensor systems. The development of such sensing devices is always based on
the eﬀect resulting from the speciﬁc or selective interaction of an analyte with
the semiconductor surface. Such interaction will usually result in changes of the
electrochemical characteristics of the surface. The most important of these para-
meters are the space charge, the ﬁeld, and the potential. Once this interaction
has been characterized, a variety of sensing schemes can be envisaged.
Hence, creating chemical sensors or biosensors from semiconductors requires
precise chemical control of the surface chemistry—conditions necessary for op-
timizing the analytical characteristics of the sensor, such as selectivity, sensitivity,
detection limit, response time, and signal stability. Since analyte recognition
and detection result from the perturbation of the electro-optical properties of
the semiconductor surface and subsurface layers, there must be a speciﬁc and
reversible chemical interaction of the analyte with the semiconductor sensing
element. During recent decades, tremendous advances in materials science have
enabled excellent control of material growth processes, leading to high-quality
factor devices for the development of sensors and biosensors.
When sensing via optoelectronic devices, an eﬃcient and direct transfer of
charge between semiconducting substrates and bioorganic layers is required.
Typically semiconductors, such as GaN, InN, or AlGaN alloy systems, appear to
be very promising for bioelectronic applications, due to the good match of their
large, wide band-gap with the typical HOMO–LUMO gaps of organic molecules.
Moreover, GaN and AlGaN are extremely stable chemically and are naturally
biocompatible (Steinhoﬀet al. 2003).
Group III-nitride semiconductors present unique features for the development
of photonics-based devices due to the direct band-gap electroluminescence in
the blue and near-ultraviolet parts of their optical spectrum. Their signiﬁcant
electro-optic, piezoelectric, and non-linear coeﬃcients render the wide-bandgap
III-nitride epitaxial structures very attractive for the development of integrated
optical devices and circuits operating at wavelengths throughout the blue/violet
part of the visible spectrum and a substantial part of the near-ultraviolet

spectrum. Nitrides containing gallium, aluminum, and their alloys, or those with
low indium content, have been investigated widely within the last decades. InN
with a band-gap lying between 0.6 and 0.7 eV is the least-known material of the
nitride family (Davydov et al. 2002, Wu et al. 2002). InN alone, or combined with
GaN or AlN, oﬀers new perspectives in optoelectronics, solar cells, and terahertz
applications. Eﬀorts in recent years have provided crystalline-quality InN layers,
exhibiting an electron accumulation layer at their surface. The application that
can beneﬁt of this unusually high surface sensitivity is sensing (Lu et al. 2004,
Chen et al. 2006). It has also been demonstrated that InN samples grown by
molecular beam epitaxy and metal organic vapor phase epitaxy exhibit an
enhanced concentration of hydrogen near the surface (Darakchieva et al. 2010).
However, although hydrogen is expected to behave like a donor in indium nitride
(Limpijumnong et al. 2001), no correlation between the electron concentration
and the hydrogen concentration, both located near the surface region, has been
established yet. Wurtzite InN exhibits strong, intrinsic electron accumulation at
its surface, which is very advantageous in the design of high-sensitivity sensors.
Due to its transparency in the visible regime and its convenient optical band-
gap of 3.4 eV (at room temperature), GaN is a viable candidate for photonic-
crystal biosensor applications. In a typical sensing setup, design of the resonant
defect cavity in the photonic crystal is such that the resonant frequency of the
cavity matches the emission frequency of the molecule. The emission frequency
lies within the photonic band-gap, hence the mode is conﬁned within the resonant
cavity with little loss (high-quality factor). This resonant conﬁnement leads to an
increase in photon lifetime within the cavity. Moreover, the emission yield of the
biomolecule is also increased due to the high density of optical modes within the
defect region. This has enabled 25-fold ampliﬁcation of ﬂuorescence emission in
the cavity, approaching the limits of detection at single-molecule concentrations
(Dawson et al. 2008).
Miniaturization, keeping at the same time a large sensing area by assuring
high speciﬁcity of the sensing surface, is the challenge of current research in
biosensing. Nanostructured semiconductor substrates fulﬁl the miniaturization
and large-sensing-area requirements, and are ideal candidates for photonic-
based molecular detection, as they present unique possibilities for supporting
device functionality that includes strongly conﬁned and localized light emission.
Fluorescence enhancement of molecules inﬁltrated in Bragg-mirror and microcav-
ity structures has been reported previously (Palestino et al. 2007). Moreover,
inﬁltrated protein acts as an internal two-photon-excited ﬂuorescence emitter
and second-harmonic generator (Martin et al. 2009). Signiﬁcant enhancement
in the linear and/or non-linear optical responses of biomolecules, when embed-
ded in simple 1D photonic structures, compared to unstructured surfaces, has
enabled molecular detection with extreme (femtomolar) sensitivity (Estephan
et al. 2010).
Furthermore, (nitride) semiconductor-based sensors produce an electronic sig-
nal with much faster response times than conventional sensing methods. The

508
Nitride devices and their biofunctionalization
electrical output signals from the sensor can be digitized and used for quan-
tifying the concentration of the detected species. The device conﬁguration for
electric sensing is typically a transistor-type instrument.
A ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (FET) is a very eﬃcient device for converting a bio-
logical signal into an electrical signal, due to its sensitivity to changes in the
surface potential. Due to their high pH sensitivity and electrochemical stability,
aluminum–gallium nitride/gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN) solution gate ﬁeld-
eﬀect transistors are appropriate for monitoring enzymatic reactions (Steinhoﬀ
et al. 2003). Gate voltages induced by ions adsorbed onto the gate region mod-
ulate the source-drain currents, realizing the concept of the ion selective FET
(ISFET).
AlGaN/GaN-based high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMT) are ideally
suited for sensing, since they have a high electron sheet concentration in-
duced by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization of the AlGaN and the
GaN layer (Pearton et al. 2005, Kang et al. 2005). High-electron-mobility tran-
sistors of AlGaN/GaN have been employed as gas, chemical, biological, and
medical sensors due to their excellent sensitivity (Kang et al. 2007, Wang et al.
2007).
14.3
Functionalization of nitrides
When used for sensing, device functionality can be seriously limited by com-
plex phenomena at the solid/liquid interface, often resulting in a loss of activity
of biological molecules due to unfolding upon immobilization (Norde 1986). On
the other hand, surface modiﬁcation presents great possibilities to deﬁne the
sensing-material properties. Modiﬁcation of material surfaces is usually achieved
by chemical functionalization with a linker, (i) providing high biocompatibil-
ity, (ii) maintaining a low density of electronic defects at the material surface,
(iii) providing a high density of docking sites to speciﬁcally attach biomolecules,
(iv) lowering toxicity, (v) providing material stability (it inhibits oxidation), and
(vi) converting hydrophobic materials into hydrophilic to enable their transfer
into aqueous solution. The linker has to be chosen carefully for proper functioning
of the material. The functional coupling groups in proteins are either available in
the native form or are incorporated by chemical means or by genetic engineering.
Examples of materials coated with protein molecules through chemical
interactions are shown in Fig. 14.1. Frequently-used groups for performing bio-
molecular coupling to the material surface are citrate, thiol, and phosphane
groups (Katz et al. 2004). Exchange reactions with a stronger binding ligand
can lead to direct protein linking with a metal surface. This is possible with a
labile capping citrate layer, for example.
For covalent binding of molecules, complex chemistry such as thiolylation
(Neves et al. 2006) and silanization (Babu et al. 2004) are to be applied, providing
eﬃcient coupling of molecules to a substrate. To reach biocompatibility, InN has
to be functionalized with linkers, thereby reducing toxicity and ensuring the

materials’ stability (Stutzmannn et al. 2006). The InN surface naturally forms a
thin native oxide layer under ambient conditions, which enables direct coupling
of aminosilane molecules onto its surface (Chen et al. 2006).
A very good overview of functionalization strategies for semiconductors is
presented in Stutzmannn et al. (2006). Frequently, the biomolecules are co-
valently immobilized on the surface of the semiconductor substrate via linker
molecules. The main role of the linker molecules is to provide a high density of
docking sites for the attachment of biomolecules. The covalent immobilization is
achieved via the silanization approach with diﬀerent organosilanes such as amino-
propyltriethoxymethylsilane (APTES) or octadecyl-trimethoxysilane (ODMTS)
(Kang et al. 2005, Baur et al. 2005), taking advantage of the natural oxide of the
nitride surfaces, or via photochemical functionalization with protected amines
starting from the H-terminated GaN surface (Kim et al. 2006).
An alternative functionalization method is the selection of material-binding
biomolecules from a random biological library, based on the natural recognition
of proteins or peptides towards speciﬁc material (Brown et al. 1992, Whaley
et al. 2000). We have reported on surface modiﬁcation of the GaN and InN
semiconductor by speciﬁc 12-mer peptides produced by the combinatorial phage
display technique—an original technology for the identiﬁcation and application
of material-speciﬁc biomolecules (Estephan et al. 2008, Estephan et al. 2009,
Estephan et al. 2011). Due to their small dimensions and unique surface re-
cognition properties, peptides can be used further for controlled placement
of biomolecules on patterned surfaces. The peptide functionalization method
presents an easy-to-use alternative solution for the problems encountered in
existing sensing methods, due to the unwanted unspeciﬁc interactions. These
peptides and/or their derivatives are simply adsorbed from the liquid phase onto
the surface of the semiconductor, due to their aﬃnity for this material.

510
Nitride devices and their biofunctionalization
GaN is a semiconductor that reveals excellent chemical stability and biocom-
patibility (Steinhoﬀet al. 2003), rendering it very attractive for biomedical
applications too. Interfacing semiconductors with complex biological systems
require a physiological environment and a suﬃcient degree of biocompatibility of
the substrate. This already precludes the use of many materials for this purpose,
and/or requires the presence of speciﬁc buﬀer layers to increase the biocompat-
ibility. Therefore, application of natural biomolecules such as peptides during
functionalization could be desirable in many cases, such as the production of an
implantable optical sensor.
Currently, there is intense demand for downscaling to micro-/nanometer scale
when developing new sensing substrates, and they need also to present high bind-
ing selectivity and sensitivity for biological molecules. Miniaturization and a large
sensing area can be assured by nanostructured substrates such as photonic crys-
tals, and high speciﬁcity can be achieved by their proper functionalization, with
short peptides produced by phage-display technology. Typically, a 12-mer speciﬁc
peptide is extracted by means of several biopanning cycles in which a phage lib-
rary (expressing a large number of peptides) is exposed to the target of interest,
followed by washing, elution, and ampliﬁcation of the eluted phages and then
reexposure to the target (Whaley et al. 2000). After several biopanning rounds,
a speciﬁc peptide presenting high aﬃnity for the chosen target is obtained. We
have successfully elaborated the peptide sequences for numerous semiconduct-
ors (GaN, InP, GaAs, ZnSe, InAs, Si, InN, and so on) (Estephan et al. 2008,
Estephan et al. 2009, Estephan et al. 2011). Speciﬁc localization of peptides and
reversibility of functionalization was demonstrated, and the interactions between
the surfaces and its speciﬁc peptide have been measured.
As a proof of concept, for controlled placement of molecules via adhesion
peptides we employed ﬂuorescence. A nested square pattern was etched onto a
GaN wafer (Fig. 14.2), and the pattern obtained was formed by 30-μm-thick GaN
lines separated by 120-μm SiO2 spacing. The pattern was exposed to biotinylated
peptide, and then incubated with ﬂuorescent streptavidin.
When the surface obtained was observed under a ﬂuorescent microscope,
the tagged peptides were seen as grey lines in Fig. 14.2, corresponding to GaN
lines labeled by the GaN-speciﬁc peptide. The SiO2 regions did not reveal any
ﬂuorescence; thus, this part of the pattern remained unbound by the speciﬁc
peptide. In another application, similar selectivity was obtained when an indium
phosphide (InP) star-structure within an InP/SiO2 pattern, with a diameter of
the inner circle of the star of 80 μm, was functionalized with the InP-speciﬁc
peptide (Fig. 14.2).
Peptide route functionalization was found to preserve enzyme activity and its
secondary structure while adsorbed on a ZnSe ATR-crystal (Saab et al. 2010).
Peptides can resolve the toxicity problems of other promising semiconductors
too, with a direct band-gap such as InP (Estephan et al. 2009), rendering them
useful for optoelectronics, biomedical devices, and for ﬂuorescence applications
such as QDs.

pattern. The GaN lines are 30 μm thick, and the diameter of the inner circle

Speciﬁc adhesion of these peptides was used for the controlled placement of
biomolecules in porous silicon microcavities that were further used for optical
biosensing (Estephan et al. 2011). Improved streptavidin sensing (twenty-one-
times-lower detection limit) was obtained with peptide-functionalized porous
silicon microcavities, compared to sensing performed with devices function-
alized with the commonly used silanization method, suggesting that surface
modiﬁcation via speciﬁc peptides provides better interface layers for molecu-
lar detection. High-resolution atomic-force microscopy revealed the formation of
ordered nanometer-sized molecular layers when peptide-route functionalization
is performed. Hence, the obtained speciﬁc peptides proved to be ideal linkers for
surface modiﬁcation, opening the way for the elaboration of new, highly ordered
and nanometer-sized organic/inorganic materials.

Sensing examples with nitride-based devices
The basic interest of using a GaN substrate is due to its light-emitting properties
modiﬁed by exposure to a gas or liquid containing the molecule to be sensed for
chemical or biological agent identiﬁcation (Schalwig et al. 2002). Porous GaN
was used to fabricate a Pd Schottky contact gas sensor for hydrogen detection
(Yam et al. 2007). Hydrogen was measured as a current variation attributed
to the unique microstructure at the Pd/porous GaN interface, which allowed a
higher accumulation of hydrogen. This resulted in a stronger eﬀect of H-induced
dipole layer, and led to a signiﬁcant change in the electrical characteristics of
the porous sensor.
GaN Schottky diodes with catalytic platinum electrodes were used for de-
tection of hydrogen and hydrocarbon species, and H2, CO, and hydrocarbons

been measured between adsorption of molecular and atomic hydrogen (Schalwig
et al. 2002). Molecular adsorption produces molecular dipoles at the surface
of the Schottky barrier device, thereby altering the apparent metal work func-
tion. Conversely, the atomic hydrogen penetrates into the Pd bulk, leading
to an interfacial OH–dipole layer. However, hydrogen has a similar response
on Ga-face or N-face Schottky diodes, indicating that the diﬀerent polariza-
tion directions of the semiconductor material do not play a major role in gas
sensing.
Dependence on sensitivity to certain gases of diﬀerently etched GaN pos-
sessing diﬀerent morphologies has been reported (Popa et al. 2006). The main
diﬀerence in the sensitivities to methane gas and alcohol vapors exhibited by the
etched GaN lies in the morphology-induced diﬀerences in the dissociation of the
gas molecules as reducing gas molecules implies their dissociation at the surface
of grain boundaries in order to react chemically with the oxygen.
Applications of III-nitride semiconductors have been found in developing po-
tentiometric anion sensors (Chaniotakis et al. 2004), or in elaborating GaN-based
heterostructures for sensor applications monitoring adsorption of ions, wetting
by polar liquids, and exposure to gases (Stutzman et al. 2002). GaN crystal
grown on sapphire substrate is an excellent electroactive material for the de-
velopment of anion-sensitive potentiometric sensors. The Ga atoms of the outer
surface of the GaN (0001) crystal coordinate selectively and reversibly with an-
ions in solution. The anion coordination generates interfacial potential, related
to the activity of the anions (Chaniotakis et al. 2004).
Interaction of the wurtzite-type crystal of GaN (0001) with diﬀerent gases
such as hydrogen (H2), methane, carbon monoxide (CO), acetylene (C2H2), and
nitrous oxide (NO2) has been studied, though still very little is known of the
speciﬁc chemical interactions. A crystalline membrane of GaN was used as an
anion selective potentiometric sensor based on the interaction of the basic ions
with the acidic surface gallium atoms, while the lipophilicity of the anions has
proven to be of minor importance (Alifragis et al. 2005). It was suggested that
the double layer (inner and outer Helmholtz planes) produced by the speciﬁcally
adsorbed charged species is responsible for the observed interfacial potential
diﬀerence, measured under the potentiometric mode.
AlGaN/GaN ungated high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) exhibit ex-
treme sensitivity towards polar liquids: the drain-source current dramatically
changes due to bonding of polar liquid molecules in the gate region, altering the
polarization-induced positive surface charge. Sensing with AlGaN/GaN hetero-
structures is based generally on the modulation of the carrier density in a surface
near two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) which is spontaneously created at
the interface of these devices. The ion-sensitive ﬁeld eﬀect transistor (ISFET)
is another design of III-nitride-based sensors used for the detection of negative
or positive ions via the strong modulation of the source-drain current. GaN or
AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates can easily provide
metal oxide gate layers in transistor structures, at the same time beneﬁting from

the high chemical stability of the III-nitrides. Hence, GaN-based ISFETs allow
simultaneous electronic and microscopic detection of processes on the device sur-
face, due to the optical transparency of both the thin semiconducting ﬁlm and
the sapphire substrate. These devices reveal a high pH sensitivity, providing the
possibility of measuring H-concentration in the electrolyte.
Sensing with an ultrathin (10-nm) InN-based ISFET has been investigated
(Lu et al. 2008). In such devices (Fig. 14.3a) the current channel, composed of
the accumulated surface electrons located just below the gate surface, is highly
sensitive to the variation of adsorbed gate charges. The variation of adsorbed
ion concentration in the gate region is immediately transduced into the device
current output.
Figure 14.3b depicts the dynamic response of the InN ISFET for potassium
chloride (KCl) solution with a concentration ranging from 10−5 M to 10−1 M
when the voltage between the drain and the source VDS was ﬁxed at 0.5 V. Ion
detection is indicated as an abrupt current change in the InN ISFET when
exposed to diﬀerent ion concentrations. The current became smaller as the
chlorine ion concentration was increased. The estimated response time of one
decadechlorine ion concentration change is less than 10 s.
The main advantages of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructures include their chem-
ical stability and the presence of a polarization-induced two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG), which responds to any change of charge on the free unpassivated
gate surface (Eickhoﬀet al. 2003), while realizing a low noise level (Steinhoﬀ

is used as the sensing-gate material in direct contact with the sensing envir-
onment. Adsorption of anions to InN surface builds up a gate potential with
respect to the reference electrode, resulting in a reduced current output. (b)

Nitride devices and their biofunctionalization
et al. 2005). Moreover, AlGaN/GaN sensors on sapphire are transparent for
visible light, which allows for the implementation of additional optical tech-
niques such as spectrophotometric detection or simple microscopic observation
of attached cells.
Recently, online monitoring of living nerve cells with an AlGaN/GaN elec-
trolyte gate ﬁeld eﬀect transistor (EGFET) has been reported (Gebinoga
et al. 2012). The nerve cells attached to the transistor structure were provoked by
an inhibitor, creating prolonged ion ﬂux through the protein channels. This ionic
current ﬂows along the thin ﬁlm of electrolytes and generates an extracellular
potential change between cell and chip that modulates the 2DEG density and
thus the induced current. By measuring this current versus time and comparing
it to the sensor response of a pure medium with the same inhibitor, information
about the ion channel activity of the cells at the interface between transistor and
cells was obtained.
A GaN-based biosensor for the detection of penicillin has been reported (Baur
et al. 2006). The penicillinase enzyme was covalently grafted on an AlGaN/GaN
heterostructure, leading to an enzyme-modiﬁed ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (EnFET).
When the enzyme catalyses the transformation of penicillin to penicilloic acid,
protons are released. The resultant modiﬁcation in the pH value was sensed
by the two-dimensional electron gas at the AlGaN/GaN interface, and was
quantiﬁed as shifts in the surface potential.
Using zinc-oxide nanorods integrated into an Al-GaN/GaN HEMT nanomols
of glucose has been detected successfully (Kang et al. 2007) for diagnosis of
diabetes. Diagnosis of breast cancer has been also performed via functionalization
of the HEMT sensor with antibodies against a breast-cancer biomarker in human
saliva (Chen et al. 2008)
Diagnosing bacterial infections or genetic diseases requires biosensing of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) via oligomer hybridization to form duplex DNA
using one immobilized strand on a surface. Most of the methods used to de-
tect DNA hybridization through measuring changes in mass, optical properties,
or electrochemical characteristics require prelabeling of the DNA target with
special isotopes or ﬂuorophores. Electronic measurements using semiconductor-
based ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors to detect base pairs in DNAs rapidly and with high
accuracy are very promising sensing methods (Han et al. 2005, Xuan et al. 2005).
Gold (Au)-gated AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures were functionalized in the
gate region to bind oligomers for sensing via hybridization of matched target
DNA (Kang et al. 2006). The HEMT drain-source current showed a clear decrease
of 115 μA when the probe matched the target DNA on the surface of the device
(Fig. 14.4). Importantly, the repeated use of the nitride HEMT sensor was also
demonstrated, after rinsing the device with hot water, indicating the highly
reproducible sensing surface.
GaN and InN wurtzite nanocolumns processed by molecular beam epitaxy can
be used both as enzyme immobilization matrices and as highly sensitive trans-
ducers (Soﬁkiti et al. 2009). Due to their stabilizing nano-environment within

which urease retains its catalytic activity over a prolonged period, these elec-
trochemically active nanocolumns were successfully used as potentiometric urea
biosensors (Fig. 14.5a). The urease enzyme was physically adsorbed on both
nanocolumnar and ﬂat GaN and InN surfaces. The enzymatic reaction of urease
alters the pH of the media onto the semiconductor surface, rendering possible
the potentiometric detection of urea. The calibration curve to urea, presented
in Fig. 14.5b for both planar and nanocolumnar GaN and InN-based structures,
indicates that the biosensors based on GaN and InN nanocolumns exhibit a
much higher sensitivity to urea, compared to that of the corresponding planar
substrates. Since both planar and nanocolumnar sensors exhibit similar pH sens-
itivity, this result is attributed to the fact that nanostructures can adsorb higher
amounts of enzyme, due to increased surface-to-volume ratios. Moreover, when
evaluated over time, the authors found that an enzyme can be stabilized against
denaturation if encapsulated within nanocavities, which have an average dia-
meter two to six times larger than that of the biomolecule. In the case of these InN
and GaN nanostructures, the space between the nanocolumns is approximately
80 nm, whereas the average diameter of urease is around 13 nm.
Finally, very promising biomedical applications appeared recently with com-
plex lab-on-chip devices as next-generation implantable biosensors. Other than
the transducer, there is a need for new light-sources with advanced characterist-
ics. Recently, a ﬂexible GaN light-emitting diode (LED) fabricated on a liquid-
crystal polymer substrate has been successfully elaborated (Lee et al. 2012).
These GaN LEDs are mechanically and optically stable, and integrated on
ﬂexible substrates might constitute future light-sources. The measurement mod-
ule constituted of the ﬂexible GaN LED for excitation, an electroluminescence
detector, and a reaction chip successfully detected prostate-speciﬁc antigens.

Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds:
perspectives for a new class of
wide-band-gap nitrides
Walter R. L. Lambrecht and Atchara Punya
15.1
Introduction
The predominant method for adjusting materials properties in materials science,
and, in particular, semiconductor band structures, is isovalent alloying. For ex-
ample, by mixing the various group-III cations (Al, Ga, In) one can more or less
interpolate between the properties of the binary group-III nitride compounds. Of
course, these interpolations need not be linear. For example, the band-gap vari-
ation is usually described by means of a bowing coeﬃcient, b. For an A1−xBxC
alloy, the band gap is written as
Eg(x) = Eg(A)(1 −x) + Eg(B)x −bx(1 −x)
(15.1)
and a positive b indicates the usual downward bowing. Finer control of the band
structure can be obtained by nanostructuring, in the form of heterojunctions,
superlattices, quantum wires, and quantum dots, and this approach is usually
combined with alloying, so as to avoid building up too much lattice strain. On
the other hand, it is important to remember that all these structures are es-
sentially thermodynamically metastable. They can be grown only by means of
non-equilibrium growth techniques. Also, the alloys are for the most part dis-
ordered systems in which the two types of cation are distributed randomly, or
at least in a disordered way, on the cation sublattice. Although ordering can be
observed in homovalent semiconductor alloys, they do not form truly stable com-
pounds, and such ordering is now understood to result from a quasi-equilibrium
of the surface layers during growth (1).
There is, however, another paradigm for adjusting electronic structure of tet-
rahedrally bonded semiconductors: one can replace two of the four group-III
cations surrounding each anion by a group II element, and two by a group-IV
element. For example, GaN becomes ZnGeN2. We call this concept: heterovalent
ternaries. This possibility is well known for other group-V compounds, which
have the zincblende structure. It leads to the family of chalcopyrite structure
compounds (2), such as ZnGeP2, CdGeAs2, etc. These materials have received
signiﬁcant attention because of their favorable non-linear optical properties
(3, 4). We have studied some of their band structures in (5–8). In particular,

Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
the symmetry lowering from the cubic to tetragonal structure leads to birefrin-
gence, which allows one to do phase-matching and hence make eﬃcient frequency
doubling and tunable frequency sum or diﬀerence generating materials (9). The
same concept can also be applied to II-VI materials by replacing the group-II
with a group-I and group-III element. For example, ZnSe becomes CuInSe2. The
importance of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (better known as CIGS) as a thin-ﬁlm solar cell
material is widely appreciated.
It is much less well known that this same concept can also be applied to
the more ionic semiconductors that exhibit the wurtzite structure. As in the
zincblende-to-chalcopyrite case, a well-deﬁned crystal structure forms with a
lower symmetry; in this case, orthorhombic. This crystal structure, of which
β-NaFeO2 is the prototype, applies to a whole new class of II-IV-N2 compounds,
which form the subject of this chapter. The same concept can also be applied to
ZnO, and in that case leads to, e.g., LiGaO2. That material is in fact familiar
to the nitride community because it has been proposed as a suitable substrate
for GaN growth in view of its close lattice match. It is, however, a material of
considerable intrinsic interest in its own right. We refer the interested reader to
some of our recent work on this material, because it falls outside the scope of
this review on nitrides (10–13).
An important diﬀerence with isovalent alloying is that heterovalent substitu-
tion leads to new thermodynamically stable ordered compounds. It is not a priori
evident why this is so. One can in principle construct diﬀerent and even dis-
ordered structures which locally obey the octet rule of pairing two group-II with
two group-IV elements around each anion. Thus, order–disorder transitions are
a possibility. In fact, in chalcopyrite semiconductors, such order–disorder trans-
itions have been observed. Nonetheless, we expect that deviations from the local
octet rule, requiring each anion to be surrounded by exactly two cations of group-
II and two cations of group-IV, will locally destroy charge neutrality and are thus
expected to be energetically unfavorable. This issue was studied for LiGaO2 in
(13) by comparing structures with only Li2Ga2 tetrahedrons surrounding oxy-
gen to a structure with a combination of LiGa3 and Li3Ga tetrahedra. The latter
were found to be about 1 eV less stable per formula unit. This is a more severe
restriction for more ionic materials. It is well known that in GaN, antisite de-
fects are less common than in GaAs. This could severely limit the possibilities
for disordering the lattice, since atom-switches need to occur in pairs, preserving
the local octet rule. Thus II-IV-N2 compounds may be expected to have an ener-
getic incentive to be well-ordered. Even in ZnGeP2 the predominant defects are
not cation antisites, as one might have expected on the basis of order–disorder
considerations, but rather Zn-vacancies, related to the high vapor pressure of Zn
(14–16). In reality, of course, this remains one of the important questions to be
studied for the nitrides.
From a band structure and defect engineering point of view, one may anti-
cipate that heterovalent compounds provide a new degree of ﬂexibility. One has
two diﬀerent cation sublattices with diﬀerent valence to play with. Thus, slight

deviations from stoichiometry might already intrinsically dope the materials.
This could be viewed as a challenge, but also as an opportunity. It also means
that one has two diﬀerent valence cations which can be replaced by diﬀerent
types of dopant to achieve n- or p-type doping. For example, one might envision
doping ZnGeN2 p-type by placing group-I elements, such as Na, Cu, on the Zn
site, or group-III elements on the Ge site. Again, this presents an opportunity
but also the challenge of how to control the site selectivity of the dopants.
At ﬁrst, it may appear that with this new form of band-gap engineering, the
octet rule limits us to exactly 50% compounds and is thus less ﬂexible than the
usual isovalent alloying. However, alloying elements of the same valence can still
be applied to these compounds. For example, one might envision ZnGe1−xSixN2
alloys with a continuously varying x. The fact that we have diﬀerent elements for
both the group-II and group-IV sites at our disposal means that we can in prin-
ciple obtain several new well-deﬁned compounds in the (band gap)–(lattice con-
stant) space. Because alloying away from the well-deﬁned compounds invariably
leads to strain, this means that we have new anchor points available around which
we can ﬁne-tune the properties of the band gap while minimizing the strain.
It may even be possible to grow mixed (III-N)(II-IV-N2) systems. This has
already been explored for the analogous ZnO-LiGaO2 systems, where continuous
alloys were grown (17, 18). This is an interesting concept, because a group-III
element would dope the II-IV-N2 n-type if it occurs on the group-II site, and
p-type if it occurs on the group-IV site. But if one is capable of adding the
group-III so that it occupies both elements equally, we may change from a per-
fectly compensated semiconductor to a new type of alloy. From a heterojunction
point of view, GaN and ZnGeN2 have very similar band gaps, as we will see
below, so one expects a type-II band oﬀset situation. This would mean that in
alternating ZnGeN2, GaN layers one would expect electrons and holes to localize
in the diﬀerent regions. This separation of charges is in principle of interest for
photovoltaics. At present we do not yet know which way the band-oﬀset would
go, but because of the presence of the Zn-3d bands in ZnGeN2 one expects the
VBM to be higher in ZnGeN2 than in GaN, so holes would localize in ZnGeN2
and electrons in GaN.
Another important consideration is that the new crystal structures have lower
symmetry. As we will show later, this leads to additional splittings of the valence
bands, giving rise to interesting anisotropies in optical properties. It also leads
to a much more complex phonon spectrum than in the wurtzite structure. These
additional anisotropic properties are of fundamental as well as practical interest.
At present, we are only at the start of exploring this vast new materials sys-
tem. We are where the group-III nitrides were in the early 1970s. The literature
on these materials can still be summarized in a few pages. In the remainder of
this chapter we ﬁrst give a brief review of the literature in Section 15.2. In par-
ticular, this describes some of the growth methods that have been used for these
materials. Next, we describe the crystal structure and symmetry in Section 15.3.
We follow this with some considerations on thermodynamic stability, which are

522
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
relevant to crystal growth, and more precisely the energies of formation as cal-
culated from ﬁrst principles in Section 15.4. Next, we discuss the electronic band
structure in Section 15.5. In particular, we focus on our own latest results us-
ing the quasiparticle self-consistent GW method. This method, which came of
age only recently, allows one to overcome the long-lasting shortcomings of the
band-gap underestimate for semiconductors occurring in the local density ap-
proximation, used in most of the early work on band structures of these materials.
After a brief discussion of the method, we present an overview at the large energy
scale of the band structures. We then focus on the band-gap region and describe
the eﬀective masses and eﬀective mass Hamiltonians, including the valence-band
splittings, which will be useful in future work for investigating nanostructures.
Next, we turn to lattice dynamics in Section 15.6. While one might think at ﬁrst
that these would be closely related to the well-known phonon spectra in wurtzite
by a simple Brillouin zone folding scheme, we will show that the diﬀerences in
II-N and IV-N bond force constants and the lower symmetry lead to much more
complex phonon spectra. Comparison with the few experiments available will be
discussed. Various tensorial properties related to lattice deformation are presen-
ted next in Section 15.7, including elastic constants and piezoelectric constants.
Spontaneous polarization and its relevance for heterojunctions is discussed in
Section 15.8. Optical properties in the visible and UV range, related to the band
structure, have not yet been investigated in detail, but we summarize what is
known today in Section 15.9. This also includes a discussion of the non-linear
optical properties. On defects, we have not many results to present yet. We
have only just started studying these. But we will present some preliminary
considerations on why interesting changes from the III-nitrides are expected, in
Section 15.10. We ﬁnish with an outlook toward future work in Section 15.11.
15.2
History and crystal growth
The ﬁrst reported synthesis of a II-IV-N2 compound appears to be of CaSiN2
(19–21). Several other compounds with the same crystal structure CaGeN2 (22),
MgSiN2 (23, 24), MgGeN2 (24, 25), BeSiN2 (26, 27), MnGeN2 (28, 29), MnSiN2
(29), and SrSiN2 (30), were synthesized by groups in France and Germany, in the
late 1960s and early 1970s, but for the most part the only properties investigated
were the crystal structure and the chemical stability. A general similarity in
properties to group-III nitrides was pointed out.
Most of the research published to date has been on the Zn-IV-N2 compounds.
The ﬁrst reported synthesis of ZnGeN2 in 1970 (31) used a reaction of NH3 with
Zn2GeO4, the latter being separately obtained from reacting GeO2 with ZnO:
3Zn2GeO4 + 8NH3 →3ZnGeN2 + N2 + 3Zn + 12H2O
(15.2)
as well as the direct reaction of Zn with Ge3N4:
2Zn + Ge3N4 →2ZnGeN2 + Ge
(15.3)

History and crystal growth

It discusses the diﬃculties of having to work in a narrow temperature-range
of 800–810◦C to avoid forming Ge3N4 (above 810◦C) and the inevitable traces
of unreacted Ge that remain and gradually become nitrided. Below 800◦C, an
oxynitride is found to form. Such oxynitrides may be of interest in their own
right, and were recently exlored for photocatalytic water splitting (32). The
initial reports on the crystal structure showed it to have a structure related to
that of wurtzite, but with a lower, monoclinic symmetry. Because of the similarity
in electron density of Zn and Ge and hence their X-ray and electron-scattering
factors, it was impossible using X-ray diﬀraction to determine whether the Zn and
Ge atoms were ordered or disordered on the cation lattice. A neutron-diﬀraction
study (33) determined the ordering of the Zn and Ge atoms, and thus established
the orthorhombic structure, discussed in Section 15.3.
The stability of ZnGeN2, Zn3N2 and Ge3N4 in partial mixtures of NH3 and
its dissociation products H2 and N2, was investigated by Zykov et al. (34). The
diﬃculty of growing these nitrides from ammonia is that at high temperature
ammonia dissociates and the resultant H2 can reduce the nitride, e.g.,
ZnGeN2 + 3H2 →ZnGealloy + 2NH3
(15.4)
They ﬁnd that ZnGeN2 is the more stable of the three nitrides and persists up
to high dissociation rates α of NH3 of up to 0.58 at 600◦C and 0.62 at 800◦C.
By contrast, Ge3N4 already dissociates at α = 0.39 −0.41 at temperatures of
720–840◦C, and Zn3N2 already starts to dissociate at α = 0.01 at 600◦C.
Larson et al. (35) were the ﬁrst to use a vapor-growth method for ZnGeN2
using cation chlorides. They started from elemental Zn and Ge which was ﬁrst
reacted with a HCl–N2 mixture at temperatures of 550◦C and 950◦C respect-
ively, and subsequently this gas mixture was mixed with NH3–N2. The reaction
is thus assumed to be
ZnCl2 + GeCl4 + 2NH3 →ZnGeN2 + 6HCl
(15.5)
They deposited the ﬁlms on c-plane and r-plane sapphire at 850◦C. They re-
ported wurtzite structure with a = 3.1993 ˚A and c = 5.187 ˚A and an absorption
onset at 2.67 eV, which is now known to be an underestimate resulting from
defects.
High-pressure synthesis of ZnGeN2 and ZnSiN2 starting from mixtures of
Zn3N2 and Si3N4 or Ge3N4 was reported by Endo et al. (36) in Japan in 1992.
High pressure had been used previously to grow MgSiN2 by Whitney and Giese
(23). Endo et al. (36) reported a band gap of 3.64 eV for ZnSiN2 based on the
optical absorption onset. They reported their ZnGeN2 crystals to be opaque and
black, indicating a high degree of contamination.
In 1999, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was used by Zhu
et al. (37) to synthesize thin ﬁlms of ZnGeN2. They used diethylzinc and germane
as starting gases and grew on either r-plane or c-plane sapphire with a GaN buﬀer
layer. N was supplied via NH3. The r-plane sapphire was found to lead to ﬁner
and more uniform grains. They concluded that their ZnGeN2 exhibited disorder

524
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
on the cation sublattice. The same group also reported ZnSiN2 growth and alloy
growth of ZnSi1−xGexN2 growth, and these materials were investigated by a
number of other collaborators determining optical properties (38, 39), transistor
devices on SiC (40), and even their suitability as magnetic semiconductor host
by implantation of Mn (41). Muth et al. (38) determined band gaps from optical
absorption data as a function of alloy composition in ZnSi1−xGexN2, and found
it to vary between 3.1 and 3.2 eV for ZnGeN2 to 4.4 eV in ZnSiN2. Cook et al.
(39) determined the indices of refraction, and Mintairov et al. (42) determined
the infrared reﬂection relating to the vibrational spectrum.
A few other groups, both in Japan and in France, have used chemical-vapor
deposition-type methods. Misaki et al. (43–45) used remote plasma-enhanced
MOCVD for thin ﬁlm growth of ZnGeN2 directly on sapphire without GaN buﬀer
layer, and reported a band gap of 3.3 eV at room temperature. They determined
the temperature-dependence of the band-gap luminescence and ﬁtted it to the
Varshni equation
Eg(T) = Eg(0) −αT 2
β + T
(15.6)
with Eg(0) = 3.36 eV, α = 4.54 × 10−3 eV/K, and β = 4850 K. They also repor-
ted optical reﬂectivity in the UV up to 20 eV. Most of this work used r-plane
sapphire as the substrate. Cloitre et al. reported ZnSiN2 growth by MOVPE on
c-plane sapphire (46). Kikkawa and Morisaka (47) reported RF-sputter depos-
ition of ZnGeN2 thin ﬁlms on Si and glass substrates, and estimated the gap to
be about 3.1 eV. Viennois et al. (48) performed the ﬁrst Raman-spectroscopy
study on powder samples of ZnGeN2, synthesized by a similar approach as used
by Maunaye and Lang.
Recently a vapor–liquid–solid synthesis method was used by Du et al. (49)
using pure Zn and Ge, and NH3, at growth temperatures between 750◦C and
900◦C. Photoluminescence on these materials indicate a gap of 3.40±0.01 eV and
a high ratio of band-gap versus defect luminescence. This growth technique uses
the reaction of NH3 with a Zn-saturated Ge liquid as well as an extra source
of Zn-vapor. It leads to polycrystalline material but also fairly large micron
needle-shaped crystals of several microns in diameter and of order 100 microns
in length.
ZnSnN2 has very recently been synthesized for the ﬁrst time (50). The au-
thors used a remote microwave N2 plasma as source of the nitrogen in order to
keep the temperature low enough to prevent dissociation. Depending on growth
conditions, either Sn3N4, Zn3N2 or ZnSnN2 can form. Polycrystalline samples
of ZnSnN2 were obtained and analyzed with powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD),
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence
(PL), and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy.
The ﬁrst band-structure calculations of ZnGeN2 were presented in 1999 by
Limpijumnong et al. (52) using the local density approximation and linear-
ized muﬃn-tin orbital method. They also investigated the linear and non-linear

Crystal structure and symmetry
525
optical properties such as the index of refraction and second harmonic generation
coeﬃcient. Other groups also presented band-structure calculations with pseudo-
potential plane-wave approaches (53, 54), and included some other members of
this family of II-IV-N2 compounds.
Recently, Lambrecht et al. (55–59) presented a series of papers focusing
mainly on the lattice dynamics of ZnSiN2, ZnGeN2, and ZnSnN2. As part of
this work, the electronic band structures were also calculated using a pseudopo-
tential plane-wave approach (60). All these previous works on the band structure,
however, suﬀer from the limitations of the local density approximation. The band
structure of Zn-IV-N2 compounds with IV = Si, Ge, Sn were recently calculated
using a much more accurate GW approach (61, 62), which will be described in
Section 15.5.1. Most recently, the method was also used to calculate CdGeN2
and ZnGe1−xSnxN2 alloys (63).
One might also wonder about the possibility of carbonitrides. Lambrecht and
Segall (64) proposed BeCN2 to be a direct wide-band-gap semiconductor in the
chalcopyrite structure. Because the parent compound c-BN has the zincblende
structure, this makes sense, but the alternative wurtzite-based structure was not
considered. Petukhov et al. (65) subsequently considered BeCN2 and MgCN2 as
well as the corresponding siliconitrides in the chalcopyrite structure, and pre-
dicted both carbonitrides to be direct-gap semiconductors. These materials have
not been synthesized as far as we can tell. An important problem is that carbon
and nitrogen can form a CN2−
2
cyanamide ion, which is a linear molecular ion.
Cyanamides of group II elements such as Mg, Sr, and Ca are indeed known,
but form layered structures (66). In other words, for synthesizing tetrahedrally
bonded carbonitrides one would have to overcome the problem that C and N
prefer to use π bonding in a linear molecule, which then leads to totally diﬀerent
crystal structures. This problem is in that sense similar to the problem of the
relative stability of graphite versus diamond in carbon.
15.3
Crystal structure and symmetry
15.3.1
Symmetry
The prototype for the crystal structure of the II-IV-N2 compounds is β-NaFeO2,
which is actually a I-III-VI2 compound. This crystal structure can be viewed as
a 2 ×
√
3 superlattice of wurtzite along ortho-hexagonal axes, as illustrated in
Fig. 15.1, showing a projection on the c-plane.
It has sixteen atoms per unit cell. The b/a and c/a can both adjust as well
as the internal positions x, y, z of each of the four types of atom, the group II,
group IV, and two inequivalent N positions, NII being on top of the group II and
NIV being on top of the group IV element. We choose the a axis to be 2aw and
b ≈
√
3aw unlike the commonly found choice in the crystallography literature,
which interchanges a and b from ours.
The space group is Pbn21 (space group No. 33, or C9
2v), meaning that there
is a two-fold screw axis along the z direction with translation 1
2c, a diagonal

metry elements are indicated and chosen so that the 21 axes passes through

glide plane n perpendicular to b with translations 1
2(a + c), and an axial glide
plane perpendicular to the a-axis with translation 1
2b. These symmetry elements
are indicated in Fig. 5.1. We note that the space-group denomination in the
International Tables of Crystallography (ITC) is Pna21. Our choice has the a
and b axes interchanged. Most of the experimental papers in the literature adopt
the ITC choice of axes, but we prefer the interchange of a and b axes because it
makes the relation to wurtzite easier to see. This means that in our case, a = 2aw
is the longest lattice constant, b ≈
√
3aw is the next longest, and c = cw, where
the subscript indicates the wurtzite structure. In this setting the origin is chosen
to fall on the two-fold screw axis. This simpliﬁes the non-primitive translation
vector of the screw axis to be just c/2.
The point group is C2v. The character table for this group is given in
Table 15.1. The meaning of this table is easy to understand in this case, even to
readers not familiar with group theory. The characters of the irreducible repres-
entations (irrep for short) listed as rows, simply describe whether the functions
corresponding to this irrep are odd or even under the corresponding symmetry
operations in the column headings. The irreducible representations a1, b1, and
b2 correspond to basis functions transforming like z, x, and y, with x along a, y
along b, and z along the c-axes. The a2 irreducible representation is even under
the two-fold rotation, but odd under both mirror-planes, and corresponds to an
xy basis function. These character tables are useful for classifying the vibrational
modes at Γ as well as the electronic states.

Lattice constants
The lattice parameters and atomic positions for the II-IV-N2 materials stud-
ied in our group were optimized using ﬁrst-principles calculations. The details
of the method are given in Section 15.5.1. The results, given in Table 15.2,
show excellent agreement with experimental data where available. There is still
signiﬁcant uncertainty on the experimental lattice constants. For ZnGeN2 a dis-
cussion of the lattice constants found in literature is given in Du et al. (49). For
the last two materials, ZnSnN2 and CdGeN2, our calculations were predictions,
when we ﬁrst performed them, though ZnSnN2 has recently been grown for the
ﬁrst time (50). The internal positions are given in Table 15.3. All atoms oc-

Table 15.4.
In the process of minimizing the energy per cell as a function of cell volume,
we also determined the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative by ﬁtting an
energy-versus-volume curve to the Vinet equation of state (51), given by

For each volume the energy is ﬁrst minimized as a function of internal coordin-
ates, but we kept the ratios of the b/a and c/a ﬁxed to those determined by
minimization for the starting volume. The bulk moduli are given in Table 15.5.
15.4
Thermodynamic stability
An important question for crystal growth is the thermodynamic stability. While
the full ternary phase diagram as a function of composition and temperature for
these ternaries is still not well known, we present some results we have obtained
on the energies of formation at zero temperature.
The energies of formation are deﬁned with respect to the elements in their
equilibrium phase at room temperature and ambient pressure, but here are

we also show results for GaN where we can compare with experimental data (74).
The cohesive energies of the elements involved in this calculation help to ascertain
the accuracy of this calculation. We can see that LDA typically overestimates the
cohesive energy by about 30% for all the solids and about 10% for the molecule.
This is because primarily the LDA error occurs for the free atom and molecule.
There is a large degree of compensation of errors when subtracting the energies.
We ﬁnd that all four compounds have exothermic energies of formation, including
ZnSnN2 and CdGeN2.
Table 15.6 does not include zero-point motion corrections, which we now
estimate. The latter were calculated from the phonons for all three Zn-IV-N2
compounds in our previous work (58), and can be estimated as 9/8kBΘD from
the Debye temperature for the other solids. The Debye temperatures were
taken from an interactive periodic table, online at http://www.infoplease.com/
periodictable.php.
For the N2 molecule we use, simply, hν/2 = hc/2λ with 1/λ = 2360 cm−1,
the vibrational frequency of the N2 molecule, obtained by Wathelet et al. (77)
in the LDA and the harmonic approximation. The important point here is
that the zero-point motion contribution of the gas molecule is signiﬁcantly
larger than that of the solids. The zero-point motion corrections on the co-
hesive energy and molecular binding energy are given in Table 15.7. We can
see, however, that the zero-point motion correction to the energies of forma-
tion amount to only −0.13, −0.12, and −0.12 eV for Zn-IV-N2 with IV = Si,
Ge, and Sn respectively, and they help to make the energies of formation more
negative.
We caution that the energies of formation here are not suﬃcient to estab-
lish the thermodynamic stability of these compounds. It is necessary to also
investigate the energies of formation of competing compounds such as Zn3N2,
Si3N4, Ge3N4, Sn3N4, and other possible IV-Nx compounds. Using these, we can
construct maps of the available chemical potential region where the diﬀerent com-
pounds would be stable. These types of maps are usually used to determine the
allowed ranges of the chemical potentials in the context of impurity calculations.

We explain the procedure for ZnSnN2, for which the chemical stability is of the
largest concern, since until recently, no reports have been found of synthesis of
this material.
For ZnSnN2 the chemical potentials of the elements involved must obey
μSn + μZn + 2μN = Ef(ZnSnN2).
(15.9)
Here the chemical potentials are excess chemical potentials. This means they are
in principle Gibbs free energies relative to their value in the reference states,
bulk Sn, bulk Zn, and a N2 gas. We ignore here the pressure and temperature-
dependence of the N2 gas and focus only on the energy of a N atom in a N2
molecule. In other words, it is half the binding energy of a N2 molecule. The
energy of formation Ef(ZnSnN2) is the cohesive energy of ZnSnN2 minus the
cohesive energies of Zn and Sn per atom (in their solid form) and the binding
energy of the N2 molecule. Thus, when two of the chemical potentials are chosen,
the third is deﬁned by eq. (15.9). We choose μSn and μZn as the basic variables
in Fig. 15.2. The diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right in Fig. 15.2
corresponds to eq. 15.9 when μN = 0. The chemical potential of N, μN, must lie
above this line, otherwise the system becomes unstable to evolution of nitrogen
gas. On the other hand, the chemical potentials of Sn and Zn must both be
negative. If they became positive it would be favorable to precipitate bulk Sn
and bulk Zn. However, more severe restrictions apply if other compounds can
form between Sn and N or Zn and N. Zn is known to form a compound Zn3N2,
while for Sn and N one might expect Sn3N4, but reports of other stoichiometries

SnNx with 0.9 < x < 3.3 exist in literature (78). Most interesting is the report
(79) that Sn3N4 has its lowest energy in a spinel structure, which for Si3N4 only
exists as a high-pressure phase. Using, this stoichiometry, we require
3μZn + 2μN ≤Ef(Zn3N2)
3μSn + 4μN ≤Ef(Sn3N4)
(15.10)
These deﬁne two more lines and the region where ZnSnN2 has a chance to
be stable. We have calculated the energy of formation of Zn3N2 in LDA to
be −0.72 eV per formula unit, and that of Sn3N4 in the spinel structure
to be −0.95 eV, using experimental structural data. These may have to be ad-
justed further by relaxation, and may thus be slight overestimates. With the
present estimates it appears that there is a wide range of stability of the chem-
ical potentials where ZnSnN2 would be stable. We can see that if μZn becomes
close to zero (Zn-rich) and μSn is below a certain value (Sn-poor) and above
the μN = 0 line, (nitrogen-rich) Zn3N2 would prefer to form. Similarly, if we are
Sn-rich and Zn-poor, Sn3N4 might form in N-rich conditions. If the borderline
between ZnSnN2 and Sn3N4 would shift down and to the right, conceivably it
could move past the Zn3N2–ZnSnN2 borderline. If this occurred it would mean
that ZnSnN2 would have no stability region at all. However, we see that this
would require a much more negative energy of formation for Sn3N4. Similarly, if
the Zn3N2 line were to move up and to the right, the range of allowable chem-
ical potentials required for the stability of ZnSnN2 could be reduced. Similar
conclusions hold for ZnGeN2 and ZnSiN2.

Electronic structure
As already mentioned in the historical overview of the literature in Section 15.2,
there have been various electronic structure calculations since the pioneering
work in 1999 by Limpijumnong et al. (52). The emphasis of most electronic
structure calculations in the early works was to take them as a starting point to
discuss the total energy properties of binding, structural optimization, etc. Most
of this work used either the LDA or GGA. The main drawback of these methods,
however, is that they severely underestimate the band gaps. While one may at-
tempt to correct these by making the assumption that the corrections should be
similar in similar materials and therefore could be derived from the known exper-
imental band gap and LDA calculated band gaps in the parent III-N compounds
(58), the predictive capability of such an approach is limited. The uncertainty
on the band gaps is exacerbated by the fact that most early attempts at grow-
ing a new material resulted in rather defective samples. Absorption can then
be strongly aﬀected by point defects, leading to subband-gap absorption tails.
Thereby, the band gaps are usually underestimated. For example, the earliest
band-gap determinations for ZnGeN2 by absorption suggested a gap of 2.67 eV,
while later measurements based on photoluminescence (49) gave a gap of 3.40 eV.

534
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
The good news is that due to the development of the quasiparticle self-
consistent GW method, we can now make reliable predictions of the band gaps.
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the computational method, both standard DFT
in the LDA which are used to determine the structural parameters and the GW
method. Next we describe the electronic band-structure and use partial densit-
ies of states to determine the atomic orbital character of the bands in diﬀerent
energy ranges. We then zoom in to the band-gap region, describe various correc-
tions required to determined the band gaps accurately, and then zoom in further
to determine the valence-band maximum ﬁne structure by means of eﬀective
mass Hamiltonians.
15.5.1
Computational methods
The basic framework of ﬁrst-principles electronic structure theory is density func-
tional theory (DFT) (67, 68). These methods provide a “mean-ﬁeld” prescription
for determining the eﬀective potential felt by an electron due to all the other elec-
trons and the nuclei in the solid. Based on the Hohenberg and Kohn theorems
(67), these potentials should be completely determined by the electron density.
In other words, they are not orbital-dependent. Unfortunately, the exact func-
tional form for the energy and potential as a function of density are not known,
and one has to approximate them. The most common approximations are the
local density approximation (LDA) (68, 69) and the generalized gradient ap-
proximation (GGA)(71). In these methods one assumes that the exchange and
correlation energy per particle at any point in space depends only on the density
at that point in space (or also on its gradient in GGA), and, furthermore, that
these dependencies are the same as in a free electron gas of the same density.
Thereby, the results from many-body theory on the exchange and correlation en-
ergy in the electron gas, i.e. a system with constant density, can be transferred
straight forwardly to the case of varying density. This methodology, however, is
focused on calculating the total energy properties, and is in principle valid only
for the ground state of the system. It is used to optimize the lattice constants
and atomic positions inside the unit cell, and also used to calculate the force con-
stants, from which one derives the vibrational modes. More details are presented
in Section 15.6.1.
The method, however, does not apply strictly to excited-state properties such
as the optical properties, or even to calculating the so-called quasiparticle excit-
ations, i.e. the energy to extract an electron from the occupied bands, or add one
into the empty bands. For the latter, the GW method provides a better approach.
In any case, to solve the DFT Kohn–Sham equations self-consistently, one
has a choice between various band-structure methods. The latter diﬀer mostly in
how they make, or do not make, further approximations to the potential, and in
what basis set they are utilized. For the phonon calculations in the later section,
we utilize a pseudopotential approach and plane-wave basis set, because these
methods facilitate calculation of the derivatives of the total energy. The most

accurate methods, however, are free from the ambiguities of how to separate the
electrons in valence and core states. They are the so-called all-electron methods.
Even in these methods the core-electrons are calculated somewhat diﬀerently
from the valence electrons. They are calculated as for free atoms, assuming the
wavefunctions go to zero at the sphere boundary of spherical regions around
each atom. However, their charge density is incorporated fully in the total charge
density, and so is the potential they give rise to. In pseudopotential methods, on
the other hand, one replaces the problem of the valence electrons by a problem
of pseudowavefunctions, which lack the fast oscillations of the wavefunctions
near the core required by orthogonality to the core states, but are nonetheless
expected to produce the same eigenvalues. They hence rely on transferability of
the pseudopotential, representing the smoothed-out interaction with the core-
electrons from one chemical environment to another, say from the free atom to
that in a solid.
The all-electron calculations are usually performed in the so-called linearized
method, in which the basis set is shown to be accurate over a given energy range.
Such methods include the linearized augmented plane-wave (LAPW) method, as
well as the linearized muﬃn-tin orbital (LMTO) methods. While early versions
of these methods used to make additional “shape” approximations, i.e. spher-
ical potentials, were assumed within spheres, and a constant potential in the
region between spheres, this is no longer required, and methods without shape
approximation are labeled as being full-potential. We use here the full-potential
linearized muﬃn-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method as described in (72, 73). This
method uses basis functions obtained from smoothed Hankel function envelope
functions augmented inside muﬃn-tin spheres. The Hankel functions describe the
overall decay of the functions centered on atomic sites for each type of spher-
ical harmonic. The augmentation means that these functions outside the spheres
are matched continuously and with continuous derivative to radial functions in-
side the spheres which are exact solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation of the
self-consistent potential in that sphere at some given energy, and its energy de-
rivative. Sometimes, additional freedom to the basis set is added by including
further “local orbitals” deﬁned only inside the sphere, or “ﬂoating orbitals”,
which are orbital only outside the sphere. The former are used to describe, for
example, semi-core states which are not exactly zero yet at the sphere boundary.
The latter are mainly useful to better describe highly-lying conduction band-
states and improve the basis set for the GW calculations in an eﬃcient manner.
The convergence of the basis set can be tested by adding augmented plane-waves.
The method, in fact, is now a hybrid of LAPW and LMTO. We emphasize once
more that although muﬃn-tin potentials are used in the construction of the basis
set, no shape approximations are made to the potential or charge density.
We use a 4 × 4 × 4 k-point sampling for the Brillouin zone integration in
the self-consistent LDA or GGA calculations. The basis set contains two sets of
smoothed Hankel function decay parameters κ, and smoothing radii, Rsm, and
includes spd functions in the ﬁrst and the second set for Zn and includes spd

functions in the ﬁrst and sp in the second set for Si, Ge, Sn, and N. In addition, we
add Zn-4d as local orbitals. Finally, we point out that scalar relativistic eﬀects
are included by solving the scalar Dirac equation instead of the Schr¨odinger
equation. The eﬀects of spin–orbit coupling can also be included.
The quasiparticle band structure is calculated using the quasiparticle self-
consistent GW approach implemented in the same FP-LMTO method, as
described in (80–82). Hedin’s GW approximation (83, 84) is the ﬁrst term in
a series expansion of the self-energy, in terms of the screened Coulomb in-
teraction. Schematically, Σ(12) = iG(12)W(1+2), with G(12) the one-electron
Green’s function and W(1+2) the screened Coulomb interaction—written in
position, spin, time coordinates 1 = {r1, σ1, t1}, with 1+ = t1 + δ. Applying a
Fourier transform to the frequency (or energy) domain, the following equations
are used to calculate these quantities:
Π(r, r′, ω) = −iG0(r, r′, ω) ⊗G0(r′, r, −ω)

Here, ⊗denotes convolution over frequencies, W
is calculated as W =

(RPA) and GW is usually applied as a single-shot correction to LDA within
ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. In other words, the Green’s functions G = G0 =

tential can then be used as a new starting point for a new H0, and iterated to
convergence. This approach (called QSGW) is designed so that the eigenvalues

in the GWA. Here we use atomic units: vN is the interaction with the nuclei,
and vH is the Hartree potential.
An important distinguishing feature of the present GW and QSGW im-
plementation is that it is an all-electron implementation, not relying on
pseudopotentials and thereby properly including core-valence exchange. It is im-
plemented in the full-potential LMTO method. A mixed plane-wave and product
basis set (85) is used to express all two-particle operators. For details, we refer
the reader to the above-mentioned papers by the van Schilfgaarde group.
Let us here just remark that this method provides very accurate results for a
wide range of solids, including all standard III-V and II-VI semiconductors (80).
Most importantly, the method has highly systematic small remaining errors: it
gives a slight overestimate of the gaps compared to experiment. This remaining
discrepancy is thought to arise from the under-screening by the RPA. It can
be corrected by scaling the ﬁnal ΔVxc = V QSGW

by about 80%, as ob-
tained empirically by comparing QSGW with experiment for a wide variety of
semiconductors (80). We refer to this as the 0.8Σ approximation. Within this
approximation, most band gaps are obtained to better than 0.1 eV. The ΔVxc
represented in a muﬃn-tin orbital basis set can be Fourier-transformed to real
space, and then Bloch summed for arbitrary k-points on a ﬁner mesh than the
one on which the time-consuming GW calculation is carried out. This allows us
to obtain accurate eﬀective masses and band plots along symmetry lines.
As explained in (82), the ΔV xc
˜n ˜m(k) in the basis set of the LDA Hamiltonian
eigenstates (as indicated by the ˜ over the indices) can be approximated to be
linear in the LDA eigenvalue: aϵLDA
˜nk
+ b for energy bands above some cut-oﬀ
energy Ecut. We ﬁnd it important to take this cut-oﬀsuﬃciently high for the
nitrides, say Ecut = 3 Ryd above the Fermi level, to obtain well-converged results.
The gaps for Ecut = 2.5 Ryd were still underestimated by 5–10 %. As a k-point
sampling set for the GW self-energy we use a 2 × 2 × 2 mesh corresponding to the
sixteen-atom unit cell. This is more or less equivalent to an 8 × 8 × 4 sampling
for wurtzite.

Band-structure overview
The electronic band structures of Zn-IV-N2, for IV = Si, Ge, Sn calculated using
the QSGW method, were reported in (62). The band structure of CdGeN2 was
presented at the ICSCRM2011 meeting, and is reported in (63). As an example,
the band structure and density of states of ZnGeN2 are shown in Fig. 15.3.
Since there are sixteen atoms in the unit cell, eight nitrogens, four Zn, and
four Ge, there are 104 valence electrons per unit cell or 52 occupied bands. We

can see that the eight bands near −15 eV are predominantly N-2s-like bonding
with Zn and Ge. The twenty-four bands between −5 and 0 eV are the N-2p-like
bands, and the conduction bands have mixed Ge and Zn-s character. The twenty
Zn-3d bands are found near the bottom of the N-2p band in a narrow range. A
similar ordering of states occurs in the other II-IV-N2 nitrides. For further details
on the partial densities of states, showing also those with smaller contributions,
we refer the reader to (62). A similar general ordering of the bands is applicable
to the other II-IV-N2 compounds.
The eﬀects of GW compared to LDA can be seen in Fig. 15.4 for ZnSiN2.
The gap is increased by 2.1 eV, with 1.6 eV of the shift occurring in the con-
duction band and −0.5 eV in the valence band. In ZnGeN2, the gap change is
1.8 eV, with 1.7 eV in the conduction band and only −0.1 eV in the valence
band. In ZnSnN2, both the valence and conduction bands shift up relative
to the average electrostatic potential (by 0.2 eV and 1.8 eV respectively),
and the net gap shift is 1.6 eV. In CdGeN2, the gap shift is also primar-
ily in the conduction band and amounts to 1.55 eV. The absolute shifts of
the band structure relative to the average electrostatic potential are import-
ant for band oﬀsets at interfaces and also play a role in defects and impurities.
A discussion of this issue can be found in (62). We can also see that the
Zn-3d shift down in GW. This shift amounts to −2.3 eV in ZnSiN2, −2.0 eV
in ZnGeN2, −1.5 eV in ZnSnN2, and −1.8 eV in CdGeN2. The N-2s bands also

shift down signiﬁcantly more than the top of the valence band, as expected, by
about 1 eV.
Having understood the overall band structure at a scale of about a Rydberg
or so above and below the VBM, we now zoom in on the region near the gap. We
can see that in all materials the conduction band minimum is clearly at Γ. The
conduction band dispersion is high, implying a small electron eﬀective mass. The
region near the valence bands is shown in Fig. 15.5. The valence-band maximum
is also at Γ except in ZnSiN2. In ZnSiN2 one of the valence bands is seen to
disperse upwards both in the Γ −Z and Γ −Y directions, and the actual VBM
occurs along the Γ −Y direction. Thus, of the four II-IV-N2 nitrides studied
here, we ﬁnd three direct-gap and one indirect-gap semiconductors. Even, so
the direct gap is not very diﬀerent from the indirect gap in ZnSiN2 because
the dispersion of the upper valence bands is relatively small. One may expect
that optical absorption will still be dominated by the lowest direct transition
at Γ, but in photoluminescence one might expect the lower gap to show up at
low temperature because the holes would thermalize to their lowest energy, i.e.
the VBM.
Next, we discuss various corrections to the band gap and their comparison to
experimental data. First of all, we have already included a correction to strict
QSGW by including the 0.8 reduction factor of Σxc. Second, we should include
the eﬀects of spin–orbit coupling. Since these split the valence bands, they slightly
reduce the gap. This eﬀect, discussed in the following, is extremely small in
Zn-IV-N2 semiconductors.

entations. The results for Zn-IV-N2 were previously published in (62), and
the one for CdGeN2 in (63).
Third, there is a zero-point motion correction. The electron–phonon eﬀects on
the band structure are discussed in a review article by Cardona and Thewalt (86).
While at high temperature the gap varies more or less linear with temperature,
in part because of the thermal expansion and hence smaller gaps (because the
covalent interactions are reduced), one typically ﬁnds a curving over of the gap
at low temperatures. If one were to extrapolate the gap toward zero temperature
based on the slope and value at room temperature, one would overestimate the
band gap. This remaining discrepancy is due to the zero-point motion eﬀect on
the electron–phonon interaction. It is tabulated in (86) for an extensive list of
semiconductors and in particular for the III-nitrides. Examining these values for
various closely related families as a function of the gap itself, one can see that
they are approximately linearly related. Plotting the values for the III-nitrides,
we ﬁnd that the zero-point motion correction can be approximated by
Δ(0) = −50meV −31 × 10−3Eg
(15.18)
Assuming that the same slope and oﬀset hold for the II-IV-N2 nitrides, we obtain
sizable gap corrections of −227, −161, −126, and −128 meV in ZnSiN2, ZnGeN2,

ﬁeld splittings), and average the inverse masses over direction. We use the static
dielectric constants κ0, calculated using DFPT in (58) and discussed later. We
have not yet carried out such calculations for CdGeN2. We therefore used an
estimate of the dielectric constant for CdGeN2, assuming that within this family
of materials it is proportional to the gap. The use of static dielectric constants is
consistent with the fact that the resultant exciton binding energies are signiﬁc-
antly smaller than the optical phonon frequencies, so one may assume that lattice
distortion contributes to the screening of the Coulomb interaction between elec-
tron and hole. The eﬀective Bohr radius of the exciton is given by (κ0/μ)a0, with
a0 the Bohr radius of hydrogen: 0.529 ˚A. The results are given in Table 15.8.
We note that for ZnSiN2 and ZnGeN2 our values are close to that for GaN:
25 meV (87).

Putting the various corrections together we obtain the results of Table 15.9.
We can see that both LDA and GGA signiﬁcantly underestimate the gaps. Their
diﬀerence is mostly related to the diﬀerence of lattice constant obtained in these
methods. GGA produces slightly larger lattice constants, and hence a smaller
gap. The full QSGW method overestimates the gap typically by about 20%.
When ﬁnally adding the various corrections mentioned, we obtain extremely good
agreement with experiment for ZnGeN2. To be honest, one should keep in mind
that the 0.8 factor is a bit of a fudge factor, and various empirical approximations
were made previously to estimate the other corrections. We therefore should
still put a conservative error bar of 0.1 eV on the gap. Also, notice that we
used the LDA lattice constants, which are somewhat small, and therefore might
overestimate the gaps. Thus, we might actually need a smaller correction factor
than 0.8 if we use experimental lattice constants and explicitly include all the
other corrections mentioned.
For ZnSiN2 our value appears to be a signiﬁcant overestimate by about 1 eV.
We should note, however, that far less experimental work has been done on

ZnSiN2. Signiﬁcant uncertainty clearly exists. The work from Endo et al. (36)
produces a larger lattice constant and an even lower gap of only 3.64 eV. The ﬁrst
gap-determination for ZnGeN2 by means of optical absorption (35) produced a
gap estimate of 2.67 eV, also about 1 eV lower than the recent more accurate
results. The value of 4.46 eV for ZnSiN2 was obtained by absorption on a series
of ZnSixGe1−xN2 alloys (40). The temperature eﬀect on the gap is expected to
be at most 0.2 eV, and cannot explain this discrepancy. We thus think that this
results from defect band-gap tailing and the intrinsic diﬃculty in determining
an accurate gap from transmission measurements. Since it is determined from
absorption and not from photoluminescence, we should clearly compare it with
the direct gap, but even our indirect gap is only a few 0.1 eV smaller. The
slightly smaller indirect than direct gap was noted in previous LDA calculations
by Shaposhnikov et al. (54), and our LDA results are close to theirs, with the
small discrepancies attributable to diﬀerences in the band-structure method or
the lattice constants used.
ZnSnN2 has only very recently been grown in polycrystalline form. Its gap
was determined, by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE), to be
1.7 ± 0.1 eV at room temperature (50). Our overestimate of the calculated gap
(2.02 eV) can in large part be explained by the change in the lattice constant. Our
LDA lattice constant at zero temperature is about 6% smaller than the measured
room-temperature lattice constant. Note that this is probable not only because
of the thermal expansion but also because of the LDA underestimate of the lat-
tice constant, even at 0 K. Using our calculated band-gap deformation potential
dEg/d ln V of −3.89 eV, this reduces the gap by about −0.2 eV, giving a gap
of 1.8 ± 0.1 eV. Thus, theory and experiment are consistent to within about
0.1 eV.1 For CdGeN2 there are no experimental data available.
We note that the direct gaps calculated here correspond to wavelengths of
218 nm, 362 nm, 617 nm, and 469 nm for ZnSiN2, ZnGeN2, ZnSnN2, and
CdGeN2. These values span the red-to-ultraviolet region, with CdGeN2 very
close to the green region. The band gaps versus lattice constants are summar-
ized in Fig. 15.7. Clearly, this materials family has a signiﬁcant potential for
optoelectronic applications, similar to the group-III nitrides. While the known
III-nitrides extend to smaller gaps of 0.7 eV in InN and a larger gap of 6.2 in
AlN, we have not yet explored the full set of possibilities in the II-IV-N2 family.
For example, one might expect CdSnN2 to have a smaller gap closer to that of
InN. Hg instead of Cd would also be expected to lead to smaller gaps. Mg instead
of Zn might extend the gaps on the UV side. On the other hand, the materials
included in Fig. 15.7 have a closer lattice constant match among each other than
the III-nitrides. They are somewhat closer clustered together, and thus interpol-
ation between them by alloying would be expected to result in lower strain and
1We have recently become aware of two recent papers on ZnSnN2 grown by molecular beam
epitaxty (MBE) (88, 89), which indicates a gap of about 2.1 eV. A larger gap may result from
n-type doping and the Moss–Burstein eﬀect.

more ﬂexibility in achieving speciﬁc target band-gaps. For example, we picked
CdGeN2 with the speciﬁc aim of testing whether it could ﬁll the so-called green
gap. Unfortunately, ZnSiN2 is found to be an indirect gap material. At present,
we do not yet know up to what concentration of Si the gap remains direct in
ZnSixGe1−xN2. However, interpolating the indirect gap “near Y to Γ” and the
direct gap at Γ linearly between ZnGeN2 and ZnSiN2, one would predict the gap
to stay direct up to about 51% Si and to reach up to a gap of about 4.56 eV.
Similarly, in ZnSixSn1−xN2, the gap is expected to stay direct up to almost 58%
and to reach a maximum direct gap of about 4.15 eV. This is shown in Fig. 15.8.
Because Zn, Si, and Sn are all abundant elements, in contrast to Ga and In, this
is important from a sustainability point of view, especially for applications in
photovoltaics and solid-state lighting, which require a potentially large amount
of material if widely deployed.
In (63) we also made a ﬁrst estimate of the band gap of the ZnSn0.5Ge0.5N2
alloy. For this purpose we used only one structural model in which the ﬁrst
layer contains Sn and the second Ge in the usual II-IV-N2 unit cell. This further

tion according to Eq. 15.1 is shown in Fig. 15.9 This predicts a gap corresponding

Eﬀective-mass Hamiltonians
In this section we zoom further in to the top of the valence band, and discuss
its ﬁne structure. This is shown for all four materials on which we focus here in
Fig. 15.5. We ﬁrst notice that the valence bands at Γ are already split into three,
even without including spin–orbit coupling. This is a result of the orthorhombic
symmetry. By inspecting the eigenvectors we determined their symmetry labeling
as indicated in Fig. 15.5. The conduction-band minimum at Γ has a1 symmetry in
all cases. This implies that optical transitions are only dipole allowed between a1
and a1 for E ∥c between b1 and a1 for E ∥a, and between b2 and a1 for E ∥b. In
other words, the optical absorption and luminescence should display additional
anisotropy compared to the wurtzite group-III-nitrides. Even for normal emission
from the basal plane, the light emission should be anisotropic. This is potentially
of use for polarization-sensitive detectors.
The valence-band splittings in the absence of spin–orbit coupling can be
described in terms of two crystal ﬁeld splitting parameters (62):
Ea1 = 0
Eb2 = Δ1c + Δ2c
Eb1 = Δ1c −Δ2c
(15.20)
The values of these parameters are given in Table 15.11. Based on symmetry
there are three diﬀerent spin–orbit coupling parameters. The crystal ﬁeld and
spin–orbit coupling Hamiltonian of the VBM can be written as
HC2v(Γ) = Δ1cLz
2 + Δ2c(Lx
2 −Ly

The order of the basis function is m = 1 ↑, m = 0 ↓, and m = −1 ↑, or equi-
valently, m = −1 ↓, m = 0 ↑, and m = 1 ↓. The eigenvalues are indeed doubly
degenerate in spin because of Kramer’s theorem, related to time-reversal sym-
metry. If we assume that the spin–orbit coupling parameters are essentially
isotropic, Δso1 = Δso2 = Δso3 = Δs, which is usually a good approximation,

because spin–orbit coupling arises from the inner part of the atom where the
potential is close to spherically symmetric, we can make some progress by
ﬁrst applying the unitary transformation that diagonalized the matrix without
spin–orbit coupling. This leads to

Strictly speaking, all levels have symmetry Γ5 if we use the double-group nota-
tion, but we still label them by the single-group label from which they are derived.
We carried out calculations including spin–orbit coupling for the Zn-IV-N2, and
found that the splittings were essentially indistinguishable from those without
spin–orbit coupling. This indicates that the spin–orbit coupling parameter is
very small in these compounds, and makes it at this point impractical and at
the same time unimportant to try to extract these small parameters.
The reason for this small spin–orbit coupling is worth some discussion. For
the parent compounds, GaN, we ﬁnd it is already rather small, because (1) the
N atom is a low-Z element for which relativistic eﬀects are small, (2) there
is a negative contribution from the Ga-3d states lying below the VBM, but
which are nevertheless somewhat hybridized with the VBM. In ZnGeN2 this
negative contribution, which now derives from the Zn-3d, must be even stronger.
In fact, we know that in ZnO the spin–orbit splitting becomes negative (90).
One expects it here to be intermediate between GaN and ZnO, because only half
the cation sites contribute. The Ge-3d or Sn-4d states lie signiﬁcantly deeper, so
their contribution must be signiﬁcantly smaller. Apparently, the 3d contribution
must almost perfectly cancel the N-2p contribution. The same is true in CdGeN2
with the 4d level.
In order to describe the valence-band maximum manifold of states for k-points
close to the Γ-point, it is useful to derive an eﬀective mass Hamiltonian (EMH)
by means of the theory of invariants. In zincblende crystals this is well known
as the Kohn–Luttinger Hamiltonian (91, 92), and in wurtzite it is known as the

548

Rashba–Sheka–Pikus Hamiltonian (93, 94). In Punya et al. (62) we generalized
this for the orthorhombic symmetry. The Hamiltonian for this case is of the form:

where {Li, Lj} are anti-commutators. This includes all terms up to second order
that can be formed from the operators Li, ki, and σi that are invariant (i.e. be-
long to the a1 representation). At k = 0 we have two crystal ﬁeld splittings and
three spin–orbit splitting parameters. The remaining terms are inverse eﬀect-
ive masses, and the parameters E1 and E2 are linear in ki. We have neglected
purely relativistic linear terms involving σi and ki. If Δ2c = 0, Δ2so = Δ3so,
A3 = 0, B3 = 0, C1 = C2 = 0, C3 = 2D1, D2 = D3, and E2 = −E1, the above
Hamiltonian is reduced to the RSP Hamiltonian valid for C6v symmetry. If we

have the relations:

(15.28)
In Table 15.10 we summarize the various VBM and CBM eﬀective masses, and
in Table 15.11 we summarize the Ai, Bi, Ci parameters. The remaining para-
meters Di enter only if we look at bands in directions intermediate between
in-basal-plane and out-of-basal-plane. Assuming the crystal is not too far from
hexagonal, which we could call a quasi-hexagonal approximation, one would have
the relation D1 = C3/2. Furthermore, within the quasi-cubic relation, one has
the approximate relation ˜A6 = (4 ˜A5 −˜A3)/
√
2 in the wurtzite case. This leads
here to the relation D2 = D3 = 4C3 −A2. Thus the Di parameters can be ob-
tained approximately from those already determined. On the other hand, to
obtain these parameters more accurately we can consider a direction in k-space
intermediate between the principal axes directions. We ﬁnd that they aﬀect only
the bands farther away from Γ. Compared to our previous results (62) we here
reﬁtted the data over a larger region up to k about 0.1 in units of 2π/a. The Ei
linear in k-parameters are related to the anti-crossing behavior of the bands one
can observe, for example, for the b2 and a1 bands along Γ −Y in ZnGeN2. They
are determined by ﬁtting the bands close to these anti-crossing points.
We may note that the parameters for GaN, which were recently determined by
us from QSGW calculations (96), when described as an orthorhombic material,
are not too far from those of ZnGeN2. The crystal ﬁeld splittings, however, are
signiﬁcantly larger in the II-IV-N2. This may have important consequences for
shallow acceptor levels. We found recently that in III-N materials the shallow
acceptor levels in the eﬀective mass approximation depend sensitively on the
crystal ﬁeld splitting. This would indicate deeper levels in the II-IV-N2 materials.
These Hamiltonians are also useful for describing size quantization eﬀects in
various nanostructures, 2D quantum wells, cylindrical nanowires, and spherical
nanocrystals.

Lattice dynamics

Computational method
In order to calculate the vibrational modes we need the force-constants, which
are second derivatives of the total energy versus the atomic displacements. Unlike
forces, which can be obtained via the force theorem from the charge density of the
unperturbed system, this requires knowledge of the ﬁrst-order corrections to the
wavefunctions. The reason why the unperturbed density can be used to estimate
the forces is that errors in the charge density lead only to second-order errors in
the total energy, and forces are ﬁrst-order changes in the energy. The appropriate
theoretical framework for calculating force constants is density-functional per-
turbation theory (DFPT), or linear-response theory. This method diﬀers from
“textbook” perturbation theory in the sense that the ﬁrst-order corrections of
the wavefunction are calculated self-consistently with the ﬁrst-order changes in
charge density which they produce within the framework of density-functional
theory. Once the charge density has only second-order errors, the corresponding
total energy has only fourth-order errors, and hence, up to third-order derivatives
of the total energy can be computed. This is known as the 2n + 1-theorem (97).
The beauty of linear-response theory is that if we impose a ﬁrst-order change
in the external potential, say a displacement wave with wavevector q, then the

response to ﬁrst order also involves only Fourier components of wavevector q.
By rewriting the perturbation theory in terms of the periodic parts of the Bloch
functions, one can obtain the relevant force constants for any arbitrary q from
calculations of the standard primitive cell. In other words, there is no need to
construct supercells with sizes commensurate with the imposed perturbation
wavevector periodicity, as in the frozen-phonon methods (98, 99).
The long wavelength limit corresponding to q →0 presents its own special
problems for compounds with partially ionic bonding. As is well known, there are
LO-TO splittings related to the long-range Coulomb forces. These are treated
analytically in the DFPT by considering separately the response to a static elec-
tric ﬁeld. The latter are treated as a separate type of perturbation. The derivative
of the total energy versus the electric ﬁeld is the polarization, and although it
also breaks the crystal periodicity, it can be calculated using the modern theory
of polarization (100, 101) in terms of a Berry phase. The polarization itself is
not uniquely deﬁned, but adiabatic changes in polarization, which maintain the

insulating phase along the entire adiabatic transition, are. We may then consider
various mixed second-derivatives:

(15.31)
Here, τ R = τ + R is the position of atom τ in a unit cell, with lattice vector R
and τα indicating its Cartesian components. Fτα is the long-range force on atom τ
in the α direction, and Pβ is the polarization in the β direction. The ﬁrst of these
equations gives the short-range contribution to the force constants, the second
represents the Born-eﬀective charge tensor, and the third is the high-frequency
electronic susceptibility. The latter corresponds to below-band-gap frequencies,
because we include only static electric ﬁelds, but do not include the phonon
contributions. For a general wavevector q, we form the Bloch sum,
Kτα, τ ′α′ =

R′−R
KRτα, R′τ′α′eiq·(R′−R)

give the longitudinal modes, while the poles give the transverse modes. Thus
the LO-TO splittings of each mode that is subject to long-range forces can be
calculated.
As a byproduct, we obtain the dielectric constant tensor at high frequency,
ε∞
αα, from which we can obtain the indices of diﬀraction, discussed in Section 15.9.
Furthermore, the imaginary part of the above dielectric function gives us expli-
citly the infrared absorption spectrum due to the phonons. Using the real part,
we can also obtain the infrared reﬂectivity and the loss function, ℑ{−ε−1
αα(ω)},
whose peaks correspond to the LO modes. As already mentioned, we can also
obtain the phonons for ﬁnite wavevector q and hence the full phonon spectrum,
as well as the phonon density of states. By taking various integrals of these func-
tions one obtains the lattice-dynamical contributions to the thermal properties,
such as the speciﬁc heat, and the vibrational entropy.
Finally, we turn to Raman spectroscopy. The Raman intensity is proportional
to |ei · Rm · eo|2 where ei and eo are the incident and scattered light polariza-
tion vectors and R is the second rank Raman susceptibility tensor for mode m,
given by

(15.38)
calculated from a third derivative of the total energy. As already mentioned,
this can still be obtained from the ﬁrst-order corrections to the wavefunctions,
because of the 2n + 1 theorem.
Now we turn to some speciﬁc group-theoretical considerations for the mater-
ials at hand. The modes subject to LO-TO splitting are those that transform
like the components of a vector, i.e. b1, b2, a1 for electric ﬁelds along x, y, z or
a, b, c crystallographic axes. These modes are infrared-active. So, the only mode
which is not infrared-active is a2.
All modes are Raman active but still diﬀerent selection rules apply. For a1
symmetry the tensor is diagonal:
a1 :
⎛
⎜
⎝
a

b

(15.39)
which means that incident and scattered light must have parallel polarization
but diﬀerent values will be obtained for the x, y and z direction. The scatter-
ing geometry is fully speciﬁed by giving ki(eieo)ko. If the scattering wavevector
q = ko −ki is parallel to the polarization of the mode, then the longitudinal

modes are excited, otherwise the transverse ones. For example, x(yy)¯x will meas-
ure the b component of the a1T modes, while z(yy)¯z will measure the b for the
a1L modes. The remaining modes correspond to oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of
the Raman tensor, as follows:

Vibrational modes at the zone center
Since there are sixteen atoms per cell, there are forty-eight degrees of free-
dom. These break up in twelve modes of each symmetry, a1, b1, b2, and a2.
The three modes of a1, b1, and b2 of zero frequency correspond to translations
of the lattice and are omitted. This leaves eleven modes of these symmetries
each, but these are subject to LO-TO splitting, so we list twenty-two modes for
each of these. This amounts to seventy-eight modes in total. They are listed in
Table 15.12 for ZnSiN2 from (56), ZnGeN2 from (55), and ZnSnN2 from (58).
They are all calculated using the DFPT described above and in the local-density
approximation.
Compared to the wurtzite crystals, the ﬁrst thing to notice is the multitude
of modes and the much smaller LO-TO splittings. Because the unit cell of the
II-IV-N2 crystal is doubled in two directions compared to the wurtzite unit cell,
one might think that the modes would be closely related to folded modes from the
Brillouin zone boundary of wurtzite. The latter, in turn, are often interpreted as
folded zone modes of the zincblende cell. For example, the E2 modes and B1 silent
modes can be interpreted as L-point modes of zincblende folded onto Γ. This
concept was explored in some detail in (55) for ZnGeN2. While it holds to some
degree for the acoustic branches, which extend more or less between the Elow
2
and
the Blow
1
modes of wurtzite GaN, the optic-mode range shows a clear splitting in
two peaks when viewed as a histogram or Gaussian broadened spectrum. This
is shown in Fig. 15.10, reproduced from (55). This reﬂects the bimodal bond
distribution of Zn-N and Ge-N bonds, which have clearly diﬀerent frequencies as
well as the LO-TO splitting. However, the situation is actually more complex.
While in wurtzite, A1 and B1 symmetries allow motion only in the z direction,
and E1, E2 symmetry allows motion only in the basal plane, this separation of
out-of-plane and in-plane motion no longer holds in the orthorhombic structure.
Figure 15.11 illustrates the displacements corresponding to each symmetry.
Thus, for example, an a1 symmetry mode involves motion of the four equivalent
Wyckoﬀposition atoms in the same direction in the z-motion, and can also
involve x and y motions with the appropriate symmetry pattern that leave the
orthorhombic symmetry unchanged. This means that much more interaction
between the wurtzite-derived modes is allowed once we break the symmetry

to C2v. This also allows for modes of fairly low frequency to already have a
signiﬁcant oscillator strength.
Low-frequency modes correspond primarily to motions of groups of atoms,
as illustrated for an example mode a3
1T at 192 cm−1 and a4
1T at 224 cm−1 in
Fig. 15.12, in which we indicate the pattern of the motion by showing the x,
y, and z displacements of each of the atoms. One can see that the z-motions of
all atoms of a given type are in unison, but one may also see that the Zn and
the NZn and the Ge and NGe move in the same direction. This is why it is a
low-frequency mode. However, the displacements of these atoms are not equal,
so there is some stretching of the bonds accompanying it, and hence this mode
is weakly optically active. At the same time, the atoms also exhibit in-plane
vibrations because these are also allowed by a1 symmetry. In this particular
mode we can see that the x and y displacements are actually larger than the
z-motions. We can see that the Zn and NZn, as well as Ge and NGe, move as a
group in the x and y as well as the z direction. The mode a4
1T has a signiﬁcant
oscillator strength, even though it is still a low-frequency mode. We can see that
it has a signiﬁcant Zn–N bond stretch, but Zn has a larger displacement than
the N to which it is bonded. On the other hand, Ge and NGe move in the same
direction.
We examine various other a1T modes in Figs. 15.14 and 15.15. The a1 sym-
metry modes for Zn-IV-N2 are shown in Fig. 15.13 from (58). From this ﬁgure
and the following mode patterns one can see which modes ultimately have a
strong oscillator strength in the infrared spectrum.
We may notice that for the higher-frequency modes, the cations and anions
in a bond move in opposite directions. Also, the displacements of the lighter N
atoms are much larger than those of the cations. Mode a9
1t is of special interest,
because we show in the following that it is the strongest mode in the Raman
spectrum. The upshot is that the modes are complex combinations of the wurtzite
modes, and symmetry is not of much use to unravel them.

15.6.3
Phonon dispersions and density of states
We have already indicated in the previous section that the vibrational spectrum
of the II-IV-N2 is much more complex than one would expect on the basis of zone-
folding. In fact, in ZnSiN2 even the distinction between acoustic branch modes
and optic branch modes becomes somewhat blurred. In wurtzite, the six upper
modes (A1, Bhigh
1
, E1 doubly degenerate, Ehigh
2
doubly degenerate) can be viewed
as truly optic modes, with the lower six bands folded acoustic bands. Because of
the quadrupling of the number of atoms in the cell, one thus expects twenty-four
optic and twenty-four acoustic-type vibrational bands. In ZnGeN2 and ZnSnN2
there is indeed a clear gap between the lower and upper twenty-four bands.
However, in ZnSiN2, only the lower twelve bands are separated by a small gap
from the upper thirty-six bands. This is most clearly seen in Fig. 15.16, showing
the full phonon band structure and phonon density of states, taken from (58).
From the phonon densities of states, one can also determine various thermal
properties such as the vibrational speciﬁc heat and entropy contributions. We
refer the interested reader to (58).
15.6.4
Infrared spectroscopy
We now turn to a discussion of the infrared spectra as a measurement of the
vibrational modes. As already mentioned, the b1, b2, and a1 modes are optically

active for polarizations of the light along x, y, z respectively. Full sets of predicted
spectra can be found in (58). Here we focus on the only case for which exper-
imental data are available: ZnSiN2. Even in this case, only the modes for one
symmetry were determined experimentally: namely, the b1 symmetry (56, 42).
The experiments were carried out on thin ﬁlms grown on r-plane sapphire by
Mintairov et al. (42) The results are shown in Fig. 15.17.
While there is fair agreement between the calculated and experimental res-
ults, we emphasize that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the interpretation of
the results. One would expect that ﬁve modes are of the folded acoustic type
and would have low oscillator strength, and six are true optic and have strong
oscillator strength and correspondingly strong LO-TO splitting. Thus, the ex-
perimentalists ﬁtted their measured reﬂectivity spectrum to six modes, and these

correspond to the six peaks one sees in the Imε(ω) and −Imε−1(ω) spectra, ex-
tracted from the ﬁt. However, as we can see from the calculation, the highest
two energy peaks actually correspond to two individual frequencies. On the other
hand, some of the lower-frequency modes have signiﬁcant oscillator strength. This
was discussed in the previous section.
The broadening of the modes was adjusted in our calculation to obtain the
best ﬁt to the experiment. This broadening may arise from the anharmonic
coupling to modes with wavevector q ̸= 0. For example, the sharpest mode at
417 cm−1 occurs in a region where the density of phonon states integrated over
the whole Brillouin zone is low, while the broader peaks correspond to frequencies
where the DOS is high. This can be seen in Fig. 15.16 This may in particular
explain why the lowest-frequency peak at about 300 cm−1 is not seen at all
in the experiment. Additional complications in extracting the frequencies and
experimental oscillator strengths occur because of the interference of modes with
those from the sapphire substrate. The peak at 417 cm−1 appears to be much

peak in the substrate reﬂection. Furthermore, the samples may be expected to
be under some strain, which could lead to peak shifts. On the other hand, LDA
also somewhat overbinds and may thereby overestimate the phonon frequencies.
The LDA overestimate of dielectric screening, on the other hand, may lead to
an underestimate of the LO-TO splittings. More details can be found in (56).
Clearly, much more work needs to be done to fully determine the infrared
spectra for other symmetries and for the other II-IV-N2 nitrides.
15.6.5
Raman spectroscopy
For ZnGeN2 there are two experimental studies of Raman data: one on polycrys-
talline powder samples (48), and one on single-crystal needles of about 3 μm in
diameter, as well as polycrystalline material consisting of sub-micron-size crys-
tallites (57). These spectra are quite diﬀerent. For the samples of Viennois et al.
(48) the Raman spectrum looks like a phonon density of states. This would make
sense if the crystal momentum conservation law is broken, e.g. by the small grain
size. Although the crystallite sizes were not discussed by Viennois, we proceed
with the assumption that they are small, or other severe disorder breaks the
crystalline symmetry. A comparison of their spectrum with phonon density of
states is shown in Fig. 15.18. One can see the importance of the second har-

and the largest peaks occur where harmonics of lower modes coincide with the
fundamentals of the spectrum.
In contrast, for the single-crystal needles one obtains a very sharp Raman
spectrum in which the q = 0 allowed modes are clearly observed. For polariza-
tion of the incident and reﬂected light both parallel to the c-axis, these are the
a1T modes, which show the zz component of the Raman tensor. This spectrum
is shown in Fig. 15.19. However, one can still see some peaks which correspond
to the phonon density of states, showing that there is an additional disordered
Raman scattering contribution.2 The nature of this disorder is not entirely clear.
Point defects may be responsible. The second harmonics of the latter appear
much weaker, but could be responsible for the peak at 400 cm−1—a region where
there are no fundamental modes, because it lies in the gap between folded acous-
tic and optic modes. Additional information on the polarization-dependence
of this spectrum are given in (57). In particular, it was possible to determine
some changes in the Raman tensor for the a1T modes near 200 cm−1 when the
2An alternative interpretation for these peaks is that they correspond to forbidden LO
modes, excited by the Fr¨ohlich interaction. As the LO bands are ﬂat, LO modes at Γ, and
peaks in the density of states arising from the Brillouin zone boundary, are close to each other.
Which of the two interpretations, disorder or LO phonons, is correct will require further study.
LO phonons would be strongly enhanced in resonant Raman scattering, while disorder-induced
modes should be reduced in samples of improved quality.

polarization was perpendicular to the c-axis, which is the long axis of the needle
crystals. This is shown in Fig. 15.20.
Comparison with the calculated spectra allowed us to determine that the light
polarization corresponds to the y, i.e. b direction of the crystal. This means that
we could use Raman spectroscopy to determine how the needle crystal was lying
on the microscope slide used in these micro-Raman studies! This was further
conﬁrmed by the measurements with crossed-polarization, which then showed
some evidence of the b2 modes. See (57) for further details.
The occurrence of sharp peaks supports the high crystalline quality, which
was placed in evidence by XRD and the clear facetting of the crystals. It also
provides evidence for the cation ordering. However, the experimentally observed
polarization changes in the Raman spectrum were far smaller experimentally
than expected from theory. In (57) we analyzed the eﬀects of the focusing of the
beam into a small spot, which leads to some angular spread in the sample, and
found that these eﬀects could not fully explain the eﬀect, though they could
explain partially why the a1T spectrum is not completely suppressed under
crossed-polarizer conditions.

Fig. 15.20. Polarization-dependence of the measured Raman spectrum in
ZnGeN2, from (57). Both spectra for Ei ∥Eo ∥c and Ei ∥Eo ⊥c measure
the same a1T modes, but correspond to a diﬀerent Raman tensor element.
The calculated spectra for each Raman tensor component are shown in the
bottom panel. The occurrence of three peaks instead of two peaks at low
frequency is consistent with the yy component of the Raman tensor.
The question of cation disorder is somewhat subtle. In fact, if the cations were
fully disordered on their wurtzite sublattice, one would expect to see modes more
similar to those in wurtzite crystals. In wurtzite crystals the Ehigh
2
mode is often
the dominant mode visible in Raman spectrocopy. The strongest mode in the
a1T Raman spectrum happens to coincide with a mode that is somewhat similar
in its displacement pattern to an E2 wurtzite-type mode. In fact, E2 of the C6v
point group decomposes into a1, and a2 of C2v. This means that it is compatible
with a1 symmetry. Inspecting the a1 pattern in Fig. 15.11 one can see that
corresponding atoms in the upper and lower plane move opposite to each other
in the x and y directions. This is precisely what an E2 mode implies in wurtzite.
In other words, as far as its in-plane motion is concerned, an a1 mode is like an
E2 mode in wurtzite. The same is true for an a2 mode, but in this case the z
motions are like a B1 of wurtzite. One can also see, from Fig. 15.15, which is
the strong Raman mode, that the x displacements (in-plane) are large for both
the NZn and NGe. This in-plane motion corresponds to Ehigh
2
-like bond stretches.
The fact that this Ehigh
2
-like mode stays strong even for other polarizations may
indicate that the sample responds in part like a wurtzite crystal.

This could mean that there is partial disorder on the cation sublattice. At
present, we cannot tell how good the cation-ordering is. X-ray diﬀraction or
electron diﬀraction is not capable of determining it in ZnGeN2 because of the
closeness of Zn and Ge electron densities. The presence of the other sharply
deﬁned modes indicates that there is at least partial order, but the robustness
of the Ehigh
2
-like mode may indicate that the spectrum is also compatible with a
wurtzite-like component in the spectrum; in other words, some cation sublattice
disorder. This antisite disorder may also in part be responsible for the density-
of-states-like features in the Raman spectrum.
Nonetheless, there is clearly a large change between the powder spectra of
Viennois et al. (48) and the needle Raman spectra. Even for the polycrystalline
regions of the samples studied in (57), and whose growth is described by Du
et al. (49), the Raman spectrum showed rather sharp features more similar to
those of the needles than to the broad density-of-states-like spectrum of Viennois
et al. (48). This might be indicative of a larger grain size than in Viennois
et al. (48).
Again, much work remains to be done. Raman on thin-ﬁlm samples with
the c-plane as surface would allow one possibly for studying other vibrational
modes. No Raman spectra have yet been reported for ZnSiN2. For ZnSnN2 the
Raman spectrum agreed well with the calculated density of phonon states (50).
The sharp q = 0 allowed lines were not observed, and the origin of the larger
disorder is presently unknown.

Theoretical considerations
Using an extension of the DFPT method developed by Hamann and Wu (102,
103), strains, i.e. changes of the shape and size of the unit cell, can also be
treated as perturbations. This opens the way toward calculating a number of
other interesting lattice-dynamical properties. The second derivatives
cij =
∂2U
∂ηi∂ηj
(15.41)
give the elastic constants. Here the index i = 1 . . . 6 uses the Voigt notation.
It is a shortcut for two Cartesian indices αβ, using the fact that the strain
tensor is symmetric, ηxx →η1, ηyy →η2, ηzz →η3, ηyz, ηzy →η4, ηxz, ηzx →η5,
ηxy, ηyx →η6. The stress tensor is σi = ∂U/∂ηi. Using electric ﬁeld and strain
as basic variables, the direct and converse piezoelectric eﬀect can be written:
Pα = eαjηj + χη
αβEβ
(15.42)
σi = cE
ijηj −eαiEα
(15.43)

566
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
The ﬁrst equation tells us that a polarization is induced not only by an
electric ﬁeld but also by a strain. The electric susceptibility χη
αβ is speciﬁed to
be measured at ﬁxed strain, say zero strain. Thus,
eαj = ∂Pα
∂ηj

E
= −∂σi
∂Eα

η
=
∂2U
∂Eα∂ηi
(15.44)
Here the electric ﬁeld must be kept ﬁxed while taking the strain derivative, for
example at zero value, in the ﬁrst equation, and the strain must be kept ﬁxed
in the second equality, while the third shows us that this is just another second
derivative of the total energy. Instead of polarization P one can also use the
dielectric displacement instead, and write
Dα = eαjηj + εη
αβEβ
(15.45)
Instead of the susceptibility, the dielectric constant appears in this case. From a
computational point of view it is most easy to prescribe the strain and calculate
the strain-derivative of the polarization using the Berry phase approach. From
an experimental point of view, however, one prefers to ﬁx the stress. Switching
to stress as a basic variable, one can write the converse piezoelectric ﬁeld as
ηi = sE
ijσj + dαiEα
(15.46)
Here, sE
ij is the compliance tensor, which is the inverse of the elastic stiﬀness
tensor, measured at constant electric ﬁeld. The second type of piezoelectric tensor
dαi is thus given by
dαi = ∂ηi
∂Eα

σ
(15.47)
In other words, one measures the strain induced by an electric ﬁeld at constant
stress. It is therefore called the piezoelectric strain tensor. On the other hand,
eαi is called the piezoelectric stress tensor, because according to eq. (15.43) it
gives the stress produced by an electric ﬁeld. Using the direct equation but with
stress as basic variable, one writes
Pα = dαiσi + χσ
αβEβ
(15.48)
Setting the electric ﬁeld equal to zero and using σi = cE
ijηj, we obtain Pα =
dαicE
ijηj and hence
eαj = dαicE
ij
(15.49)
Thus, given the elastic constants measured at ﬁxed (or zero electric ﬁeld) we can
convert the piezoelectric strain tensor to the piezoelectric stress tensor. Similarly,
dαi = eαjsE
ji
(15.50)

Elastic and piezoelectric tensors

The number of independent components of these tensors is determined by the
macroscopic or point-group symmetry of the crystal. For example, in wurtzite,
with C6v symmetry, c11 = c22, c13 = c23, c44 = c55, while in the orthorhombic
C2v case, these tensor components can be diﬀerent.
15.7.2
Values for nitrides
In Table 15.13 we show the elastic constants of the Zn-IV-N2 compounds
compared to those of the III-N compounds taken from (59).
The values for the III-nitrides were calculated by Wright et al. (104), using a
more direct approach using ﬁnite strains and numerical derivatives. The values
for GaN in the second GaN column were calculated by Boonchun and Lambrecht
(10) using the same DFPT approach as used for the Zn-IV-N2 materials. For
GaN we also give the experimental values determined by Brillouin scattering
from Polian et al. (105). This gives some idea of the uncertainties of the diﬀerent
computational methods compared to experiment. The trends are similar to those
in the nitrides. The elastic constants decrease as we go from Si to Ge to Sn,
just as they do from Al to Ga to In. Using the values calculated by the same
DFPT method for GaN and ZnGeN2, their elastic constants are within 10%
of each other. This is within the error bar of uncertainty, given the deviations
from experiment and other computational methods. ZnSnN2 appears to have
systematically somewhat larger lattice constants than InN.
The piezoelectric stress constants eαi are given in Table 15.14, again compared
with those of the III-nitrides. Note that in wurtzite, e15 = e24 and e31 = e32.

−0.55 Cm−2, while for AlN (108) they are 1.5 and −0.6 C/m2. Experimentally,
the measured quantities are the dαj coeﬃcients. We converted them to eαj us-
ing the above-mentioned relationship eq. (15.49) and the elastic constants from
Wright (104). Speciﬁcally, this means
e15 = d15c44
e31 = d31(c11 + c12) + d33c13
e33 = 2d31c13 + d33c33
(15.51)
Experimental data are available for d15 in GaN, and AlN by Muensit et al.
(108), and using the elastic constants from Wright et al. (104) convert to |e15| =
0.29 Cm−2 for GaN and 0.42 Cm−2 for AlN. This value for GaN is close to our
calculated value for ZnGeN2, as expected. The sign of these coeﬃcients depends
on how the Cartesian axes are oriented versus the crystal structure polarity
(positive from anion to cation along its axial bond), and it is not clear from the
experimental data if the sign was actually determined.
Overall, we can see that the values for the Zn-IV-N2 compounds are compar-
able to the corresponding III-N; in particular, for ZnGeN2 and GaN, although
the values for ZnSiN2 are smaller than those in AlN. AlN has been considered
for surface-acoustic-wave applications because of its high piezoelectric constants.
Thus the Zn-IV-N2 compounds are also suitable for piezoelectric applications.

As a byproduct of our investigation into lattice dynamics, we obtain the

Spontaneous polarization
The II-IV-N2 materials, like the wurtzite structure group-III nitrides, are po-
lar materials but also pyroelectric. This means that they can have spontaneous
polarization. Spontaneous polarizations have played an important role in group-
III nitrides. They lead to a surface charge density at the interface between two
nitrides along the basal plane σ = ΔP · ˆn, with ΔP the diﬀerence in polariza-
tion between the two materials (2-1) and ˆn the normal to the interface pointing
from 1 to 2. In turn, this leads to an electric ﬁeld in quantum wells made of
diﬀerent III-N semiconductors, such as GaN sandwiched between AlxGa1−xN.
This can have beneﬁcial as well as detrimental eﬀects, depending on the type
of device pursued. In optoelectronic devices it leads to a separation of electron
and holes on two diﬀerent ends of the quantum well, which reduces the overlap
of their wavefunctions and hence the optical oscillator strength of excitons. To
avoid this, there is now an eﬀort to grow III-nitrides on non-polar and semipolar
planes. On the other hand, the electric ﬁeld may provide conﬁnement in a two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the heterojunction between two nitrides.
Such high-density electron gases are of interest in ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors, and
can provide doping without extrinsic impurities. This in particular occurs in ra-
dial heterojunction quantum wires, where much larger concentration diﬀerences
between the two materials can be tolerated than in planar structures.
The spontaneous polarization, however, is not a uniquely deﬁned quantity
for a bulk material. Strictly speaking, only adiabatic changes in the polarization
are well-deﬁned. However, in the modern theory of polarization (100, 101) it
can be calculated from a Berry phase in k-space. The so-calculated P is only
deﬁned modulo a quantum 2eR/Ω where R is a lattice vector and Ω the unit cell
volume, and in the present case (59) only to within 2e(n + 1
4)c/Ω. However, this
arbitrary quantum depends only on the cross-sectional area, and at a coherent
interface this stays the same. So, it plays no role in determining the ΔP at a
heterojunction. As in wurtzite, the only non-zero component of the polarization
is along the c direction.
The spontaneous polarizations of the Zn-IV-N2 nitrides are given in
Table 15.17. One can see that the diﬀerence between them are much smaller than
those between the III-nitrides, and that all values are close to that of GaN. This
means that one may expect the spontaneous polarization eﬀects between GaN
Table 15.17 Spontaneous polarizations in Zn-IV-N2 and III-N materials, in

Optical properties
Optical properties in the infrared and Raman spectroscopy have already been
discussed in the section on lattice dynamics. Here we focus on optical properties
related to the electronic interband transitions.
15.9.1
Indices of refraction
The indices of refraction are given by n =
√
ε∞and are shown in Table 15.18.
These values are obtained from the high-frequency dielectric constant tensor
κ∞given previously. By “high-frequency” we mean high relative to the phonon
frequencies but low with respect to the band-gap energy.
One can see that the x and y components are closer to each other than to
the z component. This is expected in view of the close similarity of the structure
to wurtzite. On the other hand, Limpijumnong et al. (52) obtained the diﬀerent
result that nz ≈ny ̸= nx. These results were obtained in a diﬀerent way, using
the RPA equation for the imaginary part of the dielectric function as a function
of frequency above the band gap and then calculating the real part of ε(ω)
for ω →0. This does not include local ﬁeld eﬀects, whereas the Berry phase
calculation does. On the other hand, it is probable that this discrepancy results
from a not-fully-relaxed crystals structure in (52). This matter requires further
investigation. We can now calculate the frequency (or wavelength dependence)
in the region below the band gap using GW calculations, and plan to do so in the
near future. In any case, we believe the more recent result to be more accurate.
Misaki et al. (44) measured the UV reﬂectivity of ZnGeN2 ﬁlms. Although
the thin ﬁlms showed signiﬁcant interference eﬀects at low frequency below the
gap, they were able to perform a Kramers–Kronig analysis, and hence extract
indices of refraction, and extinction coeﬃcients, as well as the real and imaginary
part of the dielectric function up to about 100 eV. They found a larger nz than
n⊥, but did not distinguish between diﬀerent directions in the c-plane. From
ellipsometry they obtained a nz = 2.46 ± 0.12 at 632.8 nm. This is in quite good
agreement with the data shown in Table 15.18.

Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
The indices of refraction were measured for ZnSiN2 by Cook et al. (39),
and for ZnSixGe1−xN2 alloys by Muth et al. (38). They discuss the indices of
refraction corresponding to TE and TM-guided modes in the thin ﬁlm on top
of r-plane sapphire with a buﬀer layer of GaN between, which complicates the
analysis. If we assume that their TM modes correspond to ny, their TEmin to
nx and TEmax to nz, then their values for the longest wavelength measured
(676.4 nm) are nz = 2.205, nx = 2.179, and ny = 2.180 for ZnSiN2. This agrees
with the notion that nz > nx ≈ny. The values are a little smaller than our
calculated values. Our overestimate is probably due to the use of the LDA. LDA
underestimates the gap, hence overestimates ε and the index of refraction. For
ZnGeN2, Muth et al. (38) give an index of refraction of 2.34 for the TM mode
at 632.8 nm. We assume this is ny. This is indeed smaller than the nz measured
and reported by Misaki et al. (44) at the same wavelength, and would indicate a
birefringence of about 0.12. This is consistent with our calculations, which give a
Δn = nz −ny ≈0.1. In this case, our calculated values are a little smaller than
the experimental values. This is perhaps because we have not yet properly taken
into account the wavelength dispersion.
In summary, the calculated indices of refraction are in reasonable agreement
with the rather incomplete experimental data available on ZnSiN2 and ZnGeN2.
It is safe to say that the materials are approximately birefringent, with nz > nx.
In other words, the materials are positive birefringent with ne > no, although
strictly speaking the materials are biaxial.

UV dielectric functions
The imaginary part of the dielectric function in the UV region has already been
calculated by Limpijumnong et al. (52), but a full analysis of the dielectric
function in terms of speciﬁc interband transitions has not yet been carried out.
Overall, it showed a ε2(ω) function similar to that of GaN, with several peaks
between 7 and 12 eV. After the initial onset at the gap, it shows a sharp rise at
just above 5 eV and decays rapidly above 13 eV.
This is in basic agreement with the measurements of Misaki et al. (44) men-
tioned previously. Misaki et al. (44) performed their own LDA calculations but
apparently only for E ⊥c, and without explicitly telling which direction in the
plane. They obtained a reasonable agreement between peak positions in the-
ory and experiment, and also in agreement with the results of Limpijumnong
et al. (52). However, as already mentioned for the indices of refraction, there are
discrepancies between Limpijumnong et al. polarization dependence and exper-
iment also for the higher frequency ε2(ω). Misaki et al. mostly just note a slight
shift to lower frequencies for E ∥c for peaks at 4.5 and 6.5 eV, while the peaks
at 7.3 eV and 10.7 eV stayed the same. Clearly, more work is needed to analyze
these spectra.

15.9.3
Non-linear optics
Because chalcopyrite crystals have found their main applications as non-linear
optical-frequency conversion materials, it is of interest to also examine these
properties in the II-IV-N2 materials. Limpijumnong et al. (52) calculated
the second harmonic generation coeﬃcients. They ﬁnd χ(2)
αβγ coeﬃcients of
−0.800 pm/V for the zzz or 33 component, −0.293 pm/V for the zyy or 32, and
−0.682 pm/V for the zxx or 31 components. These are quite small compared
with typical chalcopyrite semiconductors such as ZnGeP2, which are of order
100 pm/V (3). This is not surprising, because χ(2) scales like E−3
g . Thus, wide
band-gap materials are not expected to exhibit large χ(2). Nevertheless, these
are even smaller than those in GaN by an order of magnitude. Limpijumnong
et al. (52) thus concluded that ZnGeN2 is not particularly suitable as non-linear
optical material.
Recently, the static values of the second harmonic generation coeﬃcient
were recalculated by Paudel and Lambrecht (59), using the Berry phase DFPT
approach. The second-order susceptibilities, χ(2)
αβγ = ∂3U/∂Eα∂Eβ∂Eγ, can in-
deed be viewed as a third-order derivative. Their values are signiﬁcantly higher
than Limpijumnong’s, and are reasonably close to those of GaN, as shown in
Table 15.19.
The values for AlN and GaN were calculated by Chen et al. (109), using a
diﬀerent approach but also including local ﬁeld-eﬀects. The values by Rashkeev
et al. (112), which do not include local ﬁeld-eﬀects, are almost a factor 2 smaller.
Even so, it appears that the results by Limpijumnong et al. (52) are signiﬁcantly
in error. This may be related to the errors noted previously on the polarization
dependence. There appear to be some ambiguities about the sign of the χ(2) for
AlN. We note that the sign of χ(2) depends on how one chooses the polarity
of the axes pointing from N to Al or from Al to N along the bonds, and these
details are not fully speciﬁed in all previous work.
Overall, the second harmonic generation coeﬃcient χ(2)
33 appear to be similar
in magnitude to those of the group-III nitrides, and increase from ZnSiN2 to
ZnGeN2 to ZnSnN2 as the gaps decrease.

Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
The ratio χ(2)
31 /χ(2)
33 ≈−1/2 is expected on the basis of the relation between
zincblende and wurtzite. Furthermore, one expects χ(2)
31 ≈χ(2)
32 based on the rela-
tion between the orthorhombic ZnGeN2 structure and wurtzite. The actual ratios
χ(2)
31 /χ(2)
33 are −0.39, −0.38, and −0.10 for ZnSiN2, ZnGeN2, and ZnSnN2 respect-
ively. The χ(2)
32 /χ(2)
33 ratios are −0.37, −0.45, and −0.31. Thus the structural
deviations of the orthorhombic from wurtzite and non-ideal wurtzite relative to
cubic material signiﬁcantly aﬀect these ratios.
Another non-linear eﬀect considered by Paudel et al. (59) is the electro-optic
eﬀect of Pockel’s eﬀect. This gives the change in index of refraction induced by
a static electric ﬁeld. More speciﬁcally, it is deﬁned by the change in the inverse
dielectric constant at optical frequencies by a low-freqency electric ﬁeld. It is
deﬁned by
Δ(ε−1)αβ = rαβλEλ
(15.54)
in which we use summation convention as usual, but additionally, use indices
λ for the static ﬁeld and α, β for the optic-frequency electric ﬁelds. Depending
on the mechanical boundary conditions, it may contain three contributions: a
purely electronic one, which is directly related to the non-linear optic coeﬃcient,
an ionic contribution, and a piezoelectric contribution. These are respectively

indirect eﬀect of the strain on the internal coordinates, which in turn aﬀect the
electronic susceptibility. Strictly speaking, the energy here should be replaced
by the electrical enthalpy in the presence of a ﬁnite electric ﬁeld. For details, we
refer the reader to Veithen et al. (113). The “clamped” value refers to the value
measured under strain-free conditions, and includes the electronic and ionic con-
tribution but not the piezoelectric contribution. In practice, this means that it
corresponds to electric ﬁelds oscillating above about 100 MHz, so that the ions
can relax (low compared to the phonon frequencies), but high enough that the
crystal shape does not have time to relax to the electric ﬁeld via the converse
piezoelectric eﬀect. The “unclamped” value refers to the value measured un-
der stress-free conditions, and includes the additional piezoelectric contribution
arising from the changes in the unit cell shape in response to the electric ﬁeld.
In practice, this is below 1 MHz. The values for the clamped and unclamped
electro-optic tensor are given in Table 15.20.
No experimental data on these coeﬃcients are available in Zn-IV-N2 or III-N
materials, to the best of our knowledge. They have not even been determined
for the group-III nitrides.
15.10
Defects
Very little is known about the defect physics in II-IV-N2 compounds. Here we
present merely some speculative ideas based on comparison with ZnGeP2 and
general intuition.
From a basic perspective there is a richer variety of defects than in group-III
nitrides. On general grounds one may expect cation vacancies of two types VII
and VIV to have diﬀerent properties. One might expect cation antisites such as
IIIV and IVII. Based on electron and state counting rules, one might expect a
VII to be a double acceptor and VIV to be a quadruple acceptor. In a II-IV-N2
material, one may think of the N bonding to a group-II to share 3/2 of its
electrons in the II-N bond, while a N bonding to a Ge to share 1 electron in
a IV-N bond. Since each N is surrounded by two II and two IV elements, this

576
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
amounts to 3 + 2 = 5 electrons per N. The group-IV element shares 1 electron in
each bond, and the group-II shares 1/2 an electron. Now consider a VII. The four
N-dangling bonds surrounding it will contain each 3/2 electron, or six electrons
in total. The dangling bonds in a tetrahedral environment form an a1 level and
a t2 level. Usually, the a1 level lies below the VBM, and it will take the two
electrons. The t2 level lies in the gap and will take four electrons, so it has
room for two more or will be a double acceptor. One may expect a Jahn–Teller
distortion to D2d, and hence a splitting of the t2 into a1 and e. If the a1 level
lies lowest and possibly also below the VBM, the e level is still only half ﬁlled
and may be expected to split further to Cs symmetry. If the e-level is lowest,
one expects an a1 empty level in the gap.
For a group-IV vacancy the level splittings are expected to be similar, but
now there are only four electrons in total in the dangling bonds, so one has in
principle a quadruple acceptor. Whether all four charge states are allowed in the
gap is unclear without explicit calculations. In ZnGeP2 one ﬁnds that the VGe is
unstable toward (14)
VGe →ZnGe + VZn
(15.58)
In other words, a nearby Zn, hops into the Ge vacancy and creates a ZnGe antisite
VZn complex (114). The VZn in this case is found to be the dominant defect in as-
grown crystals because of the high vapor pressure of Zn. Both the VZn and ZnGe
are acceptors. Thus, if Zn-IV-N2 behave somewhat like chalcopyrites, one may
expect acceptor-type defects to be more prominent than in GaN. In contrast,
in GaN the VGa is the highest energy of formation-defect, except in very n-type
material (115).
The nitrogen vacancy VN is nominally a triple donor, because removing a N
atom removes eight states and only ﬁve electrons. N-vacancies were long thought
to be responsible for a residual n-type doping in GaN, until it was found by cal-
culations that the VN has actually a fairly deep defect level. In GaN, it was
ultimately found that either O-impurities or SiGa impurities were responsible
for the n-type background. In Zn-IV-N2 materials, Si impurities (arising, for
example, from the quartz of the vapor growth chamber) would be isovalent im-
purities and would not dope the material. So, overall, it appears somewhat more
promising to achieve p-type doping in II-IV-N2 materials. On the other hand,
GeZn antisites have been observed in ZnGeP2, and form donor levels. So, Ge-rich
material might be n-type if GeZn antisites have a lower energy of formation than
VZn defects. This is not the case in ZnGeP2, but remains to be seen in ZnGeN2.
Next, let us consider doping opportunities. To make p-type material, one has
two natural choices: group-I elements on group-II site, or group-III elements on
the group-IV site. The former is tricky, because Cu in ZnO, for example, tends
to give deep levels (in part because of the much higher lying 3d levels), and
group-I elements from the Ia column of the periodic table, such as Li, Na, tend
to diﬀuse easily because of their small ionic radius. For group-III elements the
crucial question is the site selectivity. If the group-III goes on a group-II site it

577
is expected to behave as a donor; if it goes on the group-IV site it is expected
to behave as an acceptor. One might try to inﬂuence the site selectivity by
controlling the stoichiometry or chemical potentials. To promote Ga to go on
the Ge site, for example, one would grow Ge-poor material. On the other hand,
Ge-poor material will likely promote ZnGe antisites, which are also acceptors. So,
instead of inducing compensating donors one would expect additional acceptors
to form. Which of these levels are deep or shallow remains to be seen by actual
calculations. Also, the actual energies of formation need to be calculated carefully
as a function of chemical potential. Still, the outlook is promising for achieving
p-type material. Nonetheless, the only measurements of background doping in
ZnGeN2 were indicative of n-type doping. Whether this is due to N-vacancies
or O-impurities or other contamination is presently not known. It is also not
known a priori what the role of interstitials might be in the case of deviations
from stoichiometry.
From an eﬀective-mass-approximation (EMA) point of view, the similar
inverse-eﬀective-mass parameters, as in GaN but signiﬁcantly larger crystal ﬁeld
splitting, predicts that the shallow impurity levels would be somewhat deeper
than in GaN.
15.11
Outlook
At this point in time, a signiﬁcant amount of fundamental properties of the II-
IV-N2 materials have been predicted, and some of them have been conﬁrmed
by experiment. There is still a large amount of work to be done to explore the
full richness of the whole class of materials. From a general perspective they
present equally promising properties for optoelectronics as did the III-N materi-
als half a century ago. Of course, for their further development it will be crucial
that more people start working on them. At present, the III-nitrides are much
farther along and are a ﬁerce competitor to the II-IV-N2 nitrides because, inev-
itably the latter will lag behind. Some speciﬁc advantages and opportunities for
the II-IV-N2 start emerging, which we hope will encourage researchers to pur-
sue them further. First, they present a richer variety of well-deﬁned, strain-free
thermodynamically stable compounds. We have already identiﬁed CdGeN2 as a
material with a predicted gap corresponding to green light emission. This is a
valuable opportunity, given the technical diﬃculties in pushing toward green in
the InxGa1−xN system. Second, we have found that the materials exhibit smaller
diﬀerences in spontaneous polarization among each other than in the group-III
nitrides. Their piezoelectric tensors are similar, and thus the smaller lattice con-
stant diﬀerences also generally will lead to smaller strain-induced polarization
ﬁelds at heterojunctions. Their lower symmetry may create additional oppor-
tunities for polarization-sensitive detectors and other niche applications. Last,
and most importantly, but at this point purely speculatively, they may well ﬁnd
their greatest beneﬁts compared to the III-N in a diﬀerent point-defect physics,
which looks promising for more easy p-type doping. We consider that if more

578
Heterovalent ternary II-IV-N2 compounds
researchers become interested in these materials, they may have a bright future.
Our hope is that this chapter will be a step in that direction.

Terahertz emission in polaritonic systems
with nitrides

and Alexey V. Kavokin
16.1
Introduction
The problem of creation of an eﬃcient THz source is of high importance in
modern physics and technology. High-power emitters with frequency tunable in
the terahertz range are required for applications in information communication
technologies, medicine, and security. However, while for optical spectrum and
radio-wave frequencies there are numerous eﬃcient sources of radiation, the THz
range of spectrum remains the least explored. None of the existing THz emitters
universally satisﬁes the application requirements. The problem is challenging,
since the eﬃciency of semiconductor THz sources is limited due to the short
life-time of involved electronic states (typically, fractions of a nanosecond) com-
pared to a long typical time of spontaneous emission of a THz photon (typically
milliseconds).
The existing terahertz sources are based on various operation principles (1).
The standard solid-state oscillators such as the Gunn diode or tunnelling diode
are restricted only to generation in the lower boundary of the THz frequency
window. The group of emitters based on the free electron lasers are bulky, and
cannot be integrated easily in the optoelectronic schemes. Finally, the semicon-
ductor sources of THz radiation are represented by several groups of emitters.
First, exploiting the intersubband transition of the quantum well, together with
electron tunnelling through the structure, one can realize quantum cascade lasers
(QCL) (2). In such waveguide structures one can achieve comparably high out-
put power (up to 50 mW), but overall eﬃciency remains low due to the small
spontaneous emission rate. Another drawback of the system is the ultra-low op-
erating temperature of the device, and current research is focused on its raise.
Alternatively, the semiconductor THz emission source can be done using down-
shift optical to THz range conversion. This can be realized if a semiconductor
with a large diﬀerence of electron and hole mobility is illuminated by a short
laser pulse. The resultant density oscillations with THz frequency last for a few
periods, and lead to classical dipole emission. However, the power of such an
emitter is limited to nanowatt range and can not be easily tuned.
In the following section we review diﬀerent mechanisms which were proposed
for THz emission generation using cavity polaritons, and discuss their advantages

over previous schemes. First, we present a broad introduction of the physics
of excitons in semiconductor materials. Then, we introduce strong-light matter
coupling and discuss properties of emergent polaritonic states. Next, we describe
currently existing proposals of THz emitters based on polaritons. Finally, we con-
clude that realization of presented proposals with nitrides will lead to a signiﬁcant
step towards realization of eﬃcient room-temperature THz sources, including
lasers.
16.1.1
Excitons
An important property of a semiconductor material is its optical absorption spec-
trum. It contains the information about energy-band structure, the quality of the
structure (impurities), and collective excitations in the system. At room temper-
ature the optical properties of material are dominated by interband absorption
due to optical excitation of the electron from valence into conduction band. The
behavior of the system in this case depends drastically on the dimensionality of
the system, and is governed by the density of states. However, with the lowering
of the temperature of the system, many-body eﬀects come into play and alter
the absorption spectrum of the material.
In most semiconductors at low temperature the formation of excitons—bound
electron-hole pairs—takes place. An exciton represents a solid-state analog of a
hydrogen atom. If the electron–hole interaction is not screened, a tightly-bound
Frenkel exciton state is formed. It has a radius of the order of the lattice constant,
and large binding energy in the range 0.1–1 eV. However, this type of exciton is
usually absent in typical solid-semiconductor materials, and is important mostly
in organic structures. In the case of screened interaction, another type of exciton
appears. It has a radius of order of tens lattice constants with typically small
binding energy (0.01 eV), and is referred to as Wannier–Mott exciton (3).
Wannier–Mott excitons can be described conveniently using eﬀective-mass
approximation. The Hamiltonian of such a two-body problem is written as
ˆH = ˆHe + ˆHh + Veh(r) = −ℏ2
2me
△e −ℏ2
2mh
△h −
e2
4πϵϵ0|re −rh|,
(16.1)
which consists of kinetic energy operators for an electron and a hole, where
me,h denotes the mass of electron and hole, respectively, and △denotes the
Laplace operator. ϵ and ϵ0 correspond to the dielectric permittivity of medium
and vacuum. The last term in (16.1) represents an attractive Coulomb inter-
action between particles, and leads to the formation of the bound state. It
depends on the relative distance between an electron and a hole, r = |re −rh|.
The Hamiltonian can be rewritten in the center-of-mass (CM) coordinates, with
a separation of CM and relative motion of carriers. The problem can be solved
similarly to the hydrogen-atom case, and consequent minimization of the energy
(16.1) gives the spectrum of the exciton. It has the structure of absorption lines
corresponding to ground state 1s, ﬁrst excited 2s and 2p states, and states of
higher order. The binding energy Eb of the ground-state exciton, which is given

by the symmetric wavefunction and exciton Bohr radius aB, is written as (in the
3D case) (4):
E3D
b
=
e4μ
8h2ϵ2
0ϵ2 , a3D
B = h2ϵϵ0
μπe2 ,
(16.2)
where μ = memh/(me + mh) is reduced exciton mass, and h is the Planck con-
stant. Similar calculation in the two-dimensional (2D) case gives the exciton
parameters in the form E2D
b
= 4E3D
b
and a2D
B = a3D
B /2. The excited states are
separated from 1s by the energy ΔE = 8E2D
B /9 (2D).
Let us consider the properties of an exciton in a two-dimensional quantum
well (QW). The corresponding wavefunctions of 1s, 2s, and 2p states read (in
the 2D case) (4):
ψ1s(r) =

2
π
1
aB
exp(−r/aB)
(16.3)
ψ2s(r) =

4
3π
1
aB
	
1 −2r
3aB

exp(−r/3aB)
(16.4)
ψ2p(r, φ) =

4
3π
r
(3aB)2 exp(−r/3aB) exp(±iφ)
(16.5)
where we denote aB ≡a2D
B
and use polar coordinates (r, φ).
One can note that 1s and 2p states have diﬀerent parity. The symmetry of the
wavefunction of a 2p exciton state does not allow its direct optical excitation with
a single photon, and the 2p state is usually referred to as a dark exciton. However,
it can be created using two-photon absorption. Additionally, one can see that
while 2s–1s optical transition is forbidden, the radiative transition between 2p
and 1s excitonic states is allowed in the xy polarization plane. These will be
important for further consideration of the 2p–1s THz generation proposal.
Another type of exciton appears if it is formed not by a ground-state electron–
hole pair, but with a hole situated in the second quantization subband (e1hh2).
The spontaneous emission rate of such an exciton is greatly reduced, but it can
radiatively decay to a ground-state exciton e1hh1. This transition is allowed due
to the diﬀerent parity of envelope functions in the growth direction, and results
in the emission of a photon with z polarization.
Next, let us discuss the spin properties of an exciton. An exciton is a com-
posite boson with a spin deﬁned by the spin of an electron (e) and a hole (h).
Typically, in semiconductors one has to distinguish light-hole (lh) and heavy-
hole (hh) states, which have spin Slh = ±1/2 and Shh = ±2, respectively. In
most semiconductor nanostructures the main role is played by e–hh exciton. It
has four possible spin projections: +1, −1, +2, and −2. An important issue is
the optical selection rules of the system, which deﬁne both the quasiparticle life-
time and the possibility of eﬃcient observation of the excitons. In particular, if
the total spin projection of the exciton is not unity, it is not possible to excite

the exciton with absorption of a single photon. This comes from the fact that
angular momentum should be conserved. Simultaneously, radiative transitions
between ±2 and ±1 spin states are forbidden, since they have the same parity.
Therefore, excitons with spin ±2 correspond to dark excitons, due to reduced
interaction with light. Their energy usually is slightly detuned from the bright
exciton resonance. However, under certain conditions they can still play some
role in the physics of excitons; for instance, if spin–orbit interaction is taken into
account.
Formation of the exciton results in the appearance of narrow absorption peaks
lying below the interband continuum, with the energy distance given by the
binding energy of the exciton. Due to the large oscillator strength of excitonic
transition it represents an important mechanism of absorption at low temperat-
ures. The critical temperature of exciton dissociation is deﬁned by the value of
the binding energy. While for narrow and medium band-gap semiconductors it
is typically low (up to 100 K in GaAs), in wide band-gap semiconductors such
as GaN or ZnO, excitons can survive at room temperature. This is extremely
important for the successful realization of devices based on the optics of excitons.
An important issue connected to the existence of excitons is excitation condi-
tions. In particular, they exist only in the low-intensity excitation regime where
the density of photo-generated electrons and holes is low. If the density of elec-
trons and holes exceeds the critical value, called the Mott density, the system
drives into the electron–hole plasma regime, where formation of excitons is sup-
pressed. Moreover, previously we discussed that excitons have integer spin and
thus are composite bosons. The validity of the application of bosonic statistics is
deﬁned by the density of electrons and holes, and the corresponding condition is

B ≪1
(16.6)
where n is the concentration, aB is a Bohr radius of the exciton corresponding to
its size in the real space, and D is a dimensionality of the system (D = 1, 2, 3).
The properties of exciton gas depend strongly on the interactions between
the excitons. Formally, the problem of exciton interaction could be solved as a
two-body interaction with four possible processes (5): direct Coulomb interac-
tion between electrons and holes, exchange of electrons between excitons, hole
exchange, and simultaneous electron and hole exchange. Since an exciton is a di-
pole, one expects that the interaction between excitons is short-range. Moreover,
the conventional direct exciton does not have a dipole moment pointing in a single
direction, and the resultant interaction will be not dipole–dipole. It was shown
that direct interaction between excitons is zero for small exchanged momenta,
and that the main contribution for short-range point-like interaction comes from
electron and hole exchange. Finally, in terms of exciton parameters, it reads

where A denotes the area of the sample. However, one should note that similarly
to 2D Fourier transform of Coulomb interaction, area does not enter into the
equations as an independent parameter. Finally, the exchange nature of interac-
tion leads to the spin-anisotropy of excitons. In particular, this question will be
important in the case of polaritons, where spin-singlet interaction is suppressed
by one order of magnitude, compared to triplet interaction.
The bosonic statistics of excitons, together with eﬃcient exciton–exciton in-
teractions, make them a solid-state candidate for observation of Bose–Einstein
condensation. It was prescribed theoretically by Keldysh and Kozlov more than
ﬁfty years ago (7) and since then has became a holy grail for experimentalists.
The eﬀective mass of the excitons is about ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than
those of cold atoms, which shifts the critical temperature of BEC from nano-
Kelvins to about 1 K. This represents a major step forward, but still does not
allow any technological implementation of the eﬀect. However, the condensa-
tion of excitons in the semiconductor structure has not yet been observed. This
fact is connected to the high requirements of the quality of the sample set by
the coherence length. The breakthrough was made by combining excitons with
photons, which leads to the formation of hybrid quasiparticles known as exciton
polaritons, which are considered in the next section.
16.1.2
Exciton-polaritons
New horizons for bringing quantum collective phenomena into device applications
were opened in the ﬁeld of quantum microcavities which lies at the intersection
of condensed-matter physics and optics (8).
A semiconductor microcavity is a photonic microstructure designed to en-
hance light–matter interaction (see Fig. 16.1). The cavity photons are conﬁned
between two mirrors, and resonantly interact with the excitonic transition of
a semiconductor quantum well or a quantum dot (QD), which makes possible
the achievement of the strong coupling regime, where the elementary excita-
tions, cavity polaritons, have a hybrid half–light half–matter nature. In planar
cavities with embedded quantum wells, polaritons are two–dimensional bosonic

trical Bragg mirrors (DBR), which conﬁne the photonic mode. In the action
region it couples to the excitons due to the strong light–matter interaction.
In the present case, the active structure is a quantum well (QW).

(16.8)
where the operators b†
k, bk, a†
k, ak are creation and annihilation operators for
excitons and photons with in-plane momenta k. We suppose that condition (16.6)
is satisﬁed, and both excitonic and photonic operators obey the rules of bosonic
algebra. The ﬁrst and second terms correspond to free excitons and photons,
with EX(k), EC(k) being the dispersions of the free excitons and photons, for
which eﬀective-mass approximation can be normally used:
EX,C(k) =
ℏ2k2
2mX,C
+ EX,C(0),
(16.9)
with mX,C being the eﬀective masses of the exciton and cavity photon, respect-
ively, and EX,C(0) being energies of the modes at k = 0 point. Finally, the third
term in (16.8) corresponds to the light–matter interaction, which is given by the
exciton–photon coupling constant, VR/2.
The non-zero eﬀective mass of the cavity photon comes from the conﬁnement
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the cavity growth direction z, and can be estimated
as
mC = ℏnckz
c
(16.10)
where nc is a refractive index of the cavity, kz = 2πncN/L is the photon
wavevector in the cavity growth direction, L is an eﬀective cavity length, and
integer N is a number of the cavity mode. In realistic cavities, an eﬀective mass
of a photon estimated by this formula is extremely small, and normally lies in
the range 10−4−10−5 of the mass of free electron me, while the eﬀective mass of
the exciton is of the same order as me. Thus, if the value of the detuning para-
meter Δ = EC(0) −EX(0) is negative, the dispersion curves of the free excitons
and photons cross at the point k0 = 2Δ(mX −mC)/ℏ2mXmC, while for positive
detuning the photon dispersion lies everywhere above the exciton one.
The third term in eq. (16.8) corresponding to a coupling between photons and
excitons is described by the constant VR, which is determined by the parameters
of the microcavity (9):

plane momentum, and factor I ≤1 is determined by the geometry of the QW

with excitonic resonance. One should note that the coupling constant VR(k) is a
weak function of momentum at small in-plane polariton momenta k ≪kz, and
EX is almost constant.
The Hamiltonian (16.8) can be diagonalized easily by a linear transformation
of the operators (10):
pL,k = CL,kak + XL,kbk
(16.12)
pU,k = CU,kak + XU,kbk

Operators (16.12) and (16.13) describe the upper and lower polariton—new
eigenmodes of the coupled QW-cavity system. According to the above expression,
a polariton is a composite particle containing photonic and excitonic fractions.
The percentage of these fractions is given by the square of Hopﬁeld coeﬃcients
CU,L, XU,L, which can be determined as

The coupling between photonic and excitonic modes in the sample with neg-
ative detuning leads to the phenomenon of the anti-crossing of the polariton
branches: at the point corresponding to k0 they do not cross as dispersions of
bare excitons and photons, but are separated by distance VR, corresponding to
the Rabi splitting in the system. It should be noted that in realistic samples,
where excitons and cavity photons have a ﬁnite lifetime, their energies can be
considered as complex functions with imaginary parts describing their decay,
EX,C = EX,C + ℏ2k2/2mX,C −iγX,C. In this case, expression (16.15) also be-
come complex. Their real parts correspond to dispersions of polariton modes,
while imaginary parts give polariton lifetimes. The Rabi splitting in this case is
determined as a distance between the real parts of the polariton states in the
anti-crossing point:

Introduction

The transition to the strong coupling regime when exciton and photon damp-
ing is overcome by their coherent interaction and anti-crossing is observed, is thus
given by the condition
V 2
R > (γX −γC)2
(16.19)
The plot in Fig. 16.2 shows dispersion of upper and lower polaritons in the
strong coupling regime in GaAs microcavity. One can note the following. First,
the eﬀective mass of the lower polariton has the same order of magnitude as the
eﬀective mass of the cavity photon. Second, the dispersion curve of the lower po-
laritons is highly non-parabolic, and has an inﬂection point in the anti-crossing
region. Both these facts have important consequences, which we consider in the
next section, and make quantum microcavities in a strong coupling regime a
unique laboratory for the implementation of quantum collective phenomena for
the design of optoelectronic devices of the new generation (11). In particular, dif-
ferently from the case of bare excitons, the formation of polariton Bose–Einstein
condensate (12, 13) and onset of superﬂuidity (16) were reported experimentally.
Due to the fact that Rabi splitting depends on the exciton properties, the ma-
terial properties play an important role in light–matter coupling. For instance,
it was shown that in large band-gap semiconductors GaN and ZnO the binding
energy of excitons is several times higher than in the conventional GaAs case.
This leads to the large Rabi splitting in nitride materials and the strongest light–
matter coupling over other semiconductor systems (15). Therefore, accounting

16.2
Polariton-based terahertz emitters
In the previous section we introduced the phenomenon of strong coupling bet-
ween a microcavity photon and exciton in a solid, and discussed its possible
applications. Recently, the diﬀerent polariton systems were proposed as an ef-
fective radiation emitters in the terahertz (THz) range of frequency. Here we
overview currently proposed schemes and compare them with existing THz emit-
ters. The basic idea is that the possibility of the polariton BEC opens a way for
drastic enhancement of the rate of the THz emission due to the eﬀects of the
ﬁnal-state bosonic stimulation.
16.2.1
Upper-to-lower polariton transition
The distance between upper and lower polariton lies in the range of milielec-
tronvolts, and can be changed with the material and quality of the resonator.
If the scattering from the upper to lower polariton branch was accompanied by
emission of THz photons, polariton lasers would emit THz radiation, and this
emission would be stimulated by the population of the lowest-energy polariton
state. However, at ﬁrst glance this process is forbidden: an optical dipole oper-
ator cannot directly couple the polariton states formed by the same exciton state.
Once it is overcome, the polariton system allows for generation of THz radiation
with quantum eﬃciency, which can be tuned to a great extent by means of the
optical pumping.
The transition between upper and lower polariton modes is allowed if one
of the polariton states of interest is mixed with an exciton state of a diﬀerent
parity; for instance, the e1hh2 exciton state formed by an electron at the lowest
energy level in a quantum well (QW) and a heavy hole at the second energy level
in the QW. This state typically lies a few meV above the exciton ground state
e1hh1. By a proper choice of the QW width and exciton–photon detuning in
the microcavity, it can be brought into resonance with the lowest-energy upper
polariton state. Being resonant, the two states can be easily hybridized by any
weak perturbation, such as a built-in or external electric ﬁeld. Therefore, the
optical transition between such a hybridized state and the lowest e1hh1 exciton
polariton state becomes allowed.
The geometry of the system considered in the original proposal is shown
in Fig. 16.3 (17). It represents a QW with excitons embedded in a planar mi-
crocavity in the strong coupling regime. Additionally, this system can be placed
inside a THz cavity, which enhances the rate of the emission of the THz photons.
Together with the waveguiding eﬀect of microcavity structure, adding the lateral
THz cavity aims for an eﬀective three-dimensional conﬁnement of the THz mode,
leading to enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate via the Purcell eﬀect

dark exciton, and cavity photon states is written as
&H =

Here, E1X, E2X, and EC are the energies of bright and dark excitons and the
cavity photon mode respectively. The oﬀ-diagonal element ℏΩR denotes Rabi
splitting of bright exciton and cavity photon coupling, and δ is a parameter
describing the mixture between bright and dark exciton states due to the electric
ﬁeld ε normal to the QW plane, δ ≈eε
 +∞
−∞uhh1(z)zuhh2(z)dz, with uhh1(z) and
uhh2(z) being the conﬁned wavefunctions of the ground and ﬁrst excited states of
the heavy hole in a QW. One can easily estimate that in order to have δϵ larger
than the upper polariton linewidth, which is typically of the order of 0.1 meV,
it is enough to apply an electric (piezoelectric) ﬁeld of 3 kV/cm in a quantum
well with a width of 10 nm.
The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (16.20) permits the ﬁnding of new
eigenenergies and eigenstates of the system. The scheme in Fig. 16.4 shows the
spectrum of the system with sketched processes which occur in the system.
In particular, for the case of |E1X −E2X −ℏΩR/2| ≪ℏΩR and zero detuning
between bright exciton and photon modes (E1X = EC = E1), the eigenstates can
be written as

Therefore, together with the lower polariton mode L, two upper branches U+
and U−are formed due to the mixture between the bright upper polariton
|U⟩= (|1X⟩−|C⟩)/2 and the dark exciton |2X⟩. One should note that if δ ̸= 0,
both upper polariton eigenstates |U−⟩and |U+⟩contain fractions of the bright
exciton and photon and of the dark exciton. This allows the radiative trans-
ition between the states |U±⟩and the lower polariton state |L⟩accompanied
by emission of the THz photon and their direct optical excitation. The rate of
the spontaneous emission of THz radiation can be estimated from the Planck
formula:

by a factor of √Q within the frequency band Δω ≈ω0/Q around the cavity
resonance frequency ω0, where Q is the quality factor of the cavity. In the case
of a narrow spectral width of the electronic oscillator coupled to the cavity, this
results in the Purcell formula (18):

(16.27)
where Q is a quality factor of the cavity, Veff is an eﬀective cavity volume, and
λc is the working wavelength. The equation can be written in a simpliﬁed way
using a dimensionless geometric factor ξ (ξ ≈1 for V ≈(λc/2)3). In our case,
the electronic resonance is broadened due to short lifetimes of the initial (U±)
and ﬁnal (L) states. Applying the Fermi golden rule to the cavity tuned in res-
onance with a transition between homogeneously broadened levels characterized
by lifetimes τi and τf, one obtains the following generalization of the Purcell
formula:
FP = ξ

Q−1 + (ω0τi)−1 + (ω0τf)−1−1
(16.28)
Estimates show that for lifetimes of the electronic states of the order of 10 ps, FP
cannot be made much larger than approximately 50, however high Q might be.
Finally, above, we described the system of coupled-bright-exciton, dark-
exciton, and cavity-photon modes. The simple model allows one to estimate the
rate of spontaneous THz photon emission due to upper polariton to lower po-
lariton transition. However, to describe the dynamics of the system one needs to
account properly for interaction between polaritons, acoustic phonon relaxation
mechanisms, and coherent polariton–THz photon interaction.
Dynamics of the system. The model Hamiltonian (16.20) can be rewritten in
the second quantization formalism, and generalized for accounting for interac-

It is well known that strong polariton–polariton interactions in microcavities
yield observations of pronounced non-linear eﬀects for the intensities of the pump
orders of magnitude smaller than in other non-linear optical systems. Among
them are polariton superﬂuidity (14), bistability and multistability (20, 21),

where we introduced the rates of acoustic phonon-assisted transitions τUR,LR
between the upper/lower polariton modes and the reservoir, which are inversely
proportional to the W1,2 matrix elements. Here, W is a rate of THz emission
given by eq. (16.25) for a three coupled oscillator Hamiltonian, and is similar
to the VT /ℏmatrix element. Thus, for resonantly optically excited hybridized
upper states |U⟩, polaritons relax to the lower polariton states, either directly,
emitting THz photons, or via a cascade of k ̸= 0 states of the lower polariton
mode (acoustic phonon-assisted relaxation).
In the stationary regime the occupation number of the THz mode can be
found from the solution of the above set of equations, putting ∂tnU = ∂tnL =
∂tn = ∂tnR = 0.
Figure 16.6 shows the dependence of the quantum eﬃciency parameter
β = n/Pτ on the pumping rate P. The parameters used in the calcula-
tion are τU = τL = 20 ps, τR = 100 ps, τUR = τLR = 10 ps, τ/Q = 10 ps, and
W/Fp = W0 = 10−9 ps−1. One can see that for the realistic choice of parameters
corresponding to the existing polariton lasers, the quantum eﬃciency achieves
β = 1 −1.5%. Note that the mechanism of THz emission considered here is qual-
itatively diﬀerent from the one used in quantum cascade lasers embedded in
THz cavities. Eﬀectively, here the THz emission is stimulated by the population
of the lowest-energy polariton state, which provides quite high quantum eﬃ-
ciency compared with the best commercially available quantum cascade lasers.
Semiconductor microcavities in the regime of polariton lasing may be used as
eﬃcient sources of THz radiation, having a quantum eﬃciency exceeding 1%,
according to estimates.
Full quantum dynamics. Second, we describe the situation where all interac-
tions and coherence in the system should be taken into account. In (19) it was
shown that for the interactions between polaritons present in the system, new
qualitative eﬀects appear.
An important consequence of polariton–polariton interaction is emergence
blueshift, which modiﬁes energies of the upper and lower polariton states. The
renormalized energies read

Due to the diﬀerence of the Hopﬁeld coeﬃcients for the upper and lower polariton
states, the diﬀerence ˜ϵU −˜ϵL depends on the polariton concentrations, and thus is
determined by the intensity of the pump P. This dependence can have important
consequences, allowing for the onset of bistability in the system.
The calculation of dynamics of the system corresponding to eqs. (16.36)–
(16.40) was performed in (19). Authors considered a planar GaAs microcavity
in a strong coupling regime, with Rabi splitting ΩR between upper and lower
polariton modes equal to 16 meV (≈4 THz), which was embedded into THz
cavity with an eigenfrequency slightly diﬀerent from ΩR, and having a quality
factor Q = 100. The initial state was assumed to be unpopulated. When the
constant non-resonant pump of the upper polariton state is switched on, the
number of THz photons n starts to increase until it reaches some equilibrium
level deﬁned by the radiative decay of polaritons and escape of THz radiation
from the cavity, as shown in Fig. 16.7.

ure for diﬀerent pumps: 4500 ps−1 (curve 1), 5000 ps−1 (curve 2), 5500 ps−1
(curve 3) and 6000 ps−1 (curve 4). The reservoir consists of N = 3 · 105
identical particles. The inset shows evolution of the THz photons num-
ber for the constant pump P = 6 · 103 ps−1 for diﬀerent temperatures: 1 K
(curve 1i), 10 K (curve 2i) and 20 K (curve 3i).
The equilibrium value of the THz population n as a function of pump-
ing P demonstrates threshold-like behavior. For suﬃciently high temperatures,
the THz photon occupation number depends weakly on the pump in the sub-
threshold region. When pumping reaches the certain threshold value, polariton
condensate is formed in the lower polariton state, and radiative THz transition
is ampliﬁed by bosonic stimulation. Thus, the occupancy of the THz mode in-
creases superlinearly together with the occupancy of lower the polariton state nL
(Fig. 16.7, curve 3). This behavior is qualitatively the same as in the approach
operating with semiclassical Boltzmann equations. However, the decrease of tem-
perature leads to the onset of the bistability and hysteresis in the dependence
n(P). The bistable jump occurs when the intensity of the pump tunes ˜ϵU −˜ϵL
into the resonance with the cavity mode ϵT . The parameters of the hysteresis
loop strongly depend on the temperature (Fig. 16.8). It is very pronounced and
broad for low temperatures, narrows with an increase in the temperature, and
disappears completely at T ≈20 K.
The coherent nature of the interaction between excitons and THz photons
makes possible the periodic exchange of energy between polariton and photon
modes and oscillatory dependence of the THz signal in time. Figure 16.8 shows
the temporal evolution of the occupancy of the THz mode after excitation of
the upper polariton state by a short pulse having a duration of about 2 ps. One
can see that the occupancy of the THz mode reveals a sequence of the short

pulses having a duration of dozens of ps with an amplitude decaying in time due
to escape of THz photons from a cavity, and radiative decay of polaritons. The
period of the oscillations is sensitive to the number of the injected polaritons,
N0, and decreases with increasing N0. If the lifetime of the polaritons is less
than the period of the oscillations, single-pulse behaviour can be observed, as
shown in the inset of Fig. 16.9. Appropriate choice of the parameters can lead
ultimately to a generation of THz wavelets composed of one or several THz cycles,
which makes a polariton-THz system suitable for application in short-pulse THz
spectroscopy.
If the system of coupled THz photons and cavity polaritons is in the state
corresponding to the lower branch of the S-shaped curve in the bistability region,
illumination of the system by a short THz pulse I(t) can induce its switching
to the upper branch, as demonstrated in Fig. 16.10. One sees that the response
of the system is qualitatively diﬀerent for diﬀerent values of the pump P. If P
lies outside the bistability region, the application of a THz pulse leads to a short
increase in n, but subsequently the system relaxes to its original state (curves
1 and 3). However, when the system is in the bistability regime, the switching
occurs. The latter eﬀect has quantum origin, and cannot be described using the
set of semiclassical Boltzmann equations (16.41).

THz emission by 2p-exciton to 1s-polariton transition

Terahertz emission in polaritonic systems with nitrides
structures, but is still low due to the much smaller upper polariton lifetime
compared to the THz photon emission rate. The situation can be improved if
the initial state of THz emission is optically dark and therefore has long radiative
lifetime.
The dark 2p exciton state is split from the bright 1s state by several meV.
Usually, it is not populated and is not considered in the strong-coupling case. We
remind that single-photon optical generation of the dark exciton is prohibited
due to angular momentum conservation. It requires absorption of two photons,
and usually such processes are suppressed in the microcavity. However, one can
achieve suﬃcient population of 2p excitons using resonant two-photon pumping
(see Fig. 16.11). Such excitons have a very long radiative lifetime, and can radi-
atively decay to the lower exciton-polariton mode formed by the 1s exciton and
cavity photon. This transition is accompanied by emission of a THz photon. Such
a process was proposed for the construction of an eﬃcient THz emitter based on
2p–1s transition (26). Additionally, macroscopic occupation of the lowest-energy
polariton state leads to stimulation of THz photon emission. Ideally, in the po-
lariton lasing regime, the cavity would emit one THz photon for each optical
photon emitted by the polariton laser. This allows a considerable increase in the
quantum eﬃciency of the THz emitter.

The design of the laser and the involved energy levels are illustrated schem-
atically in Fig. (16.11). This design has two crucial advantages with respect to
that previously considered: it allows for operation with an optically allowed THz
transition, and it provides vertical emission of THz photons. Moreover, due to
the dark nature of the initial state, no waveguides or supplemental THz cavities
are needed, and the structure remains microscopic. This latter point is also a
signiﬁcant advantage with respect to the quantum cascade laser, which operates
in the waveguide geometry.
The dynamics of the system can be studied using the quantum model of the
laser based on the Lindblad master-equation. Written for the density matrix de-
scribing the 2p exciton state, the lower polariton mode, optical and THz photons,
it accounts correctly for both statistics of the particles and their decay.
The model includes coherent processes of 2p excitons and 1s exciton-polariton
interaction with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld, and incoherent interaction
with phonons in a semiconductor microcavity. Therefore, the total Hamiltonian
can be divided into two parts:
H = Hc + Hd
(16.44)
where the part Hc includes all types of coherent processes in our system and
part Hd describes the decoherence in the system due to exciton interactions
with acoustic phonons, modelled as a classical reservoir (24, 25).
The equation for the density matrix is written as
dϱ
dt = i
ℏ[ϱ, Hc] + ˆLϱ
(16.45)
where ˆL denotes the Lindblad superoperator. The incoherent part of the
Hamiltonian can be divided into two parts, Hd = H+ + H−, where H+ cre-
ates an excitation in the quantum system (and thus annihilates an excitation
in the classical reservoir), and H−, conversely, annihilates an excitation in the
quantum system and creates an excitation in the classical reservoir.
The Lindblad terms can be then written as (25)

where δ(ΔE) accounts for energy conservation, and in realistic calculations
should be taken as an average inverse broadening of the states in our system,
δ(ΔE) →ζ−1. In the particular system which we consider, the coherent and
incoherent parts of the Hamiltonian can be written as

and ϵp, ϵs, ϵa and ϵT are the energies of 2p exciton, 1s exciton-polariton, pump

note annihilation operators of the 2p exciton and the lowest-energy 1s polariton
states, a is the annihilation operator for laser photons exciting the 2p exciton
state, and c is an annihilation operator for THz photons produced by the 2p →1s
transition. Constants g and G deﬁne the strengths of the two-photon absorption
and 1s →2p radiative transitions, respectively. They are deﬁned by correspond-
ing dipole matrix elements. The upper polariton state is assumed to lie higher
in energy than the 2p exciton state, and thus can be excluded from consider-
ation. The classical reservoir consists of the photons of the external laser-light
and THz photons. Note that the coherent part of the Hamiltonian (16.47) de-
scribes only the free modes of the system, and thus is irrelevant to the kinetic
equations.

where ⟨...⟩= Tr {...ϱ} denotes averaging with the appropriate density matrix ϱ,
Wg = 4g2/ℏζ, WG = 2G2/ℏζ. The equations for the polariton mode occupancy
Ns = ⟨s†s⟩, and the terahertz mode occupancy Nc = ⟨c†c⟩, are analogous to those
for Np. The occupancy of the pumping mode Na = ⟨a†a⟩is deﬁned by the in-
tensity of the external pump, and an independent dynamic equation for it is not
necessary. The same holds true for the higher-order correlators involving pump
operators, e.g., ⟨a†2a2⟩. It follows from eq. (16.51) that the dynamic equations
for the occupancies of the modes contain quantum correlators of fourth order,
such as ⟨s†sc†c⟩. For them, one can also write the dynamic equations analogous
to eq. (16.51), which would contain correlators of sixth order. Proceeding fur-
ther, one would obtain an inﬁnite chain of coupled equations for the hierarchy
of correlators.
In the easiest form the system of equations for correlators can be solved using
mean-ﬁeld approximation. Therefore, fourth-order correlators are truncated into
the products of second-order ones. One can approximate ⟨p†pa†a⟩≈⟨p†p⟩⟨a†a⟩=

Let us analyze in more detail the kinetic equation for the 2p state occupation
Np. The terms describing incoming and outcoming scattering rates for this state
can be written as
(1 + Np)

a+2a21
−Np

As already mentioned in eq. (16.52), the incoming rate is proportional to
g(2)(0)N 2
a. The outgoing rate can be rewritten as ∝⟨a2(a+)2⟩= g(2)(0)N 2
a +
4Na + 2. Hence, all terms containing N 2
aNp cancel each other, and eq. (16.53)
holds. Note that for processes of non-degenerate two-photon absorption or emis-
sion neglected here, two-photon emission processes where photon frequencies are
diﬀerent can be included in τp, the decay rate of the 2p state. The scattering rates
have the standard form (1 + Np)Na1Na2 −Np(Na1 + 1)(Na2 + 1), independent
of the photon ﬁeld statistics. Therefore, one can assume that Na ≫1, and it is
possible to neglect all other modes.
The key feature of eq. (16.53) is that the pumping term Wgg(2)(0)N 2
a contains
the second-order coherence of the pump, and thus is strongly dependent on its
statistics. For a laser pump corresponding to the coherent state this statistic is
Poissonian, and g(2)(0) = 1. On the other hand, in principle other values of g(2)(0)
are possible. For example, for a thermal pump, g(2)(0) = 2. Diﬀerent values of
the second-order coherence function lead to the diﬀerent lasing thresholds in the
system. In Fig. 16.12, the steady-state solution for Np and Ns is plotted. The
assumption for calculations is that the terahertz mode occupation Nc is zero for
the cases of coherent and thermal pumps. For a qualitative understanding, we

note that the threshold is reached if Ns ∼1, or equivalently when Np ∼1/τsWG,
since this signals the onset of Bose stimulation of the transition from the 2p state
to the 1s lower polariton, accompanied by terahertz emission. The terahertz
generation rate is given by T = WGNp(Ns + 1) ≈1/τsNs, and therefore shows
the same threshold behaviour with pumping intensity as Ns, as can also be seen
in Fig. 16.12. We observe that the threshold is higher in the case of a coherent
pump, which may be understood in terms of the enhanced losses from the 2p
state due to stimulated two-photon emission.
Finally, the proposed mechanism of a 2p −1s terahertz emitter is a prom-
ising tool for the creation of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting terahertz lasers
(Fig. 16.11(b)). For practical realization of compact terahertz lasers operating at
room temperature, microcavities based on wide band-gap semiconductors (GaN
or ZnO) seem to be the most advantageous. The resonant two-photon pumping of
2p exciton states in such a cavity may be assured by a conventional vertical-cavity
light-emitting diode (VCLED) emitting in red. This prospective structure would
consist of a GaN or ZnO microcavity grown on the top of a GaAs-based VCLED
structure. As emission of coherent terahertz light coexists with the polariton las-
ing in the optical frequency range in this scheme, one can use the visible blue or
green light produced by the polariton laser as a marker for the terahertz light-
beam, which may be important for applications in medicine, security control,
and other areas.

16.2.3
Dipolariton THz emission
In the introductory section we discussed several types of exciton. The excitons
of the ﬁrst type, referred to as direct Wannier–Mott excitons, can be created
optically in single quantum wells and be strongly coupled to a microcavity photon
mode. The second type of exciton appears in coupled quantum wells, where
for suﬃciently high electric ﬁelds the pairing between an electron and a hole
located in diﬀerent QWs occurs (27). These are spatially indirect excitons. They
can be cooled to lattice temperature due to their long lifetime, which is why
they are frequently referred to as cold excitons. Radiative lifetimes of indirect
excitons are usually much longer than those of direct excitons due to lower
electron–hole overlap. Another important feature of indirect excitons is their
large dipole moments in the normal to QW plane direction, resulting in strong
exciton–exciton interactions.
Recently, it has been shown that exciton polaritons and spatially indirect
excitons can be intermixed in the biased semiconductor microcavities with em-
bedded coupled QWs (28, 29). In this structure, new quasiparticles, being linear
superposition of cavity photon (C), direct exciton (DX) and indirect exciton (IX),
appear. They form three exciton-polariton modes; namely, the upper polariton
(UP), middle polariton (MP), and lower polariton (LP) modes. Therefore, hy-
brid dipolariton quasiparticles emerge—cavity exciton-polaritons characterized
by large dipole moments.
The dynamics of a three-coupled oscillators system has a rich phenomenology.
In particular, the strong coupling between levels leads to the so-called Rabi
ﬂopping process, where quasiparticle oscillate between two coupled states with
characteristic Rabi frequency. For the tunnel coupling between direct and indirect
excitons it results in coherent oscillation of dipole moment in the system, with
the tunnelling frequency lying in the terahertz frequency range. This leads to
classical radiation of the THz signal by the Hertz dipole array (30). Moreover, due
to the strong coupling of direct exciton with a cavity mode the system exhibits
superradiant behavior (31). Rabi oscillations and consequent THz signal can be
sustained by the cavity for several tens of picoseconds. This strongly improves
the quantum eﬃciency of the emitter.
The considered structure represents two QWs separated by a barrier which is
suﬃciently thin to allow for resonant electron tunneling (Fig. 16.13). The electron
wavefunction is shared between two QWs in this case. The optical microcavity
is tuned to the wider QW exciton resonance (the left QW in Fig. 16.13), while
the right QW remains decoupled from the optical pump. With the pulsed pump
one can create electron–hole pairs which form direct excitons. Furthermore, the
strong light–matter coupling between direct exciton in the left QW and cavity
photon can be achieved. Then, the application of an electric ﬁeld in the growth
direction induces mixing of direct and indirect exciton states, which leads to the
appearance of dipolariton modes.
The system can be described eﬀectively by three coupled oscillators Hamil-
tonian, which successfully describe the behavior of dipolaritons measured

where ℏωC, ℏωDX, and ℏωIX denote cavity mode, direct exciton, and indirect
exciton energies, respectively. The coupling constant between photon and direct
exciton is ℏΩ (Rabi energy), while the tunneling rate corresponding to DX–IX
coupling is ℏJ. The wave-function |Ψ⟩of a dipolariton can be expanded on the
basis of uncoupled states ΨC, ΨDX and ΨIX, being ﬁeld operators for cavity
photon, direct exciton, and indirect exciton, respectively. The evolution of the
|Ψ(t)⟩state after illumination of the sample by a short optical pulse describes a
time-dependent response of the system. To separate the rapidly oscillating part of
dynamics, the rotating frame transformations are used: ΨIX(t) = ψIX(t)e−iωIXt,
ΨDX(t) = ψDX(t)e−iωDXt, and ΨC(t) = ψC(t)e−iωCt (8). In the following, all
modes are assumed to be macroscopically occupied, and ﬁelds ψC,DX,IX are
treated as classical. This allows description of the dynamics of the system by a
closed set of time-dependent Schr¨odinger equations:

where the photonic detuning δΩ = ωC −ωDX for the cavity photon coupled to
the direct exciton, and energy distance between spatially indirect and direct
excitons δJ = ωIX −ωDX, are introduced. The frequency of the resonant optical
pumping P0(t) is detuned from the photon mode by Δ = ωP −ωC (the second
term in the right-hand side of eq. (16.57)). Additionally, the damping rates for
each mode γi = 2π/τi, i = C, DX, IX were taken into account, the lifetimes of
the modes being typically τC ≈3 ps, τDX ≈1 ns, and τIX ≈100 ns.
The numerical calculation of dipolariton system dynamics subjected to a pi-
cosecond pulsed optical pumping was performed by the authors of (30). The
presence of mixing terms between diﬀerent mode implies the oscillating behavior
similar to Rabi ﬂopping in the classical model of a two-level system imposed on a
time-varying ﬁeld. It is important to note that this system has several character-
istic frequencies. They are governed by the exciton–photon coupling strength Ω
and detuning δΩ, the IX-DX coupling strengths J, and detuning δJ. Additionally,
the pumping frequency ωP governs the eﬃciency of the pump. Varying these
characteristic frequencies one can control the frequency, magnitude, and damping
rate of indirect exciton density oscillations.
While the coupling constants Ω and J are dependent on the geometry of the
structure and can hardly be tuned for a given sample, the detunings between
modes δJ and δΩ are strongly sensitive to the applied electric ﬁeld and the
incidence angle of the cavity pump. Tuning of these parameters can bring the
oscillating dipole system to diﬀerent regimes. If the cavity mode is far-detuned
from IX-DX anti-crossing, the light–exciton coupling is weak, which was referred
to as the regime I. If the detuning δΩ is small, the strong intermixing of IX, DX,
and C modes takes place, which corresponds to regime II.
The behavior of the system in regime I is shown in Fig. 16.14a for the de-
tuning δΩ = −10 meV. The antiphase oscillations of IX and DX densities with
decaying amplitudes can be observed. The inset in Fig. 16.14a shows a zoom of
longstanding phase-locked oscillations which last for several tens of picoseconds.
For the electric ﬁeld F approximately equal to the resonant ﬁeld of IX–DX modes
anti-crossing F0, the frequency of oscillations is given by ν ≈J/2π = 1.45 THz.
The time-dependence of the indirect exciton density oscillation can expressed as
nIX(t) = n0
IX cos2(ωt/2)e−t/τ
(16.60)
where ω = 2πν is the frequency of oscillations, and n0
IX denotes the magnitude
of the oscillations, which decrease in time with the damping rate τ −1. Tuning
the electric ﬁeld, the frequency of generated oscillations changes in the range

Fig. 16.14. (a) Dynamics of the dipolariton system subjected to pulsed op-
tical pumping, which shows oscillations of indirect exciton (curve nIX) and
direct exciton (curve nDX) density. The coupling constants are equal to
ℏJ = ℏΩ = 6 meV, and cavity mode is detuned from direct exciton resonance
by δΩ = −10 meV. The pumping frequency is chosen as ℏΔ = 11.5 meV, and
we plot oscillations for the electric ﬁeld F = 0.95F0, where F0 is the ﬁeld
corresponding to IX-DX resonance. The gray area schematically represents

of several THz due to its IX–DX detuning dependence (Fig. 16.14(b)). Other
important parameters of the system, such as the magnitude of oscillations and
dimensionless oscillation quality factor ξ, can be tuned by pumping conditions
as well as by the applied electric ﬁeld. The parameter ξ can be deﬁned as the
ratio of the magnitude to the decrement of oscillations.
Taking δΩ = 2 meV, one can bring the system to regime II. In this regime the
IX density oscillations are observed as well, while their quality factor is diﬀerent.
Strong interactions of the cavity mode with the IX–DX resonance result in a
higher magnitude of nIX oscillations than in regime I. The damping rate of
these oscillations is also larger. Clearly, the regime of strong coupling between
all modes is advantageous for the pulsed pumping regime, and allows for high-
power generation. On the other hand, regime I is preferential for the longstanding
signal generation providing a higher-quality factor ξ, with lower amplitude of
oscillations.
It has been shown that due to the coupling between modes IX and DX, densit-
ies oscillate with a THz frequency. This infers that a dipolariton is an oscillating
dipole, with a dipole moment in the z direction dz changing periodically from

value dz = d0, corresponding to an indirect exciton (IX) to dz = 0, corresponding
to a direct exciton (DX). One can deﬁne the total dipole moment of the system
as Dz = NIXdz, where NIX = nIXA is the number of indirect excitons within
the area A illuminated by the pumping light. Since we have shown previously
that after initial transient regime the density of indirect excitons nIX(t) is an
harmonic function of time, the total dipole moment of the system can be found as
Dz(t) = d0nIXA cos2(ωt/2)e−t/τ
(16.61)
Here, nIX is the maximum density of indirect excitons.
The mechanism of THz radiation by an oscillating density of indirect excitons
is similar to the photo-Dember eﬀect, where oscillations of electron–hole plasma
on a surface of semiconductor generate a THz signal and other laser-driven
terahertz emitters. However, the system of dipolaritons has some important ad-
vantages over previously studied systems; namely, (1) the better tunability of the
system, allowing for fast modulation of the THz emission frequency, (2) improved
spectral characteristics of the THz signal, which can be controlled by using ap-
plied voltage and pumping conditions, and (3) the possibility of achieving a high
output power. For a typical laser-driven THz source, the output power lies in
the range of nanowatts, with its upper boundary in the microwatt range. The
power of a dipolariton emitter is calculated as follows.
The total intensity of the far-ﬁeld radiation emitted by a classical Hertz dipole
can be found from (32):
I =
¨D2
z
6πϵ0c3
(16.62)
where Dz is the total dipole moment of the dipolariton array, ϵ0 is the vacuum
permittivity, and c is the speed of light. For the particular case of an array of
harmonic dipole oscillations, the intensity is
I = N2
IX
d2
0ω4
3πϵ0c3
(16.63)
where d0 = eL is a dipole moment of indirect exciton, with L being the separation
between centers of QWs. Similarly to the conventional case of an elementary
dipole emitter, the polar pattern is given by Iθ ∼sin2 θ, where θ is an angle
between the direction of radiation and the axis of the structure (see Fig. 16.15).
It is important to note that the total emitted intensity is proportional to
the square of the density of indirect excitons, and is non-linearly dependent on
the pump intensity. This is a manifestation of the superradiance eﬀect (31): due
to the interference of coherent in-phase oscillations of elementary dipoles, the
output power is enhanced. This eﬀect is sensitive to the quality factor of the
cavity: the longer that Rabi oscillations persist, the stronger the ampliﬁcation
eﬀect. Superradiance is a speciﬁc feature of the dipolariton THz emitter, which
makes it more eﬃcient than any existing laser-to-THz convertor.

mirrors, while MM (THz) denotes a metallic mirror cavity tuned to reﬂect
a signal of THz frequency. Curves with label THz show the peculiar polar
pattern of a dipolariton THz emitter.
For ℏJ = 6 meV and the typical distance between QWs of L = 12 nm, the
power of the THz emission of one elementary dipole formed by a dipolariton is
I0 = 1.8 × 10−17 W = 18 aW. The total power emitted is given by this quantity
multiplied by the number of elementary dipoles NIX. For the typical concen-
tration of indirect excitons achievable experimentally of nIX = 1010 cm−2 and a
60-μm-diameter of the pumping spot, one obtains Itot ≈1.4 μ W. By embedding
a stack of double quantum wells, nDQW = four in each microcavity, and using
several sets of cavities on one chip one can obtain the output power similar to
one of quantum cascade lasers.
Furthermore, to improve the eﬃciency of THz radiation, the system can be
placed in an external cavity tuned to the THz frequency. It can be created using
metallic mirrors or an inductor capacitor circuit. A sketch of the system is shown
in Fig. 16.15. The eﬃciency of the emission would be further increased due to
the Purcell factor of the external cavity (8). For the chosen frequency, 1.45 THz,
the experimentally measured Purcell factor of an inductor–capacitor cavity is
FP = 17. However, strictly speaking, the THz cavity is not necessary, and the
described physics holds for the sample without it.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have presented an overview of recent proposals for radiation
sources in the terahertz range of frequencies, based on microcavity polaritons.
The Rabi-splitting of polariton modes in microcavities is usually in the THz fre-
quency range, which allows for diﬀerent scenarios of realization of THz sources
based on microcavities. An additional advantage can be taken from the bosonic
nature of exciton-polaritons. Stimulation of THz emission by the polariton con-
densate population leads to the bosonic laser eﬀect. Bosonic lasers are expected

to show a higher quantum eﬃciency than existing fermion lasers—in particular,
quantum cascade lasers. Stimulated emission of THz radiation in these lasers does
not require a THz cavity. Bosonic terahertz lasers may operate both in horizontal
and vertical geometry. In the latter case, they can be assembled into matrices.
The crucial factor in these proposals is the use of a wide band-gap semiconductor
(in particular, GaN), which opens the way to realization of room-temperature
THz emitters. We believe that existing optically pumped polariton lasers based
on GaN, combined with a pumping LED, may be used for the creation of a
room-temperature vertical-cavity surface-emitting terahertz laser.
