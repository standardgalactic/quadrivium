F
OR SIX MONTHS, IEEE SPECTRUM ASSOCIATE EDITOR
Amy Nordrum knew she’d be heading to Alaska—she just 
didn’t know exactly when. Her goal was to travel beyond 
the Arctic Circle, to witness a crew working with a heavy-lift 
helicopter to install a microwave tower on top of a mountain. 
Construction was scheduled for the summer, but a specific 
date was hard to pin down. 
Finally, last July, a few days before the lift, she got the call. Her 
plan was to fly from New York City to Anchorage and then on to the city 
of Kotzebue. Once there, she would immediately board a helicopter 
that would whisk her across the treeless tundra to the tower—one of 
109 being erected to deliver Internet service to rural villages.
But her flight to Kotzebue was canceled due to fog, a frequent visitor 
to coastal Alaska. Catching a later flight, she arrived too late to watch 
the crew, so she explored the area instead. The city of 3,245 has only 
18 kilometers of roads. Even from the center, you can easily see the edge. 
The next day, Nordrum did make it out to the tower [see “Broadband 
or Bust,” in this issue]. Along the way, she spotted antlers, bright 
white and spiky, shed by caribou across the spongy green tundra. 
As the helicopter veered closer, she caught a rare glimpse of a shaggy 
musk ox on the ridge just below. The pilot surmised that the animal 
had climbed up the barren mountainside to investigate the strange 
new tower. 
Such sightings show how thrilling and unpredictable the Far North 
can be. “Alaska is as raw a place as I’ve ever been, and I love that about 
it,” Nordrum says. □

G. Pascal Zachary 
Zachary is a faculty member at 
Arizona State University and editor 
of its Rightful Place of Science book series. A 
frequent contributor to Spectrum, he previously 
was a staff writer for The Wall Street Journal and a 
technology columnist for The New York Times. In 
this issue’s Spectral Lines [p. 8], Zachary looks 
at the potential risks and rewards of Silicon 
Valley’s attempts to shake up drug research. 
Luke Wagner
When Wagner applied to work at 
Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the 
Firefox Web browser, he thought, “It would be so 
cool to get paid to work on an open-source project 
that I use myself.” That enthusiasm must have 
impressed his interviewers, because he’s been a 
software engineer at Mozilla for eight years. Most 
recently, he’s worked on WebAssembly, something 
to make your browser even more capable, as he 
describes in “Turbocharging the Web” [p. 48].
Travis Smith
For “Broadband or Bust,” photographer 
Smith got permission to fly a drone close 
enough to capture “air-to-air” shots of a heavy-lift 
helicopter as it lowered a telecommunications 
tower onto an Alaskan mountainside [p. 40]. 
But the helicopter’s propellers produce 
160-kilometer-per-hour winds—strong enough 
to knock a drone from the sky. Luckily, natural 
winds across the tundra that day canceled out the 
effect, and his drone (and the photos) survived. 
Kyriakos Porfyrakis 
Porfyrakis was inspired to make carbon-
cage molecules after hearing a talk by 
the late Harry Kroto, who’d won a Nobel Prize for 
discovering them. Later, Porfyrakis built a lab at 
the University of Oxford to study cage molecules 
that enclose other atoms. His colleague Edward 
A. Laird is interested in exploiting the quantum 
behavior of such trapped atoms. In this issue, the 
two discuss their efforts to build an ultraprecise 
atomic clock from caged atoms [p. 34].
CONTRIBUTORS_
Rachel Courtland 
Courtland, an astronomy aficionado, 
fondly recalls her time interning at 
NASA while in high school. Last June, she seized 
the chance to report on an ambitious radio 
telescope project in Western Australia [p. 26]. 
“The outback is beautiful and the night sky there 
is amazing,” she says. “It’s the most travel I’ve 
ever done for a story, but it was well worth it.” A 
former senior associate editor at IEEE Spectrum,
Courtland now works at Nature.

ing modifications to their R&D processes, 
the pharmaceutical sector continues to 
utilize a drug development process that 
is slow, inefficient, risky, and expensive.”
Computer people think they can fix 
a broken process. One reason: The suc-
cess of Bill Gates, the philanthropist and 
Microsoft founder, in revolutionizing 
malaria research. About 15 years ago, 
Gates discovered a scandalous situa-
tion: Despite the fact that the disease had 
caused the deaths of millions in Africa, 
global spending on cures was less than 
$100 million. And the leading funder was 
the U.S. military.
Gates has turbocharged malaria research, 
providing better treatments, greater knowl-
edge, and a partially effective vaccine.
With Gates as inspiration, other wealthy 
computer people, such as Larry Page, 
cofounder of Google, have invested in 
alternative approaches, often bypassing 
traditional structures. Google, for instance, 
has invested in a company pursuing holis-
tic approaches to forestalling death.
One result of all this is that the medical establish-
ment is embracing openness. That’s partly because 
of the growing role of computation in every aspect 
of biology, to the extent that biology today seems 
driven by digital technology. And the belief has 
taken hold among scientists that computers pro-
vide the best models for human thought and many 
bodily functions (see the boom in artificial knees).
An emerging field of “digital biology”—centered 
on editing genes in ways that seem similar to writ-
ing software—has great promise, and it has rein-
forced the impression that electrical engineers and 
computer scientists can find rewarding careers 
in biomedicine. 
To be sure, there are risks to any health revolu-
tion led by geeks. The rapid advances in the digital 
realm are relatively risk-free (no one usually dies 
from a sloppy program). Then there’s the potential 
for new forms of inequality. One reason progress 
in biomedicine can be slow is the need to include 
everyone (rich and poor) in the benefits of an inno-
vation. If the wealthy take medical research into pri-
vate enclaves, biomedical advances could become 
the preserve of elites.  —G. PASCAL ZACHARY

medicines? Not medical schools. Not research physicians. 
Not biologists. ¶ Computer people. ¶ Really? The geeks 
will save us? Maybe. Spanning diseases as diverse as can-
cer and malaria, in the gnarly fields of memory extension 
and cognitive decline, electrical engineers and computer 
scientists are revitalizing and reshaping the face of bio-
medical innovation. ¶ Part of the reason is desperation. Biomedical 
innovators are experiencing a crisis in performance. For decades, vast 
increases in spending on traditional forms of medical research have 
resulted in fewer effective drugs or therapies. ¶ The stagnation of bio-
medical innovation is an invitation to wealthy digital innovators to insist 
they can do better. In his second book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, 
or How to Build the Future, Peter Thiel, a well-known venture capitalist, 
argues that health researchers are overly cautious, too prone to asking 
permission from health bureaucrats, and infatuated with publishing stud-
ies instead of contributing to beneficial health outcomes. ¶ These frus-
trations prompted Thiel, in 2016, to fund unregulated human trials for a 
herpes vaccine in the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. ¶ Because 
digital innovators rarely face federal regulations, they suspect that gov-
ernment tends to cripple biomedical creativity. As evidence, they point to 
weak results by the National Institutes of Health, which spends a staggering 
US $30 billion a year on research. ¶ “Forged in the early 1960s, the para-
digm for pharmaceutical innovation has remained virtually unchanged 
for nearly 50 years,” Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the 
Study of Drug Development, has written. “During a period when most

The deadliest animal on 
Earth, by far, is the mos-
quito. Each year, mosquitoes 
infect about 700 million people with diseases such as malaria, 
dengue fever, West Nile virus, and Zika. Millions of people 
die annually from mosquito-borne illnesses, and many of 
those diseases can’t be cured with drugs. It’s best to avoid 
being bitten in the first place, but this is becoming more dif-
ficult as the insects expand their range, migrating north with 
warming climates.
For decades, government agencies and nonprofit organi-
zations have tried to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne 
diseases in developing countries by spraying large areas with 
insecticides. But that process is expensive, especially as mos-
quitoes develop resistance to commonly used chemicals. The 
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) 
has begun to look for other mosquito control methods.

WEROBOTICS (2)
One approach is to breed male mos-
quitoes in captivity, expose them to 
radiation that renders them sterile, 
and release them into the wild. These 
mosquitoes, being mosquitoes, don’t 
understand that they can no longer 
successfully reproduce, and do their 
best to make it happen anyway. In large 
enough numbers, the sterile males will 
outcompete wild males for female mos-
quitoes, which can reduce local popula-
tions by as much as 90 percent.
This method has been around for 
half a century, but spreading sterile 
mosquitoes in the developing world 
is a challenge. Roads are nonexistent 
or in poor condition, so it may not be 
possible to release insects from a car 
or truck, and using a crewed aircraft 
is too expensive. 
In 2016, USAID funded an organization 
called WeRobotics, based in Wilmington, 
Del., to engineer a system that can deploy 
sterile mosquitoes from autonomous 
drones instead. USAID and WeRobotics 
want to see whether drones can replace 
conventional aircraft as a way to man-
age mosquito populations over hun-
dreds of square kilometers. “We hope 
to greatly increase the area that we can 
cover by using drones,” says WeRobotics’ 
cofounder Adam Klaptocz. 
Klaptocz and his colleagues started 
WeRobotics to explore ways that drones 
can have a positive social impact. Over 
the past few years, they’ve set up com-
munity robotics labs in developing 
nations around the world. WeRobotics 
and its partners have used drones to 
map roads in Nepal, deliver medi-
cine in Peru, and coordinate humani-
tarian efforts in the Caribbean after 
Hurricane Maria. 
The company’s latest project is test-
ing a prototype drone-based mosquito 
control system in South America. The 
challenge here is not the drone itself—
it’s how you carry and release mosqui-
toes from that drone. “Mosquitoes are 
very fragile animals,” Klaptocz explains. 
“If you put hundreds of thousands of 
and wings,” he says. The trick, accord-
ing to Klaptocz, is to keep them inside 
a precooled container: “Between 4 °C 
and 8 °C, they’ll fall asleep, and you can 
pack them up fairly densely.” 
It’s also important to control the 
release of the mosquitoes, rather than 
dumping them out all at once. “We 
tried different systems to get the mos-
quitoes out of the holding canister, 
including vibrations and a treadmill,” 
he says. “Right now, we’re using a rotat-
ing element with holes through which 
individual mosquitoes can fall.” Once 
them into a very small box, they’re going 
to damage themselves, and damaged 
mosquitoes will not be able to compete 
with wild mosquitoes.” 
The goal is to pack as many mosqui-
toes as possible into the drone. How-
ever, clumping is a problem because 
the insects form “a big collection of legs 
MOSQUITO CONTROL: To spread 
sterile mosquitoes, WeRobotics will 
dump them into the white container

ØYVIND GRAVÅS
The world’s first floating wind 
farm began producing electricity 
in October. The quintet of turbines, oper-
ated by Norwegian oil and gas giant Statoil, bobs just 25 kilometers off 
the coast of Scotland and generates enough electricity for 20,000 homes. 
Offshore turbines cost more to install and run than onshore turbines, and 
the vast majority still rely on fixed-base equipment, in shallow coastal waters. 
But even close to shore, their capacity to generate electricity is improved 
because wind speeds are higher over the ocean than on land. Farther out 
to sea, the winds are more powerful still. 
In the future, it may be wise to build floating wind farms that sway 
hundreds of kilometers from shore. In addition to the winds being faster, 
simulations from atmospheric scientists at the Carnegie Institution 
for Science’s ecology department, in Stanford, Calif., show that winds 
over the open ocean are also far more consistent than those over land. 
During the past decade, scientists and wind farm developers have 
noticed that winds may be weakened after turbines are installed. Dense 
arrays of turbines produce drag, which depletes local or even regional 
wind resources. 
It is now generally accepted that drag from wind turbines in the bound-
ary layer (where the atmosphere interacts with Earth’s surface) limits 
the kinetic energy that large onshore wind farms can extract to about 
1.5 megawatts per square kilometer. “If your average turbine extracts 
2 to 6 MW, you really need to space those turbines 1 to 4 km apart because 
the atmosphere just doesn’t give you more kinetic energy to extract,” says 
Carnegie postdoctoral researcher Anna Possner. 
In their simulations, Possner and climate scientist Ken Caldeira revealed 
that the atmosphere is more generous over the open ocean. There, they 
estimate, wind farms could be packed more tightly. In some regions, such 
as the North Atlantic, the simulations suggest that large wind farms can 
extract 6 MW/km2 or more.

FOR MORE POWER, 
FLOAT WIND TURBINES 
FAR OUT AT SEA
Over the open ocean, strong winds rebound quickly
the mosquitoes fall out of the canister, 
they spend a few seconds in a second-
ary chamber warming up to the out-
side air temperature before exiting the 
drone, to make sure they’re awake and 
ready to fly. 
It’s not yet clear that drones will be 
much more effective than humans 
with backpacks at dispersing mosqui-
toes, says Robert Malkin, an expert on 
new health-care technologies at Duke 
University. And sustaining any kind of 
operation in remote areas with little 
infrastructure will be a challenge. “But 
it could work,” he says. “It sounds like 
a cool project.”
WeRobotics will conduct its first exper-
iments for USAID with sterilized male 
mosquitoes in late 2017 or early 2018, 
somewhere in South or Central America. 
“Our next step is running controlled tests, 
where we mark the insects, release them, 
and recapture them in traps to mea-
sure whether they’re healthy or not,” 
says Klaptocz.
WeRobotics’ deployment system 
works with different kinds of mosqui-
toes and any model of drone. For future 
projects, it could carry and release male 
mosquitoes that have been genetically 
modified to have sterile offspring; male 
mosquitoes that have been infected with 
a bacteria called Wolbachia pipientis,
which makes their offspring sterile; or 
female Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, 
which are less likely to transmit diseases 
when they bite. 
But before they begin any live mos-
quito testing, WeRobotics must work 
with local communities to win their sup-
port. “We’re trying to control disease 
vectors,” Klaptocz explains. “But prac-
tically, what we’re doing is releasing a 
whole bunch of mosquitoes into com-
munities and flying drones over them. 
Engagement with these communities 
has to be done from the beginning, by 
talking to people and involving them 
in the process.”  —EVAN ACKERMAN

Possner and Caldeira 
say this is possible due to 
cyclonic weather systems that 
form as seas release heat into 
the atmosphere. When wind 
farms harvest the kinetic 
energy in the boundary layer, 
those storms replenish the 
energy by drawing from pow-
erful winds blowing over it. 
In side-by-side simulations, 
the researchers packed wind 
turbines into large wind-rich 
regions in Kansas and over 
regions of equal size in the 
North Atlantic. For a massive 
wind farm in Kansas stretch-
ing over 70,000 km2—an area 
slightly larger than Ireland—
turbines could extract 0.3 to 
0.4 terawatts for four months 
of the year. 
Covering a 70,000-km 2
stretch of the North Atlantic 
with turbines, meanwhile, 
extracted that much power 
from September through 
June—more than twice as long.
Wind power could provide 
a very large share of future 
electricity generation if float-
ing turbines can be made cost 
effective. Statoil’s new 30-MW 
floating wind farm (which is 
one-quarter owned by Masdar, 
of the United Arab Emirates) 
is 60 to 70 percent cheaper 
per megawatt than its 2009 
pilot. A Statoil executive vice 
president, Irene Rummelhoff, 
says the company’s “ambi-
tion” is to cut the energy 
cost to €40 to €60 (US $47 to 
$71) per megawatt-hour by 
2030—a range that overlaps 
current prices for onshore 
wind power. 
Rebecca Barthelmie, a wind 
power expert in Cornell’s 
mechanical and aerospace 
engineering department, is 
optimistic. “There’s no doubt 
floating turbines will be cost 
effective in the relatively short 
term—big companies don’t 
invest in full-scale wind farms 
without a great deal of confi-
dence that this technology is 
near market,” she says.
If open ocean wind farms in 
the North Atlantic prove feasi-
ble, they will prompt another 
set of questions. Would they 
weaken output from onshore 
wind farms in Europe? How 
will the energy be brought 
ashore? And what climatic 
surprises might massive 
ocean arrays deliver?
Early results by Possner and 
Caldeira suggest that North 
Atlantic arrays would result 
in cooling above the Arctic 
Circle; one scenario they 
simulated, in which float-
ing wind turbines spanned 
an area nearly the size 
of Greenland, chilled the 
Arctic by as much as 13 °C. 
Whether that’s acceptable—
or perhaps even desirable—
is a subject for future study.

Spy satellites and their commercial 
cousins orbit Earth like a swarm of space 
paparazzi, capturing tens of terabytes 
of images every day. The deluge of satel-
lite imagery leaves U.S. intelligence agencies with the 
world’s biggest case of FOMO—“fear of missing out”—
because human analysts can sift through only so 
many images to spot a new nuclear enrichment facil-
ity or missiles being trucked to different locations. 
That’s why U.S. intelligence officials have sponsored 
an artificial-intelligence challenge to automatically 
identify objects of interest in satellite images.
Since July, competitors have trained machine-
learning algorithms on one of the world’s largest 
publicly available data sets of satellite imagery—
containing 1 million labeled objects, such as build-
ings and facilities. The data is provided by the U.S. 
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity 
(IARPA). The 10 finalists will see their AI algorithms 
scored against a hidden data set of satellite imagery 
when the challenge closes at the end of December. 
The agency’s goal in sponsoring the Functional 
Map of the World Challenge aligns with state-
ments made by Robert Cardillo, director of the 
U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, who 
has pushed for AI solutions that can automate 
75 percent of the workload currently performed 
by humans analyzing satellite images. 
“It seems to me like these agencies want to generate 
maps automatically,” says Mark Pritt, a research sci-
entist at Lockheed Martin, “without having to have 
a human person look at a satellite image and saying, 
‘Oh, there’s a smokestack there, let me mark it on 
the map.’ Today’s maps are generated manually.” 
Pritt and his colleagues at Lockheed make up 
one of many teams from academia, government 
labs, and the private sector that are competing for 
a total of US $100,000 in prize money. They and 
other contestants are eager to deploy deep-learning 
algorithms that can recognize specific patterns and 
identify objects of interest in Earth imagery. Such

images are typically gathered through 
remote-sensing technologies aboard 
satellites, aircraft, and drones.
Satellite images present a far greater 
sorting challenge to deep-learning algo-
rithms than do online photos of human 
faces, landmarks, or objects. Satellite 
images are shot from multiple angles, 
where objects such as buildings may 
appear upside down. And cloud cover 
can change how images of the same area 
appear from one hour to the next.
Satellite images also have much greater 
variety in resolution. That complicates 
the matter for deep-learning algorithms, 
which typically work best with fixed image 
sizes. Human engineers face trade-offs 
when deciding whether to resize the entire 
image and lose some detail in the lower 
resolution, or crop the image and focus 
on just one part. Furthermore, many sat-
ellites can capture Earth images beyond 
the visible-light spectrum, in the infrared 
band or at other wavelengths.
Individuals or teams experienced in 
working with satellite imagery may have 
advantages over other deep-learning 
researchers in the IARPA challenge. 
But everyone still faces big obstacles in 
making deep learning work under the 
imperfect conditions of real-world sat-
ellite imagery. And experts agree that 
deep-learning algorithms are not ready 
to do the entire job on their own, even if 
they achieve 80 or 90 percent accuracy. 
“I think the state of the technology right 
now enables a combination of man and 
machine to actually get to the answer,” 
says Mike Warren, CTO and cofounder 
of Descartes Labs. 
A spin-off of the U.S. Energy Depart-
ment’s Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
Descartes Labs already uses deep learning 
to automatically analyze satellite images 
for commercial purposes, such as fore-
casting the U.S. corn and soybean har-
vests. These applications represent an 
“80 percent solution for 10 percent of the 
effort,” Warren says.
Companies have developed many of 
the most interesting uses for deep learn-
ing and satellite imagery, says Grant 
Scott, a data scientist at the University 
of Missouri who leads another team par-
ticipating in the IARPA challenge. By 
comparison, U.S. intelligence agencies 
are much quieter about their capabili-
ties and plans. But the IARPA challenge 
makes it clear that these agencies wish 
to build better deep-learning tools for 
satellite-imagery analysis.
“There are currently programs in place 
within pockets of the U.S. intelligence 
community, but there is always room 
for improvement in both speed and 
approach,” says Hakjae Kim, program 
manager for IARPA.
Scott and his University of Missouri 
colleagues have already begun to show 
the power of combining publicly avail-
able commercial satellite imagery and 
open-source intelligence. In a paper 
published in October in the Journal of 
Applied Remote Sensing, they describe 
how deep-learning algorithms could 
accurately identify known locations of 
surface-to-air missile sites in China in an 
area of nearly 90,000 square kilometers. 
Their best algorithm produced 
results that were verified by humans as 
98 percent accurate. The algorithm took 
just 42 minutes to deliver readings that 
matched the accuracy of human analysts, 
whereas a traditional visual search by 
humans required an average of 60 hours. 
Such results bode well for the IARPA 
challenge goal and could help establish 
deep learning as a necessary tool. Both 
governments and companies continue to 
launch swarms of imaging satellites to join 
the existing constellations peering down 
at Earth. The U.S. commercial satellite 
operator DigitalGlobe—which provided 
the imagery for the IARPA challenge—
already captures more than 70 terabytes 
of raw imagery each day. Sooner, rather 
than later, human analysts will need all 
the AI help they can get.  —JEREMY HSU

Such systems also need parallel-

vor du jour. That’s the trick behind pro-
grams that recognize stop signs, respect 
the edges of the lane or highway, and 
distinguish a flickering shadow from a

NXP and Nvidia often behave like 
rivals, but they aren’t using the same 
measuring stick. NXP wants to be the 
friend of developers and system inte-
grators by handling the entire car, with 
its hundreds of apps and chips. Nvidia 
wants to monitor the immediate envi-
ronment and frame a path through it. 
Both systems could easily coexist in a 
car, and maybe they will.
Right now, though, the two compa-
nies’ robocar platforms are works in 
progress. Companies that want to 
test NXP’s platform must content 
themselves with software sim-
ulations. And Nvidia’s Pegasus 
won’t incorporate the latest 
GPUs until next year, so for the 
time being, its customers must 
work with Drive PX, a forerun-
ner of Pegasus. 
There are other players, 
of course. Intel’s purchase of 
Jerusalem-based Mobileye in 
May makes it an instant auto-
electronics company, but Intel’s 
various chip architectures 
weren’t necessarily designed to play 
well together. Tesla, now using Nvidia 
chips, is rumored to be working on a 
home-built alternative, perhaps with 
the aid of AMD.

brain for your car and you’re not in the

Two companies—NXP and Nvidia—
recently unveiled computing plat-
forms for smart cars, and each claims 
that its platform is the best. Which is 
right? The answer depends on how 
you’re keeping score.
NXP Semiconductors announced 
the S32x automotive processing plat-
form, apparently an elaboration of 
the BlueBox system it unveiled last 
year. At the time, BlueBox seemed 
an attempt for NXP to knit together 
devices the company already 
sold. Now, with S32x, NXP 
appears to be doubling down 
on interoperability. 
“All the parts that come out 
will have the advantage of 
being compatible with this 
platform—this vision proces-
sor, this radar processor, this 
torque-management device,” 
says Matt Johnson, who’s in 
charge of NXP’s product lines, 
software, and automotive pro-
cessors. And the company says 
the platform lets coders reuse 
software when adding new features to 
the vehicle, thus saving time.
NXP says 8 of the top 15 carmakers 
have adopted the platform for use 
in future models, and this isn’t too 
surprising. The company, based in 
Eindhoven, Netherlands, instantly 
became the biggest supplier of auto-
motive chips with its 2015 acquisition 
of Freescale Semiconductor.
Ultimately, the NXP platform intends 
to pull all the car’s electronics together. 
That means low-power chips handling 
mundane things like automatic brak-
ing, and higher-end ones that fuse

Meanwhile, Nvidia Corp.’s platform,

thing but do it well: drive cars. That com-
pute-heavy task is a perfect fit for the 
company’s powerful graphics processing 
units, or GPUs. These specialized parallel 
processors first won fame by powering 
gaming platforms and later, Bitcoin min-

Nvidia’s revenues in the second quarter).

emirate. What’s the big 
deal? It was a test flight 
for what Dubai hopes will 
be the world’s first flying 
taxi service. What’s more, 
the two-seater vertical-
takeoff-and-landing 
aircraft, made by the 
German firm Volocopter, 
will eventually be fully 
autonomous, avoiding 
obstacles and other flying 
taxis without a pilot—
onboard or remote—
guiding it. Passengers 
will hail these battery-
powered sky taxis via 
a smartphone app like 
Uber’s and wait for them 
to swoop down at local 
“voloports.” If all goes 
according to plan, Dubai 
and Volocopter envision 
these 18-rotor sky cabs 
being available for 
regular passenger service 
within the next five years.

3. Fibonacci Clock
Geeks love clocks. Don’t ask me 
why, we just do. And the geekier 
the better. Clocks that show the 
time using various binary dis-
plays are particularly appealing 
because of their power to mys-
tify the uninitiated. But the $135 
Fibonacci Clock goes even deep-
er down the rabbit hole: The clock 
face is divided into squares, the 
side lengths of which correspond 
to the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 
2, 3, and 5. Different colors illu-
minate the squares for hours and 
minutes, and the time is deter-
mined by adding up the appro-
priate squares.
4. Mambo FPV Drone
Parrot’s drones are perennial fa-
vorites in Spectrum’s gift guide, 
and for good reason: Since the 
very beginning of the drone 
boom, the company has done 
a great job of cramming new 
features into small consumer 
drones. The $180 Mambo FPV 
comes with a camera-equipped 
drone, a set of glasses for turning 
your smartphone into a VR dis-
play, and a controller. The battery 
can provide about 10 minutes 
of ﬂight time per charge—more 
than enough for a couple of races.
1. Circuit Classics
We wrote about Star Simpson’s 
project to turn some of Forrest 
M. Mims’s classic circuit de-
signs into working display piec-
es back in 2016, but the boards 
weren’t available to the gen-
eral public when last year’s gift 
guide went to press. These cir-
cuits were originally published in 
a series of booklets distributed by 
RadioShack—motto: “Still tech-
nically in business!”—that were 
many Americans’ first exposure 
to electronics. Now the boards 
are available for US $39 apiece 
and include a tone generator, LED 
ﬂasher, and voltage indicator.
2. Lego Boost
When Lego debuted the 
Mindstorms robotics kit in 1998, 
it was programmed using a sim-
ple graphical programming in-
terface designed for children. 
But Mindstorms quickly found a 
broad audience among older en-
thusiasts and researchers, and 
the capability—and complexity—
of the line increased over the 
years. The new $160 Lego Boost 
kit is something of a return to ba-
sics. Intended for children aged 
7 to 12, Boost creations are con-
trolled directly from a drag-and-
drop-style programming app 
running on a tablet.

6. Kwilt Shoebox
Cloud technology is great, but 
I admit to being skittish when it 
comes to handing over person-
al data to some giant corpora-
tion that may not have my best 
interests at heart. So I found 
the $70 Kwilt Shoebox appeal-
ing: It’s designed speciﬁcally for 
smartphone users who want an 
easy way to off-load their pho-
tographs and videos to a per-
sonal cloud. Plug the Shoebox 
into your router and run the set-
up wizard in Kwilt’s smartphone 
app. Then you can plug any USB 
storage device into the Shoebox 
and, at the tap of a ﬁnger, trans-
fer photos from your phone to 
the storage device.

CLOCKWISE FROM TOP RIGHT: CIRCUIT BREAKER LABS; LUMEN ELECTRONIC JEWELRY; SENSEL; KWILT
8, 9. Geek Chic
Signal your love of electronics 
with some stylish jewelry. Circuit 
Breaker Labs recycles old print-
ed circuit boards (complete with 
components) into bracelets, ear-
rings, necklaces, cuff links, tie 
bars, and even retractable badge 
holders. Prices range from $21 to 
$345 for individual pieces, and 
gift sets are available.
Another electronics-pride jew-
elry option is provided by Lumen 
Electronic Jewelry. The com-
pany has created a range of 
solar-powered, LED-equipped 
necklaces, earrings, and tie clips 
that can blink long into the night, 
with charge stored in capaci-
tors rather than bulky batteries 
(pieces cost between $85 and 
$225). ■
5. PinBox 3000
Video games come and go—the 
latest fad is VR arcades—but 
pinball endures. With the $50 
PinBox 3000 kit, you can design 
and build your own tabletop pin-
ball machine out of cardboard, 
complete with flippers, ramps, 
and traps. But Spectrum readers 
will want to spring for the $15 
add-on LED Teck Pack, which 
lets you incorporate a lighting rig 
that can respond to the action on 
the game ﬁeld.
7. Sensel Morph
For the power user in your life, 
get the $300 Sensel Morph 
and at least one of the $35 
overlays designed to go with 
it. The Morph provides a large 
pressure-sensitive area that au-
tomatically behaves as a spe-
cialized keyboard depending on 
what overlay is placed on top of 
it. Overlays are available for mu-
sic production, video editing, 
gaming, and so on. Super pow-
er users can use an API to create 
their own overlay designs, with a 
more user-friendly customiza-
tion process in the works.

TOP: SRIHARI YAMANOOR (2); BOTTOM: BEAGLEBOARD.ORG FOUNDATION
HE BEAGLEBOARD.ORG FOUNDATION IS A NONPROFIT
dedicated to developing open-source embedded hardware and 
software. The foundation’s latest creation is the PocketBeagle, a 
single-board computer that runs Linux. The PocketBeagle debuted at the 
World Maker Faire this past September in New York City, and we were lucky 
enough to be there and win one of the ﬁrst boards.ǑBeagleBoard.org makes 
a number of boards designed for different applications, such as robotics. 
These typically sell in the US $60 to $125 range. At $25, the PocketBeagle 
is designed to be a low-cost variant. But it’s not just a stripped-down ver-
sion of the other boards, as the PocketBeagle offers some interesting 
features of its own. So we immediately started thinking of projects that 
we could try out with the board, settling on a light controller for a festive 
village diorama for the coming holiday season.ǑThe PocketBeagle runs 
Debian Linux, and hence it is possible to develop applications in different 
programming languages, including Python, Ruby, or BoneScript. The lat-
ter is a library built on top of Node.js that was developed for the Beagle 
family: It allows you to program and control devices using Web pages and 
JavaScript. What’s really interesting about the PocketBeagle is that in ad-

dition to a primary CPU that runs the Linux 
operating system (an ARM Cortex-A8 run-
ning at 1 gigahertz), the processor at the 
heart of the PocketBeagle also has two pro-
grammable real-time units (PRUs). 
These are, in essence, independent 32-bit 
microprocessors that run at 200 megahertz 
and are designed to communicate with exter-
nal hardware. Debian Linux is not a real-time 
operating system (which would guarantee 
the precise timing of running code), but suit-
ably programmed PRUs allow the system as 
a whole to handle real-time applications, such 
as ﬂying a drone. The PRUs are typically pro-
grammed using the C programming language, 
but the BeagleBoard community is working 
on projects that should enable programming 
the PRUs using Python or an Arduino-like inte-
grated development environment (IDE).
Setting up the PocketBeagle to run Linux 
was a straightforward process that would be 
familiar to any reader who has set up simi-
lar single-board computers, such as the 
Raspberry Pi. However, we quickly ran into 
problems trying to use higher-level tools, 
such as BoneScript, to create our own con-
trol software. We also ran into difﬁculties try-
ing to compile code for the PRUs and were 
eventually forced to abandon them. After 
some investigation, we realized that the 
common cause of these problems was that 
the supporting BeagleBoard tool chain had 
still only partially been ported over to the new 
board. Because the BeagleBoard is a pop-
ular platform with an active user base, we 
expect that this will soon be remedied with 
open-source contributions.
But for now we had to find an alterna-
tive, so we settled on writing software ex-
clusively for the main processor in C, using 
Jack Mitchell’s libsoc library. This library pro-
vides basic hooks in the kernel of the operat-
ing system for controlling peripherals, such 
as the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) 
connections on the PocketBeagle. (You can 
ﬁnd our code at https://github.com/sai-y.)
Our goal was to control lighting that fell 
into three broad categories: low-power 
LED ornaments that run on 5 volts; ana-
log RGB LED strips that run on 12 V and 
are controlled by adjusting the voltages 
for the red, green, and blue strands that

make up the strip; and conventional string 
lights that run on 110  V from a wall socket. 
The PocketBeagle’s GPIO connections 
operate at 3.3 V, so we built a transistor-
based switching circuit to control the low-
power ornaments and the RGB LED strips 
using pulse-width modulation to vary the ef-
fective voltages. We decided to use off-the-
shelf hardware that is designed to operate 
AC appliances. This hardware uses optically 
isolated relays that can be switched us-
ing a 3.3- to 5-V trigger signal, allowing 
us to control two power circuits that are 
normally on and two that are normally off. 
We ran into a small wrinkle in actually 
connecting these switching interfaces to 
the PocketBeagle: As did the creators of the 
Raspberry Pi Zero and Pi Zero W, the mak-
ers of the PocketBeagle kept costs down 
by omitting headers for the 36-hole double 
row of GPIO connections on either side of the 
board. We had a surprisingly hard time ﬁnd-
ing suitable female headers to solder onto 
the board. It would be nice if the BeagleBoard.
org Foundation could provide some links 
to sources for purchasing the headers.
It’s also worth noting that, in another 
sacriﬁce that appears to have been made 
to control costs, the PocketBeagle has no 
wireless or Ethernet network capability. If, 
for example, you want to control the com-
puter via the Internet, you will have to either 
tether it via USB to a host computer that is 
connected or purchase some add-on hard-
ware such as a MikroElektronika click board.
All that aside, we soon had our little fes-
tive village glowing and blinking under 
PocketBeagle control. Regardless of its cur-
rent shortcomings, we love this new board.

LET ME BEGIN WITH A DISCLAIMER: I am neither promoting 
electric vehicles nor denigrating them. I simply observe that the 
rational case for accepting EVs has been undermined by unrealis-
tic market forecasts and a disregard for the environmental effects 
involved in producing and operating these vehicles.  Unrealistic forecasts have 
been the norm. In 2008, Deutsche Bank predicted that EVs would claim 7 per-
cent of the U.S. market by 2016; in 2010, Bloomberg Businessweek put the 2016 
share at 6 percent. But actual sales came to 158,614 units, just 0.9 percent of the 
record 17.55 million vehicles sold that year.  In his 2011 State of the Union address, 
then–U.S. president Barack Obama called for 1 million EVs on the road by 2015, 
and a concurrent report by the Department of Energy claimed that the coun-
try’s production capacity in that year would reach 1.2 million units. But the 2015 
total came to 410,000 units, representing just 0.15 percent of all vehicles on the 
road, and sales of U.S. brands reached about 100,000 cars.  And this triumph of 
hope over experience continues. The worldwide total of EVs on the road reached 
2 million units in 2016. If you plot the trajectory of the global stock of EVs since 
the beginning of their sales to the year 2016, you will see that the equation that 
best fits the data (a fourth-order polynomial) projects about 32 million units in 
2025. But the International Energy Agency’s 2017 EV outlook estimates growth 
from 40 million to 70 million units worldwide by 2025 and from 160 million to 
200 million by 2030. Then there are the environmental consequences. If EVs are 
to reduce carbon emissions (and thus minimize the extent of global warming), 
their batteries must not be charged with electricity generated from the combus-
tion of fossil fuels. But in 2016, 68 percent of global electricity originated in fossil 
fuels; 5.2 percent came from wind and 
solar and the rest from hydro energy 
and nuclear fission. 
As a global mean, two-thirds of the 
electricity for an EV still comes from fos-
sil carbon, but that fraction varies widely 
among countries and within them. 
EVs in Norway and in the Canadian 
provinces of Manitoba and Quebec 
are charged by pure hydroelectricity, 
making them utterly clean hydro-cars. 
French EVs are largely nuclear-fission 
cars. But in most of India (particularly 
Uttar Pradesh), China (particularly 
Shaanxi province), and Poland, EVs 
are overwhelmingly coal cars. The last 
thing we need is to push for the rapid 
introduction of a source of demand that 
would summon even more fossil-fuel-
based electricity generation.
And even if EVs all ran on renewable 
sources of electricity, greenhouse gases 
would still be emitted during the produc-
tion of cement and steel for hydroelectric 
dams, wind turbines, and photovoltaic 
panels, and of course during the manu-
facture of the cars themselves. 
EV production will have other envi-
ronmental impacts. The Arthur D. 
Little management consultancy esti-
mates that—based on a vehicle life of 
20 years—the manufacture of an EV cre-
ates three times as much toxicity as it 
does for a conventional vehicle. This is 
mostly due to the greater use of heavy 
metals. Similarly, a detailed comparative 
life-cycle analysis, published in the Jour-
nal of Industrial Ecology, found the pro-
duction of EVs to involve substantially 
higher toxicity, both to human beings 
and to freshwater ecosystems.
I am not suggesting that these are 
arguments against the adoption of EVs. 
I am merely pointing out that the impli-
cations of the new technology must 
be appraised and understood before 
we accept any radical claims in its 
favor. We cannot simply imagine ideal, 
pollution-free machines and then will 
them into existence.  ■

I WROTE MY FIRST TECHNICALLY SPEAKING COLUMN WAY
back in June 2002. How long ago was that? Long ago enough that 
some companies that seem now to have been around forever weren’t 
even gleams in their founders’ eyes: Facebook, LinkedIn, Skype, 
Twitter, YouTube. Friendster was trying to persuade people to do social net-
working; Internet Explorer 6 was the dominant Web browser; and people were 
getting excited about Swiss army phones that—O brave new world!—could do 
more than just make and receive phone calls.  In 2002, we were so innocent. 
We thought the PDA was here to stay and that Wikipedia wouldn’t last. We didn’t 
foresee Web 2.0 or filter bubbles. We knew nothing about the wisdom of the 
crowd or the convenience of the cloud. There was no clickbait or CAPTCHAs,
no MOOCs. There had not yet been a single flash mob.  Language is a cultural 
phenomenon, so new additions to the lexicon must be telling us something about 
new aspects of the culture. To that end, let’s take a quick look at some words and 
phrases that first appeared in 2002. In that year, we coined caving (“staying inside 
one’s home as often as possible”) and binge viewing (“a period of excessive indul-
gence spent watching previously broadcast episodes of a TV show”). We first used 
blogosphere (“the collection of all bloggers, blog sites, blog readers, and blog 
text”) and Googleverse (“the products, services, and technologies belonging to 
or associated with Google and the Google search engine”). We started using selfie
(“a photographic self-portrait, particularly one taken with the intent of posting it 
online”) and microblogging (posting short thoughts and ideas to a personal blog”). 
You can feel 2002 in these words, but they’re also pregnant with the years to come.
 Is there a word or phrase that best captures the zeitgeist of the past 15 years? 
That’s a tough one. A few years back, the 
American Dialect Society voted for the 
Word of the Decade, meaning the years 
2000 to 2009. The winner? Google,
used as a verb (a usage I noted in my Feb-
ruary 2003 column). That was a good 
choice, but it’s not all-encompassing 
enough to stand as a linguistic marker 
for the age. With the iPhone now into its 
second decade, you could make a case 
for smartphone (see my October 2005
column), since we all carry one around 
these days, but our times are defined 
more by what we do with our phones. A 
cynic might therefore nominate iPhone 
zombie (from my December 2010 col-
umn), since what we really seem to do 
with our devices is put ourselves and 
others in danger by using them oblivi-
ously. But I’ll head in the opposite direc-
tion and go with the phrase information 
at your fingertips, which was the sub-
ject of my April 2009 column. Imagine: 
We now routinely carry the sum of the 
world’s knowledge (or close to it) in our 
pockets and purses. Of course, back in 
2002 we hadn’t heard the term fake 
news, either, so the information our 
fingertips are finding these days isn’t 
always good.
As you might have guessed by now 
from the nostalgia-fest above, this is my 
last column for IEEE Spectrum. I didn’t 
originate Technically Speaking—that 
honor belongs to the engineer Kevin 
Self, who wrote the column for its first 
10 years. But it is one of my proudest 
accomplishments that I exceeded that 
impressive feat of longevity by five 
years, making my tenure here second 
only to that of the venerable Robert W. 
Lucky. I enjoyed writing these columns, 
I got to work with some amazing people 
at the magazine, and I loved hearing 
your comments, kudos, and yes, even 
your criticisms. Technology remains 
culture’s greatest language-generating 
machine, and it has been my pleasure 
to look under the hood of that machine 
for these past 15 years. □

STANDING TALL: Dish antennas stand out against the sky at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory, in Western Australia. They’re 
part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathﬁnder telescope (ASKAP), which is equipped with special “phased array feeds”—sets of 
188 individual receivers that pick up radio signals reﬂected off the dishes, giving the telescope a wide ﬁeld of view.

the sun is harsh in Western Australia’s Murchison shire. In this land 
of unpaved roads, kangaroo tracks, and low, scrubby vegetation, visi-
tors can and sometimes do get lost. Nevertheless, here I am, a few 
hundred kilometers from the coast, standing on rusty red dirt, hid-
ing under my sun hat. I am visiting a future site of one of the most 
ambitious telescopes ever conceived. 
With just a hundred or so residents in an area bigger than the 
Netherlands, this piece of the Australian outback is something pre-
cious in a world swamped by wireless signals: an island of unusual 
calm, a clear window onto the cosmos. Back in the cool of our four-
wheel-drive vehicle, one of my guides, Antony Schinckel, is emphatic 
about the location’s merits. “We really found this one of the best 
areas on the planet,” he says. 
Schinckel, a telescope director with the Australian government’s 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, 
and his colleagues have already braved hostile conditions to turn 
a small portion of this vast territory into one of the world’s leading 
radio astronomy facilities. Heavy rains can cut deep ruts in roads 
to the site, making them all but impassible. At one point early on, 
Schinckel recalls, his car suffered four flat tires in the same day as it 
ran over one acacia tree stump after another.
But the hard work is now starting to pay off. Over the last eight 
years, astronomers and engineers have transformed land where cat-
tle once grazed into a kind of astronomical garden: the Murchison 
Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO). Dozens of gleaming-white 
12-meter-wide radio dishes, tailor-made for cataloging galaxies, now 
dot the landscape. They’re joined by thousands of spiderlike anten-
nas, which form a state-of-the-art array capable of picking up elec-
tromagnetic waves dating back almost to the start of the universe. 
These different kinds of antennas have been used to create two 
telescopes at MRO that are stretching the capabilities of radio astron-
omy. The telescopes are also the prelude to a much more ambi-
tious project: the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Already more than 
25 years in the making, the SKA promises to be a radio telescope 
of immense sensitivity, by virtue of a collecting area equivalent to 
more than (you guessed it) a square kilometer. When the project is 
complete, sometime in the early 2030s, it could encompass more 
than two thousand dishes in Africa and half a million or so anten-
nas in Western Australia, dwarfing the telescopes at the MRO and 
other such facilities. In the process, the SKA—a collaboration among 
10 member countries involving more than 500 engineers—will test 
the limits not only of telescope design but also of 
data processing pipelines, international coordina-
tion, and the infrastructure of big-science projects.
“Nobody’s ever built anything on the scale we’re 
attempting,” acknowledges SKA director-general 
Philip Diamond. But he and many other astrono-
mers think the effort will be well worth it. SKA’s 
sensitivity, resolution, and ability to scan large 
areas of the sky quickly will let it probe some of the 
universe’s most pressing mysteries. By cataloging 
vast numbers of galaxies through their hydrogen 
emissions, for example, the SKA is expected to 
help pin down the identity of dark energy, which 
is driving the universe to expand at an accelerating 
rate. The telescope will also be able to measure an 
unprecedented number of pulsars—spinning stel-
lar remnants that beam electromagnetic radiation 
out along their magnetic poles. When these cosmic 
beacons wind up in tight orbits around black holes, 
they can be used to hunt for evidence of new phys-
ics that might finally allow physicists to develop a 
unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity. 
Given its staggering scale, the SKA is proceeding 
in stages—beginning with a smaller incarnation 
called SKA1. Although just a fraction of the size of 
the SKA, this first iteration will still be the largest 
radio telescope in the world, Diamond says. Part 
of it will be built in South Africa and the other por-
tion here in Western Australia, and the two sites 
will operate—as the full SKA will—as two indepen-
dent telescopes. The South African component 
of SKA1 (known as SKA1-mid) will encompass 197 
radio dishes with diameters of 13.5 and 15 meters. 
Data from those dishes will be combined to study a 
range of targets, including pulsars and radio emis-
sions from hydrogen that sits relatively close to our 
own Milky Way galaxy.
Australia’s part, known as SKA1-low, aims to pick 
up lower-frequency radio waves, including ones that 
originated from a time, billions of years ago, when 
astronomical objects like stars first lit up the uni-
verse. To receive these waves, the telescope won’t 
use dishes. Instead, it will use many simple, fixed 
antennas designed to pick up signals over a very 
wide range of frequencies, including ones in the 
TV and FM bands that happen to coincide with the 
frequencies of some of the universe’s oldest light. 
To yoke those antennas together into a single pow-
erful telescope will require state-of-the-art ampli-
fication and signal processing (more on that later). 
At the MRO, astronomers are already hard at work 
testing prototype SKA antennas. A patch of anten-
nas was incomplete during my visit in June, but it 
already looked crowded. Dozens of the spindly 
2-meter-tall structures, which resemble little fir trees, 
were packed together in a messy steel miniforest.

LOW-FREQUENCY FOREST: To put SKA1-low’s technology through its paces, prototype antennas have been installed at the Murchison 
Radio-astronomy Observatory. Engineers Budi Juswardy, David Emrich, and Luke Horsley [bottom right] work on a system designed to 
funnel signals from as many as 256 antennas into one ﬁber, which will carry the signals to the next processing stage.

By 2024, the SKA team expects to install 
more than 131,000 of these treelike anten-
nas, grouped in clusters and extending 
into the desert for tens of kilometers along 
three spiral arms. The result won’t be 
much more photogenic than the test patch 
was. But if all goes well, the array could 
produce truly stunning results: the first 
detailed images of a universe as it was 
transforming from a murky sea of neutral 
hydrogen into something we’d recognize 
today—a black ocean of space studded 
with shining stars and galaxies. 
T
H E  I C O N S  of radio astron-
omy are its dishes. New 
Mexico’s Very Large Array, 
for example, with its orderly 
lines of 25-meter-diameter 
dishes, has shown up in sev-
eral motion pictures, most 
notably 1997’s Contact.
The dishes of the Very Large Array work 
much like an optical telescope does, by 
focusing incoming radio waves onto recep-
tors. But the radio band is wide, and a 
telescope design that works well in one 
swath of frequencies isn’t necessarily the 
best choice for another. Basic physics dic-
tates that the longer the wavelength to be 
picked up, the bigger the dish needed to 
maintain the same resolution. The upshot 
is that beyond a certain wavelength, com-
mon sense suggests a move to antennas 
that can directly receive the radio waves. 
The idea of doing radio astronomy with such antennas is not new. 
In the early 1930s, the technology enabled Karl Jansky to make the 
first detection of radio waves from beyond the solar system. Pulsars 
were discovered serendipitously in 1967, when their clockwork-like 
signals were detected using an array of dipole antennas outside 
Cambridge, in the United Kingdom. 
But at some point, says astronomer Randall Wayth, the longer wave-
lengths—the sort that are ideal for such fixed antenna arrays—fell out of 
vogue in radio astronomy. More recently, renewed interest in that part 
of the radio band is being spurred by astronomers’ desire to peer far 
back into the universe’s past. And, conveniently, they can now lean on 
a range of advances in digital electronics, signal processing, and com-
puting to create a new generation of arrays.
“It’s definitely a renaissance,” says Wayth, an associate professor at 
Curtin University, in Perth, and a senior research fellow at Western 
Australia’s International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. The 
general approach bears more than a passing resemblance to phased-
array radar systems and to the antenna arrays being developed for 
5G cellular networks. 
Wayth directs one of the telescopes at the leading edge of this revival: 
the Murchison Widefield Array, or MWA. As one of the official “pre-
cursor” telescopes for SKA, the MWA is helping 
to work out the kinks in combining many passive 
antennas into a single state-of-the-art telescope. 
As with SKA1-low, the Murchison Widefield 
Array’s antennas are designed to pick up radio 
waves at the lower end of frequencies used for 
radio astronomy. SKA1-low’s design calls for anten-
nas that are sensitive from 50 to 350 megahertz. 
MWA’s antennas detect signals in a somewhat nar-
rower range, from 80 to 300 MHz. In contrast with 
SKA1-low’s fir-tree antennas, those of the MWA call 
to mind sunbathing knee-high spiders. They’re 
on metal grids designed to reflect incoming radio 
waves back up to them.
Although their antennas look different, the 
Murchison Widefield Array and SKA1-low share 
the same basic approach as well as a big scientific 
ambition: gazing into a still-murky period in the 
early universe called the Epoch of Reionization. 
The name refers to a time, roughly 13 billion years 
ago and about a billion years after the big bang,

scope, based in the Netherlands. 
T
O  H U N T for signals from this 
epoch—or to perform any of 
its observations, actually—the 
Murchison Widefield Array 
sops up radio waves from 
many directions at once. 
Incoming signals are boosted 
at the center of each spidery antenna by 
a pair of low-noise amplifiers and then 
sent to a nearby “beamformer.” There, 
waveguides of various lengths, printed 
on circuit boards, impart delays to the 
antenna signals. With the right selec-
tion of delays, the beamformers virtu-
ally “tilt” the array, so that radio waves 
arriving from a particular patch of the 
sky all seem to reach the antennas at the same time—as they would if 
they were being received by a single large antenna. SKA1-low will do 
this entire process digitally, without the waveguides. That approach 
will enable it to construct multiple beams—as if the array were point-
ing to multiple spots in the sky simultaneously.
The MWA antennas are divided into groups. Signals from each 
group are sent to a single receiver that distributes the signals among 
various frequency channels and then sends them on to the observa-
tory’s central building over fiber. There, a set of field-programmable 
gate arrays and graphics processing units correlate the data, multi-
plying the signals from each receiver with those of every other one 
and integrating over time. This number crunching is the heart of 
interferometry, a process that combines the signals from multiple 
dishes or antennas to create a single strong signal, as though it came 
from one telescope.
Much like a single dish, the resolution of such a virtual telescope 
is inversely proportional to its physical size. Bigger is, of course, bet-
ter. In particular, for a virtual telescope consisting of a set of dishes 
or fixed antennas, the telescope’s maximum resolution is set by its 
longest baseline, or distance between a pair of elements. The longer 
that distance is, the finer the resolution.
SPIDER TOWN: Randall Wayth, an associate 
professor at Curtin University and director of the 
Murchison Wideﬁeld Array, crouches next to Tile 107 
of the telescope. An aerial photo of the MWA [above] 
shows more of the telescope’s tiles, each of which 
contains 16 of the spiderlike antennas.
when early stars and other objects heated neutral 
hydrogen atoms enough to knock their electrons 
off, transforming the cosmos from an opaque sea 
of neutral hydrogen into the transparent universe 
we see today. Remarkably, it’s still possible to detect 
radio waves emitted by those neutral hydrogen 
atoms. The waves were emitted with a wavelength 
of 21 centimeters, but by the time they reach Earth, 
billions of years of cosmic expansion will have 
stretched them to a couple of meters. 
The Murchison Widefield Array is racing to be the 
first telescope to detect those elongated echoes of 
the far-distant past. Astronomers hope the study of 
this radiation will help reveal more about how reion-
ization altered and shaped the early universe—for 
example, how structures like galaxies formed and 
changed in that pivotal epoch. “It’s one of the major 
phases during the evolution of the universe which 
is completely unknown,” says Benedetta Ciardi, an 
astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astro-
physics in Garching, Germany, and a staffer at one

want a new license to operate any sort of trans-
mitter within the zone must first consult with the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation. “The intention is to protect the site 
from 70 MHz to 25.25 gigahertz,” says Carol Wilson, 
spectrum manager for the MRO and a senior mem-
ber of the IEEE. Recently, she says, a team using 
the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder 
telescope, or ASKAP, which sits not far from the 
Murchison Widefield Array, found a gas cloud by 
observing a slight dip in the signal from a galaxy 
that emitted its light roughly 5 billion years ago. 
The dip in the signal was over a range of frequen-
cies completely covered by a cellphone band. “It 
would have been impossible to do that in a more 
populated area,” Wilson says. 
The designers of the Murchison Radio-astronomy 
Observatory have gone to great lengths to make 
sure the telescopes and associated 
equipment themselves don’t add to 
the problem. The observatory’s cen-
tral building—a one-story structure 
housing workshops, desks, racks of 
processors, and a maser used to dis-
tribute clock signals to the telescopes—
is completely wrapped in a continuous 
steel sheet. Fiber, power lines, and air 
pass into this Faraday cage through 
openings that are too narrow and long 
for a range of radio waves to traverse. 
The main entrance boasts a double-
doored vestibule that acts like an air-
lock for radio waves; anyone hoping 
to enter must lever one door closed 
before opening the other one.
Such precautions help make the 
site extraordinarily quiet. And the 
Murchison Widefield Array is taking advantage 
of that silence to hunt for the first indications of 
the Epoch of Reionization, which should show up 
in subtle changes in how neutral hydrogen is dis-
tributed over the sky. When SKA1-low arrives, it 
will be able to map this transition in greater detail, 
giving astronomers a glimpse of how ancient stars 
and galaxies brought the universe out of its dark 
ages and helped shape the cosmos we see today.

M P O R T A N T  C H A L L E N G E S  still must be 
overcome before workers even begin building 
SKA1-low, which could start in 2019 and con-
tinue for five years. A team of engineers is vali-
dating the antenna design, using a combination 
of simulation and measurements, in prepara-
tion for a key review next year. Antennas can 
interfere with one another, notes MWA director 
Wayth, and in some cases they can cause signals to 
Astronomers have used this property to construct virtual tele-
scopes that reach across continents, enabling resolutions so fine 
that they have been used to home in on the area around the super-
massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. But size isn’t the 
only consideration. A single pair of antennas, however far apart, will 
give you only a small piece of information about the light emitted 
from an object. To construct pictures, astronomers must fill out the 
array. More fixed antennas or dishes yield a combinatorial explosion 
of different baselines, which can then be used to create a telescope-
like image through a process called aperture synthesis. The imaging 
capabilities of such an array thus depend on several factors, including 
the total number of antennas, the span of the array, and the details 
of how the antennas are placed relative to one another. 
At the Murchison Widefield Array, the output from the observato-
ry’s servers is sent down hundreds of kilometers of fiber, first to the 
coastal city of Geraldton and then on for another 400 kilometers or 
so to a supercomputing center in Perth. 
The MWA can ship more than 25 terabytes of data a day to the 
Perth facility. But in the coming 
years, that data rate will be dwarfed 
by the output of SKA1-low. The array’s 
131,000 antennas will collectively 
produce upwards of a terabyte of data 
every second, says Keith Grainge, an 
astrophysicist at the University of 
Manchester, in England, who leads 
the SKA working group dedicated 
to signal and data movement. “It’s 
about an eighth of an Internet that 
we’ve got to transport,” Grainge says.
Once the data reaches Perth, it must 
be further processed in order to trans-
form it into sky maps and other scien-
tific products that astronomers can 
use. This is an exascale problem, says 
Andreas Wicenec, a professor at the 
University of Western Australia who 
is studying the computational needs of the project. Wicenec estimates 
that SKA1-low will need a supercomputer at least as fast as the current 
world-record holder, China’s Sunway TaihuLight. The only hitch is 
that this supercomputer must be significantly cheaper and consume 
just a fifth as much power as the Sunway TaihuLight, which can eat 
up 15 megawatts performing computations. 
Wicenec isn’t fazed. “If we don’t get such a machine,” he says, “we 
will still be able to do amazing science, just not the most challeng-
ing projects initially. That’s the advantage of radio astronomy,” he 
adds. “You can easily scale up and down and just do what’s currently 
affordable. A few years later we can then ramp up.”
T H E  S K A ’ S  S U C C E S S  will depend in part on making sure 
Murchison’s radio window stays as clear as possible. Cellular sig-
nals, electric motors, TV transmitters, arc welding, and many other 
sources of RF can interfere with observations. 
The site itself is protected as much as it can be from outside noise. 
A “radio-quiet zone” extends out to 260 km around the Murchison 
Radio-astronomy Observatory. Mining companies and others that

Some of the more far-flung patches of the array will likely 
get their own solar panels.
Maintenance is another challenge. These days, the 
Murchison Widefield Array gets hit by lightning about 
once a year, which might knock out a few sets of antennas 
and a receiver. But MWA’s antennas are all within a few 
kilometers of one another. The sheer number of SKA1-low 
antennas—along with the fact that they will be 2 meters 
tall and extend tens of kilometers from the center—could tax those 
maintaining the array. 
There is also the matter of money. At the moment, the budget 
for building SKA1 in South Africa and Australia is capped at about 
€675 million (about US $800 million, or about a billion Australian dol-
lars), an amount set by the project’s 10 member countries: Australia, 
Canada, China, India, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South 
Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. But that funding won’t 
cover the entire cost of SKA1 with the specifications that astronomers 
are hoping for. “Even though we’re looking at spending effectively a 
billion dollars on SKA phase 1,” says director-general Diamond, “you 
can’t do everything within even a billion.” He’s trying to recruit more 
countries into the partnership, which could boost funding. 
But if all goes well, Wayth says, SKA1-low should give radio astrono-
mers a factor-of-10 boost in telescope sensitivity and other capabilities. 
“It will be a sensational telescope,” he says. “My old boss once said radio 
astronomers don’t usually get out of bed for anything less than an order 
of magnitude. And in this case, there’s lots to get out of bed for.”  ■

cancel out, creating blind spots. “Right now we’re 
making sure we fully understand the electromagnet-
ics of how the stations work just to make sure noth-
ing unexpected pops up,” says Wayth, who is also 
part of the design team for the Australian SKA array.
But Wayth says most of the technical challenges 
have already been worked out. At this point, the 
biggest issues are logistics and infrastructure, 
he says. “It’s in the middle of nowhere, [and] it 
needs to have power and communications and 
timing and everything distributed to it.”
In South Africa, some of the dishes will be able 
to tap into local grid power, but in Australia, all the 
energy must be produced on site. Both observato-
ries aim to keep their carbon footprint to a mini-
mum. Until this year, the MRO had run on diesel 
generators. It now has 1.6 MW worth of solar pan-
els, and vast packs of lithium-ion batteries that can 
store 2.6 megawatt-hours—more than half of what 
SKA1-low will need when it is fully operational.

For Fridtjof Nansen, 13 April 1895 started well. 
Six days earlier, the Norwegian explorer had set a new record for the closest approach to 
the North Pole, and now he was moving quickly over unbroken sea ice toward Cape Fligely 
and home. But then came a sickening realization: In his eagerness to break camp, he had 
forgotten to wind the chronometers. He had lost track of precise time, and thus the abil-
ity to track his longitude.  Although Nansen couldn’t have lost his position by more than 
a few minutes, it forced him to take a circuitously conservative route to avoid being swept 
into the North Atlantic. His expedition thus had to endure a hungry winter, camped on an 
unknown shore. Not until June the following year did he encounter other explorers and 
learn his true position—on Cape Felder, in Franz Josef Land. 
Today, anyone with a smartphone can determine their 
time and position with ease. Satellites of the Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS) broadcast clock signals across the 
globe with uncertainties below 100 nanoseconds, or one 
ten-millionth of a second. These time signals carry the 
information needed for precise navigation: Because radio 
waves travel at exactly 0.299,792,458 meters per nano-
second (apart from minuscule variations due to refrac-
tion in the atmosphere), comparing signals from different 
satellites makes it possible to determine a position within 
a few meters. That’s why GPS has transformed seismic 
monitors, drone delivery, and many other applications.
But GPS can’t solve all timing problems. Central to 
the system are atomic clocks carried on each satellite. 
Although these clocks are extremely stable (and regularly 
calibrated by comparing them with ground-based atomic 
clocks at national standards laboratories), there are many 
ways to go wrong when transferring timing information 
to the user—jamming, spoofing, unintentional interfer-
ence, solar storms, even reflections from buildings. But 
what if we could put this precision directly in the hands 
of the user by shrinking the atomic clock itself so it could 
work inside the GPS receiver? Would we, like Nansen, then 
want to carry our very best clocks with us? 
ATOMIC CLOCKWORK: 
An atomic clock begins with 
an oscillator [see diagram], 
which creates a frequency 
close to the energy level of 
the atom being used. If the 
oscillator deviates from the 
reference frequency, the atom’s 
absorption pattern changes, 
the change is detected by a 
laser, and the laser’s signal is 
used as feedback to tune the 
oscillator. For the very best 
performance, the atoms must 
be electromagnetically isolated, 
which requires equipment that 
can take up entire rooms [see 
photo, right].

In research now published at Physical Review Letters,
we show that such a mobile clock is possible. We hope to 
make one soon. 
T
he core of an atomic clock is a vacuum chamber 
containing a thin cloud of vaporized metal, usu-
ally cesium. Atoms in the vapor resonate at a pre-
cise frequency, meaning that their electrons will accept 
energy only from photons having just the right amount 
of it. If those photons have a little too much or too little 
energy—that is, if their frequency is a little too high or too 
low—the absorption falls off markedly. This is the key fea-
ture of an atomic clock.
Here’s how it works. An electrical oscillator creates a 
microwave frequency very close to the energy level of 
the atom we are using for our clock. If the oscillator devi-
ates slightly from the correct frequency, the absorption 
changes, the change is detected by a laser, and the laser’s 
signal is used to tune the oscillator. This feedback loop 
corrects the oscillator’s imperfections.
Unlike the pendulum of a clock or the mechanical mech-
anism of a watch, atoms do not suffer from manufacturing 
error or wear; with proper isolation from the environ-
ment, their resonant frequency is set by the laws of phys-
ics. Achieving the necessary level of isolation in practice 
means that the best atomic clocks take up entire rooms. 
Commercial atomic clocks are usually the size of suitcases.
In 2004, in a tour de force of microfabrication, scientists 
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology man-
aged to shrink this entire setup into a stack of components 
a few millimeters high. Such “chip-scale” atomic clocks are 
now available commercially and are used in niche appli-
cations, such as military communications and underwater 
navigation. But this miniaturization comes at a price—and 
not just in manufacturing cost: Because so many of the 
atoms interact with the chamber walls, the tiny size of the 
vacuum chamber can lead to small changes in the clock fre-
quency, while the heater that generates the vapor consti-
tutes a hefty power drain for a portable device. It’ll be a long 
time before this technology makes it into your cellphone.
Fortunately, there is an alternative, proposed in 2008 
by Andrew Briggs and Arzhang Ardavan at the University 
of Oxford, in England. Instead of using a chamber to trap 
atoms, this method makes use of nature’s own trap: an 
endohedral fullerene. 
Endohedral fullerenes, or endofullerenes, are remark-
able molecules that almost seem to defy ordinary laws of 
chemical bonding. The outside is a fullerene (named after 
Buckminster Fuller, champion of the geodesic dome), a 
hollow ball of atoms that can function as a container. An 
atom or a smaller molecule can fit inside without bonding 
to the shell and is thus protected from its environment—
even though an atomic cage filled in this way has proper-
ties similar to those of an empty fullerene.
Without doubt the most extraordinary of any such 
endohedral fullerene is N@C60—a nitrogen atom inside a 
60-carbon fullerene cage, which resembles a soccer ball. 
It’s as though the nitrogen atom floats inside the fullerene, 
retaining its atomic characteristics. Noble gas elements, 
such as helium and neon, have also been incorporated in 
C60. These are very inert species, unlike nitrogen, which is 
one of the most reactive elements known. And it turns out 
that nitrogen is key for making an accurate atomic clock.
N@C60 is a molecule that, given the reactivity of nitro-
gen, should not exist. Nevertheless, there are several ways 
to synthesize N@C60. Extreme conditions are needed for 
all of these methods, because pushing the nitrogen atom 
through the carbon cage is thermodynamically unfavor-
able—the chemical equivalent of pushing water uphill. 
Once the molecule is formed, however, the fullerene cage 
isolates and stabilizes the nitrogen atom, so the products 
synthesized can be collected and stored.
At our laboratory at the University of Oxford, we make 
these caged molecules with what’s called ion implantation. 
Heat is used to vaporize fullerenes in a vacuum chamber, 
where they waft onto a surface. This process gradually 
builds up a C60 film on that surface.
While the C60 film is growing, nitrogen ions are shot 
onto the surface of the film. Some of those nitrogen ions 
get trapped in the growing C60 film, forming the desired 
molecule. The yield, however, is very low: For every mol-
ecule of N@C60, there will be about 10,000 molecules of 
nitrogenless C60.

Purifying N@C60 is hard because C60 and N@C60 are chemi-
cally almost identical. The key word here is almost. Small dif-
ferences in molecular weight and polarizability between the 
molecules mean that it’s possible to separate them by apply-
ing a technique called high-pressure liquid chromatography, 
or HPLC. We were the first to develop this technique in 2004, 
and we still do it in the same way at Designer Carbon Materi-
als, the company we spun off from Oxford in 2014. 
Our company has begun to sell N@C60 and other bespoke 
endohedral fullerenes to research groups around the world. 
If you need some, we’d be happy to sell you however much 
you want: We charge £200 million per gram. 
In standard chromatography, substances having differ-
ent chemical characteristics are separated by making them 
run a kind of gauntlet—an obstacle course that blocks the 
passage of one thing more than the other. HPLC works by 
using a pumped solvent (hence the term “high pressure”) 
to strip off the laid-down film of carbon fullerenes in such 
a way that the desired molecules—the fullerenes encasing 
nitrogen—are carried away preferentially. Because of the 
limited content of N@C60 in the crude mixture, this process 
must be repeated many times. That recycling can achieve 
complete separation between C60 and N@C60.
Back to the atomic clock: We start with an oscillator that 
generates a radio signal close to the frequency that the 
nitrogen will absorb. We transmit the signal via an antenna 
to a cell containing a sample of the molecules, either as a 
powder or in solution. If the oscillator is correctly tuned, 
power is absorbed. If we see a reduction in the absorbed 
power, we’ll know that the oscillator has drifted away from 
the target frequency. Using a feedback mechanism, the 
oscillator can then be tuned back to the point of maximum 
absorption. Because this frequency is precisely known, an 
accurate time reference follows by simply counting cycles 
of the stabilized oscillator. We manage the feedback by 
modulating the oscillator frequency and having the detec-
tor look at that modulation. If the oscillator is set correctly, 
the modulation of the output is zero; if the oscillator’s cen-
tral frequency has deviated, the sign of the output modu-
lation tells us which side of the resonance it has moved to.
Endohedral fullerenes such as N@C60 are outstand-
ing reference materials because, as we showed in 2006, 
the transitions between their quantum-mechanical spin 
states have some of the most precisely delineated frequen-
cies of any molecule. If you draw a graph of the materi-
als’ response to stimulating radiation, it will show a very 
narrow peak at the resonant frequency. Also, the fuller-
ene cage prevents the walls of the container from affect-
ing the frequency. One external influence does, however, 
penetrate the fullerene cage and can alter the relevant 
frequencies: a magnetic field. Because the world is full of 
uncontrolled magnetic fields—for example, from electric 
motors, steel vehicles, and Earth itself—protection from 
them is crucial for a stable clock. What Briggs and Ardavan 
realized is that for the N@C60 molecule, applying a small, 
static magnetic field can tune the energy levels in such 
a way that all magnetic influences on the resonance fre-
quency cancel each other out.
T
he point, of course, is to one day incorporate 
a complete atomic clock into one chip. In this 
design, the entire operation is based on radio-
frequency electronics, avoiding the need for optical ele-
ments, as used in conventional atomic clocks. And unlike 
a vapor-based clock, there would be no need to maintain 
a vacuum chamber and no power-hungry heater to drain 
a battery. An endofullerene-based atomic clock could thus 
be small, light, and energy efficient. Potentially, it could 
replace many of the quartz oscillators used in nearly every 
present-day electronic device to keep time.
Our progress toward that goal reached a key milestone 
this year, when we showed that the energy levels in our

carbon-shielded nitrogen ion are insensitive to magnetic 
field noise. We have not yet incorporated the material 
into a prototype clock, although we hope to do so soon. 
Historically, every generation of portable timekeepers 
has led to new possibilities. Early applications are likely 
to take advantage of the fact that a precise clock is also 
a precise frequency synthesizer. For example, in wire-
less communication, multiplexing channels into one fre-
quency band requires every transmitter to keep strictly 
to its assigned carrier frequency. (This is the reason that 
some cellphone towers are already equipped with atomic 
clocks.) As future networks, such as the Internet of Things, 
crowd into a limited spectrum, portable and stable clocks 
will become increasingly necessary. 
For a similar reason, GPS receivers will benefit from 
onboard clocks. This is perhaps surprising, given that the 
GPS signal itself carries time information, but it happens 
because the signal from the satellite is weak—comparable 
to the power of a lightbulb transmitted across a continent. 
Landscape features, buildings, and interference make it 
harder to detect. To track this weak signal, the receiver 
must precisely lock onto the broadcast frequency. The 
bistatic radar (in which an attacker stealthily acquires a 
radar signal from a target illuminated by a distant trans-
mitter), and sensitive monitoring of enemy communi-
cations. For these reasons, portable clocks are of great 
interest to militaries in several countries. 
Finally, there may be completely new applications. For 
example, warehouses, post offices, and even subways may 
in future be equipped with their own local positioning 
systems using small-scale wireless base stations. Parcels, 
equipment, and people could then be tracked without 
needing anyone to sign off on the delivery of a package 
or log its position at every location. Even driverless cars 
would benefit from an onboard device that keeps very 
accurate time in challenging terrains, such as tunnels, 
where satellite GPS signals are unavailable. 
For these possibilities to be realized, many elements must 
come together. First, it will be necessary to optimize the 
stability of the atomic resonance frequency on which the 
clock depends. For the technology to be competitive, the 
frequency fluctuations must be well below one part in a 
million, despite variations of temperature, magnetic field, 
and chemical environment. Second will be the task of min-

more stable the local frequency reference, the faster and 
more reliable this tracking can be. 
In hostile environments, such as battlefields, this 
becomes even more important. The GPS signal is vulner-
able to jamming, and effective (but illegal) jammers are 
widely available and likely to be encountered in future 
wars. With precise timing information, GPS receivers 
could isolate the true signal above the noise of the jam-
mer. The receivers could even allow navigation to survive 
partial destruction of the satellite network. 
Present-day receivers must determine their positions 
by using signals from four or more satellites simultane-
ously, but a sufficiently accurate clock could instead use 
successive signals from a single satellite. Other defense 
applications include frequency-hopping communication, 
iaturization—of shrinking sample cell, magnet, and radio-
frequency electronics down to a chip-scale device. Third 
is the need for low power consumption. Last is the need to 
manufacture endohedral fullerenes on an industrial scale, 
materials that so far exist only in milligram quantities.
Despite this, endohedral fullerenes are already starting 
to appear on the market. The technology firm LocatorX, 
of Jacksonville, Fla., has licensed the Oxford atomic-clock 
patent and is developing it for commercial use.
For miniaturized atomic clocks to be incorporated in 
everyday devices, we must push many different areas in 
science and engineering to their limits. But the rewards are 
fantastically important. We look forward to the day when the 
hearts of endohedral fullerenes beat time all around us.  □

THE L AST LINK: A microwave tower 
stands just above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. 
It was one of the final towers installed 
as part of a six-year project to improve 
connectivity in the Far North. The tower, 
which is still awaiting its antennas, will be 
powered by two diesel generators.

city just north of the Arctic Circle. 
Engines roaring, Annie pauses to steady 
its load, which had begun to sway below, 
and veers off toward a bald mountaintop. 
On the mountain, at a rocky site called 
Igichuk, a work crew has just finished 
setting up the tower’s base, dropped off 
earlier by Annie. Now, they’re focused 
on executing the most delicate delivery 
of the day, one of many difficult steps 
required to sink a single new telecom-
munications tower into the vast, road-
less Alaskan tundra. 
When Annie arrives, the pilot care-
fully dangles the new section of tower 
above its base. Below, four crew mem-
bers stand ready to guide it into position, 
strapped into harnesses with their feet 
braced against the base’s highest rung. 
Once the new section of tower is close 
enough, each crew member grabs a steel 
rope looped through one of its lowest 
joints and gently nudges the tower so 
that it is centered directly over the base. 
Within minutes, the section is lined up, 
its four metal feet perfectly aligned with 
the base’s corners. 
The crew works quickly to insert a sin-
gle bolt into each leg; they’ll go back and 
add more later. When they give the sign, 
the pilot releases the tower from Annie’s 
grasp, and pulls away. The tower stands, 
now the highest point across the tundra, 
and sparkles in the midday sun. Once 
active, it will relay data north to several 
hundred miners at Red Dog, the world’s 
largest zinc mine, and back to a tower in 
Kotzebue, a city of 3,245 built on a thin 
lip of spongy land that bows out into the 
Chukchi Sea along the isolated western 
rim of Alaska.
Here on the edge of the U.S. Arctic, 
Internet connectivity is a slow—and 
expensive—proposition. Eighty-one 
percent of rural residents in Alaska do 
not have broadband Internet, defined 
by the U.S. Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) as providing a min-
imum download speed of 25 megabits 
per second. People in Kotzebue have 
long relied on satellite connections for 
Internet service at speeds comparable 
to those of dial-up. At the beginning of 
the year, their average download speed 
was just 2 Mb/s.
The Igichuk tower is one of the final 
pieces of one of the most ambitious tele-
communications projects in the rural 
United States. Built by General Commu-
nication Inc. (GCI) and known as TERRA, 
it was completed this past October, after 
US $300 million of investment and six 
years of construction, when engineers 
installed its final microwave repeater. 
The network uses a combination of 
repeater data links and fiber optics

can still be deployed faster and more 
cheaply than fiber-optic cables in most 
of rural Alaska. But the project never-
theless took GCI a very long time and a 
lot of money to complete. It shows what 
a challenge it can be to build and main-
tain a communications network in one 
of the most remote areas in the world—
even when you are using the most tried-
and-true technology available. 
T
O DELIVER nationwide 
telephone service, AT&T 
and other telecommuni-
cations companies built 
vast microwave net-
to form a giant, 5,000-kilometer ring 
around southwest Alaska—a sparsely 
populated region with few paved 
roads and wilderness areas larger than 
West Virginia. 
With TERRA, Kotzebue residents now 
pay $59.99 per month for an Internet 
plan with download speeds of 3 Mb/s, 
which is not even fast enough to stream 
a high-definition movie. To be able to 
do that, they would need to pay at least 
$149.99 per month for 6 Mb/s. Compare 
that with New York City, where resi-
dents pay an average of $55 per month 
for 25 Mb/s. 
So was it worth $300 million to bring 
slightly better Internet to approximately 
45,000 people in 84 rural villages spread 
out over an area roughly the size of 
Germany? For GCI, it was a strategic 
move. The project was completed as 
more customers began to watch more 
content online. Large clients such as 
hospitals and schools in rural commu-
nities also needed better access to the 
outside world. Partly thanks to TERRA, 
the company welcomed $12 million in 
new revenue for Internet service in the 
first three quarters of 2017, while losing 
$8 million from its cable-TV division. 
Connecting remote areas has also 
become a hot topic among tech-industry 
titans, which are all developing com-
peting last-mile solutions, such as 
Facebook’s Internet delivery drone 
and Alphabet’s high-altitude balloons. 
Some analysts downplay those projects 
as flashy experiments. Other experts 
have argued that the world must keep 
building conventional networks to serve 
hard-to-reach areas, just in case those 
blue-sky ideas don’t pan out. 
TERRA relies primarily on 109 micro-
wave towers, a classic technology that

neer for TERRA at GCI. All told, the ring 
and the spurs connect dozens of tiny vil-
lages, among them the famous gold-rush 
town of Nome, and also Shaktoolik (popu-
lation 258) and Shageluk (population 81). 
Annie and the other Aircranes, as 
they’re known, have been a key tech-
nology used by GCI and STG—the con-
tractor that oversaw many TERRA tower 
installations—to reach such remote and 
offbeat places. Annie is a beast, burn-
ing more than 2,000 liters of fuel per 
hour and capable of carrying 11,000 
kilograms on its hook. Manufactured 
by Erickson, only 20 Aircranes like it 
exist in the world. 
During its first season of construc-
tion, STG used a gin pole, a common 
way to erect a telecom tower in sections 
without using a helicopter, at the most 
remote sites. But it took crews two to 
three weeks to install a tower. “With an 
Aircrane coming in, we can stack a tower 
as fast as it can bring the equipment in,” 
says Brennan Walsh, president of STG. 
The real problem at those remote sites 
is power: Most of them are far away from 
the electrical grid. Rebecca  Markley, 
GCI’s director for rural initiatives, says 
the company considered installing solar 
arrays to power those towers, but soon 
found the arrays would take up too 
permafrost covers 85 percent of the land, 
and where undersea cables are occasion-
ally sliced by fishing trawls or sea ice 
that forms along the coast each winter. 
TERRA does include about 700 km 
of fiber, most of it buried around 
Anchorage and along Alaska’s limited 
road system. For one stretch, a diver 
even laid fiber across the bottom of the 
still-frozen Kvichak River, in an area fre-
quented by brown bears.
But TERRA relies on microwaves in 
a way that hardly any other new large-
scale networks have since the 1990s. And 
because there is no road system through-
out much of Alaska, each of those micro-
wave towers had to be flown or barged in. 
Some were installed in villages, and 23 
were hoisted to mountaintop sites like 
Igichuk by a small fleet of helicopters. 
These towers, all 109 of them, poke up 
every 15 to 65 km in the Alaskan bush. 
Extending outward from this main ring, 
several spurs connect half a dozen villages 
each. “Using microwaves, we can kind of 
look at it as island hopping, where we hop 
from island to island to provide service 
and get over larger stretches of wilder-
ness,” says Patrick Goodyear, senior engi-
FAIRBANKS
works across the United States in the 
1950s. They put up thousands of towers 
and repeaters to provide long-haul links 
between communities. 
Over the past couple of decades, those 
microwave networks have been steadily 
replaced by fiber optics, which provide 
much greater bandwidth and therefore 
far higher data speeds. So now, the 
United States has some 182,000 km of 
long-haul fiber-optic cables, and micro-
wave cell towers are increasingly rel-
egated to shepherding data between 
customers and the nearest cable. 
However, burying fiber-optic cables 
is extremely difficult in Alaska, a state 
divided by three major mountain ranges 
and half a dozen minor ones, where

much room at the sites, some of which 
are barely big enough for a helicopter 
to land. 
Back at Igichuk, Annie dropped off two 
diesel-fueled generators that will keep 
the new site running around the clock. 
Later, a smaller helicopter equipped 
with a giant fuel bladder would make 
30 round trips to fill a 34,000-liter tank 
with fuel. That’s enough diesel to run 
the tower for 15 months. 
Specifying such a long run time is typi-
cal of GCI’s design philosophy for the 
TERRA project, in which each site has 
been built with multiple layers of hard-
ware redundancy along with special 
adaptations to help it weather extreme 
conditions. For example, each moun-
taintop tower has a backup generator, 
along with a rack of 48 lead-acid batter-
ies that can keep the tower operating 
for at least two days, should the backup 
generator also fail. 
That kind of fault-tolerant approach to 
system design has already paid off. One 
November, at a mountaintop site called 
Cone Shoulder, a ground fault caused 
both generators to fail in the middle 
of a blizzard. The site ran on batteries 
until technicians could repair it, three 
days later. 
The HVAC systems at each mountain-
top site also have twice as many fans and 
vents as they need to cool the commu-
nications modules. And the router box, 
which manages radio traffic and con-
trols the HVAC system, contains multiple 
modules that can handle all the neces-
sary functions for the radios and HVAC 
control, just in case one module fails.
Because many of the towers are built 
on permafrost, they could tilt perilously 
should the ground ever thaw. To pre-
vent this, GCI employed a technique also 
used for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and 
installed passive refrigeration devices 
called thermosyphons in the pilings on 
which the towers rest. Thermosyphons 
are partially buried, with a portion stick-
ing up into the air. They are tubes filled 
with gas that cools above ground and 
condenses into a liquid, which then evap-
orates. That evaporation sucks heat out of 
the ground, making sure it stays frozen. 
Ultimately, one of TERRA’s greatest 
strengths comes from its shape. Circles 
or rings create extra resiliency within 
a network: If one site does go down, all 
the traffic can be immediately routed in 
the opposite direction, taking the long 
way around the ring but ultimately get-
ting where it needs to go. 
So far, TERRA’s rigorously fault-
tolerant hardware has survived every-
thing the forbidding Alaskan wild could 
throw at it. But the software? That’s 
another story. 
S
OFTWARE HAS made 
networks more flexible 
and responsive—and 
TERRA is no exception. 
In the network, basic 
characteristics of the microwave chan-
nels are configured by software scripts. 
For example, software defines the fre-
quency and amplitude of the carrier 
wave on which a signal is transmitted. 
THE EDGE OF THE A RCTIC:
On the lip of the vast open tundra, 
homes and businesses in Kotzebue 
are packed closely together, making 
the whole town seem as though it’s 
huddled together for warmth.

The network handles traffic based on 
priority levels assigned through soft-
ware. “Software controls just about 
everything,” Goodyear says.
Unfortunately, that also means faulty 
software can knock out a site or disrupt 
multiple portions of the network. A few 
years ago, while technicians were trying 
to upgrade one stretch of towers, a soft-
ware bug caused the radios to spontane-
ously reset and pushed GCI nine months 
behind schedule. 
These problems notwithstanding, soft-
ware is at the very heart of the TERRA 
network’s ability to function in the face 
of the Arctic’s environmental and cli-
matic extremes. Thanks to software, GCI 
can remotely route all traffic through 
one tower if another one malfunctions. 
And software helps the network respond 
to weather, altering signals when there’s 
more fog or rain, in ways that minimize 
signal attenuation.
At GCI’s office in Anchorage, senior 
engineer Goodyear pulls up a photo of 
a microwave tower high in the Askinuk 
Mountains on the western coast of 
Alaska. The bottom half is buried in 
2.5 meters of snow. “This is pretty typ-
ical for this site in the early spring,” he 
says. He flips to another photo [above, 
inset] that shows the top half of the same 
tower completely iced over from chilly 
coastal winds that whip up moisture 
from the Bering Sea.
Snow and ice absorb and reflect radio 
waves, impeding an antenna’s ability to 
receive and transmit signals. Goodyear 
estimates GCI poured $2 million into 
combating that problem at the Askinuk 
Mountains site in its first two years. He 
points to the small triangles above each 
antenna in the second photo; they’re 
basically metal hats meant to keep snow 
and ice from accumulating. 
Crews had also installed long metal 
plates to shield the tower’s waveguides 
from falling ice. Microwaves travel 
through waveguides—which are hol-
low metal tubes—when they are mov-
ing between amplifiers and antennas, for 
example. But in frigid climates, moisture 
can accumulate inside them and cause 
them to freeze up, so at particularly vul-
nerable TERRA sites a special dehydra-
tor pushes air through the waveguides 
to keep the moisture out.
Despite all of these efforts, one 
antenna is still missing from the tower in 
the photo, and the waveguide that runs 
to it sticks out awkwardly into the cold 
air. Ice had built up, warmed in the sun, 
slid down the tower, and popped the 
antenna right off. 
Through software, GCI was able to 
remotely reroute traffic from the disabled 
antenna to go through two antennas 
placed higher up on the tower, to keep 
the site running. Since then, Goodyear’s 
team has slashed the height of that tower 
COLD CA LL: TERRA’s 109 microwave 
towers must withstand snow, ice, and 
extreme cold. In the Askinuk Mountains 
[inset], a black waveguide pokes out 
from the right side of the tower, where 
an antenna had been mounted before 
snow and ice popped it off.

to limit its exposure to icy gales. So far, 
that fix seems to be working. 
GCI engineers have also made hard-
ware adjustments to improve signal 
strength across the network when a site 
is working but not as well as it could. 
For example, near a coastal town called 
Quinhagak (population 669), a tower sits 
high up on the shoulder of a mountain, 
with barely enough room for a helicopter 
to land next to it. To save space, the GCI 
crew initially installed a shorter tower 
with 1.8-meter antennas. 
But a reflection point on nearby 
Kuskokwim Bay soon began to impede 
service to the next tower. Occasionally, 
when the tide was just the right height, 
a few stray microwaves would bounce 
off the bay and right into that tower’s 
antenna. But they arrived later than the 
microwaves that traveled straight over, 
causing the two signals to destructively 
interfere with each other. 
So now GCI is upgrading that site to 
3-meter antennas, which will not “see” 
the reflection point from the same angle 
as the smaller antennas. If all goes well, 
this geometry will cut back on the 
reflected microwaves. 
T
O BUILD ANYTHING in 
Alaska requires a certain 
amount of fortitude. 
Looking back, GCI’s 
 Markley says, “there 
have been lots of times where we were 
thinking, ‘Are we actually going to be 
able to do this?’ ” 
No other company had ever thought it 
economically feasible to deliver terres-
trial Internet to this remote part of Alaska. 
If TERRA had been built in the contigu-
ous United States, it would stretch from 
Washington, D.C. to Seattle. But it will 
serve about as many customers as live in 
Twin Falls, a small city in Idaho. 
TERRA was made possible by a patch-
work of federal grants, loans, and 
subsidies. Heather Handyside, GCI’s 
communications director, acknowledges 
TERRA wouldn’t have been built without 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act, signed into law in 2009. Through 
it, the federal government contributed 
$82 million in grants and loans to the 
$300 million project. GCI also secured 
about $35 million in federally supported 
loans through the New Markets Tax Credit 
program, and received another $6 million 
federal grant for the project.
On top of all that, GCI collects more 
federal money through the federal gov-
ernment’s E-Rate Program, which sub-
sidizes telecommunications costs for 
schools and libraries. The company says 
TERRA provides a path for rural Alas-
kans to access distance learning, take 
advantage of telemedicine, and diversify 
their economy by telecommuting or sell-
ing handicrafts on retail sites like Etsy.
Even with all that support, the rates 
that TERRA customers pay remain much 
higher than elsewhere in the United 
States. The most expensive GCI plan 
for Kotzebue costs $300 a month for 
speeds that are about 8 percent those 
of the least expensive Anchorage plan, 
which is $65 a month. GCI points out 
that speed is only part of the picture: 
TERRA has reduced latency from 550 to 
25 milliseconds for rural customers, 
making it much easier to hold video 
conferences. (Several Alaska Native cor-
porations and organizations contacted 
for this story, including NANA Regional 
Corp., which serves Kotzebue, declined 
to comment on TERRA or GCI’s rates.) 
After years of neglect by telecommu-
nications companies, rural Alaska is 
now attracting interest. GCI is facing 
competition in at least a small slice of 
TERRA’s service area. A company called 
Quintillion recently installed a subsea 
fiber-optic cable to provide broadband 
to villages along the northwest coast of 
Alaska, the first phase of a cable that will 
stretch from Tokyo to London.
That’s good news for Alaskan customers, 
and bad timing for GCI. The final repeater 
in the TERRA network was switched on 
in October, at a site coincidentally labeled 
on the TERRA map as Final Repeater for 
its proximity to Final Mountain.
Now in place, the TERRA towers have 
an expected life-span of 50 to 60 years. 
During that time, several new generations 
of wireless technology will come along, 
requiring GCI to upgrade its equipment. 
Already, crews have begun to replace gen-
erators at the earliest sites, which have 
reached the end of their five-year life-span. 
With TERRA up and running, GCI’s 
investment has finally begun to pay off, 
and many Alaskans are sure to benefit 
from their access to it. Before long, they 
could start to demand even more data 
and faster speeds. But given TERRA’s con-
straints, GCI may struggle to deliver it in a 
timely manner and at an affordable price. 
Meanwhile, Quintillion or another 
competitor could take on the herculean 
task of burying more fiber across Alaska—
that is, if Facebook and Alphabet don’t 
figure out how to offer broadband cover-
age cheaply by balloon or drone. 
GCI does sell capacity on TERRA to 
other telecom companies, which should 
further expand access for residents, but 
competitors say the price GCI charges 
is too high and accuse it of holding a 
monopoly over Internet service through-
out much of rural Alaska. Several com-
petitors, including a coalition of rural 
telecom providers, have complained to 
the FCC about GCI’s wholesale pricing. 
Given all of this, there would seem to 
be ample room for a clever company to 
devise a way to bring faster, cheaper con-
nectivity to the Far North. Developing 
it would certainly not be for the faint of 
heart, and it may always be an economi-
cally risky proposition. But it could also 
represent a true breakthrough, reach-
ing the dozens of Alaskan villages that 
still remain without terrestrial Internet 
of any kind.  ■

Since the early days of the 
World Wide Web, a lot of smart, 
passionate people have wanted 
to make it into a vehicle for run-
ning almost any kind of pro-
gram. What makes that dream 
so tantalizing is that the Web is 
different from other software 
platforms. It’s defined by open 
standards, so anyone can build 
on it. It’s not owned by any 
company, so developers are 
beholden only to their users. 
And it’s constructed largely 
around open-source technol-
ogies, so it has the potential to 
be very democratic.
Over the past three decades, 
a whole generation of develop-
ers has worked to make this 
vision a reality. We’ve added 
new capabilities to the Web, 
like audio and video streaming, 2D and 3D 
graphics, typography, peer-to-peer com-
munication, data storage, offline browsing, 
as well as multitouch, location, and cam-
era inputs. But we continue to struggle 
with performance, specifically the abil-
ity to run Web applications as quickly as 
non-Web applications.
Seven years ago, the team I work with at 
Mozilla chose to focus on one of the oldest 
and hardest obstacles to progress: the per-
formance of the JavaScript programming 
language. JavaScript is one of three pillars 
of modern Web pages, which use Hyper-
text Markup Language (HTML) to describe 
their layout, cascading style sheets (CSS) to 
specify how their components are styled, 
and JavaScript code to provide a variety 
of rich interactive experiences.
We overcame this hurdle in two ways. 
First, my colleagues and I were able to 
make giant, complex programs run almost 
as fast inside a browser as they do when 
installed directly on computers. Then, 
we worked with other browser compa-
nies to create a new Web standard called 
WebAssembly, making safe and efficient-by-
design code now officially part of the Web.
Before we began this journey, Web 
developers had two choices. They 
could use existing Web technologies—
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to create 
an application that ran on existing Web 
browsers. Or they could create a browser 
plug-in that users would have to download 
and install. Neither approach was ideal. 
The first option was convenient, sim-
ple, and safe for users. But it delivered 
a janky experience for compute-heavy 
applications: Visuals would freeze, audio 
would drop, and apps would take sec-
onds or longer to respond to user input. 
Plug-ins let browsers run programs—
even demanding video games—smoothly 
and quickly, but they require users to 
download and install software. And such 
downloads can inject malicious code 
into the user’s system. Plus, browser 
plug-ins run only on the specific brows-
ers they are developed for. So if you are 
using another type of browser, you’re 
out of luck.
WebAssembly now provides a new 
option.It takes advantage of the technolo-
gies already present on the Web—JavaScript, 
the engines that run JavaScript inside 
browsers, and established browser secu-
rity properties—and optimizes things so 
that code can be read and executed faster.
This approach made it easier to gain 
support from other browser companies 
because it meant less work and less risk 
for them. Today, Mozilla Firefox, Google 
Chrome, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge
all provide support for WebAssembly in 
their most recent versions. So you can 
expect the Web to be immensely more 
powerful from here on out. Here’s how 
that change came about. 
LIKE A LOT OF STORIES about tech inno-
vation, this one started with video games. 
The thinking from team leader Martin Best 
of Mozilla was this: If we could make games 
run well on the Web, other computationally 
intensive applications would soon follow. 
When Mozilla began its games program,
a lot of its engineers focused their efforts, 
naturally enough, on JavaScript perfor-
mance.It was an intense and exciting time, 
with people using cutting-edge academic 
research and an array of optimization 
techniques from industry. With these, our 
team was able to speed up JavaScript so it 
could deliver something close to a native-
software experience, the gold standard.
The problem was that these per-
formance gains weren’t consistent. 
Sometimes the code ran really fast, 
but sometimes it didn’t. The design of 
JavaScript made it difficult to determine 
when and where the slowdowns were 
occurring, and it was almost impossible 
to predict when they’d crop up.
My Mozilla colleague Alon Zakai had 
a wacky idea that could address such 
problems: He wanted to take a game he

What if you could share a computer-aided design (CAD) model and even allow a colleague to manipulate it 
from afar? “Click on this link, check out my design, and feel free to add more holes or ﬁll some in,” you might say. You 
wouldn’t have to instruct your distant coworker to install special software or worry about whether her operating system 
could run it. Imagine that all your programs and data were stored in the cloud and that even computationally intensive 
applications like multimedia editing ran just as well in your browser as they would if they had been installed locally.

had helped write in C++ and convert it to 
JavaScript code that would run well on the 
Web. This was in 2010, and back then, con-
verting C++ to JavaScript was unthinkable. 
Games written in C++ can be huge pro-
grams, with millions of lines of code, far 
too many for JavaScript to handle well 
in those days. Worse, 
games stress the under-
lying platform, because 
they have several differ-
ent components—audio, 
video, physics, artificial 
intelligence—that need 
to run in a coordinated 
way. It was a complete 
mystery to everyone how 
all these computationally 
intensive functions could 
make the leap from a fast 
and powerful language 
like C++ to JavaScript, a 
Web language originally 
designed to view light-
weight hypertext documents. 
At the time, even Zakai thought it was a 
strange idea. But he didn’t want to rewrite 
his game line by line in JavaScript, and 
he was curious: Could it be done? So he 
started working to adapt an open-source 
tool that could translate C++ code into 
JavaScript automatically. He called his 
project Emscripten, which is a mash-up 
of “script” from JavaScript and “embiggen” 
from the TV show “The  Simpsons.” 
(Springfield’s motto: “A noble spirit 
embiggens the smallest man.”)
Zakai worked on Emscripten for two 
years, first as a side project, and then as 
part of Mozilla’s games program. And 
team leader Best discovered that large 
game companies elsewhere were experi-
encing the same pain as Zakai: They didn’t 
want to spend time and money rewriting 
their massive games in JavaScript so that 
they would run on the Web. 
So Zakai kept going with Emscripten 
until it worked. The first time he dem-
onstrated his C++ game running in the 
browser, it shocked everyone in the room. 
When it popped up on the screen, all the 
components were there: graphics, audio, 
a changing 3D perspective, multiplayer 
interactions, and a choice of weapons. 
If there had been any doubts before, his 
demo put them to rest. In seconds, the 
other team members went online, clicked 
into the game, and started shooting rock-
ets at one another in happy amazement.
What was even more surprising was that 
this JavaScript code ran incredibly fast—
faster even than handwritten JavaScript. 
You would have expected 
that code automatically 
translated from one lan-
guage to another would be 
messier and slower than 
code written by experi-
enced programmers, who 
can analyze and optimize 
as they go. But that wasn’t 
the case.
What was going on? To 
understand the answer, 
you need to know that writ-
ing C++ requires program-
mers to create objects with 
precise characteristics. By 
comparison, JavaScript is 
permissive and highly flexible. It turns 
out that during the translation step, 
Emscripten preserved the strictness of 
the C++, allowing the resulting JavaScript 
to run more efficiently. It 
was a monumental result.
WITH EMSCRIPTEN basi-
cally working, Best wanted 
to see what it could do 
for commercial software. 
Could it translate a large, 
industrial-strength game 
to run on the Web? Devel-
opers of a popular game 
engine called Unity invited 
us to work alongside them 
in an experimental sprint 
to see how far we could get. 
To everyone’s surprise, 
our combined team got the Unity game 
engine online inside a week. But the 
demo took half a minute to load, and 
when it ran, it stuttered mightily. We soon 
diagnosed the problem: The browser 
engine was getting bogged down because 
it needed to parse, analyze, and optimize 
the  Emscripten-generated JavaScript as 
it was running.
Here’s where my part comes in. I work 
on the performance of the JavaScript 
engine in Firefox. AsI studied the problem, 
I discovered that it is possible to form a 
contract of sorts between Emscripten and 
the engine that runs the code Emscripten 
produces: If you feed the engine only cer-
tain specific patterns of input, the engine 
can reliably run it really, really fast. 
I shared this discovery with Best and 
suggested that Zakai modify Emscripten 
to output only those patterns that run fast. 
Meanwhile, I would optimize the JavaScript 
engine in Firefox to run the resulting code 
even faster. Best was almost as excited as 
I was. With a “Make it so!” from him and 
Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript 
and then chief technical officer of Mozilla, 
I started pursuing this new avenue.
Working with Zakai and enlisting the 
help of Mozilla research director Dave 
Herman, we were able to formalize the 
permitted JavaScript patterns, to make 
the contract between Emscripten and 
the browser completely clear. We named 
the resulting subset of JavaScript asm.js, 
which became a distinct language in itself 
(“asm” being the programmer abbrevi-
ation for Assembly, a type of code that 
is very close to the CPU’s machine lan-
guage, and “.js” being 
short for JavaScript).
The new asm.js made 
things run faster because 
JavaScript is what’s 
called a dynamically 
typed language. That 
means that the kind of 
data denoted by a vari-
able isn’t necessarily 
known until the program 
is already running, mak-
ing it harder for a com-
puter to optimize ahead 
of time the code that is 
soon to be executed.
To make JavaScript faster, we needed 
to create a static type system for the 
language, meaning that the code has to 
declare up front what kind of data it acts 
on. Is this variable a number, a string 
of characters, or a more complicated 
object? Static typing asks the program-
mer to do some preliminary work to 
answer that question.
After a few months of programming, 
I had the optimizations for asm.js work-

ing in Firefox, and we were ready to try 
it out, this time on another equally beefy 
game platform, Epic’s Unreal Engine.
It took just a few days to get the entire 
multimillion-line code base running inside 
the Firefox browser—the required work 
involving things like audio and graphics, 
which are supported in a browser differ-
ently than they are in a computer’s native 
operating system.
Our results were better than expected. 
The animation was buttery smooth right 
from the start. When we saw that, there 
were cheers and high fives all around. It 
was as though the final puzzle piece to 
years of work had fallen into place.
Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, commented 
that he’d known it’d be possible to run 
such games in a browser, but he didn’t 
think it would come so soon. A few 
weeks later, we demonstrated some 
Unreal Engine games at the 2013 Game 
Developer Conference, showing for 
the first time a major game engine run-
ning well in a browser without the aid 
of plug-ins. 
But we didn’t want asm.js or the opti-
mizations used to run it to be exclusively 
for Firefox users. So we published the 
full specification of asm.js and actively 
encouraged other browser makers to 
add the same optimizations we were 
using. From 2013 to 2015, all four of the 
main browser engines improved perfor-
mance dramatically in the way they ran 
asm.js, with the Microsoft Edge browser 
importing parts of Firefox’s open-source 
asm.js-optimization code.
Soon games translated by  Emscripten 
into asm.js started appearing online. 
Popular Facebook games like Papa Pear 
Saga, Top Eleven, Cloud Raiders, and 
Candy Crush Saga use asm.js under the 
hood.And as predicted, once games dem-
onstrated what was possible, many other 
uses followed. 
Facebook, for example, now uses asm.js 
to compress users’ images in the browser 
before upload, saving bandwidth. Adobe
compiled a core image-editing library writ-
ten in C++ to asm.js for the Web version 
of Lightroom. And Wikipedia uses asm.js 
to play video formats when the browser 
doesn’t provide built-in support. Other 
Web uses now include computer vision, 
3D mapping, user-interface design, lan-
guage detection, audio mixing, digital 
signal processing, medical imaging, physi-
cal simulation, encryption, compression, 
and computer algebra.
THESE DEVELOPMENTS were won-
derful, but it eventually became clear 
that to move forward, we had to cre-
ate a new Web standard that would be 
more efficient to load than asm.js code. 
In particular, the new standard would 
replace spelled-out names for variables 
and instructions with a much more com-
pact representation: binary numbers. 
The new standard could also allow us to 
address some smaller issues that users 
had found with asm.js—they wanted 
features like 64-bit integer arithmetic 
and the ability to break an application 
into smaller chunks that could be down-
loaded and optimized separately. Thus, 
the idea for WebAssembly was born.

At the outset of Mozilla’s games pro-
gram, there were competing propos-
als for standards of this sort, but none 
were quite right. You might think that one 
more proposal added to the fray would 
also go nowhere. But with asm.js already 
being widely used, we had the unique 
opportunity to capture that momen-
tum and channel it into WebAssembly. 
If some browsers took a while to support 
WebAssembly (“wasm”) code, it would 
be easy for developers to produce both 
asm.js and wasm, just by flipping a switch 
in Emscripten. So they could always use 
asm.js, which ran everywhere, and send 
wasm only to browsers that could run it.
The next step was to convince the other 
browser makers that WebAssembly was 
a good idea. In some cases, this was sur-
prisingly easy, because engineers at these 
companies had already been contem-
plating similar ideas themselves. Other 
cases involved long discussions over 
beers, flights to meet teams and convince 
managers, and a very kumbaya sit-down 
at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Gardens
during a Game Developer Conference. By 
2015, everyone was finally on board and 
ready to officially embark on creating a 
new Web standard. 
That process began with the creation 
of a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
Community Group made up of engineers 
from the four major browser companies 
and other interested parties. We agreed 
that it would be unwise to try to solve every 
problem at once, because it would then 
take five years or more just to produce the 
specification. So from the outset our group 
adopted the goal of specifying and ship-
ping what startup mavens call a “minimum 
viable product,” or MVP. We could then 
iteratively improve it based on feedback. 
This brings us to the present. Browser 
companies have agreed on an initial MVP 
version of WebAssembly and have released 
compatible implementations. Emscripten 
can take code written in C++ and convert 
it directly into WebAssembly. And there 
will be ways in time to run other languages 
as well, including Rust,Lua, Python, Java,
andC#. With WebAssembly, multimillion-
line code bases can now load in a few sec-
onds and then run at 80 percent of the 
speed of native programs. And both load 
time and execution speed are expected to 
improve as the browser engines that run 
the code are made better.
THE WEBASSEMBLY Community Group 
has big plans. We are currently working to 
add features that can exploit the parallel 
processing that is possible with multicore 
CPUs. And we want to provide first-class 
tooling and performance for many lan-
guages, thereby giving developers the 
same freedom they have when they are 
writing code for native platforms.
Looking back to the original dream of 
allowing the Web to run all manner of 
programs just as well as if they had been 
installed locally, my colleagues and I can 
see there is still a lot of work left to do. 
But with WebAssembly, we’re happy to 
be one giant step closer to that goal.  □

PAST FORWARD_BY DAVID C. BROCK
In 1950, physicist Arnold Nordsieck built this analog computer 
from US $700 worth of surplus parts. To program the machine, which solved 
differential equations, you plugged in the tangle of cords in speciﬁc patterns. 
Caution was advised. “Once one end of a cord is plugged in, the prongs of 
the free plug may have up to 105 volts of potential difference between them,” 
Nordsieck noted in a memo. “Hence the operator should hold the live plug in 
such a way that the prongs do not touch him or anyone else or any metal.”  □

Y
our future ahead is filled with endless possibilities.
The technology work you do and higher earning income 
potential will afford you and your family a comfortable 
standard of living. But what would happen to that lifestyle 
if something happened to you? How would your family 
maintain it without your help and income?
Every day you face countless risks. An accident or an 
unexpected illness could happen at any time and could 
impact your family’s finances and lifestyle. That’s why 
life insurance is an important part of your future 
financial planning. Yet, according to a recent study, 
one in five households with children under age 18 are 
uninsured and an average of 62% of these households 
say they would be in immediate financial trouble if a 
primary wage earner died.*
IEEE wants to help make sure you’re prepared. That’s
why through the IEEE Member Group 10-Year Level Term 
Life Insurance Plan, IEEE members can obtain coverage 
that locks in both a benefit and rate for a full 10 years—
