 Introd uction 
 Do you need to get your work done with the Office 2016 for Mac apps—smoothly, easily, 
and quickly? 
 Good! You’ve picked up the right book. 
 Who Is This Book For? 
 This book is designed to help beginning and intermediate users get up to speed quickly with 
the Office 2016 for Mac apps and immediately become productive with them. 
 If you need to learn to use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook to get everyday tasks done, 
at work or at home, you will benefit from this book’s focused approach and detailed advice  . 
You can either start from the beginning of the book and work through it, or use the Table of 
Contents or the Index to find the topic you need immediately, and then jump right in there.  
 What Does This Book Cover? 
 This book contains five parts that cover the shared Office features and the four apps. 
 Part 1 of the book brings you up to speed with the common features that the Office apps share:
  Chapter   1  introduces you to Office’s four apps—Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and Outlook—and what you can do with them. You learn 
how to open and close the apps; you meet key features such as the 
Ribbon interface; and you create, save, close, and reopen documents.  
  Chapter   2 shows you how to control the Office apps using the menus, 
the Quick Access Toolbar, and the Ribbon, and how to use the Format 
pane. This chapter also explains Office’s common ways of sharing 
a document with others, how to save time and effort by using the 
AutoCorrect and AutoFormat features the smart way, and how to use the 
spelling and grammar checkers. You also learn how to print documents.  

xxx
Introduction
  Chapter   3 shows you how to do everything from entering text (using the 
keyboard or other means) to creating tables and hyperlinks. Along the 
way, you learn how to work with the Cut, Copy, and Paste features, and 
how to use the Find and Replace features.  
  Chapter   4 teaches you how to add visual interest to your Office 
document by adding pictures and shapes. You learn how to insert clip 
art, pictures (such as photos), and shapes; how to rotate and position 
graphical objects; and how to use Office’s tools for making pictures look 
the way you want them to. This chapter also covers inserting SmartArt 
diagrams and arranging graphical objects to control which is visible.  
  Chapter   5 walks you through the customization options the apps offer. 
You also learn how to set essential preferences in the apps, such as the 
General preferences and the Save preferences.  
 Part 2 of the book covers using Microsoft Word, the powerful word processing app:
  Chapter   6 shows you how to enter text quickly in Word documents. 
You learn how to select text in advanced ways with the pointing device 
and the keyboard, how to move around your documents, and how to 
tell Word where to find your custom templates. You also learn to create 
backup documents automatically, and to make the most of Word’s many 
different views of a document.  
  Chapter   7 teaches you the right way to format a document quickly and 
consistently by using styles rather than applying direct formatting bit 
by bit. It also shows you how to get around your documents by using 
the Sidebar and the Find feature, and how to harness the power of the 
Replace feature.  
  Chapter   8 starts by showing you how to use Word’s extra features for 
creating tables. The chapter then explains how to break a document 
into multiple sections; how to add headers, footers, and page numbers; 
and how to create newspaper-style columns of text. You learn how to 
use bookmarks and cross-references, develop your documents using 
Word’s powerful Outline view, and add footnotes and endnotes to your 
documents.  
  Chapter   9 shows you how to use Word to create business documents 
swiftly and efficiently. You learn to set up mail merge documents (such 
as letters or labels), connect them to data sources, and save or print the 
results.  
  Chapter   10 covers how to use Word’s features for working with your 
colleagues on documents. You learn how to edit a document either 
simultaneously or separately, how to use the Track Changes feature to 
mark revisions, and how to integrate changes into a document. You also 
see how to add comments to a document and compare two document 
versions that contain untracked changes.  

xxxi
Introduction
  Chapter   11  explains how to print an entire document or just parts of it, 
with or without markup, and how to print markup without the document. 
You also learn how to remove sensitive information from documents, 
create a document you can open with earlier versions of Word, and 
create PDF files from documents.  
 Part 3 teaches you to create spreadsheets and charts with Excel:
  Chapter   12  covers creating different types of workbooks in Excel and 
entering data in them. You learn how to navigate the Excel interface, use 
workbooks and worksheets, and use Excel’s views and features to see 
the data you need.  
  Chapter   13  explains how to insert, delete, and format rows and columns 
in worksheets; how to format cells and ranges; and how to use the 
advanced conditional formatting and data validation features to identify 
unusual values or erratic input. This chapter also shows you how to 
format quickly and consistently with styles, how to add headers and 
footers to worksheets, and how to share workbooks effectively with your 
colleagues.  
  Chapter   14  teaches you how Excel’s charts work and how to add them 
to your workbooks. You learn how to lay out a chart effectively, how to 
make it look good, and how to hide any components you don’t want to 
display. You even learn how to save time by reusing the custom chart 
formats you create.  
  Chapter   15  makes clear the difference between a formula and a 
function, and shows you first how to create custom formulas and then 
how to use Excel’s built-in functions.  
  Chapter   16  shows you how to use Excel to create databases for storing 
and manipulating your information. You learn how to enter information 
into a database, how to sort the information, and how to filter it to find 
only the results you want. You also learn how to use the Goal Seek 
feature and scenarios to work out solutions to business problems.  
  Chapter   17  explains how to use Excel’s powerful PivotTable feature to 
manipulate your data so that you can discover the information you need. 
PivotTables take a few minutes to grasp, but you’ll be surprised how 
easy they are to use.

Introduction
 Part 4 of the book takes you through creating good-looking, persuasive presentations with 
PowerPoint:
  Chapter   18 gets you started by creating a presentation document using 
either a design template or a content template. The chapter then shows 
you how to add, delete, and rearrange slides; how to use PowerPoint’s 
views effectively; how to develop the outline of a presentation; and how 
to break a presentation into separate sections. You also learn how to 
collaborate with your colleagues on creating a presentation.  
  Chapter   19 guides you through the toughest part of creating a good 
presentation: creating slides that convey your meaning clearly and 
powerfully. This chapter shows you how to plan a presentation, choose 
suitable layouts (or create your own), and add text and other content to 
your slides.  
  Chapter   20 shows you ways of spicing up a presentation by using 
graphics, movies, sounds, animations, and transitions. You also learn 
how to hide slides to keep them up your sleeve and how to build custom 
slide shows that enable you to reveal only part of a larger presentation.  
  Chapter   21 explains how to deliver the presentation you’ve created. 
You can deliver the presentation live in person or create a version of 
the presentation that you can share via e-mail or in other ways. You 
also learn how to use PowerPoint’s Presenter view and how to create a 
handout for a presentation.  
 Part 5 of the book shows you how to manage your e-mail, schedule, contacts, and tasks 
with Outlook:
  Chapter   22 first shows you how to set up Outlook to work with your ISP 
or e-mail provider’s servers. Once Outlook is working, you learn how to 
get around its complex user interface, how to send and receive e-mail, 
and how to manage your messages.  
  Chapter   23 covers creating contacts either from scratch or importing 
them from your address books, spreadsheets, or other sources. The 
chapter also shows you how to view and sort your contacts, add or 
update their contact information, and quickly create communications to 
your contacts.  
  Chapter   24 brings you up to speed with Outlook’s Calendar interface, 
shows you how to customize it, and teaches you to use its views. After 
that, it explains how to create one-shot appointments and repeating 
appointments, schedule meetings, and respond to meeting requests.  
  Chapter   25 shows you how to use Outlook to define the tasks you need 
to complete and track your progress on completing them. This chapter 
also explains how to use Outlook’s Notes feature to jot down information 
as you work.

Introduction
 Conventions Used in This Book 
 This book uses several conventions to make its meaning clear without wasting words:
  Ribbon commands and menu commands: The h sign shows the 
sequence for choosing an item from the Ribbon or a command from 
the menu bar. For example, “Choose Home h Paragraph h Decrease 
Indent from the Ribbon” means that you click the Home tab of the 
Ribbon (displaying the tab’s contents), go to the Paragraph group, and 
then click the Decrease Indent button. Similarly, the h sign indicates 
a menu sequence. For example, “Choose Insert h Picture h Picture 
from File from the menu bar” means that you click the Insert menu 
on the menu bar to open the menu, click the Picture item to open the 
Picture submenu, and then click the Picture from File item on the Picture 
submenu  . 
  Special paragraphs: Special paragraphs present information that you 
may want to pay extra attention to. Note paragraphs contain information 
you may want to know; Tip paragraphs present techniques you may 
benefit from using; and Caution paragraphs warn you of potential 
problems.  
  Check boxes: The Office apps use many check boxes—the square 
boxes that can either have a check mark in them (indicating that the 
option is turned on) or not (indicating that the option is turned off). This 
book tells you to “select” a check box when you need to put a check 
mark in the check box, and to “clear” a check box when you need to 
remove the check mark from it. If the check box is already selected or 
cleared, you don’t need to change it.  
  Keyboard shortcuts: In the Office apps, you can often save time and 
effort by using a keyboard shortcut rather than a Ribbon command. This 
book uses + signs to represent keyboard shortcuts. For example, “press 
Cmd+S” means that you hold down the Cmd key, press the S key, and 
then release the Cmd key. “Press Cmd+Option+T” means that you hold 
down the Cmd key and the Option key, press the T key, and then release 
the Cmd key and the Option key.

 Part 1 
 Building Essential Office Skills 
 To save you time and effort, the Office 2016 for Mac apps share many common features. 
This part of the book shows you how to get started quickly with the applications and learn to 
use these common features. 
 In Chapter   1 , you’ll quickly meet Office’s four main apps—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
Outlook—and learn what you can do with them. You’ll grasp essential moves, such as 
opening and closing the apps; and you’ll create, save, close, and reopen documents. 
 In Chapter   2 , you’ll take control of the apps using the menus, the Quick Access Toolbar, and 
the Ribbon. You’ll learn how to share a document with others, how to save time and effort by 
using the AutoCorrect and AutoFormat features the smart way, and how to use the spelling 
and grammar checkers. You’ll also learn how to print documents. 
 In Chapter   3 , you’ll study how to work with text—everything from entering text using the 
keyboard to creating tables and hyperlinks. By the end of the chapter, you’ll also know how 
to work with the Cut, Copy, and Paste tools, and how to use the Find and Replace features. 
 In Chapter   4 , you’ll add visual interest to your Office documents by inserting pictures and 
shapes. You’ll learn how to insert clip art, pictures (such as photos), and shapes; how to 
rotate and position graphical objects; and how to use Office’s tools for making pictures look 
the way you want them. When you need more complex illustrations, you can add SmartArt 
diagrams and arrange graphical objects to overlap each other, with fine control over which 
object is visible. 
 In Chapter   5 , you’ll make the Office apps easier and faster to use by customizing them. 
You’ll also learn how to set essential preferences in the apps, such as the General 
preferences and the Save preferences.

 Chapter 1  
 Getting Up to Speed with the 
Office Apps 
 You’re probably in a hurry to start being productive using Office 2016, so this chapter gets 
you moving quickly. First, you’ll meet each of the apps, find out what you can do with them, 
and master key features such as the Ribbon and the Gallery dialog box. Then, I’ll show 
you how to launch the apps or make them launch themselves. Finally, you’ll look at how to 
create, save, and close documents, as well as how to reopen them when you need to work 
on them again. 
 Meeting the Office Apps and Learning What You Can Do 
with Them 
 Microsoft Office 2016 comes in several versions aimed at different but overlapping markets, 
so if you don’t yet have Office, your first challenge is to decide which version to get. Table  1-1 
summarizes the five Office versions that either include  Mac versions  or are exclusive to the 
Mac, what each costs, and which apps each includes.

 As you can see from Table  1-1 , you can choose between buying Office outright or paying a 
yearly or monthly subscription. The Office 365 Home subscription is by far the best deal 
because it allows you to install Office on five PCs or Macs plus five tablets and five phones, 
so a single subscription can fully cover the Office needs of a nuclear family with its 2.4 
children. As its name suggests, Office 365 Home is intended for home use rather than 
business use; for business use, you’re supposed to buy Office Home & Business 2016 for 
Mac instead. 
 For ease of use and to save time, the four main apps share many features, from the ways in 
which you create, save, and open documents to common actions you perform in them, such 
as copying text from one part of a document and pasting it in at another part. 
 Part 1 of this book discusses these common features. Parts 2 through 5 of the book then 
examine each of the apps in turn. 
 Tip  The numbers of PCs or Macs shown for the subscription versions of Office are the number of 
PCs or Macs on which you can have this version of Office active at the same time. You can install 
Office on more PCs or Macs than this and use the activation and deactivation features on the Office 
365 web site (   www.office365.com  ) to activate and deactivate computers as necessary.

CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Microsoft Outlook 
 Microsoft Outlook  (see Figure  1-4 ) is an app for e-mail and managing your contacts, 
calendar, task list, and notes. If you have multiple e-mail accounts, you can manage them all 
within the single app, saving time and effort.  
 Part 5 of this book shows you how to send e-mail and organize your life with Outlook.  
 Understanding the Common Features of the Apps 
 As you can see from the figures on the past few pages, the Office apps share a common 
look and several common features. Some of the features are standard for OS X apps, but 
others are specific to the Office apps. 
 Figure 1-4.   Microsoft Outlook makes it easy to work with multiple e-mail accounts and to schedule your business and 
home life

CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Figure  1-5 shows the  OS X menu bar  and a Word window with a document open and the 
major features labeled. The following sections explain what the features are and what you 
use them for.  
 The Title Bar and the Close, Minimize, and Zoom Buttons 
 The title bar at the top of the window shows the name of the open document, such as 
Strategic Planning. The title bar may also show the document’s file extension, such as  .docx 
for a Word document. 
 Note   To control whether the title bar shows the document’s file extension, click the app’s menu 
(such as the Word menu for Word) and then Preferences to open the Preferences window. Click the 
General button to display the General pane. Select the Show file extensions check box, and then 
close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the 
window’s title bar). 
 Figure 1-5.   The major features of an Office app window, shown with the OS X menu bar 
 

10
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 At the left end of the title bar are the following three buttons:  
  Close : Click this button to close the window. The app stays open even if 
you close the last window; to close the app, quit it by pressing Cmd+Q 
or by clicking the app’s menu and then clicking the Quit command (for 
example, choose Word ➤ Quit Word).  
  Minimize : Click this button to minimize the window to the Dock. By 
default, OS X displays each minimized window as an icon on the right 
side of the Dock divider bar; click this icon to restore the window to its 
former size.  
  Zoom : Click this button to switch the app’s window to full screen, hiding 
the OS X menu bar. Full screen is great when you want to focus on a 
single app. To switch back from full screen to a window, move the 
mouse pointer to the upper-left corner of the screen, and then click the 
green Zoom Back button that appears. The amount of space OS X 
estimates will make the contents fit just right.  
 To the right of the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons are four standard buttons in Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint:  
  File : Click this button to display the Gallery dialog box, which enables 
you to create new documents, open existing documents, and connect 
to services such as OneDrive. The Gallery dialog box shows the app’s 
name rather than the word “Gallery” in its title bar.  
  Save : Click this button to save the active document. If you’ve never 
saved the document before, the Save As sheet opens so that you can 
specify the name and folder for the document. If you have saved the 
document before, the app simply saves any unsaved changes.  
 Tip   To save space on the Dock, Ctrl-click or right-click the Dock divider bar (the dashed white 
line), click Dock Preferences to display the Dock pane in System Preferences, and then select the 
Minimize windows into application icon check box. Press Cmd+Q or choose System Preferences ➤ 
Quit System Preferences to quit System Preferences. Now, when you minimize a window, OS X puts 
it in the app’s icon in the Dock. To restore a window, Ctrl-click or right-click the app’s icon, and then 
click the window you want. 
 Tip   You can also press Cmd+Ctrl+F to switch between a window and full screen. 

11
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  Undo : Click this button to undo the last action. You can continue to click 
the button to undo further actions as needed. Alternatively, click the 
pop-up arrow to display a pop-up menu that lists the changes you can 
undo, and then click the change you want to undo. The latest changes 
are at the top of the pop-up menu, so when you click a change on it, 
you’re undoing all the changes down to the one you click.  
  Redo : Click this button to redo the last action you’ve undone or to repeat 
the last action you’ve taken. You can click multiple times as needed.  
 The Ribbon 
 Below the title bar, the  Ribbon  runs across the top of the window. The Ribbon is a control 
bar that contains multiple tabs. You can display one tab’s contents at a time by clicking the 
tab at the top. 
 Each Office app has a Home tab that contains some of the most useful commands, such as 
applying the most popular types of formatting. Beyond this tab, each app has other tabs to 
cover its needs. For example, PowerPoint’s tabs include the Slide Show tab, the Transitions 
tab, and the Animations tab—none of which Word, Excel, or Outlook need. 
 In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, each tab contains several groups of controls, divided into 
different types of actions. For example, the Home tab in PowerPoint contains a Slides group 
for creating and laying out slides, a Font group for applying font formatting, a Paragraph 
group for applying paragraph formatting, and several other groups. Unlike the other three 
apps, Outlook’s tabs don’t use groups. 
 Note  When you need as much space as possible for working in a document, you can minimize the 
Ribbon by clicking the tab that’s currently active, clicking the Collapse Ribbon button (the ^ button) 
at the right end of the Ribbon, choosing View ➤ Ribbon, or pressing Cmd+Option+R. To display the 
Ribbon again, click the tab you want to see, click the Show Ribbon button (the ^ button) at the right 
end of the Ribbon, choose View ➤ Ribbon, or press Cmd+Option+R. 
 Note   You can choose whether to show the titles of the Ribbon groups. I recommend showing the group 
names because this book uses the groups to help make clear where to find commands on the Ribbon. 
For example, the instruction “choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Advanced” means that you should click the 
Data tab of the Ribbon in Excel, go to the Sort & Filter group, and then click the Advanced button. If you 
don’t have the group titles displayed, the instructions will seem to have an unnecessary second step. 
 To control whether the group titles appear, click the app’s menu (such as the Excel menu) and then 
click Preferences. In the Preferences window, click View to display the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, 
Show” area, select the Group Titles check box, and then close the Preferences window by clicking 
the Close button (the red button at the left end of the window’s title bar). 

12
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 You’ll look at the details of how to use the Ribbon in Chapter   2 , but the basic method is 
straightforward. You click the tab for the type of action you want to take and then click the 
button or control for the action you want to take. For example, to insert a picture in a Word 
document, you click the Home tab to display its contents, go to the Insert group, and then 
click the Picture button.  
 The Status Bar 
 At the bottom of the app window is the  status bar  , which shows information about the 
document and what you’re currently working on, and provides controls for changing the view 
and zooming in or out. For example, in Word, the status bar shows the view the document 
is using, the current page number, the number of words in the document, and the proofing 
status (whether the document contains spelling or grammar errors).  
 Opening Apps 
 To get anything done in the Office apps, you need to open and close the apps. You can open 
an app from the Dock or the  Applications folder or by opening a document associated with 
that app. You may also want to open one or more apps when you log in to your Mac. 
 Opening an App from Launchpad or the Dock 
 Usually, the easiest ways to open one of the Office apps are by  using  Launchpad or by using 
the Dock. Click the Launchpad icon on the Dock to display the Launchpad screen, and then 
click the appropriate app icon. 
 If the app’s icon already appears on the Dock, you can simply click the icon to launch the 
app. If the app’s icon doesn’t appear in the Dock, but you want to add it, open the app from 
Launchpad. The app’s icon appears in the Dock because the app is running. Now Ctrl-click 
the app’s icon, click or highlight Options on the context menu, and then click Keep in Dock 
on the Options submenu (see Figure  1-6 ). 
 Tip  You can also display the Launchpad screen by pressing F4 on many Mac keyboards or by 
pinching inward with four or five fingers on a Mac’s trackpad. 

13
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Opening an App from the Applications Folder 
 Another way to run an app is from the  Applications folder. To do so, follow these steps:  
  1.   Click the Finder icon on the Dock to activate the Finder.  
  2.  Choose Go ➤ Applications from the menu bar to display the 
 Applications folder.  
  3.  Double-click the app you want to launch.  
 Making a App Launch Automatically 
 If you work in one or more of the Office apps every time you use your Mac, you can set the 
app to run automatically when you log in. For example, you may want to run Word, Excel, 
and Outlook each computing session so that you can work on documents, update your 
spreadsheets, and check your e-mail. 
 To make OS X launch an app automatically when you log in, follow these steps:  
  1.   If the app’s icon doesn’t appear on the Dock, launch the app from 
Launchpad. OS X adds the app’s icon to the Dock.  
  2.   Ctrl-click or right-click the app’s icon on the Dock to display the 
context menu.  
  3.   Click or highlight the Options item to display the Options submenu.  
  4.   Click the Open at Login item on the submenu to place a check mark 
next to this item.  
 Figure 1-6.   To keep an app’s icon in the Dock, Ctrl-click the icon, click or highlight Options, and then click Keep in Dock       
 

14
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Now log out and then log back in. Check that OS X automatically starts the apps you chose. 
 Creating a Document 
 In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you create individual  documents  and save them in separate 
files. For example, in Word, you create word processing documents such as reports or 
letters. In Excel, you create workbooks containing worksheets of data. In PowerPoint, you 
create presentation documents containing slides. 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint come with  templates , which are files that contain the basic 
structures of different kinds of documents. For example, Word includes templates for letters, 
reports, faxes, and other types of documents. A template can contain anything from the 
paper size, margins, and layout of a document up to an almost complete document in which 
you need to fill in only a few pieces of information to get a complete document. For example, 
in a customer letter template, you may need to fill in only the customer’s name, address, and 
product type to produce a complete document. 
 When you want to work from a blank slate, you can create a new Word document, Excel 
workbook, or PowerPoint presentation that has no content and no special formatting. 
 To create a new document based on a template, follow these steps:
  1.   Open the Gallery dialog box in one of the following ways:
  Launch the app : The app displays the Gallery dialog box 
automatically by default. Word displays the Microsoft Word 
Gallery dialog box (see Figure  1-7 ), Excel displays the Microsoft 
Excel Gallery dialog box, and PowerPoint displays the Microsoft 
PowerPoint Gallery dialog box.  
 Note  You can set up any app to launch automatically as described in this section. The more apps 
you set to launch automatically, the longer the login process will take—but once it is finished, you’ll 
be ready to work fast. 
 Note   Documents work differently in Outlook. While you create individual messages and other items 
(such as tasks and appointments) in Outlook, the app automatically stores most of your data for you. 

15
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  Choose File ➤  New from Template : If the app is already running, 
click the File menu on the menu bar, and then click New from 
Template. Alternatively, press Cmd+Shift+P.  
  2.  Click the template or design. For a blank document, click the Blank 
Document icon in Word, the Blank Workbook icon in Excel, or the 
Blank Presentation icon in PowerPoint.  
  3.  Click the Create button. The app closes the Gallery dialog box and 
creates the document.  
 Note  You can create a new blank document in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint by pressing the Cmd+N 
keyboard shortcut. 
 Figure 1-7.   Use the app’s Gallery dialog box, such as the Microsoft Word Gallery dialog box shown here, to create a 
new document. You can choose between having the document be blank or basing it on a template 
 

16
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Saving a Document 
 As soon as you’ve created a  document, save  it. When you save a document, you choose the 
folder in which to store it and specify the file name to give the document. After that, you can 
quickly save changes you make to the document, and you can close it and reopen it as 
needed. 
 To save a document, follow these steps:
  1.  Click the Save button on the title bar, or press Cmd+S to display the 
Save As sheet (see Figure  1-8 ). You can also choose File ➤ Save 
from the menu bar.  
 Caution  If you don’t save a document, it disappears for good when you close the app. This is 
occasionally useful when you create a document you don’t want to keep, but normally you want to 
save each document when you create it and then delete it using Finder when you no longer need 
it. When you close an app, it displays a dialog box prompting you to save any unsaved documents 
(and any unsaved changes in saved documents), but it’s easy enough to click the wrong button and 
lose the document (or the changes). 
 Figure 1-8.   The Save As sheet at first appears as its smaller size, with the folder area hidden. To change folders, either 
pick a folder from the Where pop-up menu or click the button to the right of the Save As box to expand the dialog box  
 Note A  sheet is a kind of dialog box that’s attached to a particular window rather than being freely 
movable. In Figure  1-8 , the Save As sheet is attached to the Presentation1 window.
 

17
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  2.  Choose the folder in which you want to store the document:
  You can move quickly to one of the main folders on your Mac (such 
as the  Desktop folder or the  Documents folder) or a recent folder by 
opening the Where pop-up menu and then clicking the folder.  
  To display the folder area, click the button to the right of the Save 
As box. The Save As sheet expands, as shown in Figure  1-9 . You 
can then navigate through your Mac’s drives and folders using the 
same techniques as in a Finder window. If you need to create a new 
folder to save the document in, click the New Folder button, type 
the folder name in the New Folder dialog box, and then click the 
Create button.  
 Figure 1-9.   Expand the Save As sheet if you need to use the folder pane to navigate to a different folder. You can drag 
the left, right, or bottom border of the expanded Save As sheet to resize the sheet  
 Note The Office apps come configured to save your documents in your  Documents folder. You 
can switch to any other folder needed for any document, but you can also change the default 
location. Chapter   5  explains how to do this.
 

18
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  To switch to an online folder, click the Online Locations button to the 
left of the File Format pop-up menu. The Save As sheet switches to 
show the online drives and services you’ve configured Office to use, 
such as OneDrive (see Figure  1-10 ). You can then navigate to the 
appropriate folder.  
  3.  In the Save As text box, type the name you want to give the file. The 
app suggests the first few words of the document (if there are any), 
but you may want to use a different name.  
  4.  In the Format pop-up menu, choose the file type you want the 
document to have.
  The Format pop-up menu suggests the app’s default format at first: 
Word suggests the Word Document ( .docx ) format, Excel suggests 
the Excel Workbook ( .xlsx ) format, and PowerPoint suggests the 
PowerPoint Presentation ( .pptx ) format.  
 Figure 1-10.   Clicking the Online Locations button makes the Save As sheet display the online drives and services 
you’ve configured. You can click the On my Mac button to switch back to your local drives 
 

19
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  You may need to use a different format for sharing a document with 
people using earlier versions of Office or other apps. I’ll discuss this 
in more detail in the chapters on the individual apps.  
  You can change the default format as discussed in Chapter   5 . 
  5.  If you want to display the file extension (for example,  .docx for a 
Word document) in the Save As box, clear the Hide extension check 
box.  
  6.  Click the Save button. The app closes the Save As sheet and saves 
the document. The document’s name appears in the app window’s 
title bar so that you can easily identify it.  
 After saving a document as described here, you can save it again at any point by clicking the 
Save button on the title bar, by pressing Cmd+S, or by choosing File ➤ Save from the menu bar.  
 Closing a Document 
 When you finish working on a  document, close  it. Use one of these methods:
  Click the Close button (the red button) at the left end of the window’s 
title bar. 
  Open the File menu and click Close.  
  Press Cmd+W.  
 If the document contains unsaved changes, the app displays a sheet prompting you to save 
them (see Figure  1-11 ). Click the Save button to save the changes, the Don’t Save button to 
jettison them, or the Cancel button to return to the document to remind yourself what you’ve 
changed.  
 Tip   Save your documents frequently. Any time you’ve made changes that you don’t want to have 
to make again, press Cmd+S or click the Save button on the title bar. 
 Figure 1-11.   When you close a document that contains unsaved changes, the app checks whether you want to save them  
 

20
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Opening a Document 
 You can  open a document in the Office apps in various ways. The following list shows you 
the four most useful ways:
  Open a recent document from the Apple menu : Click the Apple menu at 
the left end of the menu bar, and then click or highlight Recent Items to 
display the list of recent items (see Figure  1-12 ). In the Documents list, 
click the document you want to open. If the app associated with the 
document isn’t already running, OS X launches it automatically.  
 Tip  Because the Documents list in the Recent Items submenu contains all kinds of documents, 
other recent documents may have knocked your recent Office documents off the list. You can 
improve matters by increasing the number of items in the Recent Items list. Click the Apple 
menu, and then click System Preferences to display the System Preferences window. Click the 
General icon to display the General pane, click the Recent items pop-up menu, and then click the 
appropriate number: None (if you don’t want to use the Recent Items submenu), 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 
50. When you’ve made your choice, click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title 
bar), press Cmd+Q, or choose System Preferences ➤ Quit System Preferences. 
 Note  Even though the apps prompt you to save unsaved changes when you close a document, 
it’s a good idea to save the document before closing it. This eliminates the possibility of clicking the 
Don’t Save button by mistake. 
 Figure 1-12.   You can quickly open a recent document from the Documents section of the Recent Items submenu 
 

21
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  Open a document from Finder : Open a Finder window to the folder that 
contains the document, and then double-click the document. OS X 
opens the document in the app associated with the document type. For 
example, if you double-click an Excel workbook document in a Finder 
window, OS X opens the document in Excel. OS X launches the app if 
it’s not currently running.  
  Open a recent document with the Gallery dialog box : When you launch 
Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, the Gallery dialog box opens automatically 
by default. You can also open the Gallery dialog box at any time by 
choosing File ➤ New from Template. You can click the Recent button 
in the left pane to display the Recent pane (see Figure  1-13 ), which 
lists the documents you’ve worked with recently. Click the document 
you want to open and then click the Open button; alternatively, simply 
double-click the document.  
 Note  You can also open a document that you’ve received as an attachment to an e-mail message 
in Outlook. Chapter   23 explains how to do this. 
 Figure 1-13.   The Recent pane in the Gallery dialog box enables you to browse your recent documents in both local and 
online storage  
 

22
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  Open any document with the Gallery dialog box : You can open any 
document by using the Open pane in the Gallery dialog box, the dialog 
box that opens automatically by default when you launch Word, Excel, 
or PowerPoint. Click the Open button in the left pane to display the 
Open pane (see Figure  1-14 ). You can then click the document and click 
the Open button; alternatively, double-click the document.  
 Figure 1-14.   The Open pane in the Gallery dialog box lets you open any document 
 Note   The Recent pane and the Open pane in the Gallery dialog box show both local documents 
and online documents. If you use both local storage and online storage, you may find that this 
feature gives the Gallery dialog box an advantage over the Open dialog box in Microsoft Word, 
which shows you local storage and online storage separately. 
 Tip   In either the Recent pane or the Open pane in the Gallery dialog box, you can click a 
document to pin it in place so that you can find it easily. You can then click the Pinned button in the 
upper-left corner of the Recent pane to display only the items you’ve pinned; click the All button 
when you want to view all items again. 
 

23
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
  Open a document with the Open dialog box (Word only) : With Word 
running, press Cmd+O or choose File ➤ Open from the menu bar. Word 
displays the Open dialog box (see Figure  1-15 ). Navigate to the folder 
that contains the document, click the document, and then click the 
Open button.  
 Figure 1-15.   Use the Open dialog box to open a document from within Word. Click the Online Locations button to 
display your online locations in the Gallery dialog box  
  Open a document from the File ➤  Recent submenu : With the app 
running, open the File menu, and then click or highlight the Recent item. 
On the submenu (see Figure  1-16 ), click the document you want to 
open. If the document doesn’t appear on the menu, you can click the 
More item to display the Gallery dialog box with the Recent pane open 
in the lower-left corner.  
 

24
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Figure 1-16.   When you’re working in a app, you can use the File ➤ Open Recent menu to open a document you’ve 
worked on recently 
 Closing an App 
 When you have finished using an app,  close  it by quitting it. Quitting the app removes it from 
your Mac’s memory so your Mac can use the memory to run other apps. 
 The standard way of quitting an app is to press Cmd+Q or open the app’s menu and then 
click the Quit command. This command includes the app’s name—for example, Quit Excel. 
The app closes any documents that are open, prompting you to save any unsaved changes, 
and then closes. 
 You can also quit an app by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking its Dock icon and then clicking Quit 
on the context menu. 
 Note   If you plan to use an app again later, you can simply hide the app until you need it rather 
than close it and restart it. To hide the app, open its application menu and then click the Hide 
command (for example, choose Word ➤ Hide Word, or Excel ➤ Hide Excel) or press Cmd+H. When 
you need to see the app again, click its Dock icon. 
 Tip   You can also open a recent document from the Dock icon for a running app. Ctrl-click or 
right-click the Dock icon, click or highlight Open Recent to display the submenu, and then click the 
document. If the document doesn’t appear, click the More item to display the Gallery dialog box. 
 

25
CHAPTER 1: Getting Up to Speed with the Office Apps
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you met each of the Office apps—Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft 
PowerPoint, and Microsoft Outlook. You learned what you can do with the apps, and you 
met several of their key features, such as the Ribbon and the Gallery dialog box. You now 
know how to launch the apps; create, save, and close documents; and reopen documents 
as needed. 
 In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to work quickly and smartly with common tools in the 
Office apps.

 Chapter 2  
 Learning Common Tools 
Across the Office Suite  
 To save you time and effort, the Office apps have many common features, starting with the 
three elements you use to give most commands: the menu bar, the Ribbon control interface, 
and the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to control the apps using the menus and the Ribbon. Next, 
you’ll learn how to use the Format pane, a formatting tool that appears automatically when 
you go to apply formatting to an object. Then you’ll explore the common ways of sharing a 
document with others, how to save time and effort with the AutoCorrect feature, and how 
to turn off AutoFormat features that can cause surprises and waste time. Lastly, you’ll learn 
how to check spelling and grammar, customize the spelling checker and grammar checker 
for better results, and print your documents. 
 Using the Menus and the Ribbon 
 To give most commands in the Office apps, you use three main forms of  control interface  :
  Menus : Like most OS X apps, each Office app uses the menu bar that 
appears across the top of the screen. The menus provide access to 
most of the commands in the apps.  
  Ribbon : Each app uses this Office-specific control strip that appears 
across the top of each document window. The Ribbon lets you give 
many (but not all) of the commands that the app offers.  
  Quick Access Toolbar : The Quick Access Toolbar appears toward the 
left end of the title bar, just to the right of the Zoom button. The Quick 
Access Toolbar contains a handful of essential buttons by default, such 
as the Save button and the Undo button, but you can customize it with 
other buttons from a small selection.  

28
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Figure  2-1 shows the menu bar, the Ribbon, and the standard Quick Access Toolbar buttons 
in a Word document window.  
 There’s a considerable amount of overlap between the menus and the Ribbon. Here are 
some examples:
  To open a document (in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint), you can choose 
File ➤ Open from the menu bar or click the File button on the title bar.  
  To apply formatting to cells in an Excel workbook, you can use the 
controls on the Home tab of the Ribbon or choose Format ➤ Cells from 
the menu bar and work in the Format Cells dialog box.  
  To insert a slide in a PowerPoint presentation, you can use the New 
Slide command in the Slides group of the Home tab on the Ribbon or 
choose Insert ➤ New Slide from the menu bar.  
 As its name suggests, the Quick Access Toolbar provides a quick way to access certain key 
commands. Most of these commands are available on the menu bar or the Ribbon as well. 
 Figure 2-1.   To give commands in the Office apps, you use the OS X menu bar, the Ribbon, and the Quick Access Toolbar 
 Note  Earlier versions of the Office apps for OS X included toolbars that you could display either 
docked above the Ribbon or floating freely. The Office 2016 apps for OS X have only the Quick 
Access Toolbar.

CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 You can use whichever method of giving a command you find most convenient. The 
underlying commands are the same—it’s just a question of how you give them. 
 Using the Menus 
 If you’ve used most any other OS X app, you know how to use the menus. If not, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Make sure the app is active so that the menu bar shows its menus. 
If it’s not, click the document window to make the app active.  
 2. 
 Click the menu you want to open. For example, click the View menu 
to reveal its commands.  
 3. 
 If the command you need is on a submenu, click or highlight the 
submenu. Figure  2-2 shows the Edit menu and its Find submenu 
open in PowerPoint.  
 Figure 2-2.   As in most OS X apps, you can give commands using the menus in the  Office apps 
  4.  Click the command. The app closes the menu and performs the 
command.

CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Using and Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar 
 The  Quick Access Toolbar  , which appears toward the left end of the title bar of each Office 
app, contains a small number of buttons for frequently used commands. In Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, you can customize the buttons on the Quick Access Toolbar to make it more 
useful; in Outlook, you cannot customize the Quick Access Toolbar as of this writing. 
 To customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar pop-up 
menu button at the right end, and then click the appropriate item on the pop-up menu 
(see Figure  2-3 ). Clicking either places a check mark on the item, making the associated 
icon appear on the Quick Access Toolbar, or removes the existing check mark, removing 
the icon from the Quick Access Toolbar.  
 The selection of buttons on the Quick Access Toolbar is similar in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint. Outlook has only three buttons—Undo, Redo, and Print—in its main window, 
but the Save button appears in windows such as outgoing messages and calendar items. 
 The following list explains the Quick Access Toolbar buttons:
  File (Word ,  Excel, PowerPoint) : Click this button to display the app’s 
Gallery dialog box—for example, the Microsoft Word Gallery dialog box for 
Word or the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box for Excel—so that you can 
configure connected services, create new files, and open existing files.  
  Save (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) : Click this button either to save a file for 
the first time (in which case the Save As dialog box opens so that you can 
specify the filename and location) or to save any unsaved changes in the file.  
  Save As (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) : Click this button to save the active 
document under a different name, in a different location, or both.  
  Send Document/Send Workbook/Send Presentation (Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, respectively) : Click this button to start a new message in 
your default e-mail app (such as Outlook) with the document, workbook, 
or presentation attached.  
 Figure 2-3.   To customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar pop-up menu button, and 
then click the appropriate item on the pop-up menu  
 

31
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Undo (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) : Click this button to undo the 
previous action. Click the pop-up menu to display a list of actions you 
can undo. 
  Repeat/Redo (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) : Click this button to 
repeat the previous action, if it is one you can repeat. Otherwise, click 
this button to redo the action you last undid using the Undo feature.  
  Print (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) : Click this button to display the 
Print dialog box, in which you can choose parameters for printing.  
  Spelling & Grammar/Spelling/Spelling (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
respectively) : Click this button to start a spelling and grammar check in 
Word or a spelling check in either Excel or PowerPoint.  
  Draw Table (Word only) : Click this button to turn on the Draw Table 
feature, in which you drag a pen-like pointer to draw the type of table 
you want. Word switches the document to Print Layout view if it is in any 
other view.  
  Sort Ascending (Excel only) : Click this button to sort the active column 
or the selected columns in ascending order  
  Sort Descending ( Excel only) : Click this button to sort the active column 
or the selected columns in descending order.  
  Start from Beginning ( PowerPoint only) : Click this button to start the 
slideshow playing from the beginning.  
 At the right end of the title bar, but not part of the Quick Access Toolbar, is the Share button. 
You can click this button to display the Sharing Options panel, which lets you share the 
active document by inviting people to view it online, sharing a link to the document, or 
sending the document as an attachment. I’ll go through how to use these options in the 
“Sharing a Document with Other People” section later in this chapter.  
 Using the Ribbon 
 As you learned in Chapter   1 , the Ribbon is the control strip that appears across the top of 
each document window, below any toolbars the window is displaying. The  Ribbon  contains 
tabs, groups, and controls.
 Tip  To control the order in which the buttons appear on the Quick Access Toolbar, remove all 
the buttons, and then put them back on in the order in which you want them. For example, if you 
want the Save button to appear first on the Quick Access Toolbar, click the Customize Quick Access 
Toolbar pop-up menu button and then click Save in the pop-up menu. 

32
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Tab : A tab is one of the major groups of controls on the Ribbon and 
takes the whole width of the Ribbon. The Ribbon displays only one tab 
at a time; this tab is the  active tab . You switch from tab to tab by clicking 
the small named tab at the top. For example, to display the Home tab of 
the Ribbon, you click the Home tab at the left end. Figure  2-4 shows the 
Home tab in Word.  
  Group : Each tab consists of several groups of controls. Each group is a 
vertical division of the Ribbon, with the group’s name appearing at the 
top. For example, the Home tab in Word contains the Font group, the 
Paragraph group, and the Styles group.  
  Controls : Each group consists of one or more controls—buttons, control 
boxes, or pop-up menus that you click to give commands. For example, 
the Page Setup group on the Layout tab in Word (see Figure  2-5 ) 
contains several pop-up menus, including the Margins pop-up menu, 
the Orientation pop-up menu, and the Size pop-up menu; the Paragraph 
group contains four control boxes for adjusting indents and spacing; 
and the Arrange group (on the right, its name obscured by the open 
pop-up menu) includes pop-up menus for actions including positioning, 
wrapping text (the open pop-up menu), and aligning text.  
 Note  Unlike Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Outlook doesn’t divide its Ribbon tabs into groups. 
 Note   To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do 
so, click the app’s menu (such as the Word menu) and then click Preferences. In the Preferences 
window, click View to display the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, Show” area, select the Group Titles 
check box, and then close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at 
the left end of the window’s title bar). 
 Figure 2-4.    The Ribbon contains tabs, groups, and controls 
 

33
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Giving Commands from the Ribbon 
 To give  commands  from the Ribbon, click the tab that contains the command, go to the 
group, and then click the control. For example, to adjust hyphenation in Word, click the 
Layout tab (if it’s not already displayed), go to the Page Setup group, click the Hyphenation 
button, and then click the appropriate command on it (such as the Automatic command or 
the Manual command). 
 To see information about what a button does, hold the pointer over the button for a moment 
until a tooltip appears. Move the pointer away when you no longer need to see the tooltip. 
 Note  This book presents Ribbon commands by tab, group, and command name. For example, 
“choose Review ➤ Comments ➤ New Comment” means that you click the Review tab to display it, 
go to the Comments group (you don’t need to click it), and then click the New Comment button. 
 Note   The Ribbon automatically resizes its groups and their controls to make the best use of the 
space available in the app window. For example, if you make the window narrower, the Ribbon 
hides the names of buttons to make them fit in the space. If you make the window narrower still, 
the Ribbon can collapse an entire group into a single button that you click to produce a pop-up 
panel containing the group’s buttons. 
 Figure 2-5.   The controls on the Ribbon include buttons, pop-up menus, and boxes for entering quantities or 
measurements 
 

34
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Minimizing the Ribbon 
 When you need as much space as possible to work on a document, you can  minimize  the 
Ribbon so that only the tabs appear (see Figure  2-6 ). You can minimize the Ribbon in 
these ways:
  Click the tab that’s currently active.  
  Click the Minimize the Ribbon button to the right of the tab bar 
(the ^ button).  
  Press Cmd+Option+R.  
 To restore the display of the Ribbon, use one of these moves:  
  Click the tab you want to display.  
  Click the Expand ribbon button (which replaces the Minimize the ribbon 
button when you minimize the Ribbon).  
  Press Cmd+Option+R.  
 Using the Format Pane 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint use a feature called the  Format pane  to make available 
commands for formatting the selected object. The title and contents of the Format pane vary 
to suit the object; for example, the Format Shape pane (see the left screen in Figure  2-7 ) 
contains different controls than the Format Picture pane (see the right screen in Figure  2-7 ). 
 Figure 2-6.   You can minimize the Ribbon so that just its tabs appear to give yourself more space in the document 
window. Click the Expand ribbon icon 
 

35
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Whichever object’s version of the Format pane you’re using, you’ll find it easy enough.
  Display the tab you need : If the Format pane you’re using has multiple 
tabs, click the appropriate tab. For example, in the Format Shape pane, 
click the Shape Options tab or the Text Options tab, as needed. The 
tab’s subtabs appear.  
 Figure 2-7.   Use the Format pane to format objects such as shapes and pictures. The pane’s name changes to reflect 
the object type, such as the Format Shape pane (left) and the Format Picture pane (right) 
 

36
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Display the subtab or tab you need : If the Format pane you’re using has 
multiple tabs, click the appropriate subtab on the second line of tabs, 
the tabs identified with icons rather than text, such as those you see in 
the Format Shape pane. If the Format pane you’re using has only the 
icon tabs, as does the Format Picture pane, click the appropriate tab. 
The controls on the subtab or tab appear.  
  Expand the section you need : Most tabs contain multiple sections of 
controls, such as the Size section, Properties section, and Text Box 
section you see in the left screen in Figure  2-7 . Click the heading for the 
section you need to expand.  
  Use the controls as normal : Once you’ve located the controls you need, 
use them as normal. For example, adjust the values in a text box, such 
as those in the Size section in the left screen in Figure  2-7 , or select or 
deselect check boxes.  
  Close the Format pane when you finish : When you finish using the 
Format pane, click the Close (X) button in its upper-right corner to close 
the pane.   
 Sharing a Document with Other People 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all enable you to share a document with other people in several 
different ways. This section covers the three ways common to all three of these apps:
  Send using e-mail  
  Save to OneDrive  
  Save to SharePoint  
 Tip   The Format pane appears docked at the right side of the app window. You can undock it by 
grabbing its title bar and dragging it in any direction. Once the Format pane is undocked, you can 
drag it outside the app window and resize it as needed. There’s no way to redock the Format pane 
manually; instead, close the Format pane. When you reopen the pane, it appears docked again. 
 Note   For coverage of the other ways of sharing documents that the individual apps offer, see the 
chapters on those apps. 

37
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Sending a Document via E-mail 
 You can send a document via e- mail by starting a message in Outlook (or another e-mail 
app) and then attaching the document’s file. But if you’re working from one of the other 
Office apps and have the document open, you can start a message directly from the app. 
This saves a bit of time and effort, because you use the app to identify the document—you 
don’t have to navigate to the document in your Mac’s file system like you usually must when 
attaching a file to a message. 
 To send a document using e-mail, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Make the document the active document. If the document is already 
open, click in its window; if the document isn’t open, open it.  
 2. 
 Click the Share button at the right end of the title bar, click the Send 
Attachment submenu, and then click the item for the appropriate type 
of attachment. For example, in Excel, you can choose the Workbook 
item or the PDF item (see Figure  2-8 ). The app launches your default 
e-mail app (for example, Outlook) if it’s not running, or activates it if it is 
running, and creates a new message with the document attached.  
 Caution  Before sending a document via e-mail, make sure you’ve saved it. The apps will let you 
send an unsaved document, but doing so isn’t a good idea. 
 Figure 2-8.   Click the Share button at the right end of the title bar when you need to send a file via e-mail or share it online 
 3. 
 Address and complete the message, and then send it as usual.  
 Note   You can also choose File ➤ Share and then click the appropriate Send item on the Share 
submenu. For example, for an Excel workbook, you can choose File ➤ Share ➤ Send Workbook or 
File ➤ Share ➤ Send PDF. 
 If you’re sharing a document saved on OneDrive or a SharePoint site and you want to send the 
recipient only a link to the document rather than sending the document itself, click the Share button 
at the right end of the title bar, click the Copy Link item to display the Copy Link submenu, and then 
click the View-Only item or the View and Edit item, depending on whether you want to allow the 
person to edit the document. The app copies the link to the Clipboard. You can then paste it into an 
e-mail message or an instant message to share it with the recipient. 
 

38
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Setting Up Connected Services and SharePoint Servers 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint can save files to online services such as Microsoft’s  OneDrive 
service  and those provided by SharePoint servers. To use such services, you need to set up 
an account for each service. 
 While setting up Office on your Mac, or while running the first Office app after installing 
Office, you likely set up an account to connect to OneDrive or a SharePoint server. If so, 
you may need to set up another account now—for example, so that you have a business 
account and a personal account. If not, you can set up an account now.  
 Setting Up Your First Connected Services 
 To set up your  first connected service  , follow these steps in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
 1. 
 If you have no document active, press Cmd+N to create a new blank 
document (in Word), blank workbook (in Excel), or blank presentation 
(in PowerPoint).  
 2. 
 Click the File button near the left end of the title bar to display the 
app’s Gallery dialog box (the Microsoft Word Gallery dialog box, 
the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box, or the Microsoft PowerPoint 
Gallery dialog box).  
 3. 
 Click the Sign In button at the top of the left pane to display the first 
Sign In dialog box.  
 4. 
 Type the e-mail address or phone number for your account.  
 5. 
 Click the Next button. The Sign In dialog box prompts you for your 
password.  
 6. 
 Type your password.  

39
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 7. 
 Click the Sign In button. One or more dialog boxes may open in 
sequence, each prompting you to allow other Office apps to use 
confidential information about your Microsoft identity that you have 
stored in your OS X keychain (see Figure  2-9 ).  
 Figure 2-9.   If Office prompts you to allow an app access to confidential information stored in your Microsoft identity, 
click the Always Allow button 
 8. 
 Click the Always Allow button to allow the app access to the 
Microsoft identity information it needs to sign in to the service. The 
app sets up your account, and your initials and first name appear in 
place of the Sign In button.  
 You can now start using the service to which you have connected.  
 Setting Up Another Connected Service or a SharePoint 
Connection 
 To set up  another connected service  or a SharePoint connection, follow these steps in Word, 
Excel, or PowerPoint:
 1. 
 If you have no document active, press Cmd+N to create a new blank 
document (in Word), blank workbook (in Excel), or blank presentation 
(in PowerPoint).  
 2. 
 Click the File button near the left end of the title bar to display the 
app’s Gallery dialog box (the Microsoft Word Gallery dialog box, 
the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box, or the Microsoft PowerPoint 
Gallery dialog box). Figure  2-10 shows the Microsoft Excel Gallery 
dialog box.  
 

40
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 3. 
 Click the Add (+) button near the lower-left corner of the dialog box 
to display the first Add a Service dialog box (see Figure  2-11 ). 
 Figure 2-11.   In the first Add A Service dialog box, click the button for the service type you want to add 
 Figure 2-10.   To add another connected service to Office, click the Add (+) button near the lower-left corner of the 
Gallery dialog box 
 
 

41
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 4. 
 Click the button for the service type you want to add, such as 
the OneDrive button, the OneDrive for Business button, or the 
SharePoint button. A second Add a Service dialog box opens, 
prompting you for further information.  
 5. 
 Enter the appropriate information:
  OneDrive. Type the e-mail address for the account.  
  SharePoint. Type the URL of the SharePoint server.  
  6.   Click the Next button. The Sign In dialog box opens, prompting you 
for the password for your OneDrive account and for both your e-mail 
address and password for a SharePoint server.  
 7. 
 Type your password or your e-mail address and password.  
 8. 
 Click the Sign In button. One or more dialog boxes may open in 
sequence, each prompting you to allow other Office apps to use 
confidential information about your Microsoft identity that you have 
stored in your OS X keychain. (Look back to Figure  2-8 , earlier in this 
chapter.)  
 9. 
 Click the Always Allow button to allow the app access to the 
Microsoft identity information it needs to sign in to the service. The 
app sets up your account, and you can start using it.  
 Switching Among and Managing Your Services and Servers 
 After  adding multiple services  and servers, you can switch quickly among them by using the 
second-from-left pane in the Gallery dialog box for the app. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 If you have no document active, press Cmd+N to create a new blank 
document (in Word), blank workbook (in Excel), or blank presentation 
(in PowerPoint).  
 2. 
 Click the File button near the left end of the title bar to display the 
app’s Gallery dialog box (the Microsoft Word Gallery dialog box, 
the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box, or the Microsoft PowerPoint 
Gallery dialog box). Figure  2-12 shows the Microsoft PowerPoint 
Gallery dialog box.  
 Note  For a SharePoint site, you must enter  https:// at the beginning of the SharePoint server’s 
URL. The Add a Service routine doesn’t automatically supply https:// if you enter only the remaining 
part of the address. 

42
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 3. 
 In the second-from-left pane, click the connected service or 
SharePoint server you want to use. The folders and files then appear 
in the third pane, and you can navigate to the item you need.  
 You can also manage your connected services and SharePoint servers from the Gallery 
dialog box.
  View your connected services and SharePoint servers : Click the button 
that shows your initials and first name at the top of the left pane to 
display the pop-up panel (see Figure  2-13 ).

CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Saving a Document to a Connected Service or to a SharePoint 
Server 
 Once you have set up your connected accounts and  SharePoint servers  , you can easily save 
documents to them. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Make the document the active document. If the document is already 
open, click in its window. If the document isn’t open, open it.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Save As from the menu bar to open the Save As 
dialog box (see Figure  2-15 ).

  3.  In the Save As box at the top, type a new name for the document or 
edit the existing name as needed.  
 4. 
 In the left pane, select the connected service or SharePoint server on 
which you want to save the document.  
 5. 
 In the second-from-left pane, select the destination folder. 
If necessary, select a subfolder in the next pane.  
 6. 
 Click the Save button. The app saves the document to the 
connected service or SharePoint server.  
 Saving Time and Effort with AutoCorrect 
 As you work in a document, the AutoCorrect feature watches the characters you type and 
springs into action if it detects a mistake it can fix or some formatting it can apply. This feature 
can save you a lot of time and effort, and can speed up your typing substantially, so it’s well 
worth using—but you need to set it up to meet your needs. AutoCorrect also has some features 
that can cause surprises, so you will want to choose settings that suit the way you work. 
 To set up  AutoCorrect  , first open the AutoCorrect preferences pane:
  Word : Choose Tools ➤ AutoCorrect from the menu bar to display the 
AutoCorrect preferences pane in the Word Preferences window.  
  Excel : Choose Tools ➤ AutoCorrect from the menu bar to display the 
AutoCorrect preferences pane in the Excel Preferences window.  
  PowerPoint : Choose Tools ➤ AutoCorrect from the menu bar to display 
the AutoCorrect preferences pane in the PowerPoint Preferences 
window. 
  Outlook : Choose Outlook ➤ Preferences from the menu bar (or 
press Cmd+,) to display the Outlook Preferences window. Then click 
the AutoCorrect icon in the Personal Settings area to display the 
AutoCorrect preferences pane.  
 The AutoCorrect preferences pane has different contents in each of the  Office apps:  
  Word : Word’s AutoCorrect preferences pane (see Figure  2-16 ) has four 
tabs: one for standard AutoCorrect, one for Math AutoCorrect, one for 
AutoFormat as You Type, and one for AutoText.  
 Note   If the document you’re saving to an online destination has never been saved before, you can 
open the Save As dialog box by giving the Save command—for example, click the Save button on 
the title bar or press Cmd+S. 

46
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Excel : Excel’s AutoCorrect preferences pane has no tabs because Excel 
has only the standard AutoCorrect feature.  
  PowerPoint : The AutoCorrect preferences pane has two tabs: one for 
standard AutoCorrect and one for AutoFormat as You Type.  
  Outlook : The AutoCorrect preferences pane has two tabs: one for 
standard AutoCorrect and one for AutoFormat (which includes options 
for applying formatting as you type and replacing characters with 
formatting as you type).  
 Figure 2-16.   The AutoCorrect preferences pane contains options that can save you plenty of time but may also give you 
surprises. Word’s AutoCorrect preferences pane (shown here) contains more options than the preferences panes in the 
other apps 
 

47
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 The details vary depending on what each app needs, but the basic part of AutoCorrect 
is the same for each app: AutoCorrect watches as you type and makes changes that 
are supposed to be helpful. To get the most out of AutoCorrect, you need to configure it 
carefully, as discussed in the following sections. 
 Choosing Standard AutoCorrect Options 
 Let’s start by looking at what you might call the standard AutoCorrect options—those that 
appear on the AutoCorrect tab for Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and in the tab-free 
AutoCorrect preferences pane in Excel. 
 These are the options you can choose:  
  Show AutoCorrect smart button (Word and PowerPoint only) : Select 
this check box to have the app display a small button under each item 
AutoCorrect changes. You can hold the pointer over this button to 
make the app display a menu of AutoCorrect-related choices, such as 
stopping making this change. These buttons are usually helpful.  
  Correct TWo INitial CApitals : Select this check box to have AutoCorrect 
apply lowercase to a second initial capital, such as changing “THree” to 
“Three.” This option is usually helpful.  
  Capitalize first letter of sentences : Select this check box if you want 
AutoCorrect to automatically start each sentence (and paragraph) with a 
capital letter. Clear this check box if you prefer to write in fragments and 
then fix them afterward.  
  Capitalize names of days : Select this check box to have AutoCorrect 
automatically capitalize the first letter of the day names (for example, 
Sunday). This option is usually helpful.  
  Capitalize first letter of table cell (Word only) : Select this check box if you 
want AutoCorrect to automatically capitalize the first letter of each entry 
in a table cell. Some people find this option helpful; others don’t.  
 Note   Word has a master control for turning off AutoCorrect as a whole. This is the “Automatically 
correct spelling and formatting as you type” check box that appears at the top of the AutoCorrect 
preferences pane. Clear this check box if you want to turn off AutoCorrect. 
 Tip  In Outlook, you can leave the AutoCorrect preferences pane open as you work in the app. 
Doing this can save you time when you need to create multiple AutoCorrect entries at the same 
time or test different settings.

CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Replace text as you type : Select this check box to use AutoCorrect’s 
main feature, replacing misspellings and contractions with their 
designated replacement text. You will want to use this feature to make 
the most of AutoCorrect.  
  Automatically use suggestions from the spelling checker (Word only) : 
Select this check box to let the “Replace text as you type” feature use 
suggestions from the spelling checker as well as the entries in the list. 
This option is usually helpful too.  
 Choosing AutoFormat as You Type Options 
 The  AutoFormat  as You Type options are the ones that cause most surprises to Office users. 
These features try to apply necessary formatting as you work—without consulting you. You 
may well want to turn some or most of them off. 
 All four apps have AutoFormat as You Type options, but they put them in different places. 
Here are the details:
  Word : Word has the most AutoFormat as You Type options. They appear 
on the AutoFormat as You Type tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane 
(see Figure  2-17 ).  

49
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Excel : Excel’s only AutoFormat as You Type option is the “Replace 
Internet and network paths with hyperlinks” check box, which appears 
in the AutoCorrect preferences pane (rather than on a tab).  
  PowerPoint : The AutoFormat as You Type tab in PowerPoint’s 
AutoCorrect preferences pane has two Replace as You Type options and 
two Apply as You Type Options.  
  Outlook : The AutoFormat as You Type tab in the AutoCorrect 
preferences pane contains two AutoFormat as You Type options and five 
Replace as You Type options.  
 Figure 2-17.   You may want to turn off some of the AutoFormat as You Type options to avoid surprises. This is the 
AutoFormat as You Type tab in the AutoCorrect preferences pane for Word 
 

50
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 These are the options Word offers in the Apply as You Type area of the AutoFormat as You 
Type tab:
  Automatic bulleted lists : Select this check box if you want AutoCorrect to 
automatically apply a bulleted list style when you start a paragraph with 
an asterisk, a hyphen, or a greater-than sign followed by a space or tab.  
  Automatic numbered lists : Select this check box if you want AutoCorrect to 
automatically apply a numbered list style when you start a paragraph 
with a number or letter followed by a period or closing parenthesis and 
then type a space or tab.  
  Borders : Select this check box to have AutoCorrect apply border lines 
when you type three or more hyphens, underscores, asterisks, tildes, 
equal signs, or hash marks at the beginning of a paragraph and then 
press the Return key. Try these out to see the types of lines they produce.  
  Headings : Select this check box if you want AutoCorrect to 
automatically apply Word’s heading styles when you create a short 
paragraph in the right way. For Heading 1 style, press the Return key 
twice, type the heading, and then press the Return key twice more. For 
Heading 2 style, press the Return key twice, press the Tab key, type the 
heading, and press the Return key twice more. For Heading 3 style, use 
two tabs, and for Heading 4 style, use three tabs. AutoCorrect removes 
the extra paragraphs and tabs when it makes the change. Chapter   6 
shows you how to work with heading styles and other styles.  
  Tables : Select this check box if you want to be able to create a table 
by typing a line of plus signs and hyphens. Each plus sign indicates a 
column border, so  +--+----+--+ produces a three-column table. The 
number of hyphens indicates the relative width of the columns—in the 
previous example, the left column and right column are narrow (two 
hyphens each), while the middle column is wider (four hyphens).  
 These are the options that Word offers in the Replace as You Type area:
  *Bold* and _italic_ with real formatting : Select this check box if you want 
to be able to apply bold by typing an asterisk before and after a word and 
to apply italics by typing an underscore before and after a word. These are 
long-standing Internet conventions for designating formatting in plain text, 
but usually it’s easier to use keyboard shortcuts to apply the bold or italics.  
  Fractions (1/2) with fraction character (½) : Select this check box to have 
AutoCorrect insert real fraction characters in place of fractions you type. 
This too is usually helpful.  
 Note   The Apply as You Type options can be useful once you know what they do and how they 
work. Until then, these options tend to cause surprises by making unwanted changes in your 
documents. If you don’t find these options helpful, turn them off, like many people do. 

51
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Internet and network paths with hyperlinks : Select this check box to 
have AutoCorrect insert a hyperlink when you type a URL (for example, 
  www.microsoft.com  ) or a network path (for example,  \\server1\users ). 
This option is helpful only if you want live hyperlinks in your documents.  
  Ordinals (1st) with superscript : Select this check box to have 
AutoCorrect apply superscript to the letters of ordinals (for example, 
1 st , 2 nd ). This option is useful when you need fully formatted documents. 
If you don’t need superscripted ordinals, clear this check box.  
  Straight quotation marks with smart quotation marks : Select this check 
box to have AutoCorrect replace straight-up-and-down quotation marks 
with smart, or “curly,” quotation marks. This is usually helpful.  
  Symbol characters (--) with symbols (—) : Select this check box to have 
AutoCorrect insert en dashes (–) in place of a hyphen preceded and 
followed by spaces and to have AutoCorrect insert em dashes (—) for 
two hyphens typed between words. This option is usually helpful.  
 These are the options Word offers in the Automatically as You Type area:
  Define styles based on your formatting : Select this check box only if you 
want AutoCorrect to automatically create styles when it thinks you need 
them. This feature is a recipe for confusion, so you’ll probably want to 
clear this check box.  
  Indent with tab or backspace : Select this check box to have AutoCorrect 
automatically move the left indent to the left when you press the 
Backspace key at the beginning of a blank paragraph and to move it 
to the right when you press the Tab key. This feature tends to cause 
formatting surprises, so you may want to turn it off. For example, in 
most word processing apps and text editors, you can press Backspace 
from the beginning of a paragraph to delete the previous paragraph 
mark, joining the two paragraphs. When this check box is selected, that 
Backspace press moves the left indent instead.  
  Format beginning of list item like the one before it : Select this check box 
to have AutoCorrect format the second and subsequent items in a list 
using the same formatting you added to the beginning of the first item, 
such as italic or bold. This setting can be useful when you override the 
standard formatting of the list, but you may find it easier to apply the 
formatting overrides yourself.  
 In PowerPoint, the AutoFormat as You Type tab contains four options divided into two sets. 
The first set, Apply as You Type, contains these two options:
  AutoFit body text to placeholder : Select this check box if you want 
PowerPoint to automatically reduce the point size of text when it 
becomes too long to fit in a body placeholder. This option is often helpful, 
but you may prefer to edit the text down to size to keep it readable.  

52
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Automatic bulleted and numbered lists : As discussed earlier, select 
this check box to have PowerPoint automatically create bulleted lists 
when you start a paragraph with a bullet-like character (such as *) and 
to create numbered lists when you start a paragraph with a numbering 
character (such as 1. or A.).  
 The second set of options on the AutoFormat as You Type tab of the AutoCorrect 
preferences pane in PowerPoint, the Replace as You Type set, contains these two options:
  Internet and network paths with hyperlinks : As discussed earlier, select 
this check box to have PowerPoint automatically create links from 
Internet addresses and network paths.  
  Straight quotes with smart quotes : Select this check box to have 
AutoCorrect replace straight-up-and-down quotation marks with smart 
quotation marks.  
 In Outlook, the AutoFormat tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane contains two sets of 
options. The first set, Apply as You Type, has two options:
  Automatic bulleted lists : Select this check box to make Outlook 
automatically create a bulleted list when you start a paragraph with a 
bullet-like character (such as *).  
  Automatic numbered lists : Select this check box to make Outlook 
automatically create a numbered list when you start a paragraph with a 
numbering character (such as 1. or A.).  
 The second set of options on the AutoFormat tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane in 
Outlook is the Replace as You Type set, which contains the following options:
  Dashes with n-dashes and m-dashes : Select this check box to make 
AutoCorrect insert en dashes (–) in place of a hyphen preceded and 
followed by spaces and to make AutoCorrect insert em dashes (—) for 
two hyphens typed between words.  
  “…” with ellipses : Select this check box to make Outlook replace three 
periods with an ellipsis character (…).  
  *Bold* and _italic_ with real formatting : Select this check box if you want 
to be able to apply bold by typing an asterisk before and after a word 
and if you want to apply italics by typing an underscore before and after 
a word. Usually, it’s easier to apply bold or italics manually as needed—
for example, press Cmd+B for bold or Cmd+I for italics.  

53
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Replace *** or ––– with horizontal line (3 or more characters) : Select this 
check box to have Outlook create a decorative line when you type three 
asterisks (***) or three underscores (___) and then press the Return key.  
  Internet and network paths with hyperlinks : Select this check box to have 
AutoCorrect insert a hyperlink when you type a URL (for example, 
  www.microsoft.com  ) or a network path (for example,  \\server1\users ). 
This can be helpful when you need to enter hyperlinks in your messages.  
 Choosing Math AutoCorrect Options in Word 
 Math  AutoCorrect  makes it easy to enter characters and symbols used in math in your 
Word documents. For example, you can type  \theta to enter a lowercase theta character (θ) 
without visiting the Symbol dialog box. Math AutoCorrect comes with a long list of entries for 
math characters and symbols. 
 The Math AutoCorrect tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane in Word (see Figure  2-18 ) lets 
you control whether and where to have AutoCorrect replace math terms with math symbols. If 
you use math in your documents, Math AutoCorrect can be a great time-saver; if you don’t use 
math, turn it off by clearing the Replace text as you type check box on the Math AutoCorrect tab.  
 Note   In Word, the AutoCorrect preferences pane also includes an AutoText tab. This tab contains 
options for creating AutoText entries, blocks of text, or other content that you can insert quickly in 
your documents. Chapter   6  shows you how to save time and effort by using AutoText. 

54
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 These are the options you can choose on the Math AutoCorrect tab:
  Use Math AutoCorrect rules outside of math regions check box : Select 
this check box if you want to use Math AutoCorrect anywhere in your 
documents. If you want to use Math AutoCorrect only in math areas, 
clear this check box.  
  Replace text as you type : Enables Word to replace the text items listed 
in the main box with their math replacements.  
 Figure 2-18.   If you include math in your Word documents, choose whether to restrict Math AutoCorrect to math 
regions—areas in which you’ve inserted equations—and decide which items to replace as you type 
 

55
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  AutoCorrect items : To add an item, type the abbreviation or text version 
in the Replace box, type or paste the replacement text in the With box, 
and then click the Add button.  
  Recognized functions : To change the list of math expressions that Word 
recognizes and doesn’t automatically italicize, click the Recognized 
Functions button, and then work in the Recognized Math Functions 
dialog box that opens.  
 Creating AutoCorrect Entries 
 The Replace Text as You Type feature in AutoCorrect can save you a large amount of time 
and typing. To make the most of this powerful feature, you need to spend some time creating 
a list of  entries  that will fix your typing mistakes and expand abbreviations you define. 
 The basic way to create an entry is to type the error or short version in the Replace text box 
and the replacement text in the With text box and then click the Add button. You can create 
an entry faster by pasting in the replacement text, which is especially handy if it’s long. 
 Regular AutoCorrect entries are plain text, but in Word, you can create formatted 
AutoCorrect entries as well. A formatted AutoCorrect entry can contain not only formatted 
text but also other objects, such as tables, graphics, or equations. To create a formatted 
AutoCorrect entry, follow these steps:
 1. 
 In a document, create the replacement text and other items exactly 
as you want them to appear in the document after the AutoCorrect 
replacement. For example, type text and format it, add a graphic, or 
add a table.  
 2. 
 Select everything you want to include in the AutoCorrect entry.  
 3. 
 Choose Tools ➤ AutoCorrect from the menu bar to open the AutoCorrect 
dialog box. The first part of your selection appears in the With text box.  
 Tip  You can create standard AutoCorrect entries up to 255 characters long—enough for several 
sentences. Long AutoCorrect entries are great for quickly entering boilerplate text, such as 
addresses, company names, set phrases, or standard text for documents such as business letters 
or contracts. If you need to create longer AutoCorrect entries in Word, you can do so by creating 
formatted AutoCorrect entries, as you’ll see shortly. 
 Note   The quickest way of creating an AutoCorrect entry for a typo is by using the AutoCorrect 
option when checking spelling, as discussed in the “Checking Spelling and Grammar” section later 
in this chapter. 

56
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 4. 
 Make sure the Formatted text option button is selected. (If not, click it.)  
 5. 
 Click the Add button to add the entry.  
 Creating AutoCorrect Exceptions 
 As well as AutoCorrect entries, you can create  AutoCorrect exceptions —specific terms 
when you don’t want AutoCorrect to replace text when it normally would. You can  create 
AutoCorrect exceptions  in Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, but not in Excel. 
 To create AutoCorrect exceptions, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box by clicking the 
Exceptions button on the AutoCorrect tab of the AutoCorrect 
preferences pane.  
 2. 
 Click the tab for the type of exception you want to work with:
  First Letter : On this tab, list the terms that end with periods but after which 
you don’t want the next word to start with a capital letter. Office starts you off 
with a list of built-in terms, such as vol. and wk. Figure  2-19 shows the First 
Letter tab of the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box in Word.  
  INitial CAps : On this tab, list the terms that start with two initial capital letters 
that you don’t want AutoCorrect to reduce to a single capital—for example, 
IPv6. 
  Other Corrections : This tab appears only in Word. On it, list other terms that 
you don’t want AutoCorrect to fix.  
 Note   Word stores formatted AutoCorrect entries in the Normal template ( Normal.dotm ), which 
it loads each time you launch the app. Depending on the options you’ve chosen for Word, you may 
see a prompt to save Normal when exiting Word after creating a formatted AutoCorrect entry. If you 
receive this prompt, click the Yes button to save the changes to Normal. 

57
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 3. 
 Add and delete exceptions as needed:
  Add an exception : Type it in the “Don’t capitalize after” box or the “Don’t 
correct” box (depending on the tab), and then click the Add (+) button.  
  Delete an exception : Click it in the list box, and then click the Remove (–) 
button. 
 4. 
 In Word, select the “Automatically add words to list” check box if 
you want Word to automatically add exceptions when you undo a 
correction it has made.  
 5. 
 When you have finished working with exceptions, click the OK button 
in Word or PowerPoint to close the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog 
box. In Outlook, click the Close button.  
 Working with Smart Buttons 
 A  smart button is a little button that an Office app inserts automatically in a document 
to indicate that you can take actions with a particular type of material. The smart button 
provides a pop-up menu of actions tailored to that type of content. 
 For example, Word and PowerPoint can display a smart button after replacing an 
AutoCorrect entry with its replacement text, in case you need to undo the correction or stop 
the app from using it in the future. And when you paste in text or other options, Word, Excel, 
and PowerPoint display a Paste Options smart button that provides different ways of pasting 
the text, such as with or without formatting. 
 Figure 2-19.   In the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box, you can create lists of terms that you want AutoCorrect to ignore 
 

58
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Figure  2-20 shows what you’ll see when a smart button is available. This example is for 
AutoCorrect, but other smart buttons work in a similar way.
  At first, the app displays a light-blue line and a downward-pointing 
arrow below the correction to indicate that it has taken place. This line 
and arrow appear momentarily when the app makes the correction and 
then disappear. When you move the pointer near the correction, they 
appear again.  
  When you move the pointer over the correction or the line and arrow, the 
app displays the AutoCorrect Options button.  
  You can then click this button to display the menu of options—for 
AutoCorrect, undoing the correction, stopping the app from correcting it 
in future, or opening the AutoCorrect Options to make other changes.  
 Figure 2-20.   A smart button pops up when you move the pointer over text on which you can perform specific actions. 
For example, the AutoCorrect Options button appears first as a blue line (top). When you move the pointer over it, the 
full button appears (middle). You can click the button to display the actions (bottom) 
 Checking Spelling and Grammar 
 To check that your documents are as correct as possible, you can check the spelling in 
them. Each of the Office apps lets you use the spelling checker, which is shared among the 
apps. Word and Outlook also have a grammar checker. 
 

59
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Checking Spelling 
 In Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, you can have the spelling checker check spelling either 
as you type or when you’re ready to check the whole document. Excel doesn’t offer on-the-
fly checking, only full checking. 
 Checking Spelling as You Type 
 Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook can all check your spelling as you type. If you leave this 
checking turned on, the spelling checker puts a wavy red underline beneath any word whose 
spelling it thinks is wrong. 
 To check the spelling of a queried word, Ctrl-click or right-click the word, and then make one 
of the following choices from the context menu (see Figure  2-21 ): 
  Replace the word : Click one of the suggested words at the top of the 
context menu.  
  Ignore All : Ignore all instances of the apparently misspelled word in this 
document.  
  Add to Dictionary : Add this word to your custom dictionary so that the 
spelling checker never queries it again.  
  Hyperlink : Display the Insert Hyperlink dialog box so that you can create 
a hyperlink from the text.  
  New Comment : Create a new comment that refers to the word—for 
example, you might query what the word should be.  
 Note   Computers are great at checking spelling because in most cases each word is spelled 
either correctly or incorrectly—there are few gray areas, and the spelling checker doesn’t need to 
understand what the text means to evaluate the spelling. So, in most cases, it’s a good idea to use 
the spelling checker to remove spelling mistakes from your documents. You still need to make sure 
that any suggested replacement is the right word—the spelling checker has minimal understanding 
of context, so don’t accept its suggestions blindly. 

60
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Checking Spelling in the Whole Document 
 Instead of checking spelling as you type (or in addition to doing so), you can run a spell 
check at any time. Before you start, position the insertion point or selection where you want 
to start the check.   
 Here are some examples:
  Word : Press Cmd+Home to move the insertion point to the start of the 
document.  
  Excel : Click the cell in which you want to start the spell-check.  
  PowerPoint : Click the slide at which you want to start the spell-check.  
 Open the Spelling and Grammar checker by pressing Cmd+Option+L or giving the 
appropriate command:   
  Word : Choose Review ➤ Proofing ➤ Spelling & Grammar from the 
Ribbon or Tools ➤ Spelling & Grammar from the menu bar.  
  Excel : Choose Review ➤ Proofing ➤ Spelling from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Spelling from the menu bar.  
  PowerPoint : Choose Review ➤ Proofing ➤ Spelling from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Spelling from the menu bar.  
  Outlook : In a message window, choose Options ➤ Spelling & Grammar 
from the Ribbon or Edit ➤ Spelling & Grammar ➤ Show Spelling and 
Grammar from the menu bar.  
 The spelling checker displays its first query. 
 Figure 2-21.   Ctrl-click or right-click a queried word and then click the appropriate item on the context menu 
 

61
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Figure  2-22 shows the Spelling and Grammar dialog box in Word. The Spelling dialog box in 
Excel and PowerPoint has most of the same features.  
 You can now choose how to deal with each query. These are your options:
  Ignore : Click this button to ignore this instance of the word.  
  Ignore All : Click this button to ignore all instances of the word in this 
document (but query it in other documents).  
  Add : Click this button to add the word to your custom dictionary so that 
the spelling checker never queries it again.  
 Note  If the spelling checker finds nothing to query, it displays a dialog box telling you that the 
check is complete. Click the OK button to dismiss the dialog box. 
 Figure 2-22.   The Spelling dialog box or Spelling and Grammar dialog box suggests ways to fix any problems it finds 
 

62
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Change : In the Suggestions list box, click the word with which to replace 
the queried word, and then click this button to change this instance.  
  Change All : In the Suggestions list box, click the replacement word, and 
then click this button to change all instances in the document.  
  AutoCorrect : In the Suggestions list box, click the replacement word, 
and then click this button to create an AutoCorrect entry and to correct 
this instance.  
  Options : Click this button to open the Proofing pane in the app’s 
Preferences window with the Spelling options or Spelling and Grammar 
options displayed.  
  Undo : Click this button to undo the last spelling change you made.  
  Cancel : Click this button to end the spelling check before you’ve dealt 
with all the queries.  
 When you’ve dealt with one query, the spelling checker displays the next query. When the 
spelling checker reaches the end of the document after starting anywhere but the beginning, 
it asks whether you want to continue at the beginning. Figure  2-23 shows the dialog box 
you’ll see in Excel. Click the Yes button or the No button, as appropriate.  
 Tip   When you check spelling, create an AutoCorrect entry for any misspelling you think you may 
repeat. Each AutoCorrect entry may help only a little, but taken together, they can make a huge 
improvement in your typing speed and accuracy. 
 Figure 2-23.   If you start checking from the middle of a document, the spelling checker prompts you to continue at the 
beginning  
 

63
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 When you have dealt with every spelling query, the spelling checker lets you know that the 
check is complete (see Figure  2-24 ). 
 Figure 2-24.   The spelling checker confirms that the check is complete 
 Checking Grammar in Word and Outlook 
 For documents you create in Word or outgoing messages you write in Outlook, you can 
check the grammar as well as the spelling. As with spelling, you can check  grammar  either 
as you type or in a separate operation when you’re ready to review your document. 
 Caution   Before using the grammar checker, make sure you understand how severe its limitations 
are. The grammar checker doesn’t understand the meaning of the text, but it tries to identify the 
different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, and so on) and their relationship to each other. Many of the 
grammar checker’s suggestions will not improve your documents. Its best features are identifying 
minor problems such as unsuitable words or missing punctuation. It is particularly unsuited for 
creative writing that bends the rules of grammar. 
 

64
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Grammar : Click this item to open the Spelling and Grammar dialog box.  
  Ignore : Click this item to ignore this instance of the issue.  
  Hyperlink : Display the Insert Hyperlink dialog box so that you can create 
a hyperlink from the text.  
  New Comment : Create a new comment that refers to the word or phrase—
for example, you might query what the word or phrase should be.  
 Figure 2-25.   When using on-the-fly grammar checking, Ctrl-click or right-click a query to see what the problem is and 
whether the grammar checker has a suitable solution 
 If you choose to use on-the-fly grammar checking, the grammar checker puts a wavy green 
underline under any text that it queries. This may be a word, a phrase, or an entire sentence 
or more, depending on the query. You can then Ctrl-click or right-click the underlined text 
and choose an action from the context menu (see Figure  2-25 ):
  Replace the text with a suggestion : If the grammar checker offers one 
or more suggestions at the top of the menu, as in Figure  2-25 , click the 
one you want to use.  
 

65
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 When you check grammar along with spelling, the grammar checker runs in tandem with the 
spelling checker, so you see queries from both of them in the Spelling and Grammar dialog 
box. Figure  2-26 shows an example of a grammar query.  
 Figure 2-26.   If you choose to check grammar, the grammar checker runs alongside the spelling checker and displays 
queries in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box  
 

66
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 From the Spelling and Grammar dialog box, you can take the following  actions:  
  Edit the text : Click in the upper-left text box, and then type your fix for the 
problem. Click the Change button to apply the change in the document.  
  Ignore : Click this button to ignore this grammar issue once.  
  Ignore All : Click this button to ignore all instances of this grammar issue 
in this document.  
  Next Sentence : Click this button to move to the next sentence, even if 
you haven’t dealt with the current query.  
  Change : If the Suggestions box contains a suitable suggestion, click it, and 
then click this button to replace the offending text with the suggestion.  
  Undo : Click this button to undo the last change you made.  
  Cancel : Click this button to cancel the spelling and grammar check.  
 Controlling How the Spelling Checker Works in Word and PowerPoint 
 In Word and PowerPoint, you can control how the spelling checker works by setting options 
for it. It’s worth spending a few moments doing this to get the spelling checker working the 
way you prefer. 
 To make the most of the spelling checker in Word or  PowerPoint  , spend a few minutes 
customizing its settings. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences to display the Word Preferences 
window or PowerPoint ➤ Preferences to display the PowerPoint 
Preferences window.  
  2.   Display the Spelling and Grammar preferences or the Spelling 
preferences:
  Word : Click the Spelling and Grammar icon in the Authoring and Proofing 
Tools section. Figure  2-27 shows the Spelling & Grammar preferences pane 
for Word.  
 Note  You can’t set spelling options in Excel or Outlook. 

67
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  PowerPoint : Click the Spelling button on the toolbar. Figure  2-28 shows the 
Spelling pane in the PowerPoint Preferences window. As you can see, it 
contains fewer options than Word offers.  
 Figure 2-28.   PowerPoint has fewer spelling options than Word

pane in the Word Preferences window 
 
 

68
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 3. 
 To control the spelling checker, choose common options in the 
Spelling area:
  Always suggest corrections (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this check box 
to have the Spelling and Grammar dialog box or Spelling dialog box suggest 
corrections for spelling queries. This is usually helpful but may slow down an 
aging Mac that’s struggling to run Office.  
  Check spelling as you type (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this check box if 
you want the spelling checker to check spelling continually as you type. The 
spelling checker puts a wavy red underline under any word it queries. Clear 
this check box if you prefer to check spelling in a separate operation.  
  Hide spelling errors (PowerPoint only) : Select this check box if you want to 
hide spelling errors in the document.  
  Suggest from main dictionary only (Word only) : Select this check box if you 
want spelling suggestions only from Office’s main dictionary file, not from 
custom dictionaries you create. Usually, you’ll want to clear this check box so 
that the spelling checker uses your custom dictionaries as well.  
  Ignore words in UPPERCASE (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this check box if 
you want the spelling checker to skip words that appear in uppercase. This is 
usually helpful because it helps you avoid queries on technical terms.  
  Ignore words with numbers (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this check box to 
have the spelling checker skip any word that includes numbers (for example, 
IPv6). Clear this check box if you tend to get number typos in words and need 
the spelling checker to help root them out.  
  Ignore Internet and file path addresses (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this 
check box to make the spelling checker ignore any URLs (for example, 
  www.apress.com  ) and file addresses (for example, \\server2\reference\manual.pdf). 
This option is usually helpful.  
  Flag repeated words (Word only) : Select this check box to allow the spelling 
checker to query a word that appears twice in succession. This option is 
good at picking up useless duplication, although you may sometimes need to 
approve a deliberate repetition.  
  Use German post-reform rules (Word and PowerPoint) : Select this check box 
if you need to use post-reform German spelling rather than traditional spelling 
in German-language documents. In Word, this check box appears in the 
Advanced Language Settings dialog box rather than directly in the Spelling & 
Grammar pane.  
 Tip   You can also open the Spelling preferences by clicking the Options button in the Spelling and 
Grammar dialog box in Word or the Spelling dialog box in PowerPoint. 

69
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  French modes (Word and PowerPoint) : In this pop-up menu, choose which 
spelling type you want the spelling checker to use: traditional and new 
spellings, traditional spelling, or new spelling. In Word, this pop-up menu 
appears in the Advanced Language Settings dialog box.  
  Custom dictionary (Word only) : In this pop-up menu, select the custom 
dictionary you want to add words to when you use the Add command when 
checking spelling. For information on how to use custom dictionaries, see the 
“Taking Control over Spelling Checks with Custom Dictionaries” section later 
in this chapter.  
 4. 
 To control grammar checking in Word, choose settings for the 
following options:
  Check grammar as you type : Select this check box if you want the grammar 
checker to raise queries as you work. The grammar checker puts a wavy 
green underline under items it queries. On-the-fly grammar checking tends to 
be distracting, so you’ll probably want to clear this check box.  
  Check grammar with spelling : Select this check box if you want to use the 
grammar checker. Otherwise, clear it.  
  Show readability statistics : Select this check box if you want the spelling 
checker to display the Readability Statistics dialog box when it finishes a 
spelling check.  
 5. 
 For Word, you can also choose advanced language settings and 
grammar and style options. See the next two sections for details.  
 6. 
 When you’ve finished choosing options for the spelling checker, 
close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.   
 Tip  Don’t bother with the readability statistics. The counts of words, characters, paragraphs, 
and sentences can be useful, but you can get the first three more easily in the Word Count dialog 
box (click the Words readout on the status bar or choose Tools ➤ Word Count from the menu bar). 
The averages of sentences per paragraph, words per sentence, and characters per word have 
little relevance. The Passive Sentences, Flesch Reading Ease, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are 
computed statistics that don’t accurately assess how easy or hard the document is to read. If you 
want to know whether a document is hard to understand, ask a colleague to read it. 

70
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Choosing Advanced Language Settings for Word 
 In Word, you can choose further language settings by clicking the Advanced Language 
Settings button and making your choices in the  Advanced Language Settings  dialog box 
(see Figure  2-29 ). Apart from the “Use German post-reform rules” check box and the French 
modes pop-up menu mentioned in the previous section, the Advanced Language Settings 
dialog box contains the following controls:
  Enforce accented uppercase in French : Select this check box if your 
documents use a French dialect (such as Canadian French) that retains 
accents on uppercase letters rather than removing the accents (as in 
standard French).  
 Figure 2-29.   Word’s Advanced Language Settings dialog box includes advanced settings for German, French, Russian, 
Spanish, and Portuguese  
  Russian :  Enforce strict ë in Russian : Select this check box to make the 
spelling checker enforce the use of the  ë character in Russian-language 
documents.  
  Spanish modes : In this pop-up menu, choose whether to use the Tuteo 
verb forms, the Voseo verb forms, or both for the second person. The 
choices are Tuteo verb forms only, Tuteo and Voseo verb forms, and 
Voseo verb forms only.  
 

71
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Portuguese modes : In this pop-up menu, choose whether to use 
post-reform rules, pre-reform rules, or both in Portuguese-language 
documents.  
  Brazilian modes : In this pop-up menu, choose whether to use post-
reform rules, pre-reform rules, or both in documents that use Brazilian 
Portuguese.  
 Choosing Grammar and Style Options for Word and Outlook 
 When choosing proofing options for Word in the  Spelling and Grammar dialog box  , you can 
also choose options for the grammar checker. 
 If you turn on the grammar checker by selecting the “Check grammar with spelling” check 
box (and the “Check grammar as you type” check box if you want ongoing error checking as 
well), click the Settings button to display the Grammar Settings dialog box (see Figure  2-30 ), 
which enables you to choose the settings you need.  
 At the top of the Grammar Settings dialog box is the Writing style pop-up menu. As of this 
writing, this pop-up menu offers only one choice: Grammar. In Word 2011, this pop-up 
menu offered five settings—Casual, Standard, Formal, Technical, and Custom—for different 
checking needs, plus Grammar Only and Grammar & Style settings. 
 Figure 2-30.   Use the Grammar Settings dialog box to control which grammar and style issues the grammar checker 
raises when checking your documents 
 

72
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 It is not clear whether Microsoft intends to restore this grammar-checking flexibility to Word 
2016. As it is, you can choose which specific items to check by selecting the check boxes 
in the Grammar and Style options box. For example, if you want the Spelling and Grammar 
checker to check for commonly misused words but leave punctuation and its positioning to 
you, select the Misused Words check box but clear the Punctuation check box. 
 When you have finished choosing grammar and style options, click the OK button to close 
the Grammar Settings dialog box.  
 Taking Control of Spelling Checks with Custom  Dictionaries  
 The spelling checker uses a dictionary file for the language you’ve chosen (for example, 
U.S. English). The dictionary file consists of a list of words that are spelled correctly; unlike a 
conventional dictionary, the file doesn’t contain definitions for the words. 
 You can’t change the main dictionary file, but you can add to it by creating custom dictionaries 
containing words you don’t want the spelling checker to query. For example, you may need to 
include technical terms in your documents that the main dictionary file doesn’t contain. 
 Understanding How Custom Dictionaries Work 
 Office starts you off with a custom dictionary named Custom Dictionary. Office stores this 
dictionary inside a folder with a custom name such as  UBF8T346G3.Office in your  ~/Library/
Group Containers folder (where the tilde,  ~ , represents your home folder) . Office sets the 
Office apps to add words to the custom dictionary automatically during spelling checks. So 
when you give the Add command as described earlier in this chapter, the spelling checker 
adds the word to your custom dictionary. 
 You can stick with using just this Custom Dictionary file if you want, but it’s often useful to 
create extra custom dictionaries that contain different types of terms. You can then choose 
which custom dictionaries to load for a particular project. For example, you may work on 
some technical documents that need the spelling checker to accept various technical terms, 
but you may want the spelling checker to query the same terms in your other documents. 
 Normally, you just add words to your custom dictionaries, but you may sometimes need to 
remove words you’ve added and no longer want the spelling checker to accept.  
 Managing Your Custom Dictionaries 
 Office provides the Custom Dictionaries dialog box for creating, editing, and managing 
custom dictionaries. Here’s how to open the Custom Dictionaries dialog box:
 1. 
 In Word, choose Word ➤ Preferences to display the Word 
Preferences window.  
 2. 
 Click the Spelling & Grammar icon in the Authoring and Proofing 
Tools section to display the Spelling & Grammar preferences pane.  
 3. 
 Click the Dictionaries button to display the Custom Dictionaries dialog 
box (shown in Figure  2-31 with several dictionaries already added).  

73
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Creating a Custom Dictionary 
 To create a new custom dictionary, follow these steps in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box:
 1. 
 Click the New button to open the Save dialog box.  
 2. 
 In the Save As text box, type the name you want to give the new 
dictionary. You can use pretty much any name you want as long as 
there’s no file of that name in the folder you use.  
 3. 
 Select the folder in which you want to store the dictionary. If the 
dictionary is solely for your own use, you might save it in a folder in 
your user account. If you need to share the dictionary with others, 
use a network folder.  
 4. 
 Click the Save button. The app closes the New Dictionary dialog box 
and creates the dictionary. The dictionary appears in the list box in 
the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.  
 5. 
 Select the check box next to the dictionary.  
 Figure 2-31.   Use the Custom Dictionaries dialog box in Word to create, edit, and manage your custom dictionaries 
 

74
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 The dictionary is now ready for use, but you may need to change its language. Word 
chooses the (none) setting in the Language pop-up menu, which sets the dictionary for use 
with all languages (by not restricting it to a particular language). If you want to restrict the 
dictionary to a particular language, click the dictionary in the list box, and then choose the 
language from the Language pop-up menu. 
 Adding Words to or Removing Words from a Custom Dictionary 
 Normally, you build a custom dictionary one word at a time by using the Add command 
when checking spelling. But you can also open a custom dictionary file for editing so that 
you can make wider-ranging changes to it. This is useful when you need to add a whole 
list of words to the dictionary or when you need to remove a word that you’ve added by 
mistake. 
 To edit a custom dictionary, follow these steps from the Custom Dictionaries dialog box:
 1. 
 Click the custom dictionary in the list box.  
 2. 
 Click the Edit button to open the dictionary for editing. Word opens 
the dictionary in a document window, just like any other document 
(see Figure  2-32 ).  
 Note  If you already have a custom dictionary file (for example, one your company has created), 
click the Add button in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box. In the Add Dictionary dialog box, select 
the dictionary file, and then click the Open button. The dictionary then appears in the list box in the 
Custom Dictionaries dialog box, and you can select its check box to make it active. 
 Note   If you’re using automatic spell checking, when you open a dictionary for editing, Word 
displays a dialog box warning you that it will turn off automatic spell checking. Click the OK button 
to proceed. After editing the dictionary, you need to turn automatic spell checking back on—if you 
don’t, Word will leave it turned off. 

75
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  3.  Change the list of words by using standard editing techniques. Type 
each entry in a separate paragraph, pressing the Return key to create 
a new paragraph.  
 4. 
 Click the Save button on the title bar (or choose File ➤ Save or press 
Cmd+S) to save the dictionary.  
 5. 
 Click the Close button on the title bar to close the dictionary file.  
 Turning Off, Removing, or Deleting a Custom Dictionary 
 When you want to stop using a custom dictionary for the time being, clear its check box in 
the list box in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box. The dictionary remains in the list, and you 
can start using it again at any point by selecting its check box. 
 Note   If Word turned off automatic spell checking when you opened the dictionary for editing, turn 
it back on when you finish editing. Choose Word ➤ Preferences to open the Preferences window, 
and then click the Spelling and Grammar icon to display the Spelling and Grammar preferences 
pane. Select the Check spelling as you type check box, and then close the Preferences window by 
clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 Figure 2-32.   When you open a dictionary file for editing, Word uses a regular document window rather than a special 
dialog box. Word turns off as-you-type spelling checking for the dictionary 
 

76
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 If you want to remove a custom dictionary from the list, click it in the list box, and then 
click the Remove button. The app removes the dictionary from the list, but its dictionary file 
remains in its current folder. If you need to start using the dictionary again, you can add it by 
clicking the Add button. 
 If you want to dispose of a custom dictionary, remove it as just described. Then open a 
Finder window to the folder that contains the file, and move the file to the Trash.  
 Printing Documents 
 These days, you probably share documents with others via e-mail frequently, but there 
will still be times when you need to print out hard copies of documents to share. For 
example, you may need to print letters or papers you write in Word, print a page of an Excel 
spreadsheet, or print a handout for a PowerPoint presentation. 
 In each of the Office apps, you can choose from a wide range of printing  options  to make 
the printout look the way you want. 
 When you need print, open the Print dialog box by clicking the Print button on the Quick 
Access toolbar, choosing File ➤ Print, or pressing the standard Cmd+P keyboard shortcut. 
 At first, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook usually display the Print dialog box with the details 
hidden (see Figure  2-33 ). From here, you can take essential actions such as changing the 
printer, choosing a preset set of printing options, or previewing the document. You can 
expand the dialog box by clicking the Show Details button at the bottom of the Print dialog 
box in order to see the quick preview and all the available options.  

77
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Figure  2-34 shows the Print dialog box for Excel with details displayed. The Print dialog 
box in each app is different because it contains controls suited to the document type that 
app produces. For example, in Word you can choose which pages to print and whether to 
include comments and tracked changes, while in PowerPoint you can choose which slides 
to print and whether to frame the slides. But in each case the basics are the same.  
 Figure 2-33.   If the Print dialog box opens with details hidden, click the Show Details button to expand it to its full size 
 

78
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 You’ll look at the app-specific options in the chapters on the individual apps. But these are 
the basic moves that you can use in any of the apps:
  Choose the printer : Open the Printer pop-up menu and choose the 
printer to use. If you need to add a printer, click the Add Printer item on 
this menu. 
 Tip  OS X lets you either set a particular printer as your default printer or print to whichever printer 
you last used. To adjust this setting, open the Printer pop-up menu in the Print dialog box, and then 
click Printers & Scanners Preferences to display the Printers & Scanners preferences pane in System 
Preferences. Open the Default Printer pop-up menu, and then choose either the printer you want or the 
Last Printer Used setting. Click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar), choose 
System Preferences ➤ Quit System Preferences, or press Cmd+Q to quit System Preferences. 
 Figure 2-34.   When you need to print only part of a document or print multiple copies, open the Print dialog box and 
choose the appropriate settings. This is the Print dialog box for Excel 
 

79
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Choose a preset : Open the Presets pop-up menu and choose the preset 
group of settings to use. Normally, the Presets pop-up menu contains 
only the Standard preset and the Last Used Settings preset until you 
define your own presets.  
  Change the number of copies : To print more than one copy, type the number 
in the Copies box. If you want the sheets of each copy in order (1,2,3), 
select the Collated check box; clear this check box if you want all the 
copies of each page together.  
  Create a PDF of the document : To create a file in the widely used Portable 
Document Format (PDF), click the PDF button, and then click Save 
as PDF in the pop-up menu. In the Save dialog box (see Figure  2-35 ), 
specify the file name in the Save As box and the folder either in the 
Where pop-up menu or in the navigation pane. Then enter any metadata 
the document needs: the title, author, subject, and keywords (press the 
Return key after each keyword to create a keyword button). If you want 
to secure the PDF with a password for opening or printing it, click the 
Security Options button, and then work in the PDF Security Options 
dialog box. When you’re ready to save the PDF, click the Save button. 
The app automatically closes the Print dialog box for you.  
 Tip   When you’ve chosen a group of printing settings you’d like to use again, create a preset for 
them. Open the Presets pop-up menu and click Save Current Settings as Preset to display the Save 
Current Settings as Preset dialog box. Type the name for the preset in the Preset Name box. In the 
Preset Available For area, select the Only this printer option button or the All printers option button. 
Then click the OK button to close the dialog box. The app adds the preset to the Presets pop-up 
menu, and it’s ready for use. 

80
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
  Preview the document : In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, the Print dialog 
box displays a quick preview of the document. You can click the First 
(<<), Previous (<), Next (>), and Last (>>) buttons below the preview to 
change the page displayed.  
  Print the document : When you’ve chosen the settings you want, click 
the Print button. The app closes the Print dialog box and sends the 
details of the print job to the print queue for the printer.  
 Figure 2-35.   In the Save dialog box, you can add a title, author, subject, and any keywords needed to a PDF file you’re 
creating from an Office document 
 Tip   If you just need to e-mail a PDF version of the document without adding metadata or applying 
a password, you can save a step by choosing the Mail PDF command from the PDF pop-up menu 
in the Print dialog box. The app creates a new message in your default e-mail app (for example, 
Outlook) and attaches a PDF file of the document to the message. Similarly, you can send a PDF 
version of the document quickly via Messages by choosing the Send PDF via Messages command 
from the PDF pop-up menu. 
 

81
CHAPTER 2: Learning Common Tools Across the Office Suite
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to use several common features of the Office apps. You 
now know how to control apps using the menus, the Quick Access Toolbar, and the Ribbon; 
how to use the common palettes in the Toolbox; and how to share your documents quickly 
and easily with other people in formats they can read. 
 You also looked at ways to save time and effort by using the AutoCorrect feature and those 
AutoFormat options that you find helpful (while turning off any options that cause unpleasant 
surprises as you work). You can now choose settings for the spelling checker and grammar 
checker, run one or both, and choose which of its suggestions to accept and which to reject. 
And you know how to preview your documents and print them. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you further vital skills for making the most of the Office apps: 
how to work with text; use Cut, Copy, and Paste; and create tables and hyperlinks.

 Chapter 3  
 Working with Text 
 In this chapter, I’ll show you how to work with text in the Office apps. As you’ll see, the 
operations are almost the same for each app, so once you learn to work with text in one 
app, you’ll be able to work with text in each of the other apps too. 
 You’ll start with entering text itself by using the keyboard or other means. Then you’ll move 
to navigating with the keyboard and selecting objects. You’ll then learn to apply direct 
formatting to text and objects; use the Cut, Copy, and Paste features; and use the core Find 
and Replace features that the apps share. Next, I’ll show you how to create tables, enter text 
in them, and format them to look good. Finally, you’ll learn to add to your Office documents 
hyperlinks that lead the user to another document, take them to a web site, or start a new 
e-mail message automatically. 
 Entering Text in Your Documents 
 The main way to enter text in your Office documents is to type it with the keyboard, but 
you can also paste text from other documents, scan documents and use optical character 
recognition (OCR) to identify the text in them, or use dictation. Beyond the regular characters 
that appear on the keyboard, some documents will likely need symbols that don’t appear on 
it, so you need to know how to enter those as well. 
 Note   To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do 
so, click the app’s menu (such as the Word menu) and then click Preferences. In the Preferences 
window, click View to display the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, Show” area, select the Group Titles 
check box, and then close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at 
the left end of the window’s title bar). 

84
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Entering Text in Documents Using Copy and Paste 
 To enter text  using Copy and Paste  , copy the text from the document that contains it, and 
then paste it into the Office document. See the section “Using Cut, Copy, and Paste” later in 
this chapter.  
 Entering Text by Scanning a Document and Using Optical 
Character Recognition 
 If you have a document that contains the text you want to use in an Office document, you 
can scan the text using a scanner and then use  optical character  recognition to get the text 
out of the picture file that the scanner produces. 
 To perform the scanning, you need a scanner and third-party OCR software such as 
OmniPage Pro X (   www.nuance.com  ) or Readiris Pro (   www.irislink.com  ). And to use the text 
from a hard-copy document in a document of your own, you will typically need to get 
permission from the copyright holder. 
 Entering Text by Using Dictation 
 You can use OS X’s built-in  Dictation  feature to insert text in documents in the Office apps. 
If your work (or play) conditions are conducive to dictation, this can be a great way to enter 
text quickly and accurately. If you’re in an open environment and don’t want your immediate 
neighbors or colleagues to know what you’re writing, dictation has obvious drawbacks. 
 Enabling Dictation on Your Mac 
 Follow these steps to enable the  Dictation  feature on your Mac:
 1. 
 Ctrl-click or right-click the System Preferences icon on the Dock. 
The context menu opens.  
 2. 
 Click the Dictation & Speech item on the context menu. The System 
Preferences app opens, showing the Dictation & Speech preferences 
pane.  
 3. 
 Click the Dictation tab button if necessary to display the Dictation 
pane (see Figure  3-1 ).  
 Caution   When you use OCR to recognize a document, always read through the resulting text 
and compare it to the original. Although OCR does its best to recognize the text accurately, it often 
introduces errors—sometimes surprising ones. 

85
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 4. 
 On the left side of the Dictation pane, click the pop-up menu, and 
then click the microphone you want to use.  
 5. 
 On the Dictation line, select the On option button.  
 6. 
 Select the Use Enhanced Dictation check box.  
 7. 
 Make sure that the Language pop-up menu is showing the language 
you want to use, such as English (United States). If not, open the 
menu and select the right language.  
 Tip  Use a headset microphone for dictation if possible because you will get much better results 
from having the microphone positioned consistently close to your mouth to pick up your voice 
clearly. Place the microphone to the side of your mouth rather than in front of it so that it doesn’t 
pick up your breath stream. 
 Note   Enhanced Dictation enables you to use dictation while your Mac is offline. It also lets you 
dictate continuously instead of having to pause while your Mac communicates with Apple’s speech-
recognition servers. The only disadvantage to Enhanced Dictation is that your Mac must download 
and install a large (1.2GB) file before you can start using the feature. 
 Figure 3-1.   Use the controls in the Dictation pane in Dictation & Speech preferences to enable Dictation, activate the 
Enhanced Dictation feature, and choose your language and keyboard shortcut 
 

86
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 8. 
 In the Shortcut pop-up menu, choose the keyboard shortcut you 
want to use to toggle Dictation on and off. You can either choose one 
of the preset keyboard shortcuts, such as Press Fn (Function) Key 
Twice or Press Either Command Key Twice, or click Customize on 
the menu and then press the shortcut you want.  
 9. 
 Click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) 
or press Cmd+Q to quit System Preferences.   
 Entering Text Using Dictation 
 Now that you’ve enabled  Dictation  , you can dictate text by activating the app, pressing your 
keyboard shortcut, and then speaking into your microphone. 
 Inserting Symbols in a Document 
 By typing, you can easily  insert  any characters that appear on your keyboard—but many 
documents need other symbols, such as letters with dieresis marks over them (for example, 
Ä or ë) or ligatures that bind two characters (for example, Æ). 
 You can quickly insert one or more symbols in a Word document, Excel workbook, 
PowerPoint presentation, or Outlook item (such as a message) by using the Emoji & Symbols 
pane. In Word, you can also use the Symbol dialog box, which gives you access to a wider 
range of symbols. 
 Inserting a Symbol Using the Emoji & Symbols Panel 
 You can use the Emoji & Symbols panel to insert a symbol in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or 
Outlook. To insert a symbol, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 In the document, position the insertion point where you want the 
symbol to appear.  
 Caution   When you use Dictation, proofread your documents closely to catch substitutions of 
words and phrases. Simple mistakes such as substituting  can for  can’t are usually easy enough to 
catch, but if the Dictation replaces a whole phrase, you may have a hard time working out how the 
text should actually read. 
 Note   When you insert a symbol using the Emoji & Symbols pane, the app inserts the symbol 
character in the same font you’re currently using—if that font contains that character. If not, the 
app substitutes a font that does have the character. By contrast, when you use the Symbol dialog 
box, you can see exactly which symbols are available for a specific font. 

87
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 2. 
 Open the Emoji & Symbols panel (see Figure  3-2 ) in one of these ways:
  Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook : Choose Edit ➤ Emoji & 
Symbols from the menu bar or press Cmd+Ctrl+Space.  
  Excel or PowerPoint : Choose Insert ➤ Symbols ➤ Symbol from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Symbol from the menu bar.  
 Figure 3-2.   To insert a symbol in a document, open the Emoji & Symbols panel In PowerPoint (shown here) and Excel, 
you can choose Insert ➤ Symbols ➤ Symbol from the Ribbon to open the Emoji & Symbols panel  
 3. 
 Explore the Emoji & Symbols panel to find the symbol you need. The left 
screen in Figure  3-3 shows the top part of the pop-up panel, with labels 
on the first several tabs at the bottom, and the right screen in Figure  3-3  
shows a lower part of the panel, with labels on the remaining tabs.  
 

88
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 4. 
 Find the symbol you want in one of these ways:
  Browse all symbols : Scroll up or down the Emoji & Symbols panel. 
The different sets of characters appear in a vertical stack that 
corresponds to the tabs: People at the top, Nature next, then Food 
& Drink, and so on.  
  Display only a particular set of symbols : Click the tab for the set of 
characters you want to view. For example, click the Travel & Places 
tab to display symbols showing taxis, trucks, planes, and the like.  
  Search for a symbol : Click the Search box at the top and type your 
search term.  
 5. 
 Click the symbol to insert it in the document. The Emoji & Symbols 
panel closes automatically.  
 When you need to insert multiple symbols in sequence, open the Emoji & Symbols panel and 
then click the Characters window button in the upper-right corner. (You need to be scrolled 
up to the top of the Characters panel for this button to be visible.) The Characters window 
opens (see Figure  3-4 ), giving you different options for browsing symbol, and staying open 
after you insert a symbol, so you can continue inserting other symbols.  
 Figure 3-3.   To insert a symbol in a workbook, click the symbol in the Characters pop-up panel. Click a tab at the 
bottom of the panel to display the set of symbols you want

 When you finish using the Characters window, close it by clicking the Close button (the red 
button) at the left end of its title bar.  
 Inserting a Symbol or Special Character Using the Symbol Dialog Box 
in Word 
 When you want to reach the full range of symbols that Word has to offer, use the Symbol 
dialog box instead of the Emoji & Symbols panel. The Symbol dialog box also contains a 
pane called Special Characters that lets you quickly insert widely used symbols such as 
dashes and copyright characters. 
 To insert a symbol using the  Symbol dialog box  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Symbol ➤ Advanced Symbol from the Ribbon or 
Insert ➤ Advanced Symbol from the menu bar to display the Symbol 
dialog box (see Figure  3-5 ). 
 Figure 3-4.   Use the Character window when you need to insert multiple symbols in sequence. Click the Add to 
Favorites button on the right side to add the selected character to your Frequently Used list

CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 2. 
 Open the Font pop-up menu, and then click the font you want to 
use. The item named “(normal text)” that appears at the top of the list 
shows the symbol characters in the font you’re using.  
 3. 
 If you need to see a larger version of a symbol, click it to display a 
preview box.  
 4. 
 To insert a symbol, click it, and then click the Insert button; you can 
also simply double-click the symbol. When you insert a symbol, the 
Symbol dialog box remains open, but the Cancel button changes to 
a Close button.  
 5. 
 Insert other symbols as needed.  
 Tip   After clicking a symbol to display its preview, you can continue to hold down the button on 
your pointing device and drag in any direction to preview other symbols. Alternatively, release the 
button on your overworked pointing device and then press the arrow keys to move the preview to 
other characters. This move is useful when you’re looking for a symbol that’s hard to distinguish 
from similar symbols around it. 
 Figure 3-5.   The Symbol dialog box in Word gives you access to a wide range of symbols and special characters. Click a 
character to display a larger preview, as shown here 
 

91
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 6. 
 Click the Close button to close the Symbol dialog box.  
 To insert a special character, open the Symbol dialog box by choosing Insert ➤ Symbol ➤ 
Advanced Symbol from the Ribbon or Insert ➤ Advanced Symbol from the menu bar, and 
then click the Special Characters tab (see Figure  3-6 ). Click the character you want to insert, 
and then click the Insert button—or, as before, double-click the character you want to insert. 
Click the Close button to close the Symbol dialog box.  
 Figure 3-6.   The Symbol dialog box includes the Special Characters tab, which gives you quick access to widely used 
symbols such as em dashes and en dashes, optional hyphens, and fixed-width spaces  
 When you’ve selected a symbol or special character in the Symbol dialog box, you can click 
the AutoCorrect button to start creating an AutoCorrect entry for that character or the 
Keyboard Shortcut button to start creating a keyboard shortcut for it.  
 Tip   If you often use the same words that include symbols or special characters, create an 
AutoCorrect entry for each of those words. This is usually much easier than using an AutoCorrect 
entry to enter a particular character within a word. 
 Tip  You can leave the Symbol box open and click in the Word document to resume work in the 
document. For example, you can type some text in the document, or reposition the insertion point, 
and then click in the Symbol dialog box and use it to insert another symbol character.

CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Navigating with the Keyboard and Selecting Objects 
 In OS X, the main means of moving around in a document is by using the pointing device. 
For example, you can click an object to select it, drag the scroll box down the scroll bar to 
move down the document, or click to place the insertion point where you want to type text. 
 When you’re typing in a document, you may find it handier to use the keyboard to move the 
insertion point. Table  3-1 explains the standard  keyboard  shortcuts you can use to move the 
insertion point in the Office apps.
 Table 3-1.  Keyboard Shortcuts for Moving the Insertion Point in the Office Apps 
 Press These Keys 
 To Move the Insertion Point Like This 
 Left arrow 
 One character to the left 
 Right arrow 
 One character to the right 
 Up arrow 
 Up one line, paragraph, or cell 
 Down arrow 
 Down one line, paragraph, or cell 
 Home 
 To the start of the line or object 
 End 
 To the end of the line or object 
 Cmd+Home 
 To the start of the document 
 Cmd+End 
 To the end 
 Option+Left arrow 
 To the beginning of the current word (if the insertion point is in a word) 
or to the beginning of the previous word 
 Option+Right arrow 
 To the beginning of the next word 
 
 To work with text or an object in a document, you select that text or object by using the 
pointing device or the keyboard:
  Select with the pointing device : Click at the beginning of what you 
want to select, hold down the button, and then drag to the end of the 
selection.  
  Select with the pointing device and keyboard : Click to place the 
insertion point at the beginning of what you want to select. Hold down 
the Shift key, and click at the end of the selection.  
  Select with the keyboard : Move the insertion point to the beginning of 
the selection, hold down the Shift key, and then move the insertion point 
to the end of the selection (for example, by pressing the arrow keys).  
 Note  Because Excel’s worksheets consist of cells rather than containing paragraphs, many of the 
keyboard shortcuts have different effects in Excel. 

93
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Applying Direct Formatting to Text and Objects 
 Each of the Office apps lets you apply a wide range of formatting to the text and objects you 
add to your documents. Each app has different types of formatting suited to its needs, but 
all the apps support direct formatting—formatting that you  apply  directly to text or to an 
object, such as bold and italic.  
 The easiest way of applying most direct formatting is by using the controls and buttons 
on the Home tab of the Ribbon. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have a Font group on the 
Home tab, and Outlook has a similar but unnamed group. Word and PowerPoint also have 
a Paragraph group for applying paragraph formatting. Figure  3-7 shows the Home tab in 
PowerPoint with the Font group labeled.  
 Note  Direct formatting is easy to use, but in Word and Excel, you can save time by formatting with 
styles instead. A  style is a collection of formatting that you can apply in a single click. Not only can 
you apply formatting more quickly with styles, but you can also change the style’s formatting and 
have the app automatically apply the change to the text that uses the style. This saves even more 
time and keeps your documents consistent. 
 Tip   In Word, you can also select multiple items at once. Select the first item as usual, using either 
the pointing device or the keyboard. Then hold down the Cmd key as you select each of the other 
items with the pointing device. Similarly, in Excel, you can press Cmd and click cells or ranges to 
add them to what you have already selected. 
 Figure 3-7.   The Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon includes widely used formatting tools. This is the Font group 
in PowerPoint 
 

94
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 The Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon in Word and PowerPoint contains 
controls for formatting paragraphs. Figure  3-8 shows the Paragraph group in Word.  
 Figure 3-8.   The Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon in Word (shown here) and PowerPoint provides 
essential commands for applying direct formatting to paragraphs 
 With a few exceptions, the controls in these groups are for applying direct formatting. And 
they’re easy to use. In most cases, you select the text or other object you want to affect and 
then click the button. Here are some examples:
  Apply bold : Select the text you want to affect, or click in a single word. 
Then click the Bold button to apply bold. Click again to remove bold.  
  Change the font : Select the text you want to affect. Click the Font pop-
up menu, and then click the font name you want.  
  Change the font size : Select the text you want to affect, then click the 
Font Size pop-up menu, and finally click the point size you want: 8, 9, 
10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or whatever. For a quick change, click the 
Increase Font Size button to move up one of the steps in the Font Size 
pop-up menu (for example, from 9 to 10 points or from 18 to 20 points), 
or click the Decrease Font Size button to move down one size.  
  Change the alignment : Click in the paragraph or click the object you 
want to affect, and then click the Align Text Left button, the Center Text 
button, the Align Text Right button, or the Justify Text button, as needed.  
 You can also apply widely used direct formatting by using keyboard shortcuts. Table  3-2 
lists the most useful keyboard shortcuts for applying direct formatting.

 Using Cut, Copy, and Paste 
 If you’ve worked with OS X apps before, you’re almost certainly familiar with the Cut, Copy, 
and  Paste  features. You can use these features as usual in the Office apps by using either 
keyboard shortcuts or the buttons in the Clipboard group on the Home tab of the Ribbon 
(see Figure  3-9 ):
  Cut : Click the Cut button or press Cmd+X.  
  Copy : Click the Copy button or press Cmd+C.  
  Paste : Click the Paste button or press Cmd+V.  
 After you paste text or an object, you can use the Paste Options button that the app 
displays to change the way in which you pasted it. For example, in Word, the Paste Options 
button’s pop-up menu (see Figure  3-10 ) frequently offers these choices:
  Keep source formatting : Click this item to maintain the formatting of the 
item you’ve pasted.  
 Figure 3-9.   You can perform Cut, Copy, and Paste operations by using the Cut, Copy, and Paste buttons in the Clipboard 
group on the Home tab of the Ribbon 
 

96
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
  Use destination theme : Click this item to apply the theme of the 
destination document to what you’ve pasted in.  
  Match destination formatting : Click this item to make the pasted 
item take on the formatting of the paragraph or object into which 
you’ve pasted it. This formatting may or may not be different from the 
destination theme formatting.  
  Keep text only : Click this item to keep only the text of the pasted item, 
discarding all formatting and any nontext objects (such as graphics).  
 Using Find and Replace 
 When you need to locate specific text quickly in an Office document, use the Find feature. 
And when you need to replace specific text with other text, use the Replace feature. 
 Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook implement  Find and Replace  in different ways suited 
to their needs. This section introduces you to the basics of Find and Replace. The chapters 
on the individual apps provide further details on advanced Find and Replace features you 
may need to use. 
 Searching Quickly with the Search Box on the Title Bar 
 When you need to search quickly for a word or phrase, use the  Search box  at the right end 
of the title bar. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click in the Search box to place the insertion point there.  
 2. 
 If necessary, click the Search pop-up menu button (click the Search 
icon itself or the downward arrow just to the right of the Search 
icon), and choose options as discussed next. Figure  3-11 shows the 
Search pop-up menu for Excel, which has the most choices.
  Word : Click the List Matches in Sidebar item if you want to display 
the Sidebar containing all the matches for the search term. Click the 
Replace item if you want to display the Find and Replace pane in 
the Sidebar.  
 Figure 3-10.   After pasting an item, you can use the Paste Options button to change the formatting used. This is the 
Paste Options menu you often see in Word 
 

97
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
  Excel : Click the Search in Sheet item if you want to search just the 
displayed worksheet, or click the Search in Workbook item to search 
the whole workbook (including the displayed worksheet). Excel 
displays a check mark next to the item you chose so that you can see 
what you’re searching. Click the Advanced Search item to display the 
Find dialog box (which you’ll meet shortly). Click the Replace item to 
display the Replace dialog box (which you’ll also meet shortly).  
  PowerPoint : Click the Advanced Find item to display the Advanced 
Find dialog box, in which you can choose to match the case on 
searches or find only whole words rather than partial matches. Click 
the Replace item to display the Replace dialog box. Click the Replace 
Fonts item to display the Replace Font dialog box, which enables you 
to replace one font with another through a presentation.  
  Outlook : Outlook has no pop-up menu button.  
 3. 
 Type the search term in the Search box.  
 4. 
 In Excel or PowerPoint, press the Return key to run the search. Word 
and Outlook search automatically as you enter the search term.  
 5. 
 Click the Next button (the gray triangle pointing to the right) to move 
to the next instance of the term, or click the Previous button (the gray 
triangle pointing to the left) to move to the previous instance.  
 When you need to clear the Search box so that you can search for another term, click the × 
button at its right end.  
 Locating Text with the Find Dialog Box or Advanced Find 
Dialog Box 
 The Search box is easy to use, but often you’ll want to locate text with more precision—for 
example, by matching the case used (rather than using non-case-sensitive matching) or 
by finding only whole-word matches rather than partial-word matches. To get these extra 
features, you need to use the Find dialog box or the  Advanced Find dialog box  , depending 
on the app you’re using. 
 Figure 3-11.   From the Search box on the Standard toolbar, you can search quickly or access search options. These are 
the search options for Excel 
 

98
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 To open and use the Find dialog box or the Advanced Find dialog box, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Find dialog box or the Advanced Find dialog box by using 
the appropriate command or keyboard shortcut:
  Word : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find and Replace from the 
menu bar to display the Find and Replace dialog box with the Find 
tab at the front (see Figure  3-12 ). 
  Excel : Choose Edit ➤ Find from the menu bar, or click the Search 
pop-up menu at the right end of the toolbar and then click 
Advanced Find, to display the Find dialog box (see Figure  3-13 ). 
 Figure 3-12.   Word’s Find and Replace dialog box at first opens at its smaller size. You can display further options by 
clicking the arrow button in the lower-left corner. To find single instances of the search term, clear the Highlight all 
items found in check box 
 Figure 3-13.   Excel’s Find dialog box lets you choose whether to search the current worksheet or the whole workbook; 
whether to search by rows or columns; and whether to search in formulas, values, or comments

CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
  PowerPoint : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find from the menu 
bar, or click the Search pop-up menu at the right end of the toolbar 
and then click Advanced Find, to display the Advanced Find dialog 
box (see Figure  3-14 ).  
  Outlook : In a message window, choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Find to 
display the Find dialog box (see Figure  3-15 ). When you need 
greater search power, choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find to 
display the Search tab of the Ribbon (see Figure  3-16 ), which 
enables you to specify exactly what you’re searching for and where 
to look for it.  
 Figure 3-14.   PowerPoint’s Advanced Find dialog box includes options for matching the case on searches and finding 
only whole-word matches 
 Figure 3-15.   Outlook’s Find dialog box contains no extra options. The right-arrow button finds the next instance of the 
search term, while the left-arrow button finds the previous instance 
 Figure 3-16.   You can use the Search tab in Outlook to perform more focused searches. For example, you can search a 
particular mailbox, restricting the search to the From field and finding only unread messages marked Important

CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 2. 
 In the Find What box, type or paste the text you want to find.  
 3. 
 Choose any options needed. For example, select the Match case 
check box to make the search find only items that use the same case 
as the text you’ve typed.  
 4. 
 Click the Find Next button to find the next instance of the search term.  
 5. 
 Click the Close button when you finish finding items.  
 Replacing Text with Replace 
 To  replace text  in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Search pane in the Sidebar, the Find and Replace dialog 
box, or the Replace dialog box:
  Word : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Replace from the menu bar or press 
Cmd+Shift+H to display the Search pane in the Sidebar (shown on 
the left in Figure  3-17 ). For more options, you can choose Edit ➤ 
Find ➤ Advanced Find and Replace to display the Find and Replace 
dialog box and then click the Replace tab (shown on the right in 
Figure  3-17 ). 
 Tip  If you’ve performed a search earlier in this session of working with this app, you can open the 
pop-up menu on the Find What box and select the term again. 
 Note   In Word, you can select the “Highlight all items found in” check box to make Word highlight 
all the instances of the search term in the main document (or the other area you choose in the pop-
up menu). This is helpful when you need to get an overview of where the search term appears in 
the document. When this check box is selected, the Find and Replace dialog box contains a Find All 
button rather than a Find Next button. 

101
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Figure 3-17.   Word provides two tools for replacing text. The Search pane in the Sidebar (top) shows you all the 
matches for the search term and lets you quickly move among them. The Replace tab of the Find and Replace dialog 
box (bottom) provides more search options when you need them 
 

102
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
  Excel : Choose Edit ➤ Replace from the menu bar, or click the 
Search pop-up menu at the right end of the toolbar and then click 
Replace, to display the Replace dialog box (see Figure  3-18 ). 
  PowerPoint : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Replace or press Cmd+Shift+H 
to display the Replace dialog box (see Figure  3-19 ). 
 2. 
 In the Find What box, type or paste the text you want to find.  
 3. 
 In the Replace With box, type or paste the replacement text.  
 Figure 3-18.   Excel’s Replace dialog box includes options for matching case and limiting the replacement to the entire 
contents of cells rather than partial contents  
 Figure 3-19.   PowerPoint’s Replace dialog box lets you match case or find only whole words 
 
 

103
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 4. 
 If you need to use any other options, select them. For example, select the 
“Find whole words only” check box in Word or PowerPoint to find only 
whole-word matches rather than partial-word matches (for instance, you 
may need to replace  hand without replacing  beforehand or  underhand ).  
 5. 
 Click the button for the operation you want to perform:
  Find Next : Click this button to find the next instance of the search term. 
  Replace : Click this button to replace the current instance of the 
search term with the replacement term and find the next instance of 
the search term.  
  Replace All : Click this button to replace every instance of the search 
term with the replacement term.  
 6. 
 When you have finished searching, click the Close button to close the 
Find and Replace dialog box or the Replace dialog box, or click the 
Close button (the × button) to close the Search pane in Word. The Close 
button replaces the Cancel button when you start replacing items.  
 Creating Tables 
 When you need to lay out data in a regular grid, create a table. A table consists of cells, 
which are rectangular areas formed by the intersection of rows and columns. Each table can 
contain one or more rows and one or more columns. 
 Inserting a Table 
 The most straightforward way of adding a table to a Word document or a PowerPoint slide is 
to insert it.  Inserting  a table gives you a regular table with the number of rows and columns 
you choose. You can insert a table either using the Table panel on the Ribbon or using the 
Insert Table dialog box. 
 Note   You can use tables in Word and PowerPoint. Excel’s worksheets already have a grid 
structure, so you don’t need to create tables for layout in Excel; instead, Excel uses the term  table 
to mean a database laid out on a worksheet (see Chapter   16  for details). 
 Tip  In Word and PowerPoint, if you’ve performed a search earlier in this session of working with this 
app, you can open the pop-up menu on the Find What box and select the term again. If you’ve performed 
a replacement, you can open the pop-up menu on the Replace With box and select the term again. 
 Note  In Word’s Search pane, click the Find button to find all the instances of the search term. 

104
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Inserting a Table Using the Table Panel on the Ribbon 
 To insert a table using the  Table panel  on the Ribbon, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Position the insertion point where you want the table to appear.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table, opening the Table panel 
(see Figure  3-20 ).  
 3. 
 Click the square for the table configuration you want—for example, a 
2×3 table is two columns wide and three rows deep.  
 Inserting a Table Using the Insert Table Dialog Box 
 When you need more control over a table’s behavior in Word, use the Insert Table dialog box 
to insert the table. You can also use the  Insert Table dialog box  in PowerPoint, but it has no 
discernible advantage over using the Table panel on the Ribbon. 
 To insert a table using the Insert Table dialog box, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Place the insertion point where you want the table to appear.  
 2. 
 Give the appropriate command:
  Word : From the Ribbon, choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table, and then 
click the Insert Table command near the bottom of the Table panel to 
display the Insert Table dialog box (shown on the left in Figure  3-21 ). 
You can also choose Table ➤ Insert ➤ Table from the menu bar.  
  PowerPoint : From the menu bar, choose Insert ➤ Table to display 
the Insert Table dialog box (shown on the right in Figure  3-21 ). 
 Figure 3-20.   To insert a table, choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table, and then click the square for the table configuration 
you want 
 

105
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 3. 
 Use the Number of columns box and the Number of rows box to set 
the dimensions of the table.  
 4. 
 In Word, select the appropriate option button in the AutoFit Behavior 
area:
  Initial column width : Select this option button to have Word set the 
width of each column. In the pop-up menu, choose Auto to have 
Word automatically set the width, or set the precise width you want 
(for example, 1.25").  
  AutoFit to contents : Select this option button to make Word 
automatically adjust each column’s width to fit its contents. This is 
often a good choice.  
  AutoFit to window : Select this option button to make Word 
automatically adjust each column’s width to suit the document 
window. This option is useful for tables you expect people to view 
on the screen at different window widths.  
 5. 
 Also in Word, select the “Set as default for new tables” check box if 
you want Word to store these settings for future use.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Insert Table dialog box, and insert 
the table in the document or slide.  
 Merging and Splitting Cells in a Table 
 To change the layout of the table, you can merge  cells  together to form a larger cell or split a 
cell into several smaller cells. 
 Figure 3-21.   Word’s Insert Table dialog box (left) lets you control AutoFit behavior and create default settings for new 
tables. PowerPoint’s Insert Table dialog box (right) lets you set only the numbers of columns and rows 
 

106
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 To merge cells together, select the cells, and then choose Layout ➤ Merge ➤ Merge Cells 
(that’s the Layout tab for tables, at the right end of the Ribbon, rather than the standard 
Layout tab). The app turns the selected cells into a single cell. Any contents of the previous 
cells appear as separate paragraphs in the merged cell. 
 To split a cell into multiple cells, click in the cell, and then choose Layout ➤ Merge ➤ Split 
Cells (again, that’s the Layout tab for tables). In the Split Cells dialog box that the app 
displays (see Figure  3-22 ), enter the number of columns and rows you want to create within 
the cell, and then click the OK button.  
 Adding Content to a Table 
 The most straightforward way to  add content  to a table is by clicking in the destination 
cell and then typing the text. Press the Tab key the insertion point to the next cell, or press 
Shift+Tab to move the insertion point to the previous cell. 
 You can also paste text into a table you’ve created. Simply click in the cell, and then paste 
the text (for example, click the Paste button on the Standard toolbar or press Cmd+V). 
 Tip  In Word, you can copy text that’s laid out with a tab between each separate item and then paste 
it into multiple cells at once. Copy the text from the source, switch to the destination document in 
Word, select the appropriate number of cells in the table, and then give the Paste command. 
 Figure 3-22.   Use the Split Cells dialog box to split one existing cell into two or more new cells 
 Note   In Word, if you select multiple cells for splitting, select the “Merge cells before split” check 
box to make Word treat all the selected cells as one cell. For example, if you select two cells, select 
the “Merge cells before split” check box, and specify four columns, you get four columns total. By 
contrast, if you select two cells, clear the “Merge cells before split” check box, and specify four 
columns, you get four columns from each cell, giving eight columns altogether. 
 

107
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 Formatting a Table 
 To make a table look the way you want, you format it. You can apply formatting either quickly 
by using a table style or manually by applying only the  formatting  the table needs. 
 To apply a table style, click anywhere in the table, and then choose Table Design ➤ Table 
Styles ➤ Quick Styles, choosing the style you want either from the Quick Styles box or 
from the Quick Styles panel (see Figure  3-23 ). You can browse the table styles in the box 
by clicking the left arrow button and the right arrow button, but usually it’s easier to use the 
panel. Move the pointer over the box so that the panel’s button appears below it, as shown 
in the figure, and then click the button to open the panel.  
 After applying a table style, you can customize it by selecting or clearing the check boxes in 
the Table Style Options group on the Table Design tab of the Ribbon. For example, select the 
Header Row check box to apply different formatting to the table’s first row so that it looks 
like a header, or select the First Column check box to apply different formatting to the first 
column if it contains headings. 
 Figure 3-23.   The quick way to format a table is to apply a style from the Quick Styles box or Quick Styles panel on the 
Table Design tab of the Ribbon 
 

108
CHAPTER 3: Working with Text
 If you prefer not to use a table style, you can format a table manually. These are the main 
techniques you need:
  Borders : Select the table or the cells you want to affect, choose Table 
Design ➤Borders ➤Borders, and then click the border style you want.  
  Shading : Select the table or the cells you want to affect, choose Table 
Design ➤Table Styles ➤ Shading, and then click the shading color.  
  Font formatting : Select the cell or cells you want to format, and then 
use the controls in the Font group of the Home tab of the Ribbon, as for 
other text.  
 Creating Hyperlinks 
 As you know from browsing the Web, a  hyperlink is text or an object on a web page that’s 
linked to another location, such as another web page or another place on the same web 
page. You can insert a hyperlink in just about any Office document—a Word document, an 
Excel workbook, a PowerPoint presentation, or an e-mail message or task you’re creating in 
Outlook. This section shows you how to create a hyperlink in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. 
 You can create both text  hyperlinks  and object hyperlinks. A text hyperlink appears as 
underlined text. An object hyperlink appears as just the object, such as a picture or a shape. 
For either type of hyperlink, you can choose whether to display a ScreenTip when the user 
holds the pointer over the hyperlink, as in the text hyperlink shown in Figure  3-24 . 
 To insert a hyperlink, follow these steps:

 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to work with text in the Office apps. You now know how to 
navigate with the keyboard; select objects using the pointing device, the keyboard, or both; 
and apply the most widely used types of formatting to text and objects. You can also use the 
Cut, Copy, and Paste features; find and replace text; and add tables and hyperlinks to your 
documents. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to add graphics to your documents and make them 
look good.  
 Note   To edit a hyperlink, Ctrl-click or right-click the text or object, click or highlight Hyperlink on the 
context menu, and then click Edit Hyperlink. The Office app opens the Edit Hyperlink dialog box, which 
is the Insert Hyperlink dialog box with a different name. To remove a hyperlink, Ctrl-click or right-click 
the text or object, click or highlight Hyperlink on the context menu, and then click Remove Hyperlink.

 Chapter 4  
 Using Pictures and Shapes 
in Your Documents 
 To give your documents visual interest, you can add various types of graphical content to 
them—graphics themselves (I’ll use this term to cover all kinds of pictures and images), 
shapes (anything from a simple arrow or circle to a complex shape), charts, and even movies. 
 This chapter shows you how to insert, crop, and resize pictures; how to insert shapes and 
format them; and how to position graphical objects where you want them. You’ll learn how 
to wrap text around a graphical object in Word, how to make a picture look the way you 
want it, and how to illustrate your documents by adding SmartArt diagrams. 
 I’ll start by going over how the Office apps handle graphical objects because understanding 
this is essential to mastering how to place objects. 
 Note   To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do 
so, click the app’s menu (such as the Excel menu) and then click Preferences. In the Preferences 
window, click View to display the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, Show” area, select the Group Titles 
check box, and then close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at 
the left end of the window’s title bar). 
 See Chapter   14  for instructions on creating charts in Excel. 
  Understanding How to Position Graphical Objects 
 Even though an Office document appears to be flat, it actually consists of multiple separate 
layers. Until you add objects to a layer, the layer is transparent, so you see through the layer to 
whatever is underneath. One layer contains the text; the other layers contain  graphical objects  . 

114
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
Having these multiple layers enables you to position one graphical object in front of another 
graphical object—for example, to superimpose one graphical object on another. Word also 
enables you to position graphical objects either in front of the text layer or behind the text layer. 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint let you position graphical objects in the graphics layers, where 
you can move them freely. Word also lets you position graphical objects as inline characters 
in the text layer. When you do this, Word places the graphical object just like a character in 
the document’s text. If you then insert text before the graphical object, it moves further down 
the document. 
 Outlook gives you far less control over graphical objects. You can add pictures to a message 
or attach an audio or video file, but that’s about all. You’ll look at how to do this in Chapter   22 . 
 Choosing Where to Insert a Graphical Object 
 Before inserting a graphical  object  , you need to place the insertion point or selection where 
you want to insert the object. Place the insertion point or selection like this:
  Word : Place the insertion point where you want to insert the object.  
  Excel : Click the cell where you want to place the upper-left corner of the 
object.  
  PowerPoint : Click the slide on which you want to insert the object, or 
select the placeholder in which you want to place the object. If the 
placeholder is a standard placeholder, you can click either of the Picture 
from File icons or the Insert Movie from File icon (see Figure  4-1 ) to start 
inserting a graphical object.  
 Figure 4-1.   Click either Picture from File icon in a standard placeholder on a PowerPoint slide to start inserting an 
image in that placeholder 
 

115
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Inserting Pictures into Documents 
 You can easily insert  pictures  , such as your own photos, in your Office documents. You can 
either insert pictures you’ve added to the Photos app or insert pictures that are in your Mac’s 
file system but not in the Photos app. 
 
GETTING CLIP ART
 Earlier versions of Office for Mac, including Office 2011, included a selection of clip art images that you could 
use freely in your documents, plus tools—such as the Clip Art Browser and Clip Art Gallery—for browsing and 
managing the images. You could also download extra clip art images from Microsoft’s web site; these would 
show up in the Clip Art Browser and Clip Art Gallery too. 
 Microsoft has removed the clip art selection and clip art tools from Office 2016. Instead, you need to find 
images yourself, either among your own photos or by searching online. 
 If you need images that you can use freely in your documents, search for images that have the right sort of 
license (the license specifies the types of usage permitted by the copyright holder, if there is one; if the image is 
in the public domain, you can use it freely). Here is how to find such images on Microsoft’s Bing search engine:
  1. 
 Click the Safari icon on the Dock or on the Launchpad screen to launch Safari (if it’s not 
running) or to switch to it (if it is running). 
  2. 
 Click the address box, type  bing.com , and press Return. The Bing home page appears. 
  3. 
 Click the Images tab at the top to specify that you want to search for images. 
  4. 
 Click in the Search box and start typing your search term. A list of suggested searches 
appears. 
  5. 
 Click the best match. Bing displays thumbnails of images matching the search. 
  6. 
 Click the License pop-up menu above the thumbnails and then click the type of license 
needed: Public domain; Free to share and use; Free to share and use commercially; Free 
to modify, share, and use; or Free to modify, share, and use commercially. Bing narrows 
down the selection of thumbnails to those with the type of license you chose. 
  7. 
 When you find a file you want to download, Cmd-click or right-click it, and then click Save 
Image As to display the Save Image As sheet. Specify the folder and filename, and then 
click the Save button. 
 Once you have saved an image to your Mac, you can insert it in a document by using the method explained in 
the “Inserting Pictures from Your Mac’s File System” section later in this chapter. 

116
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Inserting Pictures from the  Photos App  
 To insert a picture from the Photos app, follow these steps:
  1.  Give the appropriate command to open the Photo Browser 
(see Figure  4-2 ):
  Word : Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the menu bar.  
  Excel : Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Photo Browser from the menu bar.  
  PowerPoint : Choose Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Photo Browser from the menu bar.  
  Outlook : Choose Message ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the Ribbon or 
View ➤ Media Browser ➤ Photo Browser from the menu bar.  
 Figure 4-2.   Use the Photo Browser to add a picture from the Photos app to a document 
 

117
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  2.  Use the upper pane to navigate to the source of the pictures, such as 
the Albums list. Click a category’s name to display the pictures the 
category contains, or click the disclosure triangle to the left of the 
category’s name to expand the category, showing its contents. For 
example, in the figure, the Albums category is expanded, and the 
Favorites album is selected.  
  3.   Click the photo you want, and then drag it to the document window, 
dropping it where you want it to appear.  
  4.  Leave the Photo Browser window open if you want to use it further. 
Otherwise, click the Close button (the red button in its upper-left 
corner) to close it.  
 Inserting Pictures from Your Mac’s File System 
 To insert a picture that’s not in the Photos app but is stored in your Mac’s file  system or on a 
network drive, follow these steps:
  1.  Position the inserstion point or selection where you want the picture 
to appear.  
  2.  Give the appropriate command to open the Choose a Picture dialog 
box (see Figure  4-3 ).
  Word : Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File from the menu bar.  
  Excel : Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Picture from File from the menu bar.  
 Note   Searching by keyword works best if you have assigned keywords to photos in the Photos 
app. To assign keywords in Photos, choose Window ➤ Keyword Manager from the menu bar to 
display the Keywords window. Select the picture to which you want to assign keywords, and then 
click the button in the Keywords window for each keyword you want to assign. You can click the 
Edit Keywords button in the Keywords window to edit the list of keywords, adding ones you need 
and changing any you don’t need. 
 Tip  You can use the Search feature to search for photos. Click in the Search box to activate it, 
then click the Search pop-up menu and click what you want to search: All, Faces, Places, Keyword, 
or Rating. Once you’ve done that, specify your search term or rating in the Search box, and the 
Photo Browser displays matching results. 

118
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  PowerPoint : Choose Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Picture from File from the menu bar.  
  Outlook : Choose Message ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File from the Ribbon.  
  3.  Navigate to the folder that contains the file, and then click the file.  
  4.  If you want to link the picture file to the document rather than insert 
it, select the Link to File check box. When you do this, you can select 
the Save with Document check box to store the latest version of the 
picture file in the document. See the sidebar “Linking a Picture to a 
Document” for advice about linking.  
  5.  Click the Insert button. The app closes the Choose a Picture dialog 
box and inserts the picture in the document.  
 Tip   You can also insert a picture file by dragging it from a Finder window to an Office document 
window. 
 Figure 4-3.   From the Choose a Picture dialog box, you can link the picture to the document 
 

119
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 
LINKING A PICTURE TO A DOCUMENT
 When you add a picture to a document from your Mac’s file system, you can either insert it or link it. Inserting 
the picture adds a copy of the picture to the document. The app saves the picture in the document, so even if 
you move the document, the picture stays in it. 
 If you need to keep the document’s file size down or if you need to be able to update the picture easily, you can 
link the picture instead. Linking makes the app add to the document a link to the picture file. When you open 
the document, the app loads the current version of the picture from the file. But if you move the document to a 
different computer, the link will no longer work because the app will be unable to find the picture file. 
 To solve the problem of broken links, you can link a picture but also save the latest version of it. To do this, 
select the Link to File check box and the Save with Document check box in the Choose a Picture dialog box. 
When you open the document, the app checks to see whether the linked version is available. If so, the app loads 
the linked picture; if not, it displays the version saved in the document. 
 Adding and Formatting a  Shape 
 If a document needs a drawing, you can create it from scratch by using Office’s shapes. 
Office provides a wide variety of shapes, from arrows and basic shapes to stars, banners, 
and callouts. 
 To insert a shape, follow these steps:
  1.  Display the area of the document where you want to add the shape. 
When adding a shape, you don’t need to position the insertion point 
or make a selection.  
  2.  Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Shapes to display the Shapes panel 
(see Figure  4-4 ).  

120
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  3.  Scroll down the Shapes pane as needed to locate the category of 
shapes you want to see: Recently used shapes, Lines, Rectangles, 
Basic shapes, Block arrows, Equation shapes, Flowchart, Stars and 
banners, or Callouts.  
  4.  Click the shape you want. The app changes the pointer to a 
crosshair.  
  5.  With this crosshair, click where you want to place one corner of 
the shape, and then drag to the opposite corner (see Figure  4-5 ). It 
doesn’t matter which corner you place first, because you can drag in 
any direction, but placing the upper-left corner first is usually easiest.  
 Figure 4-4.   Choose the type of shape from the Shapes pane. Hold the pointer over a shape to see a ScreenTip showing 
its description  
 

121
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 When you release the button, the shape appears with selection handles around it so you 
can work with it as described in the following sections. When the shape is selected, the app 
adds the Shape Format tab to the Ribbon, which provides controls for formatting the shape.  
 Applying a Style to a Shape 
 After inserting a shape, you can apply a style to it from the Shape Styles  box or panel in the 
Shape Styles group on the Shape Format tab of the Ribbon. If the style you want appears in 
the Shape Styles box, click it; otherwise, move the pointer over the Shape Styles box so that 
the panel button appears, and then click the button to display the Shape Styles panel (see 
Figure  4-6 ). You can then click the style you want.  
 Figure 4-5.   Click and drag with the crosshair to place and size the shape you’re inserting 
 

122
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 To refine the shape, open the Shape Fill panel, the Shape Outline panel, or the Shape Effects 
panel in the Shape Styles group, and then click the option you want. For example, choose 
Shape Format ➤ Shape Styles ➤ Shape Effects ➤ 3-D Rotation, and then click one of the 
3-D rotation effects (see Figure  4-7 ). 
 Figure 4-6.   To change a shape’s style, open the Shape Styles panel on the Format tab of the Ribbon, and then click the 
style you want  
 

123
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Rotating a Graphical Object 
 After inserting a graphical  object  , you can rotate it as needed. Click to select the object, 
and then drag the round handle that shows a clockwise arrow to the left to rotate 
counterclockwise (see Figure  4-8 ) or to the right to rotate clockwise.  
 Figure 4-7.   Use the Shape Fill panel, the Shape Outline panel, or the Shape Effects panel (shown here) to make the 
shape look the way you want it to look  
 

124
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Positioning a Graphical Object 
 If you don’t get a graphical  object  in precisely the right position when you insert it, you can 
easily move it afterward. 
 The quick way to reposition a graphical object is to click it and then drag it to where you 
want it. This works well most of the time, but for more precision you can also click the object 
to select it and then press an arrow key (such as the Left arrow key or the Up arrow key) to 
nudge it a small distance in the arrow’s direction. 
 When you need to control exactly where the object appears, Cmd-click or right-click the 
object, and then click the Format command on the context menu (for example, the Format 
Shape command for a shape) to display the Format pane for the object. The name of this 
pane shows the type of object—for example, the Format Shape pane in PowerPoint (shown 
on the left in Figure  4-9 ) for a shape or the Format Picture pane in Excel (shown on the right 
in Figure  4-9 ) for a picture.  
 Figure 4-8.   Drag the round rotation handle to the left or right to rotate a graphical object. The tooltip shows the rotation 
in degrees  
 

125
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 You may need to do some exploring in the Format pane to find the Position controls. For 
example, in PowerPoint, you click the Shape Options tab button at the top of the Format Shape 
pane, then click the Size & Properties tab button (the blue square with white arrows pointing 
north, south, east, and west). You then expand the Position head to find the Horizontal position 
box and the Vertical position box. By contrast, in Excel, you click the Size & Properties tab button 
(again, the blue square with white arrows pointing to the four points of the compass), expand 
the Properties head, and then select the “Move and size with cells” option button, the “Move but 
don’t size with cells” option button, or the “Don’t move or size with cells” option button. 
 Figure 4-9.   Use the controls in the Size category of the Format pane for an object to resize and position the object 
precisely. The selection of controls and their layout depends on the object and its properties. The Format Shape pane 
shown on the left here is from PowerPoint. The Format Picture pane shown on the right is from Excel  
 

126
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 In Word, you can also use the Position tab of the Advanced Layout dialog box to position 
an object precisely. Cmd-click or right-click the object, and then click the Size and Position 
item or the More Layout Options item on the context menu (the command varies depending 
on the object). Click the Position tab to display its contents (see Figure  4-10 ). You can then 
choose settings like this:
  Horizontal : In this area, you can select the Alignment option button; 
choose Left, Centered, or Right in the first pop-up menu; and then 
select the appropriate object (such as Column, Margin, or Page) in the 
Relative to pop-up menu. For a layout with facing pages, select the 
Book layout option button, choose Inside or Outside in the first pop-up 
menu, and then choose either Margin or Page in the Of pop-up menu. 
For an absolute position on the page, select the Absolute position 
option button, specify the distance in the text box, and then select the 
appropriate object (such as Page, Left Margin, or Right Margin) in the To 
the right of pop-up menu. For a relative position, select the Relative 
position option button, enter the distance in the text box, and then 
select the appropriate object (such as Page, Left Margin, or Inside 
Margin) in the Relative to pop-up menu.  
  Vertical : In this area, you can select the Alignment option button; choose 
Top, Centered, Bottom, Inside, or Outside in the first pop-up menu; 
and then select the appropriate object (such as Column, Margin, or 
Page) in the Relative to pop-up menu. For an absolute position on the 
page, select the Absolute position option button, specify the distance 
in the text box, and then select the appropriate object (such as Margin, 
Page, Paragraph, or Line) in the Relative to pop-up menu. For a relative 
position, select the Relative position option button, enter the distance in 
the text box, and then select the appropriate object (such as Page, Top 
Margin, or Bottom Margin) in the Relative to pop-up menu.  
  Options : In this area, select the Allow overlap check box if you want to 
allow this object to overlap other objects (or other objects to overlap this 
object). For an object positioned in a table, select the Layout in a table 
cell check box if you want Word to shoehorn the object into the nearest 
cell; if not, clear this check box. Select the Lock anchor check box if 
you want to lock this object’s anchor to the same position on the page 
even when you move the object. Select the “Move object with text” 
check box if you want Word to move the object down the document as 
you enter more text before the object or back up the document as you 
delete text before it. Select the Placeholder check box if you want to 
display a placeholder box instead of the object; as of this writing, this 
setting does not work consistently.  
 Note   An  absolute position is a position that remains the same as the other contents of the page 
change. A  relative position is a position that does change as the page’s other contents change. 

127
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 When you finish making your choices in the Advanced Layout dialog box, click the OK 
button to apply them to the object.  
 Choosing Text Wrapping in Word 
 In Word, you can place a graphical object either inline with the text or in the graphics layers. 
It can be hard to tell just by looking at a graphical object how it’s positioned, but if you find 
you can’t move a graphical object freely, it’s most likely because it’s inline. 
 Tip   Selecting the Lock anchor check box for an object locks only the anchor, not the object itself. 
The advantage to locking the anchor is that you’ll be able to find the anchor in the same position on 
the page even after you move the object to another position. To see object anchors, choose Home 
➤ Paragraph ➤ Show all nonprinting characters from the Ribbon or press Cmd+8. 
 Figure 4-10.   In Word, you can use the controls on the Position tab of the Advanced Layout dialog box to specify exactly 
where you want to position an object  
 

128
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 The quick way to set text wrapping for an object is to use the  Wrap Text panel  in the Arrange 
group on the Format tab of the Ribbon. The Format tab’s name varies depending on the 
object, so you need to choose Picture Format ➤ Arrange ➤ Wrap Text for a picture (or a 
movie, or an audio file), choose Shape Format ➤ Arrange ➤ Wrap Text for a shape, and so 
on. Figure  4-11 shows the Wrap Text panel open.  
 You can make three main choices on the Wrap Text panel:
  Document layer and wrapping : All the items from In Line with Text down 
to In Front of Text work as a single option group: selecting one of them 
deselects whichever other one was previously selected. Click the In Line 
with Text item to put the object in the text layer. Click the Behind Text 
item to put the object into a document layer behind the text layer so you 
can put text in front of it if you choose. Click the In Front of Text item to 
put the object into a document layer in front of the text layer so you can 
use the object to obscure text. Otherwise, choose the type of wrapping 
you want: Square, Tight, Through, or Top and Bottom. Figure  4-12 
shows an example of the Square wrapping style.  
 Figure 4-11.   Use the Wrap Text panel to quickly specify the type of text wrapping to use for the selected object in 
Word. Click the More Layout Options item at the bottom of the Wrap Text menu if you need more flexibility 
 

129
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  Fix in place or allow movement : Click the Move with Text item if you 
want the object to move with the document’s text. Click the Fix Position 
on Page item if you want to keep the object exactly where you’ve 
positioned it. These menu items are another option group, so selecting 
one of them deselects the other.  
  Edit the wrap boundary : Click the Edit Wrap Boundary item to display 
black handles that you can drag to create a custom wrapping boundary 
(see Figure  4-13 ). You can place another handle by clicking and 
dragging the appropriate point on the blue borders.  
 Figure 4-12.   Text wrapped around a picture in Word using the Square wrapping style 
 

130
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 For greater control over the wrapping style and distance, click the More Layout Options item 
on the Wrap Text panel to display the Text Wrapping pane in the Advanced Layout dialog 
box (see Figure  4-14 ). 
 Figure 4-13.   Drag the black handles or the blue borders to create a custom wrapping boundary 
 

131
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Figure 4-14.   Use the options on the Text Wrapping tab of the Advanced Layout dialog box to take precise control over 
the way Word wraps text around an object 
 You can then work like this:
  In the Wrapping Style area, click the wrapping style you want: Square, 
Tight, Through, Top and Bottom, Behind text, In front of text, or In line 
with text.  
  For the Square style, Tight style, or Through style, select the appropriate 
option button in the Wrap text area: Both sides, Left only, Right only, or 
Largest only.  
  For the Square style, Tight style, Through style, or Top and Bottom style, 
use the Top box, Bottom box, Left box, and Right box in the Distance 
from text area to specify how much space to leave between the object 
and the text.  
  Click the OK button to close the Advanced Layout dialog box. Word 
applies the wrapping to the object, and you can see how well it works.  
 Note   You can also Cmd-click or right-click a picture or shape, click the Wrap Text submenu, and 
then click the appropriate command: In Line with Text, Square, Tight, Through, Top and Bottom, 
None, or Edit Wrap Boundary.

CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 Changing the Look of a Picture 
 After you insert a picture, you can use the controls that appear on the Picture Format tab 
of the Ribbon to make the picture look a specific way. You can adjust the picture’s colors, 
apply a picture style to the picture, or crop the picture so that only part of it shows. 
 Adjusting a Picture’s Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast, and Colors 
 To adjust the sharpness, brightness, or  contrast  in a picture, click the picture to select it, 
and then choose Picture Format Adjust ➤ Corrections to open the Corrections panel 
(see Figure  4-15 ). Click the color correction you want.  
 Figure 4-15.   To fix problems with a picture’s sharpness, brightness, or contrast, open the Corrections panel and choose 
the look you want  
 To change the colors in a picture, click it, choose Picture Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Color, and 
then click the effect you want. The Color drop-down panel has different sections for Color 
Saturation, Color Tone, and Recolor (for example, Grayscale or Sepia). 
 To apply an artistic effect such as paint strokes or a light screen to a picture, click the picture, 
choose Picture Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Artistic Effects, and then click the effect you want. 
 

133
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
 To reset a picture to its original look, choose Picture Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Reset Picture ➤ 
Reset Picture. To reset a picture to its original look and size, choose Picture Format ➤ Adjust 
➤ Reset Picture ➤ Reset Picture & Size.  
 Applying a Picture Style 
 To apply a  picture style  to a picture, click the picture, click the Picture Format tab of the 
Ribbon to display it, and then click the picture style you want. If the picture style appears in 
the Quick Styles box in the Picture Styles group, click it there; otherwise, move the pointer 
over the Quick Styles box so that the panel button appears, click the panel button, and then 
click the picture style on the panel (see Figure  4-16 ). 
 Note  The Quick Styles box appears only when the app window is relatively wide. When the window is 
narrower, click the Quick Styles button to display the Quick Styles panel, and then click the style you want. 
 Figure 4-16.   Choose the picture style from the Quick Styles box or panel in the Picture Styles group of the Picture 
Format tab on the Ribbon 
 Cropping a Picture 
 If you need the document to show only part of a picture rather than the whole picture, you 
can  crop  off the parts you don’t want. The Office apps let you crop a picture in several ways, 
but this way is usually the easiest:
  1.   Click the picture to select it. The app adds the Picture Format tab to 
the Ribbon.  
  2.   Click the Picture Format tab if the app has not displayed it.  
  3.   Choose Picture Format ➤ Size ➤ Crop, clicking the main part of the 
Crop button rather than the drop-down button. The app displays 
crop handles on the picture (see Figure  4-17 ). 
 

134
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  4.  Drag the crop handles to make the cropping area contain the part of 
the picture you want to show:
  Shift-drag to crop the image proportionally.  
  Option-drag to crop the image evenly around its center point.  
  Option-Shift-drag to crop the image proportionally around its center point.  
  Cmd-drag to crop the image in increments of Word’s underlying drawing grid 
or Excel’s worksheet cells.  
 Tip   If you make the crop area exactly the size you need, you can click and drag within the 
crop area to make a different part of the picture appear in it. You move the picture, not the crop 
area—much as if you were to reach through a window and move the landscape until the window 
displayed the part you wanted to see. 
 Figure 4-17.   The quick way of cropping is to drag the crop handles until they encompass the part of the picture you 
want to keep  
 

135
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  5.  Click the Crop button again to turn off the Crop tool, or click 
elsewhere in the document to deselect the picture. The app applies 
the cropping to the picture.  
 Saving Space by Compressing Pictures in a Document 
 When you insert pictures in a document (rather than linking them, as discussed earlier in this 
chapter), the app saves a copy of each picture in the document. Saving the  pictures  in the 
document is good in that the pictures travel with the document when you move or share it, 
but it can greatly increase the file size of the document. 
 To keep the document’s file size down, you can compress the pictures and delete the 
cropped areas of them. To do so, follow these steps:  
  1.   Click a picture to make the app add the Format Picture tab to the 
Ribbon.  
  2.   Choose Picture Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Compress to display the 
Compress Pictures dialog box (see Figure  4-18 ).  
  3.  In the Picture Quality pop-up menu, select the picture quality you want:  
  Print (220 ppi) : Compresses the pictures only a bit, maintaining a high-enough 
quality for most purposes, including printing the document.  
 Note   You can also crop a picture to fit into a shape. To do this, choose Picture Format ➤ Size ➤ 
Crop, clicking the Crop pop-up arrow button rather than the top part of the button. On the pop-up 
menu that appears, choose Crop to Shape, and then click the shape you want. 
 Figure 4-18.   Use the Compress Pictures dialog box when you want to reduce the file size of one or more pictures or 
when you want to delete the cropped areas of pictures 
 

136
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  On-screen (150 ppi) : Compresses the pictures a bit further but leaves them 
looking good enough for use on the screen.  
  Email (96 ppi) : Compresses the pictures to the extent that they start to look 
bad but are OK for viewing on the screen at small sizes.  
  Use original quality : Keeps the pictures at their current resolution. Use this 
setting for removing the cropped parts of pictures without changing the 
resolution.  
  4.  Select the “Delete cropped areas of pictures” check box if you want 
to get rid of the areas you’ve cropped off. This is a good security 
measure provided you don’t need to adjust the cropping of any 
pictures in the document to reveal more.  
  5.  In the Apply to area, select the “Selected pictures only” option button 
if you want to affect only the picture (or pictures) you’ve selected. 
Normally, you want to select the “All pictures in this file” option 
button to make the app compress all the pictures in the document.  
  6.  Click the OK button. The app closes the Compress Pictures dialog 
box and changes the quality or cropping as you specified.  
 Inserting SmartArt 
 When you need to create an illustration such as an organization chart, a flow chart, or a Venn 
diagram, use Office’s  SmartArt feature  . Follow these steps:
  1.   Position the insertion point or the selection where you want to insert 
the SmartArt object.  
  2.   Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ SmartArt to display the SmartArt 
panel.  
 Note  You can also insert SmartArt from the menu bar. Choose Insert ➤ SmartArt to display the 
SmartArt submenu, and then click the item type, such as Hierarchy. The app places a default object 
of that type, but you can change the object to a different layout by using the controls in the Layouts 
group on the SmartDesign tab of the Ribbon. 

137
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  3.  Click or highlight the item for the category of SmartArt graphic you 
want to create: List, Process, Cycle, Hierarchy, Relationship, Matrix, 
Pyramid, or Picture. A panel opens showing the available types. 
Figure  4-19 shows the Hierarchy panel, which includes various kinds 
of organization charts.  
  4.   Click the type of graphic you want. The app inserts in the document, 
displays the Text pane (see Figure  4-20 ), and adds the SmartArt 
Design tab and the Format tab to the Ribbon, with the SmartArt 
Design tab selected.  
 Tip   In PowerPoint, if you’re inserting the SmartArt on a slide that has a standard placeholder, you 
can click the Insert SmartArt Graphic icon in the placeholder to display the SmartArt pop-up menu, 
click the appropriate category, and then click the type of SmartArt you want to insert. 
 Figure 4-19.   Open the panel for the category of SmartArt graphics you want and then click the type of graphic 
 

138
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  5.  In the SmartArt Text pane, type the text for each item. As you do, the 
app adds the text to the SmartArt graphic (see Figure  4-21 ). 
 Note  If the app doesn’t display the SmartArt Text panes, choose SmartArt Design ➤ Create 
Graphic ➤ Text Pane from the Ribbon to display the SmartArt Text pane. You can also click the 
SmartArt Text Pane button (the button at the upper-left corner of the SmartArt graphic, showing an 
arrow pointing to the left) to display the SmartArt Text pane. When the SmartArt Text pane is open, 
you can click the SmartArt Text pane (which now shows an arrow pointing to the right) to hide the 
SmartArt Text pane when you don’t need it. 
 Figure 4-20.   When you insert a SmartArt graphic, the app displays the SmartArt Text next to it 
 

139
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  6.  Add any other items the SmartArt graphic needs. For example, to 
add titles to the org chart shown, click in each title placeholder and 
then type the title.  
  7.  Resize the SmartArt graphic to suit the document best. For example, 
in a PowerPoint presentation, you may want to make the graphic as 
big as will fit on the slide to enable the audience to read it easily.  
  8.  Use the controls in the Create Graphic group on the SmartArt Design 
tab of the Ribbon to change the SmartArt graphic as needed. For 
example, click a box and choose SmartArt Design ➤ Create Graphic 
➤ Move Up to move it up the graphic or choose SmartArt Design ➤ 
Create Graphic ➤ Move Down to move it down.  
 Figure 4-21.   Add the text to the SmartArt graphic by typing in the Text pane 
 

140
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  9.  If you need to change the layout of the SmartArt graphic, choose 
another layout from the Layouts group on the SmartArt tab of the 
Ribbon.  
  10. 
 Apply a style to the SmartArt graphic by choosing a style from the 
Quick Styles box or the panel in the SmartArt Graphic group on the 
SmartArt Design tab.  
 When you have finished creating the SmartArt graphic, save the document as usual.  
 Arranging Graphical Objects 
 When you have placed multiple graphical objects in the same area of a document, you may 
need to arrange the order in which they appear in the document’s layers to control how they 
appear in relation to each other. For example, you may need to move a particular object to 
the front of the stack of document layers so that it appears on top of the other objects, or 
move another object back so that it appears behind one of its companion objects. 
 In Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, you can rearrange objects by using either the Arrange 
commands or the context menu for the object. The Arrange commands appear on the 
Format tab of the Ribbon when you select an object—for example, on the Shape Format tab 
when you select a shape or the Picture Format tab when you select a picture. 
 Excel and PowerPoint also let you drag the objects into a different order, which can be 
quicker and easier. 
 Arranging Graphical Objects Using the Arrange Commands 
 In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you can arrange objects by using the  Arrange commands  . Click 
an object to display the appropriate Format tab of the Ribbon, such as the Shape Format tab for 
the shapes shown in an Excel worksheet in Figure  4-22 . Go to the Arrange group, and then click 
the appropriate button to change where the object appears in the document’s layers.
  Bring Forward : Click this command to bring the object forward by one 
layer. Give the command again as many times as necessary to bring the 
object up the stack to where you need it.  
  Bring to Front : Click the Bring Forward pop-up button and then click 
Bring to Front to bring the item to the very front of the stack.  
  Send Backward : Click this command to send the object backward by 
one layer. As with the Bring Forward command, you may need to give 
this command multiple times to get the object to where you need it.  
 Tip  In Word, the Arrange commands also appear in the Arrange group on the Layout tab of the Ribbon, 
so you can use either the Layout tab or the Format tab to arrange objects. Because the Arrange group 
on the Format tab is often collapsed to a button, it is usually easier to use the Layout group. 

141
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  Send to Back : Click the Send Backward pop-up button and then click 
Send to Back to send the item right to the back of the stack.  
 Rearranging Graphical Objects by Dragging 
 Excel and PowerPoint enable you to drag objects into the order you want. Follow these 
steps: 
  1.  Click one of the objects whose order you want to change. The 
appropriate Format tab appears on the Ribbon, with its contents 
displayed.  
  2.  In the Arrange group on the Format tab of the Ribbon, click the 
Reorder Objects button. The app displays the objects as a sequence 
of layers (see Figure  4-23 ).  
 Note   If you want to view only the objects that overlap each other, click the pop-up button on the 
Reorder Objects button, and then click Reorder Overlapping Objects. 
 Figure 4-22.   Use the commands in the Arrange group on the Format tab of the Ribbon to move the selected object up 
or down the layers in the document. In this example, you can use the Bring Forward command to bring the square in 
front of the triangle but still keep it behind the circle 
 

142
CHAPTER 4: Using Pictures and Shapes in Your Documents 
  3.  Drag the layers into the order you want.  
  4.  Click the OK button in the lower-right corner of the screen when you 
finish. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to work with graphical objects in the Office apps. You now 
know how to insert your own pictures from the Photos app or from your Mac’s file system, 
how to insert shapes and format them, and how to position graphical objects where you 
want them. You also learned how to control text wrapping in Word; how to recolor, crop, and 
compress pictures; and how to create SmartArt graphics to illustrate your documents. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to customize the Office apps to suit your needs.

 Chapter 5  
 Customizing Office to Suit You  
 Microsoft has put a lot of work into making the Office apps easy to use, but only you know 
exactly how you work and what you need. To make the Office apps suit you better, you can 
customize their user interface a little and their behavior a lot. 
 Earlier versions of Office for Mac, such as Office 2011, enabled you to customize the user 
interface extensively. Office 2016 lets you customize the status bar in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, but it removes the capability to customize the menu bar and the Ribbon (not 
to mention the toolbars, which are no longer in the interface). However, you can still create 
custom keyboard shortcuts so that you can give commands without moving your fingers 
from the keyboard. 
 Beyond these direct customizations to the user interface, each app has hundreds of settings 
you can use to change how the apps work. In the second half of this chapter, you’ll look at 
two key areas of options common to the apps: the General preferences, which control vital 
aspects of the apps’ looks and behavior, and the Save preferences, which control the default 
formats that the apps use to store your documents. 
 Customizing the Status Bar 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint enable you to customize the status bar at the bottom of the 
window by choosing which of a preset selection of controls to display on it. Ctrl-click or 
right-click the status bar to display the Customize Status Bar context menu, and then click 
an item to either place a check mark next to it (making it appear on the status bar) or to 
remove the existing check mark. 
 The following sections explain the items you can display on the status bar. 
 Note   Some items appear on the status bar only when they are available, such as when a 
particular feature is active. 

144
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You

CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 Creating Custom Keyboard Shortcuts 
 The Ribbon and the menus on the menu bar can be great for giving commands with 
the pointing device, but if you prefer to keep your hands on the keyboard, you can give 
commands by pressing keyboard shortcuts instead. Each of the apps comes with many 
keyboard shortcuts built in, but you can also create custom keyboard shortcuts of your own. 
 Word has a custom tool that enables you to create exactly the keyboard shortcuts you need. 
For Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, you can use OS X’s Shortcuts feature, which lets you 
create keyboard shortcuts for existing menu items. 
 Creating Custom Keyboard Shortcuts in Word 
 To create a custom keyboard  shortcut  in Word, follow these steps:
  1.   Choose Tools ➤ Customize Keyboard from the menu bar to display 
the Customize Keyboard dialog box. Figure  5-4 shows the Customize 
Keyboard dialog box with settings chosen.  
 Note  Keyboard shortcuts can save you time and effort, so it’s well worth learning the ones 
you’ll find most useful. The easiest way to learn the keyboard shortcuts for the most widely used 
commands is to look at the shortcuts listed on the Office apps’ menus. For example, the File menu 
shows you shortcuts such as Cmd+O for the File ➤ Open command, Cmd+W for the File ➤ Close 
command, and Cmd+P for the File ➤ Print command. You can also find impressively long lists of 
keyboard shortcuts in the Help files (search for  keyboard shortcuts ). 

151
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  2.  At the bottom of the Customize Keyboard dialog box, make sure the 
Save changes in pop-up menu is showing  Normal.dotm (see the 
nearby Note). Choose another template or document only if you want 
to save the keyboard shortcuts in that template or document rather 
than have them available for general use.  
 Note   Normal.dotm , usually called “the Normal template,” is a template that Word opens 
automatically each time you launch the app and keeps open until you quit the app. The Normal 
template contains settings for blank documents and also Word-wide settings, such as macros and 
keyboard shortcuts. By saving your keyboard shortcuts in the Normal template, you make them 
available to all documents and templates except those containing their own keyboard shortcuts 
(which override those in the Normal template). Any keyboard shortcuts you save in a template are 
available when that template itself is active or when a document attached to the template is active. 
Any keyboard shortcuts you save in a document are available only when that document is active. 
 Figure 5-4.   In Word, use the Customize Keyboard to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for the commands you need to 
give most often

CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  3.  In the Categories list box, click the category of command for which 
you want to create a keyboard shortcut.
  The beginning of the list shows categories for the main menus that appear on 
the menu bar all the time: the File menu, the Edit menu, the View menu, and 
so on. 
  You’ll also find a category for each menu or Ribbon tab that becomes 
available only when you work with particular objects. For example, the 
Drawing category gives you access to commands for manipulating drawing.  
  If you can’t find the command you want, either click the Search box and start 
typing a keyword, or click the All Commands category to see the full list of 
Word commands. There are more than 1,000 in All Commands, so working 
with this list is slow going.  
  There are also categories for Macros, Fonts, AutoText, Styles, and Common 
Symbols. For example, click Styles to display the list of styles so that you can 
assign a keyboard shortcut to one.  
  4.  In the Commands list box, click the command. Word displays 
information about the command:
  Current keys : The Current keys list box shows any keyboard shortcuts 
currently assigned to the command (some commands have several shortcuts). 
If this command has any shortcuts, check that you know them and decide 
whether you need to create another.  
  Description : This area shows the description of the command. Read it to 
make sure you’ve picked the command you intended. Some command names 
are clear, but others can be confusing.  
  5.  Click in the “Press new shortcut key” text box.  
  6.  Press the keyboard shortcut you want to assign:
  You can create keyboard shortcuts that start with the Cmd and Ctrl keys: 
Cmd, Cmd+Option, Cmd+Ctrl, Cmd+Option+Shift, Cmd+Option+Ctrl, 
Cmd+Option+Ctrl+Shift, Cmd+Ctrl+Shift, Ctrl, Ctrl+Option, Ctrl+Shift, 
Ctrl+Option+Shift are all possible.  
  You can use pretty much any key on the keyboard—letters, numbers, function 
keys, and so on.  
  A normal shortcut consists of a modifier or modifiers plus one key, such 
as Cmd+Option+T. But you can also create modifiers that use two keys in 
sequence—for example, Cmd+Option+T, S—by pressing the extra key after 
the key combination. This lets you create many more keyboard shortcuts and 
is good for related commands—for example, using the Cmd+Option+S, 1 
keyboard shortcut for one style, the Cmd+Option+S, 2 keyboard shortcut for 
another, and the Cmd+Option+S, 3 keyboard shortcut for a third.  

153
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  7.  Check the Currently assigned to readout to see whether the 
keyboard shortcut is currently used. If so, press another keyboard 
shortcut if you don’t want to overwrite it.  
  8.  Click the Assign button. Word assigns the keyboard shortcut to the 
command.  
  9.  When you’ve finished assigning keyboard shortcuts, click the Close 
button to close the Customize Keyboard dialog box.  
 Creating Keyboard Shortcuts for  Excel, PowerPoint, and 
Outlook  
 For Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, you can create keyboard shortcuts for menu 
commands by using the OS X Shortcuts feature. Follow these steps:
  1.  Ctrl-click or right-click the System Preferences icon on the Dock to 
display the context menu, and then click Keyboard to display the 
Keyboard preferences pane in System Preferences.  
  2.  Click the Shortcuts tab button to display the Shortcuts pane.  
  3.  In the left pane, click the App Shortcuts item. The current list of 
shortcuts set for apps appears in the right pane (see Figure  5-5 ). 
 Caution   To save your keyboard customizations, you need to save the changes you’ve made to 
the Normal template (or to the template or document you’ve customized). The best way to do this 
is to Shift-click the File menu and then click Save All. If Word displays a dialog box asking whether 
you want to save changes that affect the global template,  Normal.dotm , click the Save button; 
similarly, if Word prompts you to save changes to the template, click the Save button. While it’s 
possible to leave your changes unsaved until you quit Word, it’s not usually a good idea, because 
you will lose the changes if Word crashes. 
 Note   If the System Preferences icon doesn’t appear on the Dock, choose Apple ➤ System 
Preferences from the menu bar to open the System Preferences window. Then click the Keyboard 
icon to display the Keyboard pane. 

154
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  4.  Click the Add (+) button to start creating a new shortcut. The Add 
dialog box opens (see Figure  5-6 ). 
  5.  Open the Application pop-up menu and click the app’s name, such 
as Microsoft Excel.  
 Figure 5-5.   In the Keyboard pane in System Preferences, click the Shortcuts button to display the Shortcuts pane, and 
then click App Shortcuts in the left pane 
 Figure 5-6.   In the Add dialog box, choose the app, type the command’s name, and press the keyboard shortcut 
 
 

155
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  6.  Click the Menu Title box and then type the command’s name as it 
appears on the menu. You don’t need to type the menu name.  
  7.  Click the Keyboard Shortcut box and press the keys for the keyboard 
shortcut you want to assign.  
  8.  Click the Add button to close the Add dialog box and add the 
shortcut.  
 Choosing Essential Preferences in Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint 
 Each of the Office apps includes several hundred preferences that you can set to make the 
app behave the way you prefer. That’s many more than I can cover in detail here. So, this 
section concentrates on those settings that are common to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 
and make a big difference in the way that the apps behave. 
 Opening the Preferences Window 
 To work through this section, open the app’s Preferences  window  by choosing Word ➤ 
Preferences, Excel ➤ Preferences, PowerPoint ➤ Preferences, or Outlook ➤ Preferences. 
 Figure  5-7 shows the Preferences window for Word. Each app not only has different 
preferences but also divides them up differently among the panes in the Preferences 
window.  
 Note  You’ll find information on important preferences peculiar to individual apps in the app-
specific chapters later in the book. 
 Tip  You can also press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key) to display the Preferences window. This 
keyboard shortcut works in most Mac apps. 
 Note   You can leave Outlook’s Preferences window open as you work, which can be handy for 
seeing the effect of settings you change. By contrast, in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you must 
close the Preferences window before you can continue working in the app. 

156
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 In Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you can navigate the Preferences window in these ways:
  Display a category of preferences : Click the category you want to 
display—for example, the General category. The app displays the 
corresponding preferences pane.  
  Return to the main preferences screen : Click the Show All button on the 
toolbar. Alternatively, click the Back button on the toolbar.  
  Search for a preference : Click in the Search box, and then type the 
term to search for. Click the search result you want to see; alternatively, 
press the up arrow or the down arrow to highlight the search result 
that matches, and then press the Return key. The Preferences window 
displays the pane that contains the match.  
  Retrace your path through the preferences panes : Click the Back button 
on the toolbar to display the previous pane. Keep clicking the Back 
button as many times as needed to go back as far as you need.  
  Go forward again through the preferences panes : After going back, you 
can click the Forward button on the toolbar to display the next pane. 
Again, keep clicking to keep going forward.  
 The Outlook Preferences window doesn’t have the Search box or the Forward button and 
Back button, so you click the icon for the Preferences pane you want and then simply click 
the Show All button on the toolbar to return to the main Preferences screen.  
 Figure 5-7.   Each Preferences window divides the preferences into different categories, such as the Authoring and 
Proofing Tools category, the Output and Sharing category, and the Personal Settings category in the Word Preferences 
window 
 

157
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 Setting Your User Name, Initials, and Address 
 If you installed Office yourself, you probably set your user name and initials during setup. 
If not, you may find that the Office apps think you’re called Authorized User or some other 
generic name. Either way, you may need to add or change your address information. 
 To change your  name, initials, or address  information, use Word. In the Word Preferences 
window, click the User Information icon in the Personal Settings area to display the User 
Information pane (see Figure  5-8 ). You can then fill in as many fields as you want: your 
names and initials; your company name, the city, state, and ZIP code; and the phone 
number and e-mail address you want to have associated with the Office apps.  
 Note   Select the “Always use this name regardless of how I’m signed in to Office” check box if you 
want Office to use the name entered in the Name box no matter which of your Office accounts you’re 
using. For example, your personal Office 365 account may use a different spelling of your name than 
your corporate account. By selecting this check box, you can apply a standard version of your name. 
 Figure 5-8.   Word is the best app for entering your details because it provides fields for the address, phone number, and 
e-mail address as well as your name and initials  
 

158
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 Word makes the information you enter available to Excel and PowerPoint, so you don’t need 
to enter your name and initials separately in them. You’ll find your user name in the General 
preferences pane in Excel, and you’ll find your name and initials in the User Information 
preferences pane in PowerPoint.  
 Choosing Whether to Display the Gallery Dialog Box When the 
App Opens 
 By default, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint display the  Gallery dialog box  automatically when you 
launch the app. The Gallery dialog box can be helpful when you need to create a new document 
or open a recent document (as discussed in Chapter   2 ), but you may prefer to have the app 
open without displaying the extra window. To control whether the Gallery dialog box opens, 
display the General preferences pane for the app and select or clear the appropriate check box:
  Word : Select or clear the Show Word Document Gallery when opening 
Word check box.  
  Excel : Select or clear the Open Workbook Gallery when opening Excel 
check box.  
  PowerPoint : Select or clear the “Show the Start screen when this 
application starts” check box.  
 Choosing Whether to Receive Feedback with Sound 
 To grab your attention when there’s something you need to know, Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint can all provide  feedback  using sound. For example, the app plays a sound to let 
you know it has finished saving or printing a document. Whether this is helpful depends on 
how you work and where, such as whether you’re in a cubicle or your own office. 
 To control whether these sounds play, display the General pane and then select or clear the 
appropriate check box:
  Word : Select or clear the “Play sounds for events such as opening, 
saving, or printing” check box.  
  Excel : Select or clear the Play Office sounds check box.  
  PowerPoint : Select or clear the Provide feedback with sound check box.  
 Choosing Whether to Confirm Launching Other Apps 
 Mostly, when you’re working in an  app , you create or open files created in that app or ones 
compatible with it. For example, when you’re working in Excel, you normally create or open 
workbook files or open text files that Excel can display. 
 But sometimes you may take an action that creates or opens a type of file that requires a 
different app. When you do this, the app can warn you that it needs to use a different app. 
You can then click the Open button, such as an Open in Word button for a Word document, 
or click the Cancel button to cancel the action. 

159
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 This prompting is usually helpful. To turn it on in Word, select the “Confirm before opening 
different applications” check box in the General preferences pane. In Excel, select the 
“Confirm before opening other applications” check box in the General preferences pane. As 
of this writing, PowerPoint doesn’t offer this setting.  
 Choosing the Default Format for Saving Documents 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint can each save documents in several different formats. Each 
application comes set to save documents in its preferred format. For example, Word uses 
the latest Word Document  format  by default. But to make sure other people can open the 
documents you share with them, you may need to change the format. For example, you may 
need to use a Word document format that colleagues using an older version of Office (such as 
Office 2004 for Mac or Office 2003 for Windows) or a different word processing app can open. 
 When saving a document for the first time, you can save it in any of the formats the 
application supports. You can also use the File ➤ Save As command to save a new copy of 
an existing document in a different format. But it’s a good idea to set the default format for 
the documents you create in the application. 
 Setting the Default Document Format in Word 
 To set the default format  Word uses to save documents, display the Save preferences pane 
in the Word Preferences window (see Figure  5-9 ), open the Save Word files as pop-up menu, 
and click the format you want.  
 Note  Word and Excel enable you to set the default file format, but PowerPoint does not. 
 Figure 5-9.   In the Save preferences pane for Word, you can set the default format for saving files, set up AutoRecover 
backups, and choose other save-related options  
 

160
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 These are the formats you’re most likely to need for Word:
  Word Document : Use this format if your colleagues have a recent 
version of Office, such as Office 2016 or any of the Office 365 
subscription packages. Anyone with Office 2004 for Mac or Office 2003 
for Windows will need to install converter filters to be able to open the 
documents.  
  Word 97–2004 Document : Use this format if your colleagues have Office 
2004 for Mac, Office 2003 for Windows, or an earlier version of Office. 
You can also use this format for greater compatibility with other word 
processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer or Google Docs.  
  Rich Text Format : Use this format if you’re creating text-based 
documents that you need to ensure are fully readable in almost any 
word processor.  
 Setting the Default Workbook Format in Excel 
 To set the default format that  Excel  uses to save workbooks, display the Compatibility 
preferences pane in the Excel Preferences window, open the Save files in this format pop-up 
menu, and click the format you need. 
 These are the formats you’re most likely to need for Excel:
  Excel Workbook : Use this format if your colleagues have a recent version 
of Office, such as Office 2016 or any of the Office 365 subscription 
packages. Anyone with Office 2004 for Mac or Office 2003 for Windows 
will need to install converter filters to be able to open the workbooks.  
  Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook : Use this format if you need to include 
macros in your workbooks to perform custom actions. Again, your 
colleagues will need to have a recent version of Office, or either Office 
2004 or Office 2003 with filters installed, to open these workbooks.  
 Tip   While you’re on the Save preferences pane in Word, you may want to set a couple of other 
preferences. First, select the “Always create backup copy” check box if you want to keep a 
quick backup each time you save a document after the first. When you do this, Word renames 
the previously saved version of the document, making it the backup file, and saves the current 
document under the document’s name. You may also want to select the “Save preview picture of 
new documents” check box to create a thumbnail preview of each document, which can help you to 
identify it visually. 
 Note   Office 2008 for Mac doesn’t include VBA. So although you can include macros in an Excel 
Macro-Enabled Workbook file, Excel 2008 users won’t be able to run them. 

161
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
  Excel Binary Workbook : Use this format if you create large and complex 
workbooks and need to improve performance. Once more, your 
colleagues will need to have a recent version of Office, or either Office 
2004 or Office 2003 with filters, installed to work with these workbooks.  
  Excel 97–2004 Workbook : Use this format if your colleagues have 
Office 2004 for Mac, Office 2003 for Windows, or an earlier version of 
Office. You can also use this format for greater compatibility with other 
spreadsheet apps, such as OpenOffice.org Calc or Google Docs.  
 Setting AutoRecover to Keep Backups of Your Documents 
for Safety 
 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint also let you choose whether to keep  AutoRecover files  . 
AutoRecover is a safety net that automatically saves a copy of each open document every 
few minutes in case the app closes unexpectedly and loses the changes you’ve made. After 
the app restarts automatically or you restart it manually, the app opens the latest 
AutoRecover files for you so that you can choose which versions to keep. If you save your 
documents and then exit the app, it gets rid of the saved AutoRecover files. 
 To choose AutoRecover settings, follow these steps:
  1.   Display the Save preferences pane.  
  2.   Select or clear the Save AutoRecover info check box (in Word and 
PowerPoint) or the Save AutoRecover information in every  NN 
minutes check box (in Excel).  
  3.   If you select the check box, enter the number of minutes in the text 
box. You can set any interval from 1 minute to 120 minutes. An 
interval of around 3 minutes usually works well, because it saves 
information frequently enough to avoid disasters but doesn’t overly 
interrupt your work by saving constantly.  
 Caution   Never rely on AutoRecover as protection against disasters. When AutoRecover works, it 
can save your bacon, but sometimes it doesn’t save everything. So, you should always save your 
documents frequently while working on them and use AutoRecover only if disaster strikes. You can 
save a document at any time by pressing Cmd+S, clicking the Save button on the title bar of the 
app, or choosing File ➤ Save from the menu bar. 
 Note   You can use different AutoRecover settings in each app if you want. For example, you may 
want AutoRecover to save your Word documents every 2 minutes, your Excel workbooks every 15 
minutes, and your PowerPoint presentations not at all. 

162
CHAPTER 5: Customizing Office to Suit You
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned essential techniques for making the Office apps work your 
way. You now know how to customize the status bar in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint so that 
it displays the tools and information you need, and you’ve learned how to create custom 
keyboard shortcuts to speed up your work. 
 You also learned how to open the Preferences window and access the hundreds of settings 
you can choose in each app. And you went through a handful of essential settings, including 
those for setting your name, initials, and address; for choosing the default formats for saving 
Word documents and Excel workbooks; and for setting AutoRecover to create automatic 
backups of your open documents. 
 This is the end of the first part of the book. You’re now familiar with the most important tools 
and techniques that the apps share, so it’s time to dig into using the individual apps. We’ll 
start with Microsoft Word.  

163
 
 Part 2 
 Creating Documents with 
Microsoft Word 
 In this part of the book, you’ll learn how to harness the power of Microsoft Word to 
create whichever kinds of documents you need—anything from a short memo or letter to a 
full-scale book that makes this tome look puny. 
 In Chapter   6 , you’ll first learn ways to enter text quickly in Word documents. Next up is 
selecting text in advanced ways with the pointing device and the keyboard, moving around 
your documents swiftly and smoothly, and pointing Word at the folder that contains your 
custom templates. You’ll also learn to create backup documents automatically, and to make 
the most of Word’s various views of a document. 
 In Chapter   7 , I show you the right way to format a document quickly and consistently by 
using styles rather than by applying direct formatting bit by bit. In this chapter, you’ll also 
learn how to get around your documents by using the Sidebar and the Find feature, and how 
to harness the power of the Replace feature. 
 In Chapter   8 , you’ll first study Word’s extra features for creating complex tables—for 
example, creating a table from existing text. You’ll then learn how to break a document 
into multiple sections; how to add headers, footers, and page numbers; and how to create 
newspaper-style columns of text. You’ll also learn to use bookmarks and cross-references, 
develop your documents using Word’s powerful Outline view, and add footnotes and 
endnotes to your documents. 
 In Chapter   9 , you’ll use Word’s Mail Merge feature to create business documents swiftly and 
efficiently. You’ll learn to set up mail merge documents (such as letters or labels), connect 
them to data sources, and save or print the results. 

164
PART 2: Creating Documents with Microsoft Word
 In Chapter   10   , you’ll use Word’s features for working with your colleagues on documents. 
You’ll learn how to edit a document either simultaneously or separately, how to use the Track 
Changes feature to mark revisions, and how to integrate changes into a document. You’ll 
also see how to add comments to a document and compare two document versions that 
contain untracked changes. 
 In Chapter   11   , you’ll put your documents to use. First, you’ll learn to print an entire 
document or just parts of it, print a document with or without markup, and even print 
markup without the document. You’ll also learn how to remove sensitive information from 
documents, create a document you can open with earlier versions of Word, and create PDF 
files from documents.

 Chapter 6  
 Entering Text and Using Views 
 In this chapter, I’ll show you how to enter text quickly in Word documents by using the 
extra features that Word provides, which go beyond those in the other apps. You’ll see how 
to select text in advanced ways with the pointing device and the keyboard, how to move 
around your documents using keyboard shortcuts and the Go To feature, and how to tell 
Word where to find your custom templates. 
 You’ll also learn how to make Word automatically create backup documents so that you can 
recover from disastrous edits or other mishaps and how to exploit the possibilities offered by 
Word’s various views of a document. 
 Entering Text in Your Word Documents 
 In Word, you can enter  text  in your documents by typing it in as usual, but you can often 
save time by entering text in other ways:
  Paste : If you have the text in another document or e-mail, you can copy 
it and then paste it into the Word document.  
  Scan : If you have the text in a hard-copy document, you can scan it with 
a scanner and use an optical character recognition (OCR) app such as 
Prizmo 3 ($49.99 from the App Store) or PDFpen 6 ($79.99 from the App 
Store) to get the text from the scanned image. You can export or copy 
the text to Word.  
 Tip  If you don’t mind waiting for OCR on your documents, you can upload them as images to the 
Evernote note-syncing service. Evernote automatically scans each image for text and adds it to your 
note. At busy times, Evernote may take a day or two to get around to scanning your images, but if 
you’re not in a hurry, this can be a great solution for occasional OCR. 

166
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
  Inserting a file : If you have the text in a Word document or a text file, you 
can insert it quickly in a Word document. See the “Inserting Text from 
One Document to Another” section for details.  
  Using AutoCorrect : After creating AutoCorrect entries as described in 
the “Saving Time and Effort with AutoCorrect” section in Chapter   3 , you 
can insert their contents by just typing their names. AutoCorrect is great 
for entering sections of boilerplate text with just a few keystrokes.  
  Using AutoText : As well as AutoCorrect, Word provides AutoText, which 
is another easy way of inserting preexisting blocks of text. See the 
“Inserting Prebuilt Blocks of Text with AutoText” section for details.  
 Inserting Text from One Document to Another 
 When you need to put all the text from one document into another document, you can use 
the Insert File feature instead of opening the document, copying the content, closing the 
document, and then pasting the content. You can also use this command to insert a defined 
part of a file, such as the section marked by a bookmark. 
 To use the  Insert File feature  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Place the insertion point where you want to insert the text.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Text ➤ Object ➤ Text from File from the Ribbon or 
Insert ➤ File from the menu bar to display the Insert File dialog box 
(see Figure  6-1 ).  

167
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 3. 
 Navigate to the document you want to insert, and then click it.  
 4. 
 Make sure the Link to File check box is cleared. (If this check box is 
selected, Word creates a link to the file’s data rather than inserting 
the data itself, which is what you usually want.)  
 5. 
 Click the Insert button. Word inserts the document’s text.  
 Note   You can also use the Insert File dialog box to insert the contents of a range of cells in an 
Excel worksheet into a Word document. In the Enable pop-up menu, choose All Office Documents. 
Then select the workbook, type the appropriate range in the Range/Bookmark text box, and click 
the Insert button. 
 Figure 6-1.   Use the Insert File dialog box to quickly insert either the entire contents of a document or the contents 
marked by a bookmark or range in it  
 

168
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Inserting Prebuilt Blocks of Text with AutoText 
 If some or many of your documents will include some of the same sections of text, you may be 
able to save time by  using AutoText  . This feature gives you an easy way to store prebuilt sections 
of text so that you can reuse them in your documents. AutoText is like AutoCorrect in a way, but 
it doesn’t replace text automatically—instead, you choose when to insert each AutoText entry, 
although you can have Word prompt you with available AutoText entries if you like. 
 An AutoText entry consists of as much text as needed, plus any other objects, such as 
graphics or tables. Word includes some built-in AutoText entries for standard text items such 
as “Dear Sir or Madam” and the “Page X of Y” numbering used for headers and footers. 
 To use AutoText, you first create one or more AutoText entries that contain the text and 
elements you want. You can then insert these entries as needed in your documents. 
 To create a new AutoText entry, follow these steps:
 1. 
 In your document, enter the material that you want to include in the 
AutoText entry:
  Type in the text, and apply any formatting it needs.  
  Add other elements such as graphics or tables.  
 2. 
 Select the material.  
 3. 
 Choose Insert ➤ AutoText ➤ New from the menu bar to open the 
Create New AutoText dialog box (see Figure  6-2 ).  
 Tip  Unless you’re highly organized, you may find it easier to create AutoText entries when you 
realize that part of a document you’ve created would be useful again in the future. If you need to 
modify the material before creating an AutoText entry from it, copy that part of the document, paste 
it into a new document, and then change it—for example, remove specific information that you will 
fill in each time you reuse it. When the material is ready, select it, and then create an AutoText entry. 
 Tip   Instead of inserting the entire contents of a document, you can insert the contents of a 
single bookmark, an electronic marker that you set. To use this feature, set up a document with 
bookmarks containing the chunks of text you want to use separately, and give the bookmarks 
names you can remember. Then, in the Insert File dialog box, select the document, and then click in 
the Range/Bookmark box and type the bookmark’s name. Once you’ve made your choice, click the 
Insert button in the Insert File dialog box as usual. 

169
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 4. 
 In the Name text box, type the name you want to give the 
AutoText entry.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button. Word closes the Create New AutoText Entry 
dialog box and adds the AutoText entry to the list Word maintains.  
 After creating an AutoText entry, you can insert it quickly at the position of the insertion point 
by typing the first four characters of the name or enough to identify it uniquely among your 
AutoText entries. When Word displays a ScreenTip containing the name of the AutoText 
entry (see Figure  6-3 ), press Return to insert it.  
 Typing is usually the easiest way to insert your AutoText entries, but you can also browse 
them by using the AutoText submenu on the Insert menu and the AutoText tab of the 
AutoCorrect dialog box. 
 To insert a built-in AutoText entry from the menu bar, choose Insert ➤ AutoText from the 
menu bar and then click the appropriate entry on the AutoText submenu. 
 Tip   As you’ll see in a moment, the easiest way to insert an AutoText entry is by typing enough of 
its name to identify it. It is best to give your AutoText entries distinctive names that describe their 
contents so that you can type the names without having to look up the entries.

CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 To insert either a built-in AutoText entry or an entry you’ve created, use the AutoText tab of 
the AutoCorrect pane of Word’s Preferences dialog box. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ AutoText ➤ AutoText from the menu bar to display 
the AutoCorrect preferences pane with the AutoText tab at the front 
(see Figure  6-4 ).  
 2. 
 You can then scroll down the list of entries and click the entry you 
want to see in the Preview box.  
 3. 
 When you’ve selected the entry you want, click the Insert button.  
 Figure 6-4.   From the AutoText tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane in Word’s Preferences dialog box, you can insert 
AutoText entries, delete existing entries, or create new entries 
 

171
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 From the AutoText tab of the AutoCorrect preferences pane, you can also delete an AutoText 
entry you no longer need: click the entry in the list, and then click the Delete button. You 
can also create a new AutoText entry from text and objects you’ve already selected in your 
document by typing a name and clicking the Add button, but usually it’s easier to use the 
Create New AutoText dialog box, as described earlier in this section.  
 Selecting Text in Word-Specific Ways 
 Apart from the ways of  selecting text  that you learned in Chapter   3 , you can use several 
shortcuts for selecting text in Word. You can use the pointing device, the keyboard, or both. 
 Selecting Text with the Pointing Device 
 When you’re using the  pointing device  to move around a document, you can quickly select 
text by moving the pointer to the left of the text area so that the pointer changes to an arrow 
pointing up and to the right. You can then use this selection pointer like this:
  Select a line : Click next to the line you want to select.  
  Select multiple lines : Click to place the insertion point anywhere in the 
line at which you want to begin the selection. Then Shift-click in the left 
margin at the line on which you want to end the selection.  
  Select a paragraph : Double-click next to the paragraph you want to 
select.  
  Select the whole document : Triple-click or Cmd-click. (Again, you click 
to the left of the text area, not in the text.)  
  Select a column of text : Sometimes it’s useful to select not whole lines 
but part of several lines—for example, to select the first few blank 
characters at the beginning of several lines of text you’ve pasted so that 
you can delete them all at once. You can do this by Option-dragging 
with the pointing device (see Figure  6-5 ). When you’ve selected the text 
you want, you can format it or delete it.  
 Figure 6-5.   Option-drag when you need to select part of the text on each of several lines—for example, to delete 
unwanted blank space

CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Selecting Text with the Extend Selection Feature 
 You can select text in Word using the standard keyboard selection methods discussed in 
Chapter   4  , but Word also provides an odd feature called  Extend Selection  . You put Word 
into Extend mode by pressing F8, which makes the Extend Selection readout appear on the 
status bar but otherwise has no visible effect. You can then continue selecting like this:
  Keep pressing F8. Press once more to select the current word. Press twice 
more to select the current sentence. Press three more times to select the 
current paragraph. Press four more times to select the whole document.  
  Press the character to which you want to extend the selection. For 
example, press M to extend the selection to the next letter m, press . 
(the period key) to extend the selection to the end of the sentence, or 
press Return to extend the selection to the end of the paragraph. You 
can then press another key to extend the selection further, as needed.  
  Press the right arrow key to extend the selection by a single character, 
or press the left arrow key to reduce the selection by a single character. 
Press the down arrow key to extend the selection by a line, or press the 
up arrow key to reduce the selection by a line.  
  With the pointing device, click at the point to which you want to extend 
the selection.  
  Press Esc when you’ve finished selecting and want to work with the 
selection.  
 Note   Depending on how your Mac is configured, you may need to press Fn+F8 rather than F8 on 
its own to give the Extend Selection command. The setting that controls this is the “Use all F1, F2, etc. 
keys as standard function keys” check box on the Keyboard tab in Keyboard preferences in System 
Preferences. When this check box is cleared, as it is by default on most MacBook models, the function 
keys deliver the special functions printed on them; for example, F1 dims the display and F10 mutes 
sound. To get the standard function-key functions, you press Fn and the appropriate function key. 
 Tip   You can also extend the selection by opening the Find and Replace dialog box and searching 
for particular text. Make sure the “Highlight all items found in” check box is cleared. 
 Note   The Extend Selection feature can be useful, but don’t worry if you decide it’s too bizarre 
to use. You should still know about Extend Selection because if Word starts behaving oddly and 
selecting sections of text you’re not trying to select, you may have switched on Extend mode by 
accident. Look at the status bar to see if the Extend Selection readout appears. If so, press Esc to 
switch Extend mode off again. 

173
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Selecting Multiple Items at Once 
 Sometimes in Word it’s useful to select  multiple items  at the same time. To do so, select the 
first item using the keyboard, the pointing device, or both. Then hold down Cmd and select 
the other items with the pointing device. After you’ve selected multiple objects, you can 
apply most types of formatting to them all at the same time.  
 Moving with Keyboard Shortcuts 
 As well as the standard  keyboard shortcuts  discussed in Chapter   3 , you can move around a 
document by using the keyboard shortcuts listed in Table  6-1 .  
 To move about a document with the pointing device, you can click the scroll arrows or drag 
the scroll box as usual.  
 Moving with the Go To Feature 
 Another way of moving about your documents is by using the Go To feature, which Word 
implements as a tab in the Find and Replace dialog box. The  Go To feature  enables you to 
move among various types of elements in your documents, such as from heading to heading 
or from one table to the previous table. 
 You can display the Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box (see Figure  6-6 ) in any of 
these ways:
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Option+G.  
  Pointing device : Click the Page readout (which shows the page position 
in the “Page 1 of 256” format) on the status bar.  
 Table 6-1.   Keyboard Shortcuts for Moving the Insertion Point in Word 
 Press These Keys 
 To Move the Insertion Point Like This 
 Cmd+Up arrow  or Option+Up arrow 
 If the insertion point is in a paragraph, to the start 
of that paragraph. If the insertion point is at the 
start of a paragraph, to the start of the previous 
paragraph. 
 Cmd+Down arrow  or Option+Down arrow 
 To the start of the next paragraph. 
 Cmd+Home  or Cmd+Fn+Left arrow 
 To the start of the document. 
 Cmd+End  or Cmd+Fn+Right arrow 
 To the end of the document. 
 Cmd+Page Down  or Fn+Down arrow 
 To the next page. 
 Cmd+Page Up  or Fn+Up arrow 
 To the previous page. 

174
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
  Menu bar : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Go To. 
 In the “Go to what” box on the left side of the Go To tab, click the type of object you want to 
browse. Table  6-2 explains these items. Then click the Next button to go to the next instance 
or the Previous button to go to the previous instance. 
 To move in bigger jumps, type + and a number or – and a number in the text box on the right 
side, and then click the Go To button that appears. For example, type +5 and click the Go To 
button to move forward by five of whichever object you’re using, or type –3 and click the Go 
To button to move backward by three of that object. 
 When you reach the object you want to work with, you can click the Close button to close 
the Find and Replace dialog box. Alternatively, you can click in the document, leaving the 
Find and Replace dialog box open so that you can quickly resume browsing by objects. 
 Table 6-2.   Objects You Can Browse by Using the Go to Tab of the Find and Replace Dialog Box 
 Object 
 Explanation 
 Page 
 Browse from page to page in the document. This is the default setting until you 
change objects. 
 Section 
 Browse from one section to the next. See Chapter   8 for information on sections. 
 Line 
 Browse from one line to another. This is useful for very long documents, for 
documents that use line numbers, or both. For example, if you know the line number 
you want to go to, you can enter that number. Or if you want to move forward 1,000 
lines, you can type  +1000 and press Return. 
 Note   You can also display the Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box by clicking other 
items on the status bar, if you have them displayed: the Formatted Page readout (which shows the 
page number, such as “Page 15”), the Section readout (which shows the section number, such as 
“Section 1”), the Vertical Page Position readout (which shows a position such as “At: 6.4"”), the 
Line Number readout (which shows the line number, such as “Line: 63”), or the Column readout 
(which shows the character position, such as “Column: 12”).

 Endnote 
 Browse from one endnote to the next. An endnote is a note that appears at the end of 
a section or document. See Chapter   8 for information on endnotes. 
 Field 
 Browse from one field to the next. See Chapter   8 for details on how to use fields. 
 Table 
 Browse from one table to the next. See Chapter   3 and Chapter   8 for information on 
creating tables. 
 Graphic 
 Browse from one graphic to the next. 
 Equation 
 Browse from one equation to another. You can insert an equation by choosing Insert 
➤ Symbols ➤ Equation from the Ribbon or Insert ➤ Equation from the menu bar. 
 Object 
 Browse from one object to another. Open the Enter object name pop-up menu and 
choose the object type, such as Microsoft Excel Chart, or use the Any Object setting 
to browse all types of objects. 
 Heading 
 Browse from one heading to the next. This works with any paragraph you’ve given a 
Heading style (see Chapter   7 for details). 
 Telling Word Where to Find Your Templates 
 If you have your own custom templates, you may need to tell Word where they’re located, or 
you may need to move them into the   Templates folder  that Word is already using so that you 
can use them from the Word Document Gallery. 
 Note   Word uses two template folders, the  User Templates folder and the  Workgroup 
Templates folder. When you install Office, the installer automatically sets the  User Templates 
folder for you to a folder on your Mac. For a normal installation, the installer does not set the 
 Workgroup Templates folder; in a company network, an administrator may set this folder for 
you. If you share templates with others on your network, you can set the  Workgroup Templates 
folder manually to point to this folder by using the technique described in this section. 
 Table 6-2.  (continued) 

176
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 To set your  Templates folders or to check which folders Word is using for them, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences from the menu bar or press Cmd+, 
(Cmd and the comma key) to display the Word Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the Personal Settings area, click the File Locations icon to display 
the File Locations pane (see Figure  6-7 ). 
 3. 
 In the File types list, click the type of file for which you want to see or 
change the path. For example, click the Workgroup templates item.  
 4. 
 Click the Modify button to display the Open dialog box.  
 5. 
 To choose or change the folder, navigate to the folder you want to 
use, click it, and then click the Open button. Word closes the Open 
dialog box and displays the new path (or as much of it as will fit) in 
the File Locations pane.  
 6. 
 Choose or change any other file paths. For example, you may want 
to change the  User Templates path.  
 7. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Tip  If the folder path is too long to appear fully in the Location column of the File Locations pane, 
click the Modify button to display the Open dialog box. You can then click the pop-up menu at the 
top of the dialog box to see the details of the path to the folder.

 Creating Backup Documents and Recovering 
from Disaster 
 Like the other Office apps, Word includes the AutoRecover feature that automatically saves 
versions of your documents as you work and offers you the chance to recover them when Word 
restarts after closing unexpectedly (see Chapter   5 ). But to keep your documents safe, it’s a 
good idea to also turn on Word’s feature for creating  automatic backups  . When you do so, you 
can also check that a couple of other important options are set correctly. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences from the menu bar or press Cmd+, 
(Cmd and the comma key) to display the Word Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the Output and Sharing area, click the Save icon to display the 
Save preferences pane.  
 3. 
 Select the “Always create backup copy” check box.  
 4. 
 If you want Word to automatically save changes you make to 
the Normal template, such as AutoText entries or new keyboard 
shortcuts you’ve created, make sure the “Prompt to save Normal 
template” check box is cleared. Select this check box if you want 
Word to ask you to decide whether to save changes.  
 5. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Now that you’ve selected the “Always create backup copy” check box, Word keeps one 
backup of each document. Here’s how it does it:
  The first time you save, Word saves the document as normal. There’s no 
backup.  
  Each time you save the document after that, Word changes the name of 
the latest saved version of the document to the backup name and then 
saves the current version under the document name.  
 Word names the backup file  Backup of and the document’s name and keeps it in the same 
folder as the document. So if you create a document named  Merlot Tasting.docx , Word 
names the backup file  Backup of Merlot Tasting.docx . 
 If a document becomes corrupted or if you delete a vital part of it and save the change, you 
can recover your work by opening the backup document.  
 Tip  Save your documents frequently to minimize the number of changes that are in the current 
version of the document but not in the backup version created from the previously saved version.

CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Using Views and Windows to See What You Need 
 To work quickly and comfortably in your documents, you need to understand the five 
different  views that Word provides and know when to use each of them. You may also need 
to open multiple windows on the same document so that you can work in different parts of 
it. Or you may want to split a single document window into two panes so that you can view 
the document differently in each. 
 Picking the Right View for What You’re Doing 
 Each of Word’s views has a distinct purpose, but you can use each view as much or as little 
as you want. Most likely, you will find some views much more useful than others for the 
types of documents you create and the Mac you work on. 
 You can switch from view to view in these ways:
  Status bar : Click the View buttons toward the right end of the status bar 
(see Figure  6-8 ) to switch to Print Layout view, Web Layout view, Outline 
view, or Draft view. You can’t switch to Full Screen view this way.  
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Print Layout, View ➤ Web Layout, View ➤ 
Outline, View ➤ Draft, or View ➤ Enter Full Screen.  
  Ribbon : Choose View ➤ Views ➤ Print Layout, View ➤ Views ➤ Web 
Layout, View ➤ Views ➤ Outline, or View ➤ Views ➤ Draft.  
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Option+P for Print Layout view, Cmd+Option+O 
for Outline view, Cmd+Option+N for Draft view (which used to be called 
Normal view—hence the keystroke), or Cmd+Ctrl+F for Full Screen view. 
Web Layout view doesn’t have a built-in keyboard shortcut, but you can 
create one as described in Chapter   5 . 
 Figure 6-8.   To change views quickly with the pointing device, click the view buttons near the right of the status bar. 
Hold the pointer over a view button to display a tooltip showing its name  
 

179
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Using Print Layout View to See How a Document Will Look When 
Printed 
 For most documents, Word opens at first in  Print Layout view  (see Figure  6-9 ), which shows 
you the document as it will appear on paper. You can see each printable element in the 
document—text, tables, graphics, equations, and so on—in the positions they occupy on 
the page, along with the white space of the page margins. If you have added headers or 
footers to the document, you see them too.  
 Using Full Screen View to See More of a Document 
 Word uses the standard OS X version of Full Screen view, so when you choose View ➤ 
Enter Full Screen or press Cmd+Ctrl+F, your Mac expands the active Word window to fill the 
screen, hiding the OS X menu bar and the Word window’s title bar. Beyond that, the view 
remains the same, so if you’re using Print Layout view when you switch to Full Screen view, 
you’ll see Print Layout view as big as it goes. 
 Figure 6-9.   Print Layout view shows the document with headers and footers, margins, and graphics all in the positions 
they occupy on paper 
 

180
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 When you are ready to leave Full Screen view, you can move the pointer to the upper-left corner 
of the screen, making the Word window’s title bar and the OS X menu bar slide back into view, 
and then either click the green Zoom button on the Word window or choose View ➤ Exit Full 
Screen from the menu bar. Alternatively, press Cmd+Ctrl+F again, or simply press Esc.  
 Using Web Layout View to Get a Preview of Web Pages 
 Web Layout view  shows you how the document will look if you save it as a web page. Word 
hides all the items that don’t appear on web pages—headers and footers, margins, and 
page breaks—and wraps the lines to the width of the window, just as a web browser does 
(see Figure  6-10 ). Word also hides the horizontal scroll bar; you shouldn’t need it because 
the lines are wrapped.  
 Note  In Office 2011 for Mac, Word used a custom full-screen view that removed much of the 
Word interface in order to maximize your reading space. Word 2016 does not have this feature. 
 Figure 6-10.   Web Layout view displays the page as if it were in a web browser, with no headers and footers, margins, 
or page breaks 
 

181
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Developing a Document in Outline View 
 Outline view is a powerful tool for developing the outline and structure of a document.  Outline 
view displays the document as a structure of headings, each of which you can collapse or 
expand as needed (see Figure  6-11 ). See Chapter   8  for instructions on using Outline view.  
 Using Draft View 
 Draft view  , which used to be called Normal view, is great for working with the body text of a 
document. You see all the text, but Word hides items such as headers and footers, margins, 
and objects. Figure  6-12 shows Draft view.  
 Figure 6-11.   Outline view is a great tool for working on the structure of a document. You can expand different sections 
of the document to different levels as needed  
 

182
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Tip   Draft view is usually easiest to use if you make Word wrap the text to the window so that the 
text fills the window—otherwise, you’ll often get blank space on the right side of the window, or you 
may have to scroll horizontally to reach the end of the lines. Word doesn’t do this by default. To make 
Word wrap the text, choose Word ➤ Preferences to display the Word Preferences window, and then 
click the View icon in the Authoring and Proofing Tools section. In the View preferences pane, select 
the Wrap to window check box in the Show Window Elements area. Close the Preferences window by 
clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 Figure 6-12.   Draft view enables you to concentrate on the text of the document without worrying about layout 
elements such as headers and footers. To display as much text as possible and avoid having white space on the right 
side of the window (as shown here), turn on the Wrap to window feature 
 

183
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Opening Extra Windows 
 At first, Word displays a single window of each document. For short documents, this is all 
you need, but for long or complex documents, you may find it helpful to open extra windows 
so that you can see two or more parts of the document at once or use different  views  . 
 For example, when you’re writing a lengthy report, you may benefit from seeing the 
introduction as you write the conclusion, to make sure you nail each of your main points. 
Or you may want to open a window showing the outline of a document so that you can add 
headings and change its structure even as you write regular text in one of its sections. 
 Here’s how to open and work with extra windows:
  Open a new window : Choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ New Window from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ New Window from the menu bar. Word adds “: 1” 
to the document’s name in the title bar of the original window to indicate 
that it’s now the first window of the document. The second window’s 
name includes “: 2”—for example, Linguistics Report: 2.  
  Arrange your Word windows : Click and drag the windows to where you 
need them.  
  Switch from window to window : If you can see the window you want, 
click it. Otherwise, choose View ➤ Switch Windows ➤ Switch Windows 
from the Ribbon, or open the Window menu on the menu bar, and then 
click the window you want on the list at the bottom.  
  Close a window : Click the window’s Close button (the red button at the left 
end of the title bar). The document remains open until you close its last 
window. 
 Note   Word includes an Arrange All command (choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ Arrange All from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ Arrange All from the menu bar), but it tiles the Word windows horizontally, 
which usually isn’t what you want. Normally it’s best to arrange your windows manually, but you 
can also use a third-party utility such as Divvy (   www.mizage.com/divvy/  ) or SizeUp (  http://
irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/  ) or create a macro using Visual Basic for Applications 
(VBA). If possible, try such a third-party utility before buying it because the Office apps appear to 
disagree with some of them. 
 Tip  Press Cmd+F6 or Option+F6 to display the next window (of any open Word document, not 
just the one that has multiple windows open). Press Cmd+Shift+F6 or Option+Shift+F6 to display 
the previous window. 

184
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 Splitting the Document Window into Two Panes 
 Sometimes it’s useful to split the  document  window into two panes so that you can work in two 
different parts of the same document at once. Splitting the document window is like opening a 
new window except that you don’t need more space. Figure  6-13 shows the document window 
split, with the upper pane showing Print Layout view and the lower pane showing Outline view.  
 To split the document window into two equal parts, choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ Split from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ Split from the menu bar. You can also press Cmd+Option+S. You can 
then adjust the split by dragging the split bar up or down as needed. 
 Once you’ve split the window, you can scroll each pane separately so you can display a 
different part of the document in each pane. You can also use a different view in each pane; 
for example, you can display the document’s outline in Outline view in one pane while you 
write the introduction or summary in Normal view in the other pane. 
 Figure 6-13.   You can split a window into two panes so that you can use two different views at once or work in different 
parts of the document 
 

185
CHAPTER 6: Entering Text and Using Views
 To switch to the other pane, click in it or press F6. 
 When you want to remove the split, take one of these actions:
  Pointing device : Drag the split bar to the top of the window (to keep the 
lower pane) or to the bottom (to keep the upper pane).  
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Option+S.  
  Ribbon : Choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ Remove Split.  
  Menu bar : Choose Window ➤ Remove Split.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned new tricks for inserting text quickly and easily in Word document, 
including how to insert the text from an existing document and how to create AutoText 
entries to reuse boilerplate text. You also grasped how to select blocks of text using 
the Option-drag maneuver and the Extend Selection feature, and learned new ways of 
navigating around a document using keyboard shortcuts and the browse object. 
 Better yet, you now know how to get Word to make automatic backups of your documents, 
how to make the most of Word’s views, and how to open extra windows or split a single 
window into two panes. 
 In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to save any amount of time by formatting your 
documents the right way—by using Word’s powerful styles.  
 Tip  You can also zoom out in one pane to get an overview of the document as a whole, and you 
can zoom in using the other pane so that you can see the detail of a section.

 Formatting Your Documents 
Swiftly and Easily 
 To make your documents look good, you must apply formatting to the text and other 
elements in them. That’s probably obvious, but Word gives you such a wide range of 
formatting options that it’s easy to use the wrong ones. This chapter teaches you the 
right way to format a document quickly and consistently by using styles—collections of 
formatting—rather than by applying direct formatting piece by piece. It also shows you how 
to use the Sidebar pane and the Find feature to navigate your documents and how to make 
the most of the versatile Replace feature. 
 Before we start, a word of warning: styles are an extremely powerful tool that can save you 
huge amounts of time—but you will need to invest some time and effort in understanding 
how they work before you can harness all their power. To complicate things, Word provides 
several different tools for working with styles, and the way these tools interact and overlap 
takes some getting used to. But once you get the hang of them, you’ll find that you can work 
swiftly and effectively with them. 
 Understanding Word’s Many Types of Formatting 
 Word gives you such a wide variety of formatting that it’s easy to waste time by using the 
wrong ones for your needs. This section explains the different types of  formatting  and shows 
you the best and fastest way to use them. 
 Understanding Direct Formatting and When to Use It 
 Where most people start is by using direct formatting, the kind of formatting that you can 
apply by using the controls in the Font group and the Paragraph group on the Home tab of 
the Ribbon (see Figure  7-1 ). For example, you can create a heading paragraph by changing 
to a different font, increasing the font size, changing the font color, giving it an “outdent” so 
that it sticks out into the margin, and adding extra space before and after the paragraph.  

188
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Each part of this formatting is easy enough to apply—click this, click that, click the other—
but it takes time. And if you need to create another heading of the same type, you need to 
do it all over again. Or you can copy and paste the formatted paragraph and type the new 
heading over it (as many people do) or use Word’s clever Format Painter feature (which you’ll 
learn about later in this chapter). 
 Because direct formatting takes extra time and effort, it’s best to apply it only when you have 
formatted your documents almost completely using better tools, as discussed next.  
 Understanding Styles and When to Use Them 
 To help you apply standard formatting quickly, Word includes a feature called styles. A  style 
is a collection of formatting that you can apply all at once. So, once you’ve set up a style for 
the heading that contains exactly the formatting you want, you can apply it in a single click. 
 In fact, in many cases you don’t even need to create the styles yourself. Word comes with 
many styles built in to its Normal template and other templates. As soon as you create a 
document based on one of these templates, you can start applying styles, formatting your 
documents swiftly and consistently. 
 Word gives you four different types of styles:
  Paragraph style : This is a style you apply to a whole paragraph at a 
time—you can’t apply it to just part of a paragraph. A paragraph style 
contains a full range of formatting for that paragraph: everything from 
the font name, size, and color to the indentation and spacing for the 
paragraph, and the language used. For example, many documents use 
a Body Text style that gives a distinctive look to the body paragraphs.  
  Character style : This is a style you apply to individual characters within 
a paragraph, usually to make it look different from the style of the rest of 
the paragraph. For example, within a paragraph that uses the Body Text 
style, you can apply an Emphasis character style to a word to make it 
stand out.  
  Table style : This is a style you can apply to a Word table. Like a 
paragraph style, the style can contain font and paragraph formatting, 
but it can also contain table formatting such as borders and shading.  
  List style : This is a style you can apply to one or more paragraphs to 
make them into a list—a numbered list, a bulleted list, or a multilevel list. 
A list style usually contains font formatting and numbering formatting.   
 Figure 7-1.   You can easily apply direct formatting such as font formatting and paragraph formatting using the Font 
group and Paragraph group controls on the Ribbon, but you can save time and effort by applying styles from the Styles 
group or the Quick Style panel first 
 

189
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Styles enable you not only to apply formatting quickly but also to change the formatting by 
modifying or replacing the style:  
  Modify the style : If the style doesn’t look right, you can modify it. Each 
paragraph to which you’ve applied the style takes on the changes you 
make immediately.  
  Replace one style with another style : You can replace every instance 
of one style with another style in moments, making sweeping changes 
right through a document.  
 Formatting Your Documents the Best Way 
 Here’s the best way to format your documents:
  First, format each paragraph with a paragraph style. This style gives the 
whole paragraph its overall look. If the paragraph is a heading, the Heading 
style tells Word to include the paragraph in the document’s outline.  
  Next, use character styles to add extra formatting within paragraphs. 
For example, use a character style such as Emphasis to add impact to a 
word or phrase that you want to stand out.  
  If the document contains lists, apply the appropriate list style to each 
list. For example, apply a numbered list style to a list that needs 
numbers, or apply a bulleted list style to a list that needs bullets.  
  If the document contains tables, apply a suitable table style to each table.  
 
UNDERSTANDING WHERE WORD KEEPS STYLES
 Word keeps styles in templates and documents. As you learned in Chapter   1  , a template is a file that contains the 
basic structure of a document, such as the structure of a business letter. When you create a new document, you can 
choose whether to base it on a particular template or on the Normal template that Word uses for “blank” documents. 
 The styles available from the Styles group and the Styles panel when you first open Word are the ones stored in 
the Normal template. You can customize these styles as needed, but be aware that the changes carry through to 
all documents based on the Normal template. 
 When you create or open a document based on a template other than the Normal template, Word makes that 
template’s styles available in the Styles group and the Styles panel. If the template is one that comes with Word 
or one that you’ve downloaded from the Web, it will most likely contain its own styles. You can modify these 
styles if you need to do so. 
 When you create a new template, you can create all the custom styles you need. You can also import styles 
from other templates or documents to save time. 
 Even though each document picks up the details of the styles from the attached template, the document itself 
contains information about the styles. This enables Word to display the document correctly when the template is 
not available. 

190
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 When you’re working in a document and modify a style, you can choose whether to save the changes in 
that document or in the template attached to the document. Normally you’ll want to save the changes in the 
template, making them available to all existing documents based on the template and any new documents 
you create based on the template. By contrast, changes you save in the document are available only to that 
document (and to other documents you base on it). 
 Applying Styles to a Document 
 Word 2016 gives you three main ways of applying styles to a document:  
  Ribbon : Use the Quick Style box and Quick Style panel on the Home 
tab. The Quick Style box and Quick Style panel together make up what 
Microsoft calls the Quick Style Gallery.  
  Styles pane : Open the Styles pane and use it to apply styles or work 
with styles.  
  Styles dialog box : Open the Style dialog box, and use it to apply a style.  
 Each method has its pros and cons. Let’s look at each method in turn. 
 Applying Styles from the Quick Style Box and Quick Style 
Panel on the Ribbon 
 Usually, the easiest way to get started with styles is to apply styles by using the Quick Style 
box and Quick Style panel on the Home tab of the Ribbon. Follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Click in the paragraph to which you want to apply the style. If you 
want to apply the style to several paragraphs at once, select all or 
part of each paragraph.  
 2. 
 Apply the style:
  If the style name is in the Quick Style box that appears in the Styles 
group, click it.  
  If the style name doesn’t appear in the Styles group, hold the pointer 
over the Quick Style box to display the panel button, and then click 
the panel button to display the Quick Style panel (see Figure  7-2 ). 
Then click the style name.  
 Note  You can also click the left-arrow button on the left of the Quick Style box to scroll the list 
of displayed styles to the right or click the right-arrow button on the right of the Quick Style box to 
scroll the list to the left. But usually it’s easier to simply display the Quick Style panel so that you 
can see all the styles in the Quick Style Gallery, and then click the style you want. 

191
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Applying Styles with the Styles Pane 
 When you need to work extensively with styles, use the Styles pane. Choose Home ➤ Styles 
➤ Styles Pane to display the Styles pane. As you can see in Figure  7-3 , the Styles pane at 
first appears docked to the right side of the Word window; if you prefer, you can drag it by 
the title bar to undock it, and then move it freely either within the Word window or outside 
the Word window.  
 Tip  Never use the Normal style as the formatting for the body of your documents. The problem is 
that Word uses the Normal style as the default, so it can be hard to tell whether you’ve applied the 
Normal style or Word has applied it because you haven’t applied another style. For the body text in 
your documents, use a style such as Body Text instead, keeping the Normal style only for text you 
still need to give a style. You can then search (as described later in this chapter) for the Normal style 
and apply another style to each instance of it as needed. 
 Figure 7-2.   Click a style in the Quick Style box or the Quick Style panel to apply the style to the current paragraph or 
selected paragraphs  
 

192
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 In the Styles pane, you can take the following actions:
  Check the current style : The Current style box at the top of the pane 
shows the style of the current paragraph or selected text.  
  Start creating a new style : Click the New Style button.  
  Select all instances of the current style : Click the Select All button. By 
selecting all instances, you can then apply another style easily.  
  Apply another style : In the Apply a style list box, click the style you want 
to apply.  
  Choose which styles to show in the list : Many Word templates contain 
large numbers of styles, so you don’t necessarily want all the styles to 
appear in the Styles pane. Use the List pop-up menu to control which 
styles do appear. Your choices are as follows:
  Recommended : Click this item to display the styles that Word 
recommends for widespread use in documents of this type.  
  Styles in Use : Click this item to restrict the list to the styles you’re 
currently using in the documents based on this template.  
 Figure 7-3.   The Styles pane is the best choice for extensive work with styles. The ¶ symbol to the right of a style’s 
name indicates a paragraph style; the letter a indicates a character style 
 

193
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  In Current Document : Click this item to restrict the list to the styles 
the current document uses so far. This is often a good choice 
once you’ve applied most of the styles you intend to use for the 
document at least once.  
  All Styles : Click this item to display the full list of styles. You’ll need 
to scroll up and down to find the styles you need.  
  Toggle styles guides on and off : Select the Show Styles Guides check 
box to display a color-coded number next to each paragraph in Print 
Layout view showing the style. The Styles pane shows the color-coded 
numbers next to their styles. For example, in Figure  7-4 , the Heading 1 
style has the number 1 and is applied to the top paragraph.  
  Toggle direct formatting guides on and off : Select the Show Direct 
Formatting Guides check box to make Word display a box around each 
item that contains direct formatting. For example, in Figure  7-4 , the word 
 Dynamic in the second paragraph has direct italic formatting applied.  
 Figure 7-4.   Select the Show Styles Guides check box in the Styles pane to display color-coded numbers showing the 
styles. Select the Show Direct Formatting Guides check box to display boxes around the text that has direct formatting 
applied, such as “Dynamic” in the second body paragraph 
 

194
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Select all instances of a style : Move the pointer over the style name in 
the Apply a style list so that a pop-up arrow appears, click the arrow to 
display the pop-up menu (see Figure  7-5 ), and then click the Select All 
item on the menu.  
  Open the Modify Style dialog box : Open the pop-up menu for the style, 
and then click the Modify Style item.  
  Delete a style : Open the pop-up menu for the style, and then click 
the Delete item. This item isn’t available for key built-in styles such as 
Heading 1 and Normal.  
 Figure 7-5.   Use the pop-up menu for a style to access the Select All command, the Modify Style command, the Delete 
command, and the Update to Match Selection command  
 Tip   After displaying the direct formatting guides, click one of the boxes to see the details of the 
formatting applied. The Current style box at the top of the Styles pane shows the details, such as 
Body Text + Italic. If you want to remove the direct formatting, hold the pointer over the Current 
style box, click the pop-up button to display the pop-up menu, and then click Clear Formatting. 
 

195
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Update a style to match the selection : When you’ve applied a style but 
then changed it with direct formatting, you can update the style so that 
it takes on the direct formatting. To do this, select the paragraph, open 
the pop-up menu for the style, and then click the Update to Match 
Selection item.  
 Applying Styles Using the Style Dialog Box 
 The third way of applying styles is to use the  Style dialog box  . This method is sometimes 
useful, but generally it’s more awkward than using the Styles pane. 
 To apply a style using the Style dialog box, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click in the paragraph to which you want to apply the style, or select 
the text that’ll receive the style.  
 2. 
 Choose Format ➤ Style to open the Style dialog box (see Figure  7-6 ). 
 3. 
 In the Styles list box, click the style you want to apply.  
 4. 
 Click the Apply button. Word closes the Style dialog box and applies 
the style.  
 Note   If the style you’re looking for doesn’t appear in the Styles list box, open the List pop-up 
menu and choose All Styles instead of Styles in Use or User-Defined Styles. 
 Figure 7-6.   You can use the Style dialog box to apply a style, to modify an existing style, or to start creating a new style  
 

196
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Changing the Styles in the Quick Style Gallery 
 The  Quick Style Gallery  on the Home tab of the Ribbon includes a selection of styles to get 
you started. But if you apply styles frequently from the Quick Style box or Quick Style panel, 
as is handy, you may want to customize the selection of styles in the Quick Style Gallery. 
 You can customize the Quick Style Gallery like this:
  Remove an existing style : In either the Quick Style box or the Quick Style 
panel, Ctrl-click or right-click the style, and then click Remove from 
Quick Style Gallery on the context menu.  
  Add an existing style : In the Apply a style list in the Styles pane, hold the 
pointer over the style, click the pop-up button, and then click the Modify 
Style item. In the Modify Style dialog box, select the Add to Quick Style 
list, and then click the OK button.  
  Create a new style and add it : Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Format some text with the formatting you want the new style 
to have.  
 2. 
 Select the text you’ve formatted.  
 3. 
 Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Styles Pane to display the Styles pane if 
it’s not already displayed.  
 4. 
 Click the New Style button to display the New Style dialog box 
(see Figure  7-7 ).  

197
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 5. 
 In the Name box, type the name you want the style to have.  
 6. 
 Choose other settings for the style as needed. You’ll dig into these 
in the section “Creating Custom Styles” later in this chapter.  
 7. 
 Select the Add to template check box if you want to add the style to 
the template. This is usually a good idea.  
 8. 
 Make sure the “Add to Quick Style list” check box is selected.  
 9. 
 Click the OK button. Word closes the New Style dialog box and 
adds the style to the Quick Style Gallery. You can then apply it like 
any other style.  
 Figure 7-7.   Select the Add to Quick Style list check box in the New Style dialog box to make Word add the new style to 
the Quick Style Gallery 
 

198
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Applying Styles Using the Keyboard 
 You can also apply styles by  using keyboard  shortcuts, which is useful when you’re typing. 
Table  7-1 shows standard keyboard shortcuts, which work in Word’s Normal template and in 
many other templates.  
 See Which Styles a Document Uses 
 To see which style a particular paragraph uses, you can click in the paragraph and look at the 
style selected in the Styles pane or the Quick Style Gallery controls on the Ribbon. In  Print 
Layout view  , you can also select the Show Styles Guides check box in the Styles pane to display 
the color-coded numbered boxes to the left of the text, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 
 To see the style applied to each paragraph in Draft view and Outline view, you can open the 
style area, which is a vertical strip at the left side of the Word window that displays the style 
applied to each paragraph (see Figure  7-8 ). 
 Tip  If you want to apply other styles from the keyboard, create keyboard shortcuts for them, as 
discussed in Chapter   5  . 
 Figure 7-8.   In Draft view and Outline view, you can display the style area on the left side of the window to see the style 
applied to each paragraph 
 Table 7-1.   Standard Keyboard Shortcuts for Applying Styles in Word 
 Style

 Normal 
 Cmd+Shift+N 
 Heading 1 
 Cmd+Option+1 
 Heading 2 
 Cmd+Option+2 
 Heading 3 
 Cmd+Option+3 
 

199
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 To display the style area, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences from the menu bar or press Cmd+, 
(Cmd and the comma key) to display the Word Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the Authoring and Proofing Tools area, click the View icon to 
display the View preferences pane.  
 3. 
 In the Show Window Elements area, enter the measurement in the 
Style area width box. One inch is usually about right.  
 4. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Now click the Draft button to the left of the zoom control on the status bar to switch to Draft 
view, or click the Outline button to switch to Outline view. The style area appears on the left 
of the screen, and you can easily see the style applied to each paragraph. 
 Creating Custom Styles 
 If you find that Word’s styles don’t meet your needs, you can either create custom styles of 
your own or customize the built-in styles to make them suitable. The easiest way to create a 
custom style is by example, and that’s the way you’ll look at first. After that, you’ll also see 
how to create a new style by specifying its formatting in the New Style dialog box. 
 Creating a Custom Style by Example 
 To create a custom style by example, you set up a paragraph or other object with the 
formatting you want. You then tell Word to create a  style from that formatted text so you can 
reapply the style wherever you need it. 
 Type a paragraph of text to use as a sample, or pick an existing paragraph in the document. 
If Word has an existing style that’s similar to the style you want to create, apply that style 
first so you don’t need to make as many formatting changes. 
 Choosing the Font Formatting for a Style 
 Often, you’ll want to start by choosing the  font formatting  for the style. You can do so by 
using any of the standard tools:
  Font group : Use the controls in the Font group of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon.  
 Tip  To change the width of the style area, move the pointer over the line that divides the style 
area from the text. When the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, click and drag the line to 
the width you want. Drag the line all the way to the left to close the style area. 

200
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Font dialog box : Choose Format ➤ Font or press Cmd+D to open the 
Font dialog box. On the Font tab (see Figure  7-9 ), choose the font, font 
style, size, color, underline, and other effects you need (for example, 
small caps). Click the OK button when you’ve finished.  
 Note  On the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box, you can change the scaling, spacing, and 
position of fonts. For example, you can change the spacing to spread the letters farther apart, or you 
can choose the Raised position to create a superscript. You can also work with typography features 
such as ligatures (two letters joined together), which you normally need only if you’re typesetting a 
document. 
 Figure 7-9.   You can quickly choose font formatting on the Font tab of the Font dialog box 
 

201
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Choosing the Paragraph Formatting for the Style 
 You can set some  paragraph formatting  for your sample paragraph by using the controls 
in the Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon, but you’ll usually want to open the 
Paragraph dialog box so you can reach all the most useful types of paragraph formatting. 
 To choose  paragraph formatting  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Format ➤ Paragraph on the menu bar, or press 
Cmd+Option+M to open the Paragraph dialog box.   
 2. 
 On the Indents and Spacing tab (see Figure  7-10 ), choose settings 
like this:
  Alignment : Choose Left, Centered, Right, or Justified, as needed. 
Justified text is aligned with both margins.  
 Figure 7-10.   Choose alignment, indentation, and spacing on the Indents and Spacing tab of the Paragraph dialog box 
 

202
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Outline level : If you want Word to treat this style as a type of 
heading, click the appropriate level, from Level 1 (a top-level item) 
down to Level 9. Choose Body Text (the default setting) if you want 
Word to treat paragraphs of this style as regular body text.  
  Indentation : In the Left box and the Right box, set any indentation 
needed from the margins. To create a first-line indent, choose First 
line in the Special pop-up menu, and then set the distance in the By 
box. You can also create a hanging indent (also known as an 
 outdent ) by choosing Hanging in the Special pop-up menu. 
  Spacing before and after  paragraphs : In the Before box and the After 
box, set the number of points of empty space you want before or 
after each paragraph that uses this style. Select the “Don’t add 
space between paragraphs of the same style” check box if you want 
to suppress space between successive paragraphs that use the 
same style (for example, Body Text style). 
  Line spacing : In the Line Spacing pop-up menu, choose the line 
spacing you want: Single, 1.5 lines, Double, At least, Exactly, or 
Multiple. For the At least setting or the Exactly setting, set the number 
of points in the At box. For the Multiple setting, set the number of 
lines in the At box—for example, use  3 to set three-line spacing.  
  Snap to grid : Select the “Snap to grid when document grid is 
defined” check box if you want objects to snap automatically to the 
document grid.  
 3. 
 Click the Line and Page Breaks tab to display it (see Figure  7-11 ), and 
then choose settings like this:
  Widow/Orphan control : Select this check box if you want to avoid a 
single line appearing at the top of a page (a widow) and a single line 
appearing at the end of a page (an orphan), each separated from 
the rest of its paragraph. Normal typesetting practice is to suppress 
both widows and orphans.  
 Note Select the “Automatically adjust right indent when document grid is defined” check box If 
you want Word to automatically adjust the right indent when the document contains a custom grid. 
This grid is normally invisible and is used for placing graphical objects (such as images or shapes) 
quickly and accurately.
 Note A point (pt) is  1 / 72 -inch. Try six points after single-spaced paragraphs if you want a small 
gap, or try 12 points for a larger gap. Body text doesn’t usually need space before it, but you will 
probably want to add 12–24 points of space before a heading to separate it from the text above it, 
and about 12 points to separate it from the text below.

203
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Keep with next : Select this check box to make Word keep the 
paragraph on the same page as the  next paragraph  . Typically, you’ll 
set this option for a heading style to prevent Word from putting it at 
the bottom of a page with the following paragraph on the next page. 
Don’t use this option for body text paragraphs, or they’ll end up 
bouncing from one page to the following page so that they can stay 
together.  
  Keep lines together : Select this check box to make Word keep all 
the lines of a paragraph on the same page rather than breaking the 
paragraph across pages. This setting is useful for headings and 
display paragraphs, but not for body text.  
  Page break  before : Select this check box to have Word start a new 
page each time the style occurs. You normally use this only for 
styles such as chapter headings.  
 Figure 7-11.   In the Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box, you can tell Word whether to keep a 
paragraph with the next paragraph or add a page break before it 
 

204
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 4. 
 If you want to set tabs for the style, click the Tabs button at the 
bottom of the Paragraph dialog box to display the Tabs dialog box 
(see Figure  7-12 ). You can then set tabs like this:
  Change the   default spacing : Adjust the value in the Default tab stops 
text box. For example, if you want Word to move 1 inch each time 
you press Tab in a paragraph that has this style, enter  1" . 
  Set a new tab stop : In the Tab stop position text box, type the 
position for the tab, such as  1" . Click the appropriate option button 
in the Alignment area, such as the Left option button. If you want to 
use tab leader characters, click the appropriate option button in the 
Leader area. Then click the Add (+) button. 
 Tip Instead of opening the Tabs dialog box from the Paragraph dialog box, you can open it directly 
by choosing Format ➤ Tabs. 
 Figure 7-12.   Use the  Tabs dialog box to set any custom tab stops that the style needs 
 Note The Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box contains two other settings. 
Select the Suppress line numbers check box if you want to suppress line numbers (in automatically 
numbered documents such as legal papers) for a particular paragraph. Select the Don’t hyphenate 
check box if you want to prevent Word’s hyphenation feature from hyphenating the paragraph.
 

205
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Delete an existing tab stop : Click the tab in the Tab stop position list 
box, and then click the Delete (–) button. Click the Clear All button if 
you want to delete all the tabs.  
  Move or change a tab stop : Delete the tab stop you want to change, 
and create a new tab stop with the position and alignment you want.  
 5. 
 When you’ve finished setting tabs for the style, click the OK button to 
close the Tabs dialog box.  
 Adding Bullets or Numbering to the Style 
 If you’re creating a list style, add whichever bullets or  numbering  it needs. The quick way to 
add bullets or numbering is to use the first three controls in the Paragraph group on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon. Click the Bullets pop-up button, the Numbering pop-up button, or 
the Multilevel List pop-up button in the Paragraph group to open the panel, and then click 
the style you want to apply. Figure  7-13 shows the Numbering panel.  
 Note  You can also apply the default style of bullets, numbering, or multilevel list by clicking the 
button itself (for example, the Bullets button) rather than the drop-down button. If you need to 
customize bulleted or numbered lists, choose Format ➤ Bullets and Numbering from the menu bar, 
and then work in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
 Note A left tab is the usual kind: the text starts left-aligned at the position of the tab stop. A center 
tab centers the text around the tab stop and is widely used in headers and footers that have a left 
section (at the left margin), a center section (with a center tab), and a right section (with a right tab). 
A right tab makes the right part of the text align with the tab stop, so as you type, the text moves 
back to the left. A decimal tab aligns the text with the decimal point, enabling you to align numbers 
with different numbers of decimal places (for example, 123.45 and 678.9). A bar tab is a way of 
creating a vertical line but is little used these days.

206
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Adding Borders and Shading to the Style 
 Next, add any borders or  shading  that the style needs. You can apply individual borders 
by clicking the Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Borders pop-up button and then clicking the border 
you want in the panel, but you can get greater control by choosing Format ➤ Borders and 
Shading from the menu bar to display the Borders and Shading dialog box. 
 To add borders, click the Borders tab of the Borders and Shading dialog box (see Figure  7-14 ), 
and then work like this:
 1. 
 In the Apply to pop-up menu, choose Paragraph if you want to apply 
the border to the whole paragraph. Choose Text if you want to put 
the border only around the text.  
 Figure 7-13.   You can quickly apply bullets, numbering, or a multilevel list by using the Bullets pop-up button, the 
Numbering pop-up button, or the Multilevel List pop-up button in the Paragraph group of the Home tab 
 

207
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 2. 
 To apply a standard border, click Box, Shadow, or 3-D in the Setting 
area. To create a custom border, click the borders in the diagram in 
the Preview area to place borders where you want them. When you 
click a border in the diagram, Word selects the Custom item in the 
Setting area.  
 3. 
 Change the border’s appearance by using the Style list, the Color 
pop-up menu, and the Width pop-up menu.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Borders and Shading dialog box.  
 Note   To move the borders closer to the text or farther away from it, click the Options button. In 
the Borders and Shading Options dialog box that opens, adjust the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right 
measurements, and then click the OK button. 
 Note   A paragraph border is usually the most useful kind of border for a style, but if you’re 
creating a style that will occupy most (or all) of a page, you may want to create a page border in 
the style. In this case, click the Page Border tab in the Borders and Shading dialog box, select the 
appropriate document part in the Apply to pop-up menu (for example, select the This section item), 
and then work with the border controls in the same way as for applying a paragraph border. 
 Figure 7-14.   Use the Borders tab of the Borders and Shading dialog box to quickly apply borders to a paragraph 
 

208
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 To apply shading to a style, click the Shading tab in the Borders and Shading dialog box, 
and then follow these steps:
 1. 
 In the Apply to pop-up menu, choose Paragraph if you want to apply 
the shading to the whole paragraph. Choose Text if you want to 
apply the border only to the text.  
 2. 
 In the Fill pop-up menu, choose the shading color you want.  
 3. 
 In the Style pop-up menu, choose the shading style, such as 25% 
shading or Dk Trellis shading.  
 4. 
 In the Color pop-up menu, choose the pattern color.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Borders and Shading dialog box.  
 Adding Language Formatting to the Style 
 The final type of formatting that you can include in the style is  language formatting  . Unlike 
almost all the other types of formatting, language formatting isn’t visual formatting. Instead, 
it tells Word to treat the text as being in a particular language. For example, if you’re writing 
a paper on French poets, you could create a style for block quotes and set its language to 
French. The spell checker would then refrain from querying the words as not being in the 
English language. 
 To apply language formatting to text, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Tools ➤ Language to display the Language dialog box (see 
Figure  7-15 ). 
 Note  When you apply language formatting, the text you format doesn’t actually have to be in the 
language you specify, but you’re telling Word to treat it as if it is. 

209
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 2. 
 In the “Mark selected text as” list box, select the language you want 
to use. Your current language appears at the top of the list to save 
you from having to scroll to find it.  
 3. 
 If you want to tell the spell checker and grammar checker not to 
check the text, select the “Do not check spelling or grammar” check 
box. This setting is useful for styles you use for text that will contain 
apparent misspellings, such as computer code.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Language dialog box.  
 Creating the Style 
 Once you have set up the paragraph with all the formatting it needs, you can  create  a style 
like this:
 1. 
 Select the paragraph.  
 2. 
 Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Styles Pane from the Ribbon to open the 
Styles pane.  
 Figure 7-15.   In the Language dialog box, you can specify the language used for the text. You can also turn off spelling 
and grammar checking for the style 
 

210
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 3. 
 Click the New Style button to display the New Style dialog box 
(shown in Figure  7-7 , earlier in this chapter).  
 4. 
 Type the name for the style in the Name text box.  
 5. 
 In the Style type pop-up menu, choose the style type: Paragraph, 
Character, Table, or List.  
 6. 
 In the “Style for following paragraph” pop-up menu, choose the style 
you want Word to apply automatically to the next paragraph when 
you press the Return key at the end of a paragraph with this style. 
For a display style (such as a heading), you will normally want a body 
style next; for a body style, you will probably want to continue with 
the same body style.  
 7. 
 Select the Add to template check box if you want Word to add this 
style to the document’s template so that it will be available for other 
documents. Usually, this is helpful. If you clear this check box, Word 
stores the style in the document, where other documents can’t use it.  
 8. 
 Select the “Add to Quick Style list” check box if you want Word to 
include this style in the Quick Style Gallery. Otherwise, clear this 
check box.  
 9. 
 Clear the Automatically update check box unless you want Word to 
update the style without consulting you when it thinks you’ve altered 
the style. Automatic updating is well intended but usually confusing.  
 10.  Click the OK button to close the New Style dialog box.  
 Modifying an Existing Style 
 You can modify an existing style by opening it in the  Modify Style dialog box  and working 
from there. You can also change the formatting of a paragraph of text that uses the style and 
then make the style pick up your changes. 
 Changing a Style Using the Modify Style Dialog Box 
 The more formal way of modifying an existing style is to open the style in the Modify Style dialog 
box, which is a renamed version of the New Style dialog box. You can then use the formatting 
controls and the options on the Format pop-up menu to adjust the style exactly as you need it. 
 Note   If you need to make any other changes to the style’s formatting after you’ve opened the 
New Style dialog box, use the formatting controls in the middle of the New Style dialog box or the 
Format pop-up menu in the lower-left corner. For example, to change the paragraph formatting, 
click the Format pop-up menu, and then click Paragraph to display the Paragraph dialog box. 

211
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 You can open the Modify Style dialog box from the Styles pane, the Quick Style Gallery, or 
the Style dialog box:
  Styles pane : Move the pointer over the style name, click the pop-up 
button, and then click Modify Style.  
  Quick Style Gallery : Ctrl-click or right-click the style name, and then 
click Modify on the context menu.  
  Style dialog box : Select the style in the Styles list box, and then click the 
Modify button.  
 Updating a Style with New Formatting 
 Instead of modifying an existing style as described in the previous section, you can apply 
a style, change its formatting, and then  update  the style to match the new formatting. This 
method can be useful when you’re developing a template and you need to keep adjusting 
styles to make everything look and fit right. 
 To update a style with new formatting, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Apply the style using whichever tool you prefer (for example, the 
Styles pane).  
 2. 
 Reformat the text as needed.  
 3. 
 Update the style in one of these ways:
  Styles pane : Hold the pointer over the style name, click the pop-up 
button, and then click Update to Match Selection on the pop-up 
menu.  
  Quick Style Gallery : Ctrl-click or right-click the style, and then click 
Update to Match Selection on the context menu.  
 Applying Direct Formatting on Top of Styles 
 After you’ve applied the style each paragraph needs and you’ve applied list styles and 
character styles as needed, you can finish off the formatting by applying direct formatting to 
any parts of the document that need it. For example, you may need to apply different font 
formatting to pick out special display elements or add more space before some paragraphs. 
 Note   To get the most out of Word’s automatic formatting features, use direct formatting as little 
as possible. If you need to apply the same direct formatting to several different items, consider 
creating a style with that formatting so you can apply it instantly in future. If you will need to use 
the same direct formatting and text, save it as an AutoText entry (see Chapter   6 for instructions). 

212
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 To apply  direct formatting  , use the tools you met earlier in this chapter for setting up 
font formatting, paragraph formatting, bullets and numbering, and so on. Here are some 
examples:
  Font formatting : Use the controls in the Font group on the Home tab of 
the Ribbon or in the Font dialog box.  
  Paragraph formatting : Use the controls in the Paragraph group on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon or in the Paragraph dialog box.  
  Bullets and numbering : Use the controls in the Paragraph group on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon.  
 Copying and Pasting Formatting Using the Format Painter 
 When you’ve painstakingly applied direct formatting to text or another object, you may want 
to reuse that direct formatting for other text or another object. The straightforward way to do 
so is to copy the text (or object), paste it in, and then type the new text over it. This works 
fine for new text items or objects (unless you forget to replace the pasted text), but it’s not 
efficient if the text is already there.  
 Instead, you can use Word’s Format Painter. This feature enables you to pick up the 
formatting for a selection and then “paint” it on other text or another object. Follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Select the text or object that contains the formatting you want 
to copy. 
 2. 
 Choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Format Painter (the button with the 
paintbrush icon) on the Ribbon or press Cmd+Shift+C to copy the 
formatting. Word changes the pointer to an I-beam with a paint brush 
beside it.  
 3. 
 Drag the I-beam and paint brush over the text or object to which you 
want to apply the formatting. Word applies the formatting and then 
restores the pointer.  
 Tip   To remove direct formatting from text, select the text, and then press Ctrl-spacebar. If you 
find this keyboard shortcut doesn’t work, it may be because another app is already using it. Choose 
Apple ➤ System Preferences, click the Keyboard icon, and then click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. 
You can then click an app to see which keyboard shortcuts it’s using. 
 Tip   If you want to apply the formatting to multiple items, double-click the Format button. The 
pointer becomes the Format Painter I-beam until you turn it off by clicking the Format button again 
or pressing the Esc key. 

213
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Navigating Quickly Around Your Documents 
 To help you navigate quickly around your documents, Word provides the Navigation pane, 
the Find and Replace feature, and the Go To feature. You met the Go To feature in Chapter   6 ; 
you’ll meet the Navigation pane and the Find and Replace feature here. 
 Using the Sidebar 
 The  Sidebar  is a pane that appears at the left side of the Word window and contains four 
panes that you can switch among by clicking the four buttons at the top of the pane:
  Thumbnails pane : This pane (shown on the left in Figure  7-16 ) displays 
thumbnail pictures of your document’s pages. Click the thumbnail for 
the page you want to display.  
 Figure 7-16.   In the Sidebar on the left of the Word window, you can display (from left to right) the Thumbnail pane, the 
Document Map pane, the Reviewing pane, or the Search pane 
 

214
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Document Map pane : This pane (shown second from left in Figure  7-16 ) 
displays your document as an outline of collapsible headings. Word also 
refers to this pane as the Navigation pane. If a heading contains 
subheadings, a triangle appears next to it. Click the triangle to display 
the headings or to hide them again. Click the heading you want to 
display in the main part of the window.  
  Reviewing pane : This pane (shown second from right in Figure  7-16 ) 
displays a summary of the tracked changes in the document. You’ll learn 
how to use the Reviewing pane in Chapter   10 . 
  Search pane : This pane (shown on the right in Figure  7-16 ) lets you 
search through your documents and see a summary of all search 
results. You’ll dig into how to use the Search pane later in this chapter.  
 You can open the Sidebar in either of these ways:
  Ribbon : Choose View ➤ Show ➤ Navigation Pane, selecting the 
Navigation Pane check box. Despite the “Navigation Pane” name, this 
command displays whichever tab of the Sidebar you used last.  
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Sidebar ➤ Thumbnail, View ➤ Sidebar ➤ 
Navigation (for the Document Map pane), View ➤ Sidebar ➤ Reviewing, 
or View ➤ Sidebar ➤ Search.  
 Once the Sidebar is open, you can resize it by dragging its right border. For example, you 
may need to make the Sidebar wider so that you can see the page thumbnails at a larger size. 
 To close the Sidebar, click the Close button (the × button) in its upper-right corner. You can 
also close the Sidebar choosing View ➤ Show ➤ Navigation Pane, clearing the Navigation 
Pane check box.  
 Using Find and Replace 
 As you saw in Chapter   3 , Word provides three tools for searching within your documents:  
  Search box on the title bar : This box is good for quickly finding the 
next instance or previous instance of the search term you enter in the 
box. You can also click the pop-up button at the left end to display two 
options: click the List Matches in Sidebar item to open the Sidebar and 
show all matches for the search term, or click the Replace item to open 
the Sidebar ready for replacing items.  
 Tip   To control which levels of headings appear in the Document Map pane, Ctrl-click or right-click 
any heading, and then click the heading level you want, such as Show Heading 3. From the context 
menu, you can also expand the section or collapse it, but usually it’s easier to use the triangles in 
the Document Map pane. 

215
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
  Search pane in the Sidebar : This pane lets you quickly search for text you 
enter in the Search Document box or replace that text with text you enter 
in the Replace With box. What’s less obvious is that you can also search 
for and replace special characters (such as a paragraph mark or a tab 
character) by using the pop-up menu at the end of the Search Document 
box or the Replace With box (as shown on the right in Figure  7-17 ). And 
you can also set four search options—Whole Word Only, Ignore Case, 
Sounds Like, and All Work Forms—by clicking the Action button (the 
button bearing the cog icon) and then clicking the appropriate item on 
the Action pop-up menu (as shown on the left in Figure  7-17 ).  
  Find and Replace dialog box : When you need to access Word’s full Find 
and Replace capabilities, open the Find and Replace dialog box. In this 
section, you’ll look at the extra features this dialog box provides.  
 Figure 7-17.   The Search pane in the Sidebar is good for straightforward searches, but you can also choose search 
options from the Action menu (left) or search for or replace special characters or elements (right) 
 

216
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 You can open the Find and Replace dialog box in either of these ways:
  From the menu bar : Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find and Replace.  
  From the Search pane in the Sidebar : Click the Action button to display 
the Action pop-up menu, and then click Advanced Find & Replace.  
 With the Find and Replace dialog box open, you can search for regular text by using the 
techniques explained in Chapter   3 . But you can also click the down arrow button to display 
the hidden part of the dialog box (see Figure  7-18 ) and then choose other search options as 
described here.  
 Tip  You can work in the document while the Find and Replace dialog box is open—just click in 
the document and edit it as needed, and then click in the dialog box when you want to start using 
it again. This means you can leave the Find and Replace dialog box open until you’ve finished 
searching and making any changes needed to what you find. 
 Figure 7-18.   After expanding the Find and Replace dialog box by clicking the down arrow button (which changes to the 
up arrow button shown here), you can search with wildcards and special characters. You can also search for particular 
formatting or for styles. The area below the Find what box shows the search options you’re using 
 

217
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Highlighting All Instances of a Search Term 
 To make Word  highlight  all the instances it has found, select the “Highlight all items found in” 
check box, and then choose the appropriate item in the pop-up menu. Normally, you want to 
choose Main Document to search in the main part of the document, but you can also search 
in other areas the document contains, such as Headers and Footers, Endnotes, Footnotes, 
or Text Boxes in Main Document.  
 Searching Only Part of the Document 
 When you need to search in just part of the document, select it. You can do this either before 
opening the Find and Replace dialog box or when the dialog box is open. 
 When Word finishes searching the selected part of the document, it asks whether you want 
to search the remainder of the document (see Figure  7-19 ). 
 Changing the Search Direction 
 When you first search, Word searches from the position of the insertion point to the end of 
the document, wraps around automatically to the beginning, and continues until it gets back 
to the insertion point.  
 If you want to search upward rather than downward, open the Search pop-up menu, and 
choose Current Document Up; at the beginning of the document, Word asks if you want to 
continue. To search downward and have Word ask at the end of the document if you want 
to continue, choose Current Document Down. To search through the whole of the document 
without prompting, choose Current Document All.  
 Finding Search Terms That Match the Case You Type 
 Normally, Find ignores the  case of characters  , so it finds the search term no matter what 
capitalization it uses. If you want Find to find only results that match the case you type, 
select the Match case check box.  
 Figure 7-19.   You can search only part of a document rather than the whole document. After searching that part, Word 
prompts you to search the remainder of the document 
 

218
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Restricting the Search to Whole Words 
 If you want to find your search term only as a  whole word  rather than as part of other words, 
select the Find whole words only check box. For example, you may need to find the word 
 any rather than  many or  anywhere . This option works only for single words; as soon as you 
type a space in the Find what box, Word makes this check box unavailable.  
 Using Wildcards to Find Variable Text 
 To give your searches more flexibility, select the Use wildcards check box. A   wildcard is a 
character or group of characters that represents other characters—a bit like your being able 
to use a joker as another card in some games or a blank tile in Scrabble. Table  7-2 explains 
the wildcards you can use for searching in Word. 
 Table 7-2.   Wildcard Characters for Searching in Word 
 Use This Wildcard 
 To Find This Text 
 Example 
 ? 
 Any character 
  r?de finds  rede ,  ride ,  rode , and 
 rude . 
 * 
 Any characters, or none 
  force* finds  force ,  forced , 
 forceps , and  forces . 
 [ characters ] 
 Any one of the characters 
you’ve specified 
 b[aeiou]ll finds  ball ,  bell ,  bill , 
and  bull . 
 [ character1–character2 ] 
 Any one of the characters in 
the alphabetical range you’ve 
entered 
 b[a-j]t finds words such as  bat , 
 bet , and  bit . It does not find  but 
because  u is not in the range. 
 [! character1–character2 ] 
 Any one character that’s not in 
the alphabetical range you’ve 
entered 
 b[!a-jt] finds  bot and  but but 
doesn’t find  bat ,  bet , and  bit . 
 character { number } 
 The number of occurrences of 
the character 
 20{4} find  20000 because it has 
four zeroes. 
 character { number1 ,  number2 } 
 From  number1 instances to 
 number2 instances of the 
character 
 20{1,4} finds  20 ,  200 ,  2000 , 
 20000 , and similar numbers. 
 character@ 
 One or more instances of the 
character 
 0@in finds  10in ,  100in , and other 
text with one or more zeroes 
followed by  in . 
 Finding Words That Sound Like Other Words 
 If you need to find words that  sound like other words  , select the Sounds like check box. 
This feature is worth trying if you work in documents that may have unintentional word 
substitutions (for example, documents entered using speech recognition), but overall it’s too 
hit-and-miss to rely on.  

219
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Finding All Forms of a Word 
 Select the “ Find all word forms  ” check box if you need to find each different form of the 
search text. For example, if you search for  go , Find finds  went and  gone as well.  
 Searching for Special Characters 
 If you need to search for a  character  that you can’t type with the keyboard, such as a 
paragraph mark (the normally hidden character that ends a paragraph) or an em dash (—), 
open the Special pop-up menu (see Figure  7-20 ), and then click the item you want. Word 
enters the appropriate code in the Find what text box, and you can then run the search.  
 Figure 7-20.   Use the Special pop-up menu in the Find and Replace dialog box to enter a special character, such as the 
code for a paragraph mark or a graphic 
 

220
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Searching Only at the Start or End of a Word 
 To make Word search for your search text only at the  start of words  , select the Use wildcards 
check box, open the Special pop-up menu, and click Beginning of Word. (The Special menu’s 
contents change to wildcard options when you select the Use wildcards check box.) For 
example, you can search for  after at the beginning of words to find  afterward and  afternoon . 
 Similarly, you can select the Use wildcards check box and then choose the End of Word item 
on the Special menu to search for your search term only at the end of words, such as finding 
 after in  hereafter or  rafter . 
 Finding Formatting 
 As well as finding text, Word enables you to  find formatting  —either formatting applied to 
particular text or formatting on its own. For example, you can search for instances of the 
word  industry with the Subtle Emphasis style applied to it, or you can search for any text 
formatted with both bold and italic. 
 To search for formatting, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Type your search text in the Find what box like you’ve done before. 
If you want to search for just formatting, delete anything that’s in the 
Find what box.  
 2. 
 Click the Format pop-up menu, and then click the type of formatting 
(see Figure  7-21 ).  

221
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 3. 
 In the dialog box that opens, set up the type of formatting. For 
example, in the Find Style dialog box, click the style name, and then 
click the OK button.  
 Click the No Formatting button when you want to remove the formatting criteria from the 
search.  
 Note   The Highlight item on the Format pop-up menu doesn’t display a dialog box—it just 
switches on searching for Highlight text. Choose Format ➤ Highlight again to search for Not 
Highlight; choose Format ➤ Highlight a third time to remove Highlight from the search. 
 Figure 7-21.   Use the commands on the Format pop-up menu in the Find and Replace dialog box to specify the 
formatting you want to find 
 

222
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Replacing Text, Formatting, and Styles 
 Finding text or formatting is great, but what you often need to do is replace what you’re 
finding with other text, other formatting, or both. To replace items, display the  Replace tab  of 
the Find and Replace dialog box by choosing Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find and Replace and 
then clicking the Replace tab. You can also click the Action button in the Search pane in the 
Sidebar, click Advanced Find & Replace on the pop-up menu, and then click the Replace tab. 
 The Replace tab (shown in Figure  7-22 with settings chosen for replacing direct formatting 
with a style) works in much the same way as the Find tab. For a straightforward replacement, 
type the search text in the Find what box and the replacement text in the Replace with box. 
For a complex replacement, click the More button to display the lower part of the dialog box, 
and then choose the options you want.  
 Figure 7-22.   One of the Replace tool’s most useful tricks is to replace direct formatting with a style 
 

223
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 Once you’ve set up the replacement, use the Replace button, Replace All button, and Find 
Next button to run it:
  Find Next : Click this button to find the next instance of the search term.  
  Replace : Click this button to replace the instance Word has found and to 
find the next instance.  
  Replace All : Click this button to replace every instance. If you’ve chosen 
Current Document Up or Current Document Down rather than Current 
Document All in the Search pop-up menu, Word asks if you want to 
continue when it reaches the beginning or end of the document.  
 Replacing Text 
 To replace text, simply type the replacement in the Replace with box. But you can also make 
Word insert the contents of the Clipboard or the Find what box:  
  Insert the contents of the Clipboard : Open the Special pop-up menu 
and click Clipboard Contents, or simply type  ^c in the Replace with box, 
to make Word insert the contents of the Clipboard in place of whatever 
you’re searching for. You can use this trick to insert a table, an image, or 
a section of text that you’ve copied to the Clipboard.  
  Insert the contents of the Find what box : Open the Special pop-up 
menu and click Find What Text, or simply type  ^ & in the Replace with 
box, to make Word insert the contents of the Find what box (or what the 
contents represents). For example, you can type wildcards in the Find 
what box and then have the Replace with box insert text plus whatever 
expression matched the wildcards.  
 Replacing Formatting or Styles 
 When you need to reformat documents, you can use Replace to replace formatting. You can 
replace formatting in several ways:  
  Replace text and formatting : Sometimes you may need to find given 
text that’s formatted in a particular way and replace it with other 
text formatted differently. (You can also replace it with the same text 
formatted differently.)  
  Replace text with formatting : You can find text that’s formatted in a 
particular way and replace it with formatting, getting rid of the text. 
This approach is useful if you create documents in a text editor (for 
example, on a portable device) and need to apply formatting in Word. 
For example, you can replace the text  h1 with the Heading 1 style.  
  Replace formatting only : You can replace one type of formatting with 
another type, such as replacing bold italic 20-point text with a Heading 
2 style. Or you can replace one style with another style.  

224
CHAPTER 7: Formatting Your Documents Swiftly and Easily
 To replace formatting or styles, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Replace tab of the Find and Replace dialog box. For 
example, choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Advanced Find and Replace, and 
then click the Replace tab.  
 2. 
 In the Find what box, enter any text you want to find. If you’re 
searching for formatting only, delete anything in the Find what box.  
 3. 
 With the insertion point in the Find what box, specify the formatting 
you want to find. Open the Format pop-up menu; click Font, 
Paragraph, Tabs, Language, Frame, or Style; and use the dialog box 
that opens to specify the details. When you click the OK button, the 
Format line under the Find what box shows your choices.  
 4. 
 In the Replace with box, enter any replacement text. To replace only 
with formatting, delete anything in this box.  
 5. 
 With the insertion point in the Replace with box, specify the 
replacement formatting. Use the same techniques as in step 3.  
 6. 
 Run the replacement as usual. For example, click the Replace All 
button to replace all instances of the formatting.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned the best way to format your Word documents—by using 
styles from start to finish and then adding only such little direct formatting as is absolutely 
necessary. You saw how to apply Word’s existing styles, how to create custom styles of your 
own, and how to modify a style either directly or by updating it to match an example. 
 You now also know how to navigate around your documents using the Sidebar and the 
Find feature. And you learned how to find any document item you need, from plain text to 
characters you can’t type—and how to replace it if necessary. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to create complex documents and complex layouts. 
Turn the page when you’re ready to start.

 Chapter 8  
 Creating Complex Documents 
and Layouts 
 Now that you’ve mastered the art of formatting your documents with styles (as explained in 
Chapter   7  ), you’re ready to create long or complex documents in Word. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn first how to use the extra table features that Word provides over 
those that the Office apps share. Then I’ll show you how to break a document into multiple 
sections; how to add headers, footers, and page numbers; and how to create newspaper-
style columns of text. 
 After that, you’ll see how to mark important parts of a document with bookmarks and how to 
insert cross-references back to these bookmarks or to other parts. Finally, you’ll learn how 
to develop your documents using Word’s powerful Outline view and how to add footnotes 
and endnotes to your documents. 
 Working with Word’s Extra Table Features 
 In Word, you can create  tables  in the following three ways:
  Insert a table : As discussed in Chapter   3  , choose Insert ➤ Table from the 
Ribbon, and then click the table arrangement you want on the Insert Table 
grid, such as five rows of three columns each. This is good for creating 
regular tables, ones that have the same number of cells in each row.  
  Draw a table : Also as discussed in Chapter   3  , choose Insert ➤ Table ➤ 
Draw Borders ➤ Draw, and then use the drawing cursor to draw the table 
layout you want. Drawing a table is good for creating irregular tables.  
  Convert existing text to a table : If the document already contains the text 
you want to create the table from, you can convert the text into a table, 
as discussed next.  

226
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Converting Existing Text into a Table 
 Converting  existing text to a table  is usually faster than creating a table and moving existing 
data into it. 
 First, you need to make sure that the material is laid out regularly, with its contents 
separated using one of these four items:
  Tabs : This is usually the easiest way of separating material because you 
can see the different columns that the table will create. Figure  8-1 shows a 
table laid out with tabs. Notice that because the tab stops aren’t optimally 
positioned, the columns don’t align in each row. This doesn’t matter as 
long as there’s only one tab between each item destined for a cell.  
 Note  When converting tabbed material into a table, you must make sure of two things. First, 
check that each item is separated by only one tab, not by two or more tabs; otherwise, you’ll get 
the wrong number of columns. (But if you need to leave a cell blank, do use two tabs in sequence.) 
Second, check that the material for each cell is not broken onto multiple lines; otherwise, you’ll get 
the wrong number of rows. 
 Figure 8-1.   When using tabs to lay out text you plan to turn into a table, use only one tab between the contents of each 
cell. Press Cmd+8 to display the invisible characters including the tabs and paragraph marks 
  Paragraphs : If each cell’s data appears in a separate paragraph, you 
can quickly convert it to a table. Make sure the data contains no 
unnecessary blank paragraphs.  
  Commas : If you have data separated by commas, such as a comma-
separated values exported from a spreadsheet, you can use a comma 
as the separator character for a table.  
  Other character : If your data is separated consistently by another 
character (for example, * or |), you can specify that character as the 
separator character. You need to make sure that this character doesn’t 
appear as part of the regular text, only as the separator character.  
 

227
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 When your data is in good order, convert it to a table like this:
 1. 
 Select the paragraphs of data. Select right from the start up to the 
paragraph mark at the end of the last paragraph. (If Word is hiding 
paragraph marks, you’ll appear to have selected a chunk of blank 
space at the end of the last paragraph.)  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Table ➤ Convert Text to Table from the Ribbon, or 
choose Table ➤ Convert ➤ Convert Text to Table from the menu bar, 
to display the Convert Text to Table dialog box (see Figure  8-2 ). 
 Figure 8-2.   In the Convert Text to Table dialog box, make sure that Word has chosen the right separator character 
(for example, tabs), and choose the AutoFit behavior you want  
 3. 
 In the Separate text at area, make sure that Word has picked the 
right separator character. If not, select the Paragraphs option button, 
the Commas option button, the Tabs option button, or the Other 
option button as appropriate; for the Other option button, type the 
separator character in the text box.  
 4. 
 In the Table Size area, make sure that the number of columns is 
correct:
  If you’re using tabs as the separator character and the number of 
columns is wrong, one or more of the paragraphs contains an extra 
tab (or is missing a tab). Click the Cancel button, find the extra tab 
or missing tab, and then start the conversion again.  
  If you’re using paragraphs as the separator character, you must tell 
Word how many paragraphs to use for each row. Enter this number 
in the Number of columns box.  
 

228
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 5. 
 In the AutoFit Behavior area, choose whether to fit the column widths 
automatically to their contents:
  Initial column width : Select this option button to use a fixed width for 
each column. You can then choose Auto to have Word allocate the 
space equally among the columns or type the fixed width you want.  
  AutoFit to contents : Select this option button to let Word adjust 
each column’s width to fit its contents. You may need to adjust the 
widths afterward.  
  AutoFit to window : Select this option button to have Word make the 
table automatically fit the window’s width.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Convert Text to Table dialog box. 
Word converts the text to a table. Figure  8-3 shows the text from the 
example in Figure  8-1 converted into a table.  
 Figure 8-3.   The table that Word created from the tabbed text in Figure  8-1 
 Converting a Table to Text 
 Word also lets you convert a table back to  text  . This move is useful when you’ve received 
material in table form that you need to convert to a different layout. 
 To convert a table to text, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click anywhere in the table. You don’t need to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Table ➤ Convert ➤ Convert Table to Text from the menu bar 
to display the Convert Table to Text dialog box (see Figure  8-4 ). 
 

229
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 3. 
 In the Separate text with area, choose the character with which to 
separate the cell contents: select the Paragraph marks option button, 
the Tabs option button, the Commas option button, or the Other 
option button (and type the character in the text box).  
 4. 
 Select the Convert nested tables check box if you want to convert 
nested tables as well. (The next section explains nested tables.) This 
check box is available only when you’re using paragraphs as the 
separator character.  
 Note  Word converts a nested table to paragraphs of text like the rest of the table. The nested 
table’s paragraphs appear in their cell order between the paragraphs for the table cells that 
surround them. 
 Figure 8-4.   When converting a table back to text, you can separate the cells with paragraph marks, tabs, commas, or 
another character of your choice 
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Convert Table to Text dialog box and 
perform the conversion.  
 Nesting One Table Inside Another Table 
 When you need to create a complex layout, you can nest one table inside another so that 
one cell of the outer table contains however many cells the inner table has. Figure  8-5 shows 
an example of a nested  table.  
 To nest a table, click in the cell in which you want to nest the table, and then insert the table 
as usual. 
 

230
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Creating Complex Documents with Multiple Sections 
 When you need to create documents that use  multiple layouts  , you have to put each layout 
in a separate section. Here are three examples of documents that use multiple layouts:
  A newsletter may need different numbers of columns on different pages.  
  A report may require different headers and footers for different chapters.  
  A business letter may need to contain an envelope page as well.  
 Word’s sections are highly useful, but they’re tricky both to see and to grasp. Word makes 
matters worse by automatically creating sections when your documents need them—
for example, when you apply columns to part of a document, as discussed later in this 
chapter—but not making clear what it’s doing. 
 Here is the essential information you need to know about sections:
  Each new blank document has a single section at first : When you create 
a new blank document, Word creates it as a single section until you 
add further sections. By contrast, documents you create based on a 
template contain however many sections that template has.  
  When you need to give part of the document a different layout, you 
create a new section : For example, if you need to create a landscape 
page in a document that uses portrait orientation, you put the landscape 
page in a separate section so that you can change the layout.  
 Figure 8-5.   You can nest one table inside another table to create complex layouts 
 Tip   You can nest tables several levels deep if necessary, but the further you nest tables, the more 
confusing working with them tends to become. If you’re considering several levels of nesting, see 
whether merging and splitting cells could give you a similar result with less fuss. 
 

231
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
  A section can start on the same page or on a different page : Word gives 
you four kinds of section breaks.
  Continuous : The new section starts on the same page as 
the previous section. This type of break is useful for creating 
multicolumn layouts on part of a page.  
  Next page : The new section starts on the next page after the 
previous section ends. This is the kind of break you use for putting a 
new chapter on a new page or for changing the layout from portrait 
to landscape.  
  Even page : The new section starts on the next even page after the 
previous section ends. This may mean having a blank page in the 
printed document.  
  Odd page : The new section starts on the new odd page after the 
previous section ends. This too may mean a blank page appears in 
the printed document.  
  A section break divides one section from the next : When you create a 
section (or Word creates one automatically for you), you add a section 
break to the document. A section break is normally hidden, but if you 
display paragraph marks and other invisible characters, it appears as 
a blue double line with the words Section Break and the type in the 
middle, such as Section Break (Continuous).  
 Once you know all this, inserting a section break is easy:
 1. 
 Place the insertion point where you want the new section to start. It’s 
best to put the insertion point at the beginning of a paragraph.  
 2. 
 On the Ribbon, choose Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Breaks to open the 
Breaks panel, and then click the section break type you want: Next 
Page, Continuous, Even Page, or Odd Page. Word inserts the break.  
 To see the break in Print Layout view or Web Layout view, choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ 
Show all nonprinting characters (the button with the pilcrow, the ¶ mark) or press Cmd+8 on 
the keyboard. In Draft view or Outline view, Word displays the break all the time. 
 When you start using sections in a document, Word adds the Section readout to the status 
bar to give you a heads-up on which section you’re working in.  
 Note   If you prefer to use the menus, you can choose Insert ➤ Break from the menu bar to display 
the Break submenu and then click Section Break (Next Page), Section Break (Continuous), Section 
Break (Odd Page), or Section Break (Even Page), as needed. 

232
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Adding Headers, Footers, and Page Numbers 
 If you’re planning to print out a multipage document or to distribute it as a PDF or XPS file, 
it’s often a good idea to add headers, footers, and page numbers to make the pages easy to 
identify. 
 Adding Headers and Footers to a Document 
 A  header appears across the top of a page and a  footer appears across the bottom of a 
page. You can use headers and footers to add information such as the document name and 
file name, author name, date, and page numbers—or any other information that you need to 
make available to the reader. 
 Word gives you plenty of flexibility with  headers and footers  . If a document needs the 
same header (or footer) all the way through, you can quickly add one. But you can also use 
different headers or footers on the odd pages of the document to the even pages, and you 
can use different headers and footers from one section of the document to the next. You can 
also prevent the header or footer from appearing on the first page of a document, which is 
useful for letters and various other documents. 
 Word’s templates come with built-in headers and footers that you can quickly add to give 
your documents a standard look. These headers and footers range from the straightforward 
Blank one to stylish designs that can look good in a variety of documents. Many of the 
headers and footers come with odd-page and even-page versions so that you can create 
effective page spreads. 
 To insert a  built-in  header or footer, follow these steps:
 1. 
 If the document has multiple sections, click in the section where you 
want to add the header or footer.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Header and Footer ➤ Header or Insert ➤ Header 
and Footer ➤ Footer to open the Header panel or the footer panel. 
Figure  8-6 shows the Header panel.  
 Note  If you want to create a header or footer completely from scratch, choose Insert ➤ Header & 
Footer ➤ Header ➤ Edit Header from the Ribbon or View ➤ Header and Footer from the menu bar 
to open the Header area. In Print Layout view, you can also simply double-click in the header area 
at the top of the page. 

233
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 3. 
 Click the header or footer you want. Word then does the following:
  Inserts the header or footer in the document.  
  Switches to Print Layout view if the document is in another view.  
  Displays the header or footer area with the header or footer ready 
for editing. Figure  8-7 shows a header added to a page. The Header 
tab shows that you’re working in the header; if you’re in a particular 
section of the document rather than the document as a whole, the 
tab shows that too.  
  Adds the Header and Footer tab to the Ribbon.  
 Figure 8-6.   Use the Header panel on the Insert tab of the Ribbon to insert the type of header you want 
 

234
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 4. 
 Fill in the  placeholders  in the header or footer. For example,
  If the header or footer shows a [Type here] placeholder, click it, and 
then type the text you want.  
  If the header or footer shows a placeholder for document 
information, such as the [Document Title] placeholder shown, 
choose File ➤ Properties from the menu bar to open the Properties 
dialog box for the document, and then click the Summary tab. Fill 
in the field information (in this example, the Title field) and then click 
the OK button to close the Properties dialog box. The contents of 
the field then appear in the placeholder.  
  If the header or footer includes a Year placeholder, click the pop-up 
button, and then click the date in the panel that opens.  
 5. 
 If necessary, adjust the position or  alignment  of the header:
  To change the header’s position relative to the top of the page, alter 
the value in the Header from Top box in the Position group of the 
Header and Footer tab of the Ribbon. When you do this, you may 
also need to change the page margins. 
 Note When the Word window is too narrow for the labels to fit, the Header from Top box and the 
Footer from Bottom box appear unmarked. You can hold the pointer over the controls in the Position 
group to display tooltips identifying each button.
 Figure 8-7.   Word adds the Header and Footer tab to the Ribbon to give you access to the commands for working with 
the header or footer that you’ve inserted. Below the header in the document, Word displays a button identifying the 
header (here, Odd Page Header) and the Close button 
  To change the footer’s position relative to the bottom of the page, 
alter the value in the Footer from Bottom box in the Position group.  
 

235
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 6. 
 Click the Close button under the header area or above the footer 
area to close the header and footer area and return to the main 
document. You can also choose Header & Footer ➤ Close ➤ Close 
Header and Footer from the Ribbon, press Ctrl+Shift+C, or simply 
double-click in the main text area.  
 Creating Different Headers and Footers for Different Pages 
 Many documents either don’t need a header (or footer) on the first page or need a different 
one there. Likewise, many documents need a  different  header or footer on their odd pages 
than on their even pages. 
 To set up different headers and footers for the first page or for odd and even pages, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Open the header area or footer area in one of these ways:
  In Print Layout view, double-click in the header area or footer area.  
  Choose Insert ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Header ➤ Edit Header or Insert 
➤ Header & Footer ➤ Footer ➤ Edit Footer from the Ribbon.  
  Choose View ➤ Header and Footer from the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click the Header and Footer tab on the Ribbon to display its 
contents.  
 3. 
 To create a different first page header or footer, select the Different 
First Page check box in the Options group on the Header and Footer 
tab of the Ribbon.  
 4. 
 To create different headers and footers for odd pages and even 
pages, select the Different Odd & Even check box in the Options 
group. 
 5. 
 Use the Previous button and Next button in the Navigation group 
on the Header and Footer tab to move from one header or footer to 
another, entering the material you want each to have. If you’re using 
Word’s built-in headers or footers, try the Odd Page and Even Page 
ones for your odd and even pages.  
 Using Different Headers and Footers in Different Sections of a 
Document 
 If you break a document into separate  sections  , you can create different headers and footers 
in each section or continue headers and footers from one section to the next. As well as 
making each section’s headers or footers different from the other sections, you can also create 
different first-page and odd- and even-page headers and footers within sections as needed. 

236
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Create your sections as described earlier in this chapter, and then go to the beginning of the 
document and open the header area or footer area. Give the first section the headers and 
footers it needs, and then go through the remaining sections. 
 Word automatically carries through the headers and footers from one section to the next 
until you tell it to stop. You’ll see the Same as Previous indicator between the Section 
indicator and the Close button for the header or footer, as in Figure  8-8 . 
 Figure 8-8.   Word displays the Same as Previous indicator to show that a header or footer is linked to the previous one. 
Choose Header & Footer  ➤ Navigation ➤ Link to Previous, unpushing the Link to Previous button, to break the link  
 To stop Word from continuing the headers and footers like this, move to the section you 
want to change, and then click the Link to Previous button in the Options group on the 
Header and Footer tab of the Ribbon. (The Link to Previous button appears pushed-in and 
darker when it is selected.) You can then create a different header or footer in this section.  
 Delete a Header or Footer 
 When you want to get rid of a header or footer, open it for editing, press Cmd+A to select all 
its contents, and then press  Delete  . 
 Inserting Page Numbers in a Document 
 To help your readers (or perhaps yourself) keep the pages of a document in the right order, 
it’s often useful to add  page numbers  . The best way to add page numbers in Word is to put 
a page number field in the header or footer. Word then repeats the page number on each 
page, inserting the correct value. 
 Note   If you need to insert in the body of a document a page number that’s in fact a reference to 
another page, insert a cross-reference, as discussed later in this chapter. You can refer either to an 
item such as a heading, table caption, or graphic or to a bookmark that you place exactly where you 
need it. 
 

237
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 To add page numbers to a header or footer, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Page Numbers dialog box (see Figure  8-9 ) in one of 
these ways:
  Ribbon : Choose Insert ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Page Number ➤ Page 
Number. 
  Menu bar : Choose Insert ➤ Page Numbers.  
 Figure 8-9.   In the Page Numbers dialog box, choose the position and alignment for the page numbers. You can also 
choose whether to show the page number on the first page 
 2. 
 In the Position pop-up menu, choose Top of page (Header) or Bottom 
of page (Footer), as needed.  
 3. 
 In the Alignment pop-up menu, choose Left, Center, Right, Inside, 
or Outside. Inside and Outside are for facing-page designs; for 
example, using Inside in a header places the page number at the 
upper-right corner of the left page and the upper-left corner of the 
right page. The Preview box shows you where the page numbers will 
appear.  
 4. 
 Select the “Show number on first page” check box if you want the 
first page to have a number too. To suppress the number on the first 
page, clear this check box.  
 5. 
 If you want to set the formatting for the page numbers, follow these 
steps:
  Click the Format button to display the Page Number Format dialog 
box (see Figure  8-10 ).  
 

238
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Figure 8-10.   Use the Page Number Format dialog box to change the formatting of a page number, such as including a 
chapter number in it 
  Open the Number format pop-up menu, and click the number 
formatting you want, such as 1, 2, 3; A, B, C; or i, ii, iii.  
  If your document has chapters and you want to include the chapter 
number in the page numbering, select the Include chapter number 
check box. Then open the “Chapter starts with style” pop-up menu, 
and click the style that marks the beginning of each chapter, such as 
Heading 1 or a Chapter Title style you’ve added. Last, open the Use 
separator pop-up menu, and choose the separator character to use 
between the chapter number and the page number. Your choices 
are a hyphen, a period, a colon, an em dash (a long dash), or a en 
dash (a short dash but longer than a hyphen).  
  In the Page Numbering area, choose how to control the numbering. 
Click the “Continue from previous section” option button to have the 
page numbers follow those in the previous section. To start again or 
start at a specific number, click the Start at option button, and enter 
the number in the text box.  
  Click the OK button to close the Page Number Format dialog box 
and return to the Page Numbers dialog box.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Page Numbers dialog box. Word 
inserts the page numbers.  
 Note   To remove the page numbers from a document, choose Insert ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Header 
➤ Edit Header or Insert ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Footer ➤ Edit Footer from the Ribbon, or choose 
View ➤ Header and Footer from the menu bar. Select the page number in the header area or footer 
area, and then press the Delete key. 
 

239
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Creating Newspaper-Style Columns of Text 
 If you create newsletters or similar publications, you may want to create  multicolumn 
layouts.  Word can do this well, but there are a couple of tricks you need to learn. 
 To create simple columns, follow these steps:
 1. 
 If you want to turn only part of the document into columns, select 
that part. For example, select existing text, or select a blank 
paragraph at the point where you want to start the columns.  
  2.  Choose Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Columns to open the Columns 
panel, and then click the type of columns you want (see Figure  8-11 ). 
Word turns your selection into columns.  
 Tip   Only Print Layout view shows the columns on-screen, so it’s best to use this view to work 
with columns. 
 Note   If you want to turn the whole document into columns (and the same number of columns 
throughout), click anywhere in the document. 
 Figure 8-11.   From the Columns panel, choose One, Two, or Three columns. Choose Left for a narrow left column and a 
wide right column, and choose Right for wide left and narrow right. Click More Columns for literally more columns or 
for further options 
 

240
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 If you need to create other types of columns than appear on the  Columns panel  , such as 
four columns or columns with a vertical line between them, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the part of the document you want to apply the columns to.  
 2. 
 Choose Format ➤ Columns from the menu bar or choose Layout 
➤ Page Setup ➤ Columns from the Ribbon to display the Columns 
dialog box (see Figure  8-12 ). 
 Figure 8-12.   Use the options in the Columns dialog box to create more complex column layouts in your Word 
documents 
 3. 
 Choose the type of columns you want:
  To use one of the presets in the Presets area, click it.  
  To specify a different number of columns, enter it in the Number of 
columns box. Either type in the number or use the spin button to 
change the current number.  
 4. 
 If you want a vertical line between the columns, select the Line 
between check box.  
 5. 
 Set up the column width and spacing:
  To make each column the same width, select the Equal column 
width check box. On the Col # 1 line of controls, set the width and 
spacing for the columns.  
 

241
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
  To set each column to the width you want, clear the Equal column 
width check box, and then set the width for each column in the 
Width box and the spacing in the Spacing box. If you have four or 
more columns, you’ll need to scroll down to reach the last ones.  
 6. 
 Make sure the Apply to pop-up menu shows the right part of the 
document—the “Selected text item to affect only the selection,” the 
“This section item to affect only the current section,” the “This point 
forward item to affect the rest of the document from here on,” or the 
“Whole document item to affect the whole document” option.  
 7. 
 If you chose the This point forward item, you can select the Start new 
column check box if you want to create a new column layout from 
the current position of the insertion point.  
 8. 
 Click the OK button to close the Columns dialog box. Word creates 
the columns using your choices. Figure  8-13 shows a three-column 
layout with vertical lines between the columns.  
 Figure 8-13.   You can include vertical lines between the columns to make a multicolumn layout easier to read 
 Breaking Your Columns with Column Breaks 
 After you’ve created the columns, Word automatically flows the text down each column as 
you enter it. When the first column reaches the bottom of the text area on the page, Word 
flows it to the start of the second column, and so on. 
 

242
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 To end a column early, you can insert a  column break  . Position the insertion point where you 
want the break, and then choose Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Breaks ➤ Column from the Ribbon. 
Word inserts the column break and moves the insertion point to the top of the next column. 
 Tip  You can also insert a column break by choosing Insert ➤ Break ➤ Column Break from the 
menu bar or pressing Cmd+Shift+Return. 
 If you need to remove a column break, delete it. Choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Show all 
nonprinting characters or press Cmd+8 to display invisible characters so that you can see 
the column break, which appears as a blue line with the words Column Break in the middle. 
Position the insertion point before the column break, and then press Delete to delete it.  
 Removing Multiple Columns from a Section or Document 
 If you want to change a  multiple-column section  or document back to a single column, click 
in the section or document, and then choose Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Columns ➤ One. 
Word restores the text to a single column.  
 Using Bookmarks, Fields, and References 
 In long documents, you often need to mark parts of the document so that you can find them 
easily or refer to them. You may also want to insert pieces of information that Word can 
automatically update for you, such as the date and time or the name of the last person to 
save a document. And you may find it useful to be able to refer easily to another part of the 
document and have Word keep its page number, name, or contents automatically updated. 
 Marking Important Parts of a Document with Bookmarks 
 To identify parts that you want to return to or refer to, you can place  bookmarks  in your Word 
documents. A bookmark is an electronic marker that you can place either at a single point in 
text (between two characters or other objects) or around text or an object. 
 Note   Use a single-point bookmark when you need to move the insertion point to a particular point 
or refer to a page number. Use a bookmark with contents when you need to refer to the specific 
contents; for example, to make a reference automatically display the text that appears in the 
bookmark. 

243
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Insert a Bookmark to Mark Part of a Document 
 To insert a bookmark, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Click the point where you want to place the bookmark, or select the 
text or other object you want the bookmark to contain.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Bookmark from the menu bar to display the 
Bookmark dialog box (see Figure  8-14 ). 
 Figure 8-14.   Create a bookmark when you need to mark a specific point or an area of content in a document 
 3. 
 Type the name for the bookmark in the Bookmark name text box. 
You must start the name with a letter, but after that you can use any 
letters, numbers, and underscores as needed. You can’t use spaces 
or symbols in the name.  
 4. 
 Click the Add button. Word adds the bookmark and closes the 
dialog box.  
 Note   If you need to move a bookmark to a different point in a document, position the insertion 
point or select the new location. Then open the Bookmark dialog box, click the bookmark name, and 
click the Add button. Word changes the bookmark to the new location without comment.

CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Navigating from Bookmark to Bookmark 
 After placing a bookmark, you can move the insertion point to the bookmark. Follow these 
steps: 
 1. 
 Choose Insert Bookmark to display the Bookmark dialog box.  
 2. 
 In the Bookmark name list box, click the bookmark.  
 3. 
 Click the Go To button. If the bookmark is a single point, Word 
moves the insertion point to it; if the bookmark has contents, Word 
selects them.  
 4. 
 Click the Close button to close the Bookmark dialog box.  
 Seeing Where Bookmarks Are in Your Documents 
 Word hides the bookmarks in your documents unless you set it to display them. When 
you’re editing a document, it’s often useful to display the bookmarks to avoid deleting them 
by accident. You may also need to display the bookmarks to make sure they’re in the right 
place.  
 To display bookmarks, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key) 
to display the Word Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the Authoring and Proofing Tools section, click the View icon to 
display the View preferences pane.  
 3. 
 In the Show in Document area, select the Bookmarks check box.  
 4. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 For a single-point bookmark, Word displays a black I-beam in the document. For a 
bookmark that contains text or another object, Word displays brackets around the contents. 
Figure  8-15 shows a single-point bookmark in the first paragraph and a bookmark with 
content in the second paragraph.  
 Figure 8-15.   Word displays a black I-beam for a single-point bookmark marker and a pair of black brackets around the 
text or object in a bookmark that has contents 
 

245
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Deleting a Bookmark You No Longer Need 
 When you no longer need a bookmark, delete it like this:  
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Bookmark to display the Bookmark dialog box.  
 2. 
 In the Bookmark name list box, click the bookmark.  
 3. 
 Click the Delete button.  
 4. 
 Click the Close button to close the Bookmark dialog box.  
 Inserting Automated Information with Fields 
 Many documents need automated items of information that Word can provide for you, such 
as the date or time, page numbers (discussed earlier in this chapter), or the file name. To add 
such information to your documents, you use fields, which are codes that tell Word to insert 
the information you want and whether to update it automatically. 
 Inserting a Field 
 To insert a field in a document, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Field from the menu bar to display the Field dialog box 
(shown in Figure  8-16 with the Date and Time category selected in the 
Categories list box and the SaveDate field selected in the Field names list box).  
 Figure 8-16.   The Field dialog box includes a wide range of fields. Normally, you start by choosing the type of fields in 
the Categories list box 
 

246
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 2. 
 In the Categories list box, choose the category of fields you want 
(see the following list). This example uses the Date and Time 
category:
  (All) : Lists all the fields. This is useful when you know the field’s 
name but not the category that contains it.  
  Date and Time : Contains fields for entering dates and times, such as 
the current date or the time the document was last saved, in various 
formats. You can also insert a date, time, or both more easily by 
choosing Insert Date & Time from the menu bar and using the Date 
and Time dialog box.  
  Document Automation : Contains fields for automating movement 
around the document, running macros, printing, and similar actions.  
  Document Information : Contains fields for inserting information 
contained in the document’s properties, such as the author name or 
file name.  
  Equations and Formulas : Contains fields for inserting equations and 
formulas. Use them when the Insert ➤ Symbols ➤ Equation panel 
on the Ribbon doesn’t contain what you need.  
  Index and Tables : Contains fields for creating indexes and content 
tables (such as tables of contents and tables of figures). The 
References tab of the Ribbon contains controls for inserting these 
fields more easily.  
  Links and References : Contains fields for inserting links (such as 
hyperlinks) or cross-references. The Insert ➤ Hyperlink, Insert ➤ 
Bookmark, and Insert ➤ Cross-reference commands on the menu 
bar provide easier access to these fields.  
  Mail Merge : Contains fields for creating mail-merge documents. 
Usually it’s easier to work on the Mailings tab of the Ribbon, as 
discussed in Chapter   9 . 
  Numbering : Contains fields for inserting automatic numbering in 
a document. For creating page numbers, it’s easier to work in the 
header or footer, as described earlier in this chapter.  
  User Information : Contains fields for inserting the user’s name, 
initials, or address.  
 3. 
 In the Field names list box, click the field you want. In the example, 
I’ve clicked the SaveDate field, which inserts the date the document 
was last saved. The Field codes area shows the code format for the 
field, and the text box underneath it shows the current version of the 
field—at the moment, just SAVEDATE.  
 4. 
 Select the “Preserve formatting during updates” check box if you 
want to keep the field’s formatting when you update it. This behavior 
is normally useful.  

247
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 5. 
 You can insert the field at this point if you want, but you may prefer to 
choose options for the field first. To choose options, follow these steps:
  Click the Options button to display the Field Options dialog box (see 
Figure  8-17 ). The contents of this dialog box vary depending on the 
field: some fields have many options, while others have few or none.  
 Figure 8-17.   Most fields have options that you can set by using the Field Options dialog box 
  Click the option you want, and then click the Add to Field button. 
For example, in the Field Options dialog box for the SaveDate field, 
click the format you want in the Date-time formats list box, and then 
click the Add to Field button. Word adds the option’s code to the 
Field codes text box.  
  Click the OK button to close the Field Options dialog box and return 
to the Field dialog box.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Field dialog box and insert the field.  
 Examining and Updating a Field 
 Now that you’ve inserted a field, you can examine it. At first, the field displays the field 
results—the information that the field produces. For example, the SaveDate field displays a 
date in the format you chose.  
 Normally, the field result appears like normal text until you click in it or select it, at which 
point Word displays gray shading behind it to indicate that it’s a field (see Figure  8-18 ). To 
update the field, Ctrl-click or right-click it, and then click Update Field on the context menu.  
 

248
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 If you want to see the field code that’s producing the field result, Ctrl-click or right-click 
anywhere in the field, and then click Toggle Field Codes on the context menu. Word displays 
the field code, as shown in Figure  8-19 . You can edit the field code directly if you know which 
changes you want to make, but generally it’s easier to use the Field Options dialog box.  
 Figure 8-19.   If you want to see the code that produces a field result, Ctrl-click or right-click in the field, and then click 
Toggle Field Codes on the context menu. Repeat this move to show the field result again 
 Note  If you want to see field shading all the time, choose Word ➤ Preferences to display the Word 
Preferences window. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools area, click the View icon to display the 
View preferences pane. In the Show in Document area, open the Field shading pop-up menu, and 
choose Always. You can also select the “Field codes instead of values” check box (also in the Show 
in Document area if you want to display field codes all the time. Close the Preferences window by 
clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 Figure 8-18.   When you click a field result, Word displays gray shading to indicate that it is a field 
 Adding Cross-References to Other Parts of a Document 
 When you create formal documents, you often need to refer from one part to another. To 
do so, you can create cross-references to any of several different types of items, including 
headings, bookmarks, figures, and tables.  
 To insert a cross-reference, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Position the insertion point where you want the reference.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Cross-reference from the menu bar to display 
the  Cross-reference  dialog box (shown in Figure  8-20 with settings 
chosen for referring to a bookmark).  
 
 

249
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 3. 
 Open the Reference type pop-up menu and choose the type of item 
you want to refer to:
  Numbered item : An item to which you have applied Word’s 
automatic numbering, such as a paragraph in a numbered list.  
  Heading : A paragraph you have formatted with one of Word’s 
Heading styles.  
  Bookmark : A bookmark you have inserted in the document 
(as described earlier in this chapter).  
  Footnote : A footnote you have created in the document, as 
discussed later in this chapter.  
  Endnote : An endnote you have created in the document, as 
discussed later in this chapter.  
  Equation : An equation you have inserted by choosing Insert ➤ 
Symbols ➤ Equation from the Ribbon or Insert ➤ Equation from the 
menu bar, or as a field.  
  Figure : A figure that you have marked with an automatically 
numbered caption using the Insert ➤ Caption command.  
  Table : A table that you have marked with an automatically numbered 
caption using the Insert ➤ Caption command.  
 Figure 8-20.   In the Cross-reference dialog box, you can insert a cross-reference to a bookmark, heading, table, or other 
item in the document 
 

250
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 4. 
 In the For which list box, click the item you want to refer to. 
(The name of this list box changes to reflect the type of item you’ve 
selected—for example, it’s the For which numbered item list box 
when you select Numbered item or the For which caption list box 
when you select Table.)  
 5. 
 Open the Insert reference to pop-up menu, and choose the item you 
want to refer to. The options vary depending on the object you’re 
referring to, but these are the options for a bookmark to give you an idea:
  Bookmark text : Inserts the bookmark’s contents (whatever that 
may be). Use this for bookmarks that have contents rather than for 
single-point bookmarks.  
  Page number : Inserts the page number on which the first part of the 
bookmark appears.  
  Paragraph number : Inserts the paragraph number in which the start 
of the bookmark appears. Use this only with numbered paragraphs.  
  Paragraph number (no context) : Inserts the numbering for the 
paragraph in which the start of the bookmark appears, without any 
other numbering involved in the multilevel list. For example, if you 
have a three-level list and the bookmark appears in paragraph 2. a. 
(ii), this choice inserts the (ii) part without the rest of the numbering.  
  Paragraph number (full context) : Inserts the numbering for the 
paragraph in which the start of the bookmark appears, including the 
full number; for example, 2. a. (ii).  
  Above/below : Inserts “above” if the start of the bookmark appears 
earlier in the document than the reference or “below” if it appears 
later in the document. This is occasionally useful, but see the next 
paragraph for a better alternative.  
 6. 
 If you choose a page number or paragraph number in the Insert 
reference to pop-up menu, you can select the Include above/below 
check box if you want to add “above” or “below” to the end of the 
reference to indicate whether the item falls before or after the reference.  
 7. 
 Select the Insert as hyperlink check box if you want the reference to 
appear as a hyperlink. The reader can click the hyperlink to jump to 
the referenced item.  
 8. 
 Click the Insert button to insert the reference in the document. The 
Cancel button changes to a Close button.  
 9. 
 Click the Close button to close the Cross-reference dialog box.  
 Note   A cross-reference is a field code, so you can update it by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking in the 
field and then clicking Update Field on the context menu. 

251
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Creating Long Documents with Outline View 
 To plan, structure, and rearrange long documents, use  Outline view  . You met Outline view 
briefly in Chapter   6 when you looked at each of Word’s main views in turn. In this section, 
you’ll learn how Word handles outlines, how to create the outline of a document, and how to 
use Outline view to edit and rearrange a document quickly and easily. 
 How Outlines Work 
 Word creates outlines by assigning different outline levels to the paragraphs of a document. 
There are nine outline levels, with Level 1 being the highest and Level 9 the lowest. Below 
these is the body text level, which prevents a paragraph from appearing in the outline of the 
document.  
 Word’s nine heading styles automatically map to the outline levels—Heading 1 to Level 1, 
Heading 2 to Level 2, and all the way down to Heading 9 mapping to Level 9. But you can 
also set the outline level of any style to the level you want, which allows you to make other 
styles appear in the outline as needed. For example, if you want your figure captions to 
appear at the fifth level of the outline, you can change the Caption style so that it has the 
Level 5 outline level. 
 Developing the Outline of a Document 
 To develop the outline of a document, you work in Outline view. You can either start off in 
Outline view and work in it to structure your document at first, or you can switch to Outline 
view at any point when you need to work on the outline or get an overview of the structure of 
the document.   
 Note   You can also set the outline level of an individual paragraph if you want, without assigning 
that paragraph a style that has an outline level. Promoting a paragraph manually like this can be 
useful sometimes, but using styles gives you greater consistency in your documents. 
 Tip  When you’re working intensively on a document, it’s often useful to open a second window on 
the document and keep that window in Outline view. If you prefer to work in a single window, you 
can either switch views or split the window into two panes and then use Outline view in one pane. 
To open a second window, choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ New Window from the Ribbon or Window ➤ 
New Window from the menu bar. To split a window in half, choose View ➤ Arrange ➤ Split from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ Split from the menu bar. 

252
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Switching to Outline View 
 You can switch to Outline view in any of these ways:  
  Pointing device : Click the Outline View button on the right side of the 
status bar.  
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Option+O.  
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Outline.  
 When you switch to Outline view, Word automatically displays the Outlining tab of the 
Ribbon. You use the controls in the Outline Tools group (shown labeled in Figure  8-21 ) to 
create the outline and display the parts of it you want to see.  
 Figure 8-21.   Use the controls on the Outlining tab of the Ribbon to develop your outline. Word displays the Outlining tab 
when you switch to Outline view  
 Creating Headings in Outline View 
 When you switch a document to Outline view, Word displays the document’s headings 
(or more correctly, its outline levels). When you press Return at the end of a heading 
paragraph in Outline view, Word continues the heading style to the next paragraph rather 
than applying whichever style that paragraph’s style specifies for the following paragraph. 
So when you type a heading, pressing Return creates another paragraph at the same 
level in the outline. This enables you to create multiple headings quickly without needing 
to apply a heading style as you would need to do in another view.  
 Note   If you create a new blank document and switch it straight to Outline view, Word 
automatically applies Heading 1 style to the first paragraph. You can then start creating your outline 
immediately. 
 

253
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Promoting and Demoting Headings 
 You can quickly  promote or demote headings  by using the buttons in the Outline 
Tools group:
  To move the current paragraph down to the next heading level, click the 
Demote button.  
  To change a paragraph to body text, click the Demote to Body Text 
button. 
  To move the current paragraph up to the next heading level, click the 
Promote button.  
  To promote the current paragraph to Heading 1, click the Promote to 
Heading 1 button.  
 Tip   From the keyboard, press Tab to demote the current paragraph or Shift+Tab to promote it. 
You can also select a section and then drag it to the left to promote it or to the left to demote it, but 
doing so sometimes requires a steady touch. 
 Expanding and Collapsing the Outline and Headings 
 One of Outline view’s strongest features is that you can  expand  the outline to different levels 
so that you can see exactly what you need to see. Figure  8-22 shows a section of outline 
with three levels of heading displayed and some sections expanded.  

254
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Figure 8-22.   You can expand an outline to different levels so that you can see exactly what you need 
 To choose the overall level of outline levels displayed, open the Show Level pop-up menu, 
and then click the level you want. Your choices are from Level 1 to Level 9, or All Levels if 
you want to display every paragraph. For much of your work in Outline view, you’ll likely 
want to show several levels of headings, such as Levels 1, 2, and 3. 
 Once you’ve chosen the outline level, you can double-click the + sign next to a heading to 
display or hide the headings and other contents below it. A - sign next to a heading indicates 
that it has no lower-level headings or body text below it, as is the case with the “Activity and 
Exercise Goals” heading in Chapter   3 . 
 The dotted underline that appears under some headings indicates that the heading has 
collapsed subheadings under it. The underline starts at the indentation level of the first 
subheading so you can see which level this is at. For example, the Chapter   4 heading has 
an underline that starts at the first level of indentation, indicating that the first subheading is 
a Heading 3-level or Outline 3-level item (the next level below the Chapter heading, which is 
Heading 2-level). 
 

255
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 If you want to expand or collapse multiple sections at once, select the sections, and then 
click the Expand button or the Collapse button. 
 When you display all of the text of the document, you may find you lose many of the 
advantages of Outline view. But you can select the Show First Line Only check box in the 
Outline Tools group on the Home tab to make Word display only the first line of each 
paragraph (ending with an ellipsis to show that the rest is hidden). This feature lets you 
follow the gist of the paragraphs in the document without displaying the full text. 
 Moving Paragraphs Up and Down the Document 
 When you have displayed the outline level you want, you can quickly  move paragraphs up 
and down  the outline. 
 Click a + sign to select that item and all its subordinate items, or click and drag in the 
selection bar to select multiple items. You can then move them up or down the outline in 
these ways:
  Ribbon : Click the Move Up button or the Move Down button in the 
Outline Tools group on the Outlining tab to move the selection up or 
down by one displayed paragraph at a time.  
  Keyboard : Press Ctrl+Shift+Up arrow or Ctrl+Shift+Down arrow to move 
the selection up or down by one displayed paragraph at a time.  
  Pointing device : Drag the selection up or down as far as necessary. 
Word displays a line between paragraphs to indicate where the selection 
will land when you drop it.  
 Switching from Outline View to Another View 
 When you’ve finished working on the outline, choose Outlining ➤ Close ➤ Close Outline 
View from the Ribbon to return to the view you were using before. 
 Tip  If you want to zero in on the text of your outline without distractions, clear the Show Text 
Formatting check box in the Outline Tools group on the Outlining tab of the Ribbon. Clearing this 
check box makes Word show all the text in a standard font that lets you see more of the outline at 
once. Select this check box when you want to see the formatting again. 
 Tip  Select the Show First Line Only check box when you need to change the order of paragraphs 
within a long section. 

256
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 You can also  switch  to another view by clicking the appropriate View button on the right side 
of the status bar or by opening the View menu and clicking the view you want. 
 Adding Footnotes and Endnotes 
 If you create professional or academic documents, you may need to add footnotes or 
 endnotes  to provide extra information or show your sources. A  footnote is a note that 
appears at the foot of the page that refers to it, while an  endnote is a note that appears at 
the end of a section or document. Use footnotes when it’s likely the reader will want to read 
the information and the chunks of information are short enough to fit at the bottom of pages. 
Use  endnotes  for information that you think only a few readers will need to consult or for 
longer pieces of information. 
 Adding a Footnote 
 To add a footnote to a document, follow these steps:   
 1. 
 Place the insertion point immediately after the last word of the text 
you want the footnote to refer to.  
  2.  Choose References ➤ Footnotes ➤ Insert Footnote to insert a 
superscript footnote number or mark and open the footnote area.
  In Print Layout view, Word shows the footnote area at the bottom 
of the page, separated by a horizontal line, as shown in the upper 
part of Figure  8-23 . The footnote area shows only the footnotes that 
appear on that page.  
 Tip  If you need to create very long documents, look into Word’s Master Document feature, which 
you access by choosing Outlining ➤ Master Document ➤ Show Document from the Ribbon or 
View ➤ Master Document from the menu bar. This feature, which is beyond the scope of this book, 
enables you to create a kind of super-document that consists of multiple subdocuments. You can 
work with the master document in Master Document view, which is similar to Outline view. 
 Tip   You can convert footnotes to endnotes, or endnotes to footnotes, if necessary. So, it’s not a 
disaster if you start with one type of note and then realize you need the other type. 
 Note   You can also insert a footnote or endnote using the Footnote or Endnote dialog box, which 
you’ll meet later in this chapter. Normally, you use the Footnote or Endnote dialog box to insert a 
footnote (or endnote) only when you need choose specific settings for the note, such as changing 
the numbering. 

257
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
  In Draft view, Outline view, or Web Layout view, Word shows the 
footnote area as a separate pane, as shown in the lower part of 
Figure  8-23 . The footnote pane shows a list of all the footnotes in 
the document.  
 Figure 8-23.   In Print Layout view, the footnote area appears at the bottom of the page (above). In other views, the 
footnote area appears as a separate pane (below) 
 3. 
 Add the text or other material for the footnote by typing it in or 
pasting it.  
 4. 
 Click in the main text of the document again to resume work in it. 
You can either leave the footnote pane open so that you can work 
with other footnotes in it or close it in one of these ways:
  Drag the bar that separates the pane from the main window down to 
the bottom of the window.  
  Press Ctrl+Shift+C.  
 

258
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 Adding an Endnote 
 To add an endnote to a  document  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Place the insertion point immediately after the last word of the text 
you want the footnote to refer to.  
 2. 
 Choose References ➤ Footnotes ➤ Insert Endnote from the Ribbon 
to insert a superscript endnote number or mark and open the 
endnote area.
  In Print Layout view or Web Layout view, Word shows the endnote 
area on the last page of the document or section, separated by a 
horizontal line, as shown in the upper part of Figure  8-24 . 
  In Draft view or Outline view, Word shows the endnote area as 
a separate pane, as shown in the lower part of Figure  8-24 . The 
endnote pane shows a list of all the endnotes in the document.  
 Figure 8-24.   In Print Layout view and Web Layout view, the endnote area appears at the bottom of the final page of the 
document or section (above). In Draft view and Outline view, the endnote area appears as a separate pane (below) 
 

259
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 3. 
 Type or paste in the text or other material for the endnote.  
 4. 
 Click in the main text of the document again to resume work in it. 
In Draft view or Outline view, you can either leave the endnote pane 
open for further use or close it in one of these ways:
  Drag the bar that separates the pane from the main window down 
to the bottom of the window.  
  Press Cmd+Shift+C.  
 Customizing Footnotes and Endnotes to Suit Your Document 
 Word automatically numbers footnotes and  endnotes  and inserts them using its default 
placement: footnotes at the foot of the page and endnotes at the end of the document. The 
 default settings  work well for many documents, but for others, you may want to change the 
numbering or the placement. To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click in the section of the document for which you want to change 
the footnotes or endnotes. (If the document has only a single section, 
click anywhere in it.)  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Footnote from the menu bar to display the Footnote 
and Endnote dialog box (see Figure  8-25 ). 
 Figure 8-25.   Open the Footnote and Endnote dialog box when you need to choose the numbering or symbols for 
footnotes or endnotes, change the position or numbering, or convert footnotes to endnotes or endnotes to footnotes 
 

260
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 3. 
 In the Location area, select the Footnotes option button or the 
Endnotes option to tell Word which type of notes you want to affect.  
 4. 
 Choose where to place the notes in the document:
  Footnotes : In the Footnotes pop-up menu, choose Bottom of page 
(the default) or Below text (which gives an odd look but helps make 
the footnotes more obvious to the reader).  
  Endnotes : In the Endnotes pop-up menu, choose End of document 
(the default setting) or End of section.  
 5. 
 In the Format area, choose the numbering you want for the notes 
whose option button you’ve selected:
  Number format : In this pop-up menu, click the numbering format to 
use: 1, 2, 3; a, b, c; A, B, C; i, ii, iii; I, II, III; or a series of symbols.  
  Custom mark : To use a custom note mark, click the Symbol button. 
In the Symbol dialog box, click the symbol you want, and then click 
the OK button. The symbol appears in the Custom Mark box; delete 
it if you want to return to regular numbering.  
  Start at : In this box, enter the starting number to use for numbering. The 
default is the first character of the number format, such as 1, i, or A.  
  Numbering : In this pop-up menu, choose Continuous if you want 
to use the numbering sequence throughout the document. Choose 
Restart each section to start afresh with each section (this is useful 
for a document with endnotes at the end of each chapter). Choose 
Restart each page if you want to restart footnote numbering on each 
page (you can’t use this option for endnotes because it wouldn’t 
make sense).  
 6. 
 Click the Apply button to apply your choices.  
 7. 
 Click the Close button to close the Footnote and Endnote dialog box.  
 Converting Footnotes to Endnotes or Endnotes to Footnotes 
 To  convert  footnotes to endnotes, endnotes to footnotes, or each kind of note to the other at 
the same time, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Footnote to display the Footnote and Endnote 
dialog box.  
 Note   To insert a footnote or endnote using the Footnote and Endnote dialog box, select the 
Footnotes option button or the Endnotes option button (as appropriate), choose any other options 
needed, and then click the Insert button.

 2. 
 Click the Convert button to display the Convert Notes dialog box 
(see Figure  8-26 ).  
 Figure 8-26.   Use the Convert Notes dialog box to convert footnotes to endnotes, convert endnotes to footnotes, or 
switch each kind of note to the other  
 Caution  Before converting the footnotes or endnotes in a long or complex document that contains 
many notes, create a fresh backup of the document. The conversion seldom goes wrong, but when 
it does, the notes can become severely scrambled. 
 3. 
 Click the Convert all footnotes to endnotes option button, the 
Convert all endnotes to footnotes option button, or the Swap 
footnotes and endnotes option button, as needed.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Convert Notes dialog box and 
perform the conversion.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Footnote and Endnote dialog box.  
 Navigating Among and Viewing Footnotes or Endnotes 
 You can  navigate  from one footnote or endnote to another by using the Go To tab of the Find 
and Replace dialog box. Click the Pages readout in the status bar to display the Go To tab 
of the Find and Replace dialog box. In the Go to what list box, click the Footnote item or the 
Endnote item, as needed. You can then move between footnotes or endnotes by clicking the 
Next button or the Previous button on the Go To tab. 
 Once you’ve located a footnote mark or endnote mark, you can preview the footnote or 
endnote by holding the pointer over the footnote mark or endnote mark until Word displays a 
tooltip containing the text of the footnote or endnote (see Figure  8-27 ). 
 

262
CHAPTER 8: Creating Complex Documents and Layouts
 If the note is short and text only, this may be all you need to do. But if the note is longer 
or contains other types of contents (such as graphics, tables, or charts), double-click the 
footnote mark or endnote mark to display the footnote area or endnote area and jump 
directly to the note whose mark you double-clicked. 
 You can then move from note to note in the footnote area or endnote area. As you move the 
insertion point to another note, Word displays the corresponding part in the main document. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to create complex documents and complex layouts. 
You now know how to convert existing text in a Word document into a table; how to add 
headers, footers, and page numbers to a document; and how to create a multicolumn, 
newsletter-style layout. 
 You also saw how to insert bookmarks to enable yourself to easily access and refer to 
parts of a document and how to insert cross-references to bookmarks or other document 
elements. And you learned to develop a document’s outline swiftly and easily in Outline view, 
plus techniques for adding footnotes and endnotes to your documents. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to create business documents and perform mail merge.  
 Note   You can also display the footnote or endnote area by choosing View ➤ Footnotes. If Word 
displays the View Footnotes dialog box, click the View footnote area option button or the View 
endnote area option button as appropriate, and then click the OK button. (If the document contains 
only one kind of note, Word displays the area for that kind of note without opening the View 
Footnotes dialog box.)

 Chapter 9  
 Creating Business Documents 
with Mail Merge 
 In this chapter, you will learn how to use Word’s powerful mail merge feature to create 
business documents such as form letters, catalogs, mailing labels, and envelopes. Each of 
these types of documents is built around a common core, the main document, into which 
you merge variable data contained in records in a list, or data source, such as an Excel 
workbook or an address book. 
 Mail merge may initially seem daunting, but it’s a great way of saving time and effort—so if 
you can invest some time learning how mail merge works, you’ll soon reap the rewards. 
 I’ll start by running through how mail merge works and the six separate steps Word uses to 
set up and execute  mail merges  . I’ll then go through each step in turn so that you can get 
comfortable creating mail merge documents. Lastly, I’ll show you how to turn a mail merge 
main document back into a regular Word document. 
 Understanding How Mail Merge Works 
 Mail merge works by using a standard document that contains data that remains constant 
and a list or data source that contains the records to be merged into the document.  
  Main document : This is the document that contains the body of the 
merge documents you’re creating. For example, when you use mail 
merge to create form letters, the main document is a letter that contains 
your address, the text that remains constant for each recipient, and 
fields into which the variable information (such as the recipient’s name 
and address) is entered.  

264
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
  List : This is the file that contains the records or data that the merge 
places in the main document to create each merge document. For 
example, when you’re creating a form letter, the list will contain each 
recipient’s name and address, nickname or preferred greeting, and other 
items of information such as the product or query about which you’re 
contacting the recipient. Each record consists of one or more  fields , 
discrete items of information. For example, when you create a customer 
record, you usually have separate fields for the last name, first name, 
middle initial, e-mail address, all the separate components of the 
physical address, and so on.  
 Word treats mail merge as a six-step process, during which it provides helpful prompts:
  Step One: Select Document Type. In this step, you choose the type of 
mail-merge document you want to create and create that document.  
  Step Two: Select Recipients List. In this step, you choose the recipients 
list to use for the mail merge, such as a Word document containing a 
table or an Excel workbook.  
  Step Three: Insert Merge Fields. In this step, you insert merge fields in 
the main document to mark the places where the merge will insert fields 
of information. For example, you insert the Last Name field where you 
want the recipient’s last name to go.  
  Step Four: Filter Recipients. In this step, you choose whether to merge 
all the records in the list or only some of them.  
  Step Five: Preview Results. In this step, you preview how your merged 
documents will look so that you can make any changes needed before 
you proceed.  
 Tip   When you’re creating a list, break up your records using a field for each item of data you may 
want to use separately. For example, instead of having a single field containing the street address, 
you may find it better to create a field for the street name and a separate field for the house 
number. This separation enables you to use the street name separately from the house number, 
which can be useful (for instance, if you need to identify all your customers in a particular street). 
 Note   In mail merge, the main document is always a Word document. The list can also be a Word 
document that contains a table with the records for the mail merge, but it is more often a database-
like file: an Excel workbook containing a table of records, your OS X Contacts file or Outlook’s 
Contacts, or a query on a “real” database in an app such as FileMaker Pro. 

265
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
  Step Six: Complete Merge. In this step, you perform the merge, 
producing one of three end results: a document containing mail-merge 
letters (or labels or whatever) that you can use like any other document; 
multiple documents that Word sends directly to your printer; or e-mail 
messages.  
 In the rest of this chapter, you’ll look at each step in turn.  
 Creating the Main Document for the Mail Merge 
 The first step in mail merge is to tell Word what kind of mail merge documents you want to 
create—form letters, e-mail messages, labels, envelopes, or a catalog-like list—and create 
a suitable main document. You can either create a new document from scratch or open an 
existing document.   
 To choose the merge document type and create the main document, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the existing document you want to use or create a new 
document:
  Open an existing document : Click the File button on the title bar to 
display the Microsoft Word dialog box. Click the Recent tab for a 
recent document or the Open tab for any document. Navigate to 
and select the document, and then click the Open button. 
  Create a new document : Click the File button on the title bar, or 
choose File ➤ New from Template, to display the Word Document 
Gallery dialog box. Click the template on which to base the 
document, and then click the Create button. Click the Save button 
on the title bar (or press Cmd+S), specify the document name and 
folder in the Save As sheet, and then click the Save button.  
 2. 
 Click the Mailings tab on the Ribbon to display its controls. Figure  9-1  
shows the Mailings tab with the Start Mail Merge panel open.  
 Tip When creating form letters, you can often save time either by reusing an existing letter or 
by basing the main document on a letter template that has the sender address, recipient address, 
salutation, and so on, in suitable places. Similarly, if you already have the framework for a catalog-
style list, you can reuse that. You can also reuse an existing document when creating envelopes or 
labels, but these are easy to create quickly from scratch using the Mailing tools.

266
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 3. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Start Mail Merge to display 
the Start Mail Merge panel, and then click the item you want to create:
  Letters : Click this item to create merged letters. This is the type of 
document I’ll use in the examples. The documents don’t have to 
be letters as such; you can create anything from party invitations to 
personalized storybooks.  
  E-mail Messages : Click this item to create e-mail messages ready to 
send in Outlook.  
  Envelopes : Click this item to create envelopes for printing on a 
printer. In the Envelope dialog box that Word displays, you then 
choose the size and shape of envelope you will use.  
  Labels : Click this item to create labels such as mailing labels for 
printing on a printer. In the Label Options dialog box that Word 
displays, you can choose from a wide variety of types of mailing 
labels.  
  List : Click this item to create a list containing mail merge data. For 
example, if you have a data-source list with records that contain 
details of machine parts, you can pull those records into a list to 
make them easily readable.  
 Once you’ve specified the document type, Word displays a prompt on the Information bar 
between the Ribbon and the document. Figure  9-2 shows an example. Click the X button at 
the left end of the Information bar if you don’t want to see these prompts.  
 Figure 9-2.   Word displays a prompt on the Information bar to let you know what to do next. You can click the X button 
at the left end of the Information bar to suppress the prompts  
 Figure 9-1.   The Mailings tab of the Ribbon contains controls for creating and running a mail merge 
 
 

267
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Selecting the Recipients for the Mail Merge 
 Once you’ve created the main document, the next step in the mail merge is to tell Word 
which list to use. To do so, choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Select Recipients to 
display the Select Recipients panel (see Figure  9-3 ), and then click the appropriate item:  
  Create a New List : Click this item to create a new list in Word.  
  Use an Existing List : Click this item to open an existing list in a Word 
document.  
  Choose from Outlook Contacts : Click this item to use data from your 
Outlook Contacts list.  
  Apple Contacts : Click this item to use data from your OS X Contacts list.  
  FileMaker Pro : Click this item to use data from a FileMaker Pro 
database.  
 How you use each of these list types varies, so I’ll show each in a separate section. 
 Creating a New List in Word 
 The first option that Mail Merge offers you is to create a new list in Word. Word creates a list 
by inserting a table in a document and then storing the list items in the rows of the table.  
 Caution  Creating a list in Word does work, but you should almost never do it. In many cases, 
you’ll have the information you need in a more easily accessible format, such as a worksheet in an 
Excel workbook, your Outlook Contacts list, or your OS X Contacts list. And even if you don’t have the 
information in such a format, it’s better to put it in a spreadsheet, contacts list, or database because 
you’ll be able to keep it updated and reuse it more easily there than if you create a list in Word. 
 Figure 9-3.   Choose your data source in the Select Recipients panel 
 

268
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 If you decide to create a list in Word (see the nearby Caution), follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Select Recipients from the 
Ribbon, and then click Create a New List on the Select Recipients 
panel. The Edit List Fields dialog box opens (see Figure  9-4 ). This 
dialog box contains a list of standard fields for form letters, labels, and 
envelopes: Title, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Company, and so on.  
 2. 
 Customize the list of fields as needed:
  Add a field : Type the name in the New field name text box, and then 
click the Add (+) button. Word adds the field to the bottom of the 
Field names in header row list box. You can move it up by clicking 
the Move Up button (the button with the up arrow).  
  Remove a field : Click the field in the Field names list box, and then 
click the Remove (–) button. Word doesn’t confirm the removal, but 
it places the field name in the Placeholder list text box in case you 
need to edit it and add it back to the list.  
  Rearrange the fields : To change the order in which the fields appear 
in the Field names list box, click the field, and then click the Move 
Up button (the button with the up arrow) or the Move Down button 
(the button with the down arrow).  
 Figure 9-4.   Use the Edit List Fields dialog box to set up the fields for a new list stored in a Word document. Before 
you create such a data source, consider alternatives such as an Excel workbook, your Outlook Contacts, or your OS X 
Contacts list 
 

269
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 3. 
 When you’ve finished customizing the fields, click the Create button 
to close the Edit List Fields dialog box. Word displays the Save 
dialog box.  
 4. 
 Type the name for the list document, and select the folder in which to 
save it.  
 5. 
 Click the Save button to close the Save dialog box. Word saves the 
list document and then displays the Edit List Entries dialog box 
(see Figure  9-5 ).  
 6. 
 Type the information in each field, pressing Tab to move from 
one field to the next. (Press Shift+Tab if you need to move back to 
the previous field.)  
 7. 
 When you’ve finished adding a record, click the Add (+) button to 
add a new record.  
 8. 
 When you’ve finished adding records, click the OK button to 
close the Edit List Entries dialog box. Word automatically saves the 
data source document.  
 Figure 9-5.   Use the Edit List Entries dialog box to enter data in a new Word list quickly and easily 
 

270
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 
EDITING RECORDS IN THE EDIT LIST ENTRIES DIALOG BOX
 When you create a new list, you mostly use the Add New button in the Edit List Entries dialog box. But when you 
open a list for updating or editing, you can also take other actions. To open a list for editing, choose Mailings ➤ 
Start Mail Merge ➤ Edit Recipient List. 
 These are the other actions you can take when editing records:
  Navigate among records : In the Record area in the lower-left corner of the Edit List Entries 
dialog box, click the First button to move to the first record, the Previous button to move to 
the previous record, the Next button to move to the next record, or the Last button to move 
to the last record. Or, if you know the number of the record you want, type it in the text 
box, and then press Return to display that record. 
  Delete the current record : Click the Delete (–) button in the Edit List Entries dialog box. 
  Reset the record you’re editing : Click the Reset button to read the record again from the 
list document, and enter its data into the fields in the Edit List Entries dialog box. Resetting 
the record wipes out any changes you’ve made to the record. 
  Find a record : Click the Find button to display the Find in Field dialog box (see Figure  9-6 ). 
Type the search term in the Find what box, entering all the text that will appear in the field 
(Word doesn’t find matches for part of a field). Then open the In field pop-up menu, and 
click the field to search. Click the Find First button to locate the first matching record. Click 
the Find Next button (which replaces the Find First button after Word finds a match) to 
search again. Click the Close button when you’ve found the record you want to edit. 
  Open the list document : Click the View Source button in the Edit List Entries dialog box. 
Normally you don’t need to open the list document, because it’s easier to add and edit 
records by using the Edit List Entries dialog box; Word keeps the list document hidden 
from view, even though it is open for editing. But you may sometimes need to open the 
list document so that you can make sweeping changes to it, for example, by using Word’s 
Replace features to replace all instances of a particular term. 
 Figure 9-6.   Use the Find in Field dialog box to quickly locate a particular record in a Word list 
 

271
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Opening an Existing List 
 If you already have your data in a Word document that you created previously, in an Excel 
workbook (for example, one that contains a database table), or in a text file, give the Use an 
Existing List command to connect the list to the main document. Follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Select Recipients ➤ Use 
an Existing List. Word displays the Choose a File dialog box, which 
works like any other Open dialog box.  
 2. 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the list, and then click the file.  
 3. 
 Click the Open button to close the Choose a File dialog box. Word 
connects the list to the main document.  
 Using Contacts from Your Outlook Contacts 
 If your version of Office for Mac includes Outlook, you probably store your contacts in 
Outlook’s Contacts list. In this case, you can use your contacts easily in  mail merges.  
 To use your Outlook Contacts list in a mail merge, choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ 
Select Recipients ➤ Choose from Outlook Contacts. Word connects your Outlook Contacts 
list to the main document.  
 Using Contacts from Your OS X Contacts 
 If you keep your contacts’ data in the OS X Contacts app rather than in Outlook, choose 
Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Select Recipients ➤ Apple Contacts. Word connects the OS 
X Contacts list to the main document.  
 Using Data from a FileMaker Pro Database 
 If the data you will use for the mail merge is in a  FileMaker Pro database  , follow these steps 
to connect the database to the main document:
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Select Recipients ➤ 
FileMaker Pro. Word displays the Choose a File dialog box, which 
works like any other Open dialog box.  
 2. 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the list, and then click the file.  
 3. 
 Click the Open button to close the Choose a File dialog box. Word 
connects the database to the main document.  

272
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Inserting Merge Fields in Your Main Document 
 Now that you’ve connected the data source to the main document, you’re ready for the third 
step in the mail merge process. This step is to  insert merge fields  in your main document to 
tell Word where to place each field of information from the records. 
 Place the insertion point at the appropriate place in the document, choose Mailings ➤ Write 
& Insert Fields ➤ Insert Merge Field to display the Insert Merge Field panel, and then click 
the field you want to insert. Figure  9-7 shows an example of inserting fields to create a 
name-and-address block suitable for a letter.    
 Tip   Remember to add all the necessary spaces and punctuation between the merge fields. It’s 
easy to omit the spaces and punctuation when you’re arranging the merge fields, but the resulting 
merged documents look unprofessional and unconvincing. You’ve probably received enough of them 
yourself to know how even a minor mistake in layout instantly destroys the illusion of care that the 
personalized letter is intended to give. If you can get the spaces and punctuation right when inserting 
the merge fields, you’re ahead of the game; if not, you can catch errors at the preview stage. 
 Note   The Rules button in the Write & Insert Fields group on the Mailings tab of the Ribbon enables 
you to insert  rules , which are fields you can insert in the document to do things such as add 
information about the merge itself or insert data only if a condition is met. For example, the Merge 
Sequence # rule inserts the merge sequence number, and the If… Then… Else rule inserts one text 
string if the condition you specify is met and a different text string if it is not. Rules are beyond the 
scope of this book, but you can find information on how to use them online or in Word’s Help file. 
 Figure 9-7.   Add merge fields to your main document by from the Insert Merge Field panel in the Write & Insert Fields 
group on the Mailings tab of the Ribbon 
 

273
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Filtering the Recipients of the Merge Document 
 The fourth step in the mail merge process is to  filter  the recipients of your data source to 
specify which of them should receive the merged documents. 
 To filter the recipients of the merge, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Filter Recipients from the 
Ribbon to open the Query Options dialog box. The contents of the 
Query Options dialog box vary depending on the list you’re using, so 
I’ll show you a couple of examples.  
 2. 
 Figure  9-8 shows the Query Options dialog box as it appears for 
Outlook Contacts. Figure  9-9 shows the Query Options dialog box as 
it appears for a list created in Word.  
 Note   If you want to use each item in your data source to produce a document or entry in the mail 
merge, you don’t need to apply filtering. 
 Figure 9-8.   In the Query Options dialog box, set up any filtering needed to identify the records you want to use in the 
mail merge. This is the Query Options dialog box you see for Outlook Contacts 
 

274
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 3. 
 Choose options for filtering the data source. For example, for 
Outlook Contacts,
  In the “List mail merge recipients by” pop-up menu, choose 
Categories if you want to see Contacts categories such as Personal, 
Work, Friends, and Family. Using a category is the quick and easy 
way to filter records, as long as you’ve arranged your contacts by 
categories. Choose Complete Record if you want to be able to choose 
individual contacts by name.  
  In the “Select the categories you would like to include” list box 
(when you’ve selected Categories) or the “Select the individual 
contacts you would like to include” list box (when you’ve selected 
Complete Record), select the check box for each category or for 
each contact you want to include.  
 4. 
 When you have chosen the records you want, click the OK button to 
close the Query Options dialog box.  
 Previewing the Results of the Mail Merge 
 At this point, the merge is set up and ready to run—in theory. In practice, it’s all too easy to 
waste paper or send embarrassing e-mail messages by getting merge fields and text in the 
wrong places. So, it’s always wise to use the preview feature to make sure your merge works 
the way you intend it to work. 
 To preview the results, choose Mailings ➤ Preview Results ➤  Preview Results  , clicking the 
Preview Results button so that it appears darker and pushed in. The first of the merged 
documents appears (see Figure  9-10 ), and you can see whether you’ve got the fields and 
text in the right places.  
 Figure 9-9.   The Query Options dialog box for a list created in Word enables you not only to filter the records but also 
sort them into your preferred order 
 

275
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 You can then move through the records using the Next Record button, Last Record button, 
Previous Record button, and First Record button in the Preview Results group, looking to 
see whether data missing from or present in any of the records shows up problems with the 
document’s merge fields and layout. With the data in place, it’s much easier to see whether 
you’re missing text, spaces, punctuation, or even paragraph marks. 
 If you need to move to a particular record by number, click the Record Number box to select 
its current contents, type the number, and then press Return to display it. 
 Click the Preview Results button again, unpushing it, when you want to display all the merge 
fields instead of the data. Showing the merge fields can be helpful when you need to see 
exactly what information is going where.  
 Completing the Mail Merge 
 After you’ve previewed the merge results and deemed them satisfactory, you’re ready for the 
sixth and final step: completing the mail merge. In this step, you choose among sending the mail 
merge documents directly to your printer, creating a document that contains them all (and that 
you can edit and customize further if necessary), or creating e-mail messages to the recipients. 
 Figure 9-10.   Use the controls in the Preview Results group on the Mailings tab of the Ribbon to make sure the merged 
documents look correct before you create them  
 

276
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 When you’re ready to complete the mail merge, choose Mailings ➤ Merge Range ➤ Merge 
Range from the Ribbon to display the  Merge Range  pop-up menu, and then choose which 
records to merge:
  All : Select this item to merge all the records.  
  Current Record : Select this item to merge just the record you’ve 
selected. This setting is useful for merging individual records you missed 
in your main merge or for running a test item to make sure everything’s 
working okay.  
  Custom : Select this item when you need to specify a range of records. 
Type the start number in the left text box (which has no label) and the 
end number in the To text box.  
 Once you’ve selected the records, follow the instructions in the next three subsections for 
the type of merge documents you want to create. 
 Merging to a New Document 
 To merge the records to a new document that contains all the documents together, choose 
Mailings ➤ Finish ➤ Finish & Merge ➤ Edit Individual Documents from the Ribbon. Word 
creates a new document that contains all the merged documents. You can then check 
through the document, add any extra information needed (for example, you may want to 
personalize some documents manually), and then save it or print it as needed.  
 Merging Individual Documents to a Printer 
 To merge the records to individual  documents  and send them directly to a printer, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Finish ➤ Finish & Merge ➤ Print Documents from 
the Ribbon. The Print dialog box opens.  
 2. 
 Make sure the correct printer is selected in the Printer pop-up menu.  
 3. 
 Choose any other print options needed. For example, if you need to 
print two copies of each merged document, enter  2 in the Copies 
text box.  
 4. 
 Make sure that the document in the Quick Preview box looks the 
way it should. Use the First Page button, Previous Page button, Next 
Page button, and Last Page button below the Quick Preview area to 
move from page to page, making sure that each page looks right.  
 5. 
 Click the Print button to merge the documents to the printer and print 
them. 

277
CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Merging to E-mail Messages 
 To merge the records and create  e-mail messages  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Finish ➤ Finish & Merge ➤ Merge to E-mail. 
Word displays the Mail Recipient dialog box (see Figure  9-11 ). 
 2. 
 In the To pop-up menu, make sure the field containing the e-mail 
address is selected. Word suggests the E_mail field by default, but 
you may need to select a different field (for example, one with a 
home e-mail address rather than a work e-mail address).  
 3. 
 In the Subject text box, type the subject line you want each message 
to use. 
 4. 
 In the Send As pop-up menu, choose the format in which to send the 
e-mail messages:
  Text : Choose this item to send the Word document’s text without 
formatting. Using text makes sure the addressee receives the message, 
but the text loses any formatting. If you use plain text, test how the 
document looks in a text-only format before sending the merged 
documents. For example, you may need to add a blank line between 
paragraphs to make sure they don’t appear as a single block.  
 Tip  If the Merge to E-mail command on the Finish & Merge panel is dimmed and unavailable, 
you likely need to set Outlook as your default e-mail reader. Save your work and quit Word. Open 
the Mail app, choose Mail ➤ Preferences, and click the General tab button to display the General 
preferences. Open the Default email reader pop-up menu and choose Microsoft Outlook in it. Quit 
Mail, reopen Word, and then reopen your merge document and choose Mailings ➤ Finish ➤ Finish 
& Merge ➤ Merge to E-mail from the Ribbon again. 
 Figure 9-11.   In the Mail Recipient dialog box, enter the subject line for the e-mail messages, and choose whether to 
send them as text, HTML, or attachments

CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
  Attachment : Choose this item to send the Word document as an 
attachment to the e-mail message. Sending the document as an 
attachment ensures that the Word document retains all its formatting 
in transit, but recipients must have Word (or a compatible word-
processing app) in order to read the attachment.  
  HTML Message : Choose this item to send the Word document as a 
formatted e-mail message. This works well as long as the recipient’s 
e-mail app can accept HTML-formatted messages; if not, the 
recipient will see a text-only version of the message and a version 
with HTML codes studded through it.  
 5. 
 Click the Mail Merge To Outbox button to merge the documents to 
your e-mail outbox.  
 6. 
 Go to Outlook. Check that the messages look correct, and then send 
them. 
 Restoring a Mail Merge Main Document to a Normal 
Document 
 Sometimes you may need to change a main document that you used for mail merge back to 
a normal document so that you can use it normally. To do so, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Open the document.  
 2. 
 Choose Mailings ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Start Mail Merge ➤ Normal 
Word Document from the Ribbon. Word displays a confirmation 
dialog box (see Figure  9-12 ). 
 3. 
 Click the Restore button. Word removes the link to the list.  
 4. 
 Save the document. For example, click the Save button on the title 
bar or press Cmd+S.  
 Figure 9-12.   Click the Restore button in this confirmation dialog box to change a Word document back from a mail 
merge main document to a normal document

CHAPTER 9: Creating Business Documents with Mail Merge
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to use Word’s powerful mail merge feature to create 
business documents such as form letters, mailing labels, envelopes, and catalogs. You 
now know how Word’s six-step process for creating mail merge documents works. You can 
create main documents, build new lists or connect existing lists, filter the records to use only 
those you need, and perform the merge. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to revise, review, and finalize documents. Turn the 
page when you’re ready to start.

 Chapter 10  
 Revising and Reviewing 
Documents 
 Chances are that you’ll create some documents on your own, but for other documents, 
you’ll need to work with other people—either sharing the documents on a network or via the 
Internet or using e-mail to send the documents back and forth. 
 Word includes strong features for working together on documents. In this chapter, I’ll start by 
reviewing the different options so that you’re clear about the different choices. After that, I’ll 
show you how to work on a document simultaneously with your colleagues—if you have the 
technology required—and how to share documents but work on them one person at a time. 
 Next, you’ll learn how to use the  Track Changes  feature, also called  revision marking  , to 
track all the edits you and your colleagues make to a document so that you can keep an 
audit trail. You can then review the changes and decide which to keep and which to remove. 
 Last, I’ll show you how to add comments to a document, how to compare two documents 
to identify their differences automatically, and how to incorporate changes from two or more 
copies of a document into a single file. 
 Working on Documents with Your Colleagues 
 In Word, you can work on documents with your  colleagues  either together or separately:
  Work on the same copy of the document simultaneously : If you have 
a SharePoint site or you store documents on OneDrive, you and your 
colleagues can store the document on the site, each open it at the same 
time, and work on it together. Microsoft calls this  coauthoring . 

282
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Work on separate copies of the document : If you don’t have a 
SharePoint site or use OneDrive, and you open a document that 
somebody else is using, Word opens the document in a read-only 
state. If necessary, you can save the document under a new name so 
that you can edit it, and then integrate any changes you make back 
into the main copy.  
  Circulate a copy of the document, and each work on it in turn : This 
method is easiest because you use only a single copy of a document, 
and each person has free rein when they’re editing it—but it usually 
takes longer than the other methods. To see clearly which changes each 
person has made to the document, you normally use Word’s Track 
Changes feature, as discussed in this chapter.  
 Whichever way you work, you can use three main features for revising and reviewing 
documents with your colleagues:
  Track Changes : When you turn on this feature, Word tracks the 
insertions, deletions, formatting changes, and most other changes to 
the document. You can then view the changes, accept the changes you 
want to keep, and reject the others.  
  Comments : You and your colleagues can attach comments to items in 
the document to offer opinions or suggest changes, without actually 
changing the text itself. You can then view the comments and remove 
them once you’ve dealt with them.  
  Compare : This feature makes Word analyze and mark up the differences 
between two versions of the same document.  Document Compare  
is useful when you need to amalgamate changes from two or more 
different versions in which you haven’t tracked changes.  
 Editing a Document Simultaneously with Your 
Colleagues 
 Word’s most advanced way of working on a document with your colleagues is for each of 
you to open the same copy of the document at the same time and all work on it together. 
Here’s what happens:
  Create  the document : You create the document as normal (for example, 
by using a template) and store it on your SharePoint site or on OneDrive.  
 Note   If you have a SharePoint site, chances are you will want to try simultaneous editing and see 
how well it works for you. But if you find that running into conflicting changes creates more problems 
than it solves, you may be better off using the older means of collaboration. Coauthoring is technically 
very impressive, and it can be great in the right situation, but it’s not suitable for everyone. 

283
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Open  the document : The first person opens the document as normal. When 
another person opens the document, they see a pop-up message (see 
Figure  10-1 ) telling them about the other people already editing the 
document. The first person also receives a pop-up message as soon as 
Word notices that other authors have joined in.  
  See who’s editing the document : The status icon at the right end of 
the title bar displays an icon showing the number of people editing 
the document. (This number includes you.) You can click the icon to 
see who the people are (see Figure  10-2 ) and click a person’s name to 
display information and contact buttons (for e-mail, instant messaging, 
and audio and video calls) for him or her.  
 Caution   Unless you have a fast and reliable Internet connection, simultaneous editing of a large 
document stored on OneDrive can be slow enough to make collaboration difficult. 
 Figure 10-1.   When you open a document that others are working on, Word displays a pop-up message to let you know 
they’re editing it 
 Figure 10-2.   To see who the other authors are, click the status icon at the right end of the title bar 
 
 

284
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Edit  the document : You can work pretty much as normal in Word, except 
that only one person can edit a particular paragraph or other element 
at a time. As you work, Word shows you which parts of the document 
other authors are working on by placing a line to the left of the items 
and displaying a name box (see Figure  10-3 ). Word also displays an icon 
with the Update symbol (two arrows curling clockwise) to indicate when 
updates are available.  
  Update  the document : When you’re ready to save changes and get any 
updates that are available, you press Cmd+S or click the Save button on 
the title bar as usual. The Save button displays the Update icon (those 
curving arrows) to indicate that it’s acting as an Update button. Word 
then updates the copy of the document you’re viewing with the changes 
the others have made (see Figure  10-4 ), applies shading to the changes 
to draw your attention to them, and makes your changes available to 
your coauthors. At first, when you update the document, Word displays 
a message box (Figure  10-4 shows this too) to make sure you’re aware 
of the updates; you probably want to select the “Do not show this 
message again” check box before you click the OK button to dismiss 
this message box.  
 Figure 10-3.   Word shows you which parts of the document your coauthors are working on at the moment and when 
updates are available  
 

285
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Resolve conflicts : Word does its best to show you and your coauthors 
who’s working where, but sooner or later, two or more of you may 
change the same part of the document in the same cycles of saving 
and updating. When this happens, Word displays the Upload Failed 
message on the Information bar (see Figure  10-5 ) to the author who tried 
to save changes over the changes another author had already saved. 
Click the Resolve button at the right end of the Information bar to add 
the Conflicts tab to the Ribbon and display the Conflicts pane (see 
Figure  10-6 ). You can then use the controls in the Conflicting Changes 
group on the Conflicts tab of the Ribbon to resolve the conflicts by 
accepting or rejecting changes. When you have resolved all the conflicts, 
Word displays the Conflicts Resolved message on the Information bar. 
Click the Save button at the right end of the Information bar to save the 
changes and exit from Conflict Mode back to the normal editing mode.  
 Figure 10-4.   When you save your changes, Word merges in updates your coauthors have saved. Word displays the new 
items with shading (as in the highlighted paragraph here). Word also displays a message box about the updates, but 
you can suppress this by selecting the “Do not show this message again” check box before you click the OK button 
 Figure 10-5.   Word warns you of any conflicting changes when you try to save the document. Click the Resolve button 
on the Information bar to deal with the highlighted conflicts  
 
 

286
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Close the document : When you have finished working with the 
document, save any unsaved changes, and then close it as usual.  
 Sharing Documents with Your Colleagues on a Network 
 You can also share documents with your  colleagues  on a network without using SharePoint. 
In this case, you save the document in a shared folder on the network. From there, anyone 
permitted to use the folder can open the document, edit it, and save it. 
 In previous versions of Word, only one person at a time could open a document in a shared folder. 
If you tried to open a document that somebody else had already opened, Word would display a 
message saying that the file was locked for editing and inviting you to open a read-only copy of the 
file. After opening the read-only copy, you could make changes to the document, but you could 
save them only by using a different file name, a different location, or (for bonus points) both. 
 As of this writing, Word no longer warns you that a file is locked for editing. Instead, Word 
opens the file and displays a Read Only message on the Information bar beneath the Ribbon 
(see Figure  10-7 ). You can click the Duplicate button at the right end of the Information bar 
to create a copy of the document in which you can save changes. If you want to integrate 
those changes into the network copy, you need to do so either manually or by using the 
Document Combine feature (discussed later in this chapter).  
 Figure 10-6.   In the  Conflict pane on the left, click the change you want to resolve. Use the controls in the Conflicting 
Changes group on the Conflict tab of the Ribbon to accept and reject changes and move among them  
 

287
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 This arrangement works well most of the time, but Word seems sometimes to miss the fact 
that a document is open and locked for editing. When this happens, you appear to have 
the document open for editing, and all goes well until you try to save it. At this point, Word 
discovers the problem and displays the Grant File Access dialog box (see Figure  10-8 ), inviting 
you to grant Word access to the locking file, which has an automatically generated name such 
as .smbdeleteAAA184e75e. (The period at the beginning of the file name is correct.)  
 Figure 10-7.   If Word displays the Read Only message on the Information bar, you can click the Duplicate button to 
create a copy of the file in which you can save changes 
 Figure 10-8.   If Word displays the Grant File Access dialog box, it means that someone else is already editing the 
document. Click the Cancel button, and then save your copy under a different name  
 
 

288
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Don’t click the Select button and use the resulting dialog box to try to locate the locking 
file—it’s a hidden file, and you won’t be able to see it unless you tinker with the OS X file 
system. Instead, click the Cancel button, choose File ➤ Save As from the menu bar, and 
save the document under a different name, in a different folder, or both. You then need to 
integrate your changes with the main copy of the document by using, for example, the 
Document Combine feature. 
 Tracking the Changes in a Document 
 When you need to work with other people on creating or revising a document, use Word’s 
 Track Changes feature  . Track Changes can automatically track almost all the changes in the 
document so that you can review them, see who made which changes when, accept the 
changes you want to keep, and reject the rest. 
 You can choose which types of changes to track and which to ignore. For example, you may 
want to track only the edits to the text of a document and let your colleagues handle the 
formatting. 
 Choosing Which Changes to Track 
 To choose which types of changes Word tracks in a document, follow these steps:
 1. 
 From the Ribbon, choose Review ➤ Tracking ➤ Markup Options 
➤ Preferences to display the Track Changes pane in the Word 
Preferences window (see Figure  10-9 ). You can also choose Word 
➤ Preferences from the menu bar and then click the Track Changes 
icon in the Output and Sharing area of the  Word Preferences window  . 
 Tip   Save your changes to documents frequently. Not only does frequent saving help you avoid 
losing data if Word or your Mac crashes, but it can also prevent you from losing much time to the 
sharing bug explained in this section. 

289
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 2. 
 In the Markup area, choose how to mark insertions, deletions, 
changed lines, and comments:
  Insertions : Open the  Insertions pop-up menu  , and then click the 
type of markup you want for inserted text. Your choices are (None), 
Color Only, Bold, Italic, Underline, Double Underline, Strikethrough, 
or Double Strikethrough. Use the Color Only setting when you need 
a subtle indication of added text; use Underline or Double Underline 
when you need a stronger indication. Open the topmost Color 
pop-up menu, and choose By Author if you want Word to use a 
different color for each reviewer’s additions; to use a specific color 
or shading for all added text, click that color or shading.  
  Deletions : Open the  Deletions pop-up menu  , and then click the 
type of markup to use for deleted text. Your choices are (None), 
Color Only, Bold, Italic, Underline, Double Underline, Strikethrough, 
Hidden, ^ (Word displays a single caret mark to show where text 
has been deleted), # (Word shows a single pound sign where text 
has been deleted), or Double Strikethrough. Open the second Color 
pop-up menu and choose By Author if you want Word to use a 
different color for each reviewer’s deletions; to use a specific color 
or shading for all deletions, click that color or shading. 
 Figure 10-9.   In the Track Changes preferences pane, choose how to show markup, track moves, and handle changes to 
table cells and formatting 
 

290
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Changed lines : Open the  Changed lines pop-up menu  and choose 
whether (and, if so, where) you want Word to display a vertical line in 
the margin next to each line that has changed. These changed lines 
help you locate changes in documents that contain changes on only 
some lines, but if most every line has changed, the changed lines 
are of little use. Choose (None) to skip using changed lines, Left 
Border to put them in the left margin, Right Border to put them in the 
right margin, or Outside Border to put the lines in the left margin on 
left pages and the right margin on right pages. Open the third Color 
pop-up menu and choose the color or shading you want; the Auto 
item applies the default text color and is often the best choice.  
  Formatting : Open the  Formatting pop-up menu  , and choose how to 
mark up items whose formatting has changed. Your choices are (None), 
Color Only, Bold, Italic, Underline, Double Underline, Strikethrough, or 
Double Strikethrough. Pick a formatting type you haven’t yet used, and 
then choose the color in the fourth Color pop-up menu.  
  Comments : Open the  Comments pop-up menu  , and choose the 
color or shading to give to each reviewer’s comments. Choose the 
By Author item to have Word use different colors for each reviewer.  
 3. 
 In the Moves area, select the Track moves check box if you want 
Word to track text you’ve moved within a document separately 
from insertions and deletions. If you select this check box, you can 
choose settings as follows:
  Moved from : Open the  Moved from pop-up menu  and choose how 
to mark the text that is no longer there because it has been moved 
to a different location in the document. Your choices are the same as 
for Deletions, but you should use a different marking so that you can 
distinguish moved text from deletions. For example, use Strikethrough for 
Deletions and Double Strikethrough for Moved From text. Open the Color 
pop-up menu, and choose By Author or the color or shading you want.  
  Moved to : Open the  Moved to pop-up menu  , and choose how to 
mark the moved text in its new location. Your choices are the same 
as for Insertions, but you should use a different marking so that you 
can distinguish the moved text; for example, Underline for Insertions 
and Double Underline for Moved To text.  
 Note   Word’s feature for tracking moved text separately from insertions and deletions works 
only for documents that use the Word Document format (with the  .docx file extension), not for 
documents that use the older Word 97–2004 Document format (on the Mac) or the Word 97–2003 
Document format (on Windows). 
 Tip   The Hidden item can be a good choice for deletions because it makes the deleted items disappear 
from the document, leaving only the text that hasn’t been deleted and the text that has been added. 

291
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 4. 
 In the Table Cell Highlighting area, choose the colors with which to 
shade cells that have been inserted, deleted, merged, or split in a 
table. Usually, you use a different color for each of these changes to 
a table’s structure.  
 5. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Turning On Track Changes for a Document 
 To turn on Track Changes for a document, choose Review ➤ Tracking ➤ Track Changes, 
moving the  Track Changes  switch from the Off position to the On position. 
 You can also choose Tools ➤ Track Changes ➤ Highlight Changes from the menu bar to 
display the Highlight Changes dialog box (see Figure  10-10 ), select the “Track changes while 
editing” check box, and then click the OK button.  
 When you need to turn Track Changes off again, choose Review ➤ Tracking ➤ Track 
Changes again, moving the Track Changes switch from the On position to the Off position.  
 Caution   Word provides the By Author setting for the four pop-up menus in the Table cell 
highlighting area of the Track Changes Options dialog box, but it’s best not to use this setting. 
Otherwise, although you can see who changed the table’s structure, you need to dig deeper to see 
what the person did to the table. Usually, it’s easier to see how the table has changed and then find 
out who made the changes only if you need to do so. 
 Tip  From the keyboard, press Cmd+Shift+E to toggle Track Changes on or off. This is usually the 
quickest way of toggling Track Changes. 
 Figure 10-10.   You can turn Track Changes on by selecting the “Track changes while editing” check box in the Highlight 
Changes dialog box and then clicking the OK button  
 

292
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Ensuring Your Colleagues Use the Track Changes Feature 
 Track Changes is a great feature, but anyone can  turn off tracking  and rampage through the 
document making untracked changes unless you force them to use Track Changes. You can 
do this by protecting the document. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Review ➤ Protect ➤ Protect Document from the Ribbon 
or Tools ➤ Protect Document from the menu bar to display the 
Password Protect dialog box (see Figure  10-11 ). 
 2. 
 In the Protection area, select the Protect document for check box.  
 3. 
 In the same area, select the Tracked changes option button.  
 4. 
 In the Password (optional) box, type a password. You should 
make the password at least eight characters long, mix upper- and 
lowercase letters, and include numbers and symbols.  
 Figure 10-11.   Use the Password Protect dialog box to ensure that your colleagues use Track Changes when editing the 
document 
 

293
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 5. 
 Click the OK button. Word displays a dialog box prompting you to 
re-enter the password.  
 6. 
 Type the password in the Re-enter the password box, and then click 
the OK button. Word closes both the confirmation dialog box and 
the Password Protect dialog box and applies the protection to the 
document.  
 7. 
 Save the document by clicking the Save button on the title bar or 
pressing Cmd+S.  
 Working in a Document with Track Changes On 
 After you turn on Track Changes for a document, you can work in it much as normal. Word 
tracks your insertions, deletions, and other changes, and displays such markup as you’ve 
chosen to show. 
 For example, in  Print Layout view  and  Web Layout view  , Word normally displays the markup 
area and balloons, as shown in Figure  10-12 . 
 Tip   To switch among the settings for markup balloons, choose Review ➤ Tracking ➤ Markup 
Options ➤ Balloons, and then click the command you want: Show Revisions in Balloons, Show All 
Revisions Inline, or Show Only Comments and Formatting in Balloons. 
 Figure 10-12.   In Print Layout view and Web Layout view, Word displays the markup area with balloons detailing the 
changes  
 

294
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 In Draft view and Outline view, Word shows the changes inline, using the markup specified 
in the Track Changes pane of the  Word Preferences dialog box  , such as applying an 
underscore to each insertion and strikethrough to each deletion, as shown in Figure  10-13 . 
 To see information about a change in Draft view or Outline view (or in one of the other views—
for example, when you have chosen not to use the markup area), hold the pointer over the 
change. Word displays a tooltip showing the details of the change (see Figure  10-14 ).  
 Note  If Word doesn’t display a tooltip when you hold the pointer over a tracked change, choose 
Word ➤ Preferences to display the Preferences window. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools area, 
click the View icon to display the View preferences pane. In the Show in Document area, select the 
Comments on rollover check box. Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the 
red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. Word now displays the tooltips. 
 Figure 10-13.   Depending on the markup options you’ve chosen and the view you’re using, Word can mark insertions 
and deletions inline  
 Figure 10-14.   Hold the pointer over a tracked change to display a tooltip showing the details 
 
 

295
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Choosing How to View the Document’s Changes and Markup 
 As you work with Track Changes on, you may find it helpful to change how Word displays 
the markup for review. For example, you can show the document as it will appear with all the 
markup accepted or show the document’s original version to see how it was before you or 
other editors let rip. 
 To choose how to view the document’s markup, go to the Tracking group on the Review tab 
of the Ribbon. Open the Display for  Review pop-up menu  (this is the upper-right pop-up 
menu; its name doesn’t appear), and then click the setting you want:
  All Markup : Choose this item to see the document’s final text with 
all the markup displayed. This is the default setting and the one you 
probably want to use most of the time while marking up the document. 
In the layout views with balloons displayed, the insertions appear in 
the document’s text without balloons; the deletions disappear from the 
document except from markers connected to balloons in the markup 
pane that show what was deleted.  
  Simple Markup : Choose this item to see the document’s final text with 
only change lines (the vertical bars in the margin) and comments. This 
view is useful for reading through the changed areas of the document 
for completeness without the detail of the changes to distract you.  
  No Markup : Choose this item to see the document’s final text with no 
markup appearing. Use this view when you want to read the document 
without the visual distraction of markup or when you want to see the 
true page count of the final document.  
  Original : Choose this item to see the document’s original text before 
any of the changes were made. Use this view when you need to remind 
yourself of how the document originally read.  
 Controlling Which Changes Word Displays 
 Word enables you to choose which tracked changes to display. To do so, go to the Tracking 
group on the Review tab of the Ribbon, open the  Markup Options pop-up  menu (see 
Figure  10-15 ), and then display an item by clicking to place a check mark next to it or hide a 
displayed item by clicking to remove its check mark.  
 Tip   Which tracked changes you find helpful to display and the best way to display them will likely 
depend on the amount of changes in the document; the nature of those changes; and your role 
in creating, editing, or finalizing the document. For example, when cleaning up a document that 
contains only a few changes, you likely want to display all the tracked changes. By contrast, when 
reviewing edits on a document savaged by multiple colleagues, you may want to hide formatting 
changes so that you can concentrate on the text, view only one reviewer’s changes at a time, or go 
through comments before looking at the actual changes. Experiment with different combinations of 
settings to find out what works best for you. 

296
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 These are the items you can display or hide:
  Comments : Choose whether to show comments inserted in the 
document (as discussed in the “Adding Comments to a Document” 
section later in this chapter).  
  Insertions and deletions : Choose whether to show text and other items 
inserted in the document, deleted from it, or moved from one place in 
the document to another.  
  Formatting : Choose whether to show changes to formatting, such as the 
application of a style or the addition of direct formatting.  
  Markup area highlight : Choose whether to show shading on the markup 
area rather than displaying it as the document’s normal background 
color. Usually it’s helpful to show the shading so that you can easily see 
where the page ends and the markup area starts.  
  Balloons : This submenu gives you a choice of three ways to use 
balloons; even though the submenu displays a check mark for your 
selection, its three items work as an option group, so you can select 
only one item at any given time. Choose the Show Revisions in Balloons 
item to display a balloon for each revision; choose the Show All 
Revisions Inline to force Word to display revisions inline even for Print 
Layout and Web Layout view; or choose Show Only Comments and 
Formatting in Balloons to display comments and formatting changes in 
balloons but other changes inline.  
 Figure 10-15.   Use the Markup Options pop-up menu to control which tracked changes appear on screen and how they 
appear. The Balloons submenu lets you choose whether to show revisions in balloons or show them inline 
 

297
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Reviewers : In this submenu, choose All Reviewers to display comments 
from all reviewers. Otherwise, remove the All Reviewers check mark, and 
put a check mark next to each reviewer whose changes you want to see.  
  Highlight updates : Choose whether to have Word highlight the latest 
updates to the document so that you can identify them more quickly.  
  Other authors : Choose whether to mark updates by other authors.  
 Integrating Tracked Changes into a Document 
 When everyone has made their edits to the document, you can go through the changes and 
accept those you want to keep and reject the others. 
 To go through the changes, use the controls in the  Changes group  on the Review tab of the 
Ribbon (see Figure  10-16 ). First, select a change by clicking the Next button or the Previous 
button, clicking the balloon in the markup area, or clicking the change in the Reviewing pane.  
 You can then accept changes by using the Accept button and its pop-up menu (see the left

CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Accept all changes shown with your Markup Options settings : When 
you’ve chosen to show only some markup, click the Accept pop-up 
button, and then click Accept All Changes Shown to accept all that 
markup but not markup that’s hidden. For example, if you’ve chosen to 
show formatting but not show insertions and deletions, clicking Accept 
All Changes Shown accepts all formatting changes.  
  Accept all the changes in the document : If the document contains 
changes light enough that you can review them all without dealing with 
individual changes along the way, click the Accept pop-up button, and 
then click Accept All Changes.  
  Accept all the changes and stop tracking changes : Click the Accept 
pop-up button, and then click Accept All Changes and Stop Tracking.  
 Similarly, you can reject one or more changes at once by using the Reject button and its 
pop-up menu (see the right screen in Figure  10-17 ):
  Reject the selected change and automatically select the next change : 
Click the Reject button (or click the pop-up button and then click the 
Reject and Move to Next item).  
  Reject the selected change : Click the Reject pop-up button, and then 
click Reject Change.  
  Reject all changes shown with your Show Markup options : When you’ve 
chosen to show only some markup, click the Reject pop-up button, and 
then click Reject All Changes Shown to reject all that markup but not 
markup that’s hidden.  
  Reject all the changes in the document : To get rid of all the changes, 
click the Reject pop-up button, and then click Reject All Changes.  
  Reject all the changes and stop tracking changes : Click the Reject pop-up 
button, and then click Reject All Changes and Stop Tracking.  
 When you’ve finished accepting or rejecting changes, save the document. You may want to 
save it under a different name (or in a different folder) if the document is now ready for 
another stage in its evolution. 
 Tip  You can also accept or reject a change by using the context menu. Ctrl-click or right-click the 
change in the text, in the markup area, or in the Reviewing pane, and then click the Accept item or 
the Reject item on the context menu. The name of the menu items varies depending on the change, 
such as Accept Insertion or Reject Deletion. 

299
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Adding Comments to a Document 
 When you need to give your input on a document without making changes to the text, use 
Word’s comments. A   comment appears in a floating balloon attached to a word or another 
object in text, enabling you to comment easily and clearly on a specific item. 
 Adding a Comment 
 To add a comment to a document, select the text or object you’re commenting on, and then 
give the appropriate command:
  Ribbon : Choose Review ➤ Comments ➤ New Comment.  
  Menu bar : Choose Insert ➤ Comment.  
 Word then adds colored parentheses around your selection to indicate that it has a comment 
attached. The way Word displays the comment depends on the view you’re using:
  Print Layout view or Web Layout  view : Word displays the markup area 
at the right side of the page and opens a comment balloon for you to 
type the comment in. The comment balloon is attached to the comment 
markers by a thin line, so you can see which part of the document each 
comment belongs to. Figure  10-18 shows the markup area open with 
two comments inserted.  
 Note   If you want to ensure your colleagues use comments on a document rather than altering 
its text, protect the document for comments. Choose Review ➤ Protect ➤ Protect Document 
from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Protect Document from the menu bar to display the Password Protect 
dialog box. In the Protection area, select the Protect document for check box, and then select the 
Comments option button. Type a password in the Password (optional) box, and then click the OK 
button. Confirm the password in the confirmation dialog box, click the OK button, and then save the 
document. 
 Note   If you want to attach a comment to a single word, just click in that word or immediately 
before it. When you insert the comment, Word automatically puts the comment parentheses around 
the word. 

300
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
  Draft view or Outline  view : Word opens the Reviewing pane, which you 
use for reviewing comments and other markup. Figure  10-19 shows the 
Reviewing pane open in Draft view.  
 Figure 10-18.   In Print Layout view and Web Layout view, Word displays comments in the markup area to the side of the 
document 
 

301
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Type (or paste) the text of the comment either in the comment balloon or in the comment’s area 
in the Reviewing pane. Most people leave comments as plain text, but you can apply formatting 
to a comment if you want. For example, you can apply bold or a style to a word that you want 
to emphasize. You can also insert elements such as tables and graphics in comments. 
 If you’re using the Reviewing pane, click the Close button (the × button) at the upper-right 
corner when you’ve finished using it. You can also choose Review ➤ Reviewing from the 
Ribbon to toggle the display of the Reviewing pane.  
 Viewing and Reviewing Comments 
 To review comments, you normally use the markup area and comment balloons (in Print 
Layout view or Web Layout view) or the  Reviewing pane  . 
 You can also hold the pointer over commented text or the comment mark to display a tooltip 
showing the text of the comment, as shown in Figure  10-20 . 
 Figure 10-19.   In Draft view and Outline view, Word displays comments in the Reviewing pane and shows the comment 
number in brackets after the commented item 
 

302
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Most people find the markup area and comment balloons easy unless a document has a 
huge number of comments, but if you find the balloons awkward, you can turn them off by 
choosing Review ➤ Tracking ➤ Markup Options ➤ Balloons ➤ Show All Revisions Inline. 
 Even when the markup area is open, you can display the Reviewing pane by choosing 
Review ➤ Reviewing from the Ribbon or View ➤ Sidebar ➤ Reviewing from the menu bar.  
 Deleting Comments 
 You can  delete  a comment by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking it in the text, in the comments 
pane, or in the Reviewing pane, and then clicking Delete Comment on the context menu. 
 Alternatively, click the comment in the text, in the comments pane, or in the Reviewing pane, 
and then choose Review ➤ Comments ➤ Delete (clicking the main part of the Delete button). 
 To delete only the comments currently displayed, choose Review ➤ Comments ➤ Delete ➤ 
Delete All Comments Shown (clicking the Delete pop-up button to display the pop-up menu, 
as shown in Figure  10-21 ). 
 Note   If you’re using balloons, you can delete a comment by clicking the × button in its balloon. 
 Figure 10-20.   Hold the pointer over commented text or a comment mark to display a tooltip showing the text of the 
comment 
 Note   If Word doesn’t display a tooltip when you hold the pointer over a comment, choose Word 
➤ Preferences to display the Preferences window. In the Authoring and Proofing Tools area, click 
the View icon to display the View preferences pane. In the Show in Document area, select the 
Comments on rollover check box, and then close the Preferences window by clicking the Close 
button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 

303
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 To delete all the comments from the document, choose Review ➤ Comments ➤ Delete 
➤ Delete All Comments in Document. Word doesn’t confirm the deletion, but you can use 
Undo if you give the command by accident.  
 Comparing or Combining Different Versions of the 
Same Document 
 When you need to follow and review the changes in a document, the best approach is to 
use Track Changes (as described earlier in this chapter) on a single document that each 
reviewer works on in turn. This way, Track Changes records all the information you need 
about the changes made to a document and gives you the tools to review the changes and 
incorporate them easily. 
 Other times, you may need to circulate a document to various colleagues at the same time, 
such as to get the review done more quickly. This method gives you multiple copies of the 
same document containing their different edits marked by Track Changes. To incorporate 
all the different edits into a single copy of the document, you can use Word’s Document 
Combine feature. 
 You may also need to compare two copies of a document in which the changes haven’t been 
tracked. For this, you can use the  Document Compare  feature. This feature isn’t as good as 
Track Changes used consistently, but it’s a huge improvement over spending hours poring 
over different document files and trying to integrate the best changes into a single version. 
 To use Document Compare to compare or combine two documents, follow these steps:
 1. 
 If either or both of the documents are open, close them. Starting with 
both documents closed is usually easier than starting with either or 
both open, because it avoids any confusion over similarly named 
documents you have open.  
 2. 
 If you have no document open in Word, press Cmd+N to open a 
new blank document. You need to do this because Word makes 
the Compare Documents command and the Merge Documents 
command unavailable when no document is open.  
 Figure 10-21.   From the Delete pop-up menu in the Comments group of the Review tab of the Ribbon, you can delete all 
the comments shown or all the comments in the document  
 

304
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 3. 
 Give the command for comparing or combining, as needed:
  Compare : Choose Review ➤ Compare ➤ Compare ➤ Compare 
Documents from the Ribbon to display the Compare Documents dialog 
box (shown in Figure  10-22 expanded to display all its settings).  
  Combine : Choose Review ➤ Compare ➤ Compare ➤ Combine 
Documents from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Combine Documents from the 
menu bar to display the Combine Documents dialog box, which is almost 
identical to the Compare Documents dialog box apart from the title.  
 4. 
 Choose the documents you want to compare:
  Either open the Original document pop-up menu and click the 
document in the list or click the Open button next to the pop-up 
menu, click the document in the Open dialog box, and then click the 
Open button.  
  Similarly, either open the Revised Document pop-up menu and click 
the document in the list or click the Open button next to the pop-up 
menu, click the document in the Open dialog box, and then click the 
Open button.  
 Figure 10-22.   Use the Compare Documents dialog box or the related Combine Documents dialog box to identify the 
changes between two documents based on the same document 
 

305
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 5. 
 Tell Word how to label the changes to the document:
  The left “Label changes with” text box or the “Label unmarked 
changes with” text box shows the name of the original document’s 
last reviewer who used Track Changes. Type a different name if 
necessary. If the text box is blank and unavailable, the document 
contains no tracked changes.  
  The right “Label changes with” text box or “Label unmarked 
changes with” text box shows the last reviewer of the revised 
document. Again, you may need to type a different name.  
 6. 
 Click the arrow button to the left of the Cancel button to display the 
lower part of the dialog box so that you can choose comparison 
settings.  
 7. 
 In the Comparison settings area, clear the check box for any items 
you don’t want to integrate. For example, if you want to omit the 
changes to fields, clear the Fields check box. Usually, you want to 
leave most of the check boxes selected.  
 8. 
 On the left side of the Show changes area (under the At heading), 
select the Word level option button to make Word analyze changes 
at the word level. If you need to dig deeper, you can select the 
Character level option button instead, but for many documents this 
produces more detail than is helpful.  
 9. 
 On the right side of the Show changes area (under the In heading), 
select the New document option button if you want to merge the 
changes into a new document. This is usually clearest, but you can 
select the Original document option button or the Revised document 
option button instead if you prefer.  
 10. 
 Click the OK button to close the dialog box and make Word analyze 
the changes.  
 11. 
 If Word displays the dialog box shown in Figure  10-23 , warning you 
that the new document already has changes and that Word may 
ignore some existing changes, click the Yes button. What this means 
is that the revised document contains tracked changes; to make 
the comparison, Word will accept these changes. (The alternative is 
to click the No button, go back into the documents, and accept or 
reject the revisions before you compare or combine the documents.)  
 Tip  If you get the original document and revised document on the wrong sides of the Compare 
Documents dialog box or the Combine Documents dialog box, click the Switch Documents button (the 
button showing left and right arrows) in the middle of the dialog box to switch the two documents. 

306
CHAPTER 10: Revising and Reviewing Documents
 Word then displays the result of the comparison or combination, for example a new 
document containing tracked changes shown in balloons. You can then review the tracked 
changes as discussed earlier in this chapter. If you’ve created a new document that you 
want to keep, save it . 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned essential techniques and tools for revising and reviewing 
documents. You learned how to edit a document simultaneously with your colleagues and 
how to share documents via a network. You now know how to set up Track Changes to 
mark the changes you want to track, how to make your colleagues use Track Changes, 
and how to accept or reject the changes that Word records. You can use comments to add 
suggestions or requests to documents, and you can use the Document Compare feature 
and Document Combine feature to analyze documents and automatically incorporate 
different edits in them. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to finalize, print, and share your Word documents.  
 Figure 10-23.   If Word displays this dialog box when you’re comparing or combining documents, click the Yes button to 
proceed

 Chapter 11  
 Printing, Securing, 
and Sharing Documents 
 In this chapter, you’ll look at how to share your documents with other people. You’ll start 
by seeing how to print an entire document or the relevant pages or sections of it, how to 
choose whether to include markup, and how to print other parts of the document, such 
as markup and document properties. After that, I’ll show you how to secure your Word 
documents by removing sensitive information, locking the documents with passwords, and 
marking the documents as read-only. 
 Next, you’ll learn how to deal with issues in making a Word 2016 document compatible 
with earlier versions of Word. Last, I’ll show you how to create an electronic version of a 
document suitable for distributing online or sending to a print shop for specialist printing. 
 Using Word’s Features for Printing Documents 
 You can print your Word documents by using the standard techniques discussed in 
Chapter   2  , but Word also offers extra features that you may want to use, such as printing 
a custom range of pages; printing markup with its document or without its document; or 
printing a document’s properties, styles, or custom key assignments.  
 Printing a Custom Range of Pages 
 After correcting a document, you may need to print a custom  range of pages  , such as 
pages 1, 3, 5, 8–10, 15, and 30. To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose File ➤ Print or press Cmd+P to display the Print dialog box.  
 2. 
 Make sure the Copies & Pages category is selected in the nameless 
pop-up menu below the Presets pop-up menu (see Figure  11-1 ). 

308
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 3. 
 Select the Page Range option button.  
 4. 
 In the text box below the Page Range option button, type the 
details of the range you want to print, using the conventions shown 
in Table  11-1 . For example,  1,3,5,8-10,15,30 prints the pages 
mentioned at the beginning of this section.  
 Figure 11-1.   Use the Page Range option button and text box in the Copies & Pages pane of the Print dialog box to print 
a custom range of pages 
 

309
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 5. 
 Choose any other print options needed.  
 6. 
 Click the Print button to print the pages.  
 Printing Markup and Other Items 
 To print items such as markup and  document properties  , you use the Print What pop-up 
menu in the Microsoft Word pane of the Print dialog box. To display the Microsoft Word 
pane, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose File ➤ Print or press Cmd+P to display the Print dialog box.  
 2. 
 Open the pop-up menu below the Presets box, and then click the 
Microsoft Word item to display the Print What pop-up menu and Print 
option buttons in the Microsoft Word pane (see Figure  11-2 ). 
 Note   Printing by sections is most useful if you’ve split up a document into sections, each of which 
starts on a new page. 
 Table 11-1.  Specifying a Custom Range of Pages to Print 
 To Print These Pages 
 Type This 
 Example 
 Consecutive pages 
 Starting page number, hyphen, ending page number 
  8-10 
 Individual pages 
 Page number, comma, page number 
  7,11,15 
 Sections

  s1, s3 
 Range of sections 
  s and starting section number, hyphen,  s and ending 
section number 
 s1-s3 
 Pages within sections

  p3s5-p8s7 

310
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Choosing Whether to Print Markup—or Only Markup 
 When you print a document, you can choose either to print any markup and comments it 
contains or to print the document as it appears without the markup and comments. 
 To tell Word which you want, open the Print What pop-up menu in the Microsoft Word pane in the 
Print dialog box. Click the Document item on the menu to print the document  without markup  . 
Click the Document showing markup item on the menu to include the markup in the printout. 
 Note   Sometimes it’s useful to print only the markup for a document. To do so, open the Print What 
pop-up menu in the Microsoft Word pane in the Print dialog box, click the List of markup item, and 
then click the Print button. 
 Figure 11-2.   Choose the Microsoft Word item in the pop-up menu below the Presets pop-up menu to display the 
Microsoft Word pane, which contains the Print What pop-up menu and the Print option buttons 
 

311
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Printing Document Properties, Styles, AutoText Entries, and Key 
Assignments 
 In the same way that you can print only the markup in a document, you can also print four 
other items by choosing them on the Print What pop-up menu in the Microsoft Word pane in 
the Print dialog box:
  Document properties : Select this item to print a page showing the 
document’s properties: the file name, directory (folder), template, title, 
subject, author, and so on.  
  Styles : Select this item to print pages listing the styles used in the 
document and their formatting.  
  AutoText entries : Select this item to print a list of the AutoText entries 
stored in the document’s template.  
  Key assignments : Select this item to print a list of the custom key 
assignments in the document (there may not be any).  
 Securing a Document 
 When you are ready to share a document with others, you may need to secure it. Word gives 
you several tools for securing a  document  :
  You can set Word to warn you before you print, close, or send a file that 
contains tracked changes or comments.  
  You can protect the document with a password to prevent unauthorized 
people from opening it or modifying it.  
  You can remove sensitive information from the document automatically.  
  You can mark a document with a read-only recommendation.  
  You can restrict access to the document to only specific people. This 
topic is beyond the scope of this book.  
 In this section, you’ll look at the first four of these five tools. 
 Setting Word to Warn You About Tracked Changes or Comments 
 As you saw in Chapter   10 , Word’s  Track Changes feature  and  Comments  feature are great 
for collaborating on documents with your colleagues. But tracked changes and comments 
often contain information not intended for a document’s final audience, so it’s vital to remove 
them before distributing a document. 
 Note  Depending on the printer model you have, you may be able to choose other settings, 
such as controlling layout or paper handling. 

312
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Word includes a setting to warn you that a document contains tracked changes or 
comments before you distribute it. Follow these steps to turn on this setting:
 1. 
 Open the document you want to affect. If the document is already 
open, click it to make it active.  
 2. 
 Choose Word ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key) 
to display the Word Preferences window.  
 3. 
 In the Personal Settings area, click the Security & Privacy icon to 
display the Security & Privacy pane (see Figure  11-3 ). 
 Figure 11-3.   To turn on Word’s features for helping you avoid distributing documents containing sensitive metadata, 
select the two check boxes in the Privacy options area of the Security pane in the Word Preferences dialog box 
 4. 
 In the Document-specific settings area, select the “Warn before 
printing, closing, or sending a file that contains tracked changes or 
comments” check box. This makes Word display a warning dialog 
box (Figure  11-4 shows an example) when you go to print, close, or 
send a file that contains tracked changes, comments, or both.  
 Note   The “Warn before printing, closing, or sending a file that contains tracked changes or 
comments” setting tends to give a lot of false-positive warnings because when you save a 
document, Word doesn’t know whether you’re about to attach it to an e-mail message from your 
e-mail application or distribute it another way. But if your documents contain comments or tracked 
changes you need to remove before distributing the documents, these extra warnings should be 
only a minor irritant. 
 

313
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 5. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 6. 
 Click the Save button on the title bar or press Cmd+S to save the 
document with its new settings.  
 Protecting a Document with a Password 
 If you need to keep other people out of a document or let only approved people open it, you 
can protect the document with a password. Word lets you use two types of  password  :
  Password to open : This is a password required to open the document at 
all. Word prompts you to enter this password when you try to open the 
document (see Figure  11-5 ).  
 Figure 11-4.   You can set Word to warn you that a document you’re about to print, close, or send contains comments or 
tracked changes  
 Figure 11-5.   When you set a password to open a document, Word prompts you for the password before you can open 
the document 
  Password to modify : This is a password required to open a document 
in write mode, in which you can save changes to the document. Word 
prompts you for this password when you open the document (see 
Figure  11-6 ). If you don’t have the password, you can click the Read 
Only button to open the document in read-only mode, in which you 
cannot save changes under the current file name and folder. (You can 
save a copy of the document using a different file name, folder, or both.)  
 
 

314
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Use a password to open when you need to protect the contents of the document against 
people who shouldn’t see them. Use a password to modify when you want to protect this 
particular copy of the document against unwanted changes. Use both when you need to 
implement both forms of protection; Word displays the Password dialog box for the 
password to open first and then (if the user gets that password right) the Password dialog 
box for the password to modify. 
 To encrypt a document with a password, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Review ➤ Protect ➤ Protect Document from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Protect Document from the menu bar to open the Password 
Protect dialog box (shown in Figure  11-7 with settings chosen).  
 Caution   Word’s password protection is effective only against casual snoopers. An attacker who 
uses a password-cracking program (such programs are widely available on the Internet) can open a 
password-protected document with minimal effort. 
 Figure 11-6.   When you set a password to modify a document, Word prompts you for the password when you open the 
document. You can open the document in read-only mode by clicking the Read Only button 
 

315
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 2. 
 In the Security area, click in the Password box under the Set a 
password to open this document heading if you want to set a 
password to open.  
 3. 
 Type the password.  
 4. 
 Press the Tab key. Word displays a sheet prompting you to enter the 
password again.  
 5. 
 Type the password again in the Re-enter the password box, and then 
click the OK button. The sheet closes, returning you to the Password 
Protect dialog box.  
 6. 
 In the Security area, click in the Password box under the Set a 
password to modify this document heading if you want to set a 
password to modify.  
 7. 
 Type the password.  
 8. 
 Press the Tab key. Word displays a sheet prompting you to enter the 
password again.  
 Figure 11-7.   Use the Password Protect dialog box to apply a password to open, a password to modify, or both to the 
active document 
 

316
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 9. 
 Type the password again in the Re-enter the password box, and then 
click the OK button. The sheet closes, returning you to the Password 
Protect dialog box.  
 10. 
 Click the OK button to close the Password Protect dialog box.  
 11. 
 Now that the protection is in place, save the document. For example, 
click the Save button on the title bar or press Cmd+S.  
 Removing Sensitive Information from a Document 
 Quite apart from any confidential contents, a Word document can include  sensitive 
information  about who worked on it, who last saved it, and who added and deleted which 
parts of it. This information is often helpful while you’re developing a document, but you may 
want to remove it before you distribute the document. 
 You can set Word to remove the sensitive information—Word calls it “personal” 
information—automatically. To do so, open the Password Protect dialog box as explained 
in the previous section and select the “Remove personal information from this file on save” 
check box. Close the Password Protect dialog box and save the document as usual.  
 Marking a Document As Read-Only 
 As well as providing password protection, the Password Protect dialog box also contains the 
Read-only recommended check box. By selecting this check box (and then saving the 
document), you can make Word display a dialog box (see Figure  11-8 ) to anyone who opens 
the document. The dialog box recommends that the user open the document as read- only , 
but the user is free to click the No button and open it for editing.  
 Note  You (or anyone else who knows the password) can remove it easily. Choose Review ➤ 
Protect ➤ Protect Document from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Protect Document from the menu bar to 
open the Password Protect dialog box. Select the password in the Password to open text box or 
the Password to modify text box, and then press Delete to delete it. Click the OK button to close the 
Password Protect dialog box, and then save the document (for example, press Cmd+S). 
 Figure 11-8.   When you mark a document as read-only, Word displays this dialog box to recommend that the user open 
the document as read-only. The user can easily ignore the recommendation 
 

317
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Making a Document You Can Open with Earlier 
Versions of Word 
 If you work with people who use versions of Word earlier than Word 2008 for Mac or Word 
2007 for Windows or with people who use other word processing programs, you may need 
to make versions of your documents that will open in earlier versions of Word. This is 
because earlier versions of Word used a different file format than the recent versions; Word 
2003 for Windows and Word 2004 for Mac can open the new file format only if you install file 
converters (see the nearby Note), and many other word processing programs can open only 
files in the older format, which is generally referred to as Word 97–2003 on Windows or Word 
98–2004 on the Mac. 
 To save a document in a format compatible with  earlier versions of Word  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 If the document contains unsaved changes, save them.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Save As or press Cmd+Shift+S to display the 
Save As sheet.  
 3. 
 Open the Format pop-up menu (see Figure  11-9 ), and click the 
format you want. These are the file types you’re most likely to need:
  Word 97–2004 Document (.doc) : Use this format to create a 
document readable by older versions of Word and by compatible 
word processing programs.  
 Note   If you need to get the file converters, steer your browser to the Microsoft Download Center 
(   www.microsoft.com/downloads/  ). For Windows, download the Microsoft Office Compatibility 
Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats file. For the Mac, download the Open XML File 
Format Converter. 
 Caution   Marking a document as read-only is a feeble security measure that is seldom helpful. If 
you want to force your colleagues to treat a particular document as read-only, apply a password to 
modify to the document, and share the password with nobody but yourself. 

318
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
  Word Template (.dotx) : Use this format to create a Word template 
on which you can base new documents.  
  Rich Text Format (.rtf) : Use this format to create a document with 
formatting that most word processing programs and text editors 
can open successfully.  
 4. 
 Choose any other settings needed for the new document. For 
example, you may want to give it a different file name or save it in a 
different folder.  
 5. 
 Click the Save button to save the document.  
 6. 
 If you have finished working with the document, close it.  
 Figure 11-9.   Use the Format pop-up menu in the Save As sheet to save a Word document in a format that’s compatible 
with other word processors 
 Note The format listed as “Word Document (.docx)” in the Format pop-up menu is the latest 
Word format. This is the format in which Word 2016 saves documents unless you specify another 
format—so in most cases you will be changing the document from this format to another format.
 

319
CHAPTER 11: Printing, Securing, and Sharing Documents 
 Creating PDF Documents for Digital Distribution 
 When you want to distribute a Word document digitally (as opposed to printing it and 
distributing the hard copy), you can choose between sending the document in Word format 
and sending an electronic file that shows the Word document’s contents and layout. 
 Normally, you send the Word document only when the recipient needs to edit the document 
in Word or a compatible word processor. For other purposes, sending a file of the laid-out 
document is usually better. Word makes it easy to create a file in the widely used  Portable 
Document Format (PDF)  . 
 To create a PDF file from a document, follow these steps:
 1. 
 If the document contains unsaved changes, save them.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Save As or press Cmd+Shift+S to display the Save 
As sheet. 
 3. 
 Open the Format pop-up menu, and click the PDF item.  
 4. 
 Choose any other settings needed for the PDF file. For example, you 
may want to give it a different file name or save it in a different folder.  
 5. 
 Click the Save button. Word creates a PDF file with the name and 
folder you specified and then returns you to the document you were 
working in.  
 Now open a Finder window to the folder in which you created the PDF file. Double-click the 
PDF file to open it in Preview (or your default PDF viewer), and make sure all the content 
appears correctly. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to use Word’s extra features for printing documents or parts 
of them, such as document properties or details of the styles they contain. You now know 
how to secure your documents with passwords, remove sensitive information from them, 
and mark them as read-only. 
 You also learned how to save a Word 2016 document so that it’s usable with earlier versions 
of Word and how to create documents in the widely used PDF format that you can take to 
specialist printing services or distribute across the Internet.  
 Note   You can also create a PDF of the active document and send it in a single move by using the 
Share button at the right end of the title bar. See Chapter   2  for coverage of this feature. 

321
 Part 3 
 Analyzing Data with 
Microsoft Excel 
 In this part of the book, you’ll learn how to use Microsoft Excel to build powerful 
spreadsheets and analyze your data. 
 In Chapter   12 , you’ll learn how to create different types of workbooks in Excel and enter data 
in them. You’ll navigate the Excel interface, work with workbooks and worksheets, and use 
Excel’s views and features to see the data you need. 
 In Chapter   13  , you’ll insert, delete, and format rows and columns in worksheets; format 
cells and ranges; and use the advanced conditional formatting and data validation features 
to identify unusual values or erratic input. You’ll also learn how to format quickly and 
consistently with styles, how to add headers and footers to worksheets, and how to share 
workbooks with your colleagues. 
 In Chapter   14  , you’ll grasp how Excel’s charts work and start adding them to your 
workbooks. You’ll learn how to lay out a chart effectively, how to make it look good, and how 
to hide any components you don’t want to display. You’ll even learn how to save time by 
reusing the custom chart formatting you create. 
 In Chapter   15  , you’ll first learn the difference between a formula and a function. You’ll then 
grasp how to create custom formulas and how to use Excel’s built-in functions to perform 
preset calculations. 
 In Chapter   16  , you’ll start using Excel to create databases for storing and manipulating your 
information. You’ll learn how to enter information in a database, how to sort the information, 
and how to filter it to find only the results you want. You’ll also learn how to use the Goal 
Seek feature and scenarios to work out solutions to business problems. 
 In Chapter   17  , you’ll meet Excel’s powerful PivotTable feature and start using it to 
manipulate your data so that you can discover the information you need. You’ll learn to build 
a PivotTable from a spreadsheet, sort and filter the PivotTable, and make it show the data 
you’re looking for.

 Chapter 12  
 Creating Workbooks and 
Entering Data 
 In this chapter, you’ll get started quickly with Excel by creating and saving a new workbook. 
You’ll then look at how to navigate the Excel interface and work with worksheets and 
workbooks. You’ll also learn how to enter data in worksheets, how to select and manipulate 
cells, and how to use Excel’s various view features to see the worksheet data you need so 
that you can work easily with it. 
 Creating and Saving a New Workbook 
 When you launch Excel, the application by default displays the New pane in the Microsoft Excel 
Gallery dialog box automatically so that you can create a new workbook or open an existing 
workbook. In this section, you’ll look at how to create a new workbook and how to save it. 
 Creating a New Workbook 
 To  create  a new workbook, you use the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box (see Figure  12-1 ). 
By default, the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box opens when you launch Excel, but you 
can also display it at any other time by choosing File ➤ New from Template from the menu 
bar or pressing Cmd+Shift+P.  
 Note  To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do 
so, choose Excel ➤ Preferences from the menu bar. In the Excel Preferences window, click View to 
display the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, Show” area, select the Group Titles check box, and then 
close the Excel Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of 
the window’s title bar). 

324
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 From here, you have three ways to create a new workbook:
  Blank workbook : To create a blank workbook, click the Blank Workbook 
item, and then click the Create button. You can also simply double-click 
the Blank Workbook item.  
  Template on your Mac : To create a new workbook based on a template 
that’s stored on your Mac, click the template in the list in the New 
pane, and then click the Create button. Again, you can double-click the 
template instead of clicking it and then clicking the Create button.  
 Figure 12-1.   From the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box, you can create a blank workbook, a workbook based on a 
template on your Mac, or a workbook based on an online template. You can also open a workbook you’ve used recently 
by using the Recent pane or any workbook by using the Open pane 
 Note   If you don’t want the Microsoft Excel Gallery dialog box to open when you launch Excel, you 
can turn it off. With Excel open, choose Excel ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma 
key) to display the Excel Preferences window. In the Authoring area, click the General icon to display 
the General preferences pane. Clear the Open Workbook Gallery when opening Excel check box, 
and then click the Close button at the left end of the title bar to close the Excel Preferences window. 
 

325
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Online template : To create a workbook based on a template from 
Microsoft’s Office.com site, click the Search All Templates box in the 
upper-right corner of the New tab and type your search term or terms. 
You don’t need to press Return because Excel searches as you type. 
Click the result that seems most suitable and then click the Create 
button. Alternatively, double-click the result.  
 Saving a Workbook 
 To  save  a workbook for the first time, give the Save command in any of the usual ways: by 
clicking the Save button on the title bar, by choosing File ➤ Save from the menu bar, or by 
pressing Cmd+S. In the Save As sheet that opens, select the folder in which to save the 
workbook, type the workbook name, and then click the Save button. 
 When you save a workbook, Excel uses the file type that’s set in the Save files in this format 
pop-up menu in the Compatibility preferences pane in Excel Preferences. If you’ve chosen 
the format you want, as discussed in the “Setting the Default Workbook Format in Excel” 
section in Chapter   5 , you’re all set. If you haven’t chosen a different format, Excel uses the 
format called Excel Workbook, which works well for recent versions of Excel but may cause 
problems for versions before Excel 2008 for Mac or Excel 2007 for Windows. 
 If you need to save the workbook in a different format than the default one, open the File 
Format pop-up menu and click the format you want to use. For example, if you will share the 
workbook with people who use Excel 2004 for Mac or Excel 2003 for Windows (or even 
older versions of Excel), choose the Excel 97–2004 Workbook format. 
 Note  If you need to base a new workbook on an existing workbook, open the workbook in 
whichever way you find most convenient, and then use the File ➤ Save As command to save the 
workbook under a different name, in a different folder, or both. 
 Tip  If you start recording or writing macros to automate your work in Excel, you need to use a 
workbook format that can contain macros because the Excel Workbook format cannot contain 
macros or other VBA code. Use the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook format for recent versions of 
Excel, or use the Excel 97–2004 format if the workbook is for Excel 2004, Excel 2003, or an earlier 
version. Excel 2008 for Mac doesn’t run macros. 
 Note   The latest Excel file format (the one called simply Excel Workbook) is technically superior 
to the earlier file format (Excel 97–2004 Workbook or Excel 97–2003 Workbook). Using the Excel 
Workbook format, you can create workbooks containing more worksheets, and each worksheet can 
have many more rows and columns. The file format is also more resilient to data corruption. But 
for normal-size spreadsheets, such as those that most business users and home users create, the 
earlier file format still works just fine. 

326
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Navigating the Excel Interface, Worksheets, 
and Workbooks 
 When you create a new workbook or open an existing one, you see the worksheets in the 
workbook. Figure  12-2 shows a new workbook with some data entered.  
 Figure 12-2.    The main elements of the  Excel application window and a workbook 
 Apart from regular Office application elements such as the Ribbon, the scroll bars, and the 
status bar, these are the main elements of the Excel application window and workbooks:
  Formula bar : This is the bar below the Ribbon. This area shows the data or 
formula in the active cell and gives you an easy place to enter and edit data.  
  Reference area : This area appears at the left end of the formula bar. 
It shows the active cell’s address (for example, A1) or name.  
 

327
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Row headings : These are the numbers at the left side of the screen that 
identify each row. The first row is 1, the second row 2, and so on. The 
last row is 1048576.  
  Column headings : These are the letters at the top of the worksheet grid 
that identify the columns:
  The first column is A, the second column B, and so on up to Z.  
  Excel then uses two letters: AA to AZ, BA to BZ, and so forth until ZZ.  
  After that, Excel uses three letters: AAA, AAB, and so on up to the 
last column, XFD.  
  Cells : These are the boxes formed by the intersections of the rows and 
columns. Each cell is identified by its column letter and row number. 
For example, the first cell in column A is cell A1, and the second cell in 
column B is cell B2. The last cell in the worksheet is XFD1048576.  
  Active cell : This is the cell you’re working in—the cell that receives the 
input from the keyboard. Excel displays a green rectangle around the 
active cell.  
  Select All button : Click this button at the intersection of the row 
headings and column headings to select all the cells in the worksheet.  
  Worksheet tabs : Each worksheet has a tab at the bottom that bears 
its name. To display a worksheet, you click its tab in the worksheet 
tabs area.  
  Insert Sheet button : Click this button to insert a new worksheet after the 
active sheet.  
  Scroll buttons : Click these buttons to scroll the worksheet tabs so that 
you can see the ones you need. Click the leftmost button to scroll all 
the way back to the first tab, or click the rightmost button to scroll to 
the last tab. Click the two middle buttons to scroll back or forward by 
one tab.  
  View buttons : Click these buttons to switch between Normal view 
and Page Layout view. You’ll learn how to use these views later in this 
chapter.  
  Split boxes : Use these boxes when you need to split the worksheet 
window into two or four areas. You’ll learn how to do this in the 
“Splitting the Window to View Separate Parts of a Worksheet” section 
later in this chapter.  
  Record Macro button : Click this button to start recording a macro. 
A  macro is a sequence of commands that you can record to automate 
actions you need to take consistently.  
  Zoom control : Drag the slider to zoom in or out on the worksheet. 
Click the – button to decrease the zoom by 10% increments. 
Click the + button to increase the zoom by 10% increments.  

328
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Understanding Workbooks, Worksheets, Columns, and Rows 
 Each workbook consists of one or more worksheets or other sheets, such as chart sheets or 
macro sheets. To display the worksheet you want to use, click its tab in the worksheet tab 
bar (see Figure  12-3 ); if the worksheet’s tab isn’t visible in the worksheet tab bar, click the 
scroll buttons to display it (unless you’ve hidden the worksheet).  
 Figure 12-3.   Use the worksheet tab bar to display the worksheet you want or to insert a new worksheet 
 Each  worksheet  contains 16,384 columns and 1,048,576 rows, giving a grand total of 
17,179,869,184 cells. (This is a worksheet in the Excel Workbook format; the older format uses 
smaller worksheets.) Normally, you use only a small number of these cells—perhaps a few 
hundred or a few thousand—but there’s plenty of space should you need it for large data sets. 
 Moving the Active Cell 
 In Excel, you usually work in a single cell at a time. That cell is called the   active cell and 
receives the input from the keyboard. 
 You can move the active cell easily using either the pointing device (such as a mouse or a 
trackpad) or the keyboard:
  Pointing device : Click the cell you want to make active.  
  Keyboard : Press the arrow keys to move the active cell up or down by 
one row or left or right by one column at a time. You can also press the 
keyboard shortcuts shown in Table  12-1 to move the active cell further.    
 Tip   You can quickly move to the next worksheet by pressing Cmd+Page Down or Fn+Right arrow, 
or to the previous worksheet by pressing Cmd+Page Up or Fn+Left arrow. 
 

329
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Selecting and Manipulating Cells 
 To work with a single cell, you simply click it or use the keyboard to move the active cell to it. 
When you need to affect multiple cells at once, you  select  the cells using the pointing device 
or keyboard, as described below. 
 Excel calls a selection of cells a  range . A range can consist of either a rectangle of 
contiguous cells or various cells that aren’t next to each other. The left illustration in 
Figure  12-4 shows a range of contiguous cells and the right illustration shows a range of 
separate cells.  
 Table 12-1.  Keyboard Shortcuts for Moving the Active Cell

 Figure 12-4.   You can select either a range of contiguous cells (left) or a range of individual cells (right) 
 

330
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 You can select a range of contiguous cells in any of these three ways:
  Click and drag : Click the first cell in the range, and then drag to select all 
the others. For example, if you click cell B2 and then drag to cell E7, you 
select a range that’s four columns wide and six rows deep. Excel uses 
the notation B2:E7 to describe this range (the starting cell address, a 
colon, and then the ending cell address).  
  Click and then Shift-click : Click the first cell in the range, and then Shift-
click the last cell. Excel selects all the cells in between. This technique 
tends to be the easiest to use when the first cell and last cell are widely 
separated; for example, when they don’t appear in the same window.  
  Hold down Shift and use the arrow keys. Use the arrow keys to move 
the active cell to where you want to start the range; then hold down Shift 
and use the arrow keys to extend the selection for the rest of the range. 
This method is good if you prefer using the keyboard to the pointing 
device.  
 You can select a range of noncontiguous cells by clicking the first cell (or dragging through a 
range of contiguous cells) and then holding down Cmd while you click other individual cells 
or drag through ranges of contiguous cells. Excel uses commas to separate the individual 
cells in this type of range. For example, the range D3,E5,F7,G1:G13 consists of three 
individual cells (D3, E5, and F7) and one range of contiguous cells (G1 through G13). 
 To deselect a range you’ve selected, click anywhere outside the range or press an arrow key.  
 Enter Data in Your Worksheets 
 You can enter data in your worksheets by typing it, by pasting it, or by using drag and drop 
to move or copy it. Excel also includes a feature called  AutoFill  that automatically fills in 
series data for you based on the input you’ve provided. 
 Note   You can quickly select an entire row by clicking its row heading or pressing Shift+spacebar 
when the active cell is in that row. Likewise, you can select an entire column by clicking its column 
heading or pressing Ctrl+spacebar. To select all the cells in the active worksheet, click the Select All 
button (where the row headings and column headings meet). You can also either press Cmd+A or 
press Shift+spacebar followed by Ctrl+spacebar (or vice versa). 
 Note   Excel also includes features for importing existing data from sources such as  comma-
separated values (CSV) files and  FileMaker Pro databases . See  Learn Excel 2016 for Mac , also from 
Apress, for details. 

331
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Typing  Data in a Cell 
 The most straightforward way to enter data is to type it into a cell. Once you make a cell 
the active cell by clicking it or moving the selection rectangle to it, you can start typing in it. 
When you start typing, Excel displays an insertion point in the cell. 
 When you’ve finished typing the contents of the cell, move to another cell in any of these ways:
  Press Return : Excel moves the active cell to the next cell below the 
current cell (but see the next Tip). If you select a range of cells, Excel 
moves the active cell down until it reaches the bottom of the range and 
then moves it up to the first cell in the range’s next column.  
  Click another cell : Excel moves the active cell to the cell you click.  
  Press an arrow key : Excel moves the active cell to the next cell in the 
direction of the arrow. For example, press the right arrow key to move 
the active cell to the next cell to the right.  
 Editing a Cell 
 When you need to  edit  the existing contents of a cell, open it for editing in one of these ways:
  Double-click the cell. Excel displays an insertion point in the cell.  
  Move the active cell to the cell, and then press Ctrl+U. Excel displays an 
insertion point in the cell. Figure  12-5 shows an example of editing in a cell.  
 Tip  To change the direction Excel moves the active cell when you press Return, choose Excel ➤ 
Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key). In the Excel Preferences window, click the 
Edit icon in the Authoring area to display the Edit preferences pane. Make sure the “After pressing 
Return, move selection” check box is selected, then open the pop-up menu and click Down, Right, 
Up, or Left, as needed. (If you don’t want Excel to move the active cell when you press Return, clear 
the “After pressing Return, move selection” check box.) Close the Excel Preferences window by 
clicking the Close button (the red circle at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 

332
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Click the cell (or move the active cell to it), and then click the cell’s 
contents in the formula bar. Excel displays an insertion point in the 
formula bar (see Figure  12-6 ). 
 Figure 12-5.   Double-click in a cell or press Ctrl+U to edit its contents in place. In this example, cell A3 is open for editing 
 Figure 12-6.   You can also edit a cell by clicking in the formula bar. This method is often easier for editing entries longer 
than their cells  
 
 

333
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 When you’re editing a cell, pressing an arrow key moves the insertion point within the cell’s 
contents rather than finishing the entry and moving to another cell:
  Left arrow key : Press this key to move left by one character.  
  Right arrow key : Press this key to move right by one character.  
  Down arrow key : Press this key to move to the end of the cell’s contents.  
  Up arrow key : Press this key to move the insertion point back to where it 
was before you moved to the end of the cell’s contents by pressing the 
down arrow key.  
 To finish editing a cell, press Return, click the check-mark button on the formula bar, or click 
another cell. To cancel editing a cell and restore its previous contents, press Esc or click the 
cross button on the formula bar. 
 Entering Data Quickly Using AutoFill 
 When you need to fill in a series of data, see whether Excel’s AutoFill feature can do the 
trick. To use  AutoFill  , you enter the base data for the series in one or more cells and then 
select them and drag the AutoFill handle in the direction you want to fill. AutoFill checks your 
base data, works out what the other cells should contain, and fills in the data for you. For 
example, you can fill in a series of numbers or a range of days, months, or years. 
 Using AutoFill’s Built-in Capabilities 
 Open a test workbook, or add a test worksheet to your current workbook by clicking the 
Insert Sheet button, and then try using AutoFill. 
 Tip  Instead of editing a cell’s existing contents, you can simply replace them by making the cell 
active and then typing new contents. Replacing tends to be faster than editing when a cell needs a 
short entry that you can easily type. 
 Tip  You can also insert a new worksheet by pressing Excel’s Shift+F11 keyboard shortcut—but 
only if your Mac isn’t set to use F11 as the keyboard shortcut for the Show Desktop command 
in Mission Control. This is a standard setting in OS X so if you want to be able to insert new 
worksheets from the keyboard, you must either change the Show Desktop keyboard shortcut (in 
the Mission Control pane in System Preferences) or assign a new keyboard shortcut in Excel (see 
Chapter   5  for instructions). 

334
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Type  Monday in cell A1, press Return to enter the data, and then click cell A1 again. Then 
drag the AutoFill handle—the green square that appears at the lower-right corner of the 
selection—down to cell A7. As you drag past each cell, AutoFill displays a ScreenTip 
showing the data it will fill in that cell (see Figure  12-7 ). When you release the button on 
cell A7, AutoFill fills in the days Tuesday through Sunday.  
 Figure 12-7.   Drag the AutoFill handle down or across to fill in a series of data derived from one or more existing 
entries. In this case, AutoFill fills in the days of the week and repeats the series if you drag farther 
 Now drag through the range to select it, and then press Delete to clear it. Then follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Click cell B2, and type a date such as  5-15-16 in it. 
 2. 
 Press Return, and you’ll see that Excel changes it to a full date, such 
as 2/15/2016. 
 3. 
 Click cell B2 again to select it once more.  
 4. 
 Ctrl-click or right-click the AutoFill handle and drag it to cell G2. 
As you drag, AutoFill displays dates incremented by one day for each 
column (5/16/2016, 5/17/2016, and so on), but when you release 
the button on the pointing device, AutoFill displays a context menu 
(see Figure  12-8 ).  
 

335
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 5. 
 Click the Fill Months item, and Excel fills in a separate month for 
each column: 6/15/2016, 7/15/2016, and so on.  
 Now clear your data again, and then follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click cell A1, and type  5 in it.  
 2. 
 Press Return to move to cell A2, type  25 in it, and press the up arrow 
to move back to cell A1.  
 3. 
 Press Shift+down arrow to select cells A1 and A2.  
 4. 
 Click the AutoFill handle, and drag downward. AutoFill fills in a 
series with intervals of 20—cell A3 gets 45, cell A4 gets 65, and so 
on—using a linear trend.  
 Delete the data that AutoFill entered, leaving 5 in cell A1 and 25 in cell A2. Then follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Select cells A1 and A2.  
 2. 
 Ctrl-click or right-click the AutoFill handle, and drag downward. 
As you drag, you’ll see ScreenTips for the same values as in the 
previous list.  
 3. 
 Release the button on the pointing device, and then click Growth 
Trend on the context menu. AutoFill enters a growth trend instead 
of the linear trend: because the second value (25) is 5 times the first 
value (5), Excel multiplies each value by 5, giving the sequence 5, 25, 
125, 625, 3125, and so on.  
 Figure 12-8.   To reach more AutoFill options, Ctrl-drag or right-drag the AutoFill handle, and then choose the option you 
want from the context menu

CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Creating Your Own Custom AutoFill Lists 
 If you need to enter the same series of data frequently, you can create your own AutoFill 
lists. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Excel ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma 
key) to display the Excel Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the Formulas and Lists area, click the Custom Lists item to display 
the Custom Lists pane (shown in Figure  12-9 with settings chosen).  
 Figure 12-9.   You can supplement Excel’s built-in AutoFill lists by creating your own data series that you need to enter 
frequently in your worksheets 
 Note   The AutoFill context menu also contains items for copying the cells, filling the cells with 
formatting only (copying the formatting from the first cell), filling the cells without formatting 
(ignoring the first cell’s formatting), and filling in days, weekdays, months, and years. 
 3. 
 In the Custom lists box, click the NEW LIST item.  
 4. 
 Enter the items for your list in one of these ways:
  Click in the List entries box, and then type your list, putting one item 
on each line.  
  Click the Collapse Dialog button at the right end of the Import list 
from cells box, select the range containing the list entries in the 
worksheet, and then click the Collapse Dialog button again to 
restore the dialog.  
 

337
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 5. 
 If you’ve just entered a list, click the Add button to add the list to the 
Custom lists box. If you imported a list from a worksheet, click the 
Import button.  
 6. 
 Click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) 
to close the Excel Preferences window.  
 Pasting Data into a Worksheet 
 If the data you need to add to a worksheet is already in another document, you can copy 
it and paste it into the worksheet using the techniques explained in Chapter   3  . You can 
also use Excel’s Paste Special command to paste only some of the data—for example, the 
values of formulas rather than formulas themselves. 
 Using  Paste and Paste Options  
 To paste data, position the active cell at the upper-left corner of where you want the data to 
land. In most cases, you don’t need to select the right number of cells for the data because 
Excel does that for you automatically; if you find Excel prompts you to select the destination 
range, do so. 
 After positioning the active cell, you can either simply give the Paste command or choose 
one of the available Paste Options:
  Paste : Press Cmd+V, choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Paste from the 
Ribbon (clicking the main part of the Paste button rather than the pop-up 
button), or choose Edit ➤ Paste from the menu bar. If you don’t get the 
result you want, click the Paste Options button that appears near the 
lower-right corner of what you pasted, and then click the option button you 
want on the Paste Options menu (shown on the left in Figure  12-10 ).  

338
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Paste Options : Choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Paste (clicking the Paste 
pop-up button), and then click the appropriate item on the Paste pop-up 
menu (shown on the right in Figure  12-10 ). 
 Which Paste Options are available depends on the data you’re pasting, but in most cases 
you have at least the choice of Keep Source Formatting (retaining the formatting the data 
had wherever you copied it from) and Match Destination Formatting (making it look like the 
worksheet you’re pasting it on).  
 Controlling Pasted Data with the Paste Special Command 
 Sometimes you want to paste less than all of the data you’ve copied. For example, you may 
need to paste all the data and formatting except for cell borders, or you may want to retain 
only the values and number formats rather than other information. 
 For these needs, Excel provides the  Paste Special command  . You can access most of these 
options from either the Paste pop-up menu in the Edit group of the Home tab or from the Paste 
Options pop-up menu, but in most cases it’s clearest to use the Paste Special dialog box. 
 Figure 12-10.   If pasted data arrives in the wrong format, click the Paste Options button, and then choose a different 
option from the Paste Options menu (left). You can also use the Paste pop-up menu on the Home tab of the Ribbon to 
choose the format while pasting (right) 
 

339
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 To display the Paste Special dialog box (see Figure  12-11 ), use one of these commands:
  Ribbon : Choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Paste ➤ Paste Special.  
  Menu bar : Choose Edit ➤ Paste Special.  
  Context menu : Ctrl-click or right-click the destination cell, and then click 
Paste Special.  
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Ctrl+V.  
 Figure 12-11.   Use the Paste Special dialog box when you need to paste only some of the data, when you need to 
perform an operation on the data, or when you need to transpose its rows and columns  
 You then select the option button you want in the Paste area:
  All : Select this option button to paste all the data and all its formatting. 
Normally, you only do this if you’re using the Skip blanks check box, the 
Transpose check box, or the Paste Link button; otherwise, it’s easier to 
use the Paste command.  
  Formulas : Select this option button to paste in all the formulas and 
constants without formatting.  
  Values : Select this option button to paste in formula values instead of 
pasting in the formulas themselves. Excel removes the formatting from 
the values.  
  Formats : Select this option button to paste in the formatting without the 
data. This option is surprisingly useful once you know it’s there.  
 

340
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Comments : Select this option button to paste in only comments. This 
option is handy when you’re integrating different colleagues’ takes on 
the same worksheet.  
  Validation : Select this option button to paste in data-validation criteria.  
  All using Source theme : Select this option button to paste in all the data 
using the theme from the workbook the data came from.  
  All except borders : Select this option button to paste in all the data and 
formatting but to strip out the cell borders.  
  Column widths : Select this option button to paste in only the column 
widths—no data and no other formatting. This option is useful when you 
need to lay one worksheet out like another existing worksheet but put all 
different data in it.  
  Formulas and number formats : Select this option button to paste in 
formulas and number formatting but no other formatting.  
  Values and number formats : Select this option button to paste in values 
(rather than formulas) and number formatting.  
  All, merge conditional formats : Select this option button to copy all 
data and formatting and to merge in any conditional formatting. 
See Chapter   13 for details on conditional formatting.  
 If you need to perform a mathematical operation using the data you’re pasting, go to the 
Operation area of the Paste Special dialog box and select the Add option button, the 
Subtract option button, the Multiply option button, or the Divide option button, as needed. 
For example, if you want to multiply the current values in the cells by the values you’re 
pasting, select the Multiply option button. Otherwise, leave the None option button selected 
to paste the data without performing math with it. 
 In the bottom section of the Paste Special dialog box, you can select or clear the two check 
boxes as needed:
  Skip blanks : Select this check box to prevent Excel from pasting 
blank cells.  
  Transpose : Select this check box to transpose columns to rows and 
rows to columns. This option is much quicker than retyping data that 
you (or someone else) have laid out the wrong way.  
 When you’ve chosen the options you want, click the OK button. Excel closes the Paste 
Special dialog box and pastes the data or formatting you chose. 
 Note   If you need to link the data you’re pasting back to its source, click the Paste Link button in 
the Paste Special dialog box instead of the OK button. This makes Excel create a link to the source 
data so that when the source data changes, the linked data changes too. If the source data is in the 
same workbook, Excel updates the links automatically. If the source data is in another workbook, 
Excel updates the data when you open the workbook that contains the links. 

341
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Copying and Moving Data with Drag and Drop 
 When you need to copy or  move data within Excel, you can use drag and drop. Follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Select the data you want to move or copy.  
 2. 
 Move the pointer over an edge of the section so that the pointer 
turns to a hand icon (see Figure  12-12 ). 
 Figure 12-12.   To move data using drag and drop, select the data, and then move the pointer over one of its edges to 
display the drag-and-drop pointer, which is the hand icon that appears on the right border of cell C4 here 
 3. 
 Click and drag the data to where you want it to appear. If you want 
to copy the data rather than move it, Option-drag rather than drag; 
the hand icon shows a plus (+) sign to indicate you’re making a copy. 
Release the button on your pointing device before releasing the 
Option key.  
 Normal drag and drop moves or copies all of the data and all of its formatting, much like 
pasting the material. To reach more options, such as copying only the values or the formats 
or creating a link or a hyperlink to the source, Ctrl-click or right-click and drag instead of 
left-clicking and dragging. When you release the button, Excel displays a context menu 
of choices together with the address of the destination range (see Figure  12-13 ). Click the 
choice you want.  
 

342
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Tip   To change the number of worksheets that Excel includes in a blank workbook, choose 
Excel ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key) to display the Excel Preferences 
window. In the Authoring area, click the General icon to display the General preferences pane. 
Change the number in the “Sheets in new workbook” box to the number of worksheets you want, 
and then close the Excel Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left 
end of its title bar). 
 Figure 12-13.   Use the Ctrl-drag or right-drag context menu to transfer only some of the data or to create a link 
 Inserting, Deleting, and Rearranging Worksheets 
 When you create a workbook, Excel puts a single worksheet in it by default. For many 
workbooks, this may be all you need, but for other workbooks, you need to insert further 
worksheets to give yourself space to work in. 
 For most workbooks, give the worksheets custom names instead of the default names. You 
may also need to rearrange the worksheets into a different order. 
 Inserting and  Deleting  Worksheets 
 You can easily insert a new worksheet in a workbook in either of these ways:
  Insert a new worksheet after the last existing worksheet : Click the Insert 
Sheet button that appears on the tab bar after the last worksheet tab.  
  Insert a new worksheet after a particular worksheet : Ctrl-click or right-
click the existing worksheet tab, and then click Insert Sheet on the 
context menu.  
 

343
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 After inserting a worksheet, double-click its tab to select the default name, type the name 
you want, and then press Return. You can use up to 31 characters in the name. If you want 
to make the tab stand out, Ctrl-click or right-click the tab, click Tab Color to display the Tab 
Color panel, and then click the color for the tab. 
 To delete a worksheet, Ctrl-click or right-click its tab, and then click Delete on the context 
menu. Excel displays an Alert dialog box (see Figure  12-14 ) to double-check that you’re 
prepared to delete it; click the Delete button to go ahead.  
 Note  If the worksheet contains no data, Excel deletes it without displaying the Alert dialog box. 
 Figure 12-14.   Excel confirms the deletion of one or more worksheets in case you’ve given the Delete command 
by accident  
 Tip  You can also press Shift+F11 to insert a new worksheet after the worksheet that’s currently 
selected—as long as OS X isn’t using F11 for a different purpose, such as the Show Desktop 
feature in Mission Control. If OS X is already using F11, you can map the Insert Sheet command 
to a different keyboard shortcut using the technique explained in the “Creating Custom Keyboard 
Shortcuts in Word and Excel” section in Chapter   5 . 
 Rearranging the Worksheets in a Workbook 
 You can rearrange the  worksheets  in a workbook into the order you need. The quick way to 
move a worksheet is to click its tab, drag it left or right until Excel displays a downward 
arrow between the worksheets where you want to place it, and then drop it. 
 Tip  To move two or more worksheets, select them first. To select a range of worksheets that 
appear next to each other, click the first worksheet’s tab, and then Shift-click the tab for the 
worksheet at the other end of the range. To select worksheets that aren’t next to each other, click 
the first worksheet’s tab, and then Cmd-click each other worksheet’s tab in turn. 
 

344
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 This method works well for moving a worksheet a short distance along the tab bar, but for 
moving larger distances, you may prefer to use the Move or Copy dialog box. You can also 
use the Move or Copy dialog box to move or copy worksheets to a different workbook. 
Follow these steps:
 1. 
 If you want to move or copy the worksheets to a different workbook, 
open that workbook.  
 2. 
 In the source workbook, Ctrl-click or right-click the worksheet’s tab 
to display the context menu. To move multiple worksheets, select 
them, and then Ctrl-click or right-click one of the selected tabs.  
 3. 
 On the context menu, click the Move or Copy item to display the 
Move or Copy dialog box (see Figure  12-15 ). 
 Figure 12-15.   Use the Move or Copy dialog box to move one or more worksheets farther than you can comfortably drag 
within a workbook or to move or copy worksheets to another open workbook  
 4. 
 In the To book pop-up menu, make sure the current workbook 
is selected unless you want to move the worksheet to another 
workbook—in which case, select that workbook.  
 5. 
 In the Before sheet list box, click the worksheet before which you 
want to position the worksheet you’re moving. If you want to put the 
worksheets at the end of the workbook, select the (move to end) item.  
 6. 
 Select the Create a copy check box if you want to copy the 
worksheet to the destination rather than move it. Copying tends to 
be most useful when the destination is another workbook, but you 
can copy within a workbook as well.  
 7. 
 Click the OK button to close the dialog box. Excel moves or copies 
the worksheet to the destination you chose.  
 

345
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Making Excel Display Worksheets the Way You Need 
 To work quickly and easily in your workbooks, you need to know how to make the most of 
Excel’s two views and how to use Full Screen view. You also need to know how to split the 
window into two or four parts, how to hide windows when you don’t need to see them, and 
how to use Excel’s features for freezing parts of a window that you need to keep in sight. 
 Understanding Excel’s Views 
 Excel gives you two views for working in your workbooks:
  Normal view : This is the view in which workbooks normally open and 
is the view in which you do most of your data entry, formatting, and 
reviewing. Normal view is the view in which you’ve seen Excel so far in 
this chapter.  
  Page Layout view : This view shows your worksheets as they will look 
when laid out on paper. You use it to adjust the page setup. You’ll learn 
how to do this in Chapter   13  . 
 To switch the view, click the Normal View button or the Page Layout View button in the 
lower-right corner of the Excel window (see Figure  12-16 ) or choose View ➤ Normal or View 
➤ Page Layout from the menu bar. If you prefer to use the Ribbon, choose View ➤ 
Workbook Views ➤ Normal or View ➤ Workbook Views ➤ Page Layout.  
 Tip  When you want to see as much of a worksheet as possible, choose View ➤ Enter Full Screen 
from the menu bar or press Cmd+Ctrl+F. When you want to leave Full Screen view, you can press 
Esc (the simplest way), press Cmd+Ctrl+F, or move the mouse pointer up to the top of the screen 
(making the menu bar appear) and choose View ➤ Exit Full Screen. 
 Figure 12-16.   Use the View buttons in the lower-right corner of the Excel window to change views quickly 
 

346
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Splitting the Window to View Separate Parts of a Worksheet 
 Often, it’s useful to be able to see two parts of a worksheet at the same time as you work in 
it—for example, to make sure that your notes correctly describe your data, or when you’re 
copying information from one part to another. 
 When you need to see two parts of the worksheet in the same window, you can split the 
 window  either horizontally or vertically. To do so, use the horizontal split box at the right end 
of the horizontal scroll bar, the vertical split box at the top end of the vertical scroll bar, or the 
Split button in the Window group of the View tab of the Ribbon. 
 Double-click the horizontal split box to split the window horizontally above the active cell, 
or double-click the vertical split box to split the window vertically to the left of the active 
cell. If the active cell isn’t in the right place for splitting, click the horizontal split box or the 
vertical split box, and then drag it until the split bar appears where you want the split. 
 If you want to split the window into four panes, split it in the other dimension as well. 
For example, if you’ve already split the window horizontally, split it vertically as well. 
Figure  12-17 shows the Excel window split into four panes.  
 Figure 12-17.   Split the Excel window into two or four panes when you need to work in separate areas of the worksheet 
at the same time  
 

347
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Note   You can also split the window into four panes by choosing View ➤ Window ➤ Split from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ Split from the menu bar. 
 To reposition the split, click the split bar, and drag it to where you want it. If you’ve split the 
window into four panes, you can resize all four panes at once by clicking where the split bars 
cross and then dragging. 
 To remove the split, either double-click the split bar or click the split bar and drag it all the 
way to the left of the screen or all the way to the top. You can also choose View ➤ Window 
➤ Split from the Ribbon or Window ➤ Remove Split from the menu bar.  
 Opening Extra Windows to Show Other Parts of a Workbook 
 Instead of splitting a window, you can open one or more extra  windows  to show other parts 
of the workbook. Choose Window ➤ New Window from the menu bar to open a new 
window on the active workbook. Excel distinguishes the windows by adding :1 to the name 
of the first and :2 to the name of the second; for example, General Data:1 and General 
Data:2 (or General Data.xlsx:1 and General Data.xlsx:2 if you have set Excel to display file 
extensions). 
 Changing the  Window  and Arranging Open  Windows  
 The easiest way to change the window you’re working in is to click the window you want to 
use—either click the window itself (if you can see it) or click its button on the Dock. You can 
also choose Open from the Window menu on the menu bar and then click the window in the 
list at the bottom. 
 Note   Opening extra windows has two advantages over splitting a window. First, you can display 
other worksheets in the windows if you want rather than just other parts of the same worksheet. 
Second, you can zoom each window by a different amount as needed or use a different view in 
each window. 
 Once you split the window, you get a separate scroll bar in each part, so you can scroll the 
panes separately to display whichever areas of the worksheet you need. 
 Note  When you split the window, you may find it helpful to freeze certain rows and columns, 
as discussed later in this chapter, to keep them visible even when you scroll to other areas of the 
worksheet. 

348
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 When you’ve opened several windows, you can arrange them by using standard OS X 
techniques, such as by dragging them to the size and position you want or using the Split 
Screen mode in OS X El Capitan (click and hold the green Zoom button at the left end of the 
title bar, drag the window to the left or right side of the screen, and then click the thumbnail 
of the window you want to position on the other side of the screen). You can also use Excel’s 
Arrange Windows dialog box or Arrange pop-up menu to arrange Excel’s windows. 
 To arrange windows using the Arrange Windows dialog box, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Window ➤ Arrange from the menu bar to display the Arrange 
Windows dialog box (see Figure  12-18 ). 
 Figure 12-18.   Use the Arrange Windows dialog box to tile or otherwise arrange all the Excel windows or only those 
from the active workbook 
 Note   If you’ve selected the “Minimize windows into application icon” check box in the Dock 
preferences pane in the System Preferences app, your open Excel windows appear under the Excel 
app’s icon on the Dock rather than as separate windows. To switch to a window via the Dock, first 
open the app’s context menu by clicking and holding, or Ctrl-clicking, or right-clicking the Excel icon 
on the Dock. Then click the window you want to view. 
 2. 
 Click the option button for the arrangement you want:
  Tiled : Select this option button to make Excel resize all the 
nonminimized windows to roughly even sizes so that they fit in 
the Excel window. If you have several windows open, tiling tends 
to make them too small for working in, but it’s good for seeing 
which windows are open and closing those you don’t need.  
  Horizontal : Select this option button to arrange all the windows 
horizontally in the Excel window. This arrangement works well 
for two windows in which the data is laid out in rows rather than 
columns. 
 

349
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
  Vertical : Select this option button to arrange all the windows 
vertically in the Excel window. This arrangement works well for 
two windows in which the data is laid out in columns rather than 
rows. 
  Cascade : Select this option button to arrange the windows in a 
stack so that you can see each one’s title bar. This arrangement 
is useful for picking the window you want out of many open 
windows. 
 3. 
 To arrange only the windows of the active workbook, select the 
“Windows of active workbook” check box. This option is good for 
the Horizontal and Vertical arrangements.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Arrange Windows dialog box. Excel 
arranges the windows as you chose.  
 Zooming to Show the Data You Need to See 
 You can  zoom in or out on your worksheets to make the data easier to read or to display 
more of a worksheet at once. 
 The easiest way to zoom in or out is by using the Zoom slider at the right end of the status 
bar on the Excel window. Click the – button to zoom out by 10% increments; click the + 
button to zoom in by 10% increments; or drag the slider to zoom quickly. 
 If you want to zoom to a different percentage, click the current percentage readout to the 
right of the + button to display the Zoom dialog box (see Figure  12-19 ); alternatively, choose 
View ➤ Zoom from the menu bar to open this dialog box. Select the appropriate option 
button for your needs, and then click the OK button. You can undo the zoom if necessary by 
clicking the Undo button on the title bar or by pressing Cmd+Z.  
 Tip  When you don’t need to see a particular window, you can hide it to get it out of the way. Click 
the window, and then choose Window ➤ Hide from the menu bar. To display the window again, 
choose Window ➤ Unhide, click the window in the Unhide dialog box, and then click the OK button. 

350
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Freezing Rows and Columns  So That They Stay On-Screen 
 To keep your data headings on-screen when you scroll down or to the right on a large worksheet, 
you can freeze the heading rows and columns in place. For example, if you have headings in 
column A and row 1, you can freeze column A and row 1 so that they remain on-screen. 
 You can quickly freeze the first column, the top row, or your choice of rows and columns:
  Freeze the first column : Choose View ➤ Window ➤ Freeze Panes ➤ 
Freeze First Column from the Ribbon.  
  Freeze the first row : Choose View ➤ Window ➤ Freeze Panes ➤ Freeze 
Top Row from the Ribbon.  
  Freeze your choice of rows and columns : Click the cell below the row 
and to the right of the column you want to freeze. For example, to freeze 
the top two rows and column A, select cell B3. Then choose View ➤ 
Window ➤ Freeze Panes ➤ Freeze Panes from the Ribbon or Window 
➤ Freeze Panes from the menu bar.  
 Figure 12-19.   When you need to zoom to a specific percentage, or to fit the selection, open the Zoom dialog box, click 
the appropriate option button, and then click the OK button  
 Note   The Fit Selection option button in the Zoom dialog box enables you to zoom to the right 
percentage to fit a particular selection. Make the selection before you open the Zoom dialog box, 
then click the Fit Selection option button, and click the OK button. 
 

351
CHAPTER 12: Creating Workbooks and Entering Data
 Excel displays a gray line along the gridlines of the frozen cells. Once you’ve applied the 
freeze, the frozen columns and rows don’t move when you scroll down or to the right. 
Figure  12-20 shows a worksheet with rows 1 and 2 and column A frozen.  
 Figure 12-20.   Freeze the heading rows and columns to keep them in place when you scroll down or across the 
worksheet 
 When you no longer need the freezing, choose View ➤ Window ➤ Unfreeze Panes from the 
Ribbon or Window ➤ Unfreeze Panes to remove the freezing.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to create and save a workbook and start entering data in it. 
You explored the Excel interface, and you now know how to add, delete, and rearrange the 
worksheets in a workbook. You also learned how to select cells and ranges, plus essential 
techniques for making Excel display worksheets the way you need them—everything from 
splitting a window into separate parts to opening and arranging multiple windows and 
freezing any heading rows and columns you want to keep on-screen when you scroll.

 Chapter 13  
 Formatting Your Worksheets 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to format your worksheets so that they show the information 
you need and present it clearly. You’ll start by looking at how to work with rows and columns—
inserting, deleting, and formatting them so that your worksheet is the right shape. Then you’ll 
learn how to format cells and ranges, how to apply conditional formatting to quickly flag values 
that need attention, and how to use data validation to check for invalid entries. 
 After that, you’ll look at how to format worksheets quickly using table formatting or Excel’s styles, 
how to add headers and footers to worksheets, and how to print worksheets and workbooks. 
 Lastly, you’ll learn to use Excel’s features for sharing workbooks with your colleagues. You 
can protect a workbook against unwelcome changes, and even share a workbook so that 
both you and your colleagues can edit it at the same time. 
 Working with Rows and Columns 
 In this section, you’ll learn how to insert and delete rows, columns, and cells; change the width of 
columns and the height of rows; and hide rows or columns when you don’t need to see them. 
 Inserting and  Deleting  Rows, Columns, and Cells 
 To accommodate the data in your worksheets, you often need to insert or delete entire 
columns or rows. Sometimes you may also need to delete a block of cells without deleting 
an entire column or row. 
 Note  To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do so, 
choose Excel ➤ Preferences from the menu bar. In the Excel Preferences window, click View to display 
the View pane. In the “In Ribbon, Show” area, select the Group Titles check box, and then close the Excel 
Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the window’s title bar). 

354
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 The easiest way to insert a column or row is to Ctrl-click or right-click the heading of the 
existing column or row before which you want to insert the new one and then click Insert on 
the context menu. 
 To insert more than one column or row, select the same number of columns or rows first. For 
example, to insert three columns before column F, drag through the headings of columns 
F, G, and H to select those columns; then Ctrl-click or right-click anywhere in the selected 
headings, and click Insert on the context menu. 
 You can also insert a column by selecting a cell in the column before which you want to add 
the new column, and then giving either of these commands:
  Ribbon : Choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ Insert ➤ Insert Sheet Columns.  
  Menu bar : Choose Insert ➤ Columns. 
 Similarly, you can insert a row by selecting a cell in the row before which you want to add 
the new row and then giving either of these commands:
  Ribbon : Choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ Insert ➤ Insert Sheet Rows.  
  Menu bar : Choose Insert ➤ Rows.  
 As before, if you want to insert multiple columns or rows, select cells in the corresponding 
number of columns or rows first. 
 To insert an individual cell or multiple cells (but not an entire row or column), follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the range before which you want to insert the cells.  
 2. 
 Choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ Insert ➤ Insert Cells from the Ribbon to 
display the Insert dialog box (see Figure  13-1 ). 
 Note  If the Excel window isn’t wide enough for the Insert button, Delete button, and Format 
button to appear in the Cells group, the Cells pop-up button appears instead. Click this button to 
display a pop-up menu with an Insert submenu, a Delete submenu, and a Format submenu. Click 
the appropriate menu, and then make your choice from it. 
 Note   What the Insert button in the Cells group on the Home tab of the Ribbon inserts depends on 
what you’ve selected. Select one or more columns to make the Insert button insert columns; select 
one or more rows to make the Insert button insert rows; or select one or more cells to make the 
Insert button insert cells. If you haven’t selected the appropriate item, click the Insert pop-up button 
rather than the main Insert button, and then choose the item you want from the pop-up menu.

 3. 
 Select the Shift cells right option button to move the existing cells 
to the right. Select the Shift cells down option button to move the 
existing cells down the worksheet. You can also select the Entire row 
option button to insert a whole row or select the Entire column option 
button to insert a whole column, but it’s usually easier to insert a row 
or column by using the methods described earlier.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Insert dialog box. Excel inserts 
the cells.  
 The easiest way to delete a column or row is to Ctrl-click or right-click its heading, and then 
click Delete on the context menu. Alternatively, you can select the row or column and then 
choose Edit ➤ Delete from the menu bar or Home ➤ Cells ➤ Delete (clicking the main part 
of the Delete button) from the Ribbon. 
 Instead of selecting the column or row, you can click a cell in it, choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ 
Delete from the Ribbon (clicking the Delete pop-up button), and then click Delete Columns 
or Delete Rows, as needed. Usually, it’s easier to select the row or column first. 
 To delete an individual cell or multiple cells (but not an entire row or column), select them, and 
then choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ Delete ➤ Delete Cells from the Ribbon or Edit ➤ Delete from the 
menu bar. In the Delete dialog box (see Figure  13-2 ) that Excel displays, select the Shift cells left 
option button or the Shift cells up option button, as appropriate, and then click the OK button.  
 Figure 13-1.   When you insert a block of cells, click the Shift cells right option button or the Shift cells down option 
button in the Insert dialog box to tell Excel which way to move the existing cells  
 

356
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Setting  Row Height  
 Excel normally sets the row height automatically to accommodate the tallest character 
or object in the row. For example, if you type an entry in a cell, select the cell, and click 
the Increase Font Size button in the Font group of the Home tab a few times, then 
Excel automatically increases the row height so that there’s enough space for the tallest 
characters. 
 If Excel doesn’t set the row height automatically, select the rows you want to affect, and then 
choose Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ AutoFit Row Height from the Ribbon or Format ➤ Row 
➤ AutoFit from the menu bar to force automatic fitting. 
 You can also set row height manually in either of these ways:
  Drag the lower border of the row heading : Move the pointer over the 
lower border of the row heading so that the pointer changes to an arrow 
pointing up and down, and then click and drag the border up (to make 
the row shallower) or down (to make the row deeper).  
  Use the Row Height dialog box : Ctrl-click or right-click the row heading, 
and then click Row Height on the context menu to display the Row 
Height dialog box (see Figure  13-3 ). Type the row height you want, and 
then click the OK button.  
 Figure 13-2.   When you delete a block of cells, click the Shift cells left option button or the Shift cells up option button 
in the Delete dialog box to tell Excel how to fill the gap in the worksheet  
 Note   In the Delete dialog box, you can select the Entire row option button to delete the row the 
selected cell is in, or select the Entire column option button to delete the column. This is useful 
when you realize you need to delete entire rows or columns rather than just a block of cells. 
Otherwise, you don’t need to open the Delete dialog box to delete rows or columns. 
 

357
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Setting Column Width 
 Unlike with row height, Excel doesn’t automatically adjust column width as you enter data in 
a worksheet. This is because the cells in many columns contain entries of varying lengths so 
automatic adjustment would likely make constant changes. 
 You can quickly  set column width  in any of these ways:
  AutoFit a column : Double-click the right border of the column heading. 
Excel automatically changes the column’s width so that it’s wide enough 
to contain the widest entry in the column.  
  AutoFit several columns : Select cells in all the columns you want to 
affect, and then double-click the right border of any of the selected 
column headings. Excel automatically fits each column’s width to suit its 
contents. You can also select the cells and then choose Home ➤ Cells 
➤ Format ➤ AutoFormat Column Width from the Ribbon or Format ➤ 
Column ➤ AutoFit Selection from the menu bar.  
  Resize a column by hand : Drag the right border of the column heading 
as far as needed.  
  Resize a column precisely : Ctrl-click or right-click the column heading, 
and then click Column Width on the context menu to display the 
Column Width dialog box (see Figure  13-4 ). Type the cell width, and 
then click the OK button.  
 Tip  AutoFit is usually the best way to resize a worksheet’s columns. But if some cells have such 
long contents that AutoFit will create huge columns, set the column widths manually and hide parts 
of the longest contents. You can also wrap the text within a cell so that it occupies as many lines as 
it needs; you’ll learn how to do this in the section “Setting Alignment” later in this chapter. 
 Note   You can also display the Row Height dialog box by choosing Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ 
Row Height from the Ribbon or Format ➤ Row ➤ Height from the menu bar. 
 Figure 13-3.   Use the Row Height dialog box when you need to set a row’s height precisely 
 

358
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Resize several columns precisely : Select the columns by dragging 
through their column headings or by selecting cells in each column. Ctrl-
click or right-click in the selected column headings, and then click 
Column Width on the context menu to display the Column Width dialog 
box. Type the column width, and then click the OK button.  
 Hiding Rows and Columns 
 Sometimes it’s helpful to  hide  particular columns and rows so that they’re not visible in the 
worksheet. You may want to do this to hide sensitive data from your printouts or simply to 
make the part of the worksheet you’re actually using fit on the screen all at once. 
 To hide a column or row, Ctrl-click or right-click its column heading or row heading, and then 
click Hide on the context menu. You can also click a cell in the row or column and choose 
Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ Hide & Unhide ➤ Hide Rows or Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ Hide 
& Unhide ➤ Hide Columns from the Ribbon or Format ➤ Row ➤ Hide or Format ➤ Column 
➤ Hide from the menu bar. 
 To unhide a row or column, select the rows above and below it or the columns on either side 
of it. Then Ctrl-click or right-click the selected row headings or column headings and click 
Unhide on the context menu. 
 Note   You can also display the Column Width dialog box by choosing Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ 
Column Width from the Ribbon or Format ➤ Column ➤ Width from the menu bar. 
 Tip  You can also use keyboard shortcuts to hide and unhide rows and columns. To quickly hide the 
active row or selected rows, press Ctrl+9. To hide the active column or selected columns, press Ctrl+0. 
To unhide a row, select the rows above and below the hidden row, and then press Ctrl+Shift+9. To 
unhide a column, select the columns before and after the hidden column, and then press Ctrl+Shift+0. 
 Note   You can also hide and unhide items by choosing Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ Hide & Unhide 
➤ Unhide Rows or Home ➤ Cells ➤ Format ➤ Hide & Unhide ➤ Unhide Columns from the Ribbon 
or by choosing Format ➤ Row ➤ Unhide or Format ➤ Column ➤ Unhide from the menu bar.

CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Formatting Cells and Ranges 
 In Excel, you can format cells in a wide variety of ways—everything from choosing how to 
display the borders and background to controlling how Excel represents the text you enter in the 
cell. This section shows you the most useful kinds of formatting work and how to apply them. 
 Each cell comes with essential formatting applied to it: the font and font size to use and 
usually the  General number format  , which you’ll meet shortly. So when you create a new 
workbook and start entering data in it, Excel displays the data in a normal-size font. 
 Understanding the Two Main Tools for Applying Formatting 
 Excel gives you two main tools for applying formatting to cells and ranges:
  Home tab of the Ribbon : The Font group provides widely used font 
formatting; the Alignment group offers horizontal and vertical alignment, 
orientation, indentation, wrapping, and merging; and the Number group 
gives you a quick way to apply essential number formatting. Figure  13-5 
shows the Font group with its controls labeled. Figure  13-6 shows the 
Alignment group and Number group with their controls labeled.  
 Tip   To control the font and font size Excel uses for new workbooks, choose Excel ➤ Preferences 
or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key). Click the General icon in the Authoring area of the Excel 
Preferences window to display the General preferences pane. Open the Default font pop-up menu, and 
click the font you want. The Body Font choice at the top of the list gives you the body font set in the 
workbook’s template; if you change this font, you change the font used in all the styles except the Title 
style (which uses the Heading font). Then choose the size in the Size pop-up menu. Close the Preferences 
window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 Figure 13-5.   You can quickly apply essential font formatting, borders, and fills from the Font group on the Home tab of 
the Ribbon  
 

360
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Format Cells dialog box : When you need to apply formatting types 
that don’t appear on the Home tab of the Ribbon, open the Format 
Cells dialog box and work on its six tabs, which you’ll meet later in this 
chapter. The easiest way to display the Format Cells dialog box is to 
Ctrl-click or right-click a cell or a selection and then click Format Cells 
on the context menu. You can also open the Format Cells dialog box by 
pressing Cmd+1 or choosing Format ➤ Cells from the menu bar.  
 Controlling How Data Appears by Applying  Number 
Formatting  
 When you enter a number in a cell, Excel displays it according to the  number formatting  
applied to that cell. For example, if you enter  42524 in a cell formatted with General 
formatting, Excel displays it as 42524. If the cell has Currency formatting, Excel displays a 
value such as $42,524.00 (depending on the details of the format). And if the cell has Date 
formatting, Excel displays a date such as 3 June 2016 (again, depending on the details of the 
format). In each case, the number stored in the cell remains the same—so if you change the 
cell’s formatting to a different type, the way that Excel displays the data changes to match. 
 Figure 13-6.   From the Alignment group on the  Home tab of the Ribbon , you can set horizontal and vertical alignment, 
orientation, and wrapping. From the Number group, you can apply number formatting 
 Note   When the Excel window is small, the buttons in the Alignment group appear in three rows 
rather than the two rows shown here. 
 

361
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Table  13-1 explains Excel’s number formats and tells you the keyboard shortcuts for 
applying them. You can also apply number formatting by using the buttons on the Number 
Format pop-up menu and buttons in the Number group of the Home tab of the Ribbon and 
by using the controls on the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure  13-7 ).

CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Understanding How Excel Stores Dates and Times 
 Excel stores dates as serial numbers starting from 1 (Sunday, January 1, 1900) and running 
way into the future. To give you a couple of points of reference, Sunday, January 1, 2017 is 
42736, and Monday, January 1, 2018 is 43101. 
 You can enter a date by typing the  serial number  (if you know it or care to work it out), but 
it’s much easier to type a date in a conventional format because Excel recognizes most of 
them. For example, if you type  1/1/2017 , Excel converts it to 42736 and displays the date in 
whichever format you’ve chosen. 
 Excel stores times as decimal parts of a day. For example, 42736.25 is 6 a.m. (one quarter of 
the way through the day) on January 1, 2017. 
 Older versions of Excel used the starting date January 2, 1904, by default for workbooks. 
Excel 2016 doesn’t do this, but you can set the 1904 starting date manually if necessary 
(for example, if you’re using an older workbook with 1904-based dates). To switch to 
1904-based dates, choose Excel ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key). 
In the Excel Preferences window, click the Calculation icon in the Formulas and Lists area to 
display the Calculation preferences pane. In the When Calculating Workbooks area, select 
the “Use the 1904 date system” check box, and then click the Close button at the left end of 
the title bar or press Cmd+W to close the Excel Preferences window. 
 Setting the Workbook’s Overall Look by Applying a  Theme  
 To control the overall look of a workbook, apply a suitable theme to it by choosing Page 
Layout ➤ Themes ➤ Themes from the Ribbon and then clicking the theme you want on the 
Themes panel. 
 The theme applies a set of colors and a pair of fonts to the workbook. After applying the 
theme, you can change the colors or fonts by using the Colors pop-up menu or the Fonts 
pop-up menu in the Themes group on the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon.  
 Setting Alignment 
 You can quickly align the contents of cells by using the buttons in the  Alignment  group on 
the Home tab of the Ribbon or the controls on the Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog 
box (see Figure  13-8 ):
  Horizontal alignment : You can align the text Left (Indent), Center, Right, 
or Justify; apply General alignment, which depends on the data type (left 
for text, right for numbers); choose Center Across Selection to center 
the text across multiple cells; or choose Distributed to distribute the text 
across the cell (using wider spaces between words).  
 Note   The Fill horizontal alignment fills the cell with the character you specify. 

364
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Vertical alignment : You can align text as Top, Center, Bottom, or Justify. 
You can also choose Distributed to distribute the text vertically, which 
can be useful when you rotate the text so that it runs vertically.  
  Indent : You can indent the text as far as is needed. Either enter the 
indentation amount in the Indent box on the Alignment tab of the Format 
Cells dialog box or choose Home ➤ Alignment ➤ Increase Indent from 
the Ribbon. Excel uses a standard character width (about the width of a 
lowercase  n character) for each indent increment.  
  Change text orientation : In the Orientation box on the Alignment tab 
of the Format Cells dialog box, you can click the left box to apply 
vertical orientation, click the appropriate point on the dotted arc to 
apply approximate orientation, or type the exact number of degrees in 
the Degrees box. Alternatively, use the Orientation pop-up menu in the 
Alignment group.  
  Wrap text : In the Text control area, select the Wrap text check box. 
You can wrap the text to make a long entry appear on several lines 
in a cell rather than disappear where the next cell’s contents start. 
The disadvantage to wrapping text is that the row height increases 
 Figure 13-8.   The Alignment tab of the Format Cells dialog box lets you rotate text to precise angles when needed 
 

365
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
automatically to accommodate the wrapped text. (If you set a specific 
row height that’s less than the height needed to display all the wrapped 
text, only the text that fits appears in the cell.)  
  Shrink to fit : Also in the Text control area, select this check box to shrink 
the text so that it fits in the cell. Shrinking works well when the text is 
only a bit too big for the cell. If the text is much too big, shrinking makes 
it unreadably small.  
  Merge cells : Use the Merge & Center pop-up menu in the Alignment 
group to merge selected cells together into a single cell. You can also 
center an entry across a merged cell. In the Format Cells dialog box, 
you can merge cells by selecting the Merge cells check box in the Text 
control area on the Alignment tab.  
 Choosing  Font Formatting 
 You can quickly format the contents of a cell (or the selected part of a cell’s contents) by 
using the controls in the Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon or the Font tab of the 
Format Cells dialog box (see Figure  13-9 ). See the “Applying Direct Formatting to Text and 
Objects” section in Chapter   3 for information on this type of formatting.  
 Figure 13-9.   The Font tab of the Format Cells dialog box gives you a full range of font formatting for the current 
selection 
 

366
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Applying Borders and Fills 
 To apply  borders  to a cell, open the Borders pop-up menu in the Font group on the Home 
tab of the Ribbon, and then click the border type you want (see Figure  13-10 ).  
 Figure 13-10.   You can quickly apply borders from the Borders pop-up menu in the Font group of the Home tab. You can 
also draw a border or a border grid with the pointer  
 

367
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 For more border options, click the More Borders item at the bottom of the Borders pop-up 
menu to display the Border tab of the Format Cells dialog box (see Figure  13-11 ). You 
can also choose Format ➤ Cells from the menu bar (or press Cmd+1) and then click the 
Border tab. Use the controls on the Border tab to set up the borders you want. For example, 
to apply a heavy bottom border, click a dark line in the Line Style box, and then click the 
Bottom Border button in the Border box. Then click the OK button.  
 Note   The options in the Draw Borders section of the Borders pop-up menu enable you to draw 
borders on and around cells by dragging the pointer across the worksheet. For example, you can 
open the Borders pop-up menu, click Draw Border Grid, and then drag across the cells to which you 
want to apply the grid. You can then open the Borders pop-up menu again, click Erase Border, and 
use the pointer to erase any borders you don’t need within the grid you’ve applied. Press Esc to turn 
off the current tool. Depending on the type of table you need to create, this can be a quicker way of 
working than selecting the cells and then applying the border formatting. 
 Figure 13-11.   Use the Border tab of the Format Cells dialog box when you need to change the line style or color of borders 
 

368
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 To apply a fill, use the Fill Colors pop-up menu in the Font group on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon or work on the  Fill tab  of the Format Cells dialog box. The controls on the Fill tab are 
straightforward to use:
  Background color : To apply a background color to the cell or the 
selection, open this pop-up menu and select the color.  
  Pattern color : To apply a pattern to the cell or the selection, open this 
pop-up menu and select the color for the pattern.  
  Pattern style : After selecting the pattern color you want, open this pop-
up menu and select the style for the pattern. The Sample area in the 
lower half of the Fill tab shows how the pattern looks with the color and 
style you’ve selected.  
 When you’ve made your choices on the Fill tab, click the OK button to close the Format 
Cells dialog box and apply them.  
 Applying Protection to Cells 
 The  Protection tab  of the Format Cells dialog box contains only two controls:
  Locked : Select this check box to lock a cell against changes.  
  Hidden : Select this check box to hide the formula in a cell (the formula’s 
result remains visible).  
 After selecting either of these check boxes, you must protect the worksheet before the 
locking or hiding takes effect. You’ll learn how to protect a worksheet in the “Protecting a 
Worksheet” section later in this chapter.  
 Applying Conditional Formatting to Identify Particular 
Values 
 In many worksheets, it’s useful to be able to monitor the values in the cells and to pick 
out values that stand out in particular ways. For example, you may want to see which ten 
products are bringing in the most revenue, or you may need an easy way to make unusually 
high values or unusually low values stand out from the others. 
 To monitor the values in a cell or a range, you can apply   conditional formatting —formatting 
that Excel displays only when the condition is met. For example, if you’re monitoring 
temperatures in Fahrenheit, you could apply conditional formatting to highlight low 
temperatures (say, below 20F) and high temperatures (say, above 100F). Temperatures in the 
normal range would not receive any conditional formatting so the low temperatures and high 
temperatures would jump out on the worksheet. 

369
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Understanding Excel’s Preset Types of Conditional Formatting 
 Excel provides five kinds of preset conditional formatting, which you can apply from the 
Conditional Formatting panel in the Styles group of the Home tab of the Ribbon. Figure  13-12 
shows the Conditional Formatting panel with the Icon Sets panel displayed. 
  Highlight cells rules : This panel gives you an easy way to set up 
conditional formatting using Greater Than, Less Than, Between, Equal 
To, Text that Contains, A Date Occurring, or Duplicate Values criteria.  
  Top/bottom rules : This panel lets you apply conditional formatting 
for Top 10 Items, Top 10 %, Bottom 10 Items, Bottom 10 %, Above 
Average, and Below Average criteria.  
  Data bars : This panel enables you to apply different gradient fills and 
solid fills.  
 Figure 13-12.   The Conditional Formatting panel includes sets of icons you can apply to indicate data trends 
 

370
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Color scales : This panel lets you set up color scales using two or three 
colors; for example, using green, amber, and red to indicate different 
levels of risk associated with activities.  
  Icon sets : This panel provides different sets of icons, such as directional 
arrows (up, sideways, down) or a checkmark/exclamation point/cross 
set for indicating data trends.  
 Applying a Preset Form of Conditional Formatting 
 To apply one of these types of conditional formatting, open the Conditional Formatting 
panel, display the appropriate panel from it, click the type of formatting, and then specify the 
details. For example,
 1. 
 Select the cell or range you want to affect.  
 2. 
 Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Conditional Formatting ➤ Highlight 
Cells Rules ➤ Greater Than from the Ribbon to display the New 
Formatting Rule dialog box (see Figure  13-13 ). 
 3. 
 In the Style pop-up menu, you can choose a different style for the 
conditional formatting if you want. Excel automatically selects the 
style that suits the type of conditional formatting you chose; in the 
example, it’s Classic.  
 4. 
 The Comparison pop-up menu below the Style pop-up menu shows 
the comparison for the type of conditional formatting; in the example, 
it’s “Format only cells that contain.” You can choose a different 
comparison if necessary, but you won’t normally need to do so.  
 Figure 13-13.   Excel’s preset conditional formatting types make it easy to apply conditional formatting to cells quickly 
 

371
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 5. 
 On the next line of controls, set up the comparison. In the example, 
the first pop-up menu is set to Cell value, and the second pop-up 
menu is set to “greater than” because this is a Greater Than rule. In 
the third box, you enter the comparison. You can either type in the 
value or collapse the dialog box, click the cell that contains the value, 
and then restore the dialog box.  
 6. 
 In the Format with pop-up menu, choose the formatting you want. 
Excel provides various canned options, but you can also create 
custom formatting by clicking the custom format item at the bottom 
of the list and working in the Format Cells dialog box that opens. (This 
is a cut-down version of the Format Cells dialog box you met earlier in 
the chapter; it has only the Font tab, the Border tab, and the Fill tab.)  
 7. 
 Click the OK button to close the New Formatting Rule dialog box. 
Excel applies the conditional formatting.  
 Using Data Validation to Check for Invalid Entries 
 When you’re entering large amounts of data, it’s easy to type an incorrect value by mistake. 
To help avoid errors in your data, you can use Excel’s data validation feature to check entries 
automatically and flag those that may be wrong. For example, if every entry in a range of 
cells should be between 250 and 1000 (inclusive), you can validate the data to flag any entry 
that is not in that range. 
 To apply validation to cells, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the cell or select the range you want to validate.  
 2. 
 Choose Data ➤ Data Tools ➤ Data Validation (clicking the main part 
of the Validate button) from the Ribbon or Data ➤ Validation from the 
menu bar to display the  Data Validation dialog box  . 
 3. 
 Click the  Settings tab  (shown in Figure  13-14 with settings chosen) to 
bring it to the front of the dialog box if it’s not already there.  
 Note   If none of the preset conditional formatting rules meets your needs, you can define 
conditional formatting rules of your own. To do so, choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Conditional 
Formatting ➤ New Rule, and then work in the New Formatting Rule dialog box that opens. 
 Caution   Data validation works only when the user types in a value. If the user pastes in a value, 
Excel doesn’t check it.

CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 4. 
 In the  Allow pop-up menu  , choose the type of data you want to 
validate, and then use the controls that appear to set the details.
  Any value : Select this item when you want to turn off validation for 
the cell or range. Even with this setting, you can use the Input 
Message tab (discussed later in this list) to display a message about 
the cell or range. 
  Whole number : Select this item to set criteria for a whole number: 
one with no decimal places. For example, in the Data pop-up menu, 
click the between item, and then set the minimum value in the 
Minimum box and the maximum value in the Maximum box.  
  Decimal : Select this item to set criteria for a number with decimal 
places. For example, in the Data pop-up menu, click the greater 
than or equal to item, and then set the minimum value in the 
Minimum box.  
 Tip When setting the criteria for your data validation, you can either type in a value or click the 
Collapse Dialog button and then click the cell that contains the value. Using a value in a cell enables 
you to change the value easily without editing the conditional formatting.
 Figure 13-14.   Set up the validation criteria on the Settings tab of the Data Validation dialog box. The controls that 
appear depend on the data type you choose in the Allow pop-up menu  
 

373
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  List : Select this item when you need to restrict the cell to a list of 
valid entries that you specify. You can enter this list in two ways: 
either type it in the Source box, separating each entry with a 
comma, or click the Collapse Dialog button at the right end of the 
Source box, select the worksheet range that contains the data, and 
then click the Collapse Dialog button again to restore the dialog 
box. Select the In-cell drop-down check box to make Excel display 
a pop-up menu with the valid entries in the cell so that the user can 
enter one of those valid entries easily.  
  Date : Select this item to set criteria for a date. For example, click the 
Greater than item in the Data pop-up menu, and then enter the start 
date in the Start date box.  
  Time : Select this item to set criteria for a time. For example, click the 
Not between item in the Data pop-up menu, and then enter the start 
time in the Start time box and the end time in the End time box.  
  Text length : Select this item to set criteria for a text entry or formula. 
For example, click the Less than or equal to item in the Data pop-up 
menu, and then enter the maximum length in the Maximum box.  
  Custom : Select this item when you need to enter a formula that 
returns a logical value of TRUE or FALSE.  
 5. 
 Select the  Ignore blank check box  if you want to let the user leave 
the cell blank. Clear this check box to make the user fill in the cell 
with valid data.

 Select the “Show error alert after invalid data is entered” check box 
if you want Excel to display an error message box when the user 
enters invalid data. This is usually helpful.  
 

375
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 10. 
 In the  Style pop-up menu  , choose the icon type for the behavior 
you want:
  Stop : The error dialog box has a Retry button and a Cancel button. 
If the user clicks the Retry button, Excel selects the entry that failed 
validation so that the user can change it. If the user clicks the 
Cancel button, Excel restores the cell’s previous entry. 
  Warning : The error dialog box ends with a “Continue?” prompt after 
your message. On Windows, the error dialog box has a Yes button, 
a No button, and a Cancel button; on OS X, the error dialog box has 
a Yes button and a No button. If the user clicks the Yes button, Excel 
accepts the value, even though it has failed validation. If the user 
clicks the No button, Excel selects the entry that failed validation 
so that the user can change it. If the user clicks the Cancel button, 
Excel restores the cell’s previous entry.  
  Information : The error dialog box has an OK button and a Cancel 
button on Windows and only an OK button on OS X. If the user 
clicks the OK button, Excel accepts the value, even though it has 
failed validation. On Windows, if the user clicks the Cancel button, 
Excel restores the cell’s previous entry.  
 11. 
 Enter the title and error message for the message box.  
 12. 
 Click the OK button to close the Data Validation dialog box. Excel 
applies the validation.  
 Formatting Quickly with Table Formatting and Styles 
 To save you time with formatting, Excel provides preset formatting that you can apply to a 
table to give it an overall look. And to save you the effort of applying many different types of 
formatting over and over again to different cells, Excel includes styles, which are collections 
of formatting that you can apply all at once. 
 Note  On Windows, the Stop, Warning, and Information settings in the Style pop-up menu make 
the error message box show the different icons that appear under the Style pop-up menu when you 
make your choice. For example, the Stop style shows the red circle bearing a white cross that you 
see on the left in Figure  13-16 . On OS X, the error message box displays the same Excel icon (shown 
on the right in Figure  13-16 ) for each style, but with different command buttons and behavior.
 Tip  To force the user to enter valid data, choose the Stop item in the Style pop-up menu on the 
Error Alert tab of the Data Validation dialog box. The Warning style and the Information style can be 
useful for when you’re providing gentler guidance on how to use the worksheet and the conformity 
of the data is less critical. 

376
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Formatting with  Table Formatting  
 When you need to format a table quickly, see if Excel’s preset table formatting will do the 
trick. Select the table, choose Table ➤ Table Styles ➤ Table Styles from the Ribbon, and 
then click the style you want. 
 Formatting with Styles 
 As you saw earlier in this chapter, you can give any cell exactly the formatting you want 
by using the controls in the Font group, Alignment group, and Number group of the Home 
tab of the Ribbon or by opening the Format Cells dialog box and working on its tabs. But 
applying formatting one aspect at a time—font, font size, alignment, and so on—takes ages, 
and it’s easy to apply formatting inconsistently. 
 To save time and ensure your formatting is consistent, you can use Excel’s styles. If you’re 
familiar with Word’s styles (discussed in Chapter   7 ), you’ll find Excel’s styles a snap because 
they work in much the same way. 
 Each style is a collection of formatting that you can apply to one or more cells. The style 
contains six types of formatting, one for each tab of the  Format Cells dialog box  :
  Number : For example, General, Currency, or Percentage.  
  Alignment : Horizontal alignment (for example, General, Center, or 
Justify), vertical alignment (for example, Top, Center, or Bottom), and 
any trimmings (such as wrapping the text inside the cell).  
  Font : The font, font size, font color, and so on.  
  Border : Any borders you’ve applied to the style, or No Borders if it has 
no borders.  
  Fill : Any fill you’ve applied to the style, or No Shading if it’s plain.  
  Protection : Locked, Hidden, both, or No Protection.  
 Most Excel templates contain plenty of styles to get you started, but you can create your 
own custom styles as well if necessary. 
 Meeting Excel’s Styles 
 To see which styles are available in a workbook, choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles and look 
at the  Cell Styles panel  (see Figure  13-17 ). This panel lists the styles in the following categories:
  Custom : This category appears only when you have created one or 
more custom styles in the workbook.  
 Note   See Chapter   16  for instructions on creating and working with Excel tables. 

377
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Good, Bad, and Neutral : This category contains Good, Bad, and Neutral 
styles that you can use to apply color coding to cells. Here is also where 
you will find the Normal style that Excel applies to any cell that doesn’t 
have another style.  
  Data and Model : This category contains the Calculation, Check Cell, 
Explanatory, Followed Hyperlink, Hyperlink, Input, Linked Cell, Note, 
Output, and Warning Text styles. Most of these styles are used for data 
modeling. Excel automatically applies the Hyperlink style to cells 
containing hyperlinks you have not clicked yet, changing their style to 
Followed Hyperlink once you have clicked them.  
  Titles and Headings : This category contains four styles for descending 
levels of headings (Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Heading 4), 
the Title style for giving a worksheet a title, and the Total style for easily 
formatting cells that contain totals.  
 Note   The Hyperlink style appears in the Data and Model category in the Styles panel only if the 
workbook contains hyperlinks. Similarly, the Followed Hyperlink style appears only if the workbook 
contains hyperlinks you’ve followed. 
 Figure 13-17.   The Styles panel displays your custom styles at the top and Excel’s built-in styles in different categories 
 

378
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Themed Cell Styles : This category contains six Accent styles (Accent 1 
through Accent 6) featuring six of the theme colors, with four degrees of 
shading for each. This category appears only if the workbook’s template 
contains themed cell styles.  
  Number Format : This category contains styles for number formats such 
as Comma, Comma [0], Currency, Currency [0], and Percent . 
 Applying a Style 
 To  apply  a style, choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles from the Ribbon, and then click 
the style on the Styles panel. You can also apply the various Number styles (such as the 
Currency styles, the Percent style, and the Comma style) from the Number group on the 
Home tab of the Ribbon.  
 Creating Custom  Styles  
 If none of Excel’s styles meets your needs, you can create your own styles. To create a style, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Format a cell with the formatting you want the style to have.  
 2. 
 Select the cell you’ve formatted.  
 3. 
 Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles ➤ New Cell Style from the 
Ribbon to display the New Cell Style dialog box (shown in Figure  13-18  
with settings chosen).  
 Tip   To jump-start your formatting, apply the existing style that’s nearest to the look and formatting 
you want. Then change the formatting so that it looks the way you want. 
 Figure 13-18.   In the New Cell Style dialog box, you can quickly create a new style based on the formatting of the selected 
cell. You can change the formatting as needed by clicking the Format button and working in the Format Cells dialog box  
 

379
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 4. 
 In the Style name box, type the name you want to give the style.  
 5. 
 In the “The selected style has formatting for the following properties” 
area, clear the check boxes for any formatting the cell has that you 
want to omit from the style. For example, clear the Protection check 
box to leave out the Locked or Hidden formatting.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the New Cell Style dialog box and 
create the style. Excel adds the style to the Custom area at the top of 
the Styles panel.  
 Copying Styles from One Workbook to Another 
 If you have styles in one workbook that you want to use in another workbook, you can  copy  
the styles across. Excel calls this  merging styles or  importing styles . When you merge the 
styles, the destination workbook receives all the styles from the source workbook—you can’t 
pick and choose (but see the nearby Tip). 
 To import the styles, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the source workbook (the workbook that contains the styles) 
and the destination workbook.  
 2. 
 Switch to the destination workbook by clicking in it.  
 3. 
 Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles ➤ Merge Styles from the 
Ribbon to display the Import Cell Styles dialog box (see Figure  13-19 ).  
 Note  If you need to alter the formatting, click the Format button to display the Format Cells dialog 
box. Make the changes needed, and then click the OK button to return to the New Cell Style 
dialog box. 
 Tip  Instead of creating a new style, you can modify one of the built-in styles. Choose Home 
➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles from the Ribbon to display the Styles panel, Ctrl-click or right-click the 
style you want to change, and then click the Modify item on the context menu. In the Modify Cell 
Style dialog box, select or clear the check boxes in the “The selected style has formatting for the 
following properties” area, or click the Format button to display the Format Cells dialog box, and 
make the changes you need. When you have finished, click the OK button to return to the Modify 
Cell Style dialog box, and then click the OK button. 

380
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 4. 
 In the Copy cell styles from an open workbook list box, click the 
source workbook.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the import Cell Styles dialog box. Excel 
copies the styles into the destination workbook, and you can then 
start using them.  
 Deleting Styles You Don’t Need 
 If you no longer need a style, you can  delete  it. Choose Home ➤ Styles ➤ Cell Styles from 
the Ribbon, Ctrl-click or right-click the style in the Cell Styles panel, and then click Delete on 
the context menu. 
 Tip  If you need to copy just one style from one workbook to another, apply that style to a cell. 
Then copy that cell and switch back to the destination workbook. Ctrl-click or right-click a cell you 
don’t mind changing, and then click Paste Special to display the Paste Special dialog box. In the 
Paste area, select the Formats option button, and then click the OK button. Excel pastes the style 
onto the cell, and you can then use the style in the workbook. 
 Note   Excel prevents you from deleting the Normal style because it uses this style for any cell that 
doesn’t have another style applied. 
 Figure 13-19.   Use the Import Cell Styles dialog box to copy all the styles from one workbook into another workbook 
 

381
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Adding Headers and Footers to Your Worksheets 
 Before printing a worksheet or creating a PDF file from it, you probably want to add headers, 
footers, or both to identify the pages. Excel gives each worksheet a separate header and 
footer, which you can fill with either preset text or custom text. Each  header and footer area  
consists of a left section, a center section, and a right section, so you can easily add several 
different pieces of information. 
 Excel’s main way to add or edit headers or footers is by working directly on the worksheet. 
To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Text ➤ Header & Footer from the Ribbon. If the 
worksheet is in Normal view, Excel switches automatically to Page 
Layout view. Excel adds the Header & Footer tab to the Ribbon, 
displays its controls, and selects the center section of the header 
(see Figure  13-20 ). 
 Note   Apart from the method shown here, you can also add headers and footers by choosing File 
➤ Page Setup from the menu bar and then working on the Header/Footer tab of the Page Setup 
dialog box. Here, you can create a header either by opening the Header pop-up menu and choosing 
a preset header or by clicking the Custom Header button and working in the Header dialog box. 
Similarly, you can create a footer either by opening the Footer pop-up menu and clicking a preset 
footer or by clicking the Custom Footer button and working in the Footer dialog box. You can also 
select or clear the Different odd and even pages check box, the Different first page check box, the 
Scale with document check box, and the Align with page margins check box, as needed. Click the 
OK button when you’re ready to close the Page Setup dialog box. 
 Figure 13-20.   After giving the Insert  ➤ Text  ➤ Header & Footer command, you can use the controls on the Header & 
Footer tab of the Ribbon to create the header or footer a worksheet needs  
 

382
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 
 2. 
 Click the section of the header you want to change. (If you want to start in 
the center section, you’re all set.) If you want to work in the footer, choose 
Header & Footer ➤ Navigation ➤ Go to Footer to display the footer.  
 3. 
 Add the header or footer by following these techniques:
  Click a button in the Header & Footer Elements group to insert a field 
code (such as &[Date] for the date) or a piece of information (such as 
the sheet name).  
  Type in any text needed.  
  Format the text as needed by selecting it and applying formatting 
from either the Home tab of the Ribbon or the Font tab of the 
Format Cells dialog box.  
 4. 
 In the Options group on the Header & Footer tab of the Ribbon, 
select or clear the four check boxes as needed:
  Different first page : Select this check box to give the worksheet a 
different header or footer on the first page, or to have no header or 
footer on the first page.  
  Different odd & even pages : Select this check box to use different 
headers and footers on the odd pages and the even pages, as you 
might do in in a facing-pages layout.  
  Scale with document : Select this check box (which is normally 
selected by default) to have Excel scale the header and footer with 
the document. This setting is mostly useful for making sure that 
the headers and footers you create for portrait pages don’t look 
absurdly big when you switch the pages to landscape orientation. If 
you scale down a worksheet to make it fit on a sheet of paper, you 
may prefer to keep the headers and footers full size.  
 Note   If you switch to another workbook, Excel closes the header or footer you were editing. 
 Tip   You can insert a preset header by choosing Header & Footer ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Header 
and then clicking the appropriate preset header on the pop-up menu. Similarly, you can insert a 
preset footer by choosing Header & Footer ➤ Header & Footer ➤ Footer and then clicking the 
appropriate preset footer on the pop-up menu. 
 Tip   You can also start editing a header or footer in Page Layout view. Scroll so that you can see 
the “Click to add header” prompt or “Click to add footer” prompt on the sheet you want to change, 
and then click the prompt. Excel adds the Header & Footer tab to the Ribbon, but you need to click 
the tab to display its controls. 

383
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Align with page margins : Select this check box (which also is 
normally selected by default) to have Excel align the headers and 
footers with the page margins. This type of alignment works well for 
many worksheets; if not, you can override it easily.  
 5. 
 When you have finished creating or editing the header or footer, click 
a cell in the worksheet to close the header or footer. You can then 
click the Normal View button on the status bar if you want to switch 
back to Normal view.  
 Printing Your Excel Worksheets and Workbooks 
 To print from Excel, you use the Print dialog box, as with the other applications. But before 
you print, you need to tell Excel which part of the workbook to print. You may also want to 
check the page setup to make sure the page breaks fall where you want them to fall. 
 Telling Excel Which Part of the Worksheet to Print 
 As you learned earlier in this chapter, each worksheet contains billions of cells, so normally 
you don’t want to print the whole worksheet; you want to print only the range of cells you’ve 
used, or perhaps only a small subset of that range. So when you’re printing, the first thing to 
do is tell Excel which part of the worksheet you want to print. Excel calls this setting the print 
area. You can set a separate print area for each worksheet. 
 To set the  print area, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the worksheet whose print area you want to set.  
 2. 
 Select the range of cells you want to print.  
 3. 
 Choose File ➤ Page Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Print Area ➤ Set Print 
Area from the Ribbon or File ➤ Print Area ➤ Set Print Area from the 
menu bar. Excel displays a dotted blue line around the print area to 
indicate that it is set.  
 Caution   Until you set the print area, Excel assumes you want to print all the cells you’ve used on 
the worksheet—even if there are huge amounts of blank space between them. So, it’s a good idea 
always to set the print area before printing. 
 Note   When you create a print area that consists of multiple ranges of cells, the ranges don’t need 
to be contiguous. Excel prints each separate range on a separate page. 

384
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 If you need to change the print area altogether, select a new range of cells, and then choose 
File ➤ Page Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Print Area ➤ Set Print Area from the Ribbon or File ➤ 
Print Area ➤ Set Print Area again from the menu bar. 
 If you need to clear the print area so that the worksheet has no print area set, click the 
worksheet, and then choose File ➤ Page Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Print Area ➤ Clear Print 
Area from the Ribbon or File ➤ Print Area ➤ Clear Print Area from the menu bar.  
 Checking the Page Layout and Where the Page Breaks Fall 
 After setting the print area, check the  page layout  of the worksheet and adjust it as needed. 
Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Switch to Page Layout view by clicking the Page Layout View button 
toward the right end of the status bar or choosing View ➤ Page 
Layout from the menu bar.  
 2. 
 Click the Page Layout tab of the Ribbon to show its controls. 
Figure  13-21 shows a worksheet in Page Layout view with the Page 
Layout tab displayed.  
 Figure 13-21.   To see a worksheet’s pages laid out, switch to Page Layout view. You can then use the controls on the 
Page Layout tab of the Ribbon to refine the layout  
 

385
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 3. 
 Use the controls in the Page Setup group to change the page setup 
as needed:
  Change the margins : Open the Margins pop-up menu, and then 
click Normal, Wide, or Narrow. For greater control, click Custom 
Margins, work on the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box, and 
then click the OK button.  
  Change the orientation : Open the Orientation pop-up menu, and 
then click Portrait or Landscape.  
  Change the paper size : Open the Size pop-up menu, and then click the 
paper size.  
  Set or clear the print area : Open the Print Area pop-up menu, and 
then click Set Print Area or Clear Print Area.  
  Insert a page break : Click the column before which you want to insert 
a manual page break. Open the Breaks pop-up menu, and then click 
Insert Page Break.  
 When you have finished laying out the pages, it’s a good idea to save the workbook—for 
example, click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, or press Cmd+S—to store the 
print settings.  
 Printing a Worksheet or Workbook 
 After you’ve set the print area for each worksheet you want to print, you can print a 
worksheet or  workbook  like this:
 1. 
 If you want to print anything less than a whole workbook, choose 
what you want to print:
  Print a worksheet : Make that worksheet active. For example, click its 
worksheet tab.  
  Print multiple worksheets : Make all those worksheets active by 
selecting their worksheet tabs.  
  Selection of cells : Select the cells.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Print from the menu bar or press Cmd+P to display the 
Print dialog box. If the Print dialog box opens at its smaller size, click 
the Show Details button to expand the dialog box to its larger size.  
 Note  If you put a page break in the wrong place, click the column after it, and then choose Page 
Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Breaks ➤ Remove Page Break from the Ribbon. To restore all page breaks 
to where Excel had placed them, choose Page Layout ➤ Page Setup ➤ Breaks ➤ Reset All Page 
Breaks from the Ribbon. 
 Tip   If you need to print frequently, put the Print icon on the Quick Access Toolbar for instant access. 

386
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 3. 
 In the Print pop-up menu, choose what to print:
  Selection : Select this option to print only the cells you’ve selected. 
This option is useful for printing smaller amounts without resetting 
the print area.  
  Active sheets : Select this option to print the active worksheet 
(if you’ve selected only one) or active worksheets (if you selected 
more than one).  
  Entire workbook : Select this option to print every worksheet in the 
workbook. Normally, you use this option only for small workbooks.  
 4. 
 Check that the preview of the printout looks right. If you need to 
change the scaling to make the printout fit the paper better, select 
the Scale to fit check box, and then set the number of pages in the 
 N page(s) wide box and the by  N page(s) tall box. For example, you 
might choose 1 page(s) wide by 2 page(s) tall.  
 5. 
 Click the Print button to print your selection.  
 Sharing Your Workbooks with Your Colleagues 
 You may create some workbooks on your own, but for others, you probably need to work 
with colleagues to collect, enter, and analyze data. You can either share a workbook on the 
network so that one person can work on it at a time or turn on Excel’s sharing features that 
enable you and your colleagues to work on the workbook at the same time. 
 Before sharing a workbook, you may choose to protect it with a password or to allow your 
colleagues to make only some types of changes to it. 
 Protecting a Workbook or Some of Its Worksheets 
 Before sharing a workbook with your colleagues for editing individually on a network, you 
may want to restrict the changes your colleagues can make in the workbook or on some of 
its worksheets. Excel calls this  protecting the workbook or worksheets. 
 Protecting a Workbook 
 To protect a workbook, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ Protect Workbook from the Ribbon 
or Tools ➤ Protection ➤ Protect Workbook from the menu bar to 
display the dialog box shown in Figure  13-22 . 

387
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 2. 
 Select the Structure check box to prevent your colleagues from 
inserting, deleting, or otherwise changing whole worksheets.  
 3. 
 Select the Windows check box only if you need to prevent your 
colleagues from changing the number or sizes of windows that 
you’re using for the workbook. Normally, you don’t need to do this if 
your colleagues will work conventionally in the workbook.  
 4. 
 Type a password in the Password text box and in the Verify text box.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the dialog box.  
 6. 
 Save the workbook. For example, click the Save button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar or press Cmd+S.  
 Protecting a Worksheet 
 When you need to limit the changes your colleagues can make to a particular  worksheet  , 
apply protection to it. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the worksheet to activate it.  
 2. 
 Choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ Protect Sheet from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Protection ➤ Protect Sheet from the menu bar to display 
the Protect the sheet and contents of locked cells sheet (shown in 
Figure  13-23 with settings chosen).  
 Note  To unprotect a workbook, choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ Protect Workbook from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Protection ➤ Unprotect Workbook from the menu bar. Excel displays a dialog box prompting 
you for the password. Type it, and then click the OK button. Save the changes to the workbook.  
 Figure 13-22.   When protecting a  workbook , you normally want to protect the structure but not the windows 
 

388
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 3. 
 Type a password in the Password text box and the Verify text box.  
 4. 
 In the Allow users of this sheet to box, select each check box for 
actions you want your colleagues to be able to take. Clear each other 
check box.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button. Excel closes the sheet and applies the 
protection.  
 6. 
 Save the workbook. For example, press Cmd+S or click the Save 
button on the Quick Access Toolbar.  
 Sharing  a Workbook So That Your Colleagues Can Edit It 
 When you need to be able to share a workbook with your colleagues, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook.  
 2. 
 Choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ Share Workbook from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Share Workbook from the menu bar to display the Share 
Workbook dialog box. The left screen in Figure  13-24 shows the 
Editing tab of the Share Workbook dialog box, which is where you 
start the sharing process.  
 Figure 13-23.   Protect a worksheet when you need to prevent your colleagues from making specific types of changes to it

CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 3. 
 Select the “Allow changes by more than one user at the same time” 
check box on the Editing tab.  
 4. 
 Check the “Who has this workbook open now” list box. It should 
show only your name and should include the word  Exclusive to 
indicate that you’ve got sole access to the workbook.  
 5. 
 Click the Advanced tab to display its contents (shown on the right in 
Figure  13-24 ). 
 6. 
 In the Track Changes area, choose how long to keep the change 
history for the workbook:
  Normally, you want to select the “Keep change history for option 
button and set the number of days in the days” check box.  
  The default setting is 30 days, but if you develop your workbooks 
quickly, you may want to reduce the interval to 7 days or 14 days to 
prevent Excel from keeping large amounts of history you don’t need.  
  The alternative is to select the “Don’t keep change history” option 
button, but usually it’s best to keep change history so that you can 
unravel any mysterious changes.  
 7. 
 In the Update changes area, choose when to update the changes to 
the workbook:
  The default setting is the “When file is saved” option button, which 
generally works pretty well.  
 Figure 13-24.   On the Editing tab (left) of the Share Workbook dialog box, select the “Allow changes by more than one 
user at the same time” check box. You can then choose options on the Advanced tab (right) 
 

390
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  The alternative is to select the Automatically every option button and 
set the number of minutes in the minutes box. The default setting is 
15 minutes; if you work fast, you may want to shorten the interval to 
5 or 10 minutes.  
  If you select the Automatically every option button, you can choose 
between the “Save my changes and see others’ changes” option 
button (usually the better choice) and the “Just see other users’ 
changes” option button.  
 8. 
 In the “Conflicting change between users” area, choose how to handle 
conflicting changes to the workbook. Normally, you want to select the 
“Ask me which changes win” option button so that you can decide 
which of the conflicting changes to keep. The alternative is to select 
the option button called “The changes being saved win,” which tells 
Excel to overwrite the conflicting changes with the latest changes.  
 9. 
 In the Include in Personal View area, select the Print settings check 
box if you want to include print settings in your view of the workbook. 
Select the Filter settings check box if you want to include filter settings. 
(See Chapter   16 for instructions on filtering an Excel database table.)  
 10. 
 Click the OK button to close the Share Workbook dialog box. Excel 
sets up the sharing and adds “[Shared]” to the workbook’s title bar 
so that you can easily see it’s shared.  
 Working in a Shared Workbook 
 Once you’ve shared a workbook or someone else has shared it, you can perform basic 
editing in it much as normal. You can enter data and formulas in cells or edit their existing 
contents, format cells, and use both drag and drop and cut, copy, and paste. You can also 
insert rows, columns, and even whole worksheets. 
 Beyond these basics, Excel prevents you from making changes that may cause problems 
with the sharing. These are the main  restrictions  :
  Apply conditional formatting : If your workbook needs conditional 
formatting, apply it before sharing the workbook.  
  Insert objects : You can’t insert pictures, SmartArt, charts, hyperlinks, or 
various other objects.  
  Insert or delete blocks of cells : You can insert or delete a whole row or 
column, but you can’t insert or delete a block of cells. You also can’t 
merge cells together.  
  Delete a worksheet : You can’t delete a worksheet from the shared workbook.  
  Protect a sheet with a password : Any protection you’ve applied before 
sharing the workbook remains in force, but you can’t apply protection to 
a sheet in a shared workbook.  

391
CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
  Outline the workbook : Excel’s advanced capabilities include creating 
a collapsible outline from a worksheet. (This book does not cover 
outlining.) You can’t create an outline in a shared workbook.  
 Resolving Conflicts in a Shared Workbook 
 If you chose the “Ask me which changes win” option button when sharing the workbook, 
Excel prompts you to deal with conflicts that arise between the changes you’re saving and 
the changes that your colleagues have already saved. The  Resolve Conflicts dialog box  
(see Figure  13-25 ) takes you through each of the changes in turn, showing the change you 
made and the conflicting change.  
 For each change, you can click the Accept Mine button to accept your change or click the 
Accept Other button to accept your colleague’s change. To clear all the changes at once, 
click the Accept All Mine button or the Accept All Others button. Excel closes the Resolve 
Conflicts dialog box automatically when you’ve finished reviewing the conflicts.  
 Figure 13-25.   When you and another user have changed the same cells, the Resolve Conflicts dialog box walks you 
through each change in turn. You can accept all your changes, all your colleagues’ changes, or some of each

CHAPTER 13: Formatting Your Worksheets
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to apply all of Excel’s most useful types of formatting to a 
worksheet. You now know how to manipulate the worksheet’s rows and columns to make 
it fit your data, how to format cells and ranges, and how to save time and worry by using 
conditional formatting and data validation. 
 You also went through how to format quickly with table formatting and styles, how to give 
your worksheets the headers and footers that printouts need, and how to use page breaks 
to divide a spreadsheet across pages so that they come out right when you print. You also 
know how to control Excel-specific printing features. 
 Finally, you learned to protect worksheets and workbooks against changes, and you now know 
how to share your worksheets with colleagues—and how to resolve the conflicts that often occur. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to turn your data into powerful and persuasive charts. 
Turn the page when you’re ready.

 Chapter 14  
 Creating Powerful and 
Persuasive Charts  
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create powerful charts that present your data clearly and 
persuasively. You’ll also learn how to use sparklines, which are miniature charts that fit inside 
individual cells. 
 We’ll start by going over the essentials of charts, such as the different ways you can place 
them in your workbooks, which components charts have, and which types of charts you can 
create. We’ll then spend most of the chapter looking in detail at how you create a chart from 
your data, lay it out the way you want, and then give it the look it needs—everything from 
displaying or hiding components to formatting components for impact. 
 After that, I’ll show you how to reuse your custom chart formatting by either pasting it 
onto an existing chart or by creating a custom chart template from it. Finally, I’ll show you 
sparklines—what they are, how they work, and how you can make them look them the way 
you want them to. 
 Learning the Essentials of Charts in Excel 
 Before you start creating charts, let’s look at the two ways you can place charts in your 
workbooks, what the different components of charts are called and what they show, and the 
many different types of charts that Excel offers you. 

394
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Understanding Embedded Charts and Chart Sheets 
 In Excel, you can place a chart either on a worksheet (for example, with its data) or on its 
own chart sheet:
  Chart  on a  worksheet : Excel calls a chart on a worksheet an  embedded 
chart because the chart object is embedded in the worksheet. Usually, 
the worksheet is the one that contains the chart’s data, but you 
can embed a chart on a different worksheet if necessary. Create an 
embedded chart when you want to look at the chart alongside its data 
or alongside other information. Figure  14-1 shows an embedded chart.  
  Chart on  chart sheet : Instead of creating an embedded chart, you can 
create a chart on a  chart sheet , which is a separate page in the 
workbook that contains only a chart. Using a chart sheet gives you more 
space to lay out the chart and view it. The chart sheet doesn’t contain 
the source data, but you can add a data table showing the source data 
if you don’t mind sacrificing some of the chart sheet’s space for the 
table. Figure  14-2 shows a chart on a chart sheet without a data table.  
 Figure 14-1.   Create an embedded chart on a worksheet when you want to work on or view the chart alongside its data  
 

395
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Understanding the Components of a Chart 
 Excel’s charts vary widely in looks and use, but most of them use the same set of 
components. Figure  14-3 shows a typical type of chart—a 3-D column chart—of rainfall data 
for six months for seven weather stations, with the main parts of the chart labeled.  
 Note  If you have some sample data you’re ready to try turning into a chart, select the data and 
choose Insert ➤ Charts ➤ Column from the Ribbon, and then click a chart type on the Column 
panel. This will give you a quick column chart that you can experiment with as we go through the 
components of charts. 
 Note   You can change an embedded chart to a chart on its own chart sheet, or a chart on a chart 
sheet to an embedded chart, as needed. You may find it easiest to develop a chart as an embedded 
chart, where you can see the data and modify it as needed, and then move the chart to a chart 
sheet when it’s ready for deployment. 
 Figure 14-2.   Place a chart on its own chart sheet when you want to give it plenty of space 
 

396
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 The following sections discuss the individual components of charts. 
 Chart Area and Plot  Area 
 The  chart area is the whole area occupied by the chart. If the chart has a white background, 
the easiest way to see the extent of the chart area is to click the chart so that Excel displays 
a border around it. 
 The  plot area is the area of the chart that contains the plotted data—in other words, the main 
part of the chart area, excluding the areas occupied by the chart title, the axis titles, and the 
legend (if it appears outside the plot area).  
 Figure 14-3.   This column chart contains most of the  typical elements of Excel charts. The chart area is the whole area 
occupied by the chart, and the plot area is where the data series are plotted.  
 

397
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Chart Axes 
 Most charts have one, two, or three axes:
  Horizontal axis : This is the axis along which the data categories are laid 
out, such as the weather stations in the sample chart. This axis is also 
called the  category axis or the x -axis . 
  Vertical axis : This is the axis along which the data series are laid out. 
This axis is also called the y -axis . 
  Depth axis : In 3-D charts, this is the axis that provides the third 
dimension. This axis is also called the z -axis . 
 Each axis has tick marks that show where the values appear on it.  
 Categories and Data Series 
 The  categories are the  subdivisions of data that appear on the horizontal axis. For example, 
in the sample chart, each weather station is a category. Each month appears in a different 
color for each category, making the difference clearly visible. The legend (which I’ll cover a 
little later in this chapter) shows which color represents which month. 
 The  data series are the sets of data used to create the chart. For example, in the sample 
chart, the data series contain the rainfall measurements.  
 Chart Title and  Axis Titles  
 The  chart title is text that identifies the chart as a whole. Normally, you put the chart title at 
the top of the chart, but you can place it elsewhere if you want. 
 The  horizontal axis title is text that explains what is shown on the horizontal axis, such as the 
weather stations in the sample chart. 
 The  vertical axis title is text that explains what the vertical axis shows, such as the amount of 
rainfall in the sample chart. 
 A 3-D chart can also have a  depth axis title that explains what the depth axis shows. 
 Data Markers, Gridlines, and Data Labels 
 The  data markers are the points on the chart that show where each data point appears. 
Each series typically contains several data markers. Depending on the chart type, the data 
markers may appear as separate points, or they may be linked together. 
 Note   Chart titles and axis titles are optional, so you can include only those your chart needs. 
Generally, people viewing your charts will benefit from having clear chart titles and axis titles. But 
don’t feel obliged to include any element that seems to complicate your charts. Remember the 
saying “if in doubt, leave it out.” 

398
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 To make it easy to see how the data markers relate to the axes, you can add  gridlines to the 
chart, which are lines that run across or up from the data markers. 
 Data labels are text items that display the exact value of data points. You can display data 
labels when viewers need to see the exact figure for each data point rather than judging the 
value from the chart.  
 Legend 
 The  legend  is a key to the data series in the chart. For example, in the sample chart, the 
legend shows which color represents which month: dark blue for January, red for February, 
green for March, and so on. 
 The  legend is an  optional element that you may choose to omit when you feel it is not 
needed. Many charts and chart types benefit from having a legend, but others are 
abundantly clear without a legend.  
 Understanding Excel’s Chart Types and Choosing 
Which to Use 
 Excel enables you to create an impressive variety of different types of charts. Some of the 
charts are widely useful, whereas others are highly specialized. Table  14-1 describes the 
types of charts that Excel provides and suggests typical uses for them. The table lists the 
charts in the same order as Excel’s Insert ➤ Chart submenu on the menu bar; the order in 
the Charts group on the Insert tab of the Ribbon is a little different.  
 Table 14-1.   Excel’s Chart  Types and Suggested Uses 
 Chart Category 
 Description 
 Suggested Uses 
 Column 
 Displays data in vertical bars. 
 Comparing equivalent items (such as sales 
results) or sets of data that change over time 
(such as rainfall). 
 Line 
 Displays each series in a line. 
 Showing evenly spaced values that change 
over time, such as temperatures. 
 Pie 
 Displays a single data series as a 
pie divided up by the contribution 
of each data point. 
 Showing how much each item contributes to 
the whole, such as breaking down expenses 
by department. 
 Bar 
 Displays data in horizontal bars. 
 Comparing similar items or indicating 
progress. 
 Area 
 Displays data as lines but with the 
areas between them shaded. 
 Showing how values have changed over 
time, especially the contribution of different 
data points in the series. 
 XY (Scatter) 
 Displays each data point as a point 
(or cross, or similar marker) on the 
plot area. 
 Showing values sampled at different 
times or that are not directly related to 
each other. 
(continued)

CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Creating, Laying Out, and Formatting a Chart 
 In this section, you’ll look at how to create a chart from your data, lay it out with the 
components and arrangement you want, and apply the most useful types of formatting. 
 Creating a Chart 
 To  create  a chart, you use the commands on the Charts tab of the Ribbon. Follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Select the data you want to chart, including any row or column 
headings needed. For example, click the first cell in the data range, 
and then Shift-click the last cell.  
 Tip  You can create a chart from either a block range or from a range of separate cells. To use 
separate cells, select them as usual—for example, click the first, and then Cmd-click each of the 
others. 
 Note  Earlier versions of Excel, such as Excel 2011 for Mac, offered two other chart categories: the 
Doughnut category and the Bubble category. Excel 2016 brings the Doughnut chart type into the Pie 
category, perhaps because they share a round shape and belong to the same food group, and adds 
the Bubble chart type and the 3D Bubble chart type to the XY (Scatter) category. 
 Chart Category 
 Description 
 Suggested Uses 
 Stock 
 Displays each data series as a 
vertical line or bar indicating three 
or more prices or measurements 
(for example, high, low, and closing 
prices). 
 Showing the daily prices of stocks. Also 
suitable for some scientific data. 
 Surface 
 Displays the data points as a three-
dimensional surface. 
 Comparing two sets of data to find a 
suitable combination of them. 
 Radar 
 Displays the combined values of 
different data series. 
 Showing how the combined values of 
separate data series compare to each 
other; for example, the sales contributions 
of several different products over several 
periods of time. 
Table 14-1. (continued)

400
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 2. 
 Click the Insert tab of the Ribbon to display its contents, and then 
click the appropriate button in the Insert Chart group: Column; Bar; 
Pie; Line; XY (Scatter); Area; or Insert Area, Stock, Surface or Radar 
Chart (the button that shows assorted chart types). For the sample 
chart, you would click the Column button.  
 3. 
 On the panel that opens, click the chart type you want. Figure  14-4 
shows the Column panel, which is one of the most widely useful. For 
the sample chart, you click the 3-D Clustered Column chart type.  
 Excel creates the chart as an embedded chart in the current worksheet, as shown in 
Figure  14-1 . You can then reposition it, resize it, or move it to a chart sheet as follows:
  Reposition the chart : If you want to keep the chart as an embedded 
chart, move the pointer over the chart border so that it turns into a four-
headed arrow, and then drag the chart to where you want it.  
  Resize the chart : Click to select the chart, and then drag one of the 
handles that appear. Drag a corner handle to resize the chart in both 
dimensions; you can Shift-drag to resize the chart proportionally. Drag a 
side handle to resize the chart in only that dimension; for example, drag 
the bottom handle to resize the chart only vertically.  
  Move the chart to a chart sheet : If you want to move the chart to a chart 
sheet, follow the instructions in the next section.  
 When a chart is active, as it is immediately after you insert it, the Chart Design tab and the 
Format tab appear on the Ribbon, as you’ll see later in this chapter. The Chart Design tab is 
active at first.  
 Figure 14-4.   To insert a chart, click the appropriate pop-up button in the Charts group on the Insert tab of the Ribbon, 
and then click the chart type you want 
 

401
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Changing a Chart from an Embedded Chart to a  Chart Sheet  
 You can change a chart from being embedded in a worksheet to being on its own chart 
sheet like this:
 1. 
 Click the chart on the worksheet it’s embedded in.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Location ➤ Move Chart from the Ribbon to 
display the Move Chart dialog box (see Figure  14-5 ). 
 3. 
 Select the New sheet option button.  
 4. 
 Type the name for the new chart sheet in the New sheet text box.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button. Excel creates the new chart sheet and moves 
the chart to it. The chart is still attached to its source data, so if you 
change the data, Excel changes the chart too.  
 Tip  You can also display the Move Chart dialog box by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking the chart and 
then clicking Move Chart on the context menu. You need to Ctrl-click or right-click the chart itself 
rather than one of its components. 
 Note   You can also use the Move Chart dialog box to move a chart from a chart sheet to an 
embedded chart on a worksheet or to move an embedded chart from one worksheet to another. 
 Figure 14-5.   Use the Move Chart dialog box to change a chart from being embedded to being on its own chart sheet 
 

402
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Changing the Chart  Type  
 If you find the chart type you’ve chosen doesn’t work for your data, you can change the 
chart type easily without having to create the chart again from scratch. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Click the Chart Design tab of the Ribbon to display its contents.  
 3. 
 In the Type group, click Change Chart Type to display the Change 
Chart Type panel, click the chart category to display the category’s 
pop-up panel, and then click the chart type.  
 Switching the Rows and Columns in a Chart 
 When Excel  displays  the chart, you may realize that the data series are in the wrong place; 
for example, the chart is displaying months by rainfall instead of rainfall by months. 
 When this happens, there’s a quick fix: switch the rows and columns by choosing Chart 
Design ➤ Data ➤ Switch Row/Column from the Ribbon. Excel displays the chart with the 
series the other way around.  
 Changing the Source  Data for a Chart 
 Sometimes you may find that your chart doesn’t work well with the source data you’ve 
chosen. For example, you may have selected so much data that the chart is crowded, or you 
may have missed a vital row or column. 
 When this happens, you don’t need to delete the chart and start again from scratch. Instead, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Data ➤ Select Data from the Ribbon to 
display the Select Data Source dialog box (see Figure  14-6 ).  

403
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 2. 
 In the Chart data range box, enter the data range you want to use:
  If your Mac has a small screen, it’s easiest to click the Collapse 
Dialog button to collapse the Select Data Source dialog box, drag 
on the worksheet to select the right data range, and then click the 
Collapse Dialog button again to restore the dialog box. (If you have 
plenty of space on screen, you can just work around the Select Data 
Source dialog box instead.)  
  You can also type the data range in the Chart data range box. This 
is easy when you just need to change a column letter or row number 
to fix the data range.  
 3. 
 If you need to switch the rows and columns as well, click the Switch 
Row/Column button.  
 4. 
 If your chart data contains empty cells, open the “Show empty cells 
as” pop-up menu and choose how to represent them. Your choices 
are Gaps (the default setting for most charts) or Zero.  
 Figure 14-6.   Use the Select Data Source dialog box to change the source data the chart is using 
 

404
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 5. 
 Select the “Show data in hidden rows and columns” check box only 
if you want the chart to include data in hidden rows and columns 
within the source range. Normally, you should keep these hidden, but 
it’s sometimes useful to show them.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Select Data Source dialog box. 
Excel applies the changes to the chart.  
 Choosing the  Layout  for the Chart 
 When you’ve sorted out the chart type and the source data, it’s time to choose the layout for 
the chart. For each chart type, Excel provides various preset layouts that control where the 
title, legend, and other elements appear. After applying a layout, you can customize it further 
as needed. 
 To apply a layout, click the chart, choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Quick Layout to 
display the Quick Layout panel (see Figure  14-7 ), and then click the layout you want to apply 
to the chart.  
 Adding a  Separate Data Series  to a Chart 
 Sometimes you may need to add to a chart a data series that doesn’t appear in the chart’s 
source data; for example, to add projections of future success to your current data. 
 Figure 14-7.   To set the overall layout of chart elements, such as the chart title and legend, open the Quick Layouts 
panel, and then click the layout you want 
 

405
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 To add a data series, work from the Select Data Source dialog box. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Data ➤ Select Data from the Ribbon to 
display the Select Data Source dialog box. You can also Ctrl-click or 
right-click the chart and then click Select Data on the context menu.  
 3. 
 Click the Add button below the Series list box. Excel adds a new 
item to the series box, giving it a default name such as Series3 or 
Series4.  
 4. 
 Click in the Name text box, and then type the name you want to give 
the series. If the name appears in a cell on the worksheet, you can 
click it. When you move the focus out of the Name text box, Excel 
changes the default name to the name you type.  
 5. 
 In the Y values text box, type the values for the series inside the 
braces, putting a comma between the values; for example, 
 {4.5,8.3,6.2,5.1,4.8,10.2} . If the values appear in cells on the 
worksheet, you can enter them by selecting the range.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Select Data Source dialog box.  
 Applying a  Style  to a Chart 
 To control the overall graphical look of a chart, apply one of Excel’s styles to it from the 
Styles box or the Styles panel in the Chart Styles group on the Charts tab of the Ribbon. 
Click the chart to select it, and then click the Chart Design tab of the Ribbon to display its 
controls. Either click a style in the Chart Styles box in the Chart Styles group or hold the 
pointer over the Chart Styles box until the panel button appears, click the panel button to 
display the Chart Styles panel (see Figure  14-8 ), and then click the style.  
 Note  When adding a new data series, you don’t normally need to change the contents of the 
Category (X) axis labels text box. This text box contains the range of cells that provide the labels for 
the horizontal axis. 

406
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Adding a  Title to a Chart 
 To let viewers know what a chart is about, you should add a title to it. To do so, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ 
Chart Title from the Ribbon, and then choose the title type you want:
  None : Choose this item to remove the existing title. You can also 
click the title and press Delete to delete it.  
  Above Chart : Choose this item to place the title above the chart, 
making the chart smaller to provide space for the title. Use this 
placement when you want to keep the title clearly separated from 
the chart; for example, because the chart is busy.  
  Centered Overlay : Choose this item to place the title on the chart, 
centered over the top. Placing the title on the chart lets you keep the 
chart as large as possible. If the title lands on top of data, you can 
click it and drag it to a different position.  
 Figure 14-8.   To give the chart an overall graphical look, apply a style from the Chart Styles box or the Chart Styles 
panel in the Chart Styles group of the Chart Design tab of the Ribbon. You can hold the pointer over a style to display a 
ScreenTip showing the style’s name 
 

407
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
  More Title Options : Choose this item to display the Format Chart 
Title pane. Here, you can click the Title Options tab to work on the 
title area or the Text Options tab to work on the text itself. On the 
Title Options tab, you can use the controls in the Fill & Line pane 
(shown on the left in Figure  14-9 ), the Effects pane (shown in the 
center), or the Size & Properties pane (shown on the right) to apply 
exactly the formatting you want to the title. On the Text Options tab, 
you can use the controls in the Text Fill & Outline pane, the Text 
Effects pane, and the Textbox pane to format the text.  
 Figure 14-9.   You can create a custom chart title by working in the Format Chart Title pane. Click the Title Options tab, 
and then work on the Fill & Line pane (left), the Effects pane (center), and the Size & Properties pane (right), as needed   
 3. 
 Triple-click to select the contents of the Chart Title placeholder that 
Excel adds for you.  
 4. 
 Type the title for the chart over the default text.  
 5. 
 If necessary, drag the chart title placeholder to a different position. 
Move the pointer over a border of the chart title placeholder so that 
the pointer changes to a four-headed arrow, and then click and drag.  
 6. 
 Click elsewhere to deselect the chart title.  
 Tip  You can also display the Format Chart Title pane by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking the chart title 
and then clicking Format Chart Title on the context menu.

CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Adding Axis  Titles to the Chart 
 To make clear what the chart shows, you should add titles to the axes. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ Axis 
Titles to display the Axis Titles panel, and then click to select the 
appropriate axis, such as Primary Horizontal or Primary Vertical. A 
check mark appears next to the axis you clicked, and the 
placeholder appears on the chart.  
 3. 
 Triple-click to select the contents of the placeholder.  
 4. 
 Type the text for the axis title.  
 5. 
 If necessary, drag the placeholder to a different position. Move the 
pointer over a border of the placeholder so that the pointer changes 
to a four-headed arrow, and then click and drag.  
 Changing the Scale or Numbering of an Axis 
 When you insert a chart, Excel automatically numbers the axes to suit the data range the 
chart uses. This automatic numbering works well for many charts, but for other charts, you 
may need to change the scale or numbering of an axis. 
 The options for formatting an axis vary depending on the chart type and the axis type. In this 
section, you’ll explore the formatting options for first the horizontal axis and then the vertical 
axis of a column chart, which are fairly typical and will put you in a good position to format 
other chart types. 
 Changing the Scale or Numbering of a Horizontal Axis 
 If you need to change the scale or numbering of the  horizontal axis  of a chart, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Double-click the horizontal axis, or Ctrl-click or right-click in the horizontal 
axis titles area, and then click Format Axis on the context menu to display 
the Format Axis pane. (You can also choose Chart Design ➤ Chart 
Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ Axis ➤ More Axis Options.) 
 Note  In most chart layouts, Excel uses a vertical placeholder for the vertical axis and a horizontal 
placeholder for the horizontal axis and the depth axis. You can rotate a placeholder as needed by 
Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking it, clicking Format Axis Title, and then using the controls in the Format 
Axis Title pane. These controls work like those in the Format Chart Title pane (shown in Figure  14-9 , 
earlier in this chapter). You can also open the Format Axis Title pane by clicking More Axis Title 
Options on the Axis Titles panel. 

409
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
The Axis Options pane appears at the front. This pane contains four 
sections: the Axis Options section and the Tick Marks section (shown on 
the left in Figure  14-10 ) and the Labels section and the Number section 
(shown on the right in Figure  14-10 ). You can expand or collapse each 
section as needed by clicking its heading.  
 2. 
 In the Axis Type area, select the appropriate option button:
  Automatically select based on data : Select this option button to 
have Excel automatically determine the axis type based on the data 
the chart uses. This setting often works well, but if you need to 
make changes, select one of the other option buttons.  
  Text axis : Select this option button to specify that the axis uses text 
(even if that text looks like dates).  
  Date axis : Select this option button if the axis uses dates.  
 Figure 14-10.   Use the controls in the Format Axis pane to format a horizontal axis to control its axis type, its tick 
marks, its labels, and its number format 
 

410
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 3. 
 In the Vertical Axis Crosses area, select the appropriate option button 
to control where the vertical axis crosses the horizontal axis:
  Automatic : Select this option button to have Excel decide where the 
vertical axis crosses.  
  At category number : To make the vertical axis cross the horizontal 
axis at a particular category number, select this option button and 
type the category number in the text box.  
  At maximum category : Select this option button to make the vertical 
axis cross the horizontal axis at the largest category.  
 4. 
 Also in the Vertical Axis Crosses area, you can select the Categories 
in Reverse Order check box if you want to reverse the category order.  
 5. 
 In the Tick Marks section, choose how to display tick marks on the 
axis:
  Interval between marks : In this box, type the number to determine 
the spacing of tick marks. For example, instead of the default 1 that 
Excel uses for many charts, you can type 5 to use fewer tick marks.  
  Major type : Open this pop-up menu and then click the type of tick 
mark you want for major tick marks. You can select Inside to have 
the major tick marks appear inside the chart, select Outside to have 
them appear outside (on the axis side), or select Cross to have them 
appear on both sides. Alternatively, you can select None if you do 
not want major tick marks.  
  Minor type : Open this pop-up menu and then click the type of tick 
mark you want for minor tick marks. As with major tick marks, your 
choices are Inside, Outside, Cross, or None.  
 6. 
 In the Labels section, set the controls to specify how you want Excel 
to label the axis:
  Automatic : Select this option button to have Excel automatically 
determine the interval between labels.  
  Specify interval unit : To control the interval between labels, select 
this option button and type the value in the text box.  
  Distance from axis. In this text box, type a number between 0 and 
1000 to specify how far the labels should appear from the axis. 
Using 0 puts the labels very close to the axis; using 1000 puts the 
labels a fair distance away.  
  Label position : Open this pop-up menu and then click Next to axis, 
High, Low, or None. Choosing High puts the labels above the chart, 
whereas choosing Low puts the labels below the chart (which may 
have the same effect as choosing Next to axis). Choosing None 
suppresses the labels.  

411
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 7. 
 In the Number section, choose how to format the numbers 
on the axis:
  Category : Open this pop-up menu and choose the number category, 
such as General, Currency, or Date. These are the same formats 
you use for controlling how data appears in cells; depending on the 
format you choose, the Number section may display other options 
you can set for the format. For example, if you choose the Number 
category, you can set the number of decimal places, choose 
whether to use the thousands separator, and specify how to display 
negative numbers.  
  Format code : In this text box, you can specify formatting codes for 
the category. For example, for the Date category, you can specify 
codes such as m/d/yy or mm/dd/yyyy to control how the dates 
appear. Click the Add button to add the formatting code you’ve 
entered.  
  Linked to source : Select this check box if the data is linked to its 
source in the worksheet.  
 8. 
 When you finish choose formatting for the axis, click the Close 
button (the X button in the upper-right corner) to close the Format 
Axis pane.  
 Changing the Scale or Numbering of a Vertical Axis 
 When you need to change the scale or numbering of the  vertical axis  of a chart, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Double-click the vertical axis, or Ctrl-click or right-click in the vertical 
axis titles area, and then click Format Axis on the context menu to 
display the Format Axis pane. The Axis Options pane appears at the 
front. As for a horizontal axis, this pane contains four sections: the 
Axis Options section (shown on the left in Figure  14-11 ) and the Tick 
Marks section, the Labels section, and the Number section (shown 
on the right in Figure  14-11 ). You can expand or collapse each 
section as needed by clicking its heading.  

412
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 2. 
 Use the controls in the Bounds area of the Axis Options section to 
set the minimum and maximum bounds for the axis:
  Minimum : Type the value for the minimum bound over the value that 
Excel has set.  
  Maximum : Type the value for the maximum bound over the value 
that Excel has set.  
 3. 
 Use the controls in the Units area to set the major and minor units:
  Major : Type the value for the major units over the value that Excel 
has set. Depending on how big your chart is, you probably want 
between five and ten major units on the scale you’ve set by 
choosing the Minimum value and Maximum value.  
  Minor : Type the value for the minor units over the value that Excel 
has set. You normally want between four and ten minor units per 
major unit, depending on what the chart shows.  
 Figure 14-11.   Use the controls in the Format Axis pane to format a vertical axis to control its axis type, its tick marks, 
its labels, and its number format. 
 

413
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 4. 
 In the Floor Crosses At area, choose where the horizontal axis should 
cross the vertical axis:
  Automatic : Select this option button to have Excel place the 
crossing point automatically, such as at 0.  
  Axis value : To have the horizontal axis cross at a specific value of 
the vertical axis, select this option button and type the value in the 
text box.  
  Maximum axis value : Select this option button to have Excel place 
the crossing point at the maximum value of the vertical axis.  
 5. 
 If you want to display the units the chart uses, open the Display units 
pop-up menu and click the appropriate item, such as the Hundreds 
item, the Thousands item, or the Millions item. If you choose to 
display units, make sure the Show display units label on chart check 
box is selected, making Excel display a label showing the units. If 
you don’t want to show the units, choose None in the Display units 
pop-up menu.  
 6. 
 If you need the chart to use a logarithmic scale rather than an 
arithmetic scale, select the Logarithmic scale check box, then enter 
the logarithm base in the Base box. For example, enter 10 to have 
the scale use the values 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and so on, at 
regular intervals.  
 7. 
 If you need the chart to show the values in reverse order, select the 
“Values in reverse order” check box. For example, you might need 
a chart to show the lowest value at the top instead of the highest 
values. 
 8. 
 In the Tick Marks section, choose how to display tick marks on the 
axis:
  Major type : Open this pop-up menu and then click the type of tick 
mark you want for major tick marks. You can select Inside to have 
the major tick marks appear inside the chart, select Outside to have 
them appear outside (on the axis side), or select Cross to have them 
appear on both sides. Alternatively, you can select None if you do 
not want major tick marks.  
  Minor type : Open this pop-up menu and then click the type of tick 
mark you want for minor tick marks. As with major tick marks, your 
choices are Inside, Outside, Cross, or None.  
 9. 
 In the Labels section, open the Label position pop-up menu and 
then click Next to axis, High, Low, or None. Choosing High puts the 
labels above the chart, whereas choosing Low puts the labels below 
the chart (which may have the same effect as choosing Next to axis). 
Choosing None suppresses the labels.  

414
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 10. 
 In the Number section, choose how to format the numbers on 
the axis:
  Category : Open this pop-up menu and choose the number category, 
such as General, Currency, or Date. These are the same formats 
you use for controlling how data appears in cells; depending on the 
format you choose, the Number section may display other options 
you can set for the format. For example, if you choose the Number 
category, you can set the number of decimal places, choose 
whether to use the thousands separator, and specify how to display 
negative numbers.  
  Format code : In this text box, you can specify formatting codes for 
the category. For example, for the Date category, you can specify 
codes such as m/d/yy or mm/dd/yyyy to control how the dates 
appear. Click the Add button to add the formatting code you’ve 
entered.  
  Linked to source : Select this check box if the data is linked to its 
source in the worksheet.  
 11. 
 When you’re satisfied with the axis, click the Close button 
(the X button in the upper-right corner) to close the Format 
Axis pane.  
 Adding a Legend to a Chart 
 Many charts benefit from having a legend that summarizes the colors used for different data 
series. You can add a legend by selecting the chart, choosing Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts 
➤ Add Chart Element ➤ Legend, then clicking the placement you want: Right, Top, Left, or 
Bottom. 
 To control whether the  legend  appears outside the chart area (which reduces the 
available chart area) or overlaps the chart area, choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ 
Add Chart Element ➤ Legend ➤ More Legend Options. The Format Legend pane opens, 
showing the Legend Options pane in the Legend Options tab (yes, this gets recursive). 
You can then select or clear the “Show the legend without overlapping the chart” check 
box, as needed. 
 Whichever placement you use for the legend, you can drag it to a better position as needed. 
You can also resize the legend by clicking it and then dragging one of the handles that 
appears around it. 
 If you need to remove a legend from a chart, simply click the legend and then press Delete. 
If you’re feeling more formal, choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ 
Legend ➤ None. 

415
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Adding Axis  Labels  from a Range Separate from the 
Chart Data 
 Depending on how the worksheet containing the source data is laid out, you may need to 
add axis labels that are in separate cells from the chart data. This move is often useful when 
you’re creating a chart that uses only some of the available data. 
 To add axis labels from a separate range, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Data ➤ Select Data from the Ribbon to 
display the Select Data Source dialog box.  
 3. 
 If necessary, click the Collapse Dialog button to the right of 
the Horizontal (Category) axis labels text box to collapse the 
dialog box. If you’ve got plenty of space to work in, just click the 
Horizontal (Category) axis labels box to tell Excel what you want 
to affect.  
 4. 
 Drag through the cells in the work sheet that contain the axis labels. 
Excel enters them in the Horizontal (Category) axis labels text box.  
 5. 
 If you collapsed the Select Data Source dialog box, click the 
Collapse Dialog button again to restore it.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Select Data Source dialog box. 
Excel applies the labels to the axis.  
 Adding Data  Labels  to the Chart 
 If viewers will need to see the precise value of data points rather than just getting a general 
idea of their value, add data labels to the chart. To do so, click the chart, then choose Chart 
Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ Data Labels and then click the placement 
you want on the Data Labels submenu. The Data Labels submenu offers different options, 
depending on the chart type. For example, for a column chart, you choose among Center, 
Inside End, Inside Base, and Outside End. 
 To control the data that appears in the data labels, choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ 
Add Chart Element ➤ Data Labels ➤ More Data Label Options and then make your choices 
in the Format Data Labels pane. Your choices here too vary depending on the chart type. 
The left screen in Figure  14-12 shows the options for a column chart; the right screen in 
Figure  14-12 shows the options for a pie chart.  

416
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 When you add data labels to a chart, Excel displays a data label for each data marker. If you 
want to display only some data labels, delete the ones you don’t need. To delete a data label, 
click it once to select all data labels, then click it again to select just the one label. Then either 
press Delete or Ctrl-click or right-click the selection and click Delete on the context menu. 
 Tip   You can edit the text of data labels if necessary. Click a data label once to select all data 
labels, then click again to select just the data label you want to change. You can then double-click 
the data label to select its contents and type in your text. For example, you might want to add text 
explaining the figure, write the figure in a more accessible format (such as “One MILLION dollars!” 
instead of $1,000,000), or simply falsify the figure. Editing a data label changes only the label 
displayed on the chart—the value in the source data remains the same. 
 Figure 14-12.   The Label Options pane on the Label Options tab of the Format Data Labels pane offers different label 
contents and label position options for different chart types. The left screen shows the options for a column chart. The 
right screen shows the options for a pie chart.  
 Caution   Use data labels sparingly. Only some charts benefit from data labels—other charts may 
become too busy, or the details may distract the audience from the overall thrust of the chart. 
 

417
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Choosing Which Gridlines to Display 
 On many types of charts, you can choose whether to display  horizontal and vertical gridlines  
to help the viewer judge how the data points relate to each other and to the axes. The left 
screen in Figure  14-13 shows a chart with both major and minor gridlines. The right screen in 
Figure  14-13 shows the same chart with just minor gridlines.  
 To control which gridlines appear, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the chart.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Chart Layouts ➤ Add Chart Element ➤ 
Gridlines to display the Gridlines submenu.  
 3. 
 Click the menu item for the type of gridlines you want to display, 
placing a check mark next to it. The menu items available depend 
on the chart type, but these options (for a column chart) are fairly 
typical:
  Primary major horizontal : Click this item to display horizontal 
gridlines at the major divisions in the data series. For example, if 
your data is in the range 0–25, major gridlines normally appear at 5, 
10, 15, 20, and 25.  
  Primary major vertical : Click this item to display vertical gridlines at 
the major divisions.  
  Primary minor horizontal : Click this item to display horizontal 
gridlines at the minor divisions in the data series. For example, if 
your data is in the range 0–25, minor gridlines normally appear at 
each integer—1, 2, 3, and so on up to 25.  
  Primary minor vertical : Click this item to display vertical gridlines at 
the minor divisions.  
 Figure 14-13.   Using both major and minor gridlines (left) usually makes a chart easier to read than using only minor 
gridlines (right)  
 

418
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 4. 
 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each set of gridlines the chart needs. You 
can display multiple sets of gridlines.  
 Formatting a Chart  Wall and  Chart Floor  
 Some charts look fine with a plain background, but for 3-D charts, you may want to decorate 
the chart walls (the areas at the back and the side of the chart) and the chart floor (the area 
at the bottom of the chart). You can add a solid color, a gradient, a picture, or a texture to 
the walls, the floor, or both. Figure  14-14 shows a chart that uses a picture for the walls.  
 Note  To change the values at which the gridlines appear, format the axis, as described in the 
“Changing the Scale or Numbering of an Axis” section earlier in this chapter. 
 Figure 14-14.   You can give a chart a themed look by applying a picture to the chart walls 
 Tip   When the viewer needs to see clearly where each value falls, use either data labels or major and 
minor gridlines. If using minor gridlines (with or without major gridlines) makes the chart look cluttered, 
use only major gridlines. Normally, it’s best not to use both horizontal and vertical minor gridlines because 
they tend to make charts look confusingly busy, but sometimes your charts may need them. 
 

419
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 To format the chart wall or the chart floor, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 2. 
 Choose Format ➤ Current Selection ➤ Chart Elements to open the 
Chart Elements pop-up menu. (The Chart Elements pop-up menu is 
the pop-up menu at the top of the Current Selection group; it shows 
the currently selected element.) Then click the item you want to 
format: back wall, floor, side wall, or walls (to format both the back 
wall and the side wall).  
 3. 
 Still on the Format tab, go to the Format group and click the Format 
Pane button to display the Format pane for the item you selected. 
Figure  14-15 shows the Format Walls pane with the controls for 
inserting a picture fill displayed.  
 Tip  Usually, the chart walls and floors are the elements that look best with a custom fill (such as a 
picture). But you can apply a custom fill to many other chart elements as well. To do so, display the 
Format dialog box for the element, click the Fill category in the left pane, and then make your choices. 
 Figure 14-15.   Use the Format pane to apply a picture fill to objects such as the chart walls or floor

pop-up menu and choose the gradient style you want: linear, 
radial, rectangular, or path. Use the Direction pop-up menu and 
the Angle knob to set the angle and direction of the gradient 
if applicable. Use the Gradient stops bar to adjust the points 
at which the color gradient changes, and then use the Color, 
Position, Transparency, and Brightness controls to tweak the 
gradient as needed.  
  Picture or texture fill : Click the Picture or texture fill option button. 
To use a picture, you can either click the File button, click the 
picture in the Choose a Picture dialog box, and then click the 
Insert button; or simply click the Clipboard button to paste in a 
picture you’ve already copied to the Clipboard. To use a texture, 
choose it from the Texture pop-up palette. Set the degree of 
transparency by dragging the Transparency slider or entering a 
percentage in the text box. Then select the Stretch option button 
if you want to stretch the picture or texture to fill the space, select 
the Stack option button if you want to tile the picture or texture to 
occupy the space without distorting it, or select the “Stack and 
scale with” option button and enter a value in the Units/Picture 
box to tile the picture with the number of units you specify. If you 
need to offset the picture from one of the sides, adjust the value in 
the Offset left box, the Offset right box, the Offset top box, or the 
Offset bottom box.  
  Pattern fill : Click the Pattern option button. In the Pattern area that 
appears, click the pattern you want. Then choose the foreground 
color in the Foreground color pop-up menu and the background 
color in the Background color pop-up menu.  
  Automatic fill : Click the Automatic option button to have Excel apply 
an automatic fill. If you don’t like the fill, you can change it.  
 6. 
 Click the Close button (the X button in the upper-right corner) to 
close the Format pane for the element you chose.  

421
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Formatting Individual Chart  Elements  
 You can format any of the individual elements of a chart—such as the legend, the gridlines, 
or the data labels—by selecting the element and then using its Format pane. This pane 
includes the name of the element it affects: the Format Data Labels pane, the Format Plot 
Area pane, and so on. 
 You can display the Format pane in either of these ways:
  Ctrl-click or right-click the element, and then click the Format item on the 
context menu. This is usually the easiest way of opening the Format pane.  
  Select the element in the Chart Elements pop-up menu, and then click 
the Format Selection button. If it’s hard to Ctrl-click or right-click the 
element on the chart (for example, because the chart is busy), choose 
Format section ➤ Current Selection ➤ Chart Elements from the Ribbon, 
and then click the element you want on the pop-up menu. You can then 
choose Format ➤ Format ➤ Format Pane from the Ribbon to display the 
Format pane for the element.  
 The contents of the Format pane vary depending on the object you’ve selected, but for most 
objects, you’ll find categories such as these:
  Fill. You can fill in a solid shape with a solid color, color gradient, picture, 
or texture. See the “Formatting a Chart Wall and Chart Floor” section 
earlier in this chapter for instructions on creating fills.  
  Line : You can give a shape a color border, gradient border, or no line. 
You can also choose among different border styles, change the border 
width, and pick a suitable line type.  
  Shadow : You can add a shadow to the shape, set its color, and adjust 
its transparency, width, and other properties.  
  Glow and soft edges : You can make an object stand out by giving it a 
glow, choosing a color that contrasts with the object’s surroundings, 
and choosing how wide the glow should be. You can also apply soft 
edges to a shape.  
  3-D format : You can apply a 3-D format to different aspects of a shape; 
for example, setting a different bevel for the top and bottom of the 
shape. 
  3-D rotation : You can apply a 3-D rotation to the object.  
  Font : For objects that use text, you can control how the text looks.  
 Tip  If the chart element contains text, you can also format it by using the controls on the Home 
tab of the Ribbon or keyboard shortcuts. For example, to apply boldface to the data labels, click the 
data labels, and then choose Home ➤ Font ➤ Bold (or press Ctrl+B). This is often easier than using 
the Font controls in the Format pane for the element . 

422
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Copying a Chart’s  Formatting  to Another Chart 
 After you set up a chart with all the formatting you need, you can apply that formatting to 
another chart by using Copy and Paste. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the formatted chart to select its chart area.  
 2. 
 Right-click the border of the chart, and then click Copy on the 
context menu to copy the chart and its formatting to the Clipboard.  
 3. 
 Go to the sheet that contains the chart onto which you want to paste 
the formatting.  
 4. 
 Choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Paste ➤ Paste Special to display the 
Paste Special dialog box shown in Figure  14-16 . 
 5. 
 Select the Formats option button.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Paste Special dialog box. Excel 
applies the formatting to the chart.  
 Reusing Your Own Designs by Creating Custom Chart 
Types 
 If you want to be able to reuse a chart design you’ve created, you can turn it into a  custom 
chart type  . Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the formatted chart either on a chart sheet or on a worksheet.  
 2. 
 Choose Chart Design ➤ Change Chart Type ➤ Save As Template 
from the Ribbon to display the Save as Template dialog box. This is a 
standard Save As dialog box.  
 Figure 14-16.   In the Paste Special dialog box, select the Formats option button to paste just the formatting from one 
chart onto another chart  
 

423
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 3. 
 If you want, change the folder in which to save the chart type. Excel 
suggests using the  ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/
Office/Chart Templates/ folder (where ~ represents your home 
folder). This is a good location for a template that only you will use, 
but if your colleagues will need to use the template too, you may 
need to store it in a shared folder on the network.  
 4. 
 Type a descriptive name for the template in the Save As text box.  
 5. 
 Click the Save button to close the Save Chart Template dialog box. 
Excel saves the template in the folder you chose.  
 To create a chart based on your template, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the source data for the chart.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Charts ➤ Insert Area, Stock, Surface, or Radar 
Chart ➤ Templates to display the Templates pop-up panel.  
 3. 
 Click the template.  
 Adding Sparklines to Your Worksheets 
 Charts are great for illustrating medium to large quantities of information, but sometimes 
you need something smaller, like a chart that fits inside a single cell, giving a quick visual 
indication of a trend. Excel calls such charts  sparklines . 
 Excel provides three kinds of sparklines:
  Sparkline :  A   sparkline is a straightforward line that runs through the 
data points, as in the top part of Figure  14-17 . Excel uses the term 
“sparkline,” but I’ll refer to them as “plain sparklines” to distinguish them 
from column sparklines and win/loss sparklines. A plain sparkline is 
good for showing data that flows from one data point to the next, such 
as temperatures.  
  Column : A  column sparkline shows the data as a series of columns, as 
in a column chart. The middle part of Figure  14-17 shows an example. 
A column sparkline is good for comparing data points that are separate 
from each other, such as sales results by month.  
  Win/Loss : A  win/loss  sparkline shows results as either a win (a positive 
result) or a loss (a negative result). The lower part of Figure  14-17 shows 
an example of win/loss sparklines. A win/loss sparkline is good for when 
you want to take a black-and-white view of results, such as whether your 
investments are up or down in a particular month. In a win/loss sparkline, 
a zero value appears as a blank, as in the second Sacramento result.

CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 Inserting Sparklines 
 To  insert  one or more sparklines in a worksheet, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the range that contains the data you will use for the 
sparklines.  
 2. 
 Click the Insert tab to display its contents, click the Sparklines button 
to display the pop-up panel, and then click Sparklines, Column, or 
Win/Loss, as needed. Whichever button you click, Excel displays the 
Insert Sparklines dialog box (see Figure  14-18 ). 
 3. 
 Make sure the Select a data range for the sparklines text box contains 
the source range for the sparklines. If you chose the range before 
displaying the Insert Sparklines dialog box, it’ll be correct. Otherwise, 
click in this text box, then drag in the worksheet to select the range.  
 Figure 14-17.   Sparklines are  single-cell charts that you can use to indicate trends or results visually 
 Figure 14-18.   In the Insert Sparklines dialog box, choose the data range for the sparklines and the cells in which to 
place them 
 
 

425
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
 4. 
 Click the Select where to place sparklines text box, and then drag 
in the worksheet to select the range. Or, if you prefer, type in 
the range.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Insert Sparklines dialog box. Excel 
inserts the sparklines in the cells.  
 Formatting  Your Sparklines 
 After inserting sparklines, you can format them by using the controls on the Sparkline Design 
tab of the Ribbon. Click a cell in the sparklines to select the group of sparklines and make 
Excel add the Sparklines tab to the Ribbon. If Excel doesn’t display the Sparkline Design tab 
automatically, click the tab to display it (see Figure  14-19 ).  
 These are the main moves for formatting your sparklines:
  Change the source data for a group of sparklines : Click a cell in the 
group of sparklines, and then choose Sparkline Design ➤ Data ➤ Edit 
Data from the Ribbon (clicking the main part of the Edit button). Excel 
displays the Edit Sparklines dialog box, which has the same controls as 
the Insert Sparklines dialog box.  
  Change the source data for a single sparkline : Click the sparkline cell, 
and then choose Sparkline Design ➤ Data ➤ Edit ➤ Edit Selected 
Sparkline. Excel displays the Edit Sparkline dialog box, which works like 
the Insert Sparklines dialog box, but affects only the cell you chose.  
  Change a sparkline to a different type : Click the sparkline cell, and then 
click the Line button, the Column button, or the Win/Loss button in the 
Change Type group on the Sparkline Design tab of the Ribbon.  
  Add markers to the sparklines : In the Markers group on the Sparkline 
Design tab of the Ribbon, select the High Point check box, the Low 
Point check box, the Negative Points check box, the First Point check 
box, or the Last Point check box as needed—or select the All check box 
to select all the others. To change the marker color, choose Sparkline 
Design ➤ Format ➤ Marker Color, and then click the appropriate color 
in the Markers panel (see Figure  14-20 ). 
 Figure 14-19.   Use the controls on the Sparkline Design tab of the Ribbon to format sparklines to look the way you want 
them to  
 

426
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
  Apply a style to the sparklines : In the Format group on the Sparkline 
Design tab of the Ribbon, either click a style in the Styles box or hold 
the pointer over the Styles box to display the panel button; then click the 
panel button to display the Styles panel. Click the style you want.  
  Change the color of the sparklines : Choose Sparkline Design ➤ Style ➤ 
Sparkline Color to display the Sparkline Color panel, and then click the 
color you want.  
  Change the weight of plain sparklines : Choose Sparkline Design ➤ Style 
➤ Sparkline Color ➤ Weight, and then click the line weight. If you need 
a custom weight, click Custom Weight to display the Sparkline Weight 
dialog, enter the weight, and then click the OK button.  
  Change the axes for the sparklines : Choose Sparkline Design ➤ Group 
➤ Axis to display the Axes dialog box (see Figure  14-21 ), and then make 
your choices in it.  
 Figure 14-20.   Use the Markers panel to change the colors of markers and to choose which ones appear on the 
sparklines 
 Tip   For many kinds of data, the High Point marker and the Low Point marker are the most useful. 
Win/loss sparklines use the Negative Points marker by default, while plain sparklines and column 
sparklines don’t use any markers by default. 
 

427
CHAPTER 14: Creating Powerful and Persuasive Charts
  Group sparklines together : If you need to format separate sets of 
sparklines quickly, group them together. Select each set of sparklines, 
and then choose Sparkline Design ➤ Group ➤ Group from the Ribbon 
to group them.  
  Clear sparklines : When you no longer need sparklines, clear them from 
the cells. Select the sparkline cells you want to clear, and then choose 
Sparkline Design ➤ Group ➤ Clear, clicking the main part of the Clear 
button. You can also click a single cell and then choose Sparklines ➤ 
Group ➤ Clear ➤ Clear Selected Sparkline Groups to clear all the cells 
in the group.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to create powerful and persuasive charts from your data. 
You now know what the separate components of charts are called, how to create a chart, 
and how to position it either on a worksheet or on its own chart sheet. You can also make 
Excel show the components you want for a chart and format them as needed. To save time 
and effort, you also learned to reuse your custom chart formatting either by pasting it onto 
an existing chart or by creating a custom chart template from it. 
 You also learned about sparklines and can now use them to illustrate results and trends in 
your worksheets. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you to create custom formulas and harness the power of 
Excel’s functions to perform calculations.

 Chapter 15  
 Crunching Numbers with 
Formulas and Functions 
 To make your worksheets deliver the information you want, you’ll probably need to perform 
calculations with your data. To perform calculations, you enter formulas and functions in 
cells, as you’ll learn to do in this chapter. 
 I’ll start by going over what functions and formulas are so that you’re clear on the difference 
between them. Then I’ll show you how to create your own formulas using Excel’s calculation 
operators. You’ll find it easy to get started because Excel provides plenty of help, but you’ll 
also look at how to troubleshoot common problems that occur with formulas. 
 In the second half of the chapter, you’ll dig into functions: how to insert them in your 
worksheets using the various tools that Excel provides, how to find the ones you want, and 
how to point the functions to the data they need for the calculations. 
 Understanding the Difference Between Formulas 
and Functions 
 In Excel, you can perform calculations in two main ways:
  By using a formula : A   formula is a custom calculation that you create 
when none of Excel’s functions (discussed next) do what you need. 
The word  formula may sound imposing, but a formula can be a simple 
calculation; for example, to subtract 50 from 100, you can type  =100-50 
in a cell (the equal sign tells Excel you’re starting a formula). Formulas 
can also be more complex. For example, say you need to add the 
contents of the cells in the range A1:A6 and then divide them by the 
contents of cell B1. Excel doesn’t have a built-in function for doing this 
because it’s not a standard calculation. So instead, you create a formula 
such as this:  =SUM(A1:A6)/B1 . (In this example, the / is the keyboard 
equivalent of the ÷ symbol.)  

430
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  By using a function : A   function is a preset formula that performs a 
standard calculation. For example, when you need to add several values 
together, you use the  SUM( ) function  , such as  =SUM(1,2,3,4,5,6) , which 
is simpler than  =1+2+3+4+5+6 but has the same effect.  
 In the following sections, I’ll show you how to use each of these methods. But before I do 
that, let’s go over the ways of referring to cells and ranges in formulas and functions.  
 Referring to Cells and Ranges in Formulas 
and Functions 
 To make your formulas and functions work correctly, you need to refer to the cells and 
ranges you want. This section makes sure you know how to refer to cells and ranges, 
both when they’re on the same worksheet as the formula and when they’re on a different 
worksheet. You can even refer to cells and ranges in another workbook—as long as it will 
remain in the same place in your Mac’s file system. 
 Referring to a Cell 
 To refer to a  cell  on the same worksheet, simply use its column lettering and its row number. 
For example, use  =A10 to refer to cell A10. 
 To refer to a cell on a different worksheet, enter the worksheet’s name followed by an 
exclamation point and the cell reference. For example, use  =Supplies!A10 to refer to cell A10 
on the worksheet named Supplies. The easiest way to set up such a reference is like this:
 1. 
 Start creating the formula. For example, type = in the cell.  
 2. 
 Click the worksheet tab for the worksheet that contains the cell you 
want to refer to.  
 3. 
 Click the cell.  
 4. 
 Click the Enter button on the formula bar to enter the reference. 
Excel returns you to the worksheet on which you’re creating the 
formula. You’ll see that the cell displays the result of the formula—
whatever value was in the cell you clicked in step 3—rather than the 
formula itself.  
 Note  Instead of clicking the Enter button on the formula bar in step 4, you can press Return to 
enter the cell reference. When you do this, Excel returns you to the cell below the formula on the 
worksheet on which you’re creating the formula. You then need to press the Up arrow key before 
taking Step 5. 

431
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 5. 
 Press Ctrl+U to resume editing the cell. Alternatively, click in the 
formula bar, and continue editing there. Either way, Excel displays the 
formula, such as  ='Sales Results'!A10 . 
 6. 
 Finish creating the formula as usual.  
 To refer to a cell in a different workbook, put the workbook’s path and file name in brackets, 
then the worksheet’s name, and then the cell reference. For example, the reference 
 =[Shared:Spreads:Results.xlsx]'Area Sales!'AB12 refers to cell AB12 on the worksheet 
named Area Sales in the workbook  Results.xlsx in the  Shared:Spreads folder. 
 Unless you happen to know the path, file name, worksheet name, and cell, it’s usually 
easiest to set up the reference by using the pointing device. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook you want to refer to.  
 2. 
 In the workbook that will contain the reference, start creating the 
formula. For example, type = in the cell.  
 3. 
 Switch to the other workbook. If you can see the other workbook, 
click it. If you can’t see the other workbook, open the Window menu 
on the menu bar, and then click the appropriate window.  
 4. 
 Navigate to the worksheet that contains the cell, and then click the cell.  
 5. 
 Switch back to the workbook in which you’re creating the reference, 
and then complete the formula.  
 Referring to Ranges 
 To refer to a  range that consists of a block of cells, give the cell addresses of the first cell 
and the last cell, separating them with a colon. For example, to refer to the range from cell 
P10 to cell Q12, use  =P10:Q12 . 
 To refer to a range that consists of individual cells, give the address of each cell, separating 
the addresses with commas. For example, to refer to cell J14, cell K18, and cell Z20, use 
 =J14,K18,Z20 . 
 To refer to a range on a different worksheet or in a different workbook, use the techniques 
explained in the previous section. For example, if you need to refer to the range P10 to Q12 
on the worksheet named Stock Listing, use  ='Stock Listing'!P10:Q12 . 
 Note  If the worksheet’s name contains any spaces, you must put the name inside single quotes; for 
example,  ='Sales Results'!A10 rather than  =Sales Results!A10 . You can also use the single quotes 
on worksheet names that don’t have spaces if you find it easier to be consistent. If you omit the single 
quotes when they’re needed, Excel either displays the Open dialog, with a message such as “Cannot 
find 'Results'. Copy from:”, inviting you to find the right workbook, or displays an error message. 

432
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 
UNDERSTANDING ABSOLUTE REFERENCES, RELATIVE REFERENCES, AND MIXED REFERENCES
 Using cell addresses or range addresses is straightforward enough, but when you start using formulas, there’s a 
complication: if you copy a formula and paste it, you need to tell Excel whether the pasted formula should refer 
to the cells it originally referred to, or the cells in the same relative positions to the cell where the formula now 
is, or a mixture of the two. (If you move a formula rather than copy it, Excel keeps the formula as it is.) 
 To make references clear, Excel uses three types of references:
  Absolute reference : A reference that always refers to the same cell, no matter where you 
copy it. Excel uses a dollar sign ($) to indicate that each part of the reference is absolute. 
For example, $B$3 is an absolute reference to cell B3. 
  Relative reference : A reference that refers to the cell by its position relative to the cell that 
holds the reference. For example, if you select cell A3 and enter  =B5 in it, the reference 
means “the cell one column to the right and two rows down.” So if you copy the formula 
to cell C4, Excel changes the cell reference to cell D6, which is one column to the right 
and two rows down from cell C4. To indicate a relative reference, Excel uses a plain 
reference without any dollar signs; for example, B4. 
  Mixed reference : A reference that is absolute for either the column or the row and relative 
for the other. For example, $B4 is absolute for the column (B) and relative for the row (4), 
while B$4 is relative for the column and absolute for the row. When you copy and paste a 
mixed reference, the absolute part stays the same, but the relative part changes to reflect 
the new location. 
 If you’re typing a reference, you can type the $ signs into the reference to make it absolute or mixed. If you’re 
entering references by selecting cells, click in the reference in the cell you’re editing or in the Formula bar, and 
then press F4 one or more times to cycle a reference through its absolute, relative, column-absolute, and row-
absolute versions. 
 Tip   Sometimes you may need to make the contents of one row or column refer to another row 
or column. For example, say you need to make each cell in row 25 refer to the corresponding cell 
in row 4, so that cell A25 refers to cell A4, cell B25 to cell B4, and so on. To do this, click the row 
heading for row 25, selecting the row. Then type  =4:4 to create the reference to row 4, and press 
Cmd+Return to enter it in all the cells of the selection. Similarly, you can refer to a whole column by 
entering its letter designation, a colon, and the letter designation again; for example,  E:E . 

433
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Referring to  Named Cells and Ranges  
 To make your references easier to enter and recognize, you can give a name to any cell or 
range. You can then refer to the cell or range by the name. 
 To create a named range, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the cell or range you want to name.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Name ➤ Define from the menu bar to display the 
Define Name dialog box (shown in Figure  15-1 with settings chosen).  
 Figure 15-1.   Use the Define Name dialog box to give a cell or range a name by which you can easily refer to it 
 3. 
 In the Enter a name for the data range text box, type the name for 
the range. Follow these rules:
  The name must start with a letter or an underscore.  
  The name can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. It 
can’t contain spaces or symbols.  
  The name must be unique in the workbook.  
 4. 
 Make sure that the “Select the range of cells” box shows the right 
cell or range. If not, select the cell or range you want. If you need 
to get the Define Name dialog box out of the way, you can click the 
Collapse Dialog button, but most likely you won’t need to.  
 5. 
 If you want to create only this one name, click the OK button to apply 
the name to the range and close the Define Name dialog box. If you 
want to create more names before you close the Define Name dialog 
box, click the Add button (the + button).  
 

434
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 After you’ve named a range, you can use the name in your formulas instead of the cell 
reference or range reference. Named ranges can be a great time-saver because the names 
are much easier to remember and to type than the cell references or range references. 
 Performing Custom Calculations by Creating Formulas 
 When you need to perform a custom calculation in a cell, use a formula rather than a 
function. All you need to do is type in a simple formula using the appropriate calculation 
operators, such as + signs for addition and – signs for subtraction. In this section, you’ll 
meet the calculation operators, try using them in a worksheet, and learn the order in which 
Excel applies them—and how to change that order when you need to. 
 Meeting Excel’s  Calculation Operators  
 To perform calculations in Excel, you need to know the operators for the different operations: 
addition, division, comparison, and so on. Table  15-1 explains the full set of calculation 
operators you can use in your formulas in Excel.  
 Note   To delete a name from a range, choose Insert ➤ Name ➤ Define from the menu bar to 
display the Define Name dialog box. In the Names in workbook list, click the name. Click the Delete 
button (the – button) to delete the name. Click the Close button to close the Define Name dialog 
box. If you find you’ve deleted the wrong name, use Undo to restore it. 
 Note   You can also name the selected cell or range by clicking in the Reference area (to the left 
of the Formula bar), typing the name you want to assign, and then pressing Return. This method 
can be handy, but there’s one complication you need to watch out for: if you type an existing name 
(instead of a new name) into the Reference area and press Return, Excel selects the cell or range 
to which the name refers. If you’re working fast, this can be confusing because you may not spot 
that you have moved the active cell to an existing named cell or range rather than defining a new 
named cell or range. 

435
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Table 15-1.  Calculation Operators You Can Use in Excel 
 Calculation Operator 
 Operation 
 Explanation or Example 
 Arithmetic Operators 
 + 
 Addition 
 =1+2 adds 2 to 1. 
 – 
 Subtraction 
 =1–2 subtracts 2 from 1. 
 * 
 Multiplication 
 =2*2 multiplies 2 by 2. 
 / 
 Division 
 =A1/4 divides the value in cell A1 by 4. 
 % 
 Percentage 
 =B1% returns the value in cell B1 expressed as a 
percentage. Excel displays the value as a decimal unless 
you format the cell with the Percentage style. 
 ^ 
 Exponentiation 
 =B1^2 raises the value in cell B1 to the power 2. 
 Comparison Operators 
 = 
 Equal to 
 =B2=15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 contains the value 
15000. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
 <> 
 Not equal to 
 =B2<>15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 does not contain the 
value 15000. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
 > 
 Greater than 
 =B2>15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 contains a value 
greater than 15000. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
 >= 
 Greater than or 
equal to 
 =B2>=15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 contains a value 
greater than or equal to 15000. Otherwise, it returns 
FALSE. 
 < 
 Less than 
 =B2<15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 contains a value less 
than 15000. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
 <= 
 Less than or equal 
to 
 =B2<=15000 returns TRUE if cell B2 contains a value less 
than or equal to 15000. Otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
 Reference Operators 
 [ cell reference ]:[ cell 
reference ] 
 The range of cells 
between the two 
cell references 
 A1:G5 returns the range of cells whose upper-left cell is 
cell A1 and whose lower-right cell is cell G5. 
 [ cell reference ],[ cell 
reference ] 
 The range of cells 
listed 
 A1,C3,E5 returns three cells: A1, C3, and E5. 
 [ cell or range 
reference ] [ space ][ cell 
or range reference ] 
 The range (or 
cell) that appears 
in both cells or 
ranges given 
 =A7:G10 B10:B12 returns the cell B10 because this is the 
only cell that appears in both the ranges given. If more 
than one cell appears in the range, this returns a #VALUE! 
error. 
 Text Operator 
 & 
 Concatenation 
(joining values as 
text) 
 =A1&B1 returns the values from cells A1 and B1 joined 
together as a text string. For example, if A1 contains “New 
York ” (including a trailing space) and B1 contains “Sales”, 
this formula returns “New York Sales.” If A1 contains 100 
and B1 contains 50, this formula returns 10050. 

436
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Using the Calculation Operators 
 Now that you know what the  calculation operators   a re, try the following example of creating 
a simple worksheet (see Figure  15-2 ) that uses the four most straightforward operators: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
 Figure 15-2.   Create this simple worksheet to try using Excel’s addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
operators 
 To create the worksheet, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a new workbook. The quickest way to do this is to press 
Cmd+N.  
 2. 
 Type the following text in cells A1 through A7:
  A1 . Gross 
  A2. Expenses  
  A3. Tax Rate  
  A4. Tax Amount  
  A5. Net  
  A6. Months  
  A7. Monthly Net  
 3. 
 Apply boldface to column A by clicking the column heading and then 
choosing Home ➤ Font ➤ Bold. 
 4. 
 Apply Currency format to column B by clicking the column heading 
and then choosing Home ➤ Number ➤ Number Format ➤ Currency.  
 

437
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 5. 
 Type the following text in cells B1 through B3:
  B1. 84000  
  B2. 30000  
  B3. 0.18 
 6. 
 Apply Percent style to cell B3 by clicking the cell and then choosing 
Home ➤ Number ➤ Percent Style.  
 7. 
 Now enter the formula  =B1*B3 in cell B4, like this:
  Click cell B4 to select it.  
  Type  = to start creating a formula in the cell.  
  Click cell B1 to enter it in the formula. Excel displays a shimmering 
dotted blue outline around the cell and adds it to the formula in the 
cell and to the Formula bar (see Figure  15-3 ). 
 Note  You can also enter the percentage in Step 6 by typing  18% and pressing Return. Excel 
automatically changes the number format to Percentage. 
 Figure 15-3.   When you click cell B1, Excel adds it to the formula in both the cell and the Formula bar and displays a 
dotted blue outline around it 
  Type  * to tell Excel you want to multiply the value in cell B1. Excel 
enters the asterisk in the formula and changes the outline around 
cell B1 to solid blue.  
  Click cell B3 to enter it in the formula. Excel displays a shimmering 
dotted outline (green this time) around the cell and adds it to the 
formula in the cell and in the formula bar (see Figure  15-4 ). 
 

438
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  Press Return or click the Enter button (the check-mark button in the 
Formula bar) to finish entering the formula in cell B4.  
 8. 
 Enter the formula  =B1-(B2+B4) in cell B5. Follow these steps:
  Click cell B5 to select it. If you pressed Return to enter the previous 
formula, Excel may have selected this cell already.  
  Type  = to start creating a formula in the cell.  
  Click cell B1 to add it to the formula.  
  Type  – to enter the subtraction operator.  
  Type  ( to start a nested expression. (More on this shortly.)  
  Click cell B2 to add it to the formula.  
  Type  + to enter the addition operator.  
  Click cell B4 to add it to the formula.  
  Type  ) to end the nested expression.  
  Click the Enter button to finish entering the formula.  
 9. 
 Enter  12 in cell B6 and apply General formatting to it. Follow these 
steps:
  Click cell B6.  
  Choose Home ➤ Number ➤ Number Format ➤ General.  
  Type  12 . 
  Press the down arrow to enter the value and move the active cell to 
cell B7.  
 10.  Enter the formula  =B5/B6 in cell B7. This time, simply type the 
formula in—lowercase is fine—and then press Return. You’ll notice 
that when you type  b5 , Excel selects cell B5 to let you check visually 
that you have the right cell.  
 Figure 15-4.   Click cell B3 to add it to the formula 
 

439
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Now that you’ve created the worksheet, try changing the figures in cells B1, B2, and B3. 
You’ll see the results of the formulas in cells B4, B5, and B7 change accordingly. Excel 
recalculates the formulas each time you change a value in a cell, so the formula results

 If you create a workbook with huge amounts of data, automatic recalculation may make Excel run slowly, 
especially when one recalculated value causes many other values to need recalculation. 
 If you find Excel struggling to recalculate a workbook, turn off automatic calculation by choosing Formulas ➤ 
Calculation ➤ Calculation Options ➤ Manual from the Ribbon. If recalculation was the problem, you’ll notice 
the difference immediately. 
 You can recalculate manually when necessary by choosing Formulas ➤ Calculation ➤ Calculate Sheet from the 
Ribbon (to recalculate just the active worksheet) or choosing Formulas ➤ Calculation ➤ Calculate Now from 
the Ribbon to recalculate the whole workbook  . 
 Understanding the  Order in Which Excel Evaluates Operators 
 In the previous example, you entered the formula  =B1-(B2+B4) in cell B5. The parentheses 
are necessary because the calculation has two separate stages—one stage of subtraction 
and one stage of addition—and you need to control the order in which they occur. 
 Try changing the formula in cell B5 to  =B1-B2+B4 and see what happens. Follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Click cell B5.  
 2. 
 Click in the Formula bar to start editing the formula there. (You can 
also edit in the cell by double-clicking the cell or pressing Ctrl+U, but 
editing in the Formula bar gives you more space, so it’s often easier.)  
 3. 
 Delete the opening and closing parentheses.  
 4. 
 Click the Enter button on the Formula bar.  
 You’ll notice that the Net amount (cell B5) jumps substantially. This is because you’ve 
changed the meaning of the formula:
  =B1-(B2+B4). This formula means “add the value in cell B2 to the value 
in cell B4, and then subtract the result from the value in cell B1.”  
  =B1-B2+B4. This formula means “subtract the value in cell B2 from the 
value in cell B1, and then add the value in cell B4 to the result.”  

440
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 To restore the formula, click cell B5 and press Ctrl+U to open the cell for editing. Position the 
insertion point before  B2 and type  ( and then position the insertion point after  B4 and type  ) . 
Then press Return to enter the formula in the cell. 
 The order in which Excel evaluates the operators is called  operator precedence , and it can 
make a huge difference in your formulas—so it’s vital to know both how it works and how to 
override it. Table  15-2 shows you the order in which Excel evaluates the operators in formulas.  
 Note   When you use nested parentheses in a formula, Excel uses a different color for each pair of 
parentheses to help you see which closing parenthesis and opening parenthesis go together.

 Comparison operators 
 When two operators are at the same level, Excel performs the operator that appears earlier 
in the formula first.  
 Nesting Parts of Formulas to  Control Operator Precedence  
 You can control operator precedence in any formula by nesting one or more parts of the 
formula in parentheses. For example, as you just saw, using  =B1-(B2+B4) makes Excel 
evaluate  B2+B4 before the subtraction. 
 You can nest parts of the formula several levels deep if necessary. For example, the 
following formula uses three levels of nesting and returns 180: 
 =10*(5*(4/(1+1))+8) 
 Breaking Up a Complex Formula into Separate Steps 
 A cell can accept more or less as complex a  formula  as you care to create—and some 
people enjoy creating formulas that are so complex that it takes an expert to figure them out. 

441
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Unless you like to work this way, when you have to create a complex formula, consider 
breaking it up into separate steps, putting each step in its own cell or row. For example, you 
could break up that =10*(5*(4/(1+1))+8) formula like this:
  Cell B1. =1+1 
  Cell B2. =4/B1 
  Cell B3. =5*B2 
  Cell B4. =B3+8 
  Cell B5. =10*B4 
 Broken up like this, each formula is easy to read, and you can easily see if any of the steps 
gives the wrong result. You can type a text description of each step in the next cell for 
reference, or (more discreetly) insert a comment describing the step. 
 When you’ve checked that the formula works, you have the option of creating a new version 
of the formula that goes into a single cell. But if you want to keep the worksheet easy to read 
and easy to audit, leave the formula in its step-by-step form.  
 Entering Formulas Quickly by Copying and Using  AutoFill  
 In many worksheets, you may need to enter related formulas in several or many cells. For 
example, say you have the worksheet shown in Figure  15-5 , which lists a range of products 
with their prices and sales. Column D needs to show the total revenue derived by multiplying 
the Units figure by the Price value.  
 Figure 15-5.   When a worksheet needs similar formulas in a column or row, you can enter one formula manually and 
then use AutoFill or Copy and Paste to enter it quickly in the other cells  
 Each cell in column D needs a different formula: Cell D2 needs =B2*C2, Cell D3 needs 
=B3*C3, and so on. Because the formula is the same except for the row number, you can use 
either AutoFill or Copy and Paste to enter the formula from cell D2 into the other cells as well. 
 To enter the formula using AutoFill, click the cell that contains the formula (here, cell D2), and 
then drag the AutoFill handle (the green square at the lower-right corner of the active cell) down 
through cell D5. Excel automatically fills in the formulas, adjusting each for the change in row. 
 

442
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 To enter the formula using Copy and Paste, click the cell that contains the formula, and then 
give the Copy command (Cmd+C.). Select the destination cells, and then give the Paste 
command (Cmd+V). 
 Choosing Preferences for Error Checking 
 Excel can automatically identify various errors in your formulas. To choose which errors 
Excel marks, you set the error-checking preferences. Choose Excel ➤ Preferences or 
press Cmd+, (Cmd and the comma key) to display the Excel Preferences window, and then 
click the Error Checking icon in the Formulas and Lists area to display the Error Checking 
preferences pane (see Figure  15-6 ). 
 Note  If you need to copy a formula to a different row or column but have it refer to the original 
location, create the formula using mixed references. If you need to keep the column the same, 
make the column absolute (for example,  =$B2 ); if you need to keep the row the same, make the 
row absolute (for example,  =B$2 ). If you need the formula to refer to the same cell or range always, 
create it as an absolute reference . 
 Figure 15-6.   In the Error Checking preferences pane of the Excel Preferences  window , choose whether to use 
background error checking and decide which errors to show 
 

443
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 You can then choose the following settings in the upper box:
  Turn on  background  error checking : Select this check box to turn on 
error checking in the background. Background error checking is a good 
idea for small and medium-size workbooks, but you may want to turn 
it off for larger workbooks because it can slow Excel down. If you do 
turn off background error checking, be sure to check for errors manually 
(choose Formulas ➤ Formula Auditing ➤ Error Checking from the 
Ribbon, clicking the main part of the Error Checking button).  
  Indicate errors using this  color : In this pop-up menu, choose the color 
to use for indicating errors. The default setting is Automatic, which lets 
Excel choose the color. You might prefer to choose a garish color to 
make errors stand out.  
  Reset ignored errors : Click this button to reset all the errors in the active 
workbook that you’ve told Excel to ignore. You may find it helpful to 
ignore errors when you’re building a worksheet and the errors occur 
because the data isn’t in place. When the worksheet is finished, you can 
click the Reset Ignored Errors button to see any remaining errors.  
 In the  Show Errors For box  , you can select or clear the following check boxes to control 
which errors (or apparent errors) Excel indicates by putting a green triangle at the upper-left 
corner of the cell:
  Formulas that result in an error : Select this check box to make Excel 
mark cells whose formulas produce errors. This is normally helpful.  
  Years in 2 digits : Select this check box to make Excel mark cells 
that contain years represented by two digits rather than four digits 
(for example, 16 instead of 2016). Using four-digit years helps avoid 
confusion in your spreadsheets.  
  Numbers formatted as text : Select this check box to make Excel mark 
numbers that have text formatting rather than number formatting or that 
you’ve preceded with an apostrophe to force Excel to treat them as text. 
This option can be helpful, but it’s likely to mark cells you’ve deliberately 
formatted as text.  
  Formulas that don’t match nearby formulas : Select this check box to 
make Excel mark formulas that appear wrong because they’re different 
from formulas in adjoining cells. For example, if you have a row of eight 
cells, and six contain SUM( ) formulas adding the cells above them 
but two contain SUM( ) formulas adding the three cells to their left, 
this setting makes Excel mark those two cells because they contain 
formulas different from their neighbors. This can be helpful, but if the 
two oddball cells are summarizing the fiscal year quarters, you may 
want the formulas to be different.  

444
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  Formulas omitting cells in a region : Select this check box to make Excel 
mark formulas that are apparently intended to cover a whole region 
of a worksheet but omit particular cells in it. If these omissions are 
intentional, you can suppress the warnings.  
  Unlocked cells containing formulas : Select this check box to make Excel 
mark unlocked cells that contain formulas. This setting can help you 
track down cells you need to lock to prevent your colleagues taking 
liberties with your calculations.  
  Formulas referring to empty cells : Select this check box to make Excel 
mark formulas that try to use empty cells. Empty cells can cause plenty 
of problems in your formulas, including division-by-zero errors, so having 
Excel identify formulas that use empty cells is usually a good idea.  
  Inconsistent calculated column formula in tables : Select this check box 
to make Excel mark formulas in tables that differ from the other formulas 
in their columns. (Chapter   16  shows you how to create tables.)  
 When you’ve finished choosing error-checking preferences, click the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) to close the Preferences window. 
 Troubleshooting Common Problems with Formulas 
 Formulas are great when they work, but a single-letter typo or a wrong reference can prevent 
a formula from working correctly. This section shows you how to deal with common problems 
with formulas, starting with solutions to the error messages you’re most likely to produce. 
 Understanding  Common Errors  —and Resolving Them 
 Excel includes an impressive arsenal of error messages, but some of them appear far more 
frequently than others. Table  15-3 shows you eight errors you’re likely to encounter, explains 
what they mean, and tells you how to solve them.  

445
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Table 15-3.  How to Solve Excel’s Eight Most Common Errors 
 Error 
 What the Problem Is 
 How to Solve It 
 ##### 
 The formula result is too wide to fit in 
the cell. 
 Make the column wider by double-clicking 
the column head’s right border to AutoFit the 
column width. 
 #NAME? 
 A function name is misspelled, or the 
formula refers to a range that doesn’t 
exist. 
 Check the spelling of all functions; correct any 
mistakes. If the formula uses a named range, 
check that the name is right and that you 
haven’t deleted the range. 
 #NUM! 
 The formula tries to use a value that is 
not valid for it; for example, returning 
the square root of a negative number. 
 Give the function a suitable value. 
 #VALUE! 
 The function uses an invalid argument; 
for example, using =FACT( ) to return the 
factorial of text rather than a number. 
 Give the function the right type of data. 
 #N/A 
 The function does not have a valid value 
available. 
 Make sure the function’s arguments provide 
values of the right type. 
 #DIV/0 
 The function is trying to divide by zero 
(which is mathematically impossible). 
 Change the divisor value from zero. Often, 
you’ll find that the function is using a blank cell 
(which has a zero value) as the argument for the 
divisor; in this case, enter a value in the cell. 
 #REF! 
 The formula uses a cell reference 
or a range reference that’s not valid 
because, for example, you’ve deleted a 
worksheet. 
 Edit the formula and provide a valid reference. 
 #NULL! 
 There is no intersection between the 
two ranges specified. 
 Change the ranges to produce an intersection. 

446
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Seeing the Details of an Error in a Formula 
 When Excel identifies an error in a formula, it displays a green triangle at the upper-left 
corner of the cell that contains the formula. Click the cell to display an action button that you 
can hold the pointer over to display a  ScreenTip  explaining the problem (as shown on the left 
in Figure  15-7 ) or click to display a menu of actions you can take to resolve the problem 
(as shown on the right in Figure  15-7 ). 
 Figure 15-7.   Hold the pointer over the action button for an error cell to display a ScreenTip explaining what’s wrong 
(left). Click the button to display details of the error (right)  
 Tracing an Error Back to Its Source 
 To see which cell is causing an error, click the error cell, then choose Formulas ➤ Formula 
Auditing ➤ Error Checking ➤  Trace Error  from the Ribbon. Excel displays an arrow from the 
guilty cell or cells to the error cell. The left screen in Figure  15-8 shows a simple example 
of tracing an error; the more complex the worksheet, the more helpful this feature is. Excel 
displays a worksheet symbol (see the right screen in Figure  15-8 ) if the cell reference is on 
another worksheet or in another workbook.  
 Caution   The =SUM( ) function is smart enough to ignore text values that you feed it. For example, 
if cell A1 contains the value 1 and cell A2 contains the text Dog, the function =SUM(A1:A2) returns 
1 even though the formula =A1+A2 returns a #VALUE! error. The  =SUM( ) function’s smartness here 
is a mixed blessing: you get a usable result, which is presumably what you want—but this hides 
the mistake you’ve made in trying to add text instead of a numerical value. 
 

447
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Figure 15-8.   Choose Formulas  ➤ Formula Auditing  ➤ Error Checking  ➤ Trace Error from the Ribbon to identify the 
cell or cells causing an error. If the cell reference is on another worksheet or in another workbook, Excel displays a 
worksheet symbol, as shown on the right 
 Note   If you’ve turned off background error checking in the Error Checking preferences pane, 
choose Formulas ➤ Formula Auditing ➤ Error Checking (clicking the main part of the Error 
Checking button) from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Error Checking from the menu bar to check for errors. 
 Displaying All the Formulas in a  Worksheet 
 When you need to review or check all the formulas in a worksheet, choose Formulas ➤ 
 Auditing ➤ Show Formulas from the Ribbon. Excel displays the formulas and automatically 
widens the worksheet columns to give you more space (see Figure  15-9 ). 
 Figure 15-9.   Choose Formulas  ➤ Formula Auditing  ➤ Show Formulas from the Ribbon when you need to see all the 
formulas in a worksheet 
 
 

448
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 When you’ve finished viewing the formulas, choose Formulas ➤ Formula Auditing ➤ Show 
Formulas from the Ribbon again. Excel automatically restores the columns to their former 
widths. 
 Seeing Which Cells a Formula Uses 
 To see which cells a formula uses, click the cell that contains the formula, and then choose 
Formulas ➤ Formula Auditing ➤ Trace Precedents from the Ribbon. Excel displays an arrow 
showing the formula back to its roots. If one of the cells the formula uses contains a formula 
itself, you can click that cell and click the Trace Precedents button again to display its 
precedents in turn. Figure  15-10 shows the precedents of cell D6 and one of the cells that it 
uses, cell D2.  
 Figure 15-10.   Use the  Trace Precedents command to see which cells you’re using to produce a formula result. In this 
example, cells B2 and C2 go to make up the formula in cell D2, which in turn appears in the =SUM(D2:D5) formula in 
cell D6. 
 Figure 15-11.   Use the Trace Dependents command to see which formulas use a particular cell’s value to produce their 
results 
 When you need to look at the problem the other way and see which formulas use a 
particular cell, click the cell, and then choose Formulas ➤ Formula Auditing ➤ Trace 
Dependents from the Ribbon. Again, Excel displays arrows, this time from the cell going to 
each of the formulas that use it. Figure  15-11 shows an example of tracing dependent cells.  
 
 

449
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 When you’ve finished tracing precedents and dependents, choose Formulas ➤ Formula 
Auditing ➤ Remove Arrows from the Ribbon (clicking the main part of the Remove Arrows 
button) to remove the arrows from the screen. If you want to remove just precedent arrows 
or dependent arrows, click the Remove Arrows pop-up button, and then click the Remove 
Precedent Arrows item or the Remove Dependent Arrows item on the pop-up menu.  
 Removing Circular References 
 Even if you’re careful, it’s easy enough to create a  circular  reference , one that refers to itself. 
 Circular references most often occur when you enter a formula that refers to a cell that itself 
refers to the cell in which you’re entering the formula. For example, say cell A1 contains the 
formula  =B1 . If you enter the formula  =A1 in cell B1, you’ve created a circular reference: cell 
B1 gets its value from cell A1, which gets its value from cell B1, and so on. 
 You can also enter a circular reference by making a cell refer to itself. For example, if you 
enter  =A1/B1 in cell A1, you’ve created a circular reference in that cell because cell A1 refers 
to itself. This type of circular reference is usually easier to avoid than the previous type. 
 Circular references can be useful in some specialized circumstances, such as when you 
need to perform iterations of a calculation, but normally you don’t want them in your 
worksheets, so Excel helps you to get rid of them. 
 When you create a circular reference that Excel cannot calculate, Excel displays the Excel 
Cannot Calculate a Formula dialog box shown in Figure  15-12 . Click the OK button if you 
want to open a Help window showing information on how to deal with circular references, 
or click the Cancel button if you want to go ahead and enter the circular reference in the cell 
(for example, because you can tell what the problem is and will be able to fix it easily).  
 Note   You can use the Trace Precedents command and the Trace Dependents command either 
with formulas displayed or with formula results displayed, whichever you find most useful. 
 Figure 15-12.   Circular references can cause problems in worksheets so Excel warns you when you enter one. You can 
click the Cancel button if you’re sure you want to create the circular reference 
 

450
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Performing Standard Calculations by Inserting 
Functions 
 When you need to perform standard calculations in your worksheets, use Excel’s built-in 
functions, which are predefined formulas that you simply insert in a cell and provide with the 
data they need. 
 You can enter functions in three ways:
  Use the AutoSum button or AutoSum pop-up  menu : The AutoSum 
button and pop-up menu appear in the Function Library group on the 
Formulas tab of the Ribbon and in the Editing group on the Home 
tab of the Ribbon and give quick access to five widely used 
functions.  
  Use the  Formula Builder : The Formula Builder is a pane that walks 
you through putting together the formula you need. You can open the 
Formula Builder in various ways, such as by clicking the fx button on the 
formula bar, clicking the Insert Function button in the Function Library 
group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon, or choosing Insert ➤ Function 
from the menu bar.  
  Type  the function in manually : When you know which function you want, 
you can type it straight into a cell.  
 Understanding Function  Names and Arguments  
 In Excel, a function has a name written in capitals followed by a pair of parentheses. Here 
are three examples:
  SUM( ) : This widely used function adds together two or more values that 
you specify.  
  COUNT( ) : This function counts the number of cells that contain 
numbers (as opposed to text, blanks, or other data types) in the range 
you specify.  
  TODAY( ) : This function enters the current date in the cell.  
 Note   If you leave circular references in a worksheet, use the Circular References readout 
toward the left end of the status bar to identify them. This readout shows the location of the 
most recent circular reference that Excel has identified. When you’ve dealt with that circular 
reference, the Circular References readout shows the next one, and so on, until there are 
none left.  

451
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Most functions take  arguments , which are pieces of information that tell the function what 
you want it to work on. Excel prompts you to provide the arguments each function needs. 
For example, when you enter the function in a cell, Excel displays a ScreenTip showing the 
arguments needed. Figure  15-13 shows an example using the SUM( ) function.  
 Figure 15-13.   When you enter a function in a cell, Excel prompts you to supply the arguments it needs. The current 
argument appears in bold, such as the number1 argument here. An argument that appears in brackets is optional 
 The ScreenTip shows that the SUM( ) function has one required argument and one optional 
argument, and you can add further arguments as needed:
  Required argument : Each required argument appears without 
brackets, like the argument  number1 in the ScreenTip. You separate 
the arguments with commas. For example, you can use SUM( ) to add 
the values of cells in a range: SUM(C1:C10). Here, C1:C10 is a single 
argument, the required argument.  
  Optional argument : Each optional argument appears in brackets, like the 
argument  [number2] in the ScreenTip. For example, you can use SUM( ) 
to add the values of two cells: SUM(C1,C3). Here, C1 is the required 
argument, and C3 is the first optional argument.  
  Extra arguments : The ellipsis (…) shows that you can enter extra 
arguments of the same type. For example, you can use SUM( ) to add 
the values of many cells: SUM(C1,C3,D4,D8,E1,XF202). Here, C1 is 
the required argument, and all the other cell references are optional 
arguments.  
 Note   A few functions take no arguments. For example, you don’t need to tell the TODAY( ) function 
which day you’re talking about. Similarly, the NOW( ) function needs no arguments to return the 
current date and time, and the NA( ) function simply enters #(N/A) in a cell to indicate that the 
information is not available. 
 

452
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Inserting Functions with the  AutoSum Pop-up Menu  
 The quickest and easiest way to enter any of five widely used functions—SUM( ), 
AVERAGE( ), COUNT( ), MAX( ), or MIN( )—in your worksheets is to use the AutoSum 
pop-up menu in the Function Library group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. Follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Click the cell you want to enter the function in.  
 2. 
 If you want to create a  SUM( ) function  for the cells immediately 
above or to the left of the selected cell, click the AutoSum button 
itself, either in the Function Library group on the Formulas tab of 
the Ribbon or in the Editing group on the Home tab of the Ribbon. 
Otherwise, click the AutoSum pop-up button, and then click the 
function (see Figure  15-14 ). 
 3. 
 Excel inserts the function in the cell you chose and selects the range 
it thinks you may want to use as the argument. Figure  15-15 shows 
an example with the  AVERAGE( ) function  . 
 Figure 15-14.   Use the AutoSum pop-up menu on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon when you need to insert the SUM( ), 
AVERAGE( ), COUNT( ), MAX( ), or MIN( ) function quickly 
 

453
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Figure 15-15.   When you insert a function from the AutoSum pop-up menu, Excel selects a range of data it thinks may 
be suitable 
 4. 
 If you need to change the range, do so in one of these ways:
  Click and drag to select the right range.  
  Type the range over the range selected within the parentheses.  
 5. 
 Add another argument to the formula if needed. For example, type a 
comma, and then click and drag to select another range.  
 6. 
 When the formula is as you want it, press Return to enter it in the 
cell. Excel displays the result of the formula.  
 Inserting Functions with the Formula Builder 
 When you need to find the right function to insert or when you need to learn about the 
arguments for a function, use the  Formula Builder  to insert the function. The Formula 
Builder is a pane that gives you access to a complete list of Excel’s functions, together with 
descriptions and details of the arguments they use. 
 To insert a function with the Formula Builder, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the cell in which you want to enter the function.  
 2. 
 Open the Formula Builder in one of these ways:
  Formula bar : Click the fx button.  
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Formula Builder or Insert ➤ Function.  
 

454
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  Ribbon : Choose Formulas ➤ Function Library ➤ Insert Function or 
choose a function from one of the pop-up menus in the Function 
Library group. For example, click the Date & Time pop-up menu 
and then click a function. You can also choose Home ➤ Editing ➤ 
AutoSum ➤ More Functions from the Ribbon.  
 3. 
 If you want to search for a function, click in the Search box at the 
top, and then start typing the function’s name. The Formula Builder 
displays a list of results, as shown on the left in Figure  15-16 . 
 Note   The Formula Builder appears docked to the right side of the Excel window at first. You can 
undock it and reposition it by clicking and dragging its title bar. You can then resize the Formula 
Builder window as needed; for example, making it taller to give yourself a better view of the function 
information. You can position the Formula Builder window outside the Excel window if you want. 
 Figure 15-16.   To find a function, start typing its name in the Search pane of the Formula Builder; the Formula Builder 
shows a list of results (left). Otherwise, browse the full list of functions, and click the function you want to see 
information on (right)  
 

455
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  4.  Otherwise, browse through the list of functions to find the function 
you need, as shown on the right in Figure  15-16 . The Formula Builder 
breaks the functions up into the following categories:
  Most Recently Used : This category provides quick access to the 
functions you’ve used most recently, so if you’re looking for a 
function you’ve used before, start by looking here.  
  All : This category contains the full list of functions.  
  Financial : This category contains functions for financial calculations, 
such as calculating the payments on your mortgage or the 
depreciation on an asset.  
  Date and Time : This category contains functions ranging from returning 
the current date with the  TODAY( ) function  to using the  WEEKDAY( ) 
function  to return the day of the week for a particular date.  
  Math and Trigonometry : This category contains mathematical 
functions, such as the  SQRT( ) function  for returning a square 
root, and trigonometric functions, such as the  COS( ) function  for 
calculating the cosine of an angle.  
  Statistical : This category contains functions for performing statistical 
calculations, such as working out standard deviations based on a 
population or a sample.  
  Lookup and Reference : This category contains functions for looking 
up data from other parts of a worksheet or referring to other cells in it.  
  Database : This category contains functions for working with 
databases; for example, returning the average of values in a column 
or list or the count of cells containing numbers in a field.  
  Text : This category contains functions for manipulating text, such as 
the  TRIM( ) function  (for trimming off leading and trailing spaces) and 
the  LEFT( ) function  , which returns the leftmost part of the value.  
  Logical : This category contains functions for performing logical 
tests, such as testing whether a particular cell contains an error.  
  Information : This category contains functions for returning 
information about data, such as whether it is text or a number.  
  Engineering : This category contains functions including the 
 DEC2HEX( ) function  (for converting a decimal number to 
hexadecimal, base 16) and the  HEX2OCT( ) function  (for converting 
a hexadecimal number to octal, base 8).  
  Cube : This category contains functions for manipulating data cubes, 
which are multi-dimensional sets of values.  

456
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
  Compatibility : This category contains functions included for 
compatibility with older versions of Excel. It’s best to use these 
functions only for compatibility with these older versions. If you’re 
developing worksheets for Excel 2015 or Excel 2013 (Windows), 
use the newer functions that these versions support; for example, 
use the new POISSON.DIST( ) function rather than the old 
 POISSON( ) function  .  
 5. 
 To learn more about a function, click it. The Formula Builder shows 
its details at the bottom of the window, as shown on the left in 
Figure  15-17 . 
 Figure 15-17.   Use the description at the bottom of the Formula Builder to identify the function you want (left). When 
you double-click the function to insert it, the Formula Builder displays the Arguments pane (right) 
 6. 
 When you’ve found the function you want to insert, click the Insert 
Function button. The Formula Builder displays the Arguments pane 
for the function, as shown on the right in Figure  15-15 (with one 
argument already entered).  
 

457
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 7. 
 Click in the box for the first argument, and then enter the data. You 
can type in a value or range name, type in a cell reference or range, 
or use the pointing device to choose a cell reference or range in the 
worksheet (or in another worksheet or workbook).  
 8. 
 Fill in each of the other arguments for the function. When you have 
entered all the required arguments, the Result readout to the left of 
the Done button in the Function Builder window shows the result of 
the function.  
 9. 
 Click the Done button or press Return to enter the function in the 
worksheet.  
 If you have finished using the Function Builder, close it by clicking its Close button (the button 
at the left end of its title bar) or by choosing View ➤ Formula Builder from the menu bar.  
 Inserting Functions with the  Function Library Pop-up Menus  
 When you know which function you want to insert, the easiest way to insert it (unless it’s 
one of the five functions on the AutoSum pop-up menu) is to use the pop-up menus in the 
Function Library group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon. These pop-up menus help you 
pick the function by category and insert it directly in the cell. 
 To insert a function using the pop-up menus, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the cell in which you want to enter the function.  
 2. 
 Click the Formulas tab of the Ribbon to display its contents.  
 3. 
 Go to the Function Library group at the left end of the Ribbon and 
locate the function category for the function you want to insert. There 
are nine categories: AutoSum (which we’ve discussed already), 
Recently Used, Financial, Logical, Text, Date & Time, Lookup & 
Reference, Math & Trig, and More Functions (which displays a 
submenu showing Statistical, Engineering, Cube, Information, 
Compatibility, and Web). As you’ll notice, these categories are similar 
to those that appear in the Formula Builder, discussed earlier in this 
chapter.  
 4. 
 Click the function category’s button to display the pop-up menu 
containing the functions. Figure  15-18 shows the Date and time 
submenu open.  

458
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 Figure 15-18.   Use the pop-up menus in the Function Library group on the Formulas tab of the Ribbon when you want 
to insert a function by category 
 5. 
 Click the function you want to insert. Excel inserts it in the cell and 
displays the Formula Builder.  
 6. 
 Enter the arguments for the function as usual.  
 7. 
 Press Return or click the Enter button on the Formula bar to enter the 
formula in the cell.  
 Inserting Functions by Typing Them into a Worksheet 
 You can also enter functions in your  worksheets  by typing them into cells. Follow these 
general steps:
 1. 
 Click the cell to select it.  
 2. 
 Type = to tell Excel that you’re creating a formula.  
 3. 
 Start typing the function’s name. Excel displays a list of matching 
functions (see Figure  15-19 ). 
 

459
CHAPTER 15: Crunching Numbers with Formulas and Functions
 4. 
 To enter a function, double-click it, or move the highlight to it by 
pressing down arrow or up arrow, and then press Return.  
 5. 
 Specify the arguments for the function. You can either type in a value 
or a reference or use the pointing device to select a cell or range.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to use formulas and functions to perform calculations in 
your workbooks. You now know that a formula is the recipe for a calculation, and you know 
how to assemble it from its various components—an equal sign, cell or range references, 
operators, and more. You also now know how to create the formulas you need and how to 
troubleshoot them when they go wrong. 
 You’re now also familiar with functions. You know that a function is a preset formula built 
into Excel, how to insert functions using the various tools Excel provides, and how to furnish 
functions with the arguments they need to work. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to create databases and solve business problems.  
 Figure 15-19.   When you start typing a function name into a cell, Excel lists matching functions. Click the function you 
want to insert  
 Note   You can also keep typing until you’ve typed enough to identify the function uniquely or type 
the whole of the function name if you prefer.

 Chapter 16  
 Creating Simple Databases 
and Solving Business 
Problems 
 Packed with more than 16,000 columns and more than 1 million rows, each Excel worksheet 
has enough space to contain serious amounts of data—so it’s great for creating a database 
to store information and quickly find the items you need. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn first to use Excel to create databases for storing information, sorting 
it, and filtering it to show the information you need. You’ll then learn to use Excel’s scenarios 
feature and its Goal Seek tool to solve business problems by performing what-if analysis. 
 Creating Databases in Excel 
 When you need to store a lot of the same type of information in a worksheet, you can create 
a database. For example, if you run a business, you can make a database of your customers 
and their orders. 
 The first step is to set up the database table and to tell Excel that you’re creating a database 
table rather than a regular worksheet. The next step is to add your data to the database. 
Once the data is in the database table, you can sort the table to reveal different aspects of 
its contents or filter it to identify items that match the criteria you specify. 
 Note   Excel refers to databases as  tables , which can be confusing if you’re used to that word’s 
normal meaning in the Office applications. So, this chapter refers to these databases as  database 
tables for clarity. 

462
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Understanding What You Can and Can’t Do with Excel 
Database Tables 
 Before you start creating a database table in Excel, it’s important to be clear on what you 
can and can’t do with Excel database tables. 
 As you know, an Excel worksheet consists of rows and columns. To create a database table on 
a worksheet, you make each row into a  record , an item that holds all the details of a single entry. 
For example, in a database table that  records  your sales to customers, a record would contain 
the details of a purchase. You make each column a  field in the database table—a column for 
the purchase number, a column for the date, a column for the customer’s last name, and so on. 
Figure  16-1 shows part of an Excel database table for tracking sales to customers.  
 Figure 16-1.   An Excel database consists of a table, with each row forming a record and each column containing a field 
 This is what’s called a   flat-file database  : all the data in the database is stored in a single 
table rather than in separate tables that are linked to each other. 
 This means you can use Excel to create any database for which you can store all the data 
for a record in a single row. Because you have a million rows at your disposal, you can 
create large databases if necessary, but they may make Excel run slowly. 
 

463
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 What you can’t do with Excel is create   relational databases —ones that store the data 
in linked tables. A relational database is the kind of database you create with full-bore 
database applications such as FileMaker or Microsoft Access (on Windows). In a  relational 
database  , every record has a unique ID number or field that the application uses to link the 
data in the different tables.  
 Creating a Database Table and Entering Data 
 In this section, you’ll look at how to create a database table and enter data in it. 
 Creating a Database Table 
 To  create  a database table, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a workbook as usual. For example, you can
  Create a new blank workbook : Press Cmd+N or choose File ➤ New 
Workbook from the menu bar. You can also click File toward the 
left end of the title bar, click Blank Workbook on the New tab of the 
Microsoft Excel dialog box, and then click Create.  
  Create a workbook based on a template or an existing workbook : 
Open the Microsoft Excel dialog box by clicking File toward the left 
end of the title bar, pressing Cmd+Shift+P, or choosing File ➤ New 
from Template. You can then click the template you want to use, and 
then click Create.  
  Open an existing workbook, choose File ➤ Save As from the 
menu bar to open the Save As sheet, and then save a copy of the 
workbook under a different name, in a different location, or both.  
 2. 
 Name the worksheet on which you’ll create the database table. Double-
click the worksheet tab, type the name you want (up to 31 characters, 
including spaces), and then press Return to apply the name.  
 3. 
 Type the headings for the database table. For example, if the database 
table will contain customer names and addresses, you type fields such 
as Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Title, Address 1, and so on. Try 
to get all the fields in place at this point; you can add columns to the 
table later, but you then need to add extra data to the existing records.  
 4. 
 Format the headings differently from the rows below them. For 
example, click the row header for the heading row, and then press 
Cmd+B to apply boldface.  
 5. 
 Select the headings and at least one row below them.  
 Note   Usually, it’s easiest to put the headings in the first row of the worksheet, but if you need to 
have information appear above the database table, leave rows free for that information. 

464
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 6. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table from the Ribbon or Insert ➤ Table from 
the menu bar to display the Create Table dialog box (see Figure  16-2 ).  
 7. 
 Make sure that the “Where is the data for your table?” box shows 
the correct range. If not, either type the correct range into the box or 
click and drag in the worksheet to enter it.  
 8. 
 Select the “My table has headers” check box (assuming your table 
has headers, as in the example).  
 9. 
 Click the OK button. Excel closes the Create Table dialog box and 
makes the following changes:
  Creates the table.  
  Gives the table a default name, such as Table1 or Table2. This name 
appears in the Table Name box in the Properties group on the Table 
tab of the Ribbon.  
  Turns the header row into headers with pop-up buttons.  
  Applies a table style with shading based on the workbook’s theme. 
You can change the style later as needed.  
  Displays the Table tab of the Ribbon, which contains controls for 
working with tables.  
 10. 
 Rename your table by following these steps:
  Choose Table ➤ Properties ➤ Table Name from the Ribbon, double-
clicking in the Table Name text box to select the default name.  
  Type the new name for the table. As with chart names, the database 
table name must be unique in the workbook, must start with a letter 
or an underscore, and cannot contain spaces or symbols.  
  Press Return to apply the table name.  
 Figure 16-2.   In the Create Table dialog box, verify that the “Where is the data for your table?” box shows the correct 
range and that the “My table has headers” check box is selected before clicking OK 
 

465
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Customizing  the Database Table’s Looks 
 At this point, you can start entering data in the database table (as discussed next)—but 
before you do, you may want to change the way it looks. To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click anywhere in the database table.  
 2. 
 Click the Table tab of the Ribbon if it’s not already displayed.  
 3. 
 If a suitable style appears in the Table Styles box on the Ribbon, 
click it. If not, hold the pointer over the Table Styles box to display 
the panel button, and then click the panel button to display the Table 
Styles panel (see Figure  16-3 ). Click the style you want to apply.  
 Figure 16-3.   You can format a table quickly by applying one of Excel’s table styles from the Table Styles panel on the 
Tables tab of the Ribbon. Scroll down the panel to see the other styles 
 

466
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 4. 
 In the Table Style Options group on the Tables tab of the Ribbon, 
select the check box for each table style option you want to use:
  Header row : Select this check box to display the header row. This is 
almost always useful.  
  Total row : Select this check box to add a row labeled Total immediately 
after the database table’s last row. This is useful when you need to add 
a total formula or another formula in the last row. To add a formula, click 
a cell, click the pop-up button that appears, and then click the formula 
you want on the pop-up menu (see Figure  16-4 ).  
  Banded rows : Select this check box to apply a band of color to 
every other row. This helps you read the rows of data without your 
eyes wandering to another row. Some table styles apply banding to 
the rows automatically.  
  First column : Select this check box if you want the first column to 
have different formatting. You may want to do this if the first column 
contains the main field for identifying each record (for example, a 
unique number).  
 Tip The pop-up menu in the Total row of a database table gives you instant access to the most 
widely used functions in databases—Average, Count, Count Numbers, Max, Min, Sum, StdDev 
(Standard Deviation), and Var (calculating variance based on a sample). You can also click the 
More Functions item at the bottom of the pop-up menu to display the Formula Builder, from which 
you can access the full range of Excel’s functions. For example, you can insert the COUNTBLANK() 
function to count the number of blank cells in a column. You might do this to ensure that a column 
of essential data contains no blanks.
 Figure 16-4.   Adding a Total row to a database table lets you quickly insert functions in the row’s cells 
 

467
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
  Last column : Select this check box if you want the last column to 
have different formatting. Usually, you want this only if the last column 
contains data that is more important in some way than the data in the 
other columns.  
  Banded columns : Select this check box to apply a band of color to 
every other column. This is sometimes helpful but usually less helpful 
than banded rows. (Don’t use both—the effect is seldom useful.)  
 When you’ve finished choosing a style and options for the database table, save your work 
as usual.  
 Entering Data in a Database Table 
 A database table is essentially an Excel worksheet at heart, so you can  enter data  in the 
database table by using the standard techniques you’ve learned in the past few chapters. 
For example, click a cell, and then type data into it; or, if you have the data in another 
worksheet, copy it and paste it in. 
 When you enter data in the row immediately after the last row in the database table, Excel 
automatically expands the database table to include that row. To add a row within the 
database table, click a cell in the row above which you want to add the new row, and then 
choose Insert ➤ Rows from the menu bar. Again, Excel automatically expands the database 
table to include the new row. 
 To insert a column in the database table, click a cell in the column before which you want to 
add the new column, and then choose Insert ➤ Columns from the menu bar. Again, Excel 
automatically expands the database table. 
 Resizing a Database Table 
 When you’ve created a database table, Excel normally  resizes  it for you automatically when 
you add or delete rows or columns. Excel also expands the database table automatically 
if you add data to the row after the current last row in a database table that doesn’t have a 
Total row. Excel calls this feature Table AutoExpansion. If you don’t want Excel to do this, 
click the AutoCorrect actions button that appears below and to the right of the first cell in 
the added row, and then click Undo Table AutoExpansion (see Figure  16-5 ). Click the actions 
button again, and then click Stop Automatically Expanding Tables. The data you entered in 
the row remains there, but you can use the Undo command to get rid of it if necessary.  
 Tip  You can quickly select a row, a column, or an entire database table with the pointing device. 
To select a row, move the pointer to the left part of a cell in the database table’s leftmost column, 
and then click with the horizontal arrow that appears. To select a column, move the pointer over 
a column heading, and then click with the downward arrow that appears. To select the whole 
database table, move the pointer over the upper-left cell in the database table, and then click with 
the diagonal arrow that appears. 

468
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Sorting a Database Table by One or More Fields 
 When you need to examine the data in your database table, it’s often useful to sort it. Excel 
lets you sort a database table either quickly by a single field or by using multiple fields. 
 Tip  If you need to be able to return a database table to its original order, include a column with 
sequential numbers in it. These numbers may be part of your records (for example, sequential 
sales numbers for transactions) or simply ID numbers for the records. In either case, you can use 
AutoFill to enter them quickly. To return the database table to its original order, you can then sort 
it by this column. 
 Figure 16-5.   You can use the AutoCorrect actions button both to undo Table AutoExpansion and to turn it off 
 Note   When you add a new row to a database table using Table AutoExpansion, Excel makes 
the change only when you start typing data in the row. When you do, Excel applies the style to 
the row, and you can see that it’s part of the database table. But until you start typing, it’s just 
another plain row. 
 Note   The Control Table AutoExpansion Options item on the AutoCorrect actions button gives you 
quick access to the Tables & Filters preferences pane in the Excel preferences window. 
 To turn Table AutoExpansion back on, choose Excel ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the 
comma key). In the Excel Preferences window, click the Tables & Filters icon in the Formulas and 
Lists area to display the Tables preferences pane. Select the Automatically expand tables check box, 
and then close the Excel Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the left 
end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W. 
 

469
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Sorting Quickly by a Single Field 
 To  sort a database table by a single field, click any cell in the column you want to sort by, 
and then choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Sort A to Z from the Ribbon. This produces a sort 
in ascending order (A to Z, low values to high values, early dates to later dates, and so on). 
To reverse the sort to descending order, choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Sort Z to A from the 
Ribbon. 
 After you sort, the database table remains sorted that way until you change it.  
 Sorting a Database Table by Multiple Fields 
 Often, it’s useful to sort your database table by two or more fields at the same time. For 
example, in a customer database, you may need to sort your customers first by state and 
then by city within the state. 
 To sort by multiple fields, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click any cell in the database table.  
 2. 
 Choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Sort from the Ribbon or Data ➤ Sort 
from the menu bar to display the Sort dialog box. Figure  16-6 shows 
the Sort dialog box with two criteria entered and a third criterion 
under way. 
 Figure 16-6.   In the Sort dialog box, you can set up exactly the sort criteria you need to identify data in your database 
 

470
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 3. 
 Set up your first sort criterion using the controls on the first row of 
the main part of the Sort dialog box. Follow these steps:
  Open the Column pop-up menu in the Sort by row, and then click 
the column you want to sort by first. For example, click the State 
column. 
  Open the Sort On pop-up menu in the same row, and then click 
what you want to sort by: Values, Cell Color, Font Color, or Cell Icon. 
In most cases, you’ll want to use Values, but the other three items 
are useful for tables to which you’ve applied conditional formatting.  
  Open the Order pop-up menu on the same row, and then click the sort 
order you want. If you choose Values in the Sort On pop-up menu, you 
can choose A to Z for an ascending sort, Z to A for a descending sort, 
or Custom List. Choosing Custom List opens the Custom List dialog 
box, in which you can choose a custom list by which to sort the results. 
For example, you could use a custom list of your company’s products 
or offices to sort the database into a custom order rather than being 
restricted to ascending or descending order.  
  If you need the sort to be case sensitive (so that “smith” appears 
before “Smith,” and so on), click the Options button. In the Sort 
Options dialog box (see Figure  16-7 ), select the Case sensitive 
check box, and then click the OK button.  
 4. 
 Click the Add (+) button to add a second line of controls to the main 
part of the Sort dialog box.  
 5. 
 Set up the criterion for the second-level sort on the Then by line 
using the same technique as in step 3. For example, set up a 
second-level sort using the City column in the database.  
 6. 
 Set up any other criteria needed by repeating steps 4 and 5.  
 7. 
 Click the OK button to close the Sort dialog box. Excel sorts the data 
using the criteria you specified.  
 Figure 16-7.   Select the Case sensitive check box in the Sort Options dialog box if you want to treat lowercase letters 
differently than their uppercase versions 
 

471
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Identifying and Removing Duplicate Records  in a 
Database Table 
 When you’ve created a large database table, you may need to check it for duplicate records 
and remove those you find. Excel provides a Remove Duplicates feature that saves you 
having to comb the records by hand. 
 To remove duplicate records from a database table, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click any cell in the database table.  
 2. 
 Choose Table ➤ Data Tools ➤ Remove Duplicates from the Ribbon 
or Data ➤ Table Tools ➤ Remove Duplicates from the menu bar to 
display the window shown in Figure  16-8 . 
 Caution   Two warnings before removing duplicate values. First, make sure you have a backup 
copy of your database workbook; for example, use Finder to copy the current version of a file to a 
safe location. Second, be certain you know which fields in the database table should contain unique 
values and which can contain duplicate values. For example, a customer ID number field must be 
unique because each customer has a different ID number, but a customer last name field can’t 
reasonably be unique because many customers will likely share last names. Most databases need a 
unique ID number or code of this type. 
 Note   When you’re sorting data that’s not in a database table, there are two main differences. 
First, the “My list has headers” check box in the Sort dialog box is available, and you must select 
it if the data range you’re sorting includes a header row. (Otherwise, Excel sorts the headers into 
the data range, which is ugly.) Second, you can select the “Sort left to right” option button in 
the Sort Options dialog box to sort columns rather than rows, a choice that’s not available in a 
database table.  

472
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 3. 
 If the Select All check box contains a check mark, click the check 
box to remove the check mark, and clear all the check boxes in the 
Columns box.  
 4. 
 Select the check box for each column you want to check for 
duplicates. The readout at the bottom of the dialog box shows the 
number of duplicates.  
 5. 
 Click the Remove Duplicates button if you want to remove the 
duplicates.  
 6. 
 Repeat the process with another column if necessary.  
 7. 
 When you have finished removing duplicates, click the red Close 
button at the left end of the title bar to close the window.  
 Filtering a Database Table 
 When you need to find records in a database table that match the terms you specify, you 
can   filter it. Filtering makes Excel display only the records that match your search terms, 
hiding all the other records. 
 Tip   Normally, it’s best to check a single column for duplicate values at a time. Make sure that the 
column is one that must contain a unique value. 
 Figure 16-8.   Use this window to locate duplicate values in columns that should contain only unique values. The 
window’s title bar shows the name of the database table 
 

473
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 To make filtering easy, Excel provides a feature named  AutoFilter  . To use AutoFilter, follow 
these steps:
 1. 
 Click a cell in the database table.  
 2. 
 Click the Data tab of the Ribbon to display its contents.  
 3. 
 In the Sort & Filter group, make sure that the Filter button is selected 
so that it looks pushed in; if not, click the main part of the button. 
Excel normally selects the Filter button when you create a database 
table, so this button should be pushed in unless you’ve turned 
filtering off. Selecting this button makes Excel display a pop-up 
button on each column heading in the database table.  
 4. 
 On the column you want to use for filtering, click the pop-up button to 
display the AutoFilter window (shown on the left in Figure  16-9 ). The 
AutoFilter window’s title bar shows the name of the field you clicked.  
 Note   You can also search for records by using Excel’s Find feature. Choose Edit ➤ Find ➤ Find 
from the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+F to display the Find dialog box, type your search term in 
the Find What box, and then click the Find Next button. Filtering displays all the matching records 
together rather than spread out in the database table, so it’s often more convenient than using Find. 
 Figure 16-9.   To apply filtering, click the pop-up arrow on a column heading to display the AutoFilter window (left). 
In the Filter area, open the first pop-up menu, and choose the comparison you want. You can then add further 
comparisons as needed 
 

474
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 5. 
 Click the type of sorting or filtering you want to apply:
  Sort : Click the type of sort you want to apply. Normally, you click 
either the Ascending button or the Descending button. But if your 
database table uses colors, you can sort by color instead—just 
choose the color in the By color pop-up menu in the Sort area.  
  Filter : If you want to filter the table by color, choose the color in the 
By color pop-up menu. Otherwise, open the pop-up menu that 
appears as Choose One in the left part of Figure  16-9 , and then 
choose the comparison from it. For example, choose Equals to set a 
filter that picks particular states, or choose Begins With to set a filter 
than selects cities that start with text you specify. Use the fields in 
the Custom AutoFilter window to set up the rest of the comparison; 
the right screen in Figure  16-9 shows an example that filters by 
Equals AK or Equals AL, returning the records that have the state 
AK or the state AL.  
 When you’ve specified the details of the filter, Excel applies it to the database table and 
reduces the display to those rows that match the filter. Excel displays a filter symbol in place 
of the drop-down button on the column that contains the filtering (as on the State column 
heading in Figure  16-10 ). 
 Note  The filter comparisons depend on the contents of the column you selected in the database 
table. For example, if the column contains numbers, the comparisons include the mathematical 
comparisons Greater Than, Greater Than or Equal To, Less Than, Less Than or Equal To, Between, 
Top 10, Bottom 10, Above Average, and Below Average. If the column contains dates, the 
comparisons include Before, After, Between, Tomorrow, Next Week, Next Month, and Next Year. 
 Figure 16-10.   The filter symbol (shown on the State column heading here) indicates that you’re filtering the database 
table by that column  
 

475
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 To remove filtering from a single column, click the filter symbol on the column heading, and 
then click the Clear Filter button in the AutoFilter window. 
 To remove filtering from the database table as a whole, choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Filter, 
unpressing the Filter button in the Sort & Filter group. 
 Solving Business Problems with Scenarios and 
Goal Seek 
 For much of your work with Excel, you probably want to manipulate the hard data you 
already have, as you’ve been doing so far in this part of the book. But other times, you may 
need to ask questions of your data; for example, by how much do you need to raise prices 
to boost your revenue by a certain amount, or what will happen if you cut 10 percent off your 
manufacturing costs? 
 In this section, you’ll look at two tools Excel gives you for performing what-if analysis:
  Scenarios : Use scenarios when you want to experiment with different 
data in your worksheet without changing the core data that you 
already have.  
  Goal Seek : Use Goal Seek when you need to make one cell’s value 
reach a particular figure by changing one other value.  
 Examining Different Scenarios in a Worksheet 
 After you’ve built a worksheet, you may want to experiment with different data in it. For 
example, if you’re setting budgets, you may need to play around with different figures for the 
different departments to get the overall balance you require. 
 You can experiment with different data by changing the values directly in your worksheet—
but then you may need to restore your original values afterward. Another approach is to 
create multiple copies of the worksheet (or of the workbook) and then change the values in 
the copies, leaving the original untouched. This works fine, but if you then need to change 
the original worksheet (for example, adding another column of data), the changes quickly 
become messy. 
 Note   If AutoFilter doesn’t give you the flexibility you need, you can also create custom filters 
manually. To do this, you insert extra rows above the database table to create a criteria range, enter 
the criteria in the appropriate columns, choose Data ➤ Sort & Filter ➤ Advanced, and then work in 
the Advanced Filter dialog box. This topic is beyond the scope of this book, so look it up (online or 
offline) if you need to perform filtering that AutoFilter can’t manage. 

476
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Instead of working in these awkward ways, you can use Excel’s scenarios. A  scenario is a 
way of entering different values into a set of cells without changing the underlying values. 
You can switch from one scenario to another as needed, and you can merge scenarios from 
different versions of the same worksheet into a single worksheet. 
 Creating the  Worksheet  for Your Scenarios 
 Start by creating the workbook and worksheet you’ll use for your scenarios. If you have an 
existing workbook with the data in it, go ahead and open it. Set up the data and formulas in 
your worksheet as usual. 
 Figure  16-11 shows the sample worksheet this section uses as an example. The worksheet 
summarizes the financial returns from a modest portfolio of rental properties.  
 Figure 16-11.   To start using scenarios, create a worksheet containing your existing data and the formulas needed 
 Tip   To make your scenarios easy to set up and adjust, define a name for each cell that you will 
change in the scenario. Click the cell, choose Insert ➤ Name ➤ Define from the menu bar to 
display the Define Name dialog box, and then work as described in the “Referring to Named Cells 
and Ranges” section in Chapter   15  . For example, type the name in the “Enter a name for the data 
range” text box, and then click the Add (+) button to add the name and leave the dialog box open so 
that you can click another cell and define a name for it too. 
 

477
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Here’s what you see on the worksheet:
  The Property Address column shows each property’s address.  
  The Monthly Rent column shows each property’s monthly rent. Cell 
B10 contains a SUM() formula to produce the total rent. Each of the 
cells here has a name to make it easy to recognize: Rent_Lincoln, Rent_
Pacific_A, and so on.  
  The Operating Costs column shows the monthly operating cost for 
each property, including all mortgage costs and other financial horrors. 
Cell C10 uses a SUM()  formula to produce the total running cost. The 
numbers in this column are rounded. Each of these cells has a name: 
Costs_Lincoln, Costs_Pacific_A, and so forth. Again, this is so that we 
can refer to the cells easily and clearly.  
  The Property Profit column shows how much profit each rental unit 
returns after subtracting the operating cost from the rent (for example, 
cell D5 contains the sum =B5-C5). The numbers in this column are 
rounded. Cell D10 uses a SUM() formula to return the total profit.  
  The Property Profitability column shows the property’s profitability 
as a percentage. To produce the profitability figure, divide the 
Property Profit value by the Monthly Rent value; for example, cell E5 
contains the formula = D5/B5. At the bottom of the column, cell E10 
uses an AVERAGE()  formula  to show the average profitability of the 
properties.  
  The Financial Contribution column shows each property’s 
contribution to the total profit as a percentage. To produce the 
contribution figure, divide each property’s profit by the total profit 
in cell D10. For example, cell F9 contains the formula =D9/D$10, 
using a mixed reference to keep the row absolute when copying 
the formula. Cell F10 contains a SUM() formula that adds the 
percentages, showing that they total 100%.  
 Times are bad, and the total profit is too low. So let’s use scenarios to see how to improve 
matters by raising rents and shaving costs.  
 Opening the  Scenario Manager Dialog Box  
 When you’re ready to start working with scenarios, choose Data ➤ Data Tools ➤ What-If 
Analysis ➤ Scenario Manager from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Scenarios from the menu bar to 
display the Scenario Manager dialog box. At first, when the workbook contains no scenarios, 
the Scenario Manager dialog box appears as shown in Figure  16-12 . 

478
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Creating  Scenarios  
 After opening the Scenario Manager dialog box, you can create your scenarios. 
 To create a scenario, follow these steps:
 1. 
 From the Scenario Manager dialog box, click the Add (+) button to 
display the Add Scenario dialog box (see Figure  16-13 ). 
 Tip   First, create a scenario containing your original data. This gives you an easy way to go back to 
the original data when you’ve finished testing scenarios. 
 Figure 16-12.   At first, the Scenario Manager dialog box contains nothing but the message “No Scenarios defined.” 
Click the Add (+) button to get started  
 

479
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 2. 
 In the Scenario name text box, type a descriptive name for the 
scenario.  
 3. 
 Click in the Changing cells text box, and then enter the details of the 
cells that users of the scenario are allowed to change; for example, 
cells B5:B9.
  Click and drag in the worksheet to select a range of contiguous 
cells. If you need to select noncontiguous cells, click the first, and 
then Cmd-click each other cell.  
  You can also type the name of a range into the Changing cells 
text box.  
  There’s a Collapse Dialog button to the right of the Changing cells 
text box, but you don’t need to use it because Excel automatically 
collapses the Add Scenario dialog box when you click and drag 
in the worksheet. After you’ve selected the changing cells, Excel 
expands the dialog box again.  
 4. 
 In the Comment text box, you can type a comment that explains what 
the scenario is and how to use it. Excel creates a default comment of 
 Created by , your user name (as set in the Office applications), and the 
date, but a descriptive comment is usually more helpful.  
 Figure 16-13.   Use the Add Scenario dialog box to set up each scenario. First, create a scenario for your original data so 
that you can easily return to it  
 

480
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 5. 
 Choose settings as needed in the Protection area at the bottom of 
the dialog box:
  Prevent changes : Select this check box when you need to prevent 
changes to the scenario. To make the protection take effect, you 
need to protect the worksheet as described in the next section.  
  Hide : Select this check box when you need to prevent others 
from seeing this scenario; for example, because you want them to 
experiment with their own figures rather than looking at your figures. 
Again, you need to protect the worksheet.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Add Scenario dialog box. Excel 
displays the Scenario Values dialog box (see Figure  16-14 ). This 
dialog box shows a list box containing the changing cells in the 
scenario. Here’s where you see the benefit of naming the changing 
cells—each text box is easy to identify. If you haven’t named the 
changing cells, the cell addresses appear, and you may need to refer 
to the worksheet to see which cell is which.  
 7. 
 Click each changing cell and verify the value in the “Please Enter 
a Value” box. Normally, you’d be entering values here for the new 
scenario, but because this scenario is for the original figures, you 
don’t need to change them.  
 8. 
 Click the OK button to close the Scenario Values dialog box. Excel 
returns you to the Scenario Manager dialog box, where the scenario 
now appears in the Scenarios list box.  
 Figure 16-14.   In the Scenario Values dialog box, enter the values to use for the new scenario you’re creating. The cell names 
produce the labels (Rent_Lincoln and so on), which are much easier to refer to than cell addresses (for example, B5)  
 

481
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 To add another scenario, click the Add button in the Scenario Manager dialog box, and then 
repeat the previous process. This time, change the figures for the scenario in step 7.  
 Applying Protection to Your Scenarios 
 If you selected either the Prevent changes check box or the Hide check box in the 
 Protection  area of the Add Scenario dialog box, you need to protect the worksheet to make 
the protection take effect. 
 To protect the worksheet, follow these steps:
 1. 
 If the Scenario Manager dialog box is open, click the Close button to 
close it.  
 2. 
 Choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ Protect Sheet from the Ribbon or 
Tools ➤ Protection ➤ Protect Sheet from the menu bar to display the 
Protect the sheet and contents of locked cells sheet.  
 3. 
 Type a password in the Password text box and the Verify text box.  
 4. 
 In the “Allow users of this sheet to” box, make sure the Edit 
scenarios check box is cleared.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the dialog box. Excel applies the 
protection.  
 6. 
 Save the workbook. For example, press Cmd+S or click the Save 
button on the title bar.  
 After protecting the scenarios in the worksheet like this, you need to turn off the protection 
before you can edit the scenarios. To turn off the protection, choose Review ➤ Changes ➤ 
Protect Sheet from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Protection ➤ Unprotect Sheet from the menu bar, 
type the password in the sheet that Excel displays, and then click the OK button.  
 Editing and  Deleting  Scenarios 
 From the Scenario Manager dialog box, you can quickly edit a scenario by clicking it in the 
Scenarios list box, clicking the Edit button, and then working in the Edit Scenario dialog box. 
Excel automatically updates the scenario’s comment for you with details of the modification 
(for example, “Modified by Jack Cunningham on 07/18/2016”), but you may want to type in 
more details, such as what you’re trying to make the scenario show. 
 When you no longer need a scenario, delete it by clicking the scenario in the Scenarios list 
box and clicking the Delete button. Excel doesn’t confirm the deletion; but if you delete 
a scenario by mistake, and recovering it is more important than losing any other changes 
you’ve made since you last saved the workbook, you can recover the scenario by closing 
the workbook without saving changes (assuming the scenario was already saved in the 
workbook). For example, choose File ➤ Close from the menu bar, and then click the Don’t 
Save button in the dialog box that prompts you to save the changes to the file.  

482
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Switching  Among Your Scenarios 
 Once you’ve created multiple scenarios for the same worksheet, you can switch among 
them by clicking the scenario you want in the Scenarios list box in the Scenario Manager 
dialog box (see Figure  16-15 ) and then clicking the Show button. Excel displays the 
scenario’s figures in the worksheet’s cells. The Scenario Manager dialog box stays open, so 
you can quickly switch to another scenario.  
 Merging  Scenarios into a Single Worksheet 
 If you develop and share your scenarios in a single workbook, you can keep them all 
together. But other times you may need to develop your scenarios in separate workbooks 
and then combine them. You can do this easily by using the Merge command in the 
Scenario Manager dialog box. 
 To merge scenarios, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open all the workbooks containing the scenarios you will merge.  
 2. 
 Make active the workbook and worksheet you will merge the 
scenarios into.  
 Figure 16-15.   To switch to another scenario, click the scenario in the Scenarios list box in the Scenario Manager dialog 
box, and then click the Show button  
 

483
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 3. 
 Choose Data ➤ Data Tools ➤ What-If Analysis ➤ Scenario Manager 
from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Scenarios from the menu bar to display 
the Scenario Manager dialog box.  
 4. 
 Click the Merge button to display the Merge Scenarios dialog box 
(see Figure  16-16 ). 
 5. 
 Open the Book pop-up menu, and choose the open workbook that 
contains the scenarios you want to merge in. The Sheet list box 
shows a list of the worksheets in the workbook.  
 6. 
 In the Sheet list box, click the worksheet that contains the scenarios. 
The readout at the bottom of the Merge Scenarios dialog box shows 
how many scenarios the worksheet contains, which helps you pick 
the right worksheet.  
 7. 
 Click the OK button. Excel closes the Merge Scenarios dialog box, 
merges the scenarios, and then displays the Scenario Manager 
dialog box again.  
 Creating  Reports  from Your Scenarios 
 Sometimes you can make the decisions you need by simply creating scenarios and looking 
at them in the worksheet. Other times, it’s helpful to create a report from the scenarios so 
that you can compare them. Excel gives you an easy way to create either a summary report 
or a PivotTable report straight from the Scenario Manager dialog box. 
 Note   If any scenario you merge into the active worksheet has the same name as an existing 
scenario in the worksheet, Excel adds the current date to the incoming scenario to distinguish it. 
 Figure 16-16.   In the Merge Scenarios dialog box, choose the workbook and worksheet that contain the scenarios you 
want to merge into the active workbook 
 

484
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 To create a report from your scenarios, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Data ➤ Data Tools ➤ What-If Analysis ➤ Scenario Manager 
from the Ribbon or Tools ➤ Scenarios from the menu bar to display 
the Scenario Manager dialog box.  
 2. 
 Click the Summary button to display the Scenario Summary dialog 
box (see Figure  16-17 ). 
 3. 
 In the Report type box, select the Scenario summary option button 
if you want to create a summary worksheet. If you want to create a 
scenario PivotTable, select the Scenario PivotTable option button. 
(Chapter   17 explains what PivotTables are and how you work with 
them.) 
 4. 
 Click in the Result cells text box, and then enter the addresses of the 
cells whose results you want the report or PivotTable to show. You 
can type in addresses or range names or select the appropriate cells 
in the worksheet.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Scenario Summary dialog box. 
Excel creates the report or PivotTable. Figure  16-18 shows a sample 
of a summary report, which Excel places on a new worksheet named 
Scenario Summary at the beginning of the workbook.  
 Note  If you select the Scenario PivotTable option button in the Scenario Summary dialog box, 
Excel inserts a new worksheet with a default name (such as Sheet2) containing a PivotTable and 
displays the PivotTable Builder window so that you can change the PivotTable to suit your needs. 
See Chapter   17  for information on PivotTables. 
 Figure 16-17.   In the Scenario Summary dialog box, choose between a scenario summary and a scenario PivotTable, 
and then select the result cells for the summary 
 

485
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 Using Goal Seek 
 When you’re planning or forecasting, you’ll often need to work backward from your target to 
derive the figures you need. For example, when planning your next financial year, you may 
need to find out how much you need to raise the selling price for your widgets to make an 
extra $30,000 a year. 
 To work this out, you can try increasing the unit price for the widgets until your revenue 
figure is $30,000 higher. But you can save time and effort by using Excel’s Goal Seek feature 
to derive the required price automatically by working backward from the revenue figure. 
 To derive values using  Goal Seek  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook that contains the data, and navigate to the 
worksheet that contains the calculation.  
 2. 
 Make active the cell that contains the formula.  
 3. 
 Choose Data ➤ Data Tools ➤ What-If Analysis ➤ Goal Seek from the 
Ribbon or choose Tools ➤ Goal Seek from the menu bar to display 
the Goal Seek dialog box (shown in Figure  16-19 with settings 
chosen).  
 Figure 16-18.   Excel places a summary report on a new worksheet named Scenario Summary at the beginning 
of the workbook 
 

486
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 4. 
 Make sure the Set cell text box contains the cell that contains the 
formula. (If you selected the cell in Step 2, it will.) If necessary, change 
the cell either by typing the correct reference or by double-clicking the 
current contents of the Set cell text box (to select it) and then clicking 
the right cell in the worksheet. (You can also click the Collapse Dialog 
button to collapse the Goal Seek dialog box, but the dialog box is so 
small anyway that it’s usually easier to work around it.)  
 5. 
 In the To value text box, type the value you want to get.  
 6. 
 In the “By changing cell” text box, enter the cell whose value you 
want to change; in the example, the cell containing the price of the 
widgets. Again, you can type the cell reference or simply click the 
cell in the worksheet.  
 7. 
 Click the OK button. Goal Seek calculates the answer, enters it in 
the worksheet, and then displays the Goal Seek Status dialog box 
(see Figure  16-20 ). 
 Figure 16-20.   When Excel displays the Goal Seek Status dialog box, look at the value in the target cell in the 
worksheet. Click the OK button if you want to keep the value. Click the Cancel button if you want to revert to the 
previous value  
 Figure 16-19.   Use the Goal Seek dialog box to work backward from your desired result to the figure you need 
 
 

487
CHAPTER 16: Creating Simple Databases and Solving Business Problems
 8. 
 Look at the value in the target cell. Click the OK button if you want to 
keep it. Click the Cancel button if you want to go back to the 
previous value.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to create a database table in Excel—a flat-file database 
rather than the relational type of database that you create with a database application such 
as Microsoft Access. You now know how to set up a database table, choose display options 
for it, format it to look the way you want, and add data to it. You’ve gained the essential 
skills of sorting the data into the sort order you need or filtering it to show the records you’re 
interested in. 
 You also learned how to use Excel’s scenarios to explore how different values affect a 
worksheet and how to use Goal Seek to work backward from a desired result to the value 
needed to produce it.  
 Tip  If you find Goal Seek useful, take a look at the Solver, which you can download for free from 
the Solver.com web site (   www.solver.com/mac/  ). Whereas Goal Seek lets you change only one 
variable, the Solver lets you change multiple variables. This enables you to ask more complex 
questions of your data. 
 Note   If the calculation is straightforward, Goal Seek finds a solution quickly. But if the calculation 
is more complex, Goal Seek may take a while. If this happens, you can click the Pause button in 
the Goal Seek Status dialog box to pause the calculation to see which value Goal Seek is trying at 
the moment. If you want to follow the individual values Goal Seek is trying, click the Step button to 
display the next value but keep the calculation paused; keep clicking the Step button as needed to 
see further values. Click the Resume button when you want Goal Seek to resume the calculation at 
full speed.

 Chapter 17  
 Manipulating Data with 
PivotTables 
 In this chapter, you’ll look at how you can manipulate the data in your worksheets to draw 
conclusions from it by creating PivotTables. PivotTables are great for asking questions of 
your data and looking at the data in different ways without having to enter it multiple times in 
separate worksheets. 
 You’ll start by going over what PivotTables are and what you can do with them. After that, 
I’ll show you how to create a PivotTable either by using  Excel’s automated tool  , which can 
give you a jump-start by creating a recommended PivotTable that you can adjust as needed, 
or by placing the fields on the PivotTable framework manually, which gives you total control. 
 After you build a PivotTable, you may need to change it so that it shows different data or 
shows the same data differently. I’ll show you several examples of the types of changes you 
can make easily to a PivotTable once you’ve constructed it. 
 When the PivotTable is arranged the way you need it, you can format the PivotTable and 
choose options to control how it appears. And you can sort and filter the data within the 
PivotTable to show only the information you’re after. 
 Understanding What PivotTables Are and What You 
Can Do with Them 
 A PivotTable is a special kind of report that rearranges the fields and records in a table into a 
different order so that you can examine their relationships. You  pivot (in other words, rotate) 
the columns in a PivotTable to display the data summarized in a different way. 

490
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 For example, take a look at the worksheet shown in Figure  17-1 . This  worksheet  contains 
a database table that tracks sales made by a company with four product lines: Hardware, 
Software, Services, and Supplies. The table uses the following columns:
  Sale : A unique sequential number used to identify each sale.  
  Year, Month, and Day : The year, month, and day of the sale. Having 
these items in separate columns makes it easier to filter by time; for 
example, to compare one month against another or to see which 
salesperson sold what in January.  
  Salesperson : The name of the sales rep who executed the sale.  
  Line : The product line of the product sold.  
  Product : The name of the product sold.  
  Quantity : The quantity of the product sold.  
  Price : The unit price of the product sold.  
  Total Price : The total price of the products sold (Quantity multiplied 
by Price).  
  Customer : The name of the company or organization that bought 
the products.  
 Figure 17-1.   The sample table you’ll use for creating PivotTables in this chapter 
 

491
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 This is all straightforward. You can also easily see your sum total of sales (for example, 
by adding the figures in the Total Price column). But when you need to dig into the details, 
you need a different tool. 
 This is where PivotTables come in. By creating a PivotTable from a data table such as this, 
you can quickly find the answers to questions such as these:
  Which is your best-selling product line? And your best-selling product?  
  How do this year’s sales stack up against last year’s?  
  Who was your star salesperson for March? And does another 
salesperson need a quick application of the spurs?  
  Who are your key customers? Who needs more one-on-one attention to 
bring sales up to where they were last year?  
 In the following sections, you’ll put together a PivotTable with the data in the data table and 
then manipulate it to see what it shows. 
 Creating and Laying Out a PivotTable 
 You can create a PivotTable either from a database table or from a range of data. If you 
have a database table already, as in the example, you can create the PivotTable from that. 
Otherwise, create the database table you’ll use, or enter the data in a worksheet as usual 
without creating a database table. 
 Once your data is ready, you can create a PivotTable either automatically, using the 
Recommended PivotTables command, or manually. Which works best depends on your data 
and what you’re trying to do with it, but often you can save time by creating a PivotTable 
automatically and then adjusting it as necessary. If an automatic PivotTable turns out not to 
be what you need, you can create the PivotTable manually from scratch instead. 
 Creating a PivotTable Automatically 
 To create a PivotTable  automatically  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook and display the worksheet that contains the 
table or data you’ll use in the PivotTable.  
 2. 
 Click in the table that you’ll use for the PivotTable. If you’ll use a 
range rather than a named table, select the range.  
 Note   If you want to work through the examples in this chapter, you need a database table like the 
one shown in the screens. You can either create one yourself or (much easier) download the sample 
workbook from the book's page on the Apress web site (   www.apress.com  ). 

492
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 3. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Recommended PivotTables from the 
Ribbon. Excel then does the following:
  Inserts a new worksheet with a default name, such as Sheet5  
  Inserts an automatic PivotTable on that worksheet, using a 
recommended layout  
  Displays the PivotTable Builder window  
  Adds the PivotTable Analyze tab and the Design tab to the Ribbon, and 
displays the PivotTable Analyze tab  
  Displays some information about PivotTables the first time you create one  
 Figure  17-2 shows the automatic PivotTable produced from the sample data table, with the 
PivotTable Builder window positioned in front of the worksheet. You can move the PivotTable 
Builder window to outside the Excel window if you find that arrangement more convenient.  
 Figure 17-2.   The quickest way to create a PivotTable is to have Excel create a recommended PivotTable automatically. 
You will usually need to adjust the PivotTable using the PivotTable Builder window to make the PivotTable show the 
information you want. Depending on the data you’re using, the PivotTable may look substantially different from this one 
 

493
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 After creating a PivotTable automatically, you’ll normally need to adjust it. This is because 
Excel seldom guesses exactly which information you need where. 
 To adjust a PivotTable, use the techniques you’ll learn in the next section, which shows you 
how to build a PivotTable from scratch.  
 Creating a PivotTable Manually 
 If creating a recommended PivotTable automatically doesn’t give a useful result or if you prefer 
to do things by hand, you can build the PivotTable manually using the  PivotTable Builder  . 
 To create a PivotTable manually, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook, and display the worksheet that contains the 
table or data you’ll use in the PivotTable.  
 2. 
 Click in the table that you’ll use for the PivotTable. If you’ll use a 
range rather than a named table, select the range.  
 3. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ PivotTable from the Ribbon or Data 
➤ Summarize with PivotTable from the menu bar to display the 
Create PivotTable dialog box (see Figure  17-3 ). If you’re using a 
named table, you can also choose Table ➤ Tools ➤ Summarize with 
PivotTable from the Ribbon; if you’re using a range, this command 
isn’t available.  
 Figure 17-3.   In the  Create PivotTable dialog box , first choose the table or range of data from which to create the 
PivotTable. Then choose whether to put the PivotTable on a new worksheet or on an existing worksheet 
 4. 
 In the “Choose the data that you want to analyze” area at the top of 
the Create PivotTable dialog box, click the Select a table or a range 
option button.  
 

494
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 5. 
 Make sure the  Table/Range text box  in the “Choose the data that 
you want to analyze” area shows the table or range you want to use. 
If you click in the table or select the range in step 2, you’ll be all set. 
If not, type in the table name or click and drag in the worksheet to 
select the range. If necessary, click the Collapse Dialog button first to 
get the Create PivotTable dialog box out of the way first.  
 6. 
 In the “Choose where to place the PivotTable” area of the Create 
PivotTable dialog box, choose the appropriate option button:
  New worksheet : Select this option button if you want to place the 
PivotTable on a new worksheet. This is often clearest because it 
gives you plenty of room for the PivotTable.  
  Existing worksheet : Select this option button if you want to place 
the PivotTable on an existing worksheet. Then click in the Table/
Range text box, click the worksheet’s tab, and then click-drag 
in the worksheet to enter the location. Again, you can click the 
Collapse Dialog button to collapse the Create PivotTable dialog 
box if necessary.  
 7. 
 Click the OK button to close the Create PivotTable dialog box. Excel 
positions a PivotTable framework on a new worksheet or the existing 
worksheet you chose and displays the PivotTable Builder window. 
Figure  17-4 shows the PivotTable framework on a new worksheet 
named Sheet5.  
 Note  Instead of creating a PivotTable from data in a worksheet, you can create a PivotTable from 
an external data source such as a FileMaker database or Access database. To do so, you select 
the “Use an external data source” option button in the “Choose the data that you want to analyze” 
area of the Create PivotTable dialog box, click the Choose Connection button, and then select the 
data source. Before you can do this, you must install an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver 
to enable Excel to connect to the data source. To find a suitable driver, search online including the 
terms  Excel 2016 ,  ODBC driver , and the type of database you need to connect to.

CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Now that you’ve inserted the framework for the PivotTable, you can add fields to it from the 
Field name list box in the PivotTable Builder window. 
 Understanding the Contents of the PivotTable Builder Window 
 Take a moment to look at the  PivotTable Builder window  . You use this window to set up the 
fields for your PivotTable. As you do so, Excel adds the fields to the appropriate places on 
the PivotTable framework. 
 Here are the essentials you need to know:
  Field name list box : This list box in the PivotTable Builder window 
contains an entry for each of the fields that Excel found in the data table 
or range you chose. Each item in the list has a check box that you can 
select to add the field to the PivotTable or clear to remove the field from 
the PivotTable.  
  Filters : This box shows the filters you apply to the PivotTable. After 
applying filters, you can drag them into a different order if necessary.  
 Figure 17-4.   When you insert a PivotTable manually, Excel creates an  empty framework on which you lay out the 
PivotTable the way you need it  
 

496
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Columns : This box shows the fields you add as columns to the 
PivotTable. After adding fields, you can drag them up and down the 
Columns box as needed to arrange the columns into the order in which 
you want them to appear on the PivotTable.  
  Rows : This box shows the fields you add as rows to the PivotTable. 
After adding fields, you can drag them up or down the Rows box to 
rearrange the order of the rows in the PivotTable.  
  Values : This box contains the fields you add as values to the PivotTable 
and the fields that Excel adds automatically. You can drag the fields up 
or down the Values box to change their order as needed.  
 If this doesn’t make sense yet, don’t worry: you’ll see how PivotTables work in just a moment.  
 Adding the Fields to the PivotTable Framework 
 To create the PivotTable, you  add fields  to the PivotTable framework by dragging fields to 
the Filters box, the Rows box, the Columns box, and the Values box in the PivotTable 
Builder window. 
 Note   You can also add fields by selecting their check boxes in the Field name list box. When you 
select a field, Excel places it automatically depending on what its contents appear to be. Because 
Excel doesn’t know what your data represents and what you’re trying to show, it often puts the field 
in the wrong place. So it’s usually best to place the fields yourself by dragging them. 
 Which fields you need to drag where depends on your data source and what you’re trying to 
make it show. Here’s a walk-through using the fields in the data source. If you’re using the 
sample data source, your results should look similar; if your data source is different, they’ll 
look different, but the PivotTable will work in much the same way.
 1. 
 In the Field name list box in the PivotTable Builder window, click the 
Year field and drag it to the Filters box. Excel selects the Year check 
box, enters Year in cell A2, and creates a pop-up menu for selecting 
the years in cell B2 (see Figure  17-5 ).  

497
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 2. 
 In the Field Name list box, click the Salesperson field and drag it to 
the Rows box. Excel selects the Salesperson check box and creates 
a row label for each salesperson’s name (see Figure  17-6 ). 
 Figure 17-5.   Drag the Year button from the Field name box in the PivotTable Builder window to the Filters box to 
create the Year pop-up menu shown in cell B2 here. Excel selects the (All) item in the pop-up menu at first, making the 
PivotTable show all the years 
 

498
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 3. 
 Drag the Line field from the Field name list box in the PivotTable 
Builder window to the Columns box. Excel selects the Line check 
box in the Field name list box and adds the product lines as column 
labels (see Figure  17-7 ). 
 Figure 17-6.   Moving the Salesperson button to the Rows box makes Excel create a row label from each salesperson’s name  
 

499
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 4. 
 Now click the Total Price field in the Field name list box, and drag 
it to the Values box in the PivotTable Builder window. Excel adds 
to the PivotTable the values of the items the salespeople sold (see 
Figure  17-8 ). 
 Figure 17-7.   Drag the Line item from the Field name list box in the PivotTable Builder window to the Columns box. 
Excel adds the product lines as column labels and selects the Line check box for you  
 

500
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 This gives you a PivotTable that shows how much of each product line each salesperson 
sold. At first, the PivotTable shows (All) in the Year pop-up menu in cell B2; to see a 
breakdown by a year, open the Year pop-up menu, and click the year you want. 
 This is useful—but it’s just the start of what you can do with the PivotTable.  
 Changing the PivotTable to Show Different Data 
 The great thing about PivotTables is how easy they are to change to show different data. 
You can change a PivotTable by adding different fields to it, removing fields it’s currently 
using, or rearranging the fields among the Filters box, the Columns box, the Rows box, and 
the Values box in the PivotTable Builder window. 
 Here are four examples of how you can change the basic PivotTable created earlier in this 
chapter. These examples work as a sequence so you need to make each change in turn if 
you want to work through them.
 Note   If the PivotTable Builder window is not displayed, choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ Show ➤ 
Field List from the Ribbon to display it. 
 Figure 17-8.   Drag the Total Price field from the Field name list box to the Values box in the PivotTable Builder window 
to add the totals of each salesperson’s sales to the PivotTable  
 

501
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  In the  Field name list box  , click the Product field, and drag it to the Rows 
box in the PivotTable Builder window. Excel adds a list of the product 
names of the products each salesperson has sold (see Figure  17-9 ). 
 Figure 17-9.   Drag the Product field to the Rows box in the PivotTable Builder window to add a list of the products each 
salesperson has sold. You can collapse any list by clicking the collapse button to the left of the salesperson’s name 
 

502
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Drag the Product field from the Rows box in the PivotTable Builder 
window to the  Columns box  . Then drag the Line field from the Columns 
box outside the PivotTable Builder window and drop it, making it 
disappear from the PivotTable. (You can also clear the Line check 
box in the Field name list box.) These changes produce a PivotTable 
showing the salespeople by row and what they’ve sold of the products 
in columns (see Figure  17-11 ). 
 Figure 17-10.   Drag the Salesperson field below the Product field in the Rows box in the PivotTable Builder window to 
produce a list of products showing the salespeople who have been selling them  
  In the  Rows box  in the PivotTable Builder window, drag the Salesperson 
field below the Product field. The PivotTable then shows each product 
with a collapsible list of the salespeople who have been selling it (see 
Figure  17-10 ). 
 

503
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Make the following changes to see which of your product lines each of 
your customers bought in a specific period:
  Drag the Month field from the Field name list box in the PivotTable 
Builder window to the Filters box, placing it below the Year field. 
The Month label appears in the cell below the Year label, and the 
Month pop-up menu appears in the cell below the Year pop-up 
menu. You can now filter by month as well as by field. For example, 
you can choose 2015 as the Year filter and then choose January as 
the Month filter to see only your January 2015 results.  
  In the Field name list box, clear the Salesperson check box to 
remove the Salesperson field from the Row Labels area. Then drag 
the Customer field from the Field name list box to the Rows box 
instead, making the PivotTable show one customer in each row.  
  In the Field name list box, clear the Product check box to remove 
the Product field from the Column Labels area. Then drag the Line 
field to the Columns box to make the PivotTable show the product 
lines in the columns. Figure  17-12 shows the resulting PivotTable.  
 Figure 17-11.   Removing the product lines and making column labels of the products produces this PivotTable that 
shows how much each salesperson has sold of each product  
 

504
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 When you’ve finished working with the PivotTable Builder window, you can close it by 
clicking the red Close button at the left end of its title bar. 
 If you need to open the PivotTable Builder window again, choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ 
Show ➤ Field List from the Ribbon.  
 Changing the Function Used to  Summarize  a Field 
 When you add values to a PivotTable, Excel tries to automatically use the right function 
for the calculation that type of data needs. For example, when you add a field that shows 
prices, Excel uses the  SUM() function  on the assumption that you want to add the values. 
And if you use nonnumeric data such as names, Excel uses the  COUNT() function  , giving 
you the number of different items. 
 If you need to change a field to a different function, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the field or click a cell containing data that the field produces.  
 Tip  You can also open the PivotTable Field dialog box for a field by clicking the i button to the right 
of the field’s name in the PivotTable Builder window. 
 Figure 17-12.   You can add the Month  field to the Filters box, putting it below the Year field, to filter your PivotTable by 
first the year (here, 2015) and then the month (here, January). This PivotTable shows how much customers bought from 
each product line in January 2015  
 

505
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  2.   Choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ Active Field ➤ Field Settings from the 
Ribbon to display the PivotTable Field dialog box. The main part of 
this dialog box contains two tabs, the Summarize by tab (shown on 
the left in Figure  17-13 ) and the Show data as tab (shown on the right 
in Figure  17-13 ). The Summarize by tab is selected at first.  
 Figure 17-13.   In the PivotTable Field dialog box, use the Summarize by tab (left) to change the formula used to 
summarize the field’s data. Use the Show data as tab (right) to change the way the data appears  
 3. 
 In the list box on the Summarize by tab, click the function you want 
to use. For example, click the Average function if you want the field 
to show an average instead of a sum. Excel automatically changes 
the contents of the Field Name text box to reflect the function you 
chose; for example, changing the text from Sum of Total Price to 
Average of Total Price.  
 4. 
 If you need to present the data in a different format (for example, as 
the amount of difference from a base value), click the Show data as 
tab in the PivotTable Field dialog box to display the tab’s controls 
(see the right screen in Figure  17-13 ). Click the pop-up menu, and 
then choose the format you want, such as Difference From. Then 
select the base field in the Base field list box and the base item in the 
Base item list box.  
 5. 
 If you want to change the field name, type the change in the Field 
Name text box.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the PivotTable Field dialog box.  
 

506
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Controlling the  Design of a PivotTable 
 After setting up the framework for your PivotTable, you can use the tools in the Layout group 
on the Design tab of the Ribbon to choose where to display subtotals and grand totals, 
choose among the PivotTable layouts that Excel offers, and decide whether to insert blank 
rows between items to make the PivotTable more readable. The Design tab appears on 
the Ribbon when a PivotTable is active, so if you’re not seeing the Design tab, click in your 
PivotTable. 
 The Design group contains four pop-up menus:
  Subtotals : Open this pop-up menu and then specify how to place the 
subtotals by clicking Show All Subtotals at Bottom of Group, Show All 
Subtotals at Top of Group, or Don’t Show Subtotals.  
  Grand totals : Open this pop-up menu and then specify how to place the 
grand totals by clicking On for Rows & Columns, On for Rows Only, On 
for Columns Only, or Off for Rows & Columns.  
  Report layout : Open this pop-up menu, and then first choose the layout 
form you want by clicking Show in Compact Form, Show in Outline Form, 
or Show in Tabular Form on the upper part of the menu. Figure  17-14  
shows the three layouts. Open the Report Layout pop-up menu again, 
and then click Repeat All Item Labels if you want to repeat item labels or 
click Don’t Repeat Item Labels if you don’t want to repeat them.  
  Blank rows : Open this pop-up menu and specify whether to insert blank 
rows by clicking Insert Blank Line After Each Item or Remove Blank Line 
After Each Item.  

507
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Figure 17-14.   You can choose among three layout forms for your PivotTables. Compact Form (left) is good for 
presenting data in a small space. Outline Form (right) and Tabular Form (bottom) take up more space but make the data 
easier to read 
 

508
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Formatting  a PivotTable 
 To make a PivotTable look good and convey its contents effectively, you can format it. You 
can apply the formatting at any point, but usually it’s best to lay out the framework and fields 
of the PivotTable first so that you have a fair idea of how it will appear. 
 Applying a PivotTable Style 
 As you’ve seen in the examples so far in this chapter, Excel applies a style to a PivotTable 
when you create it. The style helps you distinguish the different areas of the PivotTable visually. 
 To change the way a PivotTable looks, apply a different style to it from the PivotTable Styles 
group on the Design tab of the Ribbon. You can either click one of the styles in the Quick 
Styles box or hold the mouse pointer over the Quick Styles box, click the panel button that 
appears, and then click the PivotTable style you want to the Quick Styles panel. 
 Choosing Options for a PivotTable Style 
 After applying a PivotTable style, you can choose options for it by displaying the Design tab 
on the Ribbon and then selecting or clearing the four check boxes in the PivotTable Style 
Options group:
  Row headers : Select this check box to use the style’s formatting on the 
row headers.  
  Column headers : Select this check box to use the style’s formatting on 
the column headers.  
  Banded rows : Select this check box to make lines or shaded bands 
(depending on the style) appear along the rows.  
  Banded columns : Select this check box to make lines or shaded bands 
(depending on the style) appear up and down the columns.  
 Note   You can also create your own PivotTable styles. To do so, choose Design ➤ PivotTable Styles 
➤ Quick Styles ➤ New PivotTable Style from the Ribbon, and then work in the New PivotTable 
Quick Style dialog box that Excel displays. Briefly, you type the name for the new style in the Name 
text box, then click an element in the Table element list box, click the Format button, and choose the 
formatting you want for the element. After you create a new style, you can apply it from the Custom 
section at the top of the Quick Styles panel. 

509
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Naming a PivotTable and Setting Options for It 
 When you insert a PivotTable, Excel gives it a default name (such as PivotTable1 or 
PivotTable2) and sets default display options, layout options, and data options. The 
PivotTable’s name appears in the  PivotTable Name box  in the PivotTable group at the left 
end of the PivotTable Analyze tab of the Ribbon when the Excel window is moderately wide; 
when the window is narrower, Excel collapses the PivotTable group into a PivotTable button 
that you can click to display the group’s contents on a pop-up panel. 
 To rename the PivotTable, go to the  PivotTable group  if the Excel window is wide enough, or 
click the PivotTable button if the window is not. Type the new name in the PivotTable Name 
text box, and then press Return. PivotTable names can include spaces, so you can make 
them descriptive and readable. 
 For an alternative way to rename the PivotTable, or to choose different options, choose 
PivotTable Analyze ➤ PivotTable ➤ Options from the Ribbon to display the PivotTable 
Options dialog box, and then work with its controls. 
 Note   When you create a PivotTable on its own worksheet, you should rename the worksheet from its 
default name (for example, Sheet5) to a descriptive name (for example, Sales PivotTable). Double-click 
the current name on the worksheet tab, type the new name, and then press Return to apply it. 

510
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Figure 17-15.   On the Display tab of the PivotTable Options dialog box, choose whether to show items such as 
expand/collapse triangles and ScreenTips on the PivotTable and whether to print headings and row labels 
 Choosing  Display Options  for a PivotTable 
 To control how Excel displays a PivotTable, click the Display tab in the PivotTable Options 
dialog box to display its controls (shown in Figure  17-15 ), and then choose the options 
you want. 
 These are the options you can choose in the Show area:
  Expand/collapse buttons : Select this check box if you want to display 
the expand/collapse buttons you click to expand or collapse row labels 
or column labels. Usually it’s useful to display these expand/collapse 
buttons, but you can clear this check box if you want to hide them to 
prevent others from changing the display of a PivotTable.  
  Print expand/collapse buttons : Select this check box if you want to print 
the expand/collapse buttons on printouts of the PivotTables. Printing 
the expand/collapse buttons is often useful for PivotTables you print for 
your own consumption, but you may prefer not to print the buttons on 
printouts you produce for other people.  
 Figure  17-15 shows the  PivotTable Options dialog box  with its Display tab at the front.  
 

511
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Field captions and filters : Select this check box if you want captions to 
appear at the top of the PivotTable and filter pop-up buttons on column 
labels and row labels. These are usually helpful.  
  Classic PivotTable layout : Select this check box if you want to use the 
“classic” (in other words, older) style of PivotTable layout, which displays 
row labels separately from their totals. The classic layout takes up a little 
more space, but many people find it easier to read.  
  Error values as : If you want to display standard text in cells that contain 
errors rather than displaying error messages, select this check box and 
type the text in the text box.  
  Empty cells as : If you want to display standard text in empty cells 
instead of having them simply be empty, select this check box and type 
the text in the text box.  
 The “Show items with no data” area contains two settings that are available only for 
PivotTables that use an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) data source:
  On rows : Select this check box to display row items that have no values.  
  On columns : Select this check box to display column items that have 
no values.  
 The Print area contains three options for controlling which items print along with the 
PivotTable:
  Repeat row labels on each page : Select this check box to make Excel 
print the row labels on each page the PivotTable occupies rather than 
just on the first page. Repeating the row labels makes the PivotTable 
easier to read so it’s usually a good idea.  
  Page, row, and column headings : Select this check box to repeat 
the page headings, row headings, and column headings. This too is 
usually helpful.  
  Item labels when no fields are on the table : This check box is normally 
selected but dimmed and unavailable because it applies only to 
PivotTables created in Excel 2004 (Mac), Excel 2003 (Windows), or 
earlier versions of Excel. If the check box is available, selecting it 
makes the PivotTable display item labels even when the Value Area 
contains no fields.  
 Note   Tooltips are the little pop-up messages that appear when you hold the pointer over an item. 
Many people still refer to tooltips as ScreenTips, which is the name that Microsoft used to use for them. 
  Contextual tooltips : Select this check box if you want the PivotTable 
to display tooltips for fields and for values when you hold the mouse 
pointer over a cell. This option is usually helpful.  

512
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Choosing  Layout Options  for a PivotTable 
 To control the layout of a PivotTable, click the Layout tab in the PivotTable Options dialog 
box to display its controls (see Figure  17-16 ) and then choose the settings you want.  
 Figure 17-16.   On the Layout tab of the PivotTable Options dialog box, you can set options for the layout, for the report 
filter, and for sorting 
 These are the settings you can choose in the Layout area of the Layout tab:
  Allow multiple filters per field : Select this check box if you want to be 
able to filter the PivotTable by two or more filters on a single field rather 
than by just one filter.  
  AutoFit column widths on update : Select this check box to make Excel 
automatically resize the column widths to accommodate the data with 
which you’ve refreshed the PivotTable. AutoFit is usually helpful.  
  Preserve cell formatting on update : Select this check box to make Excel 
retain cell formatting you’ve applied directly to cells when you update 
the information in the PivotTable. This option too is usually helpful.  
 

513
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Merge and center cells with labels : Select this check box if you want 
Excel to merge a label cell with a blank cell next to it and center the 
label across the cells. Try this look to see whether you prefer it to the 
regular look.  
  Indent row labels when in compact form : In this pop-up menu, choose 
the number of spaces by which you want to indent row labels when 
using the Compact Layout for a PivotTable.  
 These are the settings you can choose in the Report filter area of the Layout tab:
  Arrange fields option buttons : Select the “Down, then over” option 
button to have Excel arrange the fields downward first and then across 
to the right. Select the “Over, then down” option button if you prefer to 
arrange the fields first to the right and then downward.  
  Filter fields per column : In this pop-up menu, choose the number of fields 
to display in the report filter before moving to another column or row.  
 These are the settings you can choose in the Sort area of the Layout tab:
  Use custom lists when sorting : Select this check box if you want Excel 
to sort by your custom AutoFill lists when it encounters the data in them. 
For example, if you’ve created a custom list of your company’s offices, 
select this check box to make Excel sort the PivotTable by the order in 
that list rather than in ascending order or another standard sort order.  
  Sort A to Z : Select this option button if you want to sort in ascending 
order. The alternative is the “Sort by data source order” option button.  
  Sort by data source order : Select this option button if you want to sort 
the PivotTable in the same order as the data source. This is the default 
setting and is useful if you’ve laid out the data source in your preferred 
order. If not, select the Sort A to Z option button instead.  
 Choosing Data Options for a PivotTable 
 The  Data tab  of the PivotTable Options dialog box (see Figure  17-17 ) lets you control how 
Excel stores the PivotTable’s data from an external connection and whether Excel refreshes 
the data automatically. For a PivotTable connected to an external data source, you can also 
choose whether to save the connection password with the Excel workbook and whether to 
run queries in the background.  

514
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 In the Data area of the Data tab, you can choose the following options:
  Save source data with file : Select this check box if you want to store the 
source data from an external data source in the workbook that contains 
the PivotTable. This setting has no effect on a PivotTable that contains 
data drawn from its own workbook because that workbook contains the 
data already.  
  Enable show details : Select this check box if you want to be able to drill 
down in the PivotTable to show details from the data source.  
  Retain items deleted from the data source : Select this check box if you 
want Excel to store data that has been deleted from the data source. 
Storing the data is useful if you are working with older data in a data 
source that’s being updated.  
 Figure 17-17.   On the Data tab of the PivotTable Options dialog box, choose how to handle the PivotTable’s data 
and connection 
 

515
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
  Number to retain per field : These controls are available if you selected 
the “Retain items deleted from the data source” check box. Select the 
Automatic option button to have Excel store the default number of items 
for each field of data. Select the Max option button to store as many 
items as possible for each field of data.  
  Refresh data when opening file : Select this check box if you want Excel 
to automatically refresh the data in the PivotTable when you open the 
workbook. Automatic refreshing is useful when you need to make sure 
you’re working with the latest figures.  
 In the Connection area, you can choose these two options for a PivotTable that connects to 
external data:
  Save password with file : Select this check box to save the connection’s 
password in the workbook. Saving the password means you don’t 
need to enter it manually on each refresh so you should do this, unless 
security dictates otherwise.  
  Run queries in the background : Select this check box to run queries in 
the background rather than in the foreground. Running queries in the 
background typically makes the queries take longer but allows Excel to 
remain more responsive while a query is running.  
 When you’ve finished choosing options in the PivotTable Options dialog box, click the OK 
button to close the dialog box.  
 Refreshing the Data in a PivotTable 
 Even when you create a PivotTable from a data source in the same workbook, the data in 
a PivotTable remains static rather than updating automatically the way most other Excel 
objects do. When you want to make sure your PivotTable contains the latest data from 
the data source, choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ Data ➤ Refresh from the Ribbon, clicking 
the main part of the Refresh button. To refresh all the PivotTables in a workbook, choose 
PivotTable Analyze ➤ Data ➤ Refresh ➤ Refresh All from the Ribbon. 
 If your PivotTable uses an external data source, and you find the  refresh operation  is taking too 
long, choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ Data ➤ Refresh ➤ Cancel Refresh to cancel the operation.  

516

 To make a PivotTable show the data you require, you may need to sort it or filter it. 
 To sort a PivotTable, click the pop-up button on the field by which you want to sort. Excel 
displays the sorting and filtering window for that field. The window bears the field’s name, as 
you can see in Figure  17-19 , which shows the sorting and filtering window for the Product 
field. You can then click the Ascending button to produce an ascending sort (from A to Z, 
from small numbers to large numbers, and from early dates and times to later ones) or the 
Descending button to produce a descending sort (the opposite).  
 Changing the  Source of a PivotTable 
 Sometimes, after building a PivotTable, you may find you need to change its source data. 
You can do this without deleting the PivotTable and starting again, which is good news. 
 To change the source data of a PivotTable, follow these steps:
 1. 
 From the Ribbon, choose PivotTable Analyze ➤ Data ➤ Change Data 
Source to display the Change PivotTable Data Source dialog box 
(see Figure  17-18 ). 
 

517
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 When you apply sorting to a field, the field name pop-up button changes to show an 
arrow indicating the direction of the sort. For example, in Figure  17-20 , you can see an 
upward arrow indicating a descending sort on the Salesperson field and a downward arrow 
indicating an ascending sort on the Product field and the Line field. The Month field shows 
the regular pop-up button.  
 Note  To control how Excel sorts a PivotTable, choose sorting options in the Sort area of the Layout 
tab of the PivotTable Options dialog box, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 
 Figure 17-19.   To sort or filter a PivotTable, open the sorting and filtering window for the field, and then choose options 
in the Sort area or the Filter area. The sorting and filtering window’s title bar shows the field’s name (here, Product) 
 

518
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 To filter the PivotTable, click the pop-up button next to the field’s name to display the sorting 
and filtering window, and then choose the filtering criteria in the Filter area. Here are some 
examples:
  Filter by label : To filter by label, open the By label pop-up menu, choose 
the comparison type, and then specify the data required. For example, 
choose the Contains comparison to find labels that match the text string 
you type in the text box that appears, as shown on the left in Figure  17-21 .  
 Figure 17-20.   When you sort a PivotTable, the field’s pop-up button shows an upward arrow for a descending sort 
(as on the Salesperson field here) or a downward arrow for an ascending sort (as on the Product field and the Line 
field here) 
 

519
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 Figure 17-21.   You can filter a field by its label (as shown on the left here) or by its value (as shown on the right). You 
can also search in the Search box or clear the check boxes of items you want to exclude 
  Filter by value : To filter by value, open the By value pop-up menu, and 
choose the comparison you want. For example, choose the Top 10 
item to create a top-however-many-you-choose filter, and then set the 
number of items in the left of the two pop-up menus that appears below 
the By value pop-up menu when it’s showing Top 10 (see the right 
screen in Figure  17-21 ). In the right of the two pop-up menus, choose 
Item, Percentage, or Sum as needed for the filtering.  
  Filter by individual values : To filter by individual values, clear the (Select 
All) check box in the lower part of the Filter area, and then select 
the check box for each item you want to use in the filter. To find only 
particular items so that you can select or clear their check boxes, click 
in the Search box, and type the search term.  
 When you apply a filter, the field’s pop-up button displays a funnel-like filter symbol, as you 
can see on the Price field in Figure  17-22 . 
 

520
CHAPTER 17: Manipulating Data with PivotTables
 To remove filtering, open the sorting and filtering window again, and then click the Clear 
Filter button at the bottom.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned what PivotTables are and how to create them from your existing 
tables or other data sources. You know how to start a PivotTable automatically or build it 
manually, how to rearrange its fields to change the information it displays and the way it 
displays the information, and how to design and format the PivotTable. Lastly, you learned 
how to sort and filter PivotTables to make them show the information you need. 
 This is the end of the book’s coverage of Excel. In the next part of the book, I’ll show you 
how to make the most of PowerPoint.

 Part 4 
 Creating Presentations with 
Microsoft PowerPoint 
 In this part of the book, you’ll learn how to create compelling presentations using Microsoft 
PowerPoint and either present them live to an audience or deliver them across the Internet. 
 In Chapter   18  , you’ll create a presentation document using either a design template or a 
content template. You’ll then learn how to add, delete, and rearrange slides; how to use 
PowerPoint’s views effectively; how to develop the outline of a presentation; and how to 
break a presentation into separate sections. You’ll also gain the skill of collaborating with 
your colleagues on creating a presentation. 
 In Chapter   19  , you’ll learn how to create slides that convey your meaning clearly and 
powerfully. You’ll plan your presentation, choose suitable slide layouts (or create a custom 
layout), and add text and other content to your slides. 
 In Chapter   20  , you’ll bring your presentation to life by adding graphics, movies, sounds, 
animations, and transitions. You’ll learn how to hide slides to keep them up your sleeve and 
how to build custom slide shows that enable you to show only part of a larger presentation. 
 In Chapter   21  , you’ll master how to deliver the presentation you’ve created. You can deliver 
the presentation live in person or create a version of the presentation that you can share via 
e-mail or in other ways. You’ll also learn how to use PowerPoint’s Presenter view and how to 
create a handout for a presentation.

 Chapter 18  
 Starting to Build a 
Presentation in PowerPoint 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn how to start building a presentation in PowerPoint. 
 Your first move is to create the presentation document. PowerPoint gives you a wide range 
of choices, from colorful design themes to sample templates with content that can give your 
presentation a kick start. You can change the look, colors, or fonts if you don’t like what you 
have, and you can also customize the slide size and orientation if necessary. 
 Once you’ve created the presentation, you add slides to it or customize the sample slides 
that it contains. A PowerPoint presentation consists of a series of slides that you normally 
play from start to finish. Each slide can contain any of a wide variety of different types of 
content, from text titles and bullet points through charts, diagrams, and even movies. You’ll 
look at how to add straightforward content in this chapter and how to add more entertaining 
content types in the next two chapters. 
 After making sure you know how to add, delete, and rearrange slides, I’ll show you how to 
use PowerPoint’s views to work efficiently on a presentation, how to develop the outline of a 
presentation quickly, and how to organize a presentation’s slides into different sections for 
convenience. Last, I’ll show you how to collaborate with your colleagues on creating a 
presentation in PowerPoint. 
 Note   To follow the Ribbon commands easily, please display the group titles on the Ribbon. To do 
so, choose PowerPoint ➤ Preferences from the menu bar. In the PowerPoint Preferences window, 
click View to display the View pane. In the Ribbon area, select the Show group titles check box, and 
then close the PowerPoint Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at the 
left end of the window’s title bar). 

524
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Creating a Presentation 
 To  create  a new presentation, you use the New tab of the Microsoft PowerPoint Gallery 
dialog box (see Figure  18-1 ). PowerPoint opens this dialog box automatically when you 
launch the app (unless you’ve set PowerPoint not to do this), but you can also open it at any 
time by choosing File ➤ New from Template from the menu bar or pressing Cmd+Shift+P.  
 
 Note   A presentation template includes sample content that you can use as the basis of your 
presentation. A presentation theme is a coordinated look for the slides in a presentation but does 
not contain sample content. 
 Note   If you need to base a new presentation on an existing presentation, click the Recent tab or 
the Open tab of the Microsoft PowerPoint Gallery dialog box. Select the presentation and click the 
Open button, and then use the File ➤ Save As command to save a copy of the presentation under a 
different name, in a different folder, or both. 
 Figure 18-1.   From the Microsoft PowerPoint Gallery dialog box, you can create a blank presentation or a presentation 
based on a presentation design. You can also search for templates on your Mac or online 
 

525
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Changing a Presentation’s Theme, Fonts, or Colors 
 You can change the look of the presentation by applying a different theme to it. A  theme is 
an overall look for a presentation, including a slide background design, a set of colors, and a 
set of fonts. 
 To change the theme, click the Design tab of the Ribbon, and then use the controls in the 
 Themes group. Click one of the themes displayed in the Themes box or hold the pointer over 
the Themes box to display the panel button, click the panel button, and then click the theme 
on the Themes panel (see Figure  18-2 ).  
 When you’ve applied the theme you want, choose Design ➤ Variants ➤ Variants from 
the Ribbon to display the Variants panel (see Figure  18-3 ). From here, you can make any 
changes needed to the theme: 
 Figure 18-2.   Use the Themes panel in the Themes group on the Design tab of the Ribbon to quickly change your 
presentation’s theme 
 

526
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Change the colors : Choose Design ➤ Variants ➤ Variants ➤ Colors 
from the Ribbon, and then click the color set you want to use. You can 
click Customize Colors at the bottom of the Colors panel to display the 
Create Theme Colors dialog box (see Figure  18-4 ). Change the colors as 
needed, type a descriptive name for the custom color set, and then click 
the Save button to save it.  
 Figure 18-3.   Use the  Variants panel in the Variants group on the Design tab of the Ribbon to alter your chosen theme to 
suit the presentation’s needs 
 

527
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Change the  fonts : Choose Design ➤ Variants ➤ Variants ➤ Fonts from 
the Ribbon, and then click the fonts set you want.  
  Change the background  style : Choose Design ➤ Variants ➤ Variants ➤ 
Background from the Ribbon, and then click the appropriate 
background. To apply custom background formatting, click Format 
Background at the bottom of the Background panel, use the controls in 
the Format Background pane to specify the background, and then click 
the Apply to All button.  
 Note  After customizing a theme, you can save it for future use. From the Ribbon, choose Design 
➤ Themes ➤ Themes (clicking the panel button to open the Themes panel) and then click Save 
Current Theme. Type a name in the Export As box in the dialog box that opens, and then click the 
Save button. You can then reuse the theme from the Custom section of the Themes panel. 
 Figure 18-4.   Use the  Create Theme Colors dialog box to change the colors within the theme or theme variant you’ve chosen 
 

528
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Changing the  Slide Size or  Orientation  
 For some  presentations, you may also need to change the size or orientation of the slides. 
Most PowerPoint templates start you off with slides sized for displaying on a regular-format 
screen in a landscape (wider than high) orientation, which is what you’ll most often need. But 
if you need to create wide-screen slides, slides sized for printing on paper, or slides in a 
portrait orientation, you need to change the setup. 
 If you just need to change the slides from the standard format to the widescreen format, or 
vice versa, choose Design ➤ Customize ➤ Slide Size ➤ Widescreen or Design ➤ Customize 
➤ Slide Size ➤ Standard from the Ribbon. 
 To make other changes to the size or orientation, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Design ➤ Customize ➤ Slide Size ➤ Page Setup from the 
Ribbon or File ➤ Page Setup from the menu bar to display the Page 
Setup dialog box (see Figure  18-5 ). 
 Note  Standard slides use a 4:3 aspect ratio: they are four units wide by three units tall. 
Widescreen slides use a 16:9 aspect ratio: they are 16 units wide by nine units tall. 
 Note   If you change from Widescreen to Standard after adding content to slides, PowerPoint 
displays a dialog box pointing out that you are converting to a smaller slide size and asking if you 
want to scale content down. Click the Scale button if you do want to reduce the content size; click 
the Don’t Scale button if you don’t. If the slides have no content, this dialog box doesn’t appear. 

529
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 2. 
 Open the Slides sized for pop-up menu, and choose the size you 
need. Here are some examples:
  Choose On-screen Show (4:3) to create slides sized for a standard-
dimensions screen (a 4:3 aspect ratio).  
  Choose On-screen Show (16:9) to create slides sized for a screen 
with a 16:9 aspect ratio, or choose On-screen Show (16:10) to use a 
16:10 aspect ratio.  
  Choose Letter Paper (8.5x11 in) to create slides sized for printing on 
letter paper.  
 3. 
 If necessary, change the slide size in the Width box and the Height 
box. When you do this, PowerPoint changes the selection in the 
“Slide sized for” pop-up menu to Custom.  
 4. 
 Choose the slide orientation by clicking the Portrait button or the 
Landscape button in the Slides section of the Orientation area.  
 5. 
 Choose the orientation for notes, handouts, and outlines by clicking 
the Portrait button or the Landscape button in the Notes, handouts, 
& outlines section of the Orientation area.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Page Setup dialog box. PowerPoint 
applies your choices to the presentation.  
 Figure 18-5.   Use the Page Setup dialog box to change slide size or orientation. You can also switch the notes, 
handouts, and outlines from portrait orientation to landscape  
 

530
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Navigating the PowerPoint Window 
 When you first open a presentation, PowerPoint usually displays it in Normal view. In this 
view, the PowerPoint window contains three panes, as you can see in Figure  18-6 .
  Slide pane : This pane shows the current slide. Click the Fit Slide to 
Current Window button at the right end of the status bar to zoom the 
slide as large as it will go and still fit in the pane. Use the other zoom 
controls as usual to zoom to different degrees.  
  Navigation pane : This pane appears on the left and enables you to 
navigate quickly from one slide to another, give commands, and 
rearrange your slides. In Normal view, the Navigation pane shows a 
thumbnail picture of each slide that you can click to display the slide in 
the Slide pane. In Outline view (which you can display by choosing View 
➤ Outline View from the menu bar), the Navigation pane displays an 
outline of the presentation that you can use to quickly develop the 
presentation’s text content. In Outline view too, you click a slide to 
display it in the Slide pane.  
 Figure 18-6.   In Normal view, the  Navigation pane appears on the left and the  Notes pane appears at the bottom of the 
window, leaving the  Slide pane taking up most of the space 
 

531
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Notes pane : This pane appears at the bottom of the window, below the 
Slide pane. This is where you create notes that you want to accompany 
the slide. These may be notes that you want to view on-screen as you 
give the presentation to remind you of what to say, notes you plan to 
print out for yourself or whoever delivers the presentation, or notes that 
you turn into a handout for the audience.  
 Add Content to a Slide 
 Once you’ve created a slide, you can  add content  to it. As you’ll see in Chapters   19   and   20 , 
PowerPoint slides can contain a wide variety of types of content, from text to audio and movies. 
 Most slides come with one or more placeholders for adding content. For example, the slide 
shown in Figure  18-6 has a title placeholder (the upper box that says “Click to add title”) and 
a standard content placeholder for adding text, graphics, tables, or other content. Other 
slides contain placeholders for other types of content, such as subtitles. 
 To add text to a text placeholder, click anywhere in the placeholder. PowerPoint hides the 
“Click to add text” prompt and displays an insertion point. Type the text you want, and then 
click outside the placeholder to deselect it. 
 To resize a placeholder, click to select it. You can then
  Drag a corner handle to resize the placeholder in two dimensions freely.  
  Drag a side handle to resize the placeholder in only one dimension.  
  Shift-drag a corner handle to resize the placeholder in two dimensions 
but retain its aspect ratio.  
 Tip  If you want more room to work on your slide, close the Navigation pane by dragging its right 
border all the way to the left side of the window. To display the Navigation pane again, drag the 
border back to the right. Similarly, you can hide the Notes pane by dragging its border down to the 
bottom of the window and reveal it again by dragging the border back up. 
 Note   Most themes and templates start you off with one or more slides. If your presentation 
doesn’t have a slide at this point, choose Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide from the Ribbon or press 
Cmd+Shift+N to insert a slide. See the next section for more details on adding slides. 
 Note   You can resize the Slide pane, Navigation pane, and Notes pane by dragging the borders that 
separate them. For example, you may want to widen the Navigation pane to make the thumbnail 
pictures larger so that you can identify the slides more easily. 

532
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Option-drag a corner handle or side handle to resize the placeholder 
symmetrically about its center point.  
  Option-Shift-drag a corner handle to resize the placeholder 
symmetrically in two dimensions about its center point, retaining its 
aspect ratio.  
 To move a placeholder, first select it by clicking it. Move the pointer over a border so that the 
pointer changes to a four-headed arrow. Then drag the placeholder to where you want it to 
appear.  
 Adding, Deleting, and Rearranging Slides 
 If you based your presentation on a theme, you may need to add more slides to it now. If 
you based the presentation on a sample template or a guided method, you may have the 
opposite problem—the presentation contains too many slides, and you need to delete some 
of them. Either way, sooner or later, you will likely need to change the order in which the 
slides appear in the presentation. 
 Adding  a Slide 
 To add a new slide, select the slide after which you want to insert the new one. Choose 
Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide from the Ribbon (clicking the drop-down button on the New 
Slide button), and then click the slide layout on the New Slide panel (see Figure  18-7 ). 
 Note  To reset a slide’s placeholders to their defaults, click the slide, and then choose Home ➤ 
Slides ➤ Reset from the Ribbon. To change the layout of a slide, click the slide, choose Home ➤ 
Slides ➤ Layout from the Ribbon, and then click the layout you want on the Layout panel. 

533
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 You can also insert slides in a presentation in three other ways:
  Duplicate slides from the presentation : To create new slides based on 
ones already in your presentation, select those slides, and then choose 
Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Duplicate Slide from the Ribbon or 
Insert ➤ Duplicate Slide from the menu bar.  
  Copy slides from another presentation : You can insert all the slides from 
another presentation; if you need only some of the slides, you can delete 
those you don’t want. Follow these steps:
  Select the slide after which you want to insert the copied slides.  
 Tip   You can quickly duplicate a slide by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking it in the Navigation pane or 
in Slide Sorter view and then clicking Duplicate Slide on the context menu. (You’ll meet Slide Sorter 
view later in this chapter.) Alternatively, select the slide, and then press Cmd+Shift+D. To duplicate 
multiple slides, select them before giving the command. 
 Figure 18-7.   Insert a slide by opening the New Slide panel on the Home tab of the Ribbon and clicking the slide layout 
you want  
 

534
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Choose Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Reuse Slides or Insert ➤ 
Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Reuse Slides from the Ribbon (clicking the 
pop-up button on the New Slide button in either case and then 
clicking Reuse Slides on the New Slide panel) or Insert ➤ Slides 
From ➤ Other Presentation from the menu bar to open the Choose 
a File dialog box.  
  Navigate to and click the presentation that contains the slides you 
want to insert.  
  Click the OK button. PowerPoint inserts all the slides.  
  Insert slides from an outline in a document : If you’ve created an outline 
in a  rich text format (RTF)  document or a text document, you can create 
slides based on it. Choose Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Outline or 
Insert ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Outline from the Ribbon (clicking the 
pop-up button on the New Slide button in either case and then clicking 
Outline on the New Slide panel) or Insert ➤ Slides From ➤ Outline from 
the menu bar to open the Choose a File dialog box, click the document 
that contains the outline, and then click the Insert button. PowerPoint 
tries to break up the content to fit the slides by using the heading styles 
and formatting so you may need to adjust the resulting slides.  
 Deleting a Slide 
 You can  delete  a slide in the Navigation pane in Normal view or Outline view or in the main 
pane in Slide Sorter view. (You’ll learn about Slide Sorter view in a moment.) Use any of 
these techniques:
  Context menu : Ctrl-click or right-click the slide, and then click Delete 
Slide on the context menu.  
  Delete key : Click the slide, and then press the Delete key on the 
keyboard.  
  Menu bar : Click the slide, and then choose Edit ➤ Delete Slide.  
 Note  In PowerPoint 2016, Microsoft has severely reduced the functionality of the feature for 
inserting slides from another presentation. Whereas PowerPoint 2011 let you choose whether to 
insert all slides or only those that you selected (using the Slide Finder dialog box), and also let 
you choose whether to keep the design of the original slides instead of applying the design of the 
new presentation, PowerPoint 2016 only lets you insert all the slides—and the slides pick up the 
design of the presentation into which you insert them. If you frequently need to reuse slides in 
your presentations, consider creating separate presentations that contain groups of the slides you 
need—or even presentations containing individual slides if you need greater flexibility. 

535
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Rearranging  Slides 
 You can change the order of the slides in the presentation in Normal view, Outline view, or 
Slide Sorter view:
  Normal view or Outline view : In the Navigation pane, click the slide you 
want to move, and then drag it up or down. When the line for the slide 
appears where you want it, release the button.  
  Slide Sorter view : Select the slide or slides, and then drag them to the 
appropriate position. When the slide or slides are where you want them, 
release the button.  
 Using Views to Work on Your Presentation 
 So far in this chapter, you’ve seen only the  Normal view  , though I’ve also mentioned Slide Sorter 
view and Outline view. Altogether, PowerPoint provides five different views to help you work 
swiftly and easily on your presentations: Normal view, Outline view, Slide Sorter view, Notes 
Page view, and Slide Show view. PowerPoint also provides  Presenter view  , which you use when 
running a slide show on two screens (one screen for you, the other for your audience). 
 You can switch views in any of these ways:
  Status bar : Click the appropriate view button in the View Shortcuts 
group (see Figure  18-8 ). This group doesn’t contain a button for Outline 
view or Notes Page view.  
  Ribbon : Choose View ➤ Presentation Views ➤ Normal, View ➤ 
Presentation Views ➤ Outline View, View ➤ Presentation Views ➤ Slide 
Sorter, or View ➤ Presentation Views ➤ Notes Page.  
 Note   PowerPoint classes Normal view, Outline view, Slide Sorter view, and Notes Page view as 
“presentation views” and Slide Show view as something else, but I include Slide Show view here 
because you’ll likely use it while developing a presentation and checking how it looks when running. 
 Figure 18-8.   Click a view button in the View Shortcuts group on the status bar to change views quickly 
 

536
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Normal, View ➤ Slide Sorter, View ➤ Notes 
Page, View ➤ Outline, or View ➤ Slide Show.  
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+1 to switch to Normal view, Cmd+2 to switch 
to Slide Sorter view, Cmd+3 to switch to Notes Page view, Cmd+4 to 
switch to Outline view, or Cmd+Shift+Return to switch to Slide Show 
view (and start the slide show). You can exit from Slide Show view by 
pressing the Esc key.  
 Creating Your Slides in  Normal View  
 As you’ve seen already, Normal view is the view you use to create your slides and work on their 
content. Normal view is the view in which PowerPoint usually opens a presentation, and you can 
give yourself more space to work on a slide by hiding the Navigation pane and the Notes area.  
 Developing Your Presentation’s Outline in Outline View 
 Use  Outline view  when you need to develop the outline of a presentation quickly. Outline 
view (see Figure  18-9 ) is similar to Normal view, in that the Navigation pane appears at the 
left side of the window, the Slide pane appears in the main part of the window, and the 
Notes pane appears at the bottom of the window (unless you drag its border down to hide 
it). The difference is that in Outline view the Navigation pane displays the outline, which 
shows the presentation as a sequence of collapsible slides. Each slide appears as a heading 
with its ordinal number and the text from the title placeholder (if there is any).  
 Figure 18-9.   Use Outline view to develop the outline of a presentation 
 

537
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 You can expand or collapse a slide by double-clicking its icon in the Outline tab. A collapsed 
slide shows an underline to indicate that material is hidden, as in slides 1, 5, and 6 in Figure  18-9 . 
 Use these techniques for working in Outline view:
  Create a new slide : Press Return at the end of a paragraph to start a 
new paragraph, and then press Shift+Tab one or more times (as needed) 
to promote the paragraph to a slide title.  
  Create a bulleted paragraph : After typing a slide title, press Return to 
start a new paragraph. Then press Tab to demote the paragraph to 
the first level. You can demote a paragraph to a lower level if needed 
(for example, to create second-level bulleted paragraphs). The slide in 
Figure  18-9 shows several second-level bulleted paragraphs.  
  Move a paragraph or selection up or down : Click at the left end of a 
paragraph to select it, or click and drag to select multiple paragraphs. 
You can then drag the paragraph or selection up or down the outline 
to where you want it to be. For example, you can drag a bulleted 
paragraph from one slide to another.  
  Paste in text : You can paste text into the Outline tab, and then promote 
or demote its paragraphs to the levels at which you want them to appear.  
 Rearranging Your Slides in  Slide Sorter View  
 When you need to rearrange your slides into a different order, use  Slide Sorter view  (see 
Figure  18-10 ). This view shows a thumbnail picture of each slide laid out in a grid pattern so 
you can quickly see where each slide appears in relation to the other slides.  

538
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Slide Sorter view is most useful for these three purposes:
  Checking the order of slides : In Slide Sorter view, you can easily see the 
order your slides are in and change the order if it’s wrong. To move one 
or more selected slides, drag them to where you want them to appear. 
PowerPoint moves the other slides out of the way so you can tell where 
the slides will land when you drop them.  
  Getting an overview of your presentation : The Navigation pane is good 
for viewing your presentation as a sequence, but often it’s helpful to be 
able to view all the slides at once.  
  Finding the slide you need to edit : Once you’ve located the slide, 
double-click it to open the slide in Normal view or Outline view 
(whichever you were using before) so that you can edit it.  
 Figure 18-10.   In Slide Sorter view, you can quickly drag a slide or a group of slides to a different place in the 
presentation, as in the middle of the window here. Drag the zoom slider to change the size at which the slide 
thumbnails appear 
 Note   To select a slide in Slide Sorter view, click it. To select a range of slides, click the first slide, 
and then Shift-click the last slide; alternatively, click before the first slide, and drag over the slides 
you want. To select slides that aren’t next to each other, click the first slide, and then Cmd-click 
each of the others.

 Creating Notes Pages in Notes Page View 
 When you need to add notes to a slide, switch to  Notes Page view  by choosing View ➤ 
Notes Page or pressing Cmd+3. In Notes Page view (see Figure  18-11 ), you can type the 
notes you need for each slide.  
 The kind of notes you’ll create depends on the presentation and how you’ll deliver it, but 
here are three typical kinds of notes:
  Notes for viewing on-screen : If you will use PowerPoint’s Presenter view 
(which you’ll learn to use in Chapter   21  ) when giving the presentation, 
you can view notes on your screen without the audience seeing them.  
  Notes to print out for the speaker : If you (or someone else) will need 
printed notes to deliver the presentation, you can enter the appropriate 
information in Notes Page view.  
  Notes to include in handouts for the audience : If you plan to create a 
handout for the audience, enter any notes you want to include.  
 Figure 18-11.   Switch to Notes Page view when you need to create notes for your slides

 Running a Presentation in Slide Show View 
 Slide Show view is the view you use when running a presentation.  Slide Show view  displays 
the current slide full screen on the screen you’re using for the presentation. If you have a 
secondary screen (for example, because you’ve connected your Mac to a projector), you can 
choose to show your presenter notes on it to help you with the presentation. 
 You’ll see Slide Show view in action in Chapter   21 , which covers running slide shows. 
Chapter   21  also explains how to use Presenter view, which you use to display your notes 
and upcoming slides on one screen while running a presentation on another screen.  
 Opening Extra  Windows  to See Different Parts of the 
Presentation 
 Often, it’s useful to be able to see two or more different slides at once so that you can compare 
them or ensure the ideas flow smoothly from one to the other. The easiest way to do this is to 
open a new window on the presentation and then display the other slide in that window. 
 To open a new window, choose Window ➤ New Window from the menu bar. You can then 
position each window wherever you find most helpful and display different slides—or use 
different views—in the windows.  
 Organizing Your Slides into Sections 
 When you add many slides to a presentation, it can become difficult to navigate through 
the presentation. To simplify matters, you can divide the presentation up into two or more 
sections. Each  section  can contain however many slides you need it to, and you can expand 
or collapse sections as needed. 
 To add a section, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Switch to Normal view if you’re using any other view. For example, click 
the Normal view button in the View Shortcuts area of the status bar.  
 2. 
 Display the Navigation pane if it’s not already displayed.  
 3. 
 Click the slide at which you want to start the section.  
 4. 
 Choose Home ➤ Slides ➤ Section ➤ Add Section from the Ribbon 
or Insert ➤ Section from the menu bar. PowerPoint creates a new 
section, names it Untitled Section on the section bar across the top, 
and displays the Rename Section dialog box (see Figure  18-12 ). 

541
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 5. 
 Type the section name, and then press Return or click the Rename 
button to close the dialog box and apply the new name.  
 Once you’ve created your sections, you can manipulate them easily like this:
  Expand or collapse a section : Click its disclosure triangle.  
  Expand or collapse all sections : Ctrl-click or right-click a section 
heading, and then click Expand All or Collapse All on the context menu.  
  Move a section up or down the list of sections : Either click the section 
heading and drag it to where you want the section, or Ctrl-click or right-
click the section heading, and then click Move Section Up or Move 
Section Down on the context menu (see Figure  18-13 ).  
 Note  If the first section you create begins after the first slide, PowerPoint puts the slides before 
the section into another section named Default Section. Double-click the Default Section heading to 
display the Rename Section dialog box, type a new name for the section, and then press Return or 
click the Rename button. 
 Figure 18-12.   PowerPoint creates the section, names it Untitled Section, and displays the Rename Section dialog box 
so that you can rename it. The number in parentheses after each section name shows how many slides the section 
contains 
 

542
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Remove a section but leave its slides : Ctrl-click or right-click the section 
heading, and then click Remove Section on the context menu. To 
remove all sections, click Remove All Sections.  
  Remove a section and its slides : Ctrl-click or right-click the section 
heading, and then click Remove Section and Slides on the context menu.  
 Editing a Presentation Simultaneously 
with Your Colleagues 
 When you need to create a presentation quickly, you can edit the presentation 
simultaneously with your colleagues. As long as you can avoid stepping on each other’s 
toes, coauthoring a presentation is a fast and efficient way to work because you can avoid 
duplicating effort or working in different directions. 
 To  edit  a presentation simultaneously, you must store it on a SharePoint site or on OneDrive. 
If you have the choice between using a local SharePoint site and using OneDrive, choose the 
SharePoint site; it’ll give much better performance, especially if you create a large and 
complex presentation. 
 Figure 18-13.   After creating sections, you can use the context menu to rename them, rearrange them, or remove them 
 

543
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
 Here’s how to coauthor a presentation with your colleagues:
  Create the presentation : One of you creates the presentation in the 
normal way; for example, by basing it on a theme, as described earlier in 
this chapter, or by cloning an existing presentation (likewise). You save 
the presentation either to a SharePoint site on your local network or to 
OneDrive.  
  Open the presentation : The first person opens the presentation as usual. 
Then, whenever another person opens the presentation, PowerPoint 
displays a pop-up message telling them who else is working on it. The first 
person also sees a corresponding pop-up message (see Figure  18-14 ).  
  See the current list of editors : To see the full list of people editing the 
presentation, click the Authors readout at the right end of the title bar to 
display the authors editing this document pop-up menu (see Figure  18-15 ).  
 Tip  When coauthoring a presentation, either agree beforehand which slides or which section 
each person will work on or use instant messaging to keep in touch as you work. As far as possible, 
avoid working on the same slide as one of your coauthors; otherwise, it’s all too easy to create 
conflicting changes that you then need to resolve. 
 Note   Instead of editing a presentation simultaneously with your colleagues, you can use 
PowerPoint’s Comments feature to gather input on a presentation. To work with comments, you use 
the controls in the Comments group on the Review tab of the Ribbon. 
 Figure 18-14.   The Authors readout at the right end of the title bar shows you when another author opens the 
presentation for editing 
 

544
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Edit the presentation : You can work as normal using almost the full range 
of PowerPoint’s features. The main limitation is that only one person 
can edit any given element at a time. For this reason, the most practical 
approach is to work on different slides than your coauthors are editing.  
  Update the presentation : When you’ve made changes you want to share 
with your coauthors or when you’re ready to see what changes they’ve 
made, click the Save button on the title bar or press Cmd+S to save the 
presentation. PowerPoint uploads your changes to the document on the 
SharePoint site or on OneDrive and merges them with your coauthors’ 
changes; if your changes conflict with a coauthor’s changes, you 
need to resolve them, as described next. PowerPoint downloads your 
coauthors’ changes and displays them for you.  
  Resolve conflicts : If you and another author change the same element at 
the same time, PowerPoint displays the dialog box shown in Figure  18-16  
to whoever saves the document after the other. Click the Review Conflicts 
button, and then work in the Resolve Conflict dialog box that opens (see 
Figure  18-17 ).  
 Figure 18-16.   If PowerPoint displays this dialog box, click the Review Conflicts button, and then use the Resolve 
Conflict dialog box to work through the conflicting changes  
 Figure 18-15.   Click the Authors readout on the title bar to see the list of people editing the document 
 
 

545
CHAPTER 18: Starting to Build a Presentation in PowerPoint
  Close the presentation : When you have finished working with the 
presentation, save any unsaved changes that you want to keep. Then close 
the presentation as usual by choosing File ➤ Close from the menu bar.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to create a new PowerPoint presentation by basing it on a 
sample template, on a design theme, or on an existing presentation. You saw how to add 
slides to the presentation, rearrange them, and delete ones that aren’t needed. You grasped 
the techniques for adding content to slides, developing the outline of a presentation, and 
organizing slides into different sections. You also learned how to use PowerPoint’s powerful 
collaboration features to edit a presentation simultaneously with your coworkers. 
 In the next chapter, you’ll look at how to create compelling slides by making the layouts and 
the content work effectively together.  
 Figure 18-17.   In the Resolve Conflict dialog box, click the My Version option button or the Server Version option button for 
each change. When you finish deciding which versions of changes to keep, click the Done button to close the dialog box

 Chapter 19  
 Creating Clear and 
Compelling Slides  
 In this chapter, I’ll show you how to create slides that convey your meaning clearly and 
powerfully to your audience. 
 I’ll begin where you’ll probably want to start your presentation—by looking at how to plan 
the slides it will contain. Then you’ll see which of PowerPoint’s built-in slide layouts suits 
which type of content—and how you can create a custom slide layout when none of the 
built-in layouts fits the bill. 
 After that, you’ll learn how to add text to your slides and format it to look good. Finally, 
I’ll show you how to add tables, charts, SmartArt graphics, and hyperlinks to your slides. 
 Planning  the Slides in Your Presentation 
 As you plan your presentation and as you create the slides for it, keep the audience in mind. 
Whether you’ll deliver the presentation in person, via an Internet broadcast, or by distributing 
digital copies of the presentation, you want to make sure your slides are easy to read, are 
attractive to look at, and convey your meaning clearly. 
 For most presentations, follow these general rules when planning and creating your slides:
  Keep your text concise : Some presentation experts suggest following 
the “6×6 rule” for text slides: each slide should have about six bullet 
points of around six words each. The name is catchy, but the exact 
numbers are less important than the broader point: it’s fine to have 
anywhere from four to eight bullets, as long as each of them is fairly 
short and your slide is easy to read.  

548
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
  Keep your slides uncluttered  : If you need to choose between fitting in 
more information on an existing slide and adding a slide, it’s usually best 
to add the extra slide. Don’t feel you need to fill up each slide—it’s fine 
to leave blank space on a slide. You’re not short-changing the audience 
by making the presentation easy for them to assimilate.  
  Illustrate your points : When you make a point, drive it home by 
illustrating it with an example that catches your audience’s imagination. 
For example, don’t just say you’re now selling half a million gizmos a 
year—point out that’s enough for everyone in Albuquerque to have one.  
  Use your strongest material—not all your material : Many presentations 
suffer from too much detail. Usually, you can convince your audience that 
you have the facts and figures with just a couple of well-chosen examples; 
you don’t need to numb them with a complete rundown of the data.  
  Provide visual interest—but don’t overdo it : Even with the liveliest 
presenter, a text-only presentation can be dull as ditch water. As you’ll 
see in this chapter and the next, PowerPoint makes it easy to add tables, 
charts, graphics, videos, and animations to your slides, so it’s a good idea 
to include visually interesting and relevant information to give the audience 
something to look at. You can also use audio in your presentations.  
  Put a Welcome slide at the start of the presentation : Many presentations 
benefit from having a Welcome slide that gives the audience something 
to look at on entering the room and waiting for stragglers. A Welcome 
slide is good for you too because you can see that you have the 
presentation up and running correctly.  
  Give your presentation a final slide : Often, when you spend ages 
creating a presentation, finishing it is such a relief that you don’t 
notice it ends with a bump with the final slideful of content. For many 
presentations, it’s helpful to have a final slide that you can leave on 
the screen. This slide may be as simple as a single line—for example, 
“Questions?” or “Coffee and cookies in the lobby”—or even a colored 
screen with no text at all.  
 Tip   You may find it useful to keep extra material in reserve by using hidden slides or by 
creating custom slide shows that let you show a series of extra slides when you need to do so. 
See Chapter   20  for details on both these topics. 
 Note   For most presentations, you’ll have things that you definitely want to say to the audience but 
that don’t fit directly in the text of your slides. Put these items in your notes for the slide. Also put in 
the notes any things you may need to add, such as statistics to mention if audience members ask 
questions you’ve anticipated about the slides. 

549
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Choosing Slide Layouts to Suit the Contents 
 To get your material onto a slide and to make it look good, you need to choose a suitable 
layout. You can either use one of PowerPoint’s built-in slide layouts or create a custom 
layout of your own. 
 Using PowerPoint’s Built-in Slide Layouts 
 You’ll probably want to start by using the  standard  slide layouts that PowerPoint provides 
on the New Slide panel, which you open by choosing Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide from the 
Ribbon. The exact list of layouts depends on the theme or template you’re using. Table  19-1 
lists the most common layouts and explains when to use each.  
 Table 19-1.  PowerPoint’s Standard Slide Layouts and When to Use Them 
 Slide Layout 
 When to Use It 
 Title Slide 
 To start your presentation or to introduce a new section of it. 
 Title and Content 
 To display a content item such as a table, chart, or picture. 
 Section Header 
 To start a new section of the presentation. In most designs, this slide has a 
substantially different look from other slides to suggest the change. 
 Two Content 
 To display two content items, such as two pictures or two tables, but without 
necessarily comparing them to each other. 
 Comparison 
 To display two content items (for example, two charts) and compare them to 
each other. The Comparison layout is like the Two Content layout but has an 
extra text box above each item that you can use to highlight the differences. 
 Title Only 
 To add only a title to a slide or to have a title followed by content you 
place manually. 
 Blank 
 To create your own layout or to insert a blank slide as a pause in your 
presentation. 
 Content with Caption 
 To display a content item (such as a table or chart) over most of the slide, 
with a title and explanatory text alongside it. 
 Picture with Caption 
 To display a picture over most of the slide, with a title and explanatory 
text alongside it. The Picture with Caption layout is almost identical to the 
Content with Caption layout but is customized for pictures rather than other 
content types. 
 Title and Vertical Text 
 To display a horizontal title (as usual) and then vertical text items. This layout 
is useful for specialized purposes. 
 Vertical Text and Title 
 To display the title vertically on one side of the slide and the text items vertically 
on the other side. This layout can be useful for highly specialized purposes. 
 Title, Content and Text  To display a title on the top, content (such as a picture or table) on the left, 
and explanatory text on the right. This layout is widely useful. 
 Background Only 
 To display only a background on the slide. You can add other content as 
needed or simply show the background as a visual interlude. 

550
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 You can change a slide’s layout at any time by clicking the slide, choosing Home ➤ Slides ➤ 
Layout from the Ribbon, and then clicking the layout you want. And you can snap a slide’s 
layout back to its default settings by choosing Home ➤ Slides ➤ Reset from the Ribbon. 
 Creating Custom Slide Layouts 
 When none of PowerPoint’s built-in slide layouts is exactly what you want, you can create a 
custom  slide  layout in either of these ways:
  Apply the closest slide layout to what you want, and then customize 
it. For example, you can delete a placeholder by clicking it and then 
pressing Delete, or you can copy a placeholder by clicking it and then 
Option-dragging to where you want the copy.  
  Start with a blank slide layout, and then add the objects you need.  
 Formatting Text on Your Slides 
 You can format text on PowerPoint slides quickly by using the controls in the  Font group  and 
the  Paragraph group  on the Home tab of the Ribbon. You should be familiar with most of 
these controls from the first part of the book, but Figure  19-1 also points out several key 
controls and PowerPoint-specific controls that you’ll use in this section.  
 Note   If you change a slide’s layout by applying a layout that has fewer placeholders than the 
number of placeholders you’re currently using, PowerPoint leaves the extra placeholders on the 
slide so that you can deal with them. 
 Tip   After you create a custom slide layout, you can reuse it by selecting the slide and then 
duplicating it. For example, Ctrl-click or right-click the slide and then click Duplicate Slide on the 
context menu, press Cmd+Shift+D, or choose Home ➤ Slides ➤ New Slide ➤ Duplicate Slide from 
the Ribbon. 

551
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Note   To change the formatting of all the text in a placeholder, select the placeholder itself. To 
change the formatting of just some of the text, select that text. 
 Figure 19-1.  You can apply many  types  of text formatting quickly by using  the  controls in the Font group and Paragraph 
group on the Home tab of the Ribbon 
 Changing the Font, Font Size, and Alignment 
 You can easily change the  font, font size, and alignment  of text:
  Change the font size : Click the placeholder that contains the text, and 
then click the Increase Font Size button or the Decrease Font Size 
button in the Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon.  
  Change the font : Click the placeholder, open the Font pop-up menu in 
the Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon, and then click the font 
you want. The Theme Headings item and Theme Body item at the top of 
the list show the primary fonts used for the theme or template, so you 
may want to use them for consistency.  
  Change the alignment : Click the placeholder or click in the paragraph 
you want to affect, and then click the Align Text Left button, the 
Center button, the Align Text Right button, or the Justify button in the 
Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon.  
 To reach the full range of options for formatting fonts and characters, choose Format ➤ 
Font from the menu bar. PowerPoint opens the Format Font dialog box with the Font tab 
displayed (see Figure  19-2 ). To set widely used font formatting options, work on the Font 
tab. If you need to space characters farther apart or place them closer together, click the 
Character Spacing tab to display its controls.  
 

552
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 
KEEPING YOUR TEXT EASY TO READ
 Like most apps, PowerPoint gives you such a wide variety of fonts that it’s easy to make poor choices. 
 When choosing fonts and font sizes for your slides, put clarity foremost. If the audience can’t read the text on a 
slide because you’ve chosen an unsuitable font or too small a font size, your words of wisdom will be wasted. 
After creating a slide, make sure that even the smallest text on it will be easy to read from the back of the 
audience—and by someone with less than perfect eyesight. 
 Often, it’s tempting to use a striking or “designy” font to look different. But in most cases, the best fonts are 
those that people barely notice because they’re simply easy to read, such as the Calibri font used in the Office 
design. Unless you’re presenting to designers, you’re usually better off with straightforward fonts rather than 
fonts that set out to catch the eye. 
 Above all, keep the number of fonts to a sensible minimum. Using many different fonts can make your 
presentation look like an old-style ransom note. 
 Figure 19-2.   When you need full control over text formatting, open the Format Font dialog box, and then work on the 
Font tab or the Character Spacing tab, as needed 
 

553
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Changing the Indentation and Line  Spacing  of Text 
 To make text look right on a slide, you may need to adjust its indentation and line spacing. 
You can change these as follows:
  Change the indentation : Click the Indent Less button or the Increase 
More button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon. To 
take direct control, choose Format ➤ Paragraph from the menu bar to 
display the Paragraph dialog box (see Figure  19-3 ), and then use the 
controls in the Indentation area of the Indents and Spacing tab.  
 Figure 19-3.   Use the Indents and Spacing tab of the Paragraph dialog box when you need close control over the 
indentation and spacing of paragraphs 
  Change the line spacing : Click the Line Spacing button in the Paragraph 
group on the Home tab of the Ribbon, and then make your choice from 
the pop-up menu, which offers a range of choices from 0.5 lines to 3.0 
lines. For greater control, click the Line Spacing Options item on the 
pop-up menu to display the Paragraph dialog box, and then use the 
controls in the Spacing area on the Indents and Spacing tab.  
 

554
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Rotating  Text 
 For some slides, you may want to rotate text either in two dimensions or in three 
dimensions. 
 To rotate text simply, click the text placeholder, choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Text Direction 
from the Ribbon, and then click one of the directions on the pop-up menu (see Figure  19-4 ):
  Horizontal : Choose this item to restore text to normal horizontal orientation.  
 Figure 19-4.   Use the Text Direction panel in the Paragraph group on the Home tab of the Ribbon to turn text sideways 
or make it run in a stack down a slide. For other types of rotation, click the More Options item to open the Text Box 
category in the Format Text dialog box 
  Rotate all text 90° : Choose this item to turn the text on its side so that it 
reads from top to bottom.  
 Note   To rotate the text box freely rather than in 90-degree increments, click the text box, and then 
drag the round rotate button above it to the left or right, as for any other graphical object. 
  Rotate all text 270° : Choose this item to turn the text on its side so that 
it reads from bottom to top.  
  Stacked : Choose this item to make the text read from top to bottom but 
without rotating the letters. This arrangement is good for adding narrow 
labels to graphical items.  
 Caution   Use text rotation only for special effects. Don’t rely on rotated text to convey important 
points because the audience may find it difficult to read. 
 

555
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Figure 19-5.   On the Text Box subtab on the Text Options tab in the Format Shape pane (left), open the Text direction 
pop-up menu, and choose the text direction you want. On the Text Effects tab subtab (right), click the 3-D Rotation 
heading to display the 3-D Rotation controls (right), and then choose the rotation you want 
 If you need rotate text in other ways, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Text Direction ➤ More Options from 
the Ribbon to display the Text Box subtab on the Text Options tab in 
the Format Shape pane (see the left screen in Figure  19-5 ). 
 2. 
 In the Text Layout area at the top, open the Vertical alignment pop-up 
menu, and choose the alignment for the text: Top, Middle, Bottom, 
Top Centered, Middle Centered, or Bottom Centered.  
 Note   If you’ve rotated the text vertically, the Vertical alignment pop-up menu shows the options 
Right, Left, Center, Right Middle, Center Middle, and Left Middle instead of the options Top, Middle, 
Bottom, Top Centered, Middle Centered, and Bottom Centered. 
 

556
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
  3.  Open the Text direction pop-up menu and choose the direction for 
the text: Horizontal, Rotate All Text 90°, Rotate All Text 270°, 
or Stacked.  
 4. 
 If you want to apply 3-D rotation, click the Text Effects subtab, and 
then click the 3-D Rotation heading to expand its contents (see the 
right screen in Figure  19-5 ). 
 5. 
 Set up the 3-D rotation you want by using the Presets pop-up menu 
and the controls below it. See Chapter   4 for details on rotating shapes.  
 6. 
 Make sure the “Keep text flat” check box is cleared so that 
PowerPoint rotates the text rather than just the shape around it.  
 7. 
 Click the Close button (the X button in the upper-right corner) to 
close the Format Shape pane.  
 Using Bulleted Lists 
 Many PowerPoint slides use bulleted lists because they can be a great way of presenting 
your content clearly—provided you get them right. This section shows you how to handle 
the mechanics of  bulleted lists  and suggests ways to make your content easy for your 
audience to grasp. 
 Creating a Bulleted List 
 Creating a bulleted list is easy. When you start typing text in a placeholder that has bullets 
applied, PowerPoint automatically gives the paragraph a bullet. When you press Return to 
create the next paragraph, PowerPoint displays a bullet for that paragraph too. 
 To move the current paragraph down to the next lower level of bulleted list, press Tab at the 
beginning of the paragraph or choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Indent More from the Ribbon. 
Figure  19-6 shows a slide with three levels of indentation.  
 To move the current paragraph up to the next higher level, press Shift+Tab at the beginning 
of the paragraph or choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Indent Less from the Ribbon.  
 Tip  If you need to display text upside down, put it in its own container, and then rotate the 
container so that it is upside down. 

557
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Figure 19-6.   You can create a sublist by pressing Tab or by choosing Home  ➤ Paragraph  ➤ Indent More from 
the Ribbon  
 Making Sure Your Bulleted Lists Are Readable 
 The fonts and font sizes PowerPoint uses for text depend on the slide design. Many bulleted 
slides start off in a small enough font size to enable you to type five or six bullets of two lines 
each—so if you have fewer bullets on a slide or if each is less than a single line, it’s often a 
good idea to increase the font size to make the words easy to read. 
 When you start a bulleted sublist, PowerPoint reduces the font size. This makes the 
hierarchy of the bullet points clear, but it can easily make the text too small to read. You may 
need to increase the font size of the bulleted sublist points as well to keep them readable. 
The extra indentation and different bullets will still indicate the hierarchy. 
 Caution   PowerPoint lets you create pretty much as many levels of sublist as you want—just 
keep pressing Tab at the start of a line or clicking the Indent More button to go to the next level. 
But if you go past two levels of bullets, that should raise a red flag to indicate that your slide is 
becoming too complex. If some content is that far subordinate, either cut it or break the material up 
onto several slides. 
 

558
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Livening Up Your Slides with Custom Bullets 
 One way to make your slides look different is to change from the default bullet characters. 
PowerPoint provides a wide range of bullet characters, but you can also create your own. 
 To customize bullets, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the text placeholder in which you want to use the bullets.  
 2. 
 Choose Format ➤ Bullets and Numbering from the menu bar, or 
choose Home ➤ Paragraph ➤ Bullets ➤ Bullets and Numbering 
from the Ribbon, to display the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
PowerPoint shows the Bullets tab at the front (see Figure  19-7 ).  
 Figure 19-7.   Use the Bullets tab in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box to set up custom bullets for a list 
 1. 
 If you want to create a custom bullet based on an existing bullet, 
follow these steps:
  Click the bullet style you want to start with.  
  Open the Color pop-up palette, and then click the color you 
want. To choose a color that doesn’t appear, click the More 
Colors button, and then work in the Colors dialog box; click the 
OK button when you’ve chosen the color.  
  Use the Size box to increase or decrease the bullet’s size relative 
to the text. For example, set the bullet to 150% of text to make 
the bullet one and a half times the base height of the text.

CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 2. 
 If you want to use a different bullet character, click the Customize 
pop-up menu to display the Emoji & Symbols panel, and then click 
the character you want to insert. If you want to use a picture instead, 
go to step 5.  
 3. 
 To use a picture as a bullet, follow these steps:
  On the Bullets tab of the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, click 
the Picture button to display the Choose a Picture dialog box.  
  Navigate to the folder that contains the picture you want to use, 
and then click the picture file.  
  Click the Insert button. PowerPoint closes the Choose a Picture 
dialog box.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
PowerPoint applies the bullet you chose to the placeholder.  
 Adding Tables, SmartArt, Charts, and Hyperlinks to Slides 
 PowerPoint makes it as easy as possible to add graphical content to your slides. If the slide 
has a content placeholder (see Figure  19-8 ), click the appropriate icon in it, and then use the 
dialog box or pane that PowerPoint opens to identify the item you want. If the slide doesn’t 
have a content placeholder, use the commands on the Ribbon or the menu bar. Here are 
some examples:
  Insert a table : Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table from the Ribbon or Insert 
➤ Table from the menu bar.  
  Insert a picture : Choose Insert ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from the Ribbon or 
Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Picture from File from the menu bar.  
  Insert a chart : Choose Insert ➤ Illustrations ➤ Chart from the Ribbon, click 
the chart category, and then click the chart type. Or choose Insert ➤ Chart 
from the menu bar and then click the chart type on the Chart submenu.  
 Tip  If you want to be able to reuse a character easily as a bullet, add it to your Frequently Used 
list in the Emoji & Symbols panel. Look back to the “Inserting a Symbol Using the Emoji & Symbols 
Panel” section in Chapter   3 for full coverage of the Emoji & Symbols panel.

CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Adding Tables to Slides 
 You can create a new table on a slide, but you can often save time by importing a table from 
Word or by creating it from cells in an Excel worksheet. 
 Creating a Table from Scratch 
 To  create  a table from scratch, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Insert Table icon in a placeholder to display the Insert Table 
dialog box (see Figure  19-9 ). 
 Figure 19-8.   Click one of the six icons in a placeholder to start adding that type of content, or click the “Click to add 
text” prompt to start typing text 
 Figure 19-9.   To insert a new table, click the Insert table icon in a placeholder, and then specify the number of columns 
and rows in the Insert Table dialog box 
 
 

561
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Note   If the slide doesn’t have a content placeholder, choose Insert ➤ Table from the menu bar to 
display the Insert Table dialog box. Alternatively, choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table from the Ribbon, 
and then choose the table dimensions on the grid. 
 2. 
 In the Number of columns box, set the number of columns. Unless 
each data item is very short, you usually need to keep the number 
low (for example, three or four columns) to make sure the text is 
readable.  
 3. 
 In the Number of rows box, set the number of rows. You can add 
further rows as needed, so it’s fine to start with just a few.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Insert Table dialog box. PowerPoint 
inserts the table and gives it a design that works with the 
presentation’s color theme.  
 5. 
 Type the contents of the table, pressing Tab to move from one cell to 
the next. Figure  19-10 shows a table with sample data entered.  
 Figure 19-10.   At its default size, table data is often too small for comfortable reading from a distance 
 

562
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 6. 
 Resize the table and its contents as needed; for example,
  If the table occupies only part of the slide, drag the handle at the 
bottom of its container downward, or drag the lower-right handle 
down and to the right, to expand the table. PowerPoint increases 
the row height to take up the extra space.  
  With the table container selected, adjust the fonts to make the text 
easy to read. For example, click the Increase Font Size button a 
few times to pump up the font size. Figure  19-11 shows the same 
table taking up the full slide and with the text at a better size.  
 Figure 19-11.   To make a table more readable, give it as much of the space on the slide as it needs, and then increase 
the font sizes  
 7. 
 Change the design of the table as needed. For example, choose Table 
Design ➤ Table Styles from the Ribbon and then click the table style you 
want to apply, or go to the Table Style Options group on the Table Design 
tab and then apply formatting such as a header row or banded rows.  
 Importing a Table from Word 
 If the table you need to use in PowerPoint is already in a Word document, you can quickly 
reuse it in PowerPoint—but you may need to reformat it. Follow these general steps:
 1. 
 In Word, open the document that contains the table.  
 2. 
 Select the table, and then copy it to the Clipboard. For example, click in 
the table, and then choose Layout ➤ Table ➤ Select ➤ Select Table from 
the Ribbon or Table ➤ Select ➤ Table from the menu bar. Then Ctrl-click 
or right-click in the selection, and click Copy on the context menu.  
 

563
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 3. 
 In PowerPoint, navigate to the slide on which you want to place the 
table, and then create a table that has the same number of rows and 
columns as the table you’ve copied.  
 4. 
 Again in PowerPoint, Ctrl-click or right-click in the table you’ve just 
created, and then click Paste on the context menu. PowerPoint 
pastes the copied data straight into the new table.  
 5. 
 Format the table as needed in PowerPoint. Here are some examples:
  Resize the table’s container to the size you need.  
  Choose Table Design ➤ Table Styles ➤ Table Styles from the 
Ribbon, and then click the style you want to apply.  
  Still on the Table Design tab, choose any options in the Table 
Style Options group. For instance, select the Total Row check box 
if the table needs different formatting for a total row at the bottom.  
 Creating a Table from Excel Worksheet Data 
 When a PowerPoint slide needs a table of data that you have in an Excel  worksheet  , copy 
the data across and paste it in. Don’t waste time retyping the data and maybe introducing 
mistakes into it. 
 To create a PowerPoint table from Excel worksheet data, follow these steps:
 1. 
 In Excel, select the cells you want, and then copy them. For example, 
Ctrl-click or right-click in the selection, and then click Copy on the 
context menu.  
 2. 
 In PowerPoint, select the slide on which you want to place the data.  
 3. 
 Insert a table in one of these ways:
  If the slide has a placeholder displaying the content icons, 
click the Insert Table icon. Either set the exact number of rows 
and columns your Excel selection will occupy or (easier) insert 
a smaller table of maybe 2 columns by 2 rows. Click the OK 
button. PowerPoint automatically adjusts the number of columns 
and rows to fit the data you paste in.  
  Choose Insert ➤ Tables ➤ Table from the Ribbon, and then click 
the table size. Again, either set the right number of rows and 
columns or create a smaller table.  
 4. 
 Click to place the insertion point in the first cell in the table.  
 5. 
 Paste in the data. For example, choose Home ➤ Clipboard ➤ Paste 
from the Ribbon, choose Edit ➤ Paste from the menu bar or press 
Cmd+V.  

564
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
  6.  Format the table as needed in PowerPoint. Here are some examples:
  Resize the table’s container to occupy more of the slide.  
  Choose Table Design ➤ Table Styles ➤ Table Styles from the 
Ribbon, and then click the style you want to apply.  
  Also on the Table Design tab of the Ribbon, choose options in 
the Table Style Options group. For instance, select the Header 
Row check box to add header row formatting.  
  Display the Home tab of the Ribbon, and use the controls in the 
Font group on the Home tab of the Ribbon to change the font 
sizes as needed. For most slides, you need to increase the font 
size considerably from the size used in Excel to make the data 
easy to read in PowerPoint.  
 Adding SmartArt Graphics to Slides 
 You can add a SmartArt  graphic  to a slide by using the techniques explained in Chapter   4 . 
For example, you can add an org chart like this:
 1. 
 Select the slide on which you want to add the SmartArt graphic. 
Create a new slide if necessary.  
 2. 
 If there’s a content placeholder, click the Insert SmartArt Graphic 
icon to display the SmartArt menu.  
 3. 
 Click the type of SmartArt item you want to create. The panel for that 
type of SmartArt appears. For example, click the Hierarchy item to 
display the Hierarchy panel, which includes organization charts and 
similar diagrams.  
 4. 
 On the panel, click the type of graphic, such as Name and Title 
Organization Chart. PowerPoint inserts the graphic on the slide.  
 5. 
 If PowerPoint doesn’t display the SmartArt Text window, click the 
SmartArt Text button at the upper-left corner of the SmartArt graphic 
to display the SmartArt Text window.  
 6. 
 Type the text for each item in the SmartArt Text window.  
 7. 
 Drag the sizing handles to resize the SmartArt graphic to suit the 
slide best. For example, you may want to make it as big as will fit on 
the slide to enable the audience to read it easily.  

565
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Adding Charts to Slides 
 A chart can be a great way of presenting complex or detailed information in a manner that’s 
instantly clear on a slide. In PowerPoint, you can add a chart to a slide in two ways:
  Create a chart on an  embedded worksheet : You start the chart 
from inside PowerPoint, and PowerPoint causes Excel to create a 
workbook for the chart. The workbook is embedded in the PowerPoint 
presentation so it becomes part of that file. You don’t need to save the 
chart workbook separately.  
  Copy a chart from an  Excel workbook : Create your chart in Excel using 
the techniques described in Chapter   14 . Then copy the finished chart 
and paste it into your PowerPoint slide.  
 Here’s how to choose when to create a new embedded workbook, embed an existing 
workbook, link back to a workbook, or insert a picture:
  Create a new embedded workbook : Do this when you don’t yet have the 
data for the chart in Excel and you need to keep the chart’s data with the 
PowerPoint presentation, such as when you’re sending the presentation 
to someone else who will need to work on the chart data too.  
  Embed an existing chart and its data : Do this when you have the data 
for the chart or the chart itself in a workbook in Excel and you need 
to keep the chart’s data available in the PowerPoint presentation. 
After embedding the chart and its data, you can open the chart from 
PowerPoint in Excel and edit it there. If you open the chart in Excel 
(outside PowerPoint) and edit the chart, the chart in the presentation 
doesn’t receive the changes.  
  Link back to a workbook : Do this when you want to be able to change 
the chart or its source data in Excel and then automatically bring those 
changes into PowerPoint by updating the chart. Linking requires the 
workbook to stay in the same relative place in the computer’s file system 
to the presentation so that the presentation can find the updated data. 
Moving the presentation to a different computer breaks the link.  
 Caution   Linking a chart can be great when it works—but links can fail at the most awkward 
times. Before giving a presentation that includes linked charts, double-check that the links are 
working. That way, you’ll have a chance to fix any problems rather than discovering them when 
your audience sees them. 
  Insert a picture : Do this when you don’t need to keep the connection 
between the chart and its source data, and you will not need to edit the 
chart in the presentation.  

566
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 Creating a Chart in a New  Embedded Workbook  
 To create a chart on a worksheet in a new workbook embedded in your PowerPoint 
presentation, follow these steps:
 1. 
 On the slide where you want to create the chart, click the Insert Chart 
icon in a placeholder or simply click the Charts tab of the Ribbon. 
Either way, PowerPoint displays the Charts tab of the Ribbon.  
 2. 
 In the Insert Chart group, click the pop-up button for the category 
of chart you want to create. For example, click the Column pop-up 
button to display the Column panel.  
 3. 
 On the pop-up panel, click the chart type. PowerPoint creates a 
chart of that type on the slide and launches Excel, which creates a 
new workbook, embeds it in the presentation, and gives it a name 
such as Chart in Microsoft Office PowerPoint.  
 4. 
 Change the chart range and the sample data (see Figure  19-12 ) to 
the data your chart needs. PowerPoint automatically updates the 
chart to match the data in the Excel worksheet.  
 Figure 19-12.   Excel enters sample data on the first worksheet in the embedded workbook. Change this data to create 
your chart  
 

567
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 5. 
 When you have finished changing the data, close Excel. For example, 
click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) or 
choose Excel ➤ Quit Excel.  
 6. 
 Use the controls on the Chart Design tab and the Format tab of the 
Ribbon to format the chart the way you want it. Figure  19-13 shows a 
slide containing a chart with formatting under way.  
 Note  Excel saves the data in the embedded workbook automatically so you don’t need to save it 
while you’re working in the Excel window. 
 Figure 19-13.   After inserting a chart using an embedded workbook, use the controls on the Chart Design tab and the 
Format tab of the Ribbon to format the chart 
 

568
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 7. 
 Save your presentation.  
 Pasting a Chart from Excel into a PowerPoint Slide 
 If you have a chart already created in Excel or if you have a workbook containing the data 
from which you will create the chart, you can  paste  the chart into PowerPoint. Follow these 
general steps:
 1. 
 Create the chart using the techniques explained in Chapter   14 . 
 2. 
 Click the chart to select it.  
 3. 
 Copy the chart to the Clipboard. For example, click the Copy button 
on the Standard toolbar or press Cmd+C.  
 4. 
 Switch to PowerPoint, and then navigate to the slide on which you 
want to insert the chart.  
 5. 
 Paste in the chart from the Clipboard. For example, choose Home ➤ 
Clipboard ➤ Paste from the Ribbon, choose Edit ➤ Paste from the 
menu bar, or press Cmd+V.  
 6. 
 Click the Paste Options button at the lower-right corner of the chart, 
and then click the appropriate option button in the upper group on 
the Paste Options pop-up menu (see Figure  19-14 ):
  Chart (linked to Excel data) : Select this option button to link the 
chart back to the Excel workbook it came from.  
  Excel Chart (entire workbook) : Select this option button to embed 
the entire Excel workbook in the PowerPoint presentation.  
  Picture of Chart (smaller file size) : Select this option button to 
insert a picture of the chart. As the name says, inserting the 
picture helps keep the presentation file size down, but you can’t 
edit the picture.  
 Note   To edit the data on your chart again, click the chart on the slide, and then choose Chart 
Design ➤ Data ➤ Edit Data in Excel from the Ribbon. PowerPoint opens Excel, which displays the 
embedded worksheet. 

569
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 7. 
 If you want the chart on the slide to use the original formatting you 
gave it in Excel, click the Paste Options button again, and then select 
the Keep Source Formatting option button. Otherwise, leave the Use 
Destination Theme option button selected, and the chart will pick up 
the formatting from the presentation.  
 8. 
 Use the controls on the Chart Design tab or the Format tab of the 
Ribbon to format the chart the way you want it. (If you inserted the chart 
as a picture, use the controls on the Picture Format tab of the Ribbon.)  
 9. 
 Save the presentation.  
 To edit the data in either an embedded or linked chart, click the chart, and then choose 
Chart Design ➤ Data from Edit Data in Excel from the Ribbon.  
 Adding Hyperlinks to Slides 
 You can add  hyperlinks  to PowerPoint slides using the standard technique explained in 
detail in Chapter   3 .
 1. 
 Place the insertion point where you want to insert the hyperlink.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Hyperlink from the menu bar to display the Insert 
Hyperlink dialog box.  
 Figure 19-14.   When pasting a chart from Excel into a PowerPoint slide, click the Paste Options button, and use the 
option buttons on the pop-up menu to choose how to paste the chart 
 

570
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
 3. 
 In the Select a place in this document box, choose the destination 
for the hyperlink (see the examples below), and specify the text to 
display on the slide.  
 4. 
 Click the OK button to close the Insert Hyperlink dialog box and 
insert the hyperlink.  
 In your presentations, you typically use hyperlinks on slides for two purposes:
  Link to other slides in the presentation : To make it easy for the presenter 
or someone browsing the presentation to move to another slide, add 
a hyperlink to it. Follow these steps after opening the Insert Hyperlink 
dialog box:
  Click the This Document tab to display its contents.  
  In the Select a place in this document box, click the slide you want 
the link to display (see Figure  19-15 ). 
 Figure 19-15.   Use the Select Place in Document box on the This Document tab of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to 
create a link to another slide in the same presentation. This is a great way of enabling the viewer to navigate quickly 
about the presentation. 
  Edit the text in the Text to Display box as needed.  
  If you need to provide additional information about the hyperlink, 
click the ScreenTip button in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, type 
ScreenTip text in the Set Hyperlink ScreenTip dialog box, and then 
click the OK button.  
  Click the OK button to close the Insert Hyperlink dialog box and 
insert the hyperlink.  
 

571
CHAPTER 19: Creating Clear and Compelling Slides
  Link to a web site : You’ll often want to include a link to your web site. In 
a live presentation, you can click the hyperlink to display your web site 
directly from a slide. In a presentation you share with others, they can 
click the hyperlink to go to the web site or to find out how to contact 
you. Click the Web Page or File tab to display its controls, and then type 
or paste the address in the Address box.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to plan and put together attractive and compelling slides. 
You now know how to use PowerPoint’s built-in slide layouts effectively, how to create your 
own custom layouts, and how to add graphical elements such as table, charts, and SmartArt 
to your slides. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to add graphics, movies, and sounds to your 
presentations; how to animate the objects on a slide; and how to apply transitions 
between slides.  
 Note   You can also add a link that starts an e-mail message to a specific address and with a subject 
line of your choosing. To do so, work on the Email Address tab of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.

 Chapter 20  
 Adding Life and Interest to 
Your Presentation  
 In the previous two chapters, you learned how to create a presentation and how to fill it 
with good-looking slides that convey the message you want. In this chapter, you’ll look at 
how to inject life and interest into a presentation by adding graphics, movies and sounds, 
animations, and transitions. You’ll also learn to hide slides so that they don’t appear during 
a slide show, allowing you to keep them in reserve, and how to create custom slide shows 
within a presentation so that you can show only specific parts of it. 
 Adding Pictures to a Presentation 
 Many slides benefit from having pictures—graphics or photos—to illustrate or offset their 
text content. You can easily add a picture in these ways:  
  Use a content placeholder : If the slide includes a content placeholder, 
click either of the two Picture from File icons to display the Choose a 
Picture dialog box. Click the picture file, and then click the Insert button.  
  Use the Picture from File command : If the slide doesn’t have a content 
placeholder, choose Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Pictures ➤ Picture from File 
from the Ribbon or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Picture from File from the menu 
bar to open the Choose a Picture dialog box. Select the picture file you 
want to add, and then click the Insert button.  
  Drag a photo from the Photo Browser : If the photo is in the Photos app, 
choose Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Pictures ➤ Photo Browser from the Ribbon 
or Insert ➤ Picture ➤ Photo Browser from the menu bar to open the 
Photo Browser, and then drag the photo to the slide.  
  Drag a picture file from a Finder window : You can also open a Finder 
window to the folder that contains the picture file and then drag the 
picture file to a slide in the PowerPoint window.  

574
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 Once you’ve added a graphic or photo to a slide, you can work with it using the techniques 
discussed in Chapter   4  . For example, you can click the picture and drag it (see Figure  20-1 ) to 
where you need it to appear. Or you can use the commands in the Adjust group on the Picture 
Format tab of the Ribbon to correct the picture’s colors, apply filters, or remove the background.  
 When you select a picture, PowerPoint adds the Picture Format tab to the Ribbon. You can 
use the controls on the Picture Format tab to quickly crop and resize the picture as needed. 
For example, to crop the photo, choose Picture Format ➤ Size ➤ Crop from the Ribbon, and 
then give the appropriate cropping command on the Crop panel (see Figure  20-2 ):
  Crop : Click this button to display cropping handles around the picture. 
You can then drag a cropping handle to resize the picture, drag a sizing 
handle to resize it, or drag the picture to a different position on the slide.  
  Crop to Shape : Click this item to display the Crop to Shape panel, and 
then click the shape you want to use. This feature can be great for 
design effects.  
  Aspect Ratio : Click this item to display the Aspect Ratio panel, and then 
click the aspect ratio, such as 3:4 in the Portrait section or 5:3 in the 
Landscape section.  
  Fill : Click this item to crop the picture so that it fills the whole 
placeholder. PowerPoint typically cuts off part of the picture to make it 
fit, but it doesn’t distort the picture. This is usually the best choice for 
photographs.  
 Figure 20-1.   The quick way to reposition a picture on a slide is to drag it to where you need it. The ScreenTip shows 
the details of the picture’s position 
 

575
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
  Fit : Click this button to resize the picture horizontally, vertically, or both 
so that the whole picture fits inside the placeholder. Doing this often 
distorts the picture, so it’s not a good choice for most photographs.  
 Adding Movies and Sounds to a Presentation 
 Graphics and photos can make a big difference to a presentation, but you may also want to 
add movies and sounds. This section shows you how to do both. 
 Adding a Movie to a Slide 
 You can add a movie file to a slide so that you can play the movie as needed during the 
presentation. If the movie is in the iMovie app, you can add it by using the Movie Browser. 
Otherwise, you can add the movie from a file in your Mac’s file system.  
 Adding a Movie from the Movie Browser 
 To add a movie from the Movie Browser, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Media ➤ Video ➤ Movie Browser from the Ribbon 
or Insert ➤ Video ➤ Movie Browser from the menu bar to display the 
Movie Browser.  
 Figure 20-2.   Use the commands on the Crop panel to crop a picture the way you want it to appear 
 

576
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 2. 
 Expand the Movies category, the Photos category, or the iTunes 
category (as needed) and then navigate to the movie you want to add.  
 3. 
 Click the movie and drag it to the slide.  
 Adding a Movie from a File 
 To add a movie file from your Mac’s file system to a slide, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Select the slide on which you want to add the movie. Add a new 
slide if necessary.  
 2. 
 If the slide has a content placeholder, click the Insert Movie from File 
icon to display the Choose a Movie dialog box. If not, choose Insert 
➤ Media ➤ Video ➤ Movie from File from the Ribbon to open this 
dialog box.  
 3. 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the movie file, and then click the 
file to select it.  
 4. 
 If you want to link the movie file rather than insert it, select the Link to 
file check box.  
 5. 
 Click the Insert button. PowerPoint closes the Choose a Movie dialog 
box and places the movie on the slide.  
 Making the Movie Look and Play the Way You Want 
 After inserting a movie, you can change both the way it appears on the slide and how it 
plays back. To do so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the movie to select it. PowerPoint adds the  Video Format tab  to 
the Ribbon (see Figure  20-3 ).  
 Tip  Linking keeps down the size of the presentation (because the presentation file contains the 
link rather than the whole movie), but the movie will play only when the movie file is in the same 
place in the file system as when you created the link. Generally, this means that if you move the 
presentation to a different Mac, the movie won’t play (the exception is if the movie is in exactly the 
same place in the other Mac’s file system, such as on a USB stick or a shared network drive). 

577
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 2. 
 Adjust the movie file’s appearance as needed by positioning the 
movie file and then using the controls on the Video Format tab:
  Click the movie file to select it, and then drag it into the right 
position on the slide.  
  If necessary, resize the movie frame by dragging a corner handle. 
You can also crop it by choosing Video Format ➤ Size ➤ Crop and 
then working on the Crop panel.  
  To correct the movie’s brightness and contrast, choose Video 
Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Corrections, and then click the balance of 
brightness and contrast you want.  
  To change the movie’s color balance, choose Video Format ➤ Adjust 
➤ Color, and then click the color option you want. For example, you 
can apply a sepia hue or make the movie black and white.  
  To choose which frame of the movie appears on the slide until you 
play the movie, use the playback controls to move the movie to the 
frame you want. Then pause the movie and choose Video Format ➤ 
Adjust ➤ Poster Frame ➤ Current Frame. 
 Figure 20-3.   After inserting a movie on a slide, use the controls on the Video Format tab of the Ribbon to make it 
appear the way you want 
 

578
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
  To put the movie in a frame, choose Video Format ➤ Video Styles and 
then click the style you want. You can either click one of the styles in 
the Video Styles box or hold the pointer over the Video Styles box, click 
the panel button to display the Video Styles panel, and then click the 
frame you want.  
  To crop the movie to a shape, choose Video Format ➤ Size ➤ Crop ➤ 
Change Shape, and then click the shape on the Change Shape panel.  
  To apply effects to the movie, choose Video Format ➤ Video Styles 
➤ Video Effects, click the appropriate item on the Effects panel, and 
then click the effect on the panel that opens. For example, you can 
apply a shadow, a reflection, or a 3-D rotation.  
 3. 
 In the Start pop-up menu in the Video Options group on the 
Video Format tab, choose When Clicked if you want to start the 
movie playing by clicking it. If you want the movie to start playing 
automatically, choose Automatically.  
 4. 
 To control how the movie plays back, use the four check boxes in the 
Video Options group on the Video Format tab:
  Play full screen : Select this check box to display the movie full screen 
rather than just in the area it occupies on the slide. This setting is 
useful for giving the movie full impact without devoting a full slide to it.  
  Loop until stopped : Select this check box to make the movie keep 
playing over and over again until you stop it. Looping the movie can 
be useful for presentations used at trade shows and the like, but it’s 
cruel and unusual treatment for a regular audience.  
  Hide during show : Select this check box to make PowerPoint hide 
the movie any time it’s not playing.  
  Rewind after playing : Select this check box to make PowerPoint 
rewind the movie to the beginning when it reaches the end. Automatic 
rewinding is useful if you may need to play the movie again.  
 5. 
 Click the Play button (choose Video Format ➤ Preview ➤ Play) to 
play the movie and check that everything is how you want it to be.  
 Adding a Sound to a Slide 
 Depending on the type of presentation you’re creating, you may find it helpful to add sounds 
to some slides. For example, you can add music that plays automatically when the slide it’s 
on is displayed or insert a sound file that you can play as needed by clicking its icon.  
 Tip Instead of using a frame from the movie as the poster frame, you can use a still picture. Choose 
Video Format ➤ Adjust ➤ Poster Frame ➤ Picture from File, select the picture in the Choose a 
Picture dialog box, and then click the Insert button.

CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 You can add a sound to a slide by using the Audio Browser pane, by adding a sound directly 
from a file, or by recording audio into a slide. The following sections give you the details. 
 Adding a Sound from the Audio Browser 
 If the sound you want to use is in your iTunes library or in GarageBand, you can add it 
by using the Audio Browser. Choose Insert ➤ Media ➤ Audio ➤ Audio Browser from the 
Ribbon or Insert ➤ Audio ➤ Audio Browser from the menu bar to display the Audio Browser, 
locate the sound you want, and then drag it to the slide.  
 Adding a Sound from a File 
 If the sound you want to use isn’t in your iTunes library or in GarageBand but rather in a file 
in your Mac’s file system, follow these steps to add it to a slide:  
 1. 
 Select the slide on which you want to add the audio.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Media ➤ Audio ➤ Audio from File from the Ribbon 
or Insert ➤ Audio ➤ Audio from File from the menu bar to display the 
Choose Audio dialog box.  
 3. 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the file you want to insert, and 
then click the file.  
 4. 
 If you want to link the audio file rather than embed it, select the Link 
to file check box. Normally, you want to do this only when you will 
deliver the presentation on the same Mac you’re using to create the 
presentation.  
 5. 
 Click the Insert button. PowerPoint adds the sound to the slide.  
 Caution   If you add to a presentation an audio file that you’ve bought from Apple’s iTunes Store 
in a protected audio format (such as AAC), you’ll be able to play the audio back only on computers 
authorized for your iTunes account. When you move a presentation to a different computer, double-
check that your audio files play correctly before you give a presentation. 
 Tip  You can also add a file from a sound by dragging the sound file from a Finder window to a slide. 
 Note   Make sure the audio you add to your slides enhances them rather than distracts the 
audience. For example, playing background audio when your introductory slide is displayed can 
help set the scene while your audience is arriving and getting settled, but in a typical spoken 
presentation, most slides will not need background audio. 

580
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 Recording Audio into a Slide 
 Using a prerecorded sound works well for many slides, but you may also want to record 
custom audio for other slides. PowerPoint’s Record Audio feature lets you record audio 
directly onto a slide using your Mac’s microphone or other audio hardware you’ve connected.  
 To record audio onto a slide, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the slide.  
 2. 
 Choose Insert ➤ Media ➤ Audio ➤ Record Audio from the Ribbon 
or Insert ➤ Audio ➤ Record Audio from the menu bar to display the 
Record Sound dialog box (see Figure  20-4 ). 
 3. 
 In the Name text box, type the name you want to give the sound. 
PowerPoint suggests the generic “Recorded Sound,” but a more 
descriptive name is usually more helpful.  
 4. 
 Click the Record button (the red circle, as usual) to start the 
recording. Speak or perform the audio, and then click the Stop 
button to stop recording.  
 5. 
 Click the Play button (the black triangle pointing right) to play back 
the audio and check that it has come out acceptably. Re-record it if 
necessary.  
 6. 
 Click the Insert button to save the audio on the slide. PowerPoint 
closes the Record Sound dialog box and adds the sound to the slide.  
 Note  Recording audio via the microphone is fine for adding narration to individual slides. But if 
you need to create high-quality recorded audio, use an app such as GarageBand to create a sound 
file and process it as needed. Then add the finished file to the presentation by using the Audio 
Browser pane. 
 Figure 20-4.   Use the Record Sound dialog box when you need to record audio directly onto a slide 
 

581
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 Positioning the Sound and Setting Its Volume 
 Whichever of the previous three ways you use to add the sound to the slide, PowerPoint 
inserts an  audio icon  (see Figure  20-5 ) representing the sound.  
 Select the icon by clicking it, and then drag it to where you want it to appear. Then, with the 
icon still selected, use the pop-up controls to test the audio clip and set the volume at which 
you want it to play.  
 Adding Transitions to Slides 
 Instead of having a straightforward switchover from one slide to the next, you can set 
PowerPoint to play a   transition , which is an effect that smoothes, animates, or dramatizes 
the change of slides. You can set a different transition for each side if necessary. You specify 
the transition by selecting the slide and choosing the transition to play when the slide 
appears (as opposed to setting the transition for when PowerPoint changes the slide to the 
next). 
 PowerPoint provides a wide range of transitions that you can apply from the Transitions tab 
of the Ribbon (see Figure  20-6 ). 
 Note   Depending on the presentation template or design you're using, some or all of the slides in 
the presentation may already have transitions applied to them. 
 Figure 20-5.   PowerPoint inserts an audio item as a speaker icon. Click the icon to display controls for testing the audio 
and setting the volume 
 Figure 20-6.   The Transitions tab of the Ribbon gives you one-stop access to the key controls for setting up transitions 
between slides 
 
 

582
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 PowerPoint breaks up the transitions into three categories:
  Subtle : Use these transitions when you don’t need to draw the 
audience’s attention to the transition. The first transition in the Subtle 
category is the None transition, which you apply when you don’t want a 
transition effect between slides.  
  Exciting : Use these transitions when you want to make sure the 
audience notices the transition. For example, you can use an effect such 
as Vortex or Shred to dramatize the switchover from one slide to another 
that uses a similar look and so might be mistaken for the previous slide.  
  Dynamic Content : Use these transitions when you want to draw 
attention to the transition. For example, the Ferris Wheel transition 
makes the incoming slide go around as if it were moving on a Ferris 
wheel.  
 To apply a transition, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the slide to which you want to apply the transition.  
 2. 
 Click the Transitions tab to display its contents.  
 3. 
 Apply the transition you want:
  If the transition appears in the Transitions box in the Transition to 
This Slide group, click it. You can also scroll the list of transitions 
to the left or right to make other transitions appear in the box. 
PowerPoint plays a preview of the transition in the Slide pane.  
  If the transition doesn’t appear, hold the pointer over the Transitions 
box until the panel button appears, and then click the panel button 
to display the Transitions panel (see Figure  20-7 ), which lists the 
transitions in the three categories discussed above. Click the 
transition you want. Again, PowerPoint plays a preview of the 
transition in the Slide pane.  
 Tip  PowerPoint’s transitions are easy and fun to apply, but don’t go hog wild with them. In a 
typical presentation, not every slide benefits from a transition; and when you do use a transition, 
one of the Subtle transitions often gives the best effect. Keep the Exciting and Dynamic Content 
transitions for those rare occasions when you actually want to draw your audience’s attention to the 
transition rather than to the content of the slides. 

583
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 4. 
 To choose options for the transition, choose Transitions ➤ Transition 
to This Slide ➤ Effect Options from the Ribbon, and then click the 
option you want on the Effect Options panel that opens.
  The choices on the Effect Options panel vary depending on the 
transition you’ve selected. For example, the Vortex transition has 
four directional options (From Left, From Top, From Right, and From 
Bottom), while the Honeycomb transition has no options.  
  PowerPoint plays a preview of the effect after you select it. To 
preview the transition again, choose Transitions ➤ Preview ➤ 
Preview from the Ribbon.  
 5. 
 If you want to add a sound to the transition, choose Transitions ➤ 
Timing ➤ Sound from the Ribbon, and then click the sound on the 
pop-up menu. You can make the sound keep playing until the next 
sound starts (open the Sound pop-up menu, go right to the bottom, 
and then click the Loop Until Next Sound option to place a check 
mark next to it), but this is not usually a good idea.  
 Figure 20-7.   Open the Transition panel to access the full range of transitions all at once 
 

584
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 6. 
 If you want to change the duration of the transition, set it in the 
Duration box in the Transition to This Slide group on the Transitions 
tab. PowerPoint automatically sets the duration to a suitable length 
for the transition you choose, but you may need to change it to 
make your presentation’s timing work. The units are seconds and 
hundredths of seconds.  
 7. 
 In the  Timing group  on the Transitions tab, choose how to advance 
the slide to the next slide:
  On Mouse Click : Select this check box if you want to click the 
pointing device to move to the next slide.  
  After : To display the next slide automatically, select this check box, 
and then set the timing in the text box.  
 8. 
 Preview the transition again to make sure it gives the effect you want, 
and then click the Save button on the title bar to save your changes.  
 Adding Animations to Slides 
 When you need to bring a slide to life, you can animate one or more of the objects on it. For 
example, you may need to make an object appear on a slide, draw attention to itself at a key 
point, or disappear from view when its role is over—or all three.  
 You can also use animations to reveal only part of a slide or part of an object at a time, 
which can help keep the audience focused on your current point rather than reading ahead 
to the end of the slide. 
 Understanding the Essentials of Animations 
 To add an animation to a slide, you apply it to an object on the slide, such as a picture or a 
text placeholder. Any object can have one or more animations, and you can arrange them 
into the order you need. 
 Note   If you want to apply the same transition to all slides, choose the transition and its options, 
and then choose Transitions ➤ Timing ➤ Apply to All from the Ribbon. You may want to apply the 
same transition to all slides at first, and then apply a different transition or different effects to a few 
slides that deserve special attention. 
 Note   To use a sound other than PowerPoint’s built-in sounds, choose Transitions ➤ Timing ➤ 
Sound ➤ Other Sound from the Ribbon, click the sound file in the “Choose a .wav Sound” dialog 
box, and then click the Insert button. 

585
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 PowerPoint provides a wide range of animations in four categories:
  Entrance effects : These animations bring the object onto the slide. For 
example, the Appear animation makes the object appear in place, while 
the Swivel animation makes the object appear and swivel several times.  
  Emphasis effects : These animations help draw the audience’s attention 
to the object. For example, the Pulse animation makes the object pulse 
visibly, and the Spin animation makes the object revolve around its axis.  
  Exit effects : These animations remove the object from the slide. For 
example, the Disappear animation makes the object vanish, while the 
Shrink & Turn animation makes the object turn sideways as it disappears 
into the distance.  
  Path animations : These animations make the object move around and 
then return to its original position.  
 The next section shows you how to add a straightforward animation to an object. The 
section after that shows you how to create more complex animations.  
 Adding an Animation to an Object 
 To add a straightforward animation  to an object  on a slide, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the object to select it.  
 2. 
 Click the Animations tab of the Ribbon to display its controls.  
 3. 
 Add an Entrance effect, an Emphasis effect, or an Exit effect by 
following these steps. The example adds an Entrance effect.
  Hold the pointer over the Entrance Effects box to display the panel 
button. 
  Click the panel button to display the Entrance Effects panel (see 
Figure  20-8 ). 
  Click the effect. PowerPoint applies the effect and plays a preview 
of it. 
 Caution   As with transitions, it’s easy to go over the top with animations. Resist the temptation! 
Animations will have more effect in your slides if you use them sparingly and only at the appropriate 
times. When you do use animations, make sure the ones you choose work together; PowerPoint 
provides a wide variety of animations to help you achieve different effects, not to suggest you 
should use them all in the same presentation—let alone on the same slide. 

586
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
  Apply any options the effect needs by choosing Animations ➤ 
Advanced Animation ➤ Effect Options from the Ribbon and then 
clicking the appropriate item on the Effect Options panel. The 
options available depend on the effect you’ve chosen; for example, 
many animations offer direction options such as From Bottom, From 
Bottom-Left, From Left, From Top-Left, From Top, From Top-Right, 
From Right, and From Bottom-Right. Some effects have no options.  
 4. 
 To control when the animation runs, use the controls in the Timing 
group:
  Open the Start pop-up menu, and choose when to start the 
animation: On Click (in other words, when you click the pointing 
device), With Previous (at the same time as the previous animation), 
or After Previous (after the previous animation has finished).  
  In the Duration text box, set the number of seconds and hundredths 
of seconds you want the animation to run, such as 1.50 for one and 
a half seconds.  
 5. 
 Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add further animations as needed. For 
example, if you’ve already added an Entrance effect to an object, you 
may want to add an Exit effect as well.  
 Figure 20-8.   You can quickly apply an animation to an object by using the Entrance Effects panel, the Emphasis Effects 
panel, the Exit Effects panel, or the Path Animation panel on the Animations tab of the Ribbon  
 

587
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 6. 
 Click the Preview button in the Preview group to preview the 
animation and see whether you need to make further changes.  
 Changing the Order of Animations 
 When you apply multiple animations to the same slide, you may need to  change the order  in 
which they occur. To do so, choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Animation Pane 
from the Ribbon to display the Animation pane. Figure  20-9 shows a slide that contains six 
animations, including all those applied to the text container, with the Animation pane open.  
 These are the main actions you can take in the Animation pane:
  Play an animation : In the Animation order list box, Ctrl-click or right-
click the animation, and then click Play From on the context menu. 
Alternatively, click the Play From button at the top of the Animations pane.  
 Note   If you need to change the order of animations you’ve applied to an object, work as 
described in the next section. 
 Figure 20-9.   Use the Animation pane to examine the animations and to control which plays when 
 

588
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
  Change the order of the animations : In the Animation order list box, 
click an animation to select it, and then click the Up button or the Down 
button to move it up or down the list. You can also drag an animation up 
or down the list; drop it when the blue line appears in the right place.  
  Expand or collapse a container’s animations : Click the disclosure triangle 
to expand or collapse the list of a container’s animation. In Figure  20-9 , 
the list for Content Placeholder 2 is expanded.  
  Change an animation’s effect options : Click an animation to select 
it, click the Effect Options heading in the Animations pane to display 
the effect options, and then work with the controls. (You can click the 
disclosure triangle next to the Effect Options heading instead, but 
clicking the heading is usually easier.)  
  Change an animation’s timing : Click an animation to select it, click the 
Timing heading in the Animations pane to display the timing options, 
and then work with the controls. Here, too, you can click the disclosure 
triangle next to the Timing heading if you prefer.  
 When you have finished using the Animation pane, close it by clicking its Close button (the 
X button in its upper-right corner) or by choosing Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ 
Animation Pane from the Ribbon.  
 Using Animation to Display Bulleted Paragraphs One at a Time 
 When you have several  bulleted paragraphs  in a text placeholder, you can use animation to 
display them one at a time. This helps prevent the audience from reading ahead of you and 
missing the point you’re explaining. 
 To display bulleted paragraphs one at a time, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the container that holds the bulleted paragraphs.  
 2. 
 Apply the animation to the container from the appropriate Effects 
panel. For example, apply the Fly In animation from the Entrance 
Effects panel.  
 3. 
 If the animation offers different directions, choose Animations ➤ 
Advanced Animation ➤ Effect Options from the Ribbon, and then 
click the direction you want. For example, click From Right.  
 4. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Effect Options from 
the Ribbon again, and this time click the Sequence option you want:
  As One Object : PowerPoint animates the whole object at once.  
  All at Once : PowerPoint animates each top-level paragraph 
separately but runs the animations all at once. Depending on the 
animation, this can look very similar to As One Object, but it can 
also look different.  
  By Paragraph : PowerPoint animates each top-level paragraph 
separately. This is usually the most useful setting.  

589
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 5. 
 Click the Play button (choose Animations ➤ Preview ➤ Preview from 
the Ribbon) to preview the effect.  
 6. 
 Click the container that holds the bulleted paragraphs.  
 7. 
 If the text has different levels, and you need to control their 
paragraphs separately, click the Text Animations heading in the 
Animations pane to display the Text Animations controls (see 
Figure  20-10 ). 
 8. 
 Open the Group text pop-up menu and choose the animation you 
want: All paragraphs at once, 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4th level, or 
5th level. For example, if the container has two levels of paragraphs, 
and you want to control both separately, choose 2nd level.  
 Note  In the Text Animations area of the Animation pane, you can also choose to animate text by 
word or by letter rather than all at once. Open the Animate text pop-up menu, and then choose By 
word or By letter, as needed, instead of All at once. 
 Figure 20-10.   In the Group text pop-up menu in the Text Animations section of the Animation pane, choose the level of 
paragraphs by which you want to animate the object 
 

590
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 9. 
 Select the In reverse order check box if you want to animate the 
paragraphs in reverse order.  
 10. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Animation Pane from 
the Ribbon or click the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of 
the Animation pane to close the pane.  
 Animating SmartArt Graphics, Charts, and Tables 
 You can apply animations to SmartArt graphics, charts, and tables just as you can to other 
objects in PowerPoint. Animations are especially useful when you want to reveal only part of 
one of these objects at a time, gradually building up to showing the whole object. 
 Animating a SmartArt Graphic 
 PowerPoint enables you to animate the component parts of a  SmartArt graphic  in sequence, 
so you can choose between displaying the whole object at once, displaying all the objects at 
a particular level, or displaying one object at a time. 
 To choose how to display a SmartArt graphic, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the SmartArt graphic by clicking it on the slide.  
 2. 
 Apply the animation to the graphic as a whole from one of the Effects 
panels. For example, apply the Fade animation from the Subtle 
section of the Entrance Effects panel. Fade makes the whole graphic 
appear at once with the animation.  
 3. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Effect Options from 
the Ribbon, and then click the way you want to animate the graphic:
  As One Object : This option displays the graphic as a single object, 
so it all appears in one animation. 
  All at Once : This option treats the graphic as separate objects but 
runs the animation on all the objects at once.  
  One by One : This option treats each component of the graphic as a 
separate object. In many cases, this is the most useful option.  
  Level at Once : This option treats each level of a hierarchical 
SmartArt graphic as a separate object. Choose this option when you 
want to display one level of the graphic at a time.  
 Note The selection of options on the Effect Options pop-up menu depends on the object you’re 
animating. For example, the Level at Once option and the Level One by One option appear only for 
objects that have levels.

591
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
  Level One by One : This option treats each level of a hierarchical 
SmartArt graphic as a separate object and treats each object within 
the level as a separate object. Choose this option when you want to 
display the graphic one object of a level at a time.  
 4. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Preview ➤ Preview to preview the effect.  
 5. 
 If you need to change the order, choose Animations ➤ Advanced 
Animation ➤ Animation Pane from the Ribbon. PowerPoint displays 
the Animation pane.  
 6. 
 In the list box, click the container that holds the SmartArt object. 
PowerPoint displays the SmartArt Animation section at the bottom of 
the Animation pane.  
 7. 
 Open the Group graphic pop-up menu, and then click the option you 
want. The options available depend on the type of SmartArt graphic, 
but these are typical:
  As one object : Choose this option to display the whole SmartArt 
graphic at once.  
  All at once : Choose this option to display all the components of the 
SmartArt graphic at once.  
  One by one : Choose this option to display one component at a time.  
  By branch one by one : Choose this option to display each branch of 
a graphic such as an org chart separately, showing one component 
at a time.  
  By level at once : Choose this option to display each level of a 
graphic separately, showing the whole level at once.  
  By level one by one : Choose this option to display each level of a 
graphic separately, showing one component at a time.  
 8. 
 If you want to reveal the SmartArt graphic in reverse order, select the 
Reverse order check box.  
 9. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Animation Pane from 
the Ribbon or click the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of 
the Animation pane to close the pane.  
 Animating a Chart 
 When you’re displaying a  chart  , it’s often helpful to use an animation to show part of it at a 
time rather than displaying the whole chart at once. To do this, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Select the chart by clicking it on the slide that contains it.  
 2. 
 Apply the animation to the chart as a whole from one of the Effects 
panels. For example, apply the Appear animation.  

592
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 3. 
 Choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ Effect Options from 
the Ribbon, and then click the way you want to animate the chart:
  As one object : This setting displays the chart all at once, so you 
probably won’t want to use it.  
  By series : This setting displays one full data series at a time and is 
good for contrasting the data series to each other.  
  By category : This setting displays one whole category at a time and 
is good for comparing the categories.  
  By element in series : This setting displays each element in a series 
at a time, then the next element in the series, and so on, until the 
series is finished. This setting is great for focusing on the individual 
elements in the series.  
  By element in category : This setting displays each element in a 
category at a time, then the category’s next element, and so on. Use 
this setting to zero in on the individual elements in the categories.  
 4. 
 If necessary, choose Animations ➤ Advanced Animation ➤ 
Animation Pane from the Ribbon to display the Animation pane, click 
the chart’s placeholder in the list box, and then adjust the settings. 
For example, if you’ve chosen the By Element in Series option, you 
can set the elements in a series to display automatically one after the 
other, using a short delay between them (set the delay in the Delay 
box in the Timing section of the Animations pane).  
 5. 
 Preview the animation and make sure that the objects appear as you 
want them to appear.  
 Animating a Table 
 When you’re displaying a complex  table  on a slide, it’s often helpful to display the rows, 
columns, or even cells one at a time to keep the audience’s attention on the data you’re 
currently talking about. PowerPoint’s animations don’t work for rows, columns, or cells, so 
you need to take matters into your own hands. 
 Note   If you insert a chart as a picture, you can’t animate its components. 

593
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 Here are two approaches you can use:
  Create two or more separate tables : Create two or more separate tables 
and position them next to each other so that they appear to be a single 
table. You can then animate each of the tables separately, giving the 
effect of animating different parts of the same table. This approach 
sounds clumsy, but it’s easy to do, and it’s effective visually.  
  Hide parts of the table : Create a single table, and then cover those parts 
you want to hide with shapes (for example, rectangles) colored the same 
as the slide’s background. You can then reveal a hidden part of the table 
by running an Exit animation on the shape that’s covering it.  
 Keeping Extra Information up Your Sleeve with Hidden 
Slides 
 In many presentations, it’s useful to have extra information that you can summon up to deal 
with points you don’t want to cover unless the audience raises them. To meet this need, 
PowerPoint lets you hide any slide so that it doesn’t appear unless you specifically choose 
to display it. 
 To hide a slide, Ctrl-click or right-click the slide in the  Slides tab  of the Navigation pane or in 
Slide Sorter view, and then click Hide Slide on the context menu. You can also choose Slide 
Show ➤ Set Up ➤ Hide Slide from the Ribbon or Slide Show ➤ Hide Slide from the menu bar. 
 PowerPoint indicates a hidden slide by dimming it and showing a circle with a diagonal 
line (see Figure  20-11 ) in the Slides tab in Normal view and in the slides area in Slide Sorter 
view. On the Go to Slide menu in Slide Show view, a hidden slide appears with parentheses 
around its slide number.  
 Tip   Sometimes you may want to trigger each animation manually so that you can control the 
timing, but it can be handy to string other animations together so that when one animation ends, 
the next runs automatically. For example, when you click to display the next bullet point, you can 
make a picture appear automatically on the slide. To do this, select the animation you want to run 
automatically, and then choose Animations ➤ Timing ➤ Start ➤ After Previous from the Ribbon. If 
you want to run an animation simultaneously with the previous one, choose Animations ➤ Timing 
➤ Start ➤ With Previous from the Ribbon. 

594
CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 To change a slide back from hidden to normal, Ctrl-click or right-click the slide, and then 
click Hide Slide again, turning off the hiding; PowerPoint removes the check mark from the 
context menu. You can also choose Slide Show ➤ Set Up ➤ Hide Slide from the Ribbon or 
Slide Show ➤ Hide Slide from the menu bar.  
 Creating Custom Slide Shows Within a Presentation 
 Hidden slides can be great when you want to keep some information in reserve, but if you 
find yourself hiding many slides within a  presentation  , you may need to take the next step—
creating a custom slide show. 
 A custom slide show is an arrangement of slides within a presentation. You can choose 
which of the presentation’s slides to include in the custom show, and you can change 
the order in which they appear. You can create as many custom slide shows within a 
presentation as you need. 
 Figure 20-11.   In Slide Sorter view and on the Slides tab of the Navigation pane, a circle with a diagonal strikethrough 
(as in the upper-left corner of the upper-right slide here) indicates a hidden slide

 Opening the Custom Shows Dialog Box 
 To work with custom shows, first open the Custom  Shows dialog box  by choosing Slide 
Show ➤ Start Slide Show ➤ Custom Show ➤ Custom Slide Show from the Ribbon or Slide 
Show ➤ Custom Slide Show ➤ Custom Shows from the menu bar. Figure  20-12 shows the 
Custom Shows dialog box with three custom shows already created.  
 Creating a Custom Slide Show 
 To  create  a custom slide show, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create all the slides for the presentation or as many of the slides as 
you can create at this point. (You can add other slides later, but it’s 
easiest to start with all your slides if you’ve created them.)  
 2. 
 Choose Slide Show ➤ Start Slide Show ➤ Custom Show ➤ Custom 
Slide Show from the Ribbon or Slide Show ➤ Custom Slide Show 
➤ Custom Shows from the menu bar to display the Custom Shows 
dialog box.  
 3. 
 Click the New (+) button to display the Define Custom Show dialog 
box (shown in Figure  20-13 ).  
 Figure 20-12.   From the Custom Shows dialog box, you can create, launch, and manage custom slide shows within a 
presentation

 4. 
 In the Slide show name box, type the name you want to give the 
custom show. Make the name as descriptive as possible while 
keeping it short enough to fit fully in the Custom shows box in the 
Custom Shows dialog box—40 characters or so at most.  
 5. 
 In the “Slides in presentation” box, click each slide you want to add 
to the custom show, and then click the Add button.  
 6. 
 Once you’ve added the slides you want to the “Slides in custom 
show” box, rearrange them into the order needed. To move a slide up 
or down the order, click it, and then click the Up arrow button or the 
Down arrow button in the lower-right corner of the “Slides in custom 
show” box, as needed.  
 7. 
 When you’ve finished creating the custom show, click the OK button 
to close the Define Custom Show dialog box. PowerPoint returns you 
to the Custom Shows dialog box, where the Custom Shows list box 
includes the custom show you just created.  
 Tip  To create another show based on a custom show you’ve created, click the existing show in 
the Custom Shows dialog box, click the Action button (the gear icon), and then click Copy on the 
pop-up menu. PowerPoint creates a new custom show called  Copy of and the existing show’s 
name, such as  Copy of Brewery Introduction . With the copy still selected, click the Action button and 
then click Edit on the pop-up menu button to open the copy in the Define Custom Show dialog box. 
You can then rename the copy and change its contents.

CHAPTER 20: Adding Life and Interest to Your Presentation
 Playing a Custom Slide Show 
 After you’ve created a custom slide show, you can  play  it in either of these ways:
  Choose Slide Show ➤ Start Slide Show ➤ Custom Shows on the 
Ribbon, and then click the custom show’s name on the Custom Shows 
pop-up menu.  
  Open the Custom Shows dialog box, click the show in the Custom 
Shows list, and then click the Start Show button.  
 Editing or Deleting a Custom Slide Show 
 To  edit  a custom slide show, open the Custom Shows dialog box, click the custom show’s 
name in the Custom Shows list, click the Action button, and then click Edit on the pop-up 
menu. You can then use the Define Custom Show dialog box to change the selection of 
slides in the show or alter their order as needed. 
 To  delete  a custom show, click its name in the Custom Shows list in the Custom Shows 
dialog box, and then click the Remove (–) button. PowerPoint removes the show without 
confirmation.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you looked at how to add graphics, movies, and sounds to your slides. 
You also learned how to smooth or dramatize the switchover from one slide to another by 
choosing a suitable transition to introduce the next slide and how to bring the elements of a 
slide to life by applying animations and setting them to run the way you want. 
 You can now also hide slides that you want to keep in reserve and create custom slide 
shows consisting of only some of the slides from a presentation. 
 By now, you know how to put together a powerful and convincing presentation. The next 
stage is to deliver the presentation. You’ll learn how to do this in the next chapter.

 Chapter 21  
 Delivering a Presentation 
Live or Online 
 By this point, you’ve created a powerful and compelling presentation stuffed with great 
content. Now it’s time to deliver that presentation. 
 With PowerPoint, you can deliver a presentation in a handful of ways. The most 
straightforward way is by giving it live to your audience, showing the slides on a screen. This 
can be a challenge, but PowerPoint helps greatly by providing Presenter view, which puts 
your notes and essential controls where you can see them but the audience can’t. 
 To help your audience enjoy your presentation and retain its message, you can print a 
handout or create a PDF file for distribution. If you need to distribute a presentation rather 
than deliver it personally, you can record narration to fit the slides. 
 Later in the chapter, I’ll show you how to export and share your presentations. Apart from 
using means of sharing that you already know, such as e-mailing a presentation or saving a 
presentation to a SharePoint site or OneDrive, you can save the slides as a series of picture 
files that you can use separately. 
 I’ll start by going over how to prepare to deliver a presentation—setting up the display, 
arranging Presenter view, practicing your presentation, and (if you need to) recording 
automatic timings. 
 Getting Ready to Deliver a Presentation in Person 
 Before you deliver a presentation, you need to set up the Mac you’ll use with the projector 
or display on which you’ll show the presentation. You will likely want to use PowerPoint’s 
handy Presenter view if possible to keep your notes and controls on-screen. You will almost 
certainly want to practice your presentation before you actually have to give it. And you 
may want to record automatic timings for the slides so that the presentation automatically 
advances itself while you perform.  

600
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 Setting Up Your Display and Choosing the Resolution 
 Start by connecting your Mac to the display or projector on which you’ll give the 
presentation, and then get the displays set up. Here’s an example using a MacBook:  
 1. 
 Connect the display or projector to the MacBook’s external 
display port.   
 2. 
 Turn on the projector or display.  
 3. 
 Turn on the MacBook and log on.  
 4. 
 Choose Apple ➤ System Preferences to display the System 
Preferences window.  
 5. 
 Choose View ➤ Displays from the menu bar to switch to the Displays 
preferences pane. OS X shows two Displays windows: one for the 
MacBook on its screen and one for the projector or external display 
on the other screen.  
 6. 
 In the MacBook’s Displays window, click the Arrangement tab to 
display its contents (see Figure  21-1 ). 
 Note  Check the kind of connector cable you need to connect the projector or display to your 
Mac’s external display port. Most current Macs use a Thunderbolt port for output, while older Macs 
use a Mini DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI), or Mini-DVI port; some Macs also have a High-
Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port. The 12-inch MacBook has only a USB-C port, so you 
need to get Apple’s USB-C Digital Apple TV Multiport Adapter, which includes an HDMI port. Recent 
projectors use an HDMI port or DVI port, while many older projectors use a Video Graphics Array 
(VGA) port; current displays use Thunderbolt, Mini DisplayPort, DVI, or HDMI. Unless your Mac has 
the same connector type as the projector or display, you need a converter cable such as a Mini 
DisplayPort to HDMI converter. You can get these from the Apple Store (  http://store.apple.
com ) or other online or real-world computer stores. 
 Thunderbolt and Mini DisplayPort use the same size and shape of connector, but they have different 
capabilities. Thunderbolt is a multipurpose high-speed technology that includes graphical output 
capability, whereas Mini DisplayPort is for graphics only. So you can plug a Mini DisplayPort cable 
into a Mac’s Thunderbolt port and get graphical output, but you cannot plug a Thunderbolt cable 
into a Mini DisplayPort port and get the other Thunderbolt capabilities. 
 Note   If the Arrangement tab doesn’t appear in the Displays preferences pane, check the 
connection of the projector or external display and make sure it is receiving power. If the connection 
and power are okay, try restarting your Mac. 

601
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 7. 
 Drag the display icons to match how the displays are physically 
positioned. For example, if the projector will be projecting onto 
a screen that you’ll see over the top of your MacBook’s display, 
drag the icon for the projector so that it is above the icon for the 
MacBook’s display. Positioning the displays like this helps you avoid 
confusing them and enables you to move the pointer accurately from 
one display to the other.  
 8. 
 Make sure the Mirror Displays check box is cleared so that you can 
use Presenter view on the MacBook.  
 9. 
 If you need to change the resolution for the projector or external 
display, click the Displays window for that display. On the Display tab 
(see Figure  21-2 ), click the Scaled option button, and then choose the 
resolution in the resolutions list that appears. You can also change the 
rotation, the refresh rate, and the underscan setting if necessary.  
 Figure 21-1.   Start by setting up the projector or the external display in the Displays pane in System Preferences 
 

602
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 10. 
 When you’ve finished, click the Close button (the red button at the 
left end of the title bar) on one of the Displays windows or press 
Cmd+Q to quit System Preferences.  
 Using Presenter View 
 The  Presenter view  is perhaps PowerPoint’s biggest aid for giving an effective presentation. 
While the audience sees only the slide you’re currently displaying in Slide Show view, Presenter 
view (see Figure  21-3 ) shows your current slide, the next slide or object that will appear, and the 
slide’s notes. Normally, you use Presenter view on your laptop’s screen so you’re the only one 
who can see it; you show the slides for the audience on the projector or external monitor.  
 You can switch to Presenter view in any of these ways:
  Ribbon : Choose Slide Show ➤ Start Slide Show ➤ Presenter View.  
  Menu bar : Choose View ➤ Presenter View.  
  Keyboard : Press Option + Return.  
 Figure 21-2.   You can change the resolution for the projector or external display on the Display tab of the Displays window  
 

603
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 In Presenter view, you can take the following actions:
  View the current slide : The current slide appears on the left side of the 
window. 
  View the next slide or object : The next slide, or the next object that 
will appear on the current slide, appears in the upper-right corner of 
Presenter view.  
 Figure 21-3.   When giving a presentation, use Presenter view on a second screen to control the presentation, display 
your notes, and navigate quickly from slide to slide  
 

604
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  Consult your notes : The notes for the current slide appear in the Notes 
pane in the lower-right part of the window. You can click the Increase 
Font Size button or the Decrease Font Size button to adjust the text to a 
comfortable size for viewing.  
  Display another slide : Click the Next Slide button to move along to the 
next slide, or click the Previous Slide button to move back to the 
previous slide. To move in bigger steps, move the pointer over the 
current slide, making four tiny icons appear in its lower-left corner (you 
can see three of them in Figure  21-4 , but the fourth is obscured by the 
pop-up menu). Click the Control button to display the control menu, 
click or highlight By Title, and then click the slide you want on the 
submenu that appears (see Figure  21-4 ). You can also click Last Viewed 
on the control menu to jump back to the last slide viewed.  
  End the slide show : Click the End Show button. You can also press Esc.  
 Tip   To move to another slide that you identify visually, click the slide in the slide thumbnails bar at 
the bottom of Presenter view. 
 Note   If you don’t have a second monitor or projector for Presenter view, you need to fall back 
on traditional means of handling your notes—memorizing them, printing them on cards, or writing 
them on the palm of your hand or on your cuff. 
 Figure 21-4.   Use the control menu to navigate from slide to slide in the presentation

CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 Practicing Your Presentation 
 To make sure your presentation goes well on the day,  practice  it until you’re confident you 
know your material and you can speak fluently from the notes you’ve given yourself. If you 
find your notes need more detail, rearranging, or other improvements, work on them too. 
 Ideally, you will rehearse your presentation in the room in which you will deliver the 
presentation, using the same equipment. Sometimes you can do this; for example, if you’ll 
be speaking in your company or organization, you may be able to book the conference room 
for your run-through. But if you will deliver the presentation elsewhere, as is often the case, 
you will need to practice wherever you find most convenient—preferably somewhere you 
can speak aloud with interruption or drawing unwelcome attention. 
 To practice your presentation, use Presenter view (if you’ll use it during your presentation) or 
your notes. You may also want to set timings for slides, as discussed next.  
 Rehearsing Timings for Slides 
 For some presentations, you may need to set automatic timings for slides so that you don’t 
need to cue them manually. To set timings, use PowerPoint’s  Rehearse Timings  feature 
like this:
 1. 
 Choose Slide Show ➤ Set Up ➤ Rehearse Timings from the Ribbon 
or Slide Show ➤ Rehearse Timings from the menu bar. PowerPoint 
starts the slide show using Presenter view but displays a different 
timer near the top of the screen (see Figure  21-5 ). 
 2. 
 Go through your presentation, setting the timings like this:
  Display the next slide : Click the Next Slide button to display the next 
slide.  
  Pause and resume the timer : Click the Pause/Resume button on the 
timer to pause timing. Click the button again to restart timing.  
 Figure 21-5.   Use the controls on the timer to set automatic timings for slides or to control the recording of your 
narration  
 

606
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  View the time : The Current Slide readout on the timer displays how 
long the current slide has been displayed for. The Total readout on 
the timer shows how long the presentation has been running for.  
  Restart timing for the current slide : Click the Restart Slide Timing 
button to start recording the timing for the current slide again.  
 3. 
 When you finish going through the presentation, PowerPoint displays 
a dialog box (see Figure  21-6 ) giving the total show time and asking 
whether you want to apply the timings to the slide show.  
 4. 
 Click the Yes button to apply the timings to the slide show.  
 5. 
 Save the presentation. For example, click the Save button on the 
title bar.  
 Delivering a Presentation to a Live Audience 
 When you’re ready to deliver the  presentation live  (or when you’re practicing), use the 
commands and techniques explained in this section to start the presentation and display 
the slides. If necessary, you can annotate the presentation or display a black screen or white 
screen instead of your slides. You can also run the presentation from the keyboard rather 
than using the pointing device. 
 Starting a Presentation 
 When you’re ready to launch the presentation, choose Slide Show ➤ Start Slide Show ➤ 
Play from Start from the Ribbon or Slide Show ➤ Play from Start from the menu bar. You can 
also press Cmd+Shift+Return or click the Slide Show icon on the status bar. 
 If you need to start from a slide other than the first, select that slide, and then choose Slide 
Show ➤  Start Slide Show  ➤ Play from Current Slide from the Ribbon or Slide Show ➤ Play 
from Current Slide from the menu bar. You can also press Cmd+Return to start from the 
current slide.  
 Figure 21-6.   Click the Yes button in this dialog box to apply the timings you’ve recorded to the slide show 
 

607
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 Displaying the Slides You Need 
 To give the presentation smoothly and effectively, you need to  display slides  in the order 
you want. The most straightforward way is to start at the beginning of the presentation and 
run straight through to the end, but in many cases, you may need to change the order. For 
example, you may need to go back to an earlier slide, skip ahead to a particular slide by 
name or number, or display a hidden slide. 
 PowerPoint provides plenty of different ways to move from slide to slide. The following ways 
tend to be the most convenient:
  Run the next animation or display the next slide : Click the button on your 
pointing device or press the spacebar.  
  Return to the previous slide : Press P or click the Previous button in 
Presenter view.  
  Go to a slide by name or number : Ctrl-click or right-click the current 
slide, click or highlight Go to Slide on the context menu (see Figure  21-7 ), 
and then click the slide on the submenu. PowerPoint truncates long slide 
names, but it’s usually easy enough to identify the slides.  
 Note  You can also move forward or back by holding the pointer over the lower-left corner of the 
slide and then clicking the Next button or the Previous button on the row of controls that appears. 
 Tip  In Presenter view, you can use the control menu for quick navigation. Move the pointer over 
the current slide, click the control icon to display the control menu, and then use its commands to 
navigate. Look back to Figure  21-4 for an example of navigating with the control menu. 
 Note   Parentheses around a slide’s number on the Go to Slide submenu indicate that the slide is 
hidden. 

608
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  Return to the last slide viewed : Ctrl-click or right-click the current slide, 
and then click Last Viewed on the context menu.  
 Annotating the Slides 
 Sometimes you may want to  annotate  a presentation to make sure your audience grasps 
your most important points. PowerPoint gives you the following choices on the Pointer 
Options submenu of the context menu:
  Automatic : Choose this item to let PowerPoint change the pointer 
automatically depending on where you move it.  
  Hidden : Choose this item when you want to hide the pointer, so that it 
doesn’t distract the audience.  
  Arrow : Choose this item when you want to restore the pointer to its 
normal arrow so that you can point to items on slides.  
  Pen : Choose this item when you want to write or draw on a slide. 
Figure  21-8 shows an example.  
 Figure 21-7.   The context menu for a presentation includes commands for going quickly to a different slide by name or 
number, returning to the last slide viewed, or switching to a custom show 
 

609
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  Pen Color : From this submenu, choose the pen color you want, such 
as red.  
 Controlling a Presentation Using the Keyboard 
 If you’re at your Mac when you’re giving the presentation, you can control the presentation 
by using  keyboard shortcuts  . Table  21-1 explains the keyboard shortcuts you can use; you’ll 
find the most useful ones explained elsewhere in the text as well. Several of the actions have 
two or more keyboard shortcuts. Each works the same; the one I listed first is usually the 
easiest, but try them all, and use whichever you find most convenient. 
 Table 21-1.   Keyboard Shortcuts for Running a Presentation

a white screen or a black screen (whichever best suits the lighting conditions under which 
you’re giving the presentation). To do so, open the context menu, and then choose Screen ➤ 
Black Screen or Screen ➤ White Screen, as needed. 
 Press Esc or click to go back from the black screen or white  screen  to the slides.  
 Creating a Handout for a Presentation 
 When you’re delivering a presentation live, it’s often useful to create a  handout  that provides 
your audience with material to browse before you start, to scribble notes on as you proceed, 
and to take home for further reference afterward. 
 To create a handout, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the presentation if it’s not already open.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Print or press Cmd+P to display the Print dialog box.  
 3. 
 If the Print dialog box opens at its smaller size, click the Show Details 
button to expand it.  
 4. 
 Make sure that the PowerPoint item is selected in the unnamed pop-
up menu, below the Paper Size pop-up menu and between the upper 
section and lower section of the Print dialog box. If not, open this 
pop-up menu and click the PowerPoint item in it.  
 5. 
 Open the Layout pop-up menu, and choose the Handouts item you 
want: Handouts (2 slides per page), Handouts (3 slides per page), 
Handouts (4 slides per page), Handouts (6 slides per page), or 
Handouts (9 slides per page). PowerPoint displays a quick preview 
on the left side of the Print dialog box (see Figure  21-9 ).  
 Table 21-1.  (continued )

611
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 6. 
 In the Slides area, choose which slides to print handouts for:
  Print handouts for all slides : Select the All option button.  
  Print handouts for a range of slides : Select the From option button, 
and type the starting number in the text box next to it. Type the 
ending number in the To text box. 
 Note If you need to print a handout for only some of the slides in a presentation but those slides 
aren’t in sequence, select those slides before opening the Print dialog box. You can then select the 
Selected Slides option button in the Slides area to print handouts for only those slides.
 Tip  If you want your audience to be able to take notes easily, choose Handouts (3 slides per 
page). This layout puts the three slides in a vertical stack on the left side of the page, with a lined 
area to the right of each slide for taking notes, as you can see in the preview in Figure  21-9 . 
 Figure 21-9.   In the Print dialog box, choose the layout and content you want for your handout 
 

612
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  Print handouts for slides you identify by number : Select the 
Custom Range option button and type the slide numbers in the 
box separated by commas, using a hyphen to denote a range. For 
example, you could enter 1, 3-5, 7, 10.  
  Print handouts for a custom show : Select the custom show by its 
name in the Custom Shows pop-up menu.  
 7. 
 In the Output pop-up menu, choose the kind of output for the 
handouts: Color, Grayscale, or Black and White.  
 8. 
 Select the “Scale to fit paper” check box if you want PowerPoint to 
resize the slides to fit the paper better. The preview shows you the 
effect of this change so you can tell whether it will be helpful.  
 9. 
 Select the Print hidden slides check box if you want to include 
hidden slides in the handout. If the selection or presentation contains 
no hidden slides, this check box is unavailable.  
 10. 
 Select the Frame slides check box if you want PowerPoint to put 
a frame around each slide. This is useful if the slides use a light-
colored or white background that will disappear on the printout 
without a frame.  
 11. 
 To include a header or footer in the handout, click the Header/Footer 
button to display the Header and Footer dialog box. Click the Notes 
& Handouts tab button to display the Notes & Handouts pane (see 
Figure  21-10 ), specify the details of the header and footer you want, 
and then click the Apply to All button.

 If you want to print the handouts, click the Print button. If you want 
to create a PDF file that you can then print from another computer (or 
distribute as a PDF), click the PDF pop-up button, and choose click 
Save as PDF. In the Save dialog box, specify the file name and folder 
for the PDF, and then click the Save button.  
 Recording Narration into a Presentation 
 When you can’t deliver a presentation in person, you can record your  narration  for the 
presentation and create a file that your audience can play back. This is great for creating a 
presentation that you will share on the Web or on a CD or DVD. 
 Figure 21-10.   On the Notes & Handouts tab of the Header and Footer dialog box, set up the header and footer you want 
for the handout 
 

614
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 Unless you’re a pro at speaking off the cuff or you can already deliver this presentation in 
your sleep from relentless practice, you may want to write a script of what you’ll say. Having 
a script helps you avoid the pauses that pass unnoticed in a live presentation but stick out 
uncomfortably in a recorded presentation. When using a script, avoid the trap of lapsing into 
a monotone—deliver your lines with all the life and conviction you’d give to a live audience. 
 To record a presentation, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Set up your microphone and check that it’s working. What you need 
to do depends on your setup, but these steps are typical:
  Choose Apple ➤ System Preferences from the menu bar to open 
the System Preferences window.  
  Choose View ➤ Sound from the menu bar to display the Sound 
preferences pane.  
  Click the Input tab if it’s not already displayed.  
  Make sure the right microphone or input is selected in the “Select a 
device for sound input” list box.  
  Speak into the microphone, and make sure the Input level meter 
shows a suitable level. If not, drag the Input volume slider to set the 
input volume.  
  Select the “Use ambient noise reduction” check box if you want the 
Mac to try to tune out as much ambient noise as possible.  
  Click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) 
or choose System Preferences ➤ Quit System Preferences to close 
the System Preferences window and quit System Preferences.  
 2. 
 In PowerPoint, select the slide from which you want to start 
recording. For example, if you want to start recording from the 
beginning, click the first slide.  
 3. 
 Choose Slide Show ➤ Set Up ➤ Record Slide Show from the Ribbon 
or Slide Show ➤ Record Slide Show from the menu bar. PowerPoint 
switches to Presenter view, displays the slide you chose, and starts 
recording your audio and the timings for moving from slide to slide 
and from animation to animation.  
 4. 
 Speak your narration for the presentation, advancing the slides and 
animations as needed.  
 Note   To record narration, you need a suitable microphone. In a pinch, you can use the microphone 
built into your MacBook or iMac, but such a microphone will usually pick up ambient noise (even 
if you use PowerPoint’s noise-cancellation feature). Usually, you’re better off using a microphone 
that you can position freely, such as a handheld microphone or one on a stand, and best off with a 
noise-canceling microphone mounted on a headset.

CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
 5. 
 When you reach the end of the presentation, PowerPoint 
automatically stops recording the narration and prompts you to save 
your timings. Click the Yes button.  
 Exporting and Sharing a Presentation 
 Apart from delivering a presentation in person, PowerPoint gives you several ways to get the 
presentation to other people across the Internet:  
  Send the presentation via e-mail : The most direct way to get a 
presentation to somebody else is to e-mail it to them, as discussed 
in Chapter   2 . E-mail works well for small presentations, but many 
presentation files are too large for mail servers to handle. In this case, 
you need to use a different means of distribution.  
  Save the presentation to OneDrive : You can save the presentation to 
a shared folder on OneDrive, as discussed in Chapter   2 . Anyone with 
permission to view the folder can then download the presentation and view 
it. This is an effective way to distribute presentations across the Internet.  
  Save the presentation to a SharePoint site : If you have a SharePoint site, 
you can save the presentation to it. Anyone with permission to view the 
folder on the SharePoint site can then view the presentation. In many 
cases, this is the best way to distribute a presentation within a company 
or organization that uses SharePoint.  
  Save the presentation as pictures : If you need to share the presentation 
with extra comments on a web page or send individual slides to people, 
you can save it as pictures. When you do this, you lose the transitions 
and animations so make sure that the slides don’t rely on them.  
 To  save  a presentation as picture files, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the presentation if it’s not already open.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Export from the menu bar. PowerPoint displays the Export 
dialog box and selects the JPEG item in the File Format pop-up menu.  
 3. 
 If you want, change to a different picture format by opening the File 
Format pop-up menu and making the appropriate choice:
  JPEG :  Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)  files are widely 
used for everything from digital photography to web pages. JPEG 
files use  lossy compression—the app that creates a JPEG file 
discards some of the image data to make the file smaller—so they’re 
not full quality.  
 Note   If you need to pause the recording, click the Pause/Resume button on the timer; click this 
button again when you’re ready to resume. If you need to start over for the current slide, click the 
Restart Slide Timing button in the lower-left corner of the timer. 

616
CHAPTER 21: Delivering a Presentation Live or Online 
  TIFF :  Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)  files are full quality and are 
widely used in publishing, but they’re less good for web pages than 
PNG. TIFF files usually have a larger file size than JPEG files.  
  PNG :  Portable Network Graphics (PNG)  files are full quality and have 
relatively small file sizes. PNG files are a good choice for most uses.  
  GIF :  Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)  is an old file format that 
uses only 256 colors. GIF files are small, but you lose so much 
quality that the trade-off is seldom worthwhile.  
  BMP : Windows  Bitmap (BMP)  format retains full quality at the 
expense of a large file size. PNG is usually a better choice.  
  PDF : The Portable Document  Format  is extremely widely used 
and is viewable on most computers and devices. Even so, PNG is 
usually a better choice.  
 4. 
 Below the File Format pop-up menu, select the Save Every Slide 
option button if you want to save every slide as a picture. The 
alternative is to select the Save Current Slide Only option button, 
creating a picture file of the current slide.  
 5. 
 In the Export As text box, type the name of the folder you want 
PowerPoint to create and put the files in.  
 6. 
 If you want to put the new folder in a different folder than the current 
folder, navigate to the folder you want.  
 7. 
 Click the Save button. PowerPoint exports the slides as pictures, 
naming them Slide01, Slide02, and so on. It then displays a dialog 
box telling you which folder to find the files in.  
 8. 
 Click the OK button. You can now distribute the presentation by 
zipping the folder and sending it via e-mail or by posting slides on 
your web site.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to deliver a PowerPoint presentation to a live audience in 
person or to a wider audience by using other means. You now know how to prepare for the 
presentation by setting up your displays and using Presenter view, and you can record either 
timings or full-on narration for the presentation’s slides. You can also create a handout for 
your audience and export slides to pictures to use in a slide library for your colleagues. 
 At this point, you’re good to go with PowerPoint. In the next chapter, you’ll start exploring 
Outlook, Office’s powerful app for managing e-mail, your schedule, and more.

 Chapter 22  
 Using E-mail Effectively 
 In this part of the book, you’ll learn how to use  Outlook  , Office’s heavy-duty e-mail and 
organizer app. 
 Outlook covers five main areas:
  Mail : Outlook calls it Mail, but most of us call it e-mail—and it’s the most 
important part of Outlook. This chapter covers e-mail.  
  People : Outlook provides a digital address book on steroids for storing 
the details of your contacts and keeping in touch with them. Chapter   23 
explains how to work with contacts in Outlook.  
  Calendar : Outlook can help you keep tabs on your appointments, 
whether they occur once only or at regular intervals. Chapter   24 shows 
you how to manage your calendar with Outlook.  
  Tasks : Outlook provides a robust task list that you can use not only 
to track your own commitments but also to offload them onto your 
colleagues. Chapter   25 teaches you how to organize your life with tasks.  
  Notes : Outlook provides a straightforward notes capability that you can 
use for quickly storing information. Chapter   25 shows you how to work 
with notes in Outlook.  
 So in this chapter, you’ll learn how to use Outlook to send and receive e-mail and 
attachments. 
 You’ll start by setting up Outlook to work with your e-mail account (or accounts). You’ll 
then take a tour of the Outlook interface because Outlook packs a host of controls into its 
window in order to handle all of its different roles and tasks. 
 Once you know what’s what, I’ll show you how to send and receive messages and 
attachments; reply to messages and forward them to others; and delete the messages you 
don’t want to keep and file those you do. Then you’ll learn how to quickly add standard 
closings to your messages by creating and using signatures. Finally, you’ll learn how to deal 
with spam, or unwanted e-mail. 

620
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Setting Up Outlook 
 First, you need to set up Outlook to work with your e-mail account. To do this, you need to 
know your e-mail address and password. You may also need to know which types of mail 
servers your ISP uses and their addresses. 
 If you have your e-mail accounts set up with a different e-mail app already, you can import 
the accounts into Outlook. You can also choose whether to use Outlook as your primary 
e-mail app or stick with the app you’re currently using. 
 Launching Outlook 
 Start by launching Outlook. The easiest way to  launch Outlook  is to click the Microsoft Outlook 
icon on the Dock. If there’s no Microsoft Outlook icon on the Dock, click the Launchpad icon 
on the Dock, and then click the Microsoft Outlook icon on the Launchpad screen. 
 Going Through the Welcome to Outlook Routine 
 If this is the first time you’ve run Outlook, the app displays the Welcome to Outlook window. 
Click the Next (>) button to move through the screens that introduce the app’s main features, 
and then click the Get Started button. On the You’re All Set screen, click the Start Using 
Outlook button. The Set up my Inbox screen then appears (see Figure  22-1 ). 
 Note  If you’ve set up Outlook already, go to the “Meeting the Outlook Interface” section. 
 Tip   If you find Outlook vital to your computing life, add the Microsoft Outlook icon to the Dock. 
After you’ve launched Outlook, Ctrl-click or right-click the Outlook icon on the Dock, and then 
choose Options ➤ Keep in Dock from the context menu. If you want Outlook to start automatically 
each time you log in, Ctrl-click or right-click the Outlook icon on the Dock, and then choose Options 
➤ Open at Login, placing a check mark next to this item. 

621
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Adding an E-mail Account to Outlook 
 You can start the process of adding an e-mail account to Outlook in either of these ways:
  From the Set up my Inbox screen : Click the Add Account button.  
  Anytime thereafter : Choose Tools ➤ Accounts from the menu bar.  
 When you take either of these actions, Outlook displays the Accounts pane in the Outlook 
Preferences window (see Figure  22-2 ). 
 Figure 22-1.   If you haven’t yet set up your e-mail account in Outlook, click the  Add Account button on the Set up my 
Inbox screen 
 

622
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 From here, you can add a Microsoft Exchange or Office 365 account, an Outlook.com 
account, or a regular type of e-mail account (IMAP or POP). I’ll start with regular accounts, 
move on to Outlook.com accounts, and then look at Exchange and Office 365 accounts. 
 Note  The main difference between an IMAP account and a POP account is that an IMAP account 
stores your messages on the mail server, while with a POP account your e-mail app (for example, 
Outlook) keeps your messages on your computer. IMAP is good for when you need to check your e-mail 
from multiple computers because you see the same inbox and folders from each computer as a result 
of the folders being on the server. POP usually gives better performance if you use a single computer. 
 To set up an e-mail account, you need to provide various pieces of information. At the very least, you 
need to know the e-mail address and password; often, you need to know the e-mail account type as 
well, and you may need to know the addresses of the incoming server and the outgoing server. You 
normally get this information from your e-mail provider. 
 Figure 22-2.   From the Accounts pane in the  Outlook Preferences window , you can add an Exchange or Office 365 
account, an Outlook.com account, or another type of e-mail account  
 

623
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Adding an IMAP or POP E-mail Account to Outlook 
 If you have an IMAP or POP e-mail account, follow these steps to add the account to Outlook:
 1. 
 In the Accounts pane of the Outlook Preferences window, click the 
Other Email button to display the  “Enter your account information” 
dialog box  (see Figure  22-3 ). 
 2. 
 Type your e-mail address in the E-mail address text box.  
 3. 
 Type your password in the Password text box.  
 4. 
 For most accounts, you can simply select the Configure 
automatically check box and click the Add Account button to have 
Outlook take care of the configuration details for you. But if you need 
to enter the details manually, clear the Configure automatically check 
box. Outlook expands the “Enter your account information” dialog 
box to show the remaining controls (see Figure  22-4 ). 
 Figure 22-3.   In the “Enter your account information” dialog box, you can set up most IMAP and POP accounts by 
entering just your e-mail address and password 
 

624
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 5. 
 Change the default  settings  as needed:
  User name : In this text box, type the user name for the e-mail account.  
  Type : In this pop-up menu, choose IMAP or POP. If you’re not sure which type 
your e-mail account is, contact your e-mail provider.  
  Incoming server : In the left text box, type the name of the incoming mail 
server.  
  Override default port : Select this check box if your e-mail provider has told 
you to use a specific port for the incoming mail server. Type the port number 
in the right text box on the Incoming server line.  
  Use SSL to connect : Select this check box if your e-mail provider provides 
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  connections and you want to use a secure 
connection for incoming mail.  
  Outgoing server : In the left text box, type the name of the outgoing mail 
server.  
  Override default port : Select this check box if your e-mail provider has told 
you to use a specific port for the outgoing mail server. Type the port number in 
the right text box on the Outgoing server line.  
  Use SSL to connect : Select this check box if your e-mail provider provides 
SSL connections and you want to use a secure connection for outgoing mail.  
 Figure 22-4.   If you need to configure e-mail account settings manually, clear the  Configure automatically check box , 
and then work with the extra controls that the “Enter your account information” dialog box displays  
 

625
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 6. 
 Click the  Add Account button  . Outlook adds the account and 
displays it in the Accounts pane (see Figure  22-5 ). 
 7. 
 Change any of the settings needed. These are the settings you’re 
most likely to need to change here:
  Account description : Type the name you want Outlook to show for the 
account rather than the generic name that Outlook chose. 
 Note In the Accounts pane of the Outlook Preferences window, you can change many of the 
same settings as in the expanded version of the “Enter your account information” dialog box. For 
example, you can enter the name of the incoming mail server or outgoing mail server, override the 
default mail port on the server, and use SSL to connect.
 Figure 22-5.   After you have added the account, it appears in the Accounts pane. You can change further settings if 
necessary  
 

626
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
  Full name : Type your name the way you want Outlook to use it, such as Jack 
Frederickson or John T. Frederickson.  
 8. 
 If you need to use different credentials for connecting to the outgoing 
mail server than for connecting to the incoming mail server, click the 
More Options button to display the Settings dialog box shown in 
Figure  22-6 . 
  Open the Authentication pop-up menu, and choose User Name and 
Password instead of the default setting, Use Incoming Server Info.  
  Type your user name in the User Name text box and your password in 
the Password text box.  
  If the mail server requires you to enter an unqualified domain name, type 
it in the Unqualified domain box.  
  Click the OK button to close the Settings dialog box and return to the 
Accounts pane.  
 If you need to set up another e-mail account, click the Add (+) button in the lower-left corner of 
the Accounts pane, and then click the Exchange item, the Outlook.com item, or the Other Email 
item on the pop-up menu, depending on the type of account. Outlook displays the “Enter your 
account information” dialog box, and you can enter the information as discussed in this section. 
 When you have finished setting up accounts, click the  Close button  (the red button at the 
left end of the title bar) to close the Preferences window. You’ll then see the main Outlook 
window, usually with the Inbox displayed. Go on to the “Meeting the Outlook Interface” 
section later in this chapter.  
 Figure 22-6.   Use the  Settings dialog box when you need to provide different credentials for connecting to the outgoing 
mail server than for connecting to the incoming mail server 
 

627
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Adding an Outlook.com Account to Outlook 
 If you have an  Outlook.com account  (such as an account with an outlook.com address or a 
hotmail.com address), you can quickly add it to Outlook. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Outlook.com button in the Accounts pane to display 
the “Enter your Microsoft account information” dialog box 
(see Figure  22-7 ).  
 2. 
 Type your e-mail address in the E-mail address box.  
 3. 
 Type your password in the Password box.  
  4.   Click the Add Account button. Outlook sets up the account, and it 
appears in the Accounts pane.  
 Adding a Microsoft Exchange Account or Office 365 Account to Outlook 
 Microsoft  Exchange  is a mail server used by many corporations and organizations.  Office 
365 is an Office-based online service that Microsoft provides. 
 To add a Microsoft Exchange account or Office 365 account to Outlook, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click the Exchange or Office 365 button in the Accounts pane to 
display the “Enter your Exchange account information” dialog box 
(see Figure  22-8 ).  
 Figure 22-7.   In the “Enter your Microsoft account information” dialog box, type your e-mail address and password, and 
then click the Add Account button 
 

628
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 2. 
 In the E-mail address text box, type your full e-mail address.  
 3. 
 In the Method pop-up menu, choose your authentication method:
  User Name and Password : This is the normal choice for most networks. Type 
your domain and user name (for example,  CORP\agreen ) in the User name text 
box and your password in the Password text box.  
  Kerberos : If your network uses Kerberos for authentication, select Kerberos 
in the Method pop-up menu, and then open the Kerberos ID pop-up menu 
(which appears below the Method pop-up menu) and click the Kerberos ID. If 
Outlook prompts you for your password, type it and click the OK button.  
  Client Certificate Authentication : If you need to use a digital certificate for 
authentication, select Client Certificate Authentication in the Method pop-up 
menu. Then open the Certificate pop-up menu (which appears below the 
Method pop-up menu) and click the appropriate certificate.  
 4. 
 Make sure the Configure automatically check box is selected.  
 5. 
 Click the Add Account button. Outlook adds the account.  
 Note   If you’re not sure which setting to choose in the Method pop-up menu, ask your network 
administrator. 
 Note   If your network administrator tells you to enter the server name for the Exchange account, 
clear the Configure automatically check box. The “Enter your Exchange account information” dialog 
box then displays a Server text box above the two buttons. Type the server’s address in this text box. 
 Figure 22-8.   In the “Enter your Exchange account information” dialog box, type your e-mail address and enter your 
authentication details for Exchange 
 

629
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Importing an Existing E-mail Account 
 Outlook 2016 also enables you to import your existing e-mail account  data . This can be from 
your existing installation of Outlook 2011 on your Mac, from an Outlook for Windows archive 
file, or from an Outlook for Mac archive file. 
 To start importing data, click the Import button on the Set up my Inbox screen or choose 
File ➤ Import from the menu bar. Either of these commands displays the Import dialog box 
(see Figure  22-9 ). 
 Select the Outlook for Windows archive file option button, the Outlook for Mac archive file 
option button, or the Outlook 2011 data on this computer option button, as appropriate. 
Click the Continue button, and then follow the prompts in the dialog box that opens. For the 
first two options, you select the appropriate archive file; for the third option, you select the 
appropriate identity from your collection of Office 2011 identities.  
 Note   An Outlook for Windows archive file uses the Personal Folders File format with the  .pst file 
extension. An Outlook for Mac archive file uses the Outlook For Mac Data File format with the  .olm 
file extension. 
 Figure 22-9.   Outlook’s Import feature enables you to import data from an Outlook for Windows archive file, an Outlook 
for Mac archive file, or your existing installation of Outlook 2011 
 

630
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Meeting the Outlook Interface 
 When Outlook opens, you’ll see a window such as Figure  22-10 . Outlook normally displays 
your Inbox at first, on the basis that you want to start by checking your e-mail. If Outlook is 
displaying a different item, click the Mail button in the Navigation pane, and then click the 
Inbox item in the Folder pane.  
 Figure 22-10.    Outlook’s interface uses many different  components   to provide access to your information and its 
features       
 

631
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 The following sections explain how to use the main components of the Outlook interface—
and how to change those you’re most likely to want to change. 
 Using the Quick Access Toolbar, Ribbon, and Menu Bar 
 Like the other Office apps, Outlook uses three main means of control: the Quick Access 
Toolbar on the title bar, the Ribbon below the title bar, and the menu bar across the top of 
the Mac’s display (or primary display if it has more than one). 
 At this writing, the  Quick Access Toolbar  in the main Outlook window contains only the Undo 
button, the Redo/Repeat button, and the Print button, and is not customizable. When you 
open an item window, the Quick Access Toolbar also has a Save button for saving changes 
to the item. 
 The Ribbon for the main Outlook window contains three tabs: the Home tab, the Organize 
tab, and the Tools tab. Unlike in the other Office apps, Outlook’s Ribbon doesn’t divide 
each tab into groups; instead, it has the controls (for example, buttons and pop-up menus) 
directly on the Ribbon. The contents of the Home tab and the Organize tab change to suit 
the category of items you’re working with; for example, the Home tab contains different 
controls when you’re working with Mail than when you’re working with the Calendar. The 
contents of the Tools tab remain the same. 
 The menu bar provides access to commands as normal.  
 Using the Navigation Pane 
 The  Navigation pane  is a shallow pane that gives you quick access to Outlook’s five main 
aspects: Mail, Calendar, People, Tasks, and Notes. The Navigation pane can appear either 
expanded, as a separate pane that extends across the full window of the Outlook window 
and contains text buttons, as in Figure  22-10 ; or collapsed, as a part of the Folder pane 
with graphical buttons (see Figure  22-11 ). To collapse the Navigation pane, you click the 
➤ button at its right end; to expand the Navigation pane again, you click the ➤ button that 
replaces the ➤ button.  
 Note   This chapter introduces you to the Mail aspect of Outlook’s interface. The following chapters 
show you how to use the Calendar aspect, the Contacts aspect, the Tasks aspect, and the Notes aspect. 

632
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Using the Folder Pane 
 The  Folder pane  appears on the left side of the Outlook window by default. You use this 
pane to navigate among different items in the category you’ve selected in the Navigation 
pane. For example, after you select Mail in the Navigation pane, the Folder pane displays 
your mail folders, and you can click the folder whose contents you want to view. 
 You can change the width of the Folder pane by moving the pointer over its right edge, so 
that the pointer changes to a two-headed arrow, and then dragging to the left or right. 
 When you don’t need the Folder pane, you can hide it by choosing View ➤ Folder Pane from 
the menu bar, removing the check mark from the Folder pane item on the menu. Give the 
same command again when you need the Folder pane once more.  
 Figure 22-11.   You can collapse the Navigation pane to an icon-based bar at the bottom of the Folder pane. Click the ➤ 
button when you want to expand the Navigation pane again  
 Tip   You can switch quickly among Outlook’s areas by using keyboard shortcuts. Press Cmd+1 to 
display Mail, Cmd+2 to display Calendar, Cmd+3 to display Contacts, Cmd+4 to display Tasks, or 
Cmd+5 to display Notes. 
 

633
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Using and Customizing the Message List and Reading Pane 
 To the right of the Folder pane is the Message List, which shows the messages in the 
selected mailbox (for example, the Inbox). To the right of the Message List is the Reading 
pane, which shows the contents of the selected message (or part of the contents). To view a 
message in the Reading pane, click it in the Message List. 
 Arranging and Sorting the  Message List  
 To enable you to quickly find and read the messages you need, Outlook lets you sort the 
Message List in several different ways. This section runs through the main ways of sorting 
the Message List, but you will want to spend some time experimenting with the various 
options to see which types of sorting you find most helpful for the tasks you perform with 
e-mail and the ways you prefer to approach them. 
 The easiest way to set up the Message List is to use the By pop-up menu at the top of the 
Message List (see Figure  22-12 ). You can also use the View ➤ Arrange By submenu on the 
menu bar. 
 Note   Outlook provides the Reading pane to help you plow through your messages quickly. 
But you can also open a message in a separate window if you prefer. To do so, double-click the 
message in the Message List. Opening a message in a separate window is useful when you need to 
compare the contents of two or more messages at once. 
 Figure 22-12.   Use the By pop-up menu at the top of the Message List to set up the Message List the way you want it. 
Start by choosing the overall sort order in the top part of the list, such as by Conversations or by Date Received  
 

634
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 In the By pop-up menu, choose from the following arrangement settings:
  Attachments : Sorts the items into a Has Attachments group and a No 
Attachments group. This setting is good for locating messages with 
attachments that you need to deal with.  
  Categories : Sorts the items into the categories you’ve applied, such 
as Manager, Team, and Junk. You can customize the categories that 
Outlook uses.  
  Conversations : Sorts the items into conversations by date. (You’ll learn 
about conversations shortly.)  
  Date Received : Sorts the items by the date and time Outlook received 
them. 
  Date Sent : Sorts the items by the date and time the messages indicate 
they were sent.  
  Flag Status : Sorts the items into a Flagged group and a No Flag group 
by the flags you’ve applied to them. (For example, you can flag a 
message for follow-up tomorrow.)  
  Folder : Sorts the items by the folders that contain them. If you’re looking 
at your Inbox, sorting by folders isn’t helpful, but if you’ve searched and 
found messages in various folders, sorting can be useful.  
  From : Sorts the items by the sender. This setting is good for locating 
messages from important people.  
  Priority : Sorts the items by their Importance tag into High, Normal, and 
Low groups; items deemed junk go into a Junk group below the Low 
group. This setting can be useful if your colleagues use the Importance 
tag sensibly and consistently, but you may find so many people give 
their messages High priority that the result is meaningless. What you 
may find more useful is to set the priority on messages you receive; for 
example, assigning High priority to those from your boss.  
  Size : Sorts the items by their size. This setting is handy for quickly locating 
messages with large attachments. You can also use the Attachments 
setting (discussed earlier) to locate all messages with attachments.  
  Status : Sorts the items into groups including Unread, Sent or Read, 
Replied To, and Calendar.  
  Subject : Sorts the items by their subject lines. This setting is useful for 
locating an item whose subject line you can remember but whose other 
details you can’t. (You can also search for the item, as described shortly.)  
  To : Sorts the items by the recipient’s name or e-mail address. This 
setting is useful if you have Outlook checking different e-mail accounts 
because it lets you separate the messages by account. Items sent to 
you by name (for example, Chris Smith) appear separately from those 
sent to the e-mail address.  

635
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Changing the Sort Order 
 Within each arrangement, you can change the sort  order  by clicking the By pop-up menu 
in the Message List and then clicking the order you want. For example, if you sort by Date 
Received, you can choose between Newest on Top and Oldest on Top; if you sort by 
Subject, you can choose between A on Top and Z on Top; and if you sort by Attachments, 
you can choose between With on Top and None on Top. 
 You can quickly reverse the sort order by clicking the Down arrow or Up arrow to the right of 
the By pop-up menu at the top of the Message List.  
 Choosing Whether to  Group Items  
 For each arrangement, you can choose whether to show the items in groups or as a series. 
The groups vary depending on the arrangement. For example, when you sort by Date, 
Outlook uses groups such as Today, Yesterday, Last Week, and Last Month; when you sort 
by From, the groups are the senders (by name when it appears and by e-mail address when 
it doesn’t); and when you sort by Size, the groups are Small, Medium, Huge, and Enormous. 
 To choose whether to group items, open the By pop-up menu, and then click the Show in 
Groups item. If a check mark appears next to Show in Groups, grouping is on, and you click 
to turn it off; otherwise, click to place the check mark and turn grouping on.  
 Viewing Conversations 
 If you use e-mail to discuss topics with your colleagues, you probably get back-and-forth 
exchanges of messages about many topics. To view these exchanges easily, open the 
By pop-up menu at the top of the Message List and click Conversations to arrange the 
messages by conversations. 
 When you do this, Outlook presents each exchange of e-mail messages as a separate 
section, enabling you to see the sequence of messages clearly and to determine who said 
what when without having to trawl through your Inbox and other mail folders. You can 
expand a conversation by clicking the horizontal gray disclosure triangle to its left, or you 
can collapse a conversation by clicking the downward gray disclosure triangle. Figure  22-13 
shows a  conversation  . 

636
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Using and Customizing the Reading Pane 
 When you click a message in the Message List, Outlook displays the message’s contents in 
the  Reading pane  so that you can read it. 
 At first, Outlook displays the Reading pane to the right of the Message List. If you prefer, you 
can position the Reading pane below the Message List by choosing Organize ➤ Reading 
Pane ➤ Bottom from the Ribbon. Figure  22-14 shows this arrangement. (To put it back, 
choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Right from the Ribbon.) You may prefer this layout 
because it gives you a better view of the Message List (but not as much of it).  
 Figure 22-13.   When you need to see the sequence of an e-mail exchange, display the messages in conversations 
 

637
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 You can also control the Reading pane from the menu bar or keyboard: choose View ➤ 
Reading Pane ➤ Right from the menu bar or press Cmd+\ to place the Reading pane on the 
right; choose View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Below from the menu bar or press Cmd+Shift+\ to 
place the Reading pane at the bottom; or choose View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Hidden from the 
menu bar or press Cmd+Option+\ to hide the Reading pane. 
 Tip  If your Mac has a small screen or if you need more space for the Message List, you may 
prefer to hide the Reading pane and read messages in a separate window instead. To hide the 
Reading pane, choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Off from the Ribbon or View ➤ Reading Pane 
➤ Hidden from the menu bar. To read a message in a separate window, double-click the message 
in the Message List. 
 Figure 22-14.   Positioning the Reading pane below the Message List can make the Message List easier to navigate 
 

638
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 To control how Outlook interprets your opening a message in the Reading pane, follow these 
steps:
 1. 
 Choose Outlook ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the 
comma key) to display the Outlook Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the E-mail section, click the Reading icon to display the Reading 
preferences pane (see Figure  22-15 ). 
 3. 
 In the “Mark mail as read” area, select the appropriate option button:
  When viewed in the reading pane for these seconds : Select this option button 
if you want Outlook to mark a message as read when you open it in the 
Reading pane and don’t move the focus for the number of seconds specified 
in the text box. The default is two seconds, but you may want to use a longer 
period so that you can glance through a message without having Outlook 
mark it as read. If you want Outlook to mark a message as read the instant 
you open the message, choose 0 (zero) seconds.  
 Figure 22-15.   In the Reading pane of the Outlook Preferences window, use the options in the “Mark mail as read” area 
to control when Outlook decides you’ve read an item  
 

639
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
  When selection changes : Select this option button if you want Outlook to 
mark an item as read when you display it in the Reading pane and then 
display another item. In this case, the trigger for marking the item as read is 
your changing the selection, not the length of time you spend looking at the 
item. 
  Only when opened in a separate window : Select this option button if you 
want Outlook to mark an item as read only after you open the item in its own 
window. 
 4. 
 Click the Close button (the red button in the upper-left corner) to 
close the Reading pane of the Outlook Preferences window.  
 Sending and Receiving Messages 
 When you have Outlook set up and working right, you probably want to start by using Mail. 
This section shows you how to create and send messages, how to receive messages, and 
how to read your messages. 
 Sending an E-mail Message 
 To send an e-mail message, you create a message, address it, and add contents. You may 
also want to choose options for the message, such as setting its reply-to address to a 
different e-mail address than the one you’re sending from. 
 Creating a New Message 
 You can create a new blank  message  in any of these three ways:
  Keyboard : Press Cmd+Option+N.  
  Ribbon : Choose Home ➤ New Email from the Mail category or Home ➤ 
New Items ➤ Email from any category.  
  Menu bar : Choose File ➤ New ➤ Email.  
 Whichever way you give the command, Outlook opens a new message window. The 
message window’s title bar at first shows Untitled, but then it displays the subject line you 
give the message. Figure  22-16 shows a message window with a new message open. As you 
can see, the Ribbon in the message window contains the Message tab and the Options tab.  
 Note   When you’ve selected the Mail category, you can also press Cmd+N to create a new e-mail 
message. Cmd+N is the keyboard shortcut for creating a new item of whichever kind you’re currently 
using—for example, when you’re using Calendar, pressing Cmd+N creates a new appointment. But 
you can use the Cmd+Option+N shortcut to create a new e-mail message from anywhere in Outlook. 

640
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Choosing Which Account to Send the Message From 
 If you have set up Outlook to use multiple e-mail accounts, check which account appears 
in the  From pop-up menu  . Outlook uses the account you’re working in, but sometimes you 
may need to change accounts. To do so, open the From pop-up menu, and then click the 
account you want to use.  
 Addressing the Message 
 You can add the components of a message in any order that suits you, but what you’ll 
usually want to do is  address the message first. To do so, you enter the primary recipients in 
the To box and any Cc (carbon  copy ) recipients in the Cc box. 
 Figure 22-16.   A new message opens in a window named Untitled at first 
 

641
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 You can enter the e-mail addresses in three main ways:
  Type or paste in an e-mail address : If you know the e-mail address, you 
can click in the box (for example, the To box) and simply type it in. Or if 
you’ve copied from a document or a web page, you can paste it in.  
  Type the name and have Outlook complete the address for you : Click 
in the box and start typing the name. When Outlook suggests a match 
(see Figure  22-17 ), press Enter to accept it. If Outlook suggests several 
matches, click the right address; or move the highlight to the right one 
by pressing Down arrow or Up arrow, and then press Return.  
  Use the Search People window : Click the button to the right of the To 
box or the button to the right of the Cc box to display the Search People 
window (see Figure  22-18 ), and then work like this:
  Start typing the search term in the search field at the top of the window. 
The main part of the window displays matching results.  
 Figure 22-17.   Outlook automatically suggests matching contacts for names you start typing 
 

642
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
  If you need to restrict the search to just names rather than all fields, open the left 
pop-up menu, and then click Search Names Only instead of Search All Fields.  
  If you need to restrict the search to a particular address book, click the right 
pop-up menu, and then choose the address book. For example, choose 
Address Book in the On My Computer area of the pop-up menu to use your 
Mac’s Address Book.  
  Click the address you want.  
  Click the To button to add the address to the To box, click the Cc button to 
add it to the Cc box, or click the Bcc button to add it to the Bcc box. 
 Figure 22-18.   Use the Search People window to select e-mail recipients from your contacts list to a message 
 

643
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
  When you’ve chosen all the addresses you want, click the Close button (the 
red button at the left end of the title bar) to close the Search People window.  
 Adding the  Subject Line and Message Contents  
 In the Subject box, type the subject of the message. This is the text that appears in the 
recipient’s Inbox to help them identify the message. 
 In the main box of the message window, enter the text of the message. Many e-mail 
messages require only plain text, which you can enter by typing as normal (or by using other 
standard text-entry techniques, such as pasting text or expanding AutoCorrect entries). 
Other messages need formatted text, pictures, or other graphical items. 
 The easiest way to apply formatting to a message is to use the controls on the Message tab 
of the Ribbon in a message window. You can also apply formatting from the Format menu 
and its submenus (on the menu bar or by using keyboard shortcuts (for example, press 
Cmd+B to apply bold, Cmd++ to increase the font size, or Cmd+– to decrease the font size). 
 Tip  Make your subject lines as clear as possible while keeping them short enough to fit in the narrow 
columns that appear in a typical e-mail app window. Your message will most likely be competing for the 
recipient’s attention with many other messages, so making the subject clear will help it get read. 
 Note   Outlook lets you format the message content as plain text or as HTML. To choose which, 
choose Options ➤ Format Text from the Ribbon in a message window, clicking the Format switch 
to move it to the HTML position or to the Plain position. You can also choose Draft ➤ HTML Format 
from the menu bar (clicking to place a check mark next to the HTML Format item or to remove the 
check mark) or press Cmd+Shift+T. Choose Plain Text when you want the text to have no formatting. 
Choose HTML when you want to use formatting that is compatible with most e-mail apps. 
 Note Bcc stands for  blind carbon  copy . You use the Bcc field to add recipients whose names the To 
recipients and Cc recipients will not be able to see. This is sometimes useful in business situations. 
It’s also useful when you’re sending a message to a group of people who may not want to disclose 
their e-mail addresses to each other—for example, when you send a change-of-address message 
to your acquaintances. By putting your own address in the To field and all the other recipients’ 
addresses in the Bcc field, you can prevent each recipient from seeing others’ addresses.

644
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Choosing Options for a Message 
 The  Options tab  of the Ribbon in a message window (see Figure  22-19 ) contains a range of 
options for making a message look and behave differently from normal.  
 Click the Bcc button if you need to add the  Bcc field to the message so that you can add 
Bcc recipients directly. (You can also add Bcc recipients by using the Select Contacts 
window, as discussed earlier.) 
 To add a background color to the message, click the Background Color button, and then 
click the color in the Colors window that opens. To add a background picture, click the 
Background Picture button, browse to the picture in the dialog box that opens, and then 
click the Open button. 
 The Permissions pop-up menu lets you set restrictions on a message you’re sending to 
another Outlook user on your e-mail system. For example, you can set the Do Not Forward 
restriction on a message to prevent the recipient from forwarding the message. To set up 
Outlook to use permissions, choose Options ➤ Permissions ➤ Verify Credentials from the 
Ribbon in a message window, enter your credentials in the Login dialog box that opens, and 
then click the Sign In button. 
 Note  To remove a background picture, choose Options ➤ Background Picture ➤ Remove from 
the Ribbon in a message window, clicking the pop-up button next to the Background Picture button 
and then clicking Remove on the pop-up menu. 
 Note   You can mark a message as being important by choosing Message ➤ High Priority from 
the Ribbon in a message window or Draft ➤ Priority ➤ High from the menu bar (or you can choose 
Message ➤ Low Priority from the Ribbon in a message window or Draft ➤ Priority ➤ Low from the 
menu bar to mark a message as being unimportant). But be warned that high importance has been 
so widely abused in e-mail messages that many people ignore it. 
 Figure 22-19.   The Options tab of the Ribbon in a message window lets you change the message’s look and behavior 
 

645
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 The Security pop-up menu contains two commands:
  Digitally Sign Message : Use this command to apply a digital signature to 
the message, proving that the message came from someone who holds 
the digital certificate you specify. (Normally, you specify your digital 
certificate so that the recipient can tell the message comes from you.)  
  Encrypt Message : Use this command to encrypt this message so that it 
can be decrypted only by someone who holds the appropriate digital 
certificate.  
 
SETTING UP DIGITAL CERTIFICATES FOR SIGNING AND ENCRYPTION
 Before you can use the  Digitally Sign Message command or the Encrypt Message command on the Security 
pop-up menu on the Options tab of the Ribbon in a message window, you must set Outlook up with the digital 
certificates it needs for signing and encryption. 
 To tell Outlook which certificates to use, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Tools ➤ Accounts from the menu bar to display the Accounts pane in the Outlook 
Preferences window. 
 2. 
 In the Accounts list on the left, click the account for which you want to set up the 
certificates. 
 3. 
 Click the Advanced button at the lower-right corner of the account information to display 
the Advanced dialog box. 
 4. 
 Click the Security tab to display its contents (see Figure  22-20 ). 
 Note  When you digitally sign a message or encrypt a message, the Information bar appears 
below the Ribbon in the message window showing a padlock and containing a readout about the 
security measure, such as “This message will be digitally signed.” 
 Caution   The options on the Permissions pop-up menu work on only some mail servers (such as 
Microsoft Exchange servers). 

646
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 5. 
 In the Digital Signing area, open the Certificate pop-up menu, and then click the certificate 
you want to use for digital signing. 
 6. 
 In the Signing algorithm pop-up menu, leave the default selection, SHA-256, selected 
unless an administrator has told you to use a different signing algorithm. 
 7. 
 If you need to sign all the messages you send on this account, select the Sign outgoing 
messages check box. Otherwise, leave this check box cleared, and use the Options ➤ 
Security pop-up menu on the Ribbon in the message window to sign individual messages 
as needed. 
 8. 
 Select the “Send digitally signed messages as clear text” check box if you want to ensure 
recipients can read your e-mail messages even if they’re using a mobile e-mail client or a 
web-based e-mail service. 
 9. 
 Select the “Include my certificates in signed messages” check box to make Outlook 
include your certificate’s public key in the messages. Sending the public key enables the 
recipients to send you encrypted messages, which is usually helpful. 
 10. 
 In the Encryption area, open the Certificate pop-up menu, and then click the certificate you 
want to use for encryption. 
 11.  In the Encryption algorithm pop-up menu, leave the default selection, AES-256, selected 
unless an administrator has told you to use a different encryption algorithm. 
 Figure 22-20.   If you need to digitally sign and encrypt messages, set up Outlook with digital certificates on the 
Security tab of the Advanced dialog box for the account  
 

647
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 12.  Select the Encrypt outgoing messages check box only if you want to encrypt every 
message you send from this account. Otherwise, clear this check box, and then apply 
encryption from the Options ➤ Security pop-up menu in the message window to 
individual messages as needed. 
 13.  Click the OK button to close the Advanced dialog box. 
 14.  Click the Close button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) to close the Accounts 
preferences window. 
 Checking the Spelling in a Message 
 Outlook checks spelling and  grammar  as you type unless you turn off the spelling checker 
and grammar checker, so you can easily resolve spelling and grammar queries as you create 
the message. 
 If you choose not to check spelling and grammar as you work, you can start a check by 
clicking the Spelling button on the Options tab of the Ribbon in a message window, 
choosing Edit ➤ Spelling and Grammar ➤ Check Now from the menu bar, or pressing 
Cmd+; (Cmd and the semicolon key). 
 Sending the Message 
 When you’re ready to send the message, click the  Send button  at the left end of the 
Message tab on the Ribbon in the message window. Alternatively, choose Draft ➤ Send 
from the menu bar or press Cmd+Return.  
 Receiving and Reading Messages  
 Normally, Outlook automatically checks your incoming mail server for messages and collects 
those sent to you. You can also force Outlook to check all your accounts for e-mail at any 
point by clicking the Send/Receive button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or choosing Tools 
➤ Send & Receive from the menu bar or pressing Cmd+K. 
 Once you’ve received your messages, click the Inbox to display them. You can then read 
the messages either in the Reading pane or in a separate window. The Reading pane is 
often easiest because it’s designed to enable you to quickly triage your messages. Open a 
message in a separate window when you need more space to concentrate on it or when you 
need to compare the contents of two or more messages side by side. 
 Note   To control whether Outlook checks spelling and grammar, choose Edit ➤ Spelling and 
Grammar from the menu bar, and then place or remove the check mark next to the Check Spelling 
While Typing command or the Check Grammar With Spelling command on the Spelling and Grammar 
submenu. To control whether Outlook automatically corrects apparent spelling errors, choose Edit ➤ 
Spelling and Grammar ➤ Correct Spelling Automatically from the menu bar, either placing or removing 
a check mark next to the Check Spelling Automatically item on the Spelling and Grammar submenu. 

648
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Click the message you want to read, or press the Down arrow or Up arrow to move the 
highlight to the message so that Outlook displays it in the Reading pane. 
 To read a message in a separate window, double-click the message in the Message List. In 
the message window, you can then display the next message by pressing Ctrl+] or display 
the previous message by pressing Ctrl+[. Alternatively, choose View ➤ Next or View ➤ 
Previous from the menu bar. 
 To close a message window, click its Close button (the red button at the left end of the title 
bar), choose File ➤ Close from the menu bar, or press Cmd+W. 
 After reading a message, you can reply to it, move it to a folder, or delete it, as discussed 
later in this chapter. 
 Sending and Receiving Attachments 
 E-mail is a great way of sending messages quickly, but it’s also useful for transferring files 
from one computer to another. To send a file via e-mail, you attach it to a message that you 
then send as usual; and when someone sends you a file, it comes to your Inbox as part of 
the message that brings it. You then detach the file from the message and store it in a folder. 
 Tip   When reading messages in the Reading pane, press the spacebar to display the next screen 
of the message. When you reach the end of this message, press the spacebar again to display the 
next message. You can also press Shift+spacebar to display the previous screen of the current 
message or (from the beginning of the current message) to display the previous message. 
 Tip   As discussed in the “Using and Customizing the Reading Pane” section earlier in this chapter, 
Outlook normally marks a message as having been read after you view it for two seconds (or the 
number of seconds you set) in the Reading pane. If you turn off this automatic marking of messages 
as read, you can manually mark messages as read. From the keyboard, press Cmd+T to mark 
a message as read or press Cmd+Shift+T to mark a read message as unread. With the pointing 
device, Ctrl-click or right-click the message in the Message List, and then click Mark as Read on 
the context menu; to mark a read message as unread, Ctrl-click or right-click the message, and 
then click Mark as Unread on the context menu. 

649
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Sending a File as an Attachment 
 To send a file as an  attachment  , start a message as usual. Then choose Message ➤ Attach 
File from the Ribbon in the message window, choose Draft ➤ Attachments ➤ Add from the 
menu bar, or press Cmd+E to display a dialog box for selecting the file. Click the file you 
want, or select multiple files by Shift-clicking or Cmd-clicking, and then click the Choose 
button. Outlook adds an attachment box below the Subject box in the message window 
showing the file’s name and its size (see Figure  22-21 ). You can then add other files from 
other folders by repeating the process.  
 Receiving a File as an Attachment 
 When you receive a file as an  attachment  , it arrives in your Inbox with its message. 
A paperclip icon will appear on the message’s listing in the Message List and the 
attachment’s file name will appear at the top of the Reading pane (see Figure  22-22 ).  
 Tip   You can also attach a file to a message by dragging the file from a Finder window to the 
message window. 
 Figure 22-21.   Outlook displays the attachment box below the Subject box when you attach one or more files to a message  
 

650
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 To display a preview of the attachment, click the Preview button in the Reading pane. 
Outlook displays the preview using OS X’s Quick Look feature. 
 To save an attached file to a folder, Ctrl-click or right-click the attachment’s name in the Reading 
pane, and then click Save As on the context menu. In the dialog box that opens, navigate to the 
folder in which you want to save the file, change the file name if necessary, and then click the 
Save button. You can then open the file either from a Finder window or from the app you use for 
that type of file, such as Word for a word processing file or Excel for a spreadsheet file. 
 Tip  You can also grab an attached file by its name or icon and drag it to a Finder window or to 
your Desktop to save it there. 
 Figure 22-22.   The Message List displays a paperclip icon to indicate that a message has an attachment. The 
attachment’s name appears near the top of the Reading Pane  
 Caution  The pop-up menu for dealing with attachments includes an Open item, but don’t open 
an attachment directly from Outlook. This is because the file opens in read-only mode, in which you 
cannot save changes you make to the file. You then need to use a Save As command to save the file 
under a different file name or in a different folder. Saving the file from Outlook and then opening it 
using the appropriate app saves time and avoids confusion. 
 

651
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 After you’ve saved an attachment to a folder, you can either remove it from the message 
or leave it in the message for reference. Removing attachments is usually a good idea 
because otherwise your mailbox can become huge, but you may sometimes need to keep 
attachments in messages as a safety net. 
 To remove an attachment from a message, Ctrl-click or right-click the attachment icon in the 
Reading pane, and then click the Remove item on the context menu. In the confirmation 
dialog box that Outlook displays (see Figure  22-23 ), click the Delete button.  
 Replying  to and  Forwarding Messages  
 To reply to a message you’ve received, choose Home ➤ Reply from the Ribbon in the main 
Outlook window, choose Message ➤ Reply from the Ribbon in a message window, choose 
Message ➤ Reply from the menu bar, or press Cmd+R. To reply to all the recipients of a 
message you’ve received, choose Home ➤ Reply All from the Ribbon in the main Outlook 
window, choose Message ➤ Reply All from the Ribbon in a message window, choose 
Message ➤ Reply All from the menu bar, or press Cmd+Shift+R. 
 Outlook opens a message window for the reply, adding “Re:” to the subject line to indicate 
that it is a reply, and showing the original message and sender information below the 
insertion point (see Figure  22-24 ). You can then enter the text of the reply—and any other 
objects needed—and click the Send button to send it.  
 Tip   To quickly remove all the attachments from a message, Ctrl-click or right-click one of the 
attachment icons in the Reading pane, click the Remove All item on the context menu, and then 
click the Delete button in the confirmation dialog box that opens. 
 Figure 22-23.   Outlook confirms your removal of an attachment from a message 
 Tip  To include only part of the message in your reply, select that part of the message before 
giving the Reply command or Reply All command. This move helps you keep your messages 
concise and easy to understand. 
 

652
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 To send a message you’ve received to someone else, forward it by choosing Home ➤ 
Forward from the Ribbon in the main Outlook window, choosing Message ➤ Forward from 
the Ribbon in a message window, or choosing Message ➤ Forward from the menu bar; from 
the keyboard, press Cmd+J. Outlook opens a message window containing the forwarded 
message, adding “FW:” to the subject line to indicate that the message is forwarded, and 
placing the original message below the insertion point. You can then address the message, 
type whatever information you need to add to the forwarded message (for example, why 
you’re forwarding it), and then click the Send button. 
 
 Tip  To forward only part of a message, select that part of the message before giving the Forward 
command. If you need to forward several sections of the message, it’s usually easier to include the 
whole message in the forwarded message, and then delete those parts you don’t want to send. 
 Sometimes it’s useful to forward a message as an attachment so that the recipient can see it as it 
originally appeared. To do this, choose Home ➤ Attachment from the Ribbon in the main Outlook 
window, choose Message ➤ Attachment in a message window, or choose Message ➤ Forward 
Special ➤ As Attachment from the menu bar. You can also press Cmd+Ctrl+J from the keyboard to 
forward a message as an attachment. 
 Figure 22-24.   Outlook adds “Re:” to the subject of a reply and includes the original message 
 

653
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Deleting, Storing, and Organizing Messages 
 When you don’t need to keep an e-mail message, you can delete it by selecting it and 
pressing the Delete key on the keyboard, choosing Home ➤ Delete from the Ribbon in the 
main Outlook window, choose Message ➤ Delete from the Ribbon in a message window, or 
choosing Edit ➤ Delete from the menu bar. But chances are that you’ll need to keep many—
perhaps most—of the messages you receive. That means creating a structure of folders in 
which you can place the messages and then moving each message to the appropriate folder. 
 Moving a Message to a Mail Folder 
 The quick way to move a message to a mail  folder  is to drag the message from the Message 
List to the folder in the Folder pane. This technique works well when you have few enough 
folders to fit easily in the Folder pane; if you have a longer list of folders, you can drag down 
to the bottom of the Folder pane to make it scroll further, but even so, getting to the folder 
you want can be awkward. 
 The next way of moving a message is to select it, open the Move pop-up menu on the Home 
tab of the Ribbon in the main Outlook window or the Message tab of the Ribbon in a 
message window, and then click the destination folder on the menu (see Figure  22-25 ). 
 If the folder you want doesn’t appear on the Move pop-up menu, click the Other Folder item 
on the Move pop-up menu or choose Message ➤ Move ➤ Choose Folder from the Ribbon 
to display the Search dialog box (see Figure  22-26 ). Type the first few letters of the folder 
name, click the folder in the list of results, and then click the Move button.  
 Tip   You can also move a message to a folder using the menu bar. Select the message, choose 
Message ➤ Move, and then click the folder on the Move submenu. 
 Figure 22-25.   You can quickly move the selected message to a folder that appears on the Move pop-up menu. If the 
folder doesn’t appear, click the Other Folder item

 Creating a New Mail Folder 
 To create a new mail  folder  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 In the Folder pane, Ctrl-click or right-click the folder in which you 
want to create the new folder, and then click New Folder on the 
context menu. Outlook adds a new folder named Untitled Folder and 
displays an edit box around the name.  
 2. 
 Type the name for the folder, and then press Return to apply the 
name.  
 To rename an existing folder, Ctrl-click or right-click it in the Folder pane, and then click 
Rename Folder on the context menu. Outlook displays an edit box around the name. Type 
the new name, and then press Return (or click elsewhere) to apply it.  
 Adding Consistent Closings to Your Messages with 
Signatures 
 When you send a message, you often need to let the recipient know standard information 
about you, such as your name and phone numbers or your company name and address, 
plus your position in it. To save you having to retype the same information over and over 
again, Outlook provides a feature called   signatures that lets you set up one or more standard 
closings for inserting in your messages. 
 Figure 22-26.   When you have many folders, you may find it easier to search for the folder to which you want to move 
the message  
 

655
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 To set up your signatures, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Outlook ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the 
comma key) to display the Outlook Preferences window.  
 2. 
 In the E-mail area, click the Signatures icon to display the Signatures 
pane (shown in Figure  22-27 with a signature being created).  
 3. 
 To add a signature, click the Add (+) button in the lower-left corner 
of the Edit signature pane. Outlook adds a new signature named 
Untitled to the left box. Double-click the Untitled name to display an 
edit box, type the name for the signature, and then press Return to 
apply the name.  
 Tip   If you find signatures awkward, you can create a signature as an AutoCorrect entry and enter 
it by typing its abbreviation. See Chapter   2  for coverage of AutoCorrect. 
 Figure 22-27.   Set up one or more standard signatures in the Signatures pane of the Outlook Preferences window 
 

656
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 4. 
 To edit a signature, click it in the left list box. Outlook displays the 
signature in the box on the right side. You can then edit the existing 
text, type or paste in additional text, or apply extra content. The 
Signature pane looks Spartan, but you can apply formatting by using 
the Format menu on the menu bar or by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking 
and then choosing Font ➤ Show Fonts on the context menu.  
  5. 
 To control which signature Outlook uses by default, use the controls in 
the Choose default signature area of the Signatures preferences pane. 
Click the Account pop-up menu and select the account for which you 
want to configure signatures. Then open the New messages pop-up 
menu and select the signature you want to use for new messages. 
After that, open the Replies/forwards pop-up message and select the 
signature (if any) to use for replies and messages you forward.  
 6. 
 When you’ve finished creating signatures, click the Close button 
(the red button at the left end of the title bar) to close the Outlook 
Preferences window.  
 Now create a new message using the account you set up to use a signature, and make sure 
that Outlook inserts the signature you chose. 
 If you prefer to insert a signature manually, click in the body area of the e-mail message, 
choose Message ➤ Signature from the Ribbon in the message window, and then click the 
signature you want on the Signature pop-up menu. Alternatively, choose Draft ➤ Signatures 
from the menu bar, and then click the signature on the Signatures submenu.  
 Dealing with Spam 
 E-mail monitoring companies report that more than nine out of ten e-mail messages are 
 spam , or unsolicited commercial messages. ISPs and e-mail providers generally do a great 
job of preventing most spam from reaching us, but even so, plenty of spam messages evade 
the filters and make it to inboxes. 
 To help you deal with spam, Outlook automatically monitors your incoming mail and puts 
any suspected spam in the Junk E-Mail folder. It’s a good idea to visit this folder every day 
or two to rescue any messages that Outlook has falsely accused and to get rid of the rest. 
 Tip   You can add a picture to a signature if necessary: choose View ➤ Media Browser ➤ Photo 
Browser from the menu bar to display the Photos Browser, and then drag the picture you want to 
the box on the right side of the Signature pane. To keep down the burden on mail servers, it’s best 
to use only small pictures, and even then only when necessary. 

657
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 Removing Non spam Messages  from the Junk E-Mail Folder 
 If your Junk E-Mail folder contains a message that’s not junk, Ctrl-click or right-click the 
message in the Message List, and then choose Junk Mail ➤ Mark as Not Junk from the 
context menu. Outlook moves the message to the Inbox. 
 After checking that all the messages in your Junk E-Mail folder are spam, Ctrl-click or right-
click the Junk E-Mail folder, and then click Empty Folder from the context menu. 
Alternatively, select the messages in the folder, and then choose Home ➤ Delete from the 
Ribbon or press the Delete key to delete them. 
 Marking Spam Messages as Junk 
 If you receive a spam message in your Inbox, Ctrl-click or right-click it, and then choose the 
appropriate action from the Junk Mail submenu on the context menu:
  Block Sender : Outlook adds the sender’s name to your Blocked Senders 
list, but leaves the message in your Inbox.  
  Mark as Junk : Outlook moves the message to the Junk E-Mail folder.  
 Creating a List of Safe Senders and Domains for E-Mail 
 To make sure you receive messages from people you trust, you can create a list of safe 
senders and safe domains. Safe senders are specific e-mail addresses you judge to be safe. 
Safe domains are address blocks you tell the junk e-mail filter to treat as being safe. For 
example, if you want to receive all messages sent from addresses at apple.com, you can 
add apple.com to the Safe Domains list. 
 To set up your list of safe senders and safe  domains  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Tools ➤ Junk E-Mail Protection from the menu bar to display 
the Junk preferences pane in the Outlook Preferences window.  
 2. 
 Click the Safe Senders tab to display it (see Figure  22-28 ).  
 Tip   If you like using keyboard shortcuts, learn these two: press Ctrl+Shift+J to mark a message 
as junk, or press Ctrl+Shift+Option+J to mark a message as not junk. 

658
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 3. 
 Click the Add (+) button below the list box to start a new entry in the 
list box.  
 4. 
 Type the e-mail address or domain.  
 5. 
 When you finish adding safe senders and safe domains, close the 
Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red button at 
the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Removing Senders You’ve Blocked by Mistake 
 As you saw earlier in this chapter, Outlook maintains a Blocked Senders list to which you 
add addresses by blocking individual senders. If you block a sender and then realize you 
shouldn’t have, follow these steps to remove the sender from the Blocked Senders list:
 1. 
 Choose Tools ➤ Junk E-Mail Preferences to display the Junk 
preferences pane in the Outlook Preferences window.  
 2. 
 Click the  Blocked Senders tab  to bring it to the front (see Figure  22-29 ).  
 Figure 22-28.   Add your safe senders and safe domains to the list on the Safe Senders tab in the Junk preferences pane  
 

659
CHAPTER 22: Using E-mail Effectively
 3. 
 In the Blocked Senders list, select the address of the sender you’ve 
blocked by mistake, and then click the Remove (–) button to delete it.  
 4. 
 Add other addresses as needed, separating them with commas. You 
can add either a specific address (for example, bill@spamming123.
com) or the whole domain (for example, spamming123.com).  
 5. 
 Close the Preferences window by clicking the Close button (the red 
button at the left end of the title bar) or pressing Cmd+W.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to get around the Outlook interface and how to use 
Outlook’s features for managing your e-mail. 
 You set up Outlook to work with your e-mail account, and you now know how to send and 
receive e-mail and attachments. You can reply to messages, forward messages to others, 
delete messages you don’t want, and store those you want to keep. You can create and use 
signatures, and you know how to deal with spam—both identifying messages as spam and 
recovering those that Outlook has mistakenly sent to the Junk E-Mail folder. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to use Outlook to organize your contacts.  
 Figure 22-29.   On the Blocked Senders tab in the Junk preferences pane, you can remove senders you’ve blocked by 
mistake or add entire domains to block

 Chapter 23  
 Keeping Your Contacts 
in Order 
 In this chapter, I’ll show you how to use Outlook to keep your contacts in order. I’ll start 
by going through how to create contacts either from scratch or by importing your existing 
contacts from sources such as address books or spreadsheets. After that, I’ll show you how to 
work with contacts: viewing and arranging your contacts to reveal the ones you need, editing 
contact information when necessary, and quickly starting communications to your contacts. 
 Creating Contacts 
 First, you need to create some contacts in Outlook. You can create  contacts  by entering the 
information manually, by merging your OS X contacts with Outlook, or by importing existing 
contacts from other sources. You’ll look at each option in turn. 
 Creating a Contact from Scratch 
 If you have a contact’s details on a hard copy (for example, a business card or paper) rather 
than in an electronic form, you need to enter the details manually. To do so, create a contact 
 from scratch  by following these steps:
 1. 
 Click the People button in the Navigation pane if it’s not already 
selected.  
 2. 
 Choose Home ➤ New Contact from the Ribbon or File ➤ New ➤ 
Contact from the menu bar, or press Cmd+N, to open a new contact 
window. Figure  23-1 shows a contact window with a contact’s name 
entered. Until you enter the name, the window’s title bar is blank.  

662
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 3. 
 Type the contact’s first name in the First Name field. Outlook adds 
the name to the title bar.  
 4. 
 Press Tab to move to the Last Name field.  
 5. 
 Type the contact’s last name. Outlook adds this to the title bar too.  
 6. 
 Press Tab to move to the Job Title field, or click in another field to 
move directly to that field.  
 7. 
 Continue entering the contact’s information. Fill in the Office, 
Department, and Company fields if you have the relevant data.  
 8. 
 If you have a photo of the contact, add it like this:
  Double-click the Picture placeholder to display the dialog box 
shown in Figure  23-2 . The empty frame in the middle is the 
 image well . 
 Figure 23-1.   When you type in the contact’s name, Outlook displays it in the title bar of the contact window 
 

663
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
  Add a photo by dragging it from a Finder window to the image well 
or by clicking the Other button in the left column, selecting the 
photo in the Open dialog box, and then clicking the Open button.  
  Click the Zoom In (+) button to zoom in, drag the Zoom Out (–) 
button to zoom out, or drag the Zoom slider, as needed, to make the 
face the right size.  
  If necessary, click inside the image well and drag the photo so that 
the face appears in the frame.  
  If the photo will benefit from you applying an effect, click the Effect 
button (the swirly icon above the Done button) and then click the 
effect you want.  
  Click the Done button to close the dialog box and add the photo to 
the contact record.  
 9. 
 Enter the contact’s phone numbers in the Phone area. Outlook gives 
you a Mobile entry and a Work entry by default. To change one of 
these to a different type of entry, click the pop-up button to the right 
of the name (for example, Mobile), and then click the type you want 
(for example, Home). You can add other phone numbers by clicking 
the Add (+) button next to the Phone heading and then clicking 
the type of number: Work 2, Home, Home 2, Work Fax, Home Fax, 
Pager, Primary, Assistant, Phone 1, Phone 2, Phone 3, or Phone 4.  
 Figure 23-2.   Add a photo by dragging it to the image well from a Finder window or by clicking the Other button in the 
left column and using the Open dialog box. Then use the Size slider to make the photo the right size  
 

664
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 10. 
 Enter the contact’s e-mail address or addresses in the Internet area. 
Outlook displays a work e-mail item at first, but you can change this 
if necessary by clicking its pop-up menu and then choosing the right 
address type. You can also add other addresses by clicking the Add 
(+) button next to the Internet heading and then clicking the type of 
address: work e-mail, home e-mail, other e-mail, IM address, work 
web page, or home web page.  
 11. 
 In the Address area of the contact window, enter the contact’s 
addresses. Outlook displays a work address at first, but you can 
change this if necessary by clicking its pop-up menu and then 
clicking Home. Alternatively, you can add home address fields by 
clicking the Add (+) button next to the Address heading and then 
clicking Home.  
 12. 
 To add personal information, click the Add (+) button next to the 
Personal heading at the bottom of the General tab, and then click 
the field you want to add—for example, Middle Name, Spouse/
Partner, or Title—on the pop-up menu (see Figure  23-4 ). Outlook 
adds the field to the Personal section, and you can type the relevant 
information in the box.  
 Figure 23-3.   In a message window or the Reading pane, hold the pointer over the sender’s name, and then click Open 
Outlook contact on the pop-up panel to start creating a new contact for that person  
 Tip   You can start creating a contact quickly by holding the pointer over the sender’s name in an 
e-mail message or in the Reading pane and then clicking the Open Outlook contact icon on the 
pop-up panel. Figure  23-3 shows an example of this move. 
 

665
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 13. 
 On the other four tabs of the Contact window, fill in further 
information about the contact as needed:
  Organization tab : If your Mac is connected to a Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol (LDAP) server, you can enter organization information here.  
  Details tab : If your Mac is connected to an LDAP server, you can enter 
details here.  
  Notes tab : This tab contains a text box for entering notes about the 
contact. You can format the notes by using the commands on the 
Format menu on the menu bar or on the context menu (Ctrl-click or 
right-click the selection you want to format).  
  Certificates : On this tab (see Figure  23-5 ), set up the default certificate you 
want to use for encrypting e-mail messages to this contact. If a contact 
has a single certificate, as is often the case, Outlook automatically makes 
that certificate the default one. If a contact has multiple certificates, and 
the wrong one is marked Default in the Encryption certificates list, click the 
certificate you want to use, click the Action button in the lower-right corner, 
and then click Set as Default on the pop-up menu.  
 Figure 23-4.   The Add (+) pop-up menu in the Personal area provides a wide variety of fields. As you add each field to 
the Personal area, Outlook removes it from the pop-up menu  
 

666
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 14. 
 If you want to assign a contact to a particular category of contacts—
for example, Professional, Social, or Family—choose Contact ➤ 
Categorize from the Ribbon, and then click the appropriate category. 
Outlook gives the categories generic names, but you can customize 
the names and colors associated with the categories by choosing 
Contact ➤ Categorize ➤ Edit Categories from the Ribbon and 
working in the Categories dialog box.  
 15. 
 When you’ve finished entering the contact’s details, choose Contact 
➤ Save & Close from the Ribbon to save the contact record and 
close the window.  
 Figure 23-5.   On the Certificates tab of the contact window, make sure Outlook has identified the correct digital 
certificate for encrypting e-mail messages 
 Note   Normally, Outlook acquires digital certificates automatically when your contacts send you 
encrypted messages. But you can also add a certificate to a contact manually by clicking the Add 
(+) button in the lower-left corner of the Certificates tab and then following the prompts. 
 

667
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 Importing Contacts from Other Address Books 
 Often, you’ll have contact data in an  address book  already, so instead of typing it laboriously 
into new contacts one by one in Outlook, you can import it. Outlook 2016 gives you only one 
way to import contacts—as vCard files. A vCard file is a file that contains the virtual address 
card of one or more contacts. Most address-book and contact-management apps support 
the vCard standard, making vCards a straightforward way to transfer contact information 
from one app to another. When importing contact data from vCards, each of the fields is 
clearly mapped, so there’s no confusion about which piece of information goes where. 
 vCards are great as long as the app that currently contains the contact data can create 
vCards. In the next subsections, you’ll look at how to create vCards from the OS X Contacts 
app, from Yahoo!’s Contacts feature, and from Google Contacts. 
 If the app that contains the contact data can’t create vCards, you’ll need to work around the 
problem. See the “Getting Contact Data from Excel into a CSV File” section for instructions 
on getting contact data from an Excel worksheet into a comma-separated values (CSV) file. 
See the section after that, “Creating vCard Files from a CSV File,” for ways to create vCard 
files from a CSV file. 
 Creating vCard Files from the OS X Contacts App 
 If you have been keeping your contact data in OS X’s built-in Contacts app, you can create 
 vCard files  from the Contacts app and then import those files into Outlook. You can either create 
a single vCard file that contains all your contacts or pick and choose the contacts you want. 
 To create vCard files from your contacts in the Contacts app and import them into Outlook, 
follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts app. For example, click the Contacts icon on the 
Dock, or click the Launchpad icon on the Dock and then click the 
Contacts icon on the Launchpad screen.  
 2. 
 Select the contacts you want to export as vCards. To select all 
the contacts, choose Edit ➤ Select All from the menu bar or press 
Cmd+A. 
 Caution  Outlook 2016 for Mac cannot sync the contacts you import into it with your contacts in 
OS X’s Contacts app and your iCloud account. This is because Outlook 2016 for Mac doesn’t support 
the CardDAV standard for syncing contacts. So after you create vCard files from the Contacts app 
and import them into Outlook, the contacts in Outlook are separate from those in the Contacts app, 
and you cannot sync changes back and forth. If you’re going to use Outlook extensively, you should 
commit to keeping your contact data current in Outlook rather than in the Contacts app. 

668
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 3. 
 Click anywhere in the selection, and drag the contacts to your 
desktop or to a Finder window. The Contacts app creates a vCard 
file containing all the contacts.  
 Creating vCard Files from Yahoo!’s Contacts Feature 
 If you use  Yahoo! Mail  , chances are that you have contact information stored in Yahoo!’s 
Contacts feature. To get this data into Outlook, export it to a vCard file by following these steps:
 1. 
 Sign into Yahoo! and go to Contacts.  
 2. 
 Select the check box for each contact you want to export. You can 
click the unnamed check box at the top of the column to select all 
the check boxes in a single move.  
 3. 
 Click the Actions button, and then click Export on the pop-up menu 
to display the Export Contacts dialog box.  
 4. 
 Select the vCard Single File option button.  
 5. 
 Click the Export Now button. Your browser downloads the file, which 
is called  yahoo_contacts.vcf , to your  Downloads folder.  
 Note   Instead of dragging the contacts to your desktop or to a Finder window, you can Ctrl-click or 
right-click in the selection in the Contacts app and then click Export vCard on the context menu. In 
the dialog box that opens, choose the folder, specify the file name, and then click the Save button. 
 Note   The Yahoo! Export screen also offers an option named Outlook for exporting your contacts to 
a CSV file. You can use this option too for getting the contacts into Outlook, but generally, the vCard 
file is the easier choice. (The Outlook option is mostly for Windows versions of Outlook, which can 
handle single-person vCard files but not multi-person vCard files.) 
 Note   If the Contacts app prompts you to add the contacts to its list, click the Cancel button. 
 Tip   If you need only the contacts in a particular group, click the group in the left pane, and then 
choose Edit ➤ Select All from the menu bar or press Cmd+A to select all the contacts in that group. 
Alternatively, click the group and then choose individual contacts from it as necessary by clicking 
the first contact and then Cmd-clicking each of the others. 

669
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 Creating vCard Files from Google Contacts 
 If you use Gmail or  Google Mail  , you can export your contact data to a vCard file that you 
can then import into Outlook. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Sign into Gmail or Google Mail, and then go to the Contacts area.  
 2. 
 If you want to export individual contacts rather than all contacts or 
a defined group, select the check box for each contact you want 
to export. You can click the unnamed check box at the top of the 
column to select all the check boxes in a single move, and then 
deselect any you don’t want. Alternatively, click the pop-up menu to 
the right of the unnamed check box, and then click the group you 
want: All, None, Starred, or Unstarred.  
 3. 
 Click the More button to display the More pop-up menu, and then 
click Export to display the Export contacts dialog box.  
 4. 
 In the “Which contacts do you want to export?” area, select the 
appropriate option button:
  Selected contacts : Select this option button if you selected the 
contacts you want to export.  
  All contacts : Select this option button if you want to export all of 
your contacts.  
  The group : To export a group, select this option button, and then 
choose the appropriate group in the pop-up menu, such as Friends.  
 5. 
 In the “Which export format?” area, select the vCard format option 
button. 
 6. 
 Click the Export button. Google exports the contacts to a vCard file 
named  contacts.vcf in your  Downloads folder.  
 Getting Contact Data from Excel into a CSV File 
 If you’ve created a contact database in Excel, you may need to import contacts from it into 
Outlook. To do so, you need to save the appropriate worksheet as a CSV  file  , and then import it. 
 Note  Comma-separated values, abbreviated to CSV, is a standard format for exchanging data 
between spreadsheets or databases. The values are separated from each other with commas. When 
creating vCard files from a CSV file, you may need to adjust the field mapping manually to get each 
piece of information in the right place. 

670
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 To save a worksheet as a CSV file, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open the workbook in Excel.  
 2. 
 Activate the worksheet that contains the addresses. For example, 
click its sheet tab in the sheet tabs bar.  
 3. 
 Choose File ➤ Save As from the menu bar to display the Save As 
dialog box.  
 4. 
 Open the File Format pop-up menu and click Comma Separated 
Values (.csv).  
 5. 
 In the Save As text box, type the name you want to give the CSV file. 
Excel suggests the workbook’s current name, but you’ll often want to 
change it.  
 6. 
 If necessary, use the Where pop-up menu or the navigation panes to 
navigate to the folder in which you want to save the CSV file.  
 7. 
 Click the Save button. Excel displays the dialog box shown in 
Figure  23-6 , telling you that the workbook cannot be saved in the 
selected file format because it contains multiple sheets. This appears 
to be a problem, but it’s fine and normal.  
 8. 
 Click the Save Active Sheet button. Excel displays the dialog box 
shown in Figure  23-7 , warning you that the workbook contains 
features that will not work or that may be removed if you use the CSV 
format. This too is normal.  
 Figure 23-6.   If Excel displays this dialog box when you’re exporting a spreadsheet page to a CSV file, click the Save 
Active Sheet button to save just the active sheet  
 

671
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 9. 
 Click the Continue button. Excel now saves the active worksheet as 
a CSV file under the name you chose.  
 10.  Choose File ➤ Close from the menu bar to close the CSV file.  
 You can now create vCard files from the CSV file using the technique explained in the next 
section.  
 Creating vCard Files from a CSV File 
 If you have a CSV file containing contact data that you want to get into Outlook, you need to 
create vCard files from the  CSV file  . Many apps can do this, but usually the easiest option is 
to use the OS X Contacts app, which is on your Mac and longing for action. 
 Here’s how to create vCard files from a CSV file using the Contacts app:
 1. 
 Open the Contacts app. For example, click the Contacts icon on the 
Dock, or click the Launchpad icon on the Dock and then click the 
Contacts icon on the Launchpad screen.  
 2. 
 Choose File ➤ Import from the menu bar to display the Import dialog 
box. 
 3. 
 Navigate to the folder that contains the CSV file.  
 4. 
 Select the CSV file.  
 5. 
 Click the Open button. The Contacts app displays the Importing 
dialog box (see Figure  23-8 ). 
 Figure 23-7.   If Excel warns you that the workbook contains features that won’t work in the CSV format, click the 
Continue button 
 

672
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 6. 
 Select the Ignore first card check box if the first row of the CSV file 
contains field names. (Otherwise, you’ll get a vCard containing the 
field names.)  
 7. 
 Use the pop-up menus in the left pane to map the fields in the CSV 
file to the corresponding fields in the vCard format.  
 Note   If the first row of the CSV file contains descriptive field names, you may want to use the 
field names rather than the data they contain for reference as you map the fields. If you do this, 
remember to select the Ignore first card check box before clicking the OK button. 
 Tip   Several sections of the pop-up menus include a More submenu that contains less-used fields. 
For example, click the More submenu in the Related Name section to reach fields such as Related 
Name (spouse), Related Name (assistant), and Related Name (other). 
 Figure 23-8.   In the Importing dialog box in the Contacts app, select the Ignore first card check box if the first row of the 
CSV file contains field names. You can then use the pop-up menus in the left pane to map the CSV file’s fields correctly 
to the vCard fields. Choose the Do not import setting for any fields you want to omit from the vCard files  
 

673
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 8. 
 Click the Next (>) button or Previous (<) button at the bottom of the 
window to move from one record to another as needed. For example, 
you may need to view later records that contain data in fields that are 
blank in the earlier records.  
 9. 
 When you finish the mapping, click the OK button. The Contacts app 
imports your data, creating vCard files that you can subsequently 
add to Outlook.  
 Importing Contacts from vCard Files 
 When you create  vCard files  or receive them from others, you can quickly add them to your 
contacts list in Outlook. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 In Outlook, click the People button on the Navigation bar to display 
the People area.  
 2. 
 If the Address Book item in the left pane is collapsed, and you want to 
assign the incoming contacts to a specific group, click the expansion 
triangle to the left of the Address Book item to display the groups.  
 3. 
 Open a Finder window to the folder that contains the vCard file 
or files.  
 4. 
 Arrange the windows so that you can see both.  
 5. 
 Drag the vCard file from the Finder window or the desktop to the 
left pane in the People area of Outlook. If you want to assign the 
contacts to a group, drag the file to that group; otherwise, drag the 
file to the No Category. Outlook adds the contacts from the file.  
 Working with Contacts 
 After creating contacts or importing them into Outlook, you can work with them. Outlook 
makes it easy to view your contacts, sort them in different ways, edit the information in a 
contact record, organize your contacts into groups, and communicate with them. 
 Viewing Your Contacts 
 To  view  your list of contacts, click the People button in the Navigation Pane. Outlook displays 
the contacts with the Reading pane on the right of the window at first (see Figure  23-9 ), 
showing the details of the selected contact. If you prefer to have the Reading pane at the 
bottom of the window, choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Bottom from the Ribbon or 
choose View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Below from the menu bar as usual (or press Cmd+Shift+\).

CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 Arranging Your Contacts 
 You can  arrange  your contacts by whichever field you find most convenient. For example, 
you can arrange the contact list by First Name or by Last Name; by Work State or Work City; 
or by Birthday or Job Title. 
 The easiest way to choose the arrangement is to open the By pop-up menu at the top of 
the contacts list and then click the field you want. To use this view as the default for your 
contacts, open the By pop-up menu again, scroll all the way down to the bottom, and then 
click the Make This the Default View item. 
 You can also change the arrangement by using the Organize ➤ Arrange By pop-up menu on 
the Ribbon or the View ➤ Arrange By submenu on the menu bar. 
 To reverse the sort order, click the arrow button to the right of the By pop-up menu at the 
top of the contacts list. As you’d imagine, an upward arrow indicates an ascending sort, and 
a downward arrow indicates a descending sort.  
 Searching for a Contact 
 To  search for a contact, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Click in the Search box on the toolbar.  
 Figure 23-9.   Click the People button in the Navigation pane to display your contacts. The Reading pane appears on the 
right at first, but you can choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Bottom to move it to the bottom of the window 
 

675
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 2. 
 Start typing your search term. As you type, Outlook opens a pop-
up panel to let you choose among matches for the name, for the 
company, for e-mail addresses, or for the category (see Figure  23-10 ).  
 3. 
 Click the item you want; for example, click the name item to display 
name matches.  
 Editing Contact Information 
 As you interact with your contacts and learn more about them, you’ll often need to take 
notes, add further details, or change the information you’ve already entered. 
 To edit a contact’s information, double-click the contact record in the contacts list. Outlook 
opens the contact in a contact window, where you can edit the information freely. 
 When you’ve finished  editing  a contact record, choose Contact ➤ Save & Close from the 
Ribbon to save the contact record and close it.  
 Communicating with Your Contacts 
 When working in the main Contacts window or an individual contact window, you can 
quickly start a  communication  with one of your contacts by giving the appropriate 
command:
  E-mail : Choose Home ➤ E-mail from the Ribbon (in the main Contacts 
window) or Contact ➤ E-mail from the Ribbon (in an individual contact 
window) to create a new message to the contact.  
  Meeting : Choose Home ➤ Meeting from the Ribbon (in the main 
Contacts window) or Contact ➤ Meeting from the Ribbon (in an 
individual contact window) to start a meeting invitation to the contact.  
  Instant Message : Choose Home ➤ IM from the Ribbon (in the main 
Contacts window) or Contact ➤ IM from the Ribbon (in an individual 
contact window) to start an instant message to the contact.  
 Figure 23-10.   Type a search term in the Search box, and then click the category of result you want 
 

676
CHAPTER 23: Keeping Your Contacts in Order 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to work with contacts in Outlook. You now know how to 
create contacts from scratch or import your existing contact data into Outlook. And you now 
know how to view and arrange your contacts, edit their contact information, and quickly and 
easily start communications to them. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to use Outlook to manage your schedule.  
 Note   You can also start a communication by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking the contact in the 
contacts list and then choosing New E-mail to Contact, New Meeting with Contact, or New IM to 
Contact from the context menu.

 Chapter 24  
 Managing Your Calendar  
 In this chapter, you’ll look at how to use Outlook to schedule your appointments and keep 
your calendar in order. 
 First, you’ll meet the  Calendar interface  , learn to display the dates you want, and customize 
the calendar settings. I’ll discuss the different types of time commitments Outlook uses—
appointments, events, and meetings—and then I’ll show you how to use the Calendar’s 
different views. 
 After that, you’ll learn how to create one-time appointments (or events) and ones that repeat 
on a regular schedule. Finally, you’ll look at how to use Outlook to schedule meetings and 
how to respond to meeting invitations you receive. 
 Meeting the Calendar Interface 
 To get started working with the Calendar, click the Calendar button in the Navigation pane 
and choose View ➤ Go To ➤ Calendar from the menu bar or press Cmd+2. The very first 
time you display the Calendar, Outlook normally uses the Week view, which gives you an 
overview of the whole calendar week. After that, Outlook displays the Calendar in the last 
view you used, such as  Work Week view  (Figure  24-1 ). 
 These are the main parts of the Outlook calendar window:
  Folder pane : The  Folder pane  shows the calendar dates for the current 
month or two, plus your calendar with a list of the categories it contains. 
You can display the categories by clicking the sideways disclosure 
triangle or hide the categories by clicking the downward disclosure 
triangle. You can drag the horizontal dividing line between the monthly 
calendar area and the list of categories up or down to reallocate the 
space between the two.  

678
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
  Time bar : This vertical strip shows the times of day, with the hours marked. 
You can change the number of hours shown by dragging the Hours slider 
in the lower-right corner of the window to the left or right. The minimum 
number of hours you can display is 4; the maximum number is 24.  
  Zoom slider : Drag this slider to the left to decrease the number of hours 
shown in the Time bar or to the right to increase the number of hours 
shown.  
  Previous button : Click this button to display the previous time unit: the 
previous day when the Calendar is in Day view, the previous work week 
when the Calendar is in Work Week view, and so on.  
 Figure 24-1.   Outlook first opens showing the current week’s appointments 
 Note   As usual, you can hide the Folder pane by choosing View ➤ Folder Pane from the menu 
bar (clicking to remove the check mark from the Folder Pane item on the View menu). Give the 
command again when you want to restore the Folder pane. 
 

679
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
  Go to Today button : Click this button to move quickly to the current 
day without changing the view. For example, if the Calendar is in Week 
view, clicking the Go to Today button displays the current week with the 
current day selected.  
  Next button : Click this button to display the next time unit displayed: the 
next day, the next work week, the next month or whatever.  
 Displaying the Dates You Want 
 After you switch to Outlook to show the Calendar, you’ll probably want to first  display  the 
dates you need to work with. Make sure the Home tab of the Ribbon is displayed; if not, 
click the Home tab. Then click the button for the arrangement you want:
  Day : Click this button to display a single day at a time. This view gives 
you an in-depth view of that day.  
  Work Week : Click this button to display the days of the work week; 
Monday-to-Friday is the default, but you can change the days as 
needed, as you’ll see in a moment. This view can be highly useful for 
planning your time at work.  
  Week : Click this button to display a full week—Sunday through Saturday 
(you can change the start day of the week as needed).  
  Month : Click this button to display the full month, including any days 
from the previous month and next month needed to make up the full 
weeks.  
 Customizing the Calendar Settings 
 Outlook comes with standard calendar settings, but you can often save time and effort by 
taking a few minutes to customize the settings to suit your work schedule and your needs. 
For example, you may need to use different start times and end times for work, change the 
work week to show different days than Monday to Friday, or start the week on a different day 
than Sunday. 
 To customize the calendar  settings  , follow these steps:
 1. 
 Choose Outlook ➤ Preferences or press Cmd+, (Cmd and the 
comma key) to display the Outlook Preferences dialog box.  
 2. 
 In the Other area, click the Calendar item to display the Calendar 
preferences pane (see Figure  24-2 ). 

680
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 3. 
 To change your work hours, set the appropriate times in the Work 
day starts pop-up menu and the Work day ends pop-up menu. In 
Day view, Work view, and Week view, Outlook shades the hours 
outside work hours to help you avoid scheduling appointments in 
them (for example, a 3 a.m. meeting instead of a 3 p.m. meeting).  
 4. 
 To change the days Outlook displays for your work week, click the 
buttons in the Work week bar to switch them between dark gray (part 
of the work week) and light gray (days of freedom). If you set a day 
within your work week to be a non-workday, Outlook still displays that 
day in Work view but shades the day to indicate it’s not a workday.  
 5. 
 To set the day Outlook treats as the start of the week, open the “First 
day of week” pop-up menu and click the day you want. For example, 
choose Monday to start the week on Monday rather than the default 
day, Sunday. 
 6. 
 If you want to use a default reminder interval before appointments, 
select the Default reminder check box, and then choose the interval 
in the pop-up menu. Outlook offers intervals ranging from 0 minutes 
to 2 weeks. Doing this sets a reminder for each new appointment you 
create, but you can turn off the reminder, or use a different interval, 
for any appointment.  
 7. 
 In the “Default time zone for new events” pop-up menu, select the 
time zone in which most of your events will occur.  
 Figure 24-2.   In the Calendar pane in the Outlook Preferences window, set your work schedule, reminder interval, and 
default time zone. You can also choose whether to allow attendees to propose different times for meetings and whether 
to display the current weather 
 

681
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 8. 
 Select the “Allow attendees to propose another time for meetings” 
check box if you want to allow attendees to suggest time changes.  
 9. 
 Select the “Show current weather on calendar” check box if you 
want the Calendar view to include the current weather. If you select 
this check box, you can open the “Show temperature in” pop-up 
menu and choose Fahrenheit or Celsius, as needed.  
 10. 
 When you’ve finished choosing calendar settings, click the Close 
button (the red button at the left end of the title bar) to close the 
Outlook Preferences window.  
 Understanding Appointments, Events, and Meetings 
 Outlook’s Calendar uses three different types of time commitments:
  Appointment : An appointment is an item on your schedule that requires 
only you, not other people you need to invite or resources (for example, 
a conference room or projector) that you need to reserve. The Calendar 
creates appointments by default unless you choose to create an event 
or a meeting. An appointment occupies the appropriate time slots in 
your schedule. For example, if you create a three-hour meeting starting 
at 10 a.m., Outlook displays the appointment taking up the time slots 
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.  
  Event : An event  is simply an appointment that lasts for 24 hours or 
more. Instead of taking up all of a day’s time slots by displaying an event 
right across them, Outlook displays events in the banner area at the top 
of the schedule.  
  Meeting : A  meeting  is an appointment to which you invite other people 
or for which you schedule resources.  
 Creating Appointments and Events 
 This section shows you how to create appointments and events. The following section 
explains how to schedule meetings. 
 Note   You can change any of the three types of time commitments to another type by editing its 
details. For example, you can change an appointment to a meeting by inviting someone else to it. 
 Note   At this writing, you cannot synchronize Outlook’s Calendar with other calendars, such as OS 
X’s Calendar app or online calendars such as Google Calendar. 

682
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 Creating One-Time Appointments 
 In a typical schedule, many of your appointments will occur only once rather than at regular 
intervals. You can create such one-time appointments either quickly, providing a minimum 
amount of information, or by using an Appointment window to enter full details.  
 Creating a One-Time Appointment Quickly 
 To create a one-time appointment quickly, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Drag through the appropriate slot in the schedule to select it. As you 
drag, Outlook increases the length of the appointment by a quarter-
hour at a time.  
 2. 
 Type the name of the appointment (or as much detail as you need, 
but it all goes into a single field). Figure  24-3 shows an example of 
creating an appointment like this.  
 3. 
 Press Return to apply the appointment.  
 Creating a One-Time Appointment or Event with Full Details 
 Creating a one-time appointment quickly as discussed in the previous section is often 
handy, but other times you may need to enter full details for a one-time appointment. To do 
so, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Double-click in the schedule at the point where you want the 
appointment to start. Outlook opens an Appointment window (shown 
in Figure  24-4 with some settings chosen).  
 Figure 24-3.   You can create a one-time appointment quickly by dragging through the time period and then typing the 
details into the box that Outlook displays. The bell in the lower-right corner shows that Outlook has added a default 
reminder, as set in Calendar preferences 
 

683
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 2. 
 In the Subject box, type the subject of the appointment or event.  
 3. 
 In the Location box, type the location for the appointment or event.  
 4. 
 Use the controls on the Starts line to adjust the date and start time 
of the appointment if necessary. If you got the date and time right in 
step 1, these controls will already be set correctly.  
 5. 
 Use the controls on the Ends line to set the date and end time of the 
appointment. For most appointments, the easiest way to do this is 
to open the Duration pop-up menu and choose one of the preset 
durations. If you need a duration that doesn’t appear on the Duration 
pop-up menu, type the exact end time in the time box on the Ends line.  
 6. 
 If you want to create an all-day event rather than an appointment, 
select the All day event check box.  
 7. 
 Type any notes for the appointment in the box at the bottom of 
the Appointment window. For example, you may need to prepare 
materials to take with you.  
 8. 
 In the Status pop-up menu on the Ribbon, Outlook automatically 
selects Busy when you create the appointment. Instead, you can 
choose Out of Office, Tentative, or Free. Outlook displays a shaded 
bar on the left side of the appointment or event in the Calendar so 
that you can easily see the status you’ve set.  
 Note   You can also start an item by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking the time in the schedule and then 
clicking the New Meeting item, the New Appointment item, or the New All Day Appointment item on 
the context menu. 
 Figure 24-4.   Open an Appointment window when you want to specify the appointment’s details beyond the subject and 
the times  
 

684
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 9. 
 In the Reminder pop-up menu on the Ribbon, choose whether and 
when Outlook should play a reminder for you about the appointment. 
The default setting is 15 minutes (or the interval you set in the 
Calendar preferences pane), but you can choose None to turn off the 
reminder or any length of time between 0 minutes and 2 weeks.  
 10. 
 If you need to change the time zone for the appointment, click the 
Time Zones button on the Ribbon. Outlook displays a time zone pop-
up menu below the Ends time line. Choose the time zone you need.  
 11. 
 If you need to create a recurring event, click the Recurrence 
button, and then work as described in the “Creating Repeating 
Appointments” section later in this chapter.  
 12. 
 If you need to categorize the appointment, open the Categorize pop-
up menu on the Ribbon, and then click the category you want, such 
as Manager or Team. You can apply multiple categories if you need 
to do so.  
 13. 
 If this is a private appointment, click the Private button on the Ribbon 
to prevent others from seeing the appointment’s details when you 
share your calendar.  
 14. 
 Click the Save & Close button on the Ribbon to save the details of 
the appointment and close the window.  
 Creating Repeating Appointments 
 If your work life involves repeating appointments, you can set them up easily in Outlook. 
Follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Open an Appointment window, and set up the other details of the 
appointment as described in the previous section. Or, if you’ve 
already set up an appointment and now need to change it to a 
repeating appointment, double-click the appointment to open it in an 
Appointment window.  
 2. 
 Click the Recurrence button on the Ribbon to display the Recurrence 
pop-up menu (see Figure  24-5 ). 

685
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 3. 
 If you want one of the recurrence types that appears on the pop-
up menu, click it—for example, Every Thursday or Day 8 of Every 
Month—and skip the rest of this list. (The items in the pop-up menu 
vary depending on the appointment’s context.) Otherwise, click the 
Custom item to display the Recurrence dialog box (see Figure  24-6 ).  
 4. 
 Set up the recurrence like this:
  In the Repeats pop-up menu, choose Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or 
Yearly, as needed. Outlook displays the appropriate controls in the 
Every area of the dialog box.  
  Use the controls in the Every area to set up the recurrence. For 
example, for a weekly appointment, you can set the number of 
weeks in the Every  N week(s) box, and then click the day in the On 
bar (for instance, click the second T button for Thursday). For a 
monthly appointment, use the controls in the On line to set the 
repetition, such as On First Monday or On Day 20. 
 Tip To set a weekly appointment to recur on multiple days, select those days in the On bar. For example, 
click the W button and the F button to create an appointment that recurs on Wednesdays and Fridays.
 Figure 24-5.   You can set up straightforward repeating appointments using the Recurrence pop-up menu. For more 
options, click the Custom item 
 Figure 24-6.   Use the Recurrence dialog box when you need to create a repeating appointment 
 
 

686
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
  In the Start box, enter the start date. Outlook uses the date you’ve 
specified for the appointment; you can change it if necessary.  
  In the End date pop-up menu, choose None, After, or By. For the 
After option, specify the number of occurrences, such as After 10 
occurrences. For the By option, pick the end date.  
 5. 
 Click the OK button to close the Recurrence dialog box and return to 
the Appointment window, which is now called Appointment Series. 
The Recurrence line appears below the other details giving the 
details of the recurrence (see Figure  24-7 ).  
 6. 
 Click the Save & Close button on the Ribbon to close the window 
and save the changes.  
 Scheduling Meetings 
 As you’ll remember from earlier in this chapter, Outlook considers an appointment that involves 
inviting other people or scheduling resources to be a meeting. Chances are you’ll need to 
schedule meetings of your own and respond to meeting invitations that other people send you.  
 Setting Up a Meeting 
 To set up a meeting, follow these steps:
 1. 
 Ctrl-click or right-click the meeting time in the schedule, and then 
click New Meeting on the context menu to open a Meeting window 
(see Figure  24-8 ).  
 Note  If you need to stop an appointment from recurring, open the Recurrence pop-up menu, and 
then click the Once only item. 
 Figure 24-7.   When you set up a repeating appointment, Outlook shows the details of the recurrence on the Recurrence 
line. You can click the rotating arrows icon at the right end of the Recurrence line to display the Recurrence dialog box  
 

687
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 2. 
 In the To box, enter the recipients for the meeting invitations. You can 
either type in the names (with Outlook suggesting matches) or click 
the button at the right end of the To box to display the Search People 
window, and then search as discussed in Chapter   22 . 
 3. 
 Type the subject for the meeting request in the Subject box, such as 
the name of the meeting.  
 4. 
 Type the meeting’s location in the Location box.  
 5. 
 Type any message about the meeting in the text box in the Message 
box at the bottom. For example, you may want to make clear what 
the meeting will cover, what attendees need to prepare, and so on.  
 6. 
 If you want to check schedule information, click the Scheduling 
button on the Ribbon. On the Scheduling tab (see Figure  24-9 ), you 
can see the information available about each participant’s schedule, 
which should help you pick a suitable time for the meeting. The 
information is available only if the participant gives you access to 
their schedule, such as in a company calendaring system.  
 Figure 24-8.   In the Meeting window, enter the recipients, the subject, the location, and the date and time for the 
meeting. In the Message box at the bottom, enter any message needed, and then click the Scheduling button on the 
Ribbon to display the Scheduling tab  
 

688
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 7. 
 When you’ve finished setting up the meeting invitation, click the 
Send button to send the meeting invitation.  
 Tracking the Status of Meeting Invitations You’ve Sent 
 After you send a meeting request, you’ll receive the responses that the invitees send. 
Outlook tallies the acceptances and refusals for you. To see a summary of the responses, 
double-click the meeting in your calendar to open it in a Meeting window, and then click the 
Scheduling button on the Ribbon to see the current status of the attendees:  
  A gray circle containing an ellipsis (…) indicates No Response.  
  A green circle containing a check mark indicates Accepted.  
  A blue circle containing a question mark indicates Tentative acceptance.  
  A red circle containing a cross indicates Declined.  
 Figure 24-9.   Use the Scheduling tab in the Meeting window to identify a suitable time for the meeting. You may be able 
to access schedule information for only some participants, as in this example  
 Note   If you need to make changes to the meeting before sending the invitation, click the 
Appointment button on the Ribbon to display the Appointment tab again. 
 

689
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 Normally, you can let Outlook manage the status for you. But if an invitee gives you a verbal 
response, you can update the status manually by clicking the button next to the invitee’s 
name and then clicking the appropriate item on the pop-up menu (see Figure  24-10 ). 
 Dealing with Invitations to Meetings 
 When someone sends you an invitation to a meeting, you receive an e-mail message with 
the details of the message and with a built-in mechanism for replying. Double-click the 
meeting message to open it in a Meeting window (see Figure  24-11 ).  
 Figure 24-10.   You can update the status for an invitee manually if necessary. Click the Refresh button to the right of 
the All Attendees heading to refresh the information with the latest updates  
 Figure 24-11.   When you receive an invitation, you can accept it, tentatively accept it, or decline it. Each pop-up menu 
lets you choose among responding with comments, responding without comments, and not sending a response 
 
 

690
CHAPTER 24: Managing Your Calendar
 Click the Accept button, the Tentative button, or the Decline button to display the associated 
pop-up menu, and then click the appropriate command:
  Respond With Comments : Click this item to start creating a message to 
which you can add comments before sending it.  
  Respond Without Comments : Click this item to send the response 
without adding comments.  
  Do Not Send a Response : Click this item to accept, tentatively accept, 
or decline this item in your calendar but not send a response to the 
person who invited you to the meeting. This action is occasionally useful 
for meetings that don’t need to receive your response, but most people 
find it confusing.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned how to use Outlook to schedule your appointments and keep 
your calendar in order. 
 You now know how to navigate the Calendar interface and make it show the dates you want 
in the way you want them to appear. You now know the difference between an appointment 
and an event, and you know not only what distinguishes a meeting from an appointment but 
also how to set up meetings and respond to meeting invitations. 
 In the next chapter, I’ll show you how to work with tasks and notes in Outlook. Turn the page 
when you’re ready to start.

 Chapter 25  
 Working with Tasks and 
Notes 
 In this chapter, I’ll show you how to work with tasks and notes in Outlook. 
 Outlook’s Task feature helps you get organized by defining tasks you need to complete and 
organizing them by priority, due date, or other criteria. You can create either one-time tasks 
or recurring tasks, keep notes in them, and mark them as complete when you finish them. 
 Outlook’s Notes feature is useful for jotting down information as you work and then sharing 
your notes with other apps. 
 Creating Tasks 
 In this section, you’ll learn how to work with Outlook’s  Tasks  feature. You’ll first meet the 
interface Outlook provides for working with tasks. You’ll then create new tasks and manage 
your tasks. 
 Meeting the Tasks Interface 
 To get started with tasks, click the Tasks button in the Navigation pane or press Cmd+4. 
Outlook displays the Tasks folder (shown in Figure  25-1 with several tasks added).  
 Note  At this writing, you must create each new task in Outlook. You can’t import or sync tasks 
from other sources, such as your To-Do items in OS X’s Reminders app or your tasks in Google 
Tasks. 

692
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 By default, Outlook displays the Reading pane on the right of the Task List. When you click 
a task in the Task List, the details of the task appear in the Reading pane. You can move 
the Reading pane to the bottom of the Outlook window by choosing Organize ➤ Reading 
Pane ➤ Bottom from the Ribbon, choosing View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Below from the menu 
bar, or pressing the Cmd+Shift+\ keyboard shortcut. You can hide the Reading pane by 
choosing Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Off from the Ribbon, choosing View ➤ Reading Pane 
➤ Hidden from the menu bar, or pressing the Cmd+Option+\ keyboard shortcut. When you 
need to return the Reading pane to the right side, choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Right 
from the Ribbon, choose View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Right from the menu bar, or press Cmd+\.  
 Creating One-Time Tasks 
 Outlook lets you create either  one-time tasks  —tasks that occur only once—or repeating 
tasks that recur on a schedule. This section explains how to create one-time tasks; the next 
section covers creating repeating tasks. 
 To create a task, you open a Task window and enter the details. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Open a Task window (Figure  25-2 shows an example) in one of the 
following ways:
  Choose Home ➤ New Task on the Ribbon.  
  Choose File ➤ New ➤ Task from the menu bar.  
  Press Cmd+N after clicking the Tasks button in the Navigation pane.  
 Figure 25-1.   Click the Tasks button in the Navigation pane to display the Task List

 2. 
 In the upper text box, type the task’s subject or description, such as 
 Buy white paint . 
 3. 
 Open the Due pop-up menu, and choose the date the task is due to 
be completed.  
 4. 
 If you want to enter a start date, open the Start pop-up menu, 
and choose the date the task will start. Setting a start date makes 
Outlook hide the task until the start date, which helps keep your Task 
List from being overwhelming.  
 5. 
 If you want to set a reminder for the task, click the Reminder control, 
and then set the time and date for the reminder.  
 6. 
 Type any notes about the task in the main box. You can apply 
formatting by using the context menu (Ctrl-click or right-click in the 
main box to display the context menu) or by using the Format menu.  
 7. 
 If you need to create a recurring task, click the Recurrence button, 
and then work as described in the “Creating Recurring Tasks” 
section later in this chapter.  
 8. 
 If necessary, change the task’s priority by clicking the High Priority 
button or the Low Priority button on the Ribbon. If you need to 
remove the priority you’ve set, click the button again.  
 9. 
 If you want to assign the task to one or more categories, click the 
Categorize button on the Ribbon, and then click the category you 
want, placing a check mark next to it. Repeat this move to add other 
categories as needed.  
 10. 
 Click the Save & Close button on the Ribbon to save the task and 
close the task window.  
 Figure 25-2.   Enter the details of the task in the Task window

CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 Creating Recurring Tasks 
 If your job includes tasks that repeat at regular intervals, you can set up  recurring tasks  to 
have Outlook remind you of them. Follow these steps:
 1. 
 Create a task as described earlier in this chapter.  
 2. 
 Open the task in a Task window.  
 3. 
 Click the Recurrence button on the Ribbon to display the Recurrence 
pop-up menu (see Figure  25-3 ). 
 4. 
 If you want one of the recurrence types that appears on the pop-
up menu, click it—for example, Every Monday or Day 28 of Every 
Month—and skip the rest of this list. (The items on this pop-up menu 
vary depending on the context.) Otherwise, click the Custom item to 
display the Recurrence dialog box (see Figure  25-4 ). 
 Figure 25-3.   You can set up straightforward repeating tasks using the Recurrence pop-up menu. For more options, 
click the Custom item 
 Figure 25-4.   Use the Recurrence dialog box to set up the schedule for a repeating task. The options vary depending on 
the item you choose in the Repeats pop-up menu  
 
 

695
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 5. 
 Set up the recurrence like this:
  In the Repeats pop-up menu, choose Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly, as 
needed. Outlook displays the appropriate controls in the Every area of the 
dialog box.  
  Use the controls in the Every area to set up the recurrence. For example, for 
a weekly task, you can set the number of weeks in the Every  N week(s) box 
and then click the day in the On bar (for instance, click the second T button 
for Thursday). For a monthly task, use the controls in the On line to set the 
repetition, such as On Second Tuesday or On Day 20.  
  In the Start date box, enter the start date. Outlook uses the date you’ve 
specified for the task.  
  In the End date pop-up menu, choose None, After, or By. If you choose After, 
specify the number of occurrences, such as After 10 occurrences. If you 
choose By, pick the end date.  
 6. 
 Click the OK button to close the Recurrence dialog box and return 
to the task window. The Recurrence line appears below the other 
details giving the information about the recurrence (see Figure  25-5 ). 
 7. 
 Click the Save & Close button on the Ribbon to close the window 
and save the changes.  
 Now that you’ve applied recurrence, the task recurs on the schedule you set. 
 Note   If you need to stop a task from recurring, open the Recurrence pop-up menu, and then click 
the Once only item. 
 Figure 25-5.   Outlook displays the details of a repeating task on the Recurrence line in the task window. To edit the 
recurrence, click the rotating-arrows icon at the right end of the Recurrence line

CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 Viewing, Arranging, and Filtering the Task List 
 If you have only a handful of tasks in the Task List, you’ll probably find it easy enough to 
view them all at once. But when you have many tasks, you may want to view only particular 
ones, such as those that are overdue or those you’ve given high priority. 
 Choosing Which Columns to Display in the Task List 
 To work quickly with the Task List, you can choose which columns appear in it. Outlook 
starts you off with a widely useful set of columns—Completed Status, Due Date, Item Type 
Icon, Priority, and Title—but you may need to add other columns.  
 To choose which columns appear, Ctrl-click or right-click any of the column headings 
displayed in the Task List. The context menu that opens (see Figure  25-6 ) shows a check mark 
next to each column that’s currently displayed. Click a column that doesn’t have a check mark 
to display that column, or click a column that does have a check mark to remove that column.  
 Rearranging the Columns 
 When you’ve displayed the columns you want to see, you can  rearrange  the columns into a 
different order if necessary. 
 To rearrange the columns, drag a column heading to where you want that column to appear. 
Outlook moves the other columns out of the way (see Figure  25-7 ). 
 Note  You can also choose View ➤ Columns from the menu bar and then click the items on the 
Columns submenu to add or remove check marks. 
 Figure 25-6.   You can customize the columns displayed in the Task List by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking a displayed 
column heading and then placing or clearing check marks on the context menu of columns  
 

697
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 Filtering Tasks to Show the Ones You’re Interested In 
 To view only the tasks you want to see, you can apply  filters  . For example, you can display 
only your High Priority tasks so that you can concentrate on them. 
 To filter the tasks, choose Home ➤ Filter Tasks to display the Filter Tasks pop-up menu, and 
then click the filtering you want. For example, choose Due Date ➤ Today (see Figure  25-8 ) 
to view tasks whose due date is today, or click the High Priority item on the Filters pop-up 
menu to display tasks you’ve flagged with High Priority. You can also use the View ➤ Filters 
submenu to set filters.  
 When you want to see all your tasks again, choose Home ➤ Filter Tasks ➤ Clear All Filters 
from the Ribbon or View ➤ Filters ➤ Clear All Filters from the menu bar. 
 Managing Your Tasks 
 To keep your Task List in order, you need to plow through it regularly, adding details to tasks, 
marking them for follow-up, and—when the time comes—marking them as complete. 
 Note   Another way to narrow down the list of tasks displayed is to go to the Folder pane and clear 
the check boxes for the categories you don’t want to see. 
 Figure 25-7.   You can rearrange the columns by dragging a column heading, such as the Categories column heading 
shown here, to where you want that column to appear 
 Figure 25-8.   To display only particular types of tasks, open the Filter Tasks pop-up menu on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon, and then choose which tasks you want to see, such as tasks whose due date is today 
 
 

698
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 Editing an Existing Task 
 Often, you may need to edit an  existing task  —for example, to add further details or to 
change the due date or priority. 
 To edit an existing task, either work in the Reading pane or double-click the task in the Task 
List to open a task window showing the details of the task. You can then change whichever 
aspects of the task you need to change. When you’ve finished, click the Save & Close 
button on the Ribbon to save the changes and close the task window.  
 Marking a Task for Follow-Up 
 If a task needs further action, you can mark it for follow-up at the appropriate time. You can 
quickly mark it for follow- up today, tomorrow, this week, next week, on no due date, or at a 
custom date of your choosing.
  Task List : Click the task, choose Home ➤ Follow Up from the Ribbon, 
and then click the follow-up date.  
  Task window : Choose Task ➤ Follow Up from the Ribbon, and then click 
the follow-up date.  
 Caution   The follow-up date is the due date for the project. If you don’t want to change the 
project’s due date, don’t mark the task for follow-up; instead, set a reminder to the appropriate 
time. If you change the due date by marking the task for follow-up, the task moves further down 
your Task List if you’re sorting the list by date. 
 Tip   You can also set follow-up for the current task by using the Task ➤ Follow Up submenu on 
the menu bar. 
 Tip   After you open a task in a Task window, you can quickly display the next task by pressing 
Ctrl+] or the previous task by pressing Ctrl+[. If the current task contains any unsaved changes, 
Outlook prompts you to save them. 

699
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
  Keyboard : Press Ctrl+1 to mark the selected task for follow-up today, 
Ctrl+2 for follow-up tomorrow, Ctrl+3 for follow-up this week, Ctrl+4 for 
follow-up next week, Ctrl+5 for follow-up with no due date, or Ctrl+6 to 
open the Dates and Reminder dialog box for setting a custom date for 
follow-up.  
 When you need to set a different date than any of the preset buttons offers, click the Custom 
item, and then use the Dates and Reminder dialog box (see Figure  25-9 ) to set the details of 
the follow-up.  
 Marking a Finished Task as Complete 
 When you have  finished  a task, select its check box in the Task List or in the task window. 
You can also click the Mark Complete button on the Home tab of the Ribbon for the Task 
List or on the Task tab of the Ribbon in a task window. 
 Taking Notes 
 When you’re working in Outlook, you may need to jot down scraps of information that you 
need to deal with later. To do this, you can use Outlook’s Notes feature. 
 Meeting the Notes Interface 
 To start using Notes, click the Notes button in the Navigation pane or press Cmd+5. Outlook 
displays the Notes pane (shown in Figure  25-10 with two notes created).  
 Note   You can delete a task by clicking it in the Task List and pressing Delete or choosing Home ➤ 
Delete from the Ribbon for the Task List or Task ➤ Delete in a task window. 
 Figure 25-9.   Use the Dates and Reminder dialog box to set a follow-up flag using the exact date and time you want 
 

700
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 By default, Outlook displays the Reading pane on the right of the Notes List; the Reading 
pane displays the text of the current note. You can move the Reading pane to the bottom 
of the Outlook window by choosing Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Bottom from the Ribbon, 
choosing View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Below from the menu bar, or pressing the Cmd+Shift+\ 
keyboard shortcut. You can hide the Reading pane by choosing Organize ➤ Reading Pane 
➤ Hidden from the Ribbon, choosing View ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Off from the menu bar, or 
pressing the Cmd+Option+\ keyboard shortcut. When you need to return the Reading pane 
to the right side, choose Organize ➤ Reading Pane ➤ Right from the Ribbon, choose View 
➤ Reading Pane ➤ Right from the menu bar, or press Cmd+\.  
 Creating a Note 
 To create a new note, follow these steps:  
 1. 
 Choose Home ➤ New Note from the Ribbon or press the Cmd+N 
keyboard shortcut with the Notes List displayed. Outlook creates a 
new note in a Note window. Figure  25-11 shows a new note with a 
title and some information entered.  
 Figure 25-10.   Use Outlook’s Notes feature to take quick notes as you work 
 

701
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 2. 
 In the box at the top, type the subject of the note.  
 3. 
 In the lower box, type the detail of the note.  
 4. 
 Click the Close button (the × button). Outlook prompts you to save 
the note (see Figure  25-12 ). 
 5. 
 Click the Save button. Outlook closes the note and adds it to the 
Note List.  
 Editing and Using Your Notes 
 To edit a note, click it in the Notes List. The note’s contents appear in the Reading pane, and 
you can edit them there.  
 If you need to edit two or more notes at once, open each in a separate window by double-
clicking the note in the Notes List. 
 Tip  You can also press Cmd+S to save the note as you create it and press Cmd+W to close the 
Note window when you’ve finished working with the note. 
 Figure 25-11.   Choose Home ➤ Note to create a new note, and then type the information in the note window 
 Figure 25-12.   Click the Save button in this dialog box to save the note you’re closing 
 
 

702
CHAPTER 25: Working with Tasks and Notes
 You can use the information you’ve saved in a note in any of these ways:
  Copy and paste a note’s contents : Copy the contents of the note, and 
then paste them into whichever app you want to use them in, such as 
Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint.  
  Send a note as an e-mail message : Click a note, and then choose Home 
➤ E-mail to create a new e-mail message containing the text of the 
note. Address and send the message as usual.  
  Forward a note : Click a note, and then choose Home ➤ Forward to 
create a new e-mail message with the contents of the note attached 
as a file in the HTML format. Address the message as usual, type any 
covering message needed, and then click the Send button to send the 
message.  
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you learned to work with tasks and notes. You now know how to organize 
your commitments by creating tasks, managing them, and marking them as complete. And 
you can quickly and easily take notes as you work and share them with other applications.
