Introduction
You’ve probably seen the ads. Canoodling 60-something couples —
all tanned and self-assured — sipping margaritas on deck. Smiling,
perfect families splashing in pools. Groups of friends with model looks
and zero body fat playing hoops. Is this for real?
We gotta be honest, not all cruise passengers are this attractive. Some
are, yes, but most are just like us. Regular ol’ folks that come in all shapes
and sizes. If there was ever a melting pot of a vacation, a cruise is it.
And that’s a part of a cruise’s appeal. Considering the majority of cruise
ships are huge suckers, carrying between 2,000 and 4,000 passengers
apiece, it’s no wonder they attract such a wide social swath. Sure, the
small ships and over-the-top luxurious ones stand apart from the crowd,
but most boil down to floating high-rise hotels. Before you wonder why
you don’t just go to a Sheraton then, consider that a cruise ship, no
matter its size, has its own unique allure.
The water. Yes, you float around vast undulating seas of deep blue water.
Hotels, of course, are planted firmly on the ground. Then there’s the fact
that you can move around and see three or four or five different coun-
tries or cities in a week. Can’t take that Sheraton island-hopping, now
can you?
While the newest ships are as modern as any Hyatt or Hilton, they’re
also steeped in maritime traditions that go back forever and lend even
the most high-tech ship some old-time charm. Massive steel anchors,
coils and coils of line, gangways, and that haunting moaning horn are as
relevant today as they were eons ago. Basically what we’re saying is that
swooshing through the waves in the middle of nowhere the way our
ancestors did — albeit with big diesel engines, GPS, and gin-and-tonics
delivered right to our hot tubs — is a pretty cool thing to do.
We should know: Between us we’ve done 150 cruises or so — a few
together, most apart, which is a good thing since we’re married to 
different people — to everywhere from the tried-and-true Caribbean to
far-flung mind-alternating places such as Siberia, the Galapagos, and
Thailand. We have our favorites for sure, but through the years we’ve
grown to appreciate just about all of ’em. Who can argue with a sunset
melting off the bow, fruity rum drink in hand? A cruise manages to both
throw you in the middle of the social fray and take you away from it all.
That all sounds fine and good, you may be saying, but what about your
fears of being stuck in a small dark cabin or getting seasick? Don’t worry
so much. Most cabins have windows and many have private balconies
too, so you can step out into the fresh sea air whenever the mood

strikes. Plus, who wants to spend a lot of time in a cabin when there’s
so much else to do around the ship. As for feeling queasy, allow us to
remind you, we’re well into the 21st century. Most ships are equipped
with stabilizers to keep them ultrasteady. Plus, most ships are so big
that chances are you’ll barely realize you’re moving at all.
At its basic core, a cruise is the antidote to worry and stress. A large
crew is aboard to take care of your cabin, your children, your appetite,
and that sore back of yours. From spas to playrooms, sushi bars, steak
houses, and movie theaters, you won’t be wanting for much. And if a
smaller ship is more your cup of tea, you’ll find fewer amenities, but
much more intimacy and really great itineraries. Pretty much, whatever
it is you want out of a vacation, you can find it on one of the hundreds of
ships out there, from rustic schooners to Vegas-style megaships and lux-
urious vessels covered in miles of marble and brocade.
The hardest part is dealing with all the “difficult choices” you’ll face
each day. Allow us to elaborate. Should you:
 Go to the gym and work out?
 Sit on the deck and chat with other passengers (or better yet,
watch other passengers — cruise ships are prime people-watching
opportunities)?
 Find a quiet place to read?
 Have a massage?
 Take a nap or watch a movie in your cabin?
 Join the men’s sexy legs contest by the pool?
 Get a haircut?
 Sign up for a wine-tasting seminar?
 Take one of the organized shore excursions on days when the ship
stops in port or just head off on your own?
With so much to do, you can’t possibly do it all, and who needs to. If
achieving your vacation nirvana means staring off into sea and doing
nothing, so be it. As a wise old salt once said, “Hey, whatever floats your
boat.”
And one more thing, cruising is a great value vacation: For one price,
you get your cabin, all your meals and entertainment, a slew of onboard
activities, and the chance to visit a bunch of different places and unpack
only once. Still, we have to be honest, you’ll likely spring for plenty of
extras once on board, from cocktails, soda, and bottled water to spe-
cialty restaurants, facials, craps, and lots more. Of course, the captain
isn’t forcing you to buy a new dress in the ship’s boutique or have your
hair done; that’s up to you and your willpower. For the most part, unless
you’re a totally penny-pinching, antisocial grouch, a cruise adds up to
one heck of an attractive vacation experience.

About This Book
We want to make sure that you have a totally relaxing and memorable
cruise vacation, which is why we got together to write this book. And we
gotta to tell you, all those research cruises we needed to take to become
such experts, well, it was just terribly grueling work . . . sweat sweat . . .
groan groan.
Okay, so we can’t expect sympathy. But we do want a little respect.
We’ve done our homework so that you don’t have to do. In the pages
that follow, we try to anticipate every question you may have about the
cruise experience and provide the answers. For first-time cruisers, we
describe what to expect from the cruise experience, pre-cruise to post-
cruise, with the nitty-gritty on everything from your first look at a cruise
brochure or Web site to clearing customs at the end of the trip. The goal
is to make the experience easy and familiar, even if you’ve never set foot
on a ship in your life.
If you’re not a first-timer, you probably picked out this book because you
don’t want to have to think much to plan your trip. And you won’t have
to if you read on. We’ve laid out everything you need to know in a style
that is quick and easy, yet exceedingly comprehensive.
Of course, you don’t have to read the whole book. And you don’t have
to start at the beginning either. This is a reference book. Check out the
table of contents or the index and read the parts that peak your interest.
The main point of this book is to show you that a cruise is just plain fun.
It’s not brain surgery, for Pete’s sake, to figure out that a cruise is a light
and easy and, typically, quite an addictive vacation choice. From the
time you walk up the gangway humming the theme from The Love Boat
to the time you get home, dump your suitcase on the floor, and take yet
another look at all those great pictures you took, it’s all about pleasure.
In the spirit of fun, we took the liberty of having some fun writing this
book. So, c’mon aboard and enjoy the ride. If you’re really not the type
who likes to smile or laugh, then you may want to look for your receipt
and take this book back to the store.
Introduction 3
Dummies Post-it
® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new ship, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it
® Flags included in this book to help
make your trip planning easier!

Conventions Used in This Book
This guide is designed for easy reference. We include reviews of all the
best cruise lines; overviews of the most popular cruise ports in the
Caribbean, Alaska, the Mediterranean, and some other destinations; and
a quick-and-easy introduction to everything you’re likely to experience
when planning and taking a cruise. The attractions, along with telephone
numbers, are often in bold type to draw your attention to them, and the
ship names appear in italic. If an attraction, hotel, restaurant, or what-
have-you has a toll-free number, we list that number first, in bold type,
right after a tiny little telephone, which looks like this: %.
For sanity (ours) and brevity, whenever we talk about temperatures, the
degrees are in Fahrenheit, and when we talk about prices, we mean U.S.
dollars unless otherwise noted.
People rarely pay full price for a cruise. That’s why when we list sample
rates, we list travel agency rates — the actual prices you’ll pay — not
the full brochure rate. Who knows why the lines inflate their brochure
rates only to sell their cruises at a discount anyway, but it’s an industry
tradition and, if nothing else, makes you think you’re getting a really
good deal. Usually, you really are.
We list the range of brochure prices based on the following three basic
types of accommodations:
 Inside cabin (one without windows)
 Outside cabin (one with windows)
 Suite
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and your
needs as a traveler. We assumed the following:
 You may be a virgin cruiser looking for some guidance while book-
ing your first cruise.
 You may be an experienced traveler who just wants some quick,
easy tips about planning a cruise.
 You may be an experienced cruiser who wants an easy-to-use guide
to the cruise lines (both big and small) and ports of call.
 You’ve cruised before in the Caribbean but want to try something
new, like Alaska, the Mediterranean, New England, or western
Mexico.

 You don’t have time to wade through volumes of detailed informa-
tion; you just want a book that cuts to the chase so that you can
easily find a ship best suited to your unique personality.
If you fit any of these criteria, Cruise Vacations For Dummies 2006 gives
you the information you want.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized in a roughly chronological fashion (although you
don’t have to read it that way), taking you from the basics of choosing a
cruise through the particulars. We detail the reasons you’re going to sea:
visiting great ports of call and having a ball on board as you sail from
one port to the other.
Part I: Getting Started
We start with the best of the best, our recommendations of top ships,
top destinations, and top things to do on board. We get into why a cruise
is a great vacation choice for most people and blow holes in some
common misconceptions about cruising — that it may be too expensive
or that you may get bored, for example. And we offer some suggestions
of how to find the cruise and cruise experience that best suits you.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise
Part II helps you start figuring out what your trip may cost. We take you
through the process of finding and booking a cruise, including when to
book it and how to find a good travel agent. We also tell you what you
need to know before you get on the ship — from buying travel insur-
ance, to getting there, to packing tips, to passport requirements and
how much cash to bring.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience
Part III covers what you can expect on board during your cruise, includ-
ing entertainment, food, spa offerings, shopping, gambling, and chil-
dren’s activities. And even though you don’t want to think about it yet,
this part also includes a synopsis of what you need to consider at the
end of your cruise, including tipping and Customs regulations.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships
Part IV discusses the major cruise lines and their vessels and offers
honest reviews to help you target the ship most likely to give you the
vacation experience you desire.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why
To find out where the ships sail from and to, check out Part V, which
offers specifics on points of embarkation and ports of call. We offer

days in the port city before or after your cruise, and we highlight the top
attractions and best shore excursions at the major ports of call in the
Caribbean, Alaska, the Mediterranean, the Mexican Riviera, Hawaii, and
New England and eastern Canada.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens includes our picks of the most classic onboard experi-
ences, as well as our personal favorite stories from years of professional
cruising.

Choosing Cruising: The
Best of the Best
In This Chapter
 Picking the top cruise lines
 Finding the best ships to fit your interests
 Charting the top ports around the world
I
n the decade-plus that we’ve been writing about cruises, we can’t
even count the number of times people have asked us, “So, what’s the
best cruise line?” And y’know what? We hate that question. We hate it
because there’s really no single answer. It’s like asking, “What’s the best
food?” or “What’s the best beer?” It all depends on your taste buds and
the kind of experience you want to have. Spicy? Adventurous? Healthy?
Indulgent? Or how about the cruise equivalent of a burger and a Bud?
That said, some cruise lines are clearly top-shelf, no matter what aisle in
the supermarket you’re browsing. And this is the chapter where you can
find ’em.
You can find the “Best of the Best” icon signaling the contents of this
chapter throughout the book.
The Best of the Mainstream Lines
Here’s the pick of the litter among the big boys. Turn to Chapter 11 for
more info.
 Royal Caribbean International: Royal Caribbean’s Radiance-class
ships (Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, and Jewel of the Seas) are its
most elegant vessels to date, combining a sleek, seagoing exterior;
a nautically themed interior; and acres of windows. The Voyager-
class ships (Voyager, Explorer, Adventure, Navigator, and Mariner
of the Seas) are the archetypal activities ships and maybe the first
vessels to satisfy the old “city at sea” cliché. The line’s new “ultra-
Voyager” ship, Freedom of the Seas, is scheduled to debut in April

2006 and will be an even bigger and more activity-packed ship than
its Voyager-class cousins.
 Princess Cruises: Princess’s huge but cozy Diamond Princess
and Sapphire Princess are the line’s most beautiful ships to date.
They combine gorgeous exterior lines with wood-heavy, old-world
lounges; an innovative dining plan; and a great covered promenade
that allows you to stand right in the bow. The smaller Coral Princess
and Island Princess are big winners, too, with similar décor and a
smaller size that lets them traverse the Panama Canal.
 Celebrity Cruises: With their elegant modern décor, incredible
spas, great service, and over-the-top alternative restaurants,
Celebrity’s Millennium-class ships (Millennium, Infinity, Summit,
and Constellation) are some of the best mainstream megaships
out there — classy yet affordable. Celebrity’s older Century-class
ships (Century, Galaxy, and Mercury) aren’t too far behind, either.
The Best Ships for Luxury
Got some bucks to spend? Wanna be treated like Charles and Camilla?
Here are your ships. Turn to Chapter 12 for all the details.
 Silversea Cruises: This line offers the best overall highbrow small
ships, with top-quality cuisine, roomy suites, and over-the-top 
service — including complimentary and free-flowing Philipponnat
champagne.
 Crystal Cruises: Crystal’s dream ships offer the best of two worlds:
pampering service and scrumptious cuisine on ships that are big
enough to offer plenty of outdoor deck space, generous fitness
facilities, four restaurants, and more than half a dozen bars and
entertainment venues. Crystal’s California ethic tends to keep the
atmosphere more mingly and chatty than aboard the more sober
ships, such as those from Seabourn and Silversea.
 Cunard: Queen Mary 2 (QM2) has her very own niche in the luxe
market — and in the cruise market as a whole, for that matter.
Although she’s too enormous to offer the kind of intimate luxury
you get with ships from Silversea, Seabourn, and SeaDream, she
can give you a pretty close idea of what life aboard the great old
ocean liners was like — a pretty luxe perk all in itself.
 Seabourn Cruise Line: Small and intimate, these quiet megayachts
lavish upper-crust guests with doting service (courtesy of 157
crewmembers to just 208 guests) and very fine cuisine. Staff mem-
bers greet you by name from the moment you check in, and your
wish is their command.
Part I: Getting Started 
10

 SeaDream Yacht Club: Even smaller and more intimate than
Seabourn, SeaDream’s 110-passenger yachts are also pitched to a
younger and more active demographic. Elegant but casual, they
carry along jet skis, mountain bikes, and kayaks for jaunts around
ports such as St. Barts and Monte Carlo.
The Best Ships for Families
The trick with family cruises is offering not just family-friendly activities
and entertainment, but offering things for adults to do, too, whenever
they can get away from the kids. These cruise lines do. See Chapter 9 for
info on family-oriented cruising activities and Chapters 11 and 12 for
more about the ships.
 Carnival Cruise Lines: Carnival has made the move from party line
to family line, with great kids’ facilities on the Destiny-, Spirit-, and
Conquest-class vessels.
 Disney Cruise Line: Well, duh. If Disney can’t do family right, who
can? This is the most well-developed children’s program at sea.
Kudos also to Disney’s adult activities, even though their ships do
without casinos in the interest of keeping kiddo on the straight and
narrow.
 Princess Cruises: The Coral Princess and Island Princess and the
Grand-class ships each have a spacious children’s playroom, a siz-
able piece of fenced-in outside deck for toddlers, and a deck with
a wading pool for older kids. Teen centers have computers, video
games, and a sound system, and the ones on the Grand-class ships
even have teen hot tubs and private sunbathing decks.
 Royal Caribbean International: Royal Caribbean’s Voyager-class
ships, with their rock-climbing walls, ice-skating rinks, in-line skat-
ing tracks, miniature golf, and full-size basketball courts, are the
absolute best choice for active families — particularly those
with teens. The onboard Johnny Rockets restaurants and main
street–like entertainment promenades hold kids’ interest pretty
well, too.
 Cunard: Strange but true, the classy QM2 also has great facilities
and programs for kids, starting at age 1. Aside from Disney, no
other line offers such extensive care for children so young. There’s
even a special daily children’s teatime that’s perfect as an early
dinner, and programming is free up until midnight daily.
The Best Romantic Cruises
Some cruise lines cater to the amorous more than others. Here are our
top picks:
Chapter 1: Choosing Cruising: The Best of the Best 11

 Star Clippers: With the wind in your hair and sails fluttering over-
head, the top decks of the four- and five-masted Royal Clipper and
Star Clipper provide a most romantic setting. Below decks, the
comfy cabins, lounge, and dining room make these ships the most
comfortable adventures on the sea. See Chapter 13.
 Windstar Cruises: Pure romance is a day with your loved one in a
private cove or another secluded spot with one of Windstar’s big
sailing ships anchored offshore. Windstar offers a truly unique
cruise experience, giving passengers the delicious illusion of adven-
ture (by stopping at small coves and such), along with relatively
sizable small vessels and high-quality cuisine and service. See
Chapter 13.
 Cunard: Like real royalty, QM2 was born with certain duties atten-
dant to its station, and one of the biggest of those duties is to
embody the romance of transatlantic travel and bring it into the
new century. Take a stroll around that Promenade Deck, dine in
that fabulous dining room, and thrill to be out in the middle of the
Atlantic on nearly a billion dollars worth of Atlantic thoroughbred.
See Chapter 12.
 SeaDream Yacht Club: SeaDream’s small SeaDream I and II are
ultraluxe in a languidly romantic sort of way, with comfy Balinese
daybeds lining the teak decks, free-flowing champagne, and a table
for two anytime you want it. See Chapter 12.
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises: Well, what is romance, anyway?
For some folks it’s luxury and baubles. For others it’s a trip cross-
country on their Harley, stopping to catch the view at every scenic
overlook and then finding a good bar at night. That sound like you?
Windjammer’s your cruise line. See Chapter 13.
The Best Party Cruises
Looking for a party at sea? Try one of these cruise lines:
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises: Erotic tart-eating contest, anyone?
Okay, so that’s only on their singles cruises, but you get the idea.
On regular cruises, the free rum punch, cheap beers, and visits to
legendary Caribbean beach bars make sure you’ll be reeling like the
proverbial drunken sailor, if that’s your thing. See Chapter 13.
 Carnival Cruise Lines: What, you thought Carnival’s ships were
called “The Fun Ships” because they could tell a good joke? Back
in the day, this is where you went for a full-time party cruise.
Things have toned down a lot since then, but the pool deck is still
bustling, and the discos and nightspots hop until the early morning
hours — especially on the short 3- and 4-night weekend cruises.
See Chapter 11.

 Royal Caribbean International: As with Carnival, lots of Royal
Caribbean’s customers are in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, with short
cruises drawing the hardier partiers. For an exciting Saturday-night-
out-on-the-town barhopping kind of experience, the Voyager-class
ships feature a multideck, boulevard-like promenade running down
their centers, lined with shops, bars, cafes, and entertainment out-
lets. See Chapter 11.
 Norwegian Cruise Line: NCL’s newest ships are designed to give
the illusion of a night out in the big city, with ten restaurants, tons
of bars, a clipboard full of activities, and some of the best entertain-
ment at sea. An added plus: The ships all have casual dress codes
and open-seating dining, creating more mingling opportunities. As
on Carnival and Royal Caribbean, it’s the short 3- and 4-night itiner-
aries on their older ships that keep the party funkin’ right. See
Chapter 11.
The Best Small-Ship Cruises
If the big ships aren’t your thing, slide on over to one of these small-ship
operators, who put more of an emphasis on learning about the destina-
tion than on shopping, sightseeing, and Big Whoopin’ Fun. See Chapter 13
for the scoop on each.
 Maine Windjammer Association (Maine coast): Owner-operated
historic schooners sailing along one of the prettiest stretches of
coast in the whole country — how do you top that? It’s like summer
camp for adults, with a rustic vibe and real, live wind in your hair.
 Clipper, Cruise West, Lindblad, and American Safari Cruises
(Baja/Sea of Cortez): For cruise ships, Mexico’s Baja Peninsula is
like the bizarro Alaska. It’s where the small ships (and the hump-
back whales) go for winter, substituting Baja’s red dirt, cacti, and
ruggedly beautiful coastal islands for Alaska’s moss, rain forests,
and glaciers.
 Delta Queen (Mississippi River): Mark Twain fan? Head for Delta
Queen, operating three real Mississippi River stern-wheelers that
look so in-place on the river that you’ll think you’ve gone through a
time warp. Bonuses? Cajun and Southern cooking, river storytelling,
and a calliope to complement a music program full of Dixieland jazz
and swing.
 Lindblad Expeditions (Antarctica, Galapagos, and other exotic
destinations): This preeminent small-ship line for a really adventur-
ous, learning-oriented experience is all the better for its recently
formed alliance with the National Geographic Society. The Society
gets a permanent presence on the sea, and Lindblad gets a slew of
scientists, photographers, and other lecturers to wow guests.
Chapter 1: Choosing Cruising: The Best of the Best 13

 Glacier Bay Cruiseline (Alaska): Glacier Bay Cruiseline’s tiny
Wilderness Explorer and slightly larger Wilderness Adventurer are
the best for exploring wild Alaska, carrying a fleet of sea kayaks
and orienting their itineraries almost entirely toward wilderness
areas, with passengers kayaking and hiking almost every day.
 Cruise West and Clipper Cruise Line (Alaska/Russian Far East):
Want a real expedition? Cruise West’s Spirit of Oceanus and Clipper’s
Clipper Odyssey offer 2-week cruises that sail from mainland Alaska
across the Bering Sea to far-eastern Russia, also taking in remote,
little-visited islands along Alaska’s western coast. It’s like sailing
right off the map of civilization.
The Best Ships for Uncompromising
Gourmands
Food and cruising go hand and hand. Find the best dining on these
cruise lines:
 Crystal Cruises: Although all the food you get on Crystal’s ships is
first-class, their reservations-only Asian specialty restaurant on
Serenity is the best at sea, with cuisine overseen by Master Chef
Nobuyuki “Nobu” Matsuhisa. The accouterments help set the tone,
too — chopsticks, sake served in tiny sake cups and decanters,
and sushi served on thick blocky square glass platters. An Asian-
themed buffet lunch, offered at least once per cruise, gives passen-
gers an awesome spread, from jumbo shrimp to chicken and beef
satays to stir-fry dishes. See Chapter 12.
 Seabourn Cruise Lines: Nothing quite compares to dining on the
outdoor deck of Seabourn’s Veranda Café, which offers casual din-
ners most nights. With the ships’ wakes shushing just below, you
have a rare opportunity to dine with the sea breezes and starry
night sky surrounding you. Asian, Mediterranean, and steakhouse-
style menus are featured. See Chapter 12.
 Silversea Cruises: Depart at sunset from port, and the windowed,
candlelit Terrace Cafe alternative restaurant on each of this line’s
four ships becomes a window to the passing scenery and a home
for some of the best food at sea. Reservations are required for the
theme menus: Asian night starts with sushi and sashimi, and a
French feast begins with foie gras, followed by a scallop and rata-
touille salad, beef tenderloin, and a warm chocolate tart with rasp-
berries. Excellent wines and all spirits are included in the cruise
rates. See Chapter 12.
 Radisson Seven Seas Cruises: The award-winning chefs aboard all
the line’s ships produce artful culinary presentations that compare
favorably to those of New York’s or San Francisco’s top restaurants,
and the waiters are some of the industry’s best. See Chapter 12.
Part I: Getting Started 
14

 Celebrity Cruises: Among the mainstream lines, it doesn’t get any
better than the intimate, elegant, reservations-only alternative
restaurants on Celebrity’s Millennium-class ships, with their arti-
facts from classic Golden Age ocean liners, their doting waiters,
their tableside cooking, and their musicians playing elegant period
pieces. The experience takes about three hours and costs $30 a
person, but it’s well worth it. See Chapter 11.
 Oceania Cruises: Oceania’s dining experience is near the top in the
mainstream category, with menus created by chef Jacques Pepin,
and passengers able to dine at any of four different restaurants,
all of them excellent. Service is doting and fine-tuned, even at the
casual semi-buffet option, offered on an outdoor terrace that’s 
elegant and totally romantic at sunset. See Chapter 11.
The Best Ships for Spa Addicts
One company (Steiner Leisure) runs the vast majority of cruise ship
spas, but facilities vary. Here are your best bets.
 Celebrity Cruises: Celebrity’s Millennium-class and Century-class
ships are at the top of the spa heap. Their huge, beautiful AquaSpa
facilities manage to combine a huge repertoire of the latest wraps,
packs, soaks, and massages with striking aesthetics inspired by
Japanese gardens and Moorish and Turkish bathhouses. See
Chapter 11.
 Windstar Cruises: Considering the Wind Surf’s intimate, 308-
passenger size, she has a surprisingly large and well-accoutered
spa facility, with prebookable spa packages combining six or more
treatments tailored to both men and women. See Chapter 13.
 Royal Caribbean: The two-level spa complexes aboard the line’s
Voyager-class ships are among the largest and best accoutered
there are, and not just for the peaceful waiting area with its New Age
tropical bird-song music. The Radiance-class ships have huge, exoti-
cally themed solariums and 13 treatment rooms, including a special
steam-room complex featuring heated, tiled chaise longues and spe-
cial showers simulating tropical rain and fog. See Chapter 11.
 Radisson Seven Seas: The spas aboard the 490-passenger Seven
Seas Navigator and 700-passenger Seven Seas Mariner and Seven
Seas Voyager are some of the few not run by the ubiquitous Steiner.
Instead, the French spa company Carita imports staffs and hair-
dressers from Parisian salons. See Chapter 12.
The Best Ports of Call
You don’t spend all your cruise time on the water. The following ports
are particularly intriguing:
Chapter 1: Choosing Cruising: The Best of the Best 15

 In the Caribbean: We like Cozumel for its wonderful Mexican
flavor, party atmosphere, great buys on crafts, nearby ruins, and
excellent snorkeling. Key West is a hoot-and-a-half with its raucous
bars, funky history, great seafood, and cast of street performers
and other characters. St. Barts is exclusive, pretty, lush, and loaded
with celebrities, while St. John (U.S. Virgin Islands) is more natural,
with half its land preserved as a national park. See Chapter 15.
 In Alaska: Sitka and Juneau are our favorites. Juneau has to be the
prettiest state capital anywhere in America, fronted by the Gastineau
Channel, backed by Mount Juneau and Mount Roberts, and other-
wise surrounded by wilderness, including the huge Juneau Icefield
and the Mendenhall Glacier. Sitka, a little off the beaten path, and
thus less overwhelmed by cruise passengers, is a gorgeous little
town packed full of Russian, American, and Tlingit Native history.
See Chapter 16.
 In the Mediterranean: Venice is our favorite, a city where every
view is museum-quality. For history, you can’t top Athens or Rome.
For quaintness, you can’t beat Portofino (Italy); for dramatic port
scenery, there’s Santorini (Greece); and for shopping, there’s
Ku@adasi (Turkey), with its wonderful rugs at affordable prices, not
to mention its proximity to Ephesus, an amazing ancient archeolog-
ical site. Other faves include Barcelona and Istanbul — both
impressively exotic. See Chapter 17.
 On the Mexican Riviera: Call us cheesy, but we like Cabo San Lucas,
with its beaches, bars, beaches, bars, and beaches. For more authen-
tic Mexican culture, give us Mazatlan’s historic district, with its
shady streets, opera house, and rugged coastline. And then there’s
Puerto Vallarta, with its lovely seaside promenade and profusion of
art galleries. See Chapter 18.
 In Eastern Canada and New England: Newport, Rhode Island, is
classic New England with its cobblestone streets and colorful
yachts. It’s no wonder America’s bluebloods built so many absurdly
ornate mansions here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. If
you like ships, Halifax, Nova Scotia, is maritime central, with a great
museum featuring a raft of Titanic artifacts and tons of other shippy
stuff. Perched on a cliff-top overlooking the St. Lawrence River,
Quebec City, Quebec, is just about the prettiest port of call in North
America, very French and full of culture. The oldest part of the city
dates back nearly 400 years. See Chapter 18.
 In Hawaii: Honolulu makes a great embarkation port, with leg-
endary Waikiki Beach, cool shopping, and the moving memorials at
Pearl Harbor. For natural beauty, Kauai is hard to beat, but if your
idea of fun is trekking around a bunch of volcanoes, it’s the Big
Island for you. See Chapter 18.

ruising is like comfort food — that pizza, meatloaf, baked ziti, or
double cheeseburger you order when life gets too stressful. It’s like
a shot of Prozac mixed with a ride on the Ferris wheel. It’s a mai tai in
the Jacuzzi while the tiki torches dance. It’s a chance to see the world
while remaining in your comfort zone. It’s a chance, for once in your
tweaked-out 21st-century life, to not have to plan anything at all. The
captain’s on his bridge and all’s right with the world. The only question
left to answer is whether cruising is for you.
The History of Cruising, from Soup to Nuts
Time was, hardly anybody would ever say they were going on a cruise
unless it was around a bay in their sailboat. Those were the old days,
when stepping aboard a ship meant you had places to go and things to
do, and that ship was the only way to get from point A across the ocean
to point B. Sometimes that wasn’t a very pleasant experience.
Cruising before cruising was cruising
In 1842, author Charles Dickens, along with 86 others, booked passage
on the mail ship Britannia, operated by Samuel Cunard, founder of the
Cunard Line. Writing in American Notes about his journey from Liverpool
to Nova Scotia and then to Boston, Dickens described the quarters as
coffinlike and his fellow passengers as of varying shades of green —
though he claimed he only felt woozy, not full-on seasick.
Conditions had improved by the time Mark Twain took a transatlantic
voyage on the steamship Quaker City in 1867. Twain described his cabin

as having “room to turn around in, but not to swing a cat in, at least with
entire security to the cat.” In The Innocents Abroad, Twain wrote, “If
there is one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and insuf-
ferably self-conceited, it is to have his stomach behave himself, the first
day at sea, when nearly all his comrades are seasick.”
It wasn’t until late in the 19th century that shipping companies realized
they could make money not just by transporting travelers, cargo, mail,
and immigrants from point A to point B, but also by selling a luxurious
experience at sea. Most historians agree that the first real cruise ship
was P&O’s Ceylon, which in 1881 was converted to a lavish cruising
yacht for carrying wealthy, adventurous guests on world cruises. Six
years later, a Scottish company launched the St. Sunniva, the first
steamer built expressly for cruising. But cruising was still a sideline. The
big money was to be had in selling passage from place to place, both for
the rich and for the huddled masses booking cheap steerage berths.
That was the state of things for eight decades, as the steamship era
entered its golden age, weathered two world wars, and plugged along as
a vital link between the continents — the only way to get from here to
there and back again. It was a time when images of glamorous ship travel
made their way into the popular imagination, and everyone wanted to
be out at sea with the big movie stars, taking in the sea air and the giddy,
tuxedo-clad nightlife.
Between the mid-1930s and the late 1950s, many steamship (and later
cruise ship) traditions were born and became entrenched: shuffleboard,
bridge, Ping-Pong, onboard movies, pool games, bingo, art classes,
dance lessons, singles’ parties, midnight buffets, and cocktails, cocktails,
cocktails. Things were swingin’, and everyone thought it would go on
forever. They were wrong.
Entering the modern cruise era
In 1958, a sea change occurred when Pan Am flew the first nonstop jet
flight from New York to Paris. In the blink of an eye, passenger liners
went from being the only game in town to being a slowpoke anachro-
nism. Shipping companies scrambled to fill berths any way they knew
how, and pleasure cruising formed a big chunk of their survival strategy.
It helped, but not enough — especially for older ships like the original
Queen Mary, which had been built without air-conditioning. Within ten
years, most of the world’s liner fleet would be mothballed or sent to the
breakers. Only the strong survived — and the innovative.
In 1966, Ted Arison, who would later form Carnival Cruise Lines, and Knut
Kloster, who would later form Norwegian Cruise Line, introduced the
Sunward, a converted car/passenger ferry that debuted as a Caribbean
cruise ship. The Sunward began offering 3- and 4-day cruises from Florida
to the Caribbean and back again, and the success of the venture quickly
drew competition.
In the years that followed, established lines such as Cunard and Holland
America adapted their Old World–liner mentality to cruising, while brash
Part I: Getting Started 
18

new lines such as Carnival rebuilt cruising from the ground up, creating
the kind of fun-in-the-sun, cruise-ship-as-vacation-destination experience
that’s dominated the market for the past three decades. In 1977, the
young cruise industry got a big boost when ABC debuted its TV series
The Love Boat, which set up yet another new paradigm: cruise ship as
romance machine. Using the real ships Island Princess and Pacific Princess
(of the young Princess Cruises) as floating sets, the show was a veritable
commercial for cruising, shown weekly in prime time for a full hour.
Cruising today
Today we’re in another place entirely. While Carnival’s vessels still offer
their proven fun-ship formula, and Princess still occasionally trots out
The Love Boat cast as spokespeople, the cruise industry has grown out-
ward to encompass options for almost everybody. Yes, you can still do
the glitzy Vegas thing, but you can also sail on ships that are nearly as
grand and formal as the Golden Age ocean liners. Yes, you can do a
weekend party cruise, but you can also sail to the jungles of Central
America on a small expedition ship. Today’s largest vessels are (get this)
about four times the size of the Titanic, with onboard amenities such as
lavish gyms and spas; intimate, reservations-only restaurants; multiple
entertainment options, from big production shows to intimate music
recitals; and sports options such as golf, basketball, and (on some of the
Royal Caribbean ships) rock-climbing and ice skating. In 2004, Cunard
introduced a planetarium aboard its new Queen Mary 2, while Princess
started showing movies on a drive-in-style screen above the Pool Deck.
Meanwhile, smaller lines began offering cruises to parts of the world you
may not ever get to otherwise, such as Libya and Siberia.
Cruising: What’s In It for You?
Today, people choose a cruise vacation for a variety of reasons: It’s easy
to plan; it’s like having a full-time designated driver; you get to visit dif-
ferent towns and countries without having to schlep from hotel to hotel;
somebody told them it was a good bargain; or their Uncle Bob told them
it was a blast. Whatever your reason, you’re in good company.
No matter your reason for sailing, you’re buying the same basic commod-
ity from almost all the cruise lines: relaxation. Sure, getting aboard the
ship that first day can be a hassle (see Chapter 6), but after you get
through that ordeal your experience should be relatively stress-free —
just unpack your bags and the rest of the week is yours. No need to make
dinner plans, since the kitchen crew is busy preparing more than you’ll
ever be able to eat — and it’s included in the price. No need to buy tick-
ets to the theater, since it’s right down the corridor and free for all, just
like the nightclubs and discos. No need to even carry cash, since practi-
cally all ships charge extras — bar bills, excursions, spa treatments, gift
shop purchases, casino losses — to your onboard account, to be settled
up later.
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 19

A resort by day . . .
Cruise lines learned long ago that they’re not just competing with each
other; they’re also competing with land-based resorts. Consequently,
they’ve pretty much figured out how to offer almost anything a land
resort does, except at a speed of 20-plus knots. Most cruise ships (aside
from the small adventure vessels) give you big honkin’ spas armed with
hot rocks, warm muds, and a slew of bizarro treatments that make you
feel like warm, happy jello. They give you huge children’s playrooms and
teen centers designed to keep your kids occupied while you go all 
jellolike. When jello time is over, the ships offer activities that range
from silly pool games and craft classes to lectures, computer work-
shops, cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, dance classes, and even
scuba instruction. Depending on the ship, sports enthusiasts may find
jogging tracks, volleyball, basketball, paddle tennis, water polo, aqua
aerobics, rock-climbing, ice- and in-line skating, and even bungee tram-
polines, the latter on Royal Caribbean’s Enchantment of the Seas. Oh, and
of course there’s always shuffleboard. Old habits die hard.
Want more? How about video arcades and movie theaters showing
recent releases? Or live sports events beamed by satellite to the ship’s
sports bar? Or just lounging by the pool or on your private balcony,
reading The Da Vinci Code. Oh, wait, you read it already? Silly us . . .

Pondering cruise growth 
conspiracy theories
In 1980, the U.S. cruise biz catered to less than a million and a half passengers — and
that was at the height of The Love Boat buzz. By 1990, that number was up to 3.6 mil-
lion, and 15 years later it’s over 10 million. What’s to account for the surge? More
leisure time? Hardly. Americans are working more now than they ever have.
Disposable income? Are you kidding, with gas over $2 a gallon? Baby boomers getting
older and not being able to hoist their own packs anymore? Nope, cruise demo-
graphics have fallen over the past decade, with the average age now down around 50.
We put it down to a confluence of events. First, a ton of new ships were built over the
past decade, most so much bigger and so much more technologically amazing than
their predecessors that they were almost guaranteed to attract attention. Second, all
those ships were in competition with each other, which meant cruises were selling
for insanely low prices. Third, some cruise lines hatched really, really good advertis-
ing campaigns (yo, Royal Caribbean, good job). And fourth, the world went completely
NUTS, with terrorism and wars and famine and misery and global warming and invad-
ing armies and terror alert levels and duct tape and who knows what all else; and in
an environment like that, who wants to go trekking off on their own? It’s the “cruise
ship as protective bubble” syndrome.
Or, maybe people just like to cruise. That’s another theory.

. . . A place to keep your stuff while in port
Now remember, you won’t be on the ship all the time, so chuck that “I’d
go nuts stuck on a ship for a week” excuse right now. Most weeklong itin-
eraries spend two days at sea, allowing you to do all the activities we
just talked about, and spend the other four days visiting ports, where
you can either wander off on your own or sign up for one of the line’s
organized shore excursions. Generally you arrive in the morning and
depart just after dinner — enough time to get a gander at the local
sights, spend some time on the beach, head off into the woods looking
for wildlife, or whatever it is people do in the hundreds of port cities and
towns the cruise lines visit worldwide.
. . . And an urban playground by night
Nighttime is one of the liveliest times on a cruise ship. You have the mul-
ticourse dinner to look forward to, for one thing. Then, depending on the
ship, you can check out the show, hit the comedy club, dance (or try to),
win at the casino (or try to), sing the hits at a karaoke session (or try
to), or just throw back a few stiff ones at one of a dozen bars. You can
get through the night as cheaply or as expensively as you like, because
even though the cruise lines have begun offering a lot of added-cost
extras, the basics of the experience — food, entertainment, and most
activities, are still free, free, free.
Keepin’ It Fresh: What Keeps ’em
Coming Back
Cruise ship years are like dog years — they don’t last as long as people
years. As a result, most of the ships that are carrying those 10 million
annual cruisers have been launched within the past ten years, during
a frantic period of construction that finally began winding down in
2005. With bookings up and the need decreasing to fill more new ships,
prices — which were ridiculously low through 2003 and into 2004 —
finally started leveling off in 2005. Oops! You missed the big bargains!
But don’t worry, it’s still a good deal, and the cruise lines are busy
adding other new stuff besides ships, to make sure your interest stays
piqued.
Like what? Think new destinations, new activities on and off the ship,
new dining options, and new entertainment. Some other trends? How
about extensive refurbishments of older ships, bringing them more in
line with what the newbies offer. Royal Caribbean got the ball rolling on
this with its big 2003 refurb of the 1991 ship Monarch of the Seas, fol-
lowed by redos of Empress, Sovereign, and Enchantment of the Seas —
the latter of which was chopped in half and welded back together with a
new midsection, increasing her size substantially. Holland America also
got into the revitalization act big-time in 2004 and 2005, upgrading its
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 21

older vessels to the standards of its new “Signature of Excellence” initia-
tive, with comfier cabins, a new culinary arts center, new restaurants
and Internet cafes, and vastly improved kids’ and teens’ facilities. Disney
teen centers also got the supersizing treatment.
Speaking of Disney, and other brand names, cruise lines have been
busily associating themselves with established brands over the past
year, hoping to hitchhike on their name recognition. Celebrity Cruises,
for example, teamed up with Cirque du Soleil to bring its brand of fan-
tasy circus magic to the line’s megaships. Norwegian Cruise Line
(NCL) followed by announcing a partnership with the famed Second
City improv comedy group. Over at Cunard, the cobranding was with
London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, whose graduates and students
perform short plays and offer readings, workshops, and acting classes
on QM2’s transatlantic crossings. The ship’s Cunard ConneXions learn-
ing program also includes informal talks by instructors and lecturers
from Oxford University and elsewhere, while programs in the ship’s plan-
etarium have been created by NASA, the American Museum of Natural
History, and others.
Finally, the cellphone trend has the most potential to annoy, while also
providing a real cost saving to travelers. It used to be that the only way
to call home from a ship was via satellite phone at a cost of $8 or $9 a
minute. In 2004 and 2005, though, Costa, NCL, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity,
and Crystal’s Crystal Serenity all installed technology that allows passen-
gers use of their cellphones out at sea, at a cost of roughly $1.70 per
minute. At press time, Carnival, Holland America, and MSC were also
looking into the matter, so expect evvvverybody to have phones beeping
soon. We reap what we sow.
Seeing the world
You can cruise around North America, Central America, South America,
Europe, Scandinavia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the South Pacific,
Australia, New Zealand, and even the Arctic and Antarctica — pretty
much wherever there’s water. If you’ve got a few months (and bucks),
there are even world cruises that take you all the way around the globe.
In this book, we highlight the most popular cruising regions: the
Caribbean and Mexican Riviera for classic fun-in-the-sun vacations;
Alaska for the wilderness, wildlife, Native culture, and scenery; the
Mediterranean for history; eastern Canada and New England for charm
and fall foliage; and Hawaii for, well, paradise.
Travelers on a longer leash can sail to the edges of the cruise world, 
hitting historic and politically edgy locales such as Libya, Lebanon,
and Syria; exotic stops such as Vietnam, Tahiti, and Morocco; totally
bizarro spots such as Siberia; and all-American waterways such as the
Mississippi River and the Erie Canal.

Sailing from everywhere
We’re New Yorkers, so we’re busy and important and stressed-out and
don’t like to be hassled any more than we already are, ya know? That’s
why we’re thrilled that we can now hop on our bikes or grab a cab and
be at the passenger-ship terminals in Manhattan or Brooklyn in about
ten minutes. Is that great or what? No flying, no long security lines, and
no shelling out hundreds of bucks for tiny airplane seats and no free
lunch.
That’s the idea behind the so-called alternative homeporting or home-
land cruising deployments the cruise lines have been following over the
past few years. Last count, there were more than 20 homeports on the
U.S. mainland, from where you could sail to Bermuda, New England,
eastern Canada, Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, Alaska, Hawaii,
Mexico, and Europe. Moving beyond the traditional homeports in, for
example, Florida, other cities that host big cruise ships on a regular
basis include Anchorage (AK), Baltimore (MD), Bayonne (NJ), Boston
(MA), Charleston (NC), Galveston (TX), Los Angeles (CA), New York
(NY), Norfolk (VA), Philadelphia (PA), San Diego (CA), Seattle (WA), and
Whittier (AK) are all hosting big cruise ships on a regular basis, and
we’re not even mentioning the countless other cities that serve as home-
ports for the small, specialized ships. The upshot is that unless you live
in Nebraska, there’s a good chance you can drive to your ship, saving
yourself both time and money. And even if you do fly, the alternative
homeports give you an opportunity to check out more of the country,
rather than just sailing from Miami for the umpteenth time.
Appealing to all types of travelers
Who cruises? According to the cruise lines’ central marketing group, the
average cruise passenger is 50 years old, but 26 percent of cruisers are
under 40. Eighty-three percent of cruise passengers are married, with an
average household income of about $99,000.
Although demographics vary from cruise line to cruise line and some-
times from ship to ship, there’s a ship for pretty much any kind of
person who’s looking for one. The mainstream lines are the great gener-
alists, providing something for just about everyone — which, along with
their generally reasonable prices, explains why they’re the big choices
for multigenerational family travel.
If you’re pickier but still have a hankering for the sea, consider a luxury
line or a specialty small-ship line, the former tailored to the connoisseur
mindset, the latter mostly to public radio types who want a human-scale
learning experience. A few lines defy categorization, such as small 
sailing-ship line Windjammer. Let’s just say they attract iconoclasts.
Appealing to all wallet sizes
So the $64,000 question is, do cruises cost $64,000? Nope.
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 23

Though prices have been climbing after the inverse bubble that reigned
from 2001 to 2003, at press time rates for weeklong Caribbean and
Mexican Riviera cruises were still starting at around $600 per person
based on double occupancy (two people sharing a cabin). Starting rates
for Alaska cruises were between $750 and $850, and Mediterranean
cruises started at around $1,000. Shorter cruises typically start at about
$299 for a 3-night sailing, while prices for weeklong luxury and small-
ship cruises typically start around $2,000 per person and up (sometimes
way, way up) from there.
Your fare includes your accommodations, three meals a day (or six, if
you can eat that much), a plethora of onboard activities, use of pools and
gyms, nighttime entertainment, and travel among interesting ports of call.
Overall, it adds up to great value and convenience — but don’t assume
everything’s included. Travel expenses to and from the ship are generally
not. Nor are shore excursions (except aboard some small-ship adventure
lines), and they can easily cost $500 or more during the week. Bar drinks
aren’t included except aboard some luxury lines, and can run . . . well, that
depends on you, as does the amount you’re willing to risk in the casino or
drop in the spa for a facial, massage, or mud wrap. Gratuities for the crew
are not included on most lines, which pay their service staff minimal
salaries on the assumption that they’ll make most of their pay in tips.
Generally, expect to tip about $70 to $100 per person during a weeklong
cruise. (For more on tipping, see Chapter 4.)
To beef up their bottom lines, cruise lines push a slew of added-cost
extras such as intimate alternative restaurants, specialty coffees, name-
brand ice cream, fresh flowers, golf-swing analysis, wireless Internet con-
nection, wine tastings, custom-tailored suits, specialty exercise classes
(boxing, spinning, Pilates, yoga, tai chi, and the like), and personal train-
ing sessions. These extras could run your tab up into the stratosphere if
you succumb, but therein lies the trick: They’re optional. Aside from gra-
tuities, which you really should leave to keep your karma balanced, you
could step aboard a ship, spend not one red cent extra during your
whole trip, and still have a great time. It’s all up to you.
Answering the Cruise Naysayers
Maybe you want to go on a cruise (you’re reading this book, after all), but
your significant other is putting up resistance with one excuse or another.
We’ve heard most of them, and have found that those excuses are often
based on long-held misconceptions. Here are the most common excuses,
and our patented Matt-and-Heidi answers to beat them back with.
I’ll be bored!
When people tell you this, they probably think they’ll be on the ship
24/7. Not so. Unless you take a transatlantic crossing with no port calls,
you’re off the ship almost as much as you’re on, observing places and
cultures you may never have seen before. Typical weeklong cruises
Part I: Getting Started 
24

spend four of their six full days in port, with the other two at sea, either
because it takes a while for the ship to get to its next port or just for the
heck of it. We’ve found, through long experience, that being on vacation
can be really, really tiring, so a couple days at sea are a good thing, let-
ting you loll around and rest up. Do you see us complaining about
having to sit at the bar and drink beer all day? You do not.
I’ll get fat!
Although the rumor is that most people gain about five pounds on a
weeklong cruise, you only do that if you, uh, sit around at the bar and
drink beer all day . . . or hit every eating opportunity — of which, admit-
tedly, there are many. Way many. So to paraphrase Goethe, repeat after
us: “Self-restraint is the first mark of the master.” And if you can’t forego
dessert or that plate of nachos between meals, at least make deals with
yourself: If I eat that, I won’t take the elevators today. If I drink that, I’ll
go to the gym for an hour, or sign on for a challenging shore excursion,
like mountain biking, kayaking, or hiking.
I’ll get seasick!
Well, then you don’t have to worry about getting fat, do you? But hon-
estly, folks, most cruise ships nowadays are so large and well stabilized
that you can barely tell you’re on water. You probably won’t have any
problems unless you’re extremely sensitive or the ship passes through
rough water. In some places you hardly ever get rough seas — Alaska’s
Inside Passage, for example, which, like the name says, is inside, mean-
ing protected by barrier islands from the ocean’s waves.
If you do feel queasy, try taking an over-the-counter medication such as
Dramamine or Bonine. Most ships stock medicines for less sea-hardy
passengers, and you can sometimes get them free from the purser’s
office. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe for you the Transderm
patch. Alternative remedies include ginger capsules (available at health
food stores) and acupressure wristbands, which most pharmacies carry
and which our frequently seasick friend Cindy swears by.
Cruise ships are too crowded!
Two answers to that one: First, that’s just not true of all big ships, and
second, you can’t even generalize by saying the ships with the most pas-
sengers are the most crowded. We’ve spent weeks on huge ships, such
as Royal Caribbean’s 3,114-passenger Explorer of the Seas, and have
been amazed at how uncrowded they were. Put it down to good design.
On the other hand, we’ve felt squeezed on much smaller ships that were
just not as well designed. To get a rough idea of how crowded a ship will
feel, divide its tonnage by its total passenger capacity to arrive at the
passenger-to-space ratio.
If you’re really concerned about crowds, book aboard a small ship, most
of which carry fewer than 100 passengers. There aren’t as many diver-
sions on board, but that’s kind of the point: On these ships, people go to
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 25

get focused on the places they’re visiting, not diverted from them. Small-
ship cruises almost always cost more than megaship cruises, but you
tend to have fewer onboard costs. Sometimes excursions are even
included in the rates.
Cruise ships aren’t safe!
As we were putting together this book, a 70-foot rogue wave smacked
into NCL’s Norwegian Dawn off the coast of Florida. Seventy feet! That’s
like, seven stories. That’s a big wave. It made all the newspapers, and
much was made of the fact that water was sloshing around in 62 cabins,
but the fact was that the only real damage was to a few forward-facing
windows, which broke under the impact and let in all that water. There
was no structural damage at all. So figure, if a ship can shrug off a 70-foot
wall of water smacking into it, it’s pretty safe. When it comes to fire
safety, cruise ships operate under international rules known as Safety of
Life at Sea (SOLAS), which enforce rigorous standards for fireproofing
and safety equipment.
To make sure ships are up to safety snuff and comply with emergency-
response requirements, the Coast Guard conducts rigorous quarterly
inspections of all ships operating from U.S. ports. To check out what
those requirements are, visit the consumer section of the Coast Guard’s
Web site at www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/cruiseship.htm. To make sure
passengers know what to do in case there is an emergency, ships are
required to hold an emergency safety drill within the first 24 hours of
sailing. Everyone aboard is required to participate, trying on their
orange life jackets and trotting out to their assigned lifeboat stations.
They let anybody on those things. There’s no security!
Way wrong. Waaaaaay wrong. We make our living writing about ships
and are no strangers to the ports in New York, but even we’ve been
turned away when someone forgot to put our name on the official list.
That was true before 9/11, and it’s even truer now.
Between 2001 and 2004, new regulations went into effect that mandated
a no-visitors policy (excepting passengers and others on a pre-approved
list); x-ray of all hand-carried bags; screening of checked bags; the use of
sniffer dogs; a security zone of at least 300 feet around all cruise ships,
plus concrete barriers; patrol boats and sometimes Coast Guard escorts
at some ports; and the screening of all ship’s stores, mail, and cargo
before they’re brought aboard. Many of these systems were already in
place at most cruise lines and ports, so passengers generally didn’t
notice much difference. Other changes have been made in the back
office, including a rule that ships must submit a complete list of passen-
gers and crew to the Coast Guard 96 hours before arriving at a U.S. port.
Internationally, new regulations issued by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) require all ports around the world to operate within
a consistent framework to address security issues.
Part I: Getting Started 
26

On board, all the major cruise lines have their own security forces, who
monitor people as they come aboard (passengers, crew, delivery people,
and contractors) and who keep an eye out during the cruise. We’re not
just talking about the kind of rent-a-cops you see at your local conven-
ience store, either. Some lines have hired former Navy SEALs as top-level
security consultants, and have hired Gurkhas, the famed Nepalese fight-
ers, to assist officers at the gangway and be on hand as needed.
On a day-to-day basis, passengers may notice ship security mostly when
boarding, both initially and at the ports of call. Most cruise lines photo-
graph passengers digitally at embarkation and then match pictures to
faces every time they get back aboard thereafter. Digital passcards also
allow them to tell instantly who’s aboard at any given time.
What if I get sick!?
Nearly every ship carrying more than 100 passengers has a medical facil-
ity staffed by a doctor and a nurse who are ready to handle health emer-
gencies. The biggest ships now carry two doctors and between two and
four nurses to handle the large number of passengers, and some facili-
ties have become quite elaborate. Just like at home, a ship’s medical
center has set office hours, but doctors are on call 24 hours a day
should an emergency arise. Most shipboard ailments are fairly minor,
such as seasickness, a sprained ankle, or the flu (ships stock antibiotics
for the latter), but the doctors can also perform minor surgery if neces-
sary. Should you develop a serious medical problem, you’re taken off the
ship at the nearest port for treatment or possibly flown by helicopter to
Chapter 2: Is a Cruise for Youse? 27
Smoking at sea . . . or not
While you may picture the classic sailor as a leathery tan guy with a cigarette hanging
out of his mouth, today he’ll likely be sipping a diet soda and wearing sunscreen. Like
most places shoreside in America, all ships covered in this book prohibit smoking in all
restaurants, theaters, and many other public places such as shops and the library. If you
want to light up, most bars and lounges have smoking sections, and you’re free to have
a cig out on deck. You can also have a butt in your cabin or on your balcony.
Now, if you’re looking for a nonsmoking cabin because you’re concerned with the lin-
gering smells from a previous smoker, with a few exceptions, you’re out of luck. The
vast majority of cruise lines do not designate cabins smoking or nonsmoking (with the
exception of Disney, which designates all cabins nonsmoking). Why? It’s impossible
to control (honestly, there is no real way to stop someone from booking a nonsmoking
cabin and then keep them from smoking anyway). Further, it would be a big fat
headache for the cruise lines’ inventory department — how many cabins should be set
aside for smokers? Do they sit empty if not enough smokers book the cruise? Luckily,
cabins are cleaned well between cruises, if necessary by shampooing the rug and
using air purifiers. Matt, a fairly smoke-sensitive nonsmoker, can’t recall ever walk-
ing into a cabin and smelling residual smoke.

a hospital. The latter can cost big bucks, so if you’re at risk of medical
problems while away, you should invest in travel insurance to cover
away-from-home emergencies. (For details about travel insurance, see
Chapter 4.)
Most small ships (those discussed in Chapter 13) don’t carry onboard
medical staff when sailing coastal, river, or geographically close inter-
island cruises, because they can evacuate sick passengers quickly.
Usually, some crewmembers have nursing or first-aid experience.
Small ships always carry doctors when sailing more far-flung interna-
tional itineraries.
And what’s with that Norwalk virus?
The stomach bug known as Norovirus (also known as Norwalk-like
virus) made a lot of headlines between 2003 and 2005 when outbreaks
caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea on several ships. Here’s the
scoop: Norovirus is an extremely common bug that hits about 23 million
Americans every year, mostly on land. It’s also extremely contagious.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), people infected
with Norovirus can pass the bug on from the moment they begin feeling
sick to between three days and two weeks after they recover, and they
can pass it on hand-to-hand — meaning the cruise ship outbreaks were
probably caused by contagious passengers coming aboard and touching
a banister. No matter how clean the cruise lines keep their ships — and
they keep them pretty darn clean — they can’t catch every germ. Our
advice? Take your cruise, but wash your hands frequently.
If you’re particularly neurotic about cleanliness, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) regularly inspects cruise ships arriving at
U.S. ports for conditions and practices that could lead to food contami-
nation, and grades the vessels, with 86 the minimum passing mark. How
ships score is posted at www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp.
What if I need to stay in touch?
Don’t worry about it. We live in a world where people are obsessed with
staying in touch, so you can bet the cruise lines have gotten on board
with the issue — and figured out how to make a few bucks on it. Onboard
cellphone service is the newest thing, available on Costa, NCL, Royal
Caribbean, Celebrity, and Crystal’s Crystal Serenity, and probably coming
to most other lines soon. In addition, all but the smallest small ships have
an Internet center for surfing and e-mailing (costing between 50¢ and
$1.50 per minute), and most ships offer satellite news on in-room televi-
sions. Many also continue the tradition of printing a daily news sheet
with headlines from major newspapers and/or wire services. And as a
last resort if you absolutely have to get through to someone, almost all
ships offer direct-dial satellite phone service from your cabin, though it
costs an arm and a leg. People can call you on the ship, too, though that
also entails a large fee.

A
s we say in Chapter 1, that “What’s the best cruise line?” question is
the same as asking, “Where’s the best place to go on vacation?” The
answer to the latter, of course, is going to be different depending on who
you are and what you like to do on vacation. For instance, we’re fairly
sure the pope wouldn’t want the same kind of vacation as, say, Hugh
Hefner. And they probably wouldn’t like the same kind of cruise either.
We’ve been out there. We’ve seen the pope’s kind of cruise and we’ve
seen Hef’s, and everything in between, too. We’ve schlepped our suit-
cases onto just about every kind of passenger vessel there is, from
adventure ships in Alaska to megaships on the Mexican Riviera, sailing
ships in New England and the Mediterranean, and practically everything
that floats in the Caribbean. So while you may get all goo-goo-eyed over
the cruise lines’ snazzy brochures, with their snazzy models sipping
snazzy cocktails under a snazzy sun, remember that they aren’t your
best tools for making choices about a ship or destination. We are, and in
this chapter we give you the lowdown on some strategies for finding a
cruise that fits you like a glove.
Choosing Your Cruise
Almost all cruises can be divided up into three basic categories — main-
stream cruises, luxury cruises, and adventure and educational cruises —
though within each category there are various subdivisions.

Mainstream cruises
These are the cruises you see in TV commercials, with giant ships cruis-
ing around to people-pleasing ports while up to 3,000 passengers par-
take of the amazing bells and whistles the cruise lines have developed
over the past decade: rock-climbing walls, ice-skating rinks, pottery stu-
dios, planetariums, multi-million-dollar art collections, water parks, up
to ten different onboard restaurants, suites like Park Avenue apartments,
and spas that make you want to melt. And don’t forget all the rest: the
pool, the gym, the kids’ programs, and the constant activities. For all
that, these are also the most affordable ships, with cruises frequently
starting around $500 a week per person.
Among the mainstream lines, the onboard vibe ranges from party central
to country-club casual. The latter companies frequently promote them-
selves as “premium” lines — and sometimes they even deserve the term,
with a more refined atmosphere and better cuisine and service than their
more mass-market cousins. Though in many cases the premium lines
operate ships that are comparable in size and amenities to the mass-
market ships, some premium lines have stuck with smaller, more intimate
vessels of the type that were more common in the early to mid-1990s.
Other distinctions within the mainstream world? Well, consider the fol-
lowing alternatives:
 Family cruises: Some cruise lines specialize in family vacations,
planning activities for all age groups. Naturally, they attract the
biggest crowds during summers, holidays, and other school break
periods.
 Party cruises: On these voyages — often three or four nights long,
covering a long weekend — it’s all about energy, with passengers
grooving to the pool band all afternoon (often fueled by the day’s
drink specials), then staying up dancing and lounging late into the
night.
 Romantic cruises: Almost any cruise can be romantic if you’re in
the right frame of mind, but some sure do help you get in the mood.
Some lines also promote romance with onboard wedding, honey-
moon, or vow-renewal packages.
See Chapter 11 for details on all the mainstream lines.
Luxury cruises
Almost every cruise line uses the word “luxurious” in its advertising, but
only a few really are. With mostly small and intimate vessels, these true
luxury lines are the closest thing you can find to a five-star hotel, cater-
ing to discerning travelers who don’t blink at paying top dollar to be
pampered with exceptional service, refined décor, luxurious accommo-
dations, a sophisticated ambience, and fine French, Italian, and Asian
cuisine that often rivals that of respected shoreside restaurants. There
Part I: Getting Started 
30

are generally fewer organized activities — folks attracted to this kind of
experience presumably want a quieter, more self-motivated cruise — but
when activities and entertainment are offered, you can bet they’re more
dignified than on the mass-market ships. No hairy-back contests here.
No way.
With the exception of Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) and Queen Mary 2
(QM2) and Crystal’s Crystal Harmony and Crystal Serenity, these high-end
vessels tend to be on the smallish and more intimate side, carrying
between 100 and 1,000 passengers. You’re not likely to feel lost in the
crowd, and the staff gets to know your likes and dislikes early on. The
onboard atmosphere is much like a private club, with guests trading trav-
eling tales and meeting for dinner and drinks — the latter often included
in the cruise price, as these lines are much more all-inclusive, price-wise,
than your usual mass-market and premium lines. But of course, you pay
for all that inclusiveness, with prices rarely dipping lower than $2,000 per
person, per week.
Though the luxury lines are more alike than they are different, we can
still think of them in a few distinct groupings:
 Old-money lines: And by “old” we mean the passengers as much as
their money.
 Active luxury lines: The focus may be on taking out a Waverunner
or sailboard more than on putting on a tux for evening cocktails.
 Family luxury lines: While kids are a rarity on most luxury lines,
the larger Crystal ships sometimes attract as many as 100 children
on holiday cruises, and have playrooms to keep them occupied.
Cunard’s QM2 sees even more underage passengers, all the way
down to age one. The youth staff even includes two or three British
nannies who have completed a special two-year program in England.
See Chapter 12 for details on all the luxury lines.
Adventure and educational cruises
If getting in-depth knowledge about a destination tops your list of priori-
ties, a small-ship cruise may be for you. These ships rarely carry more
than 200 passengers, and rather than overwhelming you with unrelated
activities and whoop-de-do, they tailor almost everything about the trip
toward furthering your knowledge about the place you’re visiting. You
can attend informal lectures, participate in guided nature walks or his-
tory tours, go kayaking or tidepooling, or simply stand out on deck and
look — most of these ships sail coastal or river routes, so you can usu-
ally find an abundance of nature right off the port bow.
Though their ships are small, these trips usually aren’t cheap, with the
most expensive ones hovering in the $4,000 range for a week. Midrange
small-ship operators take the nut down to about $2,500, while a few
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 31

operators of sailing ships (like Windjammer Barefoot and the Maine
Windjammer Association) offer some trips for $500.
Within the small-ship world you can find a few variants:
 Learning cruises: Some lines go full-throttle into the educational
aspects of travel, with onboard experts from leading nature publi-
cations offering lectures and helping with interpretation of the nat-
ural world. Others focus on history.
 Active-adventure cruises: Did you know you could take cruises
that avoid civilization almost entirely, putting you out in pristine
coves where you can kayak all day, or on uninhabited islands where
you can hike the shoreline and head into the interior? It’s like the
anti-cruise, but because it’s offered on a boat, it counts.
 Sailing ships: Four lines in this book offer cruises on ships with
actual sails, though how much they actually rely on those sails for
propulsion varies from “some” to “completely.” The feel of real sail-
ing pretty much mirrors that equation, too, though the simple fact
that there are sails makes these cruises special.
Gauging Your Time Away
Though cruises are available that range from two nights to several
months, weeklong itineraries are the industry’s bread-and-butter, and
are also a nice round number around which to wrap your vacation. Most
ships sailing weeklong itineraries depart on a Saturday or Sunday after-
noon and return early the following Saturday or Sunday. However, book-
ing a 3- or 4-night getaway is a good alternative to a full-week cruise —
especially if you’re traveling by ship for the first time or simply don’t
have the cash for a longer cruise. Many cruise lines offer an array of pre-
and post-cruise packages that make it easy to plan a weeklong land-sea
vacation, with (for instance) three nights at sea and four at a hotel in
Miami or Disney World.
With only one major exception (Disney), the shorter the cruise, the
more party-oriented the passengers tend to be — something to keep in
mind if you’re looking for a quiet time.
Picking a Destination
At least as important as deciding what kind of cruise experience you want
is deciding where you want to go. The most popular cruising region in the
world is the Caribbean and the Bahamas, followed by the Mediterranean,
Alaska, the Mexican Riviera (also known as western Mexico), other
European destinations, Hawaii, South America, Bermuda, and eastern
Canada/New England. See Part V for specifics on each destination.
Part I: Getting Started 
32

Here’s the hot sheet on each destination:
 The Caribbean: Fun, sun, beaches, colonial history, Mayan ruins
(on itineraries that include ports in Mexico and Belize), tropical
landscapes, seafood, and drinks with little umbrellas in them
 The Mediterranean: History, culture, occasional big party scenes
(think Ibiza, Palma, and so on), and gorgeous scenery (think Greek
Isles)
 Alaska: Massive glaciers, massive whales, massive forests, massive
sky, massive salmon, rich Native Alaskan culture, good microbrews,
and the remnants of Russian colonial history and U.S. frontier culture
 The Mexican Riviera: The Caribbean for left-coasters, with as
much sun, as much fun, some great Mexican culture and history,
and a whole heck of a lot of tequila
 Other European destinations: History and culture in the Baltics,
gorgeous fjords in Scandinavia, beautiful scenery in the British
Isles, and total European charm on river and barge cruise routes in
France, Germany, and Belgium
 Hawaii: Paradise, paradise, paradise, beaches, incredible scenery,
volcanoes, Hawaiian history and culture, surfing, ukeleles, aloha
shirts, amazing coffee, and drinks served in hollowed-out coconuts
 South America: Urban culture, Amazon mystery, the Girl from
Ipanema, suntan oil, rain forests, incredible music, rum
 Bermuda: British men in shorts, powdery pink sand beaches, great
golf courses, friendly atmosphere, shopping for English wool and
Irish linens, and great history
 Eastern Canada/New England: New England charm, whales, lob-
ster pots, Victorian mansions, lighthouses, historical sites, and
fall foliage
Warming up to a Caribbean cruise
If you want a tan — and some palm trees, rain forests, interesting cultures,
and great shopping — consider cruising in the Caribbean. The biggest
draw is the climate, which is so temperate that cruises run year-round,
but there’s also (depending on the island) volcanic peaks, Mayan ruins,
winding mountain roads, beautiful tropical flowers, great beaches, and a
laid-back vibe. On a big ship in the Caribbean, expect to visit three to five
islands during a 7-night cruise, which leaves one to three days spent at
sea — your chance to participate in shipboard activities or just relax.
Typical itineraries
Most Caribbean cruises are a week long, though you can also find 5-, 6-,
8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-night sailings. You can also find shorter 3- and 4-night
cruises, though these often concentrate on port in the Bahamas (which
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 33

are technically not in the Caribbean at all, though they may as well be,
climate-wise), either visiting Nassau and/or Freeport or stopping at one
of the cruise lines’ private Bahamian islands.
Itineraries usually stick to one region of the Caribbean, either eastern
(typically calling on some combination of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto
Rico, St. Martin, and the Bahamas), western (usually Grand Cayman,
Jamaica, Key West, either Cozumel/Playa del Carmen, Calica, or Costa
Maya [Mexico], and sometimes ports in the Central American countries
of Belize and Honduras), or southern (less defined, but often departing
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and visiting Aruba, Curaçao, Barbados, St.
Lucia, Antigua, and/or Grenada). Small-ship cruises frequently visit the
less-developed islands, mostly in the eastern and southern Caribbean,
including the beautiful British Virgin Islands and ports such as St. Barts,
Dominica, Nevis, and the tiny islands of the Grenadines.
In addition to the usual Florida homeports (Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Port
Canaveral, and Tampa), Caribbean cruises are also sailing these days
from San Juan, Puerto Rico; Galveston and Houston, Texas; Mobile,
Alabama; Norfolk, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; New York, New
York; and other ports. Smaller, more adventure-oriented lines offer
Caribbean itineraries that depart from the Caribbean islands themselves
(you fly to the island to catch the ship) and visit less-touristed ports.
We go into greater detail about Caribbean itineraries in Chapter 15.
Caribbean sailing seasons
Caribbean cruises sail year-round, with the greatest number of ships
operating between late October and April.
High season runs from the third week in January to right around the
Easter/spring-break period. The sailings most likely to sell out, however,
are those during school holidays, such as Christmas and New Year’s and
during the summer season. You’re sure to see lots of families aboard
then, and lots of kids.
If you’re anxious about hurricane season, which runs from approxi-
mately June 1 to November 1 in the Caribbean, you can take solace in
the readiness of modern satellite warning systems to alert ships to any
danger. Although ships usually have plenty of time to steer clear, you
may be in for a slightly bumpier ride and a cancelled shore excursion or
two, especially if you’ve booked activities like snorkeling. In extreme
cases, your ship may have to change course, skipping one or more of the
islands on its planned route. Sometimes the ship can arrange to visit
another port on those days. Sometimes you just get another day at sea.
In some rare instances, brewing or active storms may prevent a ship
from returning to its homeport, and you may have to take a longer trip
back from another port. In cases like this, the cruise line covers any
added costs of getting you home.

Acting Alaskan: Heading north to the 49th state
Need we say it? Travelers don’t go to Alaska for fun in the sun. Even in
August it’s frequently cold enough to warrant a fleece pullover and a
raincoat. Instead, they go because it’s there, and it’s big, full of enormous
glaciers, unbelievably enormous mountains, huge humpback whales
leaping from the sea, bald eagles soaring overhead, and forests that
seem to go on forever. The culture of Alaska’s Native peoples figures in,
too, with the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian tribes influencing daily life in
Southeast Alaska (the site of most Alaska cruises) and the Athabascan,
Aleut, Alutiq, Yu’pik, Cu’pik, and Inupiaq peoples figuring in the life of
the Interior and northern coastal areas.
Days on an Alaskan cruise are typically spent either exploring one of the
ports (on your own or via shore excursions such as kayaking, mountain
biking, river rafting, helicopter or floatplane flightseeing, salmon fishing,
or dog sledding) or cruising around one of the state’s myriad natural
wonders, including Glacier Bay National Park, Tracy Arm Fjord, or prime
whale-watching areas. Unlike on a Caribbean cruise, there’s actually
something destination-oriented to do on days at sea here.
Because they’re harder to get to, and generally cost more than a cruise
in the Caribbean or the Mexican Riviera, Alaskan cruises tend to attract
an audience in the 55-plus age group, though increasing numbers of fam-
ilies have also been sailing north in recent years.
Typical itineraries
Most Alaska cruises concentrate on the Southeast Alaska panhandle, a
string of islands that stretches from Ketchikan in the south to Yakutat in
the north, with British Columbia to the east and the vast reaches of inte-
rior Alaska and Canada’s Yukon Territory to the north.
Cruises round-trip from Seattle or Vancouver, British Columbia, are typi-
cally known as Inside Passage cruises, for the waterway that connects
Southeast Alaska’s thousands of islands. Highlights of most itineraries
include glaciers (famous Glacier Bay or several others), the old prospec-
tor town of Skagway, state capital Juneau, and boardwalked Ketchikan in
the south. Small-ship cruises frequently visit much smaller towns and
wilderness areas on the Inside Passage, and some avoid civilization
almost entirely.
Cruises that sail north- or southbound between Vancouver and either
Seward and Whittier (both of which serve as port towns for Anchorage)
also sail through the Inside Passage, but are often known as Gulf of
Alaska cruises, in recognition that their route frequently takes in the
sights on that body, including College Fjord and Hubbard Glacier.
We detail the best things to see and do at Alaska’s ports in Chapter 16.
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 35

Alaskan sailing seasons
Cold weather the rest of the year limits Alaska’s tourist season to the
summer (generally mid-May through mid-Sept), although smaller ships
may venture out as early as late April. The warmest months are June,
July, and August, when temperatures generally range from 50 to 80
degrees during the day with a slight dip at night. Temperatures on the
water can feel considerably colder. During the shoulder-season months
(May and Sept), travelers can take advantage of lower rates.
Meandering the Mediterranean
The Mediterranean — whose ports include Barcelona and Palma in the
west and Athens and Turkey in the east, plus everything in between — is
a destination for people who appreciate history and culture. Your jour-
ney introduces you to buildings, monuments, and sometimes whole
cities that date back thousands of years; small towns where you can sit
at a cafe and take in the local scene; and high culture — from some of
the world’s greatest art museums to some of its finest gourmet restau-
rants, plus excellent shopping (if the value of the dollar ever gets close
to the Euro again, that is). The ports are close together, so large ships
may stop at a different port every day, or even visit two ports in a single
day, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. Frequently, you
may also stay in a port late into the evening (giving you a chance to
check out the nightlife) or even stay for two days, giving you longer to
get a feel for the place. Many Mediterranean itineraries last longer than
one week, and having more than one sea-day a week is rare.
Sailing in Europe provides a much more diverse experience than you can
find in the Caribbean or Alaska, and the ship’s passenger mix reflects the
international flavor. Your fellow travelers are likely to be an assortment
of older passengers, younger couples, families, and honeymooners,
often from several continents.
Activities center on museum hopping, touring ancient ruins, and absorb-
ing a cultural landscape steeped in history. Depending on the ship, activ-
ities may also include water sports.
Typical itineraries
Mediterranean itineraries vary greatly, but most ships leave from
Barcelona, Athens, Istanbul, Rome (actually Civitavecchia, which is a
port near Rome), or Venice. Some small ships sail from the Greek Isles
or from smaller ports in Turkey or France.
Cruises range from 3-day sailings around the Greek Isles to 10- or 12-day
voyages that visit ports in both the eastern and western Mediterranean.
Also available are plenty of 7-day options that focus on a single region.
Three regions make up the cruising territory of most lines: the western
Mediterranean, the Greek Isles/eastern Mediterranean, and the Riviera.
Part I: Getting Started 
36

Some ships offer itineraries that take in all the areas; others concentrate
on a particular locale.
The area typically described as the western Mediterranean stretches
from Barcelona (or sometimes Lisbon, Portugal, over on the Atlantic) to
Civitavecchia, and includes port calls in Spain, France, and Italy.
The Greek Isles/eastern Mediterranean area includes the Aegean Sea
and sometimes the Adriatic, with ports including Piraeus (near Athens),
the Greek Isles (Rhodes, Santoríni, Mykonos, and so on), and Ku@adasi
and/or Istanbul (both in Turkey). Some cruises also visit Venice and
Dubrovnik, Croatia.
Riviera itineraries include such French ports as Nice, Cannes, and Saint-
Tropez; the tiny country of Monte Carlo; and small Italian Riviera ports
such as Portofino. Riviera cruises may also include Rome (Civitavecchia).
On a smaller ship, you hit some of the same ports as the big ships do, but
you may also stop at smaller towns such as Portofino and Portoferraio in
Italy.
See Chapter 17 for details on all the major Mediterranean ports.
Mediterranean sailing seasons
The Mediterranean cruise season generally runs from April through
November, although some operators cruise there year-round.
Temperatures in-season can reach 80 degrees or higher, but nice breezes
along the coast help refresh you. Greece and Turkey are the hottest, and
if you don’t enjoy warmer weather, you should visit these countries from
April to June or mid-September through the end of October.
Doing the Romantic Cruise Thing
Imagine leaning against the rail with your new spouse, sipping cham-
pagne as a picture-perfect Technicolor sunset paints the horizon. That’s
a winner in almost everybody’s book, and it’s why cruises are such a hot
pick for honeymooning couples.
Besides their inherent romance, cruises are a good honeymoon choice
for a more prosaic reason: Many of them depart on Sunday, meaning
couples who marry on Saturday can leave the next day, and let their 
parents and bridal parties worry about cleaning up.
Getting married aboard ship
Bet you think ship captains can conduct weddings any time they please,
right? Wrong. That’s a common misconception, and in truth the only
cruise ship captains today that conduct regular ceremonies are aboard
Princess’s Diamond-, Coral-, and Grand-class ships. Those vessels even
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 37

have cute little wedding chapels, and your friends back home can watch
the ceremony via an Internet webcam.
More common, however, is for ships to bring a clergyman or a civil offi-
cial on board at an embarkation port to conduct your ceremony, either in
a public room decorated for the occasion or (aboard the aforementioned
Princess ships and Royal Caribbean’s Voyager-class ships, Carnival’s
Spirit-class ships, and NCL’s Norwegian Sun, Star, Dawn, and Pride of
America) at a dedicated onboard wedding chapel. Your friends can come
aboard to see you get hitched, then either see you off on your honey-
moon cruise or come along for the ride.
You can also get married shipboard at a port of call, such as a Caribbean
island. Some lines also help you arrange a wedding off-ship in the islands,
on the beach, by a tropical waterfall, or in some other scenic spot.
Wedding packages generally start around $750 for shipboard ceremonies
and usually include the services of an officiant (though you can bring
your own if you prefer), a bouquet and boutonniere, champagne and
keepsake glasses, a wedding cake, and the services of a photographer
(but not the photos themselves — those cost extra, should you choose
to buy them). The $750 package offered by Carnival — one of the big
leaders in shipboard weddings — accommodates eight people including
the bride and groom. Prices go up from there based on the complexity
and size of your reception (from a simple open bar and hors d’oeuvres
to a formal meal) and by port, with the top price being $2,145. Additional
guests can be accommodated at a rate of $24 per person. You can also
arrange for a ceremony off-ship in port, at higher prices.
Keep in mind that you need to make arrangements for the ceremony, the
reception, and your wedding license well in advance. Some lines have
special wedding departments that help you with the details; others rely
on outside wedding coordinators.
Honeymooning at sea
Some lines lure honeymooners by offering freebies such as a special
cake in the dining room one night, or an invitation to a private cocktail
party. But you (or someone who likes you a lot) can also book a variety
of honeymoon/anniversary packages. NCL’s $79 Honeymoon Package,
for example, includes champagne and strawberries at embarkation, a
dinner for two with complimentary wine at the ship’s specialty restau-
rant, an invitation to a cocktail party, a keepsake photo, and canapés in
your cabin one evening. Bump up to the $229 Deluxe Package and you
also get breakfast in bed one morning and two 25-minute massages at
the spa. All the mainstream lines offer similar deals, with more expen-
sive packages adding spa treatments, more champagne, chocolate-
covered strawberries, shore excursions, and the like. If you’re inter-
ested, sign up for a package when you book your cruise, or soon after.
Part I: Getting Started 
38

Renewing your vows
Some lines also offer vow-renewal packages for couples who’d like to cel-
ebrate their marriage all over again. Princess offers vow-renewal pack-
ages that run from $205 to $485, the former including the ceremony, an
orchid bouquet and boutonniere, a bottle of champagne and souvenir
champagne glasses, a framed formal portrait of the ceremony, a com-
memorative certificate signed by the captain, and a framed photo of the
ceremony; the latter adding a champagne breakfast in bed, two terry-
cloth robes, a visit to the spa for half-hour massages or facials, canapés
or petit fours in your stateroom every evening, and a personalized invi-
tation from the captain to visit the bridge while in port.
Going Solo
Like life in general, cruising tends to be a couples’ sport, with most cabins
occupied by husband-and-wife teams age 40-something and up. If you’re a
single traveler — whether you’re sailing just for a nice getaway or to try
and meet Mr. or Ms. Right — things get a little more complicated.
In the old ocean-liner days, ships often had cabins designed for people
traveling solo, but those are very rare these days, and cruise lines now
base their revenue expectations on two paying customers sharing every
cabin. That’s why solo passengers generally get socked with something
called the single supplement, which is a fancy way of saying the cruise
line charges you more than if you were sailing with another person in
the cabin. The supplement can add 50 percent or more to the usual per-
person fare, though some lines are quietly foregoing or reducing these
charges if a ship isn’t filling up — though of course there’s no way to
predict this kind of thing.
You can avoid the supplement by sailing with a friend, of course, and
Holland America and Windjammer Barefoot Cruises can even find you
a friend through their cabin-share programs, which match you with a
(same-gender) roommate. If it turns out they can’t find you one, you can
probably get the cabin at the regular double-occupancy rate anyway.
If you’re looking for romance on your cruise, here are a few guidelines:
 Short cruises, such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean’s 3- and 4-day
Bahamas and Mexico sailings, attract a lot of singles and have a
real partying atmosphere. If the bar scene is your scene, these
cruises may work for you.
 Windjammer Barefoot Cruises offers singles cruises a couple times
a year, with the numbers of men and women carefully balanced.
Most lines don’t go that far, but most ships do host singles get-
togethers the first day of the cruise to let you know who’s in the
same boat as you (so to speak).
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 39

 Some travel agents also arrange singles cruises, booking blocks of
cabins aboard large ships and setting up singles parties for their
guests. These companies include Cruiseman (% 800-889-7683;
www.cruiseman.com) and SinglesCruise.com (% 800-393-5000;
www.singlescruise.com).
Booking Gay/Lesbian Cruises
Snapshot from one of our most recent cruises: Woman, having imbibed
considerably, running up to two male passengers and yelling, “Are you
guys GAY? That’s so GREAT! I love you guys!” It’s that kind of fun that can
make gay- and lesbian-oriented charter cruises attractive.
A number of specialized travel agencies (listed below) either charter full
ships outright or reserve blocks of cabins with cruise lines that are known
to be particularly gay-friendly. Full-charters typically program many of
their own activities and bring aboard their own entertainers to augment
the ship’s entertainment staff. Hosted group trips typically have cocktail
parties for group members and specially programmed activities on board
and in port.
 Atlantis Events Inc., 9200 Sunset Blvd., Suite 500, West Hollywood,
CA 90069 (% 800-628-5268 or 310-859-8800; www.atlantisevents.
com), offers all-gay charters with lines such as Celebrity, Royal
Caribbean, and NCL. Past guest performers have included Patti
LuPone, Cybill Shepherd, and Chaka Khan.
 Friends of Dorothy Travel, 1177 California St., Suite B, San

fodtravel.com), offers many full-gay charters with lines such
as Celebrity, NCL, and the ultraluxe SeaDream Yachts, as well as
hosted tours on the QM2 and other ships.
 Olivia Cruises and Resorts, 4400 Market St., Oakland, CA 94608
(% 800-631-6277 or 415-962-5700; www.olivia.com), offers full-ship
charters targeted specifically to the lesbian community, mostly
aboard Holland America’s ships. Recent guest performers have
included k. d. lang, the Indigo Girls, Wynonna Judd, Shawn Colvin,
and Melissa Etheridge, plus the cast of Showtime’s The L Word.
 Pied Piper Travel, 330 West 42nd St., Suite 1804, New York, NY 10036

munity at various ports of call.

732-6822; www.rfamilyvacations.com), was founded by Rosie
O’Donnell’s partner Kelli O’Donnell and gay travel veteran Gregg
Kaminsky. Trips are targeted to the gay and lesbian family market.

Rolling Around on Deck: Cruises
for Wheelchair Users
It used to be that travelers with mobility problems had a terrible time at
sea, but over the past decade most ships have been built with accessi-
bility in mind. Ships now commonly feature two dozen or more wheel-
chair-accessible cabins at a variety of price points, and practically all
decks and public rooms are accessible via elevators and ramps.
Some lines do more than others. Holland America, for example, has a
system in place to comfortably transfer wheelchair passengers to ten-
ders (small boats) so that they can go ashore with everyone else in
places where the ship can’t dock. The system uses lifts and guests don’t
have to leave their wheelchairs during the process. Some Princess ships
have handicapped-accessible pools, which also use lifts.
Once you’ve narrowed your focus to a few cruise lines or ships, contact
the lines’ special services desks and get the full scoop on their accessi-
bility. Be aware that some lines require that travelers with a disability be
accompanied by a fully mobile companion. Passengers with chronic ill-
nesses may have to present a doctor’s note stating clearance for travel.
When you talk with a prospective line, consider these issues:
 What wheelchair-accessible cabins are available? How are they
equipped? Are they near the elevators?
 Are there a good number of elevator banks spaced around the ship,
and are the buttons low enough to reach?
 Are all public rooms wheelchair accessible? Will you have to
maneuver over lips in doorways?
 At the ports of call, does the ship pull into dock or use tenders to
go ashore? Can the tenders handle wheelchairs?
 Does the line have any special procedures for boarding and disem-
barking travelers with disabilities from its ships?
 Are shore excursions on your itinerary able to accommodate
wheelchair passengers?
Chapter 3: Choosing Your Ideal Cruise 41

If you’re on a ship that still does traditional fixed-seating dining, make
sure the cruise line knows that you use a wheelchair. That way they can
put you at a table that doesn’t require too much maneuvering to get to.
A handful of travel agencies specialize in booking cruises for disabled
travelers. Accessible Journeys, 35 W. Sellers Ave., Ridley Park, PA 19078
(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com), pub-
lishes a newsletter and can provide licensed healthcare professionals to
accompany travelers who require aid.

O
kay, it’s not brain surgery. But the truth is, cruise rates aren’t
always easy to get a handle on. Fares are constantly in flux based
on the whims of supply and demand. At press time, people were travel-
ing like mad and demand was high. So the price of a cruise today is likely
not to be the same as it was a month ago or what it will be six months
down the road.
So what does this mean? Book early. After preaching in previous years
that booking at the last minute would land you the best deal, the sermon
is over. There are always exceptions — slow periods like September and
October and non-holiday weeks in November and December — but
today your best strategy is booking early, say four to six months out.
As for the actual booking process, cruise lines still tend to do what
they’ve been doing for years, relying on traditional travel agents (and
now on agent Web sites) to sell their product. Because the lines keep
building new ships and adding more ports, working with a plugged-in
travel agent to keep everything straight is a smart move. For this and
other booking and financial issues, this chapter has you covered.

Poking Holes in the Cruise Price Mirage
Just like the airbrushed Barbie and Ken dolls dancing and lounging all
over the cruise lines’ brochures, the prices printed in those brochures
for some strange reason just aren’t real, so feel free to ignore them.
You’ll always pay less, except aboard some of the specialized small-ship
lines. Cruise line Web sites, on the other hand, print relatively realistic
rates, comparable (more or less) to what you get from a travel agency.
We’ve partnered with a real live travel agency — Nashville–based Just
Cruisin’ Plus (% 800-888-0922; www.justcruisinplus.com) — to
show you the actual prices people are paying for cruises aboard all the
ships in this book. Check this out: The brochure rate for a 7-night west-
ern Caribbean cruise aboard Princess Cruises’ beautiful Caribbean
Princess is $1,239 for a low-end outside cabin. In reality, however, during
our sampling period (June 2005 cruises, priced in mid-Apr), we got that
same cabin for $649. Can you say huge difference?
In the ship-review chapters (Chapters 11–13), we show what consumers
actually pay for the lowest-priced inside cabins (ones without windows),
the lowest-priced outside cabins (with windows), and the cheapest suites
aboard each ship. Remember that cruise ships generally have many dif-
ferent categories of cabins within the basic divisions of inside, outside,
and suite, all priced differently. The rates we list represent the lowest-
priced (which usually equates to smallest) in each division. If you’re 
interested in booking a roomier, fancier cabin or suite, the price will be
higher, with rates for high-end inside cabins being close to those for low-
end outsides, and rates for high-end outsides being close to those for
low-end suites.
Remember that rates are always subject to the basic principles of supply
and demand. The sample rates in this book are meant as a guide only —
the price you pay may be higher or lower, depending on when you book,
when you choose to travel, whether any special discounts are being
offered by the lines, and a slew of other factors. All rates are cruise-only,
per person, based on double occupancy, and, unless otherwise noted,
include port charges (the per-passenger fee each island charges the
cruise line for entry). Government fees and taxes are additional.
Counting Extra Costs
Here’s some good news. Like few other luxuries, the price of a cruise has
not kept up with the pace of inflation. And who’s complaining? Cruises
today cost less — when adjusted for inflation — than they did in the
1970s. So just how do all those big fat cruise lines stay in business then,
poor things? Don’t feel sorry for them. They do just fine by building new
ships, rounding up more passengers, and piling on the extras offered for
sale on board.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
46

Remembering what’s not included
Your cruise fare includes accommodations, meals, and entertainment,
but keep in mind what’s not included when you budget. First, there’s the
cost of getting to the ship (whether by plane or car), and the cost of
extras, from piña coladas and soft drinks to Swedish massages, tuxedo
rentals, and spinning classes. Plan on being very enticed by shopping,
both aboard ship and in port, and figure out whether you want to book
the ship’s organized shore excursions, which can really add up. Decide if
you need a hotel room before or after the cruise, and if you want to add
a few days on to your trip to, say, tour Rome or chill out in Miami.
Figuring in tips
Although technically you choose how much you want to tip the crew
(unless you sail on one of those rare “no tipping” ships), the cruise lines
are happy to offer guidelines. In fact, most just add gratuities right on to
your bill to the tune of about $70 per week (or $10 per day) per person
to cover tips for your waiter, bus person, and room steward. Some lines
suggest children pay only half of this amount. If you’re not happy with
the service, or were so impressed you want to tip extra, you can go
down to the reception desk at any point and change the amount of the
gratuities to be charged to your account.
Don’t worry about tipping bartenders unless they’re really good 
listeners — on most ships, your bar tab includes a 15 percent gratuity.
For spa treatments, a 15 percent tip is typically charged directly to your
bill. If not, you can write one in (or not, if your shiatsu wasn’t up to par).
Budgeting for shore excursions
Shore excursions are sightseeing tours that help you make the most of
your time at the ports your ship visits; however, they can add a hefty
sum to your vacation costs, ranging from about $30 for a short bus or
walking tour to $400 or more per person for flightseeing by plane or heli-
copter. You may not stay in port long enough to take more than one tour,
but the costs can still add up pretty fast.
Some tours are worth the money, particularly for active tours, such as
those involving kayaking or mountain biking, or for tours that take you
far beyond the port city (often a better option than going it alone in a
cab, seeing as you need to get back to the ship at a specific time).
Be aware that sometimes a shore trip means seeing the sights from
a packed tour bus with some ho-hum spiel and a stop for souvenirs.
Sometimes. Not always. If you’re suspicious, ask for more details of the
itinerary from your ship’s shore excursions desk.
A little planning early on can save you big bucks and help you avoid
regrets about missing out on something cool later. Before you set sail,
read up on your cruise’s ports of call and figure out what you may want
to see at those places (the chapters in Part V of this book can help).
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 47

Adding up admission costs and then comparing the cost of doing it your
way with the cost of doing it their way can help you determine whether
to go the excursion route or not. For example, Heidi has saved money
and avoided the sweaty group tour thing by taking taxis to sites such as
Pompeii, where you can rent headset audio tours and explore solo.
You can book shore excursions on board or, in most cases, in advance
on the cruise line Web sites, with your tickets waiting in your cabin
when you arrive. If you change your mind, sometimes the cruise lines
allow you to cancel or switch tours. Read the fine print carefully. If you
book on the ship, you can ask the shore excursion staff questions first or
attend one of the so-called port lectures, which typically come off more
like sales pitches for the ship’s tours and the stores in port that the
cruise lines partner with. Tours are huge moneymakers for cruise lines,
and the role of the onboard tour folks is to get you to buy.
Paying taxes and port charges
When comparing cruise prices, note whether taxes, port charges, and
other government fees are included in the total fare. They usually are,
but if not, you may pay up to $200 or more extra per person on a typical
one-week cruise. You can find information on whether such charges are
included or not in most cruise brochures and Web sites. If you don’t find
the info there, ask your travel agent or call the cruise line.
Estimating onboard costs
Cruise lines make a huge chunk of their revenue on board. Don’t be 
surprised when you first board, particularly on a big mass-market ship,
if everyone seems to be selling something, from the bar staff with the
enticing umbrella drinks to the roving photographer to the salespeople
promoting everything from cellulite treatments to scratch-off lottery
cards, fresh flowers, bottles of wines, and art auctions.
Unless you have superhuman willpower, you’ll probably buy at least one
cute professional photo of you and the kids by the pool, or a sweatshirt
with the ship’s logo, or the cocktail someone so kindly offers you the
minute you step aboard, or that relaxing massage, video arcade games,
and so on. Just like a hotel or a theme park, a cruise offers tons of poten-
tial extras. Make sure and budget for them.
Be aware that the ship’s fancy alternative restaurant may charge a serv-
ice fee of as much as $30 a head, and in most cases you’ll pay extra for
treats such as an espresso, cappuccino, or gourmet ice cream. Turn to
Chapter 7 to find out more about the finer points of at-sea dining.
Table 4-1 lists some average prices — that may vary by ship — that can
help you determine how much to set aside to cover onboard costs.

After you calculate your cruise fare (figuring in discounts, port charges,
and additional taxes and fees) and cost of transportation, plan on setting
aside $50 to $100 per person per day, not including tips, to cover other
expenses. If you want to take that $400 helicopter tour, buy a bauble in
the ship’s jewelry store, or indulge in fine champagne and cognac, you
need to budget more.
If you plan to gamble, have bucks on hand for the ship’s casino. And
don’t forget to set aside money to spend at the ports.
Paying up when the party’s over
The cruise-bill fairy visits your cabin late on the last full day of the
cruise with your final bill, slipping it under your door or leaving it on
your bed. If you find any error or if you want to pay by cash, traveler’s
check, or personal check, you need to go stand in line at the purser’s or
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 49

guest relations desk with your cruisemates. If it all adds up right and you
simply want it billed to your credit card, you don’t have to lift your
weary head from the pillow.
Saving Bucks on Your Booking
Naturally, the biggest cost of your cruise is the cruise itself, so this sec-
tion explores the best strategies for saving.
Booking early, booking smart
You don’t have to book your cruise a year in advance, but we advise
booking at least a few months in advance because cruise lines today are
generally offering their best prices to those who book ahead. Company
policies vary, and cruise lines don’t necessarily state in their brochures
or on their Web sites how far out you need to book to get the early-bird
rate, or even what that early-bird rate is. But given that cruise prices are
based on supply and demand — and demand is up these days, to levels
not seen since before 9/11 — cruise lines don’t have to do as much last-
minute wheeling and dealing as in years past. In fact, at press time,
cruise fares overall were somewhat higher than in the past few years.
Not only can you often save money by booking well in advance, but you
can also have your best shot at getting your first choice of cabin. The
best and cheapest cabins are the first to sell out.
So how early is early? Lines usually announce their itineraries 10 to 14
months before a sailing. Though last-minute discounts still exist, if you
don’t want to take a chance, these days it usually pays to book longer
cruises and cruises to places such as Europe and Asia farther out, about
six to nine months in advance. It’s a good idea to book shorter cruises
and cruises to the Caribbean three to six months in advance.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
50
Keeping tabs on your spending
You should keep track of your shipboard expenditures so that you aren’t surprised
when you get the final tab at the end of your voyage. You can do this by keeping your
receipts — you get one every time you sign with your onboard credit card. On some
lines, you can also take advantage of the interactive television features in your cabin,
which allow you to review your account regularly at the push of a button or two. And
you always have the option of stopping by the purser’s desk to check the ship’s listing
of your expenditures (you may have to wait in line to do this, particularly late in the
cruise).

If a better deal comes along after you book at the early-bird rate, there’s
a chance the cruise line may make good and give you the lower rate if
you happen to notice the rate change. Of course, you or your travel
agent must ask for the lower rate; the cruise lines generally don’t notify
you and they’re not obligated to do so.
Keep in mind that most last-minute deals are completely nonrefundable;
if you book a week before the cruise, for example, the full fare is due
upfront and you get zip back if you change your mind a few days later.
Taking a risk by booking late
If a ship approaches the sailing date with empty berths — which still
happens considering the number of new ships that cruise lines are build-
ing these days — the cruise line naturally gets a little antsy and starts
rolling out the last-minute discounts. If you’re able to just pick up and go
with short notice, look for the deals in newspapers and online anywhere
from four to eight weeks before the cruise is due to depart. Sometimes
last-minute fares can be pretty darn enticing — try $399 or $499 per
week — especially during slow travel periods, such as late fall.
On the other hand, you may not have a variety of cabins to choose from,
and although the cruise fare may be great, you may have a hard time get-
ting a good deal on last-minute airfare. If you can drive to the ship, the
last-minute route can be quite appealing.
Choosing off-season cruising
Another surefire way to cut the cost of your cruise is to book slightly off
season — in what’s known as the shoulder season (the front and back
ends of a high season) or in a low season. Table 4-2 lists the shoulder
seasons for key cruise locales.

Going on an introductory or repositioning cruise
When a cruise line moves one of its ships from one region to another
each season, say from New England to the Caribbean or from the
Caribbean to Alaska, it typically offers repositioning cruises at a dis-
counted price. Some experienced cruisers love these cruises, not only
because they’re cheap, but also because they tend to include more days
at sea than typical itineraries. That said, many people hate the idea of
spending more days at sea than in port.
Likewise, the lines tend to offer cut rates when they introduce a new
ship or move into a new cruising region. So it pays to keep track of
what’s happening in the industry when you look for a deal. Check cruise
line brochures and Web sites, and sites such as www.Frommers.com,
where you can get a free cruise newsletter packed with news, features,
and deals e-mailed to you twice a month.
Packing more people into your cabin
Into togetherness? Enjoy rubbing elbows (and just about everything
else) with friends and loved ones? You can pay less by booking extra
people in your cabin.
Here’s how the cruise lines pull it off: They book the first two passengers
at the regular fare and give the third and fourth passengers a pretty big
discount. And if your extra passengers happen to be your kids, the line
may offer rates just for them. For example, kids under age 2 go free on
Norwegian Cruise Line, and Disney charges children under 3 $139 for a 
7-night cruise.
Going with a group
One of the best ways to get a cruise deal is to book as a group, so you
may want to gather family for a reunion or convince your friends or col-
leagues that they need a vacation, too.
A group is generally a minimum of 16 people in eight cabins. The savings
include not only a discounted rate but also at least the cruise portion
(but not the air) of the 16th ticket is free (on some upscale ships, you can
negotiate one free ticket for groups of eight or more). You and the gang
can split the savings from the free ticket or maybe hold a drawing to see
who sails for free. If your group is large enough, you may also get some
freebies from the cruise line, such as a cocktail party, cabin upgrade, or
onboard credit vouchers to use in gift shops, spas, and more.
Sharing with another single
Cruise lines want to get the most out of every available cabin, so they
base rates on double-occupancy and often require singles who want
to room alone to pay what they call a supplement. This is no bargain.
Supplements can range from 120 percent of the per-person double-
occupancy rate to an outrageous 200 percent.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
52

As an alternative, if you’re willing to share quarters, a few lines, includ-
ing Holland America and Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, guarantee to
match you up with a same-gender roommate. You score big-time if the
line fails to find you a roommate, because that means you get to enjoy
having the whole cabin to yourself at the cheaper shared rate. If you’re a
real cheapskate (and glutton for punishment), save by signing up for a
shared quad (a room for four), available on some ships.
Using your seniority
Don’t keep your age a secret. A few lines shave a percentage off the top
for passengers 55 and older, and you get that rate even if you share your
cabin with a younger passenger. You don’t have to be a member of a
senior citizens group (such as the AARP), but it doesn’t hurt. Sometimes
memberships get you extra savings.
Paying in advance
Cruise lines love to get your cash as early as possible. So some of the
pricier lines offer discounts to folks who pay their whole cruise fare
ahead of time. Silversea Cruises, for example, offers 5 percent off.
Looking for free extras
Some cruise promotions may include extra treats such as pre-cruise
hotel packages and/or cabin upgrades. Some lines may even give you an
onboard credit to buy stuff on the ship, such as drinks and massages. In
some cases, you may even see an offer of free airfare (normally with
European sailings).
Reaping repeater perks
If you enjoy your first cruise, try it again: Cruise lines appreciate repeat
business, so if you sail on a line you’ve traveled with before (even if you
were just a kid with your parents), let the line or your agent know that
you’ve come back for another round. The line may provide special dis-
counts or at least extra onboard amenities. If they leave truffles by your
bedside on your second cruise, imagine what kind of perks you could
get for your tenth cruise anniversary! Some of the high-end lines actually
give away a free cruise if you’ve racked enough days at sea.
Booking your next cruise while sailing your last one
When they still have your undivided attention, and you’re deep in that
vacation high, cruise lines often offer incentive deals to bring you back
another time. Be sure to ask if you can combine the discount the line
offers on board with other deals it may offer later. Your travel agent can
still handle your reconfirmation and tickets as long as you tell the line
who your travel agent is when you sign up for your next cruise.
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 53

Booking back-to-back cruises
People who get hooked on cruises like most of us get hooked on potato
chips are in luck. By booking back-to-back cruises (where the same ship
covers two different routes, one right after the other), you can get up to
50 percent off the second cruise. You may even be able to combine short
cruises (such as Carnival’s 3-day cruise to the Bahamas with its 4-day
cruise to Cozumel and Key West). You lengthen your vacation and
increase the number of ports you see along the way, all while saving
money — in fact, if you go for two weeks, you may get a third week free.
Ka-ching, ka-ching!
Finding the deals
All the deals we mention in this section are terrific, you say, but how can
you discover which lines offer special rates? Certainly it pays to keep an
eye on the travel section of your Sunday newspaper and surf Web sites
such as www.Frommers.com, but remember that some of these discounts
are easier to spot than to assess (for example, a deal may only be for cer-
tain dates or certain cabins, and you may not be able to combine it with
other discounts). Given the number of variables that can affect how
much you save, you probably still want to consult a cruise-savvy travel
agent (in person, on the Web, or by phone) before you make your book-
ing. And it pays to comparison shop, too.
Finding the Best Deals via Travel Agents
and the Web
To find the best deals and figure out which ship and itinerary is best for
you, consult with an experienced travel agent to seal the deal. Among
your choices are Web-based cruise sellers and more traditional travel
agencies. The former rely on their sites for actual bookings, while the
latter use their Web sites as glorified advertising space to promote their
offerings, doing all actual business in person or over the phone.
With a few exceptions, cruise lines have direct online-booking engines
but we don’t recommend using them. Why? Because agents and Web-
based sellers may have negotiated group rates with the lines, be part of
a consortium with whom a line is doing an upgrade promotion, or have
other deals going that enable them to offer you lower rates. In fact,
cruise lines encourage you to use a travel agency, too, and the lines
report that about 90 percent of their bookings come in that way.
Pricing the differences
As far as cruise prices go, there’s no absolutely quantifiable difference
between the real live travel agents (whether your hometown brick-and-
mortar mom-and-pop agency or a big anonymous mega-agency) and
Internet-based cruise sellers.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
54

In 2004 and 2005, the major lines started doing something they had
talked about for years, offering all agencies, large or small, the same
rates — a major coup for small agencies who have been struggling to
keep up with the Expedias of the world. Further, some lines have said
they would have no dealings with any agency that publicly (via print or
Web advertising) doled out rebates to clients — that is, gave their cus-
tomers additional discounts by sacrificing some of their own commis-
sions. Still, don’t think there aren’t any loopholes. For example, at press
time, Royal Caribbean was offering one of its top-producing agencies
bottles of wine for any clients booking Royal Caribbean. Other agencies
have offered gift cards, free insurance, or other incentives to customers
in lieu of reduced rates.
Relying on Web sites for research
Most Web sites give you only a menu of ships and itineraries to select
from, plus a basic search capability that takes into account only destina-
tion, price, length of trip, and date, without consideration of the type of
cruise experience each line offers. There’s no one to answer your ques-
tions. That’s fine if you know exactly what you want, and are comfort-
able on the computer. If, on the other hand, you have limited experience
with cruising and with booking on the Web, it may be better to see a tra-
ditional agent, who can help you wade through the choices and answer
your questions.
Before you actually book your cruise, use the Web for research to help
figure out what you want. Cruise the lines’ Web sites as well as those of
travel agencies and online magazines such as www.Frommers.com, www.
CruiseCritic.com, and www.Cruisemates.com. They’re all great ways
to educate yourself.
Letting travel agents lead the way
Most of us would agree that a live person, whether on the phone or in
person, can offer better customer service than a computer screen. This
is especially so given that pricing doesn’t vary that much across all
types of cruise agencies.
When it comes time to sign on the dotted line, a good agent — someone
who’s sailed on or inspected a variety of ships and booked many cus-
tomers aboard in the past — can tell you which cabins have their views
obstructed by lifeboats, which cabins are near loud areas such as discos
and the engine room, which ships and itineraries you should avoid if
you’re not looking for a party vibe, and what the major differences are
between cabin categories. An experienced cruise agent can tell you
about special promotions (like free bottles of wine) and help out and act
as an intermediary should any problems arise with your booking, order
special extras such as a bottle of champagne in your cabin when you
arrive, and in general make your planning easy.
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 55

Finding a good travel agent
So, how do you know if an agent is any good? Some are little more than
order-takers, who may never even have been on a cruise themselves.
One usually helpful resource is an agent referred to you by a reliable
friend or acquaintance. This is particularly valuable these days, when
agents are being pressed to squeeze more profit from every sale, making
some of them less likely to take the time to discuss options.
When searching for a good agent, it can’t hurt if an agent is an Accredited
Cruise Counselor (ACC), Master Cruise Counselor (MCC), or Elite Cruise
Counselor (ECC), designations doled out by the Cruise Lines International
Association (CLIA), an industry trade organization. Many of the cruise
lines’ Web sites list preferred agencies (generally broken down or search-
able by city or state), as does the CLIA site at www.cruising.org. Many

Buyer beware!
Keep in mind that if you hear of a deal that sounds too good to be true, as the saying
goes, it probably is. If you get a solicitation by phone, fax, mail, or e-mail that doesn’t
sound right or if your agent gives you the heebie jeebies, contact your state consumer
protection agency or local office of the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org). You
can also call the cruise line directly and ask them about the agency. And be wary of
working with any company, be it on the phone or the Internet, that refuses to give you
its street address. Here are some more tip-offs:
 Beware of snap recommendations. When agents suggest a cruise line without
asking you a single question first about your tastes, beware. They’re probably just
interested in making a commission from a line that pays them the highest rates.
 Always use a credit card to pay for your cruise. It gives you more protection in the
event the agency or cruise line fails. When your credit card statement arrives,
make sure the payment was made to the cruise line, not the travel agency. If you
find that payment was actually made to the agency, it’s a big red flag that some-
thing’s wrong. If you insist on paying by check, you’ll be making it out to the
agency, so it may be wise to ask if the agency has default protection. Many do.
 Always follow the cruise line’s payment schedule. Never agree to a different
schedule the travel agency comes up with. The lines’ terms are always clearly
printed in their brochures and usually require an initial deposit, with the balance
due no later than 75 to 45 days before departure. If you’re booking two months or
less before departure, the full payment is usually required at the time of booking.
 Keep on top of your booking. If you fail to receive a document or ticket on the date
promised, ask about it immediately. If you’re told that your reservation was can-
celed because of overbooking and you must pay extra for a confirmed and
rescheduled sailing, demand a full refund and/or contact your credit card com-
pany to stop payment.

of the most reliable agencies are also members of agent groups, such as
Virtuoso and Signature Travel Network. In this book’s appendix, we list
some of the best agencies and the major cruise-selling Web sites.
Choosing Your Cabin
When it comes right down to it, choosing a cabin is really a question of
money. If you’ve got big bucks, you’re gonna get the penthouse. If you’ve
got just a few bucks, don’t fret, there are decent choices for you, too.
From a windowless lower-deck cabin with upper and lower bunks to a
1,400-square-foot suite with a butler and mile-long private veranda,
cruise ships can offer a dozen or more stateroom categories that differ
by size, location in the ship, amenities, and, of course, price.
For the most part, and especially on small ships, where most cabins are
virtually identical, cabins on higher decks are still generally more expen-
sive, and outside cabins (with windows or balconies) are more expen-
sive than inside cabins (those without). Outside cabins whose windows
are obstructed by lifeboats are cheaper than ones with good views.
Figure 4-1 shows a sample deck plan with some other considerations
when choosing a cabin.
For a closer look at a ship, go online for a virtual tour of its cabins and
public rooms. Most cruise lines offer an assortment of photos, videos,
and/or 360-degree tours online, but to save time, go to the Cruises Only
Web site, www.cruisesonly.com, which has visuals on almost all the
mainstream and luxe ships reviewed in this book. Click on Cruise Lines,
and then click on the little camera icons next to each ship. Remember
that cruise lines tend to show off their fancier suites and cabins in these
tours, and low-end staterooms, when shown, are photographed with a
wide-angle lens that makes them look much bigger than they really are.
Evaluating cabin size
Inch for inch, cruise ship cabins are smaller than hotel rooms. Of course,
having a private balcony attached to your cabin, as many do, makes your
living space that much bigger. Figure 4-2 shows sample cabin floor plans.
A roomy standard cabin is about 170 to 180 square feet, although some
of the smallest are about 85 to 100 square feet. Disney has some of the
more spacious standard cabins at sea, at 226 square feet (they call them
“family suites,” but they’re still the most common accommodation
aboard their ships). Carnival and Holland America’s are about 185
square feet, with some going up to a roomy 197 and 220 square feet,
respectively. By way of comparison, equivalent standard cabins on a
good number of ships in the Norwegian and Royal Caribbean lines are
quite a bit smaller — try 120 to 160 square feet. Cabins on the small-ship
lines such as Windjammer, Clipper, and American Canadian Caribbean
Line can be very snug — on the order of 70 to 100 square feet.

Cabin Choice Considerations
1 Make note of public areas that 
may be loud — the ship’s disco, for 
example. Although the nightclub on 
this ship is far from any cabins, it 
doesn’t hurt to request that your 
cabin not be close to or below such a 
sleep-inhibitor.
2 Upper-deck cabins are not a good 
bet if you’re susceptible to 
seasickness because the upper 
decks feel more of the sea’s motion.
3 The motion-sickness warning also 
holds for cabins in the ship’s bow.
4 Outside cabins without verandas 
are represented as undivided 
rectangles.
5 Outside cabins with verandas show 
up as divided rectangles.
6 You can save big by booking an 
inside cabin without windows.
7 The cabins least affected by the 
motion of the sea are amidships, 
especially cabins amidships on the 
lower levels.
8 The cabins next to elevator shafts 
may be noisy. Of course, they’re also 
very convenient.
9 Cabins in the stern can be affected 
by the motion of the sea, and also 
are prone to vibrations from the 
ship’s engines.
10 Cabins near children’s areas may 
be fairly noisy during the day.
11 Lifeboats sometimes obstruct the 
view from cabin windows. The 
lifeboats on this illustrated ship are 
near public rooms, so private cabins 
aren’t affected.
12 Ideally, disabled vacationers have 
cabins near the ship’s entrance (13) 
and an elevator.
(The Mercury’s deck plan is provided 
by Celebrity Cruises.)

Typical outside cabins 
 
• Twin beds (can often be 
 
 pushed together)
 
• Upper berths for extra 
 
 passengers fold into walls

• Usually (but not always) 
 
 have televisions and radios

Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
60

All standard cabins on the high-end lines are roomy — in fact, many of
the high-end ships are “suite only,” measuring between about 250 and
300 square feet, not including the balcony space. Across the board, from
mainstream to luxe, the top suites and penthouses are obviously the
most spacious, some as large as 2,000 and 3,000 square feet (and more).
If your budget calls for something a little smaller, think of your cabin like
a bedroom in a large house. It’ll be mostly a place you use only for sleep-
ing, showering, and changing clothes. Out beyond the door, vast acres of
public spaces await, full of diversions.
Getting the scoop on inside cabins 
versus outside cabins
Whether you really plan to spend time in your cabin is a question that
should be taken into account when deciding whether to book an inside
cabin or an outside cabin (that is, one without windows or one with win-
dows or a balcony). If you plan to get up bright and early, hit the buffet
breakfast, and not stop till the cows come home, you can probably get
away with booking an inside cabin and save yourself a bundle. Inside
cabins are generally not as bad or as claustrophobic as they sound.
Many, in fact — such as those aboard most of the Carnival and Celebrity
fleets — are the same size as the outside cabins, and most cruise lines
design and decorate them to provide an illusion of light and space.
If, on the other hand, you want to lounge around and take it easy in your
cabin, maybe ordering breakfast from room service and eating while the
sun streams in — or, better yet, eating out in the sun, on your private
veranda — then an outside cabin is definitely a worthwhile investment.
If you want a view of the sea, be sure when booking that your window
or balcony doesn’t just give you a good view of a lifeboat or some other
obstruction (and remember, there are likely to be balconies on the deck
right above your balcony, so they’re more like porches than actual veran-
das). Some cruise line brochures tell you which cabins are obstructed,
and a good travel agent or a cruise line’s reservation agent can tell you
which cabins on a particular ship may have this problem.
Considering other cabin matters
Unless you’re booking at the last minute (like a few weeks or less before
sailing), as part of a group, or in a cabin-share or cabin-guarantee pro-
gram (which means you agree to a price, and find out your exact cabin
at the last minute), you can work with your agent to pick an exact cabin.
Need a bathtub rather than just a shower? That narrows your choices
on most ships. Want connecting cabins so that you and your kids, friends,
or relatives can share space? Most ships have ’em, but they sometimes
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 61

book up early, as do cabins with third or fourth berths (usually pull-down
bunks or a sofa bed). Almost all ships have cabin TVs these days, but a
few don’t. Want an elevator close by, to make it easy to get between
decks? Is the view out the cabin’s windows obstructed by lifeboats or
other ship equipment? Most importantly, keep cabin position in mind if
you suffer from seasickness. A midships location on a middle deck is best
because it’s a kind of fulcrum point, the area least affected by the vessel’s
rocking and rolling in rough seas.
Booking Your Airfare
Except during special promotions, airfare is rarely included in cruise
rates for Caribbean, Alaska, Mexico, and New England/Canada cruises,
though it often is on Europe and Asia itineraries. So if you can’t drive
to your port of embarkation and need to fly to get to Miami, New York,
Southampton, or Rome, you have to either purchase airfare on your own
through an agent or online, or buy it as a package with your cruise. The
latter is often referred to as an air add-on or air-sea package.
Here are the benefits of booking your airfare through the cruise line:
 When you book through the cruise line, you usually get round-trip
transfers between the airport and the ship.
 A uniformed cruise line employee is in the airport to direct you
to the right bus, and your luggage is taken from the airport to
the ship.
 The cruise line knows your airline schedule and, in the event of
delayed flights and other unavoidable snafus, does what they can
to make sure you get to the ship. For instance, during the abnor-
mally fierce hurricane season in fall 2004, those who had booked
the cruise lines’ air were given priority when it came to rebooking.
People who book their air transportation and transfers separately
are on their own.
With pros, there are bound to be cons. Here are the downsides to book-
ing your airfare through the cruise line:
 Odds are it’s more expensive to book through the cruise line than
on your own. In the past, cruise lines offered more competitive
fares, but the airlines aren’t giving them the bulk discounts they
used to, meaning prices have gone up. Consequently, fewer passen-
gers are now booking the lines’ air packages.
 If you book through the lines, you probably can’t use any frequent-
flier miles you’ve accumulated.
 The air add-on could mean a circuitous route — with indirect legs
and layovers — before you arrive at your port of embarkation.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
62

If you arrange your own air transportation, make absolutely sure that
airfare is not included as part of your cruise contract. Though rare, if it
is, you’re often granted a deduction (usually around $250 per person)
off the cruise fare. Passengers who book their own flights can still buy
transfers from the airport to the ship through their cruise line, but it’s
often cheaper to take a taxi, such as in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
Arranging for Dinner Reservations 
and Special Diets
Though most ships have casual, walk-in restaurants that don’t require
reservations, most also still offer at least one outlet that operates the
traditional way with fixed early and late seating times. In this case, when
you book your cruise you must choose an early or late seating for
dinner, and sometimes even put in a request for the size table you’re
interested in (tables for two, four, eight, ten, and so on). Early usually
means a 6 p.m. seating, while late is anywhere between 8 and 8:30 p.m.
Families with young children often choose the early seating. The later
seatings allow you to linger a little longer over your meal, with no rush
set up for another group. For a more detailed discussion, see Chapter 7.
On all but the smallest luxury ships, it’s almost impossible to reserve a
table for two, considering the sheer numbers requesting the same. Still,
it can’t hurt to ask.
Most ships now offer vegetarian meals and health-conscious choices as
part of their daily menus. If you follow any other special diet — whether
low-salt, low-fat, heart-healthy, kosher, halal, or any other — or if you
have certain food allergies, make this known to your travel agent when
you book, or at least 30 or more days before the cruise, and make sure
your diet can be accommodated at all three meals (sometimes special
meal plans cover only breakfast and dinner). If you’re sailing on a small
ship and have special food needs, definitely tell your agent.
Booking Pre- & Post-Cruise Hotel Stays
Cruise lines often offer hotel packages in the cities of embarkation and
debarkation, and because most of these cities are tourist attractions in
their own right, you may want to spend some time in New York, Oahu, or
London before you sail, or drive to Disney World from Port Canaveral.
The cruise lines’ package deals usually include hotel stays and trans-
portation from the hotel to the ship (before the cruise) or from the
docks to the hotel (after the cruise). Compare what the line is offering
with what you may be able to arrange on your own.
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 63

Considering Cancellations and Insurance
Given today’s geopolitical situation, it pays to have a handle on a cruise
line’s cancellation and insurance policies. What should you do if the
cruise you’ve booked is canceled before it departs? A cruise can be can-
celed because of shipyard delays (if you’ve booked an inaugural cruise),
the outbreak of an infectious disease, mechanical breakdowns (such as
nonfunctioning air-conditioning or an engine fire), the cruise line going
out of business, act of war, or an impending hurricane.
Luckily, given today’s competitive market, cruise lines have been making
big efforts to appease disappointed passengers, whether they bought
insurance or not. Typically, a line will reschedule the canceled cruise
and offer passengers big discounts on future cruises — after all, they
don’t want the bad press they’d get if they cheated hundreds or thou-
sands of people. There are, however, no set rules on how a line will com-
pensate you in the event of a cancellation.
If the shoe’s on the other foot and you need to cancel, you can generally
get a refund — most lines give you every cent back if you cancel at least
two to three months before your departure date, although details vary
from line to line. If you cancel closer to departure, you can usually get a
partial refund up until about 15 days before the cruise. After that, you
won’t get any refund at all, even if you cancel for medical reasons.
Exceptions? In early 2003, in response to the impending war with Iraq
and the general uneasiness in the Middle East, many lines liberalized
their cancellation and insurance policies for their European cruises, and,
in some cases, all their itineraries, in order to encourage bookings.
If you’re just worried about missing the ship, go a day early and spend
your money on a hotel and nice dinner instead. If you’re worried about
medical problems occurring during your trip, on the other hand, travel
insurance may be more vital.
Except for the small coastal cruisers described in Chapter 13, most
cruise ships have an infirmary staffed by a doctor and a nurse or two;
but in the event of a dire illness, the ship’s medical staff can only do so
much. Therefore, you may want a policy that covers emergency medical
evacuation and, if your regular insurance doesn’t cover it, the potential
cost of major medical treatment while away from home.
Cruise line policies versus third-party insurers
A good travel agent can tell you about policies sold through the cruise
lines and ones sold independently of the lines. Both have pros and cons.
No matter which you choose, it’s absolutely crucial to read the fine print
because terms vary from policy to policy.
 Both kinds typically reimburse you in some way when your trip is
affected by unexpected events (such as canceled flights, plane
crashes, dockworkers’ strikes, or the illness or death of a loved
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
64

one, as late as the day before or day of departure) but not by “acts
of God,” such as hurricanes and earthquakes (the exception being
if your home is made uninhabitable, putting you in no mood to con-
tinue with your cruise plans).
 Both also typically cover cancellation of the cruise for medical rea-
sons (yours or a family member’s); medical emergencies during the
cruise, including evacuation from the ship; lost or damaged lug-
gage; and a cruise missed due to airline delays (though some only
cover delays over three hours).
 Neither kind of policy reimburses you if your travel agent goes
bankrupt, so using a travel agent you’re very familiar with or who
has been recommended to you is the safest precaution you can
take. (And, of course, always use a credit card, never a check. If a
corrupt travel agent cashes it, or a decent one just goes out of busi-
ness, then you could get screwed.)
 Most cancellation policies also do not cover cancellations due to
work requirements.
Third-party coverage
Even though agents get a commission for selling both cruise line policies
and independent policies, most agents and industry insiders believe that
non–cruise line policies are the best bet because some will issue insur-
ance to those with pre-existing medical conditions if the condition is
stable when purchasing the insurance (a doctor would have to verify
this if you ever made a claim) and if you purchase the policy within
14 days of your initial deposit on the cruise. They also offer supplier-
default coverage that kicks in if a cruise line goes bankrupt, which a
handful did between 2000 and 2003.
Though bankruptcies are rare, a well-connected travel agent should see
the writing on the wall months before a cruise line fails — commissions
slow or stop being paid, phone calls aren’t returned, and industry
trade publications report on any problems — and tip you off. The less
customer-service-driven cruise sellers may not stop pushing a troubled
cruise line, however, selling these lines up to the very last minute.
According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, if you paid by credit card (and
again, you should), you can generally get your money back if you dis-
pute the charge within 60 days of the date the charge first appears. If
you paid in full four months before the cruise, you’re likely out of luck
going this route and may have to resort to litigation.
Policies are available from reputable insurers such as Access America,
Box 71533, Richmond, VA 23286 (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com), and Travel Guard International, 1145 Clark St., Stevens Point, WI
54481 (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com), whose Web sites main-
tain lists of the lines they cover (or no longer cover); these are helpful in
figuring out which lines may be considered financially shaky.
Chapter 4: Booking and Money Matters 65

Cruise line coverage
Cruise lines offer their own policies, many of them administered by
New York–based BerkelyCare (% 800-453-4069). If you opt for this type
of policy out of sheer convenience (the cost is added right onto your
cruise fare), keep in mind that they do not cover you in the event of a
cruise line bankruptcy (though using a credit card can save you here;
see the “Cruise line policies versus third-party insurers” section earlier
in this chapter) or for cancellation of your cruise due to pre-existing
medical conditions. Some lines’ policies, including Carnival, Costa,
Silversea, and Crystal, issue a cruise credit for the penalty amount if a
medical claim is deemed pre-existing, and issue you cash if you cancel
for a covered reason.
Generally, the cancellation penalty imposed by the cruise line would
be 100 percent of the cruise fare, for example, if you cancel a few days
before the cruise (assuming you’ve paid in full), or it could be just $300
if you cancel right after making the initial cruise deposit.
Sounds like the third-party policies win hands down, right? Well, to make
it just a little more complicated, a handful of cruise line policies are actu-
ally better in some areas than outside policies. For example, Princess
Cruises has an insurance policy that allows you to cancel for all the rea-
sons that an outside policy would (illness, injury) and get cash reim-
bursement or they will let you cancel for any reason whatsoever (from
fear of flying to a bad hair day) up until the day of departure and have
75 percent to 90 percent of the normal penalty for canceling your cruise
applied toward a future trip. Norwegian, Celebrity, Royal Caribbean, and
Silversea offer similar “any reason” policies.
Putting Down a Deposit
If you book at the last minute, you typically pay in full when making your
reservation. If you book several months or more ahead of time, then you
pay a deposit to secure the booking. Depending on the policy of the line
you selected, the amount is either fixed at a predetermined amount or
represents a percentage of the ticket’s total cost. The length of time
cruise lines hold a cabin without a deposit is getting shorter by the
minute. It seems pretty clear, in this age of near-obsessive “shopping
around,” that the cruise lines are doing their part to discourage it. It
used to be a cruise could be held for a week before you had to plunk
down cash; most lines have now shortened this window to one to three
days (exceptions include exotic itineraries that aren’t ultracompetitive).
Carnival, for instance, now requires a deposit within 24 hours.
The balance of the cruise price is due anywhere from about 60 to 90 days
before you depart; holiday cruises may require final payments earlier,
perhaps 90 days before departure.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
66

Credit card payments are made directly to the cruise line, but payments
by check are made out to the agency, which then passes payment on to
the cruise line. As we’ve said repeatedly in this chapter, it’s preferable
by far to pay by credit card, for the added protection it offers.
Reviewing Your Tickets
Carefully review your ticket, invoice, itinerary, and/or vouchers to con-
firm that they accurately reflect the departure date, ship, and cabin cate-
gory you booked. The printout usually lists a specific cabin number; if it
doesn’t, it designates a cabin category. Your exact cabin location will
then be assigned to you when you board ship.

Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise
Checklist
In This Chapter
 Getting your ID in order
 Verifying all the info in your cruise documents
 Dealing with money, on board and on shore
 Packing for your trip
 Knowing how to stay in touch while at sea
 Double-checking your flight
 Checking all the things that most people forget
Your cruise is paid for and you think you’re ready to go. But are you?
Before you head to the airport, you may have some chores to do.
Do you have the ID you need to get on board? Are your cruise tickets
and other documents all in order? Have you figured out your spending-
money situation so that you can pay for stuff on board and at the ports?
You need a checklist. Wow! You’re in luck. We’ve made one for you right
here. (Well, not an actual one, but you get the general idea.)
Identifying Yourself
Ah, the old days. Not long ago we watched the 1970s disaster movie
Airport, and there was a scene in which Helen Hayes cons her way onto a
departing jet by saying her son had dropped his wallet before he boarded.
Could she go aboard to give it to him? Sure, they said. Go on through.
It ain’t that way anymore. Today you not only need a photo ID to get on
the plane to your ship, you need the right ID to get aboard ship, too, and
you probably need a passport, too — and not only when you’re going
somewhere far off, such as Europe or Asia.
For decades, U.S.-based cruise ships have operated under rules that 
permitted U.S. citizens to travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean
without need of a passport, but that all seems to be changing. As of 
mid-2005, new rules proposed by the U.S. departments of State and

Homeland Security were set to do away with that loophole, meaning
even passengers taking weekend jaunts to the Bahamas will soon need
a passport — no ifs, ands, or buts.
Called the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, the rule change is part
of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and at
press time was in a review period and probably on track to passage. If
implemented according to the proposed timeline, all U.S. citizens travel-
ing to the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Central and South America will be
required to carry passports as of December 31, 2005. After December 31,
2006, the rules would cover travelers to Mexico and Canada as well (thus
affecting Mexican Riviera and Canada/New England cruises, as well as
any Alaska cruises that begin or end in Vancouver), and after December
31, 2007, passports would be required for all air, sea, and land border
crossings, period.
The bottom line? Get a passport if you’re planning any kind of cruise that
leaves U.S. territorial waters. Don’t dilly-dally either, since U.S. passport
services are likely to be deluged when and if the new rules take effect.
Passport applications generally take six to eight weeks to process, though
expedited service is also available (see below).
If you don’t currently have a passport, the State Department Web site
(http://travel.state.gov/passport) provides information on
obtaining one. Current fees are $97 for citizens age 16 and older, $82 for
younger than age 16.
To get a passport for the first time (or if you have an expired passport
issued more than 15 years ago, or issued while you were under 16),
you need to go in person to one of 6,000 passport acceptance facilities
located throughout the country, bringing two photographs of yourself,
proof of U.S. citizenship (an expired passport, certified birth certificate,
naturalization certificate, certificate of citizenship, or consular report of
birth abroad), and a valid form of photo ID, such as a driver’s license.
Acceptance facilities include many federal, state, and probate courts,
post offices, some public libraries, and a number of county and munici-
pal offices. Find the one nearest you using the State Department’s search
page at http://iafdb.travel.state.gov.
Citizens who need a new passport for travel within two weeks may visit
any of the 13 regional passport agencies listed at http://travel.state.
gov/passport/about/agencies/agencies_913.html. Appointments
are required, and you need to bring a completed passport application
(downloadable at http://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/
forms_847.html), appropriate ID, proof of citizenship (see list above),
and two regulation passport-size photos. Expedited service costs $60
plus any mailing fees, above and beyond the regular application fees.
If you don’t live near a passport center, you can apply for expedited
service at a local passport acceptance facility, located in post offices,
courthouses, and so on, and then follow up through overnight mail.
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 69

You can renew an expired passport through the mail as long as you were
over age 16 when it was issued and still have the same name (or can pro-
vide legal documentation of a name change), and your old passport is
undamaged and was issued within the past 15 years. Forms are down-
loadable at http://travel.state.gov/passport/forms/forms_
847.html. Fees for renewal are currently $67. Expedited renewal serv-
ices are available for an additional $60 plus mailing costs.
When traveling, carry a photocopy of your passport in a separate piece
of luggage from your real one. If you lose your passport while abroad, go
directly to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. Bring all the forms of
identification you have so that the officials can start generating you a
new passport.
Reviewing Your Cruise Documents
Your tickets and other cruise documents usually arrive in your mailbox
about a month before your cruise. Sometimes, however, they don’t get
to you until a week before your cruise. Plenty of important items are
included, such as the following:
 Your airline tickets (if you bought them from the cruise line)
 A boarding document that contains your cabin assignment (or
at least your cabin category) and sometimes your dining table
assignment
 Boarding forms to fill out
 Luggage tags
 Vouchers for transportation between the airport and the port (if
you arranged for this option)
 A booklet describing the shore excursions available on your trip,
which you may be able to book ahead of time
 Another booklet with emergency phone numbers and answers
to frequently asked questions, such as what kind of power outlets
are in your cabin, what kind of laundry services are available, and
so on
Read through your documents carefully and verify the info. Confirm that
your cabin category is correct, as well as your dining preferences (on
ships that still do formal, fixed-seating dining). Check that your airline
tickets show the correct flights and arrival times. And definitely make
sure that you’ve got enough time to reach the port at least a few hours
before the ship is scheduled to depart.
When the big day arrives, keep your cruise documents with you in your
purse, briefcase, or carryon.

70

Paying Up: Paper or Plastic?
Cruising is like Monopoly: Through the whole thing it feels like you’re
playing with funny money. It’s only at the end that reality hits.
Spending on board
With the exception of some of the small ships discussed in Chapter 13,
cruise vessels operate on a cashless basis from day to day. What that
means is that everything you buy on board, from bar drinks to shore
excursions to spa treatments and dinners at extra-cost restaurants, is
put on your tab, to be paid at the end of the trip.
Most ships issue you an onboard charge card, which works as described
in the following paragraphs. The exceptions are some small ships (carry-
ing 100 or fewer passengers) that just ask for your cabin number to keep
an account of onboard purchases.
Shortly before or after you first come aboard, a purser or check-in clerk
takes an imprint of your credit card and issues you your onboard charge
card, which, on most ships, also serves as your room key and as your
cruise ID. You also have the option of using cash, traveler’s checks, or
sometimes personal checks to pay your account. If you decide to pay
cash, you probably have to put down a deposit of at least $250.
On the last night of your cruise, you get an itemized account of all
you’ve charged. If you don’t dispute the charges, they’re automatically
billed to your credit card. If you’re paying in cash or if you dispute any
charge, you need to stop by the office of the ship’s cashier or purser.
There may be a long line, so don’t go if you don’t have to.
The only time you may need cash on board is at the end of the cruise,
when (depending on the cruise line’s policies) you may be leaving tips
for your cabin steward, dining steward, and other staff. You may also
want to keep some cash on hand to use in the laundry room (if your ship
has one). In general, you need cash for the casino, but often ships allow
you to charge gambling dollars to your shipboard account, up to a cer-
tain amount per day.
If you find that you need more cash, some ships have their own ATMs —
often located, not surprisingly, in the casino. The ATMs give out U.S. dol-
lars, though fees are typically higher than ATMs on shore.
Settling up on shore
Almost all the stores at the ports take credit cards, and most restaurants
do, too, but you need some cash on hand to pay for taxis, to buy small
items and snacks, and to tip tour guides. Small bills are best.
Pretty much all the Caribbean, Mexican, and Canadian ports we describe
in Part V accept U.S. dollars. If you want to use the local currency, you
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 71

can often find ATMs, bureaux de change, and banks close to the docks.
ATMs are your best bet, as their exchange rates are most favorable —
just be sure you have some idea of the exchange rate ahead of time, so
you know how much you’re taking out. In Europe, you need to convert
your dollars to euros (or pounds, in Britain).
To check conversion rates before your trip, use the “Quick Cross Rates”
table and currency calculator at www.xe.com.
Using ATMs means that you don’t have to carry large amounts of trav-
eler’s checks or cash from the United States, but we usually carry some
cash anyway, as an emergency reserve.
Before you leave home, be sure any cash you intend to access is in the
checking part of your account if your ATM card allows you to access
from both savings and checking — some foreign machines allow you
to withdraw only from your checking account and don’t offer you the
option of transferring money between accounts.
You can find ATMs at most ports — even the tiny ones. Don’t take out
more money than you need that day or you may end up with a bunch of
bills that you have to convert back at the end of your trip. Also, remem-
ber that you can’t convert coins, so spend those first.
Personal checks are pretty much useless for cruise travel purposes,
except as accepted on your ship (check with the cruise line for its policy
on personal checks).
Decking Yourself Out: What to Pack
Some people worry about packing for vacations. Don’t. Seriously, you
probably have everything you need right in your closet. Over the past
several years, cruises have gotten more and more casual, attire-wise.
Understanding shipboard dress codes 
(such as they are)
Back around the dawn of the 21st century, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL)
looked at the cruise business, saw that pretty much every line had stuck
with a mix of formal, informal, and casual nights for the past, oh, hundred
years, and then said, “Screw it. We’re going casual.” The move created an
avalanche, with many other lines either toning down or scrapping their
own dress codes.
Today, no matter what the itinerary, you can find people spending their
days in T-shirts, polo shirts, shorts or khakis, plus casual dresses for
women and sweat shirts or light sweaters to compensate for the air-
conditioning. The vibe is about the same on the luxury lines, though
those polos and khakis probably sport better labels. If you’re going on
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
72

an Alaskan or other cold-weather cruise, pack sweat shirts or fleece,
jeans, comfortable (and preferably waterproof) walking shoes, and a
light jacket and/or a waterproof jacket. In the evenings, people typically
dress up, but not to the tux-and-gown level they used to. A lot of main-
stream lines still have two traditional formal nights during any 7-night
itinerary, but most men opt for dark suits over real formalwear, while
women dress in cocktail dresses, sequined jackets, gowns, or the like.
Some other lines are ditching the formal concept entirely. The closest
NCL comes is an “optional formal” captain’s cocktail night, though it’s
totally up to you what you decide to wear — just no shorts in the dining
rooms, please. On lines such as Windstar and Oceania, the dressiest
thing you may ever see is a sport jacket.
On lines that still have delineated formal, informal, and casual nights,
here’s the scoop:
 Formal nights: Imagine what you’d wear to a nice wedding: tuxe-
dos or dark suits for men; cocktail dresses, sequined jackets,
gowns, or other fancy attire for women.
 Informal (or semiformal) nights: Suits or sport jackets and ties for
men; stylish dresses or pantsuits for women.
 Casual nights: Decent pants and collared shirts for men, and
maybe a sport jacket; dresses, skirts, or pantsuits for women.
Suggested dress for the evening is usually printed in the ship’s daily
schedule. Cruise lines also usually describe their dress codes in their
brochures, on their Web sites, and in one of the booklets you get with
your cruise tickets.
Aboard all the small-ship lines we discuss in Chapter 13, it’s very rare to
see anything dressier than a sport jacket at any time, and those usually
appear only for the captain’s dinner. Most of these lines are all-casual all
the time.
Planning for appliances and other odds and ends
If you plan to bring electronic devices, check the information you
receive with your tickets to find out about the power situation on board.
Not all ships use 110 current (although most in North American fleets
do). Even if the ship is 110, you may find only two-pronged jacks rather
than three-pronged, so you may need an adapter. And if you stay at a for-
eign hotel before or after your cruise, you may need a converter kit and
different plugs.
Most ships provide hair dryers, though they’re frequently low-powered
models. If you use one regularly, and have a lightweight model, it can’t
hurt to bring it along. Just be careful where you plug it in. Some cabin
outlets won’t handle heat-producing devices such as dryers, curling
irons, and the like.
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 73

Here are some other things for you to consider:
 Most cabins come with toiletries such as soap and shampoo, and
sometimes conditioner and lotion, although you still may want to
bring your own favorite products. If you forget something, all but
a few of the smallest ships have a shop on board selling razor
blades, toothbrushes, sunscreen, film, and other sundries, usually
at inflated prices.
 Except for the small ships, most vessels have a laundry service and
some dry cleaning, too, with generally about a 24-hour turnaround
time. A price list will be in your cabin. Some ships also have self-
service laundry rooms.
 Most ships have a telephone wake-up service, but you may prefer
to bring your alarm clock.
 Don’t bother with a beach towel. Most cruise lines provide them for
you to take ashore.
 A couple of large freezer-style, reclosable plastic bags come in
handy for protecting your camera and/or binoculars if you partici-
pate in water activities, such as kayaking. And you can also use
them to pack damp bathing suits for the trip home.
 If you want to bring your own gear for sports such as golf or scuba
diving, check with your airline how to transport such items.
 Bring plenty of film, memory disks, and/or batteries for your
camera, and blank cassettes for your camcorder. Merchants will
gouge you for this stuff at touristy areas.
 Learn from our mistakes: Don’t take brand-new shoes that you
haven’t worn in. (Or pack a bunch of adhesive bandages if you do.)
 Airport security forbids the use of locks on your luggage. If you’re
worried about your bags just popping open, you can secure the zip-
pers with keychain rings. Security can take them off easily if they
need to get in.
Packing your carryon
Your carry-on bag (whether you’re carrying it on the plane or just onto
the ship) should contain everything you think you may need for the day,
in case your checked luggage is delayed. Be sure to pack the following:
 Big Important Documents, including your passport, driver’s license,
airline tickets, cruise tickets, boarding forms, and claim checks for
airport parking
 Currency, including credit and debit cards and cash and/or 
traveler’s checks
 House and car keys
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
74

 Valuables, such as jewelry, binoculars, cameras, iPods or Walkmen,
and video equipment
 Eyeglasses and any prescription medicines you may need during
your trip
 A change of clothes
 Motion-sickness medication if you think you may need it, plus hard
candy or chewing gum if you have problems with plugged ears on
takeoff and landing
 Snacks if you’re flying one of those Scrooge-like airlines that have
cut back on food service over the past few years
Keeping in Touch at Sea
In case you’re worried about staying in touch with loved ones, work, or
the sports scores while you’re away, calm down. Today it’s easy — some
people would say too easy — to stay connected while at sea. Whatever
happened to getting away from it all, anyway? In addition to the news
channels on most cabin TVs, some ships still maintain the old tradition of
printing the day’s top news stories and slipping them under passengers’
doors each morning. And then, of course, there are all the gadgets . . .
Cellphone service
Beginning in 2004, technology became available that allows cellphone
users to make and receive calls while aboard ship, even when far out
at sea. Today, Costa Cruises has the Costa Fortuna, Atlantica, Europa,
Romantica, and Tropicale wired up; Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal
Caribbean, and Celebrity are all set to offer cell service fleetwide soon
after this book goes to press; Crystal Cruises’ Crystal Serenity has it going
on; and other lines are eyeing the possibility. Our prediction? Everybody
but the small-ship lines will offer cellular service within a couple years.
The service, usually offered by a company called Wireless Maritime
Service, is available to most passengers with GSM phones that operate
at 900 MHz and 1900 MHz, which are common in the United States. In
addition to regular voice and text messaging, the service — which kicks
in when a ship sails beyond range of shoreside towers — lets passengers
with data-capable GSM/GPRS devices access data services such as e-mail
and picture messaging. Passengers are billed by the carrier to which they
subscribe at roaming rates set by that carrier, just as if they were roam-
ing on land instead of at sea. Expect something in the ballpark of $1.70
per minute.
Satellite phones
As they have for years, cruise ships continue to offer satellite phone
service from their cabins, usually for about $8 or $9 per minute, though
it can climb as high as $15 a minute.
Chapter 5: Ticking Off Your Pre-Cruise Checklist 75

In addition to cabin sat-phones and cell service, each ship has a central
phone number, fax number, and e-mail address, which you can some-
times find in the cruise line’s brochure and usually in the documents you
get with your tickets. Distribute these to family members or friends in
case they have to contact you in an emergency, but be sure they know
the numbers are only for emergencies, since they can easily cost $30 to
$40 for just a minute or two.
It also can’t hurt to leave behind the numbers of the cruise line’s head-
quarters and/or reservations department, both of whom can put people
in touch with you in an emergency situation.
Internet and e-mail at sea
Aside from most of the small, adventure-oriented ships in Chapter 13,
pretty much every cruise ship has an Internet center where passengers
can surf and e-mail to their wallet’s content, at rates calculated on a per-
minute basis (usually between 50¢ and $1) or in pre-purchased blocks
(say, $40 for a 3- or 4-night cruise or $90 for a 7-night cruise).
E-mail access is usually available through the Web via your Earthlink,
AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo!, or other personal account. Some lines also let
you set up an account aboard ship, if you don’t have your own.
Many ships built over the past several years (including the newest
Celebrity, Crystal, Costa, Holland America, NCL, Oceania, Royal
Caribbean, Cunard, Radisson, SeaDream, and Silversea ships) have been
wired with dataports in all, most, or some cabins and suites, allowing
passengers who travel with laptops to log on in privacy. The cost for
these services tends to be higher than access in the Internet centers.
Wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) is another new trend, offered aboard all the
Carnival, Holland America, NCL, and Princess vessels, usually in the
atrium and other designated public rooms. A few ships — the small
luxury ships of Seabourn and the huge new Carnival Valor — offer wire-
less access everywhere on board. To take advantage of this service, you
must have a wireless card for your laptop (or you can rent a card, or a
laptop), then purchase minutes either as you need them or in packages
of 33 to 500 minutes.
Confirming Your Flight
Air arrival and departure times are always subject to change, so take a
minute to call and confirm your flight a day or two before your depar-
ture. You can also call the day you’re scheduled to leave, to avoid having
to wait around the airport if your flight is delayed.
If you follow any special diets, whether vegetarian, kosher, or otherwise,
call the airline in advance to make sure you’ll be fed appropriately on
the plane. Different airlines require different lead times to arrange 
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
76

special meals, but you can bet on the minimum being 24 hours in
advance. Call early.
Get to the airport early. For domestic flights, plan to get there two full
hours before your plane is scheduled to depart. For international flights,
you may want to get in a little earlier than that. In the worst-case sce-
nario, it saves you stress if lines are long at check-in and security. If lines
are short, it gives you time to drink beer and eat nachos at the airport
bar. So what’s the downside?
Remembering Other Important Stuff
Some things to keep in mind before you walk out the door:
 Read all the pre-trip material the cruise line provides you. Do you
have all the requisite IDs? Also, fill out (or at least think about fill-
ing out) the boarding forms they sent. You can also do this on the
plane, or when waiting at the terminal.
 Make photocopies of your passport, your airline tickets, and any
credit cards you plan to use just in case they get separated from
you for any reason. Pack the copies in your luggage separately from
the actual documents (which should be in your carryon). You may
also want to leave another set of copies with a friend.
 Write down the ship’s phone number (it should be included with
your cruise documents), and leave the number and a copy of your
itinerary with a friend or relative.
 Put luggage tags on your bags. The cruise line will send you a set
with your cruise documents, which you have to fill out with your
departure date and port, cabin number, and so on and affix to each
bag so they can be delivered to your cabin.
 Be sure to put your name and address inside your bags, too, just in
case your luggage tags fall off.
 Don’t carry scissors, razor blades, or any other sharp objects in
your hand luggage. Ditto for grenades, poison gas, or toxic waste.
You can pack the former in your checked luggage, but not the
latter. Regulations on what you can and can’t bring with you on the
plane seem to be changing all the time. The latest no-go? Cigarette
lighters. We’ve even been stopped for a tiny little wrench, no more
than three inches long. Seems you can’t bring any tools onto a
plane. Who knew?
 If no one will be at home while you’re away, you may want to call
the post office and arrange for it to hold your mail. Ditto for any
newspapers you have delivered.

I
s your day-to-day life as stressful as ours? If so, that cruise you signed
up for months ago has probably snuck right up on you. Look at that!
It starts tomorrow, and here you are reading this chapter just now.
Luckily, there’s nothing about the boarding process that you won’t be
able to negotiate with aplomb after you get through this patented Matt-
and-Heidi “Coming Aboard” Aplomb-O-Mizer. Ready, get set . . .
Getting to Your Port of Embarkation
So you’re about to begin your trip. Because the cruise lines are home-
porting their ships in several dozen places now instead of from just a
few hub cities, you may be driving or flying to your ship.
Pack your suitcases and don’t forget to attach an ID tag with your name
and address, and maybe your cellphone number. Attach the bag tags
your cruise line sent you, too, which include your sailing date and cabin
number.
If you’re flying
Call the airline before you leave home to ensure that your flight is on
schedule. Also, allow yourself ample time at the airport to check your
bags and get through security screening.
Keep your tickets, cruise documents, passport and other identification,
keys, valuable items, and medicines in a bag you can carry onto the
plane and ship with you, rather than check through. You may also want
to pack a light change of clothes, as a precaution in case you and your
checked luggage get separated.

When you arrive at your destination airport, cruise line representatives
stand at the ready at baggage claim, holding signs bearing your line’s or
ship’s name, and wait to direct you to buses bound for the terminal. You
probably already paid for bus transfers to the ship when you bought
your cruise. If not, you can arrange them now or take a taxi.
If you’ve flown to another country, you need to clear Immigration and
Customs, which includes showing your passport and any forms you
were given on the plane. Follow the appropriate signs. The cruise line
reps will be waiting when you get through the checkpoints.
Arranging transfers through the cruise line
If you booked transfers to the ship through the cruise line, the man or
woman with the sign directs you and your bags to the bus or van that
takes you to the ship. If you haven’t done so already, fill out the luggage
tags the cruise line sent with your tickets (listing your ship name, sailing
date, and cabin number), and put one on each of your bags. The bus
driver usually asks for your transportation voucher, which you also
received with your cruise documents. After you arrive at the port, you
have to ID your luggage and check it in. You usually find an army of
porters to assist you (for a suggested tip of about $2 per bag) and
another army of cruise line employees waiting to direct you to the
check-in desks.
Handling transfers on your own
If you didn’t book the cruise line transfers, gather your luggage from the
baggage area and head to the pier via taxi or whatever other mode of
transportation you’ve arranged.
Find out in advance what the trip from the airport to the port should
cost to avoid getting ripped off. Many airports post information like
that on their Web sites. Don’t forget to put the luggage tags (displaying
your ship name, sailing date, and cabin number) from the cruise line on
your bags.
Some cities have multiple piers, and you can help your cab driver by
having the pier number and directions to the ship handy. The cruise line
should include this information with your documents. If not, you can get
it in advance by contacting the line.
Dealing with a delayed flight
If your flight is delayed, don’t panic. Let the airline personnel know that
you’re a cruise passenger who has a ship to catch that day. They may be
able to put you on a different flight. If you’ve bought air transportation
through the cruise line, the airline may already know you have a cruise
to catch and will try to make other arrangements, and the cruise line will
probably be tracking your progress as well. In any case, have the cruise
line’s emergency number handy (it’s listed in your cruise documents)
just in case you or the airline needs to get in touch. If there’s a forced
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 79

overnight, the airline typically pays for your hotel room. If there’s a
weather delay, air/sea guests are given priority on standby flights to
the port of embarkation, but airlines are unlikely to provide hotel
accommodations.
If you haven’t booked your air travel with the cruise line, you need to
work with the airline to catch your ship in the next port, as well as con-
tact the cruise line to tell them about your situation. In cases like this, it
helps if you’ve bought travel insurance that includes a trip-delay benefit.
See Chapter 4 for more information about travel insurance.
Dealing with lost luggage
If you and your luggage get separated in transit, tell your airline you’re
about to board a cruise. If they can’t get it to you before your ship
departs, they’ll ship it to your first port of call. If you don’t get missing
luggage the first night, you can get an overnight kit, with such items as a
toothbrush, toothpaste, and a razor, from the purser’s office.
If you’ve checked your luggage in with the ship but it never shows up in
your cabin, contact the reception desk. Most likely your luggage tags fell
off and your bags are waiting somewhere on board.
If you’re driving
If you’ve driven to the port, it’s just a matter of parking and trundling
your luggage into the terminal. Most ports have secure parking available
on-site (or at least close by), usually costing $10 to $12 per day.
Checking In at the Pier
What happens when you reach the cruise terminal depends on the ship,
but the check-in process can sometimes be slow as molasses — though
sometimes it’s smooth as silk.
Preparing to board
If it’s still morning or early afternoon, don’t feel rushed. Remember,
another shipload of passengers is probably just getting off from the
ship’s last trip, and cabins still need to be cleaned, supplies loaded, and
paperwork and Customs documents completed properly before you can
board. Even if your ship has been berthed since 6 a.m., new passengers
are often not allowed on board until about 1 p.m., though cruise lines are
increasingly offering a preboarding option — which means you can get
on at 11 a.m. or noon, have lunch, and start checking out the ship,
though your cabin probably won’t be ready till early afternoon.
Beyond the simple joy of feeling that your vacation has started, coming
aboard early affords you some advantages, such as getting choice
appointment times at the spa, signing up for popular shore excursions,
and getting reservations for dinner at the alternative restaurants. Note,
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
80

though, that a lot of cruise lines are offering pre-booking options for
some or all of these, so you may be able to sign up online or over the
phone before you even sail. (See Chapter 4 for details.)
Whether you board early or late, you have to wait in some kind of line to
get your paperwork cleared. Before you do, make sure that you fill out
all the documents the cruise line sent you — the ones marked “Be sure
to fill these out in advance.” You may also want to tidy yourself up a bit,
because there’s sure to be a ship’s photographer lurking somewhere
nearby to take one of those “coming aboard” shots. We’re of two minds
on this: Heidi thinks they’re fun to look at later in the ship’s gallery, even
if you don’t buy them (for $7–$10 a pop); Matt thinks he’s some kind of
secret agent who shouldn’t be photographed under any condition, so he
waves the photographer off every time. And the lesson is, whether you
want your picture taken or not is up to you. You’re under no obligation
to pose.
Checking in
During the check-in process, a cruise line rep examines your tickets and
ID and sets you up with a shipboard ID and an onboard account.
Regarding IDs, proposed new State Department and Homeland Security
regulations mean you almost certainly need a passport to go on any
cruise that visits a foreign port, even if it’s just the Bahamas. If you’re
sailing an Alaska cruise, you may need one, too, if the ship departs from
or ends in Vancouver. See Chapter 5 for more info about getting your
passport. On itineraries that visit multiple countries, your ship often
holds your passport to facilitate clearance procedures. Don’t worry. It’s
normal. You get your passports back when you go ashore.
Shipboard accounts are essentially credit cards you use for everything
you buy on board: drinks, shore excursions, spa treatments, and so on.
To set ’em up, the cruise line rep usually takes an imprint of your credit
card, though you also have the option of leaving a cash or traveler’s
check deposit (usually $250) and settling the difference at the end of
your cruise. Usually, the shipboard ID you’re issued at check-in doubles
as your onboard charge card. Often it’s also your room key. If not, you
either get your key now or pick it up in your cabin where it should be
waiting.
Keep your shipboard ID with you at all times. Not only do you need it
for any purchases you make on board (except aboard some small ships,
where they just jot down your name when you buy something), but you
also need it as ID every time you get on or off your ship in port.
On ships that still follow traditional fixed-seating dining, check-in is often
when you get your dining-room table assignment, too (see Chapter 7 for
more about this), though you may also have received it with your tick-
ets. Either way, make sure your seating time (early or late), table size,
and choice of smoking or nonsmoking section (where applicable) are as
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 81

you want. If not, talk to someone now. If your ship is following a more
casual dining approach, you don’t have to worry about any of this.
If you booked a suite or have mobility problems, you may get priority
check-in and embarkation. Otherwise, boarding lines generally form
alphabetically by last name.
Stepping aboard and checking out your digs
All passengers must clear security just before boarding ship. This
involves stepping through a metal detector, having your hand luggage 
X-rayed, and handing over your shipboard ID for the first time so that
you’re officially counted as “on board.” From here, a crewmember
directs you (and maybe even escorts you) to your cabin, where it makes
sense to spend a little time checking things out. Your cabin steward may
stop by to see that everything is okay and that you know how every-
thing works: the air-conditioning and heating (assuming the system is
individually controlled), the TV, the safe (if your cabin has one), the
shower, the telephone, and any other nifty gadgets. Let the steward
know if anything seems amiss, or if you have any special needs — extra
pillows, for example — or whether you want the beds separate or
pushed together.
Don’t be put off by the big WHOOSH!!! of the toilet. Ships typically use
vacuum toilets, which sound as if they could drag you down if you’re not
careful. Don’t put any foreign objects into the bowl other than the toilet
paper provided — they can clog up the works, creating what’s techni-
cally known as a big mess.
A daily program in your cabin tells you what’s on tap for the rest of the
day, including meal times and dress codes, where applicable.
Your bags may not arrive at your cabin until after the ship leaves the
pier, but don’t be concerned. On the bigger ships, the crew may have to
deliver 5,000 or more bags, which can take time. Because of this, dinner
on the first night is always casual. If you start to worry as the night goes
on, give the purser’s office a call.
A few other bits of info you should know:
 Tap water on ships is potable, but it may have a strong chlorine
taste. Many ships also leave bottled water in the cabins, but just
because it’s there doesn’t mean it’s free. Ditto for items in the mini-
bar, unless you’re sailing on a really swanky vessel. A card some-
where nearby should indicate the prices.
 Directions near the phone tell you how to make calls to other pas-
sengers and ship personnel, as well as how to dial home from the
ship (though there are cheaper options — see Chapter 5).
 You should find a little binder detailing ship services, including room
service. There should also be a Do Not Disturb sign (important for
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
82

nappers), forms and bags for the ship’s laundry and dry cleaning
services (offered on all but the smallest ships), and probably a deck
plan showing what’s where on your vessel.
 Most ships have personal safes somewhere in the cabin. Some lock
with a numerical code that you program in, while others recognize
your key card. They’re not big, but they’re more than adequate for
storing your passports, plane tickets, jewelry, and other valuables.
If your ship doesn’t have personal safes, you can check valuables at
the purser’s desk.
Exploring the Ship
We suggest you spend some of your time on the first day exploring the
ship. Carry your shipboard credit card (in case you want to buy a drink),
your cabin key, and a deck plan. If there’s no deck plan in your cabin, ask
at the reception desk. Some ships — especially the really big ones —
offer guided tours on embarkation day, but what’s the fun in that? We
much prefer just wandering around and scoping out cozy nooks and
comfortable barstools, and maybe grabbing a bite at the welcome-
aboard buffet.
Getting a jump on your fellow passengers
You may have been able to pre-book shore excursions, spa times, and
reservations at the ship’s alternative restaurant before your cruise (see
Chapter 4 for more about this), but if not, now’s the time to get in line so
that you don’t get shut out of the best spots. This is especially important
if you’ve got your eye on a specialized shore excursion that’s limited to
only a certain number of guests, or if you want a prime time slot such as
an appointment with the hair stylist right before dinner on formal nights,
or a massage appointment at midafternoon on a day at sea.
If you prefer to keep your week flexible, note that you don’t have to sign
up for anything early if you don’t want to. You can generally sign up for
shore excursions until the day before they’re scheduled, and can some-
times get an appointment at the spa at the last minute.
While you’re at the spa, you may be asked if you’d like a tour to get
acquainted with what the facility offers. This translates as “Look at all
the good things we can do for you. Give us your money. Giiiive ussssss
yourrrrr moooooneeeeeey.” Keep your willpower shields up unless
you’re in a buying mood. Ditto for the pitches you often hear at the
shore excursion manager’s shore talks, which often give a pretty heavy
pitch to certain shops on shore that you just have to hit. Yah. Right. Oh,
and speaking of separating passengers from their money, note that the
casino and shops are closed until the ship is actually at sea, in accor-
dance with government regulations. Sometimes the swimming pool is
also covered until after embarkation. But of course that’s free.
Chapter 6: Embarkation Day 83

If your ship has a library of videos or DVDs for watching in your cabin,
you may also want to drop by there early to get the best selection.
Sailing away
You may want to be on the deck, drink in hand, when the ship leaves the
pier. The nostalgic appeal alone makes it worthwhile (“Arrivederci! Don’t
forget to write!”), but some ships offer complimentary champagne to
sweeten the deal.
Attending the Safety Drill
Ships are required by law to hold a safety drill within 24 hours of depar-
ture, and most lines get it out of the way either right before or right after
sailing out of port. Attendance is mandatory, and stewards often check
your cabin to make sure you’re not hiding out.
In your cabin, you should find a bright-orange life jacket for each passen-
ger, including special ones for any kids in your cabin (if they’re not there,
let your cabin steward know immediately). Features on the jackets include
a whistle and a light that turns on automatically when it hits water.
The ship’s daily program lists the time of your drill, and the captain also
makes several announcements over the ship’s PA as drill time gets close.
When you hear the signal (seven short blasts on the ship’s alarm whistle,
followed by one long blast), collect your life jacket and follow the signs to
your designated muster station, whose number is written both on the
back of your cabin door and on your life jacket. You go to this place in
case of a real emergency, too. Ship staff is posted in corridors and stair-
ways to direct you, if you don’t know exactly where you’re going.
Although some drills are very brief, others can go on for a half-hour or
more. Sorry, no drinks allowed, but we’ve had fun during long drills by
taking pictures of each other in our puffy orange vests, looking like the
Michelin Man.
Gearing Up for the Days Ahead
In general, life on a big ship can follow a kind of bipolar logic: On the one
hand, you’re taking a trip to visit some places you haven’t seen before;
on the other, you may get into such a cruise zone that you don’t want to
leave the ship, shuttling from pool to lounge to buffet to spa to virtual-
golf simulator to basketball court to lecture to sports bar. Try for the
middle path. It works for Buddhism, so it should work for you.
The following two sections detail what you can expect when the ship is
in port and at sea.
Part II: Planning Your Cruise 
84

One if by land: Days ashore
Map out your days in port to make sure you see all that the destination
offers. Decide ahead of time whether you want to take an excursion or
go off on your own; whether there are cultural attractions, natural won-
ders, or shopping zones that pique your interest; and whether you want
to lunch locally or on the ship. (Check out the chapters in Part V for
specifics on the ports of call.) To make sure that you don’t miss the
boat — literally — take careful note of your ship’s departure time.
At some ports, your ship docks in or near the center of town. At others,
you dock in a far-off passenger or commercial port and have to take a
taxi or bus to town. At still other ports, there’s no dock at all, so your
ship anchors offshore and shuttles passengers back and forth via a
small boat called a tender. To catch a lift on a tender, you usually go to a
lounge area and take a number. Although you get a lower number and
get ashore earlier if you get to the lounge earlier, the lines tend to be
longer first thing in the morning, so sometimes you’re better off linger-
ing over a second cup of coffee than rushing to the lounge to wait in line.
If you signed up in advance for a shore excursion, you’re assigned a time
and place to meet, and get priority group debarkation.
Don’t feel like you have to get off at every port of call, but you may want
to at least stretch your legs and get some exercise. On big ships espe-
cially, some people stay on the ship, which takes on a haunting yet
appealing aura when the crowds disappear. The pool may be closed,
but you can still sit on the Sun Deck, take spa treatments, use the gym
(which is less crowded on port days), play cards, eat lunch, and enjoy
some quiet time. On port days, the ship generally offers fewer organized
activities, but you can still find offerings such as movies, live music pool-
side, a few seminars, and maybe a sports competition or two.
Two if by sea: Days at sea
If you sail on a big ship, brace yourself for a staggering array of sea-day
activities, especially in the Caribbean and Mexican Riviera, where typical
offerings include exercise classes, lectures, movies, beauty seminars
(such as “How to Fight Cellulite”), pool games, dance classes, and con-
tests that range from golf putting to hairy backs and knobby knees (the
hairiest and knobbiest win).
Sea days on Alaskan cruises are a bit more destination-oriented, with the
ships visiting glaciers and areas known for exemplary whale-watching.
Wildlife and glacier experts are often on board to explain more about the
area’s natural wonders. Other activities may be closed or at least pared
down when the ship is scheduled to cruise in and around the more
extravagant natural wonders, such as Glacier Bay, Tracy Arm Fjord, or
Hubbard Glacier.
Sea days in other cruise regions are similar to the above. As a general
rule, small ships rarely spend entire days at sea unless they’re exploring
natural areas (such as Glacier Bay).

An onboard who’s who
So, just who are all those people walking around in the spiffy uniforms anyway?
 Captain: The big boss (may also be referred to as The Master); he’s in charge.
 Staff captain: Second in command; normally in charge of navigation and safety.
 Hotel manager: In charge of passenger services, including restaurants, bars, and
accommodations. If you need someone to complain to in these areas, the buck
stops here.
 Chief engineer: In charge of all the onboard machinery, including the engines.
 Purser: In charge of information and financial matters. This person delivers your
bill at the end of the cruise.
 Chief steward: In charge of making sure all cabins and public rooms are cleaned
and maintained.
 Cabin stewards: The people who clean the cabins.
 Head chef or chef de cuisine: In charge of the kitchen (galley) and the menus.
 Maitre d’: In charge of the dining room operation.
 Dining stewards: A fancy name for waiters.
 Assistant waiters: Used to be known as busboys.
 Sommeliers: Wine experts who take your wine order and take you through the
whole sniffing, sipping, nodding ritual; handled by the dining steward on many
ships.
 Cruise director: In charge of all activities and entertainment; also acts as the ship’s
emcee.
 Shore excursion director: In charge of land tours; also often the port lecturer.
 Entertainment director: Heads the show team.
 Doctor: In charge of medical care.

his is what cruising is all about: drinking beer in the hot
tub, loading a mountain of food onto your buffet platter,
and joining really stupid pool games. No, wait, this is what
cruising is all about: going to a wine-tasting session; eating
sushi at a small, high-toned Asian restaurant; and attending a
lecture on the history of transatlantic passenger sailing. No,
wait, this . . . well anyway, whatever cruising is about for you,
we cover it here, along with practicalities such as how to nav-
igate embarkation day and how to navigate the cruise lines’

Chapter 7
Wining and Dining
In This Chapter

 Checking out traditional dining
 Considering alternative dinner options
 Doing breakfast and lunch
F
ood. We’re all obsessed with it in one way or the other. And the
cruise lines sure haven’t been shy about capitalizing on it. A cruise
ship is a veritable feeding frenzy; only your willpower stands between
you and a few new pounds. To please all palates and schedules, you’ll
find that food is available 24 hours a day, if not more — from pizza, burg-
ers, and soft ice cream to buffets that seem endless and candlelit meals
in dark cozy restaurants. Except for the very smallest 100-passenger
ships, the bigger the ship the more eating opportunities you can find. On
the largest megaships, expect eight to ten different venues. Aside from
one or two more traditional dining rooms, you can find a casual buffet
restaurant open all day, plus specialty outlets ranging from sushi bars to
steakhouses, diner-style burger joints, romantic French restaurants, and
the list goes on. As if that’s not enough, 24-hour room service is stan-
dard, and often the pickins include pizza delivery.
Though overeating is pretty difficult to avoid, you don’t have to gain an
extra five pounds on a weeklong cruise. Ships offer healthier options for
noshing, such as fruit and fish, plus most ships have great well-stocked
gyms and fitness classes. Better yet, you can vow to take the stairs and
not the elevator. On today’s huge ships, that’s quite an opportunity to
burn calories. In port, sign up for active stuff such as biking and kayak-
ing, and just you see, you may actually return home a skinnier version of
your former self. Do we see a Jenny Craig endorsement in your future?
Never a Food-Free Moment
Endless: The key word for cruise ship eating. Check out this typical meal
schedule to understand what’s meant by that old joke, “You come on as
a passenger and you leave as cargo”:

 Early risers: (6:30 a.m.) Coffee and simple pastries
 Buffet breakfast: (7:30–11 a.m.) Daily specials, sweet rolls, fruit,
eggs, bacon, French toast, cereal, oatmeal, omletes, yogurt, crois-
sants, coffee, juice, and tea
 Breakfast in the dining room: (Main seating begins around 7 a.m.;
late seating around 8 or 9 a.m.) Full breakfast, including omelets,
eggs, French toast, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fish,
cereal, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, and juices
 Pizza: (11 a.m.–11 p.m.) Serving up fresh pies all day; some outlets
also have salads
 Buffet lunch: (11:30 a.m.–3 p.m.) Full hot and cold lunch offerings,
including salad bar, pasta station, and grill for burgers
 Lunch in the dining room: (Main seating at noon; late seating at
1:30 p.m.) Full luncheon with a rotating menu of hot dishes, salads,
sandwiches, pastas, grilled items, and desserts
 Afternoon tea: (3:30–5 p.m.) Tea and cake or cookies
 Snack time: (All afternoon) Ice cream and fat-free frozen yogurt
 Buffet dinner: (5:30–11 p.m) Casual setting and hot and cold
entrees, sometimes focused on a theme cuisine like Asian or Italian;
carved beef, ham, or turkey; desserts; salads; cold meats; breads;
cheeses; and fruit
 Dinner in the dining room: (Early seating at 6 p.m.; late seating at
8:15 p.m.) Gourmet cuisine, including popular international and
American dishes served in seven courses with desserts
 Midnight buffet: (Guess!) Extravagant offerings of hot and cold
entrees, desserts, salads, cold meats, breads, cheeses, and fruit
Still hungry? Well, seek out the coffee bars many ships have that dis-
pense specialty drinks such as espressos and cappuccino, plus gourmet
ice cream and fancy pastries. Some bars also offer caviar with all the
trimmings. Just keep in mind, all of this stuff will cost you extra.
The Take on Traditional Dining
Like a big resort, you can find multiple dining options on most ships
these days. The traditional set-up, where guests reserve the early or late
seating in one of the main dining rooms, is still offered on most ships.
The ship takes care of assigning you to a table that seats four, six, eight,
or more people, who you share dinner with every evening in the main
dining room.
Ships offer a very limited number of tables for two, so don’t expect to
snag one, though it can’t hurt to ask.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
90

If you go the traditional way because maybe you like the prospect of
meeting your fellow shipmates, sitting at a table with eight seats gives
you enough variety among your companions that you don’t get bored.
This also allows you to steer clear of a bore or some other person at the
table you really don’t like. Don’t feel that the chair you sit in the first
night needs to be your place every night — the ship assigns you to a
table, not a specific seat. Go crazy by choosing a different seat each
night to get the most out of the opportunity to mingle.
Don’t panic if you end up sitting next to some obnoxious type who
chews with his mouth open and keeps shouting “What’s with all these
forks?” Try to change your table by speaking with the maitre d’ (greasing
his palm may help). You can also request a larger or smaller table by vis-
iting the maitre d’ station on the first day of the cruise.
Dining course by course
Traditional dining aboard a cruise ship provides more than a five- to
seven-course meal; it serves as one of the main social events of the
day. With the multiple courses served at a relaxed pace and your table
dressed in china, silver, fresh flowers, and starched linens, you can’t get
further from a fast-food experience.
Expect to be at your table for at least an hour and a half. Here’s what
you’re likely to find:
 Overall, count on continental (international) cuisine in the dining
room — think steaks, chicken, fish, and pasta.
 The courses consist of an appetizer, soup, salad, main course (with
starch and vegetables), and dessert, and on some ships pasta, fruit,
and cheese courses as well.
 Most lines provide at least one healthy selection in each category,
sometimes even listing the fat, salt content, and number of calories
on the menu. A few lines, including Carnival and Crystal, have joined
the low-carb craze, offering special menu items for followers of low-
carb diets.
 Most ships feature daily vegetarian selections.
 Children’s menus are common.
 On some nights, the ship builds the menus around a theme, such as
Caribbean or Italian night.
Feel free to make a culinary request if you have an urge for something in
particular, but remember that the chef can prepare dishes only with
what’s available in the larder (no running out to the grocery store here).
Make your requests the day before so that the chef can prepare.
Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 91

Considering what to wear
Most 7-night cruises include two formal nights, where the dress code sug-
gests men wear suits or tuxes, and for the ladies, fancy dresses or pant
suits. Of course, one person’s formalwear may be wildly different from
another’s (believe us, we’ve seen it all!). A good rule of thumb is to wear
what you’d wear to a wedding (not your own silly, but someone else’s).
To skip the dressy duds, hit the more casual dining venues on formal
nights (see the next section), where you can get away with much more
casual garb, such as chinos and polo shirts. In general, lines discourage
jeans and shorts at dinner ship-wide, but we see that, too; it’s at the
maitre d’s discretion whether you have to go back to your cabin and
change into something deemed more presentable.
A Sea of Other Dining Options
If this traditional dining stuff sounds too regimented for you, no prob-
lem, most ships have supplemented the traditional set-up with other
more flexible options as well. You can find at least one, if not many,
casual venues operating nightly without fixed seating times. Norwegian
Cruise Line, for example, operates all of its restaurants like this — you
decide where, when, and with whom you want to dine. On Princess
ships, you have the choice to either dine the traditional way or with
open seating, but you must pick one option when you book your cruise.
These lines, and just about every other line, too, give you the option
(depending on the ship you choose) of dining in a smaller gourmet
restaurant. These venues are intimate and more like a fine restaurant on
land, with a higher level of service (usually the ship’s best waiters are
sent to these spots), more expertly prepared food, and plenty of tables
for two, so you don’t have to sit with other passengers. The lines usually
decorate them in upscale décor and focus on one type of cuisine —
Italian, Asian, French, and steakhouses are the most popular. You typi-
cally have to pay a service fee ($10–$30 per head) and reserve your
table in advance (do so early on in the cruise or you may not get a spot).
Many ships also offer a free casual alternative dinner option — an open-
seating, no-reservations-required, casual dress affair, most often in the
main buffet restaurant. Sometimes the buffet spread is supplemented with
a short menu of simple food such as steaks, grilled fish, pasta, and salads.
Generally, this option is available until late, sometimes past midnight.
Of course, the ultracasual alternative is room service. The menu may
be limited, but you don’t have to put on your formal duds — or any
duds at all!
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
92

Making special dietary requests
If you have any special dietary needs, make arrangements with the ship
when you book your cruise. After you board, check with the maitre d’
your first day out to make sure that the kitchen got your request. Some
lines offer kosher menus and most have vegetarian, low-fat, low-salt, or
sugar-free options.
Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 93
Cruise lines with the best taste
Kudos to these cruise lines for their excellent cuisine. If you’re a foodie, you’ll want to
go with one of these lines, as they offer the best gourmet cuisine at sea.
 Crystal: The best Asian food afloat, as well as ultratasty cuisine all around. A guest
chef series brings celebrity chefs aboard. Plus, you’ll find Kosher dishes and low-
carb choices are always available.
 Seabourn: Celebrity chef Charlie Palmer consults on cuisine that reflects California
and Pacific Rim influences but also includes favorites such as broiled lobster and
beef Wellington.
 SeaDream: This line does just about everything right, with the chefs using fresh
ingredients in creative ways. And no special request gets denied.
 Radisson Seven Seas: Combining traditional and new cuisine, Seven Seas menus
are tops. The Seven Seas Mariner and Seven Seas Voyager also have specialty
restaurants overseen by chefs from the prestigious French cooking school, Le
Cordon Bleu. On some sailings, these chefs offer cooking classes.
 Silversea: French-influenced recipes and great steaks cooked to order, as well
as themed buffets, guest chefs, and a specialty restaurant by Spain’s renowned
chef Joachim Koeper. Service is first rate.
Although not quite as extravagant, these lines are also worth a mention:
 Cunard: On the Queen Mary 2, Cunard assigns you to a restaurant based on your
cabin category, and if you’re in the Queen’s or Princess Grill, expect the best.
Celebrity chef Todd English also has his first shipboard restaurant on this vessel.
 Oceania: Excellent alternative dining at a steakhouse and Italian restaurant, each
with beautiful décor and huge portions.
 Celebrity: Consulting chef Michel Roux creates a meal that lasts a luxurious three
hours and thrills the palate for the reservations-only alternative restaurants on
the Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation.
 Windstar: Top Los Angeles restaurateur Joachim Splichal consults on fresh and
creative menus that go way beyond what you may expect from a sailing ship.

Satisfying your beverage preferences
If you’re a soda junkie, no need to break the bank; many lines have a deal
where you can buy a prepaid drink pass, instead of doling out the usual
$1.50 to $2 a pop (excuse the pun). Often you’re issued a special drink
card or given a special cup that you use for unlimited refills of fountain
soda (mind you, canned sodas are not included in these promotions).
Typically, the price is $35 to $45 for an adult soda card for a weeklong
cruise. Prices are lower for children.
Unsure about how to select wine? Consult the wine steward (if your
ship has one) or find out whether the ship offers a wine tasting seminar
during the cruise. A small fee is typically involved for the seminar (prob-
ably $5 or $10), but you get to sample several varieties, and if you find
something you like, you can order on the spot (a waiter delivers your
wine later to your table in the dining room). You may even get to buy the
wine at a discount.
Digging into Breakfast and Lunch
Breakfast and lunch in the dining room are multicourse events. Menus
generally change daily. As with dinner, the service isn’t rushed, making
the meal more about having an experience and less about filling your
belly. If you’re in a hurry or just don’t want to deal with the formalities,
you can take advantage of the casual buffet — often located near the
Pool Deck.
For lunch, you may have a deck-side grill option with hot dogs, burgers,
and chicken. And the newest ships offer even more: On Royal Caribbean’s
giant Voyager of the Seas and its sister ships, for example, a Johnny
Rockets diner caters to cruisers who crave a good burger and shake. The
Disney ships have a poolside snack bar serving chicken fingers, fries, and
other tasty fast-food treats.

Mastering dining room etiquette
Even the most socially polished cruisers may need some pointers on shipboard dining.
Here are the highlights:
Do’s
Display good manners in the dining room by following these tips:
 Arrive in the dining room on time. Dining hours are listed in the daily program.
 Display your understanding of what the members of the dining staff do. Order
from the waiter, not the bus boy.

Chapter 7: Wining and Dining 95
 Offer wine to the others at your table. If your tablemates are as polite as you are,
one of them will order the next night’s bottle.
 If you don’t finish your bottle of wine, ask your waiter to have it corked. You can
have it held for the next night.
 Consider the waiter’s suggestion about menu items or specials. The waiter can
tell you the most popular menu items.
Don’ts
To keep from embarrassing yourself or your dining companions, don’t do the 
following:
 Don’t start eating until the waiter serves everyone at your table. This is good eti-
quette no matter where you dine.
 Don’t show up dressed inappropriately for the evening. Check your daily bulletin
for the dress code for the evening and prepare accordingly.
 Don’t use the incorrect silverware. Use your silverware moving from the outside
in. The first fork on the left is the one that you use for the first course.
 Don’t feel as if you have to eat a meal you don’t like. Feel free to send food back
and ask for something else if you don’t like your selection.
 Don’t smoke. Just about all ships have completely nonsmoking dining rooms.

Yaaaaawn! Is it morning already? You open your eyes. Yep, there’s
light coming in around those drawn shades. No alarm clock, of
course. You’re on vacation, why would you set one? And if it’s a day at
sea, you don’t have anywhere to be if you don’t want to. You shuffle
across the room, throw open the shades. Hey! There’s an ocean out
there? Your head hurts a little from all that champagne last night, but
that’s nothing some scrambled eggs and a few minutes in the sauna
won’t cure. Now let’s see, what to do after that? Go swimming? Take a
class? Watch a movie? Where’s that daily planner? Let’s see what there
is to do . . .
Digging into the Daily Bulletin
On all but the smallest ships, a daily bulletin is typically delivered to
your cabin each evening, advising you of everything that’s going on the
next day, and other info pertinent to onboard life such as the following:
 The day’s activities and live entertainment
 Hours of operation for the bars and shops (with sales and specials
noted)

 The evening dress code, if there is one
 Listings of in-cabin TV programs and movie presentations
 A schedule of exercise classes and fitness/wellness lectures
 Details about upcoming ports of call (such as shopping hot spots
and top attractions)
 Facts about the region you’re sailing through
 All-aboard time, if the ship is spending a day in port
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, and, like your local newspaper at home,
“advertising” supplements may be stuffed in with the bulletin, promoting
special deals at the ship’s shops, spa promotions, and other ways to
part you from your cash.
Depending on the line you sail with, your bulletin may offer up to 50
activities every day, designed so that everybody on board can find
something that suits their tastes. Other ships offer almost no activities,
catering instead to an audience that likes to do things at their own pace.
Doing Absolutely Nothing at All
On days at sea especially, you’re faced with something most folks don’t
often get in their day-to-day lives: a full day to do anything you want, at
any time you want. You may respond by going into zombie hammock
opium-den mode, so blissed-out from the sun, the lack of responsibility,
and the motherly rocking of the ship that you can’t even rise out of your
deck chair. And why should you? We’ve gotten in this mode more times
than we can remember, and recommend it highly.
Lounging at the pool
The Pool Deck is the center of daytime activity on most warm-weather
itineraries: a spinning vortex of goofy poolside games, live music, hot
tubs, and eternal piña coladas. Most modern megaships have enough
deck chairs to go around, but claim a spot early if you want to be at
pool-central all day. Be fair, though: Don’t just put your towel and book
on a chair then walk away for hours. Other folks deserve a chance, too.
Surprisingly, you may not actually swim much at all while on board —
most ship pools are just too small. The pool, then, is more of a place for
taking a quick cooling dip or a long, leisurely soak while you check out
the other passengers in their swimsuits.
If you’re more into the idea of relaxing in the sun and reading a book, the
Pool Deck probably isn’t for you. For that, you can usually find an abun-
dance of chairs on the uppermost deck and sometimes the Promenade
or Boat Deck, or in hidden little nooks in the stern that get little foot traf-
fic. A few cruise lines, such as Disney, Princess, Royal Caribbean, and
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 97

Carnival (on their Spirit-class ships), have gotten hip to the notion that
some people prefer their pool experience to be calm and quiet, and have
provided a separate adults-only pool where, at least in theory, kids are
excluded. Though be warned that it doesn’t always work out that way.
Sleuthing out the cinema
Most of the larger cruise ships either have dedicated movie theaters or
(more commonly) show recent-release films in the main theater. Disney
Cruise Line, whose ships offer marvelous movie theaters with stadium
seating, big screens, comfy chairs, and first-run films (from Disney-owned
studios, of course), is the unquestioned leader here. Some Holland
America ships have dedicated movie theaters, too, with free popcorn.
Hiding out in your cabin
If you prefer a really quiet day or you spent too much time in the sun the
first day, there’s nothing saying you have to leave your cabin at all. Room
service can bring you enough food and drink to choke a horse, and all but
the smallest ships show recent-release films and sometimes classics on
their cabin TVs, as well as TV shows from A&E, the Discovery Channel,
ESPN, HBO, History & Biography, and TNT. Some ships have programming
available in several languages, to suit a diverse clientele.
Some of the newer ships (including those in the Royal Caribbean and
Celebrity fleets) also offer pay-per-view options, ranging from G to X rat-
ings. Other ships have installed DVD players in their cabins, with movies
available for checkout from the ship’s library.
Another viewing option is, well, you. A few ships videotape activities
to make sure that no one misses anything, and replay them on the TV
system. You may be able to watch yourself doing the limbo at a poolside
party from your own room — which may make for good or bad viewing,
depending on the kind of night you had. Holland America videotapes
cooking demonstrations at its onboard Culinary Arts Centers and beams
them into cabin TVs afterward.
Learning as You Lounge
Most ships, whether mainstream megaships, ultraluxury vessels, or small
adventure-oriented craft, offer at least some lectures, demonstrations,
and seminars, sometimes on general subjects and sometimes on subjects
matched to your sailing region. Topics may include the following:
 History and culture: The history of transatlantic cruising on a
transatlantic cruise, for example, or a lecture on Alaskan Native 
culture while sailing the Inside Passage.
 Natural history and marine biology: Maybe rain forest ecology
while sailing Central America, a lecture on volcanoes while sailing
in Hawaii, or a lesson in whale behavior in Alaska.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
98

 Computer applications: Sometimes practical ones such as word
processing or spreadsheet software; sometimes more creative ones
such as photo-imaging or Web design software.
 Health and nutrition: Including weight-loss and diet seminars.
 Lifestyle topics: Including personal investing, handwriting analysis,
or scrapbook creation.
 The arts: Digital photography workshops are big these days, join-
ing old favorites such as flower arranging. Princess Cruises also
offers ceramics workshops on some of its ships.
 The “classics”: Classes in napkin-folding, vegetable-carving, scarf-
tying, and mixology have been offered aboard cruise ships since
Eisenhower was president.
Think of these classes more as fun and informative diversions than as
something you can add to your resume. On the other hand, they can
sometimes provide a good first insight into something you can pursue
further after you get home.
In addition to these kinds of lectures, many cruise lines also offer regular
guided explorations in several other fields.
 As part of their guest lecturer programs, cruise lines often invite
famous or simply notable speakers aboard to speak on their sub-
ject of expertise. For example, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) had
former Florida senator and presidential aspirant Bob Graham
aboard one of its Alaska cruises in summer 2005, speaking about
the importance of good intelligence in international relations. Other
speakers are less well known. Princess, for instance, used to regu-
larly host a former Scotland Yard detective who had decades of sto-
ries from the underworld, and knew how to tell them.
 Dance classes are usually available, most frequently in salsa, coun-
try, and ballroom styles. Most are taught by the ship’s onboard
entertainers.
 Cooking demonstrations are all the rage with cruise lines, often pre-
sented like you see them on TV, complete with model kitchen and
video monitors for an up-close view of the preparations. Holland
America is particularly big on these, with special theaters installed
for this purpose aboard nearly all of their ships.
 Similarly, many lines offer wine-tasting seminars, conducted by the
ship’s sommeliers or sometimes by guest experts. Royal Caribbean’s
Navigator of the Seas and Mariner of the Seas both have wine bars
created in association with Mondavi and several other California
vineyards. Classes in wine appreciation are held there throughout
the week, and passengers can stage their own tastings by ordering
special “wine flight” tasting menus.
 On most megaships and many luxury ships, staff from the gym, spa,
and beauty salon offer seminars on health, beauty, and fitness,
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 99

with topics including skin and hair care, detox for weight loss,
and wrinkle reductions. These seminars are free, but their ulterior
motive is convincing you to sign up for expensive treatments or
personal-training sessions. Go anyway if you’re interested; you can
just say no to the rest.
 In general, the ultraluxury lines have the most refined and interest-
ing enrichment programs. Crystal, for example, offers classes
developed with the Society of Wine Educators, Berlitz, Pepperdine
University, Sotheby’s, Barnes&Noble.com, and other notable insti-
tutions, all of which provide lecturers on topics such as food and
wine, arts and entertainment, business and technology, lifestyle
(including interior design, book clubs, and language instruction),
and wellness. The wine and food seminars include cocktail making,
wine appreciation, chocolate, spa cuisine, and — one close to our
hearts — beer essentials.
Aboard Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, transatlantic crossings offer a simi-
lar program developed in association with Oxford University, fea-
turing talks on history, global politics, cultural trends, theater,
science, music, literature, and more.
 The small, adventure-oriented ships frequently offer a daily round
of informal lectures by their onboard naturalists and historians,
sometimes once a day (usually after dinner), sometimes several
times a day.
 And, sometimes, there are lectures that come out of left field. Aboard
Royal Caribbean’s Voyager-class vessels, for instance, resident
Krooze Komics offer lectures on clown history and techniques, and
teach classes in juggling. How fun is that?
Most lectures and some classes are free, though others (such as wine
tastings and many computer classes) may carry a small fee.
Feeling the Burn
Yo, gym rats, don’t think cruise ships are going to let you down. Back in
the day (think Titanic), ship gyms were stuck down somewhere between
the kitchen and the bilge, and looked like, well, gyms — the kind they
had back then: dark, sweaty, with weights and those things that looked
like bowling pins and those machines with the big strap that you put
around your waist and just sorta jiggled around.
All that’s changed over the past ten years or so. Beginning in the early to
mid-1990s, the gyms on new ships migrated from below sea level to pre-
mium spots way up on the top decks, with all the newest equipment,
trendy fitness classes, and wraparound windows to provide a view. Spas
also became big business, as cruise lines capitalized on wellness trends,
and several lines also began building larger onboard sports areas, from
miniature golf to virtual golf to basketball and even ice-skating.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
100

Pumping iron
Gyms on the megaships typically have a dozen or more treadmills and
just as many step machines, stationary bikes, and elliptical trainers, plus
aerobics rooms, saunas, full circuits of weight machines, racks of dumb-
bells, and the usual gym amenities: locker rooms, piles of towels, and
cold, cold water. The best gym facilities are on Carnival’s Conquest-,
Spirit-, and Destiny-class ships; Princess’s Grand- and Coral-class ships;
NCL’s Dawn, Spirit, Star, Jewel, Sun, and Pride of Aloha; Royal Caribbean’s
Radiance- and Voyager-class ships; Holland America’s Vista-class ships;
and Celebrity’s Millennium-class ships.
Working out on your own is always free, as are most basic aerobics and
stretching classes. Trendier classes — such as spinning, Pilates, yoga,
boxing, tai chi, or self-defense — usually cost about $10 or $12 a class,
with some ships offering unlimited weeklong passes (for around $70),
as well as personal training sessions (also around $70 or $75).
Almost every ship offers some kind of jogging track, either a dedicated one
with a track-type surface or simply a continuous loop of regular decking.
As a general rule, the smaller the ship, the smaller the gym, though there
are exceptions. Windstar’s 308-passenger Wind Surf has a surprisingly
large gym and spa facilities, while the gyms on Princess’s otherwise glo-
rious Diamond and Sapphire Princess are too small considering the
ships’ 2,670-passenger size. The really small adventure-oriented ships
rarely have gyms at all, but they compensate with off-ship options such
as kayaking and hiking.
Getting a game going
If sports are your thing (either the team or the individual variety), plan
to book aboard one of the really big ships. Royal Caribbean’s enormous
Voyager-class ships (the biggest in the world next to Cunard’s QM2)
have everything from a full-size basketball court to an outdoor rock-
climbing wall, an in-line skating track, a running track, an ice-skating
rink, miniature golf, and a virtual golf simulator (see more about golf in
the “Hitting the links” section later in this chapter). The rock-climbing
walls proved so popular they’re now a bonafide RCI icon, and were
added to the entire fleet. Other Royal Caribbean ships have cool sports
options of their own. During her 2005 refurbishment, Enchantment of the
Seas was outfitted with bungee trampolines.
Hitting the water
The small luxury ships are best for people who want to hit the water
right from the vessel. All the Windstar, Seabourn, and SeaDream ships
and Star Clippers’ Royal Clipper have retractable watersports platforms
that can be lowered from the stern when the ship is at anchor in calm
waters, letting passengers windsurf, kayak, sail, water-ski, go on banana-
boat rides, and sometimes swim and snorkel right from the ship.
SeaDream’s 110-passenger yachts even carry jet skis.
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 101

Hitting the links
Over the past few years, a lot of cruise lines have ramped up their golf
offerings, adding hundreds of golf shore excursions as well as onboard
instruction, virtual golf, pro shops, and other amenities.
Almost all the major cruise lines offer some of these, but Carnival (www.
carnivalgolf.com), Holland America (www.hollandamericagolf.
com), Celebrity (www.celebritycruisesgolf.com), Seabourn (www.
seabourngolf.com), Princess (www.princessgolf.com), and Silversea
(www.silverseagolf.com) go the extra mile, featuring programs cre-
ated by Florida’s Elite Golf Cruises (www.elitegolfcruises.com) that
offer instruction, guided golf excursions in almost every port of call,
computer simulators that mimic play on some of the world’s great
courses, professional onboard club fitting (with options to rent or buy),
and other pro shop–style extras.
On its new Hawaii-based ships, Norwegian Cruise Line has created a
major golf program that offers excursion packages at several courses
each day, bookable either singly or as a package deal. Golf shoes and a
variety of Callaway clubs are available for rent on board, and golf equip-
ment and accessories are for sale in the onboard pro shop.
SeaDream Yacht Club’s 110-passenger vessels are also equipped with
golf simulators as well as Orlimar titanium drivers and irons. Royal
Caribbean offers golf simulators and miniature golf on their Radiance-
and Voyager-class ships, plus Splendour and Legend of the Seas, and golf
excursions in select ports.
Sitting down for sports
All this talk about sports got you tired? Or, alternately, are you just more
of an indoor sports kinda person?
Pub-sport enthusiasts can get their kicks on a number of ships. All NCL
ships have dartboards in their pubs, while Royal Caribbean’s Radiance-
class ships have gyro-balanced pool tables. Practically every ship has a
card room where you can expect bridge to be the most popular game.
Some ships carry a bridge instructor on board and offer tournaments.
The card rooms often provide decks of cards. According to one of our
spies, there’s a brisk pick-up trade in Texas Hold ’Em poker in the card
rooms on NCL’s Hawaii-based ships, which lack a casino due to Hawaiian
gambling restrictions. Shhhh. Mum’s the word.
Most megaships and some mid-size ships have sports bars with large-
screen TVs broadcasting ESPN and whatever live games are available
that day. Carnival’s recently launched Carnival Liberty and Princess’s
Golden, Star, and Caribbean Princess all have giant 300-square-foot digital
TV/movie screens mounted out on their Pool Decks, where they broad-
cast the big games as well as movies and other programming. Waiters
bring drinks and popcorn.

Getting rubbed up at the spa
Trivia question: What’s more sybaritic than lying in your underwear in
a warm, dark room while a good-looking young man or woman rubs oil
over your whole body?
Answer: Nothing. Nothing that’s legal, anyway.
Cruise ship spas went from simple massage rooms in the early ’90s to
progressively more amazing New Age paradises as the years went on.
Today the best are perched on top decks, boast great views from eight or
ten treatment rooms, are decorated in soothing Asian and North African
motifs, and offer a menu of massages (including regular massage and the
popular hot-stone massage), facials, aqua-therapies, mud packs, and
other esoteric procedures that make you drool, plus beauty treatments
such as teeth whitening and the more standard manicure/pedicure.
Call it a monopoly if you will, but most cruise ship spas on most of the
cruise lines are run by one company: London-based Steiner Leisure.
There aren’t many exceptions. NCL, Oceania, and Silversea’s spas are
operated by a company called Mandara, but (what a surprise . . .)
they’re owned by Steiner, too. Companies bucking the Steiner monopoly
include Cunard (whose QM2 spa is run by Canyon Ranch) and Radisson
Seven Seas (whose spas are run by Carita), plus Star Clipper’s sailing
ship Royal Clipper, whose spa is run in-house.
In general, you won’t find too many bargains at onboard spas, whose
rates tend to be high. As for the quality of the treatments, they vary
depending on the talent of the person administering them. We’ve had
some amazing massages on board, as well as some blissfully esoteric
treatments: Matt’s round of aqua-therapy aboard Celebrity back in the
late ’90s still makes him tingle. On the other hand, that Ionithermie treat-
ment, which supposedly makes you lose inches as it’s happening, didn’t
do much for us except provide a lot of laughs afterward.
Here’s a sampling of treatments and their standard Steiner rates:
 25-minute Swedish massage: $60 to $72
 50-minute full-body massage: $89 to $128
 75-minute hot stone massage: $142 to $190
 50-minute facial: $89 to $109
 Manicure: $25 to $44
 Pedicure: $40 to $61
Frequently, passengers — especially women passengers — are subjected
to a sales pitch at the end of their treatment, suggesting various creams,
exfoliants, toners, moisturizers, and masks that help you look like
Christy Turlington when you get home. Buy if you want, but feel free to
say nope, no way, not interested. You’re in charge.
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 103

Rates for identical treatments can vary by as much as $20 from ship to
ship. Payment is charged to your onboard account, and usually doesn’t
include a tip for the therapist. Ask to make sure, though, before you
add one.
Make your spa appointments early, especially if you’re sailing on a mega-
ship. If you don’t head to the spa to sign up early, you risk being rele-
gated to a bad time slot — either very early in the morning, very late in
the evening, or (worst of all) during a port day when it would conflict
with your shore plans. On some ships, you can call from your stateroom
telephone to make an appointment. A few ships — Princess’s Caribbean
Princess and Sapphire Princess and Silversea’s Silver Cloud, Wind, Shadow,
and Whisper — have systems that let guests prebook their spa treatments
before they sail. Ditto for Cunard’s Queen Mary 2, though it’s only open to
guests in the top-class suites and previous Canyon Ranch customers. It’s
good to be king. Reportedly, Steiner Leisure is working on a prebooking
system that it will eventually use aboard all the ships on which it runs
spas, though it’s still in development.
Entertaining Yourself after Dark
Evenings are when cruise ships begin to take on the romantic aura of the
old ocean liners, as passengers dress up (even if they don’t do the tux-
and-gown thing as much as they used to), step out, and join the cham-
pagne slipstream. After dinner you can take in a show, listen to some
music, maybe hit the dance floor, or head for the casino. The main-
stream lines’ megaships have a multitude of options; small luxe ships,
such as those of Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea, have fewer, but that
goes along with their quieter, more refined vibe. The quality of entertain-
ment, of course, varies from line to line and from ship to ship.
Taking in a show
Big-ship cruising means high-tech shows that feature dazzling laser-
lighting effects, pyrotechnics, video backdrops, actors “flying” in and
out, and large casts of singers and dancers performing everything from
Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber medleys to Elvis tunes
and even, occasionally, something written in the past ten years. Cruise
lines spend millions of dollars on each extravagant production, though
whether you get jazzed by it or not really depends on your taste. If you
don’t dig brassy arrangements, constant motion, nubile young Vegas-
style dancers smiling and lip-synching away, and flashy solo singers
bouncing between high notes, you probably won’t like these either.
Occasionally, of course, something amazing pops up. Disney, for exam-
ple, offers absolutely the best shows at sea, with characters and stories
based on its parent company’s classic films. Recent shows on NCL are
also standouts, with strong soloists and really original staging, choreo-
graphy, and choice of material. Carnival and Royal Caribbean are also
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
104

reliably strong; the latter’s Voyager-class ships have a niche show all
their own: full-on ice shows in their skating rinks, with choreography
and special effects similar to those in the main theaters. Royal
Caribbean’s sister-line, Celebrity Cruises, offers shows and other enter-
tainment created by fantasy circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. Cunard takes
a different tack aboard QM2, programming performances by graduates
of Britain’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, as well as some more stan-
dard song-and-dance revues.
Most ships offer productions twice a night to correspond with tradi-
tional first and second seating dinner times; usually you see the show
after dinner, but, on some nights, you may have the option of checking
it out before. On lines that have deformalized the dining experience
(notably Princess and Norwegian), shows may be scheduled only once
a night and repeated later in the week.
Hitting the vaudeville circuit
On some nights, ships may offer various variety acts instead of (or in
addition to) the big production revues. What to expect? Think magic
shows complete with the old saw-the-assistant-in-half routine; acrobatic
acts and aerialists who fly around on ropes strung from the theater’s
ceiling (always a big hit); jugglers; ventriloquists; and, most commonly
of all, comedians, many of whom work on cruise ships regularly, meeting
the vessels in various ports and then getting off in others to catch up
with their next floating gig. Comedy acts may perform either in the main
theater or in a second performance space, sometimes doing PG- and 
R-rated material at an early show and then running the X up the mast
at an adults-only midnight performance. Expect the best humor on the
mainstream ships. Carnival has been known for its comedians for years,
and Norwegian Cruise Line recently announced a partnership with the
famed Second City improv comedy group, who do shows weekly on the
line’s Norwegian Dawn, sailing out of New York.
Ritzier lines, such as Crystal and Cunard, and premium mainstream
lines, such as Holland America and Celebrity, often feature classical
pianists or violinists, though they tend to stick to familiar, ear-catching
pieces. Lines with a European character, such as Costa and MSC, tend
to program light-classical performances as well, typically sticking to
pianists or operatic soloists. The small adventure-oriented ships typi-
cally have little or no formal entertainment on board, though some bring
aboard local musicians and/or dancers in various ports — a practice also
followed by some of the mainstream and luxe lines on some itineraries. In
Hawaii, for example, NCL does a once-a-week show of Polynesian music
and dance.
Occasionally, ships carry some well-known singers and other perform-
ers, such as Maureen McGovern, Joel Grey, and Lorna Luft. You may also
see some excellent performers who may not be household names or a
singer who was famous back in the day crooning oldies but goodies. On
Chapter 8: Onboard Activities and Entertainment 105

a Seabourn cruise, we found Phillip Huber — he created and manipu-
lated the puppets for the hit cult film Being John Malkovich — and his
Huber Marionettes.
Lounging around
As ships have gotten bigger, music venues have multiplied. On the
biggest Royal Caribbean and Carnival ships, you may find eight or nine
choices at night, from background guitar to karaoke, from sing-a-long
piano bars to classical chamber groups. Lounge entertainment varies
not only from ship to ship, but also from room to room on the same
ship, providing enough variety to please most passengers. You’ll likely
find at least one band playing dance tunes, a soloist or duo playing back-
ground music in the atrium, an upbeat electric band playing by the pool,
and often a pianist taking requests at a piano bar. Holland America
always has an afternoon high tea featuring a string trio or quartet, while
Royal Caribbean has a Latin-themed bar on several of their ships, with
Latin-tinged music. Ditto for NCL’s Norwegian Dawn, which has had an
excellent small salsa band aboard every time we’ve sailed.
Channeling your inner diva
If you fantasize about being the next Sinatra, Streisand, J-Lo, or Seinfeld,
your ship has come in: Virtually all large ships have passenger talent
shows, with a sign-up early in the cruise and a final performance in the
main theater or a smaller lounge later in the week. Remember to pack
your sheet music (although the ship’s accompanist may be able to wing
it), and if you want to do a stand-up comedy act, mind your audience: If
you’ve got a G-rated audience, save the X-rated jokes for the hot tub
later on.
On a smaller scale, most large ships offer karaoke several times during
the trip. For the uninitiated, karaoke involves people taking turns singing
to recorded backing tracks of popular songs (from oldies to new pop
hits), as lyrics scroll across a monitor. You choose the song from a book
and the emcee calls you up when it’s your turn. Everyone gets into the
spirit at these sessions, and no one — regardless of talent level —
should be embarrassed or fear getting the hook.
Carnival recently introduced a new show on some of its vessels that
merges the talent-show and karaoke concepts. Dubbed “Carnival
Legends,” it goes a little something like this: Guests — any guests,
whether they can really sing or not — sign up for the show, pick an alter-
ego (Elvis, James Brown, Madonna, Gloria Estefan, Britney Spears, or
one of several others), then rehearse their number with the ship’s band
and show dancers. Then it’s lights, camera, action, and they’re perform-
ing in full costume in the main lounge, with sets, lighting effects, and a
full audience to complete the picture. The show debuted aboard the
line’s Imagination and has proved so popular that other Carnival ships
will be introducing it soon. Start rehearsing now.

Keeping the Faith
Amid all the activities and entertainment, some ships also manage to
find a place for religious services.
Depending on the ship and the presence of clergy on board, most lines
offer a Sunday nondenominational service, and some lines (including
Costa and Cunard) offer Catholic mass regularly. On Christian and
Jewish holidays, large ships may bring clergy aboard to lead services.
Some ships have chapels, and Cunard’s QE2 has a synagogue as well. For
regular Friday-night Jewish Sabbath services, many ships provide prayer
books, yarmulkes, challah, and wine, but the passengers conduct the
service themselves, with one passenger agreeing to be the leader.

W
hile we may have never gotten further than a Holiday Inn at
the beach, kids these days sure do get around. Cruises to the
Caribbean, Alaska, and Europe have become classic must-do family
vacations. Hundreds and hundreds of kids and teens — sometimes more
than a thousand — cruise the decks on a typical big-ship cruise these
days. In fact, about 1 million of the nearly 9 million North Americans
who took a cruise in 2004 were passengers under the age of 17. If you’ve
got kids of your own, this is great news (just ask Heidi, who schlepped
her toddler twin boys on a dozen cruises before their third birthday). If
you don’t plan on traveling with kids, well, sure hope you like the little
buggers (otherwise, you may want to consider a small ship instead,
where there tend to be far fewer tots in tow).
That said, because most kids on a cruise are happy as clams in the chil-
dren’s areas, you won’t see them running around the rest of the ship as
much as you may expect. This is a good thing. Read on for the lowdown
on what ships are offering for families these days.
Kids Are People, Too — And They Cruise
For years now, cruise lines have catered to families, and the amenities
get better with each new ship launched. Playrooms are larger and activi-
ties are more varied, with science and art projects supplementing the
standard pizza parties and scavenger hunts. Cruise lines are smart. They

know that kids cruising today will be the adult cruisers of tomorrow, and
they want to get them hooked early.
Just how many families are cruising with their kids these days? Are you
sitting down? Try 1,000 to 1,200 kids and teens on the biggest ships, espe-
cially during summer vacation and holiday times. A Royal Caribbean
executive told us that as many as 1,500 to 1,800 kids and teens will be
typical on the jumbo-sized Freedom of the Seas when the ship debuts in
spring of 2006. Holy moley!
The newer ships of the mass-market lines, including Disney (surprise,
surprise), Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Norwegian, and Princess, go all out
with facilities for kids of all ages. Holland America and Celebrity offer
decent facilities, too. All have playrooms; the best are stocked with good-
ies such as ball bins and climbing mazes, plus lots of games, toys, and
computers. Teen centers are typical, with many designed to look as styl-
ish as adult lounges. Geez, when we were kids, we used to get excited by
a vending machine and a swimming pool. Anyway, that was then, this is
now. You can also find video arcades, kids-only splash pools, and lots of
kid-friendly snack areas serving tasty junk food such as ice cream, pizza,
burgers, and chicken fingers. Kids’ menus are pretty standard in the main
dining rooms as well, as are high chairs.
Even some of the ultraluxe lines such as Cunard and Crystal do their bit
to cater to families. Both lines have playrooms on their ships along with
supervised activities whenever demand warrants it.
Children’s activities are included in the cruise fare, though you pay for
extras like late-night babysitting (usually offered after 10 p.m.) and shore
excursions.
Though so many are, not all ships are kid-friendly. Many times older
ships (say, from the early ’90s), have small, outdated playrooms. Some
ships, usually the smaller adventure and luxury vessels, don’t have any
children’s playrooms or activities, and in a few cases, disallow kids out-
right. For example, American Canadian Caribbean Line doesn’t permit
children under 14. And for luxury lines such as Silversea and Seabourn
that technically allow kids, they certainly don’t cater to them, and they
expect, as do the other passengers, that children who come on board be
seen and not heard.
You find the most kids on ships in the Caribbean, but other regions are
gaining ground, too. In Alaska, the glaciers, Native culture, and wildlife
are interesting and educational for kids. Europe, too, is becoming more
popular with family cruisers. Aside from the port experience, kids on a
European cruise are often mingling with kids in the playroom who speak
English only as a second language, if at all, so your kids may actually
learn something about other cultures. (Explain this to your children in
advance so that they don’t think the other kids are unfriendly.) On all
itineraries, it’s more and more common to see multiple generations 
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 109

traveling together: children, parents, and grandparents. An added bonus
of course is that grampy and grammy are built-in babysitters!
It’s Kids’ Stuff
Cruise lines set up their programs by age, similar to a summer camp, so
that children can be involved in age-appropriate activities with their
peers. The programs start with children ages two or three (with the
exception of Disney and Cunard, you yourself are the program for a child
younger than two) and often require that toddlers are potty-trained.
Keep in mind, some cruise lines require that their youth counselors have
degrees in education or phys ed. Other lines don’t have such high stan-
dards, though don’t worry, a dishwasher from the galley won’t be watch-
ing over your little tykes either. As far as figuring out the ratio of youth
staff to kids, most don’t have one. Typically, a cruise line looks at the
passenger manifest weeks before a cruise and can assess how many
counselors to have given the number of kids on board.
There’s no way a cruise line can guess how many of the kids on board
actually come to the playrooms and participate in the activities. (Heidi’s
boys have been the only ones in the playroom, with a counselor all to
themselves, and they’ve also been two of maybe 40 or 50 kids in their
age group, being supervised by four or five counselors.) Most lines have
a “no turn away” policy and accepts all kids who want to participate.
During busy periods, like summertime and holiday weeks, this policy
means that playrooms during supervised activity times can be crowded.
To ease the congestion, smaller groups break off to take walks around
the ship or to do activities like drawing or painting elsewhere, such as at
a quiet, unused part of the Promenade Deck.
The roster of kids’ activities varies from line to line, but the pickins
are better than ever. Here’s a sampling of what to expect from the big
cruise lines:
 Try your hand at cool science experiments with magnets and bub-
bles, or make a volcano (Royal Caribbean).
 Whip up ice-cream sundaes.
 Discover stuff about animation (Disney) and ocean and marine life
(Princess).
 Do some water coloring (Carnival).
 Have your face painted.
 Play computer games ala PlayStation 2 and Xboxes.
 Surf the Net (teens only).
 Go on a backstage tour of the theater or get a peek at the galley.
 Design your own T-shirt.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
110

 Take dance lessons.
 Show off your acting skills in a talent show.
 Include parents in special family activities such as pizza making.
Supervised activities may not be offered between about 5 and 7 p.m.
each day, so counselors can take a break and grab dinner. They usually
resume again between about 7 and 10 p.m. (after this, the babysitting
program kicks in and parents are charged an hourly rate). The excep-
tions to this schedule include pizza parties and special dinners the coun-
selors host once or twice per cruise, typically around 6 p.m. Afterwards,
the children are escorted back to the playroom for most activities. Most
parents are psyched for the break (though Heidi actually enjoys picking
mac and cheese out of her hair) and the chance to get an early start on
their evenings out.
Caribbean and Bahamas sailings of the mainstream cruise lines typically
include visits to these lines’ private beaches in the Bahamas, where
watersports, barbeque lunches, and music are among the offerings for
passengers. Most private beaches also have kids’ areas of some kind,
sometimes with a playground or water park, and supervised activities.
The best for families are Disney’s Castaway Cay, Holland America’s Half
Moon Cay, Royal Caribbean’s CocoCay, and Princess’ Princess Cays. We
offer more details on these private beaches in Chapter 15.
Family Friendly? (Or Get Us off This Thing!)
As we’ve just been explaining (we hope you were paying attention),
many cruises are great family vacations. But not all ships offer the same
facilities and programs. Age minimums can vary. So can the hours of
operation. The babysitting set-up and the scope of play areas and activi-
ties can also differ. So read on for the nitty gritty and don’t be shy about
grilling your travel agent for details, too. Most cruise line Web sites also
list their programming details.
Checking out program availability and hours
Some ships offer children’s programs only seasonally — during the
summer and holiday periods when most families travel. Other programs
run year-round, namely those of the big-ship lines. Find out if the ship
offers the advertised program during the time you plan to sail.
Some ships operate programs for a specific age category only if a mini-
mum number of kids of that age are on board; this number varies, but is
likely about 10 or 20. Find out if your cruise has such restrictions to
avoid a tantrum (yours) once on board.
Most programs shut down during meal times, and they may not be
offered during port calls. So if you want to take a shore excursion, you
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 111

may have to bring the kids along, which can get expensive because most
lines don’t offer substantially cheaper rates for kids’ excursions.
Keeping it real for teens
Even if your teens have vowed to mope in the cabin, dressed in black,
to protest the weeklong separation from their significant others back
home, they may eventually break down and want to meet the other
teens. All the big-ship lines have attractive teen centers where your pre-
cious ones can hang out, pose, and make snide remarks about each
other. Activities such as dances, parties, and karaoke are typically on
the agenda, and give teens the green light to chill with peers and avoid
parents — a bonus for all concerned.
So that your lovely adolescent offspring can stay in touch with pals back
home, just about every ship that carries more than 100 or so passengers
offers Internet access. The big megaships have an Internet center with at
least 15 computers, and often twice that number, that operates around
the clock, or nearly so. In some cases, teen centers have a private com-
puter nook with Internet access.
Keeping the kids close, if not in close quarters
Obviously bigger is better. If you can afford it, opt for a suite or two con-
necting cabins (most ships have some) to avoid getting in each other’s
hair. Family togetherness is all well and good, but after seven days in a
space no bigger than your kitchen, you don’t want to have to vote some-
one out of the cabin. Many ships now offer a handful of family suites, in
addition to a selection of minisuites and regular suites that offer more
space for families (but are also more expensive than standard cabins).
But if you’re all social butterflies flitting from one activity to another, you
may only use the cabin to sleep. If that’s the case, you can survive with
four in a standard cabin (and save some dough to boot). At the very
least, though, consider a cabin with a balcony; the extra living space can
go a long way.
If you need a crib, request one when booking your cruise, they’re com-
plimentary. Many cabins, but not all, have minifridges and some have
bathtubs, and just about all ships have 24-hour room service for order-
ing cartons of milk, sandwiches, and snacks.
Knowing who’s watching your kids
Most children’s programs are designed so that kids — depending on
their ages — can come and go. Planned activities are certainly less
restrictive than day-care facilities at home. Many programs require that
kids under a certain age (usually somewhere between 9 and 13) must be
signed in and out of the activity area or playroom by a parent, though
policies on this may vary. If you grant your older kids wandering privi-
leges, emphasize that the casino is off limits (officially, at least). Find
out, too, if the ship requests that unsupervised children not visit the
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
112

spa, gym, disco, or other adult-oriented areas; typically these areas do
not allow children under 16 or 18 to enter. You may want to consider
investing in hand-held walkie-talkies so that you and the kids can keep
tabs on each other (though they’re incredibly annoying to everyone else
around you).
Most of the big-ship lines give parents of young children (say under
about 8 years old) the use of pagers, so they can be summoned if the
child needs them (and sometimes to alert you that you need to come
up to the playroom and change a dirty diaper).
Even on ships with extensive children’s programs, you’re still responsi-
ble for your children’s safety at the pool. There are rarely lifeguards, so
for safety reasons, most programs don’t take kids to the swimming pool.
All cruise ships carrying more than a few hundred passengers have a
doctor on board, and often several nurses. Though you can visit them in
the infirmary on board if need be (there is a fee), it’s best to also bring
any special medications your children may need. It’s also smart to pack
a simple first-aid kit, complete with a thermometer and basic medicines,
so you don’t have to bother seeing the doctor for minor ailments. Also,
you may want to check your insurance to find out whether it covers you
in the unlikely event that someone needs to be transported ashore (as in
the case of appendicitis). Definitely take the time to tell your kids how
important it is to wash their hands frequently; it’s the best prevention
against gastrointestinal problems and other diseases.
Babysitting on board
Want to get through your formal dinner without cutting up anyone’s
food? A few lines offer private babysitting in your cabin between the
hours of about 8 p.m. and 1 a.m., by an off-duty female crewmember
(usually a cabin stewardess). Rates are generally about $10 an hour for
two children, and there’s usually a two-hour minimum. More common is
group babysitting in the playroom, which runs about $8 to $10 an hour
for two kids. Check with your travel agent ahead of time to make sure
your cruise line’s policies haven’t changed.
The private babysitting is offered based on availability, which means
don’t dawdle. Heidi always heads to the reception desk within a few
hours of boarding to make her requests. Also, with group babysitting,
some ships may impose a cap on the numbers allowed into it, so inquire
within a few hours of boarding if this is important to you.
Following the Rules
Okay, so a ship is only so big. It’s a confined environment, so kids can
get themselves into only so much trouble. Nevertheless, you still need
to drill your kids on basic safety procedures before setting sail. The
number-one rule: Don’t lean on the railings of open decks or verandas.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 113

Although most railings are high enough to not be of major concern
for nonclimbing little kids, make a strict rule about it to be on the safe
side — particularly if you have active kids.
Another important rule is to make sure that your children don’t go to the
pool without telling you, because most ships don’t have lifeguards. Pools
with waterslides often have staff members regulating the flow of traffic,
but they don’t get paid to watch for little ones swimming unsupervised.
Make sure your children take the onboard safety drill seriously and that
they understand the safety information you and the ship provide. (Check
out Chapter 6 for more safety drill info.) Also, check that your cabin has
appropriately sized life jackets.
As on any vacation, have your children memorize the home base 
information — the ship’s name and their cabin and deck numbers —
in case you get separated during the voyage.
Taking Notes: The Best Family Cruises
The top lines for family travelers offer not only great supervised pro-
grams for kids, but also special play areas and facilities. All the major
big-ship lines are family friendly to a large degree, and offer free super-
vised activities daily, babysitting service evenings at an hourly rate, and
children’s menus (à la hot dogs, burgers, and pasta) in some or all of
their restaurants. Starting with the best, we’ve listed the top lines for
families. (Check out Part IV for more info on these lines.)
Disney Cruise Line
The undisputed big cheese of family fun, both the Disney Magic and
Disney Wonder take top billing for their kids’ facilities and family-friendly
ships (cabins are large and feature split bathrooms). An incredible
15,000 square feet is dedicated to children’s areas (nearly half a deck),
more than twice that of the largest spaces on the Royal Caribbean or
Carnival fleets). Beloved Disney films are shown and the line’s live enter-
tainment is exceedingly family friendly and incorporates Disney charac-
ters into fun musicals on high-tech stages.
At least 50 counselors supervise the fun — far more than any other line,
and thus counselor-to-kid ratios are better.
Some 1,000 kids or so per cruise is par for the course. Activities for five
age groups between 3 and 17 are offered nearly nonstop from 9 a.m. to
midnight daily in two huge play spaces, a teen center, and a nursery. All
play areas are open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by a parent.
 The Oceaneer Club (ages 3–7, with separate activities for ages
3–4 and 5–7), is a kid-proportioned playroom with a Captain Hook
theme. Kids can climb and crawl on the bridge, ropes, and rails of
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
114

a giant pirate ship, as well as on jumbo-size animals, barrels, and a
sliding board; get dressed up from a trunk full of costumes; dance
with Snow White and listen to stories by other Disney characters;
or play in the kiddie computer room.
 The interactive Oceaneer Lab across the hall offers kids (ages 8–12,
divided into ages 8–9 and 10–12) a chance to work on computers,
learn fun science with microscopes, build from an enormous vat of
Legos, do arts and crafts, hear how animation works, and create
their own radio show.
To keep things fresh, new activities are being introduced all the
time — some 24 in 2004, for example — for the 3 to 12 set.
 For teens (ages 13–17), a new teen hangout, called The Stack on the
Magic and Aloft on the Wonder, is three times the size of the old
digs and more isolated from parents. The centers have two sepa-
rate rooms, one with video screens for movies and the other a
disco with a teens-only Internet center. Dance parties, karaoke,
trivia games, improv comedy lessons, and workshops on photogra-
phy are offered for teens on all cruises, with even more options on
7-night sailings.
 Though not complimentary like the programming for older kids, for
an hourly rate you can drop off your littlest ones, ages 3 months to
3 years, at the Flounder’s Reef Nursery. Hours are 6 p.m. to midnight
daily, and a few hours during the morning and afternoon. No other
line offers such extensive care for babies. The room has toys and
games, plus eight cribs and a one-way porthole that allows parents
to check on their kids without the little ones seeing them. The price
is $6 per child per hour, and $5 for each additional child in a family
(with a two-hour minimum). Space is limited here, so reserve your
spots as early as possible. The child-to-counselor ratio is four to one,
and counselors do change diapers (though you must supply them).
Each ship has a video arcade, though it’s really cramped compared to
most. Kids can eat lunch and dinner with counselors in the Topsider and
Beach Blanket buffet restaurants all but the first evening of the cruise.
Disney doesn’t offer private in-cabin babysitting like some lines do during
evening hours (so parents can dine alone), but along with Cunard they
are the only line offering complimentary activities and group care until
midnight (or later) in the Oceaneer Club and Lab for ages 3 to 12. Other
lines charge for this after 10 p.m.
When the ship calls on Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island in the
Bahamas, kids can head for Scuttle’s Cove, where there are barrels to
crawl through, a giant whale-dig site to explore, and more. Kids’ coun-
selors are on hand to supervise the fun if the parents want to head to
Serenity Bay, the adults-only beach. For families who want to play
together, there are bike rentals and lots more.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 115

Royal Caribbean International
Exceedingly well rounded for families, the Royal Caribbean fleet offers
big spacious playrooms, teen rooms, plus lots of cool diversions for all
ages, such as the rock-climbing walls offered on all ships. There’s even
more on the line’s newest Freedom-, Voyager- and Radiance-class ships,
including miniature golf. The innovative line was the first to introduce
parent and infant/toddler playgroups, a great thing until your tots are 
3 and old enough to join the ship’s drop-off programming. With its new
Freedom of the Seas, the line really went overboard for kids offering truly
the best outdoor pool space at sea in the form of a giant water park with
cannons, sprays, and jets set against a backdrop of colorful cartoony
characters. The line also revamped an older ship, Enchantment of the
Seas, and it now boasts four bungee trampolines, two suspension
bridges, and a splash pool with water jets.
Though all of Royal Caribbean’s ships are well equipped, the Freedom
takes top billing for its water park, and the Radiance-class ships and
Voyager, Adventure, and Explorer get big points for their water slides and
kids’ pools. The Navigator and Mariner have some 6,000 square feet more
than the other ships in the Voyager class, and Navigator is also popular
for its Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream parlor. Other cool stuff in the fleet includes
an ice-skating rink and in-line skating track on all the Voyager-class ships,
plus a mini science museum on the Explorer. Kids can visit the small labs
staffed by scientists from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration, the University of Miami, and elsewhere.
Year-round and fleetwide, Royal Caribbean offers its Adventure Ocean
supervised kids’ programs for five age groups between 3 and 17. While at
sea, the programs run from 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.;
while in port, drop-off starts 30 minutes before the first shore excursion is
scheduled until 5 p.m., and then 7 to 10 p.m. Aside from the more typical
stuff to do, the line’s Adventure Science activities invite kids to have fun
and actually learn something by doing simple science experiments appro-
priate to their age group. Same deal with Adventure Art, which is all about
playing with crayons, modeling clay, glitter, glue, markers, and paint.
For participating in events, kids earn Adventure Ocean Coupons, which
they can trade in for gifts.
Following are some more activities available for specific age groups:
 Aquanauts (ages 3–5), do hands-on science experiments with water,
magnets, and gummy candies. Art projects include mask-making
(themed to the cruise itinerary) and pottery. Other things to do
include ice-cream parties, face painting, talent shows, and playing
with superheroes. The line’s new Sail into Story Time program uses
popular children’s books such as Where the Wild Things Are and
The Very Hungry Caterpillar as a basis for fun hands-on activities
and arts and crafts. For example, after reading Where the Wild
Things Are, they’re turned loose for a supervised “wild rumpus.”
Hey, better here than at home. . . .
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
116

 Explorers (ages 6–8), do some of the same stuff Aquanauts do, but
also scavenger hunts, dance parties, and bingo. The Story Time
program with this age group uses The Stinky Cheese Man and Do
Pirates Take Baths? as a theme for activities and arts and crafts.
 Voyagers (ages 9–11), do science and art programs geared to their
age group, plus stuff such as reggae beach parties, backstage the-
ater tours, sports tournaments, and more.
 Navigators (ages 12–14), do cool things such as learn how to be a
DJ, sports contests (sometimes pitting boys against girls . . . oohhh,
how romantic!!), karaoke, toga and pool parties, and video game
competitions.
 For older teens (ages 15–17), each ship has a teen disco and a
video arcade. Some of the ships, including the Mariner, Navigator,
Monarch, and Sovereign of the Seas have three new teen-only areas,
including a nightclub, TV room, and dedicated teen sun deck. There
are also separate teen Internet centers reserved for ages 12 to 17
and huge video arcades.
 Babies and toddlers get their due, too. RCI recently partnered with
Fisher-Price to offer supervised “play dates” for babies and tod-
dlers (6 months to 3 years) along with their parents. The 45-minute
play sessions for two age groups (Aqua Babies, 6–18 months, and
Aqua Tots, 18 months to 3 years) are offered on all but embarkation
day, and incorporate music, storytelling, and a variety of Fisher-
Price toys.
Royal Caribbean offers two babysitting options: slumber party–style
group babysitting for children 3 to 12 in the playroom nightly between
10 p.m. and 1 a.m., and from noon until sailing on days the ship is in
port ($5 per hour per child); and private, in-cabin babysitting for kids
12 months and up, which is available from off-duty crewmembers 8 a.m.
to 2 a.m., and should be booked at least 24 hours in advance through the
purser’s desk ($8 per hour for up to two siblings).
Among the best trained in the biz, male and female youth staff all have
four-year college degrees in education, recreation, or a related field, plus
they’re trained in CPR and first aid.
Dinner with the youth counselors is offered on three nights of a 7-night
cruise (and once or twice on shorter cruises) in the Windjammer buffet
restaurant, Solarium cafe, or Johnny Rockets diner (depending on the
ship). Dinner runs from 6 to 7 p.m.
Royal Caribbean’s newest ships — Voyager, Explorer, Adventure, Mariner,
Navigator, Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, Jewel, and Freedom — have
special family cabins that can accommodate six. Cabins on the older
vessels tend to be pretty small, although some can hold a third or fourth
passenger in upper berths.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 117

Royal Caribbean’s drinking age fleetwide is 18 years old for wine and
beer when the ship sails in international waters, but parents have to sign
a waiver stating their awareness of this rule. If parents don’t sign, the
age is 21.
Carnival Cruise Lines
Those wild, frat boy (and girl) singles who used to define Carnival as the
party-hardy fun-ship line seem to have settled down, gotten married, and
had kids. Who would have guessed that Carnival would morph into a
family cruise line? And one of the best ones. The latest offerings include
spa treatments tailored to teens, and art, science, and exercise-oriented
activities geared to young children.
But don’t get us wrong, Carnival is still a fun line for adults, too. It’s just
that the line’s extensive kids’ facilities and programming give parents
plenty of opportunity to break away and party by the pool with a bucket
of beers.
The line estimates that about 500,000 kids will have sailed aboard its
ships in 2005, which they claim is a whopping 400 percent more children
under 18 than in 1995. Some 800 children per cruise is pretty normal,
with as many as 1,000 on Christmas and New Year’s cruises. Lots of kid-
dies are around in summer, too, when it’s difficult to find a kid-free hot
tub. The Conquest-class ships (Conquest, Glory, Valor, and Liberty), the
largest and newest in the fleet, offer the best kids’ digs, occupying some
6,000 square feet. The playroom has an arts-and-crafts station, video wall,
computer lab, PlayStation 2 game units, and toys from play kitchens to
mini sliding boards, farm sets, and more. The separate and sprawling teen
center has a video wall and soda bar flowing into a huge video arcade with
three air hockey tables and more than 20 machines.
The playroom and video arcade on the Spirit-class ships (Carnival Miracle,
Spirit, Legend, and Pride) are tucked away in the far forward reaches of the
bow on decks 4 and 5. Playrooms are divided into three sections con-
nected via tunnels and offer sand art, a candy-making machine, a com-
puter lab with a handful of iMacs and PlayStation 2s, and plenty of other
diversions.
The Destiny-class vessels (Destiny, Triumph, and Victory) have two-level
indoor/outdoor playrooms. The Fantasy-class ships (Ecstasy, Fantasy,
Fascination, Imagination, Inspiration, and Sensation) have two playrooms,
though they’re boxy and cramped compared to the line’s newer Fantasy-
class ships (Elation and Paradise).
The Camp Carnival program offers supervised kids’ activities on sea
days just about straight through from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. (and 2–10 p.m.
on port days) for ages 2 through 14 in four age groups. All of the 10 to
16 counselors are trained in CPR and first aid, and they organize the fun
and games on each ship.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
118

 Toddlers (ages 2–5) can get into face painting, computer games,
puzzles, fun with clay, picture bingo, pirate hat–making, and pizza
parties.
 For juniors (ages 6–8), there’s PlayStation 2, computer games, ice-
cream parties, story time and library visits, T-shirt coloring, and
swimming. Young kids will also enjoy cavorting with Carnival’s “Fun
Ship” Freddy, a big fuzzy red, white, and blue mascot who shows up
to say hello and pose for photos.
 For intermediates (ages 9–11), there are scavenger hunts, trivia and
bingo, Ping-Pong, video-game competitions, arts and crafts, com-
puter games, dance classes, and talent shows.
 Teen clubs are geared to 12 to 14 year olds (the cruise director’s
department schedules activities for the 16–18 set), and are quite
elaborate on the newest ships. Besides karaoke parties, computer
games, scavenger hunts, talent shows, card and trivia games, and
Ping-Pong, teens can watch movies there and go to dance parties.
Most ships are also equipped with iMacs, but there is no Internet
center for teens only like some ships offer.
“Homework help” sessions are available for kids who need to keep up
while on vacation. The line also has new educational activities for the
various age groups that include art projects with papier-mâché, oil
paintings, and watercolors; music appreciation, which gets kids
acquainted with different musical instruments; science projects where
kids can make their own ice cream and create mini helicopters; and a fit-
ness program that encourages today’s couch-potato computer-head kids
to actually get up and run around.
The entire fleet has video arcades (the newest ships have virtual-reality
games and air-hockey tables), children’s wading pools, and for bigger
kids there’s that great corkscrew slide at the main pool of each ship.
Other pluses include a supervised kids’ mealtime in the buffet restau-
rant between about 6 and 7 p.m. nightly except the first evening and
sometimes last evening(s) of the cruise. A turndown service for kids
includes complimentary chocolate-chip cookies on their pillows at bed-
time on formal nights.
When parents want to party (or at least take an adults-only break), free
supervised children’s activities are offered from 7 to 10 p.m. nightly. After
that, group slumber party–style babysitting kicks in for ages 4 months
through 11 years till 3 a.m. in the playroom (most lines only allow kids
ages 2 or 3 plus into the group babysitting). No private babysitting is
available. There’s also group babysitting between 8 a.m. and noon on
port days for the under-2 set, for $6 per hour for the first child, $4 per
hour for each additional child. On sea days between noon and 2 p.m., you
can also drop off children under two at the rate above, or parents may
use the playroom with their babies for these two hours at no charge.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 119

A handful of strollers are available for rent fleetwide for $25 for 7- and 
8-night cruises (less for shorter cruises) as well as a limited number of
bouncy seats, travel swings, and Game Boys. If you need to rely on a
stroller, bring your own, because there’s no guarantee you can get a
rental.
Norwegian Cruise Line
With each new ship the line introduces, the kids’ digs get better. Though
every ship in the fleet has at least a playroom, the facilities on the newer
ships Dawn, Star, Jewel, Spirit, Sun, and Pride of America are the winners
hands down. They boast huge spaces that include a separate teen center
and a wading pool, as well as a large, well-stocked playroom with areas
for movie-watching, arts and crafts, and computers. The Dawn, Star, and
Jewel have wonderful spaces with a huge climbing maze and ball bin
combo indoors and a private kids’ pool and hot tub area outside with a
fun, wacky theme.
On sea days, the playrooms are open 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 4:30 or 5 p.m.,
and 7 to 10 p.m.; on port days the hours are 7 to 10 p.m. Once per 7-
night cruise, kids can dine with counselors between 6 and 7 p.m., and
then go directly to the playroom.
The line’s Kids Crew program offers year-round supervised activities for
children ages 2 to 17, divided into four age groups.
 Junior Sailors (ages 2–5) can enjoy arts and crafts, face painting,
story time, LEGOs, pizza making, treasure hunts, and movies.
 First Mates (ages 6–9) do the things above plus scavenger hunts,
painting, sports, and storytelling.
 Navigators (ages 10–12) also enjoy board games, the video arcade,
sports, and parties.
 Teens (ages 13–17) do what this age group does best: hang out. The
newer ships have a teen disco, plus there are movies, parties, card
games, sports, and PlayStation 2s.
For kids 5 to 17 with a penchant for performing, the line’s Junior Star
Seeker passenger talent competition is a big hit. Those who want to par-
ticipate are given three minutes to perform before a panel of judges, and
the ship awards the winners a free NCL cruise.
When the free activities wind down at 10 p.m., group babysitting kicks in
for kids aged 2 to 12 nightly until 1 a.m. (and also 9 a.m.–5 p.m. on port
days) for $5 per child per hour, plus $3 an hour for each additional child.
You must sign up for babysitting in advance (the day before ideally).
Counselors do not do diapers; parents are given beepers so that they
can be alerted when it’s time for the dirty work. Private babysitting is
not available.
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
120

The fleet’s Wind, Dream, Majesty, Sky, and Sun each have a Kids Korner
playroom, and the Pride of Aloha and Sun also have kiddie pools and
teen centers.
The Star, Dawn, Sun, Jewel, and Pride of Hawaii have a separate section
for kids in their buffet restaurants, complete with adorable mini chairs,
tables, and buffet line (Heidi’s boys loved this area on the Dawn!).
Princess Cruises
It really shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Love Boat line, born of
flirty doctors and poolside trysts, would eventually produce some great
family ships. Though Princess isn’t the first line that comes to mind
when you think family cruising, it’s for no lack of really good facilities.
The line’s newest ships — the Grand-, Diamond-, and Coral-class ships —
have impressive facilities. Each has a spacious indoor/outdoor children’s
playroom with a splash pool, an arts-and-crafts corner, game tables, and
computers or game consoles, plus a teen center with computers, a dance
floor, and a music system. These also have totally huge virtual-reality
centers (that many adults also can’t resist). The two-story playrooms on
Golden and Grand have a large fenced-in outside deck dedicated to kids
only, including a teen section with a hot tub and private sunbathing area.
The new Caribbean Princess, as well as the rest of the Grand- and Coral-
class ships and Sun and Dawn, have a great fenced-in outdoor playspace
for toddlers, complete with a fleet of three-wheelers. And the new Coral,
Island, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess have a small swimming pool for
adults adjacent to the outdoor kids’ deck, so parents can relax (sort of)
while supervising their kiddies next door.
Parents can rent walkie-talkies through the purser’s desk if they want
two-way communication with their kids.
Princess’s program offers activities supervised by a staff of counselors
year-round for three age groups. On sea days, the free activities are
offered from 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.; on port days
the hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (including lunch) and 7 to 10 p.m.
 Princess Pelicans (ages 3–7) and Princess Pirateers (ages 8–12) get
their own areas of the playroom, and have stuff such as arts and
crafts, scavenger hunts, game tournaments, movies and videos, 
coloring contests, scavenger hunts, pizza and ice-cream parties,
karaoke, dancing, tours of the galley or behind the scenes at the 
theater, and hula parties complete with grass skirts.
All play areas are open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by a
parent.
 Teens (ages 13–17) can act cool while they get into shipboard
Olympics, T-shirt painting, karaoke, Ping-Pong and basketball tour-
naments, Nintendo, and teenage versions of The Dating Game.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 121

The line’s three older, smaller ships — the Regal, Tahitian, and Pacific —
don’t have extensive kids’ facilities, and their activities programs are
available only when 20 or more children ages 3 to 17 are on board.
On some cruises, kids and teens can actually learn more than how to
lip synch to Britney Spears songs. Designed in conjunction with the
California Science Center, kids can do hands-on activities on Mexican
Riviera sailings, from stargazing to studying ocean and coral reef habi-
tats, building and racing sailboats, launching rockets, and dissecting
gooey squid. Budding naturalists can take a gander at the activity books
and other learning materials provided by the National Wildlife Federation.
These opportunities were designed to complement the line’s Junior
Ranger program in Alaska and the Save our Seas environmental program,
which operates fleet-wide. Children who participate get a Pete’s Pal
stuffed animal to take home.
Twice per cruise, kids can dine with counselors, so parents get a break.
Younger kids can then be taken straight to group babysitting in the chil-
dren’s center (available nightly 10 p.m.–1 a.m. for kids 3–12; $5 per hour,
per child). Teens have their own group night in one of the main dining
rooms, complete with photographs and an after-dinner show. Princess
does not offer private in-cabin babysitting.
While Princess offers really good facilities and amenities for parents and
children, it’s not a line that’s totally gung ho about catering only to fami-
lies. Therein lies a big advantage — Princess ships aren’t overrun with
children. In fact, a Princess reservations agent told us that they cap the
total number of kids under 18 at about 14 to 15 percent of a ship’s capac-
ity. On a recent cruise, Heidi took her young sons on the 3,100-passenger
Caribbean Princess (3,782 maximum occupancy) that maxed out at about
600 children, which is a far cry from the 800 to 1,200 kids under 17 that
lines such as Carnival, Disney, and Royal Caribbean routinely see. Sure,
she has kids of her own, but Heidi is the first to admit she still doesn’t
want to cruise with hordes of other kids. Princess offers a great middle
ground.
Celebrity Cruises
We love Celebrity. The line is a pro at pleasing adults with its gorgeous
ships, innovative entertainment and dining, and top spas. And though
they’re hardly as kid-focused as some of the lines mentioned earlier in
this chapter, they do a pretty good job of catering to children, too. All the
ships in the fleet have a playroom with great features, but the line’s four
newest and biggest Millennium-class ships (which also include the
Constellation, Infinity, and Summit) take top honors. Each has an indoor/
outdoor playroom complex that includes a fenced-in outdoor soft-surface
jungle gym and a wading pool, plus inside a computer room, movie room,
an arts-and-crafts area, and video arcade. Teens get a separate center.
Supervised activities are offered year-round. During kid-intensive times,
namely holidays and summers, activities are geared toward four age
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
122

groups. Hours are 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m. Plus, on
formal nights during holiday weeks, kids can dine with counselors
between about 6 and 7 p.m., while parents get a break.
 Ship Mates (ages 3–6) can go gaga over treasure hunts, clown par-
ties, T-shirt painting, dancing, movies, ship tours, mask-making and
parades around the ship, and ice-cream-sundae-making parties.
 Cadets (ages 7–9) have all of the above plus computer games.
 Ensigns (ages 10–12) may enjoy karaoke, computer games, board
games, trivia contests, arts and crafts, movies, and pizza parties.
 Teens (ages 13–17, and divided into two groups, 13–15 and 16–17),
who don’t think themselves too cool to participate, can join talent
shows, karaoke, pool games, and trivia contests. The Century-class
and Millennium-class ships have attractive teen discos/hangout
rooms (on the Zenith, bars and lounges are used for teen activities
before they’re opened for adults).
For the 3 to 12 set, Celebrity recently introduced Celebrity Science
Journeys, which expose kids to fun and educational activities daily, from
learning about insects and thunderstorms, to listening to dolphins and
whales communicate under water. There is also summer-stock theater
presentations, which involve three age groups: the Ship Mates and Cadets
sing, dance, and act, and the Ensigns direct and produce the plays.
For toddlers under age 3, parents can borrow a “treasure box” from the
playroom, which includes toys and books (though the under-3 set is not
allowed to use the playrooms with or without parents).
Group babysitting in the playroom is available for ages 3 to 12 every
evening from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. for children ages 3 to 12, and between
noon and 2 p.m. on port days, for $6 per child per hour. Private in-cabin
babysitting in the evening by a female crewmember is available on a lim-
ited basis for $8 per hour for up to two children (kids must be at least
6 months old); make your request 24 hours in advance.
The drinking age on Celebrity sailings is 18 for beer and wine whenever
a ship is in international waters, but parents have to sign a waiver stat-
ing their awareness of this rule. If parents don’t sign, the age is 21.
Holland America Line
In the old days, Holland America was pretty much an old folks’ line. In
the past few years, though, Holland America has made a great effort to
ditch this rep. The biggest change to the Club HAL program of late is the
lowering of the age minimum from 5 down to 3 (which will be fleetwide
by year-end 2006).
When enough are on board, kids are divided into three age groups.
You can find the most children on cruises during summers and holiday
weeks — for example, as many as 300 to 400 kids aboard the new 
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 123

Vista-class ships (Zuiderdam, Oosterdam, and Westerdam), especially in
the Caribbean. Otherwise, around 100 to 200 is typical. Every ship has at
least one full-time Club HAL youth director on board.
When demand warrants, typically during summers and holidays, pro-
gram hours are 9 a.m. to noon, 2 to 5 p.m., and 7 to 10 p.m.
 Kids (ages 3–7) can enjoy storytelling, arts and crafts, face painting,
pizza and ice-cream parties, ship tours, and bingo.
 Children (8–12), there’s golf ball putting, sports tournaments, scav-
enger hunts, movies, karaoke, air hockey, foosball, and Internet
access.
 Teens (13–17) are getting a lot of respect from Holland America.
New teen areas are designed to look like an artist’s loft, with a big-
screen TV, Internet access, video games, karaoke, and a music
system. A private sun deck outdoors has lounge chairs, a 9-foot-
high waterfall, snack machines, and a music system. Activities
there include dance parties, luaus, and sporting games. These
areas will be fleetwide by year-end 2006 (with the exception of the
line’s smallest ship, the Prisdendam, and a few ships that will have
only the indoor area).
Maasdam and the newer Vista-class ships have dedicated “KidZone”
playrooms and separate teen centers, and the other vessels are having
them installed (fleetwide by year-end 2006). Until then, those without
play areas will use multipurpose rooms for kids’ activities when neces-
sary. The dedicated centers are definitely an improvement, and have
computers, a large-screen TV for movies, and toys and games. All ships
have a small video arcade.
Group babysitting is offered daily for the 3 to 12 set between 10 p.m. and
midnight (and fleetwide by end 2006), at $5 an hour per child; in-cabin
babysitting is offered fleetwide if a crewmember is available, at $8 an
hour per child and $5 for each additional child.
If you sail in the Caribbean, the line has its own private island, called
Half Moon Cay. It’s an awesome place for families, with a kids’ aqua park
on the beach (complete with slides and water cannons), plus neat excur-
sions for the family, from horseback riding to snorkeling with stingrays.
Aside from stops at Half Moon Cay, the line does not offer kids’ activities
in port.
A couple surprise contenders
Aside from all these big-ship lines — which for the most part are all
things to all people of all ages — a handful of lines that you may think
don’t give a hoot about pleasing families really are quite family friendly.
Cunard connotes pomp and circumstance, God Save the Queen, and
scones. But snotty noses? Ball bins? Xboxes? Indeed, the Queen Mary 2
Part III: All Aboard: The Cruise Experience 
124

is about tradition, taste, and elegant things, but Cunard’s new grande
dame offers one of the most comprehensive kids’ programs at sea.
Complimentary activities are offered all day long until midnight for chil-
dren as young as one (most lines only start their programming at ages
two or three). The youth staff includes a couple of British nannies that
have completed a special two-year program in England.
The comfy playroom at the aft of deck 6 can be divided up to accommo-
date different age groups. Just outside on deck is a small wading pool
and another play gym.
 For kids (ages 1–6), there are plenty of toys, arts and crafts, a play
gym, and a ball bin, plus a separate nursery with cribs and toddler
beds for naptime.
 For the 7 to 12 set, half of the playroom is stocked with beanbag
chairs, board games, TVs, and Xboxes for video-game playing.
 Teens do stuff around the ship such as behind-the-scenes tours and
watching movies in the theater. Plus, teenagers with a cerebral side
will totally enjoy the ship’s cool planetarium, gym, and extensive
library and bookshop.
All play areas are open to babies/toddlers if accompanied by parent.
Dining options include the King’s Court buffet restaurant and the special
children’s tea offered daily from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Chef’s Galley.
Moving 180 degrees away from finger sandwiches and stiff upper lips
is Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, all rum swizzles and tube tops.
Adventurous kids who can part with their laser tag and Game Boys for
a week, will embrace the freewheeling fun of a Windjammer tall ship,
whose fleet sails through the more picturesque parts of the Caribbean.
These ships are like summer camp for the whole family, only here, par-
ents can unwind with a Red Stripe while the wind catches the sails and
pushes the ship into the next day of adventure.
For ages 6 to 17, three of the fleet’s five eccentric sailing ships offer
“Junior Jammer” kids programs during the summer.
On itineraries in the Bahamas, Costa Rica, and the southern Caribbean
islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao, the Legacy, Polynesia, and
Amazing Grace have counselors for two main age groups (6–11 and 12–17)
who supervise activities between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. daily in empty cabins
or in unused public rooms.
 Younger kids get to do arts and crafts, face paint, hair braid, build
sand castles, knot tying, hoist the sails, and visit the bridge.
 Teens can do stuff such as sailing, snorkeling, volleyball, navigat-
ing, and kayaking.
 There are even introductory scuba classes for 8- to 10-year-olds
and 11- to 16-year-olds.
Chapter 9: Catering to the Kids: Activities for Children and Teens 125

One child between 6 and 11 sails free May through early August when
sharing a cabin with parents.
Though none of Windjammer’s ships carries more than 122 passengers
(double occupancy), so many families are drawn to this quirky line that
30 or 40 kids per cruise during the summer is par for the course. That
nearly qualifies as a kiddie mob considering how small these ships are.
And the ultra-casual, “anything goes” atmosphere puts to rest any fear of
the kids disturbing the neighbors. With flip-flops and tank tops about as
formal as it gets, who’s going to complain about a little noise?

Cruise Lines and
Their Ships

In this part . . . 
T
he kind of ship you pick for yourself says something
about your personality — just as does the kind of house
you live in or car you drive. In this part, we review all the
major cruise lines and a healthy selection of the smaller, more
niche-oriented players, giving you the scoop on everything
from 3,000-passenger megaships to six-passenger schooners.
Which one’s for you? Though we focus primarily on ships
that sail the major cruise regions (the Caribbean, Alaska, and
the Mediterranean), we also include details on the ships’
other itineraries, from the Far East to Antarctica and off in
every other direction you can name.

S
ome people say cruise ships are all the same. Other people yell
back at them, telling them they’re nuts. The first people get all huffy,
“But it’s true! They’re all just these giant slab-sided beasts where you eat
and drink till you pop.” The second people shout back, “You moron,
what about the smaller, high-end ships, where it’s like you’re on a quiet,
private yacht?” First people say, “Yeah, well I can’t afford that!” Second
people say, “So? Then book on one of the premium mainstream lines;
they’re much more high-toned, like old-fashioned ocean liners.” First
people say, “Who needs high-toned? I want adventure!” Second people
say, “So go to Maine and sail on a schooner. You can even help hoist the
sails!” First people say, “What, you think you know everything?” Second
people say, “Yeah, of course we do. We wrote the For Dummies book,
didn’t we?”
So, there you have it. Different ships for different folks, and to give you
some idea of which is which, we use a kind of shorthand in the following
chapters to help you sort ships according to your tastes. This chapter
explains all those categories and what the different ratings and labels
mean. Reading through this chapter saves you time by giving you key
words and phrases to look for in the reviews so that you can find the
cruise lines and ships that best fit your tastes and those of your spouse
or other cruise companions.

Getting a Handle on the Big Picture
Each cruise line review begins with two shorthand notes about the kind
of experience the line offers, one ephemeral and one concrete.
Type of cruise
This note refers to the more ephemeral cruise experiences that a ship
has to offer. Here we break down the three major categories of cruise
lines we discuss in Chapter 3, and suggest a bit more detail about what
to expect on a particular cruise.
Mainstream cruises are the big boys of the cruise biz, with mostly giant
ships offering the latest attractions designed to appeal to the widest vari-
ety of travelers. “Premium” lines are ginned-up mainstreamers, offering a
more refined experience but without the super polish (or super-high
prices) of the true luxury lines. Among the mainstream and premium
lines, some ships tend to offer cruises geared more to families, party
types, or romantic types, though you may be surprised at how many are
able to offer all three. We use the description resort ships to refer to
those that are just good all-around vessels with a range of activities and
entertainment for everybody, though they may also appeal to families,
partiers, and romantic types, too.
Luxury cruises are really luxurious — in other words, they walk the
walk rather than just talking the talk. After all, almost every cruise line
claims that they’re luxurious, while few really are. Those are the ones
that stick to the highest standards: exceptional service, refined décor,
luxurious accommodations, a sophisticated ambience, and truly fine cui-
sine. They also tend to sail more wide-ranging itineraries, rarely doing
the kind of season-long round-trip cruises from the same homeports, the
way mainstream ships do. That gives you a much wider range of destina-
tions from which to choose. Another perk? Though their prices are
higher, they also tend to be more inclusive than mainstream rates, often
covering wines and spirits, gratuities, and sometimes some shore excur-
sions. There are a few adjectives we can think of to differentiate between
the luxury lines. On old-money lines, very traditional passengers enjoy
a very traditional experience. On active luxury lines, the focus may be
on taking out a Waverunner or sailboard rather than on putting on the
tux for evening cocktails. Family luxury lines attract a lot of younger
couples who sometimes sail with their kids.
Adventure and educational cruises are your best bet if you’re after an
experience that prizes in-depth learning about a destination’s nature and
culture more than quick port calls and onboard relaxation. These ships
rarely carry more than 200 passengers, and usually have naturalists and
historians aboard to interpret what you’re seeing. Within the small-ship
world, most lines break down into one of three subcategories. Learning
cruises go full-throttle into the educational aspects of travel, with onboard
experts from leading nature publications offering lectures and helping
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
130

with nature interpretation. Active adventure cruises also offer naturalists
and historians, but focus more on getting passengers out into nature, pro-
gramming kayaking, hiking, and trips by inflatable landing craft. Sailing
ships are just that — ships with sails, some of them offering passengers
the chance to help haul the lines and pull up the centerboard.
Ship size/style
The size and type of a ship you choose can make a huge difference in the
kind of experience you ultimately have. Fortunately, you have a tremen-
dous range to choose from. Options run the gamut from giant megaships
to the tiniest of tiny vessels — some carrying fewer than 20 passengers.
The following list gives you a handle on the various shapes and styles of
ships that fall under each designation.
Note: A ship’s size is expressed not in actual 2,000-pound tons but in gross
registered tons (GRTs), a figure that measures enclosed, interior space
used to produce revenue on a vessel (cabins, dining areas, lounges, video
game rooms, and so on). Tonnage, in ship terms, is a measure of volume
rather than weight. One gross registered ton actually represents 100 cubic
feet of enclosed, revenue-generating space.
 Megaships: When the word “megaship” came into common usage
in the late 1990s, it meant ships that were up around 80,000 GRTs.
Those ships still count as mega, but today the megaship category
also includes vessels literally twice that size, ranging up to Cunard’s
Queen Mary 2, at 151,400 GRTs, and Royal Caribbean’s new Freedom
of the Seas, which is expected to be around 160,000 GRTs when she
launches in mid-2006. Megaships carry from about 1,750 to more
than 3,000 passengers.
Big on glitz, megaships promote loads of activities, attract families
and a large share of the under-50 crowd, offer large public rooms
(including fancy casinos and fully equipped gyms), and provide a
wide variety of meal and entertainment options. They tend to visit
crowd-pleasing ports, but in many ways the ships themselves are
the big attraction, with the ports as an added bit of fun.
Most ships in the fleets of Carnival, Celebrity, Costa, Disney,
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Princess, and Royal Caribbean
are megaships, though some of these lines also maintain smaller
and frequently older ships as well. Holland America’s fleet is cur-
rently split between an older generation of midsize vessels and
newer megas.
 Traditional-style ships: These ships are modern with a traditional-
style twist, often in the midsize range (carrying around 700 to 1,500
passengers). They generally provide subdued, old-fashioned décor
and an onboard atmosphere geared primarily to older and/or more
tradition-minded passengers. Many Holland America ships fit into
this category, as do Oceania’s 684-passenger ships.
Chapter 10: The How-to of Comparative Cruise Shopping 131

 Modern midsize ships: These ships run about the same size as the
traditional-style midsize vessels but with a more contemporary
décor and ambience. Some are simply smaller equivalents of their
megasized sisters, providing the same kind of party atmosphere
but with fewer partiers — Royal Caribbean’s Empress of the Seas
fits that description, as do several of the older NCL ships. Other
vessels, such as Celebrity’s Zenith, provide a more stylish, less
party-oriented experience. Ditto for luxurious ships such as
Radisson Seven Seas’ luxurious Seven Seas Voyager and Seven Seas
Mariner and Crystal’s Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity, the
latter of which are downright glamorous. Luxe lines Silversea and
Radisson also have smaller midsize ships carrying around 400 to
500 passengers.
 Small ships: Small ships can negotiate shallow waters, which
enables them to reach ports that larger ships can’t manage. Often
running at a more relaxed pace, smaller ships tend to have fewer
children on board. In addition, the combination of smaller public
space and less entertainment creates an atmosphere in which you
spend a lot of time talking to other passengers. Some small ships
(such as the Seabourn and SeaDream vessels) are among the most
luxurious afloat, whereas others (such as those operated by
American Canadian Caribbean and Glacier Bay Cruiseline) are
among the most rustic. The rest fall somewhere in between.
 Sailing ships: If you dream of doing the Errol Flynn thing, or if
you’re a purist when it comes to taking to the seas, a sailing ship
may be your ticket. Sailing ship experiences run the gamut among
the lines currently in operation: from the authenticity of the Maine
Windjammers (many of which are more than 100 years old, and
work on sail power alone) to the modern yacht stylings of Windstar,
which operates some of the largest and most technically advanced
sailing ships ever built. Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, down in the
Caribbean, offers a bare-boned but raucous sailing adventure, while
Star Clippers is more high-toned yet still casual. More than with any
other type of cruising, if this is the type of cruise for you, you know
it. No one is wishy-washy about a sailing ship. You either love them
or you don’t.
Note that except for the Maine Windjammers, none of the sailing
ships we review in Chapter 13 operate on sail power alone; all also
have engines, which often account for most of the ship’s propulsion
and are a necessary evil if you want to keep any kind of regular
schedule.
In a few cases, a ship falls between a couple of different categories, or it
seems so unusual in one way or another that it doesn’t exactly fit into
one of these categories. We place these ships in what we think is the
nearest fit.

Grasping the Ins and Outs of Itineraries
Every cruise line review lists where all of its ships will sail in 2006, as
far out as we were able to get before this book went to press. Because
cruise lines tend to do some last-minute jostling, itineraries are subject
to change. Be sure to check with a travel agent or with the lines’ Web
sites for day-by-day listings of the ports each itinerary visits, and verify
sailing dates before you go too far in your planning.
The number of days we list for each cruise represents the number of full
days (including nights) you spend on board — we don’t count the hour
or two you’re on board on the last day of your cruise, waiting to get off
the ship. For example, cruises that begin and end on a Sunday count as
7-day cruises, even though some cruise line brochures may refer to them
as 8-day itineraries.
Understanding the Significance
of Specifications
So you can compare different ships, we also include a table with each
cruise line review that lists their ships’ vital statistics: size, passenger
capacity, number of crew, number of cabins, tonnage, and length.
To get a rough idea of how crowded a ship feels, divide its tonnage by
its total passenger capacity to arrive at the passenger/space ratio. To
get an idea of how personal the service is, divide the total number of
passengers by the total number of crew to get the passenger/crew ratio.
Getting a Handle on Prices
As we note in Chapter 4, people hardly ever pay full price for a cruise
(unless they’re booking with some of the small niche lines, which are the
exception that proves the rule). Cruise line brochure prices are typically
wildly inflated, representing what the line’s executives dream about
pocketing from each booking. In reality, they charge only a fraction of
that — sometimes as little as 50 percent. Prices listed on the cruise
lines’ Web sites are usually a lot closer to reality, but we’ve gone one
step further by having a travel agent, Nashville’s Just Cruisin’ Plus
(% 800-888-0922; www.justcruisinplus.com), investigate every
single ship in this book and tell us what their customers were actually
paying during a common sampling period (June 2005 cruises, priced in
mid-Apr). Other travel agencies and online sites will generally offer simi-
lar rates.
Chapter 10: The How-to of Comparative Cruise Shopping 133

Because ships offer itineraries of varying lengths (making it difficult to
compare prices), we’ve listed the sample prices as per diems. In other
words, what you see are daily per-person rates for a cruise. To figure out
what your total cost would be, just multiply that by the number of days
in the itinerary.
When you look at a cruise line’s brochure or Web site, you’re likely to
see that they offer sometimes a dozen or more different levels of state-
rooms, but at the most basic level they can all be broken down into
three basic types:
 Inside cabins: Cabins without windows
 Outside cabins: Cabins that may have portholes, picture windows,
or even private balconies
 Suites: Ranging from glorified staterooms with an extra seating area
to presidential-size mansions that may have more square footage
than your house, usually with a large private balcony or two
The sample rates include per diems for the lowest-priced option in those
three categories. Generally speaking, the largest and most desirable
inside cabins are priced closer to the rate we list for the lowest-level out-
side cabins; the largest and most desirable outside cabins are priced
closer to the rate we list for the lowest-level suite; and the biggest suites
are far, far higher priced than what we list for the low-level suites.
Because this book covers many different cruise regions, our sample
prices may not be an exact reflection of what you can expect to pay in
some regions. Cruises in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean, for
example, are almost always more expensive than comparable cruises
in the Caribbean and the Mexican Riviera. These prices are meant as a
guide only and are in no way etched in stone — the price you pay may be
higher or even lower, depending on when you choose to travel, when you
book, what specials the lines are offering, and a slew of other factors.
Rates are generally cruise only (without airfare or hotel rooms), per
person, and based on double occupancy. In cases where extras are
included in the cruise fare, we mention it. Unless noted otherwise,
prices listed include port charges (the per-passenger fee that ports
charge for ships to dock), but not government taxes.

Mainstream Ships
In This Chapter
 Introducing the major mainstream cruise lines and ships
 Getting the lowdown on the mainstream cruising experience
 Previewing the best new ships
T
he ships we feature in this chapter range from classic old ocean
liners to the biggest new megaships — some of them nearly four
times the size of the Titanic, but with technological features that are
more at home on the International Space Station.
If luxury ships are more your style, see Chapter 12. At the other end of
the spectrum, for a more down-to-earth experience, check out Chapter
13, where we discuss smaller adventure and expedition-type vessels.
What Makes Mainstream Ships Tick
Because the ships in this chapter may carry upwards of 2,000 or 3,000
passengers, getting stuck in some lines is inevitable — at the buffet, for
example, or when getting off the ship in port — though some megaships
are so well-designed that things rarely get backed up. The upside to all
that bigness? More options. Some ships these days are so gigantic that
they can offer more diversions than your average small town, but even
ships that aren’t so enormous probably fit that description, too.
Mainstream ships have the classics — swimming pools, health clubs and
spas, nightclubs and bars, movie theaters, casinos, shops, kids’ play-
rooms, and open decks. You can also find sports decks, virtual golf, com-
puter rooms, cigar clubs, martini bars, and sometimes learning centers
that offer classes that range from history to theater arts. Ship design has
come so far that, even on vessels carrying 3,000 or more passengers,
you can still find nooks to get away from it all. You may even find your-
self wondering where all those other people are.
Mainstream ships have large dining rooms and buffet areas that serve
as much food with as much variety and at almost as many times as a 24-
hour New York diner — and with better views to boot. Many offer formal
nights when you can dine in your tux or gown if you like, while others

are casual 24/7. Beyond their large traditional restaurants, most main-
stream ships these days also offer some combination of intimate, roman-
tic, alternative restaurants; casual restaurants where you can grab a
hamburger, hot dog, veggie burger, or a slice of pizza; buffets stuffed to
the gills with everything from cold cuts to Indian food; ice-cream par-
lors; caviar bars; and specialty coffee and snack bars. Wash it all down
with a drink — maybe from the ship’s wine, champagne, or martini bars,
or with a few beers at the sports bar.
You can find onboard activities such as games and contests, classes and
lectures, and a variety of entertainment options, including large-scale
production shows, quiet pianists, not-so-quiet dance bands, operatic
recitals, magicians, comedians, and more.
The ships generally offer a comfortable cruising experience, with your
well-being overseen by virtual armies of service employees. Ship stabi-
lizers ensure that you have a fairly smooth sailing experience, too.
In the cabins, you can find many of the typical accoutrements of modern
American life: TVs (and sometimes DVD players), telephones, hair
dryers, and sometimes dataports, minibars, private safes, and fuzzy
bathrobes. The cabins themselves range from cubbyholes to absolutely
enormous suites. You may choose to upgrade from a typical window
cabin to one with a private veranda so that you can lounge out in the
open air — clothed or unclothed, it’s up to you. (Though some aren’t
completely private. Careful! Unless you don’t care . . .)
Where the Mainstream Ships Go
Mainstream is as mainstream does, so the itineraries of the biggest ships
tend to include mostly tried-and-true ports — nothing too far out of the,
well, mainstream, but that’s not necessarily bad, especially if you’re
looking for a good time. Wherever the megaships dock, expect lots of
shopping, drinking, and eating options, plus huge lists of shore excur-
sions to take you far away from those things: out into the jungles, up
into the mountains, under the sea, or sometimes deep into history.
Some smaller ships also visit less-crowded ports, away from the typical
tourist crowds. The smaller the ship, the more easily it’s able to do this —
it can get into smaller harbors, and there’s no possibility its passengers
will overwhelm the town with their numbers.
As we note in Chapter 10, the rates we list here are sample per diems
that approximate the actual per-day prices passengers were paying as
this book went to press. The rates you find may be higher or even lower,
depending on market fluctuations. To arrive at an approximation of your
full vacation’s cost, just multiply the per diem by the number of nights in
the itinerary.

 Type of cruise: Family, party, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, glitzy megaships
The king of cruise, Carnival has been dishing up fun at sea since com-
pany patriarch Ted Arison launched the Mardi Gras way back in 1972.
The assets of parent company, Carnival Corporation, are mind-blowing
(and growing); all told, the company has a stake in 12 cruise brands, for
a combined fleet of 77 ships, with many more in the works.
More than 30 years and some 21 ships later, Carnival has evolved and
improved, though the core remains the same: let-your-hair-down fun on
outrageously themed ships. The line attracts a real mix — from those
with beer bellies and tattoos to types with graduate degrees and Gucci
loafers. A Carnival ship is the ultimate American melting pot.
Bob Marley blasts from the Pool Deck as happy campers young and
old swig Buds and drink in that wild Carnival take on a classic
Caribbean vacation. Sure, you can now find sushi and wine bars, but
the ships are still all about partying into the wee hours and over-the-top
flamboyance — where else would you find a Marilyn Monroe manikin or
King Tut’s tomb decorating a lounge? Carnival puts its whimsical spin on
themes from ancient Egypt and Greece to the Renaissance, New Orleans,
Billie Holiday, and Neil Armstrong. The One Small Step disco on the
Valor, for example, is a tribute to Armstrong’s walk on the moon. White
mini-volcanolike craters several feet tall glow with LED lighting, the ceil-
ing is a sea of twinkling lights, and the floor is made from moonlike white
marble and granite, and covered, of course, with astronaut “footprints.”
While food and service are pretty much average — not surprising consid-
ering the large numbers served — that doesn’t stop the line from trying to
offer a higher-quality vacation. Recent enhancements include switching
from plastic to china in the buffet restaurants, and equipping cabins with
thicker towels, duvets, and more TV channels. These extra touches along
with the line’s other assets — large cabins, professional service, lots of
entertainment, and great kids’ facilities — keep the masses coming back
for more. And boy has Carnival cashed in. Table 11-1 shows Carnival’s itin-
eraries and sample fares.
Carnival offers a Vacation Guarantee program: Any guest dissatisfied
with the cruise while on board can disembark at the first non-U.S. port of
call and receive a refund for the unused portion of their fare, plus reim-
bursement for air transportation back to the ship’s homeport. To qualify,
passengers must inform the ship’s purser before their first port of call.

Dining
Like most everything about Carnival, the quality and choice of the
food have improved over the years. Still, don’t expect gourmet. Geared
toward a middle-American audience, just like its mainstream peers,
you can find plenty of the basics — steaks, fish, and pasta — to go with
choices such as sushi and Chinese food. Each ship has a main dining
room or two that operate the traditional early and late seatings, plus a
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 139

casual buffet restaurant operating nearly round the clock (including
dinner nightly). An intimate reservations-only supper club/steakhouse
features live music and the ships’ most expertly prepared meals, with
a $25 per person cover, on the line’s newer ships: Carnival Spirit, Pride,
Legend, Conquest, Glory, Valor, Miracle, and Liberty. For casual, try pizza,
calzones, and Caesar salads available 24 hours a day; late-night buffet
spreads; patisseries for fancy coffees (for a charge); and room service.
There’s no shortage of bars, many with a healthy dose of Carnival’s
wacky design whimsy (try oyster shell wallpaper and furry bar stools).
Activities and entertainment
You won’t be bored if big, flashy stage shows are your bag. Carnival
doesn’t hold back, with lavish sets and casts of 8 to 16 cast members
decked out in over-the-top costumes. Live six- to ten-piece orchestras
accompany the dancers and lead singers. During a typical weeklong
cruise, comedians, jugglers, acrobats, blaring poolside pop bands, coun-
try-and-western bands, classical string trios, pianists, and big bands are
a part of the mix. The theaters on the Destiny-class, Spirit-class, and
Conquest-class ships are spectacular three-deck extravaganzas, and the
casinos are so large you may think you’ve died and gone to Vegas; but
even aboard its smaller, older ships, Carnival consistently offers some
of the most fun and flamboyant entertainment extravaganzas afloat.
Speaking of wacky, Carnival’s big on silly poolside games, such as belly-
flop contests and pillow fights. Doesn’t get much more cerebral than
that, though arts and crafts classes are occasionally offered along with
stuff like game shows, dancing lessons, and art auctions.
There’s plenty of time to enjoy the Carnival experience, given that the
line’s typical 7-night Caribbean cruises include three days at sea (and
just three ports). Of course, this schedule also means passengers have
more time to spend, spend, spend in the ships’ shops, bars, casinos, and
spas (cha-ching, cha-ching for Carnival’s coffers).
For kids
Among the top lines for kids, Camp Carnival delivers fun for toddlers
through teens. The newest Conquest-class ships (see Figure 11-1) have
the biggest and best digs with awesome teen centers and video arcades,
but the entire fleet has good playrooms and the line’s signature snaking
water slide on the Pool Deck. Complimentary activities are scheduled
nearly all day long. For an hourly fee, group babysitting for ages 4
months through 12 is offered nightly, plus for a few hours on port days.
When they turn down the cabins each night, room stewards get goofy by
making bathroom towels into fluffy animals and displaying them on the
beds. (You can even buy a book in the ship’s gift shop that shows you
how to do these tricks at home!)

Fleet facts
The Carnival Destiny was, in her first year (1996), the biggest ship in the
world, and she offers the “wows” you’d expect of a ship her size, including
huge spa and gym areas. The Carnival Triumph and Carnival Victory
are the Carnival Destiny’s slightly bigger siblings. A stretched version of
these ships, the Carnival Conquest, debuted in the fall of 2002, and three
sisters entered service in successive years: the Carnival Glory, Valor,
and Liberty. These ships are about 60 feet longer, with tonnage of 110,000
GRTs, and boast massive kids’ and teen areas.
In 2001, the line introduced a relatively small (by megaship standards)
class of ship: the 2,124-passenger, 84,000-ton Carnival Spirit, which
boasts an outdoor promenade and a supper club. Carnival Pride,
Carnival Legend, and Carnival Miracle arrived in the years following.
These vessels all offer the most successful design elements of Carnival’s
earlier classes of ships, including many bars and lounges.
Carnival’s Fantasy-class ships — the Ecstasy, Elation, Fantasy,
Fascination, Imagination, Inspiration, Paradise, and Sensation —
differ in their wacky décor but otherwise are the exact same size and have
identical layouts and Carnival’s roomy cabin size. They’re good party
ships, though a tad aged. If there was botox for cruise ships, these guys
could probably use a shot. The Celebration and Holiday are the older,
non-megaships in the Carnival fleet. They seem really ancient and out of
date compared to their newer fleetmates, but they have roomy cabins and
are often priced cheaper than the line’s other ships. Table 11-2 shows the
current fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Family, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, stylish midsize and megaships
We’ll just admit it right now, we’re in love with Celebrity. Who could
resist the most elegant big ships in the industry? Celebrity offers a
refined experience, but isn’t stuffy. There’s plenty of fun to be had and
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships

lots of activities to keep you busy, but you can always find a quiet spot,
too, for some good old-fashioned R & R. Each ship is glamorous and
comfortable, mixing sleekly modern and Art Deco styles and throwing
in cutting-edge art collections to boot.
Hands down, Celebrity has the best vessels in the mid-priced category —
the Century, Galaxy, Mercury (see Figure 11-2), and especially the newer
Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation. Celebrity gets the “best of”
nod in a lot of categories: The AquaSpas on the line’s megaships are tops,
the art collections the most compelling fleetwide, the décor the most
original, and the onboard activities and entertainment among the most
varied. Dining-wise, Celebrity shines with its dashing alternative restau-
rants on the Millennium-class ships, the best at sea for both quality of
food and their gorgeous décor. Table 11-3 shows Celebrity’s itineraries
and sample fares.
From its beginnings, the polite and professional staff has been a cut
above the competition and contributes greatly to the elegant mood.
Passengers, who range in age from 20-something honeymooners to
retirees, are pampered in a low-key, non-invasive way. Like all the big-
ship lines, Celebrity offers lots for its passengers to do, but Celebrity
steers away from the standards. Innovative entertainment includes
roving a cappella groups, while expert-led seminars on topics such as
astronomy, photography, personal investing, and history offer a little
more cerebral meat than the usual. The latest: acupuncture and holistic
healing theme cruises and Cirque du Soleil–inspired shows.
Art is an important aspect of the Celebrity experience. It’s everywhere
on board and no other line in the industry comes close to offering col-
lections as intriguing. The Summit, for example, has Woman With Fruit,
a large bronze of a rotund woman by noted Colombian artist Fernando
Botero (the sculpture overlooks the ship’s thalassotherapy pool area),
as well as an ART sculpture by LOVE artist Robert Indiana. There are
also originals on the ships by David Hockney, Jasper Johns, Jeff Koons,
David Levinthal, Liza Lou, Andy Warhol, and many others. 
Dining
Michel Roux, Celebrity’s famous culinary consultant and one of the top
French chefs in Britain, guides all Celebrity cuisine. His talents and
legacy shine brightest in the intimate alternative dining venues on the
Millennium-class ships, where you can have just about the best dining
experience available at sea.
The Millennium has a special reservations-only dining room with a great
feature: hand-carved wood panels that were created for the Olympic
(sister ship to the Titanic) and graced that vessel’s A La Carte restaurant
from 1911 to 1935. The dining experience in the restaurant created
around these panels is leisurely and luxurious, styled after liners cruis-
ing in the Golden Age of sea travel (although be prepared to enjoy it for
three hours). The line offers comparably fine restaurants with intriguing

décor on the Infinity, Summit, and Constellation. The cost at these venues
is $30 per person, and is totally worthwhile. Feast on appetizers such as
a tartare of salmon garnished with quail eggs or goat cheese soufflé with
tomato coulis, followed by entrees such as shrimp scampi flambéed in
Armagnac or rack of lamb coated with mushroom duxelles and wrapped
in a puff pastry. For dessert, try saying no to the chocolate soufflé or a
plate of Michel Roux’s favorite bite-size desserts.
On all but the Zenith, the ships’ main dining rooms are lovely two-deck-
high affairs with a dramatic staircase at the center sharing the attention
with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the ships’ wake — quite a sight on a
moonlit night. Cuisine here is good, on par with other big-ship lines.
Each ship also has a buffet restaurant operating for all meals, but unlike
other big ships, waiters carry your tray to a table. Dinner is served here
most nights (including a sushi bar), but reservations are requested.
There’s also a specialty coffee bar — the Cova Cafe — and each
Millennium-class ship has a Spa Cafe in a corner of the thalassotherapy
pool area serving a light and healthy breakfast (such as fresh fruit and
bagels and lox) and lunch (including raw veggie platters, vegetarian
sushi, and pretty tuna or chicken salads). Several nights a week around
midnight, waiters roam the public areas and lounges with upscale
canapés and hors d’oeuvres such as fish tempura and roasted garlic
lemon chicken. At least once per cruise fleetwide, the line offers what
it calls Elegant Tea, an impressive event in which white-gloved waiters
serve tea, finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts from rolling trolleys.
The line’s 24-hour room service allows passengers to order off the lunch
and dinner menus during those hours.
Activities and entertainment
Like in so many other areas, Celebrity excels with its wide variety of
activities and entertainment. Its complimentary enrichment lectures are
offered on all cruises. Up to four featured speakers/performers may
include caricature artists (on weeklong Caribbean and Bermuda sail-
ings), naturalists (on Alaska, Hawaii, and South America sailings), chefs
from well-regarded shoreside restaurants, and wine experts who offer
onboard seminars and tastings. From time to time, actors, politicians,
and journalists also sail aboard and hold talks. Other innovative activi-
ties include the line’s Acupuncture at Sea program. On all cruises, doc-
tors specializing in Oriental medicine give free talks on acupuncture and

other holistic health treatments and offer acupuncture and medicinal
herbal treatments (for a fee) for pain management, smoking cessation,
weight loss, stress management, and other ailments.
You can find more standard fare such as wine tastings, horse racing,
bingo, bridge, art auctions, trivia games, arts and crafts, cooking demos,
computer classes, dancing lessons, and lots of great spa treatments.
With the exception of the Zenith, Celebrity’s ships each feature the
AquaSpa, a water-centered spa that’s the equal of anything else the
industry offers. They all have a thalassotherapy pool, a kind of giant
New Age hot tub where water jets hit different parts of your body as you
relax. Decorated beautifully — with a Japanese motif on the Century and
Galaxy, for example — the spas also offer some of the most innovative
spa treatments at sea. From a Hawaiian Four Hands massage (yes, two
therapists work on you at once) to Rasul (a medicinal mud and steam
bath treatment) or a frangipani body wrap, how could you resist?
Celebrity has partnered with fantasy circus troupe Cirque du Soleil. The
observation lounges on Constellation and Summit, the two ships that at
press time were offering the show, are transformed for two hours every
evening into “The Bar at the Edge of the Earth,” where guests engage in
interactive performances (as opposed to a straight stage show) with sur-
real Cirque characters. Typically, one or two performers are from the
company’s actual traveling circus, while the rest are from the ship’s
entertainment staff. Otherwise, Celebrity continues to offer some nice,
understated entertainment touches such as strolling a cappella groups,
harpists, and classical trios performing in various parts of each ship.
The line also offers a taste of more standard entertainment fare, with
Broadway-style musical reviews; performances by magicians, comedi-
ans, and cabaret acts; and passenger talent shows. Head for the disco
one night, or skip out completely and retire to one of the many cozy
dark lounges for a quiet evening, among the best being the elegant and
plush Michael’s Club piano lounges.
For kids
The Millennium, Constellation, Infinity, and Summit are the best fit for
families, each with an indoor and outdoor play area, though every ship
in the fleet has a playroom and all but the Zenith have teen centers.
Some supervised activities are offered year-round, though during holi-
days and summers there’s more: complimentary activities are geared
toward four age groups between the ages of 3 and 17. Group babysitting
and private in-cabin sitting are available for an hourly fee nightly for
ages 3 to 12.

Fleet facts
The oldest Celebrity ship, the Zenith, is a fine ship if you’re looking for
something smaller than average, but when the company moved into the
megaship business, it topped itself with the impressive Century, and
then topped itself again with the Galaxy and again with the Mercury,
which will undergo a $55 million facelift in spring 2006. The line’s 91,000-
ton, French-built Millennium-class ships continue the trend. These ves-
sels — the Millennium, Infinity, Summit, and Constellation — are just
plain stunning: comfortable, beautifully designed, and full of lovely
rooms and varied diversions, such as an Internet center, a music library,
and extensive high-fashion shopping opportunities. The Infinity, Summit,
and Constellation have a conservatory complete with benches and
orchids (the Millennium has a smaller version) — a botanical garden at
sea, a respite from the hustle and bustle of daily sea life.
In general, the cabins on Celebrity ships are all good-sized and deco-
rated nicely (though not as big as Carnival’s cabins, for example). All
cabins fleetwide (with the exception of the Zenith) have minifridges. The
ships’ penthouse suites are very large and quite pleasing on the eyes,
and all suites reap the services of a butler and other perks such as free
champagne and the option of booking a massage in your cabin. Table
11-4 shows the current fleet specifications.

Costa Cruises
200 South Park Rd., Suite 200, Hollywood, FL 33021-8541; % 800-462-6782; www.
costacruises.com
 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships and modern midsize ships
The origins of Costa are in Italy, and even though the company is now
owned by Miami-based Carnival Corporation, its origins show in nearly
everything it offers, from food to entertainment to decorative elements
and the many Italian-speaking crewmembers. Onboard activities include
festive Roman toga parties on Caribbean sailings, carnival and circus
nights in Europe, and audience-participation shows with a distinctly
European flavor. The line doesn’t design its cruises strictly for an
American audience, and therein lies its charm.
As the number-one cruise line in Europe, Costa boasts a modern fleet
that just keeps getting bigger. Between June 2003 and November 2004, it
launched three new megaships — the Costa Mediterranea and the sister
ships Costa Fortuna and Costa Magica. Two more are in the works: the
112,000-ton, 3,800-passenger Costa Concordia (due summer 2006) and
an as-yet-unnamed sister ship scheduled for spring 2007.
The cruises draw a good age mix, including honeymooners and families,
many of whom are attracted to the line’s atmosphere of festive fun. A
good number of Italian-Americans are among the clientele on Caribbean
sailings. On European sailings, Americans make up only about 20 percent
of the passenger mix, which is predominantly Italian but also includes
French, German, and British citizens, among others. That leads to some
looooooong strings of announcements, which sometimes need to be
repeated in five different languages. The European mix also means that
many passengers smoke like chimneys, though smoking is officially
banned in all main dining rooms and main showrooms on all vessels.

Dining
Costa’s food, oddly enough, is only average, though the line’s pastas
and pizza are very tasty and plentiful, and presented in an authentically
Italian style. On theme nights, staffers may dress as gondoliers and pres-
ent red roses to all the women. Aside from the main restaurants, alterna-
tive dining venues include reservations-only alternative restaurants
aboard most of the line’s vessels, offering Mediterranean dishes such as
rigatoni served with lobster and tomatoes, or grilled lamb chops (for a
cover charge of $23 per person). A Tuscan steakhouse menu is also
available. Other noshing includes pizza cafes and patisseries serving
espresso, chocolates, and pastries.
Activities and entertainment
More than anything else, Costa is known for its exuberant (and often
Italian-inspired) activities, with three nights per 7-night cruise given over
to Italian and Mediterranean themes. A cast of extremely energetic and
shockingly attractive activities coordinators (known as the “animation
staff”) keep the atmosphere hopping into the wee hours.
The Roman Bacchanal Toga Night ends with a hysterical show that’s half
slapstick vaudeville and half American Idol. After each act, Julius Caesar
and the audience decide whether to send the performers to the buffet
or throw them to the lions. Yes, it’s Italian à la Disney, but if you down
enough Campari, it all sort of starts to work, and the next time your
Filipino cabin steward greets you with “Buongiorno!” you may find your-
self buongiorno-ing right back.
The Costa experience also includes an almost-daily Catholic mass at
each ship’s chapel. Those who worship at the temple of golf can attend a
Golf Academy at Sea program on Caribbean cruises, in which guests take
onboard clinics and private lessons with PGA pros, participate in putting
competitions, and play at some of the Caribbean’s best courses.
For kids
Costa’s kids’ programs aren’t as extensive as those available on other
lines such as Disney and Royal Caribbean, but how many lines offer
Italian language classes? Each ship has a playroom and carries at least
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
150

two full-time youth counselors to supervise kids’ activities, which are
offered for ages 3 to 17 for two or three age groupings, depending on
demand. Group babysitting is offered nightly (for a fee) if parents want
to catch a show or do cocktails.
Figure 11-3: Costa Atlantica
Fleet facts
Costa Allegra began life as a freighter back in the 1960s and was com-
pletely transformed into a passenger cruiser in the 1990s, with a contem-
porary Italian look. Outside, she still maintains the profile of a tough,
classic working ship, albeit in bright cruise-ship white. Ditto for Costa
Marina, another ’60s-vintage ship that was totally overhauled in the
’90s, by the same architect.
Costa Classica and sister-ship Costa Romantica are stylish vessels
built in the early 1990s, Classica with a modern, contemporary décor
and Romantica with a warmer, more woody look. Costa Europa was
extensively reconfigured and remodeled when she joined the Costa fleet.
Though she’s not very old in human-years, she has the solid feel of an
old ocean liner.
Costa Victoria ushered Costa into the megaship era back in 1996 and
remains a sleek and stylish ship, with bright interiors, a seven-story
atrium, and a dramatic four-story lounge that’s reminiscent of spaces
aboard the great old deco liners, albeit with a lot of chrome and glass. In
2004, 246 of her cabins were retrofitted with balconies. Megaship Costa
Atlantica (see Figure 11-3) was the first in the fleet built with a large
number of private verandas (nearly 65 percent of the ship’s outside
cabins). The vessel’s decks are named after films by the great director
Federico Fellini, and its Café Florian is modeled after the landmark 18th-
century Venetian cafe of the same name, with gilt moldings and intricate
wall and ceiling murals. Atlantica’s sister ship, Costa Mediterranea, has
a dance motif and a similarly bright, festive décor.
Costa’s two most recent megaships, Costa Fortuna and Costa Magica,
are somewhat like Carnival ships with an Italian slant. They’re the largest
passenger ships in Italian maritime history — at least until summer 2006,
when the 112,000-ton Costa Concordia debuts. Table 11-6 shows the cur-
rent fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Family, resort
 Ship size/style: Modern, stylish megaships with the Disney touch
Just about everything Mickey’s gloved hand touches turns to gold, and
the company’s pair of elegant cruise ships is no exception. The Disney
Magic (see Figure 11-4) and Wonder manage to be both classic and ultra-
modern, designed to evoke the grand transatlantic liners but also
decked out in some great family features.
In creating the line, Disney (being Disney) tried to rewrite the book on
cruising and has succeeded with several of its innovations, which, by
the way, you pay 20 to 80 percent more for compared to many other big-
ship lines, according to Charlie Funk, co-owner of Just Cruisin’ Plus in
Nashville. But you get a lot for the higher price tag. The ships’ cabins are
larger than the industry average and are designed with families in mind
(many come with a bathroom divided into two separate compartments:
one for the toilet and another for the shower/bath). In the dining depart-
ment, guests can rotate among a set of cool themed restaurants. Unique
Disney-inspired entertainment, as you may expect, is among the best in
the industry and includes original Broadway-style shows, first-run films
(shown in a real movie theater), and even an occasional movie premiere
at sea (coinciding with the movie’s land opening). A stage show, The
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
152

Golden Mickeys, takes the audience through the history of Disney films
and animation in an Academy Award–type format. The line’s kids’ pro-
grams are the best at sea and include a nursery for babies and toddlers
as young as 3 months, awesome teen areas, and free supervised activi-
ties until midnight daily.
WOW! What else could parents and kids ask for? Of course enjoying all
this assumes you can appreciate the mouse and all the wholesome family
values he stands for (the ships have no casino, for example). That said,
the company has successfully infused the ships and the experience with
a subtler dose of Disney iconography than you may expect. For example,
Mickey and his pals only make a few schedule appearances during the
cruise, and the cool Art Deco– and Art Nouveau–inspired design takes
center stage (and not Mickey’s face).
The ships carry 1,754 passengers at the rate of two per cabin, but since
Disney is a family company and its ships were built expressly to carry
three, four, and five people in virtually every cabin, the ship could theo-
retically carry a whopping 3,325 passengers. About 1,000 kids and teens
are aboard any given sailing. Passengers are usually spread out around
the ship, so it doesn’t feel that crowded except for the often-packed kids
pool area and the cramped buffet restaurant.
If you want a taste of land and sea, you can easily combine Disney’s 3-
and 4-night cruises aboard Disney Wonder with a Disney theme park and
hotel package to create a weeklong combo vacation, with bus transporta-
tion between the parks and port included. Table 11-7 shows Disney’s itin-
eraries and sample fares.
Dining
Disney’s dining scheme is like no other. Guests rotate among three differ-
ent restaurants, each with a whimsical design theme that keeps the kids
(and parents) from getting bored. The Animator’s Palette restaurant is
the most entertaining, given the whole room changes colors throughout
the meal (it’s all magic, of course). Parrot Cay has a bright jungle theme,
while Lumiere’s (on Wonder) and Triton’s (on Magic) are the more ele-
gant venues. Of course, all the restaurants have great kids’ menus, and
friendly servers are used to catering to the kids.
If adults want a night out alone in a cozy, dimly lit venue, Palo’s is the
place ($10 per person). It serves tasty northern Italian food and gets
booked up fast, so make a reservation pronto when you first board.
Other noshing opps include a buffet restaurant, open for breakfast,
lunch and sometimes dinner. It’s small and cramped though.
The ships excel in the snack department, with the poolside Pluto’s Dog
House guaranteed to be a big hit. Who can argue with chicken tenders,
fries, burgers, nachos, bratwurst, and other quick snacks served from
lunch through the dinner hour. There’s also pizza, ice cream, 24-hour
room service, and a specialty coffee bar.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 153

Free fountain soda. All other big-ship lines — Carnival, Royal Caribbean,
Norwegian, and so on — charge for them.
Activities and entertainment
Disney’s fresh, family-oriented take on entertainment and activities
includes, of course, plenty of Disney-inspired stuff. Broadway-style stage
shows in the well-equipped Walt Disney Theatre include various musical
medleys of Disney classics. Other options include audience-participation
game shows, karaoke, and themed after-dinner deck parties. There’s a
movie theater too, plus activities during the day such as wine tastings,
galley tours, bingo, and informal lectures and seminars on all sorts of
things, from animation to nautical themes, Disney history, home enter-
taining, and cooking. Talks from people involved with Disney’s Broadway,
film, and television productions are also often featured. The Pool Deck
with its three pool areas (one each for kids, families, and adults) is
always bustling. In fact, on sunny sea days, look out, the kids’ pool area
feels like a sardine can.
Sure Disney caters to families, but you’d be surprised how many folks
without kids like the Disney experience, including honeymooners. To
offer them, and their parents, too, some kid-free down time, the ships
shave off an adults-only (18 and older) entertainment area at one end of
the ship. Here you can find a jazz bar, a dance club, and a combination
sports pub and karaoke bar. There’s also Palo’s restaurant and even an
adults-only pool area (though the occasional kid wanders through). The
gym and spa are also reserved for adults most of the time.
For kids
As you’d expect, the ships excel in this area. From three months on up,
children are catered to. Babies get their own nursery (for an hourly fee),
kids get two gigantic playrooms, and teens have a private complex all to
themselves. Complimentary supervised activities are offered until mid-
night daily, with some 50 youth counselors running the show (many
more than the other lines offer). There is no private in-cabin babysitting.

Disney’s private island in the Bahamas, Castaway Cay, is included on
nearly all itineraries and is a cruise highlight. The ship docks right at the
island, so no riding shuttle boats back and forth from the ship. The kids’
area will have them squealing with delight over the barrels to crawl
through, the giant whale-dig site to explore, and more. Adults will fall in
love with the adult beach area sequestered away at one end of the island,
complete with rustic bar and massage cabanas. For the whole family,
there are watersports and even bikes for rent.
Kids under 3 who travel as a third, fourth, or fifth passenger and share a
cabin with two adults pay $99 for a 3- or 4-night cruise and $139 for a 7-
night cruise.
Figure 11-4: Disney Magic
Fleet facts
The two Disney ships are nearly identical. Both pay tribute to the classic
ocean liners with their deep blue hulls, twin smokestacks, and updated
classic décor — Art Deco on the Magic and lighter Art Nouveau on
the Wonder. Cabins are bigger than standard and have minifridges
and an abundance of storage space; the 82 suites are particularly plush.

Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 155

 Type of cruise: Family, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Traditional-style midsize ships
Holland America (HAL) has been around for a loooooong time, in fact,
more than 130 years. Though its ships are as modern and high-tech as
any others in the business, the line has managed to hang on to more of
its seafaring history and tradition than any line today except Cunard.
Though the line has moved away from catering to a seniors-only crowd
and focused on attracting a broader market, the ships still offer an old-
world elegance for a mellow crowd. With a few exceptions (namely the
Zuiderdam and Oosterdam of the line’s newest Vista class), décor is
understated and the vibe is subdued. Lots of fresh flowers, seafaring
memorabilia, and Indonesian fabrics and woodcarving evoke Holland’s
relationship with its former colony. These classic touches, along with
moderate size of most ships, are quite refreshing in this age of shock ’em
glitz and over-the-top scale. New or old, big or small, the Holland America
vessels are exceedingly handsome, their navy-blue hulls are well main-
tained, and the ships have excellent (and remarkably similar) layouts
that ease passenger movement.
Holland America is in the midst of a fleetwide $225 million upgrade pro-
gram it calls “Signature of Excellence.” By the time this book goes to
press in late 2005, most ships will have been refitted with enhanced
dining, cabins, service, and activities (the Veendam, Maasdam, and
Oosterdam get facelifts in 2006). Cabin improvements include flat-panel
plasma TVs, DVD players, plush mattresses, massage showerheads,
salon-quality hair dryers, and more. Suites get new duvets, fully-stocked
minibars, and personalized stationery, and all suite guests will have
access to a 24-hour concierge service and lounge. In addition to an
expanded lecture series, each ship will get a special demonstration
kitchen for food and wine events. HAL’s pre-Vista-class vessels will gain a
combination lounge, library, coffee shop, and Internet cafe. Kids’ facili-
ties will also be upgraded, and the spas will be enhanced to match the
well-equipped Greenhouse Spas introduced on the Vista-class ships.
Table 11-9 shows Holland America’s itineraries and sample fares.
The line makes a conscious effort to appeal to single travelers, with a
guaranteed share program for nonsmoking singles (of the same sex).
Also, gentlemen hosts are brought on sailings of 14 days or more to
socialize with single female passengers who want company.
Dining
Cuisine has improved over the years, and is comparable to what you
may find on the other mainstream lines. The highlight of the dining
options are the ship’s formal restaurants, which are elegant two-story
affairs that offer four seatings and feature live music. Aside from stan-
dards such as broiled lobster tail, grilled salmon, and filet mignon, you
can find light options on the menu as well as vegetarian options (Matt,
our resident vegetarian, went gaga recently over the tofu stroganoff).

The Pinnacle Grill is an alternative restaurant that offers what the line
calls Pacific Northwest cuisine. Choices include crab cakes, salmon,
wild mushroom ravioli, and premium beef cuts, all complemented with
regional wines. The cover charge here is $20 per person. On a recent
Westerdam cruise, the service was top rate and the food exceeded our
expectations — make reservations as early as possible when you board.

For the casual diner, all ships have attractive and well-stocked buffet
restaurants that are open nearly round-the-clock, including dinner
nightly. Pizza and ice-cream stations are open till late afternoon, a taco
bar is open during lunch, and a poolside grill serves hamburgers, hot
dogs, veggie and turkey burgers, and a special of the day, such as knock-
wurst or spicy Italian sausage.
Once per cruise there’s a fancy High Tea (a rarity these days); the other
days there’s a more casual tea service, and you can find free hot canapés
served in some of the bars/lounges during the cocktail hour (none of the
other mainstream lines do this). Room service is offered 24 hours a day.
There’s also a specialty coffee bar, a nightly spread of snacks in the
buffet restaurant around midnight, and one gala dessert buffet every
week featuring lots of chocolate things plus marzipan, creampuffs, and
other diet busters.
Activities and entertainment
Though there’s a greater variety of things to do than ever, Holland
America still attracts a mostly early-to-bed crowd. You can head to the
disco or enjoy after-dinner cocktails or a show, but don’t expect to be
joined by half the ship doing the same thing as you might on Royal
Caribbean, Norwegian, Carnival, or even Princess.
Even if most passengers aren’t partying into the wee hours, most sample
the ships’ varied roster of things to see and do. Production shows include
fairly lavish sets and choreography complete with lasers and fancy cos-
tumes (though we scold the line for not having a live orchestra for these
shows on the Vista-class ships, where we’re told there isn’t enough
space). There are also passenger and crew talent shows and live music in
various lounges. Activities are plentiful and may include dance lessons,
cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, bingo, ship tours, and country-
western and ’50s parties. There’s also some tomfoolery on the Pool Deck,
so head out there if goofy relay races make you laugh.
On 7-night Alaska cruises, Native artists demonstrate traditional arts
such as ivory and soapstone carving, basket weaving, and mask making
as part of the line’s Artists in Residence program, created under the aus-
pices of Anchorage’s Alaska Native Heritage Center. Another program
offered during visits to Glacier Bay brings a member of the Huna tribe
aboard to talk about the land, which the Huna have called home for cen-
turies. In Hawaii and Mexico, cultural dancers perform.
For kids
To make good on its pledge to cater to a wider audience, Holland America
recently lowered the age minimum of its Club HAL complimentary kids’
activities from 5 down to 3 (which will be fleetwide by year-end 2006).
When enough kids are on board (usually holidays and summers), activi-
ties are offered for three age groups between 3 and 17. Though you rarely
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 159

see more than 300 or 400 kids aboard any ship, the new playrooms and
cool indoor/outdoor teen centers are pretty impressive (and will be added
fleetwide by year-end 2006). Group babysitting is offered for an hourly
rate between 10 p.m. and midnight daily for the 3 to 12 set, plus private in-
cabin sitting is also available.
In the Caribbean, the line has its own private island, called Half Moon
Cay. It’s an awesome place for families, with a kids’ aqua park on the
beach (complete with slides and water cannons), plus neat excursions
for the family, from horseback riding to snorkeling with stingrays.
Especially useful if traveling with children, most cabins on all ships have
bathtubs (on other lines, typically only suites have tubs), and standard
cabins are among the largest in the mainstream segment.
Figure 11-5: Volendam
Fleet facts
The Statendam, Maasdam, Ryndam, and Veendam are attractive mid-
size ships built in the mid-1990s, just before the ultrajumbo ships were
launched. Though mellow by today’s in-your-face standards, they’re all-
around appealing ships, with enhanced spa and children’s facilities,
Internet cafes, alternative dining restaurants, and other perks.
The flagship Rotterdam VI is a bigger vessel that sets new standards for
ship design, although the basic layout of its public rooms is similar to
that on the Statendam-class sisters. The Volendam (see Figure 11-5) and
Zaandam combine features of both the Statendam-class and Rotterdam
VI, with a bit more pizzazz thrown in to appeal to a younger crowd. For
example, the Zaandam’s music theme includes a wacky mix of instru-
ments on display, from a gigantic pipe organ in the atrium to a collection
of guitars autographed by Iggy Pop, the Rolling Stones, and Queen, and a
saxophone that President Clinton played in Holland.
The Amsterdam is a sister ship to the Rotterdam VI and is the first ship
in the fleet with a high-tech, environmentally friendly propulsion system
that provides a smoother ride than the usual rumbling diesels. The
Prinsendam is the line’s smallest ship; it’s cozy, couples-oriented, rela-
tively elegant, and features big, fancy suites.

Holland America went mega in September of 2002, with its largest ship to
date: the 85,000-ton, 1,848-passenger Zuiderdam, which was later joined
by the virtually identical Oosterdam, Westerdam (the third ship in the
line’s history to have that name), and coming in early 2006, Noordam.
These Vista-class ships are bigger, with more public spaces (such as a
dedicated disco, sports bar, and the fleet’s largest spas), and brighter (in
the case of the Zuiderdam, maybe too bright and hip). Table 11-10 shows
the current fleet specifications.
Wheelchair-accessible tenders are available on all the ships.

 Type of cruise: Resort, party
 Ship size/style: Modern midsize ships, with megaships on the way
MSC Cruises is a relatively young cruise line, born back in 1990 as
the cruise arm of Mediterranean Shipping, the world’s second-largest
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 161

container-shipping company. Like Costa, the line stresses its Italian roots,
but in a less flashy, “Si, we’re Italian; would you like some espresso?” kind
of way. MSC started with a few old-time ocean cruisers (which it now calls
its “classic fleet”), but has been in overdrive since 2003, launching two
purpose-built ships, buying two vessels at auction, and placing orders for
a new generation of megaships, one for delivery in June 2006 and another
for 2007.
MSC’s “modern fleet” (the four ships typically marketed to North
Americans) appeals to travelers who want a more traditional style of
cruise, with smaller, more human-scale ships; traditional dining rituals;
few gimmicks; and lots of socializing. Activities are fun and group-
oriented, and the ships’ modest sizes mean staff may greet you by name
after a day or two.
Passengers’ typical age range is mid-40s and up, and MSC’s Mediterranean
itineraries tend to carry 85 percent European and 15 percent North
Americans and “other.” Unlike Costa, though, which is all about activities,
MSC’s “quiet ship” approach means there are few announcements during
the day, so you’re not subjected to an endless stream of translations. In
the Caribbean, announcements are made in two languages, English and
Italian (in that order). Passenger nationalities on Caribbean itineraries are
the exact opposite of European sailings, with Americans dominating. Also
at diametrically opposed poles is the issue of kids, with European itiner-
aries tending to carry a lot of them, but Caribbean ones seeing very few.
Table 11-11 shows MSC’s itineraries and sample fares.
Dining
Dining service is traditional, with a very European sensibility — which
means courteous and professional rather than U.S.-style “Hey every-
body, my name’s George!” overfriendly. When the line began its big push
on the American market, we heard some complaints about slow and
indifferent service (and experienced some of the same ourselves), but
the line’s put a lot of effort into training since then. Ditto for the way the
line handles varying European and American tastes. In late 2004, some
American peculiarities — such as automatic after-dinner coffee, bagels
at breakfast, and a love of artificial sweeteners — were not easily accom-
modated, but changing the dynamic so that all passengers would get
“the best of both worlds” was tops on the new management’s list.
On the line’s “modern fleet,” two formal dining rooms serve open-seating
breakfast and lunch and a traditional dinner in two fixed seatings, with
an emphasis on Italian cuisine. An Italian regional specialty is featured
every night, with descriptive menu information. Casual dining is also
available in the buffet restaurant at breakfast and lunch. There’s also a
standard grill on the Pool Deck during the day, and Italian specialty
snacks are available at night. At the witching hour, the line offers one of
the few daily midnight buffets left in the industry.

Activities and entertainment
Activities, led by a young “animation team,” tend toward the traditional,
many of them with a European sense of fun. During the day, expect games
by the pool (including water polo and treasure hunts), dance lessons,

and an occasional informal lecture in one of the lounges. At night, stage
shows range from ho-hum production numbers to pretty interesting seg-
ments that draw on European circus traditions, featuring contortionists,
acrobats, and stilt performers. Special shows may also feature operatic
soloists or magicians. Elsewhere, the animation team leads participatory
games in a lounge, while music, dancing, casino gambling, and piano bar
entertainment are available around the ships.
For kids
Each ship has a cute (though smallish) children’s center, while other kid-
centric activities around the ship may include “baby disco” and balloon-
tying shows. Private babysitting (for a fee) can be arranged through the
main desk.
Figure 11-6: Opera
Fleet facts
While MSC’s U.S. sales office markets all its ships to Americans, the
emphasis is definitely on the “modern fleet,” the Opera, Lirica, Sinfonia,
and Armonia.
The sister ships Lirica and Opera (see Figure 11-6) are straightforward
midsize vessels without any bizarre attractions or gimmicks — no plane-
tariums, rock-climbing walls, or mythological design schemes. Expect to
spend your days exploring the ports and then getting together in the
various lounges at night to talk and relax in a quiet environment. Long
and low, both vessels seem a lot larger than they really are. Cabins are
adequate if small; cabin showers are downright tiny.
Another pair of sister ships, the Armonia and Sinfonia, are almost
identical to Lirica and Opera, having been designed and built by the
same French shipyard. Both from a distance and while on board, you
can hardly tell the difference between them.
MSC’s so-called “classic fleet” is made up of vessels that have been
around for a while, and are mostly marketed to Europeans. Fans of clas-
sic liners may enjoy them, though. The Melody is most familiar to
American audiences, having sailed for years as the Big Red Boat

164

Atlantica for now-defunct Premier Cruises. The Rhapsody sailed as
Cunard’s Cunard Princess until 1995. The Monterey is by far the oldest
ship in the fleet, having launched in 1952 and gone through several
owners before landing with MSC in the early 1990s.
MSC has two new 2,550-passenger megaships currently on order, one
(named Musica) for delivery in June 2006, the second in 2007. Table 11-12
shows the current fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships and modern midsize ships
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) moved into the megaship age in 1999 with
Norwegian Sky. Since it was bought by Star Cruises of Malaysia in 2000,
NLC has transformed into one of the most innovative players in the
cruise biz. Along with a seemingly never-ending stream of ever-larger
megaships, NCL has been shaking up the industry with several major ini-
tiatives. The “Freestyle Cruising” concept broke with cruise ship tradition
to offer a more casual experience, with open-seating, restaurant-style
dining, and a resort-casual dress code (though an occasional optional
formal night is thrown in for good measure). The idea was to shake off
the stuffiness of traditional cruising and make the experience more like a
land-based resort vacation. The experiment worked, because stuffy it
ain’t: For proof, look no further than Norwegian Dawn’s salsa bands and
the bright paintings that adorn the white hulls of the line’s newer vessels.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 165

The Freestyle concept extends all the way through your cruise. For
example, if you’re not in a hurry to leave on the last day, the ships offer
Freestyle debarkation, giving you time to have a leisurely breakfast and
disembark up until about 10 a.m., rather than hustling off early as most
lines require you to do.
NCL also innovated with its “Homeland Cruising” concept, berthing ves-
sels in homeports up and down the U.S. seaboards and thus letting more
people drive to their ship rather than fly. In maybe its biggest innovation,
the line reversed a decades-long trend in the U.S. cruise industry by actu-
ally registering and staffing some of its ships in the United States, a move
that brought considerable additional costs (U.S. taxes and payrolls are
higher than those overseas), but also made them the only large cruise
ships in compliance with U.S. cabotage laws, which forbid foreign-flagged
and -staffed ships from sailing itineraries composed solely of U.S. ports.
What’s that mean in English? It means NCL’s Pride of Aloha (see Figure
11-7) and Pride of America are the only ships — period — that can offer
all-Hawaii itineraries from a homeport in Honolulu. Anyone else who sails
Hawaii has to either set off from a Mexican homeport or include the
islands on a longer cruise that also visits foreign ports, options that each
entail many days at sea.
Fleetwide, NCL’s onboard atmosphere is informal, upbeat, and well suited
to casual types, party-makers, and first-time cruisers. The line attracts a
lot of passengers under 50 (slightly older in Europe) and a good many
families with kids, especially during summers and holidays. Passengers
in general are price-conscious and more active than those aboard lines
such as Holland America, Celebrity, and Princess. Table 11-13 shows
NCL’s itineraries and sample fares.
Dining
Know how, on dry land, there are those little restaurants with only a few
tables and a short menu that is just to die for? While down the road are
those huge gilded-palace restaurants with a menu that goes on forever,
but where the food is more average? NCL’s dining experience is more
like the latter. We’re not saying it’s bad; it just isn’t gourmet. It’s main-
stream — just fine, and sometimes very good. The French and
Continental food at the Le Bistro specialty restaurant? Yum. Those
Indian spreads they sometimes put out in the buffet? Double-yum.
You sure can’t fault them for offering options, though: The newest ships
have ten different restaurants on board, including Italian, Asian, sushi,
French, steakhouse, and Tex-Mex, plus snack and sandwich options, ice-
cream parlors, and an occasional chocoholic buffet.
On the newest NCL ship, the Pride of America, you can dine at the two
main restaurants (the Art-Deco Skyline Restaurant and the Liberty
Restaurant, which looks like an old-time political rally), or choose
among several intimate, extra-cost dinner options: the Lazy J Texas
Steakhouse, where waiters serve in cowboy hats; Jefferson’s Bistro, an

elegant venue modeled after the third president’s Monticello home and
serving French cuisine; and East Meets West, a pan-Asian restaurant
with attached sushi/sashimi bar and teppanyaki room. Late at night, the
Cadillac Diner serves burgers, shakes, and other diner fare 24 hours.
All the restaurants on all NCL ships follow an open-seating policy each
and every evening, allowing you to dine whenever you like within the
5:30 to 10 p.m. window, dressed however you like (within limits), and sit-
ting with whomever you want rather than having a table preassigned.
The night of the captain’s cocktail party is officially an “optional formal”
night, giving folks who like to dress up a chance to shine. If you prefer,
you can just don the slacks and polo, of course. Your choice.
As aboard most lines, the smaller, finer restaurants carry a cover charge
that ranges from $12 to $20 per person. Dining service is about what you
find on the other mainstream lines — generally good, with occasional
lapses. But service is consistently speedy and efficient in the cabin-
service, room-service, and bar departments.
Activities and entertainment
High-energy folks, take note: You always have something to do aboard
NCL’s activity-packed ships. You can take dance lessons; sit in on a cook-
ing demo, beauty seminar, or talent show; play bingo, shuffleboard, or
basketball; attend an art auction or wine tasting (the latter for $10 per
person); and on some cruises, sit in on enrichment lectures. In Hawaii,
Pride of Aloha and Pride of America offer activities with a Hawaiian arts
and culture theme, such as hula lessons and Hawaiian bead-making.
All the ships feature spas offering Eastern- and Western-influenced treat-
ments, with the spa facilities on the newest ships really standing out in
the style department. All the vessels also offer sports bars with ESPN

coverage of games, and extensive sports and fitness facilities, including
full-size basketball courts. Gyms fleetwide are open 24 hours.
Onboard entertainment includes excellent (and surprisingly inventive)
Vegas-style musical productions, some themed on Indian Bollywood
musicals or Miami Latin culture. Smaller acts are also outstanding, from
the always-awesome singer Jane L. Powell (an NCL regular) and her excel-
lent accompanying band to talented piano players and comedians. On
Dawn, each cruise features improv comedy nights with members of the
famed Second City comedy troupe, whose alumni include Bill Murray,
Mike Myers, John Belushi, and Gilda Radner. On the Hawaii ships, one
night a week is devoted to Polynesian music and dance. Name perform-
ers are also occasionally aboard for short stints.
Other entertainment options include a “Star Seeker” show that’s like
American Idol at sea, plus tucked-away lounges for more intimate enter-
tainment, including pianists and cabaret acts. Music for dancing is popu-
lar aboard all the ships and takes place before or after shows, and each
ship has a late-night disco.
Gamblers take note: Because of Hawaiian law, Pride of Aloha and Pride of
America do not have casinos aboard, nor any kind of gambling.
For kids
NCL’s Kids Crew program offers year-round supervised activities for kids
2 to 17, divided into four age groups. Activities for younger kids include
treasure hunts, face painting, magic shows, arts and crafts, sports com-
petitions, dances, and cooking classes. Each ship has a playroom, but
those on the newer Dawn, Star, Spirit, Sun, and Pride of America are the
best by far, huge spaces that also include a separate teen center and a
wading pool. Dawn, Star, and Jewel have wonderful spaces with huge
climbing mazes and two ball bins, plus a kids pool and hot tub outside.
Group babysitting for ages 2 to 12 is offered nightly, for a fee. Private
babysitting is not available.
Kids under age 2 travel free.

Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 169

Fleet facts
NCL’s fleet divides pretty nicely into three groups: the U.S.-flagged NCL
America ships, the foreign-flagged megaships, and the 1980s- and 1990s-
vintage midsize ships.
The NCL America fleet has two ships, going on three. Pride of Aloha
was originally born as NCL’s first megaship, Norwegian Sky. In 2001, she
went in for a top-to-toe refit that turned her into the first of the line’s all-
Hawaii, all-the-time ships. Interiors were Hawaiianized with bright floral
colors, Hawaiian artwork, charming Hawaiian souvenir items from the
1950s, and other references to Hawaiian culture and history, from
orchids to outrigger canoes, beaches, fish, waterfalls, colonial planta-
tions, surfing, and famous figures who traveled there. Few traces of
Norwegian Sky remain except (unfortunately) for her tiny cabins. Oh,
well. Otherwise she’s great.
Pride of America is as all-American as her name, with an all-U.S. crew
and decorative motifs that range from the Great Seal of the United States
(on the marble floor of the Capitol Atrium reception area) to huge
photos of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, the Golden Gate Bridge,
the Chicago Skyline, and other American landmarks. Cabins tend to be
on the small side. Insides are only 132 square feet, while standard out-
sides (without balconies) max out at 144. Storage space is limited, but
bathrooms are adequately sized. Another Hawaii ship, Pride of Hawai’i,
is scheduled to launch in summer 2006.
NCL’s other megaships, the foreign-flagged Norwegian Spirit, Norwegian
Star, Norwegian Dawn, and Norwegian Jewel, are real knockouts, offer-
ing between eight and ten different restaurants apiece, elegant spaces
such as Gatsby’s Champagne Bar (on Dawn); fun ones like an outdoor Bier
Garten (on Spirit and Star); large, fanciful observation lounge/discos; great
spas; huge and completely kid-centric playrooms; and Kid’s Cafés in the
buffet restaurants (complete with tiny chairs and a miniature buffet
counter). Norwegian Spirit is slightly smaller than her sisters and has a
slightly different layout. Two sister ships of Norwegian Jewel are sched-
uled to debut in 2007.
Norwegian Sun was NCL’s second megaship after Norwegian Sky, and
blazed the trail that the later ships followed, with 9 restaurants, 12 bars,
and everything designed with casual cruising in mind.
Norwegian Crown, Norwegian Majesty, and sister ships Norwegian
Dream and Norwegian Wind are from the late ’80s and early ’90s. The
clock’s ticking on them, with plans in place to transfer them to NCL’s
Asian parent company, Star Cruises. They’re not the most modern kids
on the block, and they have some pretty small cabins, but they do have
their charming spots. Dream and Wind, for example, have these totally
great sports bars, with booths and giant-screen TVs. They look like you
should drive up to them in your old Chevy Nova. Table 11-14 shows the
current fleet specifications.

cruises.com
 Type of cruise: Premium, country-club casual, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Mini-midsize, low-key casual
Oceania stands out with its calm, casual onboard atmosphere, superb
dining, and long, interesting itineraries. All three of its ships sport a
lovely sort of British hotel look: very traditional in their public areas and
comfy in the cabins, with little or no glitz. On board, the vibe is floating
country club: totally low-key, with few organized activities, small-scale
entertainment, an always-casual dress code, and outrageously comfort-
able cabin beds. Despite such luxe-travel touches, you can still get
Oceania’s cruises on the cheap, at prices that are frequently in the same
ballpark as the mainstream lines. Combine those low prices with the
ships’ smallish size and overall quality and you have a cruise line that
doesn’t fit comfortably in any of the regular cruise niches. Maybe the
closest we can come is to say it’s like a younger, less polished version of
luxe line Radisson Seven Seas.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 171

On board, service balances precision with friendliness, and is close to
the kind of understated professionalism you see on the real luxury lines.
Because of the relatively small number of passengers, it’s also more per-
sonal than you find aboard the megaships. Stewards greet you by name,
and bartenders remember your favorite drink after the first day.
Because of the relative length of Oceania’s itineraries (mostly 12 and 14
days), and maybe because of the low-key atmosphere, passengers tend to
be older and want a quiet vessel where they can entertain themselves,
enjoy the ports, and linger over dinner. Couples in their mid-40s and up
who want that kind of experience wouldn’t be out of place on board, but
party types would, as would kids — this isn’t a line tailored to families. It’s
also not a line tailored to smokers, with smoking prohibited everywhere
but in two small patches of the Pool Deck and the nightclub. Table 11-15
shows Oceania’s itineraries and sample fares.
Oceania offers frequent two-for-one deals and often bundles airfare into
their rates. Check out the line’s Web site for details.
Dining
Dining is one of Oceania’s best features, with menus created by
renowned chef Jacques Pepin, four dinner venues with reliably enjoy-
able atmosphere and flavor, and an always casual, dress-as-you-want,
dine-when-you-want (within a three-hour window) format.
The Grand Dining Room, the main restaurant on each ship, serves five-
course, French-inspired meals, with tables for two, four, and more, and a
string quartet provides music at dinner. Main courses may include faves
such as lobster tail butterfly or beef Wellington, or surprises such as
sautéed sea bream filet and pheasant breast ballotine stuffed with morel
mushrooms. In each ship’s stern are two alternative restaurants:
Toscana for Mediterranean-style cuisine and the Polo Grill for steak-
house fare. Both offer décor and ambience appropriate to their menus,
as well as great views of the ship’s wake — very beautiful at sunset. The
same can be said, only more so, for the Terrace Cafe. During the day it’s
just an outdoor seating area for the indoor buffet, but at night its tables
are set with linens and hurricane-lamp candles. Regional Spanish and
Mediterranean specialties are the fare, along with other ethnic dishes
and home-style favorites.
Activities and entertainment
Don’t book this line looking for a lot of guided play, though the ships do
program a light menu of enrichment lectures (often themed around the
sailing region), fitness and computer classes, karaoke, health and beauty
seminars led by the spa and salon staff, plus games such as bingo and
shuffleboard. The casino is nicely sized for this ship and has slots, black-
jack, and roulette. Spa services (all the usual) and fitness equipment
(plenty of variety and quantity to go with a good schedule of organized
fitness programs) are available in nice rooms, with the outside spa pool
and seating area providing a nice touch.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
172

On the entertainment front, the line can boast really good music, with a
12-piece jazz band performing afternoons and evenings and quality
pianists playing standards in the martini bar before dinner. Other enter-
tainment includes low-key shows in the main lounge: classical pianists,
magicians, and sometimes music and dance performances by local
groups brought aboard for the evening.
For kids
There are no special kids’ facilities on these ships, since there are rarely
any kids aboard.

Fleet facts
Oceania lucked out with its ships. All three were built for now-defunct
Renaissance Cruise — Regatta (see Figure 11-8) and Insignia in 1998,
Nautica in 2000 — and were still almost brand-new when Oceania got
hold of them not long after. A bit of refurbishment got them up to speed
for the kind of cruises the new line planned to offer. These are comfort-
able and spacious ships decorated mostly in warm, dark woods and rich
fabrics. They’re traditional and sedate, with an emphasis on intimate
spaces rather than the grand, splashy ones on most megaships.
Décor throughout stresses dark wood-grain paneling, fluted columns,
ornate faux-iron railings, gilt-framed paintings, Oriental-style carpets,
and deep-hued upholstery. In the bow, the spacious, woody Horizons
lounge has floor-to-ceiling windows and brass telescopes. It’s used for
dancing in the evening and for high tea and other functions in the after-
noon. Evening entertainment is presented in a club-style 345-seat show
lounge with lots of comfy tables for four. A smallish but comfortable
casino offers blackjack, poker tables, roulette, and slots, while the next-
door Martini Bar is probably our favorite space on board, with a gentle-
men’s-club décor, a long martini menu, and jazz and standards in the
evening. The ships’ libraries are some of the loveliest at sea, with comfy
seating, excellent lighting, a faux garden skylight, and marble fireplace.
Cabins are straightforward spaces with a hint of modern European hotel:
plain off-white walls, dark wood trim and furniture, and rich carpeting.
Of the 342 staterooms, 280 are essentially the same size (150–165 sq. ft.),
and of those, 170 have balconies. Bathrooms are small, though they pro-
vide enough shelf and counter space, plus adequate amenities. Table
11-16 shows the current fleet specifications.
The best thing about the cabins are the beds, which Oceania calls
“Tranquility Beds” for good reason. Each is delightfully firm and fitted
with 350-thread-count Egyptian linens, a plush comforter/silk-cut duvet,
and probably the best fluffy down pillows we’ve ever used. We’d love to
get hold of a couple. Wonder if they’ll fit in our suitcases?

 Type of cruise: Family, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, stylish megaships with a couple of small-
ish and midsize, traditional-style ships as well
This line gets an A for its all-around appeal. More mellow than a Carnival
or Royal Caribbean cruise, you’re likely to find more action than on
Holland America. The line has great family facilities, yet you won’t find
a thousand kids aboard like on some other lines. Princess straddles a
middle ground in just about everything it does, and it works just fine for
many people. You can chill out with a book in the library, join a bridge
tournament, or head for the Pool Deck or disco for more action. You can
even play miniature golf aboard many ships or take a spin in the pottery-
making studio. The line excels in the dining department too, with many
options and flexible timings. Though Princess has some of the industry’s
largest ships, they’ve been designed well so that passengers are spread
out and the vessels rarely feel as large as they really are (for example,
the line favors multiple one-story dining rooms as opposed to giant two-
and three-story affairs).
Whether you’re old enough to have actually watched The Love Boat in the
’70s and ’80s, or have just seen reruns, you may know that the vessels
used in the series were Princess’s Pacific Princess and Island Princess. To
this day, Gavin “Captain Stubing” MacLeod acts as occasional pitchman
for the line. The twin 640-passenger vessels, however, left the fleet in 1999
and 2002, respectively, though their names have since been assigned to
new vessels. Lusty history or not, don’t expect the Princess ships of today
to be havens for swingin’ singles (you can’t believe everything you see on
TV). They tend to attract, couples, families, and a large number of seniors.
The more you cruise, the more you get. The line’s Captain’s Circle loy-
alty program issues specially colored onboard keycards and cabin-door
nameplates to past cruisers (gold after taking 1 to 5 cruises, platinum
after 5, and elite after 15), so staffers know to be extra helpful. Platinum
Captain’s Circle members also get expedited embarkation and free
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 175

Internet access throughout their cruise. Elite members receive free laun-
dry and dry-cleaning services, a complimentary wine-tasting class, 10
percent off in the onboard gift shops, and more.
Though the line offers worldwide itineraries, Princess (along with
Holland America) has been particularly strong in Alaska for decades.
Through its affiliate, Princess Tours, it offers more than 40 different
cruisetour itineraries in conjunction with its Gulf of Alaska and Inside
Passage voyages, visiting Denali National Park, Fairbanks, the Kenai
Peninsula, Wrangell–St. Elias National Park, Canada’s Yukon Territory,
and distant Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s north coast. Guests on land tours
stay in five Princess-owned wilderness lodges and travel via motor
coach and the line’s domed Midnight Express train cars. Table 11-17
shows more Princess itineraries, as well as sample fares.
Dining
The food is typically tasty, but hardly memorable; what registers is the
dining system. The line’s Personal Choice Dining program allows passen-
gers two options: dining at a set time with set dining companions in one
of the ship’s two or three main restaurants, or just wandering in at any
time during a 41⁄2-hour window to be seated by the maitre d’. No matter
how you choose to dine, you can always find healthy choices, vegetarian
options, and a kids’ menu.
If you’re not sure which option you may prefer once you’re on board,
sign up for traditional, because it’s easier to switch to anytime dining
than it is to go the other way ’round.
The Diamond Princess and Sapphire Princess offer an even more flexible
set-up than the rest of the ships. Each has one main 500-seat dining
room for traditional-seating guests and four smaller, 230-seat restaurants
for anytime dining, which serve a different themed cuisine.
Fleetwide, you can also find a buffet restaurant operating around the
clock (including full sit-down meals until 4 a.m.), including for dinner
daily, as well as smaller, more intimate alternative restaurants, including
an Italian trattoria and steakhouse restaurant on the Grand-class ships
as well as the Pacific and Tahitian Princess; trattoria and New
Orleans–style restaurants on Coral and Island Princess; and a steakhouse
and free sit-down pizzeria on the Sun-class ships. Diamond and Sapphire
Princess also feature the Italian trattoria, with its eight-course meals, in
addition to their Italian-themed dining rooms. The Regal offers a sit-
down pizzeria only. Prices are $20 per person at the trattoria and $15 at
the steakhouse. Reservations are recommended.
Unlike the no-dress-code dress code that’s part of Norwegian’s
“Freestyle” dining plan, Princess maintains the tradition of holding two
formal nights per week, with the other nights designated smart casual
(khakis and polo or button-down shirt are fine for men; ladies, you know
what to do).

In the snack department, aside from 24-hour room service, there’s a spe-
cialty coffee bar, a poolside grill doling out burgers and pizza, and an ice-
cream bar serving Häagen-Dazs and Princess’s house brand for a charge
(the bad news: no free frozen yogurt like most ships offer).
Though you can order room service and eat out on your balcony any
time you choose, if you want to be served by a waiter and eat something
more interesting than a turkey sandwich or some pizza, just cough up
$50 per person and bon appetite! Offered on the Grand-class ships, you
can have a table set up on your balcony with a tablecloth, hurricane
candle lamp, and champagne. While the waiter is setting everything up,
you and your better half can have a complimentary cocktail in one of the

ship’s bars. On all the ships, you can order a fancy breakfast served on
the balcony for $25 per couple.
Activities and entertainment
You’ve got no excuse for being bored, that’s for sure. A wide variety of
activities include miniature golf, virtual golf, and basketball/volleyball, all
available on the Grand-class ships and the Coral, Island, Diamond, and
Sapphire Princess. The Grand-class ships have gigantic virtual/video game
rooms, while the Caribbean and Grand Princess (see Figure 11-9) have
giant LED movie screens on deck showing movies, sporting events, and
other popular shows. Plus, aside from standards such as bingo, dancing
lessons, and poolside bellyflop contests, in the Caribbean, guests can
earn PADI scuba-diving certification while on board. A fleetwide enrich-
ment program, called ScholarShip@Sea, offers classes in cooking, com-
puter skills, finance, photography, and pottery making. Large-group
seminars are free, while small-group and individual classes, unfortu-
nately, carry a charge of around $20 to $25 per person. Charges for paint-
your-own ceramics are calculated based on the piece you create. When it
comes to evening entertainment, the choices include the standard Vegas-
style song and dance revues, plus comedy routines, live music, and more
innovative stuff such as the American Idol–style “Princess Idol” competi-
tion that gives Princess passengers their moment in the spotlight.
In Alaska, rangers, naturalists, and guest lecturers present talks and
slide shows on such topics as the Iditarod sled-dog race, the wildlife and
ecology of Glacier Bay and the Tongass National Forest, oceanography
and marine life, glaciers, Native Alaskan cultures, and Alaskan history.
You can book your spa appointments online before your cruise if you’re
sailing on the Caribbean Princess or Sapphire Princess — a real boon con-
sidering how long the lines can be when you have to sign up for a mas-
sage on board.
Want the big boss to tie your knot? Princess is the only line where the
captain himself conducts legal weddings aboard ship. The ceremonies
take place on Coral, Island, Diamond, and Sapphire Princess and the four
Grand-class ships, all of which have wedding chapels on board. (Other
lines have wedding chapels, too, but the captain is nowhere to be seen.)
Book yours far in advance; the captain doesn’t have time to do more
than a handful per cruise.
For kids
The line’s newest ships — the Grand-, Diamond- and Coral-class ships —
have great indoor/outdoor facilities and complimentary supervised activ-
ities, including some great educational ones, for ages 3 to 17. Group
babysitting is offered nightly at an hourly rate between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.

Fleet facts
The Grand- and Sun-class ships offer many of the cruise industry’s best
amenities — from the giant movie screens on deck of the Caribbean and
Grand Princess, to the miniature golf courses many ships have, and the
ships’ varied and flexible dining options. The medical centers on the
Grand-class ships have tele-medicine facilities that allow shipboard doc-
tors to link to land-based hospitals for consultations. Overall, décor is
pleasant, but nothing exotic; safe beiges and blues dominate, and the art
work isn’t memorable. Designed by Renzo Piano, the architect who did
the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Regal Princess is the line’s oldest and
one of its smallest ships, along with the two other Explorer-class ships,
Tahitian and Pacific Princess, which at 30,277 tons, are tiny, compared to
the rest of the fleet, and spend their time in the South Pacific.
In summer of 2006, the Crown Princess, a sister to the Caribbean Princess,
will enter service, and a third sister, Emerald Princess, is slated to debut
in spring 2007.
If you book a suite on any of the Princess ships, you get extras such as
free Internet access, dry cleaning, and laundry; complimentary corsage
and boutonniere on formal nights; and other perks, including free por-
trait sessions with the ship’s photographer or en suite afternoon tea.

 Type of cruise: Resort, family, party
 Ship size/style: Megaships, and some really huge ones at that
What kind of cruise line puts an ice-skating rink on a ship? Royal
Caribbean (RCI), and none other. In 1999, this megacruise line (number
two in the world-domination contest behind megalithic Carnival) intro-
duced the Voyager of the Seas, shown in Figure 11-10. At the time, it was by
far the largest passenger ship ever built. Four sister ships followed, and
even though they’ve since been eclipsed in the size race by one-off ocean
liner Queen Mary 2, they’re still damn big, with each offering more bells,
whistles, and innovations than some cruise lines have in their entire fleet.
To judge by their extremely successful advertising campaign (“Get Out
There!” “Lust for Life!” Yuppies on glaciers! Yuppies kayaking!), you’d
think this line was all about action, and you’d almost sorta kinda be
right. While the ads definitely have elements of ad-industry hype, RCI
really does offer a more youthful, energetic product than a lot of other
cruise lines, delivering fun, humor, a touch of class, and a bit of “feel the
burn” active excitement, all at reasonable mainstream prices.
The line is one of our top mainstream picks (especially for the Voyager-
and Radiance-class ships, which among other things have some of the
industry’s best spas), and is a top choice for both families and party
people.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 181

Passengers range from ages 30-something and up, with most hailing from
the U.S., a chunk from Canada, and a smaller chunk from elsewhere,
especially Latin America and Asia. Though they’re looking for good
times, they’re more karaoke than wet T-shirt (though shorter 3- and 4-
night cruises from Miami and Los Angeles tend to attract a more party-
ing crowd). Who wouldn’t like RCI? People who want a really upscale
experience (these are mainstream vessels, after all); people who hate
crowds (all told, their biggest ships carry more than 5,000 people,
including crew — though they’re so well designed you sometimes
wonder where all those people are); people who want a quiet cruise
experience without the distraction of a lot of programmed activities.
Royal Caribbean doesn’t accept booking from travelers under 21 unless
they’re sharing a room with an adult over 25. Exceptions are made for
young married couples and for families who book connecting cabins so
that the kids can have their own.
The ships are well run and the product consistent, with armies of well-
trained staff to keep things running efficiently — no small feat on ships
this large. Dining, bar, and cabin service is all surprisingly good given
the sheer number of passengers with whom crewmembers must deal.
Fleetwide, the décor skews toward contemporary, with some nautical
touches on the newer Radiance-class ships and some leftover chrome
and ’80s/’90s glitz on the older ships. All told, though, the RCI ships are
a lot calmer in the ornamentation department than, say, Carnival and
Costa. Many public areas are outstanding, including elaborate health
clubs, spas, relaxing Solarium pools, huge theaters and smaller show
lounges, enormous boulevard-like atriums on the Voyager ships, and the
trademark Viking Crown Lounges, which sit atop the ships like airport
control towers. While the big new vessels get all the press, RCI hasn’t
forgotten its older ships, spending millions to retrofit them with features
that were developed for the more recent vessels. Table 11-19 shows
RCI’s itineraries and sample fares.
Dining
Royal Caribbean’s cuisine falls in the “pretty tasty” to “impressively
good” range, with a lot of options (though not as many as at Norwegian)
and some pretty amazing venues. The Voyager ships’ main dining rooms
are probably the most impressive at sea — huge, three-level affairs with
enormous chandeliers and the grand feel of a European opera house.
RCI has stayed with traditional early- and late-seating dinners, with
guests dining at assigned tables. As with the other mainstream lines,
there are also many casual and specialty dining options. You can dine at
Italian specialty restaurants on the Voyager- and Radiance-class ships
and the recently refurbished Empress of the Seas (for a $20 surcharge),
or at a steakhouse on the Radiance-class ships and the Voyager-class
vessels Navigator, Mariner, and Enchantment of the Seas (also $20 per

person). The Voyager-class ships have ’50s-style Johnny Rockets diners
right out on deck, serving burgers and the like for a $3.95 per-person
service charge (plus $3.60 a pop for milkshakes). Casual breakfast,
lunch, and dinner are also available from the large buffet restaurant on
each ship.
Activities and entertainment
These ships are activity-central. Fleetwide, you can find rock-climbing
walls (with multiple climbing tracks and training available) plus lots of
typical cruise fare: dancing lessons, art auctions, bingo, shuffleboard,
spa and beauty demonstrations, wine tastings (at an elaborate wine bar
on Navigator and Mariner), oddball crafts/hospitality classes such as
napkin folding, and deck games, including “horse race” gambling and
outrageous poolside games like the men’s sexy legs contest.
Sports facilities vary by ship: ice-skating rinks and in-line skating tracks
on the Voyager-class ships; combo basketball/volleyball courts on the
Radiance-, Voyager-, and Vision-class ships; and several ships (the
Radiance and Voyager classes as well as Splendour and Legend of the
Seas) feature miniature-golf. The line’s Golf Ahoy program offers golf
shore excursions in more than two dozen ports. Shipboard gyms are
well equipped fleetwide, with specialized fitness classes such as yoga
and cardio-kickboxing available for $10 per person. The line’s spas offer
the usual range of massages, facials, and other beauty treatments.

Entertainment-wise, Royal Caribbean spends big bucks on its shows,
high-tech productions that feature singers, dancers, live bands, and fre-
quent headliners and guest artists, including aerialists, comedians, and
name performers such as the Platters and the Drifters). Atrium bars fea-
ture live music, often classical trios, and the new Latin-themed Bolero’s
bars (aboard Navigator, Mariner, Monarch, Sovereign, and Empress) serve
a mean mojito and have Latin music into the night.
Royal Caribbean is big on wedding packages, with many a vow made in
the Voyager-class ships’ wedding chapels (though you can only get mar-
ried there when the ships are in port).
For kids
Royal Caribbean offers year-round supervised kids’ programs fleetwide,
with activities for kids aged 3 to 17 (divided into four age groups). Each
ship has a kids’ playroom and facilities for teens, though the facilities on
the Voyager- and Radiance-class ships are far better than those on the
line’s older vessels, which are among the best at sea for kids. Among
other activities, several learning programs offer fun exploration of sci-
ence, art, and reading. Group babysitting for kids 3 and up is available
nightly and from noon until sailing on days the ship is in port (for a fee).
Private, in-cabin babysitting for kids 6 months and up is available from
off-duty crewmembers 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.

Fleet facts
The line’s superstars are definitely its Voyager-class ships: Voyager,
Explorer, Adventure, Navigator, and Mariner of the Seas. It’s pretty
easy to describe what they’ve got: everything. They’re the ones with the
ice-skating rinks and in-line skating tracks; the miniature golf courses
and golf simulators; the 1950s-style diner sitting right out on deck; the
regulation-size basketball courts; the huge two-level gyms and spas; the
gorgeous three-level main restaurants; the rock-climbing walls that have
become one of Royal Caribbean’s most distinguishing features; and, per-
haps most significantly, the only ships at sea with a four-story, Main
Street–like promenade running more than a football field’s length down
their center, lined with bars, shops, and entertainment lounges. Three

decks of inside cabins have bay windows from which their occupants
can view the street scene below. More than any other ship ever built,
these really do live up to the old “city at sea” cliche.
That is, at least the next generation of Voyager-class ships. The first,
dubbed Freedom of the Seas, is essentially a Voyager-plus, with all that
the older ships offer plus new features such as a sprawling water park,
full of spray cannons, water jets, gushers, and sculptural water guns set
off by sensors and other triggers; a pair of giant cantilevered hot tubs
extending 12 feet out over the edge of the ship, some 112 feet above the
sea; and a pool with views down into the ship’s main atrium. Freedom of
the Seas is set to debut in May 2006, with her first sister ship arriving in
spring 2007 and another due in early 2008.
The Radiance-class ships, Radiance, Brilliance, Serenade, and Jewel
of the Seas, are more classic than innovative in their onboard experi-
ence, while offering a lot of the fun and games of the Voyager class,
including rock climbing and miniature golf. They’re Royal Caribbean’s
most elegant vessels to date, with shippy lines and nautical interior
décor, full of dark wood paneling, caramel-brown leathers, and deep-
sea-blue fabrics and carpeting. Outside, their sleek profiles are covered
in 110,000 square feet of glass, providing views from public rooms like
the Viking Crown Lounge, the piano bar, the Champagne Bar, and other
spaces — handy for letting scenery in on Alaska itineraries.
The Vision-class ships, Vision, Splendour, Grandeur, Rhapsody,
Enchantment, and Legend of the Seas, were once paradigms on cruise
ship modernity, but were so quickly eclipsed by their giant Voyager
cousins that now they seem almost quaint. That’s not a fair comment, of
course. They’re still pretty fine ships, with an open, light-filled feel and
many of the same amenities offered by the line’s newer, larger ships,
including great solariums, pools, hoppin’ discos, and sprawling outdoor
decks. To keep them up to date, Royal Caribbean has retrofitted them all
with rock-climbing walls, and some are scheduled for major surgery. As
this book was being written, Enchantment of the Seas was literally being
sawn in half and then welded back together with a new midsection,
increasing her size and amenities substantially and adding a water park
similar to the one coming on Freedom of the Seas. The nearby Sports
Deck will include four bungee trampolines where guests strap into a har-
ness connected to bungee cords, to keep them from flying overboard.
On the downside to these ships, their standard cabins are on the small
side, a failing common to Royal Caribbean’s older vessels — including
the Sovereign-class ships, Sovereign, Majesty, and Monarch of the
Seas, which all sail inexpensive 3- and 4-night cruises on the East and
West Coasts. A decade and a half of hard use has given all three of these
vessels their share of bumps, but Royal Caribbean’s been busy scrub-
bing them up over the past two years, refurbishing and rebuilding many
of the interiors on Monarch and Sovereign.
Chapter 11: Mainstream Ships 187

The line’s oldest ship, Empress of the Seas, also got major elective sur-
gery in 2004, updating the décor of her lobbies, elevators, corridors, and
other public areas and transforming some of her lounge spaces into
additional dining, entertainment, and fitness areas. She doesn’t look half
bad, particularly for short cruises, though her cabins are small and
worn. Table 11-20 shows the current fleet specifications.

Chapter 12
Luxury Ships
In This Chapter
 Discovering how luxury cruises are different
 Comparing the luxury lines
A
cruise on a luxury ship isn’t like other cruises. Erase all images
of conga lines and buckets of beer — a luxury cruise bears little
resemblance to a giant megaship. Luxury ships are smaller. Service is
more attentive. Food tastes better. Cabins are larger and have better
amenities. Itineraries are almost always superior. The list goes on. Oh,
they cost more, too. A lot more.
The Lowdown on the High End
If all you’ve heard about cruises is that they’re glitzy floating Vegas resorts
full of napkin-folding, bingo-playing, pizza-eating, beer chuggers, well,
forget all that and start with a blank slate. The luxury ships reviewed in
this chapter are the best of the best, if best to you means eating on ele-
gant china and sipping a rare vintage from a crystal glass. If you appreci-
ate a sophisticated waiter who lifts a silver lid from your chateaubriand,
then your ship has come in. Standard cabins on a luxury ship are usually
all suites, outfitted with walk-in closets, stocked minibars, and marble
bathrooms large enough to offer a tub, shower, and double sinks. Expect
extras such as slippers, bathrobes, and fancy shampoos from the likes of
Molton Brown and Acqua di Parma.
Most of the luxury vessels are small and intimate, carrying between 100
and 700 guests. And even on the bigger luxury ships (Cunard’s QE2 and
QM2, and Crystal’s Symphony and new Serenity), you’re unlikely to feel lost
in a crowd. The vibe on a luxury ship is one of exclusivity. Passengers are
like members of a private club of experienced travelers who like the good
life and are willing to pay for it. Passengers are mostly adults over the age
of 50, although you may see some kids on the QM2 and the Crystal ships,
which have children’s facilities (most luxury lines have a minimum age
of 1 to sail).
Like their mainstream cousins, luxury ships have pools, gyms, and spas.
Dining is the best you can find at sea, and dinner is served with much

pomp and circumstance. More effort goes into the preparation of meals
and the scope goes beyond the standard pasta, salmon, and steaks you
get on the mainstream lines. On the luxe lines, a fancy afternoon tea is
a daily norm, as are complimentary pre-dinner canapés in the lounges
(which few mainstream lines offer). Entertainment and organized activi-
ties are more limited than on mainstream ships (with the exception of
Crystal and Cunard), and most guests on luxury ships like it that way.
They prefer cocktails in a piano bar after dinner and chatting about
stocks or recent travels over sweating it up in a disco or sprinting
between the casino and the X-rated comedian in a lounge.
What to wear, what to wear, what to wear? With the exception of
SeaDream Yacht Club (which has a no-jackets-required policy), it’s a
good idea to bring a tux (ladies, pack your fancy dresses) for formal
nights; people on these ships tend to dress for dinner. Other days fea-
ture a mix of informal nights, when men need to wear a jacket and tie,
and casual nights, when button-down shirts are fine for men, with or
without a jacket. Women can wear nice skirts, pants, or dresses on these
evenings. All the luxury lines also have at least one casual dining venue,
where there’s absolutely no need for a suit or jacket. Exceptions: On
Seabourn and Crystal, ties are optional on all but formal nights.
Most luxury lines (with the exception of Cunard) can accommodate two
or three passengers only per cabin (not including big suites and pent-
houses, of course). So if you’re set on bringing the kids, for example, in
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships

The little extras (really add up)
The ultraluxury ships treat passengers like royalty. Their fares are more all-inclusive,
so while you pay more, you get more, too. Here’s a list of some of the things included
in the luxury cruise rates:
 Booze: Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea (unlimited spirits, wine, and cham-
pagne); Radisson Seven Seas (wine with dinner)
 Free stocked minibar: Radisson Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea, SeaDream
(beer and soft drinks only), Crystal (top suites only), and Cunard (top suites only)
 A special shore excursion: Seabourn, SeaDream, and Silversea
 Tips: Included on Seabourn, SeaDream, Silversea, and Radisson Seven Seas
 Unlimited soda/bottled water: Crystal, Seabourn, SeaDream, Silversea, and
Radisson Seven Seas
 Watersports: Seabourn and SeaDream
 Other goodies: Godiva pillow chocolates nightly (Silversea), cotton logo pj’s
(SeaDream), CD of classic jazz (Seabourn), luggage tags and document portfolio
(Seabourn offers Tumi versions)

the standard staterooms on the SeaDream, Radisson, Seabourn, Silversea,
and Crystal ships, the third person/child sleeps on the couch or a roll-
away (if there’s space for them at all). If you’ve got a larger family, you
have to spring for two staterooms or a larger suite. As Seabourn
spokesman Bruce Good told us: “Seabourn suites are designed to accom-
modate two guests. A child can be accommodated on a couch in some
suites or we do have a couple of rollaways that can be used, but it really
compromises the experience.”
Around the World They Go
Where don’t they go should be the question. Luxury ships tend to globe-
trot and offer a more eclectic and varied itinerary schedule than the
mainstream ships we discuss in Chapter 11. They often sail from a differ-
ent homeport every week or stay in one region only long enough to offer
a few itineraries and then move on to another part of the world. Because
most luxury ships are substantially smaller than the big mainstream
ships, they can and do visit smaller, less accessible ports.
You want the world? Then you gotta pay. A typical luxury cruise will
run you about $300 to $600 per person a day, more if you book the pent-
house. Still, keep a lookout for deals, the luxury lines offer special pro-
motions, too, from free airfare to the port of embarkation to two-for-one
deals. It’s a good idea to book a luxury cruise through an agency that
specializes in them. See Chapter 4 for recommended agencies.
Crystal Cruises
2049 Century Park East, Suite 1400, Los Angeles, CA 90067; % 800-446-6620; www.
crystalcruises.com
 Type of cruise: Gourmet, luxury, resort, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, midsize luxury ship
Offering the best of both worlds, Crystal gracefully straddles the line
between active big ship and refined small one. The Crystal Symphony and
the newer Crystal Serenity (see Figure 12-1) dole out top-of-the-line serv-
ice and cuisine, plus lots of outdoor deck space, generous fitness facili-
ties, tons of activities, multiple restaurants (including the best Asian
venues at sea), bars, and entertainment venues.
Unlike Seabourn’s small ships, which tend to be more calm and staid,
this Japanese-owned, Los Angeles–based line lives by a more sociable
California ethic, and its large passenger capacity tends to keep things
mingly, chatty, and fairly active.
You’ll find both dark wood-paneled rooms and light pastel ones, along
with plenty of marble, glass, fresh flowers, and potted plants. The newer
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 191

Serenity has deeper, richer colors; the Symphony sports more of the
lighter champagnes, grays, whites, and blues, especially in the atrium,
where things are a tad on the shiny side with chrome and brassy railings.
The downside to all of this upside is that most cabins on both these
ships are quite a bit smaller than those on Silversea, Seabourn, and
Radisson. Sure, you can book a suite or penthouse that’s bigger, but the
price for sailing on a larger ship with more to do is that the standard
staterooms are on the cozy side. Table 12-1 shows Crystal’s itineraries
and sample fares.
Dining
It’s tops, especially if you love Asian food. In addition to the formal
dining room that operates with an early or late seating system, there
are alternative restaurants (Italian and Asian), plus a poolside grill, an
indoor cafe, and a casual restaurant that has a theme luncheon buffet,
such as Asian, Mediterranean, or South American/Cuban.
The line’s Asian venues are among the best at sea. Symphony’s Jade
Garden showcases the Asian cuisine of Wolfgang Puck’s acclaimed Santa
Monica restaurant, Chinois on Main. And Master Chef Nobuyuki “Nobu”
Matsuhisa, known for his restaurants in New York, Miami, L.A., London,
Paris, and other cities, partnered with Crystal to create menus for
Serenity’s Sushi Bar and its Pan-Asian restaurant Silk Road. Dishes fea-
ture Nobu’s eclectic blends of Japanese cuisine with Peruvian and
European influences. On the Serenity’s Penthouse Deck, you can even get
Nobu room service.
All menus include light and low-fat options as well as vegetarian, low-
carb, sugar-free, gluten-free, and kosher foods. Of course, 24-hour room
service is offered.
Activities and entertainment
You can find a lot to do on the Crystal ships. Entertainment runs the
gamut from classical concertos by accomplished pianists to comedy and
the classic cruise Vegas-style song and dance revues. From time to time,
celebrity entertainers, such as Carol Channing, Tommy Tune, Robert
Klein, and Marvin Hamlisch, are featured. Each ship also has lounges for
dancing to live music as well as a fairly lively casino, a dark and cozy
piano bar, a cigar bar, and a movie theater.
No other line has as much, with complimentary computer classes on
every cruise (and private ones available for an hourly fee), plus dozens
of theme sailings focused on food and wine, art, film, jazz music, well-
ness, and other subjects. There are always several enrichment lectures
on each cruise, such as a historian presenting a slide show and speaking
about the Panama Canal and how it was built, a former ambassador
speaking about regional politics, or a movie critic talking to guests about
Hollywood films.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
192

You can find group (for free) and private (for a fee) dancing and golf les-
sons, plus music lessons, language classes, and tai-chi. Both ships offer
a nice-size gym, feng-shui inspired spas, paddle-tennis courts, Ping-Pong,
a jogging circuit, golf-driving nets, and a putting green.
In a huge computer lab, a complimentary 30-course computer curricu-
lum is offered on all cruises, with topics such as a basic introduction to
using the computer, understanding the Internet, and creating spread-
sheets. Private lessons are also available for $50 an hour.

For kids
Though no Disney, Crystal does its part for families looking for a luxury
getaway. Each ship has a playroom outfitted with PlayStation video
games and personal computers among other goodies, plus there’s a teen
center and video arcade. When demand warrants it — typically during
holidays and summers in Alaska — supervised activities are run for
three age groups between 3 and 17. Private in-cabin babysitting is
offered nightly for an hourly fee for children 6 months to 12 years.
If your bambinos are still on jar food, no need to lug a suitcase full (like
Heidi has done on several occasions). With advance notice, the ship can
order what you need at no charge and have it waiting. Or, the chef will
puree organic food for your baby.
Crystal frequently offers kids-sail-free promotions, especially on its
Alaska itineraries.
Figure 12-1: Crystal Serenity
Fleet facts
Handsome ships by any standard, the Crystal Serenity and Crystal
Symphony have some of the highest space-per-passenger ratios of any
cruise ships in the industry. The two are exceedingly roomy, and the
Serenity even more so; she’s 38 percent bigger than Symphony, but car-
ries only 15 percent more guests. The Serenity boasts expanded spa and
fitness areas and more dining venues, entertainment lounges, and pent-
houses (the biggest four are each a whopping 1,345 sq. ft.). In early 2004,
the Symphony received a $12 million facelift to most areas of the ship. If
you’re lucky enough to stay in one of the penthouse suites, you’ll be
treated to the services of male butlers.
Rates include unlimited nonalcoholic drinks everywhere aboard, from
cappuccino to soda and bottled water. There’s also now a pillow menu —
what will they think up next? Table 12-2 shows current fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Luxury, elegant, classic, romantic
 Ship size/style: Megaship ocean liner
The oldest name in the cruise biz, Cunard offered the first regularly
scheduled service across the Atlantic way back in the 1840s, and today
it’s the only passenger line still doing so, aboard some of the few true
ocean liners still going. A niche market catering to nostalgists and avio-
phobes, you ask? To a point, but what’s wrong with that? In its public
persona, Cunard is all about tradition, stressing the built-tough strength
and history-minded opulence of its great ships and the old-fashioned
British formality of its onboard experience.
For the past few decades, Cunard passengers have tended to be tradi-
tionalists as well — older, well-traveled folks who appreciate the line’s
history and slightly frumpled graciousness. On transatlantic voyages,
passengers ceased being primarily British long ago (Americans are the
line’s top customers there), but with the huge launch of the huge Queen
Mary 2 (see Figure 12-2), Carnival Corp. signaled that Cunard was open
for even more new business. That ship got so much press that it’s now
once again hip to go transatlantic by water instead of plane.
QM2 provides one of the most distinctive luxury experiences you can
get, appealing to both romantic types and (surprisingly) families, espe-
cially on summer Atlantic crossings.
Queen Mary 2 (also known as QM2) replaced Cunard’s legendary Queen
Elizabeth 2 (also known as QE2, the iconic name by which it’s been known
since its 1969 launch) on the line’s transatlantic routes almost immedi-
ately after her launch. QE2 now sails from a homeport in Southampton,
UK, carrying primarily British passengers. A third queen, dubbed Queen
Victoria, is currently under construction and set to debut in 2007. At
85,000 GRTs, she’ll still be a substantial vessel, though nowhere near the
mind-boggling size of the 151,400-ton QM2.
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 195

Sail Cunard to experience an inkling of how people traveled a century
ago, with grand interiors and a sense of empirical exceptionalism — rule
Britannia, Britannia rules the waves, and all that. Sail QM2 to see the
best built and probably most technologically advanced passenger ship
in the world, to be the envy of your friends, or to just stand there and
say, “Gee, it’s big.” Sail QE2 for a real dose of history. Table 12-3 shows
Cunard’s itineraries and sample fares.
QM2’s fares frequently include airfare deals. Transatlantic crossings, for
example, come bundled with one-way return airfare, though we hear that
deal may disappear in the future. Stay tuned.
Dining
Like QE2, QM2 works on a vestigial multiclass system left over from the
ocean liner days. Back then, first-class passengers could go their whole
voyage and hardly see anyone booked in second-class or steerage.
Today, however, the separation is only noticeable in a few spots on
board. Essentially, cabin level determines where one dines: Passengers
in the top suites dine in special restaurants, while everyone else dines in
the main Britannia dining room (a gorgeous spot, far more grand than
the suite guests’ more quietly posh Queens Grill and Princess Grill) or in
one of the alternative venues — such as Todd English, a branch of
celebrity Boston chef English’s Olives restaurant.
The two grill restaurants serve dinner in a single seating, while Brittania
has early and late seatings. All three also serve breakfast and lunch in
open seatings. Food sticks close to tradition, with entrees that may
include roasted prime rib, grilled lobster with garden pea risotto, and
pheasant with haggis and port wine sauce. Health-conscious dishes
designed by Canyon Ranch Spa (which also runs QM2’s onboard spa) are
available as a matter of course. For casual dining, QM2’s King’s Court is
an enormous buffet that’s partitioned off at night to create three sepa-
rate restaurants: a grill-type carvery, an Italian restaurant, and a pan-
Asian restaurant. All are free, and reservations are recommended.
Activities and entertainment
QM2 boasts an impressive list of guest lecturers, including experts from
Oxford University, Architectural Digest, Gourmet magazine, and other
institutions and publications. Course listings for the Oxford University
lecture program (presented on the transatlantic crossings) are available
90 days ahead of each sailing on the Cunard Web site. Passengers can
also take advantage of the largest library at sea (most ship libraries are
pretty pitiful, but truly, this one rocks), as well as a maritime history trail
that snakes around the ship, an amazing spa operated by Canyon Ranch,
a Monte Carlo–style casino, and an honest-to-God planetarium, with 3-D
presentations created by New York’s Museum of Natural History and the
Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
196

Entertainment runs the gamut from plays featuring graduates of Britain’s
Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts to some pretty run-of-the-mill song-and-
dance revues. There’s also a variety of music, including jazz, classical,
and dance music of the old-fashioned and new-fashioned kind (pre-
sented in the adjoining Queen’s Ballroom and G32 disco).
For kids
Most luxury ships have little for kids, but QM2 is a major exception to
that rule, offering a program and facilities for kids as young as age 1.
There’s a nursery with ten crib/toddler-bed combos for napping tots,
playrooms and an outdoor play area, activities for several different age
groups, and a staff of real British nannies and activities counselors. The
kids’ center is open long hours, too (until midnight), so parents can take
advantage of the ship’s dining options in peace. There’s even a special
children’s tea daily from 5 to 6 p.m. in the Chef’s Galley.

Figure 12-2: Queen Mary 2
Fleet facts
Launched to tremendous fanfare in early 2004, the Queen Mary 2 was
the first true ocean liner built since Cunard minted QE2 back in 1969.
What’s that mean? It means strength, speed, and extraordinary sea-
keeping abilities — all essential ingredients to maintaining a schedule
on the sometimes brutal North Atlantic.
Inside, the ship is pretty spectacular, its public rooms impressive for
both their range and quality. Even after being aboard six days on the
Atlantic, you might still find spots you’ve never seen before. Our
favorites? The classic deco-style Chart Room for drinks before dinner;
the forward-facing Commodore Club with its clubby atmosphere; the
grand Queen’s Room ballroom on formal night; and the forward observa-
tion deck on deck 11, just below the bridge — probably the best spot
aboard when sailing out of New York Harbor, QM2’s western terminus
when sailing transatlantic. Other great spots? The spa and library, the
elegant Veuve Clicquot champagne bar, the lively Golden Lion Pub, and
the Winter Garden, a light, airy space designed to provide an outdoor
garden feel on long transatlantic voyages.
As for QE2, she sails on as indomitably as ever, touching down seemingly
everywhere. She’s no kid, having sailed more than 5.3 million nautical
miles and carried nearly 3 million passengers (as of her 36th birthday, in
2005), but she’s a real grande dame, with some gorgeous public spaces
mixed amid a charmingly old-fashioned, mazelike layout. Think more
Anne Bancroft than Catherine Zeta-Jones. Table 12-4 shows current fleet
specifications.

Radisson Seven Seas Cruises
600 Corporate Dr., Suite 410, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33334; % 800-477-7500 or 800-285-
1835; www.rssc.com
 Type of cruise: Luxury, gourmet, romantic
 Ship size/style: Midsize, modern, luxury ships
Radisson Seven Seas offers a cruise experience that’s upscale but not
uptight — homey and comfortable, with outstanding service, great 
cuisine, and itineraries that range the world, from the Alaska and the
Caribbean to Tahiti and Antarctica. Honestly upscale but without pre-
tense, it’s the perfect cruise line for people who have sailed with main-
stream or premium lines and are looking to step up.
The line appeals primarily to well-heeled passengers in their 50s and up,
with a few younger passengers and honeymooners peppering the mix.
Though the typical Radisson passenger has refined tastes, he or she also
appreciates the line’s less formal ambience, which is comfortably casual
and laid-back during the day.
The line’s ships are modern and midsized, with the twin Seven Seas
Mariner (see Figure 12-3) and Seven Seas Voyager carrying 700 passengers
apiece and Seven Seas Navigator carrying 490. Radisson also currently
charters two ships, one sailing in Tahiti and the other on occasional
Antarctica cruises.
Service is some of the best you can find in the cruise business. Restaurant
waiters are gracious and professional, cabin stewardesses deft and unob-
trusive, and room service fast and efficient. Bar staff often remembers
your drink order after the first day. Like most of the other luxury lines,
Radisson bundles gratuities into the cruise fare. Table 12-5 shows
Radisson’s itineraries and sample fares.
For all that it offers, Radisson’s rates are often surprisingly low, with
good early-booking discounts, two-for-one deals, and free or discounted
airfare almost always available.
Dining
Radisson’s cuisine is superb, complemented by complimentary red and
white house wines. Main dining room and alternative restaurants operate
on an open-seating basis — sit where you want, when you want (though
the alternative restaurants require that you make reservations). In the
main restaurants, meals are elaborate and elegant, with main entrees that
may include dishes such as zucchini-wrapped chicken breast stuffed with
olives and tomatoes, herb-crusted roast leg of lamb, and fresh fish.
Aboard Seven Seas Mariner and Voyager, passengers have the choice of
three alternative restaurants: the 110-seat Signatures, directed by chefs

from Paris’s famed Le Cordon Bleu cooking school; Latitudes, serving
pan-Asian “Indochine cuisine”; and La Veranda, serving Mediterranean
and North African dishes in a casual setting. Seven Seas Navigator’s
single alternative is Portofino, an indoor/outdoor Italian restaurant.
Activities and entertainment
As aboard almost all the luxury ships, entertainment and activities are
limited and low-key, with passengers preferring to enjoy their vacation at
their own pace. Offerings do include lectures by former diplomats, writ-
ers, anthropologists, and naturalists, often speaking on a topic relevant
to the region you’re sailing — for example, Colonial America on New
England/Canada cruises. You can also take dance lessons; attend a wine
tasting or art auction; play cards, bingo, or bridge (with instructors sailing
on all cruises); or take a computer class (aboard Mariner and Voyager).
The line also offers great spas, run by French company Carita of Paris
and staffed by therapists and hairdressers imported from Parisian salons.
As of mid-2005, Radisson has introduced a fleetwide program of science-
related activities created by oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau.
Cousteau himself presents talks, lectures, and shore excursions on
select cruises; on others, experts from his Ocean Futures Society lead
informal workshops and discussions on marine life and undersea habi-
tats. Passengers may watch their dives via live TV uplinks. On other
cruises, Radisson offers a series of cooking workshops led by chefs
trained in the Le Cordon Bleu cooking method. The cost for the full
workshop series is $395 per person.
Most evening entertainment is low-key, as aboard most luxury ships. You
can choose from musical revues in the show lounges, music in other

public rooms, and occasional performances from local entertainers who
come aboard to perform. A headline entertainer (usually a soloist or
comedian) sails with each cruise. Radisson also programs occasional
themed sailings — a Doo-Wop cruise featuring The Platters, for example,
or a “Spotlight on Classical Music” cruise.
For kids
Like the other luxury lines, Radisson, in general, isn’t geared toward chil-
dren, though summer Alaska and Bermuda sailings (and select holiday
cruises) do offer a kids program for kids 6 to 17, divided into two age
groups. On other cruises, an ad-hoc kids program is put together if
enough kids are aboard to require it. Private babysitting may be
arranged (for a fee) with off-duty crewmembers.
Figure 12-3: Seven Seas Mariner
Fleet facts
The all-suite Seven Seas Mariner was the first vessel built by any line to
offer a private balcony in every stateroom. She was also designed to be
super-spacious, with a higher passenger-space ratio (the amount of inte-
rior space per passenger, mathematically speaking) than any cruise
vessel besides Silversea’s Silver Shadow and Silver Whisper — and she
ain’t that far behind them. Sister ship Seven Seas Voyager is very nearly
as spacious, trading a few square feet for an improved layout of public
rooms. Improved also are the stateroom bathrooms, which are among
the roomiest and most comfortable on any cruise ship today. The
same bathrooms actually debuted with Radisson aboard Seven Seas
Navigator. Smaller than her two newer fleetmates, she has attractive
public spaces and all-suite, all-outside accommodations, 90 percent of
them with private balconies.
The small, beautifully appointed Paul Gauguin was built to sail around
Tahiti year-round, and is under a charter contract to Radisson through
January 2007. Radisson also charters an expedition ship called Explorer
II (previously Minerva) for annual January sailings in Antarctica. Table
12-6 shows current fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Gourmet, luxury, romantic
 Ship size/style: Small luxury ships
Calling itself The Yachts of Seabourn, this line makes the most of its
ships’ small and intimate size. Peers Silversea and Radisson may have
newer ships, but they’re larger. With 157 crewmembers to just 208
guests, service is very personal; staff members greet you by name from
the moment you check in. They indulge guests with special little extras
such as free mini-massages on deck and soothing Eucalyptus oil baths
drawn in suites upon request.
The ships’ small size also allows guests to mingle easily with each other
and crew, and enjoy mellow pursuits such as trivia games and presenta-
tions by guest lecturers. The petite ships are able to visit less-touristed
ports that larger ships may not be able to access, and the wealthy, well-
traveled clientele likes that exclusivity. Many have traveled with
Seabourn before, and they come back again and again for the excellent
food, wine, and the overall genteel surroundings.
The line’s roots are Norwegian: The captains are Norwegian, you may
find your suite minibar stocked with bottles of Norwegian Ringnes 
pilsner, and there’s no denying the ships’ décor is very Scandinavian,
with its cool, almost icy sea of pastels.
The cruise fare includes tips, wine and spirits, and one special shore
excursion (such as a private visit to a museum after hours). Table 12-7
shows Seabourn’s itineraries and sample fares.
Single travelers can get run-of-the-ship discounts, whereby Seabourn

Dining
Celebrity restaurateur Charlie Palmer, of New York’s Aureole fame, is
behind the ships’ menus, with the ships’ chefs training in Palmer’s
shoreside restaurants. Needless to say, cuisine in each ship’s two restau-
rants is a highlight of a Seabourn cruise. Even the breakfast buffets are
exceptional. The best setting may be the outside decks of the Veranda
Café, with the churning wake shushing just below you. This venue also
has indoor seating, and breakfast and lunch are offered in a combination
of buffet and table-service. Every evening, a theme menu is offered.
Reservations are required and don’t forget to request a table outdoors
if that’s your desire.
The ships have one main dining room with open seating for all meals.
This is the more formal of each ship’s two dining venues and service is as
good as it gets on the high seas: attentive, unobtrusive, and professional.
Aside from a vegetarian selection and a lighter choice on all menus, if
you’ve got ideas of your own, just ask. If the chef has the ingredients on
board, your wishes will be met. On formal nights in the Restaurant, tuxes
and sequins are the uniform of choice, while you can get away with a
jacket (and no tie) in the Veranda Café.
One night on each warm-weather itinerary there is an over-the-top buffet
dinner served out on deck by the pool and a silver-service beach barbe-
cue in remote ports — we’re talking china and linen, and, of course,
champagne and caviar. The 24-hour room service includes the option of

Feeling indulgent? Jumbo shrimp and caviar can be ordered poolside, or
anywhere else for that matter, at no charge.
Activities and entertainment
The Seabourn ships are sociable because of their small size, but don’t
offer too much in the way of organized activities and entertainment.
That’s how the guests like it. By day, there are trivia contests, galley
tours, computer classes, wine tastings, and the ever-popular Liar’s Club.
At least one and often two guest lecturers per cruise discuss upcoming
ports as well as other random topics. Noted chefs, scientists, historians,
authors, or statesmen may be aboard, or maybe a wine connoisseur,
composer, anthropologist, TV director, or professor, presenting lectures
and mingling with guests. From time to time, the line brings aboard
celebrities; past guests have included actor Alan Arkin, journalist
Bernard Kalb, Jeopardy host Alex Trebek, and author Paul Theroux.
Each ship has two roomy entertainment lounges where a cabaret singer,
solo instrumentalist, quartet, or maybe a comedian performs. Before
dinner, a pianist plays and sings for guests enjoying cocktails in The
Club; adjacent is the tiny casino with a handful of card tables and slots.
The Seabourn Legend (see Figure 12-4), Pride, and Spirit each have a teak-
decked platform hidden in their hulls that, when lowered, provides a
launching point for water sports. Sunfish sailboats, kayaks, snorkeling
gear, high-speed banana boats, and water skis are available for use.
For kids
These ships are geared to adults and there are no special programs for
kids (bring your nanny). In a pinch, you may be able to negotiate private
in-suite babysitting with an off-duty crewmember.
Figure 12-4: Seabourn Legend
Fleet facts
All the cabins on the Legend, Pride, and Spirit are suites with either 5-
foot-wide picture windows or sliding glass doors with railings offering

sea views and breezes (only the top six Owner’s Suites have proper bal-
conies). All suites also have new Bose Wave radio/CD players (a library
of music and book CDs is available on board) and flat-panel TVs and
DVD players (to be added to the suites by early 2006). Each also has a
complimentary bar set-up, walk-in closet, and marble bathroom.
Though not exactly spring chickens in the youth-obsessed cruise indus-
try, Seabourn has kept up appearances with the occasional nip and tuck.
Sliding glass doors were added to 36 suites on each ship a few years
back, for example, and the gyms were increased in size in 2003 to make
room for classes such as yoga and Pilates. Table 12-8 shows current fleet
specifications.

www.seadreamyachtclub.com
 Type of Cruise: Luxury (country club chic), romantic
 Ship size/style: Small, yacht-like
Size does matter. And in the case of the two ships from SeaDream Yacht
Club, SeaDream I and SeaDream II (shown in Figure 12-5), smaller is
decidedly better. These ships are exclusive and yachty — you’ll find lots
of hardwood floors, Oriental carpets, and exotic floral arrangements —
and also offer some cool stuff to do for those active 40- to 60-somethings
attracted to SeaDream’s version of the good life, which promises “an
extraordinary, ultra-luxury, mega-yachting experience not currently
available.” With each ship carrying 110 guests in 55 suites (with 89
crewmembers at your beck and call), these small ships offer a really inti-
mate, personalized trip. Excellent service and fine dining are the big
draws, along with a “yacht casual” dress code (no jackets are required,
though some wear them). Table 12-9 shows SeaDream’s itineraries and
sample fares.
At only 344 feet long, these twins can slip into ports that other ships
couldn’t even hope to, including docking curbside in places such as
Monte Carlo. The ships were built in the 1980s, and the space ratio is
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 207

smallish by today’s standards. Cruisers don’t have tons of inside public
space, but SeaDream refitted the ships to provide plenty of excellent
outside space, with such touches as queen-size Sun Beds.
SeaDream offers occasional special promotions, such as save 25 percent
when booking two or three consecutive sailings. They also do “Sail with
Friends” promotions, where you buy four staterooms and get a fifth one
free, or you buy two to four cabins and get a percentage off each one.
Dining
The vibe on board may be casual and carefree, but the food and wine are
seriously good. Open-seating dining is offered from 7:30 to 10 p.m. in the
main restaurant on deck 2, though it’s not always easy to snag a table for
two. For something more interesting, you can venture “out” for dinner

by requesting a spot in advance at one of several private alcoves on
deck 6, or even on the bridge. The partially covered, open-sided Topside
Restaurant on deck 5 serves breakfast and lunch daily, with guests
choosing from a buffet or menu. Menus include a healthy option as well
as a vegetarian entree, and the galley will prepare special requests pro-
vided that the ingredients are on board.
Lavish beach barbecues, called the Caviar and Champagne Splash, are
offered on Jost Van Dyke and Virgin Gorda. Sit back and enjoy the show
as 20-something European stewards in Hawaiian shirts hop into the surf
from a zodiac boat carrying a life preserver that doubles as a floating
serving tray for an open tin of sevruga Malossol caviar. Two stewards
perform ceremonial running front flips into the surf with champagne bot-
tles in hand, and then pop off the corks in unison. Ta daaaaa! This, plus
grilled lobster tails and barbecued spare ribs on the beach, and lots
more. The feast is served under umbrellas at tables set with proper
china and hotel silver brought ashore by the staff.
Aside from 24-hour room service, there are sandwiches and snacks at
the Topside restaurant throughout the day and/or poolside. Rates
include unlimited spirits, wine and soft drinks, though, oddly, cabin
minifridges are stocked only with complimentary beer and soft drinks.
Activities and entertainment
Like real yachts, you are meant to spend your SeaDream days up on the
open decks or exploring port. Itineraries are designed so that ships stay
overnight in three-quarters of the ports they visit (such as St. Barts and
St. Tropez). SeaDream’s rationale? “There’s no sense in leaving a port at
5 if it doesn’t start really happening till 11.” And the ship’s crew is more
than happy to get in on the action. Crewmembers, and sometimes even
the captain, lead free personalized excursions in port. Join the captain
on a kayaking or snorkeling jaunt to a quiet Virgin Gorda cove, meet up
with the chef to scout for local produce, or follow the bartender for a
night out to a local watering hole.
By day, most people who remain aboard are tanning or canoodling on a
cushy Sun Bed poolside, drink in hand — the setting is totally romantic.
Some spend time in the gym or Asian-influence spa. There’s also a small
library, and staterooms keep couch potatoes content with DVD and CD
players, flat-screen TVs, and Internet accessibility (which you can also
find in the library).
Tunes are served up nightly on a white glass-topped Yamaha in the
piano bar. Several nights a week in the main salon, a cabaret singer with
digitized accompaniment keeps things hopping (relatively) for listeners
and dancers. On a few cruises in the Caribbean, local bands are brought
on for the night. And for private tunes, you can borrow an MP3 player
loaded with music from the reception desk.
Chapter 12: Luxury Ships 209

Some guests have a nightly date with the small casino on deck 4,
while many others prefer to hang out at the Top of the Yacht Bar for
before- and after-dinner drinks. On one evening during each cruise, a
screen is set up on deck for a movie under the stars, which passengers
can view from poolside (or even from the pool).
The ships carry aboard sea kayaks, Sunfish, and WaveRunners that can
be accessed from each ship’s watersports marina when docked in calm
seas. There are also mountain bikes, a golf simulator, and Segway Human
Transporters (they’re upright two-wheel Jetsons-like scooters that you
can use in port for $49 an hour).
For kids
Like the other small luxury ships, these are not geared to kids. There are
no babysitting services or child-related activities (if you’ve got young
kids and can’t resist trying SeaDream, bring a nanny, like Heidi did).
Teens, on the other hand, may enjoy the cruises’ emphasis on water-
sports and unstructured activities.
Figure 12-5: SeaDream II
Fleet facts
Standard cabins on the SeaDream I and II measure 195 square feet, just
a tad larger than Carnival’s standard cabins (though, of course, much
more plush). Sixteen are convertible to a double-sized room — called a
Commodore Club Stateroom — by booking two connecting rooms
(essentially creating a suite with two bathrooms and a living room). At
490 square feet, the one Owner’s Suite is extremely luxurious. None of
the staterooms have private balconies, though all have ocean views and
were refurbished a few years back, offering luxurious Belgian linen, plus
tech stuff such as CD and DVD players, and a flat-screen TV with Internet
capability. The bathrooms are stocked with Bulgari toiletries. Rates
include all spirits, wine, tips, and some shore excursions. Table 12-10

and genteel, a Silversea cruise aims to please the most discerning and
well-traveled cruise lovers in the world. The food and service are the
best at sea, and the ships’ Italian-style décor is warm and inviting. No
expense was spared in their design.
A most noteworthy program is Silversea’s new and unique Personalized
Voyages, which allows passengers to create their own itineraries and get
on and off at select ports (you pay a daily rate, with a 5-night minimum
stay required). Table 12-11 shows Silversea’s itineraries and sample fares.
If you pay in full at least six months in advance, you get 5 percent off;
repeat cruisers can save 5 to 10 percent on select cruises, combinable
with other discounts; and there are often special deals for singles.
Dining
If you’re a foodie and a ship lover, a Silversea cruise is a must. Well pre-
pared and presented, the creative chefs continually come up with great
dishes in each ship’s three restaurants. Each has a formal open-seating
venue and two more casual options; most evenings, all three venues are
open for dinner. The main dining rooms are elegant affairs with live
music and small dance floors, but the line really shines in the Terrace
Cafe, one of the ships’ two reservations-required alternative dinner
restaurants. Fixed-themed menus may include a Provence night, which
starts with foie gras carpaccio and smoked duck Margret, and leads to
five more courses, not counting the petit fours at the very end. By day,
the indoor/outdoor Terrace Cafe is the ships’ casual spot for bountiful

buffet breakfasts and lunches. All restaurants have plenty of tables for
two, though in the main dining room, you may have to wait for one.
The other alternative venue is a new Relais & Chateaux (a guide that
rates the top restaurants and hotels around the world) venture overseen
by world-famous chef Joachim Koerper. Called Saletta on Wind and Cloud
and Le Champagne on Shadow and Whisper, a fixed menu is offered and
dining here is included in the cruise price — only the vintage wines are
added to the bill. Intimate and elegant dining spaces, they’re perfect for
private dinner parties.
The wine list in the dining room is superb, with several complimentary
wines suggested at each meal from more than 40 choices. You can also
purchase one of the wines not included in the complimentary list — a
$745 1990 Château Margaux, anyone?
Once per cruise, passengers are invited into the galley for the traditional
galley brunch. Plus, poolside you can stay in your suit and nosh on burg-
ers, sandwiches, and salads. The line’s 24-hour room-service menu
includes such decadent choices as caviar and jumbo shrimp cocktail.
You can also order off The Restaurant’s menu during its dinnertime
hours and have your meal served in your suite course-by-course.
Activities and entertainment
After a lovely day touring, say, Singapore or Stockholm, guests dress for
dinner and enjoy low-key socializing over cocktails in the piano bar. For
something a bit more razzmatazz, you can find casinos on each, plus
attractive two-level show lounges with small-scale song-and-dance
revues and performances by classical musicians and other artists.
By day, you can enjoy cruise standards such as trivia games, card tour-
naments, golf putting/driving (there are special golf cruises with PGA
pros on the Shadow and Whisper), wine-tasting seminars, and stretch
and aerobics classes. Or, you can feed your brain and take in one of
Silversea’s impressive enrichment lectures. At least one guest speaker is
featured on every sailing. They include guest lecturers from a wide range
of disciplines, including the likes of Fred McLaren, a retired Navy captain
and professor, who does a slide show and talk on his adventures diving
12,500 feet down in a Russian MIR submersible to explore the remains of
the Titanic. Other lecturers include Lynn Sherr, ABC News correspon-
dent and author; The New Yorker cartoonist Bruce McCall; and Brian
Jones, who together with his Swiss colleague Bertrand Piccard, pulled
off one of the most daring feats in aviation history — the first circumnav-
igation of the earth in a hot air balloon.
The line’s culinary theme cruises (there were four in 2005), in partner-
ship with Relais & Châteaux, are hosted by Relais Gourmands chefs and
feature demos and tastings in the ships’ new Viking Cooking Schools,
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
214

which include Viking cooking stations so that guests can cook along with
the guest chefs. There are also a number of theme cruises hosted by
famous vintners.
The ships’ Balinese-inspired Mandara spa beckons with its flower-strewn
copper foot bowls, warm massage rocks, and other Asian-inspired treat-
ments. To avoid waiting in line to experience it, you can book your treat-
ments online before your cruise.
For kids
As you may expect, these are not kid-centric ships in any way, shape, or
form. There are no organized activities or playrooms for kids, though
you may be able to arrange in-cabin babysitting during evenings if a
crewmember is available. If your kids are young, though, do yourself a
favor (and everyone else’s) and bring a nanny.
Figure 12-6: Silver Whisper
Fleet facts
The appealing all-suite cabins on all four Silversea ships have walk-in
closets and marble bathrooms, and most have balconies. At 285 square
feet, the standard suites are slightly bigger on the newer Whisper (see
Figure 12-6) and Shadow than on the Cloud and Wind (248 square feet),
and their bathrooms are among the best at sea, with double sinks, sepa-
rate long tub and shower, and yummy Acqua di Parma bath products.
The biggest suites are apartment-sized and come with features such as
three bathrooms and two balconies. The top suites also enjoy butler
service, plasma-screen TVs, Bang & Olufsen or Nakamichi 3 CD stereo
systems, afternoon canapés, and free laundry service. Fares include all
wines, spirits, champagne, stocked minibar, tips, free shuttles from ports
to city centers, and on select cruises, a special shore-side cultural event.

Chapter 13
Small and Sailing Ships
In This Chapter
 Reading the charts on alternative cruising experiences
 Introducing the major small ships and sailing ships
O
h, woe is you. You have a hankering to travel by sea, but you’ve
read over the preceding couple of chapters and found yourself
thinking, “Well, that seems like it would really suck.” The megaships
sound too Vegas for you (or Cancun, or Miami, or any other high-octane
resort), and the luxury ships sound too hoity-toity tea-at-three.
Well, you’ve come to the right place. The ships in this chapter are none
of that. The smallest ships of those we review in Chapter 11 carry 342
passengers, the biggest ship in this chapter carries only 436 — and the
smallest carries (get this) 6. That, all by itself, means you get a com-
pletely different cruise experience with these ships — more personal,
more flexible, and more low-key.
The downside is that because most small and sailing ships carry few
passengers and operate in popular niche markets, they don’t play the
same constant discounting game as the big lines. Often, the prices they
list in their brochures are exactly what you end up paying — and those
prices are almost always higher than the mainstream lines to begin with.
You can find a few bargains among cruises on these ships. Most small-
ship lines offer some kind of early-booking discounts, and sometimes
offer deals on specific sailings. Some lines (especially the sailing-ship
lines) offer very attractive rates and frequent deals. Lastly, remember to
think in terms of the big money picture when weighing the affordability
of these lines: In contrast to most megaship experiences, where you end
up spending hundreds extra on shore excursions and extra-cost onboard
attractions, on small ships you often visit places you can explore on
your own, or where excursions are included.
What Makes the Small Ships Tick
In a word, place — a sense of place, the idea that you’re not just skim-
ming like a rock on water from island to island, collecting a few trinkets
along the way but never really getting a feel for what you’re seeing. On a

small ship you’re down near the waterline, on a vessel small enough that
it can stop for an hour at a small fishing village, or sail up canals and
rivers to historic small towns, or pull up along a coastline to watch a
mama bear and her cubs.
For the most part, activities center around the destination, too, whether
they involve hearing lectures about the region’s history and culture or
just standing on deck with the ship’s resident naturalists, scanning for
whales or rare birds. The larger the vessel, the more likely it is to pro-
gram occasional other activities as well, such as exercise classes, food-
preparation demonstrations, or watersports — the latter sometimes
offered right from the docked ship, via a floating sports platform. Small
ships often include some or all excursions in their rates, too — whether
that’s a visit to an Eskimo village in northern Alaska or a stop at a beach
in the Virgin Islands for barbecue and games.
Meals are usually served in a single dining room, though a few of the
larger small ships also have a small buffet or other secondary option.
Everyone on board is usually able to dine together, and there’s never
such a thing as assigned seats on a small ship — it’s always open-seating.
Dress is always casual: no dress codes here, and hardly anybody ever
does more than a sport jacket or nice dress, even for the captain’s cock-
tail party. Service is generally friendly and casual, with staff often cover-
ing several jobs: cabin steward in the morning, waiter by night, and
luggage-handler at the beginning and end of the trip. End-of-voyage tip-
ping is usually done on a pooled basis: You just leave some cash in an
envelope, and the crew splits it between them after you’re gone.
After-dinner entertainment is limited, usually consisting of nothing more
than an ad hoc crew talent show or maybe a musician or two. Some ships
also bring aboard local musicians and dancers when they stay late in port,
and others may use the after-dinner hour for an informal lecture or to talk
about the next day’s port or sailing region.
Because small ships are, by definition, small, your cabin probably won’t
be overly spacious. Some small ships do offer suites or deluxe cabins if
you have a yen for yardage (and the bucks to pay for it), but expect little
variation among cabins on any of these ships. Expect little in the way of
amenities, too: Many small ships don’t have TVs in the cabins, for exam-
ple, and bathrooms are usually very small.
A few things to consider about the small-ship experience:
 Few small ships have stabilizers, so things may get bumpy if you’re
sailing in rough open water. On the other hand, many small ships
stick to protected coastal waters and bays, so open-water sailing
may not be an issue on your itinerary.
 Very few small ships have elevators, so they aren’t a good option if
you have mobility problems.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
218

 With few exceptions, none of the small-ship lines offers room serv-
ice. Those that do include Windstar’s ships, Delta Queen’s ships
(limited breakfast menu only), American West’s ships (breakfast
and sometimes dinner for suite passengers only), and Star Clipper’s
Royal Clipper (suite guests only).
 No small ships are really geared toward children, though a few
do offer special family-oriented sailings, and one (Windjammer
Barefoot) offers a children’s program on some sailings.
 Most small ships don’t carry a medical staff on board when sailing
coastal or river itineraries. Instead, any passenger who becomes
seriously ill or injured is evacuated quickly to a medical facility on
shore. Doctors are usually carried on open-sea voyages.
Bear in mind that small-ship lines often measure their ships’ gross regis-
ter tonnage or GRTs (a measure of internal space, not actual weight) dif-
ferently than the large lines. There’s not even a definite standard within
the small-ship market, so the best way to compare ship sizes is to just
look at the number of passengers on board.
American Canadian Caribbean Line
461 Water St., Warren, RI 02885; % 800-556-7450; www.accl-smallships.com
 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Small, luxurious yachts
No-frills and offbeat, this family-owned New England line attracts super
casual, L.L.Bean types looking to explore new places. The down-to-earth
older crowd appreciates ACCL’s lack of glitz and gimmicks, as well as
unpretentious features such as a BYOB policy.
All told, American Canadian Caribbean is a delightfully rare find. It’s one
of the few lines that designs, builds, maintains, and markets its own
ships. If you sail this line, you’re guaranteed an unusual, “what you see is
what you get” experience: friendly, homespun, and visiting some places
few other ships go. Each vessel’s unusually shallow 61⁄2-foot draft com-
bines with other patented innovations to allow it to sail in narrow, shal-
low waterways and nudge directly up onto pristine, dockless shores,
disembarking passengers via a ramp that extends from the bow.
With an innovative, exploratory design, the extremely informal small
ships won’t win any awards for décor (they are, in fact, about the most
bare-bones vessels you can find in terms of amenities, service, and
meals), but that’s not what they’re all about. Instead, this is a line that
gets passengers close to the real life of the regions it visits, whether you
want to explore historic American towns and check out fall foliage along
the Erie Canal, visit tiny islands such as Bequia in the Caribbean, or play
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 219

connect the dots among New England’s islands. Table 13-1 shows ACCL
itineraries and sample ACCL fares.
Passengers sailing solo can take advantage of a “Willing to Share” pro-
gram, in which the line pairs you with another solo passenger, thus
avoiding the 175 percent rate you’d pay if booking a cabin just for your-
self. If another solo is not aboard, you get the cabin for the cheaper rate
anyway. On the other side of the spectrum, when three passengers share
one of the ships’ tiny cabins, each gets a 15 percent discount.
Dining
Basic, all-American food is well prepared, folksy, presented by friendly
down-home crew, and as far away from fancy as you can get. Meals are
served promptly at 8 a.m., noon, and 6 p.m., and are an opportunity for
passengers to mix and mingle, as dining is open seating, communal-style
for all meals, at tables primarily seating eight. Each meal has one entrée
choice, and anyone wanting an alternative meal (such as chicken instead
of beef) can be accommodated only if he or she notifies the kitchen
before 10 a.m. Passengers following special diets, such as vegetarian,
can also be accommodated with advance notice.
Fresh fish is common on Caribbean and Central America itineraries,
especially those that include Belize. One cook told us about a fisherman
in St. Lucia who paddled up to the ship and asked if they’d like to buy
some fresh tuna. When the cook asked how he’d know it was fresh, the
man said, “Give me ten minutes,” then went off and caught one. The
same fisherman now supplies the line whenever its ships are in port.
Occasional theme nights offer dishes from Italy, the Caribbean, the
American West, and other regions, and there’s usually a barbecue on the
top deck at least once per cruise, weather permitting. Tea, coffee and
hot chocolate are available round the clock, and fresh fruit, snacks, and
fresh-baked cookies and muffins are served between meals.
The line’s BYOB policy is a real money-saving system for passengers — a
bottle of rum we bought in Panama City, for example, cost less than $5 —
about the cost of one drink on most ships. Passengers’ beer and wine are
labeled and stored in a cooler near the bar, which also has separate
shelves for liquor bottles. Soft drinks, along with tonic and soda water,
are provided free of charge at the bar. On the first and last night of each
cruise, hour-long welcome and goodbye parties feature an open bar (for
all drinks but beer), as well as jumbo-shrimp cocktails, smoked salmon,
or something similar.
Activities and entertainment
Amusement is mostly of the do-it-yourself variety, such as board games,
puzzles, cards, reading, and chatting with the other passengers.
Otherwise, you can find occasional informal lectures, a few printed
quizzes, cooking demonstrations, and bridge and galley tours, and that’s
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
220

about it. River, canal, and coastal cruises concentrate on visits to histori-
cally rich Colonial ports, plus exploration of the region’s flora and fauna,
with area guides and naturalists leading visits to wildlife sanctuaries and
parks. In the Caribbean and Central America, the platforms at the stern
of the ships let passengers step right into the water for snorkeling, swim-
ming, kayaking, or taking a ride in a 24-passenger glass-bottom boat,
used to view coral formations and tropical fish.
The amount of time spent at each port varies from a few hours to an
entire morning or afternoon, and the ship usually remains anchored or

docked at night, allowing passengers to explore restaurants and/or
nightspots ashore.
Select cruises, including those to Belize, typically carry full-time natural-
ists aboard, but the line does not consistently have the variety or quality
of onboard experts you may find on more outdoors- and learning-oriented
lines such as Glacier Bay, Lindblad, and Clipper.
Evenings, the BYOB cocktail hour is a time for songs (accompanied on
the lounge piano, assuming there’s a passenger aboard who plays),
announcements, and an occasional informal talk about an upcoming
sight or experience. A movie from the ship’s video collection is usually
shown after dinner on the large-screen TV in the lounge, and sometimes,
local entertainers, such as Dixieland bands on Mississippi River itiner-
aries and Garifuna dancers in Belize, are invited aboard for an evening or
perform for passengers in port.
For kids
These are totally not family friendly, with an age minimum of 14. Teens
older than that had better be pretty good at entertaining themselves or
really intellectually curious to be good candidates for an ACCL trip.
Figure 13-1: Grande Mariner
Fleet facts
Though sisters Grande Mariner (see Figure 13-1) and Grande Caribe
are definitely the most comfortable and appealing vessels the line has
ever built, they’re still as basic as cruise ships come, with tiny, spartan
cabins (that means no TVs) and no-fuss décor. Same deal and then some
for the smaller, older Niagara Prince, which has an even tighter layout.
No one books these ships expecting luxury, though. Seaworthy and prac-
tical, they all have the innovative exploratory features for which ACCL is
known. The ships have a top-deck lounge and outdoor sitting space, plus
a dining room below. No cabins are wheelchair accessible. See Table 13-2

American Safari Cruises
19101 36th Ave. West, Suite 201, Lynnwood, WA 98036; % 888-862-8881; www.am
safari.com
 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, gourmet
 Ship size/style: Small, luxurious yachts
For those who can afford it, American Safari offers truly adventurous
cruises on its fleet of tiny, but very cushy yachts. Carrying only 12 and
22 passengers apiece in plush comfort, the line’s three vessels have
homey lounges, ocean-view hot tubs, and large cabins. Fares include
spirits, wine, and shore excursions (but not tips).
An American Safari cruise is best suited for hands-on types, attracting a
well-traveled group of 40- to 60-somethings. Some days are spent kayak-
ing in the wilderness and others visiting small ports of call, sometimes
overnighting there for a taste of the local nightlife. A passenger-crew
ratio of about two to one ensures that a cold drink, a clever meal, or a
sharp eagle-spotting eye is never more than a request away. During the
day passengers have a lot of flexibility: If some want to kayak and others
want to go wildlife-watching in an inflatable, no problem; your wish is
their command. American Safari itineraries and sample fares are shown
in Table 13-3.
Professional naturalists sail on all Alaska, Pacific Northwest, and Baja
itineraries leading off-vessel explorations and answering questions on
board.
Dining
Crewmembers cheerfully fuss over you, adjusting lunchtime dishes and
making elaborate cocktails from the free open bar (they may even call
ahead to the next port for your favorite beer), and the chef indulges
guests with multiple-course meals (cuisine is finer than you may expect
to find on small ships) and clever snacks when he isn’t bartering with a
fishing boat for the catch of the day. All meals are served family-style
and dress is always casual. Special dietary requests (vegetarian, and so
forth) can be accommodated with advance notice. Snacks such as
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 223

Gorgonzola and brie with pears, walnuts, and table crackers are set out
between meals.
Activities and entertainment
If you like staying active on vacation as much as you like being pam-
pered, ASC is surprisingly outdoorsy, with expedition leaders accompa-
nying passengers on off-vessel exploration. In Alaska, you may take out a
Zodiac boat or kayak to investigate shoreline black bears or river otters,
or to navigate fjords packed with ice floes and lolling seals. Expeditions
include trips to boardwalked cannery towns, Tlingit villages, and tiny vil-
lages such as Meyer’s Chuck, population about 50, give or take. Activities
throughout the day are well spaced, and there are many opportunities to
see wildlife.
In California, Wine Country cruises include private tours and tastings.
The main lounge is the social center of each ship, a place for guests to
relax, listen to an informal lecture by the ship’s naturalist, play a game of
cards or Scrabble, or watch a movie from the ship’s library on the big-
screen TV. From time to time, the ship docks at a town with a measure of
nightlife — at the least, you get to shoot a game of pool; at best, the pas-
sengers all head out together for a pub crawl.

For kids
Most sailings have no programs or facilities whatsoever for kids, but
occasional sailings in Alaska and the Sea of Cortez are targeted to fami-
lies (and called Kids in Nature, or KIN, cruises), with naturalists giving
kids lessons in the region’s flora and fauna. At the end of the trip, kids
get a few “graduation gifts,” including a video documenting their week
on board and a “University of Whales” diploma.
Figure 13-2: Safari Quest
Fleet facts
Safari Escape, Safari Quest (see Figure 13-2), and Safari Spirit resem-
ble private yachts more than cruise ships, and they have the cabins to
match, with televisions, VCRs, and roomy bathrooms with showers (and
a shower-tub combo on the Spirit). The Spirit has the largest cabins, and
after its overhaul in 2005, is considered the most luxurious of the fleet.
The Admiral’s Cabins have large picture windows, a small sitting area,
plus other features such as a cedar-lined sauna or a small balcony.
Otherwise, cabins have windows, but those on the lower deck are ele-
vated, meaning sunlight comes in but you have no view. All public rooms
have generous panoramic views. See Table 13-4 for fleet specifications.

American West Steamboat Company
2101 Fourth Ave., Suite 1150, Seattle, WA 98121; % 800-434-1232; www.american
weststeamboat.com
 Type of Cruise: Nostalgic river and coastal cruises
 Ship size/style: Two small, beautifully-designed sternwheelers,
built in the fashion of the ships of the 1800s and early 1900s
Designed after the great paddlewheel riverboats of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, the Empress of the North and the Queen of the West
offer an experience heavy on history and charm, taking passengers back
in time while sailing in Alaska and on the Pacific Northwest’s Columbia
and Snake Rivers. The accommodations are plush, the atmosphere one
of nostalgia, and the onboard artwork a feast of Americana, with cowboy
bronzes, silver buckles and ornate spurs, paintings and artifacts of the
Lewis and Clark expedition, Alaska Native art, and other items.
The two ships are all about nostalgia, offering cruises that mix port calls
with time spent cruising wild areas. Guests — mostly early-to-bed types
between ages 65 and 70 (though there are sometimes extended families
with kids cruising together) — are attracted by the ships’ historic feel
and are equally interested in the history of the ports. All cruises feature
lecturers who discuss the sailing region, and one shore excursion is
complimentary in every port.
The crew is enthusiastic and helpful. Most are young, but some of them —
the bartenders, for example — tend to be more mature and quite accom-
plished. Unlike the kids who work the dining rooms, these guys have had
many years of experience in their craft. Table 13-5 displays American
West’s itineraries and sample fares.
Some itineraries — especially Alaska cruises — come with airfare bun-
dled into the rates, providing a big cost savings.
Dining
Food on board is served family style: good and solid, but don’t expect
gourmet. One main restaurant serves all three very filling meals, but it
can become a bit crowded, to the point where you sometimes pass
dishes to your neighbor, as the server can’t get through.
You can also get continental breakfast and burgers, hot dogs, sand-
wiches, and homemade chili and soup at lunch in a casual spot called
the Calliope Bar & Grill.
Activities and entertainment
As aboard other small ships, organized activities are limited. Guest lec-
turers come aboard to talk about the history and culture of the areas
through which the ships sail, and if you don’t feel like showing up in
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
226

person, you can listen to the talks in your cabin, via an audio feed. In the
evening, the main lounge programs various small-scale entertainments,
including jazz soloists, small song-and-dance revues, and occasional
movie screenings.
For kids
You don’t find many kids on board, and those that do sail this line must
find their own amusement.
Figure 13-3: Empress of the North
Fleet facts
Queen of the West, the smaller of the line’s two ships, was built in 1995
and has operated in the Columbia and Snake Rivers ever since. Its bigger
sister, Empress of the North (see Figure 13-3), debuted in 2003. The
ships are more spacious than you may think when you first see them
from shore, with public rooms that evoke a bygone era. Our favorite is
definitely the Paddlewheel Lounge, where you can sip a cocktail to the

Both ships are fitted with bow landing ramps, which let them cozy up
to shore so passengers can walk easily on and off the vessel, even in
secluded spots that lack docking facilities.
All cabins on both ships are decorated like cozy bedrooms, with dark
wood tones, flowery bedspreads, and lace curtains. The majority of
suites and staterooms have verandas, the rest large picture windows.

cruise.com
 Type of cruise: River, coastal, and open-sea small-ship cruises
 Ship size/style: Mixed fleet of casual coastal cruisers and more
elaborate oceangoing vessels
Passengers on Clipper ships get to explore rivers, sparsely inhabited
islands, and deep fjords, yet these cruises are hardly about roughing it.
Instead, they represent low-fuss vacations for low-fuss people who want
to learn something about the places they visit. The line caters to mature,
easygoing, relatively affluent, and well-traveled older passengers (average
age 69) who want a casual and educational vacation experience heavy on
nature, history, and culture. It’s an ideal choice for travelers who’ve sailed
the mainstream or premium lines and want to try a small-ship cruise.
One of the more wide-ranging small-ship lines, Clipper covers a huge
variety of destinations, from river, lake, and coastal cruises on the
U.S. east coast, the Great Lakes, and Alaska, to ocean voyages visiting
Asia, Russia, Antarctica, Australia and New Zealand, Scandinavia and
Greenland, Europe, South America, and the South Pacific. Naturalists,
historians, and other experts sail on all itineraries to offer informal lec-
tures and lead expeditions to sites of interest. Stops at the ports may
also include a guided hike in a wildlife preserve or along the coast, a
museum visit, swimming and snorkeling, or other options, including
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
228

shore excursions similar to those offered by the mainstream lines.
Occasional nights spent in port offer a chance to mingle with the locals.
For Clipper itineraries and sample fares, see Table 13-7.
Dining
Clipper’s cuisine is generally straightforward, prepared by chefs from
the Culinary Institute of America. Though not terribly adventurous
(beyond using local ingredients wherever possible), it’s very well pre-
pared, focusing on meat, seafood, and pasta. All meals are served in the
main dining room, and light breakfast and lunch items are served buffet-
style in a public lounge. Weather and time permitting, a barbecue is on
deck at least once per weeklong cruise. There’s no dress code.
Activities and entertainment
As aboard the other small-ship lines, Clipper’s activities all revolve
around the ships’ destinations, with most days spent in port. In the
evenings, resident naturalists and historians deliver informal lectures,
which on our last cruise included talks on the nature and geology of the
Caribbean islands, reef fish identification, and plant life.
For kids
Clipper offers no children’s programs.
Figure 13-4: Clipper Adventurer
Fleet facts
Clipper operates both small coastal cruisers and larger, more substantial
vessels for expeditionary ocean voyages.
Clipper Adventurer (see Figure 13-4) is one of our very favorite small
ships. Its interior (all new in 1998) is almost plush on the inside (in a
clubby, comfortable, seagoing way) and tough as nails on the outside,
with an ice-hardened hull that allows it to sail exotic itineraries in the
Arctic and Antarctica. Clipper Odyssey is Clipper’s other oceangoing
ship, holding down the fort on the Pacific the way Adventurer does in the
Atlantic. Sleek and yachtlike, she offers more than the average small

ship, including two lounges, a library, a small pool, an elevator, and even
a jogging track. All cabins have sitting areas with sofas, and eight deluxe
cabins and one suite boast private verandas.
Nantucket Clipper and Yorktown Clipper are both simple coastal
cruisers with simple layouts: one large lounge that can accommodate all
guests, a single dining room, and several outside deck areas for sunning,
relaxing, and wildlife-viewing. All the well-designed, smallish cabins are
outside and most have picture windows and good amounts of storage
space. Some have doors that open to the Promenade Deck rather than to
an inside corridor. See Table 13-8 for fleet specifications.

Alaska legend Charles “Chuck” West founded Cruise West in the late
1980s to present a genuine and close-up view of Alaska. Today, the com-
pany is still in the West family and its mission remains the same, even
though its geographic reach has expanded to include destinations such
as Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, California’s Wine Country, the rivers of
Oregon and Idaho, Arctic Russia, the South Pacific, and Japan.
Cruise West passengers tend to be older (generally in the upper end of
the 50–75 age range), well educated, independent-minded, and insistent
upon a casual and relaxed onboard atmosphere. Every aspect of the trip
is destination-oriented, with itineraries dividing their time between sail-
ing in gorgeous natural areas and visiting ports of call — both large, pop-
ular ports and smaller, lesser-known ones. Because these ships are
small, they can navigate tight areas (such as Alaska’s Misty Fjords and
Resolution Sound, Costa Rica’s Manuel Antonio National Park, and Los
Islotes and Isla Partida in the Sea of Cortez) and scoot close to wildlife
without causing alarm. When the ship is sailing, many passengers con-
gregate on the open bow or the open Top, Port, and Starboard Decks to
scan for wildlife or just take in the views. Table 13-9 shows Cruise West’s
varied itineraries and some sample fares.
Dining
All meals are served in single open seatings at each ship’s main restau-
rant, with an early-riser’s buffet also available in the lounge. Cuisine is
fairly average home-style American, varied but not over-fancy. Chefs
make a point of stocking up on fresh seafood while in port. Spirit of
Oceanus has a buffet option at breakfast and lunch, and all ships try to
serve at least one lunch and/or dinner outdoors.
Activities and entertainment
The ships provide binoculars for guest use and carry naturalists who
help guests spot and identify wildlife and geological features, usually
announcing good sightings over the intercom. Forest Service rangers,
fishermen, and members of local tribes sometimes come aboard to
speak and/or accompany guests in port. Occasionally, expedition lead-
ers take passengers for a spin in the ships’ inflatable launches, getting
close to shore. Kayaking is also available on some itineraries. At least
one shore excursion is included for each port of call, ranging from short
performances or driving tours to full-day odysseys.
Aside from these destination-oriented activities, the most you can
expect is an occasional movie screening in the lounge (and even that is
probably destination-oriented!) or sometimes a very silly crew talent
show. The larger Spirit of Oceanus has a small gym, but on the other
ships the only exercise option is walking around the outside deck.
For kids
Cruise West offers no children’s program.

Figure 13-5: Spirit of ’98
Fleet facts
Spirit of Oceanus is one of our favorite small ships, a spacious and
well-designed vessel with interiors reminiscent of 19th-century yachts.
Wood-paneled staterooms are huge, most with a large sitting area and
extra-large bathroom. Cabins on Sun and Sports Decks trade interior
space for private teak balconies. Public areas include two lounges, a
small gym, an outdoor buffet restaurant, and an outdoor hot tub.
Spirit of ’98 (see Figure 13-5) is charming, designed to resemble a 19th-
century coastal steamer. There’s even a player piano in the lounge, plus
period-looking balloon-back chairs, pressed tin (er, aluminum) ceilings,
ruffled drapery, and plenty of polished woodwork and brass.
Spirit of Endeavor is very similar to Clipper’s Nantucket Clipper and
Yorktown Clipper, with the same kind of low-key, comfortable feel, which
makes sense, since she formerly sailed for Clipper, as Newport Clipper.
Similar in style is Pacific Explorer, which offers comfortable cabins as
well as a fleet of Zodiacs, kayaks, snorkel gear, and banana boats for off-
vessel exploration and fun.
The line’s most unusual itineraries may be those offered by its cabinless
day cruiser Sheltered Seas, which visits Alaska’s great natural areas by
day and then delivers passengers to shore every evening for dinner and a
stay at a local hotel. It’s like a road trip, but without the road. The vessel
is equipped with a dining lounge (and a galley for preparing lunch), a
viewing lounge, a bar, and two outside viewing decks.
Cruise West’s remaining vessels, Spirit of Alaska, Spirit of Columbia,
Spirit of Discovery, and Spirit of Glacier Bay, are all utilitarian small
ships from the 1970s. They all offer an intimate cruise experience and
the usual small-ship arrangement of two public rooms (a main lounge
and a single dining room), plus outdoor viewing decks to take in the
scenery. Expect décor and design to be spartan.

 Type of cruise: Nostalgic river cruises
 Ship size/style: Three beautifully-designed sternwheelers, one an
original from the 1920s, the others larger recreations
Wanna cruise like Mark Twain? Delta Queen is your best bet, offering a
time-travel option that re-creates what it was like to sail the Mississippi
River system back in the old days. The small, wooden Delta Queen was
actually there. Built in 1927, she’s a direct link to the old days, and even
has National Historic Landmark status. The larger Mississippi Queen and
American Queen (see Figure 13-6) were built in 1976 and 1995, respec-
tively, and offer a combination of old-style décor and a few cruise ship
amenities.
On board all three ships, the main activity is watching the river go by
while a resident historian known as a “riverlorian” talks about life and
history along its muddy banks. Porch swings and rocking chairs provide
the best perches out on deck, and when it’s time to go ashore, the boat
may just tie up to a tree and let passengers off right on the river’s edge.
Who needs a pier?
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 235

All around, Delta Queen offers more lavishing décor and better food and
service than you can find on most of the other ships discussed in this
chapter, and its boats have an intimacy and personality that bigger
cruise ships lack. Many crewmembers have been with the company a

some passengers, many of whom have sailed with the line before. Table

Dining
Delta Queen serves some of the most varied and tasty menus among the
small-ship lines, with cuisine tilted toward Southern, Cajun, and middle-
American dishes. Meals are served in traditional style, with passengers
assigned to a set table for lunch and dinner. Expect dishes such as crab-
stuffed catfish, seafood gumbo, prime rib, Mississippi Mud Pie, and
maybe even fried alligator at a late-night buffet. Between meals you can
snack on a bottomless supply of popcorn.
Activities and entertainment
Learning about the Mississippi and its tributaries is the focus of most
days, with the onboard historian offering both formal talks and less
formal interaction — describing passing areas, showing you where you
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
236

are on a chart, and so on. Other low-key activities include film screen-
ings, calliope concerts (each boat has one), and kite flying from the top
deck. In the evenings, Delta Queen’s entertainment program is heavy on
Dixieland jazz and swing. Because of Louisiana state law, currently no
casinos are on any of the vessels.
For kids
Mississippi Queen and American Queen offer summer and holiday “river-
bonding” cruises, offering activities for the whole family as well as
unplugged kids’ activities such as knot tying. The Delta Queen does not
offer this program and does not have any facilities for kids.
Figure 13-6: American Queen
Fleet facts
Built in 1927 for service between San Francisco and Sacramento, Delta
Queen is an authentic river steamboat, oozing personality from the
fluted columns and potted plants of her Cabin Lounge to the polished
brass and gauges of its engine room. Victorian and period American fur-
nishings fill its several lounges, its Orleans Room restaurant, and its
cabins, which feature stained-glass windows, acres of wood paneling,
and (in most cases) doors that open up directly onto the Promenade
Decks, with rocking chairs just outside.
American Queen and Mississippi Queen are much larger vessels built to
offer a period feel as well as modern amenities such as plunge pools, a
gym, and private balconies. The largest sternwheeler in history, American
Queen was designed on a grand scale, full of filigree and curlicue ornamen-
tation and crowned with two huge fluted smokestacks. Mississippi Queen
was, amazingly enough, designed by the same architect who created
Cunard’s Queen Elizabeth 2 in the 1960s. She was given a new Victorian
interior in 1996, with a trompe l’oeil ceiling hovering over her grand stair-
case and period furnishings in her public rooms, such as the Paddlewheel
Lounge (with views from two-story windows) and the Wheel House, where
passengers can read the charts to track their progress on the river. See
Table 13-12 for fleet specifications.

 Type of cruise: Casual, easy, party, and cheap
 Ship size/style: Small, no-frills
easyCruise, a new line launched by U.K.-based entrepreneur Stelios Haji-
Ioannou (the brains behind easyJet, easyHotel, easyCar, and a dozen
other “easy” companies), has a niche all its own in the cruise business —
neither mainstream, luxury, nor your usual small-ship cruise either. The
idea is actually pretty simple: Throw out everything people expect a
cruise to be and start over.
People accustomed to treating their ship like a home away from home?
Not here, where the ship is just a combo transportation device and sleep-
ing compartment. People accustomed to traveling in a bubble, with the
cruise line arranging activities, entertainment, and excursions? Not here,
where you’re completely on your own, with a concierge to suggest the
best restaurants and clubs in port. People accustomed to itineraries that
start somewhere, go somewhere, and end up back at the beginning a week
or so later? Not here, where passengers have the option of boarding and
debarking at any of the ports and sailing as many or as few nights as they
want, with the only rule being a minimum two-night stay. People accus-
tomed to paying a single price for their whole trip, everything included?
Not here, where the rates are per-day and only cover the cabin charge.
Everything else costs extra: meals, daily service by a cabin steward, and
niceties like beach towels. Sound expensive? NOT! EasyCruise’s rates are
actually fantastically low, averaging $57 per person, per day, double occu-
pancy, with all bookings made through the company’s Web site. And if you
feel like traveling at the last minute, you can book up to 48 hours before
sailing as long as cabins are still available.
Essentially, easyCruise is a Eurail Pass for the 25- to 50-year-old set: cheap,
flexible, and easy, and they don’t hold your hand. “I don’t expect a lot of
my customers to spend much time in their cabins,” says Haji-Ioannou.
“This is about making the destination the destination, not the ship.”
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
238

Currently, the line is operating only one itinerary — a repeating 7-night
French and Italian Riviera loop, sailing round-trip from Nice each Friday,
visiting Cannes and St. Tropez (France); Genoa, Portofino, and Imperia/
San Remo (Italy); and Monaco. Passengers may start and end their trip
anywhere along the route. Because all these ports are close together (the
route is less than 200 miles from end to end), the ship can stay late and
still make it to the next stop by morning, giving passengers time to enjoy
the Riviera nightlife. You never have to be back aboard before 4 a.m., and
if you miss the boat, you can just hop a taxi and catch up in the next town.
If the easyCruise idea flies, Haji-Ioannou plans to add more ships to the
itinerary and expand into other regions where the port-a-day concept
could work, such as the Greek Isles, Spain’s Balearic Islands, and the
Italian coast around Capri and Naples. At press time, the company was
also exploring plans to sail the Caribbean for the winter, offering 7-night
cruises from Barbados. Table 13-13 shows easyCruise’s current lone itin-
erary and sample fares.

Dining
Meals are available from three casual areas on board: a tapas bar, a
sports bar with burgers, and an Italian-style cafe. All meals are charged
restaurant-style, with prices listed on the menu. The expectation is that
most passengers dine on shore, and the ship carries a concierge who
can direct passengers to the best restaurants in each port.
Activities and entertainment
As with everything else in the easyCruise world, it’s expected that pas-
sengers find their entertainment in port and only return to the ship to
sleep. Consequently, the onboard experience offers very little: a hot tub,
a small workout room, a gift shop, and a DJ in the tapas bar some
evenings — and that’s it.
For kids
None. The easyCruiseOne (see Figure 13-7) is adults only, with a mini-
mum age of 18.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 239

Figure 13-7: easyCruiseOne
Fleet facts
easyCruiseOne, the fledgling line’s first ship, was built in 1990. As part
of its easy-fication, the ship’s hull, cabins, and public areas were painted
orange and white (the official colors of all “easy” companies); its interior
walls were moved to fit more cabins (increasing its passenger load from
114 to 170); and its cabin windows were sealed over, creating rooms that
really are just places to sleep. Average cabin size is a tiny 100 square
feet, with four larger staterooms at 258 square feet. All cabins have
simple platform beds and a private bathroom with shower, but not much
else. See Table 13-14 for fleet specifications.

Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
240

The Wilderness Explorer offers the most active adventure cruises, spend-
ing 5 days of her 6-day itineraries in Glacier Bay and the surrounding
waterways, with passengers kayaking and hiking every day. (Day six is
spent mostly aboard ship, with a brief stop at Glacier Bay Lodge.) The
Wilderness Adventurer (see Figure 13-8) and Wilderness Discoverer offer
medium-adventure cruises, spending most days in wilderness areas,
either off-vessel for kayaking, hiking, or beachcombing, or on board for
scenic cruising. The Executive Explorer offers cruises on a par with
Cruise West and Clipper, combining cruising in natural areas such as
Glacier Bay, Tracy Arm, and Misty Fjords with visits to small Alaska
towns such as Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Metlakatla.
The adventure cruises attract younger guests as well as outdoors-oriented
older passengers, with as many couples in their 40s and 50s as in their 60s
and 70s. When we sailed, we even met one couple in their 90s who took
advantage of every opportunity to kayak and hike. The Executive Explorer
attracts a generally older, less active crowd. See Table 13-15 for Glacier
Bay itineraries and sample fares.
Cruise fares include shore excursions at the ports and/or exploration of
wilderness areas. The Wilderness Explorer itineraries include a pre-cruise
hotel night. Every once in a while the line also offers free airfare.
Dining
Glacier Bay’s cuisine is pretty basic American fare, with dinners includ-
ing a choice of two entrees, typically a fresh fish such as halibut or
salmon and a chicken or beef dish. All meals are served at single open
seatings in each vessel’s one restaurant, but in good weather the chefs
sometimes do a barbecue outside on the top deck.
Activities and entertainment
The adventure-oriented ships are outfitted like cruising base camps,
with Zodiac landing craft for going ashore in places without port facili-
ties and a fleet of stable, two-person sea kayaks that allow quiet and
unobtrusive observation in wildlife areas. Two naturalists sail with each
vessel, leading shore excursions and sharing information on the region’s
wildlife and history. Guest lecturers sometimes sail as well, or come
aboard to give readings of Alaskan stories or presentations on glaciers,
marine life, whales, and other natural topics. All ships offer a comfort-
able and casual environment, with meals served family style at one seat-
ing on an unassigned basis. The vessels’ windowed observation lounges
and large observation decks serve as the main gathering places, with
binoculars provided for guest use. Expect little more.
For kids
Nothing for kids on most sailings, though the line does offer several
family-oriented cruises every summer, with supervised kids’ activities
and half-off rates for passengers 18 and under.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 241

Figure 13-8: Wilderness Adventurer
Fleet facts
Wilderness Adventurer and Wilderness Discoverer are very similar
vessels that sailed originally for ACCL. Like all ACCL ships, they were
built long and low, with a shallow draught (the amount of hull below the
waterline) to sail into places few other ships can go. When Glacier Bay
purchased the ships, it outfitted them with a fleet of stable two-person
sea kayaks and a dry-launch platform in the stern that allows passengers
to take off right from the ship. Glacier Bay also gussied both ships up
over the past few years, though cabins remain small and spartan. Cabin
bathrooms are amazingly tiny. Just consider it part of the adventure.

The tiny Wilderness Explorer raises the bar on spartan accommodations
even higher, with miniscule cabins with upper and lower berths (bunk
beds), one small lounge/bar, and a topside Observation Deck. If you’ve got
the bucks, you can book the one sizable cabin on board, located right
behind the wheelhouse, with windows to port and starboard.
Heads up? We mean “Duck!” Wilderness Adventurer, Explorer, and
Discoverer share a drawback: low ceilings. If you’re 6 feet 4 inches or
more, you’ll bump your head.
Executive Explorer is the most comfortable of the Glacier Bay vessels,
with decent-size cabins (though still small bathrooms); a pair of state-
rooms on the upper deck, with huge windows on two sides; and the
usual small-ship arrangement of a single comfortable main lounge/bar
and a single dining room. An open top deck and a covered area on the
middle deck are the best spots for wildlife viewing. Weirdest thing about
this ship? She’s a catamaran, with four decks perched atop twin pontoon
hulls. She’s speedy, too, able to travel at 16 knots. See Table 13-16 for
fleet specifications.

Lindblad Expeditions
96 Morton St., New York, NY 10014; % 800-397-3348; www.expeditions.com
 Type of cruise: Small-ship adventure/educational cruises
 Ship size/style: Coastal and open-sea expedition vessels
Lindblad Expeditions specializes in environmentally sensitive soft-
adventure cruises, offering an experience more oriented toward real
learning and exploration than any competing line. It’s our top pick
for trips to real adventure destinations such as Antarctica and the
Galapagos, and it also offers great adventure-learning trips in closer 
destinations, such as Baja and Alaska.
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 243

The line’s cruises are truly exploratory in nature. Most days are spent off
the ship aboard Zodiac boats and/or on land excursions, learning about
the destinations first-hand, with a team of four to five naturalists, one
historian, and an undersea specialist along to help you understand
what you’re seeing. That’s the highest number of experts carried by any
of the small-ship lines. As part of a 2004 agreement with the National
Geographic Society, Geographic scientists, photographers, and film
crews sail aboard Lindblad’s ships, providing guests with an enhanced
experience but also conducting actual research on land and undersea.
The line’s most adventure-oriented vessel was rechristened National
Geographic Endeavour and fitted with advanced research equipment,
and an advisory group is helping develop research, conservation, and
educational initiatives for the Lindblad fleet.
Passengers tend to be physically active as well as intellectually curious
and are generally in the over-55 range. They’re also the types who can
afford Lindblad’s high rates, though the inclusive nature of the product
makes those prices a little easier to swallow. Shore excursions are all
included, for example, as is airfare on some itineraries and sailing
dates. For more details about Lindblad’s itineraries and fares, check
out Table 13-17.
If you’re flexible about your departure date, you can get a discount of
$500 on many sailings. Just select the month you want to travel (as well
as the cabin category), and then, one month prior to the selected month,
Lindblad determines availability. If space is available, you get your sail-
ing. If not, you get a travel certificate worth $250 per person, applicable
to any future sailing.
Dining
Hearty buffet breakfasts and lunches and sit-down dinners often reflect
regional culture and tastes, made from local, seasonal ingredients pur-
chased in ports along the way, as part of Lindblad’s commitment to pro-
moting sustainable agriculture and fishing practices.
Activities and entertainment
While on board, passengers entertain themselves with the usual small-
ship activities: wildlife watching, reading, and attending onboard lec-
tures and slide presentations by resident naturalists and National
Geographic experts. Each evening, the naturalists lead discussions
recapping the day’s events, and after dinner, a documentary or feature
film may be screened in the main lounge. In some regions, local musi-
cians may come aboard to entertain.
All ships carry exploration essentials such as Zodiac landing craft, sea
kayaks, snorkeling gear, wet suits, and other low- and high-tech under-
water equipment. On the Islander, a certified massage therapist sails on
board, offering massage and wellness treatments and leading exercise
classes, and the Sea Voyager has a small fitness room.

Rica, Baja, Alaska, and the Galapagos.
Figure 13-9: Sea Lion
Fleet facts
National Geographic Endeavour is Lindblad’s flagship and also the
flagship of its partnership with the National Geographic Society. Built
tough, with a reinforced hull and stabilizers to enable sailing in rough
regions from the Arctic to the Antarctic, the vessel is also sizable and
comfortable, with niceties such as a fitness center, sauna, small swim-
ming pool, wood-paneled library, and even a hair salon, in addition to
the usual main lounge and dining room. Cabins are sufficiently roomy.
Cabins on the upper deck have picture windows but those on the lower
decks make due with portholes — which is just fine except during rough
seas, when the porthole covers are bolted shut for safety reasons. Two
suites on the upper deck have separate sleeping and living areas.
The smaller, shallow-draft Sea Lion (see Figure 13-9) and Sea Bird are
identical twins, right down to their décor schemes and furniture. Both
ships have two public rooms (the observation lounge/bar and the dining
room) and all cabins are outsides, with picture windows that open to let
in breezes and fresh air.
The cabins, dining room, and lounge area on the Sea Voyager are almost
plush by expedition standards. The Polaris is a homey expedition ship
with a classic seagoing look, full of polished wood and brass, with teak
decking and a comfortably laid-back vibe. Public areas include the main
lounge, single dining room, and a cozy library, as well as a covered out-
side deck with chairs and tables. Cabins are all outsides with windows
or (on A Deck) portholes. The Islander is a sturdy twin-hulled vessel
designed for year-round service in the Galapagos, with all outside cabins

 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, rustic
 Ship size/style: Classic schooners
The Maine Windjammer Association isn’t a cruise line at all, but rather a
marketing group for 14 owner-operated classic schooners, some dating
as far back as 1871. All of them sail — and we do mean sail, using sail
power exclusively or almost exclusively — in and around mid-Maine’s
Penobscot Bay from late May to mid-October, providing an absolutely
perfect way to see one of the country’s most beautiful stretches of coast.
This is one of the greatest small-ship experiences you can get — and the
prices are right, too.
With no engines (on most vessels), little electricity, and only the most
basic accommodations, these ships offer their passengers the chance to
get off the grid for a while, away from mechanized society and constant
bustle. Days are filled with the demands of sailing (which passengers
can help out with if they choose), walks around quaint Maine towns,
quiet reading time on deck, and sometimes an impromptu race with one
of the other schooners. Service, such as it is, is provided by the same
folks who trim the sails and keep the boat on course — which means
you shouldn’t expect much beyond a set of fresh sheets when you
board. They’re terrifically friendly, though.
Typical passengers run the gamut, age-wise, though most tend to fall
between 30 and 80. A huge percentage are repeaters, with some returning
Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 247

to vacation on the same schooner year after year. They’re individualists,
sometimes luddites, and most are well-educated. For more information
on itineraries and rates, check out Table 13-19.
You can request information for all ships from the address and phone
number above and get basic information on the individual schooners
(and links to their Web pages) through the association Web site. Actual
bookings must be made directly with the captain of each schooner.
Many of the schooners offer early-booking rates during their winter off-
season. Check their individual Web sites for details. As an additional
cost-saver, all the ships are BYOB, providing coolers and ice with which
passengers can chill their beer, wine, or whatever.
Dining
Fleetwide, meals are prepared on wood stoves in rustic galleys and
served out on deck, picnic style. Expect traditional New England staples
such as fresh seafood, chowder, roasts, and Irish soda bread. Dinners
often coincide with sunset, making a beautiful tableau. In inclement
weather, all passengers pack into the galley for meals. Once per cruise,
most of the ships debark passengers onto a quiet, rocky beach for a tra-
ditional lobster bake.
Activities and entertainment
Aside from sailing itself, and visiting small Maine islands and towns by
launch, there’s not much. On many ships the captain and/or members of
the crew are musicians, and will perform in the evenings. Passengers
may also bring along acoustic instruments.
For kids
None of the Windjammers have kids’ programs, and many actively dis-
courage children from sailing. Most have minimum age requirements
ranging from 10 to 16, though Timberwind (see Figure 13-10) accepts
children as young as 5, and Isaac H. Evans accepts kids as young as 6
years old. Most ships make exceptions for children of past passengers.

Fleet facts
The Maine Windjammer Association includes classic vessels more than
130 years old as well as newer vessels created in a traditional style.
Many vessels are either listed on the National Register or designated a

 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, romantic
 Ship size/style: Classic-style sailing ships
Wanna play pirate without roughing it? These three replicas of 19th-
century clipper ships have the sails and rigging of classic tall ships, but
also the creature comforts of today. Pools, a piano bar and deck bar, a
bright and pleasant dining room serving tasty food, and a clubby, wood-
paneled library balance out the swashbuckling spirit. Royal Clipper also
boasts a gym, a small spa, and marble bathrooms.
Passengers are an international mix of active, intelligent 30- to 60-
somethings with a penchant for the sea. The vibe is casual and chatty,
and you’re free to explore, whether climbing the masts (with a harness,
of course), helping raise the sails, crawling into the bow netting, or chat-
ting with the captain on the open-air bridge. Of course you can choose
to do nothing but sunbathe, sip cold drinks at the bar, or listen to the
captain’s daily talk about the next port of call, the history of sailing,
or some other nautical subject. When you cruise into a port, whether
Bequia or Langkawi, you feel like you’re on ships that belong there (as
opposed to those big white megaships barreling into port).
These ships aren’t just pretty to look at; they’re a treasure for old salts
and history buffs. Mikael Krafft, the wealthy Swedish-born businessman
who built the three ships, spared little expense to create the replicas. For
the Star Flyer and Star Clipper, Krafft procured original drawings and speci-
fications of Scottish-born Donald McKay, a leading naval architect of 19th-
century clipper-ship technology, and employed his own team of naval
architects to solve such engineering problems as adapting the square-
rigged, four-masted clipper design to modern materials and construction.
In mid-2000, Krafft went a step further, launching the Royal Clipper, a five-
masted, fully rigged sailing ship inspired by the famed Preussen, a German
clipper built in 1902. The Royal Clipper now claims the title of the largest
clipper ship in the world, and is considered the tallest and among the
fastest clipper ships ever built — they’re a stunning sight. Table 13-21
shows itineraries and sample rates for Star Clippers.
You can find frequent deals on back-to-back cruises — either a percent-
age discount or a dollar amount, such as $300 or more off.
Dining
The food is tasty, though don’t expect gourmet. All meals are open seat-
ing, with tables for four, six, and eight in the restaurant; the dress code is
always casual (though some guests don jackets on the night of the cap-
tain’s cocktail party). Breakfast and lunch are served buffet style and are
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
250

the best meals of the day. The continental cuisine reflects the line’s large
European clientele and is dominated at breakfast and lunch by cheeses,
as well as marinated fish and meats. Breakfasts also include a hot-and-
cold buffet spread and an omelet station. Late-afternoon snacks served
at the Tropical Bar include such munchies as crudités, cheeses, and
chicken wings.
Friendly waiters serve sit-down dinners. Menus typically offer five main
entree choices, plus appetizers, soup, salad, and dessert courses. Only
the Royal Clipper offers 24-hour room service, and only for passengers
staying in the 14 suites and Owner’s Suites.
Activities and entertainment
For most people, just being on these ships is entertainment enough.
Enjoying the sailing experience and socializing with fellow passengers
and crewmembers is the main activity, as it is on most any ship this size.
That, plus the ships are in port every single day, with few exceptions, so
boredom is hardly an issue. Still there are a few things scheduled, includ-
ing informal talks by the captain on maritime themes, and, at least once a

day, the cruise director gives a brief spiel about the upcoming ports and
shipboard events (if we had one complaint, it would be these talks aren’t
meaty enough). Weather and conditions permitting, passengers can lend
a hand with deck duties, climb the masts, and have a token try at han-
dling the wheel.
Each ship maintains an open-bridge policy, allowing passengers to wander
up to the humble-looking navigation center at any hour of the day or night
(you may have to ask to actually go into the chart room, though).
There may also be a brief engine-room tour, morning exercise classes on
deck, ever-popular excursions via tender to photograph the ship under
sail, and hanging out by the pools (three on Royal Clipper, two on Star
Clipper). On all three ships, you can borrow DVDs from the library or
watch the movies that are shown each day on cabin TVs in English,
German, and French.
Activities in port revolve around beaches and watersports, and all are
complimentary, including snorkeling, water-skiing, windsurfing, sailing,
and banana boat rides. For an extra fee, the ships offer PADI-approved
scuba diving, including resort instruction.
After-dinner entertainment takes place nightly by the open-air Tropical
Bar, and runs the gamut from a crew talent show to a trivia contest,
dance games, or a performance by local entertainers (such as a steel-
drum band) who come on board for the evening. A keyboard player
(who seems out of place on ships like these) is on hand to sing pop
songs before and after dinner. Most nights, disco music is put on the
sound system and a section of the deck serves as an impromptu dance
floor, with the action usually quieting down by about 1 a.m.
Ships tend to depart from their ports early so that they can be under
full sail during sunset. Trust us on this one: nothing is more romantic.
Position yourselves at the ship’s rail or dawdle over drinks at the deck
bar to watch the sun melt into the horizon behind the silhouetted ships’
masts and ropes. If only every day of your life was this good.
For kids
Not a line for young kids (though the line has no age restrictions). There
are no supervised activities and no babysitting unless a crewmember
agrees to volunteer his or her off-duty hours. The exception is during
holiday seasons such as Christmas, when families are accommodated
and some children’s activities are organized by the watersports staff,
including treasure hunts, beach games, and arts and crafts. For well-
behaved, intellectually curious kids over 10 or 12, a Star Clippers cruise
any time of the year could be a fun and educational experience.

Figure 13-11: Star Clipper
Fleet facts
Décor on Star Clippers ships is conservative, with touches of mahogany
and brass. Public rooms on the Star Clipper (see Figure 13-11) and Star
Flyer are comfortable and almost cushy. Cabins are small (but okay for
a ship of this size), and the teak Sun Deck space gives you much more
room to spread out and enjoy the sea breeze than what you can usually
find on small ships.
The Royal Clipper’s cabins are larger and have marble bathrooms and
nautical décor, plus you can find 14 veranda suites with butler service.
Royal has a neat lounge that offers underwater viewing while the ship is
at anchor, plus there’s a small gym, spa, and larger, more plush restau-
rant. See Table 13-22 for fleet specifications.

Chapter 13: Small and Sailing Ships 253

 Type of cruise: Adventure/educational, family, party
 Ship size/style: Old-style sailing ships
Weee whoooo, these ships sure are fun. Ultracasual (shorts and T-shirts
are the order of every day — even at dinner and at the bar) and refresh-
ingly carefree, leave your inhibitions (and your shoes) at home. This
eclectic fleet of cozy, rebuilt sailing ships lures passengers into a fantasy
world of pirates-and-rum-punch adventure. With the sails flapping above
the ample wooden decks, you feel like you’re a glorious million miles
from reality. Passengers and crew mingle on the cozy decks and bond
over free rum swizzles and homemade snacks at happy hour. The cute
captains come right out of Central Casting, with their deep tans, shorts,
and sunglasses, while passengers are an all-ages mix of eccentric non-
conformists attracted to the totally unpretentious vibe, low rates, and
cloak of adventure.
Windjammer strays off the beaten track when at all possible. The closest
thing you get to a good old-fashioned Caribbean adventure, the ships
head for quiet, out-of-the-way Caribbean islands such as Bequia, Les
Saintes, and Jost van Dyke, places that couldn’t be further away from
the commercial tourist fray. The ships are ultra-informal and hokey, yet
endearing rituals make the experience feel like summer camp for adults.
Captain Mike Burke — also known as Cap’n Mike — founded the company
in 1947 with one ship. For years, the sailor-turned-playboy ran down-and-
dirty party cruises popular with singles (the lines used to advertise in
magazines like Hustler — you get the picture), purchasing sailing ships
rich in history but otherwise destined for the scrap yard and transforming
them into one-of-a-kind vessels. Things have tamed a bit since those early
days; the company is now run by Burke’s daughter Susan. Table 13-23
offers more information on Windjammer itineraries and rates.
Sure the cabins are closet-sized, but you pay way less for a Windjammer
cruise than you would on Star Clippers and Windstar, and bar drinks are
a steal. Plus, one child between 6 and 11 sails free May through early
August when sharing a cabin with parents.
Dining
Elbows are allowed and so are bathing suits; just try and remember to
say please when you’re asking for more of that free cheap wine. Family
style and informal, there’s nothing gourmet about the food, though usu-
ally it’s tasty enough. All breads and pastries are homemade, and at the
two open dinner seatings, after soup and salad are served, passengers
can choose from two main entrees, such as curried shrimp and roast
pork with garlic sauce. Breakfasts and lunches are typically served
buffet style. At certain islands, the crew lugs ashore a picnic lunch for an
afternoon beach party, and each sailing usually includes one evening on-
deck barbecue. The chef accommodates special diets, including vegetar-
ian and low-salt. And don’t be shy if it’s your birthday: The chef will
make you a free cake and serve it at dinner.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
254

Aside from that free wine with dinner, Bloody Marys are free at break-
fast, and each evening at about 5 p.m., gallons of complimentary rum
swizzles are dispensed along with hors d’oeuvres that may include
homemade plantain chips and salsa or cheese and crackers. Guests
gather on deck, often still in their sarongs and shorts, mingling in the
fresh sea air as island music plays in the background.
Activities and entertainment
In a nutshell, goofy. (And just our cup of tea!) It all starts with the
Captain’s “Story Time” each morning, where the boss offers a rundown
of the day’s schedule with some ribald jokes thrown in for good meas-
ure. Passengers are trained to lovingly shout back “Good morning,
Captain SIR!” Then there’s that beloved Windjammer tradition, the
weekly costume party. Passengers (along with the captain and crew) get
all decked out as cross-dressers, pirates, and other characters. Just
about everything happens on the top open decks, including a passenger
talent show and a local band brought on for the evening. Plus, the ships
often stay late in one or two ports so that passengers can head ashore to
an island watering hole.

Aside from all the free drinks, you can also buy ’em for peanuts: just $2
for an imported brew and $3.50 for a piña colada.
By day, you’re likely to wander around some port or sunbathe on deck
(or sleep off a hangover). A few inane activities may be offered on deck
late mornings and late afternoons, from crab races to a knot-tying demo.
If conditions are right and the captain amenable, passengers can jump
overboard, literally, and go for a swim when the ship is anchored off-
shore. Just about every day is spent in port somewhere. Generally at
least once per cruise, on one of the ships’ beach visits — to Jost Van
Dyke, perhaps — beach games are arranged and sometimes a barbeque
or organized hike around the island. You can also rent snorkeling or
scuba gear (and sign up for lessons, too).
Of course there’s nothing better to do on a Windjammer cruise than
cuddle with your special someone and watch a dreamy sunset melt into
the horizon. What’s more romantic than the swoosh swoosh swoosh of a
sailing ship slicing through the sea, elbows on the railings and cold beer
in hand?
If you’re unattached, Windjammer offers about six wild-and-crazy singles
cruises a year, plus a handful of other theme cruises every year. The line
also occasionally charters its ships for gays, nudists, Parrot Heads, and
other groups.
For kids
For curious kids with a love of the outdoors, Windjammer can work for
families with older kids (no children under 6 are allowed to sail aboard
any of the ships). The Legacy, Polynesia, and Grace have a “Junior
Jammers” kids’ program for ages 6 to 17 that can draw as many as 40
kids a cruise in the summer. There are youth counselors for two main
age groups (6–11 and 12–17) who supervise a roster of complimentary
summer-camp-style activities all day. Though there aren’t any organized
activities on Mandalay and Yankee Clipper, teens may enjoy the experi-
ence if they’re the kind that can part with e-mail and cellphones for a
week. There is no babysitting of any kind.
Unlike most megaship lines, which require passengers to be at least 21
years old unless accompanied by parents, Windjammer’s minimum unac-
companied age is 17 and the drinking age is 18.
Fleet facts
The Legacy, Mandalay, Polynesia, and Yankee Clipper (see Figure
13-12) are all tall ships that operate by a combination of sail and engine
power, while the Amazing Grace is best described as a motorized banana
boat, carrying passengers and supplies for the other Windjammer ships
(cargo areas of this ship are off-limits to passengers). The Grace tends to
attract an older clientele.
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
256

Figure 13-12: Yankee Clipper
The sailing ships are rustic — all polished rails, brass trimmings, and
well-trod teak decks — and chances are you may grow quite attached to
yours by week’s end despite the close quarters below decks. Each ship
has a single dining room, but all other onboard activities are out on the
roomy open decks and the open-air bars. Cabins are tiny and offer no
frills; many have bunk-style beds (the Polynesia and Legacy even have
some four-passenger dorm-style cabins). Some cabins on the Amazing
Grace don’t have private shower and toilet facilities, so passengers
share with neighboring cabins; the other ships provide individual show-
ers in the cabins. The Legacy, which is much larger and more modern
than the other ships, has somewhat larger cabins and bathrooms, wider
corridors, and a small television room/library that gets little use. See

cruises.com
 Type of cruise: Adventure, gourmet, romantic
 Ship size/style: Modern, smallish ships with sails (and engines, too)
It’s simple: If you’re looking for a high-end sailing ship experience that
manages to be casual and down-to-earth, yet also elegant in a yachty
sort of way, Windstar’s for you. The food and service are really good,
cabins are very comfortable, and the ships hit a lot of great out-of-the-
way ports of call. Are you in love yet? We are.
The sailing ship thing is always romantic, and Windstar is particularly hot.
Lounge by the pool under full sails as the ship cuts through the surf to the
next exotic port of call. Retire to your cabin and enjoy room service or
just drinks from the minibar. Have a cocktail under the stars, then enjoy
chef Joachim Splichal’s delicious cuisine in open-seating restaurants
where you can always get a cozy table for two. No wonder Windstar’s so
popular with honeymooners.
The sophisticated, well-traveled crowd who’s attracted to Windstar
appreciates the classic, nautical surroundings, all stained teak, brass
details, and navy-blue fabrics. And while the ships’ proud masts and
white sails cut a traditional profile, they’re also ultra-state-of-the-art,
controlled by a computer so that they can be furled or unfurled at the
touch of a button (though the ships’ diesel engines are used often too).
As you see a Windstar ship approaching port, with its long, graceful hull
and masts the height of 20-story buildings, you forget all about the giant
megaships moored nearby and think, Now that’s a ship.
Beyond “don’t wear shorts in the dining rooms,” there’s no real dress
code here, and most men don’t even bother with a sport jacket at dinner.
The Windstar crowd, a casually elegant group of 30- to 60-somethings,
wouldn’t want to vacation any other way. Table 13-25 offers Windstar
itineraries and lists sample rates.
The line operates under a tipping-not-required policy, although generally
guests do tip staff as much as on other ships; on Windstar, as on Holland
America, there’s just less pressure to do so.
Windstar often offers two-for-one deals and discounted or free airfares.
Dining
Great cuisine is a high point of a Windstar cruise, and you can find it
offered in two or three open-seating, always-casual restaurants on board
the line’s three ships. The cuisine here was created by award-winning
chef/restaurateur Joachim Splichal, of Los Angeles’ Patina, who at press
Part IV: Ship Shapes: The Cruise Lines and Their Ships 
258

time, was about to introduce 70 new recipes. His yummy dishes are
straightforward, yet incorporate regional touches and surprising twists.
The wine list is also impressive. Vegetarian dishes and healthy “Sail
Light” choices designed by light-cooking expert Jeanne Jones are avail-
able for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; fat and calorie content is listed on
the menu.
Restaurants aboard all three ships are set up with an unusual number of
tables for two (proving that Windstar is serious about its romantic image),
and there’s rarely a wait.
Generous spreads at breakfast and lunch are available at the buffet-style
Veranda on all three ships. Windstar’s largest ship, the Wind Surf, also
offers alternative dining at the casual, 128-seat Bistro, an intimate space
with a pretty garden motif and slightly more eclectic menu choices.
Reservations are required, but there’s no additional fee.
The once-a-week evening barbecues on the Pool Decks of the Star and
Spirit are wonderful parties under the stars, with a beautifully designed
buffet spread and (often) a Caribbean-style band adding ambience. On
the Wind Surf, there’s a gala buffet dinner once per cruise in the main
lounge, and all three ships also offer weekly barbeque lunches on deck.

The ships’ pool bars offer pizza and hot dogs afternoons, and the 24-
hour room service includes the standards plus seafood and steaks from
11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; during restaurant hours you can have anything from
the restaurant’s menu served in your cabin.
Activities and entertainment
There are zippo rah-rah activities, keeping days loose and languid: explore
ashore (the itineraries visit a port almost every day) or kick back and
relax aboard ship without a lot of distraction. The few things scheduled
during the day include ho-hum stuff such as casino gaming lessons, walk-
a-mile and stretch classes on deck, and maybe a vegetable-carving demo.
At ports where the ships anchor offshore, passengers can enjoy compli-
mentary kayaking, sailing, water-skiing, snorkeling, windsurfing, and
banana-boat rides, all from a watersports platform that’s lowered from the
stern, weather and sea conditions permitting. For a fee, you can also go
scuba diving. You can also swim off of the platform on Wind Spirit and Star,
though not on the larger Wind Surf for safety reasons. Up top, the Pool
Deck offers a small pool and hot tub, deck chairs, and an open-air bar.
Come evenings, the low-key Windstar crowd enjoys dinner and pre- and
post-cocktails. Several musicians are aboard each sailing to provide
tunes for evening dancing and background. Most evenings, passengers
either retire to their cabins; head for the modest casino; or go up to the
pool bar for a nightcap under the stars. Sometimes after 10 or 11 p.m.,
disco/pop music is played in the lounge if guests are in a dancing mood,
and once per cruise is a crew talent show.
The ships each maintain an open-bridge policy, so at most times you’re
free to walk right in to chat with the captain and officers on duty.
If you consider a massage to be an important cruise activity, you’ll love
the Wind Surf. Considering its intimate, 308-passenger size, she has a sur-
prisingly large and well-accoutered spa facility, totally outclassing most
facilities on other similar-size ships. Spa packages geared to men and
women can be purchased in advance through your travel agent, with
appointment times made once you’re on board, or you can simply book
individual treatments. The ship’s totally glass-walled ocean-view gym and
separate aerobics room are also as good as it gets on a small ship.

As you may expect, these are not kiddy ships. There are no organized
activities or playrooms. The kids that do appear aboard are generally
age 10 and up (the official age minimum is 2), but there are rarely more
than six or seven kids on any sailing, and those only during school
breaks. The ships’ DVD libraries stock some children’s films.

Fleet facts
Although Windstar ships have tens of thousands of square feet of Dacron
flying from their masts, they operate as smoothly as the very best modern
yachts, owing to the computers that control the sails and stabilizers. The
Wind Spirit (see Figure 13-13) and Wind Star are identical, with all out-
side cabins (featuring large portholes) and impressive teakwood-decked,
recently refurbished bathrooms. The Wind Surf was built at the same
shipyard and has the same sail-ship concept as the others, but being
larger, it also boasts a bunch of suites, more lounges and dining venues,
and plenty of excellent outside sitting and walking areas.
All cabins fleetwide have flat-screen TVs, DVD/CD players, and minibars.
The ships offer an extensive DVD and CD collection.
At press time, Windstar was gearing up to announce a fleetwide refur-
bishment program called “Degrees of Difference.” Similar to parent com-
pany Holland America’s recent “Signature of Excellence” initiative, it will
address all aspects of the passenger experience. See Table 13-26 for fleet
specifications.

Calling All Ports:
Where to Go
and Why

In this part . . . 
A
lot of cruise lines (and cruise passengers) behave as if
the amenities and other hoo-ha’s aboard ship are the
be-all and end-all of the cruise experience. Not so. The desti-
nations are what it’s all about. In this part, we give you a good
overview of the major (and some of the minor) ports of
embarkation and ports of call in the Caribbean, Alaska, and
the Mediterranean, and let you know what to expect on
cruises in more than a dozen other destinations, from Tahiti
to Arctic Scandinavia. We offer hints on the best shore excur-
sions you can book through the cruise lines and also tell you
what you can see on your own, whether you want to investi-
gate natural wonders and historic sites or just grab a snow
globe souvenir and hit the beach.

 Hopping back aboard
A
s the old Cunard slogan put it, “Getting there is half the fun,” but
the other half of a cruise’s fun is being there, seeing the sights
and getting a taste of local culture at the ports of call. Aside from some
transatlantic sailings and 2-night party cruises, pretty much every cruise
includes time in port, with some itineraries more port-intensive than
others. It’s just a matter of letting the ship take you there — but when
you get there you have a few little decisions to make. This chapter walks
you through the practical ins and outs of doing just that.
Signing Up for Excursions — or Not
At almost every port of call, you have three options: join one of the
ship’s organized shore excursions, strike out on your own, or remain on
the ship and take it easy.
Gimme the whole truth about excursions
Shore excursions usually mean piling into a tour bus, although at some
locations, you may take some other mode of transportation — minivan,
jet boat, kayak, horse cart, helicopter, plane, or your own two feet. The
excursion cost includes admission to any attractions visited, sometimes
a meal, dance, and/or musical performance, and (oy vey) often a stop at
a “preferred” souvenir store. A guide typically provides running com-
mentary that’s usually a combination of informative and corny.
For cruise passengers, most shore excursions (which we preview through-
out the chapters in this part) are all about providing convenience and a
sense of security. The excursion’s staff picks you up right at the pier, drive
you to your destination, give you a tour, and then drop you back off at the
ship. Zip, boom, bang: done. Other excursions take things a little further,
providing adventure and educational opportunities, sometimes near the
port, sometimes at a considerable distance away.

In most cases, shore excursions are run by local tour operators with
whom the cruise lines have an established business relationship. That
means more “sense of security” for you, and a cut of the profits for the
cruise lines — because remember, in almost all cases you pay for excur-
sions over and above the cost of your cruise.
When do shore excursions make sense?
In ports where you can best reach the sights on foot, beating your own
path is often less expensive and more exciting. However, in locales
where most attractions are far from the docks — and taxis or other local
modes of transportation are scarce, expensive, or dubious — you may
be better off going with the flow and booking an organized excursion.
Other shore excursions that are generally worth the money are sports
and adventure offerings, such as kayaking, biking, golfing, fishing, snor-
keling, scuba diving, and flightseeing tours. These expeditions take
smaller groups of passengers at a time, so you feel like part of the team
rather than part of the herd. You can book most of these activities on
your own, but by booking through the cruise line you’re trading extra
cost for lack of hassle, and assurance that the tour operator is reliable.
Are shore excursions for you?
Choosing an excursion is a matter of both personal preference and 
pocketbook concerns, and comes down to a few basic questions:
 Do you enjoy the company of a group (even on a crowded bus) 
and a sometimes perky tour guide to tell you what you’re seeing, or
do you prefer exploring quietly by yourself, even if you get lost
occasionally?
 Are the sights you want to see close to the docks, or some distance
away? In some ports, the most interesting sights are just a few
blocks from the dock, but if they’re far off it may cost you just as
much to go on your own. Of course, going on your own also gives
you more freedom to pursue your own interests, but you’re also
responsible for getting back to the ship on time. If an excursion’s
late in returning, the ship will wait for it. Not necessarily so if one
or two passengers haven’t returned by all-aboard time.
 How easy is it to find a cab, bus, or rental car to tour on your own,
and how reliable is that transportation?
 Does the tour include all the things you definitely want to see and
do? Some tour descriptions (especially of longer tours) read as if
you can spend hours seeing everything there is to see, but in real-
ity they move at a snail’s pace to accommodate slow-walking pas-
sengers, and take hours getting to and from the destination. If the
tour doesn’t hit everything you want to see, will you still have time
to see or do them before or after the tour?
 Does the activity you want to do require advance reservations
(such as tee times for golf)?
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
266

 How much do the attractions you want to see cost? If they’re near
the dock, it may make sense to just go on your own, rather than
pay the cruise line an extra amount to arrange tickets and a bus
transfer. However, sometimes groups get priority entry to popular
sights, such as La Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona.
In the chapters that follow, we provide more detailed information on
each port, making it easier for you to answer these questions.
How much do shore excursions cost?
Costs for prearranged shore excursions vary widely: You may pay $30
for a short bus or walking tour or $300 or more for a flightseeing trip via
helicopter or plane. Prices listed in this book are adult rates; kids’ prices
are also usually available for all tours.
Guides expect tips, although the amount is up to you. Around 5 percent
of the per-person excursion cost is about right if you enjoyed the tour.
How do you sign up?
Until recently, you always had to book shore excursions aboard ship,
but recently a lot of lines have begun taking reservations early, usually
via the Web. Excursions are listed on the lines’ Web sites, along with
descriptions, durations, and usually prices.
If you wait till you get aboard to sign up, do so early, especially if you
intend to book the more specialized tours, which sometimes can only
accept a limited number of guests.
Order forms for excursions may be waiting in your cabin on arrival. If
not, you can find them at the main reception desk or shore excursions
desk, or at a shore excursions talk that many lines give on the first day
of the cruise. After you sign up, your account is charged for any cost,
and the meeting time and place for your tour is written on the tickets
delivered to your cabin before your first scheduled tour. Usually groups
meet in the ship’s theater or lounge and then debark the ship together.
Make sure that you really want to take all the tours you sign up for. The
cruise lines usually tell the local tour operators how many have signed up
so that the appropriate number of vehicles and guides can be arranged. If
you change your mind after they’ve called, you’ll probably pay the cost of
the excursion anyway, even if you don’t go.
Can I just sightsee on my own?
If you decide to just take in the port on your own, you can go the loose
and easy route — just wandering around and seeing what strikes you —
or you can plan your visit like Eisenhower planned D-Day. We’re big fans
of the former, though certain ports just have so many sights that a little
bit of the latter may be in order, too. Here are some tips:
Chapter 14: Preparing for Ports of Call 267

 Prioritize: Create a must-see list and calculate how much time you
need to get there and how much it costs to get in when you do. You
can ask the ship’s shore excursions staff for assistance here.
 Study up on adventures: Even if you don’t want to book a shore
excursion through the cruise line, you may want to consult with
the excursion staff for activities such as horseback riding, diving,
tennis, and golf. They can recommend reliable operators and tell
you if you need a reservation. Keep in mind that facilities and oper-
ators ashore may get booked up, not only by cruise passengers but
also with land-based vacationers.
 Avoid unmarked taxis: That nice guy beckoning you over to his car
promising a cheap tour may really be a nice guy . . . or he may not.
Official, marked taxis are more likely to be legit, and often have to
abide by city- or state-mandated rates.
 Keep your cabbie: If you find a reliable cab driver that gets you
where you want to go, you may be able to have him pick you up
when it’s time to go back to the ship. This is especially important if
you head to an out-of-the-way beach area (you may not find cabs
waiting when you’re ready to go).
 Consider cost-sharing: Share the cost of a cab with a couple of
cruisemates, even if you all want to split up when you get to your
destinations. And when you negotiate the cost, make sure you and
the cab driver are talking in the same currency.
 Reserve a table: If you want to dine at a highly rated restaurant,
make a reservation before you leave home.
 Eat (and drink) smart: Keep your wits about you when snacking
ashore. What vibe do you get from that street vendor’s cart: “Looks
okay to me” or “Looks like salmonella central”? Likewise, bottled
water may be a better option than tap in some places. If you’re sus-
picious of the water quality, remember that the ice in your drink
could be dodgy, too.
 Don’t dawdle: Make sure you get back to the dock by all-aboard
time. Make a note of it, or carry your ship’s daily program with you
ashore: The time is always listed there.
Prices listed for attractions are adult rates; kids prices are frequently
available.
Why get off at all?
You’re a paying guest on this cruise. Nobody can tell you what you can
and can’t do. If you want to stay on board the whole time, that’s your
right. But seriously, it’s an option, especially if the port doesn’t thrill
you, or you’ve been there before, or you’re just plain tired. The restau-
rants remain open, a limited range of activities are still offered, ship spas
typically offer discounts on port-day appointments, and the ship is just
generally quieter when everyone else is gone.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
268

Getting from Ship to Shore: 
All about Debarking
You can’t start sashaying down the gangway as soon as your ship ties up
to the dock. Nope. You have to wait for local authorities to stamp all
kinds of paperwork first. This may be a short process or it may take up
to two hours, so relax. Have breakfast, look at the view, and study your
city guide until the captain announces the all-clear over the ship’s PA.
Docking versus anchoring
When a ship comes to port, it either docks at a pier or anchors offshore,
depending on the size of the ship (sometimes the dock isn’t deep enough
or long enough to accommodate it) or the popularity of the port that
day (other ships may have gotten dibs on the docks first). Docking is
easy, at least for passengers: You just go to the gangway, swipe your
onboard ID, and you’re off. Things are a little more complicated when
you’re anchored. In these situations, passengers transit back and forth
to shore via small boats called launches or tenders.
Tender debarkation usually works like this: Everyone who wants to go
ashore goes to one of the public lounges and is given a number. Shore-
excursion parties debark first. If you’re not taking an excursion, you may
get an early tender assignment by being first in line, though you still may
have to wait a while.
When it’s time for you to go, report to the lower deck where the tenders
are loading. You have to descend a stairway outside the ship to a launch
platform. There, crewmembers will be ready to help you onto the tender.
Sometimes choppy waves make the boats bob like corks, so you may
Chapter 14: Preparing for Ports of Call 269
Starting your vacation before you embark
With few exceptions, a cruise’s port of embarkation is a destination of its own. Most
lines offer pre- and post-cruise packages for cruisers who want to stretch their trip by
two to four days, or more. In Alaska, the Mediterranean, and some other destinations,
cruise lines offer escorted tours that take you away from the coastal areas, traveling
by bus, train, and sometimes boat and small plane to sights inland. These cruisetour
packages include hotel stays and transportation. If you want to make your own hotel
arrangements, we suggest properties in the main embarkation cities in the chapters
that follow.
Most ships don’t start boarding until the afternoon and don’t depart until after 4 p.m.,
so even if you arrive on departure day, you may still be able to fit in some sightseeing
at your city of embarkation. You can normally leave your luggage at the pier.

need to jump a bit to get on board. If you have a disability or just require
special assistance getting in and out of the tender, alert the crew in
advance so that they can better prepare to assist you.
The ride to shore, although usually short, can sometimes be rough. If
you suffer from seasickness, try to sit near an open area and/or use a
seasickness remedy.
The tenders run all day, so you can return to the ship at any time
(including for lunch). Tenders from several anchored ships may board
from the same dock, so you have to show your ID to get aboard.
Filling your daypack
Be sure to tote the following essentials when you disembark:
 Ship boarding pass and/or shipboard identification: Without
them, you’ll have trouble getting back on board.
 Cash: Although your onboard expenses go on account, you still
need cash and maybe credit cards ashore. (Chapter 5 has the
details on getting the right currency in countries where the dollar
doesn’t fly.) Make a special note of this: After you’ve spent a few
days aboard ship, it’s easy to forget that you need to carry cash.
 Passport or other ID: In foreign destinations, you should always
keep your passport with you. If your ship is holding onto it for
group-clearance purposes, get a photocopy of the main page to
keep with you in port.
 Sunblock/hat: A few weeks ago, in Ibiza, we saw our 20,465th burnt-
to-a-crisp tourist. Don’t be number 20,466.
 Bottled water: Ships sell bottled water near the gangway, but you
can probably get it more cheaply once you get ashore.
 Beach towels: Most ships hand them out for use ashore.
Getting from Shore to Ship: 
Don’t Miss the Boat!
Cruise lines are very strict about sailing times, posting the schedules
both in the daily bulletin and at the gangway. At ports where your ship is
tendered offshore, the final tender departure time is also listed. You
absolutely, positively need to be back at the dock at least a half-hour
before the ship’s scheduled departure — otherwise you may miss the
boat. Shore excursions provide an exception to this rule. If they run late,
the ship accepts responsibility and doesn’t leave without you. If you
travel on your own, however, you could get stuck.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
270

If you do miss the boat, contact the cruise line’s port agent
immediately — they have offices near the docks, usually with a promi-
nent sign, and their address is sometimes listed in the ship’s daily pro-
gram as well. They can help you catch your ship at the next port of call,
but you have to pay your own way there.

Landing in the Caribbean
In This Chapter
 Poking around the ports of embarkation

 Enjoying the best excursions
 Exploring private islands
W
hen most people think cruise, they think Caribbean, whether
they mean to or not. It’s almost creepy, like they’ve been 
programmed — and maybe they have. For a dog’s age, the cruise indus-
try focused laserlike on the region, and it’s still the top cruise destina-
tion, for good reason. On the practical side, the Caribbean islands (and
The Bahamas, which aren’t technically on the Caribbean Sea but might
as well be) are pretty much in Florida’s backyard, and are so close to
one another that it makes for easy sailing. On the unpractical side are
white-sand beaches, swaying palms, clear turquoise waters, tropical 
fish, lush gardens, deep rain forests, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, and
even volcanoes — plus rich Caribbean culture, spicy Caribbean food,
European colonial history, and a big dollop of laid-back island living to
top it all off. The multicultural history of the region creates a checker-
board blend, with the architecture, language, and customs of the Spanish,
French, Dutch, Swedish, British, and Americans in their former (and cur-
rent) colonies or possession. Pre-Columbian peoples, European explor-
ers, pirates, and shipwrecked sailors all contributed to the stories
behind numerous ruins, forts, churches, synagogues, historic homes,
and museums.
Storming the Shore
Now granted, a lot of the islands are touristy, but often it’s confined to
the vicinity of the docks and other resort areas. If you tire of shopping for
fine jewelry, local handicrafts, and duty-free items (or of tipping back the
beers at an island bar), you can head to more isolated and frequently gor-
geous spots along the coast or in the interior, either on your own or a
shore excursion. In this chapter, we list a selection of the best excursions
offered by cruise lines in all the ports.

Major sights on many of the islands are also perfectly accessible on your
own, either on foot or with the aid of a taxi or other transportation. As is
true everywhere, the cruise lines contract with local operators to run
these tours, so you may be able to get the same trips cheaper by book-
ing them yourself once you arrive. Of course, you may just want the ease
of having the cruise line do it for you, figuring the extra few bucks they
make off the top is worth it.
Shore excursions aren’t what they used to be either. For every bland bus
tour or mindless booze cruise, the cruise lines over the past few years
have also been programming more and more active excursions, includ-
ing rain forest hikes, mountain biking, golf, jungle canopy exploration,
scuba, sport fishing, horseback riding, and more.
The prices listed in this chapter are based on 2005 rates and may be
slightly higher in 2006.
Boarding Ship for the Caribbean
The main port cities for Caribbean cruises remain in Florida — Miami,
Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach, and Tampa — plus San
Juan (Puerto Rico). In recent years, though, cruises have been leaving
from alternative homeports such as Galveston and Houston, Texas;
Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; Jacksonville, Florida; and
even as far north as Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Beyond
Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands also serve as homeports, including
St. Thomas and Barbados.
In this chapter, we cover the most heavily trafficked ports of embarka-
tion for Caribbean cruises — Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral/
Cocoa Beach, Tampa, and Galveston — hitting the see-and-do highlights,
whether you only have a few hours before or after your cruise or are
planning an extra couple days. (Prior to Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans
served as a popular port — and may again — but cleanup from the dev-
astation could take months or even years.) The cruise lines typically
offer pre- and post-cruise packages for hotels, sometimes with a rental
car, admission to local attractions, and/or organized tours.
San Juan, which is a port of embarkation and a popular port of call, is
covered in the ports of call section.
Miami
Maybe more than anyplace else in the U.S., Miami seems to embody the
cultural mash-up of fashion, celebrity, design, and wealth that is America
in 2006. It’s the most Latin city in the country, with a stylin’ club scene
that’s utterly replaced the retirement condo lifestyle that predominated
in the 1970s. It’s like the Rat Pack era has returned, only now it’s got a
Latino accent.

place is still there too: sparkling beaches, crystal clear waters, palm
fronds, and that particularly Miami style of resort hotel, jutting up right
from the beach’s edge. And it’s the undisputed cruise capital of the
world, with nearly 4 million passengers embarking here annually.
Cruising into port
Miami International Airport (% 305-876-7000; www.miami-airport.
com) is about 8 miles (or 15 minutes) west of downtown Miami and the
port. If you’ve arranged air transportation and/or transfers through the
cruise line, a cruise line rep directs you to shuttle buses to the port.
Taxis are also available for a fare of about $21 (plus tip) to the port.
SuperShuttle (% 305-871-2000) charges $12 per person to the port,
with two pieces of luggage.
If you’re arriving by car from the north, take I-95 to I-395 and head east
on I-395, exiting at Biscayne Boulevard. Make a right and go south to
Port Boulevard. Make a left and go over the Port Bridge. Coming in from
the northwest, take Interstate 75 to State Road 826 (Palmetto Expwy.)
south to State Road 836 east. Exit at Biscayne Boulevard. Make a right
and go south to Port Boulevard. Make a left and go over the Port Bridge.
Parking lots at street level face the cruise terminals. Parking runs $12
per day.
A five-lane bridge from the downtown district of Miami provides access
to the number-one cruise port in the world, the Port of Miami (1015 N.
America Way; % 305-371-7678; www.miamidade.gov/portofmiami). To
accommodate the enormous amount of cruise traffic, a dozen bi-level
terminals offer easy car access (as you’re coming) and quick Customs
clearance (as you’re going).
Scoring the best excursions
Everglades Airboat Ride: The Seminole Indians called the Everglades
Pahay Okee, the “grassy water,” and on this 40-minute airboat ride you
get to see some of the area’s indigenous wildlife, including water birds
and American alligators (4 hours; $45).
Exploring on your own
You probably need a taxi to hit most of the attractions in Miami.
Go to the beach! You can beachcomb along 10 miles of glorious sand and
surf between the south of Miami Beach and Haulover Beach Park at the
north end. Behind the surf, South Beach’s renowned Art Deco district
spreads out over a full square mile. All in all, it’s the largest concentra-
tion of 1920s and 1930s resort architecture in the U.S. The district
stretches from 6th to 23rd streets, and from the Atlantic Ocean to
Lennox Court. Ocean Drive boasts many premier Art Deco hotels, while
other buildings house chic shops, clubs, restaurants, and cafes.

Near the port, Bayside Marketplace (401 Biscayne Blvd.; % 305-577-
3344; www.baysidemarketplace.com) is a vibrant shopping and enter-
tainment complex with many bayside restaurants and cafes offering out-
door seating, plus live musicians in the evenings. Regular shuttle service
is available from the port, or you can walk over the Port Bridge.
If oil paintings turn you on more than tanning oil, the Bass Museum of
Art (2121 Park Ave.; % 305-673-7530; www.bassmuseum.org) houses
old masters and then some. Admission is $6. Farther afield, the 70-room
Italian Renaissance-style villa now known as Vizcaya Museum &
Gardens (3251 S. Miami Ave., Coconut Grove; % 305-250-9133; www.
vizcayamuseum.com) has been called “the Hearst Castle of the East.”
Industrialist James Deering employed more than a thousand artisans
and laborers from Europe and the Caribbean to build his dream house,
which was completed in 1916 but designed to look as if it had stood for
centuries. Inside, you can visit 42 rooms filled with furniture, paintings,
sculpture, tapestries, wall panels, and decorative arts brought from
Europe by Deering and his designers. Admission to the villa and gardens
is $12. It’s about a mile from downtown Miami.
Take the kids to the Miami Children’s Museum (980 MacArthur Cause-
way; % 305-373-KIDS; www.miamichildrensmuseum.org), which offers
hundreds of interactive exhibits plus programs, classes, and learning
materials related to arts, culture, community, and communication,
including a mock TV studio, a music studio that exposes kids to music
from other cultures, and (how Miami!) a mini Carnival cruise ship where
kids see how a ship works, from navigating to limbo dancing. Admission
is $10; kids under 12 months free.
Across the MacArthur Causeway from the kids’ museum, 19-acre Parrot
Jungle Island (1111 Parrot Jungle Trail; % 305-2-Jungle; www.parrot
jungle.com) features an Everglades exhibit, a petting zoo, and several
theaters, jungle trails, and aviaries. Hundreds of parrots, macaws, pea-
cocks, cockatoos, and flamingos fly overhead, while the Serpentarium
houses the park’s reptile and amphibian collection, including a 20-foot
long saltwater crocodile. Eek! Continuous shows star roller-skating cock-
atoos, card-playing macaws, and stunt-happy parrots. Admission is
$24.95 adults, $19.95 kids 3 to 10, free under 3.
To see sea critters in action, head to the Miami Seaquarium (4400
Rickenbacker Causeway, Key Biscayne; % 305-361-5705; www.miamisea
quarium.com), where Flipper, TV’s greatest sea mammal, performs along
with Lolita the Killer Whale. You can also see endangered manatees, 
sea lions, tropical-theme aquariums, and a gruesome shark feeding.
Admission is $26 adults, $21 kids.
Fort Lauderdale
Fort Lauderdale’s Port Everglades is nearly as busy as the Port of 
Miami, drawing more than 3.5 million cruise passengers a year. It boasts

ultramodern cruise terminals, and easy access to the Fort Lauderdale–
Hollywood International Airport. Unlike Miami, though, Port Everglades
doesn’t offer much nearby activity — just comfortable cruise terminals
with snack bars and seating areas.
Fort Lauderdale and its well-known strip of beaches, restaurants, bars,
and souvenir shops was once infamous for the annual mayhem that

descended every spring break, but yesterday’s students have been
replaced by a far more affluent and definitely quieter yachting crowd.
Boating isn’t just a hobby here; it’s a lifestyle, with more than 300 miles
of navigable waterways and innumerable canals criss-crossing this city
called “The Venice of America.” Visitors can easily get on the water too
by grabbing one of the water taxis (% 954-467-6677; www.watertaxi.
com), which sail between Oakland Park Boulevard and Southeast 17th
Street along the Intracoastal Waterway, and west along the New River
into downtown Fort Lauderdale. All-day passes are $5.
Cruising into port
Port Everglades (% 954-523-3404) is located on State Road 84, east of U.S.
1, about a 2-mile/5-minute drive from the Fort Lauderdale—Hollywood
International Airport. It’s the easiest airport-to-cruise port trip in Florida.
If you’ve booked air or transfers through the cruise line, a representative
shows you to your shuttle after you land. If you haven’t, taking a taxi
costs less than $10 to the port or $12 to the city. If you’re driving to Port
Everglades, you enter via Spangler Boulevard, Eisenhower Boulevard, or
Eller Drive. Parking is available in two large garages for $12 a day.
Scoring the best excursions
Everglades Airboat Ride: A longer version of this tour that we discuss
in the preceding “Miami” section also visits the Flamingo Gardens and
Wildlife Sanctuary, an old homestead that now houses a free-flight aviary
(21⁄2 hours; $36–$48).
Exploring on your own
You need transportation (taxi or otherwise) to get around Fort
Lauderdale.
Backed by an endless row of hotels, the Fort Lauderdale Beach is
located along Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard between SE 17th Street
and Sunrise Boulevard. The Fort Lauderdale Beach Promenade is ideal
for rollerblading, biking, or just strolling.
In the walk-through, screened-in aviary at Butterfly World (Tradewinds
Park South, 3600 W. Sample Rd., Coconut Creek, west of the Florida
Turnpike; % 954-977-4400; www.butterflyworld.com), visitors can
see 150 different varieties of the colorful insects performing butterfly
ballet all summer long. Admission is $17.95 adults, $12.95 kids 4 to 12,
free for kids 3 and under. In downtown Fort Lauderdale, the Museum of
Discovery & Science (401 SW Second St.; % 954-467-6637; www.mods.
org) is an excellent interactive science museum with an IMAX theater
and more than a dozen themed, hands-on exhibitions. Admission for both
IMAX and exhibits is $14 adults, $12 kids 3 to 12, free for 2 and under.
The Museum of Art (downtown at 1 E. Las Olas Blvd.; % 954-763-6464;
www.moafl.org) is a terrific small museum with a permanent collection
of 20th-century European and American art that includes works by
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
282

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 283
Picasso, Calder, Warhol, Mapplethorpe, and Dalí. African, South Pacific,
pre-Columbian, Native American, and Cuban art are also on display.
Admission is $7; closed Mondays.
Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach
Known as the “Space Coast” because of nearby Kennedy Space Center,
the Cape Canaveral/Cocoa Beach/Melbourne area is really anything but
space-age looking. Stretched out along 72 miles of beachfront, it’s prima-
rily a string of hotels, malls, and suburban homes on little side streets
(one of them called “I Dream of Jeannie Lane,” in honor of the old TV
show set in Cocoa Beach). Because the area is only about an hour west
of Orlando’s theme parks, it’s become a major port of embarkation for
cruise ships, especially ones offering 3- and 4-night cruises that can be
paired with 4- and 3-night stays at the Orlando resorts, to make a full
week’s vacation.
Once fairly quiet, the port got a big boost when Disney Cruise Line started
up, building a gorgeous new port facility in 1998. Both of Disney’s ships
are normally based here year-round. Recently, the area has also begun to
benefit from the industry trend of homeporting cruise ships in northerly
cities and running them down the coast to The Bahamas. NCL’s Norwegian
Dawn, for example, includes Port Canaveral as a stop on her weekly
round-trip Florida/Bahamas cruises from New York, giving passengers
access to Orlando and to the Space Center’s visitors complex.
Cruising into port
Port Canaveral is located at the eastern end of the Bennett Causeway,
just off State Road 528 (the Bee Line Expwy.), the direct route from
Orlando International, the nearest airport, about 45 minutes away.
Cruise line representatives meet you if you’ve booked air and/or trans-
fers through the line. If not, the Cocoa Beach Shuttle (% 800-633-0427
or 321-784-3831) offers shuttle service for $27 per person each way. By
car, the area is accessible from virtually every interstate highway along
the East Coast. Most visitors arrive via Route 1, Interstate 95, or S.R. 528.
Parking at the port costs $10 a day.
Exploring on your own
You need a car or taxis to explore the area, which is very spread out.
Although some folks prefer to dash over to Disney World or Universal
Studios, we’re bigger fans of the John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor
Complex (State Road 405 E., Titusville; % 321-449-4444; www.kennedy
spacecenter.com), home to American space flight since the unmanned
Bumper 8 research rocket launch in 1950. The complex has real NASA
rockets, the actual Mercury Mission Control Room from the 1960s, and
exhibits and films (including IMAX) that look at space exploration from
the 1950s to today. Tours explore various parts of the huge space center
complex, with the complimentary hop-on/hop-off bus tour taking in the
LC-39 Observation Gantry (with a view of where the space shuttles lift

off) and the impressive Apollo/Saturn V Center, which includes artifacts,
photos, interactive exhibits, and an actual 363-foot Saturn V rocket.
Buses for this tour operate continuously, leaving every 15 minutes from
the visitor center. Extra-cost tours allow you to visit parts of the space
center where rockets and shuttles are prepared and launched. Down the
road from the visitor complex, near the intersection of Routes 1 and 405,
the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame has an extraordinary museum of space
history, and several simulator rides that let you experience high G-forces,
weightlessness, and the ups and downs of space flight. Admission
(including all exhibits, Astronaut Encounter, IMAX space films, the KSC
tour, and the Astronaut Hall of Fame) is $34 adults, $24 kids 3 to 11, free
for kids under 3. Note that the last tour departs at 2:15 p.m. from the vis-
itor complex, so get there early and spend the day — it will take that
long to see everything.
If you prefer hanging out at the beach, you have a lot to choose from.
Right near the port, Jetty Park (400 E. Jetty Rd; % 321-783-7111) is the
most elaborate and best-landscaped of the local beaches, with picnic

areas, a snack bar, bathrooms, showers, a children’s playground, and
fishing available. Farther along the A1A, at Meade Avenue, the Cocoa
Beach Pier is more of a partying spot, with volleyball, surfing, and an
open-air bar. Lori Wilson Park, farther south at 1500 N. Atlantic Ave., is
another nicely landscaped area with bathrooms and showers, and a
rustic boardwalk with shaded picnic areas and benches.
Tampa
On the other side of Florida from the rest of the cruise ports, Tampa was
a sleepy little town until Cuban immigrants began arriving in the 1880s
and founded the local cigar industry. A few years later, magnate Henry B.
Plant put Tampa on the tourist map by building a railroad into town.
Teddy Roosevelt trained his Rough Riders here during the Spanish-
American War, and various economic booms gave the city both its
charming, Victorian-style Hyde Park suburb and its towering downtown
skyline. The seaport area is under redevelopment, with the Florida
Aquarium and the Garrison Seaport Center (a 30-acre complex of
shops, restaurants, and entertainment, including an IMAX theater) being
joined by office buildings, apartment complexes, and another major
shopping/dining/entertainment center called Channelside.
On the western shore of Tampa Bay, St. Petersburg is the picturesque
and pleasant flip side of Tampa’s busy busy-ness. Originally conceived
and built primarily for tourists and wintering snowbirds, it’s got a nice
downtown area, some quality museums, and a few good restaurants.
More than 810,000 passengers head out to sea from Tampa annually.
Ships sailing from here head primarily to the western Caribbean,
Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, and Central America.
Cruising into port
The Port of Tampa is set amid a complicated network of channels and
harbors near the historic Cuban enclave of Ybor City and its deep-water
Ybor Channel. The cruise terminals are all located along Channelside
Drive, close to the heart of things. If you’re flying, you’ll probably arrive
at Tampa International Airport, approximately 5 miles from downtown
near the junction of Florida 60 and Memorial Highway. If you haven’t
arranged transfers with the cruise line, the port is an easy 30-minute taxi
ride away, with a set fare of $20 per car for up to four people. By car, all
roads — or at least I-275, I-75, I-4, U.S. 41, U.S. 92, and U.S. 301 — lead to
Tampa. Parking at the port is $12 per day.

Tampa City Tour: A bus-tour overview of Tampa, with 90 minutes in
Ybor City (including the Ybor State Museum), and visits to the University
of Tampa, opulent Bayshore Drive, and Hyde Park (4 hours; $34).

Exploring on your own
Tampa is best explored by car, as only the commercial district can be
covered on foot. Most interesting, culturally, is the old Latin enclave of
Ybor City, located about a mile from the docks. Once known as the cigar
capital of the world and now one of three national historic districts in
Florida, it offers Spanish architecture, antique street lamps, cigar shops,
boutiques, nightclubs, and great Cuban food. Most restaurants are
spread out along 7th Avenue, the main artery, which is closed to traffic
at night. The Ybor City Museum State Park (1818 9th Ave., between 18th
and 19th streets; % 813-247-6323; www.ybormuseum.org) has displays
on the area’s cigar history. Admission is $3.
You can get a glimpse of another culture — the Gilded Age tourist 
kind — at the Henry B. Plant Museum (401 W. Kennedy Blvd.; % 813-
254-1891; www.plantmuseum.com), easily identified on the Tampa sky-
line by its 13 silver minarets and distinctive Moorish architecture. It
opened in 1891 as the Tampa Bay Hotel, a magnet for wintering society
types; it’s now filled with European and Oriental furnishings and decora-
tive arts from the original hotel collection. Admission is $5; closed
Mondays. The permanent collection of the Tampa Museum of Art 
(600 N. Ashley Dr.; % 813-274-8732; www.tampamuseum.com) is espe-
cially strong in ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artifacts, as well as
20th-century art. The museum grounds, fronting the Hillsborough River,
contain a sculpture garden and a decorative fountain. Admission is $7;
closed Mondays.
Kid-friendly but not wallet-friendly, Busch Gardens and Adventure
Island (3605 E. Bougainvilla Ave., north of downtown; % 888-800-5447;
www.buschgardens.com) is still Tampa Bay’s most popular attraction,
offering thrill rides, themed “lands” (including Egypt, Timbuktu,
Morocco, and the Congo), live entertainment, shops, restaurants, games,
and a zoo with nearly 3,400 animals and numerous animal habitats.
Admission is reeeeeaaaaaalllly high: $56 for adults, $50 for kids 3 to 9,
free for kids 2 and under. Oh, and there’s a 7 percent tax on top of that,
and parking costs $7.
Near the docks, the Florida Aquarium (701 Channelside Dr.; % 813-273-
4000; www.flaquarium.org) displays more than 10,000 aquatic plants
and animals in a state-of-the-art setting.
If you want to go to the beach, you have to head to neighboring St.
Petersburg, which has a north-to-south string of interconnected white
sandy shores. While you’re there, grab a skein of surrealism at the
Salvador Dalí Museum (1000 Third St. S., St. Petersburg; % 727-823-
3767; www.salvadordalimuseum.org), which contains the world’s
largest collection of Dalí’s work, including 95 oil paintings; more than 100
watercolors and drawings; and 1,300 sketches, sculptures, photographs,
and objects d’art.

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 287

Galveston
Galveston was one of the first ports to which the cruise industry spread
when it decided Florida just wasn’t enough anymore. Located on a 30-by-
2-mile barrier island off the Texas mainland, it’s an ideal port from which
to sail for the western Caribbean, letting ships reach open sea quickly
and be on their way.
The port city’s main attractions are its historic districts, full of Victorian
architecture, and its beaches, which draw crowds of Houstonians and
other Texans during the summer.
Cruising into port
The Texas Cruise Ship Terminal at the Port of Galveston (% 409-766-
6113; www.portofgalveston.com) is at Harborside Drive and 25th
Street, on Galveston Island. It’s reached via I-45 south from Houston. If
you’re flying in, you’ll land at one of two Houston airports: William P.
Hobby Airport (south of downtown Houston, and about 31 miles, or a
45-minute drive, from the terminal) or George Bush Intercontinental
Airport (just north of downtown Houston, and about 54 miles, or an 
80-min. drive, from the terminal). Information on both is available at the
Houston Airport System Web site, www.houstonairportsystem.org.
If you’ve arranged air transportation and/or transfers through the cruise
line, a representative directs you to shuttle buses that take you to the
port. Taxis are also available, but the price is steep: about $80 per car-
load from Hobby or $125 from Bush. If you’re driving to the port, I-45 is
the main artery for those arriving from the north. To get to the terminal,
follow I-45 South to Exit 1C (at Harborside Dr./Hwy. 275); it’s the first exit
after the causeway. Turn left (east) onto Harborside Drive and continue
for about 5 miles to the cruise terminal. Parking rates are based on
length of cruise, with 4-day prices starting at $45.
Scoring the best excursions
City Tour: This basic bus tour visits the historic Strand District before
heading on to Houston’s downtown theater and museum districts,
Hermann Park (home to the Houston Zoo), and River Oaks, Houston’s
most prestigious residential neighborhood. The tour ends at the airport,
making it easy for departing passengers (31⁄2 hours; $47).
Exploring on your own
If you’ve only got a few hours before you have to board your cruise,
focus on the Strand National Historic Landmark District, the heart of
commercial Galveston in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and just steps
from the cruise terminals, running from 19th to 25th Streets between
Church Street and the piers. Galveston was a booming commercial port
back when cotton was king, and the Strand was its Wall Street. Today, its
restored three- and four-story buildings, many with decorative ironwork
facades, house shopping and dining.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
288

The East End Historic District is Galveston’s old silk-stocking neighbor-
hood, running from 9th to 19th Streets between Broadway and Church
Street. It has many lovely houses that have been completely restored.
Three large mansions-turned-museums have regular tours: Ashton Villa
(2328 Broadway; % 409-762-3933; www.galvestonhistory.com); the
Moody Mansion (2618 Broadway; % 409-762-7668); and the Bishop’s
Palace (1402 Broadway; % 409-762-2475), the most interesting of the
bunch. Admission to each is $6.
For a different take on cruising before you head out on your megaship,
visit the Elissa, a three-masted, iron-hulled sailing ship built in 1877 and
now the main attraction at the Texas Seaport Museum (Pier 21, % 409-
763-1877; www.tsm-elissa.org). Admission is $6 adults, $4 kids 7 to
18, free ages 6 and under.
While Galveston’s beaches may not be as great as, say, Miami’s, a good
beach is better than no beach at all. East Beach and Stewart Beach both
have pavilions with dressing rooms, showers, and restrooms, and are

good for day-trippers. Stewart Beach is located at the end of Broadway,
and East Beach is about a mile east of Stewart Beach. Locals and visitors
alike also enjoy walking, skating, or biking along Seawall Boulevard, built
after the giant September 1900 storm that killed 6,000 of the island’s 
residents — one out of every six. The Seawall stretches for 10 miles
along Galveston’s shoreline from its eastern edge, providing a kind of
low-key boardwalk atmosphere.
New Orleans
On August 29, 2005, just as this book was going to press, Hurricane Katrina
smashed into New Orleans, flooding the city and causing catastrophic
damage. At this writing, the human toll was still unknown, as were losses
to the city’s historical and cultural patrimony. Cleanup will take months, if
not years. The authors and editors of this book would like to express their
condolences to the families and friends of all those who were lost. Our
hearts go out to all those struggling still with the storm’s aftermath.
The Ports of Call
This section details most of the Caribbean islands visited by cruise
ships, as well as some popular ports in the Florida Keys, The Bahamas,
and Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.
Antigua
Antigua (an-tee-gah) is the largest of the British Leeward Islands, once
the home to Britain’s most important Caribbean naval base (Nelson’s
Dockyard) and now mostly the home of warm tradewinds, powder-white
sand beaches, scuba-friendly coral reefs, and about 68,000 Antiguans. 
St. John’s, the island’s capital and main town, is a quiet place full of 
cobblestone sidewalks and weather-beaten wooden houses. Close to
port, you can shop in restored warehouses. Away from town, the rolling,
rustic island boasts important historic sites and a laid-back vibe.
The language here in English. The Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.72 =
US$1; EC$1 = US37¢) is Antigua’s official currency, but the U.S. dollar is
accepted everywhere.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock at the Nevis Street Pier or Heritage Quay (pro-
nounced “key”), both located in St. John’s, the island’s only town of any
size. From there, you can either walk or take a short taxi ride into town.
A handful of smaller vessels drop anchor at English Harbour, near
Nelson’s Dockyard on the south coast.
Scoring the best excursions
Nelson’s Dockyard National Park Tour: After heading across the
island, you’ll visit the site of the planet’s last surviving, working

Georgian dockyard, with original colonial structures including forts, resi-
dences, and barracks (3–41⁄2 hours; $46–$59).
Helicopter to Montserrat Volcano: In December 1997, the Soufriere Hills
Volcano on the nearby island of Montserrat erupted, burying much of
the island in lava. This trip takes you over both the volcano and the
lunar highlights of Montserrat’s exclusion zone, the area declared off-
limits to ground transportation (2 hours; $240–$261).
Off Road 4×4 Jeep Safari Adventure: Tour the island’s only remaining
rain forest via a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and stop at the ruins of forts,
sugar mills, and plantation houses. The excursion includes beach time
(31⁄2–4 hours; $52–$67).
Hiking Safari Adventure: This 4-mile uphill/downhill hike takes 
you through Antigua’s rain forest and up to a 1,200-foot lookout for
panoramic views (3 hours; $49).

Antigua

Exploring on your own
Most of the major attractions here are beyond walking distance. Taxis
meet every cruise ship, and taxi drivers are qualified tour guides, charg-
ing fixed fares of around $20 per hour for sightseeing trips (for up to four
people, with a 2-hour minimum). For a scenic 20-mile circular route
across Antigua’s main mountain range, ask your driver to take you along
the steep and sometimes bumpy Fig Tree Drive for fantastic views of
tropical forests and fishing villages. In the local lingo, fig tree actually
means banana tree.
You can find the Antigua and Barbuda Department of Tourism at Nevis
Street and Friendly Alley in St. John’s.
Within walking distance: Apart from duty-free shopping close to the
docks at Heritage Quay and Redcliffe Quay, St. John’s itself is a little
rusty, attractions-wise. Near the main docks, at the intersection of
Market and Long Streets, the old 1750s Court House building now con-
tains the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda (% 268-462-1469; www.
antiguamuseums.org), which traces the nation’s history from its geologi-
cal birth to the present day. Admission is free, but a donation of $3 is
requested. Closed Sundays. While you’re there, pick up one of the two
brochures that detail a self-guided walking tour past the historic buildings
along Redcliffe Quay, one of the oldest parts of town, with restored, Pez-
colored Georgian buildings. Once a trade center for slaves, rum, sugar,
and coffee, it now has a yacht marina, cafes, and boutiques. Top off the
tour with a rum punch at Redcliffe Tavern. A couple of blocks uphill from
the museum, St. John’s Anglican Cathedral (between Long and Newgate
Streets at Church Street) dominates St. John’s skyline with its twin spires.
The current cathedral was built in 1847, replacing an earlier structure lost
to an earthquake. The whole interior is paneled in pitch pine.
If your ship is in town on a Friday or Saturday morning, the market at the
lower end of Market Street gives a little taste of the local lifestyle, with
residents bartering goods and gossip.
Beyond walking distance: From St. John’s, take an excursion or taxi 
11 miles to Nelson’s Dockyard National Park (% 268-460-1379; www.
antiguamuseums.org), once headquarters to British Admiral Horatio
Nelson (1784–87) and now one of the most historic sites in the eastern
Caribbean. At the heart of this landmark is the Dockyard Museum,
where you discover the facility’s links to the era of privateers, pirates,
and great sea battles. A number of other historic structures are dotted
around the park, as well as numerous artifacts related to 17th- and 18th-
century maritime life, and even some sailors’ graffiti dating back to the
1740s. The park grounds are well worth exploring, full of sandy beaches,
tropical vegetation, and a number of nature trails, which can take any-
where from 30 minutes to five hours to explore. Admission to the whole
park is $5. Free guided tours last 15 to 20 minutes.
Uphill and east of the Dockyard, the Dows Hill Interpretation Center
(% 268-481-5045) is part of the Shirley Heights military complex, which
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
292

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 293
dates to the mid-18th century. It features a multimedia review of
Antigua’s history, from the British military occupation to the island’s
role in the slave trade. Admission is $5 for adults, free for children under
12. Continue up the hill to see a number of other military structures and
the Shirley Heights Lookout, once the main signal station used to warn
of approaching bad guys, now just a great view of the harbor below and
the French island of Guadeloupe in the distance.
You can reach the best beaches by taxi, but remember to arrange for
your driver to pick you up later so that you don’t get stranded. Fort
James Beach is the closest to St. John’s, about 5 minutes ($7 by taxi)
from the cruise dock. It’s popular with both locals and tourists, and
often has games of volleyball and cricket going on, plus umbrellas and
beach chairs for rent. Just a little farther north (a $10 cab ride away),
Runaway Bay and Dickenson Bay are the island’s busiest beaches, with
numerous resort hotels, restaurants, and watersports vendors. The
water is calm, and chairs and umbrellas are available for rent. If you
crave complete peace and quiet, head to Half Moon Bay, which is as far
as you can get from St. John’s and still be in Antigua.
Aruba
Way down in the southernmost southern Caribbean, Aruba is one of
the so-called ABC islands — Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao — that lie just
20 miles or so off the South American coast. Blessed with perpetually
sunny skies (annual rainfall is only 17 inches), warm temperatures,
and cool breezes, the island also has some of the best beaches in the
Caribbean, plus great snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing, and pretty
much anything else you can do on the water. Inland, all that dryness
means a stark landscape full of cacti and iguanas.
The island is legally part of the Netherlands, so expect a Dutch feel.
Oranjestad, the island’s capital and the location of the cruise docks,
has Dutch- and Spanish-influenced architecture (the latter owing to the
proximity of Venezuela), great shopping, casinos, restaurants, bars, and
yachting marinas, many right along Lloyd G. Smith Boulevard, the main
drag, which runs along the waterfront.
The official language is Dutch, but nearly everybody speaks English.
You also hear Spanish and Papiamento, a regional dialect that combines
Dutch, Spanish, and English with Amerindian and African words. The
Aruba florin (AFl) is the official currency (1.77 AFl = US$1; 1 AFl = US56¢),
but U.S. dollars are as widely accepted.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships arrive at the Aruba Port Authority, a modern terminal on
the island’s southern coast, in the capital city of Oranjestad. From the
pier, it’s a five-minute walk to the downtown shopping districts.

Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the tours described here, cruise lines typically offer about
a dozen snorkeling, diving, sailing, and other water-oriented tours.
Off-Road Jeep Adventure: If you like the idea of exploring the island by
four-wheel-drive but don’t want to go it alone, this tour puts you in a
convoy of other like-minded souls. A guide stays in touch with you by
radio, and schedules a stop for lunch and swimming (41⁄2–5 hours;
$65–$74).
Mountain Biking on the North Coast: Bike along 10 miles of Aruba’s wild
north coast, visiting a gold mine, a natural bridge cut by the sea and wind,
the little Alto Vista Chapel (dating to 1750), and the California Lighthouse
at the island’s northwesternmost point (31⁄2 hours; $47).
Aruba Bar and Pub Crawl: What you’re doing here, basically, is paying
for a designated driver, who’ll shuttle you to five local pubs (in the capi-
tal, on the coast, and in the countryside), with one free drink included at
each (4 hours; $52).
Atlantis Submarine Adventure: Cruise 150 feet below the ocean in a
submarine to see coral reefs, shipwrecks, and hundreds of curious tropi-
cal fish (11⁄2 hours; $89).
Exploring on your own
Shopping, a couple casinos, and a few museums are within walking dis-
tance of the port. To get to anything else you need wheels. Taxis line up
at the dock and operate on a fixed-fare basis, with every driver carrying
a copy of the official rate schedule (to the beach resorts, it’s generally
$8–$10). For about $35, you can book a one-hour taxi tour for up to 
four people at the dispatch office (% 297-8-22116) in Oranjestad on
Sands Street between the bowling alley and Taco Bell. Another option is
riding the bus, which stops across the street from the cruise terminal
(on L. G. Smith Boulevard) and takes you to the casinos, hotel resorts,
and beaches of Aruba’s west coast. Fares are inexpensive — about $2
round-trip.
Excellent roads connect major tourist attractions, so many people rent
mopeds (for about $30–$40 a day). You can get further information on
rentals at the cruise terminal or at the many bike shops on Lloyd G.
Smith Boulevard. You can also rent a car or four-wheel-drive vehicle
from Hertz, Budget, Avis, or one of the other rental-car companies, all of
which have offices here.
Keep safety in mind when you drive here: The roads get very slippery
when even slightly wet or when sand blows across them. You drive on
the right.
Within walking distance: One of your first welcoming sights is the row
of colorful boats docked at Schooner Harbor, where locals set up open

stalls to display their goods. Up the beach, you can buy fresh seafood
right off the boat. Wilhelmina Park, with a statue honoring Queen
Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, shows the island’s Dutch influences and
includes a tropical garden.
From the port facility, walk about five minutes up Lloyd G. Smith
Boulevard, the main road that runs from Queen Beatrix Airport along
the waterfront up to Palm Beach. This is where your shopping spree
starts, should you have that kind of thing in mind. For quality items such
as French perfume, Swiss watches, German and Japanese cameras,
English bone china, and other quality goods, cross the street to Caya 

GF Betico Croes. Delft blue pottery and Edam and Gouda cheeses from
Holland are especially good buys.
Two casinos are located just steps from the dock: the elegant, 24-hour
Crystal Casino (at the Aruba Renaissance Beach Resort, L. G. Smith
Blvd. 82; % 297-58-36000), and the less assuming Seaport Casino 
(L. G. Smith Blvd. 9; % 297-58-36000). Both get crowded when ships 
are in port.
Beyond walking distance: If you’re renting wheels or taking a taxi tour,
you can scope the whole range of Aruba’s desert island landscape in a
day. You can reach two of the best beaches on the island, Palm Beach
and Eagle Beach (both along the Turquoise Coast, west of Oranjestad)
via taxi from the cruise terminal for about $8. All of Aruba’s beaches are
public, but chairs and shade huts are hotel property. If you use them,
expect to be charged.
The Alhambra Casino & Aladdin Theatre (J. E. Irausquin Blvd. 47; 
% 297-58-35000) is the island’s busiest casino, with a Moorish theme.
It’s located at the Manchebo Beach Resort, west of Oranjestad.
About 15 miles southeast of Oranjestad, in the center of the island, the
541-foot Hooiberg hill (also known as The Haystack) offers views of
Venezuela if the visibility is good. And you only have to climb 600 steps
to reach the top. Beyond, further into the island’s interior, the building-
size Ayo and Casibari rock formations served Aruba’s early inhabitants
as dwellings or religious sites — nobody’s sure which, though the red-
dish-brown petroglyphs on the boulders suggest mystical significance.
Keep going to the northern (Caribbean side) coast to see the Natural
Bridge, a coral formation more than 100 feet long and 25 feet above sea
level. Crashing surf and whipping wind formed the bridge over the cen-
turies, and now it’s Aruba’s most photographed site. A little to the west,
the hulking ruins of the Bushiribana Gold Smelter offer another photo-
op for folks interested in industrial design. It was built in 1872, and today
its multitiered interior offers great sea views.
Head east on the northern coast to see Arikok National Park, which
covers a full 20 percent of the island. Its most popular attraction is a
series of caves, foremost of which is Fontein Cave, with its brownish-red
drawings left by Amerindians and graffiti etched by early European set-
tlers. Nearby Quadirikiri Cave has two large chambers with roof open-
ings that allow sunlight in, making flashlights unnecessary. Hundreds of
small bats use the 100-foot tunnel to reach their nests deeper in the
cave. Another area cave, 300-foot Baranca Sunu, is more commonly
known as the Tunnel of Love because of its heart-shaped entrance. You
need a flashlight (for rent for $6) to explore.
You can see caves decorated with Arawak artwork — the oldest traces
of human existence on the island — in Savaneta, on the south side of the
island about 25 minutes east of Oranjestad by taxi. The area was also a
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
296

19th-century industrial center for phosphate mining. Until 1985, an
Exxon oil subsidiary refinery operated here. To the east, San Nicolas is
home to Charlie’s Bar and Restaurant (Main Street; % 297-8-45086),
which has served two-fisted drinks and decent food since 1941 in a nos-
talgic setting crammed with pennants, banners, trophies, and other
memorabilia.
The Bahamas
Exotic they’re not. Nassau and Freeport are some of the busiest cruise
ports on the Caribbean circuit, even though technically The Bahamas
aren’t in the Caribbean at all — they’re in the Atlantic, north of the
Caribbean and fewer than 100 miles from Miami. Though holdovers from
Great Britain’s long colonial occupation linger in some architecture and
culture, the vibe here isn’t all that much different from parts of Florida,
and the ports are totally tourist-oriented, with more shopping than at the
Mall of America, all surrounded by beaches, casinos, and golf courses.
English is the official language of The Bahamas. Its legal tender is the
Bahamian dollar (B$1), whose value is always the same as that of the
U.S. dollar. Both currencies are accepted everywhere on the islands.
Cruising into port
In Freeport, ships dock at a dreary port in the middle of nowhere, a $15
taxi ride from Freeport and the International Bazaar, center of most of
the action.
In Nassau, the cruise ship docks are at Prince George Wharf in the
center of town at Rawson Square, in the middle of Nassau’s shopping
frenzy.
Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the excursions below, cruise lines typically offer a variety
of snorkeling, diving, and boat tours.
Dolphin Encounter: Pat a dolphin on the nose! On this excursion from
Freeport, you can watch, touch, and photograph Flipper, or at least one
of his relatives. Organized by Unexso Dolphin Encounter (at Sanctuary
Bay) (31⁄4 hours; $80–$89).
Kayak Nature Tour: Visit a protected island creek, kayak through a man-
grove forest, explore the island’s caves, and take a guided nature walk
into Lucayan National Park. This Freeport excursion includes lunch and
beach time (6 hours; $70–$75).
Harbor Cruise and Atlantis Resort: A tour boat with a local guide
shows you the sights (such as they are) from the water, then drops you
at the fanciful Atlantis Resort in Nassau for a brief tour that includes a
visit to Predator Lagoon, home to sharks, barracuda, and other toothy
fish (21⁄2 hours; $42).
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 297

Thriller Powerboat Tour: A thrill-seeker’s excursion, with high-speed
boats roaring around the waters off Nassau, scaring the hell out of the
fish. Not our personal favorite way to see . . . well, anything, but it sure
is fast (1 hour; $50).
Exploring on your own in Freeport/Lucaya
Freeport/Lucaya on Grand Bahama Island is visited by far fewer ships
than Nassau. Originally intended as two separate developments,
Freeport (the landlocked section of town) and Lucaya (which hugs the
waterfront) have grown together over the years, offering a mix of sun,
surf, golf, tennis, and watersports.
Once you get to Freeport by taxi, you can explore the center of town on
foot. Taxis can also take you to farther-flung attractions. The govern-
ment sets taxi rates, which start at $3 and increase 40¢ for each addi-
tional 1⁄4-mile (plus $3 extra per passenger).
Within walking distance: Nothing of note is within walking distance of
the port. You must take a cab for all attractions.
Beyond walking distance: One of the island’s prime attractions, the 
12-acre Garden of the Groves (% 242-373-5668 or 242-373-1456; www.
gardenofthegroves.com) was once the private meditation garden of
Freeport’s founder, Wallace Groves. The tranquil park features water-
falls, flowering shrubs, about 10,000 trees, tropical birds, Bahamian rac-
coons, Vietnamese potbellied pigs, and West African pygmy goats. It’s
located at the intersection of Midshipman Road and Magellan Drive.
Admission is $10.
A couple of miles east of downtown Freeport on East Settlers Way, the
100-acre Rand Nature Centre (% 242-352-5438) serves as the regional
headquarters of The Bahamas National Trust. Pineland nature trails
meander past native flora and wild birds, including the Bahama parrot.
Admission is $5. Closed weekends.
If you’d like a taste of The Bahamas the way they used to be, head for
the Star Club on the island’s west end (Bayshore Road; % 242-346-6207).
Built in the 1940s, the Star was Grand Bahama’s first hotel, and over the
years it’s hosted many famous guests. Come for the good times and to
mix with the locals, not for the food. Lunch costs $8. Next door, Austin’s
Calypso Bar is a colorful old dive if ever there was one.
Your best bet at this port is to head for the beach. Xanadu, immediately
east of Freeport at the Xanadu Beach Resort, is the premier stretch in the
Lucaya area, offering most watersports equipment. It can get crowded at
times. Taíno Beach, Churchill Beach, and Fortune Beach are all conve-
niently located on the Lucaya oceanfront. A 20-minute ride east of Lucaya,
Gold Rock Beach may be the island’s best. Secluded in Lucayan National
Park, it has barbecue pits, picnic tables, and a spectacular low tide.
Barbary Beach, slightly closer to Lucaya, is great for seashell hunters,
and in May and June white spider lilies in the area bloom spectacularly.

Then again, maybe shopping is the top draw (just shows you how blah
this island is). The International Bazaar, at East Mall Drive and East
Sunrise Highway, next to the Casino at Bahamia, is pure 1960s Bahamian
kitsch, and though relentlessly cheerful, it’s a little long in the tooth. Each
area of the 10-acre, 100-shop complex attempts to capture the ambience
of a different region of the globe. Stereotypes abound. Next door, the
Straw Market features, you guessed it, straw baskets, hats, handbags,
and placemats. The Port Lucaya Marketplace, on Seahorse Road, is a
large shopping-and-dining complex much like the International Bazaar.
Exploring on your own in Nassau
The Nassau/Paradise Island area comprises two separate islands.
Nassau is on the northeastern shore of 21-mile New Providence Island,
while tiny Paradise Island is linked to New Providence by bridges, and
protects Nassau harbor for a 3-mile stretch.
The major attractions and stores are pretty concentrated near the piers,
and if you’re really fit you can even trek over to Cable Beach or Paradise
Island. (Otherwise, you’ll have no problem finding taxis — they’ll find
you.) There’s no good reason to rent a car here.
Within walking distance: As you exit from the cruise ship wharf into
the main port area, you have no choice but to pass through Festival
Place, a barnlike hall full of little shops and stalls. Outside, hawkers
encourage you to have your hair braided at the government-sponsored
Hairbraider’s Centre.
Shopping is the thing here, but there are a few other sites of interest.
Just across Bay Street from Rawson Square (inland from the wharf) are
the flamingo-pink government buildings of Parliament Square, con-
structed in 1815. The House of Assembly, old colonial Secretary’s Office,
and Supreme Court flank a statue of Queen Victoria, while a bust on the
north side of the square honors Sir Milo B. Butler, The Bahamas’ first
governor-general. One block inland, the pink, octagonal Nassau Public
Library was built as a prison in 1798, and today it holds a collection of
books, historical prints, and more.
Slaves carved the Queen’s Staircase out of a solid limestone cliff in 1793.
Originally designed as an escape route for soldiers, each step now repre-
sents a year in Queen Victoria’s 65-year reign. Lush plants and a water-
fall stand guard over the staircase, which is located a few blocks up from
the library on East Street and leads to Fort Fincastle, Elizabeth Avenue,
built in 1793 by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor. An elevator climbs a
38m (126-ft.) water tower, where you can look down on the fort. Walk
around on your own or hire a guide.
If you have kids in tow, the Pirates of Nassau Museum (King and George
Streets; % 242-356-3759; www.pirates-of-nassau.com) is worthwhile.
Admission is a steep $12 for adults — only worth it if you’re with kids, 
as each adult may bring two children under 12 free; each additional
child is $6.

Nassau

Beyond walking distance: About a mile west of downtown Nassau, 
just off West Bay Street, Fort Charlotte is The Bahamas’ largest fort.
Built in 1788, it covers more than 100 hilltop acres and offers impressive
views of Paradise Island, Nassau, and the harbor. Nearby, parading pink
flamingos are the main attraction at the lush, 5-acre Ardastra Gardens
(Chippingham Road; % 242-323-5806; www.ardastra.com). The grace-
ful birds obey the drillmaster’s orders daily at 10:30 a.m., 2:10 p.m., and
4:10 p.m. daily — kids think the whole thing is a hoot. Admission is $12,
$6 children 4 to 12.
If you’re in the mood for some conch, head for Arawak Cay, a small
man-made island across West Bay Street from Ardastra Gardens and Fort
Charlotte. Join the locals in sampling conch with hot sauce, and wash it
down with a cocktail made from coconut water and gin. Farther to the
west, the 3,252-sq.-m (35,000-sq.-ft.) Crystal Palace Casino (West Bay
Street, Cable Beach; % 800-222-7466 or 242-327-6200) is the only casino
on New Providence Island.
On Paradise Island, the towering, fancifully designed Atlantis Paradise
Island megaresort (% 242-363-3000; www.atlantis.com) is the largest
gaming and entertainment complex in the Caribbean, all tied together
with a “Lost City of Atlantis” theme. Outside, the resort’s sprawling 11-
million-gallon lagoon system boasts more than 200 sea species and
50,000 individual creatures. The Dig is a fantastic world of faux Atlantis
ruins flooded by the sea. The interconnected passageways, boulevards,
and chambers, now inhabited by piranhas, hammerhead sharks, sting-
rays, and morays, are visible through huge glass windows.
In general, cruise ship passengers can check out the casino and shops,
but are not permitted in certain areas of the resort (namely the beaches,
the pools, and the breathtaking water slides). If you sign up for the
guided “Discovery Tour,” you can explore The Dig. Tickets, available at
the resort’s guest services desks, are $29 for adults, $21 for children 4 to
12 (3 and under free). Disney and Royal Caribbean passengers only are
also offered a special day-pass to use Atlantis’s beaches.
Other non-Atlantis beaches are on Paradise Island, all just a ferry ride
away from Prince George Wharf. Paradise Beach is $3 for adults and $1
for children, and includes use of a shower and locker. You may also want
to check out smaller beaches as well, including Pirate’s Cove Beach and
Cabbage Beach, the latter of which often fills up with guests of the
nearby resorts.
Five miles from town is Cable Beach, which offers various watersports
and easy access to shops, a casino, bars, and restaurants. Not on the
same level but more convenient for cruise ship passengers, the Western
Esplanade sweeps westward from the Hilton British Colonial hotel, with
changing facilities, restrooms, and a snack bar.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
302

Barbados
In the former British colony of Barbados, cricket is the national pastime,
fish and chips appears on local menus, and people drive on the wrong —
oops, sorry, we mean the left — side of the road. The island is also one of
the most gorgeous in the southern Caribbean, with seemingly endless
stretches of pink- and white-sand beaches, small cottages with well-kept
gardens, and historic parish churches. The most easterly of the Caribbean
islands, its topography varies from rolling hills and savage waves on the
Atlantic coast to densely populated flatlands and the sheltered beach/
resort areas of the southwest. The northeast part of the island is hilly,
with a morning mist that helped it earn the nickname “The Scotland
District.”
Predictably, the shopping area near the cruise port in Bridgetown can
get crowded and noisy. You’re better off making a beeline for the beaches
of the Gold Coast, the island’s western side, with luxury resorts fronting
its calm waters.
English is spoken with an island lilt. The Barbados dollar (BD$) is the
official currency (BD$2.08 = US$1; BD$1 = US50¢), but U.S. dollars are
commonly accepted.
Cruising into port
The island’s cruise terminal is located about a mile from the capital,
Bridgetown, and is a veritable shopping mall, with 25 stores and a fleet
of pushcart vendors selling all the usual: jewelry, watches, electronics,
china, crystal, perfumes, blah blah blah. Goods made on Barbados,
including rum, liquors, and jewelry, are duty-free.
You can walk to town in 15 or 20 minutes via the shoreline park.
Otherwise it’s a $4 taxi ride.
Scoring the best excursions
To get to the best locations in Barbados, you need to catch an excursion
or a taxi.
Harrison’s Cave: Barbados’s most popular attraction, all cruise lines
offer various tours here. See “Exploring on your own” for details 
(2 hours; $49).
Kayak and Turtle Encounter: A boat ride along the west coast brings
you to the beach, where you clamber into your kayak for a 45-minute
paddle along the shore. Once at the snorkel site, you can swim with and
feed sea turtles (31⁄2 hours; $69).
Rainforest Hike and Cave Adventure: A guide leads your group through
one of Barbados’s rain forest gullies, then down into a natural cave 
(4 hours; $74).
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 303

Jolly Roger Booze Cruise: Board the wooden schooner Jolly Roger for a
sail along Barbados’s west coast, with a pirate crew, beach stop, lots of
goofiness (wanna walk the plank?), and lots of booze courtesy of the
open bar (31⁄2 hours; $49).
Atlantis Submarine Adventure: Sail aboard an air-conditioned sub-
mersible to view underwater life, including tropical fish, plants, and an
intact shipwreck (21⁄2 hours; $99 adults, $50 kids).
Exploring on your own
Taxis and car rentals are all available at the cruise terminal. Taxis aren’t
metered, but their rates are fixed by the government. Settle on the fare
before getting in. Buses are frequent and inexpensive (the fare is about
75¢), but they can get crowded at rush hour. As an alternative, look for
minibuses with a “ZR” license plate, which zoom around the island pick-
ing up tourists and locals for about the same price as the bus.
Within walking distance: For some, Bridgetown is within walking dis-
tance; others may opt to take a taxi. Either way, you won’t spend much
time here. For some history, stop in at the Synagogue (Synagogue Lane,
Bridgetown; % 246-432-0840), one of the oldest Jewish houses of wor-
ship in the western hemisphere. Brazilian Jews built the first temple on
this site in 1654; the current building dates to 1833.
Beyond walking distance: The most popular tourist attraction on the
island is Harrison’s Cave (Welchman Hall, St. Thomas; % 246-438-
6640). Electric trams take you down into a series of beautiful coral lime-
stone caverns, full of stalactites, stalagmites, streams, and waterfalls. It’s
about a $20 cab ride from the cruise terminal, and admission costs $13
for adults and $6 for children. Cruise lines typically offer a couple differ-
ent tours that stop here.
Only about a mile from the cave, the Flower Forest (Richmond Plantation,
St. Joseph; % 246-433-8152) is a former sugar plantation that’s now a
junglelike botanical garden, with paths winding among huge tropical
flowers and plants. Admission is $7.50.
You can take a bus to reach the lush, tropical garden known as
Welchman Hall Gully, about 8 miles from St. Thomas (% 246-438-
6671). Some of the plant specimens date back to 1627, when English 
settlers first arrived. For example, they say the ancient breadfruit trees
grew from seedlings brought over by Captain Bligh of Mutiny on the
Bounty fame. Many of the plants are labeled and occasionally you can
spot a wild monkey. Admission is $10.
The 300-year-old Sunbury Plantation House (25 minutes from Bridge-
town along Highway 5; % 246-423-6270) is the only plantation house on
Barbados whose rooms are all open for viewing, featuring mahogany
antiques, old prints, and a collection of horse-drawn carriages. Admission
is $10.

Barbados
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 305
All beaches in Barbados are open to the public, though those on the
Gold Coast (north of Bridgetown) have calmer waters, and are closer to
the port to boot. Paynes Bay, about an $8 cab ride from the port, is
excellent for swimming, snorkeling, and other watersports, but can get
crowded. Directly south of Paynes Bay, even closer to the port, Brighton
Beach, Brandon’s Beach, and Paradise Beach are all fine alternatives,

clustered around Fresh Water Bay. Farther north, Church Point can get
crowded, but it’s one of the most scenic bays in Barbados, and the swim-
ming is ideal.
The British Virgin Islands
Once upon a time, the British Virgin Islands served as a haven for
pirates, but today they’re a haven for sun-seekers. Most of the 40-some
islands that make up the island group are quite small. Cruise ships stop
at the largest three: Tortola, Virgin Gorda (or “Fat Virgin,” so named by
Christopher Columbus, which has got to make you wonder), and the
less-frequented and very rustic Jost Van Dyke.
Treasure Island fans get a kick out of Norman Island, said to be the set-
ting for Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic tale. Legend holds that the
notorious pirate Blackbeard stashed a bottle of rum and marooned 15
men at Deadman Bay on neighboring Peter Island, inspiring the famous
“yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum” ditty.
Although their official name is the British Virgin Islands, the U.S. dollar is
the official currency. Go figure. English is the official language.
Cruising into port
Most large ships sail into Tortola, docking at Wickhams Cay, a pleasant
five-minute walk to Main Street in Road Town. If more than two ships are
in port, the latecomers have to anchor offshore and bring passengers in
by tender. Virgin Gorda doesn’t have a pier or landing facilities for large
ships. Most that stop at Tortola offer excursions to Virgin Gorda instead.
Smaller vessels may anchor offshore and tender passengers in to St.
Thomas Bay, the port area and yacht harbor for Spanish Town. Ferries
from Tortola also berth here. Some small ships visit hilly, 4-square-mile
Jost Van Dyke, tendering passengers in for a beach day.
Scoring the best excursions
Tortola is the only one of the Virgin Islands where it makes sense to take
an excursion — and some of those excursions go to the other Virgin
Islands.
Virgin Gorda and the Baths: Travel by boat from Tortola across the Sir
Francis Drake Channel to Spanish Town, on Virgin Gorda, then board
open-air buses to the Baths for sunning, swimming, and snorkeling amid
mammoth boulders and sea caves (for more details, see “Exploring on
your own in Virgin Gorda,” later in this chapter). Includes a Caribbean-
style buffet lunch (4 hours; $62).
Town and Country Excursion: Tour Tortola in an open-air minibus, visit-
ing the Botanical Gardens, Cane Garden Bay, Bomba’s Full Moon Party
Shack, and Soper’s Hole (for more description, see the next section,
“Exploring on your own in Tortola”) (31⁄2 hours; $34).

The British Virgin Islands

Tortola Snorkeling Adventure: Cross the Sir Frances Drake Channel by
boat to Norman Island, one of the BVI’s prime snorkel sites, full of coral
formations, colorful fish, and a group of caves at Treasure Point, where
pirate loot is said to have been hidden (21⁄2 hours; $48).
Forest Walk and Beach Tour: Safari buses take you to Tortola’s interior
for a mile-long hike through the Sage Mountain rain forest to the highest
point in the Virgin Islands, followed by a brief stop at the Botanical
Gardens (31⁄2 hours; $35).
Exploring on your own in Tortola
Tortola is the largest and busiest of the British Virgin Islands. Its capital,
Road Town, is a popular yachting center as well as the port for cruise
ships. The rest of the southern coast is characterized by rugged moun-
tain peaks, while the north coast has beautiful white-sand beaches
fringed with palm trees, bananas, and mangoes.
Whether your ship docks or tenders passengers in, you end up right in
town, about a five-minute walk to Main Street. Open-air and sedan-style
taxis meet every arriving ship to carry passengers to the beaches and
other attractions. Fares are set, so ask what you’ll pay before you get in.
If you want to rent a car, Budget, Hertz, and Avis all have offices here.
Within walking distance: You can walk from the pier to Tortola’s Main
Street, which has a relatively quiet shopping area by Caribbean stan-
dards, although you can get some good bargains on duty-free British
goods such as English china. Across from the dock on the waterfront is
Pusser’s Road Town Pub (% 284-494-3897), with an extensive menu
and the infamous Pusser’s Rum, which was served aboard British Navy
ships for over 300 years. The attached company store offers a selection
of clothing and other logo items, some pretty cool.
Beyond walking distance: Drive or take a taxi to 92-acre Mount Sage
National Park, where the namesake mountain soars to a magnificent
1,780 feet amid a lush tropical rain forest setting, which you can explore
via nature trails. (You can pick up a trail map at the tourist office in the
center of Road Town near the dock just south of Wickhams Cay.) The
park was established in 1964 to protect what was left of Tortola’s origi-
nal forests, following the depredations of the plantation era.
Most of Tortola’s beaches are a 20-minute taxi ride from the cruise dock,
costing about $15 per person each way. Discuss price with the driver
before setting out, and ask him to pick you up later, in time to get back
to the ship. The best beach is at Cane Garden Bay on the island’s north-
west side, across the mountains from Road Town but worth the trip.
Surfers like Apple Bay, also on the northwest side, while next-door
Cappoon’s Bay is known more for Bomba’s Surfside Shack (% 284-495-
4148), a legendary island bar built from what looks like scrap lumber
and covered in day-glo graffiti. Painkillers — one of the Caribbean’s 
legendary rum drinks — are a specialty. If you want to snorkel, the best
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
308

beaches on Tortola are Smugglers Cove, on the western tip, and Brewer’s
Bay, on the northwest side.
Exploring on your own in Virgin Gorda
Instead of heading for Tortola, some smaller ships anchor outside of
Virgin Gorda and bring visitors ashore by tender. You have to take a taxi
to get there, but The Baths is the most popular beach destination on the
island, looking like something Frank Gehry would have designed had he
lived during the Neolithic age. It’s a group of house-sized boulders, which
geologists believe toppled onto one another as a result of ice-age erup-
tions, forming the dramatic shapes and saltwater grottoes we see today.
It’s an enormously fun area to swim around and explore, crawling under
and between huuuuge boulders that you just know are going to fall over
and crush you, but of course don’t. A cafe sits just above the beach.
Spring Bay, just north of The Baths, is a great white-sand beach with
clear water and good snorkeling. Farther north still, Trunk Bay is a wide
sand beach reachable via a rough path from Spring Bay. Devil’s Bay, just
south of The Baths, is a less crowded swimming option.
Exploring on your own in Jost Van Dyke
Jost Van Dyke is visited mostly by private yachts and a few small cruise
ships such as those of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, which often throws
afternoon beach parties on the beach at White Bay. If your ship stays late,
head to Foxy’s (% 284-495-9258), a legendary beach bar at the far end of
Great Harbour. It’s a scene.
Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, Mexico
Woooo-ey, is Cozumel ever a busy place. Located just off Mexico’s
Yucatán coast, it gets up to 16 ships visiting every single day during high
season. Do the math; that’s something like 25,000 cruise passengers
tromping down the gangways. Zowie. The island’s main town, San Miguel
(located on the island’s western shore, where the best resorts and
beaches are also found), is tourist central, with hundreds of stores, bars,
and restaurants strung out along its waterfront and side streets. Get
beyond the tourist zone, though, and things calm way down.
Playa del Carmen, on the mainland, is much quieter, with a small but
expanding shopping district, some trendy boutiques and hip restau-
rants, and beaches. Mostly it’s a jumping-off point for excursions and
treks to the mainland’s main draws: the Mayan ruins of Tulum, Chichén
Itzá, and Cobá, plus a couple of water parks. Some ships spend one day
in Cozumel and the next in Playa, though more frequently they just run
boats from Cozumel to the mainland, 45 minutes away. There’s also a
regular ferry service, if you want to go on your own.
In recent years, a handful of other Yucatán ports have come onto the
scene, including Calica, just south of Playa; Costa Maya, about 161km
(100 miles) south near the sleepy fishing village of Mahajual; and
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 309

Progreso, on the Gulf coast of the Yucatán, making it the closest to both
Chichén Itzá and the city of Merida. Costa Maya is the most elaborate of
the three, with shopping, entertainment, beaches and beach bars, and
activities. The others are little more than piers giving easier access to
the other Yucatán attractions.
Spanish is the language of Mexico, although English is spoken by nearly
everyone you deal with in the tourist zone. The Mexican currency is the
nuevo peso (new peso). Its symbol is the “$” sign, but the exchange rate
is about $11 pesos to US$1 ($1 peso = about US9¢). The main tourist
stores accept U.S. dollars.
Cruising into port
Cruise ship berths are scattered all along the coast of San Miguel. The
newest is Punta Langosta, in the center of town, just steps from the
action and about a quarter mile from the ferries to Playa del Carmen.
Other berths are at the International Pier (2 miles south of San Miguel)
or the Puerto Maya pier (a little farther still). Both are about a $6 taxi
ride from town. Beaches are closest to the International Pier.
Scoring the best excursions
The Mayan ruins on the mainland are, in our opinion, an absolute must.
Because all ruins involve some traveling (especially from Cozumel), we
recommend visiting as part of an excursion. In addition to the ruins,
cruise lines always offer snorkeling, horseback riding, booze-cruising,
folkloric shows, dolphin swims, submarine and scuba dives, ATV off-
roading, bicycle treks, parasailing, kayaking, fishing, and more.
Tulum Mayan Ruins/Xel-Ha: About a 30-minute drive from Playa del
Carmen, the small walled city of Tulum is usually the only ruin of conse-
quence you can visit if you’re coming from Cozumel. It was the only
Mayan city built right on the coast (it’s backed by sea cliffs) and the only
one still inhabited when the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 1500s.
In the company of a trained guide, you visit some of the 60 individual
structures, including a temple to Kukulkán, the primary Mayan/Olmec
god. The Tulum tour is sold either on its own (61⁄2 hours; $75) or in com-
bination with a visit to the Xel-Ha Eco Park (8 hours; $99), a natural
lagoon where you can drift from one end to the other in an inner tube,
accompanied by schools of tropical fish. Snorkeling gear is available, as
is a swim-with-dolphins option (for an extra cost).
Chichén Itzá: The most fabled of the Yucatán ruins, Chichén Itzá was
founded in A.D. 445 and at its height was home to about 50,000 residents.
All told, it’s absolutely huge, covering an area of 7 square miles, though
tours visit only a fraction of that, which is enough. The best known of
Chichén Itzá’s ruins is the magnificent El Castillo pyramid (also called
the Pyramid of Kukulkán), with four 91-step outside stairways leading up
to a central platform. Do the math and the steps add up to the number
of days in the solar year (91×4 = 364, plus one for the central platform).

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 311

On the spring and fall equinoxes, light striking the pyramid gives the 
illusion of a snake slithering down the steps to join its gigantic stone
head mounted at the base. Those Mayans knew what they were doing.
Typical tours also visit a sports court where the captain of the losing (or
winning — nobody knows) team was sacrificed to the gods. Other stops
include a well where virgins were sacrificed, and a temple where (guess!)
other folks were sacrificed. They were big on sacrifices, those Mayans.
Kidding aside, it’s an absolutely incredible place, and one of the best
excursions we’ve ever taken. Due to its distance into the Yucatán inte-
rior, this tour is typically offered only by ships calling at one of the main-
land ports (12 hours; $149).
Cobá: A 35-minute drive inland from Tulum puts you at Cobá, once the
commercial hub of the Mayan civilization, flourishing from A.D. 300 to
1000. Today, more than 3,500 structures have been identified on its
grounds, which are bounded by four natural lakes. Excavation work
began in 1972, but only a fraction of the city has been reclaimed from 
the jungle. Cobá’s pyramid, Nohoch Mul, is the tallest in the Yucatán.
Excursions travel here from both Cozumel and Playa (8 hours; $89).
Xcaret: From Cozumel, you transfer by ferry to Playa del Carmen then
by bus to this unique eco-archaeological theme park, whose name is pro-
nounced ish-car-et. You have about 31⁄2 hours on site to enjoy the park’s
blue lagoons, lazy rivers, botanical gardens, aviary, aquarium, and cul-
tural performances. The highlight of this visit is the underground river
tour, which involves donning a float-vest and letting a gentle current
carry you along a crystal river through an underground cave. This tour
is offered from both Cozumel and Playa (8 hours; $88).
Exploring on your own in Cozumel
Depending on where you dock, you can either walk right into the tourist
throng or take a short taxi ride to it — or away from it, depending on
your preference. The typical fare from the farthest piers to downtown
San Miguel is about $6. From San Miguel to most resorts and beaches is
usually between $10 and $15. Be sure to settle on the fare before you
start out. Many passengers also rent mopeds from one of many, many
vendors. The cost is usually about $30 to $35 per day, including helmet.
To get far away, you can take the ferry from Cozumel and Playa del
Carmen for $9 per person. The crossing takes approximately 45 minutes.
Within walking distance: The things to do in central San Miguel are
shopping and drinking, both of which can easily be done on foot —
either solidly or canted sideways, depending on how much you imbibe.
Avenida Rafael Melgar runs along the waterfront and is chockablock
with shops, bars, and restaurants. Ditto for the streets around the Plaza
del Sol, which lies just behind Avenida Melgar, at the foot of the ferry
pier. Shops sell the usual tourist goods, Mexican crafts, and especially
silver jewelry, which is generally sold by weight. Prices are relatively
high, but you can and should bargain. If you dock at the International
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
312

Pier, a bunch of nice shops in the terminal sell everything from Mexican
blankets to jewelry, T-shirts, and handicrafts of all kinds. The pier at
Puerta Maya also has a number of well-stocked gift shops.
The most iconic of the downtown bars — for better or worse — is
Carlos ’n Charlie’s (Av. Rafael Melgar 551; % 987-869-1446; www.
carlosn-charlies.com). It’s like a Mexican Hard Rock Cafe, with 
about as much authenticity.
If that’s not your scene, you can drop into the small Museo de la Isla de
Cozumel (on Rafael Melgar between Calles 4 and 6 N; % 987-872-1475).
The building, which began life as Cozumel’s first luxury hotel, houses
two floors of historical exhibits, from pre-Hispanic times to the present.
Admission is $3.
Beyond walking distance: The Chankanaab Nature Park (www.
cozumelparks.com.mx) is a wildlife sanctuary, archaeological park, cul-
tural park, and water park all in one. Just 10 minutes from the downtown
pier by taxi (about $10–$12), you can swim in a saltwater lagoon with a
beautiful powder-white beach, snorkel or scuba among fish-filled off-
shore reefs (equipment rentals are available), stroll through the botani-
cal garden (home to more than 800 plant species), walk around a replica
Mayan village, go to the interactive archaeological museum, take in a sea
lion show, or see dolphins perform at the Dolphinarium. To swim with
the dolphins, make reservations in advance at Dolphin Discovery in
Cancún (% 998-849-4757; www.dolphindiscovery.com/cozumel).
Park admission is $12 adults, $6 kids 3 to 11. Dolphin swims are $119.
Mayan ruins on Cozumel are very minor compared to those on the main-
land, but if you’re driving around you can visit San Gervasio (north of
San Miguel), once a ceremonial center and capital, and El Cedral (to the
south), site of a Mayan arch and a few small ruins covered in heavy
growth. Cozumel’s best beach, Playa San Francisco, is only 2 miles from
El Cedral. Another mile or so south is Playa del Sol, one of the island’s
more popular and crowded beaches.
Exploring on your own in Playa del Carmen
Within walking distance: Playa del Carmen is much more low-key than
Cozumel. From the ferry dock you can walk to the white-sand beach or
explore the ever-expanding shopping district, which has numerous
shops, bars, and restaurants. For shopping, stroll the Rincon del Sol, a
tree-lined Mexican colonial-style courtyard with some appealing local
handicrafts stores.
Beyond walking distance: For all attractions beyond town, see
“Scoring the best excursions,” earlier in this section.
Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles
Curaçao (pronounced coo-ra-sow) is the largest and most populous of
the Netherlands Antilles — the so-called ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire,
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 313

Curaçao) located about 35 miles north of the Venezuelan coast. A Dutch
possession since the 17th century, it has served over the years as a trad-
ing post, oil-refining center, and tourist destination. Today, it retains its
Dutch flavor, especially in the capital of Willemstad. When your ship
arrives at Willemstad’s harbor, you can watch the town’s famous floating
bridge swing aside and invite you into a narrow channel, where rows of
centuries-old pastel-colored homes create a fairy-tale effect. According
to local lore, the houses were originally painted white, but were so blind-
ingly bright in the hot Caribbean sun that the first Dutch colonial gover-
nors ordered them painted in softer, vibrant colors. Contrasting with
this quaint and colorful architecture, the rest of the desertlike island
may remind you of the southwestern United States.
Dutch, Spanish, and English are all spoken on Curaçao. The official cur-
rency is the Netherlands Antillean florin (NAf), also called a guilder (US$1
= 1.77 NAf; 1 NAf = US56¢). Most places accept U.S. dollars for purchases.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock in Willemstad at a megapier just beyond the Queen
Emma pontoon bridge. It has a tourist information booth, car rental
agencies, duty-free shopping, and workshop space for local artists. Just
beyond the bridge is the famous Floating Market (see below). The adja-
cent fort houses Riffort Village, a shopping/entertainment complex.
Scoring the best excursions
Animal Encounter Scuba Adventure: Suit up in scuba gear and explore
a shallow natural tidal pool at the edge of a colorful reef. There’s a fence
between you and those sharks and sea turtles, but you can feed them
through holes. Meanwhile, on your side of the fence, you can interact
with stingrays, parrotfish, and other marine life. Because the water is
so shallow, scuba certification isn’t required (4 hours; $89)
Spanish Water Canoe and Snorkeling: Board canoes at Caracas Bay
Island for a 45-minute paddle alongside mangroves and rock formations.
At Baya Beach, instructors lead snorkeling excursions over a sunken tug-
boat (31⁄2 hours; $69).
Exploring on your own
From the pier, it’s just a five- to ten-minute walk across the Queen Emma
pontoon bridge to the city’s principal shopping and business areas. You
can “do” Willemstad on foot in two or three hours. which leaves you
plenty of time for beaches or watersports. Taxi drivers waiting at the
cruise dock can take you to any of the beaches. Fares are fixed, so ask
the driver what the rate to your destination is before you set out. If you
want him to pick you up again later, just inquire. If you want a taxi tour,
you can share with up to four passengers total for about $30 per hour.
You can also get around the island by two kinds of buses. Take either a
van (easily recognizable by the word BUS on the license plate) or one of
the yellow or blue buses called konvoi. Yellow buses run from Wilhelmina
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
314

Plein (near the shopping center) to most parts of the island. Fares to any
point are under $2.
Within walking distance: Boats from Venezuela, Colombia, and other
Caribbean islands dock at the Floating Market, a short walk from the
Queen Emma pontoon bridge. Here, amid a bustling crowd, vendors sell
fresh fish, tropical fruits, spices, and crafts. Nearby, you can trace the
island’s history through the exhibits at the Curaçao Maritime Museum
(Van den Brandhof Street; % 5999-465-2327; www.curacaomaritime.
com). Admission is about $6. A guided harbor tour by boat is $12, includ-
ing museum admission.

The oldest Jewish congregation in the New World gathers in the 1651
Mikve Israel Emanuel Synagogue (at the corner of Columbusstraat and
Hanchi Snog). White sand covers the floor, symbolic of the desert that
the early Israelites roamed. Next door, the Jewish Cultural Historical
Museum (Hanchi Snoa 29; % 599-9-461-1633; www.snoa.com) is housed
in two buildings dating from 1728. They were the rabbi’s residence and
the mikvah (bath) for religious purification purposes. Entry is through
the synagogue and admission is about $2.
The Curaçao Museum (Van Leeuwenhoekstraat; % 599-9-462-3873) is
housed in a restored 1853 building constructed by the Royal Dutch Army
as a military hospital. Today, it displays paintings, objets d’art, and
antique furniture, as well as a large collection from the Caiquetio tribes.
Admission is about $3.
Housed in a former slave yard and prison, Museum Kura Hulanda
(Klipstraat 9; % 5999-434-7765; www.kurahulanda.com) is an anthropo-
logical museum that focuses on the predominant cultures of Curaçao,
chronicling the African slave trade, West African empires, pre-Colombian
gold, Mesopotamian relics, and Antillean art. You reach the museum via
small boats that cross the harbor. Admission is about $5.50.
Beyond walking distance: Home to more than 400 species of fish and
plant life, the Curaçao Seaquarium (off Bhpor Kibra, just east of
Willemstad; % 599-9-465-8900; www.curacao-sea-aquarium.com)
offers divers, snorkelers, and experienced swimmers a chance to feed,
film, and photograph sharks, stingrays, lobsters, and other marine life in
a controlled environment. If you don’t swim, a 46-foot semi-submersible
observatory enables you to watch the underwater action. If you don’t 
do semi-submersibles, the Seaquarium also maintains the island’s only
full-facility, palm-shaded, sugar-white beach. The facility is about a ten-
minute, $8 cab ride from Queen Emma pontoon bridge. Admission is $15
for adults and $7.50 for children under 14.
A 40-minute taxi ride west of Willemstad, you can see cacti, bromeliads,
rare orchids, iguanas, donkeys, wild goats, and many species of birds in
4,500-acre Christoffel National Park (near the northwestern tip of
Curaçao; % 599-9-864-0363). The park rises from flat, arid countryside
to 1,230-foot St. Christoffelberg, the tallest point in the Dutch Leewards.
Hiking along several trails to the top of the mountain, you find Arawak
paintings and the Piedra di Monton, a rock heap piled by African slaves
who cleared this former plantation. Legend says slaves could climb to
the top of the rock pile, jump off, and fly back home across the Atlantic
to Africa. The park has 20 miles of one-way trail-like roads for driving
tours and several hiking trails that go to the top of the mountain. It takes
about 11⁄2 hours to walk to the top. Admission is $9.
Next to Christoffel National Park, National Park Shete Boka (Seven
Inlets in the Papiamentu language) encompasses rugged seaside cliffs
carved in dramatic patterns. The highlight is Boka Tabla, a wide cavern
carved by millions of years of pounding surf. The place is also a turtle
sanctuary. Admission is about $1.50.

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 317
If you want to explore the island’s deeper side, head to Hato Caves 
(F. D. Rooseveltweg; % 599-9-868-0379). Originally a coral reef, the lime-
stone formations were created over thousands of years by water seeping
through the coral and pushing it upward. After crossing the lake, you
enter two caverns known as “The Cathedral” and La Ventana (“The
Window”), where you see samples of ancient Indian petroglyphs. Local
guides take visitors through every hour. Admission is $6.25 for adults,
$4.75 for kids under 13.
Honeymooners and other couples can snuggle on a blanket at one of
Curaçao’s 38 beautiful beaches. The better ones are Santa Barbara
Beach, south of Willemstad; Blauwbaai (Blue Bay), just west of the city;
and Playa Abao, Knip Bay, and other stretches way up near the island’s
western tip.
Dominica
Tiny Dominica (pronounced dome-ee-nee-ka), sandwiched between
Guadeloupe and Martinique, is the most lush and mountainous island in
the eastern Caribbean. About 29 miles long and 16 wide, it’s blessed with
astonishing natural wonders, including lush rain forests, crystal-pure
rivers, and dramatic waterfalls. Volcanic coral reefs, every bit as biologi-
cally complex as the rain forests onshore, ring the island, and a bit far-
ther from land, whales mate and calve. No wonder they call this “the
nature island of the Caribbean.” On the downside, the island’s capital,
Roseau, is a little rough around the edges, and the island’s shore lacks
the kind of sugar-white beaches many folks associate with the Caribbean.
That isn’t the point of Dominica, though. Here, it’s all about nature, with
a little bit of the most authentic Caribbean culture mixed in: up in the
island’s northeast live about 3,000 Carib Indians, the last remaining
descendants of the people who dominated the region when Europeans
arrived, and gave it its name.
The Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.72 = US$1; EC$1 = US37¢) is the offi-
cial currency, but merchants accept the U.S. dollar virtually everywhere.
The official language is English, but most people also speak Creole.
Cruising into port
Dominica has two cruise ship ports. The most frequented is in the heart
of Roseau, the country’s capital and largest town, with banks, restau-
rants, a market, a tourism office, and the Dominica Museum all within
spitting distance. The other is near the northwestern town of Portsmouth,
closer to attractions such as Cabrits National Park and Fort Shirley (see
“Exploring on your own,” later in this chapter).
Scoring the best excursions
Trafalgar Falls and Emerald Pool Nature Tour: Drive to Morne Bruce
for a panoramic view of Roseau and visit the Botanical Gardens. Proceed
to a lookout point for a fantastic view of Trafalgar Falls before driving
into the interior, where you walk 15 minutes along a relatively easy trail

to the Emerald Pool, named for the moss-covered boulders that enclose
it. You can swim if you like, floating on your back under the rain forest
canopy and 50-foot waterfall (31⁄2 hours; $45).
Home of the Carib Indians: Located on Dominica’s northeastern coast,
the 3,700-acre Carib Territory is home to the world’s last surviving pop-
ulation of Carib Indians. The Caribs today live like most other rural
islanders — growing bananas and coconuts, fishing, and operating small
shops — but they maintain cultural and artistic traditions that bind
them to their past. On your visit, the tribe’s chief will acquaint you with
Carib history, and you’ll see a performance by the Karifuna Cultural
Group (5 hours; $54).
Dominica by Jeep and Swimming at the Titou Gorge: A jeep convoy
heads up Morne Bruce for a picturesque view, stopping at the Botanical
Gardens and the Wotten Waven Sulpher Springs before arriving at the
volcanic Titou Gorge for a swim among sheer 20-foot black walls, rock
outcrops, caves, and a thundering waterfall (31⁄2 hours; $99).
Layou Gorge River Tubing: Tubing guides take you downriver through
the Layou Valley, lined with tall, overhanging cliffs and lush vegetation 
(3 hours; $64).
Kayak and Snorkel Safari: A guided kayaking trip takes you from
Soufrière to your snorkeling site at Scotts Head. The bay here is home 
to an amazing amount of marine life and coral, and it’s common to see
dolphins and frigate birds feeding (31⁄2 hours; $59).
Exploring on your own
Fleets of taxis and public minivans await cruise ship passengers at the
dock. All are designated by a “HA” or “H” on the license plate. Drivers
are generally knowledgeable about sites and history, and the standard
sightseeing rate is from $20 per site per person. The vehicles are
unmetered, so negotiate a price in advance.
Within walking distance: On the bay front at the dock in Roseau is the
Dominica Museum, located in an old market house dating from 1810. Its
permanent exhibit illustrates the island’s geology, history, archeology,
economy, and culture. Admission is $3. Behind the museum is Old
Market Square, where merchants have gathered for centuries. At one
time, it was also the site for executions, slave auctions, and political ral-
lies. Now, you find Dominican crafts and souvenirs for sale. The Public
Market Place, at the mouth of the Roseau River and to your left as you
leave the ship, is the town’s commercial hub. Expect it to be especially
jumping on Saturday mornings when farmers and countryside vendors
display fruits, vegetables, and flowers.
On the eastern edge of Roseau, also within walking distance of the
docks, the Botanical Gardens lie at the base of Morne Bruce, the moun-
tain overlooking the town. The gardens were established at the end of
the 19th century, and about 150 of the 500 original species of trees and

shrubs remain. Keep your eyes out for the Carib Wood tree, whose red
blossom is the island’s national flower (in bloom Mar–May).
The cruise ship dock at Portsmouth leads directly to the 260-acre
Cabrits National Park (it takes 45–60 minutes to drive here from the
Roseau dock, and a cab is $60). The park boasts dazzling mountain
scenery, tropical forests, swamplands, volcanic sand beaches, coral
reefs, and the ruins of Fort Shirley, an 18th-century garrison. Some of
the park has been partly reconstructed, and look for stone walls and
cannons hidden among vegetation along the trails. Previous visitors to
the area have included Christopher Columbus, Sir Francis Drake,

Admiral Horatio Nelson, and John Smith, who stopped here on his way
to Virginia to found Jamestown. You can spend a whole day touring the
park, so wear good walking shoes. Admission is $2.
Beyond walking distance: About 15 to 20 minutes by cab from Roseau
is Trafalgar Falls, two separate cascades that tumble side by side. A
short trail from the road brings you to a viewing platform where you see
the two falls converge into rocky pools. You can take a dip in the brisk
water at the base of the falls, but be careful, the rocks are slippery.
Emerald Pool is located deep in the rain forest, not far from the center
of the island. Expect about a 40-minute drive from Roseau. After you
walk 15 minutes along a flat trail shaded by magnificent trees, you reach
a 50-foot waterfall that crashes into the pool, which is named for the
moss-covered boulders that enclose it. It’s like a natural cathedral —
except you can’t swim around in most cathedrals.
Another swimming spot that beckons visitors is Titou Gorge, near the
village of Laudat, northeast of Roseau. The water-filled canyon snakes
along to the base of a waterfall. The flow is quite strong, and at times,
you may feel like a salmon swimming upstream. A hot mineral cascade
at the canyon’s mouth relieves sore muscles. From Roseau to Laudat is
about a 30-minute drive.
Beaches — featuring plenty of rocks and dark, volcanic sand — are not
Dominica’s strong point, but the island’s top choices are Hampstead
Beach, Hodges Beach, L’Ance Noire, and Woodford Bay, all on the
northern coast, about 20 minutes from Roseau.
Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands
Mostly scrubland and swamp, Grand Cayman and its sister islands
(Cayman Brac and Little Cayman) are anything but lush. Still, the island
boasts its share of upscale, expensive private homes and condos, owned
by millionaire expatriates from all over who come because of the tiny
nation’s lenient tax and banking laws. For tourists, Grand Cayman is
known most for what’s offshore — spectacular coral reefs that make for
some really great diving and snorkeling. The island also has a nice
stretch of sand, Seven Mile Beach, that fronts a strip of high-rise hotels.
If all you care about is shopping, you’re in luck. George Town, the British
colony’s capital and place where you’ll land when your ship calls here,
has its fair share of brand-name stores.
In 2004, Hurricane Ivan tore through Grand Cayman, causing substantial
flooding, destroying many homes and businesses, and severely damag-
ing power and sewage networks. Things were such a mess that the
island was officially closed to tourists for two months. However, with
tourism accounting for some 45 percent of the Caymans’ GDP, cleanup
was swift. Ships began returning in late November, and at press time
things were more or less back to normal.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why

English is the official language of the islands. The legal tender is the
Cayman Islands dollar (CI82¢ = US$1; CI$1 = US$1.22), but U.S. dollars
are commonly accepted. Be sure to note which currency price tags refer
to before making a purchase.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships anchor off George Town and ferry their passengers to a pier
on Harbour Drive, right in the midst of George Town’s thriving shopping
district.
If seas are choppy, which happens fairly often, the piers may be closed
and your cruise may be forced to skip the port altogether.
Scoring the best excursions
Stingray City: The waters off Grand Cayman are home to Stingray
City, one of the world’s wackiest underwater attractions. Set in the
very shallow waters of North Sound, about 2 miles east of the island’s

northwestern tip, the site was discovered in the mid-1980s when local
fishermen noticed that scores of stingrays were showing up to feed on
the offal they dumped overboard. Today, anywhere from 30 to 100 rela-
tively tame stingrays swarm around the hundreds of oohing and aahing
snorkelers like so many aquatic basset hounds, eager for handouts.
Stingrays are terribly gentle creatures, and love to have their bellies
rubbed, but never try to grab one by the tail — their barbed stingers can
inflict a lot of pain (2–3 hours; $49–$59).
Atlantis Deep-Dive Submarine: A real research sub takes two passen-
gers at a time down to 800 feet to explore the Cayman Wall through a 
3-foot viewing window. Powerful lights illuminate the sponge belt at 400
feet, and delicate coral and deep-sea creatures can be sighted even far-
ther down (11⁄2 hours, including a 55-minute dive; $399).
Atlantis Submarine: For less dough, a 48-passenger sub takes you down
to 100 feet through coral canyons, with an automatic fish feeder drawing
swarms of colorful marine creatures (11⁄2 hours, including a 45-minute
dive; $95).
Grand Cayman by Bicycle: Hop on a bike to work off all that cruise
food, and check out the island’s coastline to boot. Pick up your touring
mountain bike at the Beach Club Colony Hotel, ride along the coastline
for views of Seven Mile Beach, and then journey inland en route to the
north side of the island to ride along the coast again (3 hours; $59).
Exploring on your own
Taxis line up at the pier to meet cruise ship passengers. Fares are fixed;
typical one-way fares range from $12 to $20. Motor scooters and bicycles
are another way to get around. Soto Scooters Ltd. (Seven Mile Beach at
Coconut Place; % 345-945-4465) offers Honda Elite scooters and bicy-
cles for about $30 and $15 daily.
Within walking distance: Hey, like, it isn’t only about shopping. In
George Town, check out the small but interesting Cayman Islands
National Museum (Harbour Drive; % 345-949-8368; www.museum.ky).
Exhibits include Caymanian artifacts collected by Ira Thompson (begin-
ning in the 1930s), and other items relating to the natural, social, and
cultural history of the Caymans. Admission is $5 ($2.50 seniors); closed
Sundays.
Beyond walking distance: The only green-sea-turtle farm of its kind in
the world, Cayman Turtle Farm, at Northwest Point, just beyond the
town of Hell (% 345-949-3894; www.turtle.ky), is the island’s most
popular land-based tourist attraction. Once a multitude of turtles lived
in the waters surrounding the Cayman Islands (in fact, Christopher
Columbus called the islands Las Tortugas because there were so many),
but today these creatures are endangered. The turtle farm’s purpose is
twofold: to replenish the waters with hatchlings and yearling turtles, and
to provide the local market with edible turtle meat. You can peer into
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
322

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 323
100 circular concrete tanks containing turtles ranging in size from
6 ounces to 600 pounds, and sample turtle dishes at a snack bar and
restaurant. Admission is $6.
And now, we’d like to tell you to go to Hell! Now don’t get all offended
on us; it’s actually the name of a little town and a great place to buy
some souvenir T-shirts for your most despised friends back home. You
can also mail your postcards from here for the snarky postmark.
If you just want to flop on a towel and fry your skin, head for Seven Mile
Beach, a strip of white sand just north of George Town. Lined with con-
dominiums and plush resorts, it’s an easy taxi ride from the cruise dock.
Watersports are available, and so are lots of lunch places.
Do the right thing and don’t purchase turtle or black-coral products.
You’ll see them everywhere, but it’s illegal to bring them back into the
United States and most other Western nations.
Grenada
One of Heidi’s favorite Caribbean ports of call, this one-time British
Crown Colony offers a little bit of everything — history, lush jungles, and
great beaches. And it’s not overrun with tourists. Plus, maybe you didn’t
know Grenada (pronounced gre-nay-dah) produces more spices than
anywhere else in the world — including clove, cinnamon, mace, cocoa,
tonka beans, ginger, and a third of the world’s nutmeg — and thus its
nickname, the Spice Island. St. George’s, the country’s capital, is one of
the most colorful ports in the West Indies, nearly landlocked in the deep
crater of a long-dead volcano, full of charming Georgian colonial build-
ings, and flanked by old forts. The island’s coast is white and sandy; its
interior is a jungle of palms, oleander, bougainvillea, and other tropical
foliage, crisscrossed by roads and trails.
Grenada was one of the hardest hit Caribbean islands during 2004’s 
devastating hurricane season. Almost every building sustained some
level of damage, but you can’t keep a good island down. Known for its
lushness and most extravagant fertility (results of a gentle climate and
volcanic soil), Grenada started springing back almost immediately, its
coastal greenery growing back rapidly and its rain forests filling out a
little more slowly.
English is commonly spoken on this island, and the official currency is
the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$2.70 = US$1; EC$1 = US37¢), though
dollars are accepted commonly. Always determine which dollars — EC
or U.S. — you’re talking about when discussing a price.
You might remember when the U.S. military invaded the island in 1983 in
one of its more bizarre Cold War excursions. But no worries, the likeli-
hood of a superpower invading this tiny, harmless Grenada any time
soon is pretty darn low.

Cruising into port
Ships either dock at a pier right in St. George’s or anchor in the much-
photographed harbor and send their passengers to the pier by tender.
The Carenage (St. George’s main street) is only a short walk away from
the pier.
Scoring the best excursions
Because of Grenada’s lush landscape, we recommend spending at least a
few hours touring its interior, one of the most scenic in the West Indies.
Hike to Seven Sisters Waterfalls: After a 40-minute hike along a muddy
path in the lush Grand Etang rain forest, passengers are free to take a
swim in the natural pools or hop off the edge of the cascading waterfalls.
It’s gorgeous and lots of fun. Don’t forget to wear your bathing suit and
maybe a pair of water-friendly sandals (31⁄2 hours; $59).
Island Tour, Grand Etang Lake, and Fort Frederick: This is a great way
to experience Grenada’s lush, cool, dripping-wet tropical interior. Via
bus, you travel past the red-tiled roofs of St. George’s en route to the
bright blue Grand Etang Lake, within an extinct volcanic crater some
570m (1,900 ft.) above sea level. On the way, you drive through rain
forests and stop at a spice estate. Some tours include a visit to
Annandale Falls and Fort Frederick (41⁄2 hours; $44).
Exploring on your own
Taxi fares are set by the government. A one-way taxi to Grand Anse (one
of the Caribbean’s best beaches) is about $15 for up to four passengers.
You can also tap most taxi drivers as a guide for a day’s sightseeing, for
about $25 per hour. Water taxis also head from the cruise ship welcome
center to Grand Anse. Round-trip fare is about $4.
Within walking distance: If you’re up for a good hike and some awe-
some photo ops, walk around the historical Carenage from the cruise
terminal in St. George’s and head up to Fort George, built in 1705 by the
French and originally called Fort Royal. While the fort ruins and the 200-
to 300-year-old cannons are worth a peek, the 360-degree panoramic
views of the entire harbor area are spectacular. You can pick up a rudi-
mentary walking-tour map from the cruise terminal to help you find
interesting sites along the way.
In town, you can also visit the Grenada National Museum (Young and
Monckton Streets; % 473-440-3725), set in the foundations of an old
French army barracks and prison built in 1704. Small but interesting,
check out stuff such as Joséphine Bonaparte’s bathtub from her girl-
hood in Martinique. Admission is $1.
Church Street, which leads right to the fort, has lots of quaint 18th- and
19th-century architecture as well as several 19th-century cathedrals and
the island’s Houses of Parliament.

Beyond walking distance: You can take a taxi up Richmond Hill to Fort
Frederick, which the French began in 1779. The British retook the island
in 1783 and completed the fort in 1791. From its battlements, you’ll have
a panoramic view of the harbor and the yacht marina.
Don’t miss the mountains northeast of St. George’s. If you don’t have
much time, 15m (50-ft.) Annandale Falls is just a 15-minute drive away,
on the outskirts of the Grand Etang Forest Reserve. You can swim and
picnic surrounded by liana vines, elephant ears, and other tropical flora
and spices — you’ll swear you landed in Tahiti. If you have more time
and want a less crowded spot, Seven Sisters Waterfalls are farther into

Grand Etang, an approximately 30-minute drive and then a mile hike
through the beautiful tropical forest to the falls.
About 25 miles north of St. George’s, at the 1912 Morne Fendue
Plantation House (also known as Betty’s) at St. Patrick’s (% 473-442-
9330), you can enjoy old-time island recipes while you dine as an upper-
class family would have in the 1920s. A fixed-price ($16) lunch is served
Monday to Saturday from 12:30 to 3 p.m. Call for reservations.
Grenada’s Grand Anse Beach, with its 3.2km (2 miles) of wide sugar-
white sands, is one of the best in the Caribbean, with calm waters and a
great view of St. George’s. There are several restaurants beachside, and
you can also join a banana-boat ride or rent a Sunfish sailboat.
Jamaica
Yah mon. Jamaica is a cool, racy place as islands go, and real popular
with cruise ships, not to mention honeymooners and couples who flock
to the island’s all-inclusive resorts. The third largest of the Caribbean
islands after Cuba and Hispaniola, Jamaica has dense jungle in its inte-
rior, mountains rising as high as 2,220m (7,400 ft.), and many beautiful
white-sand beaches along its northern coast, where the cruise ships
dock. Most head for Ocho Rios, although more are opting to call at the
city of Montego Bay (“Mo Bay”), 108km (67 miles) to the west, with com-
parable attractions, excursions, and shopping possibilities.
One of the most densely populated nations in the Caribbean, with a
vivid sense of its own identity, Jamaica has a history rooted in the plan-
tation economy and some of the most impassioned politics in the
Western Hemisphere, all of which leads to a sometimes turbulent day-to-
day reality. You’ve probably heard, for example, that the island’s ven-
dors and hawkers can be pushy and the locals not always the most
welcoming to tourists, and while there’s definitely some truth to this,
we’ve had mostly positive experiences, so keep an open mind.
The official language is English, but most Jamaicans speak a richly
nuanced patois. The unit of currency is the Jamaican dollar, designated
by the same symbol as the U.S. dollar (US$1 = J$61; J$1 = US2¢). Visitors
can pay in U.S. dollars, but always find out if a price is being quoted in
Jamaican or U.S. dollars — though the huge difference probably makes it
obvious.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at either the Port of Ocho Rios, near Dunn’s River
Falls and adjacent to Island Village and several shopping options, or at
Montego Bay, where there’s a modern cruise dock with the usual duty-
free stores and tourist information.
You can walk to the shopping, but otherwise taxis are your best means
of getting around on your own (definitely don’t rent a car here). They’ll
be waiting for you at the pier. Taxis licensed by the government — and

you should only use one of these — display JTB decals, indicating
they’re official Jamaican Tourist Board taxis. Fixed rates are posted.
Scoring the best excursions
Because there’s little besides shopping near the docks at either Ocho
Rios or Montego Bay, most passengers sign up for shore excursions. 
The following are usually offered from both ports.
Dunn’s River Falls Tour: Okay, they’re totally touristy, crowded, and
over-hyped, but we have to admit, climbing the falls is totally fun.
Cascading 180m (600 ft.) to the beach, it’s a ball to slip and slide your
way up the falls with hundreds of others, forming a human chain of
sorts. Wear a bathing suit under your clothes, and don’t forget your
waterproof camera and your aqua-socks. (If you do forget, most cruise
lines rent aqua-socks for an extra $5 or so.) The prettiest part of the
falls, known as the Laughing Waters, was used in the James Bond clas-
sics Dr. No and Live and Let Die. Tour options often include visits to
other sites and/or shopping. Note: The falls are much closer to Ocho
Rios than to Mo Bay, so tours from the latter typically cost around $70
and require a 21⁄4-hour drive each way, for a total of 71⁄2 hours (4–41⁄2
hours; $45).
River Tubing Safari: This is one of the best excursions we’ve ever taken.
After a scenic van ride deep into the pristine jungles, the group of 20 or
so passengers and a couple of guides sit back into big black inner tubes
and glide a few miles downriver, passing by gorgeous, towering bamboo
trees and other lush foliage. The rapids are very tame; do this for the
scenery and the fun of floating downstream on your bum! If you’re dock-
ing in Ocho Rios, this tour is usually on the White River. If in Montego
Bay, it’s on the Great River. This trip is totally better than the Martha
Brae River Rafting, which takes you down the river on two-seat bamboo
rafts for about the same price (31⁄2 hours; $58).
Horseback-Riding Excursion: After a 45-minute ride from the stables
through fields, you can gallop along the beach and take your horse bare-
back into the surf for a thrilling ride (3–31⁄2 hours; $89).
The following two popular excursions are typically offered from Mo Bay:
Rose Hall Great House: This is the most famous plantation home in
Jamaica. Built about two centuries ago by John Palmer, it gained notori-
ety from the doings of “Infamous Annie” Palmer, wife of the builder’s
grandnephew, who supposedly dabbled in witchcraft and murder. Many
Jamaicans insist the house is haunted (3 hours; $43).
Greenwood Great House and Town Drive: More interesting to some
than Rose Hall, this Georgian-style building was the residence of Richard
Barrett, a first cousin of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. On display are the
family’s library, portraits, antiques, and period musical instruments 
(31⁄2 hours; $39).
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
328

Exploring on your own in Ocho Rios
The port at Ocho Rios is just a mile away from the major shopping area,
Ocean Village Shopping Centre.
Once a small banana and fishing port, Ocho Rios is now Jamaica’s cruise
ship capital, welcoming a couple of ships every day during high season.
Though the area has some of the Caribbean’s most fabled resorts, and
Dunn’s River is just a five-minute taxi ride away, the town itself is not
much to see, including the outdoor markets within walking distance.
Don’t expect to shop in the markets without a lot of hassle and a lot of
very pushy hawking of merchandise — some of which is likely to be
ganja (the wacky weed). In recent years, a fleet of blue-uniformed “resort
patrol” on bikes has been helping keep order.
Within walking distance: Adjacent to the cruise pier, Island Village
(www.islandjamaica.com) is a 4-acre entertainment and shopping com-
plex developed by Island Records’ Chris Blackwell. Attractions include
the ReggaeXplosion museum, a museum of Jamaican art, a casino, an
outdoor concert venue and indoor theater, a beach with watersports,
and shopping (lots of it).
Beyond walking distance: Shore excursions are the best way to see
popular sights such as Dunn’s River Falls (see “Scoring the best excur-
sions,” earlier in this section).
The 1817 Brimmer Hall Estate, Port Maria, St. Mary’s (% 876-994-2309),
34km (21 miles) east of Ocho Rios, is a working plantation where you’re
driven around in a tractor-drawn jitney to see the tropical fruit trees and
coffee plants. It’s really touristy, but a lot of people seem to like it. Most
ships sell organized excursions here, or call ahead and arrange your
own. Admission is $15.
In the same general area, toward the coast, Firefly, Grants Pen, above
Oracabessa (% 876-997-7201), was the home of Sir Noël Coward and his
longtime companion, Graham Payn, who, as executor of Coward’s estate,
donated it to the Jamaica National Heritage Trust. The recently restored
house is as it was on the day Sir Noël died in 1973. It’s open Monday to
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $10.
The cruise and hotel hordes descend upon Mallards Beach, at the
Sunset Jamaica Grande (% 876-974-2201) on Main Street. Locals may
steer you to the good and less-crowded Turtle Beach, southwest of
Mallards. You may also want to check out the big James Bond Beach in
Oracabessa, about 20 minutes from town. Bond author Ian Fleming’s
home, Goldeneye, is located nearby.
Exploring on your own in Montego Bay
Mo Bay, as it’s called by insiders, has better beaches, shopping, and
restaurants than Ocho Rios, as well as some of the best golf courses in
the Caribbean — though it also has Ocho Rios’ crime and traffic.
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 329

Within walking distance: One of the main shopping hubs is Montego
Freeport, and it’s within easy walking distance of the pier. Otherwise,
you have to take a taxi or book an organized tour to see anything.
Beyond walking distance: If you’re not taking a shore excursion, con-
sider a visit to Rocklands Wildlife Station, Anchovy, St. James (% 876-
952-2009). Lisa Salmon, known as the “Bird Lady of Anchovy,” estab-
lished this sanctuary, which is perfect for nature lovers and bird-
watchers. You can feed small doves and finches from your hand, and
with luck you can coax a Jamaican doctor bird to perch on your finger
and drink syrup. Rocklands is about 1.2km (3⁄4 mile) outside Anchovy
on the road from Montego Bay. Admission is $8.
To beach it, head for Doctor’s Cave Beach (Gloucester Avenue across
from the Doctor’s Cave Beach Hotel; % 876-952-4355; www.doctors
cave.com), which helped launch Mo Bay as a resort in the 1940s. One of
the premier beaches of Jamaica, Aquasol Theme Park (formerly Walter
Fletcher Beach), is in the heart of Mo Bay; its tranquil waters are very
family friendly. On the main road 18km (11 miles) east of Montego Bay,
the half-mile Rose Hall Beach Club (% 876-680-0969) is a secure,
secluded, white sandy beach, offering crystal-clear water, a full restau-
rant, two beach bars, and more. All of these beaches charge admission,
which runs between about $4 and $8.
If you’d rather eat than roast in the sun, beeline it to The Pork Pit 
(27 Gloucester Ave.; % 876-952-1046), the best place to go for the
famous Jamaican jerk pork and jerk chicken. Prices are very reasonable.
Lunch costs $10.
If golf is your bag, there are several excellent 18-hole, par-71 or -72
courses, some with ocean views. If your ship doesn’t have an excursion
there, call ahead and then get there via taxi. Courses include Tryall 
Club (% 876-956-5660; www.tryallclub.com; greens fees $145), 19km
(12 miles) from Montego Bay; ultrascenic Wyndham Rose Hall Golf &
Beach Resort, Rose Hall (% 876-953-2650; greens fees $125), once 
featured in a James Bond movie; Half Moon, at Rose Hall (% 876-953-
2560; www.halfmoon-resort.com/golf; greens fees $130); and
Ironshore Golf & Country Club, Ironshore, St. James, Montego Bay 
(% 876-953-3681; greens fees $30–$50).
Key West, Florida
If you like booz’n and browsing for tacky souvenirs, with a little history
thrown in for good measure, then cool Key West will do you just fine.
Located at the very end of the Florida Keys, Key West is America’s
southernmost city and one of its most fun-loving and goofy. It’s part
Caribbean outpost with a dash of New Orleans–style high life. There are
plenty of Hemingway look-alikes, a large gay community, and tons of
tourists shuffling around with smiles on their faces. The proximity of
most attractions to the cruise docks means there’s little sense in taking
an excursion here unless you have mobility problems. Wander around
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
330

touristy Mallory Square and Duval Street, check out some of the theme
bars, and then take a walk down some of the quieter side streets, maybe
visiting Truman’s Little White House or the Hemingway House museum.
Or spend your day playing golf, diving, or snorkeling. Several raw bars
near the dock area offer seafood, including oysters and clams, although
the king here is conch — served grilled, ground into burgers, made into
chowder, fried in batter as fritters, or served raw in a salad.
You’re in Florida, so the U.S. dollar is the official currency and English is
the language.
Cruising into port
Ships dock at Mallory Square (Old Town’s tourist central), at the nearby
Hilton Resort’s Pier B, and at the U.S. Navy base’s “Outer Mole” pier. All
are on the Gulf side of the island. Passengers arriving at the Navy pier
must take an official shuttle bus the short distance to and from Mallory
Square, as individuals are not permitted to transit the base on their own.

Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the Conch Tour Train described in the next section, most
lines offer walking tours and sometimes bike tours for those who like the
services of a guide. But, this is really a port to explore on your own, with
the exception of booze cruises.
Key West Catamaran Sail and Snorkel Tour: The popular Fury catama-
rans take passengers to a reef for some snorkeling and then finish the
trip back to shore with music, booze, and a good time (3–31⁄2 hours; $44).
Exploring on your own
Within walking distance: The flat island is only 4 miles long and 2
miles wide, so getting around is easy. The most popular attractions are
within walking distance of Mallory Square, at most a 20-minute walk. 
The farthest is Hemingway House, about a mile down Duval. Many 
passengers opt for one of the island’s tram tours, which are sold as
shore excursions but are also available on a walk-up basis. Shopping is
available everywhere you look, and mostly of the flamingo snow globes, 
T-shirt, and floppy straw hats variety.
The Conch Tour Train (% 305-296-4444; www.conchtourtrain.com) is
a narrated 90-minute tour that offers commentary on 100 local sites. The
depot is located at Mallory Square, and trains depart every 30 minutes
($20 adults, $10 children 4–12, free 3 and under). The trip has only one
stop where passengers can get on and off (at the Historic Seaport). If
you want more flexibility, try the Old Town Trolley (% 305-296-6688;
www.trolleytours.com), which allows you to hop on and off its trains
to explore on your own. Prices are the same as the Conch Train, and
pickup stops are signposted around town.
If you want wheels of your own, bicycles and motor scooters are a good
bet here, and are widely available, with daily rates hovering around $12
and $45, respectively.
Depending on your degree of thirst, the most important sightseeing may
be Key West’s many bars. They’re big, are often packed, and typically
feature someone playing guitar and singing the hits in one corner. Most
serve basic chow too. Captain Tony’s Saloon (428 Greene St.; % 305-
294-1838) is the oldest active bar in Florida — Hemingway drank here
and Jimmy Buffett got his start here, what better drinking credentials
could you have? Sloppy Joe’s (201 Duval St.; % 305-294-5717) is the
most touristy bar in Key West. Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville (500
Duval St.; % 305-296-3070) is kind of a refugee from Branson, Missouri,
but if you’ve got a hankering for a cheeseburger from paradise or want
to waste away again on margaritas, this is your place. Much less com-
mercial is the open-air — and raucous and loud — Hog’s Breath Saloon
(400 Front St.; % 305-296-4222) near the cruise docks.
The Harry S. Truman Little White House (111 Front St.; % 305-294-9911;
www.trumanlittlewhitehouse.com) served as Truman’s vacation
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
332

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 333
home during his presidency and remains just as he left it, decorated in
late 1940s style. Guides lead a well-organized hour-long tour. Admission
is $10.
Hemingway Home (907 Whitehead St.; % 305-294-1136; www.hemingway
home.com) provides a similar if less formal look back at the island’s old
days. “Papa” lived here with his second wife, Pauline, completing For
Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to Arms in the studio annex out back.
Hemingway had some 60 polydactyl (many-toed) cats, whose descen-
dants still live on the grounds. Admission is $11.
Audubon House and Tropical Garden (205 Whitehead St., at Greene St.;
% 877-281-2473 or 305-294-2116; www.audubonhouse.com) is dedicated
to the 1832 Key West sojourn of the famous naturalist John James
Audubon. The main reason to visit is to see how wealthy sailors lived in
Key West in the 19th century, and the lush tropical gardens surrounding
the house. Admission is $10.
The Heritage House Museum and Robert Frost Cottage (410 Caroline
St.; % 305-296-3573; www.heritagehousemuseum.org) was the home
of Jessie Porter Newton, the grande dame of Key West. Today her home
is filled with mementos of the illustrious guests who partook of her hos-
pitality, including Tennessee Williams, Gloria Swanson, and Robert Frost,
who stayed in a cottage out back.
On the waterfront at Mallory Square, the Key West Aquarium (1 White-
head St.; % 305-296-2051; www.keywestaquarium.com), in operation
since 1932, was the first tourist attraction built in the Florida Keys.
Admission is $9.
Near the docks, the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society Museum (200
Greene St.; % 305-294-2633; www.melfisher.com) contains some of the
more than $400 million in gold jewelry, doubloons, and other artifacts the
late treasure hunter Mel Fisher plucked from the Spanish galleon Nuestra
Señora de Atocha, which sunk off the Keys in 1622. Admission is $10.
Nancy Forrester’s Secret Garden (1 Free School Lane, off Simonton
between Southard and Fleming Streets; % 305-294-0015) is the most
lavish and verdant garden in town, with some 150 species of palms and
thousands of orchids, climbing vines, and ground covers. Admission is $6.
This town is not known for beaches, but if you insist, the best of the
mediocre is Fort Zachary Taylor State Beach (% 305-292-6713), a 12-
minute walk from the docks. To get there, go through the gates leading
into the Truman Annex (site of the Little White House).
Martinique
Frenchies and Francophiles will appreciate Martinque’s history. The
island, an overseas department of France since 1946, was the birthplace
and childhood home of Empress Joséphine, sweetheart and wife of

Napoleon. Martinique is also on the map for a horrific volcano that dev-
astated St-Pierre in 1902. Within minutes, some 30,000 souls perished.
Love and death make quite a one-two punch, but they’re just the hook.
Look a bit deeper to appreciate Martinique’s subtler attractions —
quaint seaside villages, colonial ruins dating to when France and
England vied for the island, and captivatingly beautiful rain forests and
beaches.
French is Martinique’s official language, but you can get by with English
at most restaurants and tourist sites. Martinique is an overseas region
of France, so the euro (€) is the official currency (1€ = US$1.30; US$1 =
.77€). U.S. dollars are commonly accepted in tourist areas.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock in the heart of Fort-de-France, at the Pointe
Simon Cruise Dock, which has quays for two large vessels. Because
Martinique is a popular port of call, ships may also dock at the Passenger
Terminal at the main harbor, a nondescript cargo port on the north side
of the bay, a $10 cab ride from the center of town.
Scoring the best excursions
Rainforest and Plantations 4WD Safari: Take your off-road vehicle
through tropical forests and sugar-cane plantations (stopping to sample
the crop) to a banana plantation and a distillery where you do short
tours (4 hours; $84).
Martinique Snorkeling: Across the bay from Fort-de-France, the reef at
Anse Dufour offers excellent snorkeling for experts and novices. The reef
is filled with marine animals, including French grunts, blackbar soldier-
fish, and silversides. Snorkeling equipment is provided, as are profes-
sional instruction, supervision, and transportation (3 hours; $49).
Exploring on your own
Travel by taxi is convenient but expensive. Most cabs are metered, 
and you can find them waiting at the cruise pier. To cross the bay to 
La Pagerie (Empress Joséphine’s birthplace) and the resort area of
Pointe du Bout, take one of the blue ferries that sail from east of the
cruise dock in Fort-de-France at least once per hour. Round-trip tickets
cost about 6€ ($7.80). Avis, Budget, and Hertz all offer rental cars, too.
Within walking distance: A bustling town of 100,000 residents, Fort-de-
France is a sea of ochre buildings, cascading flowers, and tall palm trees.
The town’s narrow streets, cluttered with boutiques and cafes, climb
from the bowl of the sea to the surrounding hills, forming a great urban
amphitheater. There’s plenty here to keep you busy.
At the eastern end of downtown, La Savane is a broad formal park with
palms, mangoes, and manicured lawns, perfect for a promenade or rest
in the shade. Its most famous feature is the Statue of Empress Joséphine,
carved in 1858 by Vital Dubray and unceremoniously decapitated in 1995
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
334

in commemoration of her role in reinstating slavery on the island in the
early 1800s.
Across the street, Bibliothèque Schoelcher (Schoelcher Library; % 596-
70-26-67) is one of Fort-de-France’s great Belle Epoque buildings. Named
in honor of Victor Schoelcher, one of France’s most influential abolition-
ists, it houses his books and other documents. Admission is free; closed
Sunday.
Another Henri Pick masterpiece, St. Louis Cathedral, on rue Victor
Schoelcher at rue Blénac, was built in 1895. Check out the organ,

stained-glass windows, and ornamented interior walls. They can be
viewed every morning except Saturday.
Built in 1640, Fort St. Louis, Boulevard Alfassa, dominates the rocky
promontory east of La Savane. It first defended Fort-de-France in 1674
against Dutch invaders, and today, remains the French navy’s headquar-
ters in the Caribbean. It is open to visitors only on special occasions.
The best of Fort-de-France’s many museums, the Musée Départemental
d’Archéologie Précolombienne Préhistoire (9 rue de la Liberté; % 596-
71-57-05), traces 2,000 years of Martinique’s pre-Columbian past with
more than a thousand relics from the Arawak and Carib cultures.
Admission is 3.45€ ($4.50); closed Sunday.
You can expect to find great food all over town if you want to stop for
lunch, and more than any other island in the French West Indies,
Martinique gives French and Creole cuisine equal billing.
Beyond walking distance: Too large to tackle in a single day, you have
to pick and choose among the island’s many museums, plantations,
floral parks, and natural wonders to visit.
Martinique’s Carib name, Madiana, means “island of flowers.” To see
what the Caribs were talking about, stroll through the Jardin de Balata
(% 596-64-48-73). Located about 8km (5 miles) north of town, this lush,
Edenic garden showcases 200 species of plants, trees, and tropical flow-
ers, as well as resident hummingbirds, frogs, and lizards. Admission is
6.50€ ($8.45).
One of Martinique’s must-see attractions, the village of St-Pierre on the
northwest coast, was the cultural and economic capital of the island
until 8 a.m. on May 8, 1902, when the Mount Pelée volcano exploded in
fire and lava. Three minutes later, all but one of St-Pierre’s 30,000 inhabi-
tants had been incinerated, buried in ash and lava, or asphyxiated by
poisonous gas. The town once hailed as the “Paris of the Antilles”
became “the Pompeii of the Caribbean,” and today it’s no more than a
sleepy fishing village, home to fewer than 5,000 souls. Ruins of a church,
theater, and other buildings punctuate the town, memorials to St-Pierre’s
former glory. The one-room Musée Volcanologique (rue Victor Hugo; 
% 596-78-15-16) traces the story of the cataclysm through pictures and
relics excavated from the debris. Admission is 2€ ($3.60).
Part sugar-plantation ruins, part tropical paradise, Habitation Céron
(% 596-52-94-53) is the most evocative of Martinique’s historical agri-
cultural sites. This sprawling 17th-century estate, 15 minutes north of 
St-Pierre, is almost as wild and tranquil as the surrounding rain forest,
but its verdigris cisterns, moss-covered stone buildings, and archaic,
still functioning water mill are all haunted with the ghosts of a time when
sugar was king. Admission is 6€ ($7.80).
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
336

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 337
A few miles south of St-Pierre, Le Carbet is where Columbus landed in
1502, where the first French settlers arrived in 1635, and where the
French painter Paul Gauguin lived for five months in 1887. At the site is
the tiny Musée Paul Gauguin, Anse Turin (% 596-78-22-66), though
there are no original paintings. Admission is 4€ ($5.20).
Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie was born in 1763 in the quaint
little village of Trois Ilets, across the bay from Fort-de-France. As
Joséphine, she became the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1796 and
Empress of France in 1804. A small museum, the Musée de la Pagerie
(% 596-68-33-06), sits in the former estate kitchen building, where
Joséphine gossiped with her slaves. Admission costs 3€ ($3.90).
You’ll have passed through a number of quaint coastal villages by this
time but none sweeter than Ste-Luce. Absurdly picturesque with its
blindingly white stucco walls, red-tile roofs, turquoise sea, and multi-
colored fishing boats, swim or snorkel off the small, pleasant beach, or
just chill out.
Other beaches for bumming around include Grand Anse des Salines,
just south of Fort-de-France and widely regarded as Martinique’s nicest
strand. To get to the island’s main gay beach, turn right at the entrance
to Grand Anse des Salines and drive to the far end of the parking lot,
near the sign for Petite Anse des Salines. Follow the path through the
woods and then veer left till you find the quiet section with the good-
looking guys.
Conveniently located across the bay from Fort-de-France, Pointe du
Bout is Martinique’s most lavish resort area. Aside from a marina and a
variety of watersports, the area has some modest man-made, white-sand
beaches. The sandy, natural beaches at nearby Anse Mitan and Anses
d’Arlet are popular with both swimmers and snorkelers.
Beaches north of Fort-de-France have mostly gray (they like to call it
silver) volcanic sand. The best of the bunch is Anse Turin, just to the
side of the main Caribbean coastal road, between St-Pierre and Le
Carbet. Extremely popular with locals and shaded by palms, it’s where
Gauguin swam when he called the island home.
Martinique has no legal nudist beaches, but toplessness is as common
here as anywhere in France.
Puerto Rico
San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, is a bustling port that easily sees
five to ten ships a day. Many ships use San Juan as an embarkation port;
others visit as a port of call. The San Juan metropolitan area, home to
about a third of Puerto Rico’s 3.8 million people, is one of the largest and
most sophisticated urban centers in the Caribbean. The docks are right
at the foot of Old San Juan, which is popular with cruise passengers

also because it’s the most beautiful, historic part of town. The neighbor-
hood’s hilly cobblestone streets are lined with brightly painted colonial
townhouses, colonial churches, intimate parks, and sun-drenched plazas
as well as restaurants and shops (U.S. citizens don’t pay taxes here).
Like the pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall of China, Old San Juan’s
Spanish colonial forts and city walls are United Nations World Heritage
Sites, and our top pick here.
Spanish is the native tongue, but most people on the island also speak
English (both are official languages here). The farther you venture from
San Juan, the more likely it is you’ll have to practice your Spanish.
Because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, the U.S. dollar is the
coin of the realm.
Cruising into port
Almost all cruise ships dock at Old San Juan, but during periods of
heavy volume, you may dock at one of the much less convenient cargo
piers across the water from the old town, requiring a short taxi ride.
Scoring the best excursions
Unless you want a guide to offer historical perspective (21⁄2 hours; $33),
don’t bother with organized walking tours of Old San Juan — it’s easy
enough to get around on your own (pick up a walking tour map in the
terminal). On the other hand, if you explore somewhere farther afield, an
organized tour is a good idea.
El Yunque Rainforest: Though you wouldn’t know it from San Juan’s
hustle-bustle, Puerto Rico has a natural side too. After arriving at Baño
Grande, a natural swimming hole, hike half an hour along the Caimitillo
Trail and see parrot nests, giant ferns, orchids, and palms. Listen for the
song of Puerto Rico’s national symbol, the tiny coquí tree frog (4–5
hours; $35).
Rainforest Horseback Adventure: Meet your horse, briefly learn the
ropes, and then ride along a beautiful beach. Take a quick swim during
the refreshment stop (31⁄2 hours; $79–$82).
City Tour and Bacardi Rum Distillery: After a tour of the old city, with a
stop at Fort San Cristóbal, you’ll travel to the Bacardi distillery to learn
about the Puerto Rican sugar and rum industries, watch giant ferment-
ing tanks transform sugar cane into rum, learn how to pronounce 
the product’s name (baa-carrrr-di!), and then get a taste for yourself 
(4 hours; $30).
Exploring on your own
Old San Juan beckons the walker to explore its hilly streets. Taxis oper-
ated by the Tourist Transportation Division are available at the piers.
They’re metered in San Juan, but the fare structure between major
tourism zones is standardized.

Old San Juan

Within walking distance: Walking the cobblestone streets of the his-
toric landmark area of Old San Juan, you sense five centuries of history
as you pass many of Puerto Rico’s top historical attractions. You also
find shops and cafes on any walking tour.
One must-see attraction is El Morro (Castillo de San Felipe del Morro) —
indeed, you can’t miss it as it sits at the top of a hill at the tip of the city.
Its walls are part of a network of defenses that made San Juan a walled
city, and for centuries, the fortress was considered impregnable. Here,
Spanish Puerto Rico defended itself against the navies of Great Britain,
France, and Holland, as well as against hundreds of pirate ships. The
National Park Service maintains both El Morro and Fort San Cristóbal,
located less than a mile east along the north coast.
Other varied and interesting sites include La Fortaleza and Mansion
Ejecutiva, the centuries-old residence of the Puerto Rican governor; Plaza
de Armas, the most beautiful of the squares in Old Town, flanked by the
neoclassic Intendencia, which houses offices of the State Department and
San Juan’s historic City Hall; La Casa Blanca, which the son-in-law of Juan
Ponce de León built as the great explorer’s island home (although he
never lived there); and La Princesa, once the most-feared prison in the
Caribbean. The Puerto Rican Academy of Fine Arts is at the Antiguo
Monicomio Insular (originally built in 1854 as an insane asylum). The
nearby Asilo de Beneficencia, or “Home for the Poor,” is a stately neoclas-
sical building dating to the 1840s.
In the Plaza de San José, the statue of explorer Juan Ponce de León
was cast from an English cannon captured during a naval battle in 1797.
Dominicans established the Iglesia de San José, the church for which
the plaza is named, in 1523. Several other historic buildings surround
the plaza, including the Museo de Pablo Casals, which honors the
Spanish-born cellist who lived his final years in Puerto Rico, and a
former 17th-century convent, El Convento, which has been converted
into one of the few hotels within the Old City. The Catedral de San Juan,
Puerto Rico’s most famous church, is across the street. You can also
visit Capilla de Cristo, a tiny chapel with a silver altar dedicated to the
Christ of Miracles. Also not far from the plaza, the Cuartel de Ballajá
houses the Museum of the Americas on its second floor.
Beyond walking distance: Perhaps the most famous beach in the
Caribbean, Condado Beach, at the western end of Ashford Avenue, is
the backyard playground of Condado’s resort hotels. A favorite of fami-
lies, it can get pretty crowded in winter. The beaches of Isla Verde,
behind the hotels and condominiums along Isla Verde Avenue, are less
rocky and are excellent for people-watching. Both have white sand, palm
trees, watersports, and plenty of eating and drinking options.
If you’re more of a gambler than a sunbather, casinos are one of San
Juan’s biggest draws, and most large hotels have one. They’re generally
open daily from noon to 4 a.m., but some never close. There’s the plush
Casino at the Ritz-Carlton (6961 State Rd., Isla Verde; % 800-241-3333
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
340

or 787-253-1700); the elegant InterContinental San Juan (187 Isla Verde
Ave.; % 800-303-1758 or 787-791-6100); and, the most convenient for
cruise ship passengers, the Sheraton Old San Juan Hotel & Casino (100
Brumbaugh St.; % 800-325-3535 or 787-721-5100), is directly across from
Pier 3 and often bustling.
Golf is also an option, just be sure to sign up for a ship excursion or plan
on renting a car to get to the courses, which include the well-regarded
Hyatt Dorado Beach Resort & Country Club (% 787-796-8961; www.
hyatt.com), Palmas del Mar & Villas Golf Club (% 787-285-2256;
www.palmascountryclub.com), and The Westin Rio Mar Golf Resort &
Spa (% 787-888-6000; www.westinriomar.com). Greens fees at each
range from $130 to $190.
St. Barthélemy (St. Barts)
Chic, sophisticated St. Barts (or, technically, St. Barthélemy, a name no
one ever uses) is internationally renowned as one of the ritziest refuges
in the Caribbean, rivaled only by Mustique as the preferred island retreat
of the rich and famous. Yet despite all the hoopla, St. Barts retains its
charm, serenity, natural beauty, and incredibly French flavor — in con-
trast to most Caribbean islands, where descendants of African slaves
form the majority, St. Barts’s 7,000 year-round residents are primarily of
French ancestry. Gustavia, the main port (whose name harks back to the
19th century, when Sweden controlled the island), is full of French restau-
rants and semi-chic, semi-boho nightspots. Many of the small luxe ships
that call here stay into the evening so that passengers can get a night out.
Away from town, the island is full of dramatic hills and pristine white-
sand beaches.
French is the official language, but virtually everyone speaks English as
well. St. Barts is part of the French overseas region of Guadeloupe, so
the euro (€) is the official currency (1€ = US$1.30; $1 = .77€). U.S. 
dollars are commonly accepted.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships anchor off Gustavia, the main town, and ferry passengers
to the dollhouse-size harbor and town via tenders.
Scoring the best excursions
Jet-Set Boat and Beach Excursion: Circumnavigate St. Barts in a 40-foot
cruiser, then tender ashore at St. Jean Beach for a swim, snorkel, and/or
drinks from the open bar (4 hours; $200–$400).
St. Barts on Horseback: Travel to northern St. Barts for a relaxed guided
ride through the island’s outback (2 hours; $65).
Exploring on your own
Taxis congregate at Gustavia’s harbor to take cruise passengers to the
beaches. If you want some adventure, rent a Smart Car, the latest toys

St. Barthélemy (St. Barts)
on the island — they come in all kinds of bright colors — for a ride up
and down St. Barts’s picturesque, hilly roads. Budget, Avis, Hertz, and
National have offices here.
Within walking distance: For a taste of the island’s celeb vibe, make 
a beeline to Le Select (rue de la France at rue du Général de Gaulle; 
% 590-27-86-87), the epicenter of Gustavia’s social life for more than
50 years. This cafe’s tables rest in a tree-shaded garden a block from
the harbor. The classic, funky ambience inspired Jimmy Buffett’s
“Cheeseburger in Paradise,” and a mix of salty locals, celebrities, and
chic tourists typically make up the clientele. Aside from hanging out,
shopping, and eating, cruisers sticking close to port can also visit
Gustavia’s modest points of interest: St. Bartholomew’s Church, rue
Samuel Fahlberg, dates from the 1850s, and the Municipal Museum, on
rue Duquesne, across from the dock (% 590-29-71-55), is an unfocused
but respectable introduction to the island. Admission is 2€ ($2.60);
closed Saturday afternoon and Monday morning.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
342

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 343
Beyond walking distance: For a little culture, the tiny fishing village of
Corossol is a step back in time. About 10 minutes by taxi from the dock,
this quaint, totally un-chic hamlet is home to traditional folk who still
live off the sea. On the town’s waterfront, just to the left of the road from
Gustavia, the Inter Oceans Museum (% 590-27-62-97) catalogs thou-
sands of shells, corals, sand dollars, sea horses, sea urchins, and fish
from around the world, all displayed in endearingly homemade style.
Admission is 3€ ($3.90); closed Mondays.
The most famous of the island’s 22 beaches is St-Jean, where you can
enjoy watersports, beach restaurants, and a few hotels. Grand Cul de
Sac offers a similar active vibe. If you want peace and privacy, the best
secluded beaches include Marigot and Colombier to the north, and
Grande Saline and Gouverneur to the south (which is very remote).
Topless sunbathing is quite common and at Saline, you may also see
a lot of people in their altogether, even though nudity is officially 
forbidden).
St. Kitts
St. Kitts is almost ridiculously lush and fertile, dotted with rain forests
and waterfalls and boasting some lovely beaches along its southeast
coastline, but it’s also extremely poor, still dependent on the same
sugar-cane crop that brought its English plantation owners riches (and
its slaves hot misery) back in colonial days. Cane fields climb the slopes
of its volcanic mountain range, and you’ll see ruins of old mills and plan-
tation houses as you drive around the island. Basseterre, the capital city,
is full of old-time colonial architecture, but it’s a small-scale place with
little to offer visitors beyond a pleasant walk-around. The island’s most
impressive landmark, Brimstone Hill Fortress, is about 15km (9 miles)
west of town. St. Kitts forms the larger and more populated half of the
combined Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, two islands separated by
only about 3.2km (2 miles) of ocean.
English is the language of both islands. The local currency is the Eastern
Caribbean dollar (US$1 = EC$2.70; EC$1 = US37¢). Many shops and
restaurants quote prices in U.S. dollars. Always determine which cur-
rency locals are talking about.
Cruising into port
Port Zante stretches from the center of town into the deep waters off-
shore, with shopping, restaurants, and a welcome center on-site. New
additions to the facility, including a second pier and expanded shopping,
were due to be completed soon after this book hit the shelves.
Scoring the best excursions
Brimstone Hill Fortress and Romney Gardens: Among the largest and
best-preserved forts in the Caribbean, Brimstone Hill Fortress National
Park (www.brimstonehillfortress.org) dates from 1690, when the
British fortified the hill to help recapture Fort Charles from the French.

St. Kitts
In 1782, an invading force of 8,000 French troops bombarded the fortress
for a month before its small British garrison, supplemented by local mili-
tia, surrendered. When the British took the island back the next year,
they proceeded to enlarge the fort into “The Gibraltar of the West
Indies.” In all, the structure took 104 years to complete. Today it’s the
centerpiece of a national park crisscrossed by nature trails, with a popu-
lation of green vervet monkeys to keep things lively. Tours typically
include a visit to the beautiful Romney Gardens, located amidst the
ruins of a sugar estate between Basseterre and the fort. You can check
out the lush hillside gardens, featuring giant ferns, orchids, poinsettias,
and “The Tree,” a 350-year-old Saman tree (3 hours; $46).

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 345
Mountain Biking and Beach Tour: From the pier, you ride through
Basseterre then out through sugar-cane fields and up 450m (1,500-ft.)
Olivees Mountain for views and refreshments. After the ride down, you
stop at Friar’s Bay for a swim and snack. It’s a nice way to see this lush
island (4 hours; $71).
Rainforest and Gardens Hiking Safari: Departing from Romney Gardens,
you hike along a loop of trails through lush rain forest. With luck, you can
catch sight of some of the island’s resident monkeys (4 hours; $59).
Exploring on your own
You can walk around Basseterre, but you need a taxi to get anywhere
else. They greet cruise passengers (loudly) at the docks and also around
the Circus, a public square near the docks at the intersection of Bank
and Fort streets. Taxis aren’t metered, so you must agree on the price
before heading out. Always ask if the rates quoted are in U.S. dollars or
Eastern Caribbean dollars.
Within walking distance: The capital city of Basseterre, where the
docks are located, has typical British colonial architecture and some
quaint buildings, a few shops, and a market where locals display fruits
and flowers — but even this description may give you the wrong idea
about this place. The truth is, it’s a very poor town, with few attractions
aimed at visitors. When we were last there, there were chickens walking
around in front of the government buildings. St. George’s Anglican
Church, on Cayon Street (walk straight up Church St. or Fort St. from the
dock), is the oldest church in town and is worth a look. Independence
Square, a stone’s throw from the docks along Bank Street, is pretty, with
its central fountain and old church, but there’s no good reason to linger
unless it’s to sit in the shade and toss back a bottle of Ting, the local
grapefruit-based soda.
The narrow peninsula in the southeast is where you find the best
beaches and swimming, including Conaree Beach, 4.8km (3 miles) from
Basseterre; Frigate Bay, with its talcum-powder-fine sand; the twin
beaches of Banana Bay and Cockleshell Bay, at the southeast corner of
the island; and Friar’s Bay, a peninsula beach opening onto both the
Atlantic and the Caribbean.
Beyond walking distance: All the best stuff to do outside of town is
covered in “Scoring the best excursions,” earlier in this section.
To experience the sweeter side of St. Kitts, try a stalk of sugar cane. Buy
one from any farmer, peel it, and chew the inner reeds to enjoy the sweet
juice. Try it with ice and a splash of rum.
St. Lucia
Of all the islands in the Caribbean, St. Lucia is most likely to make you
think you’re in the South Pacific, with its green mountains, the peaks of
Petit Piton and Gros Piton, and the brilliant white sandy beaches along

St. Lucia

the northwest coast. Castries, the capital, has grown up around an
extinct volcanic crater that’s now a large harbor surrounded by hills. It
looks more modern than other regional capitals because fires destroyed
many of the original French colonial and Victorian buildings typical of
the region’s architecture. But at its heart, Castries is still very tradi-
tional. The country women dress in traditional cotton headdresses to
sell their luscious fruits and vegetables, while weather-beaten men sit
close by playing warrie (a fast game played with pebbles on a carved
board) or fleet games of dominoes using tiles the color of cherries.
English is the official language. The official currency is the Eastern
Caribbean dollar (US$1 = EC$2.70; EC$1 = US37¢), though shops and
restaurants commonly take the U.S. dollar as well. Be sure you know
which currency a price is being quoted in before paying.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships arrive at a fairly new pier at Pointe Seraphine, within
walking distance of the center of Castries and boasting St. Lucia’s best
shopping. In the unlikely event that Pointe Seraphine is full, your ship may
dock instead at Port Castries on the other side of the colorful harbor.
There’s a shopping terminal here called La Place Carenage. Some smaller
lines, such as Star Clippers, Seabourn, and Clipper, visit other sites around
the island, anchoring off Rodney Bay to the north or Soufrière to the
south and carrying passengers ashore by tender.
Scoring the best excursions
Pigeon Island Sea Kayaking: After transferring to Rodney Bay, you make
the approximately 30-minute paddle out to the island, where you have
time to swim, kayak some more, or make the steep climb up to Fort
Rodney (3 hours; $65–$70).
Rainforest Bicycle Tour: Ride past banana plantations and the Errard
Falls waterfall, and stop to sample various fruits that grow along the
roadside (41⁄2 hours; $69). A different tour, Jungle Mountain Biking,
takes you by boat to the Jungle Biking facility, located on an 18th-
century sugar plantation. There, you can explore 16km (10 miles) of
trails at your own pace (41⁄2 hours; $99).
Soody Nature Hike and Mineral Waterfall: Drive along the west coast
through fishing villages and banana plantations, before arriving at
Soufrière, location of the Pitons and the Diamond Botanical Gardens,
Waterfall, and Mineral Baths. A guided hour-long hike through the vol-
canic forest introduces you to the island’s flora and fauna, and ends up
at a therapeutic sulphuric waterfall where you can take a dip to cure
what ails ya. Lunch at a Creole restaurant is included (7 hours; $55).
Exploring on your own
There is an official taxi association servicing both Pointe Seraphine and
La Place Carenage, with standard fares posted. You can hire a taxi to go
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 347

to Soufrière on your own, too. Many taxi drivers offer two- to three-hour
tours, with a stop at the beach, for $60. Be sure you’re talking U.S. or EC
dollars before agreeing on a price.
Within walking distance: The principal streets of Castries are William
Peter Boulevard and Bridge Street. Don’t miss a walk through town:
People are very friendly, and Jeremie Street is chockablock with variety
stores of the most authentic local kind, selling everything from spices to
housewares. A Roman Catholic cathedral stands on Columbus Square,
and take a gander at the enormous 400-year-old “rain” tree, also called a
“no-name” tree, which grows in the square.
Beyond Government House lies Morne Fortune, which means “Hill of
Good Luck.” Actually, no one’s had much luck here, certainly not the
French and British soldiers who battled for Fort Charlotte. The fort
switched between the two sides many times. You can visit the 18th-
century barracks, complete with a military cemetery, a small museum,
the Old Powder Magazine, and the “Four Apostles Battery,” four grim
muzzle-loading cannons. The view of the harbor of Castries is panoramic
from this point. To reach Morne Fortune, head east on Bridge Street.
Also worth a visit in Castries is a colorful market near the dock.
Beyond walking distance: St. Lucia’s first national park, the 44-acre
Pigeon Island National Landmark (% 758-450-0603), is ideal for picnics
and nature walks, and is covered with lemongrass. It’s joined to the main-
land by a causeway, so you can take a taxi there. Stop by the Captain’s
Cellar pub, with seating out on the lawn just beyond the spray from the
Atlantic waves. Two white-sand beaches lie on the island’s west coast.
Island admission is $5.
La Soufrière, a fishing port and St. Lucia’s second largest settlement, is
dominated by the Pitons. Near the town lies the famous “drive-in” vol-
cano, La Soufrière, a rocky lunar landscape of bubbling mud and craters
seething with fuming sulfur. You can literally drive into an old crater and
walk between the sulfur springs and pools of hissing steam. Nearby are
the Diamond Mineral Baths, dating back to 1784.
Leading beaches along the calm shores of the western coast include
Pigeon Island, off the northern shore; Vigie Beach, north of Castries
Harbour; Marigot Beach, south of Castries Harbour; and Reduit Beach,
between Choc Bay and Pigeon Point. Just north of Soufrière is a beach
connoisseur’s delight, Anse Chastanet (% 758-459-7000), boasting an
expanse of white sand at the foothills of lush, green mountains. This is a
fantastic spot for snorkeling.
Sint Maarten & St. Martin
This 96-sq.-km (37-sq.-mile) island has two faces. It’s been shared by
France and the Netherlands for more than 350 years. Although the
border between the two sides is virtually imperceptible — a monument
along the road marks the change in administration — each side retains

Sint Maarten & St. Martin
elements of its own heritage. The French side (St. Martin), with some of
the best beaches and restaurants in the Caribbean, emphasizes quiet
elegance. The Dutch side (Sint Maarten) reflects Holland’s anything-goes
philosophy: Development is much more widespread, flashy casinos
pepper the landscape, and strip malls make the larger towns look as
much like Anaheim as Amsterdam. The 100 percent duty-free shopping
has turned both sides of the island into a bargain-hunter’s paradise.
Surprise, surprise: The official language on the Dutch side is Dutch, and
the official language on the French side is French. Most people on both
sides also speak English. The legal tender in Dutch Sint Maarten is the

Netherlands Antilles guilder, or NAf (NAf1.79 = US$1; NAf1 = US56¢),
and the official currency on the French side is the euro (1€ = US$1.30;
$1 = .77€). U.S. dollars are widely accepted on both sides, and most
prices are quoted in U.S. dollars, too.
Cruising into port
All cruise ships dock on the Dutch side, at A. C. Wathey Pier, about
1.6km (1 mile) southeast of Philipsburg. The majority of passengers are
then tendered to the smaller Captain Hodge Pier in Great Bay Harbour at
the center of town, but others choose to walk the distance on a newly
developed boardwalk or take a taxi. The new $40 million Harbor Point
Village waterside complex at the port offers a host of shopping and
entertainment venues housed in old West Indies–style architecture.
Smaller vessels sometimes dock on the French side of the island, at
Marina Port la Royale, adjacent to the heart of Marigot.
Scoring the best excursions
America’s Cup Regatta: A sailing adventure aboard one of the yachts
that competes in the America’s Cup races (3 hours; $89).
Pinel Island Snorkeling Tour: Offered on the French side, take a scenic
bus ride to the French side and catch a boat to this small offshore islet
for some of St. Martin’s best snorkeling (31⁄2 hours; $39).
Exploring on your own in Sint Maarten
Taxis on both sides of the island are unmetered. Agree on a rate and cur-
rency before getting in. Dutch law requires that drivers list government-
regulated fares based on two passengers. Privately owned and operated
minivans have signs to indicate their destination, and can be hailed any-
where on the street. Fares are usually about $1.50. Rental cars are a
great way to see both sides of the island. Avis, Budget, and Hertz all
have offices here.
Within walking distance: Directly in front of the Philipsburg town
pier, on Wathey Square, the 1793-built Courthouse combines northern
European sobriety with Caribbean brightness. East of the Courthouse, at
7 Front St. (down a little shopping alley), is the tiny Sint Maarten Museum
(% 599-542-4917). Admission is free; closes 2 p.m. Saturday and all day
Sunday. Historically, Fort Amsterdam is the Dutch side’s most important
colonial site. Since 1631, the fort has looked out over Great Bay from the
hill west of Philipsburg. The fort was the Netherlands’ first military out-
post in the Caribbean. The Spanish captured it two years later, making it
their most significant bastion east of Puerto Rico. The site provides grand
views of the bay, but ruins of the walls and a couple of rusty cannons are
all that remain of the original fort.
From the center of town, you can walk to Great Bay Beach; this mile-
long stretch is convenient and has calm water, but it lacks the tranquility
of the more remote beaches.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
350

Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 351
Gambling is also big here, with several casinos clustered along Front
Street in the heart of Philipsburg. All of them open early enough to snag
cruisers.
Beyond walking distance: Just west of the airport, on the west side of
the island, Maho Beach boasts a casino, shade palms, and a popular
beachside bar and grill. It’s a good snorkeling spot, too. Farther west,
Mullet Beach borders the island’s golf course. Shaded by palm trees
and crowded on weekends, it’s popular with swimmers and snorkelers.
Dawn Beach, on the east coast, is the best snorkeling site on the island.
Rent equipment from Busby’s Beach Bar, which is right on the sand.
Exploring on your own in St. Martin
For taxi info, see the preceding section, “Exploring on your own in Sint
Maarten.”
Within walking distance: From the 1767-built Fort St. Louis, Marigot’s
answer to Fort Amsterdam, the short climb up top affords splendid vistas.
As a respite from the sun, duck into Marigot’s Museum of Saint Martin
(% 590-29-22-84), next to the tourism office and adjacent to the marina.
Much more thorough and scholarly than its Philipsburg counterpart, this
institution boasts a first-rate collection of Ciboney, Arawak, and Carib arti-
facts excavated from the island’s Amerindian sites. Admission costs $6.50;
closed Sunday. For shoppers, an open-air market is in the center of town.
Another busy center of activity is Port La Royale, the largest shopping
arcade on the French side.
Petit Club is the oldest restaurant in Marigot, serving Creole and French
specialties such as spicy conch stew and fresh fish.
Beyond walking distance: Top-rated beaches on the French side are
Baie Longue, Baie Rouge, and Pinel Island. If you want a stripped-down
adventure, visit the famous clothes-optional Orient Beach.
St. Thomas and St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands
Ever since Columbus discovered the Virgin Islands during his second
voyage to the New World in 1493, they have proven irresistible to foreign
powers seeking territory, at one time or another being governed by
Denmark, Spain, France, England, Holland, and, since 1917, by the United
States. Tourism and U.S. government programs have raised the standard
of living to one of the highest in the Caribbean, and today the island is
one of the busiest and most developed cruise ports in the Caribbean. On
St. Thomas, Charlotte Amalie (pronounced ah-mahl-yah), named in 1691
in honor of the wife of Denmark’s King Christian V, is the island’s capital
and has become the Caribbean’s major shopping center and one of its
busiest cruise ports — it’s often downright jampacked (and not one of
our favorite ports).
The most tranquil and unspoiled of the U.S. Virgin Islands is St. John, the
smallest of the lot, more than half of which is preserved as the gorgeous

Virgin Islands National Park. A rocky coastline, forming crescent-
shaped bays and white-sand beaches, rings the whole island, whose
miles of serpentine hiking trails lead past the ruins of 18th-century
Danish plantations and onto panoramic ocean views.
English is spoken on both islands, and the U.S. dollar is the currency.
Americans get a break on shopping in the U.S. Virgin Islands, as they can
bring home $1,200 worth of merchandise without paying duty, as opposed
to $400 from most other Caribbean ports. You can also bring back more
liquor from here. See Chapter 19 for more Customs information.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships anchor at West Indian Dock/Havensight Mall. Located
at the eastern end of Charlotte Amalie Harbor, 21⁄2 miles from the town
center, it’s got its own restaurants, bookstores, banks, postal van, and
lots of duty-free shops. Many people make the long, hot walk to the
center of Charlotte Amalie, but it’s not a scenic route in any way, so
you may want to opt for one of the $3 per-person open-air taxis. If
Havensight is clogged with cruise ships, your ship will dock at the Crown
Bay Marina, to the west of Charlotte Amalie. A taxi is your best bet — the
30-minute-plus walk into Charlotte Amalie feels longer on a hot day, and
isn’t terribly picturesque. A taxi ride into town from here costs about $4.
Cruise ships cannot dock at either of St. John’s piers. Instead, they moor
off the coast at Cruz Bay, sending tenders to the National Park Service
Dock, the larger of the piers. Most cruise ships docking at St. Thomas
offer shore excursions to St. John’s pristine interior and beaches; it’s
just a 45-minute ferry ride between Charlotte Amalie and Cruz Bay.
Seeking out the best shore excursions
Expect to snooze through the St. Thomas sightseeing trips that most
ships offer. Here are a few better bets:
Coral World and Island Drive: Coral World Underwater Observatory
and Marine Park is St. Thomas’s top attraction (3 hours; $39–$42).
Kayaking the Marine Sanctuary: Kayak from the mouth of the marine
sanctuary at Holmberg’s Marina and spend nearly an hour paddling
among the mangroves while a naturalist explains the mangrove and
lagoon ecosystem. Includes a free half-hour to snorkel or walk along the
coral beach at Bovoni Point (31⁄2 hours; $72–$79).
Golfing at Mahogany Run: Designed by Tom and George Fazio,
Mahogany Run is one of the most beautiful courses in the West Indies.
This 18-hole, par-70 course rises and drops like a roller coaster on its
journey to the sea. You can also make arrangements for play on your
own (% 800-253-7103, ext. 1, or 340-777-6250, ext. 1). Greens fees are
$130, including cart; the 20- to 30-minute taxi ride costs you about $10
each way (5 hours; $170).

St. Thomas

St. John Eco-Hike: Take the ferry to St. John for a walkabout through the
Virgin Islands National Park. The Lind Point Trail ascends about 250 feet
to the Lind Point Overlook for views of St. John, St. Thomas, and the sur-
rounding islands. An expert guide discusses the park’s ecosystem and
St. John’s cultural history while you walk to Honeymoon Beach for a
little swimming (4 hours; $64).
Water Island Bike Trip and Beach Adventure: After a ferry ride to Water
Island, a five-minute bus ride takes you to the island’s highest point, from
which you get a nice downhill ride. Your guide will point out various his-
toric sites and wildlife en route to Honeymoon Beach (31⁄2 hours; $79).
Exploring on your own in St. Thomas
Taxis are the chief means of transport here. They’re unmetered, but a
guide of point-to-point fares around the island is included in most tourist
magazines. Less formal, privately owned taxi vans make unscheduled
stops along major traffic arteries, charging less than a dollar for most
rides.
Within walking distance: In days of yore, seafarers from all over the
globe flocked to the old Danish town of Charlotte Amalie, including
pirates and, during the Civil War, Confederate sailors. The main streets
(called Gades here in honor of their Danish heritage) are a veritable
shopping mall, especially close to the waterfront. Stray farther landward
and you can find pockets of 19th-century houses and the truly charming,
cozy, brick-and-stone St. Thomas Synagogue, built in 1833 by Sephardic
Jews. There’s a great view from here as well. It’s located high on steep,
sloping Crystal Gade.
Dating from 1672, Fort Christian, 32 Raadets Gade, rises from the harbor
to dominate the center of town. Named after the Danish king Christian V,
the structure has been everything from a governor’s residence to a jail.
Many pirates were hanged in its courtyard.
Seven Arches Museum, on Government Hill (% 340-774-9295), is a two-
century-old Danish house completely restored to its original condition
and furnished with antiques. You can walk through the yellow ballast
arches and visit the great room with its view of the busy harbor.
Admission is $5.
The Paradise Point Tramway (% 340-774-9809) affords visitors a dra-
matic view of Charlotte Amalie Harbor at a peak height of 697 feet. The
tramways transport customers from the Havensight area to Paradise
Point, where riders disembark to visit shops and a popular restaurant
and bar. The cost is $16 round-trip.
Shopping is a main attraction in St. Thomas, and Main Street is the main
shopping street. To the north is the fully stocked Back Street. The
Waterfront Highway also sports stores, and you can always check out
the side streets, alleys, and walkways between these principal streets.

St. John

Dating back to 1672 and dominating the center of town, Fort Christian
was named after the Danish monarch Christian V and has served as
everything from a governor’s residence to a prison. Some of the cells
have become part of the Virgin Islands Museum. Historical artifacts are
on display at the small facility.
Beyond walking distance: The lush St. Peter Greathouse Estate and
Gardens, at the corner of St. Peter Mountain Road (Rte. 40) and Barrett
Hill Road (% 340-774-4999), ornaments 11 acres on the volcanic peaks
of the island’s northern rim. It’s the creation of Howard Lawson DeWolfe,
a Mayflower descendant who, with his wife, Sylvie, bought the estate in
1987 and set about transforming it into a tropical paradise. It’s filled with
some 200 varieties of plants and trees, including an umbrella plant from
Madagascar. There’s also a rain forest, an orchid jungle, waterfalls, and
reflecting ponds. From a panoramic deck you can see some 20 of the
Virgin Islands. The house itself is worth a visit, its interior filled with
local art. Admission is $10.
St. Thomas has some good beaches, all of which are easily reached by
taxi. Arrange for your driver to return and pick you up at a designated
time. If you’re going to St. John, you may want to do your beaching there.
St. Thomas’s beaches are open to the public, but some charge a fee. The
most well known (and most popular for windsurfing) is Sapphire Beach
on the east end of the island. Rent snorkeling gear or lounge chairs, or
stretch out on its white-coral sand and take in the sun and the spectacu-
lar views of the bay. Other worthwhile beaches are Magens Bay, Coki
Beach (at the Marine Park), and the Morningstar, just 2 miles from port.
If you check out the beaches on St. Thomas, be sure to protect your
belongings — pickpockets and thieves have been known to strike. Also,
to ensure that you don’t miss the boat, arrange for a cab to pick you up
at a specific time.
Exploring on your own in St. John
A tiny gem, lush St. John lies about 3 miles east of St. Thomas across
Pillsbury Sound. It’s the smallest and least populated of the U.S. Virgins,
and since 1956, more than half of St. John’s land mass, as well as its shore-
line waters, have been set aside as the Virgin Islands National Park, and
today the island leads the Caribbean in eco- (or “sustainable”) tourism.
Miles of winding hiking trails lead to panoramic views and the ruins of
18th-century Danish plantations. Because St. John is easy to reach from
St. Thomas, and the beaches are spectacular, many cruise ship passen-
gers spend their entire stay there.
Within walking distance: There are shopping, bars, and restaurants
right by the docks. Otherwise, the most popular way to get around St.
John is by surrey-style taxi. Typical fares from Cruz Bay are $5.50 to
Trunk Bay, $7 to Cinnamon Bay, and $11 to Maho Bay. Taxis wait at the
pier. You can also rent open-sided jeeps. Avis and Hertz both have
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
356

offices here. Just remember to drive on the left, even though steering
wheels are on the left, too. Go figure.
Beyond walking distance: At the Virgin Islands National Park, head to
the visitor center (% 340-776-6201) right on the dock at St. Cruz, where
you can view some exhibits and find out more about what you can see
and do in the park. You can explore the park on the more than 20 miles
of biking trails; rent your own car, Jeep, or Mini-Moke; or hike. The start-
ing points of some trails are within walking distance while others can
be reached by taxi for about $5 to $20. Within the park, try to see the
Annaberg Ruins, Leinster Bay Road, where the Danes founded thriving
plantations and a sugar mill in 1718. They’re located off North Shore
Road, east of Trunk Bay on the north shore.
To beach it, Trunk Bay is your best bet for the local beach experience,
especially for snorkelers, who can rent gear and explore the underwater
trail near the shore. Trunk Bay has amenities, such as showers, a
snack shop, and lifeguards, but it also has crowds. Hawksnest Beach,
Cinnamon Bay, Honeymoon Beach, Maho Bay, and Salt Pond Bay are
all good beach choices.
Enjoying the Cruise Lines’ Private Islands
Several cruise lines have spent millions to create their own fantasy
islands (or at least beaches), giving passengers a beach day without the
hassle of having to find the place. You normally get a whole day to bake
on the beach, swim, snorkel, play beach games, go water-skiing or para-
sailing, or take advantage of whatever fancy facilities the cruise line has
built. Children’s activities may involve playground facilities, beach walks,
and games. The islands typically have several beaches (the farthest off
usually being the quietest), several bars, live music, and at least a few
places to get lunch, usually of the barbecue variety.
Among the islands, only Disney’s has docking facilities allowing passen-
gers to just walk out onto the island. At all the others, you must ride a
tender back and forth from the ship. Make sure to alert the crew if you
require special assistance or a little “tender” loving care.
 Costa Cruises: Passengers on Costa’s eastern Caribbean itineraries
spend a day at Catalina Island, off the coast of the Dominican
Republic, enjoying a long beach fringed by palm trees; opportuni-
ties for volleyball, beach Olympics, and snorkeling (plus jet skiing
and banana-boat rides for a fee); and massages on the beach. Music
and barbecue round out the day, and there’s also a strip of shops
hawking jewelry, beachwear, and other souvenirs.
 Disney Cruise Line: The 1,000-acre, 3×2-mile Castaway Cay (pro-
nounced key) is a port of call on all Disney cruises, and is definitely
the most elaborate of the private islands. Guests can swim and
snorkel, rent bikes and boats, get their hair braided, shop, send
Chapter 15: Landing in the Caribbean 357

postcards, go parasailing, have a massage, take a nature hike, or
just lounge in a hammock or on the beach, snarfing barbecue.
Families can head to their own beach, lined with lounge chairs and
pastel-colored umbrellas, where they can swim, explore a 12-acre
snorkeling course, climb around on the offshore water-play struc-
tures, or rent a kayak, paddle boat, banana boat, sailboat, or other
beach equipment. Teens have a beach of their own, as do adults
(on the far end of the island), and kids 3 to 12 can play at a super-
vised children’s activity center whose highlight is an excavation
site where kids can dig till they find something, then make plaster
molds of whatever it might be.
 Holland America: Located on the Bahamian island of San Salvador,
Half Moon Cay is a port of call on most of the line’s Caribbean and
Panama Canal cruises. Though the island is large, spreading out over
2,500 acres, Holland America has developed only 45 acres of it, main-
taining the rest as a wild-bird reserve on behalf of the Bahamian
National Trust. You can explore a network of hiking trails while keep-
ing an eye out for all sorts of birds, including terns, shearwaters, and
Bahamian pintails. Families can appreciate the new water park at one
end of the beach, as well as the offshore play areas. Massages are
available in huts along the beach, and big-spenders can also get air-
conditioned beachfront cabanas with an open bar and butler service.
La di da. Away from the main beach area, you can spend extra to go
horseback riding, swim around with 26 resident stingrays, or go
windsurfing, snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving, deep-sea fishing,
parasailing, sailboarding, or aqua-cycling.
 Norwegian Cruise Line: Norwegian bought the small, uninhabited
Bahamian island of Great Stirrup Cay in 1977, making it the oldest
of the private cruise line islands. Passengers can ride paddle boats,
sail Sunfish, go snorkeling or parasailing, hop on a banana boat,
join a game of volleyball, get a massage at one of the beachside 
stations, or do nothing more than sunbathe all day long. For kids,
organized activities include volleyball tournaments and sandcastle
building.
 Princess Cruises: Princess set up Princess Cays in 1992 on the
southwest coast of Eleuthera in The Bahamas, and today makes it a
stop on most eastern and western Caribbean itineraries. The half-
mile of shoreline gives passengers room to swim, snorkel, and
make use of Princess’s fleet of Hobie Cats, Sunfish, banana boats,
kayaks, and paddle-wheelers (bookable aboard ship before your
visit). There’s also live music, a dance area, and a beach barbecue,
plus a strip of several dozen tree-shaded hammocks at the far end
of the beach. For kids, there’s a supervised play area with a sand-
box and a pirate ship–themed playground.
 Royal Caribbean (and Celebrity): Sister lines Royal Caribbean and
Celebrity have two different private spots, which often figure into
their itineraries. CocoCay (also known as Little Stirrup Cay) is a
small, 140-acre dot in The Bahamas’ Berry Islands. You can find lots
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
358

of beach, hammocks, food, drink, and watersports, plus such activi-
ties as limbo contests, water-balloon tosses, relay races, and volley-
ball tournaments. Kids get an aqua park that includes a floating
trampoline, water slides, and a sunken airplane and schooner for
snorkelers. For something quieter there’s Wanderer’s Beach, with
calm surf and ultrasoft sand. The line’s other beach stop is
Labadee, an isolated, very private 270-acre peninsula along Haiti’s
north coast. Five beaches are spread around the peninsula, and are
progressively less crowded the farther you walk from the dock. In
the Columbus Cove area, a children’s aqua park called Arawak Cay
is full of floating trampolines, inflatable iceberg-shaped slides, and
water seesaws. Kayaking and parasailing are offered from a dock
nearby. A big plus at Labadee is the authentic and high-quality
music and dance. On both Labadee and CocoCay, organized chil-
dren’s activities include beach parties, volleyball, seashell collect-
ing, and sand-castle building.

hy visit Alaska? Conjure up some postcard images: towering
mountains, mountainous glaciers, sky-blue icebergs, leaping
whales, lumbering moose, rain-forested fjords, endless tundra, bears and
bald eagles, ravens as big as pug dogs, ice fields as big as cities, lumber-
jacks as big as . . . lumberjacks.
Sail the Caribbean and your megaship may completely dwarf the islands
it visits, visible from miles away. Sail Alaska and that same megaship
looks like a matchstick, completely overawed by the mountains, the
expansive sky, and wilderness that seems to go on forever.
Visit the towns and meet people who embody the frontier spirit that
brought them or their ancestors here. (You can also meet thousands
of seasonal workers who come to serve all you cruise passengers, but
that’s a different story — see the upcoming sidebar, “Cruise ships in
Alaska: Angel or devil?”) Add Alaska’s rich Native culture, its Russian
colonial history, its gold rush mythology, and its “North to the Future”
attitude, and you have one of the world’s great cruise destinations.
Boarding Ship for Alaska
Most Alaska cruises concentrate on the Southeast Alaska panhandle, a
string of islands linked by the waterway known as the Inside Passage.
Some stay entirely within this region, sailing round-trip from Vancouver,
British Columbia, or Seattle, Washington. Others sail north- or south-
bound cruises between one of those ports and the northern towns of
Seward or Whittier, the ports nearest to Alaska’s biggest city, Anchorage.
In addition to the Inside Passage, those cruises also sail through the
Gulf of Alaska and sometimes Prince William Sound.

Luxury lines Crystal and Silversea offer Alaska cruises that sail round-
trip from San Francisco. Most of the small-ship lines sail from one of the
port towns in southeast Alaska (primarily Juneau, but also Ketchikan
and Sitka), though some also operate out of Anchorage and Seattle.
If possible, plan to arrive a day or two before your sailing date, espe-
cially if you have to travel a long distance. You can use that extra day to
recover from jet lag and explore your port of embarkation, all of which
have much to recommend them.
Storming the Shore
All the port towns along the Inside Passage have downtown areas com-
pact enough to tour by foot if you choose — though as in almost every
place that relies heavily on the tourist industry, they have their share of
kitsch. In the most-visited cruise ports, expect a lot of tourist shops
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 361
Cruise ships in Alaska: Angel or devil?
The 49th state is one of the top cruise destinations in the world, with about 750,000 people
cruising there annually. That may not sound like much in the abstract — after all, Alaska’s
a huge state, right? — but two facts make it actually a pretty big figure: (1) Even though
Alaska has more coastline than the rest of the United States combined, cruise ships sail
in only about 20 percent of that area (and really concentrate on about half that); and (2)
the cruise season is incredibly short, only lasting from late May to mid-September. That
leads to crowding in the biggest ports of call, and also to some backlash, with local crit-
ics decrying excessive pedestrian traffic on their city streets, heavy bus traffic on out-
lying roads, and environmental damage to the air and seas.
Some towns, particularly Juneau, Ketchikan, and Skagway, really can get over-
whelmed by cruise passengers at the height of high season, with a potential for more
than 6,000 people floating in daily. The delicate balancing act between the resulting
congestion and the plain fact that tourism provides the state’s second largest pool of
jobs has led to debate in recent years over imposing head taxes on cruise passen-
gers, with the proceeds going to infrastructure support, conservation efforts, and other
initiatives. The latest effort, which would have slapped a $46 tax on every passenger
sailing state waters, was defeated in the Alaska legislature in May 2005, but don’t
expect debate to end.
On the environmental front, several well-publicized cases of illegal dumping over the
past decade have led the cruise industry to institute in-house and industry-wide com-
pliance and monitoring — after all, they can’t sell cruises to pristine Alaska if they’re
perceived as making it less pristine. State and local governments also have a hand in
minimizing cruise ships’ impact in some of Alaska’s most famous wild places. Glacier
Bay, for example, has a strict permit system that allows in only two large cruise ships
and several smaller vessels on any given day.

owned by out-of-state merchants, staffed by seasonal workers, and
stocked with “Alaskan” merchandise that’s actually made in China or
Indonesia. Yuck, we say. Yuck. Luckily, no matter how crowded and
touristy the area around the docks, all ports also offer ways of seeing
some of the real Alaska, either on your own or via shore excursions.
In addition to the standard walking tours, bus tours, and even a few
horse-drawn carriage tours, cruise lines also offer a slew of active,
adventurous, and sometimes educational excursions. You can choose
among mountain-biking, hiking, and kayaking trips; salmon fishing expe-
ditions; helicopter and floatplane flightseeing; rafting trips through
wildlife refuges; dogsled trips and workshops; visits to Alaska Native
towns and tribal houses; brewery tours (who says they’re not educa-
tional!?); and many other options.
At the adventurous (and expensive) extreme of excursion offerings,
flightseeing trips show the vast and varied Alaskan landscape from the
air. Tour operators offer these trips via small planes and helicopters, and
sometimes pair them with unforgettable options such as landing on a
glacier for a trek across the ice — an option we took recently which was,
bar none, one of the top experiences we’ve ever had on a cruise.
Shore excursion prices we list in this chapter are for 2005 and may
increase slightly in 2006.
If you’re touring on your own, you need a taxi or shuttle to get to the more
outlying attractions — for example, Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau or
Saxman Totem Pole Park in Ketchikan. We provide information in each
port write-up on which attractions you can walk to and which require
wheels. You probably need to avail yourself of transportation in the large
embarkation ports (such as Anchorage, Seattle, and Vancouver), though
each has a walkable downtown core.
Watching Whales
Whales are a huge draw on Alaska cruises, ranking right up there with
calving glaciers and Alaska Amber beer. On most large cruise ships, the
captain or officer on watch makes an announcement when he or she
spots a whale, at which point half the people on board crane their necks
in the same direction.
We’ll be honest with you: Whale-watching takes patience, because
frankly, whales spend a lot of time underwater. What the spotter is
seeing is typically the curve of the whale’s back as he slides through the
water, or the flash of his tail as he makes a deep sounding dive. It can be
minutes before he comes up again, and you never know exactly where
that may happen.
Humpbacks are definitely the stars of the Alaska whale-watching show,
easily recognized by their huge, mottled tails; by the hump on their
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
364

back, just forward of its dorsal fin; and by their armlike flippers, which
can grow to be 14 feet long. These migratory whales spend all their sum-
mers in Alaska, feeding on small fish and other tiny creatures that they
filter through strips of stiff, fibrous baleen — the material that hump-
backs have instead of teeth. Most humpback sightings are of the whales’
humped backs as they cruise along the surface, resting, and of the flukes
of the tail as they dive. Feeding dives can last a long time and often mean
you won’t see that particular whale again, but if you’re lucky, the whale
may be just dipping down for a few minutes before breaching — leaping
straight out of the water, twisting around in midair before falling back
with a gigantic kersploosh! No one knows for sure why they do this,
though to look at them it seems obvious: They’re enjoying themselves.
Orcas, or “killer whales,” are probably the next most frequently
sighted. Easily identified by their stark black-and-white patches, they’re
the ocean’s top predator, moving like wolves in highly structured family
groups called pods and swimming at up to 25 knots (about 29 mph) in
pursuit of salmon, porpoises, seals, sea lions, and almost anything else
that moves — except man, oddly enough. Like dolphins, orcas often pop
above the surface in a flashing, graceful arc when they travel, giving
viewers a glance at their sleek shape, markings, and tall dorsal fin. On a
recent trip, we spotted a pod of Orcas coming straight toward our ship.
As passengers watched, the group — at least ten strong, the younger
whales flanked by their parents — turned and sliced through the water
no more than 20 feet off the ship’s port side, the sun shining off their
sleek, angular dorsal fins and panda-colored backs. It was “a moment.”
You may also spot Beluga whales and Minke whales. Belugas are the
small, white whales with the cute rounded beaks. More likely to be con-
fused for a dolphin than any other whale, belugas are larger and fatter
than a dolphin and lack the dolphin’s dorsal fin. Adults are all white,
while juveniles are gray, and they swim in large packs that can number
in the dozens, feeding on salmon. Minkes are the smallest of the baleen
whales, generally under 26 feet long, with a blackish-gray body, a white
stomach, a narrow, triangular head, and white bands on its flippers.
When breaching, minkes leap something like dolphins, gracefully reen-
tering the water headfirst — unlike humpbacks, which smash down on
their sides. Also unlike the humpbacks, they don’t raise their flukes
clear of the water when they dive.
Choosing a Cruisetour
If you have additional time and dough, consider booking a cruisetour
package that combines a cruise with a land tour via bus, train, and
sometimes boat and plane. That’s the only way you get to see some of
the Alaskan Interior, which is vastly different from the rain forest ecosys-
tem of Southeast Alaska. Holland America, Princess, Royal Caribbean,
and Celebrity Cruises are the bigwigs in the cruisetour market, each
with their own transportation infrastructure. Holland America and
Princess also own their own hotels and lodges.
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 365

Cruise lines typically offer a number of different cruisetour options, con-
centrating on different regions.
A typical Anchorage/Denali/Fairbanks cruisetour package may include
a 7-night Vancouver–Anchorage cruise, followed by 2 nights in Anchorage
and a private railcar ride to Denali National Park for a full day in the
park and a 2-night stay at one of the cruise line’s lodges. If you’re lucky,
the cloud gods will part to give you a look at Mount McKinley, North
America’s highest peak at 20,320 feet. From there, you go by train to
Fairbanks, spending two more days on activities that may include day
cruises on the Chena and Tanana Rivers, jet boat rides, and excursions
to gold mines and dredges. Passengers typically fly home from Fairbanks.
A shorter variation of that itinerary may skip Fairbanks and return to
Anchorage for departure.
Other cruisetours hop the border into Canada’s huge Yukon Territory,
combining a 3- or 4-day cruise between Vancouver and Juneau/Skagway
with a land program into the Klondike. Passengers travel by rail, river-
boat, motor coach, and sometimes air, with overnight stops in the terri-
torial capital of Whitehorse and the picturesque Gold Rush town of
Dawson City. From there it’s back to Fairbanks, then through Denali to
Anchorage and home. The tour can be taken in either direction.
Other cruisetour options include an add-on to Wrangell–St. Elias
National Park, east of Anchorage, and a Canadian Rockies cruisetour
offers some of the finest mountain scenery on earth, visiting Canada’s
Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and other national and provin-
cial parks. The beautiful Lake Louise, colored deep green from its min-
eral content, is located 35 miles north of Banff.
The cost of a cruisetour typically includes hotel stays, transportation
(usually train and/or bus and sometimes a plane or ferry), and a limited
number of meals (usually only while in transit).
The Ports of Embarkation
You have to start somewhere, and for an Alaska cruise you’ll likely start
in Vancouver, Seattle, or Seward/Whittier (which serve as ports for
nearby Anchorage). Some small ships also sail itineraries that begin
and/or end in Juneau and Ketchikan.
Anchorage
No, Anchorage isn’t the capital of Alaska, though a lot of people think it
should be. It’s the state’s largest city and one of the newest big cities in
the U.S., only really taking off as a population center after World War II.
The city was badly beaten up by the great quake and resulting tsunami
of 1964, which rivaled in strength the one that hit South Asia 40 years
later, though with far less loss of life. Today it’s a modern city with good

port on Gulf of Alaska cruises, it actually isn’t. It’s located on the wrong
side of the Kenai Peninsula from the usual cruise ship routes, so ships
typically dock instead in the towns of Seward or Whittier, both located
on the southeast side. The switcheroo saves a whole day of sailing, let-
ting the ships concentrate more of their sea time on the Inside Passage,
then bus passengers overland to Anchorage itself (2–3 hours from
Seward, about 90 minutes from Whittier).
Neither Seward nor Whittier offers much to hold visitor interest, and
most people tend to head right from bus to ship, or the other way
around. Cruise lines also offer several shore excursions from each port:
sportfishing in Seward, for example, or sea kayaking near Whittier in
Prince William Sound. Other excursions tour Anchorage before dropping
passengers off at the international airport.
If you have time in Seward, visit the Alaska SeaLife Center, on the water-
front at Mile 0 of the Seward Highway (% 800-224-2525; www.alaska
sealife.org). A major research aquarium founded with Exxon restitu-
tions following the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill, the center allows 

scientists and visitors (the latter through windows) to study sea lions,
porpoises, sea otters, harbor seals, fish, and other forms of marine life
that abound in the area, as well as many species of local seabirds.
Admission is $14 adults, $11 ages 7 to 12, free 6 and under.
Whittier’s only real attraction is that it’s Anchorage’s closest gateway
to the wilderness splendor of Prince William Sound, accessible by both
road and rail via the 21⁄2-mile Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel. Born as
an army town, Whittier retains its barracks-like ambience, with almost
every resident (and the grocery store, and the medical center) living in
the 14-story Begich Towers. You heard that right: Almost everyone in
town lives in that one building. An underground walkway links it with
the local school so that the kids don’t have to plough through the 14 feet
of snow Whittier endures every year.
Exploring on your own
Anchorage’s downtown area is a manageable 8-by-20 blocks, with some
areas catering strictly to tourists and others obviously for locals only. The
Visitor Bureau’s Log Cabin Visitor Information Center is at 4th Avenue
and F Street (% 907-274-3531; www.anchorage.net). Across the intersec-
tion, in the old post office, the Alaska Public Lands Information Center
(605 W. 4th Ave., Suite 105; % 907-271-2737; www.nps.gov/aplic) can
help anyone planning to spend time outdoors anywhere in Alaska.
Within walking distance: If you visit town on a weekday from June to
August, you can join one of the historic tours hosted by Alaska Historic
Properties (% 907-274-3600). Meet in the lobby of the old City Hall (524
W. 4th Ave.; next to the Log Cabin Visitor Information Center) at 1 p.m.
The one-hour tours cover about 2 miles and cost $5.
You can view contemporary Alaskan art and a large collection covering
Alaskan history and anthropology in the galleries of the Anchorage
Museum of History and Art (121 W. 7th Ave., between A and C streets;
% 907-343-4326; www.anchoragemuseum.org).
If you want a dose of the outdoors, stretch your legs along the paved, 
11-mile Tony Knowles Coastal Trail, which follows the water from the
western end of 2nd Avenue to Kincaid Park. You can hop on the trail at
several points, including Elderberry Park at the western end of 5th
Avenue. You can also rent a bike from Downtown Bicycle Rental (333 W.
4th Ave.; % 907-279-5293; www.alaska-bike-rentals.com) for $15 for
the first three hours and $2.50 for each hour thereafter, up to a total of
$29 for a 24-hour rental.
Most of the shopping is very kitschy, but there are a few goodies in the
mix. The Cook Island Book Company (415 W. 5th Ave.; % 907-258-4544;
www.cookinlet.com) has a huge and in-depth stock of Alaska-oriented
books. The Oomingmak Musk Ox Producers’ Co-operative (604 H St.
at 6th Ave.; % 888-360-9665; www.qiviut.com) is a co-op owned by
Alaska Native women in villages across the state. All of their products
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
368

are knitted from qiviut (kiv-ee-oot), the light, warm, silky — and rare —
underhair of the musk ox.
Beyond walking distance: The Alaska Native Heritage Center (8800
Heritage Center Dr.; % 800-315-6608; www.alaskanative.net) is
located about 15 minutes from downtown Anchorage and provides a
great introduction to the lives and cultures of the state’s five major
Native groups: Southeast Alaska’s Tlingit, Eyak, Haida, and Tsimshian
tribes; the Athabascans of the Interior; the Inupiat and St. Lawrence
Island Yupik Natives of the far north; the Aleuts and Alutiiqs of the
Aleutian Islands; and the Yup’ik and Cup’ik tribes of the extreme west.
The center features reconstructions of traditional Native dwellings,
Native interpreters to explain what life was like in traditional communi-
ties; a small museum displaying some remarkable carvings and masks; a
workshop for Native craftspeople; a theater presenting a rotating series
of films on Native culture; and a rotunda for storytelling, dance, and
music performances. Admission is $21. A free shuttle leaves regularly
from the Anchorage Museum, the Anchorage Visitors Center at 4th
Avenue and F Street, and several other sites. Times are posted at all
pickup points, or call % 907-330-8000.
If you’re traveling with kids, Anchorage offers a few kid-centric options,
including the H2Oasis Water Park (1520 O’Malley Rd.; % 888-H2OASIS;
www.h2oasiswaterpark.com), which offers a wave pool that generates
3-to-4-foot waves, a 150-foot long enclosed body slide, a children’s lagoon,
a pirate’s ship, water cannons, and other fun. A day pass for an adult (13
and older) costs $20; children under 13 pay $15. About 8 miles south of
downtown, the Alaska Zoo (4731 O’Malley Rd.; % 907-346-3242; www.
alaskazoo.org) affords you a closer look at many Alaskan animal
species and some non-native varieties. Admission is $9 adults, $5 kids.
If you want to head out of town and into the wild, the Alaska Public
Lands Information Center can show you a good route to the easily
accessible and scenic Chugach Mountains. Or you can take a drive
along Turnagain Arm, which stretches roughly 50 miles south of
Anchorage to the funky little town of Girdwood. The road provides
breathtaking mountain views and the possibility of wildlife sightings,
including moose, Dall sheep, and occasionally beluga whales, all right
from your car window. You can rent a car in Anchorage (see the appen-
dix for toll-free numbers of rental firms) or take one of the seven- or ten-
hour tours offered by Gray Line of Alaska (% 800-544-2206; http://
graylinealaska.com), which include Turnagain Arm and a boat ride to
Portage Glacier.
Vancouver, British Columbia
Most cruise ships that explore the Inside Passage and Gulf of Alaska use
Vancouver as the main southern embarkation and debarkation port.
Originally scouted out by the Spanish (uh, after Canada’s First Nations
people had already been there 12,000 years or so, we mean), Vancouver
was named for Captain George Vancouver, who led a British expedition
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 369

to the region in 1792, beginning the era of British control. Fur traders
really got things rolling here in the early and mid-19th century, with
more people arriving during the gold fever of the 1850s and 60s, but it
wasn’t until the Canadian Pacific Railway set up a terminus here in 1884
that the city really began to boom. Today it’s a lovely, friendly city sur-
rounded by mountains and ocean, with a rich vein of Northwest Coast
Native culture, a thriving Asian community, a great arts scene, and a bla-
tantly friendly populace.
The Canadian dollar (C$1.25 = US$1; C$1 = US80¢) is Canada’s official
currency (this exchange rate was during a period when the U.S. dollar’s
value was the pits; let’s hope it’s better when you read this!). We quote
all prices in this section in U.S. dollars.
Cruising into port
Most cruise ships dock at Canada Place (% 604-666-7200; www.canada
place.ca) at the end of Burrard Street. The pier terminal is a landmark
in the city, noted for its five-sail structure, which reaches into the harbor
like a ship setting off. It’s located at the edge of the downtown district
and is just a quick stroll from the Gastown area (see below) and other
area attractions. Some ships may dock at the Ballantyne cruise terminal,
about five minutes away by taxi.
Scoring the best excursions
Coastal Rainforest Adventure: This bus tour acquaints you with
Vancouver’s downtown area before continuing out to Capilano Canyon,
where you go on a 2-mile walk through the rain forest. A naturalist guide
provides insight as you go (31⁄2 hours; $73).
Capilano Suspension Bridge and Grouse Mountain Skyride: Afraid
of heights? Don’t go on this tour, which visits the historic Capilano
Suspension Bridge, a walkway that sways 230 feet above the canyon
below. From here, you take the Grouse Mountain Skyride to the 4,000-
foot summit, where you can hike one of the nature trails or grab lunch
(31⁄2 hours; $63).
Exploring on your own
The Tourism Vancouver Infocentre is near the piers, as are hotels,
restaurants, and shops.
Within walking distance: So close to the ship pier that you can’t
miss it, Gastown is a charming area of historic buildings, cobblestone
streets, and gaslights (although the area’s name actually comes from a
19th-century saloon-owner, “Gassy” Jack Deighton). Tourists enjoy the
bohemian atmosphere, complete with street musicians, antiques and art
shops, boutiques, cafes, and clubs.
Besides featuring delicious Asian cuisine and shops selling Chinese
goods, Vancouver’s Chinatown is also a historic district, and one of the

largest Chinese neighborhoods in North America. The area’s most
famous attraction is the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden (578 Carrall St.; % 604-
689-7133; www.vancouverchinesegarden.com), a perfectly traditional
Chinese garden based on the yin-yang principle. Admission is $6.60.
Check out Robson Street and the Pacific Centre Mall for trendy fash-
ions and bargains.
Cruise passengers may be particularly interested in visiting an exhibit of
a 19th-century immigrant ship’s steerage deck at the Vancouver Museum
(1100 Chestnut St.; % 604-736-4431; www.vanmuseum.bc.ca), which
covers the history of the city from prehistoric times to the present.
Admission is $8.
Beyond walking distance: Just a few miles from downtown Vancouver,
northwest of the cruise ship terminal, the 1,000 acres of Stanley Park con-
tain gorgeous rose gardens, hiking trails, totem poles, a kids’ water park,
and the Vancouver Aquarium (% 604-659-FISH; www.vanaqua.org), one
of the largest in North America. Admission to the aquarium is $14.
Downtown, not far inland from the cruise docks, Robson Street is full
of boutiques, souvenir shops, coffeehouses, and bistros. About 15 min-
utes’ walk from downtown across False Creek, Granville Island (www.
granvilleisland.com) is a former industrial site whose warehouses
and factories now house galleries, artist studios, restaurants, theaters,
and lots of shopping.
Seattle, Washington
A longtime embarkation port for small ships, Seattle is now home base
for some of Norwegian Cruise Line’s and Holland America’s big ships.
Seattle has shopping, fine restaurants, attractions galore, good air serv-
ice, and culture. It is very much a water-oriented city, set between Puget
Sound and Lake Washington, with Lake Union in the center.
Similar to Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco, the Seattle waterfront is
both touristy and home to some great restaurants and shops, as well as
the popular Seattle Aquarium. It runs along Alaskan Way from Yesler
Way North to Bay Street and Myrtle Edwards Park.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at Pier 66 (the Bell St. Terminal), right in downtown
Seattle, or at the new Pier 30 terminal, 2431 East Marginal Way S., at the
south end of Seattle’s downtown waterfront, just a few minutes away by
car or taxi.
Scoring the best excursions
Seattle Duck Tour: Explore Seattle in a WWII-era amphibious tour bus,
which explores the Seattle waterfront, historic Pioneer Square, Safeco
Field, Pike Place Market, and the downtown shopping district before
driving right into Lake Union (11⁄2 hours; $23).

Bus Tour: A standard bus tour that includes the Space Needle and shop-

Exploring on your own
The Visitors Bureau’s Citywide Concierge Center is located at the
Washington State Convention and Trade Center, on Pike Street between
7th and 8th Avenues, on the Galleria level.
Within walking distance: A National Historic District, Pike Place
Market (between Pike and Pine Streets at First Avenue; % 206-682-7453;
www.pikeplacemarket.org) provides a venue for some 200 local arti-
sans and fine artists to display and sell their wares, and for countless
street performers, restaurants, and literally hundreds of shops. Two
blocks from the market, the Seattle Art Museum (100 University St;
% 206-654-3100; www.seattleartmuseum.org) has a great collection
of Northwest Coast Indian art and diverse exhibits ranging from Andy
Warhol to African masks. Admission is $7; closed Mondays.
If the huge octopus at the Seattle Aquarium (1483 Alaskan Way, in
Waterfront Park; % 206-386-4320; www.seattleaquarium.org) doesn’t
pull you in, its well-designed exhibits about Puget Sound sea life will.
Admission is $12 adults, $8 kids 3 to 5, free for 2 and under.
Built for the 1962 World’s Fair, the 600-foot Space Needle (400 Broad St.;
% 206-443-2111; www.spaceneedle.com) has become a symbol of

Seattle, pointing to the architectural trends of some Jetsonian future
that may or may not arrive. You can enjoy fantastic views from the obser-
vation deck or dine in either of two equally expensive restaurants inside.
Admission is $13. Next door, the newish, bizarro-looking Experience
Music Project (% 877-367-5483; www.emplive.com) is a combination
museum, performance center, and school, with displays, interactive music
rooms, performance spaces, galleries, and research facilities dedicated to
all aspects of American popular music. Admission is $20.
Beyond walking distance: Across Puget Sound in Blake Island State
Marine Park is Tillicum Village, another surprising legacy of the 1962
World’s Fair. You arrive by boat to this incredibly scenic spot where
totem poles guard a traditional Northwest Coast Indian longhouse sur-
rounded by forest (which is pretty much the whole “village,” despite the
name). Inside the longhouse is a large restaurant and performance hall
where you can watch traditional masked dances while you enjoy an
alder-smoked salmon dinner. Tillicum Village Tours (Pier 56; % 206-
933-8600; www.tillicumvillage.com) operates visits that include
round-trip boat transportation to the village, an elegant dinner, and
dance performance. The cost is $69.
The Ports of Call
Generally, a ship visits three or four ports of call during a 7-night Alaska
itinerary, plus the ports of embarkation and debarkation and several
outstanding natural areas. The ports and areas in this section are the
most popular.
Haines
Surrounded by snowcapped mountains, Haines is the quintessential
quiet, small Alaska town, the kind of place where you wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see a moose wandering down Main Street. It was established in
1879 not as a gold rush town like Skagway (its neighbor 15 miles up the
Lynn Canal) but as a missionary town. The U.S. military arrived in the
early 20th century and built Fort William Seward, a very unmilitary-
looking military base, which was deactivated after World War II and is
now a local tourist attraction, with a replica of a Tlingit clan house on its
9-acre parade grounds. The surrounding buildings, once barracks and
officers’ quarters, have been converted to private homes, B&Bs, and
arts-and-performance spaces.
Downtown Haines has an almost totally local character, with an assort-
ment of shops and museums mixed in. Only a few large ships dock here
(plus a number of small ships), partially due to the lack of a large, deep-
water dock, partly because there are few big local attractions. But that’s
just what makes Haines appealing: It’s not just a tourist town.

Cruising into port
Small ships tie up to the Port Chilkoot Dock, directly opposite Fort
William Seward, about a half-mile from downtown. Larger vessels must
anchor offshore and bring passengers in by tender, arriving either at
Port Chilkoot or at the small-boat harbor in the downtown area. Visitor
information is available at the dock. Most ships provide shuttle service
to Main Street, or you can walk down Front Street to Main.
Scoring the best excursions
Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve Float Trip: Haines is one of the best places
on earth to see bald eagles, and the Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve, about
20 miles outside town, is probably the best place to see them near
Haines. An expert guide rows your rubber raft and provides commen-
tary on the area’s natural environment, keeping an eye out for eagles,
moose, bears, and wolves (4 hours; $99).

Chilkoot Lake Bicycle Adventure: After driving to your start point,
you can ride 8 miles along the shore of Lutak Inlet, where the river meets
the sea. Highlights include some amazing views of the lake, glaciers,
waterfalls, and mountains, and a chance at spotting eagles and bears
(3 hours; $87).
Chilkat Nature Hike: A guide tells you all about Alaskan rain forests as
you hike this moderately difficult 5-mile trail. With any luck, you may
catch a glimpse of a bald eagle (4 hours; $65).
Taste of Haines Tour: Visit the Haines Brewing Company, the smallest
brewery in Alaska, for a sample and a talk with the brewmaster. Then
head to a local smoked-salmon shop to sample and learn how that stuff
is prepared (2 hours; $55).
Best of Haines by Classic Car: Explore Haines in a 1930s- or 1940s-
vintage car while your driver shares the history of the area and gives
you a peek into how the townsfolk live when the tourists have gone
home (1 hour; $54).
Exploring on your own
Within walking distance: Just above the dock, at Fort William Seward,
the Alaska Indian Arts Cultural Center (% 907-766-2160) has a small
gallery selling traditional artwork and prints, plus a carvers’ workshop
where you may see totem-carving in progress. Between the fort and the
town center, the American Bald Eagle Foundation and Natural History
Museum (Haines Highway at 2nd Avenue; % 907-766-3094; http://
baldeagles.org) has a huge diorama with more than 180 stuffed eagles
and other critters. Admission is $3.
Main Street has two museums. The Sheldon Museum and Cultural
Center, near the small-boat harbor (% 907-766-2366; www.sheldon
museum.org), has been around since 1925, displaying a collection of
local items and Tlingit art begun by local shopkeepers Steve and Bess
Sheldon. Admission is $3. A more recent addition to the local scene is
Dave and Carol Pohl’s Hammer Museum (108 Main St.; % 907-766-2374;
www.hammermuseum.org), which is exactly what it sounds like, display-
ing more than 1,200 different hammers from around the globe. Admission
is $2.
Beyond walking distance: Not much except the Chilkat Bald Eagle
Preserve, and that’s best visited on a shore excursion (see “Scoring the
best excursions,” earlier in this section).
Juneau
Juneau, Alaska’s state capital and third-largest city (after Anchorage
and Fairbanks), is surrounded by ice fields on three sides and water on
the fourth, which makes it the only U.S. state capital that you can’t drive
to. Another weird fact: Although Juneau’s downtown area looks rela-
tively small, the greater city encompasses 3,108 square miles, making it

Juneau
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 377
simultaneously the largest state capital in terms of mass and probably
the only one that includes ice fields within its city limits. In spite of all
this, Juneau is actually a fairly cosmopolitan city (by Alaskan standards,
certainly) and one of the most-visited ports for cruise ships, with four or
five ships making port here virtually every day during the summer
season. If you’re sailing an Inside Passage itinerary, you’ll almost cer-
tainly stop here.
Juneau had its foundations in gold mining, beginning when Chief Kowee
of the Auk Tlingit clan led miners Joe Juneau and Richard Harris to a
local strike. As soon as you disembark ship, look up along the Mount
Roberts Tramway to spot the ruins of the Alaska-Juneau Mill on the
mountainside. Known locally as the A-J, it produced a whopping 3.5 mil-
lion ounces of gold before it closed in 1944, effectively closing the book
on Juneau’s mining economy.
In town, right beyond the end of the dock, you find tourist shops, a great
museum, and wonderful historical architecture, including the State

Capitol Building and a couple of genuine saloons. Various forest hiking
trails, the blue-white Mendenhall Glacier, and several other attractions
are located a short drive out of town.
Cruising into port
Both large and small ships dock right in the downtown area, along
Marine Way. Every once in a while, overcrowding may mean a ship has
to anchor in the channel and tender its passengers to shore.
Scoring the best excursions
Glacier Helicopter Tour: Glaciers are impressive when seen from the
water, but you ain’t seen nothing till you get up above, into the moun-
tains, and see just how unbelievably massive they really are. This heli-
copter tour lands you right on either the Norris or the Mendenhall
Glacier, where you have time to get out and walk around on the surface.
This is one of the best shore excursions we’ve ever taken, anywhere
(21⁄2–61⁄2 hours; $215–$375).
Mendenhall Glacier Float Trip: An experienced rafter steers your ten-
person raft across Mendenhall Lake and past icebergs until you get to
the Mendenhall River and its beautiful scenery. You encounter moder-
ate rapids and stunning views, and get a snack of smoked salmon and
reindeer sausage somewhere along the way (4 hours; $105).
Mendenhall Glacier and City Highlights Tour: Travel by bus from
downtown Juneau to the glacier and its U.S. Forest Service Observatory.
There, as time allows, you can follow one of the nature trails or hike to
within a half-mile of the glacier — which sounds far, but the ice face is
so enormous you’d think you’re within spitting distance. A visit to the
University of Alaska campus and the Gastineau Salmon Hatchery round
out your tour (3 hours; $39). Other tours pair the glacier and hatchery
with an outdoor all-you-can-eat salmon bake, with music and the possi-
bility of beer, though you have to pay extra for that (4 hours; $65).
Bike and Brew Tour: Speaking of beer, this 11-mile bicycle tour takes you
from town along Fritz Cove Road, offers views of picturesque Auke Bay
and the Mendenhall Glacier, then ends at the Alaska Brewing Company
for a tour and sampling of the brew (41⁄2 hours; $80).
Wilderness Lodge Flightseeing Adventure: This tour combines flightsee-
ing over an ice field and glaciers with a salmon bake at the Taku Glacier
Lodge, and enough time for a short nature trail hike (31⁄2 hours; $240).
Exploring on your own
You can find walking maps and visitors’ guides at the visitor informa-
tion center, located right on the dock, in a green building near the base
of the Mount Roberts Tram. Downtown begins right at the end of the
docks, but there’s also a shuttle that circuits the town throughout the
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
378

day. The Davis Log Cabin Visitor Center is located farther up in town,
on Seward Street (% 907-586-2201). It’s a replica of the city’s first
schoolhouse.
Within walking distance: Right on the docks, you can hop on board the
Mount Roberts Tramway (490 S. Franklin St.; % 888-461-TRAM; www.
goldbelttours.com) for a six-minute ride 1,760 feet straight up Mount
Roberts. At the top you’ll find an observation area, a restaurant, shops,
and a series of nature trails through the alpine ecosystem, offering great
views of the Gastineau Channel below. If the sky is overcast, you won’t
get the views, though the trails can still be great — as long as you bring
bug repellent. Tickets are $22.
The Red Dog Saloon (278 S. Franklin St.; % 907-463-3658; www.reddog
saloon.cc) sits right at the intersection just beyond the docks and is a
virtual magnet for cruise passengers. Its self-created legend is that it’s a
wild frontier bar, but actually it’s pretty Disney, but still fun, with a saw-
dust-covered floor, live music, and walls full of memorabilia. The more
authentic Alaskan Bar is across the street at 167 S. Franklin (% 907-
586-1000).
The state’s Russian and Native cultures are well represented at the Alaska
State Museum (395 Whittier St., % 907-465-2901; www.museums.state.
ak.us), which showcases Alaskan art and artifacts. Admission is $5. You
can take a free tour of the Alaska State Capitol (on 4th Street between
Main and Seward; closed Sat afternoon and Sun), which has photomu-
rals depicting the early days of Juneau. A couple blocks to the north,
the octagonal chapel of St. Nicholas Orthodox Church (Fifth and Gold
Streets) was built by the Tlingits in 1893 and remains an active parish
to this day. It’s open daily during tourist season. A small donation is
requested.
Specializing in children’s programs, the small but engaging Juneau-
Douglas City Museum (Fourth and Main Streets; % 907-586-3572; www.
juneau.org/parksrec/museum) displays artifacts from the city’s his-
tory and gold-mining past. Admission is $4 for adults, free for students
and children 18 and under.
Beyond walking distance: About 3 miles from downtown along the
Egan Expressway, you can visit the Macaulay Salmon Hatchery (2697
Channel Dr.; % 877-463-2486), where you get to see every step of the
harvesting and fertilizing of salmon eggs. The resultant offspring are
later released back into the wild. Admission is $3.25. Nearby, off Egan at
Vanderbilt Hill Road (then right on Anka St. and right again on Shaune
Dr.), the Alaskan Brewing Company (5429 Shaune Dr.; % 907-780-5866;
www.alaskanbeer.com) makes that great Alaskan Amber you see every-
where in the state. They offer free daily tours with a sampling of beer at
the end.
Keep going down Egan Expressway to Mendenhall Glacier, about 13 miles
from downtown at the head of Mendenhall Valley. The visitor center here
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 379

(% 907-789-0097; www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/
mendenhall) contains a glacier museum with excellent explanatory
models, computerized displays, and ranger talks. Admission is $3. Trails
of various lengths get you closer to the glacier, the easiest being a half-
mile nature trail.
Ketchikan
Because Ketchikan is the southernmost port of call for Southeast Alaska,
residents call it the “first city” — the first port ships from Vancouver or
Seattle stop on northbound cruises. Although it is Alaska’s fifth-largest
city (with about 8,000 residents!), it likes to project a quirky/quaint fron-
tier image, complete with a quirky/quaint old-time red-light district, Creek
Street, which was in full schving until the 1950s. To cater to tourists,
Ketchikan offers plenty of shopping near the docks, but you can walk past
all that and watch fishing boats set out from the harbor, or head to several
sites that interpret the local Native culture (Ketchikan has the largest con-
centration of Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people in Alaska, and the
world’s largest collection of totem poles).
You may be able to find wetter places than Ketchikan, with its average
rainfall of 13 feet per year, but at a certain point you become too damp
to tell the difference. Suffice to say, it’s wet. Carry a folding umbrella.
Cruising into port
Ships dock right at the pier in Ketchikan’s downtown.
Scoring the best excursions
Misty Fjords Flightseeing: The 2.3-million-acre, Connecticut-size area of
Misty Fjords looks like something out of The Lord of the Rings, with vol-
canic cliffs rising up to 3,150 feet, dense hemlock and spruce forests,
high ridges covered in alpine grass, and a watery passage through it all
that’s so narrow only small ships can get any significant distance in.
That’s why the big ships offer these shore excursions, which fly from
Ketchikan by floatplane. Some do a water landing and then fly out again.
Others bring you to an excursion boat for exploration of the monument,
then make the short cruise back to Ketchikan (2–41⁄2 hours; $220–$285).
Saxman Native Village Tour: Not just another tourist attraction, this
arts and cultural center, situated about 21⁄2 miles outside Ketchikan, is
home to hundreds of Tlingit, Tsimshian, and Haida Natives and is a
center for the revival of Native arts and culture. On this excursion, you
tour the grounds, see a performance by the Cape Fox Dancers at the
Beaver Clan House, and listen to traditional Native stories. You may also
watch artisans demonstrate totem carving (21⁄2 hours; $49).
Sportfishing: You may never get a better chance to catch salmon than
on a chartered fishing boat excursion in this region. The boat crew sup-
plies your fishing gear, tackle, and bait; you catch the fish, and they ship

it home for you, for an added fee (4–6 hours; $169 plus $10 for a fishing
license and another $10 for a king-salmon tag).
Totem Bight Historical Park Tour: A bus takes you through the Tongass
National Forest to this historic Native fish camp, where you can view the
totem poles and a ceremonial clan house. Some tours also visit points of
interest in Ketchikan (21⁄2 hours; $39).
Rainforest Wildlife Sanctuary: After an 8-mile coastal drive, you do a half-
mile hike with a naturalist guide, trying to spot eagles, bear, seals, and var-
ious birdlife. Afterward, you can feed Alaskan reindeer, watch a totem pole
carver at work, and take a tour of a historic sawmill (21⁄2 hours; $79).
Tatoosh Island Sea Kayaking: After a trip to the island by van and
motorboat, you get a quick orientation before heading out on your 90-
minute paddle, where you see some great scenery and (maybe) spot a
few bald eagles and harbor seals (41⁄2 hours; $125).

The Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show: Located a few blocks from the
docks, the show features lumberjack types competing in logrolling,
speed climbing, tree topping, chainsaw carving, and all the other skills
every lumberjack needs. If you don’t book this as an excursion, you can
still buy tickets at the door for the same price (11⁄2 hours; $29).
Exploring on your own
Ketchikan’s downtown port area is completely flat and walkable. Pick up
a walking-tour map at the Ketchikan Visitor Information Center on the
pier. Taxis are also available at the pier if you want to go to Saxman
Indian Village or Totem Bight Park on your own.
Within walking distance: Don’t miss the Southeast Alaska Discovery
Center (50 Main St., only a block from the pier; % 907-228-6214), which
contains an amazing series of dioramas depicting local historical, envi-
ronmental, and cultural themes. Admission is $4. On a smaller scale, the
one-room Tongass Historical Museum (629 Dock St.; % 907-225-5600)
focuses on the Native heritage and history of the city. Admission is $2.
The centerpiece of downtown Ketchikan is Creek Street, a row of
quirky/quaint wooden houses built on pilings above a busy salmon
stream. Once upon a not-so-long-ago time, this was the city’s red-light
district, with more than 30 semi-legal brothels lining the waterway. That
all came to an end in the mid-1950s, and today the houses contain bou-
tiques, restaurants, and galleries featuring the work of local artists.
Dolly’s House, at #24 (% 907-225-2279), preserves one of the last of the
brothels, with tours costing $4. At the end of Creek Street, a funicular
takes you uphill to the Westmark Cape Fox Lodge, which offers nice
views and a small collection of Native carvings out back. Walk through
the lobby and follow the signs to the Married Men’s Trail, allegedly a
route taken by local men to get to Creek Street, back in the day. It makes
for a nice little hike back into town.
You can find totem poles all over town, but you can admire the biggest
collection of 19th-century totem poles in the world indoors at the Totem
Heritage Center (601 Deermount St., a bit of a hike from the lodge and
town; % 907-225-5900). Built by the city in 1976, the place has 33 origi-
nal totems retrieved from several Native villages, kept in their original,
unrestored condition, sometimes with moss still attached. Traditionally,
totem poles are meant to disintegrate naturally, usually lasting about
70 years, but these were preserved to help keep the culture alive.
Admission is $4.
Beyond walking distance: The Alaska Division of Parks maintains
Totem Bight State Historical Park (% 907-247-8574), about 10 miles
outside of town on the North Tongass Highway (a short walk through
the woods is involved), for the preservation of Tlingit totem poles, clan
house, and other artifacts, carved beginning in 1938 as part of a New
Deal/Civilian Conservation Corps project for Native craftsmen.
Admission is free.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
382

Visitors can also view Native artifacts at Saxman Totem Park (% 907-
225-4846; www.capefoxtours.com), located about 21⁄2 miles south of
Ketchikan on the South Tongass Highway in the Saxman Native Village.
The place is really set up more for people on excursions (see “Scoring
the best excursions,” earlier in this section), but you can also see totem
poles and the carving studio without joining a tour, using a pamphlet
that costs $1.50 (note, however, that interpretive materials are scant
compared to those at Totem Bight).
Sitka
Sitka is our favorite port in Southeast Alaska, with a perfect blend of a
gorgeous location, genuinely fascinating historical attractions, and a
neighborly small-city vibe that hasn’t been touristed out of existence.
(Main reason for that? Sitka isn’t on the Inside Passage, sitting instead
on the Pacific coast of Baranof Island, sheltered by a fringe of out
islands. Big ships have to go all the way around to reach it, and then
bring passengers in by tender — so not too many do.)
History is the big draw here. The rich, powerful, and sophisticated
Kiksadi Tlingit clan called this part of Baranof Island home for centuries,
but in 1799, the Russians arrived, intent on extending their trade empire.
War flared, with the Tlingit initially getting the upper hand, but by 1804
they’d been forced from the town area. From then until the American
purchase of Alaska in 1867, Sitka was the capital of Russia in the New
World.
Cruising into port
Most passengers arrive in Sitka by tender because the harbor is too
small to accommodate large ships. Tenders drop you right in the down-
town area, where small ships can also dock. Maps are available at the
volunteer-staffed visitor information desk at Harrigan Centennial Hall,
which also houses the Isabel Miller Museum and the auditorium where
the New Archangel Dancers perform. The other docking facility is at the
nearby O’Connell Bridge, where you can pick up maps from a volunteer
at the information kiosk (mornings only). Map boards are located near
both docking facilities. You can take a free shuttle bus around town,
though the downtown area begins right at the water.
Scoring the best excursions
Sitka Historical Tour: On this bus tour, you visit the city’s main histori-
cal attractions, including St. Michael’s Cathedral, the Russian Cemetery,
Castle Hill, and Sitka’s National Historic Park with its totem poles and
forest trails. The tour is often combined with a performance by the New
Archangel Dancers and/or a visit to the Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation
Center (3 hours; $40–$50).
Sea Otter and Wildlife Quest: For a chance to spot wildlife ranging from
otters to bears, visit Salisbury Sound by jet boat, with a naturalist along

who explains the area’s marine ecosystem and points out critters along
the way (3 hours; $105).
Sport-Fishing: An experienced captain guides your fully equipped boat to
a good spot for halibut and salmon; the rest is up to you. Your catch can
be frozen or smoked and shipped to your home, if you wish (4 hours; $179
plus $10 for a fishing license and another $10 for a king-salmon tag).
Exploring on your own
Sitka is easy to explore on your own. Maps are available at the Centennial
Hall (see “Cruising into port” above).
Within walking distance: You can’t miss St. Michael’s Cathedral, sit-
ting right in the center of town and adorned with a striking onion-shaped
dome. Though originally built in the 1840s by Russian bishop Innocent
Veniaminov, the current structure is actually an exact replica, the first
church having burned to the ground in 1966. Sitkans saved the icons,
paintings, and other treasures, though, which you can see after you drop
$2 in the collection box.

Bishop Innocent’s 1842 home, called (duh) the Russian Bishop’s House
(% 907-747-6281), is located a few blocks east at Lincoln and Monastery
Streets. A fascinating place, it’s owned and operated by the National Park
Service, with ranger-led tours of the upstairs living quarters and a self-
guided museum downstairs. Bishop Innocent was one impressive dude,
an expert in architecture, carpentry (he built some of the furniture on
display), ethnography, clock-making, and linguistics. Admission costs $4.
A little farther down Lincoln, on the grounds of Sheldon Jackson College,
the Sheldon Jackson Museum (% 907-747-8981; www.museums.state.
ak.us) contains a fine collection of Native artifacts, from the Tlingit,
Aleut, Athabascan, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples, as well as the Native
peoples of the Arctic. Admission is $4.
Continue down Lincoln till you come to the Sitka National Historical
Park (% 907-747-6281; www.nps.gov/sitk). This is where, in 1804, the
Tlingit made their stand against Russia, holding off imperial gunboats
and Aleut mercenaries for six days before finally melting away one night
after taking heavy losses. Today it’s a National Historic Park, with histor-
ical and cultural exhibits indoors at the visitor center and a rain forest
trail that winds along the coast of the 113-acre park, passing an amazing
collection of towering totem poles. Admission is $4.
Back downtown, Castle Hill (up the stairs near the intersection of
Lincoln and Katlian Streets) was where the first U.S. flag was raised on
Alaska soil, after the U.S. and Russia held a transfer ceremony here in
1867. You get a great panoramic view of town from the top. Across the
street, next to the Sitka Pioneers retirement home, the Sheetka’Kwaan
Naa Kahidi Building (200 Katlian St.; % 888-270-8687; www.sitka
tribal.com) is a modern version of a traditional Tlingit tribal house,
hosting regular performances of traditional Tlingit dance. Show times
are posted here and at the Centennial Hall, where another troupe, the
New Archangel Dancers, performs traditional Russian and Ukrainian
dance, with an all-woman company. Admission is $7.
Beyond walking distance (just about): At the Alaska Raptor Center
(1101 Sawmill Creek Blvd.; % 907-747-8662; www.alaskaraptor.org),
visitors can observe owls, hawks, and bald eagles from just a few feet
away. The center was opened in 1980 to treat sick or injured birds of prey
(primarily eagles), and to provide an educational experience for visitors.
Birds that cannot be returned to the wild are sent to zoos or housed here
permanently. Admission is $12 for adults, $6 for kids under 12.
Skagway
Skagway was once a rootin’ tootin’, six-gun-shootin’ wild west town
where thousands of wanna-be prospectors played cards, slugged booze,
spit tobacco juice, and generally wreaked havoc before heading up the
Chilkoot Trail or the White Pass toward the Yukon, where they’d either
(a) strike it rich, (b) strike out, or (c) give up and head back before ever
getting to their destination.

The boom eventually went bust, as booms do, but the people who
remained had the good sense to recognize the historic value of their
town rather than knocking it all down to “modernize.” Today the whole
downtown is run by the National Park Service as a historic district, but
don’t expect a pristine museum. Instead, most of those historic build-
ings house shops that sell hokey T-shirts, souvenirs, and even (eek)
Starbucks coffee. It’s the Gold Rush all over again, but this time the
gold’s in your wallet, and they want it bad.
If you’re like us, you’ll make a quick pass through a few of the tourist
shops and then concentrate on the really worthwhile attractions, of
which there are several.
Cruising into port
The cruise piers lie at the foot of Broadway or off Congress or Terminal
Way. Though the docks are in sight of downtown, it’s about a 20-minute
walk, so take one of the frequent shuttle buses if you don’t feel like hoof-
ing it.
Scoring the best excursions
White Pass and Yukon Route Railway: From the dock, ride this famous
narrow-gauge railway — complete with vintage parlor cars — past parts
of the old prospectors’ trail and stunning waterfalls to the White Pass
Summit, which marks the U.S./Canadian border. Now the caveat: Don’t
bother going on an overcast day — you won’t see anything. For that
reason, you may want to try getting tickets when you get to town rather
than booking the tour. Schedule info is available at www.wpyr.com (31⁄2
hours; $97).
Dyea Ghost Town Bicycle Tour: Dyea, about 9 miles west, was estab-
lished around the same time as Skagway but was abandoned completely

after the Gold Rush. On this tour, you go partway by van before gearing
up for a 6-mile ride through the remains of the town, past coastal tidal
flats and wildflower fields (3 hours; $80).
Sled Dog Musher’s Camp: An introduction to the sled-dog life, with
a tour of a musher’s camp, a 20-minute ride through the forest on a
wheeled sled, and best of all, a chance to cuddle (awwwww!) husky
pups (23⁄4 hours; $109).
Klondike Bicycle Tour: After vanning it to the White Pass summit, you
ride down the Klondike Highway, 15 miles from peak to sea, pausing
along the way for photos (21⁄2 hours; $80).
Skagway by Streetcar: This tour makes for an entertaining theater expe-
rience. Guides in period costume (and loads of theatricality) drive you
around town, telling stories about the good old days and showing you
the highlights both inside and just outside town, including the old Gold
Rush Cemetery. Sore feet and a high tolerance for hokum? Sign here (2
hours; $36–$40).
Exploring on your own
You can take a shuttle bus or walk pretty easily to downtown. You can
find everything on the main street, Broadway, or on branches just off it.
Walking maps describing the historic buildings and trail maps of the
surrounding area (with hikes from 1–10 miles, departing from trailheads
right in town) are available at the Arctic Brotherhood Hall on Broadway
(between 2nd and 3rd) and at the National Historic Park Visitor Center
(www.nps.gov/klgo), located next to the White Pass & Yukon Route
railroad depot, just off the corner of 2nd and Broadway.
Within walking distance: Although you can certainly explore any of
the historic downtown buildings on your own, you may want to take one
of the short tours from the Historic Park Visitor Center (see above).
Offered several times a day, these tours show you around the White
Pass & Yukon Railway Depot; Soapy’s Parlor, a preserved saloon once
owned by notorious Gold Rush shyster and all-around badman Soapy
Smith; the Moore Cabin, Skagway’s original homestead; and the Mascot
Saloon, a museum that simulates a 19th-century tavern.
Across Broadway from the visitor center, the Arctic Brotherhood Hall
(see above) is one of the more photographed buildings in Southeast
Alaska, its facade covered in thousands of pieces of driftwood. On the
same block, the Red Onion Saloon (% 907-983-2222) was originally a
dance hall and honky-tonk. Today, bartenders still serve drinks over the
same mahogany bar they used a century ago and waitresses dress in
busty period dance-hall outfits. Upstairs was once a bordello, and now
offers a really interesting tour for $5, led by yet more young women in
flouncy outfits. The rooms have been re-created to look as they did in
the 1890s.
Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 387

At the other end of town, the Skagway Museum (at Seventh Avenue and
Spring Street; % 907-983-2420) is a very professional display offering a
look at Skagway’s history through artifacts, photographs, and historical
records. Admission is $2. Back on Broadway, at the Eagles Hall, the old-
timey Days of ’98 Show has been playing since 1927, featuring 1890s-
style dancing girls, ragtime music, a recitation of Robert Service poetry,
and a reenactment of the famous shootout between bad guy Soapy
Smith and good guy Frank Reid. The show is almost always offered as
part of a shore excursion, but you can buy tickets at the door for $14.
Two shows are scheduled during the day (10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.)
while ships are in port.
If you’re up for a little walk, walk down Seventh then about a mile up
State Street to the old Gold Rush Cemetery, where Smith and Reid are
both buried — Reid within the cemetery, Smith just outside.
Victoria, British Columbia
Alaskan cruises that start in San Francisco or Seattle frequently call at
Victoria, the capital of British Columbia. Located on Vancouver Island,
this lovely little city boasts gorgeous Victorian architecture, lovely gar-
dens, and an atmosphere that’s almost more British than Britain, albeit
with more evergreens.
The Canadian dollar (C$1.25 = US$1; C$1 = US80¢) is Canada’s official
currency. We quote all prices in this section in U.S. dollars.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at the Ogden Point cruise ship terminal on Juan
De Fuca Strait, about a mile southwest of the Inner Harbour and the
Downtown/Old Town area, where most attractions are located.
Scoring the best excursions
City Tour and Butchart Gardens: After a quick bus tour of the city
sights, a short ride out to the Saanich Peninsula takes you to the world-
renowned 130-acre Butchart Gardens (see “Exploring on your own,”
below) (4 hours; $60–$65).
City Tour with High Tea and Craigdarroch Castle: After a bus tour of
the major sights, this tour heads out to Craigdarroch Castle, an 1880s
mansion built by a Scottish coal baron. The tour concludes with high tea
at the Fairmont Empress Hotel (4 hours; $79).
Victoria Pub Crawl: Visit three of the city’s finest pubs and sample its
best local brews (31⁄2 hours; $59).
Orca- and Wildlife-Watching Adventure: Sail by catamaran off southern
Vancouver Island for probable sightings of killer whales, seals, and por-
poises (31⁄2 hours; $99).

Chapter 16: Doing Alaska in Style 389
Exploring on your own
Shuttles are available from Ogden Point to the Inner Harbor, the center
of Victoria. You can find walking maps right on the waterfront at the
Visitors Information Center (812 Wharf St.).
Within walking distance: For afternoon tea, including perfect scones
and genuine clotted cream (at a stiff $34 a head), visit the elegant
Fairmont Empress Hotel (721 Government St.; % 250-384-8111; www.
fairmont.com/empress), dating to 1908. Many shore excursions
include tea here, but if you plan to go on your own, call two weeks
before your cruise for reservations and be sure to follow the dress code:
no sleeveless shirts, tank tops, short-shorts, or cut-offs.
Just to the east sits the Royal British Columbia Museum (675 Belleville
St.; % 888-447-7977; http://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca), offering exhibits
highlighting British Columbia’s natural history, First People’s history, and
Victoria’s recent past. Admission is $8. Adjacent is Thunderbird Park,

displaying totem poles and a ceremonial house. Helmecken House
(10 Elliot St.), next to the park, was once the home of a pioneer doctor’s
home, and now displays some pioneering medical devices that remind
you how painful life on the frontier could be.
Beyond walking distance: Craigdarroch Castle (1050 Joan Crescent;
% 250-592-5323; www.craigdarrochcastle.com) was built in the
1880s as the home of millionaire Scottish coal magnate Robert Dunsmuir.
Four stories high and containing 39 rooms, it’s topped with stone turrets
and furnished in opulent Victoria splendor. Admission is $7.50. City bus
routes 11 and 14 drop you off at the foot of Joan Crescent, a two-minute
walk to the castle’s doorstep, or you can get there by taxi in less than
ten minutes.
For a more floral take on Victoria, visit the 130-acre Butchart Gardens
(800 Benevenuto Ave., in Brentwood Bay; % 250-652-5256; www.
butchartgardens.com), about 13 miles north of downtown Victoria on
the Saanich Peninsula. Started as a beautification project by the wife of a
quarry owner, it eventually became the couple’s passion, and today fea-
tures English, Italian, and Japanese gardens, water gardens, and rose gar-
dens. Admission is $16. You can catch a public bus from downtown, or a
cab, or visit as part of a shore excursion.

Chapter 17
Meandering in the
Mediterranean
In This Chapter
 Finding the best attractions and shopping in each port
 Exploring the best shore excursions
T
he Mediterranean is a hot, hot, hot cruise destination these days.
Lines sent lots of ships there for the summer 2005 season, and at
press time things looked equally busy for 2006.
A Mediterranean cruise vacation appeals to people who want more than
fun in the sun. Sure, you find glistening beaches with semi-nude bodies
(in the French Riviera anyway) and such diversions as shopping and
casinos (as in Monte Carlo). But in the Med, you also find incredible
scenery, medieval ramparts, archaeological finds, and some of the best
museums in the world. History lurks around every corner, and ancient
sites such as Ephesus in Turkey can leave you drop-jawed. Cultural and
culinary opportunities also abound; a lunch or dinner ashore is a must.
The Mediterranean ports are close together, too, so you can generally
visit several European countries — typically Spain, France, and Italy on a
western itinerary, and Greece, Turkey, and sometimes Italy on an eastern
itinerary.
Unlike Alaskan and Caribbean cruises — which, despite the rise of
many alternative options, still tend to sail round-trip from a few major
homeports — Mediterranean and other European cruises are mostly
open-jawed: sailing from any of a dozen different port cities and ending
in another. The most popular ports of embarkation and debarkation in
the Mediterranean include most of those covered later in this chapter,
plus Genoa, Italy, and Dover and Southampton, UK.
Another big draw of a Europe cruise is the price. With the euro sky high
these days, booking a cruise and pre-paying in U.S. dollars is a great
hedge against currency fluctuations. Plus, with meals and entertainment
included in the cruise fare, there’s no question you can spend less for a
Europe vacation at sea than one on land.

When you plan a Mediterranean cruise, keep up on current events and
consult with your travel agent as to possible itinerary changes in the
event a volatile geopolitical situation heats up.
Hitting the Town
There’s nothing like cruising into a European port; many are right in the
old historic part of town. Leaning against the ship’s railing, you’ll have
front row seats for the dramatic approach. Coming into Istanbul, for
example, you’ll be treated to views of the ancient minarets and domes
of the shimmering Blue Mosque, the 1,500-year-old St. Sophia cathedral,
and the outrageously ornate Topaki Palace. Entering Malta’s Grand
Harbour at a snail’s pace affords breathtaking views of the honey-
colored stone fortifications that rise up like ornate sand castles from
the shoreline. It sure beats the view from a train!
Once you arrive, you’ll want to do some exploring. You can either ven-
ture off on your own, which sometimes is the best way to handle your
day, or sign up for your ship’s organized tours.
Shore excursions at Mediterranean ports usually focus on educating you
about the region and involve buses with English-speaking guides. As in
the Caribbean and Alaska, local contractors, rather than the cruise lines,
conduct the tours. Some of the more upscale and educational lines have
expert lecturers that accompany shore excursions. And some lines offer
tours in limos and minivans rather than in big buses.
In some countries, including Greece and Turkey, the guides must be
licensed and very knowledgeable about their subject matter. Elsewhere,
we have been generally impressed with the quality of the tours offered,
with a few notable exceptions. We had a guide from Monaco, for exam-
ple, who tried to entertain us on our way to St-Paul-de-Vence with a com-
bination of inane commentary on the scenery (“Oh, look at the sea, isn’t
it blue?”) and gossip about Monaco’s royal family.
The prices we list for shore excursions are for 2005 and may go up
slightly in 2006. We convert admission fees to U.S. dollars.
If touring on your own, in some ports you can walk to the best sights
from the docks, but in others the major attractions are some distance
away. In most ports, renting a car is both a hassle and expensive, so
you’re better off hiring a car and driver. By getting together a small
group, you can split the price of the cab and save money. Your ship’s
tour office can usually offer tips about taxis. In some ports, public trans-
portation, such as buses, subways, and trains, is also an option.
At many famed sites, such as Pompeii, you can rent audio tour headsets,
so you can tour on your own and still learn something.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
392

For touring, keep in mind that some churches, mosques, and other reli-
gious sites are more conservative than others, so both men and women
should wear long pants or skirts (shorts and short skirts are a no-no)
and avoid wearing sleeveless shirts.
Boarding Ship in Europe
As with cruise ship departures in the Caribbean, Alaska, and elsewhere,
ships typically start boarding passengers in the early afternoon on the
first day and then depart in the early evening. If you fly into the port of
embarkation that day, however, the ship may allow you to board earlier —
the cruise lines know people are generally exhausted after an overseas
flight.
Minding Your Money
If you want to buy something at the ports in the Mediterranean, you
have to exchange your dollars for local currency (on the ship, at a bank,
or at a currency exchange), get money from a local ATM, or use your
charge card. In most cases in the Mediterranean, the official currency is
now the euro (Turkey is the exception). Trust us, this new inter-Europe
currency makes buying a whole lot easier, especially for cruise travelers,
because you don’t have to keep switching currency for each country
you visit. At press time, the euro exchange rate was US$1 = .77€ or 1€ =
US$1.30. Turkey has the Turkish new lira; the exchange at press time
was US$1 = 1.35 lira or 1 lira = US74¢. However, because exchange rates
fluctuate, you should check an international newspaper or an online cur-
rency converter to get the most up-to-date rates. Try the handy currency
calculator at www.bloomberg.com.
The French Riviera
Ahhh, what conjures up a more romantic locale? The French Riviera is
the place of dreams, the Côte d’Azur (meaning the part of the Riviera in
France), where beautiful mountains and a very blue sea combine with
yachts and high culture to create a playground for the rich and famous
(and for us mortal folk, too). Artists once drawn to the landscape
included Matisse, Cocteau, Picasso, Leger, Renoir, and Bonnard, and
their legacy remains in a host of wonderful museums. Medieval cities
are within easy reach, as are numerous shopping opportunities. Cannes,
Monte Carlo, Nice, St-Tropez, and Villefranche are all strung along the
Riviera, and are so close together geographically that they offer nearly
the same shore excursions.
Cannes is a bustling commercial center, famous for the international
Cannes Film Festival held there every year in mid-May. The city offers

easily accessible beaches and plenty of shopping prospects. The 370-
acre municipality of Monaco has symbolized glamour for centuries —
the 1956 marriage of Prince Rainier and American actress Grace Kelly
after their meeting at the Cannes film festival enhanced that renown.
Nice is nice. It really is. What was once a Victorian playground for the
aristocracy is now a big middle-class city with much to offer tourists,
including great art museums and shopping opportunities. Actress
Brigitte Bardot made St-Tropez famous, and fun-in-the-sun still thrives
in this artist colony. Although residents and visitors proudly uphold
its reputation for hedonism (topless and even bottomless sunbathers
bask at beaches outside of town), you can find some quaint mixed in.
Villefranche is a lovely little port town that houses artists and is home
to the U.S. Sixth Fleet. The quiet mood definitely changes when the
fleet’s in town.
Cruising into port
Only the smallest ships can dock at piers in these towns — for example,
the 110-passenger SeaDream yachts and 208-passenger Seabourn ships
can dock in Cannes, Monte Carlo, and Nice, and the Silversea ships can
dock in Nice and Monte Carlo — otherwise you’ll anchor offshore and
tender in. The plus side is that the views of the Riviera are awesome
from the ships’ anchorages, which are never that far offshore, making for
speedy jaunts into town. Many ships, including the largest ones, anchor
offshore from Villefranche, and once on land, passengers are free to
explore the coast. The ship and/or tender piers are all located right in
town at each of the French Riviera ports, so you can walk right into the
thick of things. If you don’t sign up for a tour, you can take a taxi (expen-
sive) if you want to go to another spot on the Riviera, or hop on one of
the trains that run along the coastline (cheap and fun). Monte Carlo, for
example, is just about a 20-minute ride from Villefranche.
Scoring the best excursions
The best way to explore the French Riviera ports is on your own. You
needn’t book an excursion unless you have problems with walking or
you want to travel to a port other than the one your ship visits. But
some outlying areas are worth exploring by tour, including the following:
St-Paul-de-Vence: This walled medieval city offers art galleries and shops,
cobblestone streets, cafes, and gorgeous country views, as well as a
world-renowned modern art museum, Fondation Maeght (4 hours; $80).
Medieval Eze: The French medieval town of Eze literally clings to the
rocks above the sea. A guided walk takes you on narrow streets past
lovely restored houses with stunning ocean views. Tours also allot some
time for you to check out boutiques and artists’ studios (3–4 hours;
$45–$68).

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 397

Exploring on your own
Taxis are available at all the piers, but they are expensive. (You may
want to double up with other passengers if you plan to go any long dis-
tance.) You can walk from all the ports to many of the main local attrac-
tions. You can also take the great train service between cities on the
Côte d’Azur, as well as the local bus service. In St-Tropez, you can rent
bikes (for about $10 an hour) to get to the more daring beaches; the
biggest bicycle outfitter is Louis Mas at 5 rue Josef-Quaranta.
Cannes, France
Within walking distance: Those glamorous grand hotels you see on 
television during the annual Cannes Film Festival are located on the
seafront, close to the ship pier. Also within walking distance of the pier
are free public beaches, including Plage du Midi, where exhibitionism
and voyeurism are likely both in full view, and private beach areas where
you pay a fee (about $18 or more) that includes the rental of a beach
mattress and sun umbrella. You can shop near the pier at world-famous
boutiques, including major Paris brands such as Saint Laurent, Rykiel,
and Hermès, which you can find on La Croisette, the main drag facing
the sea. More affordable, but still quite fashionable, shopping is a few
blocks inland on rue d’Antibes.
Beyond walking distance: Across the bay from Cannes are the Lérins
Islands, including Ile Ste-Marguerite, where the unlucky man immortal-
ized in The Man in the Iron Mask was imprisoned. You can visit his cell.
The island also boasts a maritime museum and nice family-run restau-
rants. The trip is about 15 minutes and the ferries depart every half-
hour. The round-trip fare is $10.
Monte Carlo, Monaco
Within walking distance: There’s nothing like a walk through Monte
Carlo; you really do see playboys in sports cars zipping around the
streets (when they’re not hanging out in their million-dollar yachts
moored in the harbor). They obviously don’t have day jobs. When
exploring this city, you walk up some steep hills or use the municipal-
ity’s rather bizarre system of public elevators to be lifted from, say, the
harbor to the casino area. Keep in mind that laws prohibit you from
walking around town in swimsuits, bare-chested, or barefoot.
The Monte Carlo Casino at Place du Casino lets you put on your finery
and play James Bond. Built in 1878, the casino is wonderfully ornate but
surprisingly small. Admission is $9 to $18.50, depending on where in the
casino you go, and you must show your passport. The casino admits no
one under 18. At night, men must wear a jacket and tie. To get a whiff of
the Monte Carlo lifestyle, check out the gazillion-dollar cars parked out-
side the casino. The more casual, American-style Salle Américaine
casino (where admission is free) is next door.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
398

Beyond walking distance: You can walk from the harbor to the city’s his-
toric area, but because the uphill hike is only for the vigorous (although
the elevators help), we put it in this section. Try taking a cab uphill, and
then take a walk back down.
The Place du Palais is the Italianate home of the Grimaldis, the royal
family of Monaco. Tours of Les Grands Appartements du Palais include
the throne room and art collection and a combined admission to a sepa-
rate museum with many Napoleonic items. Admission is $8.25 for adults,
$5 for children 8 to 14, and free for children under 7. At 11:55 a.m., a ten-
minute changing-of-the-guard ceremony takes place outside.
The Oceanographic Museum, on avenue St-Martin, fascinates visitors
with over 90 fish tanks that exhibit many species new to North Americans.
Admission is $14 for adults, $9 for children 6 to 18, and free for children 5
and under.
Nice, France
Within walking distance: Don your designer sandals and latest bag
(never, never wear your white sneakers here . . . way too gauche in these
parts), and stroll from the harbor to old town, where colorful houses
line narrow streets, and to the Flower Market area, full of outdoor cafes
and great places for people-watching. (On Mondays, you can browse a
wonderful antiques market here.) A few blocks inland, you find plenty
of shopping opportunities for high fashion, Provencal wares, and more,
especially on rue Masséna, place Magenta, and rue Paradis. You may
also find it worth a trek uphill (you can use the elevator option here,
too) to the old graveyard of Nice in Le Château Park, where both great
views and lavishly sculpted monuments delight you at the top (the park
is also home to a Naval museum).
Also within walking distance of the ship pier is promenade des Anglais,
a wide boulevard stretching several miles on the bay, with beaches
(where teeny bikinis rule), cafes, and historic buildings, including
Victorian hotels.
Beyond walking distance: Nice boasts so many great museums that
you can hardly go wrong in choosing one. But a must-see for modern
art fans is Musée Matisse, located in a lovely setting in Cimiez on a hill
above Nice. Matisse and his heirs donated all the works in the museum,
which include Nude in an Armchair with a Green Plant and other famous
paintings along with practice sketches, designs, and items from the
artist’s own collection and home. Admission is $5.25 for adults and $4
for children. About a 15-minute walk away, also in Cimiez, the Musée
National Message Biblique Marc-Chagall features a collection donated
by Chagall and his wife that includes oils, gouaches, drawings, pastels,
lithographs, and sculptures, as well as a mosaic and stained-glass win-
dows. A brochure is available in English to help you understand the bib-
lical themes the artworks depict. Admission is $6.35 for adults, $4.60 for
Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 399

students and seniors, and free for children (rates may be higher for spe-
cial exhibitions).
St-Tropez, France
Within walking distance: Family beaches, including Plage de la
Bouillabaisse and Plage des Graniers, are close to the center of town.
You can find good shopping at a wealth of antiques and art galleries in
the city’s old town. Celebrities visit here often, so keep your eyes peeled:
You may bump into Oprah Winfrey or even Brad and Angelina (with
People magazine photographers on their tails, of course). L’Annonciade
Musée St-Tropez, at Place Georges-Grammont, is an art museum located
in a former chapel with a renowned modern art collection. Admission is
$6.75 for adults and $4.50 for children.
Beyond walking distance: The most daring beaches — Plage des
Salins, Plage de Pampellone, and Plage de Tahiti — are located a few
miles from town.
Villefranche, France
Within walking distance: This little town provides a nice setting for a
walk, if you don’t head into Nice (4 miles away) or Monte Carlo (about
10 miles away). Jean Cocteau left his legacy here in the form of frescoes
on the 14th-century walls of the Romanesque Chapelle St-Pierre on Quai
de al Douane/rue des Mariniéres. Admission is $3.50; closed Mondays.
Beyond walking distance: Head to nearby Nice, about 4 miles away.
Check out the previous section on Nice for info on the sites.
Greece
Ancient sites and architectural treasures join forces with the sun,
scenery, and food to make Greece one of the best vacation spots on
Earth. Be ready for a feast for the mind and the senses, a place that is
exotic but at the same time friendly and familiar, where something
always reminds you of the past.
Athens
This fabled metropolis, home of the original and the 2004 Olympic Games,
intersperses ancient monuments, tavernas, and neoclassical buildings
with high rises, fast-food outlets, and souvenir shops, especially at
the Pláka, the oldest continuously inhabited section of the city. The
Parthenon and the treasures on display at the National Archaeological
Museum best reflect the image most of us have of ancient Greece. But in
reality, modern Athens is crowded, teems with taxis and cars, and is a
hard place to get around. The city is also polluted and very hot during the
summer. An organized tour is a good bet here. If you do spend the day on
your own, check out the Acropolis, have lunch in the Pláka, and accept
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
400

that you don’t have time to see everything, so pick the places most impor-
tant to you.
Cruising into port
Ships dock in Piraeus, located about 7 miles southwest of Athens, but
the trip may seem much longer due to traffic. You can take a metro train
or taxi into the city or hop the bus service that most cruise lines offer
for a fee. We recommend the train, which you can walk to from the pier
and ride for about $1.
Scoring the best excursions
Half-Day Athens City Tour: Includes a guided tour of the Acropolis; a
drive past other Athens highlights, including Constitution Square, the
Parliament, the Temple of Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, and Olympic Stadium;
plus time for souvenir shopping (4 hours; $56).
Full-day Athens Tours: Full-day tours also include a visit to the National
Archaeological Museum, time to shop in the Pláka, and lunch (7–9 hours;
$65–$110).
Exploring on your own
If you want to take a taxi, the average meter fare from Piraeus to Syntagma
Square in Athens should be around $10, but many drivers may quote a flat
rate as high as $25. Try bargaining or find another taxi driver willing to
turn on the meter.
Greek taxi drivers don’t always accept you as a fare. They usually ask
where you want to go and are free to decline if they don’t want to go
your way; consequently, allow a fair amount of time to find a cab. Also, a
driver may stop and pick up two or three different parties to fill the cab.
If this happens, you’re responsible only for your leg of the journey. Also,
check for a meter and for your driver’s photo ID (an increasing number
of gypsy cabs have found their way into the city).
Within walking distance: Piraeus is a gritty port city without the kind
of ancient attractions that you find in Athens. Ship aficionados may
enjoy a walk around the huge dock area, but everyone else should head
into Athens.
In the summer, start out as early as possible in the morning, when the
sun isn’t at its strongest and the crowds aren’t as overwhelming.
Beyond walking distance: For many centuries, the Acropolis was the
religious center of Athens. At various periods, it served as the seat of a
king and the “home” of gods and goddesses. Because it rests on a hilltop,
you can glimpse it from many parts of the city. The most striking struc-
tures are the Parthenon (the most recognized Greek monument; a temple
dedicated to Athena), the Propylaea (the gateway to the Acropolis), the

Temple of Athena Nike (built in the fifth century B.C. and restored in
the 1930s), and the Erechtheion (the main temple, divided into two 
sections — one devoted to Athena and the other to Poseidon). You can’t
enter the Parthenon for preservation and restoration reasons. Admission
to the Acropolis complex is $14 for adults, $7.50 for students, and free for
kids under age 18 (includes same-day admission to the Acropolis Museum
and the National Archeological Museum); free on Sundays.
The National Archeological Museum has one of the richest collections of
ancient Greek art in the world and was renovated for the 2004 Olympics.
Admission is $8.75 for adults, $5.25 for students, and free for kids under
age 18.
Mykonos
Think picture-postcard perfect. Hora, Mykonos’s main town, dazzles with
white-washed homes, their doors and window frames painted brightly,
and a harbor lined with fishing boats. Pelicans, the mascots of Mykonos,
greet you at the pier, and as you explore the cobblestone streets you
encounter windmills, outdoor cafes, and small churches with blue domes,
all within easy walking distance of the pier. It’s a very quaint atmosphere,
despite the large numbers of sun-seekers, the town’s well-deserved party
reputation (especially in July and Aug), and the inevitable souvenir shops.
Unlike other Greek islands that cruise ships visit, Mykonos has no
ancient ruins. Passengers starving for sacred sites of note can catch a
shore excursion to nearby Delos, the birthplace of Apollo.
Mykonos is the best place for diving in the Aegean, especially in
September. The most well-established diving center is at Psarou Beach
(% and fax 30-22890-24-808).
Cruising into port
Your ship’s tender delivers you to the main harbor area along the
Esplanade in Hora right in the center of things.
Scoring the best excursions
Delos Apollo Sanctuary: Travel by small boat from Mykonos harbor to
Delos for a two-hour guided walking tour of this tiny island that once
served as the religious and commercial hub of the Aegean Sea. Now the
sanctuary is home only to ancient ruins and their caretakers. Also visit
the Archaeological Museum (4 hours; $60).
Exploring on your own
The central bus station is located off the left of the harbor, and the bus
service is quite good, heading to all the beaches. Still, the best way to
get around town is to walk. Or, you can choose from two types of taxis.
The standard cab, which you can find at Taxi (Mavro) Square, can take
you outside of town. A notice board at the square displays rates. Smaller

scooter taxis with a cart for passengers also zip through the narrow
streets of Hora — you find them at the pier.
Within walking distance: Hora is the main attraction here. The best
activity is to simply wander. You can browse in plenty of art galleries and
souvenir shops (some may say too many), and this is a great place to sit
at a cafe and people-watch. You can also stop by the Archaeological
Museum near the harbor to view finds from Delos. Admission is $3.25
for adults, $1.25 for students, and free for those under 18 and for all on

Check out the local cuisine at Edem restaurant in Hora (follow the sign-
posts off Matoyanni Street, near the Panahrandou church; % 0289-
22-855). The food is tasty and the service is great.
Beyond walking distance: About 4 miles east of Hora lies Mykonos’s
second town, Ano Mera, which has a more traditional ambience and
some religious sites of note. The Monastery of Panayia Tourliani dates
to 1580 and has a handsomely carved steeple, as well as a small religious
museum inside. You can also visit the 12th-century Monastery of
Paleokastro nearby.
Rhodes
Imagine that the Colossus of Rhodes, the giant bronze statue of sun god
Helios, towered over the very same harbor that now welcomes cruise
ships. Wow. Rich in history, Rhodes is blessed with beautiful beaches,
mountain villages, and fertile plains. The island’s most famous inhabi-
tants were the Knights of St. John, who came in 1291 after fleeing
Jerusalem. They reigned for more than two centuries, and their treas-
ures remain within the medieval walls of the old town of Rhodes (the
city shares its name with the island). Lindos, a picturesque village about
50 minutes from Rhodes city, boasts the Acropolis at Lindos, which
rises about 400 feet above a beautiful bay (though the beauty can be
somewhat diminished on days the place gets terribly crowded).
Cruising into port
Ships dock at the commercial harbor, which is within walking distance of
Rhodes’s old section. The new town is also within walking distance, but
the old town offers more sights of interest.
Scoring the best excursions
Rhodes and Lindos: Travel by bus through the scenic countryside to
Lindos, a medieval walled city with a history that dates to ancient times.
Walk or take a donkey up to the ancient Acropolis to see ruins and great
views (you pass souvenir shops on the way). The trip may include a
walking tour of old town Rhodes; a stop at a workshop selling Rhodian
ceramics; and/or a visit to the ruins of ancient Rhodes, the Temple of
Apollo, and Diagoras Stadium (4–41⁄2 hours; $50–$65).
Exploring on your own
The best way to explore both the old and new sections of Rhodes is on
foot. If you want to see other parts of the island, you can find taxis at the
end of the pier. Negotiate fares with taxi drivers for sightseeing. Public
buses are also available.
Within walking distance: The old town of Rhodes is the oldest
medieval town in Europe and offers plenty of beauty. Be forewarned,
though: You can easily get lost in the maze of streets (few of which have
names). The 15th-century Hospital of the Knights, now home of the

Archaeological Museum, features fine works from the Mycenaean and
Roman eras. Admission is $12 for adults, $6.75 for students, and free for
kids under 18 (this price also includes admission into three other local
museums). Stroll the cobblestone Street of the Knights (Ippoton on the
maps) to see medieval inns that served as clubs and meeting places for
the multinational Knights of St. John; their facades mirror the architec-
ture of the various countries the knights came from.

The famous Colossus of Rhodes, a 100-foot-tall bronze statue of the sun
god Helios, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,
was erected somewhere on Mandraki Harbor — legend says that it
straddled the harbor. Nothing remains of the statue today.
You can find plenty of places to stop for a bite in old town and new town;
seafood restaurants are your best bet. One of the best is Alexis Taverna
(Odos Sokratous 18, in old town; % 0241-29-347), where the likes of
Winston Churchill and Jackie O once dined. Dinners run about $60 per
person, and reservations are recommended.
Beyond walking distance: Rhodes is also known for its great beaches,
many of which lie on the east coast. Faliaraki, about 20 minutes from
Rhodes, is one of the most popular.
If you want to visit Lindos, you should book a shore excursion (Lindos is
50 minutes away from Rhodes, and the excursion guarantees that you
get back in time), though be prepared for mucho crowds if you’re there
in July or August.
Santoríni
Whitewashed homes, black-pebble beaches, rich vineyards, and ancient
ruins dot one of the most breathtaking islands in the world: Santoríni.
Approaching its volcanic cliffs by sea is a dramatic experience. Ships
enter the caldera, a central crater formed when a volcano erupted in
1500 B.C. Ash fell on the remaining land, burying the ancient city of
Akrotiri — an event that some believe may have sparked the legend of
Atlantis.
Fira, the capital, perches about 1,000 feet above sea level. Along its
winding streets, you find shops, cafes, and art galleries. Ia, about 10 to
15 minutes away by cab, is a quiet and picturesque artist colony.
Cruising into port
The ship’s tender takes you to the port of Skala, where you have three
options to reach Fira: donkey, cable car, or foot.
Scoring the best excursions
Akrotiri Excavations and Fira Town: This tour takes you to Akrotiri, an
excavation site that dates back to the second millennium B.C. After the
tour, you have time to explore Fira and make your own way back to the
ship (3 hours; $60–$70).
Village of Oia and Winery: Walk on the picturesque narrow cobblestone
streets of the small village of Oia, perched on a cliff. Stop at a local winery
in a nearby village for a tasting. The tour ends in Fira (4 hours; $60).

Exploring on your own
From Skala, the donkey and cable car rides to the top cost about $5 each
way. The walk up the 587 steps is the same route the donkeys take. Word
to the wise: Donkeys are fed at the bottom of the hill, so they tend to run
down whether carrying someone or not. They also smell. Donkey rides
take about 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic and availability. Cable
cars run every 20 minutes; walking takes about 30 minutes (depending
on the individual).
You can easily explore the town of Fira on foot, and you can take taxis (not
cheap and not always easy to find) or buses to other parts of the island. If
you hike regularly, you may want to try the 6.2-mile pedestrian path from
Fira to Ia that follows the edge of the caldera and offers stunning views.
Along the way, you pass several churches and climb two substantial hills.
Within walking distance: Fira offers shops and art galleries. If your
ship stays late enough in port, watch the sunset from a cafe for a classic

Greek Isles experience. In addition, Fira has one of the best restaurants
in Greece: Selene, located in the passageway between the Atlantis and
Aressana Hotels (% 22860-22-249). Local produce is the star, with
main courses ranging from $10 to $18; reservations are suggested. (The
restaurant also offers cooking classes that start at 10:30 a.m. and con-
clude with lunch at 2 p.m.)
Beyond walking distance: Ia is quieter than Fira and offers charming
homes and galleries that showcase modern and folk art and traditional
handicrafts. To visit Ancient Akrotiri, located about 5 miles from Fira,
we recommend that you take a shore excursion with a guide to get
expert commentary.
You want to explore the excavation at Akrotiri in the morning because
its enclosing metal shed magnifies the afternoon heat.
Italy
If you ask ten people to name their favorite country in Europe, chances
are eight or nine of them are going to say Italy — a beautiful and diverse
country with an incredible cultural heritage. You can eat great food, talk
to friendly people, shop for the latest fashions, see some of the ancient
world’s most famous ruins (such as the Forum in Rome and the ancient
city of Pompeii), immerse yourself in the Renaissance in Florence, and
be part of living history in Venice.
This is the land of Leonardo (da Vinci, not DiCaprio) and Michelangelo,
of caesars and popes. And whether you feel drawn by the art, incredible
architecture, religious significance, gorgeous scenery, wonderful pasta,
or all of the above, Italy delivers your heart’s desires.
Civitavecchia and Rome
The name Civitavecchia probably has you shaking your head wondering
Civita-who? But Civitavecchia has actually served as the port of Rome
since A.D. 108. Cruise ships shuttle passengers from here to Rome, about
90 minutes away. Rome, of course, is Italy’s largest city, where you find
incomparable sights such as the Vatican and the Forum, as well as other
cultural opportunities, diverse restaurants, and great shopping.
Cruising into port
Ships pull alongside the docks in Civitavecchia, though don’t expect to
be bowled over. You’re not in Rome, remember.
Scoring the best excursions
In addition to the following recommended excursion, most ships offer a
bus transfer, for $55 to $70, allowing you easy transportation to explore
Rome on your own. Some also offer the option of a half-day tour followed
by a half-day on your own for $75 to $92.

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 413

Rome City Tour: This comprehensive excursion includes a visit to the
Colosseum, St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museum, and the Sistine
Chapel. The driver also passes such landmarks as the Roman Forum,
Trajan’s Column, the Arch of Constantine, and the Circus Maximus.
The tour may also include a short walk to see Trevi Fountain and defi-
nitely includes lunch and time to shop for souvenirs (91⁄2–101⁄2 hours;
about $180).
Exploring on your own
From the pier, you can take a 15-minute walk or 5-minute cab ride into
the town of Civitavecchia. Taxis are usually available at the pier, and the
ride to Rome is about 90 minutes. You can also take a train, and the ride
takes about an hour (depending on the time of day, service is hourly or
twice hourly); Heidi’s done this and found it much more pleasant than a
long bus ride.
Within walking distance: We highly recommend taking a shore excur-
sion to Rome or going to Rome on your own because you can’t see much
in Civitavecchia.
Beyond walking distance: In Rome, the Basilica di San Pietro (St.
Peter’s Basilica), the earthly locus of the Roman Catholic Church, is
amazing both inside and out and well worth a visit. The church is mag-
nificent and so is the square on which it stands. Admission is free to
the basilica; getting to the dome costs $4 by stairs, $5 by elevator; and
guided tours of St. Peter’s Tomb (children under 15 aren’t admitted) are
about $10. During the summer, be prepared for lines.
Women visiting the Vatican must wear pants or skirts that cover their
knees. Men cannot wear shorts. No one is allowed to wear sleeveless tops.
American priests studying in Rome offer excellent, free tours of the
Basilica. The tours last about two hours and are highly informative
about the architecture and the religious significance of various parts of
the area. Inquire at the Vatican Tourist Office (in the building to the left
when you face the Basilica).
Nearby, the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chapel are where the
Vatican displays its gigantic collection of treasures. The museum is mas-
sive, so you need to choose a route based on four color-coded itiner-
aries, which range from 11⁄2 to 5 hours. All four itineraries culminate in
the Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo labored for four years (1509–12)
to paint the famous ceiling frescoes. Admission is normally $14.50 and
free for everyone the last Sunday of each month (be ready for a crowd).
The best way to view the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling is to bring along 
binoculars.
Rome boasts so many other must-see sights that choosing among them
is hard, but try to catch a glimpse of the Roman Forum, the Colosseum,
and the Pantheon. A must-do stop for many is the Trevi Fountain, a
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why

lavish Baroque creation; according to legend, if you toss in a coin, you’ll
return to Rome (you may have to make your way through crowds to get
close enough to drop your money, however). The famous Spanish Steps
take their name from the Spanish Embassy, which used to be headquar-
tered at the site. The steps are always packed with crowds of people
browsing the carts of the flower and jewelry vendors or just people-
watching. Shoppers also love the neighborhood, so check out the posh
shops on Via Borgognona and Via Condotti. For a less-expensive alter-
native, head to Via Sistina and Via Francesco Crispi.
Venice
As beautiful as you could imagine, this old city of canals and narrow
streets is in a category by itself. Even on a crowded August day, the
place is special, and you can still find a quiet, quaint alleyway to explore,
away from the hordes. Built at the waterline, spectacular Venice rises
straight out of the Gulf of Venice. Everywhere you look in this living
museum you see something artistic or otherwise fascinating, including
amazing numbers of Gothic and Renaissance structures and construc-
tion projects aimed at stopping buildings from sinking into the sea.
Be prepared to get lost exploring the city’s mazelike frenzy of canals,
side streets, and medieval bridges — scratching your head is part of the
fun. But don’t worry; you can’t get too lost because yellow signs every-
where point you to major landmarks such as St. Mark’s Square and the
Rialto Bridge.
Getting out on the Grand Canal, a watery version of a main city boule-
vard, is a must-do, whether you take the touristy route of paying for a
gondola (negotiate up front with the driver and expect to pay through
the nose) or an equally overpriced water taxi. You can also do like the
Venetians: ride a vaporetto (water bus). Any way you go, you pass his-
toric buildings, ornate bridges, and waterfront palaces, and you share
the waterway with ambulance boats, delivery barges, and other vessels
reminding you that the canal is the byway for ordinary life in Venice —
the city has no cars (or streets wide enough to drive on).
Venice also has a treasure trove of paintings, statues, and frescoes in its
churches and palaces. Check out the cafes and shops, with their glass-
ware and wonderful Italian design items (including designer clothes).
Cruising into port
Ships generally dock at terminals about 15 to 20 minutes by boat from
St. Mark’s Square, though some of the small ships, like the SeaDream
yachts, dock right in the downtown area.
Scoring the best excursions
Venice City Sightseeing: Take a motor launch to St. Mark’s Square for a
guided walking tour of St. Mark’s Cathedral and a visit to Doge’s Palace,
the former residence of the Duke of Venice. The itinerary also includes

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 417

the Golden Staircase, where you can enjoy the views of St. Mark’s Basin.
You also cross the famous Bridge of Sighs and stop at the small work-
shops of glass manufacturers (3 hours; $50–$99).
The Grand Canal and the Inside Canal: Travel by motorboat with a
guide to find out how the city works — the police, fire brigade, even
wedding and funeral processions travel by boat. From the water, you get
a wonderful view of St. Mark’s Square and other sights, including palaces
and the Guggenheim Museum. You also go under the famous Rialto
Bridge (21⁄2 hours; $90–$110).
Evening Gondola Ride with Serenade: It may sound hokey, but we
think you’ll find something magical about exploring the canals of this
romantic city on these black pointy vessels, with a gondolier singing in
Italian (2 hours; $105).
Exploring on your own
Assuming your ship isn’t docked right in the downtown, you’ll have to
take a boat to get to St. Mark’s Square and the heart of Venice. Your
choices are taking the ship’s arranged boats, a private water taxi (which
is pricey), or a public water bus called a vaporetto (which is cheap).
Within walking distance: Take a boat to St. Mark’s Square. From there,
you can walk to the rest of the attractions that we list here. The square
is the cultural hub of the city, and you can easily spend hours here
watching people feed the pigeons, sitting with the fashionable in a cafe,
visiting the Basilica and Doge’s Palace, and shopping. As a tourist hub,
however, the square is very crowded during the day, particularly in the
summer high season. To avoid the crowds, go in the early morning or in
the evening. At night, you may catch free musical performances by
chamber orchestras and other groups.
St. Mark’s Basilica, located on the square, is nicknamed the “Church of
Gold” and is one of the most elaborate churches in the world. You can
see the Basilica’s dome as your ship moves down the Grand Canal. The
Marciano Museum contains the Triumphal Quadriga — four famous
horse statues looted from Constantinople by Venetian crusaders in 1204.
Admission to the Basilica is free, treasury $2.50, presbytery $2, and
Marciano Museum $2.
Men and women are banned from wearing shorts or exposing bare arms
or shoulders in the Basilica, and women may not wear skirts above the
knee. Silence is required, and no photos are allowed.
Near the bell tower of St. Mark’s (which at press time wasn’t open to
visitors wanting the bird’s-eye view from the top), is Palazzo Ducale
(Doge’s Palace), Italy’s grandest civic structure. Admission is $13 for
adults, $6 for students, $4 for children 6 to 13, and free for kids under 5.
You can shop right on the square and on the streets between the square
and the Rialto Bridge. A favorite shopping street is Salizzida San Moisé,
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
418

where you find designer shops such as Prada. Generally, the farther
away from St. Mark’s you go, the more reasonable the prices.
Beyond walking distance: A must-see attraction for lovers of modern art
is the Collezione Peggy Guggenheim, located in a waterfront palazzo on
the other side of the canal from St. Mark’s (you can get there by water taxi
or water bus, or take a long walk, crossing at the Ponte dell’ Accademia
bridge). The impressive palazzo, which was art patron Mrs. Guggenheim’s
home, houses works by Pollock, Ernst, Picasso, Braque, Magritte,
Duchamp, Chagall, Mondrian, Brancusi, Dalí, Giacometti, Moore, and
others. Admission is $9.50 for adults and $6.50 for students and children
16 and under.
Near the Ponte dell’Accademia bridge is the Galleria dell’Accademia, a
museum where the glory of old Venice lives on in a remarkable collec-
tion of paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries. Admission is $7 for
adults, $4 for students, and free for children 12 and under.
Portugal
First off, we know that Portugal isn’t on the Mediterranean. Even so, the
country’s capital city, Lisbon, is the starting point for some Mediterranean
itineraries.
Lisbon is Europe’s smallest capital, but it gives the impression of a cos-
mopolitan city, boasting seven hills and a pleasing combination of his-
tory, cultural arts, modern amenities, and visual treats. Some areas may
remind some visitors of Paris (with street painters and the like), others
of hilly San Francisco, and still others — such as the old Moorish Alfama
section — of a small, colorful town. Lisbon is a walking city, and you can
easily get around, although the hills may prove challenging to some.
Cruising into port
Cruise ships dock at the Port of Lisbon, about 15 minutes by car from
the city center.
Scoring the best excursions
Lisbon City Tour: Ride by bus around Lisbon to see a number of city high-
lights, including Avenida da Liberdade, with its mosaic-lined sidewalks
and the magnificent views of the River Tagus at Black Horse Square. Tour
the impressive Jerónimos Monastery. Also visit the National Coach
Museum or the Convent of Madre de Deus, founded in 1509, which con-
tains samples of religious architecture (31⁄2 hours; $44–$60).
Sintra and Estoril: This tour along the famous and scenic Estoril coast
includes such memorable highlights as Sintra — a serene historic resort
nestled in the forested hills of Serra de Sintra and the summer residence
of kings and nobility. Continue inland to Queluz to tour the magnificent

Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
420

18th-century palace built in the style of Versailles. Some tours also
include the well-known seaside resort of Cascais (4 hours; $44–$64).
Fatima and Batalha: Located 100 miles from Lisbon is the place known
to Roman Catholics as the “Lourdes of Portugal.” At Fatima, according to
legend, three young shepherds in 1917 claimed they saw the Virgin Mary
in an oak tree. Lunch is served at a local restaurant or hotel. The tour
continues on to Batalha for a visit to the impressive gothic church of
Santa Maria da Victoria (8–9 hours; $72–$130).
Exploring on your own
Taxis (usually diesel-engine Mercedes) are generally available outside
the terminal building to take you into the city center. The ride to the cen-
tral sightseeing and shopping districts is between $8 and $12. Traffic can
be congested, so give yourself extra time. The city also has a good bus
and tram service, as well as a subway, to get around. A funicular (eleva-
tor) connects the Baixa area, where you find shopping (between the
Rossio, which is the city’s main square, and the River Tagus), with the
Bairro Alto, where you find nightlife.
Within walking distance: You need to take a taxi to the Alfama, the
Belém area, and other sights.
Beyond walking distance: Houses in the alleys of the old Alfama dis-
trict are so close together that you can’t stretch your arms fully in some
places. Visit the 12th-century Sé (cathedral), check out the goods at the
markets, and climb up to the Castelo São Jorge (St. George’s Castle)
to enjoy the views. The fortress predates the Romans, and the Moors
erected many of the walls that still stand. On the grounds, you may
encounter a swan or rare white peacock. Admission is free.
Belém, where the River Tagus meets the sea, is where Portuguese explor-
ers such as Magellan launched their missions. Belém Tower is a 16th-
century monument to Portugal’s age of discovery and its famous seafar-
ers. Admission is $4 for adults, $2.25 for children, and free for seniors.
Nearby Jerónimos Monastery, built in 1502, stands as a masterpiece of
Manueline architecture. Admission to the church is free; admission to
the secluded monastery is $4.25 adults, $2.50 students, and free for chil-
dren and seniors. The Maritime Museum, located in the Jerónimos
Monastery’s west wing, is one of the most important of its kind in
Europe. It contains hundreds of ship models, ranging from 15th-century
sailing ships to 20th-century warships. Admission is $4 for adults, $2.25
for students, and free for seniors and children under 9.
Spain
Spain offers fascinating history, pretty beaches, Moorish palaces, quaint
villages, and, of course, Picasso. But you also feel the beat of the coun-
try’s modern-day vitality. Spain began to change with the death of

Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 423

Generalissimo Francisco Franco and the country’s entry into the
European Union; today the nation is undergoing a cultural renaissance.
Visitors delight in the energy of newly prosperous cities such as
Barcelona.
The Romans developed Barcelona as a port, and it has long been a
Mediterranean center of commerce. More recently, cruise lines, attracted
by the city’s prime location on the Iberian Peninsula, rediscovered its his-
torical, cultural, and artistic treasures.
Once home to artists such as Picasso, Miró, Dalí, and Casals, Barcelona
is renowned for its architecture, which mixes ancient Roman ruins and
buildings from the 13th and 15th centuries with startlingly modern cre-
ations by Antoni Gaudí and I. M. Pei. You can find great museums, friendly
people, pleasant cafes, and a very active nightlife. And Barcelona even has
sandy beaches thanks to a recently reclaimed waterfront.
Cruising into port
Ships dock in an industrial-looking port near the heart of Barcelona.
Depending on exactly where your ship ties up, you’re just a five-minute
walk from La Rambla (the Rambles), the part of Barcelona you want to
be in, or you’re 1 or 2 miles away — you may want to hop on the cruise
line’s shuttle service or jump in a cab.
Scoring the best excursions
City Highlights: This bus and walking tour includes the Gothic Quarter, a
stop at Montjuïc for the views, the Olympic Stadium, Gaudí’s La Sagrada
Familia, Les Ramblas, and Catalunya Square (31⁄2–4 hours; $32–$52).
Museums Tour: This tour visits the Picasso Museum and may include a
drive to Montjuïc for the impressive views, the Miró Foundation Museum,
and/or a drive past buildings created by Antoni Gaudí (31⁄2–4 hours;
$48–$62).
Pilgrimage to Montserrat: Head 36 miles north of Barcelona to the
sacred Mountain of Montserrat, one of Spain’s natural wonders. About
halfway up the mountain, the Montserrat Monastery is famous for its
shrine of the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Montserrat. Back in Barcelona,
enjoy a brief tour of the city before you return to the ship. Lunch is
included in the longer tours (5–7 hours; $69–$126); some tours provide
transportation only, and once there you’re on your own (4 hours, $44).
Exploring on your own
Taxis are available outside the terminal. They’re metered and the fare
begins at $3, plus about $1 per kilometer and an extra charge if the taxi
goes into the pier area (keep in mind, there are different rates for days
and evenings). The city also has a good Metro and bus system.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
424

In summer, Bus Turistic passes a dozen of the most popular sights, and
you can get on and off as you please. Or ride the Tibidabo funicular and
the Montjuïc cable car and funicular (both for panoramic city views)
for the price of a single ticket (about $18 per day). Purchase tickets on
the bus or at the transportation booth at Placa de Catalunya.
Within walking distance: Although you may be able to hoof it from the
docks to Barri Gòtic or La Rambla — both good starting points for a
walk — if your ship docks more than a five- or ten-minute walk away,
there’s nothing scenic about the route and we recommend that you get a
taxi or take the cruise line’s shuttle to get there faster. Upon arrival you
can easily reach many interesting sights on foot.
Beyond walking distance: In the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter), you can
wander for hours — getting lost is part of the fun. Stop in at the Gothic
Cathedral de Barcelona (admission to the church is free; the museum
costs $1.25) and saunter the cobblestone streets past fountains, vintage
stores, and cafes. Stroll La Rambla (the Rambles); Victor Hugo called
it “the most beautiful street in the world.” A tree-lined boulevard, the
street runs from Placa de Catalunya to the sea and bustles with 24-hour
street performers, flower vendors, birds in cages, cafes, and shops.
Watch out for pickpockets in the Barri Gòtic at night.
Two Gothic palaces house the Museu Picasso, which boasts an impres-
sive collection of the artist’s work. Pablo Picasso himself donated some
2,500 of his paintings to the collection, including a piece he painted at the
age of nine. Admission is $5.75 for adults, $3 for students, and free for kids
12 and under. A must-do is a glimpse at the fantastical work of Antoni
Gaudí. The designer’s creations in Barcelona include La Sagrada Familia
(Church of the Holy Family), a truly bizarre architectural wonder. You can
climb the spires if you’re not a claustrophobe. Admission is $9.25 for
adults, $5.75 for students and seniors, and free for kids under nine.
Shoppers delight in the offerings on Passeig de Gràcia, the main shopping
street, as well as on streets in the old quarter (including the Rambles).
Turkey
Turkey is literally where East meets West (Istanbul sits where Europe
and Asia touch). Very likely, this imaginary gateway is the most exotic
country you can visit on a Mediterranean cruise — a land of mosques
and minarets, sultans’ treasures, crowded bazaars, Greek and Roman
archaeological sites, and holy Christian landmarks. Although its cities
teem with the energy of a modern nation looking to the West, its villages
remain much as they’ve been for hundreds of years.
Because of the wide fluctuation of Turkish currency, only exchange the
amount that you intend to spend. The rug shops and some other ven-
dors often deal in U.S. dollars.
Chapter 17: Meandering in the Mediterranean 425

Istanbul
The city where the continents of Asia and Europe meet is chaotic, con-
gested, fascinating, and exciting. Cars careen (literally) past museums,
churches, palaces, grand mosques, and other historic monuments that
reveal a rich and ancient history. Among the many treats for your senses
are the smells of a spice market, the sound of prayer, the taste of tradi-
tional Turkish dishes, the feel of a Turkish carpet, and the treasures left
by rulers past.
Cruising into port
Ships drop anchor on the Bosporus (the strait between the Black Sea
and the Sea of Marmara) on the European side of the city; coming and
going, the views of Old Istanbul quite spectacular — minarets and
domes pierce the skyline. Taxis are relatively inexpensive and wait at
the pier (you can also find plenty throughout the city).
Scoring the best excursions
Highlights of Istanbul: This tour typically includes the Hippodrome,
once the largest chariot race grounds of the Byzantine Empire; the Sultan
Ahmet Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque for its 21,000 blue Iznik
tiles; the famous St. Sophia, once the largest church of the Christian
world; and Topkapi Palace, the official residence of the Ottoman Sultans
and home to treasures that include Spoonmaker’s Diamond, one of the
biggest in the world. The tour also visits the Grand Bazaar and its 4,000
shops. Some tours bring you back to the ship for lunch and others
include lunch in a first-class restaurant. You can also take shorter tours
that include some of the features of the full tour (7–10 hours; $90–$110).
Exploring on your own
It takes a healthy walk to get from the pier to the Blue Mosque. Your best
bet is to take the cruise line’s shuttle or a cab. The starting taxi fare is
about $1, and drivers apply a surcharge after midnight. The best way to
explore the old section is on foot.
Within walking distance: After you’re dropped off, visit the Ahmet
Mosque, built in the 17th century; admission is free. It features dazzling
blue and white Iznik tiles and six minarets. Guests must remove their
shoes at the entrance. The park in front of the Blue Mosque, the
Hippodrome, once held great chariot races. Nearby is Hagia Sophia, the
sixth-century basilica famous for its gigantic domes and magnificent
mosaics. Historians regard the church as one of the best examples of
Byzantine architecture. Admission to Hagia Sophia is $6.
From the 15th century to the mid-19th century, Topkapi Palace, located
at Kennedy Cad. Sultanahment, served as the residence of sultans. The
complex includes the chamber of the Sacred Mantle, harem quarters,
crown jewels, holy relics, and the throne room. Admission is $9; the
guided harem tour costs $7.50.

The Grand Bazaar (Kapalı Çar@ısı), with your best bet for entrance at
the Beyazit Gate or the Nuruosmaniye Gate, is the world’s largest cov-
ered market. More than 4,000 vendors sell carpets, leather goods, jew-
elry, antique reproductions, and other items. You can buy maps of the
Bazaar at newsstands for $6. The setting is a trip in itself, even if you buy
nothing. If you want to buy, make sure you bargain.
Beyond walking distance: The Dolmabache Palace, Dolmabache Cad,
is sometimes called the Ottoman Versailles. The extravagance includes a
4-ton Baccarat chandelier that was a gift from Queen Victoria. Admission
is $7 for a long tour (including the Sultan’s Quarters and Harem) or $6
for a short tour (of one room or the other). You must pay a fee of $13 to
use your video camera.
Ku@adasi
A favorite port for travelers interested in history, the once sleepy little
village of Ku@adasi is now a bustling seaside resort. The reason? Its prox-
imity to Ephesus, one of the most fascinating and best-preserved ancient
historical sites in the world, as well as other major early Christian and
historical locales. If the past isn’t your bag, you can stay in town and
shop (the best place in Turkey to bargain for Turkish rugs) or go to one
of the excellent nearby beaches for a swim.

Ku@adasi/Ephesus Region
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
428
Cruising into port
Ships dock right in downtown, so you can walk to stores and restaurants.
Scoring the best excursions
Ephesus: One of the world’s best-preserved ancient cities. Your guide
leads you down marble streets to the remains of the Baths, the theater,
and the incredible library building. Along the way, you pass columns,
mosaics, monuments, and ruins. The tour may include a stop at a rug
shop (3–4 hours; $40–$46).

Ephesus and The House of The Virgin Mary: This tour combines a visit
to Ephesus with a trip to the House of the Virgin Mary, a humble chapel
in the valley of Bulbuldagi on the spot where historians believe the
Virgin Mary spent her last days. The site was officially sanctioned for 
pilgrimage in 1892 (31⁄2–41⁄2 hours; $44–$52).
Ephesus, St. John’s Basilica, and House of the Virgin Mary: This tour
combines the two preceding tours with a visit to St. John’s Basilica,
another holy pilgrimage site. Some believe that St. John wrote the fourth
book of the New Testament at this site (41⁄2 hours; $56). Tour operators
may also offer the tour as a full-day excursion, including lunch in a local
restaurant and a visit to the museum of Ephesus (71⁄2 hours; $72–$98).
Three Ancient Cities: This tour takes in the ruins of the region, includ-
ing Priene, known for its Athena Temple (bankrolled by Alexander the
Great); Didyma, known for the Temple of Apollo; and Miletus, which
includes a stadium the Greeks built and the Romans expanded to hold
15,000 spectators. A light lunch is included (6–8 hours; $68–$89).
Exploring on your own
Though you can do a little shopping or have lunch in town, sign up for
one of your ship’s tours to Ephesus. Minibuses (available from the town
center) and taxis (yellow and metered) can get you to the beach.
Within walking distance: You can find plenty of places to shop and
haggle.
Vendors generally bump up prices when cruise ships are in port, and
they expect you to bargain. Shopkeepers often offer you tea or soft
drinks as negotiations get underway as part of Turkish hospitality;
accepting their hospitality in no way obligates you to buy.
Beyond walking distance: Book a shore excursion to tour Ephesus or
the other historic sites to get the most out of your visit. Law requires
Turkish guides to be licensed, so you can expect guides who are quite
knowledgeable about their subject matter.
Kadinlar Denizi is Ku@adasi’s most popular beach, located about 5 miles
from the port. Also known as Ladies Beach, the small stretch attracts a
large crowd, including women who like to sunbathe topless and macho
posers.
Ku@adasi isn’t known for culinary artistry. Still, if you want to try the
local cuisine, check out the restaurants along the harbor that specialize
in the catch of the day.

ave a yen to sail off the beaten path? The Caribbean, Alaska, and
the Mediterranean are all fine and good, but sometimes you really
want to do something a little different. In this chapter, we tell you about
some of the other options. Some cruise lines that sail in these regions are
also covered in the ship-review chapters of this book (Chapters 11–13).
In instances where the lines didn’t make the cruise-review chapters —
because they don’t operate in any big way in the Caribbean, Alaska, or
the Mediterranean — we include contact information that you can use to
get more details.
The American South and Midwest
Mark Twain discovered America’s heartland while traveling down the
Mississippi River, which he described as “the great Mississippi, the
majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along,
shining in the sun.” You can explore the America that so enticed the
writer by traveling down the very same river and in the very same way
as Twain: aboard a real paddlewheel steamboat.
Delta Queen (see Chapter 13), with its lovely 1927-built Delta Queen (an
actual National Landmark) and two newer steamboats, is the big cheese

is this region. The Mississippi River system (www.nps.gov/miss) con-
sists of some 50 rivers and tributaries, seven of which — the Atchafalaya,
Arkansas, Ohio, Tennessee, Cumberland, Missouri, and Illinois — are nav-
igable for considerable distances. From the rural plantation homes and
stately mansions of the antebellum south to the farmlands and Victorian-
era homes of the more northern reaches of the region, the experience is
pure Americana. Principal embarkation ports are Memphis, Nashville,
Cincinnati, and St. Louis.
RiverBarge Excursions (% 888-GO-BARGE; www.riverbarge.com)
also operates year-round river cruises on waterways including the
Mississippi, Cumberland, Ohio, and Missouri. The company offers 4- to
10-day cruises on the River Explorer that combines two hotel barges pro-
pelled by a tugboat.
If you want to feel like you’re sailing the ocean without being on the
ocean, you can also cruise on the Great Lakes with American Canadian
Caribbean (ACCL) and Clipper Cruises (see Chapter 13). The Traverse
City, Michigan-based Traverse Tall Ship Company (% 800-678-0383;
www.tallshipsailing.com) also offers sailings on Lake Michigan and
Lake Huron aboard Windjammer sailing ships.
If you’re hankering for a more offbeat river experience than you’ll find
on Mississippi and Great Lakes itineraries, American Cruise Lines
(% 800-814-6880; www.americancruiselines.com), based in Haddam,
Connecticut, operates three small ships on weeklong itineraries that
include Chesapeake Bay, the St. Johns and Tolomato rivers in Florida,
and the Intracoastal Waterway (between Charleston, South Carolina, and
Jacksonville, Florida). The line also offers New England cruises (see
“New England and Canada,” later in this chapter).
The Columbia and Snake Rivers
So, reading Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose sparked an ambi-
tion to copy Lewis and Clark? You’re in luck — several cruise lines tread
the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the U.S. northwest. As the second-
largest river in the United States (only the Mississippi is bigger), the
Columbia River winds between the Cascade Mountains and past the
Columbia River Gorge’s waterfalls and lush forests. Cruises depart from
Portland and follow the Columbia River east between Oregon and
Washington, sometimes going as far east as Idaho. Visits can include
Bonneville Dam, Hood River (the windsurfing capital of the world),
Hell’s Canyon, and the historic towns of the Oregon Trail.
American West Steamboat Company offers cruises that depart from
Portland year-round. Cruise West, Lindblad Expeditions, and American
Safari (see Chapter 13 for more on these lines) also offer small-ship
Columbia and Snake River cruises in the spring and fall.
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 431

New England and Canada
If you’re looking for a slow, easy meander past quaint, often un-touristy
towns — and couldn’t give a hoot about sunbathing and conga lines —
book a cruise along the coast of New England and eastern Canada. The
folksy vibe and the striking natural beauty of the northeastern Atlantic
coast are quite appealing, and we highly recommend taking a fall cruise
and feasting your eyes on the turning foliage. Attractions on the 7- to 14-
day cruises typically include stops in Boston, with its historic Freedom
Trail; Newport, Rhode Island, with its gorgeous mansions; Bar Harbor,
Maine, with its splendid hiking trails and scenic vistas; the trendy and
picturesque island of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, where notables
(including the Clintons) have been known to summer; the Canadian
coastal provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland;
and Quebec City or Montreal, two historic Canadian cities in bilingual
Quebec. Shorter cruises out of New York City, with lines such as
Carnival, may make just a stop or two in the Canadian provinces.
Cruises generally depart from New York or Boston and travel northward,
but you can also board in Montreal or Quebec City and sail south. Some
smaller ships sail in Canada’s St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers, or up
the coast to Labrador.
American Canadian Caribbean, American Cruise Lines, Carnival, Celebrity,
Clipper, Crystal, Cunard, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess, Radisson
Seven Seas, Royal Caribbean, Seabourn, and Silversea all have ships with
New England itineraries. Look for more detail on all these lines in
Chapters 11 through 13.
For a totally different New England experience, you can take a rustic,
fun cruise vacation on board a schooner. A fleet of tall ships based in
Rockland or Camden, Maine, sail from May to October in Maine’s scenic
Penobscot Bay, with itineraries dependent on the weather. The fleet of
schooners includes the historic Stephen Taber (% 800-999-7352) and
Victory Chimes (% 800-745-5651), and other members of the Maine
Windjammer Association (see Chapter 13).
Bermuda
Cruises to Bermuda, that neat and tidy British colony in the Atlantic
Ocean where it’s normal to pair brightly colored shorts with knee highs
and a jacket, usually combine several relaxing days at sea with several
relaxing days on the island. You can spend your island time exploring by
the preferred and fabulously fun means of transport — mopeds or scoot-
ers (rental cars are banned here) — and enjoy activities such as golf,
sunbathing on the island’s famous pink-sand shores, snorkeling, scuba
diving, joining glass-bottom boat tours, visiting museums and historic
homes, and savoring very proper High Tea. Opportunities abound for
shopping, too, especially for British goods such as wool sweaters and
Wedgwood china.
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
432

Bermuda’s ports of call are Hamilton, King’s Wharf, and St. George’s.
Celebrity, Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, and Radisson Seven Seas have
ships that sail Bermuda routes weekly, from late April to October, with
most of the cruises departing from New York, New Jersey, or Boston
on Saturday or Sunday. Norwegian also has Bermuda cruises from
Philadelphia and Charleston, and Royal Caribbean does Bermuda from
Baltimore. Radisson does a handful of Bermuda sailings from Florida and
from Norfolk. One-off- or two-off Bermuda cruises are offered by Costa
(from Florida) and Carnival (from New York). Cunard, Princess, Seabourn,
and Silversea also visit Bermuda as part of transatlantic crossings or in
combination with coastal Atlantic itineraries. We offer more detail on all
these cruise lines in Chapters 11 through 13.
Costa Rica
Most cruises to lush, green Costa Rica (“rich coast” in Spanish) explore
this Central American country’s natural wonders, offering tours of
beaches, rain forests, and mountains. Highlights include the indigenous
plant and animal life, including thousands of varieties of butterflies. In
addition to the numerous national parks, you can visit historic sites and
ruins.
Costa Rican ports of call include Bahia Herradura, Cano Island, Corcovado
National Park, Curu, Golfito, Golfo Dulce, Manuel Antonio Park, Marenco
Reserve, Playa Flamingo, Puerto Caldera, Puerto Limón, Puntarenas,
Quepos, and Tortuga.
Cruise West operates 7-day cruises in Costa Rica nearly year-round, and
the line also offers longer sailings that combine Costa Rica with a trip
through the Panama Canal (see the next section). Lindblad Expeditions
operates 7-day Costa Rican and Panama Canal cruises in the winter,
summer, and fall. See Chapter 13 for info on both lines.
Also cruising from Costa Rican ports (but on an occasional basis) are
Clipper, Crystal, Seabourn, Silversea, Windjammer, and Windstar.
Celebrity, Crystal, Holland America, Norwegian, Oceania, Princess,
Radisson Seven Seas, and Royal Caribbean all have ships that visit Costa
Rica as part of Caribbean, Panama Canal, or Central American itiner-
aries, stopping at Puerto Caldera or Puntarenas on the Pacific coast or
Puerto Limón on the Caribbean coast. Chapters 11 through 13 have
more about these cruise lines.
The Panama Canal
Ships pass through this eighth wonder of the world as part of one-way
repositioning cruises in the late fall and early spring as the cruise lines
move their vessels from the Alaskan market to the Caribbean market
and vice versa. Some lines also include the Panama Canal as part of
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 433

longer Caribbean, Central American, and South American itineraries in
the winter.
The reasons are both practical and scenic. Use of the canal trims some
8,000 nautical miles off a trip from, say, New York to San Francisco,
because without the continental passageway, ships must go south
around Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Traversing the 50-mile
canal takes just eight hours and provides a unique and fascinating expe-
rience. The water level lifts and lowers your ship 85 feet through a series
of locks, gates, and dams.
Panama Canal cruises can include stops at Central American ports such
as Cartagena, Colombia; Puerto Caldera, Puerto Limón, and Puntarenas
(all in Costa Rica); and Panama’s San Blas Islands — home of the Cuna
Indians, known for their colorful needlework. Itineraries often last ten
days or more, and may also include Caribbean or Mexican Riviera stops.
Cruise lines that make full or partial Panama Canal crossings include
American Canadian Caribbean, Celebrity, Clipper, Cruise West, Crystal,
Cunard, Holland America, Lindblad, Norwegian, Oceania, Princess,
Radisson Seven Seas, Royal Caribbean, Seabourn, and Silversea, all of
which we cover in Chapters 11 through 13.
The Mexican Riviera
The so-called Mexican Riviera — the stretch of port cities and resorts
extending from Mazatlán in the north to Acapulco in the south — is the
Caribbean of the west coast, offering gorgeous beaches, perfect weather,
beautiful scenery, and a good helping of rich Mexican culture. The glori-
ous beaches are the main attraction, along with the accessibility of golf,
tennis, deep-sea fishing, and water sports. Seven-day cruises leave year-
round from Los Angeles, Long Beach, or San Diego, visiting ports such as
Cabo San Lucas (a partying town and beach heaven at the southern tip
of Baja California) and the mainland cities of Mazatlán and Puerto
Vallarta, both of which combine beach resorts with historical and cul-
tural sites. Shorter 3- or 4-night cruises call at Catalina Island and
Ensenada, both in Baja, while longer cruises usually include a stop in
Acapulco. Some lines also visit the region as part of longer itineraries
that include the Panama Canal.
Carnival, Celebrity, Crystal, Holland America, Norwegian, Oceania,
Princess, and Royal Caribbean all have ships that sail in the area (see
Chapters 11 and 12).
Baja and the Sea of Cortez
Many small ships sail this region, which is sometimes referred to as
Mexico’s Galapagos for its rugged, arid scenery and its remarkable
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
434

wildlife, which includes gray whales in winter. Cruises typically mix
visits to the region’s cities and towns with stops at protected islands
in the Sea of Cortez. One day you’re in Cabo San Lucas, with its beach
scene and touristy bars, and the next you’re walking along the shore
of an uninhabited island, with no trace of human civilization in sight.
Whale- and wildlife-watching are major attractions, and you can also
hike, kayak, snorkel, and swim from beautiful, isolated beaches.
American Safari Cruises, Clipper Cruise Line, Cruise West, and Lindblad
Expeditions (see Chapter 13) all offer cruises in the region. Pre- and
post-cruise tours can take you to the great Copper Canyon — four times
larger than the Grand Canyon in the U.S., with four of its six individual
canyons deeper than the Grand too, some by more than 1,000 feet.
The Hawaiian Islands
Oh, right, Hawaii. That’s another word for paradise, right? Pretty much.
It’s got rugged coastlines, majestic volcanoes (some still active and
spewing lava), dramatic waterfalls, lush forests, abundant orchids and
other tropical flowers, and magnificent beaches — plus gorgeous hula
girls, hunky Polynesian men, and some of the most perfect weather you
can imagine, putting both locals and visitors in a friendly, mellow mood.
Cruising around the Hawaiian Islands gives you the chance to experi-
ence Hawaiian culture and food at a traditional luau, explore ancient
sacred places on land, snorkel or scuba around underwater reefs, golf on
picture-perfect courses, hike around a volcano’s crater (or even right
through it!), go bird-watching, learn to surf, or just hang on the beach
and be, you know, mellow. Hawaiians are fiercely proud of their culture,
which survives alongside the modern world in a vibrant arts scene that
includes traditional Polynesian dance, music, painting, sculpture, and
crafts. Pearl Harbor is another important attraction.
There’s an interesting caveat to sailing in Hawaii, though: The itineraries
are often wacky. See, U.S. law prohibits ships not built, registered, and
staffed in the United States from sailing directly to Hawaii from the con-
tiguous 48 states, or even from sailing within the islands themselves
unless they also make a stop in another country. The rules were origi-
nally written to protect U.S. shipbuilding and maritime industries, and
we won’t try to say whether they work or not. What we will say is that
they make it really difficult for most cruise lines to sail here, since nearly
everyone builds, registers, and staffs their ships abroad to keep costs
down. Some ships sail to the islands from Mexican ports such as
Ensenada. Others sail round-trip from Honolulu but make a detour to
one of the Polynesian nations in the middle of the cruise, while still
others visit in April/May and September/October, on their way between
seasons in Alaska and the Caribbean.
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 435

Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) took a different tack in 2003, agreeing to
play by most of the rules in exchange for a little government flexibility on
others. A special Congressional provision allows the Malaysian-owned
line to cruise the islands without calling at a foreign port, as long as NCL
flags its ships American, pays U.S. taxes, hires an all-American crew, and
abides by U.S. laws. The line began all-Hawaii cruises in July 2004 when it
introduced the first of its new NCL America brand ships, Pride of Aloha.
Another, Pride of America, just launched as this book was in production.
Both offer weeklong cruises round-trip from Honolulu, visiting a Hawaiian
port every single day. For that reason, NCL rules the Hawaiian roost for
the foreseeable future. If you sail here, it’ll probably be on one of the
Pride ships. A third vessel, Pride of Hawai’i, is due in summer 2006.
NCL sails the islands year-round. Other lines, including Carnival, Celebrity,
Holland America, Princess, Radisson Seven Seas, and Royal Caribbean,
offer cruises at different points of the year. See Chapters 11 and 12 for
more about all of these lines.
Tahiti and the South Pacific
Cruising here is like spending a week in paradise — and we don’t mean
some kind of phony “Calgon, take me away” kind of paradise either. No,
we mean the kind where the weather is always perfect, the beaches are
always clean and uncrowded, the water is always crystal blue, and the
people all look like angels. Up above, volcanic peaks poke holes in per-
fect blue skies, while down below, scuba divers and snorkelers swim
among thousands of species of fish and even humpback whales. If you’re
not into water activities, you can find plenty to do at visits to ports such
as Huahine, Moorea, Raiatea, and Bora Bora, including helicopter tours,
visits to black pearl farms, and Jeep safaris. Or you can just rent a bike
and explore.
Radisson Seven Seas (see Chapter 12) has its chartered ship Paul
Gauguin in Tahiti year-round at least through January 2007. Princess
(see Chapter 11) also has its small, 654-passenger Tahitian Princess there
throughout the year. All the cruises sail from Papeete, on the island of
Tahiti. Holland America (also reviewed in Chapter 11) also occasionally
offers Tahiti sailings, and other lines visit as part of longer itineraries
(sometimes world cruises).
Transatlantic Cruises
Most cruise lines offer transatlantic cruises simply because the Atlantic
is between the Caribbean and Europe, so why not put some passengers
on board when they move their ships between the two markets? The
actual crossings can take anywhere from six days to two weeks. The
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
436

shorter itineraries are usually just a straight sail across, with no port
calls; the longer ones include several ports before or after the crossing,
either on the Europe side or in the Caribbean or New England/Canada,
depending where the vessel is sailing from.
Cunard (see Chapter 12) is the only line that offers a regular schedule of
6-day transatlantic crossings from April through November aboard the
gigantic Queen Mary 2, which was built extra-tough, specifically for this
purpose. Other lines sail transatlantic on repositioning cruises, for
which good deals are often available.
The British Isles and Northern Capitals
A number of ships sail from England, either focusing entirely on ports
in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, or linking some of those ports
with visits to the capitals of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark,
and Germany. Cruise passengers get the city life of London and Dublin,
the golf of Scotland, the natural beauty of the coasts, and the charm of
the Channel Islands. The main season is April through October, with
most ships sailing from Southampton or Dover.
Celebrity, Princess, Oceania, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Radisson
Seven Seas, and Silversea offer cruises from and around the British Isles,
as do small-ship lines Clipper and Lindblad — the former on the great
expedition ship Clipper Adventurer, the latter aboard the 54-passenger
Lord of the Glens, which cruises in the highlands via the inland waterway
that links the country’s famed lochs. Cunard’s fabled QE2 is based in
Southampton for most of the year, offering cruises in the isles and the
Continent. You can find more detail on each of these lines in Chapters 11
through 13.
The Scandinavian Fjords
We never met a fjord we didn’t like, so how can we not like Norway (not
to mention Denmark and Sweden, the other two Scandinavian nations
visited regularly by cruise ships). Cruises lasting one to three weeks typ-
ically depart from Southampton, Amsterdam, or Stockholm, sailing up
the Norwegian coast with its never-ending string of deep fjords, small
fishing villages, wildflowers, and medieval cathedrals. Some ships sail up
above the Arctic Circle into the land of the midnight sun. Many routes
include Norway’s southern towns of Bergen and Oslo, as well as
Copenhagen, Stockholm, and ports along the Baltic Sea, such as Helsinki
and St. Petersburg.
Celebrity, Clipper, Costa, Crystal, Cunard, Holland America, Lindblad,
MSC, Oceania, Princess, Radisson Seven Seas, Royal Caribbean, Seabourn,
Chapter 18: Exploring Other Destinations 437

and Silversea all offer cruises in the region (and we cover all in Chapters
11 through 13). Although the main cruise season is May to September,
Norwegian Coastal Voyage (% 800-323-7436; www.coastalvoyage.com)
operates a fleet of working ships here year-round, bringing passengers
and cargo up and down the Norwegian coast, with dozens of stops along
the way.
European River and Canal Cruises
Cruising on Europe’s rivers and canals gets you inland without having to
take bus tours or car treks, and gives you a close-up view of the coun-
tries you visit. The pace is leisurely and the ambience informal — like
booking a B&B or country inn that just happens to float.
River cruises are aboard 100- to 200-passenger vessels that sail the
Danube, Rhine, Rhone, Moselle, Elbe, Seine, and other rivers in Germany,
Switzerland, Hungary, Holland, France, Austria, the Czech Republic, and
sometimes Russia. Canal cruises are on intimate barges that usually
carry between 6 and 24 passengers, sailing the back waterways of
France (including Burgundy, Provence, the upper Loire, and the Loire
Valley), Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and so on. The season
generally runs from mid-March through early November.
Top operators include Abercrombie & Kent (% 800-554-7016; www.
abercrombiekent.com); The Barge Lady (% 800-880-0071; www.barge
lady.com); French Country Waterways (% 800-222-1236; www.fcwl.
com); Peter Deilmann Cruises (% 800-348-8287; www.deilmann-
cruises.com); Uniworld (% 800-733-7820; www.uniworld.com); and
Viking River Cruises (% 877-668-4546; www.vikingrivercruises.
com).
Antarctica
Got a hankering to head to the bottom of the earth? Got a hankering to
see waddling penguins, towering icebergs, giant albatrosses, and more
seals than you can count? A tour of the Great White Continent may be
for you, visiting scientific research stations and islands reachable only
by small landing craft.
Most Antarctica cruises depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, although some
sail from ports in Chile or from Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. The
cruise season is January and February, and the offerings mostly range
from 8 to 15 nights.
Adventure cruise pioneer Lars-Eric Lindblad was the first to bring travel-
ers to the southern end of the world in 1965, and the company his son
Part V: Calling All Ports: Where to Go and Why 
438

founded, Lindblad Expeditions (see Chapter 13), maintains a big pres-
ence here, frequently visiting Lindblad Cove, named for Lars-Eric in
honor of his achievements. Upscale tour operator Abercrombie & Kent
(% 800-554-7016; www.abercrombiekent.com), extreme adventure

Before you leave the ship, there are a few things you have to get settled.
In this chapter, we walk you through them, and try to make the whole
process as painless as possible.
Settling Your Bill
On the last night of your cruise, an itemized account of all you’ve
charged up to that point will be left in your cabin. Look it over. If you
agree with the charges, they’ll automatically be billed to the credit card
you registered at the start of your cruise. If you’d rather pay in cash or
with a different card — or if you dispute any of the charges — you need
to stop by the reception desk and hash it out with the purser’s staff.
Leaving Your Tips
Most cruise lines pay their service staff low base wages with the under-
standing that the bulk of their income will come from tips. In the old
days, the last hours of a cruise were a flurry of little white envelopes, as

passengers slipped cash to their cabin steward, waiter, assistant waiter,
and sometimes maitre d’ and favorite bartender.
That’s still the way of it on some lines, but these days a lot of others
(Carnival, Costa, Holland America, Norwegian, Oceania, and Princess, for
example) are automatically adding tips to passengers’ onboard accounts,
with the amount adjustable up or down if you request it at the purser’s
desk before the end of the cruise. The base amount varies by cruise line,
but expect to pay between $8.50 and $11.50 per person, per day.
Some lines, such as Royal Caribbean and Disney, give you the option of
paying cash directly to staff or adding the gratuities onto your account.
Most small-ship lines pool the tips and divide them up among all
crewmembers after you’re gone.
And then there are the real ultraluxury lines, such as Silversea, Seabourn,
SeaDream, and Radisson, where tips are included in your up-front cost.
Windstar promotes its “tipping not required” policy, but “required” is
the operative word: Tipping really is expected.
Each line has clear guidelines, which you’ll usually find out about in
each line’s brochures, Web sites, cruise documents, daily program for
the last day, and/or debarkation briefing.
On lines that follow traditional person-to-person gratuity policies, tip
your waiter and assistant waiter during the cruise’s final dinner, and
leave your cabin steward his or her tip on the final night or morning, just
before you disembark. Generally, expect to tip between $9 and $13 total
per person, per day (half that for kids). We usually divide it up as $3.50
per day for the cabin steward, $3.50 for the dining room waiter, and about
$2 for the assistant waiter. Some lines suggest you tip the maitre d’ about
$5 per person for the week and slip another couple bucks to the chief
housekeeper, but we’ll leave that up to you. Guests staying in suites with
butler service should slip the gent $3.50 per day. A 15 percent gratuity is
usually included on every bar bill, so you don’t have to tip your bar-
tender with every drink. (The exception is on NCL’s Hawaii ships.)
Packing Up
A day or two before the end of the cruise, you’ll receive color-coded or
numbered luggage tags based on your cabin category and flight time.
These determine the order you’ll disembark ship on the last day. Attach
them to any bags you want the ship’s staff to carry off the ship for you.
Plan to pack your bags before dinner on your final night aboard. You’ll
be asked to leave your luggage outside your cabin door by midnight or
thereafter so that staff can carry it all to a central offloading location.
First-time cruisers always worry about leaving their bags out in public,
but we’ve never heard an instance of anything being stolen.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
444

Especially on megaships, where ship staff collect and offload upwards
of 5,000 or 6,000 pieces of luggage in just a few hours, don’t expect that
your luggage will be treated gently. If you’ve bought anything breakable on
your trip — pottery, glass, or bottles of duty-free liquor, for example —
carry them off the ship yourself rather than packing them in your checked
luggage.
Disembarking, Whether You Want to or Not
Big ships typically offload passengers based on a color or number code
that matches the one on your luggage tags. Ships normally arrive in port
on the final day before 8 a.m., but usually need at least 90 minutes to
complete docking formalities, get cleared by authorities, and unload
baggage. No one disembarks much before 9 a.m., and even then you may
have to wait a while before your color code is called. Passengers with
early flights and passengers who’ve paid the most (suite passengers, for
example) are typically allowed off first.
So they have time to clean up before the next group of passengers arrive,
cruise lines usually ask that you vacate your cabin early, have breakfast,
and wait in a lounge for your color or number to be called. If your hand
luggage is heavy or unwieldy, though, you can leave it in your cabin and
go back for it before you disembark.
If you’re sailing on a small or very high-end ship, you can usually just get
off when the captain gives the all-clear. Them’s the virtues of smallness.
Once you disembark, you’ll find your bags waiting for you in the terminal,
organized by the colored or numbered tags you attached. Attendants are
standing by to help you should your bag not be where it’s supposed to be.
Claim your luggage, head through Customs (see below), then board what-
ever transportation you’ve arranged — your car, a taxi, a cruise line bus
transfer to the airport, or “other.”
Understanding Immigration (We Wish)
U.S. passport requirements were in flux as this book was being prepared,
with a new initiative set to mandate passports for all travel outside the
U.S. by 2008. (Previously, U.S. citizens didn’t need passports for travel to
Mexico, Canada, and most Caribbean countries.) Depending on the imple-
mentation schedule for this initiative — and the process the Department
of Homeland Security comes up with for cruise passengers — you may
have to pass through Immigration and have your passport stamped as
you leave the ship.
Non-U.S. citizens and green card holders definitely have to see an immi-
gration official. Your ship will give you details about the where and when.
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Do When Your Cruise Ends 445

Getting Through Customs
When you leave the ship after visiting a foreign country (or when you
arrive home after flying from a ship that disembarks you in a foreign
country), you must fill out a Customs declaration form. In the United
States, rules for what you can and can’t bring back are enforced by the
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and although inspectors don’t
check each and every bag that comes back into the country, you don’t
want to get caught breaking the rules — say, for trying to sneak in Cuban
cigars. Customs applies stiff fines for doing so.
If you take a cruise that sails from the U.S. and visits foreign ports (in the
Caribbean, Canada, Central America, Mexico, or The Bahamas, for exam-
ple), you’ll receive a Customs form the last night of your sailing and clear
Customs at the pier when you arrive. If you get off the ship in another
country, you clear Customs at the airport when you get back to the United
States (or at a border point, if you drive).
Read and review your Customs form thoroughly. Make sure that you
fill in the spaces correctly (if you mess up, ask for another form). You
need to fill out only one form per family. You must declare all items you
acquired abroad and are bringing back into the U.S., including purchases
(for yourself and/or others), gifts, and duty-free items. On your Customs
form, state the price you paid for all items, including tax.
All Americans returning from abroad get a duty-free exemption, also
called a personal exemption. That’s the total value of merchandise you
may bring back to the States without having to pay duty — otherwise
known as tax. You can bring back more than your exemption, but if you
do, you’ll have to pay the taxes on it.
When you see the term duty free at all those shops in the Caribbean,
Europe, and elsewhere (including in the shops on your ship), it doesn’t
mean you won’t pay tax on it ever; it just means you won’t pay tax when
you buy it. Duty-free items do count toward your personal exemption.
In most cases, the personal exemption is $800, but depending on which
countries you visited, your exemption may be as little as $200 or as much
as $1,600. There are also limits on the amount of alcoholic beverages
(usually 1 liter), cigarettes (1 carton), cigars (100 total, and no Cubans!),
and other tobacco products you may include in your personal duty-free
exemption.
The $200 exemption applies to people who have been out of the country
more than once in a 30-day period, and to people who’ve been out of the
country less than 48 hours before returning.
The $1,600 exemption applies to people who are traveling to a Caribbean
Basin or Andean country or countries and to a U.S. insular possession,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
446

such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or Guam. But only $800
worth of your items may come from the Caribbean Basin or Andean
countries.
Confused yet?
Family members who live in the same home and return to the country
together may combine their personal exemptions into a joint declara-
tion. For example, if while traveling abroad Mr. Scnozzlehammer buys a
$600 guitar and Mrs. Scnozzlehammer buys a $1,000 sculpture, they can
combine their $800 exemptions on a joint declaration and not have to
pay duty.
For more specifics, visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Web site
at www.cpb.gov. Canadian citizens should look at the Canada Border
Services Agency site (www.cbsa.gc.ca), and citizens of the U.K. should
visit the U.K. Customs and Excise site (www.hmce.gov.uk).
If you go over your exemptions (dollar-wise and amount of liquor and cig-
arettes wise), the next $1,000 worth of goods bought in most countries
will be taxed at a flat rate of 3 percent (1.5 percent for U.S. insular posses-
sions). Above that, the Customs officer will levy duties at whatever duty
rates apply. That sounds vague, right? Well it is (for us) and isn’t (for the
government). See, under what’s know as its “301” authority, the U.S. Trade
Representative is authorized to impose different duty rates for different
items from different countries — sometimes up to 100 percent of an item’s
value. Most of these items aren’t things travelers would be bringing back
with them, but some are: diamonds from the Ukraine, for example.
You can pay in cash (U.S. dollars only), by personal check, or, at most
airports, by MasterCard or Visa.
Mailing Goods to Yourself
You can mail items you purchase abroad home to yourself, but in gen-
eral they’ll be subject to duty when they arrive, and cannot be counted
toward your personal exemption. One loophole in this is that goods
from the Caribbean and U.S. insular possessions (including the U.S.
Virgin Islands) carry an $800 and $1,600 duty-free exemption, respec-
tively. Duty is charged at a flat rate for the next $1,000 of value (3 per-
cent for Caribbean Basin countries, 1.5 percent for U.S. possessions).
Knowing What’s Prohibited or Restricted
When you read all the rules, you discover how complex this whole
Customs business is. For example, the following list includes some
things you can’t bring back into the United States (or whose importation
is subject to limits). For restrictions for Canadian or U.K. citizens, check
the appropriate Web site (listed in the preceding section).
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Do When Your Cruise Ends 447

 Cuban cigars: Number-one on the banned-articles hit parade! You’ll
see Cuban cigars for sale in Canada, Mexico, Europe, and elsewhere,
but Uncle Sam will come down on you in righteous 1960s-era Bay of
Pigs fury if you try to bring them back to the U.S. Smoke ’em while
you got ’em.
 Meat and many other food products: Customs is very strict about
food products. Any fruits or vegetables you’re carrying must be
declared to the Customs officer and be presented for inspection —
even that apple you put in your pocket at the ship’s buffet on
debarkation morning. Meats, livestock, poultry, and their by-
products are either totally prohibited or restricted from entering
the country, depending on the animal-disease condition in the
country of origin. Fresh meat from most countries is generally pro-
hibited, while canned, cured, or dried meat is severely restricted.
Ditto for almost anything containing meat products, such as bouil-
lon, soup mixes, and so on. Bakery items and all cured cheeses are
generally admissible, as are most condiments, vinegars, oils, pack-
aged spices, honey, coffee, and tea.
 National treasures: Most countries have laws that protect culturally
important antiquities such as art, artifacts, and other archaeological
and ethnological materials. Such laws include export controls and/or
national ownership of cultural property. Even if purchased from a
business in the country of origin or in another country, legal owner-
ship of such artifacts may be in question if you try to bring them into
the United States. It’s unlikely you’ll buy anything that would fall
under this category on your cruise, but it’s something to keep in
mind if you’re shopping for high-priced antiquities, particularly in
places such as Greece or the Middle East. U.S. law also restricts the
importation of specific categories of art/artifacts/antiquities, includ-
ing any pre-Columbian monumental and architectural sculpture and
murals from Central and South American countries; First Nations
(Native American) artifacts from Canada; Mayan pre-Columbian
archaeological objects from Guatemala; pre-Columbian archaeologi-
cal objects from El Salvador and Peru; archaeological objects (such
as terracotta statues) from Mali; Colonial-period objects (such as
paintings and ritual objects) from Peru; Byzantine-period ritual and
ecclesiastic objects (including religious icons) from Cyprus; and
Khmer stone archaeological sculpture from Cambodia.
 Live animals: Sorry, you can’t bring home that cute little dog who
befriended you in Mexico. Don’t take it so hard. You’ve heard that
old story anyway, right, about the family who adopted the Mexican
street dog, got it home, and had the vet tell them it was actually
a rat?
 Some wildlife products: This is one you may actually run up
against while you’re cruising. Following international prohibitions
on products made from endangered species, the U.S. prohibits
importation of elephant ivory (unless you have documentation
showing it to be more than 100 years old), sea turtle products
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
448

(including turtle leather boots, tortoiseshell jewelry, and sea turtle
oil cosmetics), coral (including all that black coral jewelry you see
in the Caribbean), crocodile or caiman leather, feathers and feather
products from wild birds, fur from spotted cats, and other less
common items. If you try to sneak in any of these souvenirs,
Customs inspectors can confiscate them and issue a fine. Ditto for
products made from dog or cat fur.
 Plants and seeds: Some plants, cuttings, seeds that are capable of
propagation, unprocessed plant products, and certain endangered
species are allowed into the United States if you have the proper
import permits, while others are prohibited entirely. Every plant or
plant product (including handicraft items made of straw), must be
declared to Customs and presented for inspection.
 Bootleg and pirated goods: Travelers arriving back in the United
States are allowed to import one copy each of any pirated work or
object, as long as it’s for your personal use, not for resale. This
applies to CDs, DVDs, books, handbags, $12 “Rolex” watches, $18
“Armani” jeans, and other fakes.
 More than $10,000 in currency: You can bring in or take out of the
country as much cash as you like, but if it’s more than $10,000, you
have to report it to Customs.
 Drugs and medicines: Narcotics and certain other drugs with a high
potential for abuse — including Rohypnol, GHB, and Fen-Phen —
may not be brought into the United States. Medications that can be
legally prescribed in the United States may be imported for personal
use, but restrictions apply. Contact Customs for details.
 Absinthe: Strange but true: In the 21st century, Customs actually
lists absinthe as one of the items you can’t bring back into the
United States (since its active ingredient, Thujone, has a similar
chemical structure to Tetrahydrocannabinol — the thing that
makes marijuana marijuana). Lord Byron would be appalled.
Taking Back Value-Added Tax 
and Goods-and-Services Tax
As if dealing with Customs restrictions isn’t confusing enough, other
countries have tax oddities that may actually get you some money back.
European countries, for example, levy a tax called the value-added tax
(VAT) on all items. Unlike American taxes, it’s already included in the
price of the item. The tax ranges from 15 to 35 percent (varying by coun-
try), but you may be able to get it refunded if you spend a designated
amount (normally between $50 and $200) in a single store.
By far the easiest way to get your money back is to go through the
store’s refund affiliate, which you can identify by a decal in the store
Chapter 19: Ten Things to Do When Your Cruise Ends 449

window. The biggest of these services is Global Refund, which has its
“Tax Free Shopping” sticker in more than 225,000 stores in 35 countries.
Using them as an example, all you do is shop where you see their sign;
ask for your Global Refund Cheque; when leaving the country (let’s say
at the airport), show your purchases, receipts, and passport to Customs
officials and have your cheques export validated; then collect your
refund in cash at the airport’s Global Refund Office or send the cheques
to the company to get your money back.
A number of other companies operate the same way, with their own net-
works of retail outlets and airport offices.
Be aware that an administrative fee is deducted from your refund.
In Canada, a goods and services tax (GST) of 7 percent applies to most
goods and services sold in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario,
Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories,
Nunavut, and the Yukon. A harmonized sales tax (HST) of 15 percent is
applied to the same goods and services as the GST in New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia. Non-resident visitors can
claim a refund for accommodation and goods as long as each item is
worth more than C$50 and the total is at least C$200 (before taxes).
Keep your receipts and pick up a Tax Refund Application for Visitors at
any Customs office or at most visitor centers, duty-free shops, depart-
ment stores, and some hotels. Also, keep your airline boarding passes,
which you may have to mail in with the form. If you leave the country by
plane, car, or motor coach, you have to show your goods at the border
(or airport) and get your receipts validated, or you can’t get a refund.
You can find more information on Canadian tax refunds at www.
cra-arc.gc.ca.
Dealing with Departure Tax
Something to remember if your cruise ends in a foreign country from
which you plan to fly home: Some countries levy a departure tax on
everyone who leaves. It normally, but not always, costs you less than
$20. When you depart from Vancouver Airport, for example, you incur
an airport improvement fee of C$10 (about US$8), payable in U.S. or
Canadian dollars. So don’t spend every penny you have before you get
to the airport. The airline can tell you the exact tax amount in advance.

Matt and Heidi’s Ten
Favorite Cruise
Experiences
In This Chapter
 Sailing, exploring, cruising, and tipping back a few
 Gaping, dining, luxuriating, and reboarding
W
e practically make a living out of arguing. In fact, we do a regular
“He Said–She Said” column in Porthole cruise magazine about our
opinions on various aspects of cruising. Though we shamelessly enjoy
bickering, we really aren’t always at odds. In fact we often agree. And so,
in this chapter, we share our favorite cruise experiences, which touch on
some similar themes.
Matt’s Top Five Cruise Experiences
First, a little background: Living in Brooklyn, New York, Matt is a writer
and musician, early 40-something, and newly married as you read this.
His tastes tend toward high culture, low culture, and pretty much noth-
ing in the middle. He’s equal parts curmudgeon, booster, anarchist, and
detail-oriented wonk. If he likes something, he’ll tell you. If he doesn’t,
he’ll tell you that, too. Here are some of his cruise ship–related faves.
Appreciating the art of sailing
Ships are amazing things, whether they’re great, hulking megas or small,
graceful schooners. Human civilization would never have gotten where it
is today without them, and without the people who pilot them. Take
some time to appreciate the work and dedication that goes into design-
ing and building your vessel, guiding it across the ocean, and making it
run smoothly and safely. Think of all the people who have sailed before
you. That sense of history is why there’s a romance to sea travel that
you’ll never get if you just fly everywhere.

Walking the ports of call
Sure, shore excursions can be fun, and sometimes they really are the
best way to see the sights, but if you’re in a walkable historic town —
whether it be New York, Barcelona, Mazatlan, San Juan, Bordeaux, Sitka,
or any one of a thousand others — I can think of few better ways to get
acquainted than by just stepping off your ship and walking around.
You’ll see and smell things from ground level — and at a human pace
rather than a bus-view fly-by — and get a much better sense of the
town’s character. Try to get beyond the typical tourist areas, too, out to
where people live, and try to find some of the local oddities that give a
place its character — little local museums, community gardens, well-
kept residential streets. The people who maintain them are your neigh-
bors on this planet. Go say hello.
Exploring the smaller, more niche-oriented cruise lines
For a lot of destinations — including Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, the
U.S. East Coast, and of course the world’s rivers — I think small ships
are a far better option than large cruise ships. Why? Fewer things to dis-
tract you from the scenery; an ability to sail into narrower, shallow
waters and ports; a low-key vibe; and fellow passengers who want to
keep the focus on nature, history, and culture. Sure, the small ships are
more expensive, but doing a cost-benefit analysis may make that pill
easier to swallow (see Chapter 13 for more info about these ships).
Seeking out traditional culture
As a cruise passenger, you start with a few limitations if you really want
to learn about the place you’re visiting. For one thing, you’re usually
only able to visit the coast, and the culture of port towns is usually dif-
ferent from that in the heartland. For another thing, you’re usually only
in port for eight or ten hours. Still, with a little effort, you can learn at
least a few things about the local culture and traditions that’ll give you
something more to take home than just a miniature made-in-China totem
pole. In Alaska, many ports have Native community houses where local
tribes put on shows of traditional dance and music. In the Yucatán, you
can visit ruins that show the complexity of Mayan culture. In Honduras,
you can visit with local Indian tribes and learn how they live. Know how
they say travel broadens the mind? This is what they’re talking about.
Sipping brews on ship and shore
One of the ways I judge a ship is by its beer selection. Ditto for port
towns — hell, for whole countries for that matter. Some ships have bars
that are particularly well stocked — Queen Mary 2, for example, as well
as the British P&O ships, and Royal Caribbean isn’t bad either. In some
ports (Juneau, Halifax, Dublin, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and so on), you
can tour the local and, in some cases, world-famous breweries. At the
very least, most cities have at least a few great bars. Mark this down as
another opportunity to get a “taste” of the local culture.

452

Heidi’s Top Five Cruise Experiences
Okay, Heidi’s story: She’s a not-quite 40-year-old writer living in
Manhattan who also wears the hat of wife and mother. She considers
herself somewhat of a chameleon. She can blend into the crowd at a
fancy dinner party or play pool in an old-man bar down on the corner.
She can duck fistfuls of macaroni and cheese while sipping a glass of
Verve Cliquot. This mother of 3-year-old twin boys is used to going with
the flow. While she now lugs her adorable twosome on most cruises, she
can still remember what it was like before, when only her selfish needs
mattered. Here are her favorite cruise moments.
People-watching
Few places offer such perfect conditions for the sport. Ships big and
small offer prime peeking opportunities, though the bigger they are, the
more players in the show. My nightly routine goes like this: Find a comfy
bar stool in the middle of the hubbub, an hour or so before the dinner
rush. Here’s when you realize what a melting pot the megaships really
are. You see all kinds, from dumpy couples in matching Hawaiian shirts
strolling hand-in-hand, to hip families dressed in black, and showy
botoxed types sportin’ major bling bling.
Getting into the glamorous dining scene
Allow me to qualify this: There are plenty of loud, crowded restaurants
on ships, but I’m talking about those few intimate venues that cater to
adults with a penchant for gorgeous atmosphere, excellent cuisine and
wine, impeccable service, and dressing up. The alternative restaurants
on Celebrity’s Millennium, Infinity, Constellation, and Summit are like
something out of a 1940s Cary Grant movie. The Edwardian-style
Olympic restaurant on the Millennium, for example, takes your breath
away with its décor alone: several dozen hand-carved and gilded French
walnut wall panels that come straight from an ocean liner that sailed
more than 70 years ago.
Agreeing (finally) that small ships are priceless
Sure, Heidi the chameleon changes her spots when she’s on a megaship
and can enjoy the Vegas thing (it’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do
it), but her heart belongs to small ships. You get cozy with the crew and
your fellow shipmates fast, and you feel like you’re all in a vacation
adventure together. And you sure can’t beat a small-ship itinerary;
they’re always way more interesting and offbeat. In places such as Jost
Van Dyke or Monte Carlo or Santoríni, you’ll feel like you’re on a ship
that belongs there.
Soaking up the tradition — tradition!
Okay, these days you may have to look hard to find it, but it’s there.
Vestiges of a more elegant, refined, and formal time. Officers still look
Chapter 20: Matt and Heidi’s Ten Favorite Cruise Experiences 453

ultrasmart in their crisp white or black uniforms. The captain is still
commander of the ship and almost godlike when he walks the decks and
nods hello to passengers. I get all sentimental when I hear a big band
playing oldies in a lounge. The warm fuzzies hit when I’m sitting in a
darkened theater, enjoying the pleasant buzz from wine at dinner, as a
troupe of singers and dancers do Cole Porter and Steven Sondheim clas-
sics. It’s all against the backdrop of those wooden decks and polished
railings and that haunting ship’s horn . . . sigh.
Coming back . . . to the mother ship
After a particularly satisfying day doing something totally cool and
exhausting — such as climbing the narrow spires of Antonio Gaudi’s
Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, or hopping on a six-seater pontoon plane
for a totally breathtaking, white-knuckle ride over glaciers and snowy
peaks in Alaska — coming back to the ship is like coming back to a cozy,
nurturing nest. A place to unwind and regroup and reboot. Your cabin’s
all made up, the bathroom’s stocked with fresh towels, and a cool drink
and a tasty dinner are just a few decks away.

The following sections include some of the top cruise agencies in the
United States. The Web-based agencies take bookings online and over

The bricks-and-mortar agencies aren’t specifically Web-based (although
some have a significant Web presence). We list only the main offices.
