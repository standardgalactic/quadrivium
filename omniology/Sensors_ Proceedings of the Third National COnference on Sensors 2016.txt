Preface
This book gathers scientiﬁc contributions presented at the 3rd National Conference
on Sensors held in Rome, Italy from 23 to 25 February 2016. The conference has
been organized by a partnership of the major scientiﬁc societies and associations
involved in the research area of sensors, the Italian Society of Chemistry (SCI), the
Italian Association of Electric and Electronic Measures (GMEE), the Italian
Association of Ambient Assisted Living (AITAAL), the Italian Society of Optics
and Photonics (SIOF), the Italian Association of Sensors and Microsystems
(AISEM), the Italian Society of Pure and Applied Biophysics (SIBPA), the Italian
Association of Photobiology (SIFB), the Association Italian Group of Electronics
(GE) and the Association NanoItaly.
The third edition of the conference has conﬁrmed a large participation with
approximately 60 oral presentations, 80 poster presentations and over 150 dele-
gates. The driving idea of the ﬁrst conference, to gather scientists having different
expertise and with different cultural background, dealing with all the different
aspects of sensors, has proved to be indeed successful again.
In this perspective, the book represents an invaluable and up-to-the-minute tool,
providing an essential overview of recent ﬁndings, strategies and new directions in
the area of sensor research. Further, it addresses various aspects based on the
development of new chemical, physical or biological sensors, assembling and
characterization, signal treatment and data handling. Lastly, the book applies
electrochemical, optical and other detection strategies to relevant issues in the food
and clinical environmental areas, as well as industry-oriented applications.

Abstract. A thermal ﬂow sensor integrated with a programmable electronic
interface into the same chip is proposed. The sensing structure is a micro-
calorimeter with a double heater conﬁguration fabricated with a simple
post-processing technique applied to chip designed with a commercial CMOS
process. The electronic interface is based on a low-noise, low-power instrumenta-
tion ampliﬁer and a conﬁgurable heater current driver. The device characterization
in nitrogen conﬁrms the possibility to manage the trade-off between the sensitivity
and the power delivered to the device by means of the programmable interface.

Introduction
Micromachined thermal ﬂow sensors are used in applications that require measurement
and control of small ﬂuid ﬂow rates with high accuracy and resolution [1, 2].
Microsensors with fast response times and low power consumption can be integrated
with the read-out electronics into the same chip thanks to the development of the
silicon micromachining technologies. These devices have matured from the research
stage to commercial products with response times in the order of millisecond and
power consumptions of a few tens of milliwatts [3]. Nevertheless, emerging
battery-power applications are imposing requirements that are more stringent in terms
of power consumption. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of thermal ﬂow sensors is pro-
portional to the power delivered to the sensing structure [4], so a trade-off between
power and sensitivity has to be considered.
In this work, we propose a smart ﬂow sensor where the power delivered to the
sensing structure can be set through the integrated programmable electronic interface
that performs signal reading, offset compensation and heater driving. The device
belongs to the thermal sensor platform proposed in [5], which includes diverse ﬂow
sensors, acoustical particle velocity detectors and a pressure sensor based on the
micro-Pirani principle. The ﬂow sensor is a micro-calorimeter made up of two

polysilcon heaters placed between two temperature probes. The sensing structure has
been fabricated by applying a simple post-processing procedure to chip designed with a
commercial CMOS process of STMicroelectronics.

Device Description and Fabrication
The sensing structure has been integrated with the electronic interface into the chip
shown in Fig. 1. The chip has been designed with the BCD6s process of STMicro-
electronics and includes diverse sensors based on a thermal principle, as detailed in [5].
The structure involved in this work has been highlighted in Fig. 1. It is a calorimeter
made up of two polysilcon heaters placed between two temperature probes consisting
of 10 n-polysilicon/p-polysilicon thermocouples. The heaters and the hot contacts of
the thermopile have been placed over suspended silicon dioxide membrane while the
cold contacts of the thermopiles are in thermal contact with the silicon substrate. The
suspended membranes have been obtained by applying a simple post-processing
technique to the chips returned by the silicon foundry. A detailed description of the
sensing structure and the fabrication process is reported in [6]. Brieﬂy, the
post-processing procedure consists of two main steps. First, dielectric layers have been
selectively removed from the front-side of the chip in order to access the bare silicon
substrate. The dielectric layers have been etched with a RIE (reactive ion etching) in
CF4/Ar (50%/50%) gas mixture using an 8 lm thick photoresist ﬁlm (MEGAPOSIT™
SPR™220–7.0) as a mask. Second, the silicon substrate has been anisotropically
etched for 150 min at 85 °C in a solution of 100 g of 5 wt% TMAH with 2.5 g of
silicic acid and 0.7 g of ammonium persulfate.

Micrographs of the sensing structure after the silicon removal are shown in Fig. 2.
In the optical micrograph, the two polysilicon heaters, placed over rectangular mem-
branes, and the two thermopiles, placed over cantilevers, are clearly visible. In the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph it can be noted the cavity that allows
the thermal insulation of the sensing structures from the substrate.
The electronic interface has been optimized with respect to [7] in order to minimize
power consumption preserving low noise performances. It includes a low noise, low
power instrumentation ampliﬁer based on chopper modulation (gain = 200) and a
programmable differential current source for biasing the heaters of the sensing struc-
ture. The differential mode component of the dual current source can be digitally tuned
(10-bit resolution) to implement drift-free cancellation of the sensor offset [8]. The
common mode component can be independently controlled by 2 bits in order to vary
the power delivered to the heaters or, equivalently, the sensitivity. In this way, it is
possible to bias the heaters with three different current values being the fourth value
reserved for the power off condition. A simple digital interface allows control of the
current source and instrumentation ampliﬁer parameters.

Device Characterization
After post-processing, the chip was packaged in a ceramic DIP28 case and connected to
a reference gas line by means of a purposely-built PMMA conveyor [6]. With the
application of the conveyor to the chip surface, the sensing structure is included into a
ﬂow channel with a 0.5  0.5 mm2 cross section. The ﬂow channel is connected
through 0.6 mm holes to two stainless steel needles used for gas inlet and outlet. The
reference gas line is equipped with two precision ﬂow controllers (MKS 1179B), one
with a 10 sccm full scale range and the other with 200 sccm full scale range.
The response to a nitrogen ﬂow at room temperature is shown in Fig. 3. The
measurement was performed setting the current of both heaters to around 0.53 mA,
with a small differential component applied to reduce the output offset to the same level

as the output noise. With these settings, the power delivered to each heater was
0.6 mW, while the total current absorption of the chip, including the electronic inter-
face, is 1.26 mA. This, at a supply voltage of 3.3 V, corresponds to a total power
consumption of 4.16 mW. The curve is still monotonic up to ﬂow rates of ±200 sccm
even if, as expected, the sensitivity progressively get worse at high ﬂow rates.
The dependence of the sensitivity on power has been veriﬁed by setting two different
heater current values by means of the electronic interface. The response in ±10 sccm
range is shown in Fig. 4. A clear increase in the device sensitivity at the price of greater
power consumption has been obtained. This demonstrates the possibility of handling the
sensitivity-power trade-off by means of the programmable electronic interface.

Conclusions
A micro-calorimeter with a double heater conﬁguration has been integrated with a
programmable electronic interface into the same chip. The sensing structure has been
fabricated with a commercial CMOS process followed by a simple post-processing
procedure. The electronic interface includes a low-power, low-noise instrumentation
ampliﬁer for the signal reading and a programmable heater driver for the offset com-
pensation and the control of the power delivered to the sensing structure. The
dependence of the device sensitivity on power has been demonstrated by means of
measurements performed in nitrogen at room temperature. The possibility of handling
the power-sensitivity trade-off by means of a programmable interface increases the
ﬂexibility of the proposed device.

Abstract. A monolithic CMOS chip able to count single airborne particles
down to a diameter of 1 µm is presented. This mm-sized ASIC addresses the
growing need for portable and miniaturized solid-state sensors monitoring air
quality to be disseminated in the environment within pervasive wireless sensors
networks. Particle counting and sizing are based on high-resolution capacitive
detection. State-of-the-art performances (65 zF resolution with 40 Hz band-
width) are enabled by the combination on the same chip of interdigitated
microelectrodes (separated by 1 µm distance, matched with the particle size),
and ultra-low-noise electronics connected to them achieving the lowest possible
parasitic input capacitance. Chip design and characterization are illustrated.

Introduction
The relevance of the measurement of airborne particulate matter (PM) does not require
extensive explanation. The adverse effects for the environment, the cultural heritage
and the human health due to high concentrations of PM in the atmosphere have been
abundantly demonstrated. Nevertheless, the strategies proposed and implemented so
far, particularly in urban environments, such as vehicular trafﬁc restrictions, have
proved to be ineffective, mainly because of the complexity of such a multi-scale
problem (involving the spatiotemporal variability of meteorological conditions and of
emission sources and targets, from local street canyons to global levels). Dust sus-
pension in the atmosphere is both due to natural phenomena (erosion, volcanic erup-
tions, and dust storms originated from the Sahara desert, considered the largest source
of airborne dust in the world, producing about 70 millions of tons of dust per year
transported by eastbound winds, 30% of which deposit in the eastern Mediterranean
countries) as well as to anthropogenic sources, signiﬁcantly varying from rural to urban
areas.
Limiting only to the threats for health, they span from pathologies of the
cardio-respiratory system to more subtle cell-level and gene-level interactions, which
are object of wide on-going research [1]. The World Health Organization estimates that

in the year 2000 in Europe the average life expectancy loss due to exposure to PM2.5
was 8.6 months, ranging from 3 months in Finland to 12–36 months in the Po
valley [2]. Other reports account for 3 million deaths worldwide ascribable to PM2.5
[3]. Regardless of the speciﬁc toxicological pathway, the risk due to the exposure to
high concentrations of PM depends on the size and the chemical composition of the
particles. Even particles of inert materials can be the carrier of dangerous pathogens. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, the penetration inside the respiratory tract strongly depends on the
particle diameter (for non-spherical particles, an equivalent aerodynamic diameter is
deﬁned). The distribution of the particles diameter is called granulometric spectrum.
The smaller the diameter, the lower the ﬁltering and the deeper is the penetration and
the higher the risk of diffusion in the body and endocytosis inside the cells.
A broad range of instruments and techniques are currently employed for the
characterization of PM, which can be analyzed either on-line (i.e. in the ﬁeld) and
off-line. The latter are mostly sophisticated laboratory techniques, based on the col-
lection of PM on ﬁlters by means of samplers and impactors, often requiring prelim-
inary sample preparation, such as metallization for electron microscopy or digestion for
chemo-physical assays (such as elemental analysis by means of X-ray ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy [4]). On-line techniques comprise gravimetric
accumulation
and
weighting, absorption of beta rays and laser scattering [5]. The latter, relying on the
size-dependent intensity of the light pulse originated from the scattering of a laser beam
focused on a stream of PM, is the only technique allowing single-particle analysis and
granulometry. Unfortunately, the cost and bulkiness of these instruments prevent a
massive deployment.
In the last years, several paradigm-shifting trends including smartphone-based
participatory sensing [6], aimed at gaining a better insight in such a complex problem
and mostly enabled by the fast development and pervasiveness of consumer-grade
sensors, are emerging also in the environmental ﬁeld. New interesting horizons are
disclosed by wireless sensor networks. As summarized in Fig. 1, different emerging
solutions based on solid-state miniaturized sensors, thus embeddable in low-cost and
compact sensing nodes, but still allowing single-particle resolution, include CMOS

Capacitive Dust Detection
In order to address the challenges described in the previous section, a non-optical
technique based on the combination of microelectrodes and high-resolution capacitive
sensing can be adopted [8]. As illustrated in Fig. 2, when a single particles enters the
electric ﬁeld between a pair of electrodes, the capacitance increases due to its larger
dielectric constant with respect to air (er = 1). In order to maximize the sensitivity, the
capacitor volume should be matched to the single particle size. For a parallel-plate
geometry (facing electrodes of area A and distance d as in Fig. 2a), the capacitance
value can be computed with the well-known expression (neglecting border effects):
C ¼ e0  er  A
d
ð1Þ
where e0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum and er the relative dielectric constant of
the material between the plates. With a spherical particle of radius r inside, the
capacitance variation due to a change of a small volume fraction, can be estimated as:
DC ¼ 4

where Der is the difference between the er. As apparent from Eq. (2), the signal is
increases with the dielectric contrast between the particle and the surrounding medium
and by reducing the distance between the plates. If Der is known, it is also possible to
estimate r from DC, clearly showing the potential for granulometry. Furthermore, the
uncertainty in the estimation of an average er (analogously to the average refractive
index assumed in laser scattering) is mitigated by the fact that r * Der

The advantage of this geometry the homogeneity of the electric ﬁeld, allowing
simple analytical expressions for the design. On the other hand, the major limit is the

risk of clogging when shrinking down d in the micrometric domain. A coplanar
geometry (Fig. 2b) composed by a pair of electrodes (W by L) separated by a distance
G, allows overcoming this risk, at the price of spatially inhomogeneous ﬁeld that
requires of the use of conformal mapping expressions [9] to estimate the capacitance:

Thanks to lithography, micrometric values for G can be easily achieved. A ﬁrst
proof-of-concept that capacitive detection of single micrometric airborne particles has
been demonstrated with gold microelectrodes (G = 4 µm) patterned on glass and
coupled with a low-noise ampliﬁer realized with off-the-shelf discrete components [8].
The minimum resolution of this system was *1 aF, resulting in a minimum detectable
diameter of *7 µm. In order to detect smaller particles, a single-chip solution has been
developed, leveraging the combination of CMOS lithography and minimum stray
capacitance at the input of the ampliﬁer integrated on the same chip.

Design of a CMOS Monolithic PM1 Detector
3.1
Electrodes and Architecture
The design starts from sizing the microelectrodes. The electrodes are fabricated on the
topmost metal layer (metal 4 in the AMS 0.35 µm process here employed) and exposed
to air by opening a window in the nitride passivation the same way used to expose
bonding pads. Interestingly, this approach does not require any additional post pro-
cessing of the chip that can be fabricated in any CMOS foundry and can be used as
received. Under the electrodes no metal is present, in order to reduce the stray
capacitance and the distance from the silicon substrate is 4 µm (Fig. 3a). An inter-
digitated geometry is chosen in order to cover uniformly the detection area. Finite-
element numerical simulations (Fig. 3b) have been employed for optimal sizing of the
electrodes. Targeting PM1, W and G have been set to 1 µm, (slightly larger than the
minimum 0.6 µm allowed by this technology for reliability considerations). With these
dimensions, a sphere of 1 µm diameter (and minimum er = 2) produces a capacitance
change DC = 700 zF.
Having set the electrode width and spacing, the second major choice concerns the
total collection area and its partition into smaller “pixels”. From system level consid-
erations, mostly related to the interfacing with proper ﬂuidics forcing the collection of
PM, the minimum detection area is set to 1 mm2. If this area were covered by a single
couple of interdigitated electrodes, the total sensor capacitance would be 15 pF (with a
stray capacitance to ground of about 3 pF). In these conditions, it would be impossible
to detect the signal due to a single particle, being DC/C = 50 ppb (corresponding to a
dynamic range of 146 dB and an environmental stability better than 50 parts per
billion). In order to reduce the dynamic range, allowing single particle resolution, two
solutions have been adopted:
Single-Chip CMOS Capacitive Sensor for Ubiquitous Dust …

• a differential architecture is chosen, so that only the differential signal is ampliﬁed
by the chain when an unbalance is created by the deposition of a particle on one of
the two combs. In order to avoid the risk that a large particles covering both couples
produces a zero signal, the layout of the electrode has been arranged (Fig. 4)
separating the positively-excited electrodes (+), from the negatively-excited elec-
trodes (−). In one half of the array, the interdigitation is between (+) electrodes and
the common input of the ampliﬁer (virtual ground), while analogously, in the other
half, the serpentine gaps separate (−) electrodes and the ampliﬁer input. The
symmetry is thus maintained and the two halves (CUP and CDW) are separated by a
ground line. Furthermore, the differential conﬁguration allows rejection of common
mode disturbances (including thermal drifts) as well as the noise due to the voltage
generator [10]. The only minor complication implied by this architecture is that the
signal can be either positive or negative, depending on which half of the array the
particle lands.
• the total sensing area has been partitioned in 32 slices of area 500 µm by 70 µm.
Correspondingly, the analog conditioning chains are replicated in 32 parallel
channels. The pixel area corresponds to an input capacitance smaller than 0.5 pF,
suitable for achieving excellent noise performance.
The whole architecture of the readout circuit is shown in Fig. 4. It consists of 32
identical channels including the electrodes and the conditioning chain, which com-
prises the ampliﬁcation stages, the square-wave multiplier (synchronous with the
square-wave stimulation of the electrodes at 100–500 kHz, biased alternatively at VREF
and GND, as commonly performed to read half-bridge differential capacitive sensors
such as in inertial MEMS [11]) and a gm-C low-pass ﬁlter with a selectable bandwidth
(40, 85, 360, 750 Hz) completing the lock-in block.
A sensor bandwidth of 85 Hz per channel is enough to correctly sample single
deposition events considering typical PM concentrations (max *50 particles/liter for

PM10) and sampling ﬂow-rates (*liter/min), with a very low coincidence probability,
giving a total data rate of *3 kSa/s. Given such a relatively slow rate of information to
be processed, the chip is connected to an external ADC with a single output by means
of a 32:1 multiplexer (MUX) controlled by 5 parallel bits. It should be noted that the
low-pass ﬁlter must be placed before the MUX (thus requiring 32 ﬁlters instead of a
single one and, unfortunately, much more silicon area) in order to avoid the long
settling time required by a single ﬁlter which should update its voltage after each
switching of the MUX (and would be limiting the scanning frequency to *1.6 Hz in
the case of the narrowest bandwidth).
3.2
Front-End
Given the capacitive nature of the sensor, the optimal choice for the front-end ampliﬁer
is a transimpedance stage with capacitive feedback (Fig. 5). This allows frequency-
independent gain and minimum noise [12]. The size of the input transistors is set in
order to match the ampliﬁer input capacitance with the sensor capacitance, in order to
achieve minimum noise. The feedback capacitance CF of the ﬁrst stage is set equal to
20 fF. A transistor in feedback operating in sub-threshold regime handles the input DC
leakage current. A second stage with a similar topology and high gain (40) is cascaded
in order to reduce the impact of the gm-C ﬁlter.

In order to compensate the mismatch between the two pairs of electrodes, an
automatic auto-zeroing network has been also implemented. It is composed by a
Digital-to-Capacitance Converter (DCC) and a control logic. The DCC comprises a
ﬁxed compensation capacitor of 4.6 fF connected at the chain input and driven by a 5-bit
resistive DAC featuring a LSB = 150 aF and measured DNL of 15 aF. Finally, a
current-subtracting network allows reducing the noise at low frequency by a factor 4.

Experimental Results
The fabricated prototype is shown in Fig. 6. The total chip area is 2.5 mm by 2.4 mm
and current consumption is 25 mA (at 3.3 V power supply) [13]. The bonding pads are
located on one side, in order to leave the other sides free from bonding wires for easier
coupling the chip with proper ﬂuidics. After the functional tests conﬁrmed the circuit
performances, such as ampliﬁer bandwidth (10 kHz–2 MHz) and noise (65 zF at
40 Hz) are in agreement with the simulations, the chip has been validated with the
real-time deposition of single particles.
Consistently with the previous experiments with the discrete-component setup,
mineral talc (abundant, nontoxic, with an average diameter of 8 µm and er = 2.4) is
employed. Talc powder was suspended in air by means of a properly-driven vibrating
loudspeaker, placed in the same Faraday cage. Before starting the experiments,
microphotographs of the electrodes surface are taken. Then the speaker is activated
and, when a channel displays a capacitance step, the experiment is stopped and another
photograph of that channel is taken, in order to correlate the measured DC with a
microscope image of the deposited particle. By adjusting the concentration of talc
loaded on the loudspeaker and its distance from the detector, it is possible to easily
achieve the condition of single depositions with rates of a few events per minute. Fixed
defects or previously deposited particles act as reference points, useful when comparing
images taken in different moments.

A typical deposition event is shown in Fig. 7: the capacitance recording (sampled
with a temporal resolution better than 100 ms) shows a clear jump of 1 aF, due to the
deposition of a single talc particle with a diameter of about 1.5 µm, extracted from the
microscope image. Despite the uncertainties in the estimation of the equivalent
diameter of non-spherical particles from bidimensional microscope image, good
agreement is observed between the measured jumps, the imaged particles and the
simulation of Fig. 3b. Thanks to the measured noise ﬂoor of 65 zF, a 1 µm particle
(giving a DC = 700 zF for the minimum er) is detected with a SNR >20 dB.

Conclusions
The ﬁrst single-chip CMOS sensor for counting and granulometry of particles in the
20–1 µm range has been presented, illustrating the key design aspects required to
achieve deep sub-attoFarad resolution (and improving by more than two orders of
magnitude what achieved with discrete components).
Conductive particles do not represent a sever risk of shorting thanks to the insu-
lating layer constituted by the thin native aluminum oxide that naturally forms on the
exposed electrodes. Instead, humidity in the form of water droplets can produce large
artifacts and false counts (due to the large er = 80 of water). To prevent this issue,
analogously to laser-scattering instruments, heated probes can be employed, as well as
on-chip heaters or proper layout of the hottest power dissipating areas on chip.
Thanks to the abrupt change in capacitance produced by the PM deposition, slow
drifts (due for instance to temperature drifts which, in any case, are mitigated by the
differential architecture) do not prevent detection on long measuring times.
Finally, for the deployment in the environment in a pervasive and ubiquitous ways,
the micro-system should be completed with:

platform for enhanced low-concentration operation.
2. a surface cleaning system for periodical removal of deposited PM and restoring of
the initial condition for long term operation (based for instance of vibrating

posable cartridges.
The feasibility of the capacitive technique has been demonstrated down to PM1 and
the detector has been optimized from the point of view of noise. Further engineering is
clearly required: power dissipation, electrode geometry, total detection area and
number of channels can be tuned and adapted to the ﬁnal application of the chip,
spanning from ﬁxed urban nodes, to portable dosimeters or even embedment inside
consumer devices such as smartphones.

Abstract. Thermoelectric pastes based on Sb, Bi, Te powders were prepared,
characterized and used to fabricate a ﬂexible thermoelectric generator (TEG) for
wearable harvesting applications. By Finite Element Method (FEM) simula-
tions, the TEG design was ﬁnalized to optimize electrical model and match
typical thermal resistances of human body skin, in order to maximize its ther-
moelectric performance. The thermopile is composed by 450 couples of
p-Sb2Te3 and n-Bi2Te3 deposited by blade coating into vertical parallel cavities
of a patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through-holes layer. Each leg has
diameter of 1.5 mm and height of 2.5 mm. The p-n couples were electrically
connected by printed silver contact. By preliminary functional tests, a Seebeck
coefﬁcient of about 75 µV/K for p-n couple on best conditions was measured.

Introduction
Energy harvesting represents a new promising technology, by means of which fully
exploitation of self-powered wearable devices in practical implementations can be
achieved. The human body heat can be directly converted into electricity by Seebeck
effect to partially or totally supply ultra-low power wearable health monitoring sensors.
TEGs are particularly attractive devices, because compact, robust, lightweight, silent,
maintenance-free and devoid of moving parts. The ﬂexible technology represents a key
for their unobtrusive application in wearable systems, which integrate different mate-
rials and functionalities on the same ﬂexible support. A ﬂexible TEG adapts better to
the natural curvature of the human body, with the advantage of enhancing the heat
transferred from the human body to the device.

Depending on how the thermocouples and substrate are oriented respect to the
direction of the heat ﬂow, transversal (cross-plane) or lateral (in-plane) conﬁguration
can be used to build a thermopile. Several works on ﬂexible TEGs were reported in
literature [1–5]. To maximize the thermal gradient between junctions, an optimized
package is often required to be designed for planar TEGs [6–11].
In this paper, screen printable p-Sb2Te3 and n-Bi2Te3 thermoelectric pastes were
developed and morphologically and electrically characterized. The ﬁlling with silver
particles was also considered, with the aim to increase the ﬁgure of merit of the
materials. The inclusion of metallic nanoparticles into the material matrix introduces
scattering points for phonons, with the result to reduce the thermal conductivity of the
material. The metallic particles can also create favourite pathways for the electron
transport, giving rise to a reduction of the electrical resistivity of the material. The
thermoelectric pastes were used to fabricate a heat sink-free ﬂexible thermoelectric
generator, designed for wearable harvesting applications. Preliminary results of func-
tional characterization of the developed device were presented.

Preparation and Characterization of Thermoelectric Pastes
High-purity Bi, Sb and Te powders from Sigma Aldrich were ball-milled for 24 h
under puriﬁed argon atmosphere, in order to minimize oxygen contamination, for
obtaining stoichiometric Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 powders. The alloy powders were incor-
porated into a solution constituted of 2 wt% polystyrene polymer and alpha-Terpineol
for a reliable printable pastes production. The solid load of p- and n-type pastes was 56
and 60%. The viscosity of the prepared pastes was adjusted by using the solvent, in
order to facilitate the following printing of the slurries. Ag-ﬁlled p- and n-type pastes
were also prepared by adding silver particles (5–6 µm, from Sigma Aldrich) to the
thermoelectric powder with a 2 vol.% load. Figure 1 shows SEM images of as-prepared
pastes, after the milling and mixing of components.
The electrical conductivity of the materials was determined by four-point probe
measurements, performed on 150–200 µm thick screen-printed ﬁlms after hot-pressing
and ﬁring under nitrogen gas ﬂow at 250 °C for 1 h (heating rate of 5 °C min−1), in
order to compact the materials and to remove the solvent in excess. The mean bulk
resistivity of the investigated ﬁlms is reported in Fig. 2. Poor effect of the metal ﬁlling
on the ﬁlm resistivity was noted, with a small decrease of resistivity for Ag ﬁlled
n-alloy and a small increase for the other one. The latter result is explained by the Ag
particles behaviour as metal micro-inclusions embedded between the grain boundaries,
forming new interfaces and defects which give rise to a decrease in the material
electrical conductivity. Nevertheless, the expected Ag inclusion effect is related to
thermal phonon modulation and speciﬁc measurements are ongoing for experimental
conﬁrmation [12].

Design, Fabrication and Electrical Characterization
of TEG
Human body produces heat in response to metabolic and muscular activities. The
thermoregulatory system keeps the body core temperature within a narrow range around
to 37 °C, whereas the heat loss occurs primarily through the skin. Although depending
on the body location and environment conditions, the average heat ﬂow observed on
human open skin under typical indoor conditions is in the range 1–10 mW cm−2, but it
decreases to 4–5 mW cm−2 on areas covered by clothes [13].
In this work, an optimal design of the TEG was obtained by matching the thermal and
electrical properties of the device at contact with the human body. Heat transfer FEM
simulations were performed by using Comsol Multiphysics software, with the aim to
optimize the TEG dimensioning for maximizing the outputelectrical power.A heat ﬂow of
10 mW cm−2 was imposed at the hot side of the TEG (supposing thermal contact with
human body wrist) [13] and natural convection heat transfer with the environment. The
designed TEG is composed by an array of 450 couples of p-n thermoelectric materials,
each leg hasdiameter of 1.5 mm andheight of 2.5 mm and thethermopile occupies an area
of 74  74 mm2. The thermoelectric alloys were deposited by blade coating into vertical
parallel cavities of a patterned PDMS through-holes layer. After printing, hot-pressed
annealing in a conventional tubular oven under nitrogen gas ﬂow at 250 °C for 1 h
(heating rate of 5 °C min−1) was performed to dry and to compact the materials and to
remove the solvent in excess. Silver printed contacts between the p-n legs were optimized
to obtain low contact electrical resistance and good adhesion to the PDMS. The electrical
functional characterization of the device was performed on a prototype of 45 thermo-
couples of p-Sb2Te3 and n-Bi2Te3. The thermal gradient between the hot/cold thermo-
couples junctions was imposed by two aluminium plates, whose temperature was set by
two commercial MCU Peltier controllers, with a temperature set point control of 0.01 °C.
Table 1 shows preliminary experimental data obtained for different temperature difference
between junctions and increasing load connected at the TEG output ends. Figure 3 shows
the fabricated device tested with a custom bench for controlled temperature gradients.

A Seebeck coefﬁcient of about 75 lV/K for the p-n couple was experimentally
measured as a function of the thermal gradient, while silver metal contact resistivity
effects are included into average Seebeck coefﬁcient and will be investigated vs dif-
ferent metal ﬁlms.
Further measurements are in progress in order to evaluate the thermoelectric
properties of the materials, in particular the effect of the silver ﬁlling on the thermal
conductivity of the alloys. Further functional characterization is in progress in order to
test a complete system composed by TEG and an ASIC DC-DC converter, the latter
designed and realized for the power management of the harvested power on 65 nm
technology node. Experimental measurements on pristine and Ag ﬁlled alloys are still
in progress.

Abstract. Recently it has been proven that the magnetic response of magnetic
nano-objects such as nanoparticles, nanobeads, and small cluster of molecules
can be effectively measured by using a Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID) with a small sensitive area. Here, we present a high sensitivity
nanoSQUID based on deep submicrometer Josephson tunnel junctions fabri-
cated by a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) sculpting method. The nanosensor consists
of a niobium superconducting loop (0.4  1.0 lm2) interrupted by two sand-
wich nanojunctions (Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb) having an area of about (300  300)
nm2. An experimental investigation of the main characteristics of such nan-
odevice as a function of the temperature is presented.

Introduction
In the last years, great efforts have been devoted to the development of Supercon-
ducting Quantum Interference devices (SQUIDs) having a ﬂux capture area lower that
1 lm2 [1–9]. In fact, it can be shown that the magnetic moment sensitivity increases by
decreasing the SQUID loop area. Employing the nanofabrication techniques is possible
to fabricate nanoSQUIDs having sensitive enough to explore new stimulating
nanoscience topics such as the study of magnetic nanoparticles, single electron and
molecular magnets. Typically a nanoSQUID consists of a submicron superconducting
loop with two nano-constrictions acting as a Josephson elements (Dayem nanobridges)
[1–4]. However, due to a non-sinusoidal current-phase relationship, a SQUID based on

Dayem bridges exhibits a quite different behavior compared to a standard one based on
Josephson tunnel junctions [10]. For this motivation, in the last years the researchers
are developing nanoSQUID based on tunnel Josephson nano-junctions [1, 8, 9]. In this
paper, we report niobium nanoSQUIDs based on sandwich nano-junctions and their
characterization as a function of the temperature down to 300 mK.

Nanodevice Fabrication
The nanosensors reported here are realized joining two Josephson junctions with a
Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb
SNIS
(Superconductor-Normal
metal-Insulator-Superconductor)
structure, through a nano-superconducting loop. These devices have been fabricated by
means of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) sculpting method, used as lithographic technique
to deﬁne the various elements of the SQUID.
The entire technological process includes a few fabrication steps. At ﬁrst, the
Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb multilayered structure is patterned by optical lithography, deposited by a
radio frequency sputtering system, in a high vacuum chamber, and subsequently deﬁned by
a lift-off procedure. The thickness of the two Niobium electrodes is 250 nm, while the Al
layer is 6 nm thin, with an oxidation exposure of about 3700 Pa s. Afterwards, driving ion
beam on the sputtered structure and opportunely orienteering the sample surface with
respect to the beam trajectory, a multilayered lamella (around 400 nm) is realized through a
consecutive removal ofthematerialinexcess, withthe working surface perpendicular tothe
beamline. A rectangular hole(1  0.4 µm2) was realizedinthecenterofthestrip,resulting
intwo parallellamellaeand deﬁningboththe Josephson junction’s width and the loopofthe
nanoSQUID device. Afterwards the sample is oriented parallel to the beam trajectory and
two side cuts through the two lamellae were performed deﬁning the length of the junctions.
Figure 1 depicts a sketch showing the main fabrication steps and a Scanning Electron
Micrograph (SEM) image of a nanoSQUID. The aspect-ratio (ratio between the height and
the width) referredto the single lamella is about 2, resulting in a three dimensional structure.

Characterization and Performances
The nanoSQUID characterization consisted in measurements of current-voltage char-
acteristics, critical current versus external magnetic ﬁeld and switching current distri-
butions, for different temperature ranging from 9 K to 300 mK. The above
measurements give us the behaviors of the critical current, of the modulation depth and
of the magnetic ﬂux noise as function of the temperature. In Fig. 2a, the current-voltage
characteristics of the nanodevice for two temperatures are reported. The curves do not
exhibit hysteresis for temperature higher than 4 K. It is due to both small critical
current values as well thermal rounding. As expected, by decreasing the temperature,
the bc (hysteresis parameter) value increases and the hysteresis occurs. It becomes more
evident by decreasing the temperature. However, the occurrence of the hysteresis does
not prevent to employ the nanodevice as a high sensitive magnetic sensor [11]. The
critical current as a function of the external magnetic ﬂux (Ic-U) for different tem-
peratures is shown in Fig. 2b. The curves show smooth maxima and cusped-like
minima, nominally signature of a sinusoidal current-phase relationship, typical of
standard SQUIDs [12]. From the ﬁgure is possible to obtain the current responsivity
(IU = ∂Ic/∂Uext) by taking the derivative of the Ic-U curves (Fig. 2b) at the point where
the slope is steepest. The magnetic ﬂux noise of the sensor is given by UN = Ic,N/(∂Ic/
∂Uext) where Ic,N is the measurement error of the critical current which can be obtained
by measuring the switching current distributions (Fig. 3a). The Ic,N can be assumed as
the minimum current variation corresponding to two distinguished distributions. Per-
forming small thermal shifts, we have measured an Ic,N = 100 nA, which results
independent on the temperature in the whole range of temperature investigated. In the
Fig. 3b, the values of UN as a function of the temperature is reported. The noise
decreases by diminishing the temperature assuming a minimum value of about
1.4  10−4 U0 for T = 300 mK.

Conclusions
A fabrication and characterization of a quantum magnetic nanosensor has been
reported. Measurements of current-voltage, critical current-magnetic ﬂux characteris-
tics and switching current distributions from the zero voltage state for different tem-
peratures have been performed. The high critical current modulation depths and the low
intrinsic dissipation exhibited by these devices ensure a suitable sensitivity for
nanoscale applications in the whole temperature range investigated.

Abstract. Density is one of the characteristic properties of a substance, that can
be used to understand other physical and chemical properties. On-line density
sensors are of interest in many applications: the radioactive monitoring in waste
storage tanks, in pipelines for process control in the petrochemical industry, in
the production of chemical reagents, in food processing, in the production of
paper and textiles and so on. In this paper, a piezoelectric density sensor is
proposed and analyzed with FE methods. The idea at the base of the present
work relies in the well-known property of piezoelectric structures to vary their
resonant behavior depending on load conditions. The active element of the
proposed density sensor is a cheap piezoceramic bimorph, widely used in
buzzers and telephone receivers. The bimorph is clamped all around by tight-
ening its border to the edge of a rigid open chamber in which the liquid is
poured; the ﬂexural resonance frequency of the membrane is modiﬁed by the
liquid mass. The liquid volume is the volume of the chamber and therefore the
membrane resonance frequency can be related to the liquid mass density. We
analyze the proposed sensor by a FEM commercial code (ANSYS®) to test the
device capability and to design the chamber in which the liquid is poured, in
order to maximize the device sensitivity; we computed the sensor resonance
frequency by varying the chamber height and for three different values of the
chamber radius. The obtained results demonstrate that best sensitivity is
obtained with smaller values of both height and radius.

Introduction
Density is a physical characteristic of substances related to several other physical,
chemical and mechanical properties [1]. Its measurement is frequently required in many
industrial and research applications, from nuclear to pharmaceutical, from paper to
textiles, from food to petrochemical industries [2, 3].
Resonant density sensors are highly suitable for these applications, due to their high
sensitivity and precision. The sensor proposed in this work is realized by placing a
piezoelectric bimorph, widely used in buzzers and telephones receivers, into a metallic
chamber, hosting a ﬁxed quantity of liquid. The mass of the liquid causes a variation in

the ﬂexural resonance frequency of the piezoelectric bimorph; the volume is ﬁxed and
therefore the frequency variations can be related to the liquid density.
A ﬁnite elements model of the bimorph was realized, including the boundary
conditions associated to the mechanical constraint operated by the metallic structure.
The bimorph material parameters were determined by ﬁtting the measured electrical
impedance of the unconstrained bimorph with the electrical impedance obtained by a
Finite Elements Analysis, performed by using the software ANSYS® (ANSYS,
Canonsburg, PA, USA) [4].
FE Analysis was also used in order to maximize the device sensitivity, varying the
chamber height and radius.

The Bimorph
The active element of the device is a cheap piezoelectric bimorph, composed of a
piezoelectric ceramic glued by means of an epoxy resin to a thin disk of metal, which
acts as both electrode and mechanical support. Since one of the circular surfaces of the
ceramic is bounded to the metal layer, radial resonance of the piezoelectric element is
prevented, obtaining a ﬂexural vibration of the bimorph. The piezoceramic upper
surface is metallized, obtaining the second electrode. In Fig. 1 the three piezoelectric
bimorphs used in the device realization are shown; from left to right, their names are:
CT31, SP18 and SP17 respectively.
In Table 1 the dimensions and the most important characteristics of the three
elements are reported; the resonance frequency is the frequency of the ﬁrst symmetrical
vibration mode of the element, i.e. the resonance of the ﬁrst mode with a nodal circle.

Device FEM Analysis and Optimization
In order to evaluate the device resonance frequency, the three piezoelectric bimorphs
were analyzed by means of the FEM commercial code ANSYS. As mentioned in the
introduction, ANSYS was used, ﬁrst of all, in order to ﬁt the parameters for both the
piezoelectric and metal material. The ﬁtting procedure was performed by means of the
automatic method described in [4]. In Fig. 2, the ﬁtted curve obtained for the uncon-
strained CT31 bimorph is shown.
As can be seen, the result obtained by using the ﬁtted parameters is practically
superimposed to the measured curve.
The sensor design was carried out pursuing the optimization of the height of the
chamber t, in order to maximize the device sensitivity. Finite Elements Analysis was

performed for the constrained bimorph interacting on its upper surface with a cylinder
of water (q = 1000 kg/m3) of height t. The height of the chamber and the thickness of
the liquid under test are equals, because a cap ﬁxes the volume of the liquid to the
volume of the chamber and the metallic structure ﬁxes the area of the base. The
cylinder was meshed with solid elements, in order to have the displacements as degrees
of freedom. The inner surface of the chamber prevents the liquid movements along the
radial coordinate; this was taken into account by setting the radial displacement ur to
zero for all the elements in the outer surface of the cylinder modeling the liquid under
test.
FE modal analysis was performed by varying t from 1 to 10 mm, with steps of
1 mm. Figure 3 shows the ﬁrst resonance frequencies of the sensors equipped with the
three bimorphs, evaluated for each value t of the cylinder height.
As can be seen, the frequency values f decrease by increasing the chamber height
t and f is not linear with t.
In order to determine the t value that maximizes the sensor sensitivity, we com-
puted the sensor electric input impedance amplitude, |Zi|, by means of the ANSYS
harmonic analysis, varying the liquid density from 700 to 1500 kg/m3. Figure 4 shows
the ﬁrst resonance frequency computed for t = 1 mm, i.e., the liquid thickness showing
the maximum slope in Fig. 3.

It can be noticed in Fig. 4 that the dependence of f from the density q is not linear,
so the slopes are not constant; highest slopes are obtained by the devices made with the
SP17 and SP18 bimorphs.
As it is well known, the sensor sensitivity is deﬁned as
S ¼ @y
@x
ð1Þ
where y is the electrical output variable and x the input non-electrical variable. For this
resonant density sensor S becomes
S ¼ @f

since the electrical output is the frequency f and the non-electrical input is the density q.

As it can be seen, the sensors made by the SP17 and SP18 bimorphs show almost
the same sensitivity, while the device equipped with the CT31 bimorph shows worse
results.
In order to complete the device sensitivity analysis, we computed S by ANSYS,
using Eq. (3) and considering t = 2.5 mm and t = 5 mm. The computed sensitivities
are reported in Fig. 6.
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the sensitivity S decreases increasing the liquid height t,
for all the considered bimorphs. Further, the best sensitivity is always obtained by
using the SP17 bimorph, i.e. the device with the smaller diameter. On the other side,

worse results are always obtained by using the bigger bimorph CT31. The obtained
results suggest that better performance in terms of sensitivity are obtained by mini-
mizing the liquid volume in the sensor.

Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper a piezoelectric sensor, able to measure the density of liquids, is proposed
and analyzed with FE methods. The idea at the basis of the device relies in the
well-known property of piezoelectric structures to vary their resonant behavior
depending on load conditions. The active element of the proposed density sensor is a
cheap piezoceramic bimorph, widely used in buzzers and telephone receivers. The
bimorph is clamped all around by tightening its border to the edge of a rigid open
chamber in which the liquid is poured; the ﬂexural resonance frequency of the bimorph
is modiﬁed by the liquid mass. The liquid volume is the volume of the chamber and
therefore the bimorph resonance frequency can be related to the liquid mass density.
We analyzed the proposed sensor by ANSYS to design the chamber in which the liquid
is poured, in order to maximize the device sensitivity; we computed the sensor reso-
nance frequency by varying the chamber height and for three different values of the
chamber radius, obtained by considering three commercially available bimorphs. The
obtained results demonstrate that best sensitivity is obtained by minimizing both the
chamber height and radius.
We are realizing some prototypes in order to experimentally verify the FEM results;
ﬁrst results conﬁrm the device capability.

Abstract. Good temperature sensing properties from room temperature up to
100 °C have been obtained, with high density polyethylene/carbon nanotube
composites even for nanotube concentrations slightly above the percolation
threshold in the case that oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been
used. Due to the low conductivity no Joule heating has to be considered.

Introduction
Carbon nanotube based temperature sensors with electrical readout have been realized
in a great variety of geometries, ranging from very small sensors, based on the tem-
perature dependence of the single nanotube conductivity [1], up to large area sensors,
based on carbon nanotube networks, often embedded into a matrix material. The matrix
material can range from hydrogel [2] to polymers [3], epoxy resins [4, 5] or even
biological cells [6]. The sensing properties depend on the type of carbon nanotubes [7],
their concentration [8] the matrix material [9] and last, but not least, the electrical
contact material and geometry [10]. It should be mentioned that, even for the same type
of nanotube networks, as well positive temperature coefﬁcient (PTC) [11, 12] as
negative temperature coefﬁcient (NTC) [5] behaviour has been observed. Combining
different layers with PTC and NTC effect, zero temperature coefﬁcient (TC) material
can be obtained [13]. Recently, however, it has been shown that nanocomposite
material with near zero TC can also be obtained by a simple one-layer ﬂexible thin ﬁlm
of poly-(amide-imide) highly loaded with carbon black with applications as high
temperature, ﬂexible electrical heater foil without need for temperature compensation
[14]. Applying high voltages to nanocomposite based temperature sensors with
nanoparticle concentrations far above the electrical percolation threshold, Joule heating
has to be taken into account. This effect can be exploited for the realization of current
limiting devices [15]. On the other hand Joule-heating can modify the contact prop-
erties [16] and hence lead to an instability of the sensing characteristics. Therefore it
can be of interest to realize low-conductance temperature sensors, using for example
polymer/CNT composites with CNT concentrations slightly above percolation

threshold. It should be mentioned, that in the case of LLDPE/CNT composites also
high electric ﬁelds during high temperature cycling can lead to conductivity changes of
the composite sample [17]. Here we report on the realization of high density poly-
ethylene (HDPE)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) based temperature sensors
with low conductance and their sensing properties for relatively high temperatures from
room temperature up to 100 °C. In order to favour a more homogeneous nanotube
distribution, oxidized MWCNTs have been used [18].

Experimental
2.1
Sample Preparation
High-density polyethylene (HDPE0390) (Qenos) with an average molecular weight of
Mw * 58.886 g/mol and polydispersity of 5.8 was chosen as matrix. Multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition at CSIRO
(Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organization, Australia) with an
average diameter of 50 nm. Non-functionalized (MWNTs) and functionalized (OXI
MWNTs) carbon nanotubes were used. The functionalization treatment consists of
oxidative treatment in a tube furnace at 500 °C for 1 h, in a 95% nitrogen and 5%
oxygen atmosphere.
Nanocomposites with different nanotube concentrations (between 0.5 and 7 wt%)
in the HDPE matrix (named MWNT/HDPE and OXI MWNT/HDPE) were prepared by
melt mixing in a micro-twin screw extruder (Haake MiniLab Rheomex CTW5).
Thanks to a re-circulating channel, this extruder is capable of cycling the melt, ensuring
a good mixing and making good-quality samples from a limited amount of material.
Each nanocomposite was mixed for 10 min, with a screw speed of 50 rpm. Finally
coplanar gold electrodes have been evaporated on the top of the samples. In this work
we report exclusively on the samples with a CNT concentration of 2.5 wt%.
2.2
Structural Sample Characterization
In order to analyse the dispersion of the ﬁller in the polymeric matrix, the samples were
investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A typical SEM images
of the etched fracture surface of the HDPE/CNT composite with 2.5 wt% oxidized
MWCNTs is shown in Fig. 1. The image demonstrates a homogeneous dispersion of
the carbon nanotubes in the sample.
It should also be mentioned that rheological and electrical measurements have
shown that the HDPE/MWCNT nanocomposites with 2.5 wt% carbon nanotube con-
tent are above the percolation threshold, independently of the surface treatment of the
nanotubes [19].

2.3
Measurement Setup for the Temperature Dependent
Electrical Characterization
The electrical measurements of the HDPE/MWCNT composites, reported in this paper,
have all been performed in a 2-point contact geometry using a Keithley model “2400”
Source-Measurement-Unit (SMU). For the temperature dependent conductivity mea-
surements, the samples have been subjected to slow temperature cycles in an elec-
tronically regulated oven. The oven temperature has been measured using a thin-ﬁlm
thermo-element, positioned on top of the composite sample, to be characterized.
In a previous work it has been shown, that these composite type has a percolation
threshold of the electrical conduction and of the rheological properties between 1 and
2.5 wt% addition of CNTs to the polymer matrix [19, 20]. In the case of highly
conducting samples of this kind of composites (CNT concentrations of 5 and 7 wt%)
have been shown to have a variety of interesting applications for low temperature
sensing [21], current limiting [22] and microwave shielding [23].
Here we investigated the temperature sensing properties above room temperature
up to 100 °C of a low CNT concentration composite sample (2.5 wt% of MWCNTs)
with oxidized nanotubes. It has been shown, that the oxidation lowers the conductivity
by some orders of magnitude as compared to the samples with non-oxidized CNTs.
Often it is found that low-conductivity polymer/CNT composites have rather instable
characteristics due to the low number of percolation paths involved in the conduction.

Results and Discussion
The current-voltage characteristics of the investigated HDPE/CNT composite sample
with 2.5 wt% oxidized MWCNTs (see Fig. 2) is not linear, as shown earlier for the
case of the high conductance samples [5], but after an initial burn-in procedure rather
stable. Typically we found conductivity values of about 1  10−6 S/cm for the samples
with 2.5 wt% of non-oxidized MWCNTs and values of about 5  10−9 S/cm for the
samples with 2.5 wt% of oxidized MWCNTs.
Measuring the sample current and temperature (applied voltage: 100 V) during
multiple temperature cycling above room temperature for a sample with non oxidized
and a sample with oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes with the same concentration
of 2.5 wt% (see Fig. 3), we observed a very unstable characteristics in the case of the
sample with non-oxidized CNTs (Fig. 3a). In particular for this sample during the
cooling period a non-monotonic behaviour, sharp switching and a successively with
increasing cycle number decreasing sensitivity has been found.
For the sample with the oxidized CNTs, however, a rather stable characteristics, as
it can be seen in Fig. 3b, was obtained. Only after the ﬁrst cycle we see a small
decrease of the conductivity, that remains further on stable. In this latter case, during
the cooling periods a monotonic increase of the conductivity with increasing temper-
ature can be observed.
Because the cooling process, however, was very slow, it can be assumed that the
sample is in thermal equilibrium during cooling and hence sample and thermo-element
temperature coincide. A good reproducibility of the current-temperature traces during
cooling for all the cycles is observed. This conﬁrms that not only the current-voltage
characteristics, but also the sample resistance-temperature characteristic has a good
stability.
The same monitoring has been also performed for smaller voltages. In Fig. 4 the
temperature-conductivity relation of the nanocomposite, as measured during the last
cooling cycle has been plotted for different applied voltages of 100 and 10 V. For

comparison, the conductivities have been normalized to their value at 30 °C. We see a
very smooth characteristics for the 100 V curve and a much more noisy characteristics
with slightly different behaviour for the curve, taken at 10 V. This has been most
probably to be attributed to interface problems either between nanotubes and the
metallization or to noisy intertube connections. As it is also seen in the inset of Fig. 4
the characteristics, measured at 100 and 10 V, can be nicely ﬁtted by 3rd order
polynomial ﬁts. The sensitivity of the sample is higher than the one previously reported
for highly conductive epoxy/CNT [5].

Abstract. We present a new CMOS compatible direct conversion terahertz
detector operating at room temperature. The rectenna consists of an integrated
antenna, realized on the surface of the integrated circuit and connected to a
nanometric metallic whisker at one of its edges. The whisker reaches the
semiconductor substrate that constitutes the antenna ground plane. The recti-
fying device can be obtained introducing some simple modiﬁcations of the
charge storage well in conventional CMOS APS devices, making the proposed
solution easy to integrate with existing imaging systems. No need of scaling
toward very scaled and costly technological node is required, since the CMOS
only provides the necessary integrated readout electronics. On-wafer measure-
ments of RF characteristics of the designed rectifying junction are reported and
discussed.

Introduction
THz imaging and spectroscopy applications have a great potential in time-domain
spectroscopy [1], communications [2], security control [3], and biomedical imaging
[4]. For this reason in past decades a great interest of the research community has been
attracted by this region of the electromagnetic spectrum, pushing the microwave and
optical THz devices through a constant progress in the development and the
improvement of detectors in terms of noise equivalent power.
Currently the main interest is the development of low cost, fast, highly sensitive,
compact and room temperature THz detectors. The feasibility of rectifying antennas
(rectennas) for the detection of freely propagating THz radiation has been demonstrated
[5]. The radiative part of these devices is typically formed by an antenna that focuses
the energy of the impinging electromagnetic ﬁeld into a localized spot called active
region, where the rectifying element is placed. The latter produces a continuous current
proportional to the energy of the impinging electromagnetic wave.

Recently we presented a new structure resulting from the integration of a 3D
antenna with widely produced commercial CMOS image detector [6]. The fabrication
process, described in [7], permits to integrate the three dimensional antenna directly on
the surface of the chip, by means of MEMS technology, and ensures a very low
parasitic capacitance, because of the distance between antenna spires and the chip
surface.
A further step of the development of this THz technology is the development of low
cost, fast, highly sensitive, compact and room temperature detectors. The integration in
arrays, in standard CMOS technology, is also mandatory to make exploitable readout
and elaboration electronics capabilities. This paper presents a new approach resulting
from the direct integration of the antenna with a rectifying device obtained by modi-
ﬁcation of commercial CMOS Image Sensors (CMOS ISs) [8].
Nowadays CMOS Image Sensors (CMOS ISs) are predominant electronic devices
in the ﬁeld of digital imaging [9]. The photosensitive element of the pixel is the pinned
photodiode, i.e. a p-n-p structure constituting the charge storage well (SW) dedicated to
the photocurrent integration during the exposure time. In the readout cycle the inte-
grated charge is transferred to a capacitance (“ﬂoating diffusion”, FD) inducing a
voltage difference that is sampled with a transistor in source follower conﬁguration.
The complete charge transfer from photodiode to the ﬂoating diffusion allows the
elimination of the thermal reset noise of the capacitor, referred as kTC noise, by means
of the correlated double sampling. This property in combination with the extremely low
dark current produced by pinned photodiode contributes to the high image quality of
CMOS ISs.
The semiconductor structure implemented in the detector is suitable to perform the
rectiﬁcation of terahertz radiation and to permit accumulation of the rectiﬁed charge
into a storage capacitance and its readout, by means of a technology compatible with
CMOS ISs. The rectifying device with vertical extension of few tenths of nanometers
can be created at the base of the nano-whisker previously described, using one of its
metal edges as part of the electronic device itself.
This work is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the structure of the detector is
presented and its principle of operation is discussed. Section 3 is dedicated to the
presentation of a test structure of the rectifying device and to the characterization of its
performance. The effect of doping distribution due to different implantation processes is
presented.

The Rectifying Device
In Fig. 1 the structure of the rectenna and its connection with the photodetector is
presented. The structure is designed as a combination of an antenna fabricated on the
surface of the chip with a rectifying junction capable to produce the direct conversion
of terahertz electromagnetic ﬁeld into dc current [10]. The necessity to adopt an
approach as close as possible to the existing CMOS photodetectors technology sug-
gests to use a rectifying semiconductor structure realized by a double barrier formed by
the metal of the whisker, chosen with working function similar to an n+-doped semi-
conductor, a properly designed p+-doped surface layer and by the weakly n-doped
46
V. Varlamava et al.

semiconductor of the storage well (SW). Both the SW and the p+-type implanted
surface layer are commonly used in CMOS image detectors respectively to collect the
detected charge and to separate it from the semiconductor surface [9].
In the double barrier, a rectifying effect arises from the different extension of two
depletion regions, very short for the so called “ﬁrst junction”, formed between the
metal and the p+ layer, and much more extended for the so called “second junction”,
formed between the p+-doped layer and the SW. The rectifying effect can be explained
as follows: the electric ﬁeld variations induced by the antenna and focused by the
whisker on the rectifying device, induce variations of voltage drop through the depleted
zones of the two barriers. The majority of the voltage drop occurs through the second
depletion region, mainly extending into n-doped region of the SW, much wider that the
depletion region related to the ﬁrst junction. As a consequence, with positive voltage
applied to the metal, a reduction of the barrier of the second junction occurs, and
electrons preliminarily stored in the SW can be extracted. On the contrary, with neg-
ative voltage, electrons present in the metal layer are injected in a much lower number
into SW, since the barrier of the ﬁrst junction is reduced by a much smaller amount due
to its shorter extension.
Numerical simulations of the semiconductor device were performed by means of
Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD tools using the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model.
This model includes “hot electron” phenomenon that become important in submicron
devices. It is not included in the conventional drift-diffusion model. Moreover, the
hydrodynamic model reproduces the velocity overshoot effects. Simulator engine
allows to perform 2.5D simulations setting to 100 nm  100 nm the area of the metal
contact. As reference, these contact dimensions are achievable by means of 193 nm
ArF DUV photolithography process. The use of a not deeply scaled CMOS technology
is not a limiting factor. In fact, simulations results [11] demonstrate that these
dimensions are suitable to achieve a very high focusing capability of the antenna
coupled to the device, and that a further reduction would not bring to a substantial
advantage.

Since the structure is supposed to be zero-biased, the resulting barrier must be
sufﬁciently low in order to produce an appreciable rectiﬁed current, even under pre-
sumably low voltage variations induced by the THz radiation. Figure 2 reports the 2D
distribution of conduction band energy besides the rectifying device, assuming a p+-
doped region 30 nm thick, with constant doping concentration of 1.0E18 cm−3. The
presence of the barrier along the vertical central cut of the contact is easily observed.
Figure 3 reports the amplitudes of electrons current densities induces by 50 mV
voltage variations applied to the metallic contact, with the p-type substrate connected to
ground, as simulated by TCAD, along the 1D cut shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2.
Curves are obtained for different frequencies between 1 GHz and 1 THz.

For all curves, one can note a relevant frequency dependence of the electrons
current density at the contact (i.e. calculated at distance zero from the metal/p-Si
interface) and inside the SW. In particular, electrons current density at the contact is
higher at higher frequencies, as expected due to the presence of the barrier capacitance
in series to the contact. At each simulated frequency, the electrons current density is
lower inside the SW that at the contact, that is the effect of the current redistributing
over a larger section. A saturation effect is evident over 500 GHz; it can be attributed to
the resistance of the SW that limits the current at higher frequencies. Furthermore, over
500 GHz we observe the thinning of the depletion layer at the junction, caused by the
lack of the charge fed to the barrier depletion layer. With the decrease of the frequency
the electrons current inside the SW drops dramatically, due to the effect of the dis-
tributed capacitance that SW forms with the surrounding substrate.
It is important to notice that the electrons current across the barrier remains
unchanged up to around 500 GHz, and with greater evidence at 1 THz, where the
current start decreasing. In these cases, semi-periods of the excitation signal equal to,
respectively, 1 and 0.5 ps, become shorter than the time of ﬂight of electrons through
the barrier [12].
The rectiﬁcation capability of the structure is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where a
magniﬁcation of simulated curves of electrons current density absolute values beside
the junction barrier is presented. Reported values are evaluated at the end of two linear
voltage ramps, the positive one going between 0 V and 50 mV (continuous line) and
the negative one going between 0 and −50 mV (dashed line). Different colors represent
voltage ramp rise time of 1 ns, 100, 10 and 1 ps. All curves in Fig. 4 are simulated with
SW contacted to ground by means of an ohmic contact, so that there is no current drop
effect at low frequencies due to SW capacitance.

One can note that the residual electrons current density through the barrier is many
orders of magnitude below the absolute current density injected at the contact; nev-
ertheless, the difference between values of this conduction current density calculated
under positive and negative solicitation ramps is of up to about 50%. The rectiﬁcation
effect of the device is supposed to be due to this difference.
In Fig. 4, an increase the rectiﬁed current can be observed as the voltage ramp rise
time changes from 1 ns to 10 ps. This increment represents an effective improvement
of the rectifying capability, which can be explained as due to the decrease of the
depletion layer at higher values of voltage ramp rates, i.e. at higher frequencies.
Curves derived for 1 ps rise time show the decrease of electrons current density
beside the rectiﬁcation region. This phenomenon can be explained observing that 1 ps
rise time is shorter than the time of ﬂight of electrons through the barrier. The resulting
drop of the number of electrons crossing the barrier within the ramp time produces the
drop of the current.

On-Wafer Measurements
We developed a test structure to verify the rectiﬁcation properties of the detector. The
test structure, reported in Fig. 5, does not include the antenna and is designed for tests
at frequencies well below THz range in order to be handled with standard microwave
probes and available instrumentation. The signal is applied by a radio frequency
generator to emulate the excitation coming from the receiving antenna. This latter
measurement setup choice may appear somewhat arbitrary, however in the following
we show that with proper modelling it is still possible to provide expected results at
THz range combining RF range measurements and numerical simulations.
The test structure is realized with minor changes from a standard conﬁguration of a
CMOS commercial photodetector using the Aptina/ON Semiconductor 0.15 µm

technology node. The additional technological step requested for the pixel reconﬁgu-
ration for THz range operation consists in an extra p-type doping implantation below
the whisker, forming the p+-Si layer described in the previous section. The main effect
of this step is the barrier height and shape trimming, the phenomenon that hardly affects
the rectifying capability of the device. Such implantation can be performed through a
properly designed window through which also the metal used for the realization of
contact, titanium (Ti), is further deposited. Metal deposition is performed to obtain a
via hole between the pad metallization and the rectifying contact. Figure 6 reports
layout and SEM cross-section image of the detector, with the SW, metal whisker,
rectiﬁer and the TX transistor. Labels TX and FD denote, respectively, the gate and the
ﬂoating diffusion nodes of transfer gate transistor included in the standard photo
detector conﬁguration.
Finally, at top metallization level, a planar pattern with three pads is realized with
sizing suitable to be contacted by standard RF microprobes. In particular, Microtech
Cascade ACP-150 GSG microprobes were used during measurements. The central pad
(labeled RF in Fig. 5) is connected to the rectifying contact to be tested, and the two
external pads (labeled GND in Fig. 5) are electrically connected to the p+-Si layer and
to the doped substrate surrounding the SW, by means of via holes and ohmic contacts.
The equivalent circuit of the measurement setup is shown in Fig. 7. The gate
voltage on TX gate node, VTX, switches the transistor between two states: in TX OFF
state the SW is isolated from FD node, permitting the accumulation of the rectiﬁed
charge, meanwhile in TX ON state the transfer of the accumulated charge from SW to
the readout node is performed. Capacitances of FD and of SW are denoted as CFD and
CSW, respectively. A Keithley 617 pico-ammeter, shown by the circled capital A, is
connected to FD through a low pass ﬁlter, represented by the inductance LLPF con-
nected in series.
In order to test experimentally the device rectiﬁcation capability and to evaluate the
rectiﬁcation efﬁciency, we performed measurement on two samples with different
parameters of the p-type doping implantation, as reported in Table 1. In particular,
sample 4E had a higher dose and lower energy with respect to sample 1C. All mea-
surements reported in the following are performed at test frequency of 40 GHz.

Figure 8 reports the rectiﬁed current measured by pico-ammeter versus the RF
power applied to the signal pad, for 4E and 1C devices. The voltage level at TX gate
node was 4 V for both curves, ensuring TX ON state.
A linear approximation of curves in Fig. 8 can be used to evaluate the detector
efﬁciency. We approximate as linear the relationship between the RF power expressed
in decibel-milliwatts, PdBm, and ten times the logarithm of the current, IdBA, as given by

where (PdBm,0, IdBA,0) is an arbitrary chosen reference point on (PdBm, IdBA) curve, and
the coefﬁcient k can be calculated from geometrical regression of measured data.

Recalling that the plot is logarithmic, the different k means a different exponential
coefﬁcient in the nonlinear relationship rectiﬁed current —RF power. This parameter
allows to account the actual modulation of the barrier under the rectiﬁcation process.
From the sample 4E we obtained k = 1.05, while for the sample 1C the coefﬁcient
resulted k = 0.87. This effect can be explained as due to the steeper and superﬁcial
distribution of the superﬁcial dopant in sample 4E if compared to the sample 1C. As
highlighted by TCAD process simulations, the higher dose and the lower energy of the
implantation process lead to the rectifying device with higher but more asymmetric
double barrier. As the rectiﬁcation efﬁciency is strongly affected by the asymmetry
degree of the barrier, the obtained rectiﬁed current is higher for the sample 4E, although
its greater barrier height. At large RF power values, the deformation of the barrier
partially compensates the higher current expected in the lower barrier of the sample 1C.
Nevertheless, the values of sensitivity calculated for the two samples are comparable
due to different k values.
Numerical simulations the semiconductor device reported in Fig. 3 can be used
jointly with measurements in Fig. 8 to evaluate the noise equivalent power (NEP) of
the sensor.
From the measurements, we may extract the 40 GHz voltage applied to the junction
by the RF power generator. For the sake the test structure S11 measurement, obtained
with an input power of −10 dBm and reported in Fig. 9, is used.
The measure indicates the good matching of the structure at frequencies between 10
and 40 GHz, meaning that the real part of the test structure is nearly 50 X, mostly due
to the series resistance of the semiconductor structure. S11 has a cutoff frequency of
fH = 1 GHz, thus at 40 GHz most of the voltage drops onto the resistance. The voltage
applied to the pad and to the rectifying structure can be approximated by:

where VJ is the voltage at the rectifying junction, P is the applied RF power, RS is the
series resistance of the test structure. This expression takes into account its one-pole
behaviour with respect to the voltage imposed by the RF voltage generator.
From measurements reported in Fig. 8 we extrapolate that the RF power at 40 GHz
necessary to generate a rectiﬁed current equal to the noise current. The latter, deﬁned as
a mean square value of noise measure in photodetector, was measured to be of 5 el/s,
value comparable with data reported in literature [9]. For sample 4E, we ﬁnd a noise
equivalent RF power of −60 dBm. Accordingly to (2), this power corresponds to a
voltage drop at the rectifying junction of 7.9 lV.
The rectiﬁed current depends dramatically on the shape and the height of the
barrier. The nonlinearity parameters were thus obtained directly from the measure-
ments. Besides that, from the simulation we extract the frequency behavior in order to
extend the results at 1 THz. We note that simulations reported in Fig. 4 clearly indicate
that, under the same amplitude of voltage applied to the junction, the rectiﬁed current
has the same value for a ramp of 25 ps (as interpolation from the 10 and 100 ps curves)
and for the ramp of 1 ps. Thus we can extend at 500 GHz, the value of 7.9 lV as the
voltage at the junction necessary to equate the noise. We can now use the simulation of
Fig. 3 to scale down the value of the density of current at the contact at this frequency.
From the amplitude of 167 A/cm2, obtained under 50 mV solicitation, scaled to the
voltage value just found of 7.9 lV, we obtain a density of current 260E−3 A/cm2, that
corresponds to an electric ﬁeld amplitude of 0.1 V/cm. The latter quantity is the electric
ﬁeld value that must be concentrated by the antenna and the whisker onto the rectifying
junction.
We can now recall that the ﬁeld enhancement capability of the 3D antenna coupled
to the device, FE, was shown to be at least a value of 40,000 [11]. Simulations reported
in [11] were performed in conditions of the ideal load, i.e. the whisker with radius of
50 nm distant 10 nm from a ground plane; such structure has an equivalent impedance
different from that shown by the actual semiconductor device. The impedance of the
designed rectiﬁer can be evaluated from simulation reported in Fig. 3, as the ratio of
applied voltage and current obtained with contact area equal to the whisker base area in
the test structure, 100 nm  100 nm. The high impedance of the device reduces the FE
to a rather low value of 52. The combination of this result with the value of the electric
ﬁeld that must be induced into the junction to produce equivalent current allows the
calculation of the external electric ﬁeld reaching the antenna, and thus of the ﬁnal value
of the NEP500 GHz ¼ 2:7 pW=

Conclusions
In this work, a new THz detector for direct conversion operating at room temperature
and compatible with existing CMOS ISs is presented and experimentally evaluated. We
demonstrate that a modiﬁcation of a limited region of the surface of the CMOS ISs
pixel, placed in contact with the metallic antenna pad, provides an efﬁcient rectifying
device in THz range. The antenna and the rectifying device, i.e. the rectenna structure,
exposed to electromagnetic radiation gives rise to charge injection into the storage well
of APS device that is evaluated by the readout electronics. We present measurements at
a frequency of 40 GHz demonstrating the effectiveness of the rectifying device and
conﬁrming the rectiﬁcation effect due to the formation of a double barrier just below
the antenna whisker. Experimental results supported by 2D numerical TCAD simu-
lations permit an evaluation of NEP at 1 THz. The experimental investigation at 1 THz
of the device with the integrated antenna is the target of the future work.

Abstract. The development of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensor,
operating at room temperature (RT), is a challenge for the research community.
In this framework, we present a device based on a graphene-like (GL) material
suitably tested as sensing layer for the ethanol detection. GL material was
obtained through a two steps oxidation/reduction method starting from a
nanostructured carbon black. GL material combines a defect-free basal plane
graphenic structure with the presence of oxygen functional groups, mainly
carboxylic, located on the layer edges. A GL-based device was realized and
investigated for the detection of ethanol. The experiments were performed under
atmospheric pressure, in a dry air and at RT. Results showed that GL material is
a promising candidate for the detection of low concentration of ethanol at RT.

Introduction
Metal-oxide semiconductors are widely used as sensing layers for the detection of
VOCs, due to their high sensitivity, fast response, recovery and stability. However, one
major drawback of this type of sensors is the high temperatures required for their
operation (200–450 °C) [1–3] and the consequent high power consumption. Although
the introduction of nanocrystals and nanowires have improved the sensing perfor-
mances and lowered the operating temperatures of metal oxides based sensors [4–6] in
the last years, also other materials have been considered for the development of new gas
sensors. Carbon-based nanomaterials proved to be promising for this scope due to their
intrinsic electrical properties, high surface area, high chemical and thermal stability and
functionalization capability [7]. Among the large family of carbon-based nanomaterials,
graphene and graphene related materials (GRMs) in the last years have been explored
for the detection of a widespread range of chemicals, including VOCs [8].

Graphene-like (GL) layers are carbon-based nanomaterials obtained through a two
steps oxidation/reduction method starting from a carbon black (CB) [9, 10], consisting
in small graphenic ﬂakes (about four graphenic layers of thickness) decorated at the
layer edge with oxygen functional groups (mainly carboxylic/carbonylic). Differently
from graphite oxide (GO), in GL material the basal planes of the graphitic network are
preserved from defect, which represents a clear advantage for the conductivity and the
electronic properties. GL layers in aqueous suspension are a versatile material as
testiﬁed by its use in the preparation of a large variety of hybrid materials. When
intercalated in insulating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), GL layers allow to
produce composites with tunable electrical conductivity [11]; when combined with
Eumelanin by a copolymerization approach, GL layers produced a biocompatible
interface with conductive and adhesive properties very promising for biosensoristic
applications [12] and when covered by TiO2-nanoparticles by a co-precipitation
strategy GL layers produced a material with improved photocatalytic activities [13].
In this framework, we have realized a prototypal chemiresistive sensing device for
ethanol detection based on GL ﬁlm. The device was tested under atmospheric pressure,
in dry air and at RT. The results showed that GL material is a promising candidate for
the detection of low concentration of ethanol at RT.

Experimental
2.1
Realization of the Prototypal Chemiresistive Sensing Device
Analytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received.
CB (furnace black, N110 type, 15–20 nm primary particle diameter, speciﬁc BET area
139 m2/g) was obtained by Sid Richardson Carbon Co.
GL layers in aqueous suspension were produced from a nanostructured CB
following a synthetic approach that consists in an oxidation step followed by a
chemical reduction with hydrazine. A detailed description of the synthetic procedure is
reported elsewhere [9, 10]. Brieﬂy: 500 mg of CB were oxidized for 90 h with 10 mL
of HNO3 (67 wt%) at 100 °C under reﬂux and stirring. The oxidized material was
recovered by centrifugation and washed many times with distilled water in order to
remove any acid traces. After the oxidation step 60 mg of oxidized material were
dispersed in 60 mL of distilled water and treated with 1.35 mL of hydrazine hydrate
(50%) for 24 h at 100 °C under reﬂux. The excess of hydrazine was neutralized with
nitric acid (4 M) allowing the precipitation of a black solid (GL layers). GL layers were
recovered by centrifugation and washed two times with distilled water in order to
remove salts and acid traces. The GL layers were stored as aqueous suspension at
1 mg/L of concentration and pH 3.7.
GL ﬁlm was obtained by drop-casting the GL water dispersion onto transducers and
dried at RT, realizing a prototypal chemiresistive device. The transducers employed for
the electrical and sensing characterization of the GL ﬁlms, have 5 pairs of gold
interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) electrodeposited onto rough alumina substrate: each
electrode ﬁnger is 350 lm wide and 4650 lm long. The spacing between ﬁngers is
350 lm.

Characterization Equipment
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed in a ultra-high vacuum
chamber (base pressure of 1  10–10 mbar) equipped with a Specs Phoibos 150
electron analyzer, using Al Ka (photon energy: 1486.6 eV) X- ray source.
GL aqueous suspensions (100 lL of a 1 mg/mL GL suspension) were drop-casted
onto the device, allowed to dry in air at ambient temperature and analyzed by atomic
force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images were acquired on a XE100 Park instrument
operating in noncontact mode (amplitude modulation, silicon nitride cantilever from
Nanosensor) at room temperature and in ambient conditions.
The ethanol for gas-sensing characterizations comes from certiﬁed cylinder con-
taining calibrated vapour balanced in dry air at 100 ppm (Ossi gas srl). The gas ﬂow
mixing rates were precisely and rapidly manipulated using computer mass ﬂow con-
trollers (MKS) and electro-pneumatic valves. A bias voltage ﬁxed at 1 V was applied
to the electrodes with a Precision Power Supply TTi QL355T and the conductance
values were registered using a high resolution picoammeter Keithley 6485.
The gas-sensing performances of the sensing device were characterized towards
ethanol under atmospheric conditions (24 ± 2 °C and 1.00 ± 0.05 bar) in a sealed
stainless steel chamber. A constant ﬂux of synthetic dry air of 500 sccm as gas carrier
was ﬂowed and mix with the desired concentration of ethanol. After 30 min in dry air
(baseline), the sensing device was exposed to the analyte concentration for 30 min and
the air ﬂux was then restored for 60 min. The percentage response (S) is deﬁned as the
maximum of the conductance variation reached by the device during the analyte
exposure that is [|G −G0|/G0]  100, where G and G0 are the conductance recorded
during analyte exposure and baseline acquisition steps, respectively.

Results and Discussion
GL ﬁlm was prepared as described in the Experimental section. A detailed charac-
terization of the material was reported in [9, 10] and here summarized for sake of
clarity. The synthesis procedure allow high yields (55 wt% of recovery) of GL layers
with a multi-layered graphenic structure (about four layers) characterized by a pre-
served graphitic network, i.e. with functionalization only at the borders of the gra-
phenic layers [9, 10]. The H/C atomic ratio is 0.32 and the O/C atomic ratio: 0.56. The
functionalization consists of residual oxygen functional groups, mainly carboxylic
groups (pKa 3.4, number of sites 900 mmol/g). Lactones and anhydrides are also
present (pKa 5.5, number of sites 240 mmol/g). The oxygen functional groups allow
establishing a zeta potential around −30 mV at pH 2 and around −45 mV at pH 12
[10].
Characterization by X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) on powders and
imaging by Atomic Force Microscopy are reported in the following.
XPS spectrum is reported in Fig. 1 along with its deconvolution into Gaussian
components after Shirley background subtraction using a home-made software.

four components located at 284.5 eV (carbon involved in C=C and C–H bonding),
286 eV (C–OH), 287.5 eV (C=O), 289 eV (COOH).
AFM morphological characterization on a ﬁlm obtained on mica substrate by
drying in air a drop-casted GL layers suspension (pH 3.7, 1 mg/mL) provided an
estimation of the surface roughness, as shown in Fig. 2.
AFM topographic image shows a ﬂat morphology over a large area (5  5 lm).
The roughness, estimated by the scan proﬁle (Fig. 2b) is about 0.1 nm peak to peak
over a distance of 3 lm. This value clearly indicate ﬂatness at atomic level, charac-
teristic of the GL layers allowed to self-assembly on a ﬂat surface from suspension at
pH 3.7 [10].
I–V measurements performed on GL ﬁlm showed linear behavior (Fig. 3a), which
implies an Ohmic contact between GL sheets and gold electrodes. Figure 3b displays
the dynamic response of the device exposed to 50 ppm of ethanol at RT in dry air. GL
material is responsive to ethanol, exhibiting a conductance variation equal to 3%
(Fig. 3b). This result is even more astonishing when compared to the detection limits of
other devices operating at RT reported in the literature [15], including pristine graphene
which results as totally insensitive to ethanol.
Employing the mathematical model shown in our previous work [16], it is possible
calibrate the device correlating directly the time derivative of the device conductance to
the interacting analyte concentration. In particular, deﬁning the reactivity as the
maximum of the device conductance rate, it is possible to correlate the reactivity to
the analyte concentration. Besides, reaction time is here deﬁned as the time in which
the aforementioned maximum of the conductance rate is reached; by extension, the
reaction time can be regarded as the time taken by the device to detect a given analyte
concentration. The exposure to several sequential steps at different analyte concen-
trations (black solid squares in Fig. 4), ranging from 0 ppm down to 100 ppm, dis-
closes a linear correlation between the device reactivity and the analyte concentration.

The black solid squares represent the data of the maxima of the device conductance
rate corresponding to different concentrations. The red straight line represents the best
ﬁt for the collected data. Taking into account the error bars, it can be evaluated that the
limit of detection (LOD) for this device is around 10 ppm.
The device reaction time shows a non-linear relation with the analyte concentration
(blue squares in Fig. 4). For concentrations in the range 40–100 ppm the device
responds in about 40 s while in the low concentration range, i.e. from 10 to 20 ppm, a
clear increase of the reaction time is observed. Nevertheless, the device takes less than
60 s to detect 20 ppm of ethanol.

Conclusions
We have realized a prototypal chemiresistive sensing device for ethanol detection based
on GL ﬁlm obtained by the self-assembly of GL layers, a carbon-based nanomaterial
consisting in small graphenic ﬂakes obtained through a two steps oxidation/reduction
method starting from a nanostructured carbon black. The prototypal device was tested
under atmospheric pressure, in dry air and at RT and exhibiting a conductance variation
equal to 3% to low ethanol concentration (50 ppm). The LOD results around 10 ppm.
This result showed that GL material is a promising candidate for the detection of low

Abstract. Gas sensors based on mixtures of iron oxides nanoparticles
(NPs) modiﬁed with Pd NPs at the different NPs Pd: Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 proportions
were prepared and characterized. Nanoparticles diameter was 6–7 nm. NPs ﬁlms
were deposited from the mixtures of Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 and Pd NPs colloidal
solutions by modiﬁed Langmuir-Schaeffer technique onto alumina substrates.
Samples were composed from 4 Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NP monolayers (MLs). Sensors
were tested toward acetone vapors and NO2 at concentration range of 5–200 and
0.5–12 ppm respectively in dry air, and at different working temperatures.
Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 sensors showed p-type gas response, higher conduc-
tance and higher conduction activation energies compared to pure Fe3O4/
c-Fe2O3 sensor that gives n-type gas response. Results were tentatively
explained in terms of surface interactions with oxidizing and reducing species,
and Nearest Neighbor Hopping conduction model (NNH).

Introduction
Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) have been emerged as signiﬁcant nanomaterials mainly
due to its superparamagnetic properties and their extensive range of application in
various ﬁelds [1]. A less used application of iron oxides is chemiresistive gas sensors,
i.e. sensors based on resistance modulation of semiconducting oxides by chemical
adsorbed gas species [2–4]. Several studies on a-Fe2O3 (hematite), c-Fe2O3 (maghe-
mite) and Fe3O4 (magnetite) phases, indicated suitable sensing characteristics towards
LPG, carbon monoxide, ethanol and acetone supporting their employment in gas
sensing applications [5–17].

In this work we studied the Pd-doping of Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticle (NP) multi-
layers and we tested their gas sensing properties towards two reference species, i.e.
nitrogen dioxide (NO2, oxidizing gas) and acetone (C3H6O, a reducing volatile organic
compounds. We prepared Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles by high-temperature
decomposition of organic precursors. We preferred a simple method of the deposition
of sensing nanoparticle mono- or multilayers from the mixture of two colloid solutions
of c-Fe2O3 and Pd nanoparticles covered by the similar surfactant by modiﬁed
Langmuir-Schaeffer technique [4, 5, 18].
2
Materials and Methods
Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs in the form of colloidal solution with nanoparticles size of
6.4 ± 0.6 nm were synthesized by high-temperature solution phase reaction in dife-
nylether from Fe acetylacetonate with 1.2 hexadekandiol as reducing agent. NPs are
covered by a surfactant capping approx. 1 nm thick composed by oleic acid and oleyl
amine. Pd NPs (6–7 nm sized) capped with oleyl amine surfactant were purchased.
Three different mixtures of the Pd-NPs with the Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs at different Pd:
(Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3) NPs proportions were prepared. By repeating four times the LS
deposition, 4 NPs-based monolayers (MLs) from the different prepared NPs solutions
were deposited on alumina sensor substrates in order to get compact ﬁlms with suitable
thicknesses.
Four samples at different Pd:100 Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles proportions were
prepared; an undoped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 sensor was prepared as reference. A list of the as
prepared gas sensor samples is shown in the table of Fig. 1. The alumina substrates
(2  2 mm2) were equipped by Ti (20 nm)/Pt (200 nm) comb electrodes to read the
measuring current (under constant polarization) and by integrated Ti/Pt heater.
Before testing the sensor structures, the insulating surfactant capping all the
nanoparticles was removed in ultraviolet (UV) reactor by ozone generating mercury
lamp (hm = 4.9 and 6.6 eV) for 40 min; the irradiation power was 2 mW/cm2. The
samples were processed by 3 day heating at 500 °C in dry air to stabilize them and to
oxidize some initial Fe3O4 NP component to Fe2O3. This oxidation was conﬁrmed by
XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) analysis [18]. Coalescence of NPs was
not observed.
The sensor operating temperature T was varied from 200 to 500 °C at the 50 °C
step. The gas sensing tests were carried out by a test bench for gas sensors calibration
equipped with a gas mixing station and instrumentation for electrical characterization.
The current response of NPs-based sensors was measured by electrometer at the
voltage of 1 V. Acetone and NO2 were mixed with dry air at concentrations ranges of
5–200 and 0.5–12 ppm respectively.

Results
SEM observations (and EDS spectra) of all the Pd-doped sensors were carried out after
the gas sensing tests. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the SEM image of the L4Fe + Fe1:
Pd10 sensor; the micrograph evidences the morphology of the ﬁlm, following the
rough topography of the alumina substrate. The ﬁlm shows the presence of spherical
details, with size of few tens of nm, very likely corresponding to nanoparticles
agglomerate; these features are peculiar of all the observed sensors.
The main experimental evidence concerning gas sensing results is that undoped
Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) based sensors showed an n-type electrical con-
duction, on the contrary the Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) based sen-
sors showed a p-type electrical conduction. As a consequence, n-type responses for the
undoped iron oxides NPs-based sensors, and p-type responses for the Pd-doped iron
oxides NPs-based sensors to the considered chemical species were registered. In order
to compare the relative responses of the different sensors, we deﬁned the n-type and
p-type gas response towards NO2 (oxidizing species) and acetone (reducing species) as
follows:

so that it’s always higher than unit; where GAir and GOx or GRed are the electrical
conductance G in air and under exposure to oxidizing and reducing species respectively
(at constant polarization).
The gas sensing experiments were carried out at different working temperatures in
order to ﬁnd out the optimum operating temperature for the speciﬁc gas detection.
The gas responses (as deﬁned above) of a typical set of undoped and Pd-doped
Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs-based sensors towards 4 ppm NO2 and 40 ppm acetone in dry air
at three different working temperatures is reported in Table 1. For each type of sensing
material three equivalent samples were tested and the responses were found comparable
(within 10%) within the experimental errors.
The electrical conductance variation of the prepared sensors upon exposure to dif-
ferent concentrations of NO2 (0.5–12 ppm) in dry air followed by recovering in air after
each gas exposure at an operating temperature of 350 °C is shown in Fig. 2. The n-type
gas response of the undoped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs-based sensors is 2 order of magnitude
higher than the p-type responses of the Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs-based sensors.
Among the Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs based sensors, the sensor L4Fe: Pd1 has a
response a little bit higher than the others, but we can consider the p-type responses
roughly comparable among them. At 350 °C there is the highest response, whereas at
400 °C there is a higher speed of response and recovery for the undoped sensor L4Fe.
The periods of exposure to gas and recovery in air were 30 and 60 min respectively.
In order to compare the gas sensing properties at the same temperature, in Fig. 3 we
report the conductance variation of a typical set of undoped and Pd-doped Fe3O4/
c-Fe2O3 NPs-based sensors to increasing acetone concentrations (5–200 ppm) in dry
air at 350 °C. All the NPs-based iron oxides sensors (undoped and Pd-doped) showed
appreciable responses in the explored range of acetone concentration (5–200 ppm) in
dry air.

It can be observed that after NO2 injection electrical conductance decreases for the
Pd-undoped sensor (L4 Fe), whereas it increases in Pd-doped sensors (i.e. L4 Fe:Pd1, L4
1Fe:Pd10, L4 Fe+ Fe1:Pd10). Similarly, after acetone vapours injection electrical con-
ductance increases for the Pd-undoped sensor (L4 Fe), whereas it decreases in Pd-doped
sensors(i.e.L4Fe:Pd1,L41Fe:Pd10,L4Fe+Fe1:Pd10).Moreover,itcanbeobservedthat

the Pd-doped sensorsaremuch more conductivethan undoped sensor.The conductance G
increases also at increasing the amount of Pd NPs (GL4Fe < GL4Fe:Pd1 < GL41Fe:Pd10
< GL4Fe+Fe1:Pd10) leading to suppose a different electrical conduction regime.
The conductivity is dominated by these spin-polarized charge carriers that may
contribute to conduction by hopping process by Nearest Neighbor Hopping
(NNH) (Fig. 4).

Conclusion
In this work Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) by high-temperature decomposition of
organic precursors were synthetized and mixed with Pd nanoparticles. The prepared
NPs solutions were deposited more times by Langmuir-Schaeffer technique in order to
get compact multilayered ﬁlms. The LS ﬁlms were deposited onto alumina substrates
equipped with Pt interdigital electrodes and integrated heater to test them as a
chemiresistor type gas sensors. The gas sensing tests towards NO2 and acetone showed
different sensing behaviour for undoped and Pd-doped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs-based
sensors, i.e. n-type response for the undoped sensors and p-type response for the
Pd-doped sensors. In particular, the undoped Fe3O4/c-Fe2O3 NPs based sensor (n-type
response) resulted more efﬁcient compared to the Pd-doped sensors to detect NO2
(p-type response), whereas comparable responses toward acetone were obtained with
undoped and Pd-doped NPs-based sensors.
The different type of response (n-type and p-type) of the sensing materials may be
due to different electrical conduction mechanisms. The electrical transport in iron
oxides was proposed as open issue to discussion to the scientiﬁc community. We
proposed that the conductivity is dominated by spin-polarized charge carriers that may
contribute to conduction by hopping process by Nearest Neighbor Hopping (NNH).

Abstract. Multianalyte biosensor patch based on polymeric microneedles
(MNs) have been fabricated by photolithography of poly (ethylene glycol)
diacrylate (PEGDA) and have been dynamically characterized by means of
quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical measurements. The resulting
ﬂexible device acts as multianalyte working electrodes detecting glucose and
lactic acid into interstitial liquid by means of redox reaction with glucose oxi-
dase (GOx) and lactose oxidase (LOx) enzymes. Sensitivities of the order of
nA mM−1 in the mM range are revealed in both case, after ﬁve minutes of
swelling time and ten second of interaction.

Introduction
In the age of smart devices, the integration of health sensor follows the general attention
on nutrition and sport activity, indicated as primary prevention means of diseases as
obesity, diabetes as well as cancer. However, the low invasiveness constraint of such
devices inhibits the monitoring of substances as glucose, although diabetes is one of the
most widespread ailments. Commercial electrochemical glucose sensor are based on the
redox reaction of glucose oxidase (GOx) with glucose, that creates a charge transfer,
resulting in a current proportional to the glucose concentration in blood [1]. Another
intermediate key in anaerobic glycolytic pathway metabolism is the lactate or lactic acid,
detectable by means of the redox reaction with lactose oxidase (LOx). The determination
of lactate concentration in blood is essential in sport medicine where lactate concentration
in blood indicate the training activity [2]. This kind of blood biosensor needs a macro-
scopic needle or cutter wherewith injure a ﬁnger till the leakage of a blood droplet.
Microneedles (MNs) are widely applied in biomedicine both in diagnostics and in
therapeutics, as being the perfect painless interface between the patient and a sensing or
dispenser device [3–6]. In particular, polymeric microneedles act as a molecular ﬁlter
that is able to lock enzymes and to allow the analyte molecules diffusion from the
interstitial liquid [4, 5, 7]. In this work, we present the in vitro dynamic characterization
of two sensing devices based on tree electrodes system and integrating polymeric MNs
arrays for the measure of glucose and lactate level in the subcutaneous interstitial
liquid.

To characterize the sensor the following materials have been used: phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) 10 mM (NaCl 0.138 M, KCl−0.0027 M) at pH 7.4, VF, mag-
nesium chloride (MgCl2) 0.48 mM, solutions of glucose and lactic acid prepared in
PBS solution and stored at 4 °C in the dark. In order to reach sugar muta-rotation
equilibrium, D-(+)-glucose solutions have been stored overnight at room temperature
before using.
All chemicals were reagent grade or higher and have been used as received unless
otherwise speciﬁed. All aqueous solutions have been prepared with ultrapure water by
means of a MilliporeMilli-Q system (18.2 MΩ cm).

Fabrication
Fabrication of microneedles devices follows the fabrication steps presented in [4] and
[8] and shown in Fig. 1. Brieﬂy, 1 ml of the solution, containing PEGDA, VF
(1% w/v) and PI (2% v/v), has been casted on quartz slide and exposed to UV light for
10 s (Fig. 1, step 1).
The obtained PEGDA layer has been used as ﬂexible support for the MN array and
is about 1 mm thick. The MN arrays have been fabricated by direct photopolymer-
ization of the former solution mixed with the enzymatic solutions in 9:1 ratio, where
the enzymatic solutions have been obtained dissolving GOx in PBS (pH 6.0) at
20 mg/mL concentration and LOx in PBS (pH 6.5) at 15 mg/mL concentration and
stirring the solutions for 4 h at 4 °C, as done in [7]. A silicone vessel (1.5  1.0
0.4 cm3) has been fulﬁlled with the last solutions and the PEGDA layer is overturned
on the silicone vessel (Fig. 1, step 2). The direct contact of the PEGDA layer with the
solutions allows the adhesion of the MNs to ﬂexible substrate. The UV exposure has
been performed for 25 s through a quartz/chrome photomask in soft contact mode
(Fig. 1, step 3). For the UV exposure the MA6/BA6 mask aligner (by Karl Suss AG,
Germany) at 18 mW/cm2 and 365 nm has been used.

P. Dardano et al.

After the develop in deionized water for 2 min (Fig. 1, step 4), the quartz support
has been removed by means of tweezers and a gold layer has been deposited on the
back of the PEGDA layer by the K975X sputter (by Emitech, Italy) at 30 mA current,
room temperature and for 240 s, obtaining a 160 nm thick layer (Fig. 1, step 5). In
order to prevent the direct contact between gold layer and electrolytic solution during
the electrochemical characterizations, the gold layer has been covered with a com-
mercial liquid silicone rubber (Saratoga, Italy), hardened at room temperature in 2 h
(Fig. 1, step 6). In order to realize the electric contact between the electrochemical cell
setup and the fabricated working electrodes, silicone rubber uncovers a small area of
the gold layer. However, during electrochemical characterization the uncovered gold
stayed out of the electrolytic solution.

Quartz Microbalance Measurements
Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technology is currently used in measuring with
high sensitivity small mass changes. Standard nanogravimetry exploits the piezoelec-
tric quartz resonators (QR) properties in quantifying the resonance frequency shift Df
when a mass m is adsorbed to or desorbed from their surface, according to Sauerbey’s
equation (1):
Df=f0 ¼ Dm=Aql
ð1Þ
where f0 is the fundamental frequency of QR, A is the gold area, Dm is the adsorbed
mass variation corresponding to frequency shift Df and q and l are the quartz density
and thickness, respectively [9, 10].

In [11] homogeneous matrices of polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used as
malleable inert support to selectively detect carbon dioxide (CO2) via nanogravimetric
method in atmosphere-controlled chamber. Similarly, a QR sample covered by a
PEGDA droplet has been fabricated in order to dynamically characterize the swelling
of the PEGDA matrix in PBS solution. The sample is fabricated by exposing at UV for
25 s a 1 ll of PEGDA, PI and VF solution casted on a gold plate of the QR (Fig. 2a).
To this purpose, QCM by Novaetech S.p.A. (Italy) and quartz resonator by I.E.V.
(Italy) have been used in a chamber with a volume of 30 ll fulﬁlled with PBS
(Fig. 2a).
2.4
Electrochemical Measurements
To provide a dynamic in vitro electrochemical characterization, chronoamperometric
(CA) measurements in a three electrodes BASi C-3 Cell Stand have been performed.
Figure 2b shows a sketch of the experimental set-up: a saturated silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl 3 M) reference electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode and the
enzymes doped PEGDA MNs (for glucose or for lactic acid detection) as working
electrode. Moreover, the interstitial liquid has been mimicked by electrolytic solution:
PBS (pH 7.4) mixed with MgCl2. During the measurements (at room temperature) the
electrolytic solution has been deoxygenated with nitrogen. Generally, the CA technique
give information about the inﬂuence of the analyte (glucose or acid lactic) concen-
tration on the electrons production that follows the proper redox reaction in presence of
VF as redox mediator as reported in [4] and [7].

During CA measurements, the potential between working and reference electrodes
has been ﬁxed at 300 mV and the current, ﬂowing from working to auxiliary elec-
trodes, has been registered as function of time. The CA characteristics have performed
5 min after addition of aliquots at known concentration of analyte (glucose or lactic
acid), in order to allow the diffusion inside the electrolytic solution, Glucose and lactic
acid have been detected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mM and 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mM concentrations,
respectively. Reported results have been graphed and processed by Origin® software.

Results
The systems are proposed as proof-of-concept of a wearable electrochemical biosen-
sors, useful for monitoring of glucose and lactic acid levels in the interstitial ﬂuid. The
photolithographic fabrication of MNs has been optimized to lock into the polymeric
matrix enzymes and the redox mediator without less in their activity. In particular, the
temperature during the exposure has been measured by a thermo couple placed on the
sample holder of the mask aligner and changes from 25 to 27 °C. Therefore the low
exposure time guarantees that the temperature is ever lower than the degradation
temperature of enzymes. Figure 3 shows a photo of an enzymes doped PEGDA MNs
working electrode: the device is completely ﬂexible and could be deformed without
breaking or loosing the electrical contact.
By soaking the system into the electrolytic solution, polymeric swelling allows the
analyte molecules (glucose or lactic acid) diffusion inside the PEGDA matrix and the
interaction with the enzymes (GOx or LOx), resulting in the generation of electrons

camera shows the ﬂexibility of the system. In the inset, a detail of the MNs arrays has been

current collected by auxiliary electrode. The swelling dynamics has been monitored by
QCM measurements by means of a QR covered by a solidiﬁed PEGDA droplet.
Figure 4 shows the resonance frequency of the modiﬁed QR as function of time. In the
inset of Fig. 4, a picture of the solidiﬁed and soaked PEGDA droplet on the quartz
resonator has been captured by means of the water contact angle camera (scale bar is
750 µm). The frequency of the quartz resonator decreases when the PBS solution
diffused in MNs PEGDA structure with a constant time, estimated by ﬁtting data
(R2 = 0.99), of about 2 min (1.99 ± 0.02 min), and is stable after about 5 min. These
data are representative of swelling kinetic in MNS.
Moreover, the CA measurements register the enzymatic kinetics and quantify the
biosensor responses as current value at several concentrations of glucose and lactic
acid, in concentration ranges of interest for the detection in human interstitial ﬂuid [12,
13]. In a recent publication (Ref. [4]), the stationary current value has been considered
to determine the calibration curves for glucose and lactic acid. In this way, the reported
sensitivity of the biosensor is 18 ± 3 nA mM−1 in the range from 0 to 4 mM for
glucose and 3.5 ± 0.2 nA mM−1 in the range from 0 to 1 mM for lactic acid. How-
ever, as reported in Ref. [14], faster response time (30 s) can be obtained in the case of
MN array enzymatic based biosensor. Indeed, after waiting a swelling time of two
minutes and considering the response of the biosensors at 10, 20, 30 and 60 s, a greater
and stable linear range is found after 10 s in both cases and a comparable sensitivity is
found after 10 s (Fig. 5).

In particular, for glucose biosensor a linear range from 0 to 10 mM is found with a
sensitivity 15 ± 2 nA mM−1 considering the current after 10 s of interaction. More-
over, data and ﬁt results (showed in Fig. 5a and summarized in Table 1) clearly show
that the linearity range is the same and the sensitivity is comparable after 10, 20, 30 and
60 s.
For glucose biosensor a linear range from 0 to 4 mM is found with sensitivity
1.0 ± 0.1 nA mM−1 considering the current after 10 s of interaction. Similarly, data
and ﬁt results (showed in Fig. 5b and summarized in Table 2) show that the linearity
range is the same and the sensitivity is comparable after 10, 20, 30 and 60 s.

Finally, considering the limits of detection (LoD) as 3r/S, where r is the standard
deviation of the measured current at 0 mMol and S is the sensor sensitivity, as done in
[14], LoD is about 0.5 mM for both biosensor, respectively.

Conclusions
Enzymes doped PEGDA MNs working electrodes have been fabricated by standard
photolithography of a solution of enzymes (GOx/LOx), redox mediator (VF) and a
photoinitiator (PI) in PEGDA. Swelling dynamics of the polymeric matrix has been
characterized by QCM measurements and have a constant time of about 2 min
(1.99 ± 0.02 min) and a stabilization time of about 5 min. The devices have been
characterized by CA measurements and show sensitivities of the order of nA mM−1
with a limit of detection of 0.5 mM. The biosensors are suitable for wearable patch for
continuous monitoring of glucose in diabetes patients or for sensing the acid lactic
levels in athletes with minimum invasiveness. The technology of Enzymes doped
PEGDA MNs working electrodes has been patented [15].

Abstract. Noble-metal decorated graphene nanohybrids are expected to be a
new type of sensing material with high sensitivity and excellent selectivity, since
the metal nanoparticles can act as a mediator in the interaction between analytes
and graphene, determining peculiar mechanisms of charge transfer according to
chemical or electronic sensitization. In particular, the decoration by silver
nanoparticles (Ag NPs) can improve the sensing behavior of carbon nanos-
tructures
towards
ammonia.

(GR/AgNPs) hybrids were prepared by a one-step microwave-assisted reduction
method by irradiating a water/isopropyl alcohol solution of pristine graphene
and AgNO3. Two different concentrations of silver precursor were tested
obtaining graphene hybrids with different surface coverage. The effect of the
metal decoration was investigated by probing the sensing properties of the
chemiresistive layers towards NO2 and NH3 at concentrations, respectively, of
sub-ppm and hundreds of ppm in air, which are considered as standard marker
levels of environmental pollution. The results show that the high speciﬁcity of
bare graphene towards NO2 in ppb levels was reversed towards NH3 by addition
of Ag NPs. Noteworthy, a low areal density of Ag NPs allowed the material to
gain sensitivity towards ammonia while still retaining sensitivity to NO2. At
higher surface coverage an almost complete reversal of the sensitivity occurred
and the silver decorated material appeared highly sensitive towards ammonia.

Introduction
The potential of graphene in the sensing ﬁeld stems from the unusual combination of
singular properties in the same material such as the large speciﬁc surface area, the high
charge mobility, the low electrical noise and the molecular sensitivity [1]. The inter-
action of graphene with gaseous molecules can vary in fact in relation to the outermost
electron shell structure of the adsorbates [2–4]. Another advantage is that sensitivity,

chemical afﬁnity and selectivity towards speciﬁc molecules can be tuned by modifying
the graphene structure [4, 5].
Among the several approaches considered for this aim, noble-metal decorated
graphene nanohybrids are expected to be a new type of sensing material with high
sensitivity and excellent selectivity since the metal nanoparticles can act as a mediator
in the interaction between analytes and graphene determining different mechanisms of
charge transfer according to chemical or electronic sensitization [6]. For instance, it is
known that decoration by silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) greatly improves the sensing
behavior of carbon nanostructures towards ammonia [7]. Another interesting features
of these systems is that when metal nanoparticles are integrated with graphene sheets, a
synergistic effect activates a RT operating mechanism whereas sensors based on noble
metals usually require high operating temperatures. Composite materials made by
reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and silver nanostructures showed indeed excellent
sensitivity towards NH3 at room temperature [8–10].
In this work, graphene/Ag nanoparticles (GR/AgNPs) hybrids were prepared by a
one-step microwave-assisted reduction method by irradiating a water/isopropyl alcohol
solution of pristine graphene and AgNO3. Graphene hybrids with different surface
coverage in relation to the concentration of the silver precursor were easily obtained
and their sensing performances towards NO2 and NH3 were investigated.

Experimental
Graphene was prepared through a sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation of natural
graphite as described in Ref. [11]. Graphite ﬂakes (NGS Naturgraphit GmbH Winner
Strabe 9 D-91227 Leinburg-Germany) were dispersed at 2.5 mg/ml into 80 ml of an
ultrapure water/i-propyl alcohol mixture (7:1 v/v) and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath
for 48 h (Transsonic Digital S, 40 kHz, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH). Unexfoliated
graphitic crystallites were removed by centrifugation at 500 rpm for 45 min.
Silver NPs decoration of graphene (GR/AgNPs) was accomplished as described in
Ref. [13]. Graphene suspension (1 ml) was mixed with 1 ml of ethylene glycol
(C2H6O2, Sigma Aldrich, CAS 107-21-1) and 1 ml of AgNO3 in puriﬁed water (Sigma
Aldrich, CAS 7761-88-8) at 0.01 and 0.1 M and named GR/AgNPs1 and GR/AgNPs2,
respectively. The suspensions were exposed to cyclic microwave exposures for a total
of 4500 s, separated by 10 s off-time steps, by means of Microwave Digestion System
equipped with a 700 W magnetron (Perkin Elmer/Anton Paar Multiwave). Afterwards,
suspensions were centrifuged and the solid residue washed with ultrapure water.
The morphology of the GR/AgNPs hybrids were studied using Field Emission
Scanning Electron Microscopy, coupled with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis
System (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy. The samples were prepared by
drop-casting few microliters of the solutions directly onto Si substrates. The FESEM
images were taken with a FESEM/EDS, LEO 1530-2 working at an acceleration
voltage of 5 kV. Atomic Force Microscope (AFM-Nanoscope IV Veeco) was used to
map topography, operating in tapping mode with a n-doped Si tip (model RTESP
Veeco, resonant frequency 257–328 kHz; spring constant 20–80 N/m; radius of cur-
vature <10 nm) under ambient condition, with a scanning rate of 0.5 Hz and 256

scanning lines. Raman spectra were acquired on ﬁlms drop-casted onto oxidized silicon
wafers (SiO2 300 nm) using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia Reﬂex) @
514 nm excitation, in backscattering conﬁguration. Raman spectra were acquired and
averaged mapping the samples in more than 10 different points.
Chemiresistor devices were fabricated by direct drop casting of few microliters of
each mixtures onto transducers and dried in air at 100 °C on a hot plate. The trans-
ducers have 5 pairs of gold interdigitated electrodes (IDE) electrodeposited onto alu-
mina substrate: each electrode ﬁnger is 350 lm wide and 4650 lm long. The spacing
between ﬁngers is 350 lm.
The sensing devices were placed in an air-tight chamber with electrical feed-
throughs. A constant voltage was applied and the variation of resistance was monitored
and recorded with the changes in the gas environment using a high resolution
picoammeter Keithley 6485. A typical measurement cycle foresees three continuous
steps:
1. Flushing of carrier gas for 1200 s (baseline),
2. Introducing analyte gas in the carrier stream for 600 s (sensing response),
3. Flushing of carrier gas for 1200 s (sensor recovery).
Synthetic air was used as carrier gas and as balance gas for sample gases dilutions.
The measurements were performed setting the ﬂow at 500 sccm with relative humidity
(RH) at 50% and temperature at 22 °C.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 summarizes the morphological features of the bare graphene obtained by the
LPE method (Fig. 1a, b). The presence of nanosheets with an average lateral size
around 500 nm is observed.
Raman spectrum, in particular, shows the evidence of the effective exfoliation of
the natural graphite (Fig. 1c). The increase of the 2D1 component and the concurrent
decrease of the 2D2 peak is the typical signature of graphene nanosheets with an
average number of layers less than ﬁve [12].
Graphene-silver hybrids retain most of the morphological features of the bare
graphene, as can be observed in FESEM and AFM images reported in Fig. 2. FESEM
images (Fig. 2a, b) display graphene nanosheets with silver nanoparticles uniformly
distributed all over the surfaces. AFM Phase (Fig. 2c, d) and topography (Fig. 3e, f)
images of GR/AgNPs1 and GR/AgNPs2 show a granular structure with nanoparticles
anchored onto the GR surface [13]. The corresponding proﬁles indicate that the height
of the Ag nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets is in the range 2–4 nm with an
average diameter of 20–30 nm.
The metal NPs decoration of graphene results evident from the Raman analysis,
where an intensity enhancement of the graphene bands due to surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) effects was observed. Information about the changes in the spatial
frequency of the enhanced spectra were drawn by mapping a 5  5 lm2 area at
1 lm-steps.
84
M.L. Miglietta et al.

For GR/AgNPs1 (Fig. 3a), a SERS effect was observed in around 11% of the
sampled area, while for GR/AgNPs2, around 30% of the sampling points gave rise to a
Raman enhancement (Fig. 3b), giving conﬁrmation of the denser distribution of NPs
on graphene observed in AFM and FESEM images. In addition, the ampliﬁcation
factors observed permits to infer that, in both samples, a charge-transfer between
graphene nanosheets and metal nanoparticles is established [14].
The effect of the metal decoration was investigated by probing the sensing prop-
erties of these layers towards NO2 and NH3. The percentage response (S) is deﬁned as
the maximum of the conductance variation reached by the device during the analyte
exposure, that is [|G −G0|/G0]  100 where G and G0 are the conductance values
recorded during analyte exposure and baseline acquisition steps, respectively. Absolute
values are used for a better comparison among responses to both analytes, the con-
ductance variations being in positive for NO2 and negative for ammonia, according to
their different electrical behaviour [4, 15]. The responses to 300 ppb of NO2 and to

250 ppm of NH3 gases are reported in Fig. 4. This graph clearly show that the sen-
sitivity towards NO2 decreases in the order GR > GR/AgNPs1  GR/AgNPs2. Since
graphene has a speciﬁc response to NO2, this behavior could actually be addressed to
the decrease in free graphene surface available for speciﬁc adsorption. To the highest

extent of surface coverage by Ag NPs, achieved for the GR/AgNPs2 sample, the
response to NO2 was indeed almost completely hindered. With regard to the ammonia
sensing, hybrid materials showed noteworthy responses, above 15 and 21.5% for
GR/AgNPs1 and GR/AgNPs2 respectively, after exposure to 250 ppm of NH3. Under
the same exposure conditions, pristine graphene showed only a modest 2.5% response.

A comparison between a Raman spectrum acquired in a region covered by metal NPs (red solid
line) and one recorded in an area not covered by NPs (black solid line) is reported. The intensity
of the G band, enhanced due to the surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect of AgNPs, is about
2400% greater than that of GR in the case of GR/AgNPs1 and 300% in the case of GR/AgNPs2

the device responses are drawn. The inset shows the dynamic responses of the GR/AgNPs1 based

Also in this case, the enhanced sensitivity to ammonia of the hybrids material with
different Ag NP loadings can be addressed to an increased adsorption ability by the
speciﬁc sensing element, i.e. Ag NPs. This result is in agreement with previous
observation from Cui et al. [8] whose found out that sensitivity of RGO layer beneﬁts
from the increasing of the Ag NPs loadings.
The most interesting aspect of these results is that the sample GR/AgNPs2 presents
an almost complete reversal of the sensitivity from NO2 to NH3 with respect to bare GR
while preserving the functionality of the underlying graphene itself. This demonstrates
that the tuning of the sensing properties of the material was effective. A lower areal
density of Ag NPs allows instead the material to keep the sensitivity to both the
analytes and, since the responses are opposite in sign, it can be possible to exploit this
feature for a sensing device able to be employed in a wide range of scenarios.

Conclusion
We have shown a practical method to prepare a graphene composite with silver
nanoparticles. This decoration modulates the sensitivity of the graphene towards ana-
lytes that are representative of compounds with completely opposite electronic
behaviors. The noteworthy effect of Ag decoration was the enabling of the layer
response towards hundreds of ppm of NH3 in air. The results indicate that the sensi-
tivity was affected by the graphene surface coverage by Ag NPs. In fact, depending on
the areal density of the Ag NPs, it was possible to retain the sensitivity to both the

Abstract. Electrochemical sensors are largely used for rapid, sensitive and
accurate measurement of glucose in many applications such as clinical diag-
nostics, ecological ﬁeld, biotechnology and food industry. Among the various
methods, the amperometric one is the most popular due to its simplicity and high
sensitivity. Furthermore, due to their higher intrinsic stability, electrochemical
glucose sensors based on inorganic materials are preferred with respect to
enzymatic ones for applications in severe conditions. Herein, we present a simple
method to prepare an electrochemical sensor for the determination of glucose by
modiﬁcation of planar copper electrodes in order to obtain a high sensitive copper
oxide-modiﬁed electrode. In particular, we show the versatility of the preparation
method comparing the electrochemical sensing properties towards glucose of two
modiﬁed copper electrodes, commercial and homemade, respectively.

Introduction
The determination of glucose is essential in many ﬁelds such as clinical diagnostics,
biotechnology and food industry [1]. Therefore, over the past few decades great
attention has been paid to the development of glucose sensors [2]. Various analytical
methods have been employed for glucose monitoring such as spectrophotometry,
spectroﬂuorometry and liquid chromatography [3–5]. However, due to the simplicity,
low cost and the possibility to realize practical sensor devices with excellent sensing
properties, the electrochemical methods have been the most studied and adopted in the
last decades. The commonly studied amperometric glucose detectors are enzymatic
biosensors based on glucose oxidase. The main drawback is related to the nature of
enzymes, indeed they are susceptible to environmental conditions such as temperature,
pH value, humidity and toxic chemicals. Furthermore, glucose oxidase sensors suffer
from instability, high cost of enzymes, complicated immobilization procedures and
critical operating conditions associated with cross-linking and entrapment in an elec-
tropolymerized and biocompatible matrix [6]. Therefore, the development of a cheap,
highly selective, fast and reliable non-enzymatic glucose sensor is still highly desirable.
Noble metals, metal alloys and metal nanoparticles [7, 8] have shown excellent
potential in the development of non-enzymatic sensors, however these electrodes have
some drawback as low selectivity, high cost, surface etching during electrochemical

processes or surface poisoning by intermediate species. In this context, electrochemical
glucose sensors based on nanostructured metal-oxide materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO),
manganese oxide (MnO2), titanium oxide (TiO2), cerium oxide (CeO2), silicon oxide
(SiO2) and copper oxides (CuO, Cu2O) have offered many advantages compared to
enzymatic or noble metal-based glucose sensors [9]. Among them, nanostructured CuO is
a promising candidate for the development of non-enzymatic glucose sensors because of
its high speciﬁc surface area, good electrochemical activity then excellently high sensi-
tivity, stability and anti-interference ability [10–12]. However, the preliminary synthesis of
CuO and the successive modiﬁcation of the electrode is often tedious. So, the development
of simple method for the synthesis of CuO nanostructures and the fabrication of electrode
for electrochemical sensors still remains a challenging topic. In order to overcome these
problems, in recent years new in situ techniques of synthesis have been proposed for the
growth of CuO nanostructures directly on copper substrates [13, 14]. On this basis, we
present a simple method to prepare an electrochemical sensor for the determination of
glucose by modiﬁcation of planar copper electrodes in order to obtain a nanostructured
copper oxide-based electrode. In particular, we show the versatility of the preparation
method comparing the electrochemical sensing properties towards glucose of both com-
mercial and homemade modiﬁed copper electrodes prepared with the same technique.

Experimental
2.1
Sensors Fabrication
Three electrode planar devices were used to fabricate electrochemical glucose sensors
based on CuO nanostructured working electrode. A homemade device was prepared in
according to what reported previously [15]. It consists in a three-electrode planar
conﬁguration with a circular copper working electrode of 3 mm in diameter, a silver
pseudo-reference electrode and a graphite counter electrode. The commercial one is a
Dropsens CU10 consisting in a copper working electrode of 4 mm in diameter, a silver
pseudo-reference electrode and a graphite counter electrode.
To obtain the modiﬁed electrodes, CuO nanostructures were grown in situ on the
copper working electrodes following a simple and fast two-step procedure.
In the ﬁrst step the Cu electrode is immersed into an aqueous solution containing
7.5 mM CuSO4  5H2O and 0.4 M Na2O2, for 20 min at room temperature, in order
to obtain the hydroxyl phase Cu(OH)2. In the second step a drying at 120 °C for 3 h
and a subsequent thermal treatment at 180 °C for 3 h promote the complete transfor-
mation of hydroxyl phase to CuO.
2.2
Characterization
Working electrodes of both commercial and homemade sensors were characterized by
scanning electron microscopy before and after chemical modiﬁcation of their surfaces.
Electrochemical measurements were performed with a DropSens µStat 400
potentiostat/galvanostat. All electrochemical experiments were carried out using the
same three electrodes of each device with un-modiﬁed Cu or CuO nanowires modiﬁed
working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate and compare the

electrochemical behaviors and the sensing performance of developed sensors. All
electrochemical tests were carried out in alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH) in order to
promote the glucose oxidation on the electrodes surfaces recording the CV curves at
100 mV/s in absence and presence of different concentrations of glucose.

3.1
Morphological Characterization
For both homemade and commercial devices the working electrodes surface were
investigated before and after chemical modiﬁcation. In Fig. 1a, d is shown the SEM
micrographies of homemade and commercial un-modiﬁed electrodes respectively. Each
one shows a different surface roughness. In the case of the homemade electrode the
presence of parallel grooves is due to mechanical abrasion carried out in order to remove
possible surface oxides before the chemical treatment. For commercial one has not been
performed any kind of pretreatment and the shown surface morphology is as-bought. In
Fig. 1b, c, e, f is shown the SEM micrographs at different magniﬁcations, for homemade
and commercial electrode respectively, after chemical modiﬁcation. In the micrographs
at lower magniﬁcation, it is possible to observe a uniform coverage of the surface of both
electrodes in comparison to the respective un-modiﬁed ones due to the growth of the CuO
phase on them. At higher magniﬁcation similar nanostructures can observed for both
electrodes with ﬁbrous and needle-like shapes. As obtained suggests that the adopted
technique of synthesis, in spite of the different starting copper support, can effectively
lead to the formation the required CuO nanostructure with no special precautions.

Electrochemical Characterization
CV was used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of Cu and CuO modiﬁed
electrodes towards glucose oxidation. The electrochemical behavior and the sensing
performance of the homemade sensor are detailed in an our previous paper [15]. Here
we focus on the electrochemical characterization of the commercial sensor with
unmodiﬁed and CuO nanostructure modiﬁed electrode and the comparison with the
previous homemade sensor. In Fig. 2a, b is shown the CVs obtained for commercial
unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed electrodes in absence and presence of 5 mM of glucose in
0.1 M KOH respectively. From the CVs recorded in blank 0.1 M KOH solution
(Fig. 2a) a large difference in the area of the cycles between unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed
electrodes can be observed. This could be due to the larger surface area of CuO
modiﬁed electrode compared to unmodiﬁed one as effect of an increased capacitance of
double layer directly related to the real surface of electrode. Furthermore, CV of CuO
modiﬁed electrode shows a weak oxidation peak during anodic scan and a subsequent
marked broad reduction peak during cathodic scan close to the potential of 0.55 V,
which might be correspond to redox couple Cu(II)/Cu(III) in according to previously
reported [13]. However, compared to the previous one, unmodiﬁed electrode shows a
very narrow cycle, though a weak reduction peaks during cathodic scan can be also
observed for it. Indeed, as effect of strong alkaline solution, some oxidized group could
be formed on the copper surface which might justify the observed reduction peak. In
presence of 5 mM of glucose in 0.1 M KOH solution both unmodiﬁed and CuO
modiﬁed electrodes show marked anodic peaks due to the glucose oxidation. The
absence of reduction peaks suggests the irreversible oxidation of this species. Although
both electrodes are able to detect the presence of glucose, the CuO modiﬁed one shows
a remarkable increase in anodic current and a slight decrease of the oxidation over-
potential. In fact, while for the unmodiﬁed electrode the glucose oxidation peak is
centered at about 0.63 V with onset potential at 0.4 V, in the case of the CuO modiﬁed
electrode the maximum of the oxidation peak occurs at 0.55 V with onset potential
close to 0.3 V. This excellent electrochemical properties showed by CuO modiﬁed
electrode may be due to the high reactivity of such material to catalyze the oxidation of
the glucose, and the larger speciﬁc surface, typical of this nanostructure, which would
favor the increase of the oxidation current, and then the sensitivity.
Figure 3a shows the CVs recorded for different concentrations of glucose in 0.1 M
KOH solution for CuO modiﬁed commercial electrode. The anodic peak current
increases with increasing of glucose concentration in according to a linear trend. In
Fig. 3b is plotted the peak current density, obtained normalizing the peak currents to
the respective geometric area of each electrode, for both commercial and homemade
electrodes before and after the surface modiﬁcation.
Table 1 summarizes the features and performance of the electrodes. Each electrode
shows an excellent linearity of response in the investigated range, i.e. 0–4 mM of
glucose. Both commercial and homemade electrodes modiﬁed by CuO nanostructures
show increased sensitivity in comparison to the respective unmodiﬁed electrodes. In
particular, the Cu unmodiﬁed commercial electrode shows a slightly higher sensitivity
compared to the homemade one probably due to the greater roughness, which lead to a
higher active surface. Unlike, in the case of CuO modiﬁed electrodes, both ones show a

very similar sensitivity suggesting that, after modiﬁcation, they present a very similar
active surface. The difference in potential observed comparing the oxidation potential
of glucose for commercial and homemade electrodes, is only due to the different
reference electrode adopted. However, for both electrodes after modiﬁcation with the
CuO nanostructures the oxidation peak is shifted of about 0.1 V towards lower
potentials.

Conclusion
Three electrode planar electrochemical sensors were fabricated and tested to monitor
glucose in alkaline media. By a simple oxidative treatment, CuO nanostructures were
directly grown on the surface of commercial and homemade Cu working electrodes.
The morphological characterization shows the formation of ﬁbrous and acicular
nanowires for both homemade and commercial electrodes. Furthermore, both CuO
modiﬁed electrodes show similar electrochemical behavior towards glucose oxidation
in alkaline medium suggesting a high versatility of the employed method.

cursor on alumina substrates. To convert the precursor to the desired iron oxide
phase, an annealing step was carried out at elevated temperatures (>450 °C). In
this work a a-Fe2O3 thin ﬁlm-based chemoresistive sensors for ethanol detection
in air were fabricated. The device developed was investigated for evaluate the
sensing characteristics such sensitivity, selectivity and stability.

Introduction
The ability to pattern oxide structures at the microscale directly on different substrates
is important for a broad range of emerging applications, including sensors, micro-fuel
cells and batteries, photocatalysts, solar arrays, and photonic band gap (PBG) materials.
Sol-gel can be used to prepare suitable inks for direct patterning. For example, by
designing sol-gel inks based on organometallic precursors, Duoss et al. [3] have
recently demonstrated direct ink writing of oxide structures.
Iron oxide (Fe2O3) is being currently explored diverse applications such as mag-
netic storage media, environment protection, sensors, catalysis, etc. In the pursuit to
prepare Fe2O3 nanomaterials, a variety of synthesis routes like precursor, precipitation,
sol-gel, hydrothermal, combustion, solvent evaporation etc. have been reported [2, 4, 7,
8]. However, most of these methods are associated with some limitations such as use of
expensive compounds as starting materials, use of strong bases as precipitating agent
and formation of mixed or undesired crystalline phases.
Therefore, development of a simple synthetic methodology for preparation of pure
Fe2O3 nanostructures is a major challenge till now. Herein, we report a synthesis
methodology for preparation of single phase -Fe2O3 thin ﬁlm to use as a sensitive layer
for ethanol sensors.

The important features of the methods reported here are: no impurity phase for-
mation; the use of simple and cheap starting materials and water as solvent. The
simplicity of the method to produce nanostructured pure Fe2O3 makes it attractive as
compared to other synthetic methods.
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is one of the most commonly and widely used alcohols and has
many applications in food, biomedical, transportation and chemical industries, there-
fore the detection of ethanol vapor at ppm levels is of great importance [1, 6]. Con-
sequently, the possibility to have cheap, reliable, and simple to prepare sensors is very
appreciated. Because the iron oxide has been shown several times an excellent, stable
then a promising material for the monitoring of ethanol [5, 9], in this work we will
focus our attention to it.

Experimental
2.1
Preparation of the Printable Aqueous Solution
For synthesis of a-Fe2O3 thin ﬁlms iron (III) sulfate, was used as Fe (III) source,
polyethyleneglycole was used as esteriﬁcation agent and citric acid was used as
chelating agent. All equipment was cleaned thoroughly by soaking in ethanol and
washed with distilled water. Figure 1 shows schematic representation of steps to obtain
iron oxide precursors ink.
In a typical synthesis process two aqueous solutions were prepared. The ﬁrst
solution was prepared by dissolving of appropriate amount of iron sulfate into 50 ml of
hot (70 °C) distilled water (to make 0.1 M solution) under magnetic stirring vigorously
until a homogeneous solution was formed.
The second solution was prepared by dissolving of appropriate amount of citric acid
in hot distilled water (50 ml) at 70 °C (Molar ratio between citric acid and metallic Fe
was 2). The separate solutions were kept under magnetic stirring until complete disso-
lution. Then these two solution were mixed and appropriate amount of polyethyleneg-
lycol (molar ratio between PEG and metallic iron was 2) was added. The resulting
mixture was reﬂuxed at 120 °C for 2 h, obtaining a clear yellow-colored solution.

2.2
Sensor Preparation and Sensing Tests
Sensor devices were fabricated dropping an appropriate volume of above solution on
alumina substrates (3  6 mm2) supplied with interdigited Pt electrodes and heating
element on the back side. The sensors prepared were let drying at room temperature
then heat treated at two different temperature 450 and 600 °C to obtain pure crystalline
thin ﬁlm iron oxides.
Measurements were performed under a dry air total stream of 100 sccm, collecting
the sensors resistance data in the four points mode by means of an Agilent 34970A
multimeter. Electrical measurements were carried out in the working temperature
400–450 °C. Sensing tests were performed in a lab apparatus which allows to operate
at controlled temperature and to perform resistance measurements while varying the
ethanol concentration from 12.5 to 500 ppm. The gas response was deﬁned as the ratio
Rair/Rgas and Rgas/Rair for reducing and oxidizing gas respectively, where Rair repre-
sents the electrical resistance of the sensor in dry air and Rgas is electrical resistance of
the sensor at different ethanol (or another gases) concentration. Response time, tres, was
deﬁned as the time required for the sensor resistance to reach 90% of the equilibrium
value after ethanol is injected and recovery time, trec, was taken as the time necessary
for the sensor resistance to reach 90% of the baseline value in air.

Results
The sensor devices were treated at high temperatures in order to promote the complete
transformation of precursors in a stable iron oxide phase. Two different temperature
450 and 600 °C respectively were used and the effect on the sensing performance was
then investigated. Figure 2a, b show the dynamic responses of both sensors recorded at
operation temperature of 450 °C during pulses at different concentrations of ethanol.
Both sensors show a decrease of resistance when the sensitive ﬁlms are exposed to
ethanol pulses in agreement to the effect of a reducing gas on a n-type semiconductor
material [5]. In Fig. 2c are reported the calibration curves extrapolated from the pre-
vious dynamic responses to different concentrations of ethanol. As it can be observed,
the sensor treated at 600 °C shows a decreased sensitivity compared to the sensor
treated at 450 °C. This effect could be due to an excessive sintering of the iron oxide
which leads to a compact thin ﬁlm characterized by low surface area. In the case of the
sample treated at 450 °C, the lower annealed temperature while ensuring the trans-
formation into iron oxide precursors thus favoring the stability to the sensitive ﬁlm, it
would not enable the complete sintering of the material. Consequently, the possible
formation of a porous structure with a higher speciﬁc surface could justify the greater
sensitivity shown by this sensor. Having the best performance, the sensor treated at
450 °C was chosen for further investigation.
A good sensor should be as fast as possible so it is very important to understand the
relationship between response/recovery time and ethanol concentrations. Figure 3
reports the response and recovery times of the sensor recorded at the operation tem-
perature of 450 °C as function of ethanol concentration. As shown, increasing the
ethanol concentration the response time becomes shorter and recovery time becomes

longer. The shortest response time recorded is 6 s to 500 ppm ethanol, and the shortest
recovery time is 360 s to 12.5 ppm ethanol. The response time and recovery depend on
the reaction rate of ethanol molecules with the active sites on the sensitive material and
by their time of desorption respectively. When the ethanol concentration is low, the
ethanol molecules may spend relatively long time reacting with the active sites rep-
resented by oxygen ions. With the concentration increasing, the reaction time
decreases, and the response time decreases accordingly. Unlike, because recovery time
is due to the desorption rate of molecule from the surface of sensitive material, a higher
concentration means a large number of molecules adsorbed which require long time to
completely desorb. Both reaction and desorption processes of the gas molecules from
sensitive surface are energetically activated processes so, the operating temperature has
a large effect on their kinetics. In this case, although temperatures below 450 °C
improved the sensitivity to ethanol, they also increased the response and recovery times
of the sensor.
Reliability is another important parameter of the sensors. For a sensor this means to
be stable and not have false positive then response only to the species of interest; in
other words, it should be selective. Figure 4a compares the response to ethanol of the
sensor as fabricated and after 8 days of operation. As observed, the sensor shows an
excellent match in the responses recorded in the two different days. This aspect and the
preservation of the baseline during the days suggest a good stability of the
developed sensor.
The sensing response of sensor towards different reducing and oxidizing vapors and
gases such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, acetone, carbon dioxide, methane,
ammonia, hydrogen, oxygen at different concentrations is shown in Fig. 4b. As
observed, the response to the lowest concentration of ethanol tested (12.5 ppm) is
about 2.5 times higher than the responses to other vapors and gases for typical their
concentration in the main applications. As obtained suggests also an excellent selec-
tivity of the here reported a-Fe2O3 thin ﬁlm based sensor.

Conclusion
In this paper, stable water solution using a Pechini sol-gel process was prepared and
used to print a thin ﬁlm on ceramic sensor substrates. The effect of annealing tem-
perature has been investigated identifying 450 °C as the best condition to obtain a
stable and sensitive ﬁlm. The a-Fe2O3 thin ﬁlm based sensor exhibits a highly selective
sensing behavior towards ethanol and very stable response in time. The simple
preparation method and the excellent sensing performance represent a promising and
encouraging way for practical development of ethanol sensors.

Abstract. In this work, veal urine dilutions in Hepes-buffered Ringer’s solution
(HBRS) are tested by both UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and Cyclic
Voltammetry (CV) to assess their viability as mediums for the detection of
lactate, through the Lactate Dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH) reaction which
involves the formation of NADH. Several data analysis algorithms for the
recorded CV data are proposed and compared, in order to optimize the NADH
detection in the urine samples dilutions. UV-visible spectroscopy was adopted
as reference for NADH quantiﬁcation.

Introduction
Lactate detection in cattle urine samples is a non-invasive method which could help to
prevent syndromes, e.g., sub-acute ruminal acidosis (SARA), that alter the quality of dairy
products and seriously injure the animals in the herds [1, 2]. Electrochemical biosensors
employing the Lactate Dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH) for the Lactate detection are a
well-known technology [3, 4]. These sensors are based on the LDH catalysis, which
reduces NAD+ to NADH in presence of Lactate, and on the NADH electrochemical
quantiﬁcation (Scheme 1).

The NADH detection can be performed both optically (absorbance at 340 nm or
ﬂuorescence at 460 nm) and electrochemically, e.g. by Cyclic Voltammetries
(CVs) which oxidize NADH generating an electrical current proportional to its con-
centration [5, 6]. However, since the NADH oxidation is an irreversible reaction which
usually requires a high overpotential, two approaches are currently adopted: using a
mediator to perform an electrocatalytic oxidation requiring lower overpotentials [7, 8],
or developing new materials for the mediatorless oxidation at lower potentials [9, 10].
With the latter approach, no standard data analysis methods are reported for the
construction of the NADH calibration curve [11]. Therefore, we introduce and compare
six parameters extracted from the cyclic voltammograms, to quantify the NADH
concentration produced by the LDH enzyme in presence of the different Lactate
dilutions in Hepes Buffered Ringer’s Solution (HBRS). Lastly, we validate these
parameters by performing the same measurements with Lactate in veal urine diluted in
HBRS at 1, 10 and 100%.

Materials and Methods
All the chemicals and biochemicals used in this work were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich. The Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide reduced (NADH) and oxidized
(NAD+) coenzymes were purchased in powder form, with a purity  97 and 96.5%
(HPLC), respectively, and dissolved in the mediums prior to use. Lactic acid was
purchased with a purity  98% in powder form, dissolved in the mediums with a
100 mM concentration and conserved at 4 °C for maximum 5 days. The rabbit muscle
Lactate dehydrogenase enzyme was purchased dehydrated, dissolved in PBS to a
concentration of 100 U/ml, and aliquoted in 1 ml tubes stored at −20 °C.
The veal urine samples were provided by the Venetian Zooprophylactic Experi-
mental Institute of Legnaro (Padova), from a 6 months old veal, and stored at −80 °C.
The sensors were purchased from Dropsens Inc. (Dropsens 110). They consist of
screen-printed electrodes on ceramic substrate composed by carbon (working and
counter electrodes) and silver (pseudo-reference electrode and contacts), respectively.
The sensors were used with a Dropsens adapter both in the three and two electrodes
conﬁgurations, for CV and EIS measurements, respectively.
The measurement techniques involved in this work are Cyclic Voltammetry (CV),
and UV-Visible spectrometry (UV-Vis). The CVs were recorded using a CH Instru-
ments Inc. 440a potentiostat with 100 µl of solution, while the UV-Vis measurements
were performed using a Mapada UV 1600PC spectrophotometer with 4 ml quartz
cuvettes (1 cm path length) ﬁlled by 2 ml of solution, i.e., a sufﬁcient volume to
completely cover the incident light spot.
The data analysis was performed by Matlab 2012a, using its native curve ﬁtting
tool for the linear ﬁts.

Results and Discussion
The veal urine sample was diluted in HBRS to several concentrations ranging from 1 to
100% (pure sample).
The dilutions were characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy and CV in order to
deﬁne the level of interference which the sample exhibits at 340 nm, and at 456 mV,
respectively. The former value is usually associated to the NADH absorption peak,
while the latter to oxidation on the carbon electrodes. The results are depicted in Fig. 1.
The adsorption at 340 nm is slightly disturbed by the urine sample. Conversely, the
oxidation of one or more interfering species appears over 300 mV in the CVs, and the
associated current is relevant at high sample concentrations.
Four urine sample dilutions in HBRS were selected for the next experiments, i.e.
100% (pure sample), 10, 1, 0% (HBRS). Each urine sample solution was spiked by 10
Lactate dilutions, ranging from 1 µM to 50 mM.
The prepared dilutions were tested by UV-Vis kinetic measurements at 340 nm for
300 s by mixing in the quartz cuvette 625 µM NAD+ in the respective sample dilution
(1.6 ml), 100 U/ml LDH in PBS (0.2 ml), and each Lactate dilution (0.2 ml). Then, at
the end of the NADH formation kinetics, 100 µl of the cuvette solution were
drop-casted on 3 electrochemical sensors for the CV NADH measurement.
Figures 2 and 3 show the UV-Vis kinetics and CVs for the Lactate dilutions in pure
HBRS. The 300 s absorbance values, obtained from the UV-Vis kinetics allow the
calculation of the ﬁnal NADH concentration through the Lambert-Beer equation and
the millimolar absorption coefﬁcient 6.22 Abs mM−1 cm−1.
Depending on which parameter of the CV curves is considered, different NADH
calibration curves can be obtained, with respect to the UV-Vis determined NADH

concentration. Therefore, we propose six CVs parameters for the NADH quantiﬁcation
in each urine sample dilution, deﬁned as:
• P1: current value at 456 mV;
• P2: area under the CV curve;
• P3: area under the CV curves between 0.2 and 0.8 V;
• P4: area under the CV curves between 0.2 and 0.55 V;
• P5: current recorded at the potential which give the maximum R2 value of the linear
ﬁt of the currents against the NADH concentrations;
• P6: current at the potential which give the absolute maximum slope of the linear ﬁt
of the currents against the NADH concentrations.

end of the UV-Vis kinetic measurements

G. Rosati et al.

The deﬁnitions of these parameters reﬂect all the possible interpretations of the CV
data. For example, P1 represent the current values at a ﬁxed potential (obtained as the
average of the NADH dilutions oxidation peak potentials). Conversely, P2, P3 and P4
are related to the charge accumulation, i.e., to the capacitance, developed by the NADH
oxidation. They become more speciﬁc for this reaction as the boundaries of the area
calculation becomes closer to the NADH oxidation potential. Finally, P5 and P6 are
focused on the NADH calibration curve instead on the single CV.
Figures 4 and 5 show the absolute values of the slopes and the R2 values of the
linear ﬁts of the NADH calibration plots, obtained by the six parameters considered
from the UV-Vis and the CV measurements in the Lactate dilutions. The slopes rep-
resent the NADH detection sensitivity by the sensors while the R2 values are a good
indicator of the linearity of the detection in the considered range.

From Fig. 4 it’s evident that the P5 and P6 parameters allow a higher sensitivity,
but the Lactate measurements in the pure urine sample shows a drastic sensitivity
reduction and a standard deviation boost, most probably caused by the interferences
observed in Fig. 1 inset.
Since the R2 values represent the linear ﬁt quality, it is interesting to notice that the
P1 and P6 show a ﬁt quality very similar to P5, which has the highest R2 as it is
formulated to maximize it. Moreover, as expected, the R2 values of the area related
parameters tend to those of P1, P5 and P6 as the portion of area is limited around the
456 mV current peak.
Another way to deﬁne the quality of the linear ﬁts is to consider the ﬁtted slope
95% conﬁdence intervals. The linear ﬁts which maximize the slope and minimize the
interval is the best candidate as CV-related parameter for the NADH sensitive quan-
tiﬁcation. Therefore, the maximization of the ratio between the slope and its conﬁdence
interval becomes an important quality factor (QF), as described in Eq. 1, and shown in
the inset of Fig. 6.

Where m is the considered parameter linear ﬁt slope, and cf 95%

Again P5 and P6 result the best parameters and the measurements in the pure urine
sample show very low values. However, the solutions which show the best ratios are 10
and 1% sample urine instead of HBRS, as could be expected.

Figure 6 shows the calibration plots and the respective linear ﬁts obtained from the
P5 parameter for the CV analysis, which proved to be the best in terms of quality of the
linear ﬁt (by deﬁnition), slope of the ﬁt (and thus NADH sensitivity), and ratio between
the slope and its 95% conﬁdence interval.

Furthermore, we have proposed several methods to analyze the CV data obtained
after the stabilization of the LDH enzyme Lactate catalysis, and thus the produced
NADH concentration. We compared these methods by evaluating their linearity, their
sensitivity, and their linear ﬁtting errors, with respect to the NADH concentration
produced by the LDH catalysis.
We found that the best CV parameters are the currents recorded at the potentials
that maximize the slope, i.e., the sensitivity (P6) of the linear ﬁt of the calibration curve,
and that maximize its R2 value (P5). Therefore, the best approach to the data analysis in
this case is to deﬁne in this way the potential by the calibration curve and then to use
this parameter for the quantiﬁcation of unknown Lactate concentrations.

Abstract. In this work, the possibility of manufacturing chemiresistive gas
sensing devices by inkjet printing different LPE (Liquid Phase Exfoliation)
graphene suspensions, formulated in standard organic solvents or aqueous
mixtures, on rigid and ﬂexible substrates has been studied. The sensing ﬁlm has
been obtained by printing a different number of graphene layers, depending on
the speciﬁc ink/substrate system. The device performances have been investi-
gated upon exposure to different concentrations of NO2 at ambient pressure and
temperature, addressing the device-to-device variation as function of the number
of printed layers and the base conductance.

Introduction
Graphene is a material with surprising properties, that catalyzed the attention of the
scientiﬁc community in the last years for its potential applications in different ﬁelds,
from electronics to sensors.
Several techniques have been investigated for the graphene fabrication. With
respect to mechanical exfoliation methods [1], which are not suited for the industrial
scalability though providing highest quality material, the processes Chemical Vapor
Deposition (CVD) [2], Chemical Exfoliation (CE) [3] and Liquid Phase Exfoliation
(LPE) [4] are the most promising for a potential large-scale production of graphene.
Anyhow, also these approaches are not discharged from some drawbacks: for instance,
the CVD, due to the high temperatures required for the synthesis of graphene, is an
energy consuming method; in addition, the material needs to be transferred from the
growth to ﬁnal substrate, with a potential degradation of the ﬁlm properties. The CE
method through the chemical reduction of graphite oxide (GO) is commonly employed
to synthesize graphene for industrial, large-scale applications thanks to the good sol-
ubility of the insulating GO in a common and simple solvent as water; as a counter-
weight, the reduction step, needed to obtain the conductive material (reduced-graphene
oxide, R-GO), leaves many structural defects in the crystal lattice, decreases the water
solubility and, additionally, generally employs highly dangerous chemicals, such as

hydrazine. In comparison with the above described methods, LPE is a more sustainable
process: it allows to produce graphene through the exfoliation of graphite in standard
organic solvents [5–7] or simply hydro-alcoholic mixtures [8]. Furthermore, LPE-based
graphene can be deposited by solution-processable techniques, like inkjet printing
(IJP), a technology which allows to selectively deposit in a controlled manner mini-
mizing the process steps and the waste materials.
In the present work, chemiresistive gas sensing devices have been fabricated by
inkjet printing different LPE graphene suspensions on rigid and ﬂexible substrates. The
device performances have been investigated upon exposure to different concentrations
of the gas NO2 in environmental conditions.
2
Experimental
Different LPE graphene-based inks have been prepared. Starting from commercial
graphite powder (Sigma-Aldrich, product 332461), a ﬁrst ink (INK1) has been for-
mulated by dispersing it in N-methyl-pirrolidone (NMP) (10 mg/mL) followed by a
sonication for 3 h, and a second ink (INK2) by using a mixture of water/isopropanol
(IPA/H2O (1:7)) as solvent and sonicating the obtained dispersion for about 48 h.
Then, each suspension has been centrifuged to remove the larger graphitic structures or
the unexfoliated ﬂakes and the surnatant has been taken as ink [9].
In order to analyze the surface morphology of the produced graphene, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) measurements have been carried out in tapping mode by the Veeco
Dimension Digital Instruments Nanoscope IV system. Moreover, the inkjet printed
material has been also investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, LEO
1530).
Commercial alumina and glossy paper substrates with interdigitated gold electrodes
have been employed as transducers.
The inkjet equipment was a Dimatix Materials Printer 2831 (DMP2831) of
FUJIFILM—USA suitable for the print of functional inks onto ﬂexible and rigid
substrates. This system uses a piezoelectric drop-on-demand technology to eject dro-
plets through a multi-nozzles printhead. The pattern of the printed sensing material was
a rectangular surface. The chemi-resistor devices have been manufactured by printing a
different number of graphene-based sensing layers, depending on the speciﬁc
ink/substrate system. After printing, in order to remove the residual solvent a thermal
treatment has been performed by keeping the devices on hot-plate at 100 °C for
15 min.
Tests for sensing measurements upon the analyte NO2 have been performed in a
stainless steel chamber placed in a thermostatic box, keeping constant the temperature
(T = 22 °C), the relative humidity (RH = 50%) and under a controlled environment at
atmospheric pressure.
The sensing analysis has been carried out by biasing the single device at 1 V.
Speciﬁcally, the measurement protocol has consisted of several sequential exposures at
different analyte concentrations, where each exposure step has been preceded and
followed by baseline and recovery phases, respectively, in inert atmosphere.

Results and Discussion
In our previous work [10], we demonstrated that IJP is able to deposit LPE
graphene-based ink in a controlled manner so as to produce sensor devices with
reproducible performances in terms of electrical response upon gas exposures. In that
case, the ink was a dispersion of graphene in NMP and the employed substrate was
alumina. Here we aim to further investigate the device-to-device variation as function
of the number of printed layers and the base conductance. Therefore, by ﬁxing the
employed materials, chemiresistive sensor devices have been fabricated by inkjet
printing the INK1 (see experimental section) onto gold/alumina transducers, and the
sensing ﬁlm has been obtained by printing a different number of overlapped layers (n).
Just after their fabrication, the device have been electrically characterized in terms of
initial resistance and sensing properties. The measurement results are summarized in
Table 1. In detail, the initial resistance (R) has been detected in inert atmosphere under
bias of 1 V, while the sensing properties have been analyzed through tests upon 10 min
long exposure to the gas NO2 and evaluating the conductance variation (DG/G0),
namely the percentage variation of the conductance with respect to its initial value
detected at the beginning of the exposure (G0).
As expected, by increasing the number of printed layers, and, hence, the deposited
material, the devices become more conductive and the DG/G0 decreases. In Fig. 1,
R and DG/G0 as function of n are reported. As it can be observed, both the parameters
are well ﬁtted by hyperbolic functions. This can be easily explained by assimilating the
device as schematized in Fig. 2, where a section of the printed layer and the electrical
contacts are displayed. Referring to that scheme, R follows the Ohm’s law, R ¼
q  l=ðw  tÞ; where q is the resistivity. Assuming that each printed layer has always the
same thickness (t0) so that the ﬁnal thickness of the sensing ﬁlm is t ¼ n  t0; then
R increases as 1/n increases. Similarly, since DG/G0 depends on the speciﬁc surface
(S/V, where S ¼ l  w is the exposed surface and V ¼ l  w  t is the volume), then also
DG/G0 increases as 1/n increases.

Moreover, in order to investigate the possibility to fabricate graphene-based sensor
devices by employing eco-friendly materials, the INK2 has been formulated by dis-
persing graphite ﬂakes in a hydro-alcoholic mixture and printed onto glossy paper
substrate.
The morphology of the printed material has been characterized by AFM analysis
and the detected phase image is shown in Fig. 3. The AFM investigation shows a
presence of restacked aggregates formed by planar-structured ﬂakes. These structures
are randomly distributed with cracks and gaps between neighbouring sheets.
SEM analysis conﬁrmed this distribution of the printed material as AFM pointed
out. By observing SEM image, displayed in Fig. 4, the deposition appears rather

The sensing property of the printed aqueous LPE-graphene chemiresistors has been
tested by exposing them gas vapours of NO2. Speciﬁcally, sequential cyclic exposures
to the analyte at different concentrations have been performed, and the device outputs
are reported in Fig. 6. As expected, during the exposure window to an acceptor analyte
gas as NO2, a conductance increase has been observed since LPE graphene is a p-type
material [9]. It is worth noting that the device does not recover to the initial conduc-
tance value, so indicating that the material is not able to completely desorb the analyte.
This also affects the sensitivity curve plotted by correlating the DG/G0 values to the
NO2 concentrations (Fig. 7).

As it can be seen, at higher concentrations of the target analyte the curve diverges
from a linear behavior, due to a poisoning effect of the sensing material. Nonetheless,
good repeatability of the electrical responses upon identical exposures have been
observed in the forward and backward cycles, as displayed in Table 2, where the
DG/G0 values upon different concentrations of NO2, ranging from 200 to 1000 ppb, are
reported.

Conclusion
In this work, we have manufactured chemiresistive gas sensing devices by inkjet printing
different LPE (Liquid Phase Exfoliation) graphene suspensions, formulated in standard
organic solvents (N-methyl-pirrolidone) or aqueous mixtures (water/isopropanol), on
rigid (alumina) and ﬂexible substrates (paper). The device performances have been
investigated upon exposure to different concentrations of NO2 and the device-to-device

variation as function of the number of printed layers to form the sensing ﬁlm and the base
conductance has been investigated. By increasing the inkjet printed layers a higher
conductivity has been obtained, and both the parameters of the initial resistance and
DG/G0 decrease with a hyperbolic behaviour.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inkjet printing can be successfully adopted
to fabricate graphene-based sensor devices by employing eco-friendly materials in
order to address a sustainable approach in the processing chain, including functional

Abstract. This work presents a thin ﬁlm device, combining, on the same glass
substrate, photosensors and long-pass interferential ﬁlter to achieve a compact
and efﬁcient sensor for biomolecule detection. The photosensors are amorphous
silicon stacked structures, while the interferential ﬁlter is fabricated alternating
layers of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide, directly grown over the photo-
sensors. The system has been optimized to effectively detect the natural
ﬂuorescence of Ochratoxin A, a highly toxic mycotoxin present in different food
commodities. In particular, the long-pass interferential ﬁlter has been designed
to reject the wavelengths arising from the excitation source (centered at 330 nm)
thus transmitting the OTA emission spectrum (centered at 470 nm). Experi-
mental results show that the ﬁlter strongly reduces the photosensors quantum
efﬁciency below 420 nm, while keeps it nearly constant at higher wavelength.

Introduction
Detection techniques of biomolecules have received and continue to receive a great
attention due to their relevance in biology, chemistry, medicine and agriculture.
Therefore, innovative methods are coming up beside the standard techniques [1]. As an
example, in food related applications, established procedures rely on enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or on chromatographic procedures. The ELISA kit [2,
3] are usually competitive enzyme immunoassays based on speciﬁc antibodies opti-
mized to cross react primarily with the target molecules, while the chromatographic
techniques rely on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), through extrac-
tion of the analyte from the sample, clean-up (or puriﬁcation) by ImmunoAfﬁnity
Columns (IAC) [4] and chromatographic analysis. ELISA based method are

friendly-to-use, less expensive and less time-consuming than HPLC techniques, which
on the other hand are much more reliable in terms of analyte quantiﬁcation.
To overcome the disadvantages of these standard methods, many research efforts
are currently committed to develop lab-on-chip (LoC) systems [5, 6], integrating on
single substrate devices and techniques for the thermal treatment [7], handling,
recognition and quantiﬁcation of biomolecules [8]. The main advantages of the LoC are
the low reagent consumption and the shortening of analysis time. These characteristics
coupled with the possibility to automatize the analysis procedure make LoCs the ideal
systems easy-to-use, low-cost and low pollution devices. However, even though LoCs
tend to be as compact as possible, their scaling down is slowed by the need of bulky
external connections [9] and off-chip detection [10].
Our work addresses the effective LoC miniaturization integrating, on the same glass
substrate, amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) photosensors [11–15] and interferential ﬁlter to
achieve on-chip detection of ﬂuorescent molecules. In particular, the integrated device
has been developed for the detection of Ochratoxin A (OTA) [16], a mycotoxin present
in different food commodities such as red wine, beer, coffee and peanuts. Indeed OTA
has received a great attention by scientists and dietary organizations, because this
mycotoxin is carcinogenic (Group 2B) [17], can have weak mutagenic effects [18] and
immunotoxicity activity in animals [19].

Device Structure
The device structure is showed in Fig. 1. The system is designed to detect the natural
ﬂuorescence of OTA molecules by means of a-Si:H photosensors.
An appropriate radiation source excites the ﬂuorescence of OTA molecules con-
tained in a solution drop, while the thin ﬁlm interferential ﬁlter, integrated onto the
structure, rejects the excitation radiation and only transmits the OTA ﬂuorescence. The
a-Si:H photosensors absorb the transmitted light and generate photocarriers collected at
Fig. 1. Device structure

the metal electrodes, giving rise to a current proportional to the number of photons and
then to the number of OTA molecules contained into the drop.
The design of photosensors and ﬁlter started from the OTA emission and absorp-
tion spectra shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum is centered at 330 nm, while the
emission spectrum is centered at 470 nm.
From these data, we infer the requirements for the excitation source, the spectral
response of the photodiodes and the interferential ﬁlter. A laser diode or a light emitting
diode, able to provide an ultraviolet light, is chosen as excitation source.
3
Amorphous Silicon Photodiodes
The photosensors used to detect the emission of OTA are a-Si:H photodiodes. Their
structure is a p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) stacked junction, deposited by Plasma
Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) at temperatures below 300 °C. The
deposition parameters are listed in Table 1.
The thicknesses and energy gaps of the different layers within the a-Si-H device
have been tuned to maximize the matching between OTA emission spectrum and
photosensor quantum efﬁciency, keeping the dark current as low as possible.
The achieved quantum yield (QY) is showed in Fig. 3 as black squares. The
measured value at 470 nm is 185 mA/W. The current density, measured in dark
conditions at 100 mV of low reverse voltage, is in the order of 10−10 A/cm2. This
reﬂects in a dark current noise in the order of few fA/cm2.

Interferential Filter Design
As can be deduced comparing Figs. 2 and 3, the quantum yield of the photosensors is
not negligible in the absorption spectrum of the OTA molecules, therefore a long-pass
ﬁlter is necessary to reject the light coming from the excitation source.
The modeled thin-ﬁlm ﬁlter is a multi-dielectric interferential ﬁlter, designed
according to Distributed Bragg Reﬂector’s theory (DBR). The periodic structure is
composed by alternating two ﬁlms with high and low refractive index. The optical
thickness of the two layers is equal to a quarter of the incident wavelength.

respectively, nl and dl are, the refractive index and the thickness of low refractive index
layer respectively, k0 = c0/f0 is the wavelength of the incident radiation.
The wavelength-pass region can be made ﬂat by setting the thicknesses of the ﬁrst
and last high-index layers equal to k0/8. The ﬁlter response has been modeled with the
IMD extension of the freeware software XOP. The chosen materials are TiO2 and SiO2
and the designed ﬁlter structure is schematically reported in Fig. 4.
The modeled transmittance (T) and reﬂectance (R), reported as continuous lines in
Fig. 5, show that the ﬁlter provides a stop-band attenuation of three orders of mag-
nitude (optical density OD = 3.0 at 340 nm). Furthermore, its cut-off wavelength (50%
of T) is 408 nm, while the roll-off (20 nm from 10 to 90% of T) permits an almost
unperturbed transmission of the OTA emission.

Experimental Results
At ﬁrst, the designed ﬁlter has been deposited by Electron Beam Physical Vapor
Deposition at 250 °C on a plain borosilicate glass. This deposition temperature is lower
than the maximum temperature reached during the a-Si:H photosensors fabrication.
The spectral characteristics of the ﬁlter have been then measured with a Perkin Elmer
Lambda 950 spectrophotometer.
The measured transmittance (T) and reﬂectance (R) are showed in Fig. 5 as blue
and green squares, respectively. An excellent agreement between measurements and
simulations has been achieved. Indeed, both the measured cut-off wavelength and the
stop-band attenuation are very close to the simulated value, thus demonstrating that the
fabricated ﬁlter satisﬁes very well the design requirements.
Finally, using the same deposition parameters adopted for the plain borosilicate
glass, the ﬁlter has been deposited directly onto the photosensors. The spectral
response, measured after the ﬁlter deposition, is reported as red squares in Fig. 3. We
can observe that the quantum efﬁciency remains almost unchanged in the OTA
emission range, while it experiments a sharp decrease at wavelength below 420 nm.
These data conﬁrm, therefore, the ﬁlter effectiveness in rejecting the excitation radia-
tion and its successful integration with the photosensors.

Conclusion
This work has reported design, fabrication and characterization of a device based on
thin ﬁlm technologies suitable for selective detection of the natural ﬂuorescence of
Ochratoxin A molecules. A multi dielectric interferential long-pass ﬁlters have been
designed through a freeware software, according to Distributed Bragg Reﬂector’s
theory. The ﬁlter, directly deposited onto an a-Si:H photosensors array, is able to reject
the excitation UV light and to transmit the OTA emission light. Indeed the ﬁlter
measurements show excellent agreement with simulations.
The photodiode quantum yield, measured before and after the ﬁlter deposition,
demonstrates the successful integration of ﬁlter with sensors and the suitability of the
system to effectively reject the excitation radiation thus accomplishing the specimen
desired. Works are currently in progress to test the performances of the integrated
device on standard samples of Ochratoxin A.

Abstract. The combination of a D-shaped plastic optical ﬁber (POF) and a
Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) receptor is an effective way to obtain a
highly selective and sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical platform,
especially suitable for the detection of chemical marker in the oil of Power
Transformers. In this work Authors present the preliminary results for deter-
mination of two important analytes, dibenzyl disulﬁde (DBDS) and furfural
(2-FAL), whose presence in the transformer oil is an indication of underway
corrosive or ageing process, respectively, in power transformers. The low cost of
the POF-MIP platforms and the simple and modular scheme of the optical
interrogation layout make this system a potentially suitable on-line diagnostic
tool for power transformers.

Introduction
Oil-ﬁlled power transformers are a key component of a Transmission and Distribution
(T&D) network. Their failure can have relevant impact on maintenance costs due to
out-of-services. Nowadays the increasing energy peak demand and its timing change
can often expose power transformers to irregular stresses and/or overloads, that can
compromise their long term integrity.
The availability of reliable and potentially low-cost sensors to be used as diagnostic
tools for detecting ageing and failures of these components is of signiﬁcant interest to
improve management of the electric power system assets. In particular, for oil-ﬁlled
transformers, the on-line continuous detection of chemical parameters (Dissolved
Gases and chemical agents) in the insulating oil could provide an early warning of

incipient failures (partial discharges, over temperature, hot spot) or of occurring
accelerated aging on dielectric parts of transformers.
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based Plastic Optical Fibers (POF) sensors are
good candidates for an on-line detection of different diagnostic markers directly in oil
environment. This methodology potentially allow to overcome problems, foreseen by
current practices, of periodical collections of oil samples from the transformer and
application of more expensive and time-consuming standard analysis (by gas chro-
matography for instance).
The SPR is an optical phenomenon that appears at a metal-dielectric interface,
widely used in a large number of sensors for label-free detection [1–4]. The Kretsch-
mann conﬁguration is widely used in practice, but the setup usually require expensive
optical equipment. Incorporating optical ﬁber makes it possible to reduce the sensor cost
and dimensions, with the possibility to integrate the SPR sensing platform in
telecommunication systems [5–8]. Using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) layer
as an artiﬁcial receptor, the rapid and selective detection of different analytes in aqueous
matrices has been demonstrated [9, 10]. Also, MIP-POF-SPR optical platform has been
demonstrated to be potentially useful for the determination of 2-furaldehyde (2-FAL)
directly in transformer oil, without any previous extraction procedure [11].
MIPs are synthetic receptors obtained by molecular imprinting methods, presenting
a number of favorable aspects for sensing in comparison to bioreceptors, as for example
antibodies, including high stability, reproducibility and low cost. They are porous
solids containing speciﬁc sites interacting with the molecule of interest, according to a
“key and lock” model [12]. Indeed, a distinctive feature of MIPs, in comparison with
other receptors, is the selectivity. Moreover, the polymer layer may contain a relatively
high density of recognition elements, included in a three-dimensional matrix, which
should help the recognition by SPR even for relatively low molecular mass molecules.
In this work, as a case-study, we experimentally analyse the behavior of a newly
developed POF-MIP-SPR multichannel sensor system, specialized for simultaneous
and selective detection of dibenzyl disulﬁde (DBDS) and 2-furaldehyde (2-FAL) in
transformer oil.

Optical Sensor System
The fabricated optical sensor system was realized removing the cladding of a plastic
optical ﬁber along half the circumference, by mechanically polishing the plastic optical
ﬁber without jacket embedded in a resin block, spinning on the exposed core a buffer of
Microposit S1813 photoresist, and ﬁnally sputtering a thin gold ﬁlm using a sputtering
machine [13].
The chosen plastic optical ﬁber has a PMMA core of 980 lm and a ﬂuorinated
polymer cladding of 20 lm, the gold ﬁlm is 60 nm thick and the thickness of the
photoresist buffer layer is about 1.5 lm. The realized sensing region is about 10 mm in
length (see Fig. 1).
The gold ﬁlm so obtained presents a good adhesion to the substrate, veriﬁed by its
resistance to rinsing in de-ionized water, and it is also easy to functionalize with
bio/chemical receptors.

The experimental measurements for the characterization of the SPR-POF sensors
have been previously carried out in different ways, i.e. spectral and amplitude mode. In
this work we have used a particular setup based on the spectral mode conﬁguration. It
consists of a halogen lamp, a beam splitter (50/50) illuminating simultaneously the two
optical chemical sensors, with different MIP (see Fig. 2a), and two identical spec-
trometers. The here used halogen lamp exhibits a wavelength emission range from 360
to 1700 nm, while the spectrum analyzer detection range was from 330 to 1100 nm.
Two spectrometers were ﬁnally connected to a computer (see Fig. 2b).

The Sensitivity in Spectral Mode Operation
In SPR sensors with spectral interrogation, the resonance wavelength (kres) is deter-
mined as a function of the refractive index of the sensing layer (ns). If the refractive
index of the sensing layer is altered by dns, the resonance wavelength shifts by dkres.
The sensitivity (Sn) of an SPR sensor with spectral interrogation is deﬁned as [13–15]:
Sn ¼ dkres
dns
nm
RIU
h

ð1Þ
Owing to the fact that the vast majority of the ﬁeld of an SPW is concentrated in the
dielectric, the propagation constant of the SPW is extremely sensitive to changes in the
refractive index of the dielectric itself. This property of SPW is the underlying physical
principle of afﬁnity SPR bio/chemical sensors.
In the case of artiﬁcial receptors, as molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs), the
polymeric ﬁlm on the surface of metal selectively recognizes and captures the analyte
present in a liquid sample so producing a local increase in the refractive index at the
metal surface. The refractive index increase gives rise to an increase in the propagation
constant of SPW propagating along the metal surface which can be accurately mea-
sured by optical means. The magnitude of the change in the propagation constant of an
SPW depends on the refractive index change and its overlap with the SPW ﬁeld. If the
binding occurs within the whole depth of the SPW ﬁeld, the binding-induced refractive
index change produces a change in the real part of the propagation constant, which is
directly proportional to the refractive index change.
The chemical sensor’s sensitivity (S) is deﬁned as the shift in resonance wavelength
per unit change in analyte concentration [16]:

Experimental Results
Measurements were simultaneously carried out on two SPR-POF-MIP optical chemical
sensors based on different MIP receptors: one for dibenzyl disulﬁde (DBDS) and one
speciﬁc for furfural (2-FAL). A rapid and selective detection of these analytes is,
actually, very important for an on-line control of oil in transformers to prevent their
damages and/or failure.
Samples were obtained by dissolving the analyte in a mineral oil (Nytro Libra)
widely used for power transformers, which does not contain DBDS and 2-FAL and is
also used as a blank.
All the measurements were carried out by dropping 30 µl of the liquid sample (oil
with analyte) directly over the two POF-MIPs sensor platform, which were maintained
in horizontal position. Steady state wavelength shift were obtained after 3 min
incubation.

Several plasmonic resonances were observed in the considered wavelength range
(300–1100 nm) of the transmission spectra, when the binding interaction occurs
between MIP and the analyte under investigation [9–11]. In this preliminary analysis
only the red-shift of the SPR resonance (in the wavelength range 700–820 nm) will be
taken into account hereafter.
Figures 3 and 4 report some preliminary results of DBDS and 2-FAL detection in
transformer oil samples, respectively. They clearly show that the resonance wavelength
is shifted to higher values (red shifted) when the DBDS (Fig. 3) and 2-FAL (Fig. 4)
concentration increases, indicating that DBDS and 2-FAL effectively combines with
MIP from the oil matrix.

Conclusions
Preliminary experimental results on a multichannel chemical SPR sensor, for the
detection of two markers (DBDS and 2-FAL) directly in transformer oil, have
demonstrated an attractive feature in industrial application. In particular, for oil-ﬁlled
transformers, the frequent control of chemical markers in the insulating oil could
provide an early warning of incipient failures (partial discharges, over temperature, hot
spot) or of occurring accelerated aging on dielectric parts of transformers [17–21].

Abstract. A performance analysis on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sen-
sor based on D-shaped Plastic Optical Fibers (POFs) is reported. It is a very low
cost sensor for determining refractive index variations at the interface between a
metallic layer and a dielectric medium. This POF-SPR optical platform can be
used in many bio and chemical applications. The advantage of using POFs is
that the sensor platforms based on POF are simpler to manufacture than those
made using silica optical ﬁbers. For low-cost sensing systems, POFs are espe-
cially advantageous due to their excellent ﬂexibility, easy manipulation, great
numerical aperture, large diameter, and the fact that plastic is able to withstand
smaller bend radii than glass. In this work the authors investigate the role of the
geometric shape of the resin block, used to obtain a D-shaped POF. In fact,
different resin blocks can produce different performances. Two different
POF-SPR sensors, based on two different geometric shapes of the resin block,
with numerical and experimental results, are presented.

trinitrotoluene (TNT) or L-nicotine, in aqueous matrices has been demonstrated [9, 10].
Also, MIP-POF-SPR optical platform has been demonstrated to be potentially useful
for the determination of 2-furaldehyde (2-FAL) directly in transformer oil, without any
previous extraction procedure [11]. In comparison with biosensors based on biological
receptors, the polymeric receptors have an improved reproducibility and shelf-life, and
a lower cost, so that they are suitable for mass production of sensors [12]. The planar
gold surface and the useful refractive index ranging from 1.33 to 1.42 are two good
factors for successful bio/chemical sensors implementation. Moreover the ﬂat surface
of the optical platform, characteristic of the D-shaped platform here proposed, makes it
possible the reproducible deposition of the receptor, particularly in the case of MIP.
The performances of the optical sensor platform (sensitivity and signal-to-noise
ratio) are very important to the implementation of the platform in bio/chemical
applications.
In this work the authors investigate the role of the geometric shape of the resin
block. In fact, different resin blocks can produce different performances. To this aim, a
numerical model of the sensor, with different sensing regions, has been developed and
subsequent experimental testing has been conducted to conﬁrm the simulation results.

The fabricated optical sensor system was realized removing the cladding of a plastic
optical ﬁber along half the circumference, by mechanically polishing the plastic optical
ﬁber without jacket embedded in a resin block, spinning on the exposed core a buffer of
Microposit S1813 photoresist, and ﬁnally sputtering a thin gold ﬁlm using a sputtering
machine [13]. In this work the authors investigate the role of the geometric shape of the
resin block. We have realized two different SPR-POF sensor platforms based on two
different geometric shapes of the resin block (see Fig. 1).
The chosen plastic optical ﬁber has a PMMA core of 980 lm and a ﬂuorinated
polymer cladding of 20 lm, the gold ﬁlm is 60 nm thick and the thickness of the
photoresist buffer layer is about 1.5 lm. The realized sensing region is about 10 mm in

The gold ﬁlm so obtained presents a good adhesion to the substrate, veriﬁed by its
resistance to rinsing in de-ionized water, and it is also easy to functionalize with

The experimental setup is arranged to measure the light spectrum transmitted
through the SPR-POF sensor and is characterized by a halogen lamp, illuminating the
optical sensor system and a spectrum analyzer (see Fig. 2). The employed halogen
lamp exhibits a wavelength emission range from 360 to 1700 nm, while the spectrum
analyzer detection range is from about 330 to 1100 nm. An Ocean Optics
USB2000 + VIS-NIR spectrometer, controlled by a computer, has been used. The
spectral resolution of this spectrometer (dkDR) was 1.5 nm (full width at half

Owing to the fact that the vast majority of the ﬁeld of an SPW is concentrated in the
dielectric, the propagation constant of the SPW is extremely sensitive to changes in the
refractive index of the dielectric itself. This property of SPW is the underlying physical
principle of afﬁnity SPR bio/chemical sensors. In the case of artiﬁcial receptors, as
molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs), the polymeric ﬁlm on the surface of metal
selectively recognizes and captures the analyte present in a liquid sample so producing
a local increase in the refractive index at the metal surface. The refractive index
increase gives rise to an increase in the propagation constant of SPW propagating along
the metal surface which can be accurately measured by optical means. The magnitude
of the change in the propagation constant of an SPW depends on the refractive index
change and its overlap with the SPW ﬁeld. If the binding occurs within the whole depth
of the SPW ﬁeld, the binding-induced refractive index change produces a change in the
real part of the propagation constant, which is directly proportional to the refractive
index change.
The resolution (Dn) of the SPR-based optical sensor can be deﬁned as the minimum
amount of change in refractive index detectable by the sensor. This parameter (with
spectral interrogation) deﬁnitely depends on the spectral resolution (dkDR) of the
spectrometer used to measure the resonance wavelength in a sensor scheme. Therefore,
if there is a shift of dkres in resonance wavelength corresponding to a refractive index
change of dns, then resolution can be deﬁned as [13–15]:
Dn ¼ dns

dkDR ¼ 1

The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of an SPR sensor depends on how accurately and
precisely the sensor can detect the resonance wavelength and hence, the refractive
index of the sensing layer. This accuracy in detecting the resonance wavelength
depends on the width of the SPR curve.
The narrower the SPR curve, the higher the detection accuracy. Therefore, if dkSW
is the spectral width of the SPR response curve corresponding to some reference level
of transmitted power, the detection accuracy of the sensor can be assumed to be
inversely proportional to dkSW.
The signal-to-noise ratio of the SPR sensor with spectral interrogation is, thus,
deﬁned as [13–15]:

Numerical and Experimental Results
Two different POF sensors, based on two different geometric shapes of the resin block,
are numerically and experimentally tested: ﬁrst, the D-shaped POF conﬁguration with a
square (cubic) resin block (see Fig. 1); second, the D-shaped POF conﬁguration with a
round (cylindrical) resin block (see Fig. 1).
Figure 3 shows the simulation of the Poynting vector, for a round (cylindrical) resin
block (see the layout with the geometry in Fig. 3, after the polishing process). The
model was made with beam propagation method (BPM). In the simulation we have
considered one wavelength and one mode, the fundamental mode (because it contains
the maximum energy). Figure 3 shows how the power increases in the middle of the
sensing area, because of the lens effect at the entrance (convergent lens). At the end of
the sensing area the lens effect is divergent and it is possible that some modes are lost in
the cladding (exceed the critical angle).
The preliminary experimental results are plotted in the Fig. 4. SPR transmission
spectra of these two different sensors with two different geometric shapes of the resin
block, when a water solution (1.332 RIU) is present on a gold layer, are reported in
Fig. 4. The results clearly demonstrate that the geometric shape of the resin block has a
relevant role in the performances of the optical platform. In particular, the square
(cubic) resin block presents a deeper resonance than the round (cylindrical) resin block.
This phenomenon is very important to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SPR
sensor.

Conclusions
In this work the role of the geometric shape of the resin block (used to obtain a
D-shaped POF) is investigated. This has been suggested by a numerical simulation
carried out considering that the sensor actually consists of different sensing regions,
possibly formed during the preparation of the sensor, in particular during the removal
of the cladding. Subsequent experimental testing has been conducted to conﬁrm the
simulation.

Introduction
Electromagnetic ﬁeld sensors are widely used in several industrial, scientiﬁc and medical
applications and can be used for measurements ofﬁelds yield by communication systems
and devices. Electromagnetic ﬁeld monitoring is a necessary task in several critical RF
communication systems, both spatially localized services as Wi-Fi or InFly Wi-Fi for
airplane connectivity, point to point communication links, medical devices for tissue
irradiation and imaging (e.g. RFA, EMT, etc.), and distributed as in radar and radio
antenna systems. The electromagnetic ﬁeld coverage of mission-critical distributed
communication systems in large area, can in turn be monitored by satellite or other
network systems for security and quality of service purposes. Recently optical ﬁber links
and fast modulators support RF photonic links [1] and distributed RF networks as in

theory is available in order to evaluate the ﬁelds, and mutual coupling between
antennas and standard probes strongly affect the measurements [3]. Therefore the
optical probe avoids the coupling of the ﬁelds with metallic structures occurring in
standard metallic probes [4], wherever measurement errors could also be caused by the
loss of antenna calibration. Optical EMF sensor thereby results dramatically less
invasive then a standard EMF probe [5], and yield a new feedback signal of the
radiated power. Optical probes enable the implementation of large-scale electric ﬁeld
monitoring for communication systems [6], providing a better power control in the
respect of the laws on electromagnetic ﬁeld limits in the far-ﬁeld, and the optimization
of the quality of service (QOS).
Expensive probes for electric and magnetic ﬁeld measurements (also in the Fresnel
region) made by dielectric materials with optical transmission lines are recently been
developed. Their measure heads need a power source and electronics in order to
(i) conditioning and processing the signals received by an external antenna, (ii) elec-
tro-optical (EO) signal conversion to drive the optical link of the measure equipment. In
recent papers [7, 8] the authors proposed an optically interrogated electromagnetic
power sensor based on an all-silicon Fabry-Perot interferometer, where detuning occurs
by the ﬁeld power dissipation in the silicon etalon. This device has a low cost and a
very simple structure but relies on the thermo-optic effect, therefore shows
low-frequency and transient response limitations. In order to overcame such limitations
we describe an integrated optical sensor for fast response electromagnetic ﬁeld sensing:
in the Sect. 2 the design and fabrication aspects, in the Sect. 3 the experimental setup
and the measurements performed.

Design and Fabrication
The mutual coupling of EMF with the standard metallic probe is the source of precision
loss, which can strongly be reduced by a completely optical probe. We propose an
integrated optical device for fast response electromagnetic ﬁeld sensing, suitable for
electromagnetic ﬁeld measurements also in the Fresnel region. The probe is based on a
resistively loaded travelling wave antenna approach operating on a wide frequency
range including ELF-UHF band.
2.1
Electric Formulation
The design of a suitable tapered antenna is derived according to the Wu-King
approximation [9]: a resistively loaded antenna, where only the progressive wave has to
be present, is characterized by an impedence distribution:
Z x
ð Þ ¼ 60gðh; k; aÞ=ðh=2  jxjÞ
ð1Þ
where:

and h is the dipole length, k is the wavelength, k = 2p=k is the wavenumber and a is
the thickness of the antenna, Ci is the cosine integral, Si is the sine integral. Z(x) can be
realized as a pure resistance because when a < k the imaginary part of g(h, k, a) is
smaller than the real part.
For this kind of antenna |Za|, the module of the antenna impedance, is a monotone
decreasing function of the frequency and can be shown that the peak corresponding to
the resonance frequency are smoothed with respect to one occurring in an ordinary
metal dipole.
Following such approach we realized a very tiny (1400 nm) Indium Tin Oxide
(ITO) resistively loaded antenna, with a ﬂat response in the frequency range considered
for the EMF probe.
2.2
The Sensor Design
The sensor is based on an integrated optical interferometer device, with input and
output optical ﬁbers respectively connecting it to a remote laser source and a fast
response photo-detector. The resistively loaded antenna, with a ﬂat response in a wide
band, yields the voltage input for an integrated modulator. This is composed of two
y-branch couplers connecting two optical waveguide arms. Several authors (e.g. [5])
improperly refer to this optical structure as Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), which
has a different optical scheme with two mirrors M, two beam-splitter and two detection
points 0 and 1, as shown in Fig. 1. The detectors reveal different signals as destructive
and constructive interference occur due to different phase shift along the optical paths.
The integrated interferometer in our sensor conversely has only one constructive
detection point at the output y-branch, and the optical signal decreases when a detuning
signal is detected.

The sensor moreover hybridize an optical device with an electric one, and can be
examined as an electric and optical transduction chain which equivalent model is given
in Fig. 2. The antenna equivalent yields the electric circuit input, it is a voltage gen-
erator V (V equals the ﬁeld E times the antenna effective length he) and two series
impedances: the antenna impedance at the gap Za with antenna loading Zl. The elec-
trodes are supplied with the signal induced by a suitable resistively loaded dipole
antenna, implementing a progressive wave in order to suppress the typical resonance of
metal dipoles.
The modulator impedance has an optical input port and an output optical port both
characterized by two efﬁciency parameters ηi, ηo, therefore it converts the electric
signal at the electrodes into an optical signal according to the Thevenin complex
equations and the optical power budget. An optimal modulator working point has been
used introducing a constant bias signal [10]. The optical probe is fabricated on a
LiNbO3 substrate with X-cut, Y-propagating waveguides substrate (with the antenna
superimposed on the modulator substrate) in order to exploit the Pockel effect which
results in a linear change of the refractive index due to an external E-ﬁeld [11].
The X-cut LiNbO3 substrate has been chosen for the much greater thermal stability
with respect to z-cut LiNbO3 interferometers, caused by pyroelectric and electrostatic
effects occurring when the temperature changes [12].
2.3
Sensor Fabrication
The optical sensor has a “push-pull” electrode conﬁguration such that a dual phase
change is induced in the interferometer arms, yielding a doubled effect in the optical
output.
Figure 2 shows a transverse section of the optical modulator. Planar optical
waveguides (the two ellipses in in the Fig. 3) were manufactured by using high energy
ion implantation technique of oxygen ions at 5 meV [13]. The substrate has X-cut,
Y-propagating waveguides, as the extraordinary index of the Z axis ne is lower than the
ordinary index no of the X axis, where the relatively large electro-optic coefﬁcient is
r33 = 32.2 pm/V. The phase shift C is:
C ¼ pVr33Ln3
e=kGEL
ð3Þ
Fig. 2. The sensor equivalent circuit model

where L is the electrodes lenght and GEL their spacing. This phase shift produces at the
constructive interference output branch an amplitude modulated optical output.
The antenna elements are made by the following process:
• Deposition of a 1.4 lm ﬁlm of ITO by sputtering on the substrate (1 mm glass);
• Deposition by spinning of reversible photoresist;
• Lithography of the ITO ﬁlm by the antenna element mask;
• Subsequent development of photoresist (negative process);
• Wet etching of ITO elements by HCl solution.
Then the antenna and modulator substrates are bonded and two micro wires are
soldered to electrically supply the modulator, and Table 1 reports a sensor
characterization.
The output of the Y branches interferometer has one constructive interference point,
therefore in the detector output we have to ﬁlter the large DC component of the signal
in order to obtain an amplitude modulated useful signal [10].

Measurement
The ﬁrst experimental setup used is shown in Fig. 4, where the source is a 150 mW in
ﬁber LASER diode (LD) at 980 nm pigtailed with a polarization maintaining ﬁber, and
multi-mode output ﬁber connecting to fast response ampliﬁed photo-detector (PD) with
a conversion gain of 200 V/W.

Performance ﬁgures will be shown: S11 parameter strongly depends on the wafer
interface to ﬁber. The optical power budget of the interferometer provides a total loss of
28 dB, obtained with accurate optical polishing. Damages in ﬁbers or near the grooves,
pigtails, connectors require an accurate optical segment rework soldering.
A power laser is necessary to match the optical power budget used in this exper-
imental phase, that is:
LT ¼ LD þ LFC þ LS ¼ 3 dB=cm  7 cm
ð
Þ þ 2  3dB
ð
Þ þ 2  0:5 dB
ð
Þ ¼ 28 dB
ð4Þ
where LT is the sum of losses due to interferometer device LD, the two ﬁber coupling
LFC and the two optical ﬁber soldering LS.
The measurements where performed both in an anechoic chamber with an
open-ended wave guide RF radiator, and in laboratory with standard dipole antennas
with anti-inductive stands. Measurement in ELF band where performed with capacitive
plane cells. The external noise measured in large band in our lab was lower than
300 mV/m, negligible with respect to the test ﬁelds used for the probe exposition.
Automated measurements were performed connecting the instruments with standard
bus for frequency response measurement.
The sensor can be designed for a suitable Vp value, in order to avoid
phase-wrapping in strong electric near-ﬁeld ﬁeld measurements.
Due to damages in the optical ﬁbers or optical interconnections, optical signal
reﬂections occurred in the measurement chain causing strong LD detuning. This
condition produced several harmonics in the optic signal and then in the output
waveform, and to detect it we substituted in the setup of Fig. 4 the oscilloscope with a
spectrum analyser; narrow and spread spectrum RF sources were characterized for
frequency selective measurements [11].

Conclusion
We propose an integrated optical probe, a small dimension devices mainly made by
non-metallic parts, thereby dramatically less invasive then standard EMF probes. This
is an appealing feature where space and time electromagnetic ﬁeld has to be detected as
in EMT [13]. A very tiny resistively loaded antenna with a ﬂat response in a wide band,

yields the electric input for the integrated optical interferometer. The sensor, its tech-
nological implementation steps and performance as well as applications to monitoring
systems are described. The proposed device technology is compatible with photonic
antennas and is a step toward an all-optical communication system. Due to the suitable
physical properties of the substrate [14], optical devices integrating the proposed sensor
with other sensor on the same complex chip [15] could be implemented in the future.

Abstract. A Brillouin Optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensor has been
used to perform distributed temperature measurements along a ﬁber optic cable
with an electrically conductive armoring heated via electrical resistance. The
thermal response of a ﬁbre-optic probe put in contact with yellow tuff samples at
different moisture content is measured by the BOTDA sensor, paving the way to
distributed measurements of moisture content in masonry materials.

Moisture Measurement by Active Thermometry
Yellow tuff is a very common building material in Campania (Southern Italy), and tuff
masonry often presents damages due to water uptake phenomenon [1, 2]. Capillary rise
can have potentially devastating consequences for buildings (biological corrosion,
worsening of indoor comfort parameters, worsening of thermal resistance, etc.).
Therefore, measuring moisture in building structures is still a current research issue.
Among the methods for non-destructive and continuous measurement of moisture
content, the heat-pulse method determines the thermal properties of a material by
monitoring the temperature transient resulting from the application of electrical heating.
As the moisture content affects the thermal conductivity of the material, the heat-pulse
method can be used to determine the moisture after proper calibration. Heat-pulse
techniques based on ﬁber-optic distributed temperature sensors (DTS) has several
advantages compared to other technologies, including the capability to monitor the
temperature at several locations simultaneously [3–8]. In addition, by using an armored
cable, the same cable can be used to perform the measurement of the temperature
through the embedded ﬁber, as well as to apply the heat pulse by injecting electrical
current in its conductive armoring. Finally, it is worth to mention that the cable can be
simply put in contact with the material, with minimum invasiveness compared to other
methods such as the hot-ball probe [9].

Experimental Results
Distributed temperature sensors (DTS) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering
(SBS) retrieve the temperature proﬁle along an optical ﬁber with high spatial resolution
and accuracy [10]. In the Brillouin Optical Time-Domain Analysis (BOTDA), a con-
tinuous wave probe signal and a frequency-shifted, pulsed pump signal are injected at
the two opposite ends of an optical ﬁber. Provided that the frequency offset between the
two waves is close to the Brillouin Frequency Shift (BFS) of the ﬁber, the two optical
waves interact via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), so that the pump ﬁeld is
backscattered reinforcing the probe ﬁeld. The gain of the emerging probe beam is
measured as a function of the time, for an interval of pump-probe frequency shifts. At
each section along the ﬁber, the local BFS is determined by ﬁtting a spectral shape to
the measured Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS). Sensing is based on the (linear) depen-
dence of the BFS from the temperature (about 1 MHz/°C).
The experimental set-up schematically shown in Fig. 1.
Light from a 1.55 lm distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode is split in two arms to
generate the pump and the probe ﬁelds. A spectral shift between the two ﬁelds is
achieved by double sideband, carrier-suppressed modulation in the upper branch: at the
modulator output, the sideband with lower frequency acts as the probe beam, while the
upper sideband is ﬁltered out through a ﬁber Bragg grating (FBG) placed before the
detector. The latter is a 125 MHz photoreceiver, connected to a data acquisition card
(DAQ) with a sampling rate of 250 MS/s. Spatial resolution is dictated by the pump
pulse duration, with a 10-ns pulse width giving rise to a 1-m spatial resolution. The
set-up allowed us to measure the temperature with a spatial resolution of 1 m, a digital
sampling step of 40 cm, an accuracy of 0.1 °C and a temporal resolution of a few
seconds.

For the experimental test, a ﬁber-optic heatable cable with a diameter of 4.0 mm
was employed. The cable comprises a central loose tube with two single-mode ﬁbers
and two multimode ﬁbers, a copper conductor with an overall cross-section of
0.83 mm2 for active sensing, stainless steel strength members and double layer poly-
amide (PA) outer sheath. The amplitude of the electrical current is a trade-off between
sensitivity and the requirement of keeping temperature disturbance at minimum, in
order to have minimal redistribution of moisture. As an example, we show in Fig. 2 the
BFS proﬁle retrieved along the ﬁber at 1-m spatial resolution and 1-min temporal
resolution, after application of a 30-A electrical pulse and with the heatable cable
exposed to air.
In Fig. 3, we show the thermal response acquired by the DTS in a point of the
heatable cable, upon the application of a 10-A electrical pulse. Note that the response
was acquired at a reading frequency of 0.14 Hz and with the cable exposed to air.
In order to calibrate our sensor for moisture content measurements in the tuff, a
relationship must be found between the moisture content and the acquired thermal
response. For soil moisture monitoring, two main approaches are being followed. The
former derives the thermal conductivity from the slope and intercept of a line ﬁt to the
temperature response following an extended heat pulse [4, 5]. Rise time or fall time (or
both) can be used to infer the moisture content. The second approach makes use of the
cumulative temperature increase over a certain period of time [6, 7], i.e.:

where Tcum is the cumulative temperature increase (°C  s) during the time of inte-
gration t0, and DT is the DTS reported temperature change from the prepulse tem-
perature, as in Fig. 3. The integral approach leverages the sensitivity to moisture
content of the overall magnitude of the temperature change. Furthermore, there is an
intrinsic improvement in sensitivity found in integral methods compared to derivative
(slope) approaches. On the other hand, the integral approach has the drawback of being
sensitive to the amount of injected energy. In particular, any change in the injected
electrical current will result in a change of the cumulative temperature, which may be
erroneously ascribed to moisture content changes. Due to this reason, we have opted
for the former (derivative) approach.
Measurements were carried out over a Neapolitan yellow tuff sample with size
37 cm  25 cm  3 cm, porosity about 50% and an oven-dried weight of 1610 g.
The tuff stone was ﬁrstly immersed into water for 24 h, in order to reach the saturated
state. The weight of the saturated tuff was 2315 g. The thermal response of the tuff was
acquired in successive tests, in order to follow the variations of thermal conductivity
with the moisture content. The moisture content was calculated in each test by
weighting the tuff stone with an electronic scale having a resolution of 5 g. Thus, we
measured the gravimetric water content (moisture) by taking the ratio between the mass
of water and the mass of the oven-dried material, while the thermal response was
acquired by the DTS and post-processed in order to determine the fall time of the
thermal response. Each measurement was carried out by applying an electrical pulse
having the same characteristics (10 A amplitude, 15 min duration) and by putting a
1-m piece of the cable in contact with the tuff sample.

active optical cable in air

We report in Fig. 4 the inverse of the fall time of the thermal response as a function
of the moisture, together with the ﬁtting (third-order polynomial) curve. As expected,
the fall time of the thermal response is inversely related to the moisture content.

Conclusions
The BOTDA technique has been used for acquiring the thermal response of an optical
ﬁber cable put in contact with a tuff sample at varying moisture contents. A heat-pulse
is applied to the sensor by injecting electrical current in the armoring of the optical
cable. The relationship between the thermal conductibility measured by the BOTDA
sensor, and the volumetric water content measured gravimetrically, has been experi-
mentally determined over samples of yellow tuff. The obtained results show that
thermal conductivity is sensitive to moisture variations, suggesting that the DTS
technology is a promising tool for moisture measurement in building materials. The
obtained results conﬁrm that the BOTDA sensor provides reliable readings of tem-
perature, which can be correlated to the water content in the tuff rock. However, further
investigation is needed in order to get more insight about the thickness of tuff rock
actually affecting the observed thermal response at the surface. Future work will be also
devoted to the design of a custom probe capable of ensuring a good and stable thermal
contact between the ﬁber cable and the sample.

Abstract. In this work a dimethoate-polypyrrole (dim-PPy) MIP ﬁlms were
electropolymerized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on the surface of glassy carbon
electrode (GCE), using pyrrole (Py) as the monomer and dimethoate (dim) as the
template. Dimethoate is electro-inactive, therefore an electroactive K3[Fe(CN)6]
solution was used as probe in the CV and square wave voltammetry (SWV) for
the evaluation of the performance of the imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted
(NIP) ﬁlms. To investigate the analytical performance of the MIP system in the
dimethoate detection, the dim-free MIP ﬁlms electrode, obtained after the
removal of the dimethoate, was placed in solutions containing dimethoate at
different concentrations for the analyte rebinding. After the rebinding step, for
the MIP ﬁlms there was a decrease of the response and the current was lower
than that for the dim-free MIP ﬁlms. The decrease of the response could thus be
used to indirectly detect the analyte quantitatively. For the NIP ﬁlms, the
response of K3[Fe(CN)6] was very small and showed no obvious difference with
different dimethoate concentrations in the rebinding step. These results illus-
trated that the dim-PPy MIP ﬁlm system is simple to construct and easy to
operate and could be used to recognize dimethoate.

Introduction
Dimethoate is an organophosphate pesticide (OP) that has an inhibitory effect on the
function of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE); the latter hydrolyses the neuro-
transmitter acetylcholine and this effect leads to a pathologic excess of acetylcholine in
the body. Toxicity of OPs affect many organs [1], particularly the nervous system [2].
Detection of organophosphate pesticides in food samples has been extensively studied
using biosensors based on AChE [3, 4]; this system is quite sensitive but the selectivity

is poor. Because of wide use and acute toxicity of OPs, it is important to develop rapid,
sensitive and selective detection methods.
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have received considerable attention in
analytical chemistry, primarily because speciﬁc recognition sites are formed in the MIP
matrix, and excellent selectivity toward the analyte is achieved [5]. Molecularly
imprinting is a process by which selected functional monomers are polymerized around
a target analyte (template). After polymerization, the template molecule is extracted and
a polymer matrix, which is complementary in shape and functionality to the template, is
obtained. Thus, the polymer has the ability to selectively link to the target analyte. The
chemical and mechanical stability, the facility of preparation and the relatively low cost
of the polymers make them attractive for several analytical applications and in some
cases they are used as replacers of natural receptors and enzymes [6]. The elec-
tropolymerization process is frequently used in the development of molecularly
imprinted electrochemical sensors. The advantages are the control of the polymer
thickness, which can be regulated by electrochemical conditions, the simple prepara-
tion procedure and the formation of very thin ﬁlms that are beneﬁcial to rapid response
[7]. The electropolymerization of polypyrrole (PPy) has been widely used for the
preparation of molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensors, due to its excellent
biocompatibility and the facility of the immobilization of different compounds [8].
In the present study, MIPs were prepared by electropolymerization of pyrrole
(Py) in the presence of dimethoate (template) on the glassy carbon electrode surface,
for the electrochemical detection of pesticide. Dimethoate (dim) is electro-inactive,
therefore an electroactive K3[Fe(CN)6] solution was used as the probe in the cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). To investigate the analytical
performance of the MIP system in the dimethoate detection, the dim-free MIP ﬁlms
electrode, obtained after the removal of the dimethoate, was placed in solutions con-
taining dimethoate at different concentrations for the analyte rebinding. After the
rebinding step, for the MIP ﬁlms there was a decrease of the response and the current
was lower than that for the dim-free MIP ﬁlms. The decrease of the response is
indirectly related to the amount of the analyte.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Chemicals and Apparatus
All the chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Pyrrole was distilled under
vacuum until a colorless liquid was obtained, purged with argon and kept in darkness at
−30 °C.
Electrochemical studies were carried out using a BASi potentiostat-galvanostat
controlled by a Bas100 Software. A three-electrode system was used for all mea-
surements: a MIP-glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter) as the working electrode, a
platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/NaCl (3 M) as the reference
electrode.

Preparation of MIP Film Electrodes and Electrochemical
Measurements
A bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was polished using 1, 0.3 and 0.05 µm alumina
paste on microcloth pads and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water until a mirror-like
surface was obtained. Then it was sonicated in 1:1 (v/v) ethanol and distilled water for
10 min. Finally the electrode was washed with distilled water and allowed to dry at
room temperature before use. Then the GCE was immersed in PBS solution containing
30 mM pyrrole and 10 mM dimethoate for the electropolymerization step by using
cyclic voltammetry in the potential range between −0.4 and +1.5 V during 10 cycles at
a scan rate of 50 mV/s. After the electropolymerization, in order to extract dimethoate
from the imprinted polymer, the dim-PPy MIP ﬁlms were immersed in a pH 2 HCl
solution and stirred for 20 min (dim-free MIP ﬁlms). The dimethoate molecules were
extracted from the polymer matrix to give a surface complimentary in shape and
functionality to the template. For rebinding step, the MIP ﬁlms after the dimethoate
removal were incubated into dimethoate solutions at different concentrations (0.01–
10 nM) for 15 min (dim-rebinding MIP ﬁlms).
Electrochemical measurements for the characterization of the electrodes were
performed by using CV and SWV in a pH 7 PBS containing 1 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] and
0.1 M KCl solution in the potential range from −0.3 to +0.8 V (CV-SWV) and from
+0.8 to −0.3 V (SWV). The K3[Fe(CN)6] was used as the probe because the
dimethoate is electro-inactive. All measurements were performed at room temperature.
A control electrode (non imprinted polymer electrode, NIP) was prepared under the
same conditions but without adding dimethoate during the electropolymerization.

Results and Discussion
The dim-PPy MIP ﬁlms were obtained by electropolymerization on the surface of GCE
using CV in potential range between −0.4 and +1.5 V during 10 cycles (scan rate
50 mV/s) in PBS solution containing 30 mM pyrrole and 10 mM dimethoate (Fig. 1).
An oxidation peak of pyrrole was observed on the ﬁrst scan at about 1 V, then the peak
decreased under continuous cyclic scans. The decrease is related to the formation of
PPy ﬁlms that hinder pyrrole monomer further access to the surface of the GCE.
Figure 2a shows cyclic voltammogram obtained with bare GCE and a well-deﬁned
redox peaks were observed. After the electropolymerization, for the dim-PPy MIP ﬁlms
no response was observed (Fig. 2b) because of the polymeric matrix and the
dimethoate molecules that cover the surface of the electrode. After washing with HCl
solution for the dimethoate removal a redox peak appeared again (Fig. 2c) because the
electrochemical probe had easier access to the electrode surface. After the template
removal, the electrode was incubated in dimethoate solution with different concen-
tration for 15 min for the rebinding step. After incubation in a dimethoate solution, a
decrease in the redox peaks currents was observed (Fig. 2d) and the current was lower
than that for the dim-free MIP ﬁlms, because of the ability of the electrode to incor-
porate again the dimethoate molecules, blocking the diffusion of the probe. DIp was the
difference between the catodic (DIpc) or anodic peak (DIpa) current of the probe at a

dim-free MIP ﬁlm electrodes and that at the dim-rebinding MIP ﬁlm electrodes. A re-
lationship between the DIp and the logarithm of the concentration was evaluated in the
range 0.01–10 nM and a linear response was observed. These results indicate that the
decrease of the response could thus be used to indirectly detect the analyte quantita-
tively. For the NIP ﬁlms, the response of K3[Fe(CN)6] was very small and showed no
obvious difference with different dimethoate concentrations in the rebinding step

because there is no recognition site for dimethoate (Fig. 3). An initial evaluation of the
selectivity of the MIP sensor was carried out using other organophophate pesticides,
such as malathion and parathion during the rebinding step. There was no signiﬁcant
decrease of the peak currents for the interferents after the rebinding step (Fig. 4),
indicating a very promising selectivity of the sensor. The reproducibility of the
MIP-GCE was estimated by determination of 5 nM dimethoate using three different
electrodes that were prepared under the same conditions. The relative standard devi-
ation was found to be 3.2% for the DIpa and 1.8% for the DIpc, demonstrating that the
preparation of sensor has a good reproducibility.

Conclusion
In this work, a MIP-GCE for the determination of dimethoate was developed, by cyclic
voltammetric electropolymerization of a polypyrrole ﬁlm on the surface of GCE. The
difference of the catodic or anodic peak current of probe (DIpc or DIpa) at electrodes
between dim-free MIP and dim-rebinding MIP ﬁlms could be used to measure
dimethoate quantitatively. The developed sensor showed a good reproducibility,
repeatability and selectivity. These results illustrated that the dim-PPy MIP ﬁlm system
is simple to construct and easy to operate and could be used to selectively detect
dimethoate in real samples.

Abstract. Self-Assembling is based on a spontaneous process in which organic
molecules (alkanethiols, silanes) are adsorbed on a substrate (gold, glass, sili-
con). Although the implementation is extremely easy, it shows a big disad-
vantage in timing, because the solution has to be in contact overnight with the
substrate under mild shaking. An alternative method of molecular deposition is
the Electrochemically Deposed Multilayers commonly used in our laboratory for
further immobilization of biological molecules in order to obtain speciﬁc
biosensors for several analytes. It consists in applying a constant potential on
gold working electrode (1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) for driving molecules in proximity
of the electrode and allow them to react on the surface and form a layer similar
to self assembled ones. Both the layers, self assembled and electrochemically
deposed ones, were tested with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and
Atomic Force Microscopy. The substrate electrochemically covered shows a
higher and a more homogeneous deposition than self assembled one and the
deposition time is extremely reduced from several hours to a few of seconds
(50 s).

Introduction
Self-Assembly is a spontaneous process in which organic molecules (alkanethiols or
silanes) are chemisorbed on a 2D substrate (gold, glass, silicon, ceramic materials as
well as Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO2 et cetera) forming a highly ordered monolayer architecture.
Self Assembled Monolayers (SAMs) of thiols behave like building elements for which
the term “nanoLego” has been coined for similarity with the toys for children. So (bio)
sensors could be designed to detect analytes as well as Hg(0), Hg(II), ochratoxin-A,
E. coli. Figure 1 shows some examples of sensing nano-structures built on gold

electrodes starting from a thiol precursor ranging from poly-oligonucleotides
(poly-thymine), antibodies (anti-ochratoxin A) and speciﬁc polymers (limonene).
Although the implementation is extremely easy, an overnight treatment after
cleaning of the substrate (Au electrodes) with cyclic voltammetry (CV) (inset in Fig. 2)
is required. By this way SAMs are deposed not only on working electrode (WE) but
also on reference (RE) and auxiliary (AE) ones. Electrochemically Deposed Multi-
layers (EDMs) are commonly adopted in our lab [1–3] for immobilization of molecular
structures in order to obtain (bio)sensors for several analytes [4–7].

Materials and Methods
Thiols, as well as Cysteamine (CYS) or 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA), were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich and deposed on a commercial gold three electrodes—
Micrux Technologies (Oviedo, Spain). The electrode cleaning, the thiol deposition and
the impedimetric analysis were obtained with PalmSens3 (Netherlands), a portable
potentiostat/galvanostat and impedance analyzer. At ﬁrst, the cleaning of Au WE was
performed with cyclic voltammetry (CV) at ±1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl pseudo-RE in
H2SO4, 0.1 M, then Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been per-
formed on the bare electrode in equimolar potassium hexacyanoferrate K3[Fe(CN)6]/

exploring a frequency range between 1 Hz and 20 kHz. The thiol deposition was made
with a 20 mM solution by self-assembling overnight or by chronoamperometry at
+1.3 V versus RE (50 s). Successively, a new EIS of the thiolated electrode was
performed. Surface analysis were obtained with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, a
Nanosurf Flex-ANA).

Experimental and Results
Constant potential drives thiols in proximity of a single AuWE (not AE or RE)
allowing addressing in an electrode array (Fig. 4) and reaction on the Au surface with
formation of an EDM in only 50 s (Fig. 2) instead of hours as needed for SAMs. Thiols
as well as cysteamine (CYS) or 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) have been deposed as
SAMs or EDMs on AuWEs.
Both the layers have been studied with EIS (Fig. 3) and AFM (Fig. 5). By com-
parison of the impedance spectra for SAMs and EDMs, we can deduce that EDMs
shows higher impedance values (Fig. 3), on the other hand, thanks to AFM images, we
establish that EDMs is thicker (Fig. 4) than SAMs. SAM shows Au electrodes poorly
covered with a thinner ﬁlm with holes where the bare Au electrode is exposed (poor
electrochemical performances of further obtained biosensors). On the contrary the
substrate covered with EDMs shows a more homogeneous and smooth surface
(Table 1).

Conclusions
EDMs are faster to realize (in 50 s) than SAMs (overnight). They allow molecular
addressing on a speciﬁc electrode in an array for obtaining multiparametric biosensors.
Nano-structures can be easily removed from gold surface at −1.3 V versus RE allowing
reversible deposition of new molecules on gold electrode [3]. Additionally, the mul-
tilayer offers a higher impedance in EIS although is thicker and more homogeneous
than SAMs. Furthermore, the EDMs surface is smoother with a minor number of holes
as described by several roughness parameters as Ra, Rt, Rp and Rv.

Abstract. We report a simple and original method to synthesize gold
nanoparticles in which a fungal protein, the hydrophobin Vmh2 from Pleurotus
ostreatus, mixed to cetyltetrammonium bromide (CTAB) has been used as
additional component in a one-step synthesis, leading to shell-like hybrid
protein-metal nanoparticles (NPs). The nanoparticles have been characterized by
ultra-violet/visible and infrared spectroscopies, and also by electron microscopy
imaging. The results of these analytical techniques highlight nanometric sized,
stable, hybrid complexes of about 10 nm, with a micelles-like hydrophobins
rearrangement.

Introduction
Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) are attracting considerable interest as viable biomedical
materials and the research effort about this subject is continuously growing, due to their
unique physical and chemical properties [1–4].
The utilization of biomolecules to tune the surface properties and the assembly of
AuNPs is a very attractive approach that has received considerable attention: this
technology combines the advantages of green chemistry, since harmless biological
substances are used instead of some aggressive chemical compound, with the unique
properties of biological probes, leading to a next generation of nanometric complexes.
Biomolecules and/or biopolymer-conjugated AuNPs are largely used as biomarkers in
diseases early detection and as in vivo drugs delivery vehicles in medicine/pharmacy
applications, and also in cosmetic products [5, 6].
In the past decades, many synthetic strategies have been developed to prepare
AuNPs in organic or aqueous solvent [7, 8]. A commonly employed method for

synthesis of AuNPs involves the use of cetyl-tetrammonium bromide (CTAB) as the
best candidate among different surfactants with the scope of stabilizing the metallic
nanoparticle in solution.
The ionic detergents can be usefully exploited as stabilizers agents during the
synthesis of nanoparticles, since they not only prevent particles aggregation but also
help in tuning their functional properties. To date, a variety of stabilizers have been
employed for the synthesis of AuNPs [1, 9, 10]. In general, surfactants play an
important role in contemporary pharmaceutical biotechnology, since they are largely
utilized in various drug dosage forms to control wetting, stability, bioavailability,
among other properties [11, 12]. Association colloids such as micelles, on the other
hand, can form spontaneously under certain conditions (self-assembling systems), and
are thermodynamically more stable towards both dissociation and aggregation [13].
This work presents new synthesized hybrid nanoparticles as possible tools for
biological applications by using fungal proteins called hydrophobins (HFB). HFB are
small (about 100 amino acid residues), amphiphilic, highly surface-active, and
self-assembling proteins [14] with different roles in the fungal growth and develop-
ment. Indeed their biological functions are linked to the reduction of the water surface
tension, and to their ability to self-assemble into an amphipathic membrane when they
reach an interface, thus allowing fungi to escape from aqueous environment and to
facilitate air dispersal of the spores [15, 16]. On the surface of the folded molecules,
there is a coherent hydrophobic patch, which makes the molecule amphiphilic. The
amphiphilicity gives the protein the ability to strongly stick to hydrophobic surfaces
[17], forming a highly stable coating which can be used to promote biocompatibility
[18–21], and as an intermediate to attach cells, proteins, or other type of molecules to
surfaces.
In this work, HFB Vmh2 puriﬁed from Pleurotus ostreatus was used. The prop-
erties of Vmh2 were studied at the air-water interface, at surfaces, and in solution. We
engineered hybrid nanoparticles in which Vmh2 molecules formed a nano-complex
with cationic surfactant as CTAB, thus changing chemical and optical properties of Au
nanoparticles.

L ﬂasks containing 500 mL of potato-dextrose broth (24 g/L) supplemented with 0.5%
yeast extract, grown at 28 °C in shaken mode (150 rpm). After 10 days of fungal
growth, mycelia were separated by ﬁltration through gauze, treated twice with 2% SDS
in a boiling water bath for 10 min, washed several times with water and once with 60%
ethanol to completely remove the detergent. The residue was dried under nitrogen,
grinded and treated with 100% triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) in a water bath sonicator
(Bandelin Sonorex Digitec) for 10 min. The supernatant was dried, dissolved in 60%
ethanol and centrifuged (10 min at 3200 g). The new supernatant was lyophilized, and
lipids were extracted in a mixture of water-methanol-chloroform 4:4:1 v/v (5 min in
bath sonicator). After centrifugation, proteins appeared as a solid aggregate at the
interface. They were recovered by upper phase removal, methanol addition and cen-
trifugation. The precipitate was again dried, treated with TFA for 30 min in bath
sonicator, re-dried, and dissolved in 80% ethanol. This sample was centrifuged (90 min
at 12,000 g) and the supernatant dried, treated with TFA as above-described and
re-dissolved in 60% ethanol.

Synthesis of Hybrid CTAB-Hydrophobin Gold Nanoparticles
(Hyb-CTAB-HFB-AuNPs)
CTAB-HFB-AuNPs were prepared using 5 ml of HFB solution (150 lg/ml) mixed
with 5 ml of CTAB solution (10−4M) and then added 5 ml of 0.0001 M aqueous
HAuCl4 solution for 10 min. To the resulting solution 1.8 ml of NaBH4 (0.01 M) was
added dropwise followed by rapid stirring. After 1 h without agitation, the solution
became red-violet. The product was centrifuged and puriﬁed at the same conditions.

UV/Vis Measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-570 UV/VIS/NIR Spectropho-
tometer from Jasco Int. Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. 1 mL of nanoparticles solution were
acquired in the range between 200 and 800 nm after 60 min from synthesis.
2.5
TEM Measurements
Transmission electron microscopy measurements were recorded on a JEOL JEM 1011
microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The TEM graphs were
taken after separating the surfactant from the metal particles by centrifugation. Typi-
cally 1 mL of the sample was centrifuged for 20 min at a speed of 14,000 rpm/min.
The upper part of the colourless solution was removed and the solid portion was
re-dispersed in 1 ml of water. 2 lL of this re-dispersed particle suspension was placed
on a carbon coated copper grid and dried at room temperature.

PM-IRRAS Measurements
PM-IRRAS spectra were recorded on a commercial Thermo (Les Ulis—France) Nexus
spectrometer. The external beam was focused on the sample with a mirror, at an
optimal incident angle of 80°. A ZnSe grid polarizer and a ZnSe photoelastic modu-
lator, modulating the incident beam between p- and s-polarizations (HINDS Instru-
ments, PEM 90, modulation frequency = 37 kHz), were placed prior to the sample.
The light reﬂected at the sample was then focused onto a nitrogen-cooled MCT
detector. The presented spectra result from the sum of 128 scans recorded at a 8 cm−1
resolution. Each spectra shown represent the average of three measurements.

tions, and then reducing tetraclororoauric acid (HAuCl4) by sodium borohydride
(NaBH4). TEM images of HFB-CTAB-AuNPs show nanoparticles with an average
size of 10.0 ± 0.9 nm (Fig. 1). Conventionally surfactants such as CTAB typically
form spherically shaped micelles at low concentration [18].
As reported by earlier authors [7], the extraordinarily strong binding of AuBr2−to
the positive CTA+ head group could stabilize the Au+ species in aqueous solution. This
is due to the cooperative effect of micelles and Br−, which favored the emergence of
soluble Au+ species. In the beginning, a small part of Au+, disproportionate to Au3+
and Au0 species where the complexion between Au3+ and Br−in the presence of CTAB
micelles resulted in the appearance of yellowish-red solution [7]. The binding on
cationic surfaces was proposed to be due to local charge-charge interactions and as a
result, local charges on the surface of the protein were of greater interest than the
overall isoelectric point of the protein. For this reason, when HFB molecules were
mixed with CTAB solution, the charged residues opposite to the hydrophobic patch of
the amphiphilic HFB proteins were thought to interact with the polar surface of CTAB
in such a way as the hydrophobic patch was turned outwards against the solution
resulting in a hydrophilic coating of the gold surface (see Fig. 2).

This steric arrangement of HFB in CTAB micelles before reduction of HAuCl4
during synthetic process of gold nanoparticles, was conﬁrmed by PM-IRRAS analysis,
reported in the following.
CTAB-HFB-AuNPs (Fig. 3 green curve) showed a strong resonance band at
around 530 nm and a weaker one at 300 nm. This optical behavior was due to steric
arrangement like inverse micelle of HFB into CTAB as stabilizers during synthetic
process.

The infrared spectrum of CTAB-HFB-AuNPs (Fig. 4 curve 3) shows a peak at
1460 cm−1 attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric C–H scissoring vibrations of
CH3–N+ moieties and to the CH2 scissoring mode, respectively due to the presence of
CTAB. The peaks centred at 2920 and 2850 cm−1 are assigned of C–H vibration
stretching mode of CH2 and CH3 groups respectively. The region corresponding of
amide bands is very attenuated. This result is in agreement of UV-Vis spectra in which
the absorption peak of HFB is very weak, probably due to a steric arrangement of HFB
protein into micelles of CTAB.

Conclusions
In the present work we showed that hybrid HFBAuNPs can be synthesized via a simple
one step method. The key role of the HFB molecules during the growth process of
nanoparticles was investigated by mixing with cetyltetrammonium bromide as standard
surfactant in the synthesis. Stable nanometric hybrid protein-organic-metal NPs have
been obtained, with average diameter of 10 nm. These results open a route to simple,
effective, and also green chemistry synthesis of a new class of hybrid multipurpose NPs
which will be tailored for different biomedical application, such as imaging, targeting
and drugs delivery.

Abstract. An all polymeric platform based on planar microring resonator
employing a microﬂuidic ﬂow-through approach is presented and exploited for
biosensing applications. A micromilled hole in the center of the microring
resonator drives the analyte ﬂow towards the sensing surface, so optimizing the
transport kinetic. A simulated and experimental evaluation of the improved
performances in terms of kinetic transport and response time is also presented.
Biosensing experiments with bovine serum albumin (BSA) based solutions at
different concentrations are performed. Optical characterizations by resonance
peak shift show a linear behaviour up to 200 nM and a saturation condition at
higher concentrations in SU-8 based microring resonators. A reduction of more
than 4 times of the response times, as compared with the standard ﬂow-over
approach, is obtained with the proposed ﬂow-through approach. The proposed
sensing architecture, allowing the single addressing of ring resonator, gives
numerous advantages related to time responses and multiplexing of different
analytes for a label-free biosensing.

Introduction
Detection of bioanalytes is becoming a prominent interest for different ﬁelds of
application such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and diag-
nostics. Among the various sensing approaches, one of the most promising is based on
optical microring resonator for label-free analyte detection. Microring resonators are
constituted by a ring-shape waveguide structure, evanescently coupled with one or
more linear waveguides. Microring resonators support wave resonant modes that
recirculate along the ring, allowing a repeated interaction with the surrounding sample
medium. The surface sensing, involving the binding of analyte molecules on the sensor
surface, modiﬁes the effective refractive index of the guided mode and, hence, the
resonance wavelengths. Microring resonators offer different advantages such as
label-free and high integration capability, thanks to standard fabrication photolitho-
graphic techniques, for a simple lab-on-chip integration [1, 2].

Usually, the ﬂuidic approaches employed in microﬂuidic sensors are two: ﬂow-over
and ﬂow-through. In the ﬂow-over approach the liquid ﬂows in a microchannel parallel
to the sensor surface and the analyte diffuses towards the sensor surface. In the
ﬂow-through approach, instead, the analyte ﬂows orthogonally to the sensor surface
being driven towards the sensing surface. This conﬁguration can, hence, signiﬁcantly
improve the detection time thanks to the efﬁcient transport of the analyte [3].
In this work, biosensing experiments with microring resonators in a ﬂow-through
conﬁguration, realized by means of a precise hole drilled in the center of the ring, are
exploited. The processing feasibility of the polymeric materials with mechanical
micromilling systems allows a unique, simple and precise method for the realization of
the micro-hole on the ﬁnal sensing device. The biomolecule sensing capability is
demonstrated by using BSA protein at different concentrations. The red shift of the
resonance peak is then correlated to the BSA concentration, obtaining a calibration
curve of the devices. The sensor response times are also evaluated and an improving of
more than four times is demonstrated in ﬂow-through conﬁguration respect to
ﬂow-over one.

poly(methyl

alcohol and dried on hot plate at 70 °C for 30 min. Negative SU-8 2002 (Microchem
Corp.) is spin-coated at 3000 rpm onto PMMA substrate to obtain 2 µm thick layers.
A pre-bake of 10 min at 70 °C to evaporate the solvent is followed by UV curing by
direct laser writing photolithographic process. After the UV exposure, the ﬁlm is
post-baked for polymer crosslinking. The ring resonators have a diameter of 280 µm
and are coupled with a straight bus waveguide, 3 lm wide and 2 lm height preserving
the monomodal condition at 1550 nm.
High precision computer numerical control (CNC) micromilling machine is
employed for the realization of 240 µm diameter holes in the centre of the ring
resonators.
The microﬂuidic channel (500 µm width and 100 µm height), used to deliver the
sample to the ring, is manufactured in PDMS by a standard replica molding process.
For biosensing experiments, bovine serum albumin (BSA, molecular weight
66 kD) is dissolved at different concentrations in deionized water and stirred for
20 min at ambient temperature before using.
A ﬁbre coupled tunable laser, over a range of wavelengths 1545–1565 nm, is used
to interrogate the ring resonators.
Syringe pumps are used to dispense precise amount of analytes at different ﬂow
rates. The tubing are connected to the chip by steel needles, with an outer diameter of
500 lm and inner diameter of 260 lm, glued to the inlet of PDMS based microﬂuidic
part.

Results and Discussions
The schema of the experimental setup is reported in Fig. 1. The polymeric ring res-
onator is top-sealed by the PDMS microchannel. In the ﬂow-over conﬁguration the
analyte ﬂows parallel to surface (Fig. 1a) while in the ﬂow-through conﬁguration
passes through the drilled hole in the center of the ring (Fig. 1b).
Finite element method (FEM) simulations by using COMSOL Multiphysics soft-
ware are performed for both ﬂow-over and ﬂow-through conﬁguration. The steady state
ﬂow proﬁles obtained by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation by using
a 3D model for both conﬁgurations are reported in Fig. 2. The left side channel is used
as inlet in order to inject a water based solution (density q = 1000 kg/m3) with a ﬂow
rate of 6 µL/min. The outlet was set to ﬁxed-pressure boundary condition. The ﬂow
over scheme (Fig. 2a) the ﬂow has a parabolic proﬁle with a fast convective ﬂow in the
centre of the microchannel and a very slow ﬂow near the sensing surface. In the
ﬂow-through conﬁguration (Fig. 2b) the analyte is driven towards the bottom, passing
through the hole, with an increasing of the convective ﬂow around the sensing surface.
The presence of a ﬂow velocity different from zero near the sensing area in the
ﬂow-through conﬁguration modify the transport kinetic of the analyte that is more
efﬁciently collected in the sensing area respect to ﬂow-over one. As results, the
response times of both conﬁgurations are signiﬁcantly affected from the transport
kinetic and it is absolutely predictable a reduction of the response time in the
ﬂow-through approach.
Having conﬁrmed the feasibility of our approach, we study the sensor response in
the ﬂow-over and ﬂow-through conditions at ﬁxed ﬂow rate.
In Fig. 3a is reported an example of transmission spectrum of the polymeric
microring resonator measured around 1560 nm. The highest Q factor, estimated by
evaluating the linewidth full width at half maximum of the Lorentzian-shaped dips, is
about 5.7  103. The main aspect that limits the Q-factor can be ascribed to the
roughness on the ring sidewalls, an intrinsic effect of the direct writing system. Nev-
ertheless, this Q-factor value is widely suitable for the biosensing experiments to be
performed.
The calibration curve in biosensing experiments is measured by pumping in
ﬂow-over condition the BSA solutions and evaluating the resonance peak shift respect

conﬁgurations

to zero concentration. The results are reported in Fig. 3b. The experimental points are
well ﬁtted with a sigmoidal curve, a clear indication of binding site limited reactions.
The sensor response is almost linear up to 200 nM and saturated at higher concen-
tration, a clear indication of a full coverage of the surface with the BSA molecules. The
surface mass detection sensitivity can be estimated by the following equation:
Sm ¼ Dk
rp
ð1Þ
where Dk is the peak shift at the saturation condition and rp is the surface density of
the molecular monolayer of BSA. The measured Dk is equal to 132 pm while the
surface density of the molecular BSA layer is rp = 2.96 ng mm−2 [4], giving a cal-
culated sensitivity of Sm = 44.6 pm ng−1 mm2.
The dynamic experiments for biochemical sensing of 20 nM BSA solution are
performed on both ﬂow-over and ﬂow-through conﬁgurations with ﬂow rate of 6 µL
min−1. The results of the experiments are reported in Fig. 4. The evaluated sensor
response times, deﬁned as the rise time to move from 10 to 90% of the equilibrium

value, are 14.8 and 4.1 min for ﬂow-over and ﬂow-through, respectively. The analysis
indicates an improvement factor of more than 4 times of the response time for the
active conﬁguration. Indeed, an active transport of the molecules is achieved in the
ﬂow-through case, which enables a greater number of analyte molecules to reach the
sensor respect to ﬂow-over conﬁguration, so reducing the response times.

Conclusions
The successful realization of a polymeric platform based on ﬂow-through approach of
all polymer microring resonators has been reported. A drilled hole in the center of the
microring resonator signiﬁcantly modify the ﬂow proﬁle, improving the transport
kinetic respect to standard ﬂow-over one. Preliminary biosensing experiments,
employing BSA protein, are performed on both conﬁgurations and the response times
are also measured. The analysis highlights that the ﬂow-through approach led to a
reduction of the sensor response time of more than 4 times respect to standard
conﬁguration.

Abstract. This work combines a lab-on-chip device with an electronic system
for the achievement of a small-scale and low-cost thermal treatment of bio-
molecules. The lab-on-chip is a 1.2 mm-thick glass substrate hosting thin ﬁlm
resistor acting as heater and, on the other glass side, amorphous silicon diodes
acting as temperature sensors. The electronic system controls the lab-on-chip
temperature through a Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm. In particular,
an electronic board infers the temperature measuring the voltage across the
amorphous silicon diodes, which are biased with a constant forward current of
50 nA, and drives the heater to achieve the set-point temperature. The charac-
terization of the whole system has been carried out implementing the thermal
cycles necessary in the polymerase chain reaction technique for ampliﬁcation of
DNA. To this purpose, the lab-on-chip has been thermally coupled with another
glass hosting a microﬂuidic network made in polydimethilsiloxane, and the time
evolution of temperature has been carefully monitored. The measured perfor-
mances in terms of heating rate, cooling rate and settling time demonstrate that
the proposed system completely fulﬁlls the requirements of the investigated
biological application.

Introduction
Lab-on-chip (LoC) technology is receiving a lot of attention thanks to their potential
applications in biology and in genomics. The strength of these devices relies in the
integration of multiple functionalities in a single chip [1, 2].
The development of LoC devices for biochemical analysis has several advantages
including reduced volume of reagents and samples, portability, and low power

consumption [3–6]. Several clinical diagnostics techniques, such as Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) or cell lysis, require thermal treatments of the analyte [7–9], and
therefore the temperature control is a critical parameter in managing many physical,
chemical and biological applications. The thermal power can be provided by a bulky
metal block thermally coupled with the LoC or by an integrated thin ﬁlm heater. The
standard on-chip heating approach uses a thin metal ﬁlm (i.e. platinum) as both heater
and temperature sensor, taking advantage of the resistance temperature dependence
[10]. This way presents many advantages but is limited by the resistance temperature
coefﬁcient (TCR) of the heater: for some conductor the TCR is very low and in these
cases is hard to obtain a good sensitivity. Furthermore, it is impossible to infer local
information as the temperature in different points of the heated area since the resistor
variation depends on the average temperature of the whole heater surface. Another
approach relies on the integration of thin ﬁlm temperature sensors and thin ﬁlm heater
in the same LoC to achieve high sensitivity regardless of the heater material [11].
In this context, we present the integration of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n
structure and thin ﬁlm heaters on the same glass substrate combined with a compact
electronic board able to drive the heaters and monitor the temperature measuring the
drop voltage across the diodes. Indeed, a-Si:H diodes are appealing as thin ﬁlm tem-
perature sensor since the voltage across them varies linearly with the temperature, when
they are biased with a constant current, with a sensitivity greater than those found in
crystalline silicon [12].

System Description
The proposed system, whose block diagram is depicted in Fig. 1, is constituted by the
following components:
1. a lab-on-chip device;
2. an electronic board that controls the lab-on-chip temperature;
3. a software that controls the electronic circuit board.

A Graphical User Interface was developed in order to control all the functionalities
of the electronic board. In particular, the set-point temperature (speciﬁed by the user) is
achieved using a software Proportional-Integral-Derivative algorithm, which takes, as
input, the temperature inferred by the diode. This is possible since the voltage across
the diode varies linearly with the temperature when it is biased with a constant current.
The output of the software is then used to provide a controlled current to the heater. The
following parts of this section report the detailed descriptions of the lab-on-chip device
and the electronic circuit board.
2.1
Lab-on-Chip System
The LoC integrates on a 1.2 mm-thick glass substrate different thin ﬁlm technologies in
order to develop a multifunctional platform suitable for thermal treatments. In partic-
ular, a 5  5 cm2 glass substrate hosts:
• a thin metal ﬁlm acting as heating sources on one side of the glass;
• a set of a-Si:H diodes, acting as temperature sensors, to monitor the temperature
distribution on the active area of the heater.
A cross section of the fabricated device is shown in Fig. 2.
2.1.1
Heater Design, Fabrication and Characterization
The thin ﬁlm metal resistor, deposited on a glass substrate, features an area comparable
to the active area of the thermal treatment and low power consumption. The selected
materials and thicknesses, determining the value of the electrical resistance, are mainly
deﬁned by the power requirement, while the resistor geometry is determined by the
speciﬁcation of uniform spatial temperature distribution over the thermal process area.
Starting from the results published in previous works [13], we have developed a double
concentric spiral with a heated area of about 120 mm2.
The heater geometry was designed using ﬁnite element simulations with COMSOL
Multiphysics software, coupling the electrical and the thermal problems with the Joule
effect and obtaining the temperature proﬁles due to a potential difference applied across

the resistor. Basing on the simulations results, the thin ﬁlm heater has been fabricated
through vacuum evaporation of a 100/600/100 nm-thick Chromium/Aluminum/
Chromium stacked layer and deﬁned by conventional photolithography using the
mask depicted in Fig. 3. The 5  5 cm2 glass substrate hosts two mirrored heaters with
elliptical shape. Each heater has four electrical contacts: the two external pads provide
the current, while the voltage is measured between the internal ones. The obtained
resistance was around 11 Ω.
An infrared thermo-camera (FLIR A325) has been used to measure the thermal
distribution over the heated area in steady state condition. Results obtained applying a

voltage equal to 2.9 V to the heater are reported in Fig. 4 in color scale. The elliptical
shape, where the temperature is uniform, reproduces the heater geometry. In particular,
inside the area (120 mm2) deﬁned by the dashed red line, an average temperature of
338 K with a standard deviation of ±1 K is achieved.
2.1.2
Sensors Fabrication
On the other side of the glass, the a-Si:H devices have been fabricated through Plasma
Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and standard microelectronic tech-
niques (evaporation, sputtering, photolithography and etching). In particular, the fab-
rication steps are the following:
1. vacuum evaporation of 30/150/30 nm-thick Cr/Al/Cr stacked layer, which acts as
bottom contact of the diodes;
2. patterning of the metal stack by conventional photolithography and wet etching
process;
3. deposition by PECVD of the a-Si:H stacked structure n-type/intrinsic/p-type;
4. deposition by vacuum evaporation of a 50 nm-thick chromium layer, which acts as
top contact of the sensors;
5. wet etching of the chromium and dry etching of the a-Si:H layers for the mesa
patterning. The area of the diodes is 0.8  0.8 mm2;
6. deposition by spin coating of a 5 µm-thick SU-8 3005 (from MicroChem, MA,
USA) passivation layer and its pattering for opening via holes over the diodes;
7. deposition by sputtering of a 150 nm-thick titanium/tungsten alloy layer and its
patterning for the deﬁnition of the top contacts and of the connection to the pad
contacts;
8. deposition by spin coating of a 5 µm-thick SU-8 3005 passivation layer.

Electronic Circuit Board
The electronic board includes:
• a power circuit that drives the heater with the current required to achieve the
speciﬁed temperature;
• a power circuit that drives a fan used to enhance the cooling of the LoC during
thermal cycles;
• an electronic circuit that biases the diode at a constant current and reads the diode
voltage.

In order to drive the thin ﬁlm resistor we have used a simple current generator
driven by a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). The schematic of this electronic board
section is reported in Fig. 5.
The most of the current that ﬂows in the heater comes from the collector of the
transistor Q2 (BD245C from Bourns®) that is a NPN silicon power transistor with very
high maximum continuous collector current (10 Amps) and a minimum forward current
transfer ratio (hFE) of 20. Taking into account this small value of the hFE, we decided to
use the Darlington conﬁguration adding to the circuit the transistor Q1 (PN2222 from
Fairchild Semiconductor), which is a general-purpose small signal transistor.
The operational ampliﬁer is the TS921 from STMicroelectronic. This is a rail-to-rail
single BiCMOS operational ampliﬁer that exhibits very low noise, low distortion and
low offset. The current provided to the heater is set by the MCP4821 converter (from
Microchip), which is a single channel 12-bit DAC. The devices operate from a single
2.7–5.5 V supply. A Serial Peripheral Interface allows us to control the DAC through a
PIC18F4550 microcontroller (also from Microchip). The device has a high precision
internal voltage reference (VREF = 2.048 V), and the user can conﬁgure the full-scale
range to be 2.048 V or 4.096 V.
The value chosen for the sense resistance Rsense is 0.2 Ω, while the values of R1 and
R2 are respectively 1 and 36 kΩ. With these values, we achieved a maximum driving
current of 550 mA.
The same topology of circuit has been used to drive the fan that is necessary to
quickly cool the LoC when thermal cycles are required.

The circuit that infers the heater temperature through the a-Si:H diode is instead
depicted in Fig. 6. It drives the diode with a constant current in forward condition and
at the same time reads the voltage across the diode. A detailed description of the circuit
mode of operation was reported in [14].
Brieﬂy, a voltage reference of 2.5 V (provided by the REF192 from Analog
Devices) is partitioned with the resistances R8 and R9 obtaining a voltage reference for
the circuit equal to

module allows us to control all the functionalities of the electronic board with a
common personal computer equipped by the developed GUI.

Experimental Results
This section reports the performances of the whole system during the thermal cycles of
a PCR experiment.
3.1
System Calibration
In order to control the temperature of the LoC system, we performed a preliminary
calibration of the a-Si:H diodes combining the realized system and the FLIR A325. We
monitored the temperature of the diode through the thermo-camera while the electronic
board kept constant the temperature of the diode actuating the developed PID control
on the heater and simultaneously recording the diode voltage.
Measurement results are reported for one diode in Fig. 7. Equation inside the ﬁgure
is the linear ﬁtting of the measured values. The slope of the ﬁtting straight line (about

0.31 K/mV) represents the inverse of the diode thermal sensitivity, which is around
3.2 mV/K. Taking into account the minimum voltage variation that the ADC can
discern (see Eq. (3)) and the diode sensitivities, the minimum temperature change that
can be detected by our system is around 3 mK. This value satisﬁes the requirements of
the routine biological applications, which demand, at mostly, to monitor temperature
change of tens of degrees.
3.2
Testing of the Whole System
The performances of the developed system have been characterized through the
implementation of a Polymerase Chain Reaction experiment, suitable for DNA
ampliﬁcation. In particular, the test has been accomplished carrying out the standard
three-temperature cycling technique. In this approach, each PCR cycle consists of the
melting of the double-stranded DNA (around 370 K), annealing of the speciﬁc primers
to their target gene (usually between 323 and 338 K) and extension of primers with
thermo-stable polymerase enzymes such as Taq polymerase (around 345 K).
In order to reproduce the operating conditions of a PCR experiment, the LoC has
been thermally coupled with another glass hosting a microﬂuidic network made in
polydimethilsiloxane (PDMS). In this way, apart from the few microliters of biological
solution contained in the microﬂuidic network, this set-up includes all the elements to

implement the DNA ampliﬁcation through the PCR technique. A picture of the com-
plete setup is shown in Fig. 8.
The sensor temperature during the PCR experiment is shown in Fig. 9. The inset
shows a detail of one PCR cycle. Each cycle foresees 30 s at 329 K, 30 s at 349 K and
30 s at 375 K. The time evolution of the reported curves, and in particular the fall time,
the rise time and the setting time, depends on the temperature control performed
through the PID algorithm. We found that the rise rate was 2 K/s and that the fall rate,
controlled by the fan, was 1 K/s. Furthermore, the curve showed absence of overshoot
and a displacement from the set-point temperature below ±0.5 K.
These values meet the characteristics of the standard thermo-cyclers used for the
PCR experiments in the biological laboratories and therefore demonstrate the suitability
of the proposed LoC for thermal treatments of biomolecules.

Conclusions
This work has presented a very compact system able to perform controlled thermal
treatments of biomoleculels. It is based on thin ﬁlm technologies to avoid the use of
bulky external metal block heaters. In particular, the realized lab-on-chip integrates on
the same glass substrate thin ﬁlm metal heaters on one side and amorphous silicon
diodes, acting as temperature sensors, on the other side.
The experimental characterization of the single electronic devices (thin ﬁlm heater
and a-Si:H diodes) and of the whole system has demonstrated that the proposed LoC
fully satisﬁes the requirements for the implementation of the PCR technique, the
nowadays prevalent biological process for DNA ampliﬁcation.

Abstract. The aspect of food quality is of increasing interest for both con-
sumers and food industry. Detection of chemical contaminants and speciﬁc
quality-related components are required. In this sense, biosensors can play a
prime role, because these devices allow cheap and continuous monitoring of
contaminants along the pasta production chain and are also useful to identify
allelic variants of genes coding for protein associated to bad or good quality of
wheat end-products. In this work we report the production of a whole-cell
biosensor based on bacterial cells genetically modiﬁed to respond to the pres-
ence of metal ions by ﬂuorescence or luminescence emission, and of a biosensor
based on Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR), that is able to detect
nucleic acid sequences characterizing different allelic variants.

Introduction
Important

end-products are mainly related to the quality of grains, that are in turn due to the
genetic background, but are also strongly inﬂuenced by environmental factors and crop
management. An important environmental factor affecting quality is the presence of
metal ions as food contaminants deriving from the growing environment or released by
the processing industry. Reliable analytical methods for the detection and quantiﬁcation
of chemical contaminants and for the determination of genetic quality-related com-
ponents are required: in this sense, biosensors can play a prime role. In general
biosensors are analytical devices composed by a biological recognition element asso-
ciated to a physical transducer generating a signal proportional to analytes concen-
tration. The aim of this work is the development of biosensors for the detection of
factors inﬂuencing quality of durum wheat end-products. We started the development
of two kinds of biosensor based on different biological recognition devices: a
whole-cell biosensor for the detection of metal ions and a Localized Surface Plasmon
Resonance (LSPR) biosensor, based on DNA/DNA interaction, for the detection of
allelic variants of genes speciﬁcally related to quality in different durum wheat

cultivars. The ﬁrst kind of biosensor uses the whole prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell as a
single reporter, incorporating both bioreceptor and transducer elements into the same
cell. The sample toxicity is estimated from the degree of inhibition of a cellular activity
or a speciﬁc reporter gene expression [1]. In this case the presence of metal ions
activated the transductions of a reported protein.
In the LSPR kind of biosensor, light interacts with particles much smaller than the
incident wavelength. This leads to a plasmons that oscillates locally around the
nanoparticle with a frequency known as the LSPR. When metal nanostructures interact
with a light beam, part of the incident photons are absorbed and part are scattered in
different directions [2]. In particular, in this work the LSPR biosensor was used to study
the Lpx gene coding for lypoxigenase, enzyme responsible of the carotenoid pigments
degradation and, consequently, of the color change of wheat end-products.

Experimental Details
2.1
Whole-Cell Biosensor
The whole-cell biosensor consists of K12 MG1655 and DH5a Escherichia coli cells
transformed with plasmids in which the reporter gene (GFP or luxCDABE), whose
expression is quantitatively monitored, is under control of metal-responsive promoters
such as zntA, groE and dnaK. Tobacco protoplasts were transformed with a plasmid
containing the GFP gene driven by a promoter of a sunﬂower small HSP gene known
to be activated also by metal ions. The E. coli and tobacco cells genetically engineered
as above reported, emit ﬂuorescence or luminescence in response to metal exposure.
Bacteria and tobacco protoplasts were mixed with an agarose matrix (2%) and dis-
pensed into the wells of a 96-well plate to be immobilized. After immobilization,
E. coli and tobacco cells were treated, ﬁrst, with different concentrations of Al, Cd, Co,
Ni and Zn salts for different times (0–24 h), and then with various by-products and ﬁnal
product of the pasta processing industry. The signal was measured by a ﬂuorimeter.
2.2
LSPR Biosensor
Au nanoparticles were prepared onto corning glass substrates (10  10  2 mm) by
e-beam evaporation. The technique used allows to obtain spherical nanoparticles with a
diameter of 30 nm (Fig. 1).
The immobilization of the DNA molecules (probe-10 µM) occurred by depositing
a drop of the solution containing the probes in a saline buffer for 20 h. The probe is 5′
thiol-modiﬁed and contains a (CH2)15tail. After rinsing in water, the transducer was left
for 20 h in the passivation buffer and, after a new rinsing in water, the solution
containing the oligonucleotides (target-1 µM) resuspended in hybridization buffer was
injected into the measuring cell using a peristaltic pump: the interaction was monitored
for 30 min. Finally, the probe was regenerated by HCl 20 mM. The optical charac-
terization was conducted by using a Varian Cary® 500 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Whole-Cell Biosensor
The ﬁrst step was to assess the ability of the genetically engineered bacteria and
tobacco protoplasts to sense, after immobilization, the presence of metal ions. In fact, a
detectable signal was evaluated after treatments with different concentrations of Al, Cd,
Co, Cu, Ni and Zn salts. In general, genetically modiﬁed E. coli and tobacco cells
produce detectable signal in the presence of all metal ions. In particular, the highest
signal was detected after 16 h of treatment in all samples when the GFP reporter was
used, on the contrary luxCDABE reporter is elicited in bacteria at highest level after
2 h. The variation of signal intensity is related to both promoter and reporter gene used;
zntA and groE promoters are the most sensitive, luxCDABE reporter gene has faster
response time and higher short-term sensitivity.
Subsequently, E.coli cells genetically engineered with zntA or groE promoter were
chosentoanalizevariousby-productsandthe ﬁnalproduct ofthepastaprocessingindustry.
The results obtained, reported in Table 1, indicate that the bacterial whole-cell
biosensor is activated by certain food matrices analyzed; allowing to say that the
biosensor is able to detect the presence of metal ions in food matrices.

3.2
LSPR Experiment
Localised surface plasmon resonance measurements were conducted by the immobi-
lization of the Lpx2s probe, identifying the intermediate quality haplotype of Lpx gene,
on the surface of gold nanoparticles.
In Fig. 2a the typical optical absorption curves of gold nanostructured substrate
(black color) are shown. As one can see, the absorption curves were obtained through
the immobilization procedure of Lpx2s probe on gold nanoparticles (red color), the
passivation (green color) and the hybridization with the target Lpx2p (blue color).
Obviously, the target sequence is complementary to the sequence of the probe.
It was observed a wavelength shift of the peak of the absorption curves from
547 nm, in the presence of the only metallic nanoparticles, to 570 nm, after the
hybridization of the probe with the complementary target. In addition it was also
observed an increase of the signal intensity from 0.24 (only gold nanoparticles) to 0.28
(after hybridization). This effect is due to the variation of the refractive index of the
surface. A relative variation of the light absorbed as a function of wavelength is also
reported in Fig. 2b where giving the opportunity to choose the wavelength corre-
sponding to the maximum variation in the optical absorption. In fact, after the binding
of the complementary target to the probe, it was observed, in addition to a wavelength
shift of the absorption peak, a variation of the intensity of light absorbed, which is
maximum in correspondence of the spectral region where the absorption curve have the
greater slope. Therefore it can also be detected a small variation in the refractive index.
The wavelength shift values and the signal intensity increase, calculated in the different
step of the experiment, are shown in Table 2.

Conclusions
A biosensor based on bacterial whole cells genetically engineered with metal
responsive expression cassettes was realized, that is useful to detect speciﬁcally, rapidly
and with high sensitivity the presence of contaminants in wheat end-products. This
device can be used “on the ﬁeld” to monitor pasta-production plants in order to asses
food safety along the production chain. Furthermore, as a proof of concept a LSPR
biosensor that allow to identify allelic variants of genes coding for protein associated to
bad or good quality of wheat end-products has been also demonstrated.

Abstract. This article presents the successful design, fabrication and testing of
a miniaturized system integrating capillarity and electrowetting-on-dielectric
(EWOD) technology in a microﬂuidic network. In particular, the change in
hydrophobicity occurring at the interphase between a capillary channel and a
hydrophobic layer has been exploited using EWOD as a stop-go ﬂuid valve. The
combination of capillary forces and EWOD technology to control the ﬂuid
movement opens the possibility to implement a wide variety of microﬂuidic
conﬁgurations to perform different biomedical assays with a low-power con-
sumption process. These assays could be easily and inexpensively integrated in
lab-on-chip systems featuring small size and high-throughput characteristics.

Introduction
Lab-on-chip (LoC) devices are miniaturized systems able to perform bio-chemical and
biological analysis by integrating, in a small chip of few square centimeters, several
modules that implement the functionalities of a standard laboratory for biomedical
applications [1, 2]. Even though LoC systems tend to be simplest, they usually have
bulky connections and external ﬂuid injection systems that impede their effective
miniaturization.
Currently, research on LoC applications is being addressed towards eliminating
external instrumentation—syringes, pumps, radiation sources and complex optical
systems [3, 4]—to perform the analysis. Developing a technology that is reliable,
simple, light and small is a challenge for researchers.
In this framework, this paper combines two different techniques to drive liquid
samples through a microﬂuidic network without using external bulky connections.
These techniques are the capillarity that takes advantage of the surface tension effect,
and the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) approach, that through an electric ﬁeld

changes from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic status the wettability of a surface. The
main idea is to use the capillary forces to move the ﬂuid and the EWOD technique to
implement a stop-and-go system [5], by using the electrodes as ﬂuidic-electric valves.
The two technologies have been integrated in a test-chip, which includes structures
for different functions and in particular a set of EWOD electrodes acting as stop-and-go
valves. To this aim the technological steps needed for the fabrication, on a single glass
substrate, of regions characterized by different hydrophobicity have been designed and
optimized. The performed tests prove the suitability of the proposed microﬂuidic chip
as low-power consumption, autonomous and compact lab-on-chip system.
1.1
Electrowetting-on-Dielectric
Digital microﬂuidics, based on the Electrowetting-On-Dielectric (EWOD) mechanism,
has shown great potential for a wide range of applications in lab-on-a-chip device.
Indeed, EWOD technology allows to isolate samples of ﬂuid, digitally control its
movement and improve the mixing efﬁciency [6]. It presents low-power consumption
and a faster response to control signals when compared to other systems that modulate
the surface tension [7].
EWOD relies on the ability to vary the contact angle of an electrically conductive
liquid droplet on a hydrophobic surface by means of an external electric ﬁeld [8, 9].
The contact angle change as a function of applied voltage is regulated by the
Lippmann-Young equation:
cos h ¼ cos h0 þ
e0er
2dEDLclv
ðV  V0Þ2
ð1Þ
where clv is the liquid-vapor surface tension, dEDL the thickness of the dielectric layer,
e0 is the permittivity of the free space, er is its relative dielectric constant and V the
applied voltage. h is the contact angle at the applied voltage V, while h0 is the contact
angle without applied voltage [10, 11]. The droplet wets the electrode surface as the
contact angle decreases and the surface becomes effectively less hydrophobic, along the
solid-liquid contact line, as voltage is increased. The variation of contact angle or
wettability shift is mainly caused by the charge-induced change in the solid-liquid
interfacial tension [12]. In order to take advantage of this effect for droplet manipu-
lation, a polarizable and conductive liquid droplet is sandwiched between the two
plates and surrounded by a ﬁller ﬂuid, which may be air or an immiscible liquid such as
silicone oil to prevent evaporation of the droplet. Both plates are covered with a
hydrophobic coating that is electrically insulating on the bottom-plate, and may or may
not be insulating on the top-plate. To achieve a droplet movement, an array of driving
electrodes is patterned on the surface of an EWOD device to spatially control the
surface wettability electrode by electrode. Generally, movement is obtained by placing
the drop on an electrode and by applying the voltage to the adjacent electrodes. EWOD
can be performed in an open conﬁguration, where the electrodes are placed only in a

hydrophobic material deposition. In the closed EWOD system, the generated electric
ﬁeld is stronger than in the open conﬁguration and, thus, it is easier—a smaller voltage
is needed—to move the sample droplets. A sketch of the closed conﬁguration can be
seen in Fig. 1.
1.2
Capillary Forces
Capillary forces result from the interaction of liquid, gas and solid surfaces, at the
interface between them. In the liquid phase, molecules are held together by cohesive
forces. In the bulk of the liquid, the cohesive forces between one molecule and the
surrounding molecules are balanced. However, at the edge of the liquid, the cohesive
forces with other liquid molecules are larger than the interaction with air molecules. As
a result, the liquid molecules at the interface are pulled together towards the liquid. The
overall effect of these forces minimizes the free surface of the liquid that is exposed to
air. The proportionality between the decrease in energy of the surface that results from
decreasing the surface is described by the surface tension:
c ¼ dG
dA
ð2Þ
where dG is the change in energy [N/m], dA is the change in area [m2] and c is the
surface tension [N/m]. Of interest for capillary forces is the contact between three
phases: liquid, solid and vapor (air) (see Fig. 2). Three forces are present, trying
simultaneously to minimize the contact area between the three phases. Two of them are
in the same plane and a third one that forms the so called “contact angle” at the

solid-liquid interface. At equilibrium, the forces at the triple interface are balanced and
the relationship between them is described by the Young’s equation:
cSV  cSL  cLV  cos h0 ¼ 0
ð3Þ
where c represents an interfacial tension and the subscripts L, V and S stand for liquid,
vapor and solid, respectively.
Analyzing the horizontal equilibrium of forces, the Young’s equation is reached.
Since the surface energy in an interface is a physical constant that depends on the
nature of both the substances involved (it depends on the attraction forces between
molecules), the droplet has to change shape and reach the contact angle that permits
static equilibrium. Molecules at an interface are subjected to both cohesion forces
(molecules attracting each other) and adhesion forces (attraction to the other side
surface). Surfaces where adhesion forces are greater than cohesion forces are said to be
hydrophilic, or wettable, and are characterized by a contact angle smaller than 90°. On
the other hand, when surface experiences cohesion forces stronger than adhesion for-
ces, it is called a hydrophobic, or not wettable, surface. In this case the contact angle is
greater than 90°.
In a capillary tube, the ﬂuid that is not in contact with the walls of the conduit
adopts a concave (convex) meniscus shape if the surface is hydrophilic (hydrophobic)
(see Fig. 3). In a capillary tube, a column of water can move through the conduit due to
capillary pressure. This magnitude is the difference in pressure across the interface of
two immiscible ﬂuids and has a value calculated by the Young-Laplace equation:
pc ¼ 2 c cos h
r
ð4Þ
Fig. 3 Hydrophilic and hydrophobic meniscus
Design, Fabrication and Testing of a Capillary …
203

In the previous equation pc is the capillary pressure, c is the interfacial tension, h the
contact angle and r is the effective radius of the interface. According to Eq. 4, the
further to 90° is the contact angle (either towards 0° or 180°), or the greater the
interfacial tension, the greater is the capillary pressure. Also, the smaller the effective
radius of curvature of the meniscus, the greater is the capillary pressure. A microscale
ﬂow is characterized by a small Reynolds number and subsequently by a laminar ﬂow
(which is self powered) that hinders the mixing of two different substances.

Designed Device
Taking into account the advantages of both capillarity (self-powered and autonomous
systems) and EWOD approach (low power consumption, possibility to electrically
control the movement of liquid drops), we developed a microﬂuidic network as a
test-chip for the integration of these two techniques.
The main idea is to use the capillary forces to move the ﬂuid and the EWOD
technique to implement a stop-go system, by using the electrodes as ﬂuidic-electric
valves. Top view of the basic device is shown in Fig. 4. A ﬂuid inserted in the
dispenser will go along the hydrophilic channel until it reaches the hydrophobic region,
where are located the EWOD electrodes. Only when an appropriate sequence of
voltages is applied to the electrodes, the ﬂuid will get to the second hydrophilic channel
and then to the capillary pump.
Before the system design, we solved the technological issue related to the fabri-
cation on the same glass substrate of hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This has
been achieved through the optimization of the different fabrication processes and in
particular of the deposition parameters of the Teﬂon® layer that covers the EWOD
electrodes. Figure 5 demonstrates the successful fabrication of a glass substrate having
a hydrophobic surface with hydrophilic spots that capture droplets of water.
The whole system design, comprised in a 5  5 cm2 glass substrate, is reported in
Fig. 6 where are reported and explained the different parts of the microﬂuidic circuits.
In particular, the blue regions refer to the microﬂuidic circuit, while the red ones to
the EWOD electrodes. Independently on the speciﬁc function implemented in each

microﬂuidic circuit (from A to D), each network includes the basic structure reported in
Fig. 4, where the EWOD pads are used as stop-and-go valves.

The last step is the bonding of the two substrates (top and bottom) using a clip to

The device fabricated is shown in Fig. 8.
After fabrication, the system has been tested using circuit B. A detail sequence of
the system operation is shown in Fig. 9. We observed that the ﬂuid ﬂows through the
hydrophilic channels and stops at the border of the hydrophobic region (Fig. 9a).
Subsequently, driving the EWOD electrodes with a voltage as low as 35 V, the ﬂuid
passes over the hydrophobic layer (Fig. 9b) and ﬁlls the successive hydrophilic channel
(Fig. 9c). These pictures demonstrate the successful combination of the capillarity and
the EWOD technique on the same glass substrate and the effectiveness of the electric
ﬁeld as driving force for the stop-and-go EWOD valves.

Conclusion
This paper has reported the combination of two microﬂuidic techniques (capillarity and
EWOD) for the development of autonomous and compact microﬂuidic networks,
whose operations are electronically controlled. The EWOD stop-go valve has been
demonstrated to correctly work as the ﬂuid stopped at the electrode border and moved
once the voltage was applied to it.
Therefore, the idea of enclosing a sample in the channel between two valves can be
implemented. This is a very important result because the capillary action permits the
development of autonomous, low-consumptions systems while the EWOD technique,
and its application as stop-go valves, allow the design of microﬂuidic networks dense
of functions (triggering, mixing, dispensing, separation).

Abstract. A rapid and accurate medical diagnosis is essential in order to
determine the health status of a patient. Nowadays, most of the clinical analyses
are performed in specialized laboratory, which required speciﬁc instrumentation
and trained personal, resulting in an increase of analysis costs and time. In this
context, biosensors represent ideal tools capable to provide a speciﬁc and fast
response together with low cost, easy use and portable size features. This work
attempts to provide a review of the research progresses of electrochemical and
photoelectrochemical biosensor platforms in clinical applications that have been
published in recent years. Special emphasis will be devoted to discuss examples
for breast cancer biomarker detection, because breast cancer, is considered the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in women, representing 15%
of all cancer related amongst women, with a 6% mortality rate (based on overall
cancer deaths). The manuscript is focused on aptamer-based biosensors,
because, due to their stability and their relatively low cost, they have been
successfully applied in many biosensor formats for breast cancer biomarker
detection.

Introduction
Cancer represents one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There are more than
100 different types of cancer affecting different human organs. Following statistics, in
Europe in 2012 the most common primary cancer sites in men were prostate, lung,
colorectal and bladder. In women, breast cancer was by far the most frequently
diagnosed neoplasm, followed by colorectal, lung and corpus uteri cancers. Breast
cancer, represents 15% of all cancer related amongst women, with a 6% mortality rate
(based on overall cancer deaths) [1].
It is now well known that early detection of cancer represents the best opportunity
to increase the survival rate of patients. In this perspective the discovery and the clinical
validation of cancer-related biomarkers represent and ideal tool.
In clinical analysis, a biomarker represents a bio-molecule whose concentration
increases/decreases over a threshold level (named also as clinical cut-off) in a body
ﬂuids, tissue, etc. in the presence/absence of a disease. Rigorous deﬁnition was given

both by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Union National Institute
of Health which deﬁned a biomarker as a “characteristic that is objectively measured
and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or
pharmacologic responses to therapeutic intervention. The biomarkers act as indicators
of a normal or a pathogenic biological process. They allow assessing the pharmaco-
logical response to a therapeutic intervention. A biomarker shows a speciﬁc physical
trait or a measurable biologically produced change in the body that is linked to a
disease or a particular health condition” [2].
These molecules should ideally possess the following properties:
• Biomarker expression should be related to the process that causes cancer and to the
type of the cancer.
• Biomarker level should be higher enough, in biological ﬂuids or tissue, to be
measured in an easy and trustworthy way.
• Biomarker concentration (increasing or decreasing) should be strictly correlated to
the disease variation and to the treatment outcome.
Because proteins inﬂuence the molecular pathways in the cells and they are strictly
related to disease state and they are released in biological ﬂuids, the cancer-related
proteins are one of the most studied and used biomarkers in clinical analysis [3–6].
In the cancer biomarker analysis, biosensors play an interesting role because they
allow fast, accurate, sensitive, selective and low cost analysis coupled with the pos-
sibility of device miniaturization and multi-analysis detection in contrast with the
conventional clinical procedure (such as ELISA test, ﬂuorescent or chemiluminescent
assays) [7–9].
In this work, we focus our attention on the development of electrochemical and
photoelectrochemical biosensor for determination of breast cancer biomarkers reported
in the literature in the last three years.

Aptamer
Aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides sequences (both DNA, in particular ssDNA, and
RNA) or peptide capable to bind a target protein with afﬁnity and selectivity comparable
of those of monoclonal antibodies. Due to their advantages respect to antibodies (such as
high stability, chemical synthesis, low dimension, afﬁnity for small molecules, etc.)
aptamers were successfully applied in many ﬁelds including drug discovery and delivery,
tissue bio-imaging and also as therapeutic agents and as bioreceptors in biosensor
applications for clinical, environmental and food analysis [10–12].
2.1
Nucleic Acid Aptamers
Nucleic acid aptamers (both DNA and RNA), which exhibits a high afﬁnity for a
speciﬁc target, are synthetized through a process named as systematic evolution of
ligands by exponential enrichment (abbreviated as SELEX) developed in 1990s by two
independents research groups [13, 14].
210
A. Ravalli et al.

The original process (conventional SELEX) consists in a series of binding, elution
and ampliﬁcation steps repeated several times (about 20) which led to the selection of a
pool of aptamers with high afﬁnity for a speciﬁc target. In particular, an initial library of
1015–1016 random sequences (each one composed by a 20–30 bp variable region and a
15–25 bp ﬂanked region, used to anneal the primer during the Polymerase Chain
Reaction, PCR, ampliﬁcation step) is incubated, in controlled experimental conditions
(pH, ionic strength, temperature, incubation time etc.), with the target molecules. After
the afﬁnity reaction, the unbound oligonucleotides are removed while the DNA
sequences bound to the analyte are eluted and subsequently ampliﬁed by PCR process.
The binding/elution/ampliﬁcation steps are then repeated, in more stringent experi-
mental conditions, with the new pool of oligonucleotides. For RNA aptamer selection,
the initial DNA library is transcribed into a RNA library, which is incubated with the
target molecules; after the elution step, selected RNA aptamers are converted again into
DNA sequences, ampliﬁed by PCR, and transcribed back to RNA for the next round. In
both cases, at the end, the selected aptamer are sequenced and characterized by ther-
modynamics and kinetic measurements in terms of afﬁnity constant (Ka), dissociation
constant (kd) and the ratio (KD = Kd/Ka) [15].
In order to overcome some drawbacks of SELEX conventional procedure (such as
long working time, high operative and instrumentation costs), some variants were
studied and introduced (i.e. in capillarity and micro-ﬂow electrophoresis SELEX,
magnetic meads-based SELEX or cell- and in vivo SELEX)
All these processes are generally followed by a post-modiﬁcation step in which various
positions of the oligonucleotide chain (i.e. 2′, 3′ and 5′) can be functionalized with speciﬁc
molecules (polyethylene glycol tag, PEG, -SH, -NH2, biotin, sugar, etc.) for particular
applications. In some cases, in order to avoid the decreasing of aptamer afﬁnity, chemically
modiﬁed DNA/RNA sequences can be directly introduced into the initial library [16].
2.2
Peptide Aptamer
Peptide aptamers have been deﬁned by Colas et al. in 1996 [17] as combinatorial
protein molecules in which a variable peptide sequence with afﬁnity for a given target
protein is displayed on an inert, constant scaffold protein. They are extremely simple
molecules, selected from combinatorial libraries on the basis of their afﬁnity to the
target protein or small molecule, and, generally, expressed in bacterial cells, such as
E. coli. [10, 17]. There are many protein scaffolds reported in the literature and they
have been intensely reviewed in the past [1, 10].
Among this class of bioreceptor, Afﬁbody® molecules are commercially available.
The Afﬁbody molecule is an engineered version (Z domain) of one of the ﬁve stable
three-a-helix bundle domains from the immunoglobulin Fc-binding region of staphy-
lococcal protein A. This molecule is constituted by only 58 amino acids without
disulphide bonds and can therefore be produced in simpler organism such as
prokaryote, rather than the animal system required in antibody synthesis. Afﬁbodies

can include speciﬁc labels, such as ﬂuorophores, radioactive labels and other moieties,
such as biotin, which can be used to couple the afﬁbody to surfaces or other molecules,
including enzymes [18, 19].

Biomarkers in Breast Cancer
Some speciﬁc biomarkers are often useful for selecting the appropriate treatment
options in breast cancer. Some of them are here described.
CA15.3 (also known as MUC1 from the coding gene) is a type I transmembrane
glycoprotein, that is mainly overexpressed in breast and ovarian carcinomas. It pos-
sesses a molecular mass ranging from 300 to 600 kDa and consists of two subunits (a
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular subunits containing the variable
number tandem repeat, VNTR, domain). The disease status in breast and recently in
ovarian cancer patients is routinely assessed by monitoring the serum levels of circu-
lating CA15.3 protein and its elevated levels (>20 U/mL) are always associated with
poor survival [20].
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also known as ErbB2, c-erbB2
or HER2/neu, is a 185 kDa protein belongs to a family composed of four structurally
related members, HER1 (ErbB1, also known as EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3
(ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4). In particular, HER2 is a type 1 transmembrane glyco-
protein which includes three distinct regions: an N-terminal extracellular domain
(ECD), a single a-helix transmembrane domain (TM), and an intracellular tyrosine
kinase domain. Overexpression of HER2 usually results in malignant transformation of
cells accounts for  25% of all breast cancer cases (clinical cut off: 15 ng/mL). Fur-
thermore, it was also found that survival rate and recurrence probability of the tumor
for HER2 positive breast cancer patients are signiﬁcantly shorter than patients without
HER2 overexpression. HER2 can be also found at high concentration in blood in the
presence of other cancer types such as gastric, ovarian and prostate [21].
Vascular endothelial growth factor term is referred to a family of dimer glyco-
protein (covalently linked by 2 disulﬁde bridges) which includes ﬁve members
(VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, placenta growth factor, PGF) and their
associated receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3). Homologs of VEGF protein
are also discovered in the genome of some viruses (VEGF-E) or in the venom of some
snakes (VEGF-F). Because VEGF-A was the ﬁrst and the most studied protein (in
particular related to carcinogenesis and cancer biology), often, in literature, the term
VEGF strictly indicate the VEGF-A member. From biological point of view, VEGF
and its receptors play a main role in the formation of cardiovascular system; in presence
of a cancer process VEGF is mainly involved carcinogenesis and in tumor metastasis.
VEGF concentration in blood and serum (which values is much higher than 100 pM in
pathological condition) can be thus used as biomarker associated with diagnosis and
prognosis of different type of cancer diseases with particular reference to the presence
of metastasis processes [22].

Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Biosensor
for Breast Cancer Biomarker Detection
4.1
Electrochemical-Based Biosensors
Electrochemical techniques as transduction mechanism in aptasensors development
were widely known. The common electrochemical techniques used for the detection of
the analyte include potentiometry, amperometry, voltammetry, conductometry and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Further and complete description of these
electrochemical techniques can be found in Ref. [23].
Herein, some examples of electrochemical aptasensors development for breast
cancer biomarkers detection using label and label-free approaches are brieﬂy discussed.
An aptamer sandwich-based assay for MUC1 detection was reported by Florea
et al. [24]. In this work, anti-MUC1 primary aptamer was immobilized on the surface
of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, followed by reaction with biotin (as blocking
agent) and with MUC1 protein. Then, incubation with a biotinylayed secondary
anti-MUC1 aptamer and with streptavidin-alkalin phosphatase were carried out. The

(obtained

nique allowed the detection of MUC1 in the range between 0.05 and 0.28 nM MUC1
with a detection limit of 0.07 nM. The proposed aptasensor showed also a high
selectivity for MUC1 protein in the presence of mucin 4 and mucin 16 (as non-speciﬁc
proteins) and the ability to detect MUC1 in cancer patient serum sample.
In a recent work, the development of a label-free biosensor for HER2 cancer
biomarker detection based on the use of anti-HER2 Afﬁbody, as bioreceptor, and of
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-modiﬁed graphite screen-printed electrode, as nanostruc-
tured electrochemical transducer, was proposed (Fig. 1) [25]. In particular, after the
electrodeposition of AuNPs on the working electrode surface, the sensor was modiﬁed
by the incubation with the anti-HER2 Afﬁbody. Mixed-SAM formation (by the use of
the use 6-mercapto-1-hexanol) and surface blocking step (by the use of BSA) were
performed. Afﬁnity reaction with HER2 protein was then evaluated by means of
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, EIS (linear range: 1–40 µg/L HER2, detec-
tion limit: 6 µg/L). The proposed afﬁbody-based biosensor showed also good response
in HER2-spiked serum samples.
An aptamer-based sandwich assay for VEGF detection was reported by Ravalli
et al. [26]. After the modiﬁcation of the graphite working electrode surface by the use
of AuNPs, the incubation with thiolated primary anti-VEGF aptamer was carried out,
followed by blocking step (by the use of 6-mercapto-1-hexanol) and afﬁnity reaction
with VEGF. The assay was then completed by the addition of a biotinylated secondary
anti-VEGF aptamer and by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. The electrochemical

range between 40 and 250 nM with a limit of detection of 30 nM.
Recently, Baydemir et al. [27] described the use of Afﬁbody molecule for TNF-a
detection. TNF-a is an inﬂammatory cytokine produced by the immune system. Serum
TNF-a level is elevated in some pathological states such as septic shock, graft

rejection, HIV infection, neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.
Detecting trace amount of TNF-a is, also, very important for the understanding of
tumor biological processes [28]. Magnetic beads were used as support for Afﬁbody
immobilization and screen printed carbon electrodes were used as transducers. TNF-a
calibration curve was performed, obtaining a detection limit of 38 pg/mL, the quan-
tiﬁcation range of 76–5000 pg/mL and RSD% 7.
4.2
Photoelectrochemical-Based Biosensors
Photoelectrochemical biosensors are based on the use of photoactive materials for the
development of the transducer. The photoactive material is responsive to a light
excitation, generating a photocurrent on a conductive substrate. Inorganic and organic
semiconductors can be used as photoactive materials.
An anodic photocurrent occurs when the conduction electrons are transferred to the
electrode, and valence holes neutralized by electrons supplied by an electron donor in
solution [29]. If the conduction electrons are transferred to a solution-solubilized
electron acceptor, a cathodic photocurrent is measured. The presence of an efﬁcient
electron donor/acceptor prevents the electron-hole recombination and thus increases
and stabilizes the photocurrent.
Nowadays, inorganic semiconductors are mainly fabricated using nanomaterials
like SnO2, TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) as well as CdS, CdSe quantum dots (QDs).
Frequently, these nanomaterials are assembled on a conductive substrate, such as gold,
Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) or F-doped SnO2 (FTO). Organic photoactive materials
include small molecules such as porphyrin, phtalocyanine, and their derivatives, azo

dyes, metal complexes as well as polymers. The light excites the molecules that can
react with an electron donor or an electron acceptor, producing anodic or cathodic
photocurrents, respectively.
Hybrid semiconductors can be obtained by coupling two inorganic semiconductors
with different band gaps or organic complexes combined with inorganic materials; in
this sense improved conversion efﬁciency is obtained by coupling semiconductors with
different band gap.
Photoelectrochemical detection offers some peculiar advantages, such as minia-
turized and low cost instrumentation. Moreover, by using light for excitation and
electrochemistry for detection, photoelectrochemistry can reach high level of sensitivity
because of the reduced background associated with it. According to the mode of signal
transduction photoelectrochemical biosensors could be classiﬁed as potentiometric or
amperometric photoelectrochemical biosensors.
Recently, Tan et al. described the use of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTs), grown
on a titanium foil and decorated with Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the detection of
MUC1 (Fig. 2) [30]. AuNPs were used for improving the electrical conductivity of
TiO2 NTs and for the immobilization of the MUC1 aptamers. CdTe QDs-labeled
complementary single-stranded DNAs (c-DNA@QDs) are hybridized with the MUC1
aptamer to form a TiO2 NT/aptamer/c-DNA@QD aptasensor. In the absence of target
MUC1, under the irradiation of visible light, a high photocurrent response was
observed due to the light absorption of CdTe QDs and the photoinduced electron
transfer from CdTe QDs to TiO2 NTs through DNA chain. However, in the presence of
MUC1, MUC1 combined with its aptamer and CdTe QDs-labeled c-DNAs left the

Abstract. In this work, the ability of an impedance sensor to rapidly detect
bacteria growth in a culture medium has been investigated. A test conﬁguration
with two electrodes embedded in a Petri dish has been proposed. Impedances
corresponding to a sterile medium and one inoculated with bacteria have been
measured and compared during the growth process. Remarkable differences
have been observed in the time evolutions of the two behaviors. In particular,
impedance behavior measured at 100 Hz allows such achievement after only
1 h. An equivalent circuit of the measured impedances have been proposed.
Considerations regarding the effects of the bacteria growth on the components
describing the electrode-medium interface have been reported. The variations of
these elements have been identiﬁed as the more signiﬁcant for the early
detection. From these promising results, improved conﬁgurations consisting of a
matrix of electrodes can be proposed for localized and rapid detection by means
of automated analysis systems.

Introduction
Early and objective detection of bacteria growth in culture media is a desired important
improvement in microbiology and medicine. It can reduce the time necessary to
determine the specie of a pathogen, thus allowing, for example, a rapid correction of an
antibiotic therapy. The detection by impedance measurements represents an objective
method, in fact, the growth can be observed in the variations of the culture medium
impedance caused by the bacteria activity [1–3]. Growth devices that can allow the
detection of bacteria can be obtained by placing sensing electrodes, in contact with the
growth media and embedded in the media holder [4–6]. Moreover, impedance sensors
are suitable to the purpose when low concentrations of bacteria grow not uniformly in
the medium. In fact, it is possible to focus the detection in localized regions of the
medium by placing a distributed matrix of electrodes [6]. Petri dishes are a typical grow

medium holder also adopted in automated systems for the manipulation of a large
number of bacteria cultures. In this work, a test conﬁguration with an impedance sensor
embedded in a Petri dish has been proposed. The sensor consists of two steel elec-
trodes, which has been ﬁxed to the Petri dish structure and immersed, in the culture
medium. The time evolution of the impedance has been measured during the growth
process and the effect of the bacteria growth has been studied for an objective detec-
tion. The detection time has been estimated to demonstrate the possibility of an early
detection. In addition, the effect of the temperature variations and the drying of the
medium that can affect impedance the variations, during the growth process, has been
investigated. To separate the effects of these phenomena from the bacteria growth
comparative measurements between the impedances of a sterile culture medium and
one inoculated with bacteria have been performed. The investigation of the measured
impedances has been also carried out by proposing an electrical equivalent circuit of
the sensor with the culture medium between the electrodes [1, 3]. In this way, the
elements of this model, which are mainly affected by the bacteria during the growth,
can be identiﬁed and conveniently considered for an early detection.

Petri Dish with Impedance Sensor
2.1
Impedance Sensor Description
In the proposed test conﬁguration of the Petri dish with embedded impedance sensor,
two steel electrodes have been ﬁxed to the bottom of the dish. As shown in Fig. 1, the
electrodes consist of two planar slats, which have been placed faced each other at a
ﬁxed distance. The Petri dish has a diameter of 85 mm and the electrodes have a width
W = 60 mm and a distance d = 60 mm between them. In this way, a large portion of
the culture medium is in the spacing between the electrodes and this is used as the area
for the bacteria growth. The electrodes are ﬁxed to the dish by two steel pins that
protrude from the bottom side of the dish and act as the terminals for the measurements.
The electrodes are partially immersed in the culture medium that consists of Tryptone
Soya and it has a height h  4 mm.
2.2
Frequency Behavior of the Culture Media Impedance and Equivalent
Circuit
The impedance behavior as a function of the frequency has been measured by con-
necting the electrode terminals to an impedance analyzer HP 4194A. Figure 2a shows
an example of culture medium impedance measured in the frequency range between
100 Hz and 500 kHz for a sterile culture medium at ambient temperature of 25 °C. As
it can be observed, two different regions can be identiﬁed in the measured frequency
behavior. At the low frequencies, it presents a decreasing magnitude and a negative

phase that tends to 0° with the increase of the frequency. At higher frequencies, the
phase remain close to 0° and the magnitude tends to assume a constant value.
The obtained behavior can be described by a typical electrical equivalent circuit,
reported in Fig. 2b, where an electrolyte, as the adopted culture medium, is interfaced
to metal electrodes [1–3]. The equivalent circuit consists of the series of a resistor RM
and the parallel between a capacitor CDL and a resistor RCt. The RM resistor describes
the electrical behavior of the medium that is dominated by the conductivity.

the proposed test conﬁguration; c picture of the bottom side of the Petri dish with the embedded
electrodes immersed in the culture medium

M. Borghetti et al.

The parallel RCt −CDL describes the electrical behavior of the interface, where, the
resistor RCt accounts for the charge transfer between the medium and the electrode, and
the capacitor CDL accounts for the double layer capacitance in the medium at the
interface with a metal electrode. Following this equivalent circuit, in Fig. 2a the effect
of the interface components at the low frequencies can be observed in the magnitude
and phase of the measured impedance. Increasing the frequency the reactance of CDL
decreases neglecting thus also the effect of RCt and the measured impedance assumes
the behavior of the medium resistance RM.
Considering the obtained behavior of the sensor impedance, the effect of the bac-
teria growth on it can be conveniently evaluated only at two representative frequencies.
On one hand, a frequency fl in the “low” range where the interface components present
a relevant contribution has been considered. Thus, the effect of the bacteria growth on
CDL and RCt can be observed in the measured impedance. On the other hand, a
frequency fh in the “high” range, where the interface components can be neglected,
has been considered and the effect of the bacteria growth can be observed on RM.

A fl = 100 Hz has been used as the low frequency. A fh = 100 kHz has been chosen as
the high frequency value to avoid the effect of possible inductive contributions of the
connections.

Bacteria Growth Detection
3.1
Experimental Procedure
Two Petri dishes with embedded electrodes have been used in the experiment. The
culture medium of one Petri dish has been inoculated with bacteria while the other one
has been maintained sterile to be used as reference. The bacteria have been inoculated
with a solution of 16 µg/ml Escherichia Coli. The comparison experiment has been
performed by placing the Petri dishes, which start from the ambient temperature of 25 °
C, in a thermostatic chamber to carry out the bacteria growth at 35 °C. The impedances
of the culture medium with inoculated bacteria, Zbatt, and of the sterile one, Zst, have
been measured by connecting the electrodes of the two different Petri dishes to two
HP4194A impedance analyzers controlled and synchronized via GPIB by a speciﬁc
LabWiew program on a PC. For the comparison of their time evolution, the two
impedances Zbatt and Zst have been measured simultaneously every 2 min for 12 h.
The measurements have been started after the bacteria inoculation at the beginning of
the growth process in the thermostatic chamber. Figure 3 reports the time evolution of
Zbatt(fl,h) and Zst(fl,h) measured at the two representative frequencies, where the sufﬁx
l or h indicates the different frequencies fl or fh. As it can be observed, at both the
considered frequencies the two compared impedances present a different trend. On the
one hand, the impedances Zst(fl,h) of the sterile medium present variations only due to
the temperature settling and the drying of the medium. On the other hand, the different
trend of Zbatt(fl,h) of the medium with inoculated bacteria can be associated to the added
effect of the bacteria growth.
3.2
Growth Detection by Impedance Comparison
The comparison of the time behavior between the impedances Zbatt(fl,h), and Zst(fl,h), can
be conveniently made using magnitudes and phases referred with respect their initial
values. In this way, the impedances can be compared despite the differences in their
values due to the slight dimensional discrepancies between the two Petri dishes.
The magnitude |Z(fl,h)|* and the phase <Z(fl,h)* can be deﬁned as follows:
Zðfl;hÞ

ð2Þ
where |Z(fl,h)|t = 0 and <Z(fl,h)t = 0 is the magnitude and the phase values measured at the
beginning of the experiment.
222
M. Borghetti et al.

The possibility to detect the bacteria growth by the proposed impedance mea-
surements can be observed in the comparisons of Fig. 4. In fact, at the frequency fl of
100 Hz, after about 1 h, the trends of |Zbatt(fl)|* and <Zbatt(fl)* present large differences
with respect the trends of |Zst(fl)|* and <Zst(fl)*. In particular, |Zbatt(fl)|* presents an
additional decrease until about 4 h follow by a more rapid increase with respect |Zst(fl)|
*. At the same frequency, the phase <Zbatt(fl)* presents a positive shift which assumes
the maximum value after 4 h. The detection of the bacteria growth can be obtained
from the comparison also at the frequency fh of 100 kHz. In particular, after about 3 h
magnitude |Zbatt(fh)|* presents a different trend with respect the reference |Zst(fh)|*. It
consists in a rapid increase of |Zbatt(fh)|* between 3 and 6 h followed by a slow
decrease which is not present in the trend of |Zst(fh)|*.
The detection time can be better observed in Fig. 5 where the comparison is shown
as the ratio between the magnitudes |Zbatt (fl,h)|*/|Zst(fl,h)|* and difference between the
phases < Zbatt(fl,h)* −<Zst(fl,h)*. At the frequency fl the ratio starts to decrease from
the unitary value and the phase difference starts to increase from the zero after about

1 h which can be assumed as the detection time. Considering the different phases of
bacteria growth, the initial phase, where the impedance trend of Zbatt(fl) has the same
behavior of Zst(fl), can be associated to the lag phase where the multiplication of the
bacteria has not yet started. In the subsequent log and stationary phases of the growth,
Zbatt(fl) reaches a maximum reduction of about 10% with respect the reference trend of
Zst(fl). This maximum reduction veriﬁes after about 4 h where the maximum bacteria
activity can be assumed. The comparison reported in Fig. 5 shows also that the bacteria
growth presents a different effect on Zbatt at the frequency fh. In fact, the ratio |Zbatt(fh)|
*/|Zst(fh)|* starts to signiﬁcantly increase from the unitary value after about 3 h, while
the phase difference <Zbatt(fh)* −<Zst(fh)* presents only a slight deviation from zero.
The ratio increase reaches a maximum value of about 5% from the 5th and the 6th hour
of the grow process.

Effect of Bacteria Growth on the Equivalent Circuit
Components
The experimental results discussed in the Sect. 3 shows that the bacteria growth affects
in different way the measured impedance behavior at the different frequencies fl and fh.
It implies that the bacteria growth presents different actions on the different components
of the equivalent circuit of the sensor impedance, proposed in Fig. 2b. An evaluation of
the bacteria growth effects on these components can be useful for the design of
impedance sensors in order to maximize sensitivity and minimize thus the detection
time. The value of the components RCt, CDL and RM can be obtained from the impe-
dance measurements at two frequencies:

where Im[Z(fl,h)] is the imaginary part of the impedance measured at fl or fh. The time

Zbatt and Zst. The different effect of the bacteria growth on the components of the
equivalent circuit can be observed in Fig. 6 where the comparisons of their time
evolutions are reported.

Figure 6a, b show that the bacteria growth has a strong effect on the components
CDL and RCt, which accounts for the phenomena at the interface between the electrodes
and the medium. In fact, after an initial phase of about 1 h, the trends of the double
layer capacitance presents an evident increase and the contact resistance presents an
evident decrease with respect the trends derived for the impedance of the sterile
medium. The maximum variation rate of CDL and RCt, derived for Zbatt, has been
obtained between the 2nd and the 4th hour of the growth process which probably
corresponds to the phase where the bacteria presents the higher multiplication rate.
These variations reach the maximum magnitudes at the same time after about 4.5 h
followed by a slow variation towards the initial values. In this phase, which follows the
maximum variations, it can be assumed that the bacteria growth is in the stationary
phase where the number of bacteria presents an equilibrium between the bacteria
multiplication and the bacteria death.

Differently, Fig. 6c shows that the medium resistance RM is less affected by the
bacteria growth with respect CDL and RCt. Both the RM trends can be mainly associated
to the temperature settling and the drying of the medium during the experiment. The
effect of the bacteria growth on RM can be clearly seen only after about 3 h where the
resistance of the medium with inoculated bacteria presents a different behavior with
respect the sterile one.

Conclusion
The possibility of an early detection of bacteria growth in a culture media has been
demonstrated by proposing and testing a Petri dish with an embedded impedance
sensor. The comparisons of impedance measurements, operated during a growth pro-
cess, on a culture medium with inoculated bacteria and a sterile one show that a
detection time as low as 1 h has been obtained. In fact, the time evolutions of the
compared impedances present different behaviors, which allow the detection of the
bacteria growth. In addition, the different growth phases can be identiﬁed with different
impedance trends at different times during the experiment. The effects of the bacteria
growth on the components of the equivalent circuit of the sensor impedance have been
evaluated. Bacteria growth affects the components that describe the electrical behavior
of both the medium and the electrode-medium interface. The major and earlier varia-
tions have been obtained in the capacitance and in the resistance that describe the
interface. Thus, these variations have been identiﬁed as the most effective ones for the
early detection of bacteria growth. Therefore, the detection time would be highly
reduced by a sensor design that emphasizes the contribution of the interface compo-
nents on the comprehensive sensor impedance. Such a result can be obtained by
positioning small area electrodes at short distance from one another. In this way, on the
one hand, a reduced area increases the magnitude of the interface reactance and
resistance, on the other hand, reduced distance between the electrodes reduces the
magnitude of the medium resistance. This solution matches also the perspective to
focus the detection in localized regions of the medium by placing a distributed matrix
of electrodes. In fact, multiple localized sensors are suitable for the detection of low
concentrations of bacteria that grow not uniformly in the medium. A culture media
holder, such as a Perti dish, with embedded a distributed matrix of electrodes, can be
proposed for the early and automatic detection of bacteria growth in automated systems
for the manipulation of bacteria cultures.

Introduction
Recently we developed and standardized [1] classical immunoamperometric sensors for
b-Lactam antibiotics determination and studied the possibility of their use for the
analysis of real samples [2]. At present we have started to investigate also the possi-
bility to fabricate and apply new immunosensor methods, such as those based on ﬂow
SPR, to check possible advantages and disadvantages, in comparison with classical
immunoamperometric devices above developed. In the latter case, peroxidase as
enzymatic marker and a “competitive” format were used. Conversely, the SPR trans-
duction technique, used in the present research, allowed a “direct” measurement format
to be used, working in ﬂow mode.

Methods
2.1
Conventional Amperometric Immunosensor Method
For the ampicillin determination using, the conventional amperometric immunosensor,
the “following competitive format” was used: the ampicillin free in solution, to be
determined, was allowed to compete with a ﬁxed supply of the penicillin-G labeled
with biotin-avidin-peroxidase, for the ampicillin antibody immobilized on the mem-
brane (Immobilon), in order to produce the antigen- antibody immunocomplex [1].

2.2
Flow-Immunosensor SPR Method
For the determination of ampicillin using ﬂow SPR immunodevice (Fig. 1) and direct
measurement format, ﬁrst of all a modiﬁed (with mercaptoundecanoid acid) gold sensor
(SAM) disk, was placed on the prism of SPR; then the antibody was immobilized using
ethyl(dimethylamminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide, and, after
washing with buffer solution, the non-reacted, activated groups were deactivated by
treatment with ethanolamine. For the measurement, the following sequence was used:
ﬁrstly the baseline in the presence of the ﬂowing buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4) was recorded, then ampicillin solution was allowed to ﬂow into the cell,
thus generating a signal increase; when a plateau was reached, the phosphate buffer was
allowed to ﬂow and ﬁnally the surface was regenerated by allowing a 0.1 mM glycine–
HCl, pH 2.5 solution to ﬂow in the SPR cell, producing the dissociation of
anti-ampicillin–ampicillin complex, before restarting a new measurement.

Polarized light of the laser is split into two beams by beam splitting means (8). These two beams
provide two-channel device operation mode. Beam in the ﬁrst channel falls on the measurement
prism (6) and further on the sensor chip (7), passing the transparent plate (4) that serves for
take-off of the part of the beam energy on the photodiode (3) and part on photodiode (1) for laser
power control. The point of incidence of beam on the chip coincides with the table rotation axis.
The beam reﬂected from the chip falls on the photodiode (2) of the registration system after
turning by 90° prism angle and turn mirror (5). The accepted optical arrangement provides design
compactness and weak dependence of positions of light spot on the chip and on the registration
system photodiode what is important for ensuring of accuracy of the SPR curve measurement

Discussion and Conclusions
In conclusion a comparison of the main analytical data between SPR and classical
amperometric immunosensor shows that even if the linearity range of the SPR method
results only of about 4 decades (10−6–10−2 M), so that it is less wide of the traditional
immuno-amperometric method and, owing this reason, above all displaced only
towards lower values, nevertheless the sensitivity of the SPR method is, for instance,
still satisfactory for environmental analysis [3–7].

Abstract. The principal aim of the present research has been to check if any
correlation exists between the total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) value and the
total polyphenols content (TPC) of several food, or beverages and feed samples
based vegetables. The research was also extended to several food supplements
currently sold as pharmaceutical integrators.

Introduction
The measurement of antioxidant capacity, linked to numerous natural plant products,
has been aroused in recent years increasing interest. Really, while the antioxidant
capacity of the principal vegetables products is now sufﬁciently well known through
the publication of numerous reports on the subject (some of which by the authors of the
present communication), little or nothing is actually known from the experimental
standpoint about the antioxidant capacity of many food supplements, most of which
have appeared on the market recently and can be found in drugstores, side by side with
actual pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, although numerous methods are descri-
bed in the literature to measure antioxidant capacity, the situation has become com-
plicated ever since the United States Department of Agriculture [1] severely criticized
and also withdrew from its catalogue the principal and widely known ORAC ﬂuori-
metric method [2, 3]. Numerous researchers have therefore recently gone back to using
the polyphenol content of vegetables or vegetables based products as a measure of
antioxidant properties rather than using methods based for instance on Hydrogen Atom
Transfer (HAT), such as ORAC method.

Results and Discussion
In recent years our research team has developed an original biosensor method based on
superoxide dismutase enzyme [4–6] for the purpose of measuring the total antioxidant
capacity (TAOC) in many vegetables matrices. This new method has been found to
correlate highly with methods of Electron Transfer (ET) type [7]. In the present
research this biosensor method has been used to determine the TAOC of several
different food supplements available in drugstores and advertised above all as having
antioxidant properties that can act as radical scavengers. At the same time, in the same
products, the total concentration of polyphenols content (TPC), which are deemed to be
the main and most effective radical scavengers of plant origin, was measured using a
classical enzymatic-amperometric tyrosinase sensor pointed out in the past years by our
group [8]. Lastly we checked if any correlation exists between TAOC and polyphenols
content values (TPC). Results show that TAOC values and total polyphenol concen-
tration measured in food supplements do not always correlate closely (Fig. 1), not only
because of the presence of other non phenolic molecules, which also have a their
signiﬁcant antioxidant capacity, in several of the supplements tested, but due in
addition to the different antioxidant capacity of the various polyphenols present.
Lastly this investigation was extended to several food (beverages) or feed based
vegetables already considered in previous researches [4–6, 9–12]. In the case of these
food and feed based vegetables, on the contrary, this correlation between TAOC and
TPC seems to be usually in a rather evident, as our experimental data have shown (see
Figs. 2, 3 and 4).
Fig. 1. It can be shown as a correlation between TPC and TAOC exists for several (ﬁlled circle),
but not for all (ﬁlled triangle) pharmaceutical integrators

Conclusions
One conclusion that may therefore be drawn from this research is that it was conﬁrmed
as two used biosensors are very suitable for measurement in foods, feeds and inte-
grators real matrices. Nevertheless the polyphenol concentration alone cannot always
be taken as a completely reliable indicator of the total antioxidant capacity of matrices,
like those represented by pharmaceutical food supplements. While the polyphenol
content represent on the contrary a good indicator of the TAOC value, for food and
feed based vegetables.

Abstract. Among neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer Disease (AD) repre-
sents one of the most widespread pathologies, for which an early diagnosis is
still missing. A peculiar expression of an altered conformational isoform of p53
protein was reported to be a potential biomarker able to distinguish AD subjects
from healthy population, quantiﬁable using a blood-based enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In order to overcome ELISA limitations, related
to reliability and to improve sensitivity, this study aimed to realize a low cost
highly sensitive portable point-of-care (PoC) testing system based on screen
printed electrochemical sensors (SPES). The development of the platform
speciﬁcally included both the design of the sensing probe and of the electronic
circuit devoted to the conditioning and acquisition of the transduced electric
signal. Preliminary testing of the circuit were performed recording changes in
the conductivity of NaCl solution and quantifying electrodes coating with
antibodies using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) principle.
Results obtained with saline solution, showed the ability of the circuit to give the
best response corresponding to low changes in NaCl concentration (sensitivity
0.2 mA/(mg/ml)), suggesting a good sensitivity of the platform. Findings
obtained from EIS showed the ability of the circuit to discriminate between
different concentrations of antibodies coatings (sensitivity 80 µA/µg). Prelimi-
nary calibration of the sensor using interleukin IL-8 showed an increase in the
maximum peak of current proportional to the increase of protein concentration,
achieving a sensitivity of 35 µA/ng and reporting also a good value of repro-
ducibility, really promising in the perspective of lower values of proteins
concentrations.

Introduction
Among neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer Disease (AD) represents one of the
most investigated and serious pathologies, for which an early reliable diagnosis is still
missing. However, AD presents a long pre-symptomatic period, that could last up to
20 years, and which is characterized by biochemical and molecular events that can be
used to foresee the beginning of the disease itself. Therefore, one of the most pervasive
challenges of the research in medical diagnosis is related to the ability to detect this
pathology in its earliest development [1, 2] thanks to reliable identiﬁcation of speciﬁc
biomarkers, or biological markers (e.g. proteins). Biomarkers represent in fact an
indicator of the biological status, which can give useful information concerning
physiological or pathological conditions and during the application of different medical
treatments. Concerning AD diagnosis, recent studies speciﬁcally reported how the
presence of a particular altered conformation of a speciﬁc protein (p53) could be able to
discriminate subjects affected by AD from healthy population [3–5]. In this perspective,
clinicians require technologies able to identify, quickly and with a high sensitivity,
speciﬁc biological biomarkers related to AD disease, overcoming the issues related to
the use of blood-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in term of time
and cost effectiveness, volume of sample required, reliability and possibility of quan-
tiﬁcation. In the last decades, new rapid, low cost and easily accessible methodologies
and technologies have been increasingly investigated, supported by the interest toward
customized and personalized medicine and toward rapid and home-accessible diag-
nostic systems [6–8]. Thanks to their ability to be functionalized and customized for the
detection of different analytes (e.g. DNA, proteins), electrochemical biosensors rep-
resent the ideal starting point to realize complete testing platforms.
Printed electronics represents a successful approach to realize low cost and sensi-
tive biosensors for the sensitive and speciﬁc quantiﬁcation of different proteins [9–13].
By implementing biosensors, different methods can be used to detect and quantify
speciﬁc proteins. The most widely used methodology to detect and quantify speciﬁc
proteins on immunosensors are Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and
Voltammetry, both based on the electrode surface functionalization, very similar to
those used in the multi-wells standard ELISA [13]. The ﬁrst one is a label free method,
which measures the changes of impedance deriving from a different electrons exchange
between the functionalized surface of the electrode and a conductive solution
depending on the concentration of the recognized proteins [7, 9, 10]. The second
method represents instead the study of variation of electronic current as a function of
applied potential, which is able to induce speciﬁc redox reaction on the functionalized
working electrode (WE). A 3-electrode conformation—including WE, reference elec-
trode (RE) and a counter electrode (CE), used to measure the current—usually allows
for optimal measurement within this kind of applications [14, 15]. A very sensitive
technique of voltammetry, able to detect both proteins [14] or DNA sequences [16]
with limit of detection in the order of ng/ml, is represented by Anodic Stripping
Voltammetry (ASV). Using—for instance—the action of speciﬁc catalyzing enzymes,

239

this method is able to obtain a selective chemical deposition of speciﬁc metals pro-
portional to the amount of proteins recognized in the sample. In this way, the con-
centration of proteins can be estimated as proportional to the peak of current measured
during a stripping step, varying the potential between WE and RE. To further improve
speciﬁcity and sensitivity of this technology, limits of detection lower than 100 pg/ml
can be achieved thanks to the integration of the SPES with nanostructured materials.
Gold nanoparticles, for example, or carbon nanotubes, or a combination of the two, has
been used to modify the surface of the working electrode allowing to better recognize
antigens and DNA sequences [14, 16–18]. Focusing on the quantiﬁcation of a speciﬁc
biomarker for the early detection of AD, the main objective of this work addressed the
preliminary analysis of a low-cost portable point-of-care testing platform for the
detection and sensitive quantiﬁcation of the unfolded p53 protein. This study speciﬁ-
cally reported the design of the sensing probe, with particular attention to the choice of
materials and geometry and of the electronic circuit devoted to the conditioning and
acquisition of the electric signal. In particular, the electrodes were designed to be easily
implemented by means of screen printing methodology. Considering the whole testing
workﬂow and without losing the possibility of generalization, preliminary results were
obtained on controlled concentrations of electrolytic solution, on the quantiﬁcation of
antibodies coating through EIS and of interleukin concentration through ASV.

Materials and Methods
The development of the platform (Fig. 1) speciﬁcally included both the design of the
sensing probe—produced with screen printing technology—with particular attention to
the choice of the materials and geometry, and of the electronic circuit devoted to the
conditioning and acquisition of the transduced electric signal.

Speciﬁcally, silver, carbon and silver-silver chloride were selected respectively to
realize conductive tracks, working and counter electrode, reference electrode in a
three-electrodes conﬁguration focusing on anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV).
The design of the circuit was in particular performed by implementing the func-
tionalities of potentiostats. Using four Operational Ampliﬁers (OpAmp), the input
signal applied to WE is regulated precisely during time, with respect to RE. The current
from redox reactions of silver, selectively deposited where proteins are recognized on
WE surface, is recorded thanks to a current to voltage converter. All SMD components
were carefully selected depending on the speciﬁc function they had to perform in the
circuit, in order to guarantee high accuracy and precision.
After completing the production of biosensor and circuit (Fig. 1), the compatibility
of the materials and of the printing process with wet lab practices was evaluated and the
protocol for sensor functionalization was optimized.
Preliminary tests of the circuit were then performed recording changes in the
conductivity of NaCl solution and quantifying electrodes coating with antibodies using
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) principle.
The ﬁrst test was performed varying the concentration of NaCl in order to change
the conductivity of the solution and evaluating the ability of the circuit to quantify these
variations as changes in the current peak between WE and CE. In the second test, EIS
principle was applied in order to measure changes of system impedance, resulting in
changes in the current detected between WE and CE deriving from different concen-
trations of the primary antibodies released and adhered on WE surface after an over-
night coating. EIS measurements were performed in presence of a conductive
electrolytic an solution of 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M KCl.
In both protocols, drops of 2 ml of the conductive solution were released on WE,
CE and RE in order to allow current ﬂow, triangular waves were given as input at
speciﬁc frequencies using a pulse generator and the output voltage form the mea-
surement circuit, proportional to the current ﬂowing between WE and CE, was
recorded using an oscilloscope.
Finally, a preliminary calibration of the platform using ASV measurements was
performed quantifying interleukin protein. ASV protocol adopted was characterized by
a speciﬁc functionalization of the WE using immucomplexes formed by a capture and a
detection antibody, using a dedicated kit (DuoSet® development system for ELISA,
Human CXCL8/IL-8). In order to perform the detection step, Alkaline Phosphatase
(AP) was used to label the secondary antibodies, thus allowing a selective silver
deposition, proportional to the amount of proteins detected. Finally, after placing a drop
of buffer solution on the three electrodes, a ramp input was given to the WE, causing
the oxidation of the deposited silver, and the current ﬂowing between WE and CE was
measured, allowing a sensitive quantiﬁcation of the proteins.

functionalization steps and moreover appeared to allow an homogeneous passive
coating of primary antibodies, conﬁrmed both from optical and from impedance
measurements (Fig. 2).
Results from the evaluation of circuit response to changes in saline solution con-
ductivity showed a particular trend, characterized by two different slopes respectively
for concentration of NaCl lower and higher than 1.0 mg/ml.
In particular (Fig. 3), a higher sensitivity was shown for concentrations lower than
1.0 mg/ml, indicating a higher sensitivity of the sensor (0.2 mA/(mg/ml)) for small
changes of conductivity and small currents, and a lower sensitivity (20 µA/(mg/ml)) for
higher concentration.
Results from EIS measurements showed a proportional decreasing of the peak of
current ﬂowing between CE and WE, indicating an increased impedance of the system
due to an increasing concentration of antibodies coated on WE surfaces resulting in a
reduced electrons exchange between WE surface and electrolytic solution (Fig. 4).
Increasing the concentration of antibodies coated on the WE resulted in reducing the
differences of currents exchanged at different frequencies. The sensitivity of the sensor
in detecting the change in antibodies coating concentration was of 80 µA/µg.

Results from ASV measurements showed an increase in the maximum peak of
current proportional to the increase of interleukin concentration. A linear increase of
current peaks recorded when increasing the input potential from 0 to 0.6 V could be
observed, with a sensitivity of 35 µA/ng (Fig. 5).

Conclusion
In light of the positive results described, the study is on-going and further analyses will
include ASV tests of unknown concentration of unfolded p53 in samples of real
patients, comparing the results with the ones obtained from ELISA analysis.
Moreover, the activity actually going on refers to the implementation of the ASV
protocol with a multi wells conformation of biosensor geometry, in order to optimize
the protocol and reduce the variability. After the validation, the proposed methodology
and the platform design will be optimized in order to be easily accessible for a routine
automatized diagnosis technique in the clinical environment. From these bases, par-
ticular attention will be then addressed to increase the sensitivity of the method itself,
including both the introduction of nanostructured materials for the working electrodes
and proper ASV measurements. All this, with the aim to realize an innovative
self-standing portable point-of-care, a low cost, easy to use and highly precise platform
able to support clinicians to diagnose AD from its earliest stages.

Abstract. In last years the authors have investigated nonlinear systems for
vibrational energy harvesting. Nonlinear conﬁgurations have been demonstrated
that, under the proper conditions, can provide better performance, compared to
linear resonant oscillators, in terms of the amount of energy extracted from
environmental wide spectrum mechanical vibrations. In particular, the authors
presented the results of investigations on a system exploiting the advantages of a
nonlinear bistable Snap-Through-Buckling (STB) conﬁguration and two
piezoelectric transducers placed at the locations of the two stable states (the
position of the two minima of the bistable potential underpinning the dynamics
of the system). The device investigated was shown to be capable of providing
sufﬁcient electrical energy to power an RF transmitter. However, in order to
properly design the harvester an analytical model is necessary. The authors are
investigating different nonlinear models. In this work, a comparison between
two different theoretical models for the STB beam is discussed.

Introduction
The development of systems aimed at powering electronic devices by exploiting the
energy scavenged from their operating environment is an important line of research
driven by the real needs to reduce the dependency on battery power.
The proliferation of small sensors, often networked or deployed in remote regions
makes the dependency on battery power an important issue. For instance, wireless
sensors might be placed in isolated locations or unsafe environments without the
possibility to connect to the main power supply lines; in this case, it would certainly be
inconvenient if a battery had to be replaced regularly [1]. A well designed energy
harvester (EH), integrated with the sensor, can reduce or possibly eliminate this
dependency.
Many different environmental power sources can be exploited to scavenge energy,
well known solutions are the solar energy conversion [2], the thermoelectric power
generation [3], the radio-frequency (RF) power conversion [4]. In recent times

particular attention has been devoted to the mechanical vibration sources [5] because of
their ubiquity and the availability of new high-performance materials that can be used
to convert mechanical vibrations to a suitable electrical response.
Typical solutions to scavenge energy from vibrations are based on linear resonant
mechanical structures like cantilever beams exploiting piezoelectric, macro-ﬁber
composites, electromagnetic or electrostatic conversion mechanism. Such kind of
solutions are able to efﬁciently harvest energy when stimulated very close to their
resonance frequency [6]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the
exploitation of nonlinear mechanisms such as bistable systems [7], can outperform
traditional (linear) energy harvesters under the right set of operating conditions.
A possible conﬁguration implementing a nonlinear bistable energy harvester is the
Snap Through Buckling structure. The bistable system is a special type of nonlinear
structures underpinned by a two well potential energy [7, 8].
The STB conﬁguration allows the inertial mass embedded in the harvester to travel
rapidly between the two (stable) equilibrium positions under external mechanical
vibrations regardless of their frequencies. This makes possible to access the energy
contained in low amplitude wideband vibrations. Moreover, the bistable dynamics
yields enhanced device behavior in terms of an extension of the frequency band within
which the device is able to scavenge energy from vibrations [9]. This effect represents
the main advantage of the nonlinear harvesting setup over the linear one.
The authors are investigating the mechanical and electrical behavior of buckled
beam based nonlinear energy harvesters [9–13] like the one shown in Fig. 1. In par-
ticular, in [9] a low cost solution based on a bistable beam and two piezoelectric
transducers exploiting the beneﬁts of a Snap Through Buckling (STB) conﬁguration was
presented. In [11] the authors presented preliminary experimental results showing the
capability of the nonlinear bistable energy harvester discussed in [9] to power (without
batteries) a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) wireless transmitter @ 2.4 GHz. In [12],
the use of rapid prototyping techniques for the realization of a nonlinear energy har-
vester has been introduced. The device exploits the beneﬁts of bistable dynamics and a
screen printed piezoelectric layer. The latter was electrically connected using Inter-
DigiTed electrodes (IDT) realized by the inkjet printing of a silver based solution on a
ﬂexible PET (PolyEthyleneTerephthalate) substrate.
In [13], a comparison between two different theoretical models describing the
mechanical behavior of the STB beam has been discussed and quantiﬁed by experi-
mental evidence. In addition, preliminary results demonstrating the possibility of
exploiting the device in the presence of noise, under some speciﬁc operating condi-
tions, were reported.
In [14] preliminary results from the investigations aimed to understand the behavior
and the performances of the STB harvester for a different position of the two stable
states are presented. In particular, compared to [9] where the two piezoelectric trans-
ducers were placed at the stable minima of the potential energy function, here they have
been placed near the inﬂection points of the potential energy function that underpins
the dynamics of the nonlinear bistable beam. From a practical point of view and with
reference to the schematic shown in Fig. 1, it means that the distance Dx between the
two piezoelectrics has been reduced. This makes the STB beam to assume a new
“constrained” bistable conﬁguration. The main advantage of this is in the lower
250

accelerations required to switch the beam between the two new constrained stable
states.
It should be highlighted that the availability of an EH with a wide frequency
bandwidth, ranging from very low frequency (in the order of 0.5 Hz and below) up to
10 Hz, is important for a number of real applications.
However, in order to understand the system behavior and optimize its performance
by properly design the EH, both in the mechanical and electrical domains, an analytical
model is necessary. In this paper, a comparison between two different theoretical
models for the mechanical behavior of the STB beam is discussed and supported by
experimental evidences.

The Non Linear Energy Harvester
A schematic of the nonlinear bistable harvester is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a
clamped-clamped cantilever beam with a pre-compression applied along the Y axis (in
a STB conﬁguration), a proof mass placed in the middle of the beam and two lateral
identical piezoelectric transducers. The beam is a strip of ﬂexible PET whose
Fig. 1. Schematization of the nonlinear bistable STB harvester [16]

dimensions are 9 cm by 1 cm while its thickness is 140 µm. Two dedicated clamps
have been used to block the beam on both ends along the Y axis and to adjust the
pre-compression. It should be obvious that changing the pre-compression affects the
switching dynamics, e.g. the average switching rate, of the device. The behavior of
the device for different values of the pre-compression has been investigated in [9].
On the basis of the results obtained in [9], for the device investigated through this paper,
the beam pre-compression has been ﬁxed to DY = 3 mm, for the sake of convenience.
In this conﬁguration, the beam exhibits a bistable behavior when a stress is applied
perpendicular to its surface. In case the input stimulus exceeds the switching threshold,
which is mainly deﬁned by the pre-compression as well as the beam material and
geometry, the beam will start switching between its stable positions. In case of a
subthreshold signal the beam will vibrate close to one of the two stable states. This
behavior is well described and ruled by a two-stable-state potential [9, 12, 13]. It should
be obvious that in the bistable potential energy function that describes the dynamics,
the energy barrier height as well as the locations of the stable minima of the potential,
are a function of the pre-compression.
A proof mass of 9.7 g is used to optimize the trade-off between the operative
frequency band and the minimum force that allows the switching. The proof mass has
been designed and installed in order to maintain, as much as possible, the device
symmetry and to reduce the beam tilt effect.
The piezoelectric transducers, manufactured by Midè (model Volture V21BL), are
ultra-thin and light weight devices which convert the beam impacts (in each steady
state) into electric charges. The dimensions of the piezoelectric transducers are 9.04 cm
by 1.68 cm, while the thickness is 0.8 mm.
The distance between the piezoelectric transducers is ﬁxed to 21 mm, which
roughly corresponds to the distance Dx between the two stable positions of the beam.
The behavior of the lab prototype has been experimentally investigated by a ded-
icated set-up. The main component of the set-up is the shaker, consisting of an alu-
minum movable platform actuated by a vibration exciter and controlled by a power
ampliﬁer. The vibration exciter and the power ampliﬁer are the TV 51110 and the BAA
120 manufactured by TIRA GmbH, respectively. The STB has been ﬁxed on the
movable platform of the vibration exciter.
A reference accelerometer, model MMA7331L by Freescale Semiconductor with a
sensitivity S = 83.6 mV/g (conﬁgured in the operating range of ±12 g), has been also
included in order to perform an independent measurement of the imposed stimulus.
Moreover, a distance measurement module, model QTR-1A by Pololu, including a
very small reﬂectance InfraRed (IR) sensor and the conditioning electronics, has been
included in the STB architecture to continuously monitor the displacement of the proof
mass [15, 16]. The output signals from the piezoelectric transducers, the reﬂectance
infrared sensor and the reference accelerometer have been acquired by the MSO9064A
scope by Agilent Technologies with a sampling frequency fs = 10 kHz, saved and
processed by dedicated Matlab paradigms.

The Models for the STB Beam
As already stated before, the beam exhibits a bistable behavior in response to stresses
applied perpendicular to its surface. A second order dynamical model ﬁtting the
nonlinear mechanical behavior of the system was presented in [9–12]. A nonlinear
quartic potential energy function was used to describe the bistable behavior.
However, the authors are investigating the possibility to adopt new models to better
describe the behavior of the device. In this work a ﬁrst order dynamical model to ﬁt the
dynamic nonlinear mechanical behavior, stemming from the experimental observed
behavior of the system of Fig. 1 is presented:
s_x  WðxÞ ¼ FðtÞ
ð1Þ
where s is the system time constant, _x is the velocity of the beam, FðtÞ is a stochastic
source characterizing the external mechanical vibrations, and WðxÞ ¼ @UðxÞ=@x is
the restoring force, with U(x) the potential energy function.
In the following, we compare the model (1) performance with two different non-
linear bistable potentials, a quartic potential and a “soft” hyperbolic one that better
reproduces the dynamic behavior observed in the experiments:
UqðxÞ ¼ 1
4 a  x4  1
2 b  x2
ð2Þ
UhðxÞ ¼ 1
2  x2  a0ln coshðb0  xÞ
ð3Þ
By substituting Eqs. (2) and (3), in Eq. (1) the following two dynamical models are
obtained, respectively:
s  _x þ a  x3  b  x ¼ FðtÞ
ð4Þ
s  _x þ x  a0b0 tanhðb0  xÞ ¼ FðtÞ
ð5Þ
The coefﬁcients (a, b) and (a′, b′) were determined via a Nelder-Mead optimization
algorithm implemented through a dedicated Matlab script exploiting the following
minimization index:

Here, xMeas and xPred refer to the measured and predicted displacement of the
bistable device, respectively. The values of the parameters in (4) and (5) estimated by
the optimization algorithm are a = 6.2e−3 N/m3, b = 0.86 N/m, a0 = 75.9 m/N,
b0 = 0.16 N/m.

Experimental Results and Conclusions
Figures 2 and 3 show the experimental displacement of the beam in response to a
sinusoidal stimulation at 5 and 6 Hz, respectively, for two values of the acceleration, 6.3
and 7.3 m/s2, compared to the displacement predicted by the two models (4) and (5).
The ﬁtting of the two investigated models with the hysteretic relationship of the
accelerations versus displacement, in case of a sinusoidal stimulation of 6.3 m/s2 at
6 Hz is shown in Fig. 4a, b, respectively.
Finally, a reconstruction of the potential by using the parameters identiﬁed for the
two models is given in Fig. 5.
The results show a good ﬁtting of both models with real data; however the model
(5) shows a slightly better ﬁt than the model (4). This difference stems from the
(different) topologies of the potential energy functions in (2) and (3). Actually, potential
(3) better describes the observed non-linearity of the device under investigation.

Abstract. Devices that measure the strain applied to a body can ﬁnd several
applications in many ﬁelds, especially if they are able to satisfy precise speci-
ﬁcations about power supply and transmission of information. Telemetric sys-
tems offer a viable solution, since they rely on the inductive coupling between
the coils connected to a passive sensor and a readout unit. Therefore, they
require neither batteries nor wired connections. The present work illustrates a
preliminary analysis on a telemetric device made of Printed Circuit Board
(PCB) planar inductors and a resistive strain gauge fabricated through inkjet
printing on a ﬂexible substrate. We carried out experimental tests to evaluate
system frequency behaviour. Firstly, we measured its impedance phase at
readout inductor terminals while varying sensor resistance, with the inductors
put at a ﬁxed relative distance. Then, we repeated the same operation when that
distance changed, with strain gauge at rest position. Obtained results report a
total variation of phase most sensitive point of about 0.12° for a strain equal to
1% of sensor length at rest, suggesting that measuring strain with such a
structure is feasible. On the other hand, they highlight that distance variation has
a strong inﬂuence on that result; thus, it has to be taken into account during
measurement process.

Introduction
Measuring strain is fundamental for applications dealing with Structural Health
Monitoring (SHM) [1], which range from transportation [2], to building [3] ﬁelds. They
aim at acquiring important information about the condition of systems, like vehicles
and civil infrastructures, in order to prevent their failures [1]. In fact, such events could
have a tremendous impact on human safety and have high costs to be solved. Fur-
thermore, strain is a magnitude exploited also in medical sector to control vital
parameters like bladder volume [4] or joint angles during movement [5].

Among all the examples, literature reports the use of strain gauges [6], optical
ﬁber-based instruments [7] and piezoelectric sensors [8]. However, these devices need
meeting strict requirements that concern power supplies and data transmission, espe-
cially when they have to operate in environments that require to be kept isolated from
the outside or are characterized by harsh working conditions. For instance, use of
batteries or wired connections is unsuitable, since it would imply a perturbation (at least
periodic) of the environment. On the other hand, active circuits could not withstand its
harsh characteristics. In addition, device costs and dimensions should not be too high.
A viable solution is given by telemetric systems. They are made of a readout
module that supplies a passive sensor and receives strain information from it, thanks to
the inductive coupling generated between two inductors, one connected to the former
and one to the latter, respectively. With such a structure, sensing circuit composed by
sensor and the corresponding inductor can be put inside measurement environment and
it can work without batteries or cables. On the other side, information is treated by
readout module positioned outside.
Most telemetric systems described in the literature operate with inductive [9] or
capacitive [10] sensing elements. They present a LC oscillator as sensing circuit, whose
resonant frequency is detected, since it varies as strain changes. On the contrary, this
work illustrates an analysis carried out on a device equipped with a strain gauge that
has a resistive output. In addition, sensor has been fabricated through inkjet printing on
a ﬂexible substrate. This is a promising technology for the easy production of cheap
components [6]. In fact, a common CAD software can be used to draw a pattern
followed by the printer during ink deposition, whereas its process does not require
masks or complex treating steps. Furthermore, realized elements have good charac-
teristics [6] and they can be printed on materials that adapt to different surfaces.
Next section will describe the parts that form this system. Then, performed studies
will be illustrated and obtained results will be reported.

scheme, together
with its components.
Inkjet-printed strain gauge was made by using silver nanoparticles-based ink Metalon®
JS-015, from NovaCentrix, deposited on a ﬂexible substrate of Polyethylene tereph-
thalate (PET). Table 1 lists its characteristics.
In particular, we measured its output at rest with digital multimeter 34401 A, from
Agilent, whereas we obtained an estimation for its gage factor through a speciﬁc
analysis for its characterization.
Planar inductors were realized through common PCB techniques, on a rigid sub-
strate of FR4 epoxy glass. The one joined to printed strain gauge is called “sensing
inductor”, whereas that connected to readout module is named “readout inductor”.
Their properties are reported in Table 2.
Electrical characteristics, i.e. inductance, parasitic resistance and parasitic capaci-
tance, are the elements of an equivalent circuit used to represent the inductors [11]. We

found them with an HP4194A impedance analyzer. Then, we added a commercial
capacitance equal to about 560 pF in parallel to sensing inductor in order to adjust its
resonant frequency to a desirable value.

troller from National Instruments.

Study on the System
We analyzed system frequency behavior to investigate the possibility of measuring
strain through telemetric techniques, by measuring its electrical impedance at readout
inductor terminals.
3.1
Experimental Setup
We performed experimental tests on the setup whose scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Strain gauge was kept at the right position through the apparatus shown in Fig. 3. We
immobilized one of its edges to a ﬁxed support, while the other was clamped to another
structure that could move along its longitudinal axis thanks to a micrometric screw with
a resolution of 10 lm.
We used both screw graduated scale and a digital microscope to evaluate such
movement. Then, we maintained the inductors parallel and coaxial thanks to a
mechanical structure whose supports can be moved through micrometric screws. It is
exploited also to set the correct distance between them. Finally, readout inductor was
connected to HP4194A analyzer, driven by laptop for impedance detection.
3.2
Strain Variation
During the ﬁrst kind of tests, we applied an increasing pulling force on the sensor, with
the aid of ﬁxing system micrometric screw, in order to induce different levels of
deformation to it, until about 1% of its length at rest was achieved. After each step, we
have been maintaining the reached position for about a minute. We used the digital

microscope as an aid to assess the actual elongation. Distance between the inductors
was kept ﬁxed at 12 mm. At the same time, we continuously executed a frequency
sweep from 1.5 to 2.3 MHz and we acquired data about impedance phase variation due
to a change in sensor output. Furthermore, readout module saved all the information for
further elaboration.
3.3
Distance Variation
During the second tests, we moved mechanical structure supports to change the dis-
tance between the inductors from 6 to 20 mm, whereas we maintained the strain gauge
at rest position. As before, for each distance reached (veriﬁed through screws graduated
scale), we detected impedance phase in a frequency interval from 1.5 to 2.3 MHz, and
we saved all the data.

Results and Discussion
4.1
Strain Variation
Figure 4 shows some of the obtained curves of impedance phase u as a function of
frequency f, each corresponding to an achieved strain level. An inset highlights the
frequency range around phase minimum umin. It helps to appreciate that impedance
varies when an increasing pulling force is applied to the sensor, for a distance between
the inductors kept ﬁxed. In fact, sensor resistance augments, affecting whole system
frequency response.
In our analysis, we focused on phase minimum, since it is the point most sensitive
to deformation variation. Figure 5 reports its trend as a function of strain e. We found
that, during the entire test, it changed from about 72.79° to about 72.67°, i.e. an average
total decrease of about 0.12°. Despite this limited quantity, we were able to distinguish

a linear dependence of phase on strain (in fact, coefﬁcient of determination R2 is more
than 0.99). Furthermore, maximum deviation from mean values was about 0.005°.
These results allow to observe the feasibility of a methodology based on ﬁnding the
strain applied to a sensor (in particular, to an inkjet-printed element) in an indirect way,
i.e. starting from an analysis of whole system impedance.

4.2
Distance Variation
Figure 6 reports some of the phase curves acquired during the second analysis, for
every considered distance d.
They highlight that such variable affects heavily system impedance, compared to a
change in sensor output (even considering the huge entity of its variation), since it has a
big effect on the inductive coupling between the coils [11]. In particular, phase min-
imum presents a total decrease of about 28° when they get closer up to 6 mm, as
illustrated in Fig. 7, which shows it as a function of distance. Therefore, they have to be
kept always at a constant relative position during measurement procedure, in order to
avoid distance inﬂuence to lead to mistakes that could compromise a correct strain
estimation. Furthermore, Fig. 6 indicates that, the more they get far from each other,
the more difﬁcult is to detect a change in system frequency response. For this reason,
they have to be placed in a suitable position.
In addition, we interpolated phase minimum points, ﬁnding that their trend follows
a second-order polynomial function (with a coefﬁcient of determination R2 greater than
0.999), whose equation is reported in Fig. 7. Such expression could be exploited to
predict system behavior at a speciﬁc distance.

Conclusions
This work has presented a study on a telemetric device made of PCB inductors and a
resistive strain gauge fabricated through inkjet printing on a ﬂexible substrate. Firstly,
we analyzed system frequency response by reading its impedance phase when a pulling
force was applied to the sensor, while inductors were at a ﬁxed relative distance. Then,
we repeated the same measurement, but when the inductors got closer, with strain
gauge at rest position. After having illustrated the system, used experimental appara-
tuses have been described. Afterwards, performed tests and achieved results have been
presented. On one side, they demonstrate the feasibility of ﬁnding information on the
output of an inkjet-printed sensor from a reading of whole system impedance, showing
that such a device could be useful when measurement environment does not permit to
employ components such as cabled connections, batteries or active circuits. On the
other side, distance between the inductors is a variable that could potentially affect ﬁnal
strain estimation; thus, it should be kept ﬁxed during measurement procedure or, as an
alternative, its variation should be compensated.

Abstract. A peculiar experimental conﬁguration of a gas chromatograph
(GC) coupled, by a splitter, to two detectors, i.e. a mass spectrometer (MS) and a
semiconducting gas sensor (SGS), operating in dual mode, was arranged.
A suitable breath sampling system was used to sample the alveolar air volume in
a bag from the air volume of a single expiration by discarding the dead volume.
Breath volatiles (VOCs) were isolated and preconcentrated by solid-phase
microextraction (SPME). Breath tests on alveolar air sampled by a sample of
smokers volunteers were carried out. Statistical analysis techniques (descriptive
statistics, Mann-Whitney test, PCA, Probit nonlinear regression model) applied
to GC-MS data and sensor data showed good results in discriminating the subset
of smokers sampled in resting condition (“blank” smokers) and after the action
of smoking a cigarette.

Introduction
Nowadays it’s widely recognized the powerful potential of breath analysis for disease
diagnostics and metabolic status monitoring. On one side, scientiﬁc research is
devoting a lot of efforts in identifying markers of pathologies in exhaled breath by
advanced analytical technologies, as gas chromatography combined with mass spec-
trometry (GC-MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), proton transfer reaction mass
spectrometry (PTR-MS), selected ion ﬂow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) [1–4].
On the other side, instruments as Electronic Noses (e-Noses) mainly based on semi-
conducting gas sensors (SGS), offer a quick and easy-to-use tool for breath analysis
alternative to the above mentioned complex spectrometry techniques. E-Noses devices
are small and portable and they have a potential for point of care applications and in
disease screening in population [5–8, 18–20].

In this work, we try to combine an advanced analytical technique as GC-MS with a
semiconducting gas sensor (SGS) in order to study the ability of SGS to detect breath
VOCs eluting from the gas chromatographic column. This approach looks to the
development of hybrid device based on miniaturized gas chromatographs using gas
sensors detector.
As applicative study we used our experimental system in the analysis of the smoking
status. From a clinical point of view, there is a need for method to detect active smoking.
This is because some patients do not admit to being smokers and recognize smoking a
smaller numbers of cigarettes than what has actually been smoked. Moreover, it well
recognized that smoking habit is a risk factor for lung diseases, such as lung cancer,
chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Different VOCs have been proposed as smoking
breath biomarkers (carbon monoxide, 2,5-dimethylfuran, benzene, toluene, xylene,
1,3-butadiene, acetonitrile), but the correlation between a single compound and proof of
smoking habit is complex and dependent on other factors (other exogenous sources
different from cigarettes, co-indication of other diseases different from smoking, heavily
time dependent concentrations, large variability) [9–17].
Here, we identiﬁed and quantiﬁed the VOCs present in the alveolar breath samples
of a small group of smokers, sampled both in resting condition and after a recent action
of cigarette smoke. We used the pattern of the only VOCs with statistically relevance to
perform statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney test, predictive Progit model) in order
to asses recent smoke use. The same statistical analysis techniques were also applied to
the continuous sensorgrams (i.e. electrical sensor signals vs. time), preprocessed by
Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Materials and Methods
2.1
Subjects
Breath analyses were conducted in 16 healthy adult volunteers with smoking habits.
The smokers individuals (cod. Fi_jbag, i = 1, …, 16, j = 1, 2, 3) were asked to ﬁll three
bags in different times: 1° bag, early morning fasting before smoking ﬁrst cigarette
(resting condition, “blank smokers”), 2° bag after smoking 1° daily cigarette and 3° bag
after n-cigarette daily smoking event. We collected total 48 bags from smokers. In
Fig. 1 a scheme of the study design and groups deﬁnition is shown.
2.2
Breath Sampling
We sampled the alveolar air of the smokers volunteers by a commercial breath sam-
pling system (QUINTRON, USA). The system consisting in a special 3-way valve and
two bags is able to discard the expired air contained in the ﬁrst respiratory airways
(dead-volume) and collect the only alveolar air. A closed 1-way stopcock has to be
inserted into a small Luer Port on the alveolar air collecting bag prior to breath sam-
pling. The patient is asked for doing a single deep exhalation through the mouthpiece
of the system. When discard bag is full, a membrane-valve opens automatically and the
second bag ﬁlls with the alveolar breath.

Experimental Procedure
We arranged an uncommon and peculiar conﬁguration of a gas chromatograph
(GC) coupled, by a splitter, to two detectors, i.e. a mass spectrometer (MS) and a
semiconducting gas sensor (SGS), operating in dual mode. The experimental set-up is
sketched in Fig. 2. The GC-MS analysis was performed on Agilent 5973 mass spec-
trometer (MSD) coupled with 6890 N series gas chromatograph (Agilent Technolo-
gies) with a split-splitless injector. The injector temperature was 250 °C. A DB-WAX
capillary column (60 m, 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 lm thickness) was used. The oven tem-
perature program was as follows: initial 40 °C held for 5 min; them ramped at
3 °C/min to 140 °C held for 10 min, then ramped to 230 °C and held for 3 min.
Electron impact ionization was applied at 70 eV. The MS analyses were carried out in
full-scan mode with a scan range 30–500 amu at 3.2 scans/s. The identiﬁcation of the
volatile compounds were achieved by comparing mass spectra with those of the data
system library (NIST 98, P > 80%). A manual SPME holder with black coated ﬁber
(Supelco, Bellefonte, USA) was introduced in the septum adjusted in the Luer port of
the bag, and the ﬁber exposed to collected alveolar air for 30 min. During SPME
exposure the bag was heated at 38 °C to avoid breath sample condensation. Semi-
quantitative analysis method by an Internal standard (bromobenzene, 23 ppbv), added
by a suitable multi-steps dilution into the collecting bag, was used.
A tiny home-made sensor-chamber in Teﬂon was adjusted at the second detector
port of the gas chromatograph; the reduced size of the cell was necessary not to lose the

GC system’s ability to temporally separate the compounds eluting from the column.
A commercial micromachined SnO2-based sensor (Silsens srl, Switzerland) was used
as semiconducting gas sensor. The sensor resistance was read by a Keithley 2700
multimeter. After SPME injection, for each collected breath sample chromatogram and
sensorgram were acquired simultaneously in the same run test.

Results
Our experimental set-up gave us the opportunity to join two goals: (1) study the altered
breath composition after smoking, by identifying the chemical pattern of VOCs present
in the breath of a smoker, and (2) evaluate the sensing properties of a semiconducting
gas sensor to these breath VOCs. As an example, a temporal overlapping of a chro-
matogram and the corresponding sensorgram during a run test is showed in Fig. 3 for a
smoker F8 after her 1st daily smoked cigarette (sample cod.F8_2bag). It can be
observed that the resistance of the sensor varies during the chromatographic run fol-
lowing the elution of the compounds from the column. Therefore, the modulation of the
sensor signal, containing the information on the composition of the sample analyzed,
demonstrates the feasibility of using the sensor as a gas chromatograph detector Next,
the dual signals (chromatogram and sensorgram) for all the breath samples of the
experimental campaign were used in the statistical analysis aiming to identify the
VOCs markers of the recent use of tobacco and classify the subset group of smokers
after a smoking event to the subset of the same smokers in resting condition.

Eighty-three different compounds were identiﬁed in collected breath samples by
GC/MS analysis. Their concentration was calculated by normalizing picks areas to
internal standard area and referring to its concentration. For calculations of statistical
signiﬁcance, two-sided testing was used, and p < 0.05 was considered as signiﬁcant. In
particular, a non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney test) was used to compare the
“blank smokers” group with the group of smokers after a smoking action and select the
most signiﬁcant statistical differences in terms of VOCs variables. The statistical relevant
variables were: (a) toluene, (b) pyridine, (c) pyrrole, (d) benzene, (e) 2-butanone,
(f) 2-pentanone, (g) 1-methyldecyclamine.
Descriptive statistic results (median, 25th–75th percentiles, minimum/maximum)
for these compounds were calculated; we found that the action of smoking a cigarette
altered the breath pattern by increasing the levels of the identiﬁed VOCs with statistical
relevance. As an example, the box-whisker plot related to toluene (concentrations are in
ppbv) for “blank smokers” and smokers groups is shown in Fig. 4.

In a next step we performed a predictive regression analysis. For GC-MS based
data, we didn’t consider the 7 individual VOCs with statistical relevance as breath
markers of the recent use of tobacco, attributing to each of them a predictive power;
whereas we used their pattern to assess if a smoking event occurred, hence attributing
to the 7-VOCs chemical patterns a marker characteristic. At this aim by non linear
Probit Regression was applied to the matrix of 7-VOCs predictors and a prediction of
class membership to the groups of “blank” smokers and smokers after smoking was
get. In this case a very good prediction (p < 0.01) was obtained with both high sen-
sitivity (84%) and speciﬁcity (100%) (Table 1). The high sensitivity means that it’s
possible to correctly detect smokers, who effectively smoked before testing, as smokers
after a smoking event. The full speciﬁcity means that it’s possible to correctly identify
smokers, who effectively abstained from smoking before testing. Such information are
fundamental for doctors to assess the degree of compliance with a smoking cessation
program.
For sensor-based data, sensorgrams were preprocessed by Principal Component
Analysis. Mann-Whitney test selected the PCs with statistical relevance (p < 0.05) and
the patterns of these PCs were used as predictive variables in the Probit model. Table 2
shows the confusion matrix of predictive Progit model (p = 0.0088170) applied to
sensor data. The results can be considered satisfactory.

Conclusion
An unconventional experimental conﬁguration of a gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to
two detectors (Mass Spectrometer, MS) and a semiconducting gas sensor was satis-
factory arranged. The experimental set-up was exploited in a challenging application of
breath analysis. In particular, we consider smokers volunteers as a natural study group of
healthy individuals for testing whether breath analysis can be used to recognize the
recent use of tobacco. As consequence of an action of smoking a cigarette the levels of
some
VOCs
(toluene,
pyridine,
pyrrole,
benzene,
2-butanone,
2-pentanone,
1-methyldecyclamine) in the exhaled air, increase compared to the reference levels in
the breath proﬁle of a “blank” smoker who really observed abstinence from smoking.
Our statistical approach to data analysis was based on ﬁltering the statistical relevant
variables (VOCs), that highlight the differences between two groups (“blank smokers”
and smokers after smoking) by non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, and in using the
breath patterns of statistically relevant VOCs to assess the membership to the two
classes under analysis by non-linear Probit regression model. The results of the pre-
diction model based on GS-MS dataset showed that it’s easily possible recognize with
high speciﬁcity and sensitivity if a smoking event occur.
Moreover the gas sensor demonstrates its reliability as detector, and the predictive
model applied to the sensor-based data (preprocessed by PCA and Mann-Whitney test)
gave fair results.
However, at present the small sample size used in this study doesn’t allow to establish
statistically signiﬁcant correlations for biomedical considerations. Larger data set are
needed. Work is in progress to extend the experimental campaign to non-smokers vol-
unteers aiming to evaluate which pattern of VOCs is able to distinguish a non-smoker
from a smoker.

Abstract. This work describes a multi-sensor platform for anomalies detection
in human sleep patterns. The inputs of the platform are sequences of human
postures, extensively used for analysis of activities of daily living and, more in
general, for human behaviour understanding. The postures are acquired by using
both ambient and wearable sensors that are time-of-ﬂight 3D vision sensor,
ultra-wideband radar sensor, and three-axial accelerometer. The suggested
platform aims to provide an abstraction layer with respect to the underlying
sensing technologies, exploiting the postural information in common to all
involved sensors (i.e., Standing, Bending, Sitting, Lying down). Furthermore, in
order to ﬁll the lack of datasets containing long-term postural sequences, which
are required in human sleep analysis, a simulator of activities of daily
living/postures has been proposed. The capability of the platform in providing a
sensing invariant interface (i.e., abstracted from any speciﬁc sensing technology)
was demonstrated by preliminary results, exhibiting high accuracy in sleep
anomalies detection using the three aforementioned sensors.

Introduction
The demography distribution of the developed world is set to change dramatically over
the coming decades. Current trends show that the elderly people population is increasing
in size and this phenomenon is predicted to continue in the future [1]. This trend of
population ageing is as a result of reductions in fertility combined with increases in life
expectancy. Although the latter issue is a positive situation, a number of related effects
require consideration. In the last years, two priorities in research are investigated: (a) to
establish novel and effective methods for assessment of activity levels in the home, and
(b) to establish appropriate methods for the long term monitoring and management of
chronic conditions with the purpose of alleviating the increased strain on healthcare
resources. The use of sensor technologies within intelligent environments (IEs) is one
such approach which has the potential to facilitate these needs. IEs can provide objective
data describing behaviour and health status, facilitating the development of novel
activity recognition, assisted living, or healthcare monitoring solutions. Moreover, the

current technologies, such as smart sensors, allows to keep the privacy and let the
end-users to live in their own homes reducing the need for assistance from medical staff
or caregiver. Integrated platforms of heterogeneous smart sensors are becoming more
and more a key technology player in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) scenarios.
Moreover, advancement in sensor technologies give us the opportunity to recognize
ADLs [2] for a long-period of time. Continuous monitoring of ADLs is helpful for
detection of lifestyle disorders. Irregular human sleep patterns, for example, may cause
health problems, such as disorders of psychological or neurological nature. Conse-
quently, early detection of sleep anomalies can be useful for the prevention of such
problems. In literature many approaches have been proposed for only monitoring human
behaviour, reporting information about user’s health and life patterns [3, 4]. On the other
hand, in [5–7] some methodologies for the detection of anomalies in behaviour pattern
are described. In the above systems set of features obtained from raw data provided by
speciﬁc sensor technology are considered (e.g. pressure sensor, motion sensor, IR
sensor, wearable sensor…). In these works, using probabilistic approach, the detection
of sleep anomalies is reached with a good level of accuracy. However, these systems
have some limitations. In fact, they do not have the ability to manage long-term data and
in some circumstances a training phase is required.
This paper reports the description of a multi-sensor platform for detection of
anomalies in human sleep patterns within AAL context. The input of the system is
constituted by sequences of human postures generated using an activity simulation
approach speciﬁcally designed and implemented within this work. The simulator
provides sequences of postures according to a calibrated simulation based on real-life
experiments conducted with three different sensors: a Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor, a
Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar and a ST MEMS three-axial accelerometer (ACC). The
use of postures is motivated by their extensive use in ADLs modelling [8], besides that
ADL sequences allow to model human behaviour. The main contribution of this work
is related to the design and development of a platform for automatic detection of
anomalies in sleep patterns by using an unsupervised methodology. It is important to
highlight the platform capability in providing a technology invariant interface abstract
from any speciﬁc sensing technology. The preliminary results show the ability of the
presented approach to detect with good accuracy sleep/wake phases for subsequent
medical evaluation of sleep disorders.

Materials and Methods
The platform architecture is organized, as shown in Fig. 1, in three main layers:
detection layer, simulation layer, reasoning layer.
2.1
Detection Layer
Human postures can be detected by using several sensing approaches implemented
with either ambient or wearable solutions. In this paper, three different kind of sensing
approaches are taken into account: (1) TOF 3D vision, (2) UWB radar and (3) ACC.
The ﬁrst two (TOF, UWB) approaches refer to ambient solutions, whereas the last one

falls into wearable ones. All these posture detection approaches are differently char-
acterized in terms of invasiveness, accuracy, robustness to object occlusion and clut-
tering and data richness, as summarized in Table 1.
The aforementioned devices, the related mounting setups, the logical platforms for
posture classiﬁcation are described in the last works of the authors [9, 10], allowing
posture analysis in different ways. For the purpose of this study, four main postures
have been considered such as Standing (ST), Bending (BE), Sitting (SI) and Lying
down (Ly), although the vision-based system is able to recognize a great number of
postures, with greater accuracy (Fig. 2).
For the assessment of the sensor’s accuracy with respect to the posture recognition
task, a common experimental framework has been used, in which eighteen healthy
subjects (9 males and 9 females, age 38 ± 6 years, height 175 ± 20 cm, weight
75 ± 22 kg) have been involved. The participants performed typical ADLs such as
household tasks, meal preparation, feeding, sitting and watching TV, relaxing and
sleeping. During such experimental sessions, data were collected simultaneously by a
TOF sensor, a UWB radar and a MEMS accelerometer worn by participants.

2.2
Simulation Layer
Since the availability of datasets for behaviour analysis is limited by difﬁculties
associated with the collection of such data, and considered the lack of datasets con-
taining long-term postural sequences, a simulator of ADLs/postures has been imple-
mented. The simulator provides synthetic data with the ability to rapidly generate a
large simulated dataset driven by different parameters which allow to reproduce dif-
ferent normal/abnormal behaviours (in particular human sleep patterns).
The simulator is composed by two stages; the ﬁrst for simulation of long-term
ADLs/postures, the last for a calibrated simulation of long-term postures referred to a
speciﬁc sensing approach.
Long-term ADL/posture simulator. The general architecture of the simulator is
inspired from the work of Noury et al. [11]. The authors assumed that the daily
activities of a subject are almost regular. Thus, the simulator (of which a schematic
representation with their logic modules is reported in Fig. 3) is based on a Markov
model with homogeneous periods. As shown in the ﬁgure, the day is segmented into
seven periods (e.g., wake up, morning, lunch, afternoon, dinner, going to bed, sleep)
and thus seven Markov models corresponding to well identiﬁed circadian rhythms are
used. Each model is represented by a graph of the transitions in between the different
activities that occurs in each period (FSM). The transitions are controlled by their
probabilities. This model is heavily based on prior knowledge as the probabilities of
transitions are selected by users, as well as the limits of the seven periods of the day.
The next step of the simulator is devoted to translate activities in a sequence of actions.
In this work it is assumed that each activity is translated always by the same sequence
of actions and the only free parameter in this step is the duration of the speciﬁc action.
Finally, as described in the next subsection, the posture simulator models each action as
a sequence of the postures (taking into account the only four postures previously
mentioned).

Calibrated approach for long-term posture simulator. Starting from the
sequence of actions provided by the ADL simulator, the posture sequence is generated
by using a calibrated approach based on real observations conducted with real detectors
(i.e., TOF, UWB, ACC). Such calibration consists in modelling errors introduced by
each speciﬁc detector, starting from simulated ground-truth sequences. The Model
Error Modelling (MEM) method [12] together with the Expectation-Maximization
(EM) algorithm [13] are used to model detection errors. Furthermore, the parameters of
the simulated detectors are obtained by minimizing a cost function based on the Pre-
diction Error Method (PEM) [14].
2.3
Reasoning Layer
Given long-term posture sequences referred to the different sensing approaches, the
platform includes a feature extraction procedure aimed to identify the starting point of
sleep periods and their durations for each day. At this purpose, the most efﬁcient
solution is to recognize human actions from patterns of posture sequences, and more
speciﬁcally to extract starting points of the actions: “going to bed”, “sleep in bed” and
“wake up”. The approach implemented in this work allows ADLs recognition using the
technique described below. Basically, human actions are recognized by considering
successive postures over time periods. A transition action occurs when the person
changes the current action to another action. Thus, a transition action might include
several transition postures. Transition actions are merged together to form single atomic
actions and global events are recognized by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks
(DBNs) speciﬁcally designed for indoor application scenario, following an approach
similar to Park and Kautz [15]. Designed DBNs have a hierarchical structure with three
node layers: activity, interaction and sensor. The activity layer stays on top of hierarchy
and includes hidden nodes to model high-level activities (i.e. ADLs, behaviours, etc.).

Multi-sensor Platform for Detection of Anomalies …
281

The interaction layer is a hidden layer as well and it is devoted to model the states of
evidence for interactions inside the home (i.e. appliances, furniture, locations, etc.). The
detector layer, at the bottom of hierarchy, gathers data from detector sensors (postures).
Each DBN is hence decomposed in multiple Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
including interaction and sensor layers, and trained on the basis of the Viterbi algorithm
[16]. In this way, the detection of sleep start time can be derived from the recognition of
the action “going to bed”, and the duration of sleep can be obtained evaluating the
difference between “wake up” time and “sleep in bed” time.
The extracted features (start time of sleep and relative duration) are used for the
detection of sleep periods and also to estimate human sleep trends evaluating their
mapping into the two-dimensional space in which the x-axis indicate the start time of
sleep and the y-axis its duration (expressed in hours and minutes). This step is explored
with a reinforcement learning procedure; in particular, using an incremental clustering
technique [17], the last step of the platform provides an unsupervised approach for
real-time discovery of changes in a sleep patterns with respect to an initial pattern
assumed as reference, namely Reference Sleep Pattern (RSP). This is achieved by
incrementally clustering incoming features (extracted from the current day whose
postures are simulated) in the aforementioned feature space. When a new cluster
appears, a change in the sleep pattern is detected (and thus classiﬁed as normal or
anomalous) if the features belonging to the new cluster are extracted from N consec-
utive days (not necessary adjacent), with N set according to physician’s indications.

Experimental Results
The robustness of the feature extraction step has been evaluated on a series of
experiments in which synthetic data obtained after calibrated simulation of real data
generated by TOF sensor were affected by different percentages of errors related to:
(1) sensor noise and (2) fault situation which can occur in real contexts (e.g. wearable
sensor not worn, vision sensor turned off or occluded, resulting in postures not
available during a time period). The purpose to simulate situations close to reality has
been reached by modeling the noise with two kinds of components: bias noise (uniform
distribution) and posture transition noise (Gaussian distribution). Performances have
been evaluated in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by measuring the misalign-
ment between ground-truth sleep phases and detected ones, and also in terms of Mean
Relative Error (MRE) related to the percentage of undetected sleep phases. The pre-
vious error measures are estimated through 13 synthetic datasets constituted by dif-
ferent time periods, and characterized by an average length of sleep pattern equal to
8 h. The duration of sleep is randomly perturbed by variance values between 0.5 and
1.5 h. The number of simulated days for each experiment, the percentage of errors and
relative performances are reported in Table 3.
The results obtained reveal that a total noise level of about 60% can affect the
accuracy of the detected sleep phases in terms of temporal misalignment compared
with the ground-truth. Moreover, if a fault situation is added to the noise the percentage
of undetected sleep phases grows and this happens more if the fault situation occurs
during the sleep periods.

For the validation of the incremental clustering step, experiments that simulate
different time periods have been carried out reproducing postural time series according
to posture classiﬁcation performance. Three time intervals (60, 120 and 180 days) have
been taken into account as reference period M, followed by periods within which a
change in the CR pattern was simulated (labelled with N). In Table 4, the detection rate
of trend changes, at varying of both M and N, is reported for each detector. It is
important to note that at the increasing of M, the incremental clustering achieves good
performance if changes in CR pattern persist for a time period N. However, it is
important to note that an acceptable detection rate (at least of 80%) is obtained for
period N (in days) closely related to each detector: a greater amount of days N is
required at the increasing of M.

Discussion and Conclusion
From the analysis of the obtained results, it is evident the platform ability in identiﬁ-
cation of changes in human sleep patterns with high accuracy. However, the perfor-
mances are strictly related to the sensing technology involved; in fact, at varying of the
detector, a different number of days N is required to reach a satisfactory detection rate.
For example, if we consider a reference period of length M = 120 days, a detection rate
of about 80% is reached within N = 21 days (TOF), N = 35 days (ACC), N = 42 days
(UWB). The platform has been validated by using posture sequences simulated in a
calibrated way (with calibration error less than 5%) and referring to common ADLs
carried out by older people in their home environment. Furthermore, the solution was
tested considering reference periods M very different in order to taking into account
any deviations with respect to standard execution of ADLs.
This leads up to believe that the performances that can be reached using real
monitoring systems should be included between M = 60 and M = 180, with N cor-
responding to the sensing technology used. From the usability perspective, the platform
is consistent with the independent living context; in fact the detection of changes in
sleep patterns can be automatically obtained allowing ofﬂine analysis by a
caregiver/doctor for subsequent clinical evaluations. Finally, it is important to stress the
versatility of the platform which can potentially operate with any kind of detector able
to provide postural information.

Abstract. This work aims at determining if bioimpedance measurements are
able to provide information about the inﬂammatory state of the tissues; if the
presence of an inﬂamed tissue can be located by means of bioimpedance
measure, it would be possible to focus a potential treatment in this site. Different
numerical 3D models have been realized to simulate the measurement condi-
tions present in the event of inﬂamed gingiva around a dental implant. A pre-
molar has been represented and different inﬂammation volumes have been
considered; both geometric and electrical properties have been taken from the
literature. In addition, some preliminary measurements have been conducted in
three patients with dental implants in different conditions: healthy tissues,
inﬂammation and peri-implantitis. The percentage difference of impedance (ΔZ)
between healthy and inﬂamed tissues has been considered. In addition, also
three numerical models of healthy teeth have been realized (i.e. incisor, canine
and premolar roots), in order to evaluate the normal range of teeth bioimpedance
values. The results obtained from the numerical simulations show ΔZ values of
6–20% for the dental implant, depending on the inﬂamed volume. The bioim-
pedance values experimentally measured are in agreement with the ones
obtained from the simulations and ΔZ values are also more marked (34% for
inﬂammation, 55% for peri-implantitis), suggesting that in real inﬂamed tissues
not only electrical properties but also dimensions are different with respect to the
normal case. As regards the healthy teeth, the modulus of the measured impe-
dance is higher than that of the implant; this was predictable and is due to the
presence of bone instead of the implant. In conclusion, it is possible to state that
bioimpedance measurements allow the clinician to detect inﬂamed tissues, so
that the therapy can be focused on the impaired zone, limiting the inﬂuence in
the surrounding healthy tissues and personalizing the therapy according to the
inﬂammation severity.

Introduction
Biologic tissues are characterized by speciﬁc electrical properties (i.e. electrical con-
ductivity
and
magnetic
permittivity)
[1–3],
which
vary
together
with
their
physiological/pathological conditions, such as inﬂammation [4]. Bioimpedance mea-
surements are widely applied for the monitoring of remodeling and changes in the
organism, both in normal and in pathological conditions [5]. Its wide application is due
to its minimal invasivity and to the ease to use of the required instrumentation [6].
Bioimpedance measurements could be used with diagnostic aims, since inﬂammation
determines an increase of electric conductivity with respect to normal values, due to the
presence of liquids (hyperemia and inﬁltration of the adjacent tissues are typical of the
inﬂammatory process) [4]. So, using the corresponding healthy tissue as the reference,
it is possible to diagnose an inﬂamed site; for example, in a study made on a mammary
gland [4], it is reported that the impedance value of the affected tissue is 2–3 fold lower
than that of the contralateral one. In dentistry, oral inﬂammations are very frequent [7]
and can have serious consequences (peri-implantitis is the main cause of implant failure
[8] and is characterized by bacterial infection, peri-implant bone loss and inﬂammation,
as illustrated in Fig. 1).
So, bioimpedancemetry could be used as a mean to locate the inﬂamed area of a
periodontal tissue, like the oral mucosa. These measurements would allow personalized
therapies possible, according to the position and the severity of the detected inﬂam-
mation, since the current densities and pathways are strongly inﬂuenced by the elec-
trical properties of the tissue [9]. In this way, the therapy could be focused on the
impaired area, minimizing the collateral/undesired effects on the surrounding tissues.
Moreover, bioimpedance measurements would allow to follow the inﬂammation
course, since the measured value is linked to the inﬂammation severity. In this paper,
the authors want to show the bioimpedance measurement system by means of
Fig. 1. Scheme of the implant screwed in the jaw bone and enlargement of the portion of the

numerical 3D models built in COMSOL [10], used to investigate the sensitivity of the
technique for different inﬂamed volumes. After having demonstrated the feasibility of
this approach, bioimpedance measurements on patients were conducted in different
clinical cases: healthy tissues, inﬂammation and peri-implantitis. Both in simulation
and experimentally, the impedance measurements have been done by applying a
voltage stimulus at 300 kHz, both to avoid Faraday effect [11] and to be in line with the
typical frequency range used for bioimpedance measurements [4, 6].

Materials and Methods
At ﬁrst, a numerical analysis of the bioimpedance measurement by means of 3D Finite
Element Method (FEM) was conducted. The model (reported in Fig. 2) consists in a
ﬁrst premolar tooth root with a dental implant surrounded by a portion of inﬂamed
tissue; geometric and electrical properties were taken from the literature [1–3, 12, 13],
paying particular attention to the inﬂamed tissue [4], whose conductivity was con-
sidered 2 folds higher than that of the corresponding healthy tissue. The relative
permittivity of the inﬂamed gingiva was instead considered equal to the healthy gingiva
one. All the electrical properties of the simulated biological tissues are reported in
Table 1. For the sake of simplicity, changes in geometric dimensions of the inﬂamed
tissue was not considered, even if the inﬂammatory process is actually characterized by
swollen tissue, causing a further decrease in the measured impedance. So, it can be
assumed that the analyzed structure is the worst case situation in the detection of
inﬂammations by means of bioimpedancemetry.
In order to simulate impedance measurements, an AC generator was connected
between the active and the passive electrodes; the former is the AC generator terminal
(connected to the implant, realized in titanium), while the latter is a metallic square

surface of about 4 mm2 adhering to the gingiva and ﬁxed at 0 V potential (ground). In
this way, the authors wanted to verify the possibility of distinguishing between healthy
and inﬂamed tissues, by means of two different conﬁgurations: passive electrode was
ﬁrst put in contact with healthy gingiva to measure healthy side, then with inﬂamed
gingiva to measure the inﬂamed side and so to do the comparison. Different inﬂamed
tissue volumes were considered, that is 2, 5 and 13 mm3. Simulations of bioimpedance
measurement were made also on different healthy teeth roots (premolar, canine and
incisor, as shown in Fig. 3), in order to evaluate a normal bioimpedance range.
After having numerically veriﬁed the possibility to discriminate between inﬂamed
and healthy periodontal tissues by means of bioimpedancemetry, a few experimental
measures were conducted on patients with dental implants, in case of healthy and
inﬂamed tissue, as well as in a case of peri-implantitis. An LCR bridge meter was used
(HP LCR Precision Meter 4285A [14]), connected by means of an opposite insulation
transformer and equipped with proper electrodes, allowing an adequate electric contact.
Typical accuracy of a commercial RLC meter is lower than 1%, so it is suitable for the
discrimination between healthy and inﬂamed tissues (Fig. 4).

Results
3.1
Numerical Simulation
After running the simulations, the impedance was evaluated in its absolute, real and
imaginary values. Due to biological tissues electrical properties, the contribution of the
imaginary part to the impedance values is always negligible and therefore the modulus
reported is mainly given by the resistance component. In dental implant model, ΔZ
value was computed to make a comparison between healthy and inﬂamed sides.
3.1.1
Dental Implant Model
As regards numerical simulations, healthy and inﬂamed tissues impedances were
compared and differences in the range of 620% were calculated, depending on the
considered inﬂamed volume (Table 2).

Healthy Teeth Models
As regards the healthy teeth roots models, impedance values obtained are reported in
Fig. 5. It is possible to observe that the real part is the predominant one, so the major
contribute to the impedance modulus is due to that and the imaginary part is negligible.
3.2
Experimental Measurements
Experimental measurements were repeated four times for each considered tooth, so to
evaluate the repeatability of the measurement. An equivalent circuit was considered,
that is a series between resistance and capacitance. The results are reported in Table 3,
whose last column is related to the mean value (m) and the standard deviation (r) of
the impedance moduli obtained from the four measurements done on each clinical case.

The impedance modulus (reported as mean ± standard deviation) was equal to
(369 ± 10) Ω on the implant with peri-implantitis, to (549 ± 23) Ω on the implant
surrounded by inﬂamed tissue and to (829 ± 43) Ω on the implant surrounded by
healthy tissue. So, impedance values are higher in the implant surrounded by healthy
tissues; the presence of liquids (due to hyperemia and inﬁltration) reduces the impe-
dance value in the inﬂammation case (ΔZ = 34%) and, even more, in the
peri-implantitis case (ΔZ = 55%).

Discussion and Conclusions
A numerical study to investigate the feasibility of a bioimpedancemetry-based instru-
ment to detect inﬂamed tissues for periodontal applications has been carried out, in case
of dental implants (often linked to peri-implantitis phenomena). The diagnosis of the
inﬂammation is based on the comparison between healthy and sick tissues. Numerical
results show that the change in impedance values due to the inﬂammatory process is
sufﬁciently pronounced (i.e. 6–20%, depending on the inﬂamed volume) to discrimi-
nate between healthy and inﬂamed tissues; as predictable, greater the inﬂamed volume,
higher the percentage difference and so easier the detection of the inﬂamed area. Once
demonstrated the feasibility of the bioimpedancemetric method, a few experimental
measures on patients have been conducted in case of dental implants surrounded by
healthy or inﬂamed tissues or with peri-implantitis phenomena. Also experimental
results show a signiﬁcant change in pathological condition with respect to normality
(ΔZ of 34% in case of inﬂammation and of 55% in case of peri-implantitis). As a
consequence, it is possible to state that a bioimpedance measuring system integrated in
a therapeutic device could allow the clinician to locate the impaired area and to
evaluate the severity of the inﬂammation, thus adjusting the therapeutic dose. More-
over, bioimpedancemetry would permit the monitoring of the pathology course. This
monitoring system could be applied not only when an implant is present, but also with
natural teeth. So, numerical 3D models of canine, incisor and premolar teeth roots have
been realized and the impedance values have been evaluated. They are greater than
those related to dental implants, because in natural teeth there is more bone, which is a
material with a greater resistivity than the implant (i.e. bone is less conductive, since
the implant is a metal, that is the conductor par excellence). In the future, it would be
interesting to do experimental measurements of bioimpedance in natural teeth, com-
paring healthy tissues with inﬂamed ones; this could ﬁnd a consistent application in
case of periodontitis, that is an inﬂammatory disease affecting the tissues surrounding
tooth. This approach could be applied not only to locate inﬂammations in mouth
environment, but also in other parts of our body, providing an easy, low-cost and
non-invasive diagnostic method.

Abstract. Recently, the interest in the development of new pervasive or mobile
implementations of air quality multisensor devices has signiﬁcantly grown. New
application opportunities appeared together with new challenges due to limita-
tions in dealing with rapid pollutants concentrations transients both for static and
mobile deployments. Sensors dynamic is one of the primary factor in limiting
the capability of the device of estimating true concentration when it is rapidly
changing. Researchers have proposed several approaches to these issues but
none have been tested in real conditions. Furthermore, no performance com-
parison is currently available. In this contribution, we propose and compare
different approaches to the calibration problem of novel fast air quality multi-
sensing devices, using two datasets recorded in ﬁeld. Machine learning archi-
tectures have been designed, optimized and tested in order to tackle the cross
sensitivities issues and sensors inherent dynamic limitations to perform accurate
prediction and uncertainty estimation. Comparison results shows the advantage
of dynamic non linear architectures versus static linear ones with support vector
regressors scoring best results.

Introduction
In 2008, EU Air quality Directive called for the integration of the sparse network of
conventional air quality monitoring systems via the so called indicative measurements
devices [1]. It also deﬁned Data Quality Objective (DQO) that systems should achieve
in order to produce usable measurements. In particular, the DQO were expressed in
terms of extended uncertainty.
Solid state based chemical multisensor devices are most appealing candidates for
this role for their low cost and low dimensional impacts that enable pervasive or mobile
deployments. Recently, they have been a relevant factor in the diffusion of the citizen
science concept aiming to personal pollutant exposure assessment while on the move
[2, 3]. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the promising performance expressed in

laboratory settings, solid state sensors are known to consistently underperform when
deployed in real world conditions [4], with performance that are far from being
acceptable from the DQO point of view. However, researchers that have attempted to
implement multivariate calibration scheme reported interesting results exploiting all the
response signals of the sensor array to overcome cross-sensitivities, sensitivities and, to
a minor extent, stability issues.
Researchers are well aware of the impacts of chemical sensors slow response
dynamic to their capability to follow rapid pollutant transients. These impacts are
considered particularly relevant for robotic, mobile or even pervasive deployments
where chemical sensors are expected to face rapid transients due to the crossing of
chemical plumes. They have tried to implements multiple strategies that, tested in lab
environments, have suggested the possibility to achieve at least a partial solution to the
involved issue [5]. Esposito et al. [6] have recently tested one of these methodologies
by using on ﬁeld recorded measurements. To the best of our knowledge these proposals
have never been compared and a little is known on their generalization capabilities
when facing to different conditions. In this work we attempt to give a ﬁrst response to
these needs by comparing several recently proposed approaches to the dynamic cali-
bration of chemical sensor devices by using two different datasets with a relevant
number of samples recorded in different conditions, in different cities and with different
timeframes and sampling frequencies. In the following, we brieﬂy summarize relevant
aspects of calibration techniques and the testing datasets as well as the proposed
comparison methodology. Results are then commented in the last sections. To skate
over the nonetheless interesting performance ranking results, they will conﬁrm the need
for taking into account the dynamic content of the sensor response in order to obtain a
fast response from the raw sensor signals and hence overcome dynamic issues.
2
Methods
A set of machine learning (ML) approaches to sensor array calibration have been
selected by the available literature and compared for performance results on two
datasets. The latter are built up by data collected on the ﬁeld and include the response
of a sensors array and the corresponding ground truth for pollutant concentrations
obtained by co-located conventional analyzers. Datasets have been temporally seg-
mented in three non-overlapping subsets for training, validation and test purposes. The
order of sampling have been preserved in order to let the technique to exploit infor-
mation on sensors and process dynamic.
Whenever possible, each ML technique have been developed considering both its
static, basic, structure and its dynamic version as capable of taking into account the
dynamic features of the considered problem.
Comparison have been carried out with the aim of fairly compare performances of
the proposed machine learning approaches. According to common practice, model
design and optimization have been carried out by selecting best performing hyperpa-
rameters combination within a speciﬁc subspace for each of the different experimental
conditions. Best hyperparameters combination have been selected by a brute force
search conducted on a set of combination obtained by subsampling the different

hyperparameter spaces. Practically, each combination was associated to a speciﬁc
model and performance have been evaluated with the use of a separated validation set.
According to this procedure the best performing hyperparameter combination have
been used in order to test the speciﬁed model on the devised test set. Obtained per-
formances have been then compared in the results section. It is noteworthy to highlight
that each performance evaluation both occurring on the validation set for model design
or on the test set, has been carried out by averaging the results obtained during multiple
runs of the training procedure. For ANN and RC architecture, for example, the results
are in fact dependant from the outcomes of their random initialization procedure.
2.1
Machine Learning Approaches
The selection of tested machine learning approaches include Artiﬁcial Neural Network
(ANN), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Reservoir Computing (RC), Gaussian
Processes and the base Multilinear Regressor Approach (see Refs. [5–7]).
ANNs have become a de facto standard for non linear multivariate regression in
multiple applied machine learning ﬁelds. Their basic structure includes three layers
(input, hidden and output) of computing nodes. Weighted connections conveys pro-
cessed input signals to inner layers where non linear evaluation of sigmoidal functions
take places. Eventually, processed signals are evaluated by a linear output layer to
estimate the value of the output (in our case being the pollutant concentration). Weights
are tuned by a training procedure aimed to reduce empirical error to a minimum. SVRs
are competing with ANN to set a new reference standard, several studies have high-
lighted its superior performances in multiple conditions [8–10]. Based on the so called
kernel trick, their structure aims to ﬁnd a subset of relevant training samples to be used
for optimal non linear signal interpolation. Optimal selection is carried out with a
regularized approach involving simultaneous evaluation of costs of empirical error and
solution complexity. RC [11] comprises several emerging architectures that have
expressed remarkable performances in selected problems when dynamic behaviour is
involved [12]. Based on the interconnection of two basic structures, namely a Reservoir
and a Readout, RC architecture embed signiﬁcant memory and computing capabilities
in an intertwined fashion. The reservoir, in particular, is built up by a set of recurrently
interconnected computing nodes (also called neurons) each of them is also connected to
both input signals and the so called Readout structure. This is generally built up by a
multilinear regression block that take as input the output of all the reservoir units, i.e.
the state of the RC network, and outputs a linear combination of them. Interestingly
enough, the reservoir units interconnection is randomly generated and does not need
tuning, practically limiting the training phase to Readout coefﬁcients tuning.
Gaussian Processes are used as supervised machine learning method for estimating
the complete posterior joint probability of a process, in signal theory sense [7]. In this
framework, they infer the sought calibration function starting with a prior distribution
over the relevant function space and using data samples and correspondent ground truth
values to reﬁne the assumptions eventually learning the target function.
ANN, GP, SVR and MLR have been tested in their static basic architecture and in
their dynamic counterpart formulation by coupling an equally spaced and long tapped

delay line to each of the relevant input signals. Different TD length have been con-
sidered for each approach. RC model, for its intrinsic dynamic nature, has been tested
in its conventional echo state network version.
As regards as hyperparameters subspace selection, the compared neural networks
(static and dynamic NN) have been designed to host 5, 10 or 15 neurons in their hidden
layer. For SVR and TD-SVR components the scanned Kernel Functions (KF) were

Datasets
As above mentioned, two datasets have been selected for the performance evaluation
representing the core focus of this contribution.
The ﬁrst Dataset here used includes data collected during the deployment of a
multisensory device called SnaQ (see Ref. [2] for a detailed description) developed by a
team led by the Center for Atmospheric Sciences (CAAS) of University of Cambridge
(UK). The multisensory device is equipped with the following sensors units:
• 2 NO2 EC sensor units (Alphasense NO2-B4);
• 1 NO Alphasense EC sensor unit (Alphasense NO-B4);
• 2 O3 Alphasense EC sensor units (Alphasense O3-B4);
• T, RH sensor units;
• Wind speed and direction unit.
The device was located in the Cambridge city centre (University of Cambridge—
Dept. of Chemistry) together with a conventional reference station operated by CAAS.
While the sampling period of the SnaQ system was set at 20 s, the reference station
provides ground truth readings of target gases at 60 s intervals. For the SnaQ sensors, a
known cross sensitivity have been reported for, respectively, O3 and NO2. Baseline and
temperature correction have been implemented on the recorded samples using the
procedure detailed in the sensors datasheet. A further preprocessing step has been
conducted to remove reference station calibration periods during the night. The dataset
encompasses ﬁve weeks of continuous measurements with the ﬁrst week of mea-
surements (10 k samples) set apart as a training set for statistical machine learning
tools. The remaining four weeks of data have been used for validation (10 k samples)
and testing purposes (30 k samples). This dataset has been selected for the relatively

fast sampling period that has been adopted during the recordings of the sensor
responses reasonably embedding information on the dynamic behaviour of the sensors
when exposed to rapid transients.
The second dataset is focused on the deploying of a multi-sensor device developed
by Pirelli Labs for the use in urban pollution monitoring scenarios [12]. In particular,
the device was designed as a low-cost, compact, versatile and reliable tool to support
the city air quality monitoring network. The device was characterized by a three-stage
design (sensor array, data processing unit, communication unit). The device was built
up by a 31 cm  26 cm  12 cm metallic case hosting the power management unit,
signal conditioning and acquisition electronics, a microcontroller board hosting a
microprocessor eventually capable to run simple sensor fusion algorithms, a GSM
(Global System for Mobile Communications) data transmission unit and of course a
sensor array subsystem. Total weight was 2.5 kg. The microcontroller board took care
of ﬁrst-stage data processing operations, storing up to 72 h measurements at an 8 s
sample rate and controlled the communication unit in order to transfer processed data
(8, 15 or 60 min mean sampled values) to data sinks. The dataset collects data sampled
over a whole year by a multi-sensor device equipped with ﬁve metal oxide chemore-
sistive sensors (CO, NOx, O3, NMHC, NO2; hourly averages recorded) plus com-
mercial temperature and humidity sensors. The device has been co-located with a ﬁxed
conventional monitoring station equipped with spectrometer analysers. The conven-
tional ﬁxed station provided reference concentration estimation for ﬁve different
atmospheric pollutants, i.e. CO (mg/m3), non-metanic hydrocarbons (NMHC) (lg/m3),
C6H6 (lg/m3), NOx (ppb), NO2 (lg/m3). The dataset is freely available within the UCI
dataset repository [13]. The dataset have been partitioned in a training set encom-
passing 3 months out of 12 of measurements and a validation set encompassing the
successive 3 months. The remaining 6 months have been used for testing purposes
reﬂecting the scheme chosen for performance evaluation in this work.
It is worth to note that this dataset is not thought to embed signiﬁcant information
about sensors dynamic behaviour because all dynamic information is obviously lost
after hourly averaging procedure. As such dynamic machine learning components, can
only exploit the fraction of process dynamic related information captured by the
available sensor responses history.

Results
The brute force best performing hyper parameter search procedure have been con-
ducted using training and validation sets as above mentioned, producing an hyperpa-
rameters values set for each tapped delay line length and ML approach.
For each different tapped delay length, corresponding best performing models have
then been used in order to estimate the pollutant concentrations over the dedicated test
set sample (see Table 1 for selected values). The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), that
retains the same unit of measure as estimated concentrations (ppb for the ﬁrst dataset,
mg/m3 for the second), has been used as primary performance estimator. Table 2
summarize the obtained results.

As we expected, conﬁrming lab based evidences, for each different main archi-
tecture (NN, SVR, MLR, GPR) the use of a tapped delay line making use of past sensor
response samples signiﬁcantly ameliorated the performance of the corresponding static
version in the ﬁrst dataset. Concerning the second dataset, interestingly enough, only a
fraction of the tested architectures (NN, SVR) seems to be able to exploit process
dynamic related information content embedded in the tapped delay line observations.
SVR and ANN expressed a performance advantage with respect to the rest of the
proposed architectures over both the dataset.
RC conﬁrms its interesting performances by being able to compete, scoring very
similar values, with classic NN while being outcompeted by SVR. In the second
dataset, its performances are inferior to SVR and NN but it nonetheless outcompeted
GPR and the basic MLR approach. However, Tapped delay line equipped NNs seems
capable to express same or better performances in a more concise and elegant fashion,
embedding knowledge in less computational units and weights. On the other hand the
training of a fully connected NNs is more computationally intensive than what is
needed to train the linear readout of the proposed Echo State Network. It is worth to
note anyway that NN, GP and RC results are expressed in terms of average perfor-
mances over 30 repetitions of the training-test procedure due to the stochastic nature of
their initialization/training procedures. In facts, when applicable, the standard deviation
of the MAE results have been reported in table in brackets.

could be used for the design of real world operating systems. The overall results

Abstract. Waste water management process has a signiﬁcant role in guarantee
sea and surface water bodies water quality with direct impact on tourism based
economy and public health. Protection of this critical infrastructure form illicit
discharges is hence paramount for the whole society. Here, We propose a
pervasive monitoring centered approach to the protection of wastewater man-
agement plant. An hybrid sensor network is actually deployed along the
wastewater network including several different transducers. Incepted data are
harmonized and processed with an integrated SWMM model and machine
learning based approach in order to forecast water qualitative and quantitative
aspects, detect and localize anomalies. An advanced WEBGIS-SOS based
interface conveys relevant information to the management entity allowing it to
take appropriate actions in a timely way, reducing and mitigating the impacts of
illicit discharges.

Introduction
Wastewater contains a number of pollutants and contaminants, including plant nutri-
ents, heavy metals, organic pollutants and other kinds of microorganism (viruses,
bacteria, protozoa). All of these can cause health and environmental problems and can
have economic and ﬁnancial impacts, when improperly treated or untreated wastewater
is released into the environment [1]. Hence, Waste water collection and management
process has a signiﬁcant role in protect tourism based economies and public health.
Discharges of toxic substances that reach the waste water management plants may
adversely affect the plants themselves, causing the release into the environment of
pollutants at illegal and harmful concentrations. Regulatory agencies established in
Italy a direct penal responsibility of waste water management company for adverse
impact on environment due to management plant malfunction. As such, it is paramount
for the company to monitor the waste water network so to detect and predict dangerous

and anomalous inputs to the puriﬁcation plant. Until very recently and, in practice still
currently, waste water pollution continuous monitoring is severely affected by several
costs and technological issues. Consequently, the information about sewage network
environment and receiving surface water bodies is limited, lacking consistence and
completeness [2]. In their work, Métadier and Bertrand-Krajewski, among the ﬁrsts,
proposed a continuous monitoring approach to the evaluation of pollution levels in a
stormwater network by using turbidity measurement at catchment outlet. Their work
revealed the signiﬁcant time variability and complexities of interactions that can be
found in real world scenarios highlighting the limitations of conventional approaches.
However their work focused on single point of measurements obtaining limited
information on the pollutant status along the network. Several works have addressed
drinking water infrastructure monitoring and protection with a pervasive approach, i.e.
using a sensor network for early detection of signiﬁcant events [3] or source local-
ization. However, only a few works have attempted to test these methodologies on real
world stormwater or combined sewage [4, 5], due to the harsh operating conditions and
characteristics of wastewater. Summarizing, up to now, monitoring strategies based on
routine analytical assessments do not allow to forecast or prevent or mitigate the effect
of illicit discharge, because water quality assessment occurs sparsely in space and time.
In order to overcome these limitations, we need a completely new paradigm for this
critical infrastructure protection that could leverage the opportunities of the integrated
use of online continuous and pervasive sensor readings and forecasting models. To this
purpose, the SIMONA Project investigates, develops and test new strategies for waste
water management plant protection. Funded by Regional Operative Program of
Campania (Italy), it involved actual stakeholders and research agencies. It aims to
tackle the problem with an innovative and practical approach including on-ﬁeld trials
for testing the developed methodologies. In this work we present the concept and
design of the proposed integrated system and the early results of its deployment along
the Massa Lubrense waste water network.

The Proposed Methodology
In order to avoid unnecessary latencies and delays, and to detect events timely and
mitigate impacts, SIMONA proposes a simple data assimilation scheme, consisting of
several components interacting in a predetermined scheme. At the core of the archi-
tecture ensuring the critical roles lies a pervasive intelligent sensing network,
responsible for timely measurements of relevant variables and early warning via on
board Anomaly Detection algorithm and forecasting and inverse models, responsible
for diffuse assessment, water quality forecasting, backtracking of illicit emissions.
The SIMONA ICT service architecture ensure the inception and storage of incoming
data as well as the orchestration of execution of models and data processing algorithm.
A separated HCI section provide for GIS data visualization functionalities of fore-
casting modeling results.

2.1
Sensor Network
The SIMONA sensor network is based on heterogeneous model including several
different multisensor devices ensuring monitoring different variables with different
accuracies. In particular commercial contact multisensor devices and prototypal sensors
developed by ENEA cooperate to near real time assessment of the relevant variables.
The basic principle is to deploy a limited number of commercial multisensor device
providing high accuracy measurements in focal nodes of the wastewater network
integrating their data with a diffuse network of low cost, low maintenance requirements
prototypal nodes to reduce total costs of ownership of real world scenario deployments.
S::CAN™commercial multisensor devices have been selected for their reliability by
design concept being mostly based on optical transducers but in principle the ICT
service infrastructure would be able to integrate different vendors systems. The chosen
(s::can™) systems integrate different electrochemical and spectrometric transducers,
operating at powerline equipped nodes of the collecting networks [6]. In particular they
are able to capture and transmit near real time information (Ts = 1 min) on Chemical
Oxygen Demand (COD), Ammonia, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Water level, pH
and Temperature by relying on cell phone infrastructure (see Table 1). To compliment
commercial sensors capabilities, Non-contact multisensors device have been designed
to record relevant proxies of water pollution levels such as NH3 and H2S off gas,
remote water temperature, water level. The aggregate sensed data vector is used to
evaluate an overall status that, processed by an onboard or remote anomaly detection
algorithm, may detect anomalous conditions that can indicate high pollution events.
These detection events may be used to rise warning conditions and trigger enhanced
monitoring actions. Their low cost enable, at least in principle, the diffuse deployments
of multiple instance of such multisensor device providing a pervasive network of water
quality assessment sentinels. Furthermore, special very low power and low mainte-
nance nodes have been deployed for long term unattended detection of wastewater ﬂow
in overﬂows sections of the network that are only used in case of heavy rains. The
presence of water in those sections may indicate transport issues like clogging. Both the
systems relies on STMicroelectronics Nucleo boards embedding ad hoc developed
software and GSM connectivity board to capture, locally process, store and transmit
sensor data. Speciﬁcally, their duty cycle foresee to send SMS embedded data in case
of alert for immediate reaction plus a combo SMS conveying hourly averaged data at a
24 h rate. A further sensor system based on IR and UV reﬂectance sensing, developed
by Water Research Council (UK) and aimed to COD and TSS non-contact estimation,
is included in the multisensor set (see ref. [7]).
2.2
Anomaly Detection Algorithm
In order to enable the fast identiﬁcation of local anomalies caused by illegal drainages
or faults on the sensor network, we employ an immune based algorithm for the
anomaly detection [8]. If on board encoded, this enable sensors to autonomously send

alerts. Biomimetically, these algorithms typically operates using two principal entities,
i.e. antibodies and antigens. Particularly, in the initial boot phase (a ﬁxed one week
long time window) each sensor measurement is stored in an antibodies set called
dynamic B-cells (DBs) reservoir. Each subsequent incoming samples is indicated
instead as antigen. The DBs reservoir acts as the “normal” prototypes set, actually
representing the algorithm internal knowledge. Each DBs can be described, by means
its features vector, as a point in the multivariate space, having an own inﬂuence sphere,
a stimulation level s and a speciﬁc age a. The radius c  r2 of its inﬂuence sphere
represents the variance of the Gaussian distribution prototyped by each DB. The
algorithm, dynamically adapts each DB radius size on the strength of the novel
incoming ﬁeld recorded sensor readings. This allows for the efﬁcient computing of the
actual feature space coverage of an antibody, simultaneously adapting it to short term
evolutions. The dynamic antibodies characterization is completed with a stimulation
and age parameters. Speciﬁcally, the stimulation level allows to model, over time, the
DB cell local representativeness with regards to the set of incoming sensor readings.
Large stimulation levels actively slow down the ageing process of a DB cell rejuve-
nating its age parameter. The DBs characterization by these parameters guarantees at all
times an accurate ad faithful representation of the system evolution. In order to obtain a
scalable model, DBs, competing each other for the memory resources, are partitioned in
clusters by means of a density based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN). In this way, the
problem of the anomalies recognition involves only a set of cluster representative
instances (cluster centroids) and not all DBs with considerable computational advan-
tages that enable on board integration. On the basis of the DB based representation,
antigens are hence classiﬁed as “normal” or otherwise “anomalous” if their feature
vector signiﬁcantly differs from the current normality pattern described by closest
hourly DBs (Fig. 1).

custom components on the commercial sensor systems while a dedicated server based
on Raspberry PI + GSM shield provide the receiving end for the prototypal systems.
Incoming SMS are parsed to build the appropriate JSON document to be stored in the
database. JSON document, in turn, are sent to a Node.js based software component
which take the role of MONGODB input interface. The next node in the architecture,
the so called orchestrator, take the role of orchestrating the data processing ﬂow

between the primary storage system and the HCI. Data are extracted from the primary
storage and processed with a dedicated set of algorithms to extract relevant semantic
content. Here, we focus on forecasting models and rule based alerting systems. A rule
based system based on Drools [9] open source software has been conﬁgured to host
simple rules devised to detect rule based anomalies. Relevant examples includes the
detection of threshold and location based alerts plus unexpected water presence. In the
ﬁrst case an alert is triggered when a particular threshold levels casted on a single or a
set of variables is reached in a particular location of the deployment. In the second case
an alert is triggered when water presence is detected and transmitted by a water
presence sensor and no rain have been recorded by the rain gauges sensors. Model
description is detailed in the following subchapter.
2.3.1
Forecasting and Inverse Model
One of the primary role of focal nodes data is to help calibrating SWMM [10] based
water transport models so to achieve accurate prediction of network status in the next
hours. By using networked sensors recorded values as an input, the calibrated SWMM
model will be able to predict the arrival of heavily polluted water volumes at the plant.
In this case, the plant manager could be warned to take appropriate action so to reduce
the possibility of harming the bacterial population of the wastewater reactor. In this
context we also developed and deployed a methodology for identify source of con-
tamination events in a real SS. This methodology that allow the ﬁnding of the input
location of contamination is formulated as an optimization problem. For its solution
three
components
are
required:
sensor
measurements
along
the
system;
an
hydraulic/water quality model and an optimization problem solver. The USEPA’s
SWMM model [11] is used to perform the hydraulic and water quality simulations,
whereas the genetic algorithm library GALib [12] is used to solve the optimization
problem. Computational efforts represents the primary limiting factor for applying this
methodology to real sewer systems. Actually, they signiﬁcantly increase with network
size and complexity [13]. This drawback is overcomed with a pre-screening procedure
that reduces the number of nodes before the optimization routine. First step of this
procedure deﬁnes the set of candidate nodes through the pollution matrix [14]. This
matrix is an N  N matrix of 0–1 coefﬁcients, where N is the number of nodes and “1”
and “0” correspond to contaminated and non-contaminated nodes, respectively. The ith
row lists all contaminated nodes due to an accidental pollution in node i. The jth
column lists all polluting nodes (sources of pollution) that can contaminate node j. In
the second step the unnecessary elements of the network are cut. The ﬂow coming from
the cut parts is added to the next node of the remaining scheme, assigning a new
average inﬂow and a new time pattern. The inﬂow is estimated from the last link of the
cut portion, while the time pattern is estimated from the downstream link next to the
node, where the value has to be assigned. After the pre-screening procedure, the
optimization problem is formulated, minimizing a dimensionless objective function, F,
deﬁned as the normalized square difference between simulated and the measured
contaminant concentration values:

where i = sensor index; t = time step; Cobs it and Cit = measured and simulated con-
centration at sensor i at time step t, respectively; L = intrusion node index; C0 = release
concentration (mg/l); T0 = release starting time; D = release duration (h); t0 = time of
the ﬁrst detection of the contaminant at the sensor i; tc = ending time of simulation;
Ns = total number of sensors. The simulated concentrations are computed through a
forward quality simulation using EPA-SWMM, ﬁxing the values of the unknown source
characteristics, which are herein represented by the four decision variables: pollution
injection node, L; pollutant concentration at the source, C0; injection starting time, T0;
and injection duration, D. Then, the optimal value of the objective function F is obtained
by modifying the values of these variables. The result is obtained by a typical Genetic
Algorithm (GA) that starts with the generation of a random set of strings (population),
then the objective function score is evaluated for each string (individual). Afterwards,
the algorithm generates a new set of strings through selection, crossover and mutation.
The above steps are repeated until the selected stopping criterion is attained.
2.3.2
Human to Computer Interface
A web based geospatial HCI (Human to Computer Interface) has been developed. This
geo-console (i.e. web based map viewer) allows accessing and browsing within maps
the various continuous and networked sensors, and browsing, queering and analyzing
the observation data both in real time and at preﬁxed time intervals. The observation
data can be real measurements gathered by sensors actually installed along the
wastewater networks as well as predictive measurements returned by on line simulation
models (see previous chapter). The networked sensors can be visualized as an unique
layer or as single layer for each monitoring parameter. For the multi-sensor stations, it is
possible to visualize the real time observations of all active sensors (Fig. 3). Within
each layer, as thematic map, it is possible to visualize the state of the sensors, especially
their alert state when anomaly situations occur as well as preﬁxed threshold values are
met. By means of a toolbar, user can access two speciﬁc web-based browser applica-
tions. One application is a web SOS client, developed as a extending the open source
Sensor Web Client. It acts as an application layer to handle, via web, the rendering of
queried observations in the form of graph, time series and geographic maps. The
implementation of the described web based map viewer has been deployed by using the
framework GeoExt2 and some libraries such as OpenLayers, Sencha-ExtJS 4.2.x.
A SWE (Sensor Web Enablement) architecture has been developed integrating and
real time accessing the various networked sensors and their observations, enabling
observation data browsing, querying and analyzing capabilities within the geo-console
HCI. Essentially, it consists of the services SOS (Sensor Observation Service) by which
clients access descriptions of associated sensors and their collected observations by a
standardized web service interface. The SWE architecture has been realized by cus-
tomizing the 52°N framework, version 3.x and, speciﬁcally, by using the standards
OGC SOS 1.0 and 2.0. The deployed SOS endpoint uses a database PostgreSQL 9.3.1
with a spatial extension PostGIS 2.x to store observation values and sensor metadata.

Deployment at Massa Lubrense WWMP
After software platform setup, a multi-month pilot study have been performed by
deploying an hybrid sensor network on the wastewater network of Massa Lubrense, a
14,000 inhabitants town located near Naples, Italy on the Amalﬁtan coast. The whole
area is interested by signiﬁcant touristic activities. It is serviced by a combined sewer
system, covering an area of 0.75 km2. The scheme consists of 242 circular conduits
connecting 241 junctions, one pump, two storage units and one outfall. The deploy-
ment lasted from October 2015 until February 2016 including a stress test experiment
in which a pollutant simulant have been allegedly discharged into the sewer system.
The networked sensor system was characterized by 4 multisensors prototype located at
internodes, 4 Commercial S::CAN devices located at main facilities including pumps
and water management plant, 8 Water presence devices distributed in overﬂow loca-
tions and 1 Loadmon device at the water management plant.

Preliminary Data Analysis and Results
Preliminary results conﬁrms the harshness of the sewage environment with several
issues related with sensor operation and data transmission occurring frequently and
requiring maintenance and tuning operations. First results, in facts, indicate a relatively

stable behavior of the water quality in the network while contact sensors, with special
regard to electrochemical transducers, have been subjected to drift needing recalibra-
tion. Instead, fall of water level due to seasonal changes (population, low rainfall
levels) was unexpectedly large at one of the sites and caused the sensors to run dry
multiple times. The 3G coverage of the monitored site has also caused signiﬁcant
packet losses indicating a strong coverage as a must to ensure continue operation. First
results indicate sufﬁcient correlation among analytical control measurements and
sensor readings (see Fig. 4). Observing the same ﬁgure, it is also clear that relevant
information on water quality is embedded at relatively high frequency and cannot be
revealed by current monitoring strategies involving a limited number of analytical
measurements.
Description of correlation among different variables is also made possible as seen in
Fig. 5, where continuous monitored COD and TSS express an high correlation factor
(r = 0.9) substantially conﬁrmed by analytical control measurements.

In Fig. 6 the sensor node captures the inﬂuence on water quality of the pumps duty
cycle. As pumps onset water coming from different sewage network segments mix
together cyclically changing COD values. Again, these oscillations are likely to be lost
with conventional monitoring strategies.
Figure 7 shows the diurnal patterns of COD and TSS, for the commercial sensor
devices. Diurnal patterns help to characterize measurement site and identify high load
network segments, and can be useful in order to provide feedback on citizen’s and
company’s impact on water quality. In turn, this could improve their environmental
awareness eventually leading to behavioral changes. In particular, it is possible to note
the typical daytime peak load following by gradual descent towards the night hour
regime. At the same time it is possible to identify site CM4.1 as characterized by
minimal variance along the 24 h while CM 3.1 as characterized by stronger dynamic in
both TSS and COD measurements.
On February 19th, a stress test has been executed with the release of 300 + 300 L
of Nutrient™, an organic carbon source for nutrient supply in wastewater treatment
plants injected at two different sites:
• Punta Campanella (22  25 l in 5 min),
• Patierno (12  25 l in 3 min),
with a 6 h interval. As can be seen in Fig. 8, deployed sensors have recorded and
transmitted the simulated event propagation throughout the waste water network.

pilot tests indicate the advantage of continuous monitoring highlighting high frequency
feature that are lost with sparse spatial and temporal conventional measurement pat-
terns. Although affected by several issues due to the peculiarly harsh environment
characteristics features can be easily extracted involving site speciﬁc pollution ﬁn-
gerprints (pollutant levels and correlations), dynamic patterns (average hourly con-

Abstract. Aim of this study is to investigate innovative olfactory applications of
cognitive neuroscience in order to improve basic knowledge as well as to develop
novel devices for enhancing synaesthetic experiences through olfactory stimula-
tion. We arranged an experiment of olfactive conditioned evoked potentials by
analyzing Event Related Potential (ERP) of adult safe volunteers during the
conditioning perception of 2 odor stimuli, in an experiment of emotional face
recognition task. Speciﬁcally, it was developed a paradigm of classical condi-
tioning in which the three types of odors (pleasant, unpleasant, neuter) were
conditioned on images of neuter face expression and these results were compared
with direct results of olfactory stimulation. The main experimental evidence of our
study consists in signiﬁcant values in ERPs components in direction of a greater
amplitude and slower latency in unpleasant condition. On the basis of these results
one might assume that an unpleasant odor can modulate, in a cross modal way, the
perceptions of emotional and neutral face expressions, and it’s highlighted in an
early ERPs component (P1) in conditioning way only for neutral expressions.

Introduction
The perception of an odor is a two-step process. First, there is a physiological process,
i.e. the detection of chemical stimuli (odorous molecules) by olfactory receptors in the
olfactory epithelium. Next, there is a neurologic process; olfactory neurons transduce
receptors activation into neuronal electrical signals travelling along the olfactory nerve
to olfactory bulb and ﬁnally, they are processed by subcortical and higher cortical
areas, where odor encoding and perception occur. Because of this, olfaction is a
complex primal sense highly associated with sexual attraction, mood, detection of
danger and odors have the power to evoke distant memories and boost self-conﬁdence.

A lot of knowledge on olfaction has to be still get mainly regarding its relationship with
other sensory stimuli as audio, visual, taste stimuli [1]. Odor recognition memory is
slightly inﬂuenced by the length of retention intervals. This was observed for short
intervals (few minutes) as well as longer retention period (over a year too) [2]. Odor
detection applications are needed by human societies in various circumstances. A re-
cent study of He et al. [3] presents a novel apparatus designed to train maximum 5 mice
automatically to detect odors using a new olfactory, relative go no-go, classical con-
ditioning paradigm. The new paradigm offers the chance to measure real-time relia-
bility of individual animal’s detection behavior with changing responses.
Another approach to understanding the olfaction links to other senses is to monitor
and analyze human brain activity during odors perception. By measuring event-related
potentials (ERPs) by electroencephalography, it’s possible to measure the brain elec-
trophysiological response to a speciﬁc event, i.e. in this case the presentation of
olfactory stimuli [4, 5]. Aim of this study is investigate how the olfactory system,
which also involves and activates the subcortical areas, can modulate perception during
an emotional face recognition task, and how, through a new method of olfactory
stimulation we can also obtain a comparable trend analyzing Olfactory Event Related
Potentials (OERPs). This study allows to investigate and to implement innovative
applications of cognitive neuroscience in order to improve basic knowledge as well as
to develop novel devices for enhancing synaesthetic experiences with olfactory stim-
ulations. In order to compare two different olfactory applications, we analyzed a
paradigm of classical conditioning and an OERP task [6]. Classical conditioning is a
time-related learning process in which a neutral stimulus is associated, through repe-
ated combined presentations, to a different stimulus not related with the neutral one.
This means that, the olfactory stimulus, could be highlighted in the EEG, right through
an identiﬁcation and conditioning process related with an associated stimulus.
Moreover, in this work we proposed a contribute to the topic of olfaction explo-
ration by brain activity monitoring during odors perception, by presenting a new
measuring system of olfactory event-related potentials during olfactory stimulation.
The system allows a Virtual Olfactive Stimulation in EEG (VOS-EEG); it generated
and dispensed odorous stimuli and allows a controlled, automated and synchronized
acquisition of the EEG signal [7]. The measuring system of new conception has been
implemented through the design and implementation of an olfactometer interfaced to
an EEG instrumentation. In particular, a two channels olfactometer, interfaced to EEG,
allows the occurrence of OERP via the controlled administration of two different
chemo-olfactory stimuli to the individual under analysis EEG. We selected some
odorous substances for the deﬁnition of experiments of interest for the study of brain
activity under stimulation from pleasant/unpleasant and neutral odors. We used this
approach to study cross-modal effect of smell on perception and to investigate new
paradigms of smell administration, as well as to promote new technologies and func-
tional devices for olfactory cognition neuroscience.
In this study we obtain the same effect trend comparing a direct method with an
indirect method.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Smell Tools and Method
We arranged an experiment of olfactory conditioned evoked potentials by analyzing
visual ERP of 7 adult safe volunteers during perception of 2 odor stimuli: pleasant
(rose, 2-phenyl ethanol C2H4O2) and unpleasant (acid, Acetic Acid C8H10O). For the
odorous stimuli in the experiment, pure chemical compounds were diluted in distilled
water. A dilution ratio (1:4) was suitably considered in order to realize easily per-
ceptible, but not unpleasant, odors; the odorants and their concentration used in the test
are listed in Table 1 together with their odor sensory description. In addition, distilled
water was used a control for inducing an odorless stimulus. The odorous solutions
(5 ml) were put into 20 ml glass vials sealed with septum till the exposure time to the
volunteers.
2.2
Psychophysiological Tools and Method
(A) Emo Go-no Go task: We considered ERP components respect to neuter face. The
signal was recorded by an EEG 16 channels, Through Brain Amp device and
Brain Vision Recorder software (Brain Products). A further electrode was posi-
tioned above the right eyebrow for electro-oculogram recording. ERPs analysis
was carried out using the Brain Vision Analyzer and the time off-line analysis was
from 100 pre-stimulus to 500 ms post-stimulus with −100 ms baseline-correction.
Thereafter, trials with blinks and eye movements were rejected on the basis of
horizontal electro-oculogram with an ICA component analysis.
(B) Olfactory Event Related Potentials: through the VOS-EEG, synchronization,
along with the program of olfactory stimulation, allows us to study in detail the
OERP according to the stimulus triggers sent to an interfaced and digitized output
that comes from the system (Fig. 1). The olfactory triggers are modulated as a
function of the variables intensity and duration of stimulation.

Experiments
2.3.1
First Experiment (classical condition)
An experiment of olfactive conditioned evoked potentials was arranged by analyzing
ERPs of adult safe volunteers during perception of 3 odor stimuli (pleasant: rose odor;
unpleasant: acetic acid; neutral: water), during a face recognition task paradigm.
Speciﬁcally, we proposed a paradigm of classical conditioning in which the three types
of odors were conditioned on images of neuter face expression [8]. Aim of the
experiment was to understand how the olfactory system, which involves and activates
the limbic system, can modulate a perception on emotional face recognition.
The experimental protocol was based on a NimStim Face Stimulus Set [9], during a
learning training lasting 5 min, repeated for three times. Subsequently, the subject had
to perform an emotional Face recognition task, implemented through NimStimSet,
during a Emo No Go Paradigm Presented with E-Prime Presentation (the task had a
duration of 10 min). During the face recognition task, the subject had to press a PC
key, when he saw emotional neuter face expression in a presentation of randomized
emotional expressions (fear, neuter and happy).
The experiments have been performed with a group of 7 safe volunteers (mean age:
35; s.d: 5.3).
Visual stimuli had a dimension of 240  210 pixels, and have been displayed
centrally on a light gray background and to the same level of brightness on the
computer monitor. The task odd-ball was administered via the E-prime software 2.0.
Each trial, composed of a single type of target alternated randomly background-color,
has lasted 600s, with a stimulus duration of 2000 and 1000 ms inter-stimulus duration.

The participants were instructed to stand upright with ca 75 cm between the front edge
of the chair and the ﬂoor. The instruction was: ‘Please click a button when you see a
neuter face’.
2.3.2
Second Experiment on Olfactive Event-Related Potentials (OERP)
In this experiment we proposed the same odor stimulation (pleasant, unpleasant,
neutral) using a novel system consisting of an olfactometer interfaced to an EEG
instrumentation (Fig. 1) (pending patent n. PCT/IB2015/055575). The system allows to
measure the OERPs under olfactory stimulation in a controlled, automated mode
synchronized to the acquisition of the EEG signal.
The subjects had to perform two independent tests, in which each participant had to
discriminate: (a) pleasant odor alternated to neutral odor and (b) unpleasant odor
alternated to neutral odor. Each stimulation had a duration of 15 min.

Statistical Analysis and Main Results
EEG data processing: An artifact rejection criterion of 60 V was used at all other scalp
sites to reject trials with excessive EMG or other noise transients; sampling rate was
256 Hz. After a transformation and a re-segmentation of data with the Brain Vision
Analyzer, the artifact-free EEG tracks, were averaged in each case to extract the main
waveforms, the P1 in the time range 80–150 ms, the N170 in the time range 150–250
and P3 component in the 250–400 ms time interval, according to literature. A semi-
automatic peak detection was performed on each ERPs components.
Data analysis: We performed a General Linear Model to repeated measures to
analyze ERP component, P1, N170 and P3, with two Odor Conditions (pleasant and
unpleasant) and three Emotional Face Expressions (neuter, fear and happy) as Factors
and Amplitude and Latency as dependent variables. As main results of our study we
found signiﬁcant value in P1, and in P3 components (see Fig. 2).

In P100 we found signiﬁcant value in neutral face conditions in P8 Latency
(F = 5277; p = 0035); in PZ Amplitude (F = 6157; p = 0025); in F7 Amplitude
(F = 6784; p = 0019) and in F8 Latency (F = 5369; p = 0034).
In P300 we had signiﬁcant value only for neutral faces in C3 Latency (F = 28,339;
p = 0006) and in PZ Latency (F = 7346; p = 0005).
All the results are in direction of a greater amplitude and slower latency in Acid
Acetic Condition (Fig. 2).
The red line corresponds to the olfactory stimulus of the odorous substance S2, and
the black line corresponds to the olfactory stimuli of neutral substance S1 and S2. AS
in the case of the classical paradigm, we have the same results of the ﬁrst experiment,
ERP for unpleasant odor is less activating of the ERP for pleasant odor (Fig. 3).

Conclusion
In this work we presented the preliminary results of a study on Olfactive response and
Crossmodal perception. The study was organized in two different experiments: First
Experiment (classical condition), Second Experiment on OERPs by a novel prototype
which performs a Virtual Olfactive Stimulation interfaced to EEG (VOS-EEG).
According to the results of both experiments, we may suppose that the unpleasant odor
can modulate, in a cross modal way, the perceptions of emotional and neutral face
expressions, and it can be general in a very early component (P1) and more speciﬁc, in
conditioning way, in the attentive component (P3), only for neutral expressions. We
addressed these issues in the research ﬁeld and have ventured into the development of
Virtual Olfactive Stimulation in EEG device (VOS-EEG), that allows to interface
olfactory responses to cortical chemosensory event related potentials.

Abstract. The chapter presents a study on an electromyography-based wear-
able system for fall risk assessment. It has been focused especially on the
electrical activity analysis of the user’s lower limb muscles in relation to his
body movement. For that purpose four wireless electromyography probes
(sEMG) have been placed on the Gastrocnemius/Tibialis muscles and an
accelerometer-equipped t-shirt has been worn during the Activities of Daily
Living (ADLs) and fall events simulations. The results obtained have shown that
the simultaneous contraction of the muscles considered appear relevant imme-
diately after the starting of the imbalance condition, when the vertical velocity of
the user’s body is too low for the commonly used inertial-based pre-fall
detection systems. So an sEMG-based platform should be suitable to realize a
more efﬁcient platform to prevent the injures due to the fall. The mean lead-time
measured, in controlled condition, is more than 750 ms with performance in
terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity more than 75%.

Introduction
Fall events represent serious problem among older people [1]. The fall detectors appear
a very important tool in reducing the time of medical intervention, however it could be
desirable the development of a system able to detect falls before the impact on the ﬂoor
which, working together with an impact reduction systems, can limit the consequences
of falls [2, 3]. Several solutions have been proposed in the prevention of falls and
high-quality reviews have been presented [4]. They use inertial sensors and
threshold-based techniques for the classiﬁcation of the events. Their performance
suggest that speciﬁcity and sensitivity values are high, but the lead-time parameter
before the impact is low (less than 400 ms). For these reasons a new surface
EMG-based system to detect the risk of fall in a faster mode has been investigated. To
reduce the invasiveness, only four EMG sensors, placed through the gelled electrodes,
have been considered and used for measuring the lower limb muscles activities. The
main purpose of the work, is the development of a low-power, wireless, real time,

automatic and effective fall risk detection EMG-based framework. The lead-time before
the impact has been evaluated by simulating imbalance conditions and fall events
through a moveable platform activated by a pneumatic piston. The obtained results
show that the system, in simulated and controlled conditions, is able to detect the falls
about 780 ms before the impact on the ﬂoor. Moreover, an accelerometer-based system
have been used during the simulation campaign to evaluate the EMG signals respect to
the user’s body trunk vertical velocity after an imbalance condition.

Materials and Methods
2.1
Hardware Architecture
In this study a multi sensor approach has been used to evaluate the user’s muscles
behavior and their movement information during the simulation of Activities of Daily
Living (ADLs) and fall events. The BTS Bioengineering Freeemg 1000 probes [5] has
been chosen to acquire EMG signals of the lower limb muscles, while the
accelerometer-based SMARTEX garment [6] has been adopted for the analysis of the
movements of the upper part of the body. The accelerometer system has been used to
evaluate the vertical velocity proﬁle of the fall events and to create the ground truth
during the acquisition campaign for the data collection.
2.1.1
Surface Electromyography Acquisition System
The BTS probes (Fig. 1b) have been chosen since they are small (41.5  24.8  14
mm for mother electrode and 16  12 mm for satellite electrode) and lightweight (less
than 10 gr). Moreover they can transmit the data for about eight hours in streaming and
wireless mode (Zigbee protocol) up to 20 m in free space. The system allows an
accurate acquisition data by using a resolution of 16 bit and a 1 kHz frequency rate.
In this study, for the fall risk assessment, the Gastrocnemius lateralis and Tibialis
anterior muscles have been chosen for the monitoring of the user’s lower limb. The

sensors have been worn through the common pre-gelled silver/silver chloride
(Ag/AgCl) electrodes by using clips, allowing a fast, simple and resistant mounting.
Several kinds of Ag/AgCl electrodes have been tested and the models that have shown
the best trade-off between the signal quality and weareability are the Kendall H124SG
model (dimensions 30  24 mm) and Fiab PG10C model (dimensions ø26 mm),
shown in Fig. 1a. The Ag/AgCl electrodes are very easy to wear but they may induce
skin irritation and allergies, moreover their signal quality should be degraded due to the
drying of the gel over time [7]. Thus new biocompatible, textile and more comfortable
wearable electrodes [8] could be adopted to increase the user acceptability.
2.1.2
Accelerometer-Based Acquisition System
The sensorized garment Wearable Wellness System (WWS) produced by Smartex
(Fig. 2), has been used to acquire the acceleration data and to obtain chest movement
information, relevant for the posture and fall recognition [9]. The WWS is made up of a
washable and comfortable t-shirt and of the electronic board SEW for the data
acquisition and communication. The t-shirt integrates the piezo resistive textile sensors
for the breathe-rate monitoring and the electrodes for the heart-rate evaluation, while a
MEMS tri-axial accelerometer sensor for the movement detection is placed on the
SEW. In the presented study only the data coming from the accelerometer have been
stored. The accelerometer is DC coupled and allows the evaluation of the static and
dynamic acceleration with an acquisition rate of 25 Hz, enough for the movement
evaluation [10]. The accelerometer data can be sent by the wireless transmitter, placed
on the SEW board for more than eight hours in a streaming mode up to 20 m in free
space.
2.2
Data Collection
To analyze the pattern of sEMG signals for fall events and ADLs, a data collection has
been accomplished by 5 young healthy actors (4 male and 1 female) with different age
(27.5 ± 6.7 years), weight (63.5 ± 9.2 kg) and height (1.72 ± 0.13 m). They have

simulated more than 120 ADLs and 24 fall events wearing the sEMG probes and the
WWS garment as described in paragraph 2.1. The data have been collected on a PC
host equipped with both Bluetooth and Zigbee receivers. The signals coming from the
accelerometer sensor and sEMG probes have been elaborated trough the Mathworks
Matlab computing software. The ground-truth of each sequence of simulated events has
been recorded and labelled. The posture and events simulated were: sitting, walking,
standing, lying down, voluntary/involuntary falling down. For the involuntary fall
simulation a movable pneumatic platform has been adopted [11]. It is equipped with an
IMU sensor for the evaluation of the perturbation intensity and with a system to detect
the precise instant of the impact on the mat. The same platform has been considered in
the simulation of the voluntary fall event: the actor dropped himself on the mat without
any piston activation. At the end, the combination of the data coming from the two
aforementioned wearable systems has allowed the evaluation of the electromyography
analysis on the Gastrocnemius/Tibialis muscles during the ADLs and in correspon-
dence to each phase of the falls simulated.
2.3
Computational Data Processing
For the data analysis of the aforementioned wearable systems the pre-processing,
calibration and feature extraction phases have been considered. They are described in
the following.
2.4
Surface Electromyography Software Steps
Pre-processing. The raw data have been ﬁltered through a 8th FIR (Finite Impulse
Response) Filter, with cut frequencies between 20 and 450 Hz reduce the artifact, the
noise and the signal aliasing. Moreover, to compare the EMG-tension relationship the
signals have been processed by generating their full wave rectiﬁcation and their linear
envelope, using a 10th order low-pass Butterworth ﬁlter, with cut-off frequency of
10 Hz.
Calibration. For the calibration procedure the Maximal Voluntary Contraction
(MVC) of the Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis muscle groups have been
calculated. The MVC value has been measured considering the mean amplitude of the
highest signal in a window of 5 s. Then each muscle’s MVC values have been used to
normalize the sEMG data and to decrease the intra-subject variability of the elec-
tromyography signals.
Feature extraction. Several features relevant for the analysis of the examined
muscles have been tested [12] and those with higher discrimination degree for the
pre-fall detection have been considered. The best results in terms of data collected
during the simulation campaign, have been obtained considering the simultaneous
contraction
of
the
antagonist
Gastrocnemius-Tibialis
muscles,
using
the
Co-Contraction Indices (CCI) [13] in a sliding windows of 100 ms.

325

2.4.1
Accelerometer-Based Software Steps
Pre-processing. The acceleration data on three axes were ﬁltered out by a low pass 8th
order, 10 Hz cut-off FIR ﬁlter to minimize the noise and the human tremors. Moreover
the data have been converted into gravitational units to represent acceleration data in
the range ±2 g, in order to make it possible to extract the user posture and to avoid
orders of magnitude too different in the features.
Calibration. This phase has been accomplished when the user wore the garment
for the ﬁrst time in standing position for 10 s in order to obtain the baseline of the signal
for the feature extraction step.
Feature extraction. The vertical velocity proﬁle and the tilt angle of the trunk [14]
have been considered to recognize and to evaluate the movements during the events
simulated. These features appear relevant to distinguish falls from normal ADLs [14]
and to detect the pre-impact fall with an average lead-time of about 400 ms prior the
impact on the ﬂoor. From the comparison among the EMG and accelerometer features,
it has been possible to study the muscle contraction behavior during the ADLs sim-
ulated and each fall phase.
3
Results
For the performance evaluation of the EMG-based system proposed, all data obtain
during the campaign simulation have been investigated. The mean vertical velocity
measured for all fall simulated has been 2.72 ± 0.61 m/s, while for ADLs the maxi-
mum vertical velocity measured has been 1.73 m/s. In the Fig. 3 is reported an example
of the accelerometer and electromyography parameters calculated during a backward
fall, simulated through the movable platform. From Fig. 1 it is possible to verify that
the simultaneous contraction of the gastrocnemius and tibialis muscles starts with the
onset of platform motion (the initial phase during an imbalance condition) and an high
value for the CCI feature has been obtained before the impact on the mat. For instance,
in Fig. 3 the lead time before the impact is about 730 ms, while considering all fall
described in the “Data Collection” paragraph the lead-time is about 780 ms. The tilt
angle analysis has been considered to produce a more complete study on the fall and on
the ADLs dynamic related to the EMG patterns. It is possible to note that the peak of
the muscles contraction occurs at the start of the trunk displacement, when the vertical
velocity of the trunk is almost zero. This means that the EMG based system could act
before the inertial-based pre-impact detection systems. The sensorized movable plat-
form has been able to detect the start of perturbation and the instant of the impact on the
mat (see paragraph 2.2); in this way it has been possible to measure the duration of each
fall (the mean duration is about 1.5 s). One half of the dataset has been used to calculate
the threshold values of features to detect the instability events, while the remaining part
has been considered to test the performance in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity [15]
through a threshold-based approach. The best results have been achieved by using the
Co-Contraction indices with a threshold value of 28.3 (78.6% for sensitivity and 77.4%
for speciﬁcity). To reach adequate computation cost regarding the feature extraction,
only the CCI have been selected. In Fig. 4 some examples of features obtained for a
sequence of ADLs have been reported. According to the results obtained, the system
326

developed seems to be an efﬁcient starting point to realize a fast and efﬁcient platform
for the fall risk assessment. The performance in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity
could be improved monitoring other muscles of the lower limb increasing the number
of probes.

Conclusion
This work presents a preliminary study of a real-time and minimally invasive pre-fall
detection surface Electromyography-based system. During the data acquisition cam-
paign several ADLs and involuntary/voluntary fall events have been simulated, worn
four probes on the lower limb and an accelerometer-based garment to compare the two
kind of signals during the fall events. In this way it has been possible to analyze the
user’s muscle behavior in relation with the velocity and the displacement of the user’s
body trunk. Signiﬁcant performance in terms of lead-time before the impact on the
ﬂoor has been measured, in controlled conditions, and the EMG system appears more
reactive respect to the inertial-based system. Future works will be focused to improve
the performance and the user acceptability of the system increasing the number of
probes and using more biocompatible and comfortable electrodes.

Abstract. This work deals on the design of a multisensorial anemometer able
to provide an accurate measurement of both wind speed and direction. The
system is based on thermal anemometry that is, probably, the preferable way to
measure instantaneous wind velocity in any weather condition and surrounding.
The application here proposed is based on a commercial ﬂow probe, the IST FS5
that shows a robust design without moving parts, small dimensions and is
suitable to operate up to 150 °C and a wind speed of 100 m/s. In addition, the
sensor is organized as a pattern of probes. In this way, being the analysis based
on differential measurements, analyzing the signal provided by each sensor is
possible to perform an accurate evaluation of both the wind speed and direction.

Introduction
The environmental meteorological monitoring has always been a ﬁeld of interest for the
human being. The possibility to measure instantaneous phenomena and provide pre-
dictions about certain future events can deﬁnitely have a positive impact in our life and
it is becoming a primary need in many activities. Wind monitoring, for instance, is
essential in many areas of interest; see for example sports like sail or skiing, structures
as bridges or skyscrapers, places as airports, beyond of urban environments. Contin-
uous and accurate measurements are often required also in absence of local and ﬁxed
stations. This necessity brings to the development of portable applications and to the
design of innovative systems, thanks to the availability of new technologies and
sensors.
Currently, the most used sensor for anemometric systems and measurements is the
electromechanical sensor, typically adopted in ﬁxed stations. This solution has been
developed over the years and allows reaching even very high performance, thanks also
to the progress of technology and circuit architectures. On the other hand, the large area
occupation and a continuous need of maintenance for the mechanical parts make this
system inadequate for portable applications or critical environments. Alternatives are

based on the measurement of pressure difference or on heat exchange with the air ﬂow
and the emergence of new solid-state electronic sensors allowed novel approaches in
the development of compact anemometric systems, without moving parts.
In this perspective, temperature-based anemometer technique is the best candidate
for portable systems. This method could be implemented in different ways, classiﬁed as
CCA (Constant Current Anemometer), CVA (Constant Voltage Anemometer) and
CTA (Constant Temperature Anemometer). Thermal anemometry is probably the
preferable way to measure instantaneous wind velocity in any conditions [1–8]. The
working principle is based on the cooling effect of the airﬂow on a heated body.
Convective heat transfer from a heated element (typically a resistor heated by an
electrical current) to a ﬂuid or gas ﬂow is a function of the velocity of the ﬂow itself,
the element relative temperature and the physical properties of the medium. The
application here proposed is based on a commercial ﬂow sensor, the IST FS5 [9, 10]
used at constant temperature and the power needed to keep it constant is an indirect
measure of the heat exchanged with the air ﬂow. Mapping the relationship between the
output voltage and the wind speed, is possible to obtain the ﬂow velocity. In addition,
the designed thermal anemometer is organized as a pattern of sensors. In this way,
being the analysis based on differential measurements, analyzing the signal provided by
each sensor is possible to perform an accurate evaluation of both the wind speed and
direction. The logical section for the data management and wind ﬂow identiﬁcation
process is implemented by means of a microcontroller and in this ﬁrst prototype, it has
been realized with an Arduino board programmed accordingly.

Thermal Anemometry
Let us consider a heated resistor, immersed in a ﬂuid or gas ﬂow; assuming that the
resistor is in thermal equilibrium with its environment, the electrical power input is
equal to the power lost to convective heat transfer:
P ¼ Te  T0
ð
Þ  Ae  h ¼ I2Re
ð1Þ
where I is the input current, Re is the resistance of the element, Ae is the affected surface
area of the element and h is the heat transfer coefﬁcient of the resistor itself. The term
Te  T0 expresses the difference between the resistor temperature and the ﬂuid (or gas)
temperature respectively. As well known, the resistance of the element Re is also a
function of temperature:
Re ¼ RðTref Þ 1 þ a  ðTe  Tref Þ


ð2Þ
where a is the thermal coefﬁcient of the resistor and Tref is the reference temperature.
The heat transfer coefﬁcient h of the resistor is a function of the ﬂuid velocity, as
suggested by King’s law:
h ¼ a þ b  vn;
n  0:5
ð3Þ
A Multisensorial Thermal Anemometer System

where a and b are coefﬁcient obtained by a previous calibration of the heated resistive
element. Combining the Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), we have:
a þ b ~vn ¼ I2RðTref Þ 1 þ a  ðTe  Tref Þ



Þ  Ae
ð4Þ
and by inverting this equation, it is possible to calculate the medium ﬂow velocity.

System Architecture
The application here proposed is based on a commercial ﬂow sensor, the IST FS5
(Fig. 1a), which shows a robust design without moving parts, small dimensions and is
suitable to operate up to 150 °C and a wind speed of 100 m/s [9, 10].
The device makes use of a special ceramic plane used as base plane, with low
thermal conductivity, and thermal resistors. The resistive structure consists of two
platinum resistors, used as heater and temperature sensor, respectively. The whole
device has also a special passivation, making this sensor suitable even for ﬂuid
measurements.
In this application, we adopted a CTA method with the sensor, in order to measure
the speed of the airﬂow, since a constant temperature anemometric strategy can provide
a better resolution then CCA and CVA strategies [1, 2].
For the information measurement extraction, we implemented a feedback con-
trolled Wheatston bridge, as in Fig. 2. In the scheme, the sensor represents the two low
branches of the bridge, where R5 is the heater and R6 is the temperature sensor of the
device. The latter is used to compensate for the medium temperature variation.
Resistance value of R1, R2 and R3 is properly calculated, in order to keep the bridge

balanced in normal conditions. In particular, the resistor R3 allows to keep a medium
temperature difference on the heater, that is essential for a correct measurement
operation, since if the ﬂow were suddenly slow down, the sensor might burn out in a
constant-current anemometer. For gas applications (airﬂow, for instance), this tem-
perature difference should be about 30 K and the proper R3 resistance value can be
calculated by the following expression:
R3  a  R0  DT  140 X
where
a ¼ 0:003902 k1; R0 ¼ 1200 X:
ð5Þ
When an airﬂow over the sensor surface occurs, the bridge undergoes an unbalance,
so the differential output of the bridge, ðVA  VBÞ, is different from zero. When the
difference is greater than zero (the resistance value of the heater decreases, due to the
cooling effect of the airﬂow), the output of the comparator switches at high level,
activating the transistor Q1. Therefore, an extra current is injected in the circuit,
rebalancing the bridge and keeping constant the temperature of the sensor. A nominal
bias current is guaranteed to the bridge by resistor R4, even when Q1 is off. Since the
bridge is always balanced, the resistance and temperature of the heater are constant,
thus the ﬂuid velocity become a function of input current and ﬂow temperature, sim-
plifying the expression (4) as follows:
Fig. 2. The single ﬂow sensor interface

333

a þ b ~vn ¼
I2Rh
AhðTh  T0Þ
ð6Þ
where Rh and Th are intended to be the resistance and temperature of the heater.
For a conventional thermal anemometer sensor—the so called “hot-wire sensor”—
there is only a heater, that is a wire crossed by a current, which is inserted in a single
branch of the bridge. In this case, an external temperature sensor is needed, in order to
measure the ﬂow temperature; for instance, the velocity is a function of the input
current and the medium temperature as well, as shown in (6). The IST FS5 device
provides a built-in temperature sensor, R6 in the scheme, that allows a compensation of
the airﬂow temperature effect directly in the bridge, thus the airﬂow expression simply
become a function of the input current only, or rather of the voltage of the C node in
Fig. 2. Therefore, the above equation could be expressed and simpliﬁed as follows:
VC ¼ V0 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1 þ k ~vn
p
ð7Þ
where VC is the CTA voltage output, k is a ﬂuid dependent constant and ~v is the air
velocity. The term V0 represents a free convection offset, due to the constant temper-
ature difference between the heater and the air. A previous characterization of the
circuit response with a known wind source allows calculating the airﬂow constant k, so
to obtain the voltage-to-wind speed characteristic curve as in Fig. 1b, which is not
linear for this sensor. Bu using at least three sensors, arranged for instance in a pattern
as in Fig. 3, is it possible to calculate the effective cooling airﬂow speed, by analyzing
the velocity components measured by the three sensors (Fig. 4).
Under those circumstances, a ﬁrst prototype of the anemometric system has been
implemented. The whole sensors conditioning circuit includes three Wheatstone
bridges as shown in Fig. 3, since we used three sensors in this ﬁrst test, for both
velocity and direction detection of the wind, as mentioned before.

The proposed system, see Fig. 5, has been characterized with a known wind source
and some results are shown in Fig. 6. The characteristic transfer function of each sensor
has already been shown in Fig. 1b; so particular emphasis has been put in the capability
to analyze also the wind direction, that is usually not possible with a single ﬂow sensor.
As illustrated in Fig. 6, the sensor has a fast response to any variation of the wind
direction and also a good resolution versus the ﬂow intensity. In fact, with a constant
source the output voltage of the sensor interface shows a maximum variation of about
200 mV.
The proposed solution appears to be suitable also for integration and further ben-
eﬁts both in term of performance, space occupation and power consumption can be
achieved with the introduction of advanced circuitry solutions for data manipulation
and transmission both in voltage and current mode [11–22] and an improved solution is
currently under design.

Conclusions
The paper deals on the design of a low-cost thermal anemometer able to measure both
wind speed and directions. It is a robust solution realized through a pattern of probes
making use of CTA technique. The base element of the sensor is a commercial device,
the FS5 from IST. The sensors interface embeds both analog and digital circuitry for
data manipulation and conditioning. The digital data manipulation has been demanded
to an Arduino board in the ﬁrst prototype, useful for testing and characterization of both
sensors and interface, but and advanced and fully integrated sensor solution is currently
under design.

Abstract. In this paper we show the developing and the applications of a
remotely controlled terrestrial vehicle (or Unmanned Ground Vehicles—UGV)
provided with an integrated sensory system for environmental monitoring. The
developed system is aimed to monitor some of the key air pollutants and harmful
compounds, usable in contaminated sites at high risk to human health. The
system is a 4WD radio-controlled vehicle, with small dimensions and low
weight, complemented by a sensory system based on hybrid sensors technology
(e.g. optic, electrochemical, gravimetric, etc…). These features allow this sys-
tem to be easily used when inspection missions are required, before or after any
environmental disaster. It is able to measure, in few minutes, the atmospheric
particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), CO2 and CO, H2S, SO2, NO2 in the
range between 15 and 5000 ppb. Moreover, it is equipped with a telemetry
system for the remote-controlled navigation, including a high-resolution camera,
a GPS antenna, an anemometer and proximity sensors. The core of the device is
a microprocessor board able to assist the navigation, acquiring values from
sensors, transfer/record data and control tens input/outputs up to a distance of
1 km. In this work we report some information regarding the integration, the
calibration and the data related to the monitoring of a waste landﬁll in the
closing phase, during the construction of the extractor for generated biogas.

Introduction
Unmanned Ground (UGV), Air (UAV), Surface (USV) and Underwater (UUV) vehi-
cles are useful in a wide ﬁeld of civil applications such as: environmental monitoring,
agricultural surveys, emergency and disaster relief [1–5]. There are companies that sell
UGVs that are able to detect leaks of oil and gas in the infrastructure, ensuring human
safety. Other companies that offer UGVs able to enter into pipe systems to monitor
toxic waste and chemical or radioactive material. In research ﬁeld, there are USVs
capable of sail the oceans and to report to scientiﬁc communities the measured data,
anywhere in the world. Advances in the electronics integration and software are

steadily increasing bringing the autonomous UGV navigation system towards low costs
with excellent level of reliability. At the same time, the growing demand of data related
to environmental pollution by policy makers, citizens and the scientiﬁc community
have stimulated the development of UGV with on-board environmental monitoring
systems.
We therefore propose a UGV system aimed to monitor some of the key air pol-
lutants and harmful compounds, usable in contaminated sites at high risk to human
health. In this paper we show the details of development and an application of a
remotely controlled terrestrial vehicle with sensory system integrated for environmental
monitoring. In particular, we report the results obtained from a measurement campaign
that consisted in the monitoring of the diffused emissions in a waste landﬁll area.

Experimental and Results
Proposed system consisted a 4WD (all-wheel drive) radio-controlled vehicle, with
small dimensions and low weight, complemented by a sensory system based on hybrid
sensors technology [6, 7]. Such a sensory system assembled within a terrestrial vehicle,
is able to measure: atmospheric particulate matter, CO2, CO, H2S, SO2 and NO2.
Starting from a commercial radio-controlled model (by Traxxas) we have designed and
developed a complete system that includes: vehicle, air sampling system for gases and
particles, a sealed measuring sensors chamber, a camera with wide angle lens and an
electronic controlling board (electronic) as depicted in the sketch (Fig. 1). The air
sampling system commutates between two distinct phase. During the measure, it
delivers the air (to be analyzed) to the sensors chamber. In the cleaning phase, it creates
the zero air, using a ﬁlter cartridge (Filter) and then delivers it to the sensor chamber.
An integrated optical particles counter (OPC-N2 by Alphasense Ltd) was used to
measure the amount of PM in the sampled air. The data generated by the OPC are
divided into three main classes, PM1, PM2.5 and PM10. The OPC sends the data to the
electronics that gets the data every 2 s. The CO2 concentration (0-5000 ppm) was
measured by a NDIR sensor (IRC-A1 by Alphasense Ltd). Electrochemical sensors (by
Alphasense Ltd) were used to measure the concentrations of CO, H2S, SO2 and NO2 in
the range between 15 and 5000 ppb. The electronic board was equipped with a
telemetry system for the remote-controlled navigation, which includes: (i) a
high-resolution camera; (ii) a GPS antenna; (iii) an anemometer and (iv) proximity
sensors. The core of the electronics was a microprocessor board able to assist the
navigation, acquire values from sensors, transfer/record data and to control tens of
input/outputs up to a distance of 1 km.
After the integration phase the system was tested in various scenarios, with different
soils structure and composition, to check the UGV navigation performances (see
Fig. 2).

Before assembling, we checked and calibrated the sensors with accurate, precise
and qualitatively controlled analytical instruments commonly used in our lab to mea-
sure and quantify the analyte concentrations in air. In Fig. 3 some example of dynamic
sensor responses are shown, in particular in Fig. 3c the sensor responses obtained when
the UGV navigated near to a trafﬁc zone are reported.
In order to validate in a real scenario our monitoring system, we have performed
several measurements in a waste landﬁll (about 60,000 m2) where was in progress the
developing of a biogas system. The developed UGV has monitored the gases and particles
concentrations in six points of interest closed to the extraction pipes (P0,…, P5). In Fig. 4
we report the values of two gases amounts (CO2, H2S) recorded during the campaign. P0
an P5 were outside the landﬁll site about 200 m from the boundary. P1 and P3 were two
points located in a part of landﬁll (Closed) where the extraction pipes were connected to
the biogas system. P2 and P4 were located in a portion of landﬁll “Open” where the biogas
system was to be completed. The results highlight that in the “Open” area the CO2, H2S
concentrations were more higher than those in the “Closed” area. This result has con-
ﬁrmed the state of progress of the biogas system.

Conclusions
We have developed and tested in a real scenario, a remotely controlled terrestrial vehicle
(or Unmanned Ground Vehicles—UGV) integrated with a sensory system for envi-
ronmental monitoring. The system was able to monitor atmospheric particulate matter
(PM1, PM2.5, PM10), CO2, H2S, SO2 and NO2. We have validated the functioning
of our system during a measurement campaign performed in a waste landﬁll where a
biogas system was under construction. The results highlight that in the “Open” area
(where the biogas system was to be completed) the CO2, H2S concentrations were more
higher than that in the “closed” area (where the extraction pipes were connected to the
biogas system). This result have conﬁrmed the state of progress of the biogas system.

Abstract. In this work, a new architecture for the design of very compact
instrumentation ampliﬁers is proposed. The ampliﬁer has been speciﬁcally
developed for use as a versatile block for sensor interfacing. The most inno-
vative feature of the proposed cell is the wide input common mode range, which
has a margin to both power rails as small as 200 mV. The circuit, which has
been implemented with the 3.3 V CMOS devices of the UMC 0.18 lm process,
operates with supply voltage in the 1.4–3.6 V range. An input offset voltage
standard deviation of 8 lV has been obtained using chopper modulation com-
bined with gain enhancement of the output current mirrors. The ampliﬁer per-
formances are estimated by means of accurate electrical simulations.

Introduction
The instrumentation ampliﬁer (in-amp) is one of the most versatile block for sensor
interfacing. The in-amp can be used to read the small-output signals of Wheatstone
bridges, (strain gauges, magneto-resistors), thermoelectric sensors and Hall sensors.
The development of complex Systems on a Chip, including several readout channels
inside a single integrated circuit, is demanding the development of very compact
instrumentation ampliﬁers. The current trend towards low supply voltages imposes
smaller and smaller margins of the input and output ranges with respect to the power
rails. The well-known three op-amp instrumentation ampliﬁer is a sub-optimal solution
in terms of area and suffers from input differential range clipping when the input
common mode voltage approaches either rails. The achievement of an acceptable
common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) with a three op-amp architecture requires
individual trimming of on-chip resistors, increasing production costs and complicating
the circuit layout [1]. The popular indirect current feedback [2, 3] architecture (ICF) is
more compact, has better CMRR performances, but is not suitable to achieve
rail-to-rain input ranges, since it is not possible to precisely stabilize the input
transconductance over wide common mode voltage intervals. Furthermore, ICF-based
ampliﬁers yield excellent performances only when designed to provide high voltage

gains, while are practically unusable for unity gain settings, due to saturation of the
input transconductors. Current-balancing in-amps [4] are extremely simple and com-
pact, but, again, their structure does not allow for rail-to-rail input ranges.
Recently, we proposed a novel in-amp architecture [5, 6], which combines an
almost rail-to-rail e input common mode range with extreme compactness, high speed,
compatibility with low supply voltages and intrinsically high CMRR. The ampliﬁer
exploited chopper modulation to reduce offset and ﬂicker noise. In this work, we
describe a modiﬁed version of the earlier ampliﬁer, consisting in application of
gain-enhancement [7, 8] to the output stage. The beneﬁt in terms of input referred offset
is demonstrated by means of electrical simulations.

Description of the Ampliﬁer Architecture
The principle of operation of the proposed ampliﬁer is illustrated in Fig. 1. The two
input transconductors, together with M1 and M2, form two embedded operational
ampliﬁers, whose output nodes are VSP and VSN, respectively. The two op-amps are
closed in unity-gain conﬁguration, so that the input signals VIP and VIN are copied to
VSP and VSN, respectively.

In this way, the current in R1 is proportional to the input differential voltage, VID,
and the following equation can be written for M1 and M2 drain currents:
ID1  ID2 ¼ 2VID=R1
ð1Þ
Currents ID1 and ID2 are copied into M1R and M2R, which, together with resistors
R2A, R2B and current sources IOR, form the output stage. As a result, the current ﬂowing
through the R2A, R2B series is a copy of the current in R1. Deﬁning R2 = R2A + R2B,
the output differential voltage is given by:
VOD  VOP  VON ¼ VID
R2
R1
ð2Þ
The ampliﬁer gain is simply given by R2/R1 resistance ratio. The common mode
feedback sub-circuit (CMFB in Fig. 1) sets the output common mode voltage to Vdd/2
in order to maximize the output swing. The principle underlying Eq. (1) was proposed
several decades ago for precision voltage-to-current converters [9]. However, in pre-
vious implementations, feedback-enhanced source or emitter follower stages are used
to replicate the input differential voltage across the reference resistor R1. Consequently,
rail-to-rail input ranges cannot be achieved with earlier architectures. In the circuit of
Fig. 1, which we have proposed for the ﬁrst time in Ref. [5], replication of the input
voltage across R1 relies on common source stages (i.e. M1 and M2), which have an
output swing that approaches both power rails. In order to allow VSP and VSN to track
the input signals over an as wide as possible range, complementary p-n input pairs have
been adopted for the transconductors. Stability of the two embedded operational
ampliﬁers has been obtained by means of Miller compensation, implemented by the
CCD-RCD series. Additional compensation is applied to the common mode domain
using the CCC-RCC, series, due to critical stability issues found in the design phase.
The actual circuit, which was described in Refs. [5, 6], used cascode structures for
M1, M2, M1R, M2R and current sources I0 and I0R. This implied a slight degradation of
the input and output ranges, but it was necessary to improve precision of current
replication from R1 to R2. Reduction of the input offset voltage and ﬂicker noise, which
are severe drawbacks peculiar to compact CMOS ampliﬁers, has been obtained by
means of chopper modulation.
Experimental tests performed on several samples after preliminary data publication
of Ref. [6], showed that random input offset voltage was much larger than expected.
Analysis of the circuit revealed that the offset derived from MOSFETs in the common
gate stage of the cascode structures, which were not affected by the beneﬁt of chopper
modulation. This problem cannot be solved by moving the chopper demodulators from
the input to the output of the common gate stages, since the intrinsic switched-capacitor
parasitic resistance of the modulators would alter the ampliﬁer gain.
In this work, we have applied a gate-enhancement strategy to enclose the common
gate devices into feedback loops, reducing their impact on the ampliﬁer offset. The
proposed circuit is shown in Fig. 2. Input transconductors OTA-IN receive the input
voltage from the chopper modulator shown on the left of the ﬁgure. Demodulation is
operated by SB1, at the input of M3–M4 common gate stage. Modulator SB2 is

necessary, as customary, to shift the offset and ﬂicker contribution of M7–M8 current
sources to high frequencies. In order to improve matching between the M1, M2 pair and
its M1R, M2R replica, SD dummy modulator, driven by a constant “0” logical value, has
been placed in the input section.
Gain enhancement is applied to all common gate devices in the output stage.
Considering M3–M4 differential common gate stage, we note that gate voltages are
driven in a closed loop fashion by transconductors OTA-G1 and OTA-G2.
The effect of this solution is that M1R and M2R drain-source voltages closely track
M1, M2 ones, respectively, with low sensitivity to M3 and M4 parameters. This improves
further the circuit linearity and gain accuracy but, more importantly, suppresses the
mentioned effect of M3–M4 on the ampliﬁer offset. Clearly, M1R–M2R drain-source
voltage mismatch is now dominated by mismatch of OTA-G1,2 offset voltages. For this
reason, modulator SG1 swaps the two transconductors at any clock transition, shifting
the transconductor offset to high frequencies. The same procedure is applied to M5–M6
common gate devices by means OTA-G3, OTA-G4 transconductors and SG2 modulator.

Output common mode stabilization has been obtained as in Fig. 1, by means of a
differential ampliﬁer that picks-up the middle-point voltage of resistor R2, compares it to
the target value and drives M7–M8 current sources (I0R in Fig. 1) accordingly.
Input transconductors OTA-IN consist of simple folded cascode differential
ampliﬁers, shown in the simpliﬁed schematic view of Fig. 3.
The differential currents of the complementary input pairs are combined in the
output cascode structure. Devices have been sized to obtain input common mode
ranges that exceed the power rails. The typical transconductance variation of this stage,
occurring when the input common mode voltage is swept from ground to Vdd, does not
impact on the DC and low frequency characteristics of the feedback loops built around
the OTA-IN stage, so that constant-Gm approaches have not adopted. Transconductors
OTA-G1,2 are p-type, simple differential ampliﬁers while n-type versions have been
used for OTA-G3,4 in order to match the required quiescent voltage levels.

Simulation Results
The ampliﬁer has been designed using the 0.18 lm CMOS process of UMC. All
MOSFETs used in the ampliﬁer belong to the 3.3 V subset: this choice was made in
order to allow operation up to 3.6 V supply voltages. Combination of regular and low
threshold devices available in the 3.3 V subset of the process has been used to
maximize the interval of applicable supply voltages and facilitate voltage level

matching inside the gain-enhancement stages. Polysilicon resistors have been used for
R1 and R2. Resistance R2 was set to 300 kX, while R1 was implemented as a pro-
grammable resistor string. Possible values, selectable by means of digitally controlled
switches, were 300, 25, 15, and 7.5 kX, corresponding to ampliﬁer gains of 1, 12, 20
and 40. The total supply current is 90 lA, while the minimum supply voltage was
1.4 V. The total area of the cell, estimated from a preliminary layout, was
270  270 lm2.
Simulations shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 refer to a gain of 20. Figure 4 shows the
output differential voltage as a function of the input differential voltage for two Vdd
values, indicated in the ﬁgure. This result has been obtained with a DC sweep with the
chopper clock ﬁxed to a constant logic value.

The output swing is limited by two different mechanisms, depending on the supply
voltage. In the case of Vdd = 1.5 V, deviation from the linearity is due to the minimum
voltage drop of the cascode structures shown in Fig. 2, while for Vdd = 3.3 V it is the
maximum current that can be delivered to R2 by M1R and M2R to be exceeded. This
limit is dictated by the ampliﬁer bias current that was optimized for the low Vdd case.
Figure 5 shows the dependence of the output voltage on the input common mode
voltage, for a ﬁxed input differential signal (10 mV).
Note that the input common mode voltage starts to affect the output voltage only
when the distance from one of the rails falls below 200 mV, conﬁrming that an
almost-rail-to-rail performance has been actually achieved.
The input referred offset voltage was estimated from the output offset obtained by
means of transient simulations. The resulting output waveforms have been averaged
over a clock cycle in order to extract the mean value, which would be otherwise
concealed by the relatively large offset ripple. The histogram in Fig. 6 represents the
result of 20 Monte Carlo runs.
The estimated standard deviation is 8 lV, which has to be compared with the
50 lV value obtained with the previous version of the circuit. This result conﬁrms the
effectiveness of the combination of chopper modulation and gain enhancement. It
should be observed that, differently from previous works regarding much less compact
in-amps [3, 10], no strategies have been implemented to reduce the output ripple. This
is not a limitation for use in acquisition systems where ripple rejection can be per-
formed in the digital domain, exploiting, for example, the decimation ﬁlter of a
delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter.

Abstract. In Medium Voltage (MV) applications, innovative solutions for
voltage and current measurements are investigated in this last years. In partic-
ular, technical solutions characterized by proper metrological performance and
at the same time small size, low cost, and simple integrability with communi-
cation networks are followed with the aim of operating within the modern
industrial context and in the smart grid. In these scenarios, the paper describes a
current transducer thought for industrial applications and based on a cheap
commercial AMR sensor. A deep experimental analysis is carried out to verify
the metrological performance of the proposed system for both Direct and
Alternate Current operating, and to verify the inﬂuence of the environmental
temperature on the input-output characteristic. The obtained results have shown
that the proposed system allows reaching metrological performance suitable for
typical MV applications if the temperature compensation is carried out.

Introduction
The measurements of electrical quantities in the context of electricity distribution
networks, has always been a very important task. In particular, in recent years, with the
advent of smart grids, the functions of the measuring devices have become increasingly
complex, and the requests are changed according to the needs of the network [1].
Currently we can assist to the migration from the use of conventional measurement
transformers to the use of modern sensors capable of monitoring voltages and currents
line, as well as the ﬂow of power, for which the costs and overall dimensions signif-
icantly are less than the previous solutions [2]. In particular, the efforts of current
research activity in the ﬁeld are mainly addressed to provide measuring devices able to
offer adequate performance (for the context) and at the same time showing a low
installation complexity, small size, low processing complexity and contained costs [1–
2]. Focusing the attention on current measurements, there are solutions which in part
could warrant these requests, but although presenting a low installation complexity and
proper measurement performance, require complex conditioning electronics and

to these demands we ﬁnd:
– Inductive sensors: the highest performance are achieved with ones base on Rogowski
coil [3]. Using techniques of precision winding, the coils are produced so that the
output value ensures insensitivity to interference generated by the external magnetic
ﬁeld and is not affected by the position of the current conductor inside the bull.
Basically, a current measurement system based on Rogowski coil sensor is consti-
tuted by the combination of a coil and an electronic circuitry. The main features of
these types of systems are the wide dynamic range, high linearity in frequency, high
isolation, immune to large loads, low installation complexity.
– Optical Sensors: based on the Faraday effect for current measurements [1–3]. The
current sensor,isconstitutedbyasuitablyshapedglassblockwithinwhichthepolarized
light sent from an optical ﬁber follows a closed path around a central hole in which the
conductor is passed, of which one wants to measure the ﬂow; at the end of the path the
light is collected by another optical ﬁber that transports it to the reading unit that
measures the rotation of the polarization plane by the Faraday effect. These type of
sensors are generally capable of measuring currents up to 2 kA. Also the power nec-
essary for the operation of the sensors is provided by an optical signal, thus obtaining a
complete electrical insulation between the reading unit and the ﬁeld sensors [4]. Optical
techniques used also have several advantages, such as easier isolation, a wider band-
width, higher dynamic range and immunity to electromagnetic interference.
– Magnetic ﬁeld sensors: typically based on silicon, of small size, good spatial res-
olution, adequate sensitivity for many applications. In particular we ﬁnd giant
magnetoresistance sensors, GMR, characterized by a multilayer structure with
alternating thin ﬁlms, metal type, and ferromagnetic conductor (non-magnetic), that
in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, provide changes in electrical resistance
of the functional material that ranges from 10 to 20% up to 70% [5].
In addition to the GMR, there is also another class of magnetic ﬁeld sensors based
on the magnetoresistive effect, the AMR (anisotropic magnetoresistive). The
structure is composed of nickel-iron of a thin ﬁlm (permalloy) deposited on a silicon
wafer and structured so as to have a functional material ﬁlament (resistive), whose
resistance changes up to 2–3% in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [6]. In practice, 4
magnetoresistence are arranged in the typical conﬁguration of a Wheatstone bridge,
which allows to measure both the intensity and the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld,
supposed uniaxial [6].
Summarizing, the main disadvantages linked to the use of inductive sensors with high
measuring accuracy is mainly the cost of implementation, while for the optical sensors,
derive mainly from the sensitivity of the optical ﬁber to multiple parameters, and then to
the difﬁculty of separating the contribution related to the electric quantity of interest from
others; furthermore, as for the Rogowsky coils, the cost of the overall system is still
signiﬁcantly higher than solutions that include the use of magnetic ﬁeld sensors [3].
The importance of the innovative sensors to giant magnetoresistance, is related to
the improvement of various relevant factors for the industrial application of GMR
sensors [5], such as greater strength measuring sensitivity to an external magnetic ﬁeld,

associated to the more accentuated decrease of the electric resistance (10–20%),
compared to AMR sensors (2–3%). The amplitude of the signal does not depend on the
frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld applied, tolerate very intense magnetic ﬁelds (100 T)
without damage, linearity of the R/H curve (98% in the range of 10–70% of the applied
magnetic ﬁeld, temperature stability equal to about 0.15%/°C, heat tolerance up to
150 °C broad range of the external magnetic ﬁeld variation, from 0 to 300 Gauss [5].
On the other hand, they require external control circuitry able to constantly ensure a
proper axis of magnetization of the reference and an offset on the output signal
compensation, due to the magnetization of the same sensor. Also a single GMR sensor
only measures the intensity of the external magnetic ﬁeld and not his hand [5–7].
As it regards the AMR sensors, instead, even though offer features less accurate, as
the range of magnetic ﬁeld intensity up to 100 Gauss, linearity in the band up to a few
MHz and temperature dependence, their constructive structure provides for the internal
use of self-magnetization systems (set/reset) and offset compensation, which allow a
much simpler development complexity compared to GMR [8].
This paper proposes a measurement device for current, based on the effect of
magnetic ﬁeld. The principle of operation is based on detecting the magnetic ﬁeld
produced by the current that ﬂows through a conductor, using the Biot-Savart law [8].
The sensor used belongs to the category AMR (anisotropic magneto resistive), it in fact
is based on the effect magnetoresistive, that is, on the variation of the internal resistivity
of the sensor, in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld [8].

Brief Recall of AMR Sensors
The magnetoresistive sensors, allow to make the magnetic ﬁeld measurements, taking
advantage of the physical properties of some materials called AMR (Anisotropic
Magneto Resistive) or anisotropic materials whose resistance varies with the variation
of the external magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, for this type of sensor, the resistivity, q, of
the material is related to the external magnetic ﬁeld according to one of the relation
cos2h type, where h is the angle between the magnetization M and the current vector I
[8], where M is a vector quantity with which we quantify the magnetic effects related to
mini dipoles that are created or are present at an internal of the material (Fig. 1).

The deposition of the functional material occurs in the presence of an external
magnetic ﬁeld, so as to determine a preferred direction of magnetization. This makes
anisotropic material, but it improves the response characteristic in terms of repeata-
bility, low noise and low hysteresis of the output signals.
Due to the above-mentioned anisotropy, the greatest resistivity variation in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld will occur when the electric current ﬂows in a direction
parallel to the axis of the preferential magnetization. When a magnetic ﬁeld is applied
in a direction orthogonal to said axis, the magnetization vector rotates by an angle, and
this causes a variation of the resistance to the passage of electric current that drives the
device. In the measurement conﬁguration, this will cause a relative change of resis-
tance, and a proportional voltage signal, the output at the terminals of the Wheatstone
bridge. The characterization of the behavior of this device, furthermore, indicates that
the relative change of resistance is linear when the magnetic ﬁeld and current are placed
at an angle of 45°. For this reason, resistive ﬁlm they are deposited on each of the
places ﬁlaments at 45° to the preferential direction of magnetization, so that the output
signal is generated in the linear response region of the bridge.
There are various techniques by means of which it is possible to obtain a linear
relationship within wide values of magnetic ﬁeld, ±6 Gauss [8]. The sensor consists of
4 resistors, Fig. 2, connected in a diamond constituting a Wheatstone bridge, this leads
to a differential type output represented by OUT+ and OUT−pins, while the bridge of
resistors is fed via pins Vbridge and GND. The sensor output reading may be performed,
with an operational ampliﬁer in subtractor conﬁguration or by means of an instru-
mentation ampliﬁer [8].
This solution is not optimal in reality, since, the Wheatstone bridge has an offset
voltage that will add up or escape to the output voltage. For this reason, it is possible to
exploit an offset circuit, reached by pins “Offset+” and “Offset−“. These are connected
to a small inner winding to the same sensor and disposed in such a manner that the
magnetic ﬁeld that is to be generated when current ﬂows go to add up or subtract with
the magnetic ﬁeld component with respect to which the sensor is sensitive. This
winding is generally used within a negative feedback loop in order to make the
automatic zeroing. The current which is circular can make is generally a few tens of
mA and the winding resistance is between 2.5 and 3.5 X, while the generated magnetic
ﬁeld is an average of 51 mA/Gauss.

One of the most complicated parts with which the designer must challenge them-
selves, but which are of magnetoresistive sensors among the most sensitive sensors to
detect magnetic ﬁelds, are pins SET and RESET (S/R+ and S/R−), positive and neg-
ative, respectively [8]. As said, the resistivity is dependent on the angle h between the
vector of magnetized organization M and the current vector I. Due to strong external
magnetic ﬁelds, such direction may be altered causing a deterioration of the sensitivity
of the sensor itself. This is not damaged but due to a “memory” effect which keeps the
magnetization vector M shifted with respect to that originally set, the sensor will not
work in its maximum performance [8]. By means of the pin S/R+ and S/R−, which are
connected to another internal winding of the switch it is possible to restore the initial
conditions, “storing” the sensor. The magnetic ﬁeld generated by this new winding
must obtain the direction such as to modify the vector M, which is different from that
which it should have in the case of the winding connected to pins Offset+ and Offset−.
In particular, while in the case of the winding associated offset ﬂowing a DC current of
a few tens of mA, in the winding associated with the function of Set and Reset ﬂow
several amperes, up to 4 A, but in a pulsed way. The pulse should have a duration of
2 s, and the pulse width of the current ranges from 0.5 to 4 A, since in some cases it
has no interest in obtaining the best sensitivity allowed by the sensor.
This winding allows to obtain maximum sensitivity of the sensor thanks to the fact
that properly restores the magnetization vector. For this purpose, however, it is only
necessary the impulse of Set or Reset. The distinction between the two pulses is only in
the direction of the current, in particular the pulse Set is such that the current enters S/R
+ and comes out from S/R−, while for the Reset pulse is reversed reasoning, that is, the
current ﬂows out from S/R+ and entering S/R−[8].
As previously mentioned, the sensor provides a measurement of the output voltage
of the differential type, which is performed by means of a Wheatstone bridge. Typi-
cally, the output voltage is few mV, therefore, it is needed to amplify such quantity for
improving the measurement sensitivity. Figure 3 shows the schematic of the ampliﬁer
used. It is composed of an operational ampliﬁer, in a differential conﬁguration, with a
gain equal to 100. Such a circuit has been realized for each sensor axis.

Experimental Characterization
An experimental analysis has been made for analyzing the metrological performance of
the realized system [9, 10]. The measuring station (see Fig. 4) can be divided into two
main parts: the stimulus generation and detection. The part of stimulus generation
involves the use of a current source capable of generating different current values both
DC and AC for different frequency values. The detection part comprises the system
composed by the sensor for the detection of magnetic ﬁeld and by measurement
instrumentation (digital multi-meter and oscilloscope) for acquiring the sensor signal
output. The device characterization has been made by considering tests with different
DC and AC current values, and for different frequency values. During all tests, the
environmental temperature was kept constant at a value of 25 °C.
The obtained results are reported in Figs. 5 and 6. They show that the sensor
response well approximate a straight line, and therefore, the relation between the sensor
output voltage and the current, can be expressed as:

Once deﬁned the input-output relationship of the sensor, the percentage error for
different current values and frequencies is reported in Fig. 7. It shows that the error is
always below 0.2%.

From this ﬁrst analysis, we can say that the AMR sensor presents an excellent
performance for the current measurement, especially for the medium-voltage applica-
tions, where the current value lie in the range 50–100 A. However the linearity is
assured if the magnetic ﬁeld is inside ±6 Gauss.
4
Temperature Inﬂuence and Compensation
One of the factors that must always be taken into account when making the charac-
terization of a device for measuring electrical quantities, is certainly the temperature.
For this reason it was necessary to observe the HMC1022 sensor response to changes
of this magnitude. The characterization was carried out by observing the variation of
the response of the sensor, the frequency of 50 Hz, for different current values, with the
range of temperature changing from 30 to 100 °C, in steps of 5 °C.
From an initial check of the results, it is evident that, as the temperature increases,
the sensor output tends to decrease. This variation can therefore lead to a greater error
than the one found in the preceding paragraph-tooth. It is therefore, very important to
understand if, when the temperature varies, the sensor response still tends to be linear.
This behavior is shown in Fig. 8.
Looking at the graph, it is evident that the sensor input-output curve is still linear
even if with the curve slope depends on the temperature. As result, this behavior brings
to a signiﬁcance increasing of the percentage error which can assume also values close
to 30%, if the Eq. (1), achieved for the environmental temperature of 25 °C, is used to
estimate the current ﬂowing in the wire. These results are shown in Fig. 9. Never-
theless, it is possible to perform a characterization of the sensor as a function of the
operating temperature, and then obtain a new output equation of the system:

where “T” is the actual operating temperature and “k” is a suitable correction factor. In
this way, it is possible to apply the Eq. (2) in order to compensate the sensor output
with respect to the temperature.
As result, repeating the tests for different temperatures, once again the percentage
errors are all conﬁned within the 0.2% limit, as shown in Fig. 10. Of course, this
aspects would suggest to add a temperature sensor to the system thus allowing to adjust
the input-output I/O curve in the basis of the temperature.
So, ultimately, for optimal performance, it is necessary to equip the measuring
system of a simple temperature sensor, which interacts by means of a microprocessor,
modiﬁes the characteristic equation of the sensor as the temperature varies.

Conclusions
The realized device allows measuring the current ﬂowing in a wire without contact by
means of the measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld due to the unknown current. If a
temperature compensation is made, the achieved metrological performance are
acceptable for the context of MV applications and are comparable with ones of
competitor solutions. The proposed system offers considerable advantages in terms of
cost, conditioning circuit complexity and overall size. Current efforts are focused on the
development of methods for increasing the immunity of the system to external dis-
turbances [11]. Future developments will concern with the design and PCB realization
of the system which will include a temperature sensor, a microprocessor for data
processing and communication management.

Abstract. Blood Pressure (BP) is considered a signiﬁcant indicator of cardiac
risk. By providing information about the hemodynamic load on the heart, BP
detected in a central site may have added value with respect to the more familiar
peripheral arterial pressure (i.e. measured on the brachial artery). Laser Doppler
Vibrometry (LDV) has been demonstrated to be a reliable non-contact technique
to measure the cardiovascular signals and parameters. LDV has a high sensi-
tivity of acquisition and it is able to measure the skin vibrations related to
cardiac activity when the laser beam is pointed in correspondence of the carotid
artery. The obtainable vibrational signal (i.e. a velocity signal), VibroCar-
dioGram (VCG), can provide relevant physiological parameters, including Heart
Rate (HR) as well as more advanced features encoded in the contour of the pulse
waveform. In this work, the authors aim to discuss the possibility of deriving the
blood pressure signal from the vibrations of the carotid artery detected by LDV.
6 healthy participants were tested; the VCG was calibrated by means of diastolic
and mean arterial pressure values measured by means of an oscillometric cuff.
An exponential model was applied to the VCG signal of each participant in
order to derive the pressure waveform from the displacement of the investigated
vessel. Results show an average difference of around 20% between systolic
pressure measured at brachial level (i.e. peripheral pressure value) and systolic
pressure derived from VCG signal measured over the carotid artery (i.e. central
pressure). This is consistent with the literature describing the physiological
increase of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Pressure Pulse (PP) at increased
distances from the heart (because of the presence of reﬂected waves). Moreover,
the average measured displacements of the carotid artery are physiologically
reliable (i.e. hundreds of micrometers). LDV seems to have the potential of
correctly detecting the pressure waveform without contact. However, a com-
parison with a reference method is required to validate the proposed measure-
ment technique.

Introduction
Vital signs, such as Heart Rate (HR) and Blood Pressure (BP), are fundamental to
determine the wellbeing of people. Several cardiovascular pathologies can be predicted
by means of central BP assessment, which is considered an important predictive factor,
even more than peripheral BP [1, 2]. Its continuous recording permits the assessment of
fundamental parameters related to cardiac activity (e.g. HR) and to pulse waveform
(e.g. dicrotic notch). Intra-arterial pressure catheters, containing miniature pressure
transducers, represent the gold standard for the measurement of time-continuous
pressure signal [3], but is uncomfortable and unsuitable for routine monitoring.
Applanation tonometry is a contact non-invasive technique for the assessment of the
local pressure waveform, but shows some relevant drawbacks [2]. In fact, there is a
lack of studies validating the method versus invasive techniques in a general popula-
tion, and for that the application of such transfer function is still subject to debate.
Moreover, the application of arterial tonometry is particularly challenging in obese
subjects.

junction, to evaluate the aortic area curves. This technique allows to directly measure
the variation of the vessel section during the cardiac cycle, but needs a calibration

Pulse-Wave-based Ultrasound Manometry (PWUM) is another non-invasive method
that combines Pulse Wave Imaging (PWI) and vessel diameter measurements for the
assessment of central BP [4]. It is based on the ultrasound scanning of the cross-section
of the vessel, in order to measure its diameter variation during cardiac cycle. The use of
LDV for the measurement of cardiovascular signals is datable at more of 10 years ago
[5]. The ﬁrst reason of the introduction of this technique has been the non-contact
capability of LDV to measure the skin vibrations, in particular where it is really difﬁcult
the application of the electrodes (i.e. in burnt subjects or preterm neonates [6]). The
acquisition of the carotid signal on the carotid artery with LDV provides a vibrocar-
diographic signal (VCG), consequent to mechanical cardiovascular events. Many
studies have focused their attention to the extent of cardiovascular parameters from
carotid artery [7–13]. In a previous work [14], the authors have made the hypothesis of
using LDV to non-invasively assess the blood pressure waveform. The aim of this
work is to discuss the feasibility of the application of a mathematic model to derive the
arterial pressure signal, at carotid level, from the vibrational signal measured by means
of a Laser Doppler Vibrometer.

Materials and Methods
LDV method was tested in a preliminary study on 6 healthy subjects. Participants was
informed about the test and they ﬁlled a consent form to permit the study of their data.

2.1
Measurement Setup
VCG and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were acquired simultaneously thanks to a
proper A/D board (PowerLab 4/25T, 12-bit resolution). The VCG signals were measured
with a single point LDV system (Polytec PDV100; calibration accuracy ±0.05 mm/s,
bandwidth 0.05 Hz–22 kHz, spot diameter <1 mm, sensitivity 0.2 V/(mm/s)). The
Polytec PDV100 utilizes Class 2 (eye safe) beam at 633 nm wavelength. The native
output of the LDV system is a velocity signal.
Three 2-mins trials were made for each participant. Furthermore, a conventional
oscillometric method was used to simultaneously assess BP at brachial level (P monitor
model UA-767BT-Ci from A&D Instruments, accuracy: ±3 mm Hg).
Three measures of blood pressure was acquired for each trials and a mean of the
diastolic and systolic values was considered.
During the trials, the participants were asked to lie supine and stay relaxed.
The vibrometer was placed on a tripod at a distance of 50 cm from the subject and
it was pointed perpendicularly to the skin of the participant, over the left common
carotid artery. A hydrating lotion (45% zinc oxide) was spread on the neck over the
carotid site to improve the reﬂectivity of the skin and, consequently, the quality of the
measurement (i.e. signal-to-noise ratio). In the present work, the carotid artery was
located by a palpation method on the neck, identifying the point of maximum pulsation
of the carotid artery.
A sketch of the measurement setup is represented in Fig. 1.

2.2
Signal Processing
The signal processing consists of the steps reported in Fig. 2 and after described in detail.
• Signal ﬁltering: a 3rd order Butterworth bandpass ﬁlter was applied to raw data.
0.1–30 Hz and 0.1–40 Hz were the two frequency bands considered for VCG and
ECG signals, respectively.
• Signal integration: VCG (i.e. velocity signal) was integrated to obtain a displacement
signal,which hasto becalibrated toobtainabsoluteBPvalues.Anoperationofdetrend
was performed on the displacement signal to achieve a mean value equal to zero.
• Computation of the average waveform: ECG signal was used to correctly separate
the single heartbeat in VCG signal. This allowed to detect the onset and the offset of
the single heart beats in the displacement signal. Then, each heartbeat was
re-sampled according to the mean heart period detected from ECG signal.
• Application of the calibration model: It was assumed that there is an exponential
relationship between arterial pressure waveform and arterial cross-section [7].
Diastolic BP and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) values were supposed to remain
fairly constant throughout the whole arterial tree. The systolic BP value extracted
from the resulting pressure waveform was compared to the corresponding oscillo-
metric BP value obtained from the brachial artery. The applied model relates the
displacement d(t) achieved from LDV data to the arterial pressure waveform p(t), as
described in (1) [15]:

Results
Table 1 shows the comparison between the systolic pressure measured by means of the
oscillometric cuff at brachial level and the one obtained from the calibration of the
VCG signal (i.e. the maximum peak of the calibrated pressure waveform).
Moreover, the displacement waveforms were discussed, in order to evaluate if the
measured artery wall movements are consistent with the ones in literature. In Fig. 3, an
example of displacement waveform is reported.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this preliminary study, the authors have been tested on six subjects the possibility of
obtaining the pressure waveform from the integrated VCG signal, calibrated by means
of brachial diastolic and mean blood pressure values measured via oscillometric
method, using an exponential model [15].
The pressure values measured in the obtained waveforms have been compared with
the ones measured at brachial level. The obtained systolic differences are comparable to
the ones in literature (20%) [3] and express the physiological increase of systolic
pressure (Fig. 4) from the central to peripheral sites.
Moreover, the average measured displacement shows values physiologically cor-
rect [3], that is of hundreds of micrometers [16].
The use of LDV to measure the displacement of carotid artery allows to observe the
mechanical events related to hemodynamics with a very high sensitivity, but it involves
the contribution of reﬂection phenomena, which may be not related to the investigated
vessel.
A deeper investigation of the physiological dynamics is required in order to dis-
tinguish carotid features from the other mechanical events detected by LDV and to
obtain a more accurate pressure waveform.

Abstract. Falls in the elderly have been recognized worldwide as a major
public health problem. Nevertheless, falls cannot be detected efﬁciently yet, due
to open issues on both sensing and processing sides. The most promising
sensing approaches raise concerns for privacy issues (e.g., video-based
approaches) or low acceptability rate (e.g., wearable approaches); whereas on
the processing side, the commonly used methodologies are based on supervised
techniques trained with both positive (falls) and negative (ADL-Activity of
Daily Living) samples, both simulated by healthy young subjects. As a result of
such a training protocol, fall detectors inevitably exhibit lower performance
when used in real-world situations, in which monitored subjects are older adults.
The aim of this study is to investigate a fully privacy-preserving and
high-acceptance sensing technology, i.e. ultra-wideband radar sensor, together
with a novelty detection methodology based exclusively on real ADL data from
monitored elderly subject. The use of the UWB novelty detection methodology
allowed to signiﬁcantly improve detection performance in comparison to tra-
ditional supervised approaches.

Introduction
Nowadays, the most industrialized countries around the world are facing an
unprecedented aging of their population. The fastest growing age group is 65 years and
older which is expected to cover over a quarter of the population within the next four
decades [1].
This demographic phenomenon, also known as “aging society”, has a direct impact
on healthcare and elderly care sectors, as well as substantial ﬁnancial and social
implications. In particular, the depletion of healthcare resources is largely attributable
to age-related injuries, of which the large majority are associated with falls [2, 3]. In
fact, each year about one in three older adults aged 65 or more experiences at least a
fall, with serious injuries (e.g., from skeletal fracture to death) in 25% of cases [4, 5].
Among fall-related consequences the so-called “long lie” after a fall (for an hour or
more) is particularly critical because it has been associated with pneumonia, dehy-
dration, hypothermia, and high mortality rate (i.e., one in two seniors who reported a

long lie died within six months) [6]. In addition, long lies even after a non-injury fall
may contribute to the onset of “fear of falling” and social isolation.
In the scenario depicted above, automatic fall detection has become a very active
research area, aiming to substantially reduce the worst consequences of falls among the
elderly by automatically detecting and signalling the occurrence of a fall event in order
to ensure a prompt assistance to the fallen person.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 analyses the
state-of-the-art of fall detection solutions, highlighting related works based on radar
systems; Sect. 3 starts by giving some background information on the UWB radar
technology adopted in this study and, afterwards, describes the experimental setup and
collected data, then continues detailing the processing framework, and ﬁnally presents
the metrics used for performance evaluation; the achieved experimental results and
discussion are in Sect. 4; some conclusive remarks are, ﬁnally, provided in Sect. 5.

State-of-the-Art Analysis
The nowadays available fall detection solutions can be roughly subdivided into two
main categories, wearable-based and ambient-based solutions [7]. The most elementary
wearable device consists of a push-button worn and actuated by a senior in case of fall.
Obviously, such manually-actuated solutions cannot help in case of falls resulting in a
lack of conscience or upper extremity paralysis.
Wearable-based automatic fall detectors are based on small-sized devices worn by
the senior (usually embedded in garments, belts, etc.), equipped with sensor measuring
translational and rotational rates of body’s parts like torso and/or limbs, and able to
automatically send help requests in case of detected fall [8]. Normally, such devices use
MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer and compass sensors in
conjunction with some dedicated hardware for online processing and wireless radio
communication. Arguably the most stringent requirements they need to be able to
satisfy are minimum size and maximum battery life, which are conﬂicting requirements
that are very difﬁcult to meet in real-life applications. In addition, wearable approaches
have to deal with issues related to their usage (usability) and acceptance (acceptability)
by the user. In this regard, well-known issues are related with forgetting to wear (e.g.,
after having a bath) or to recharge, accidental damaging, wrong wearing position, and
refusing to wear (e.g., due to fear of stigma) [7].
Regarding the ambient-based category, these solutions are based on different kinds
of ambient-installed sensors which can be further classiﬁed as contact and contactless
solutions. In the ﬁrst case, pressure or contact vibration sensors are integrated on
surfaces hit by the person’s body during a fall, such as ﬂoor, carpet, bed, chair, and so
on [9]. Although the affordability of these sensors, ambient contact solutions require an
accurate design or redesign of the home environment making them quite expensive and
cumbersome.
In the second case, on the other hand, involved sensing approaches do not require
any kind of contact with the environment; the most investigated solutions are based on
audio, video and range sensing. Audio- and video-based systems use, respectively,
microphones and cameras in order to perform acoustic and visual scene analysis. Fall

detectors based on these approaches, especially video-based, are considered reasonably
reliable and affordable, although they raise many privacy concerns (e.g., recordings
may be accessed by unauthorized users) [7].
Range-based systems use sound or electromagnetic waves outside the human
perceptible spectrum. As sensing elements they can use SONAR (Sound Navigation
and Ranging), LIDAR/LADAR (Light Detection and Ranging), Range camera and
RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) sensors [10]. Their main strength lies in the
fact that, being active range systems, they are almost totally independent from envi-
ronmental conditions (e.g., surrounding sounds, lighting, electromagnetic ﬁelds).
Another important strength is that they work outside the human perceptible spectrum,
and thus their range data are not directly usable for obtaining privacy-sensitive
information.
Among all range systems mentioned above, the most promising and thoroughly
investigated are those based on range cameras and radars. Range camera systems are
able to provide, at high frame rates (e.g., up to 50 fps) and within a wide ﬁeld-of-view
(e.g., up to 70°), dense depth images of a scene suitable for real-time 3d visual analysis.
Several authors demonstrated the feasibility of using TOF (Time-Of-Flight) or SL
(Structured-Light) range cameras for accurately detecting falls [7]. Although the
richness of range data provided by TOF/SL cameras, nevertheless they are based on
(near-)infrared light waves and so are subject to occlusion problems which are par-
ticularly frequent in home environments. In addition, even if only depth data are used
(i.e., range cameras usually provide both range and intensity images), privacy concerns
are not fully resolved since the person’s silhouette is visible as well.
2.1
Related Works Using Radars
Radar-based systems present many interesting aspects for fall detection, and more
general for in-home health monitoring. In fact, they are able to penetrate obstacles so
that do not suffer from occlusion problems, and are conceived to deal with highly
cluttered and noisy environments. Furthermore, radar systems are much more
privacy-preserving than range cameras, since radar data are not directly usable for
obtaining any kind of privacy-sensitive information.
By using radar-based systems, various human activities, including falls, can be
effectively detected (e.g., high detection rates) via Doppler analysis of their motion
signatures. The radar systems adopted for this kind of analysis typically uses nar-
rowband waveforms, in order to achieve high Doppler resolution, especially in pres-
ence of fast-moving targets [10].
However,
ultra-wideband
(UWB)
systems,
and
particularly
Impulse-Radio
(IR) UWB ones, offer several advantages over narrowband systems, such as low
power spectral density (i.e., very difﬁcult to be intercepted, low interferences), short pulse
duration (i.e., high penetrating power, multipath immunity, high-speed short-range data
transmission), low cost and low power architecture (i.e., almost “all-digital”) [11]. For
that reasons, IR-UWB radar has emerged as a multi-purpose technology whose appli-
cation range spans from detection and measurement of vital signs to human
localization/tracking (also through walls), activity detection/classiﬁcation, and even

secure high-throughput wireless communication, just to name a few of its possible uses.
Although fall detection has also been demonstrated using UWB radar, nonetheless, to the
best of authors’ knowledge, these studies were based almost exclusively on
Stepped-Frequency Continuous-Wave (SFCW) systems, which do not offer the same
advantages as IR-UWB ones.
On the processing side, the methodologies commonly used for fall detection are
based either on threshold approaches or supervised machine learning techniques
tuned/trained with both positive (falls) and negative (ADL-Activity of Daily Living)
samples, both simulated by healthy young subjects. As a result, due to such a
tuning/training protocol, fall detectors inevitably exhibit lower performance when used
in real-world situations, in which monitored subjects are older adults [7]. The lack of
real-world fall data is an issue common to all fall detection studies, nevertheless only
few studies considered datasets collected from real falls of older adults. The number of
fall events included in such (not public yet) datasets, however, is low and the fall
mechanisms are not adequately documented.
In spite of this unresolved issue, very few attempts have been made to address the
fall-detection problem from the complementary point of view, that is, to train the
algorithms with only ADLs and then detect falls as novelties or anomalies. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, the studies that attempted to do so all used data provided by
accelerometer sensors embedded in smartphones [12, 13] or other wearable devices
[14], whereas there are no studies in the literature that used radar-based systems to
detect falls as novelties/anomalies.
3
Materials and Methods
The purpose of the study presented in this paper is to investigate the ability of
micro-Doppler features, obtained with a monostatic IR-UWB radar sensor, to represent
micro-movements involved during both ADLs and falls, in a way which is useful for
addressing the problem of detecting real-world falls by means of a novelty detection
methodology. All details about sensing, experimental setting, processing and perfor-
mance evaluation are provided in this section.
3.1
Ultra-Wideband Radar Sensing
The radar sensor adopted in this study is based on the monostatic sensor module P410
manufactured by Time Domain [15], which is connected via USB to an Embedded PC
(EPC). Both devices, P410 and EPC, are presented in Fig. 1. The P410 is a
state-of-the-art IR-UWB radar, working from 3.1 to 5.3 GHz centred at 4.3 GHz,
covering a distance range of about 30 m, having good object penetrating capabilities
and compact (7.6  8.0  1.6 cm) board dimensions. The P410 is equipped with an
omnidirectional antenna, which in this study has been modiﬁed by adding a planar back
reﬂector in order to reduce the azimuth pattern to around 100°. Range data from the
P410 are processed by the Embedded PC (EPC), which has low computational proﬁle
(i.e., Intel Atom processor based), low power consumption (25 W) and reduced
(13.2  9.5  3.7 cm) dimensions.

The EPC runs the processing algorithms, including (as better explained in the
following) pre-processing steps and machine learning, for detection of fall events in
real-time following a novelty discovering methodology.
3.2
Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition
The experiments were conducted in home-like setting, as pictorially represented in
Fig. 2. The P410 was accommodated at about one meter from the ﬂoor. For compar-
ison reasons, also a TOF range camera MESA SR4000 [16] was wall-mounted at the
height of about 2.40 m with respect the ﬂoor.
Both ADLs and falls were performed in a home-like setting by involving ten
healthy subjects divided into two age groups of avg. 24 and 48 years old, respectively.
Falls were simulated by following the protocol suggested by Noury et al. [17]. For each
participant, a total amount of 436 actions were collected, of which 30 were simulated
falls and the remaining were daily activities such as walking, sitting down, standing up,
and so on.

3.3
Processing Framework
On the algorithmic side, there are three main stages: pre-processing, feature extraction,
and event detection. Regarding the pre-processing stage, the scattered radar signal is
ﬁrst ﬁltered by a 16th-order Butterworth (bandpass 3.1–5.3 GHz) and then by a 3-tap
FIR motion ﬁlter in order to improve the signal-to-clutter ratio. The resulting range
proﬁles are normalized in amplitude and time within a sliding window of time length
1.5 s and distance range up to 8 m. The time duration of 1.5 s was experimentally
determined, as that able to discriminate both fast actions (e.g., falls) and slow ones
(e.g., voluntary lying down). Amplitudes and times-of-arrival (TOAs) are estimated by
peak analysis and tracked with Kalman ﬁlter in order to isolate the only target of
interest (i.e., the monitored subject). The pre-processed radar signal is shown in Fig. 3.
The extracted features are based on the micro-Doppler effect which is brieﬂy
introduced as follows. As well known, the relative motion between radar and target
introduces a Doppler frequency shift which relates directly to the radial velocity:
movements towards (away from) the radar introduce a positive (negative) frequency
shift. Furthermore, a human target consists of different parts (e.g., head, torso, legs,
etc.) which move at different velocities during the same action (e.g., walking, sitting,
etc.). The multiple Doppler shifts produced by these smaller motions are referred to as
micro-Doppler features. The feature extraction process starts by computing the Doppler
spectrogram which represents the signal power distribution over velocity (x-axis) and
distance (y-axis). In Fig. 4, the Doppler spectrograms of radar scans taken during a
simulated fall (Fig. 4a) and walking activity (Fig. 4b) are presented. As evident from
Fig. 4a, the spectrogram exhibits horizontally aligned peaks (micro-Doppler) related to
movements of body’s parts during the fall event. The Doppler spectrogram is computed
by applying the short-time Fourier transform to the analytic form of the radar signal.
Hence, the micro-Doppler features are extracted by convolving the spectrogram with a
Gaussian ﬁlter and summing the power spectrum at all distances for each frequency,
in order to obtain one-dimensional micro-Doppler signatures as those reported in
Fig. 4c, d associated with the simulated fall (Fig. 4a) and the walking activity
(Fig. 4b), respectively.

The event detection stage deals with the recognition of a fall occurrence from the
extracted features. The commonly used methodologies are based on supervised
machine learning techniques trained with both positive (falls) and negative (ADLs)
samples, both simulated by healthy young subjects. As a result, due to such a training
protocol, fall detectors inevitably exhibit lower performance when used in real-world
situations, in which monitored subjects are older adults [7]. In order to address this
problem and to improve fall detection performance under real-life conditions, an
unsupervised approach has been used in which the fall occurrence is detected as a
“novelty” with respect the usual daily activities performed by the monitored subject. In
the suggested unsupervised approach, novelties are detected using votes casted by
multiple one-class K-means classiﬁers [18]. For evaluation purpose, a classical
supervised detector based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) [19] has been also
experimented and its performance compared with the unsupervised one.
Furthermore, to have an additional term of comparison, TOF range data captured
with the SR4000 were processed using the fall detection approaches described in [20]
and the extracted features (i.e., the person’s centroid temporal trend) were classiﬁed
using SVM.

Performance Evaluation
The SVM-based supervised approach was evaluated with both P410 and SR4000 data.
More speciﬁcally, ADLs and falls performed by the young group were used for
training, whereas falls performed by the older group were used for testing. During the
training phase, 738 daily actions and 90 falls were used. During the testing phase,
instead, the remaining 492 daily actions and 60 falls were used.
Regarding the K-means-based unsupervised approach, since it is oriented to detect
falls as novelties among daily “normal” activities (e.g., walking, sitting down, standing
up, etc.), it has been validated involving the same subject in both observation and
testing phases. The observation phase lasted for about 95 min for each subject (i.e., 190
actions), after which the testing phase started and 30 falls/person were performed.
Fall detection performance was evaluated, according to Noury et al. [17], in terms
of sensitivity and speciﬁcity which are deﬁned as follows:
Sensitivity ¼ TP=ðTP þ FNÞ;
Specificity ¼ TN=ðTN þ FPÞ;
where TP, TN, FP, and FN are respectively the True Positives, True Negatives, False
Positives, and False Negatives.

Experimental Results and Discussion
As summarized in Table 1, the novelty-based unsupervised approach outperformed the
(UWB) supervised one without requiring any fall-based training, and thus more
reproducible in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, the novelty-based UWB performance
was comparable with that obtained using the more specialized TOF vision-based
sensing approach. However, it is worth noting that the unsupervised approach requires
a preliminary calibration phase during which almost all daily “normal” activities should
be observed and labelled as not-fall. In this study, such a calibration phase lasted
95 min per subject, but in real-world it may take much longer depending on habits of
monitored subject.

The use of the UWB novelty detection methodology allowed to signiﬁcantly
improve detection performance in comparison to the supervised one, exhibiting per-
formance comparable with that obtained using the more specialized TOF vision-based
sensing approach. The presented system may ﬁnd application for continuous indoor
monitoring of older adults living alone. In fact, after a period of observation (i.e.,
unsupervised training), the system can reliably detect fall events against daily activities.
The presence of moving objects (e.g., chairs, sofas, etc.) in the room does not interfere
with the event detection, since the Kalman ﬁlter allows tracking of peaks associated
with a human target in the radar signal.
Furthermore, it is worth to note that because of the high penetrating ability of the
UWB radar, the presence of medium-sized objects (e.g., tables, chairs, etc.) between
radar sensor and human target does not raise any occlusion problem. Instead, the most
serious noise source in indoor environments is the clutter signal containing reﬂections
from stationary structures (e.g., walls, furniture, etc.). In this study the clutter signal has
been strongly attenuated by motion ﬁltering the radar signal. However, this technique is
not quite effective for through-wall sensing, in which case more sophisticated clutter
removal techniques should be adopted.
As already mentioned, the system reliably detects falls when only one person is
present in the room (i.e., a living-alone elderly). When two or more people are present, on
the other hand, the system takes into account only the movement patterns of the person
nearest to the radar sensor, and thus it is able to detect only falls of the nearest subject.
Additionally, when two or more people stay at the same radial distance with respect to the
radar sensor, their motion patterns may interfere, affecting the detection performance.

Conclusion
The main contribution of this work concerns the investigation and validation, in a
home-like setting, of a fall detector based on IR-UWB radar sensor able to detect falls
as novelties. Moreover, the problem of performance under real-life conditions has been
addressed by suggesting an unsupervised approach not requiring fall-based training but
only a subject-speciﬁc calibration phase based on observation of daily activities. Pre-
liminary results are very encouraging, showing the effectiveness to achieve good
detection performance under real-life conditions through IR-UWB-based Doppler
analysis and novelty detection, which were not investigated together up to now.
The ongoing work is focused, on one hand, on extending the proposed system to
detect falls in multi-user scenarios (e.g., in community dwellings) by facing the
multi-target/multi-detection association problem. On the other hand, the future work is
to investigate the use the UWB radar sensor also for continuous and unobtrusive
in-home monitoring of vital parameters.

The Capacitive Humidity Sensor
A capacitive humidity sensor exploits a polymer as sensitive element (typically
Polyimide) whose dielectric constant varies with changes in humidity (RH), approxi-
mately linearly. This leads to a corresponding change in the capacitance (as a simple
rule, assuming a parallel-plate structure, the relation between the capacitance geometry
and the dielectric properties between is C ¼ e0erA=d). The sensor and temperature
control circuit are today frequently made through a single integrated chip [1–4].

What Is the Relation Between Relative Humidity
and Temperature?
Local variations of relative humidity can be obtained on the sensor through variations
of the temperature. The mathematical model is expressed in the following equation:

temperature of the sensor, it is possible to compare the measurements of the capaci-
tance (RH) of the sensor to the mathematical model given in Eq. (1). If the amount of
water in the air does not change (lH2O constant), the temperature variation produces a
variation in relative humidity.
Changing at local level (sensor) the temperature is relatively simple the Joule effect.
The humidity sensor, indeed, includes a of 250 Ω resistance that is used as a heater to
modify the temperature internally when current passing through it. Another resistance
with higher value (2.5 kΩ) allows us to read the corresponding temperature value
(using a suitable resistance-temperature conversion circuit). Regarding from Eq. (1), it
is clear that, if lH2O remains constant (the measurement takes place in a short time) the
temperature variation will dominate the relative humidity change.

Software Implementation for Temperature Control
The adjustment of the temperature values was produced by a PI controller, calibrated
according to an appropriate algorithm (Ziegler-Nichols rules). A voltage source is
connected to the integrated heater (resistance) to provide a certain current, while a
digital multi-meter is used to read the instantaneous values of the resistor (and hence
the temperature) of the sensor. The temperature of the sensor changes with the applied
voltage according to the values reported in Table 1. The step response of the system is
shown in Fig. 1. The capacitance of the sensor has been read out through a
“capacitance-to-digital converter”. The detected capacitance values are converted into
the corresponding relative humidity values according to the graph of initial calibration
of the sensor. The control loop is implemented in LabVIEW environment.

Circuit Implementation for Temperature Control
The temperature control loop shown in Fig. 3 is driven by a PI (proportional-Integral)
controller with parameters Kp ¼ 10, TI ¼ 1:04 s. Gain and integrator op-amp are
realized using switched-capacitor (SC) techniques, driven by two non-overlapped clock
phases: ɸ1 and ɸ2 with a frequency of 100 Hz. The integrator op-amp is followed by a
comparator whose output is connected to a power n-MOS featuring W = 1000 µm and
L = 0.4 µm which delivers the required current to Rheater.

The thermal coupling inside the sensor between Rheater and Rthermo resistors
has been modeled in VerilogA for transistor level system simulations. The ﬁrst
resistor has a terminal connected to the power n-MOS to regulate the temperature,
while the other terminal is connected to an external voltage supply which can vary 3.3
and 7 V depending on the range of temperature). The temperature signal from the
second resistor (2.5 kΩ) biased by a programmable current generator is converted into
a voltage and ampliﬁed by a factor of 10 by a ﬁrst SC stage. In particular, the bias
current of 800 µA is used with the bias voltage of 0 V in the range 24–27 °C, while
the bias current of 200 µA is used with 2 V bias voltage in the range 27–34 °C. For
higher temperatures, the current will go further down (e.g. 100 µA). The frequency of
the saw-tooth waveform applied to the inverting input of the comparator is 1 MHz
and the loop gain is 1000. The system was simulated in Cadence environment at
transistor level. The achieved accuracy is in order of 0.005 °C in a temperature range
of 50 °C.
Figure 4 shows the layout of the chip realized in 0.35 lm CMOS technology. The
chip area is 0.25 mm2 and 21 pins are used. It is expected in the future to have one
complete integrated chip for industrial applications.

From the Laboratory to Industrial Application
The results reported in this paper demonstrate that a change in relative humidity can be
actually achieved locally on the sensor by means of a temperature variation, using a
temperature control circuit implemented in CMOS technology.
There are many applications for temperature control in humidity sensors, ranging
from the simple heating of the sensor in order to eliminate condensation or accumu-
lation of water on the sensor, to the sensor self-diagnostic in order to identify damages.
Moreover, the temperature accuracy obtained with the integrated control circuit enables
the possibility of sensor self-calibration, strongly improving its performance and reli-
ability over time.

Abstract. A fully-analog integrated electronic interface for the detection and
measurement of differential capacitive position sensors is shown. The read-out
circuit, performing a differential capacitive to voltage conversion, has been
developed in a standard 0.35 lm CMOS technology with low-voltage/low-
power characteristics. The interface has shown a good accuracy, in particular the
relative percentage error is lower than 0.8% for the simulations of the integrated
solution. When compared to other solutions in the literature, sensitivity (S) and
resolution (res) data on a practical case-study of position sensor are satisfactory
so validating the architecture to be a good candidate as ﬁrst stage in analog
front-ends for differential capacitive sensor data measurements.

Introduction
The detection of very small quantities of physical, chemical and biological measurands
is typically employed through suitable sensors and related interfaces, developed either
with discrete elements or through integrated circuits in CMOS technology. Electronic
front-ends are particularly important for a suitable reading of the measurand [1–5].
When the measurand variation is converted into a capacitance, the sensor is named
capacitive sensor and this capacitive change can be converted into a more easily
electrical quantity. Capacitive sensors are employed in different modern applications,
such as in detecting position, displacement, acceleration, ﬂuid level [6–12].
Differential (or ratiometric) capacitive sensors constitute a particular case of
these kinds of transducers. They have suitable applications in hair ﬂow motion,
accelerometers, position or rotation detection, force, etc. [13–18].
Figure 1 shows a typical differential capacitive structure: two capacitors in series
are formed by two ﬁxed electrodes (conductive plates) and one, movable in the middle,
which changes its position from nominal one owing to sensing effect. The variations in
the two series capacitances are of complementary kind.

The electronic front-end has the task to measure and amplify the (differential)
capacitive change detected by the sensor. The employment of a differential capacitive
structure helps to reduce resolution problems related to low capacitive variations and
common mode disturbs. In the literature, a differential capacitive sensing is performed
in different ways: capacitance-to-frequency conversion, capacitance-to-phase conver-
sion, switched-capacitor analog-to-digital technique, current-integrating threshold
detection based technique [19–21]. Other interfaces utilize transimpedance or charge
ampliﬁers, performing a capacitance-to-voltage conversion in continuous time [22].
In this paper we give evidence to the interface design of differential capacitive
sensors. Recently, in [23], the authors have proposed for the ﬁrst time a fully-analog
front-end performing differential capacitance measurements through the reading of a
voltage. In this paper, a development in the output reading of this interface as well as
novel simulations on a different application are presented also for the integrated design
of the active blocks.

The development of the read-out circuitry for differential capacitive sensors is an
important challenge, except if the classical capacitive AC bridge is considered. This
analogue interface gives a differential output voltage proportional to x variable only for
low values of x, according to the factor VIN/2. In order to increase this factor, we have
recently proposed an analog interface [23], based on the cascade of an integrator and a
differentiator containing the capacitive differential sensor. We here propose a devel-
opment in the output reading of this interface as well as novel simulations on a different
application. The read-out circuit is shown in Fig. 2 as block scheme and in Fig. 3 at
component level.
Beside the integrator/differentiator conﬁgurations, an additional circuitry (com-
parator, voltage divider) automatically generates a square-wave signal. The peak
detector has been employed to give the DC level of the maximum output voltage.
A digital data acquisition system (formed by an ADC [24] and a microcontroller) has
been implemented establishing a communication by using a Tx/Rx structure. The
utilized microcontroller is an ATMEGA328P from Atmel that integrates a 8 bit ADC
whereas the radio link is established by a low power commercial transceiver (NFC21)
with on board integrated antenna. Two dedicated boards have been externally con-
nected and tested. The interconnection with the designed interface has been performed
by on board mounted wires.
Concerning the ampliﬁer block, the circuit in Fig. 3 has been designed in an
integrated version in a standard CMOS technology, suitable for portable applications.
A straightforward analysis gives the following equation for the output voltage value:

being Vk a constant value (in Volt), given by (R4*VDD,SAT)/R3, where VDD,SAT is the

Starting from parallel plate capacitor model, we can consider the distance variation

In particular, in (4), we consider a possible capacitive variation Dd, related to a

becomes:

OTA Design for CMOS Integrated Solution
We have suitably designed an integrated version of the proposed interface, at transistor
level, in a standard CMOS technology (AMS 0.35 lm), through the development of
Operational Transconductance Ampliﬁers (OTAs) as active blocks, having the same
internal topology and transistors (reported in Fig. 4). The application of analog
microelectronic design techniques has allowed to obtain good low-voltage (±1.65 V)
low-power (<5 mW) OTA performances, whereas a meticulous attention has been paid
to obtain good Slew-rate (SR) and input voltage offset characteristics. Passive com-
ponents are employed on-chip, so the circuit is suitable for very compact applications.
The OTA shown in Fig. 4 has two stages: a symmetrical OTA as input stage
(M1–M9), chosen for its low systematic offset and a cascoded class-AB output stage
(M10–M13) ensuring full dynamic output range.
In the input stage, the choice of p-MOS input transistors, for the ﬁrst stage (i.e., M1–
M2), guarantees a reduced low-frequency noise level ensured also by a proper layout
design. Considering ideal matched conditions between the transistor couples M1–M2,

being B the ratio between (W/L)5 and (W/L)3, equal to that between (W/L)6 and (W/L)4.
The OTA output stage is a class-AB inverter ampliﬁer, in a push–pull conﬁguration
with source degenerations, which guarantees a further voltage gain, a better output
dynamic range, a better control of the output current and a high output impedance.
This stage has been properly frequency-compensated through the use of Rm and
Cm passive elements and transistor M14 implementing the pole splitting and the zero
cancellation. The OTA output impedance, evaluated at VOUT node, and the voltage gain
of the output stage can be expressed as follows, respectively:

The total open loop DC voltage gain of the designed OTA is simply obtained by the
multiplication of (8) and (10) gains. A supply-independent current source allows to
obtain a high SR value, through the injection of a biasing current independent both
from supply voltage variation (e.g. battery discharge) up to relatively high variations
respect to the nominal value (higher than ±10%), and from temperature drifts of the
whole OTA. This current reference is completed by a “start-up” circuit [25], which
allows to operate in the correct non-zero working point. The complete current generator
for OTA biasing is formed by transistors Mb1–Mb4 and resistance Rb, and the start-up
circuit (Mb5–Mb7). Table 1 reports the OTA main parameter values obtained with
simulations.
The following values have been considered for the passive components employed
in the integrated version of the interface: C0 = 10 pF (variation = ±50%), R1 = R2 =
R5 = R6 = 100 kX, R4 = 680 kX, R3 = 150 kX, C3 = 1 pF.

Results
Theoretical and simulated output voltage results are shown in Fig. 5. The output range
has been optimized, for the x variation, in the most part of the supply range.

As shown in Fig. 6, the relative error, deﬁned as in [25], is always lower, in
absolute value, than 0.8%, so the proposed interface shows a good accuracy.
We have considered two basic parameters in sensors and interfaces that are sen-
sitivity and resolution [25]. Sensitivity (S) is deﬁned as the ratio between output
parameter (in this case, output voltage) and the measurand. Then, from (6) sensitivity is

Conclusions
We have presented an analog interface for the detection and quantiﬁcation of differ-
ential capacitive sensors. Waiting for the integrated interface fabrication, simulations
on the designed CMOS integrated OTA-based interface have been performed. They
have a good agreement with the theoretical expectations. Sensitivity and resolution
have been determined in a practical case, showing satisfactory values. This sensor
interface could be applied to a wide range of application such as measurement of
displacement, distance and position. In particular, the proposed circuit is suitable for
those applications requiring precision positioning, such as in lithography.

Abstract. Two electronic interfaces performing a differential (or ratiometric)
sensor capacitance to voltage conversion are here presented. The output signal is
proportional to the measurand variation x. The two read-out circuits differ
themselves in their input stage: the ﬁrst has an input current-to-voltage con-
version, while the second one employs an input voltage source. Both of the
solutions utilize commercial second generation current conveyors (CCIIs) as
active blocks, in particular AD844. Theoretical analysis, simulated and exper-
imental results have shown a good accuracy. Considering a capacitance varia-
tion due to the relative distance change, interface sensitivity (S) and resolution
(res) values are constant and satisfactory: for the ﬁrst solution, S = 8.54 V/lm
and res = 674 pm (capacitance resolution value is 89.85 fF, that is −79 dB),
while, for the second one, S = 8.13 V/lm and res = 814 pm (capacitance res-
olution value is 108.5 fF, that is −77 dB).

Introduction
Capacitive sensors are solid-state devices that reveal and quantify variations of phys-
ical, chemical or biological parameters the change of a capacitor. They are typically
formed by two metal parallel plates separated by an insulator layer [1] and can be
employed in applications as accelerometers [2], position sensors [3], pressure sensors
[4] etc., where capacitance values can range from less than 1 pF up to hundreds of pF
or even to nF. Their interfaces are based on the conversion of the capacitive value and
variation into a voltage, a frequency (or period), a phase, etc. [5–7].
Differential (or ratiometric) sensors are a sub-set of these capacitive sensors
employed to reduce resolution problems related to low capacitive variations and
common mode disturbs. They have suitable applications in hair ﬂow motion,
accelerometers, position or rotation detection, force, etc. Figure 1 shows a simple
schematization of a ratiometric capacitive sensor consisting in a three plates capacitive
system with two ﬁxed plates. The simplest differential sensing element is the capacitive

AC half-bridge where two capacitors change their value in a complementary way under
a stimulus; unfortunately, this topology shows a reduced and not constant sensitivity.
In the literature, some analog interfaces for the ratiometric capacitive sensing have
been proposed, based mainly on operational ampliﬁers [7–11], while current-mode
interfaces are typically related to other sensor interfaces [12–17]. In this paper we
propose two current conveyor-based interfaces performing a capacitive-to-voltage
conversion, showing good and constant values of sensitivity and resolution.

The second interface here proposed (Fig. 3) shows an input stage employing a
CCII-based voltage-to-current converter [12]; in this manner, the voltage input signal
can be more easily injected through a standard laboratory waveform generator.

Results
For experimental measurements we have employed AD844 component as CCII+, while
CCII−is implemented through a cascade of two AD844 devices [12]. The following
nominal values have been considered: working frequency = 10 kHz and RL = 60 kX;
concerning the input signal amplitude, we chose IIN,pp = 1 mA for the ﬁrst interface
and VIN,pp = 1 V, R1 = 1 kX for the second one. Furthermore, having considered
AD844 parasitic components at the working frequency (RX = 50 X, RZ = 3 MX), we
have obtained R1′ = 1.05 kX and RL′ = 57.629 kX. We have considered a ratiometric
capacitance sensing application, having a base-line value CO of 800 pF and a 10%
maximum relative variation (x). The transducer behavior has been emulated, in the
experimental phase, by two capacitors. The value of C3 has been set to 100 pF.
Starting from parallel plate capacitor model, we considered a possible capacitive
variation related to a change in the initial distance between the capacitor plates, do:

Concerning the ﬁrst solution (shown in Fig. 2), we have performed only simula-
tions that have been compared with the theory. Figure 4 shows the theoretical and

simulated output voltages versus x parameter. The output range has been optimized, for
the considered x variation, in the most part of the supply range. The relative percentage
error is always lower, in absolute value, than 0.1%, so the proposed interface shows a
good accuracy.
Having considered a MEMS application (d0 = 3 lm), the sensitivity is constant and
valued about S = 8.54 V/lm. Sensitivity deﬁnition has been expressed according to [17].
Having evaluated a 576 nV output voltage noise, we have a resolution in terms of distance
variation of about 674 pm, i.e., as capacitive value, of 89.85 fF (that is about −79 dB).
Concerning the second solution (Fig. 3), Fig. 5 shows the output voltage versus the
measurand x. Theoretical, simulated (through Orcad-Spice software) and experimental
results (averaged on 10 different measurements) are in a good agreement. Uncertainty
on the experimental data has been expressed through the standard deviation: it is lower
than 0.025 for the whole measurements. The relative percentage error has been cal-
culated for the averaged experimental data is lower than 0.2% between simulations and
theory and than 3% between theory and measurements.
Then, having considered d0 = 3 lm, sensitivity value for the second interface is
constant and valued about 8.13 V/lm. Having evaluated a 662 nV output voltage noise,
we have a resolution of about 814 pm for the above mentioned case. This spatial
resolution value corresponds to a capacitance resolution of 108.5 fF (that is about
−77 dB). A suitable ADC [18] has been utilized for better reading of the output voltage.
A comparison of the main characteristics of the presented interfaces, with respect to
those reported in the literature, is here presented in Table 1. We underline the fact that
the works reported in [6, 10] are related to a single ended capacitive sensor (despite the
second one is showing a differential output and its approach is also applicable to
ratiometric sensors). The here proposed circuits show better values of sensitivity and
resolution (in dB), also being constant for each operating point.

Conclusions
We have shown two novel current-mode analog interfaces for revealing and measuring
ratiometric capacitive sensors. Experimental measurements have been performed on a
discrete element board, employed through a commercial CCII (AD844). Both of our
proposed architectures have shown a good agreement with the theoretical expectations.
Sensitivity and resolution (showing constant values for each considered working point)
have been determined in a practical case, showing satisfactory values.

Abstract. We here present an energy harvesting system for low power sensor
applications. The system is a dual band architecture able to capture the largest
amount of EM radiation available in the urban environment and to provide an
autonomous device potentially with inﬁnitive cycle of use. The device is tuned
to receive both GSM and Wi-Fi frequencies and a power battery loading cir-
cuitry is available on board to guarantee the required energy for the autonomous
sensor to work. The whole system, designed using a discrete board, has been
also conceived in order to be completely integrated in a standard CMOS
technology.

Introduction
Gathering energy from ambient environment and converting it into an usable electrical
energy is an innovative and appealing way to feed small, wireless and autonomous
devices commonly used in wearable electronics or in Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN) systems [1–7]. Good performances with longevity constrain for the recovering
of environmental energy system is mandatory, even if the latter are intrinsically not
constant either in time or concerning their input power [8–13]. An appropriate har-
vesting design can lead to this goal and can actually represent a new frontier in the
development of energy optimization techniques, which started from low power design
and evolved into power-aware design methods for circuit and systems for any kind of
application [14–32]. In this perspective, although the interest in WSN research is
increasing, several fundamental issues remain unsolved and, among them, some are
very important in sight of the long-term operation of the systems. In any case, whatever
would be the constraints under investigation, the desire for a long system lifetime is
always a common goal. We here describe a system for energy harvesting with the aim
to capture the largest amount of EM radiation in the urban environment. It is based on a
dual band architecture and handles both GSM and Wi-Fi signals with a high energy
conversion efﬁciency in the full band and speciﬁcally onto the two working frequen-
cies, pointed to 936 MHz and 2.4 GHz, so to catch the largest amount of EM radiation
available in the surroundings. Deﬁning the harvester efﬁciency as the ratio between the
rectiﬁed power and the input one, the proposed circuit shows an efﬁciency greater than
50% for an incoming power between −5 and 15 dBm thanks to a suitable design both

of the networks and the control system. A prototype board has been fabricated and
tested and experimental results are also herewith shown.

Architecture Overview
The harvester block scheme is described in Fig. 1. It is composed by two energy
conversion channels (named “Low Power” and “Medium Power”) designed to manage
different power levels at both the reference frequencies and to collect the recovered
energy into a common regulation and storage section. The “Low Power” channel is set
as the default path. According to the incoming power level and comparing the rectiﬁed
voltage with a reference voltage threshold, the ultralow power voltage comparator
selects afterwards the suitable channel of the receiver to proper handle the EM radi-
ation. The “Low Power” channel deals with power ranging from −20 to 5 dBm while
the “Medium Power” one relates to power levels ranging from 5 to 20 dBm. The
subsequent regulation and storage section consists of an ultralow voltage Step-Up
Converter, that boosts the input voltage and decouples the harvester from the storage
and load section. Finally, a common load is used for further utilizations.
The harvester has been designed and optimized for its simultaneous operation at
mobile GSM transmissions (936 MHz) and Wi-Fi broadcasting connections (2.4 GHz).
The harvester indeed is able to support the whole system in a “long-life” use of the
system where it is used and directly answers the growing demand for sensors which
need to be integrated into either batteries (that become, in our case, rechargeable) or
totally self-powered wireless systems.

Prototype Device Details and Measurements
We here deﬁne the system efﬁciency as the ratio between the total amount of power
delivered to the load and the amount of power that the receiving antenna could inject in
a perfectly matched circuit. The schematic of the standalone rectiﬁers is shown in
Fig. 2a, as they have been implemented into the prototype board used for test mea-
surements (Fig. 2b).

The low power signal handling is achieved with a Schottky diode, characterized by
a very low threshold voltage. The chosen device is HSMS2850 provided by Avago
Technologies: it is a zero bias detector, series-mounted and able to provide high
sensitivity to the circuit response. Our tests have demonstrated that the designed “Low
Power” circuit is very performing for low power levels, between −20 dBm and about
5 dBm, while working at higher power levels the performance drops because the
rectiﬁed power transfer loses its incremental growth and changes slope tending to a
constant limited value. This is because of the diode characteristics, not performing well
for relatively high voltages. This consideration justiﬁes the use “Medium Power”
channel, suggesting the need to use a more complex conﬁguration. The “Medium
Power” channel implements, in fact, a voltage multiplier designed with two detector
diodes HSMS2865, always provided by Avago. Test measurements (Fig. 3) conﬁrmed
all the theoretical results, showing that the output power got its maximum values for
input levels, located at the two main frequencies of 936 MHz (GSM band) and
2.4 GHz (WiFi).
Generally we have got an efﬁciency greater than 50% for an incoming power
between −5 and 15 dBm that decreases outside this range even though it remains high
due to the a suitable design of the matching networks and of the control system.
Figure 1 block parts have been fabricated in preliminary printed circuit boards in order
to allow standalone functionality tests (Fig. 4) and assembled in our laboratory with a
commercial multiband antenna, furnished by TAOGLAS, named TG.31.8112W.
Experimental measurements on the full system have been performed considering
free sources provided by commercial devices as a mobile GMS phone and a Wi-Fi
router. The sources have been considered both separately (one feeder per time) and
simultaneously by feeding the harvester at different distances, so conﬁrming the the-
oretical expectations.

Conclusions
A dual band architecture for high conversion efﬁciency energy harvesting system has
been here proposed. The harvester can simultaneously operate at two main frequencies,
936 MHz and 2.4 GHz and the experimental results have conﬁrmed that the energy
harvester ﬁnal architecture can be easily interconnected with low power sensors for
either recharging or powering purposes, to get a real “life-long autonomous” cycle of
employment of the system.

Abstract. The present work focuses its attention on the deﬁnition of a home
automation system based on power line communication. A low cost and non
invasive system has been developed and tested with successful results. It is
based on the Cypress CY8CPLC10, an integrated power line communication
chip which embeds both a PHY modem and a network protocol stack. The
information management and data generation processes are demanded to a
microcontroller, in this ﬁrst prototype, being implemented with a standard
Arduino board. Combining the use of a microcontroller with a power line
modem makes possible to manage sensors and actuators in the neighbors
through the power grid and without modifying the electrical and network

Introduction
Nowadays, electricity is the main resource for both human wellness and productivity.
In this sense, home and urban automation are beneﬁting of great efforts from the
designers with the dual aims of improving the quality of live and preserving the natural
resources. Also communication systems are widely increasing themselves thanks to a
variety of interests, from safety to information purposes. In this scenario, the mix of
different skills and knowledge is straightforward and leads to the deﬁnition of inno-
vative applications [1–10] and systems for human wellness [11–22]. Home automation
systems are enhancing the convenience, safety, comfort, and energy efﬁciency of a
growing number of homes around the world. Smart homes are realized by means of
sensors, advanced appliances, actuators and user interfaces that communicate by means
of interconnections. Usually, they are realized with dedicated, physical networks or by
means of RF and wireless links. Anyway, both the solutions experiment some draw-
backs that rely on the necessity to modify or expand the electrical system for wiring
solutions or to occupy useful bandwidth in the local wireless network. In this scenario,
the solution here presented and based on power line communications represents an
adequate and feasible alternative to realize efﬁcient and non-invasive automation
systems. In particular, the proposed solution embeds different key points valuable for

home applications and environmental monitoring, allowing to achieve the following
characteristics:
– Simplicity
– Ease of installation
– Reliability
– Robustness.
The system has been developed and tested with successful results. It is based on a
microcontroller and the Cypress CY8CPLC10, an integrated power line communica-
tion chip which embeds both a PHY modem and a network protocol stack, allowing a
robust communication between different nodes. Combining the use of a microcontroller
with a power line modem makes possible to manage sensors and actuators in any place
in the neighbors through the power grid and without modifying the electrical and
network systems. In addition, the choice of the Cypress chip gives further advantages
in terms of available features, since it allows a bidirectional half duplex communica-
tion, FSK modulation and errors correction codes. All these characteristics improve the
overall quality of the system permitting robust communications also on old electrical
systems.

Hardware Architecture
The architecture of the proposed power line module is showed in Fig. 1. The electrical
grid is used for by-directional communications between different nodes, which in home
environment can represent control units, user devices or appliances. The overall
functionality is guaranteed by the use of a microcontroller combined with the com-
munication chip. The microcontroller interprets the user requests and generates the
corresponding message to transmit. The information reaches the powerline device
through an I2C serial bus and the Cypress CY8CPLC10 [23] is responsible of the data

transmission, since it embeds both a network protocol and an FSK modem. The main
characteristics of the chosen device are listed below:
– PHY Modem
– 2400 bps Frequency Shift Keying modulation
– Optimized powerline network protocol
– Half-Duplex bi-directional communication
– 8-bit CRC Error Detection code
– I2C communication protocol at 50, 100 and 400 kHz
– Full compatibility with 110–240 V AC and 12–24 V AC/DC network voltages
– Fulﬁllment of CENELEC EN50065-1:2001 and FCC Part 15 rules.
The receiver node demodulates the network signal in the reverse way and transfers
the information to the control unit in order to perform the requested action.
In this ﬁrst prototype, a standard Arduino board with ATMEGA microcontroller
has been used and programmed accordingly; the choice has been useful also for testing
purposes, since keeping advantage of the features provided by Arduino, the system has
been tested in different working modes, both as data link and as communication
channel.
A typical scheme of a home automation utility is illustrated in Fig. 2. The proposed
communication system shown in Fig. 1 has been completed and enhanced with a
designed Bluetooth module and an actuator combined with a generic load. Thanks to
the Bluetooth module, the full system can be controlled and monitored with any
Bluetooth application, as for instance, the “Arduino Bluetooth Control Developer”
freely available for Android devices. In this way, a smartphone or tablet can be enough
to check and change the status of any appliance connected to a power line node.

In addition, a front-end to be used between the power line chip and the electrical
network is also necessary and has been designed for ﬁltering and amplifying the
generated signal, in compliance with the CENELEC and FCC standards. The trans-
mitter ﬁlter is a pass-band network realized in the Chebyshev topology with operational
ampliﬁers and it shows a centre frequency of 133 kHz. It has a gain of 16.5 dB with an
in-band delta gain of 1.5 dB and an out-of-band attenuation that allows to obtain
−20 dBc at 150 kHz and −50 dBc at second harmonic. The transmission chain ends
with a further op-amp-based ampliﬁcation stage that provides an additional gain of
12 dB and is designed with a push-pull output stage, useful to drive the low-impedance
loads of the power line. The receiver chain instead, has an input, pass-band ﬁlter
realized in the Butterworth topology, with an insertion loss of 1 dB and a 3 dB
bandwidth of 60 kHz.

Prototype and Test
The hardware architecture described above has been implemented and tested in home
environment. The TX/RX module, which embeds the selected Cypress device, the
Bluetooth module and the signal conditioning circuitry, has been realized as a stan-
dalone board and a photo of the top side of the prototype is shown in Fig. 3.
The socket strip in the lower side of the pcb allows to connect the board to both the
Arduino board and the electrical grid. The full connection scheme of the test system is
illustrated in the next Fig. 4. Clearly, the Atmega microcontroller on the Arduino board
has been programmed accordingly in order to provide the full functionality of the
system. In this application, the breadboard prototyping board has been used for testing
purposes to check the node features and the transmission modes. Also the actuator and
a typical appliance or user device have been simulated on the breadboard with a generic
load and a led diode.

As an example of application, in Fig. 5 is plotted a transmission signal measured
with an oscilloscope. The electrical grid signal is simulated with a sinusoidal signal at
the frequency of 50 Hz and a 12 V peak-to-peak amplitude. This carrier is used to

transport the information through an FSK modulation and the modulated signal is
superimposed to it.
It is important to note that both the generation of information and data conversion
of the communication signals have been demanded to the microcontroller and have
required the development of dedicated algorithms and code in order to correctly
interpret the used needs and aims.
A comparison of the main characteristics of the proposed solutions with respect to
other literary solutions is reported in Table 1. Further beneﬁts both in term of per-
formance and integrability can be achieved with the introduction of advanced circuitry
solutions for data manipulation and transmission both in voltage and current mode [24–
38] and an improved solution is currently under design.

Conclusions
The paper deals on the design of a new home automation system based on power line
communication systems. The Cypress CY8CPLC10 and a microcontroller have been
used to realized a low cost and non invasive solution for home environment and it has
been tested with successfully results. Beyond the cost, the potentialities of the proposed
solution rely on the capability to cover high transmission range and good data rate,
offering a robust transmission system through the power grid also on old electrical
systems and without modifying them.

Abstract. Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) are
MEMS transducers fabricated on silicon that have reached technological matu-
rity, representing today a valid alternative to piezoelectric transducers in medical
ultrasound imaging applications, offering larger bandwidth and better thermal
efﬁciency. The growing interest for this new technology is based in the increased
compatibility with 3D electronics integration methods that allow integrating, on
the same chip, the transducers and the electronics, thereby enabling the realization
of high-performance and low-cost devices. This paper summarizes the research
activity carried out at the Acoustoelectronics Laboratory (ACULAB) of Roma
Tre University on the integration of CMUTs and analog front-end electronics in
ultrasound medical imaging probes for volumetric imaging applications.

Introduction
Micromachined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs) [1] are emerging as a valid alternative
for next generation ultrasound imaging systems. MEMS technology employed for
MUT microfabrication provides higher ﬂexibility in the design and improved repro-
ducibility as compared to conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer technology.
These characteristics, together with an easier integration with front-end electronic
circuits, make MUTs attractive for the realization of advanced imaging systems such as
volumetric real-time ultrasound scanners.
The Acoustoelectronics Laboratory (ACULAB, Roma Tre University, Italy)
research is focused on capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) and
includes design, modeling, microfabrication, interconnection and packaging materials,
characterization, electronics and system integration [2–4]. Signiﬁcant results have been
obtained in the development of CMUT probes for medical ultrasound imaging and
biometric applications [5–9]. In the last years, ACULAB’s research was devoted to
advanced ultrasound imaging applications [10], and particular effort has been dedicated
to the integration of CMUTs and front-end electronics. A fully-integrated, low-power
analog front-end circuit, consisting in a high-voltage unipolar pulser and a low-power

transimpedance low-noise ampliﬁer, was speciﬁcally designed for 1D CMUT arrays
operating in the 1–15 MHz range [11, 12] covering a wide range of imaging appli-
cations. Further, a novel method for the compensation of CMUT harmonic distortion
was proposed and implemented in a 200 V unipolar pulser integrated circuit [13]
demonstrating a reduction of the second-harmonic distortion of more than 30 dB,
meeting typical requirements of nonlinear medical imaging applications. Current
research at ACULAB is devoted to the development of a 256-element 2D CMUT probe
based on a Fermat’s spiral sparse array conﬁguration [14]. The new CMUT probe head
is achieved by hybrid 3D-integration of a CMUT spiral array and a 256-channel analog
front-end ASIC, based on the previously developed pulser and receive topologies. This
paper summarizes the activities carried out on these research topics, the ongoing
developments, and the expected results.

Analog Front-End Integrated Electronics
In [11, 12], we reported on the development of a fully-integrated, low-power analog
front-end circuit, which consisted in a high-voltage unipolar pulser and a low-noise
charge ampliﬁer, speciﬁcally designed for 1D CMUT arrays operating in the 1–15 MHz
range. The proposed circuit comprised a high-voltage unipolar driver, a transmit/receive
(T/R) switch, and an ultra-low-noise charge ampliﬁer (LNA), which were conveniently
co-designed in order to minimize the power consumption and the parasitic capacitance.
The high-voltage drivers allowed us to generate unipolar pulses up to 100 V amplitude.
The T/R switch was carefully designed to achieve protection of the LNA input during
transmission while keeping the parasitic resistance low during reception. The LNA is
based on a transimpedance topology using a capacitive feedback, providing large
bandwidth and improved noise-power performance as compared to resistive feedback
topologies. ASIC prototypes, based on the circuit schematic shown in Fig. 1, were
designed in collaboration with the Analog Integrated Circuits Laboratory (Department
of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy), and
fabricated using a BCD-SOI technology available at STMicroelectronics (Cornaredo,
Italy). Experimental characterization was carried out in conjunction with a 10 MHz
CMUT linear array, previously developed for medical imaging applications [8].

at
pre-compensating the second harmonic distortion using unipolar excitation pulses. The
method consists in applying signal predistortion by acting on the amplitude, duty cycle,
and slope of the rising and falling edges, of the trapezoidal excitation pulses. We
determined the pulse-shaping parameters using an open-loop charge control algorithm
that uses electrical impedance data, estimated at several bias voltages, to identify the
CMUT non-linear behavior. A 0–200 V unipolar pulser circuit, based on the topology
shown in Fig. 2, consisting in a digitally-controlled current generator yielding trape-
zoidal pulse-shaping capability when connected to a capacitive load, was designed in
collaboration with the Analog Integrated Circuits Laboratory (Department of Electrical,
Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy), and fabricated

using a BCD-SOI technology available at STMicroelectronics. The pulser was tested
with a 10 MHz CMUT linear array developed for medical imaging applications [8].
First transmit pressure measurements were performed proving a second-harmonic
reduction of more than 20 dB, resulting in a harmonic-to-fundamental ratio
(HFR) below −30 dB, which makes the use of such conﬁguration suitable for typical
nonlinear imaging operation. We here report additional experimental results achieved
by optimizing the CMUT nonlinear parameter extraction. We measured the acoustic
pressure signal at 4.6 mm from the transducer surface, by exciting the CMUT with a
10 MHz, 20-cycle, 100 V trapezoidal pulse train. The excitation signal was generated
by programming the pulser using the parameters achieved with the predistortion

algorithm, fed with a set of electrical impedance measurements performed on the
CMUT at different bias voltages in the 140–240 V range. Figure 3 shows the measured
hydrophone signal. The negative peak pressure amplitude is 400 kPa, while the HFR is
approximately −45 dB. The measured performance is fully compatible with nonlinear
ultrasound imaging applications.
An updated version of the CMUT transceiver, characterized by the same topology
presented in [11, 12], but provided with the transmission driver proposed in [13], is
currently under implementation on a 256-element ASIC with transmit beamforming
capability. This ASIC is part of the 3D-integrated hybrid multi-chip-module (MCM),
described in the following section, based on a sparse 2D CMUT array conﬁguration.

CMUT Array Design, Microfabrication and Packaging
of the 3D-Integrated Module
In order to reduce the complexity related to the high element and channel count
typically required by volumetric imaging applications, we investigated [14], in col-
laboration with the Microelectronic System Design Laboratory (MSDLab, Information
Engineering Department, University of Florence, Italy), the possibility of designing the
layout of large circular arrays with limited number of elements according to particular
sparse spatial distributions. We proposed to use the Fermat’s spiral pattern with spatial
density modulation. This deterministic, aperiodic, and balanced positioning procedure
aims at guaranteeing uniform performance over a wide range of steering angles. We
showed that this approach allows increasing the probe sensitivity while simplifying the
design of the transmit section, which does not involve element dependent amplitude

control. We compared the performance of several 256-element sparse array conﬁgu-
rations, testing different spatial density modulation functions, and found that a good
trade-off is achieved by a 60k spiral array with 1.0k elements and Blackman density
tapering window. With this conﬁguration, the grating lobe level is −16 dB, the lateral
resolution is lower than 6.0k, the depth of ﬁeld is 120k and, the average contrast is
10.3 dB, while the sensitivity remains in a 5 dB range for a wide selection of steering
angles. Compared with a dense array conﬁguration yielding the equivalent performance
in terms of acoustic beam characteristics, the number of elements is reduced by a 8.3
factor (i.e. 256 vs. 2136).
A physical implementation of this spiral array conﬁguration is currently under
development using the CMUT Reverse Fabrication Process (RFP) [3]. The array was
dimensioned considering an operation frequency of 7.5 MHz. The single element size
is 200 µm (1.0k), whilst the array size is 10 mm (50k). A Blackman window was used
as a density tapering function. Figure 4 shows the physical layout of the spiral array
under development, consisting of 256 elements each composed of 12 CMUT circular
cells arranged in a hexagonal tiling and electrically connected in parallel.
We have established a 3D-integration process whose goal is to bond two dice,
containing respectively a MEMS (CMUT) array and an ASIC (multichannel AFE). The
shape of the two dice is square being their size different. In particular, the smaller ASIC
die, containing the 256-channel AFE circuits and the transmit beamforming digital
logic, is connected to the MEMS die using ﬂip-chip bonding, while the larger MEMS
die, containing the 256-element CMUT spiral array, is used also to connect the ﬁnal
hybrid MCM to the external circuits using wire bonding. We follow a die-to-die (ASIC
die on MEMS) bonding approach using Cu-pillar + SnAg solder bumping on the
ASIC, and pre-applied epoxy-based underﬁll on the MEMS, being this procedure
compatible with wafer-level packaging, which is our future objective. With reference to

Fig. 5, the MEMS die (a) contains the 2D CMUT array in the central part. Each CMUT
array element, depicted as a red circle, is accessible through a circular pad, shown as a
blue circle. A further set of circular pads, of the same shape and size of the element
pads, are linearly disposed along a square perimeter surrounding the CMUT array area.
The pads laying on the square perimeter are individually routed to larger pads, shown
as green rectangles, laying close to the edges of the MEMS die. Figure 5b shows the
ASIC die in which a number of circular pads, shown in blue, is arranged in order to
symmetrically match the positions of all of the circular pads on the MEMS die (a). The
two dice are aligned and electrically bonded, through solder-reﬂow-based intercon-
nection,

The obtained hybrid module is then processed following the CMUT RFP [3]. With
reference to Fig. 6, the MCM is aligned and wire bonded to a rigid-ﬂex PCB using a
50 µm-diameter Al wire (Fig. 6a). A thermally conductive heat sink is then coupled to
the exposed side of the ASIC die, and an epoxy resin is applied in order to encapsulate
the wire bonds and to mechanically support both the thin portion of the hybrid module,
i.e. the routing part of the MEMS die, and the PCB (Fig. 6b). The assembly is then
housed in a container with an opening used to access the exposed side of the MEMS
die. Then, the entire silicon substrate is wet-etched in order to release the sensor array
(Fig. 6c). Finally, the entire device is encapsulated with a special polymeric elastomer
acting both as a protection, and as an insulating and an acoustical matching layer. As a
result, we obtain a compact-size probe head, connectable to in-probe PCBs by means of
commercial board-to-board connectors.

Figure 7a shows a 3D mechanical representation of the spiral probe head resulting
from the described packaging process. We tested this process on a squared-shape dice,
with similar dimensions, containing a recently fabricated dual-linear (crisscross) array
[15]. Figure 7b shows a picture of a completed probe head.
Finally, we show in Fig. 8 a 3D mechanical model of the interior of the probe under
development, where the probe head is connected to four PCBs containing auxiliary
electronics and the connectors used to interface the module to the ultrasound scanner by
means of a multi-coaxial cable.

development. The probe head contains a multi-chip-module achieved by hybrid
3D-integration of a CMUT spiral array and a 256-channel analog front-end ASIC.
