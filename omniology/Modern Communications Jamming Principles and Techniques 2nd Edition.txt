Preface to the Second Edition 
 
The first edition of this book was written with the intent of providing a source of 
technical information for the analysis and design of countermeasure systems 
against modern communication signals—focusing on antijam (AJ) signals 
primarily. Since the publication of that book, the focus of modern warfare 
involving EW, as well as most other military disciplines, has shifted from 
principally open terrain to urban terrain. 
 
That is not to say that warfare in urban terrain is a new discipline. Such 
settings have been a part of battles since there have been battles. The focus of 
recent military study, however, has been on large, massive formations. Only 
within the last 10–20 years or so has the emphasis shifted principally to urban 
environments. 
 
We have learned that the thoughts behind adapting traditional military 
strategies involving large forces to urban environments are more difficult than 
expected. Urban war fighting is tougher than originally anticipated. 
 
This edition of the book focuses much more on urban warfare than the first 
edition. We have included more information about the impacts of urban warfare on 
electronic warfare (EW). While the general concepts of AJ signals have not 
substantially changed since the first edition, what has dramatically changed is the 
nature of personal wireless communications, which is the single largest type of 
communications expected to be encountered in an urban setting. The mobile 
telephone usage has exploded and is especially noticeable in urban environments. 
The new standards for mobile phones are all based on AJ radio technology, and 
these communication devices have become of principal interest to military EW 
operations. Probably the most obvious of these uses is as remote triggers for IEDs. 
 
While the EW cognoscenti have long recognized the importance of the 
contribution of EW to modern warfare, EW has been sagaciously integrated into 
modern warfare thinking. It is an indirect weapon that has temporary effects. One 
of its biggest attributes is that the fratricide produced rarely involves the 
unintended recipient, as opposed to kinetic weapons that inevitably produce 
unwanted effects in urban settings.  
 
This book is divided into four broadly defined sections. The first six chapters 
provide technical details about communication signals in general. After the 
introduction in Chapter 1, the detection of signals in the presence of RF noise is 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

discussed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 we provide an introduction to modern 
signaling techniques with an emphasis on AJ. In Chapter 4 we focus our attention 
on the detection of AJ signals in particular. Chapter 5 contains a general 
discussion of RF signal propagation. Since AJ communications relies on 
pseudorandom code sequences, which are typically generated by shift registers, we 
introduce shift registers and their characteristics in Chapter 6. 
 
All modern AJ communication systems must be synchronized in some fashion 
in order to communicate. In fact, as discussed in Chapter 8, attacking the 
synchronization process is one of the more effective ways to conduct 
countermeasures. Therefore, in Chapter 7 we introduce the more common methods 
that AJ systems synchronize themselves. Furthermore, after synchronization, they 
must maintain tracking in order to stay in sync. That topic is also covered in 
Chapter 7. Chapter 8 presents techniques for jamming modern communication 
signals. We slightly divert our attention in Chapter 9 to discuss techniques for 
blindly discovering CDMA codes in use by a communication system.  
The next five chapters focus on EW methods and methodologies against 
particular spread spectrum modulation types. Chapter 10 examines EW and direct-
sequence spread spectrum modulations while Chapter 11 discusses EW and fast 
frequency-hopping communication systems. Chapter 12 focuses on slow 
frequency-hopping target networks. Chapter 13 goes into depth on EW and the 
relatively new form of spread spectrum signaling, ultrawideband communication 
systems. Last in this section, Chapter 14 addresses EW and hybrid spread 
spectrum systems. 
The next four chapters focus on discussions of the urban environment. 
Chapter 15 introduces the urban environment in general. In Chapter 16 we discuss 
the peculiarities of RF signal propagation in urban settings. Chapter 17 focuses on 
EW in urban terrain, along with some operational computer simulation results.  
Chapter 18 introduces a concept for blindly detecting and geolocating CDMA 
targets in urban (as well as suburban and rural) settings. 
The indented audience for this book is technical people (engineers and 
scientists) just beginning in the field of EW system analysis and design, as well as 
practicing professionals in that same field. There is considerable mathematics 
involved, but there are few derivations. The theorem-proof construct has been 
avoided, primarily because this is not a book about mathematical foundations but 
one intended to provide useful, pragmatic solutions to real-world problems in 
system design and analysis. Adequate references, it is hoped, are provided in each 
particular area if a reader would like to delve deeper into the subjects or to 
examine the derivations. 
This book is not intended to be a textbook—there are no chapter problems to 
work out. Rather it is intended as a one-source reference covering all of the major 
topics associated with EW systems. Inevitably, however, there are areas that are 

xxi  
 
 
 
 
Preface to the Second Edition 
 
 
overlooked, and, in some cases, left out completely. Jamming of classical 
waveforms such as analog AM and FM is not included, for example. 
Of course, there is no classified material included. All of the material 
contained in the text was obtained from open sources—much (most) from the 
various IEEE journals on communications and related subjects. 
There is bound to be mistakes in the material. That is almost inevitable in a 
work this voluminous. Constructive feedback on these mistakes will always be 
welcome.

Preface to the First Edition 
 
This book is intended to be a technical reference for engineers and scientists 
working in the field of communication jamming. The vast majority of the technical 
literature that applies to this field is contained in the literature for communication 
system and signal design. Not the least reason for this has been the importance of 
maintaining adequate national security. 
 
The modern communication signals of concern herein are antijam signals, 
comprised primarily, but not exclusively, of direct-sequence spread spectrum 
(DSSS) and frequency-hop spread spectrum (FHSS) signals. These signaling 
techniques provide certain amounts of protection from intercept and jamming, but 
they are vulnerable, nevertheless. Their degree of susceptibility to electronic attack 
(EA) is presented herein. 
Several books have been published that take the point of view of how to design 
communication systems to avoid intercept or jamming; antijam refers to the latter 
of these. While the fundamentals are the same whether designing a communication 
system or an anticommunication system, the points of view are different, which 
leads to subtle but important differences. 
 
Since about 1980, the technical literature has been prolific on determining the 
theoretical performance of AJ communication systems. These sources have never 
before been compiled into one source from the point of view of countering those 
communications, however. That was the intent in the preparation of this book. 
Technical personnel new to the anticommunications subject area had to search 
several places and make the ―communication centric‖ to ―anticommunication 
centric‖ translation to use these sources.  
 
The primary focus of the author has been military anticommunication systems. 
Thus, this book has a distinctive military aura to it. AJ communications, however, 
have infiltrated the commercial communication market in a big way in the form of 
cellular telephone systems and wireless local area networks. Therefore, much of 
the material herein should be of interest to those involved in the design of such 
structures. 
Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to jamming modern communication 
signals. The basic signaling types are defined and the notion of tactical 
communication networks is explained. 
Chapters 2–7 serve as background information for the later chapters. Chapter 2 
addresses signal propagation in the HF, VHF, and UHF frequency ranges. The 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
xxiv
basics of the physical processes involved with propagation are included as are 
some mathematical models. 
Chapter 3 presents signaling techniques normally employed in AJ 
communications. The performance of these techniques in noise, both background 
and jamming, is included. Although it is possible to design AJ systems that 
employ analog communications, most realistic systems are designed around digital 
signals. Therefore, analog signals are not included herein. Forward error correction 
(FEC) coding is a technique employed to counter channel noise and jamming. This 
chapter shows the effects of excessive noise on systems that employ coding and 
the resultant vulnerabilities. Chaotic-based systems and ultra-wide band systems 
are briefly introduced. 
All forms of spread spectrum communications rely on pseudorandom 
sequences to generate random codes. These sequences are generated with shift 
registers. Chapter 4 briefly introduces the concepts of linear feedback shift 
registers and linear recursive sequences. 
Chapter 5 provides information on synchronization and tracking in spread 
spectrum systems. As explained in the later chapters, the synchronization and 
tracking requirements are lucrative targets for electronic attack (EA).  
Chapter 6 introduces the basic jamming techniques that are typically employed 
in jammers conducting EA on AJ targets. These techniques include broadband 
noise jamming, partial band noise jamming, tone jamming, and pulse jamming. 
Most EA activities against any kind of radiating target first require the 
measurement of the RF spectrum to determine the presence and characteristics of 
the signal that is to be attacked. Chapter 7 introduces the elements involved in the 
detection of AJ targets. The results of a limited simulation are included to indicate 
in a typical case how well such targets can be detected. 
 
Chapters 8–11 address jamming each of the fundamental AJ signal types. 
Chapter 8 addresses the performance that can be expected when jamming DSSS 
signals.  
Chapter 9 contains the expected performance of EA when the targets are FHSS 
fast frequency hopping. Chapter 10 is the same for FSHH slow frequency hopping 
targets.  
Finally, Chapter 11 addresses EA performance when the targets are hybrid 
combinations of DSSS and FHSS types. 
The material in the book consists of a considerable amount of mathematics, 
although derivations are, for the most part, excluded. The performance equations 
are presented without the backup derivation—the references can be consulted if 
information on the derivations is desired. Nevertheless, a background in basic 
calculus usually provided in engineering and physics undergraduate curricula is 
generally required to understand most of the material. In addition, an 
undergraduate level of understanding of communication theory and systems is 
useful.

Modern Communications and Electronic 
Countermeasures 
 
 
1.1  Introduction 
 
The advent of the information age has brought about considerable reliance on 
wireless electronic communications. Although the cellular phone systems and 
personal communication systems are bringing wireless radio frequency (RF) 
communication to the masses, nowhere is this reliance more evident than in the 
military. For years, the military has depended upon RF communications for 
execution of command and control of tactical forces. 
 
Since tactical commanders use RF communications to exercise control of their 
forces, an adversary has interest in those communications. This interest lies in two 
fundamental areas: (1) to intercept the information that transpires over them, and 
(2) to deny the successful exchange of the information from the sender to the 
receiver. The former of these provides to the interceptor information about the 
status and intent of the adversary and is intelligence or combat information. The 
distinction between these two has to do with for what the information is used and 
is not important here. The latter is the subject of this book. 
 
 
1.2 Electronic Warfare 
 
Communication electronic warfare (EW) is the name applied to activities taken to 
accomplish the intercept or denial of communications. It consists of three main 
components: 
 
 
Electronic attack (EA); 
 
Electronic support (ES); 
 
Electronic protect (EP). 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
2 
 
EA is the new appellation for what used to be called electronic 
countermeasures (ECM). It is the use of active signals to prevent a communication 
system from effectively exchanging information. It is generally (although not 
exclusively) accepted that EA consists of three principal activities: (1) jamming, 
(2) deception, and (3) directed energy (DE). 
Of the three principal tenets of information, relevance, accuracy, and 
timeliness [1], jamming is primarily intended to address the last. If information is 
successfully exchanged, there is little that jamming can do to impact directly the 
relevance and accuracy of that information. Jamming activities, however, can 
impact on the timeliness of the information exchange by, at least temporarily, 
slowing that exchange. Jamming can also affect the relevance of information, 
because if it arrives at the intended destination too late to be of use, the 
information has becomes irrelevant. 
Deception addresses the second of these information tenets. The intent is to 
mislead an opponent by creating a ruse. False communication signals are an 
important part of any tactical deception activity. Little more will be said about 
deception herein, as that is a broad subject on its own. 
Application of directed energy is similar to jamming except the goal is to 
permanently harm or destroy the communication equipment. It requires 
significantly larger amounts of energy or power than jamming. 
ES is a supporting function to EA. It is used to measure parameters of the RF 
spectrum to ascertain the presence (detection) or characteristics of signals. Energy 
and time are wasted if jamming attempts are made on signals that are not there. 
EP consists of the efforts taken to preclude some adversary from performing 
EA and ES on friendly communications. An example of EP is the screening of 
friendly communications from adversarial attempts at ES. By broadcasting signals 
toward an adversary and away from friendly communication networks but at the 
same frequency or frequencies in use by friendly forces, the successful ES 
attempts can be thwarted. Other examples of EP are emission control (EMCON) 
and encryption.  
This description of EP is obviously focused on communications, but there are 
other forms of EP—aircraft self-protect equipment (ASE), where radar detection 
and other forms of sensing are used to determine when an aircraft is being 
targeted, for example, is certainly a form of EP. We are not concerned with such 
applications here. 
 
The question naturally arises as to how well communication jamming can 
accomplish information transport denial when AJ techniques are employed. That is 
the subject of this book. The technical literature about communication AJ 
techniques began to appear in unclassified form about 1980. Prior to that, the 
extensive U.S. Department of Defense investment in the technology was, for the 
most part, classified and unavailable to the general public. 

Modern Communications and Electronic Countermeasures

Our focus will be primarily on the RF interfaces where EW may be applied—
the so-called layer 0 in the ISO data link model, otherwise known as the physical 
layer. EW at this layer attempts to deny the receipt of signals by injecting signals 
of our choosing into communication systems that prevent those systems from 
accurately receiving the information intended. 
 
 
1.3 Antijam Communications 
 
Whether the intent is to intercept communications or to deny the same, in an 
adversarial relationship there is obviously an interest to preclude success. Anti-jam 
(AJ) communications techniques were developed to facilitate communications 
when an adversary has an interest in denying the communicator the ability to 
communicate. Such technology also helps in the anti-intercept as well, but that is 
not the subject here. 
 Since that time, several books have been written on AJ communication 
techniques and systems. The focus of these sources has been on how to design 
communication 
systems 
to 
defeat 
countermeasure 
techniques—how 
to 
communicate in the presence of intentional jamming. The focus in this book is the 
opposite—how well can a jammer perform when the targets to be jammed employ 
AJ technology. The underlying physics are the same in both circumstances; what 
is different is the goal of the utilization of the technology. 
Efforts have been expended to develop ways to avoid this interruption—at 
least the intentional ones, anyway. When the goal is to avoid interception or 
detection at all, then the techniques are called low probability of intercept (LPI) or 
a similar appellation. When the goal is to be able to communicate even in the 
presence of intentional interference (jamming), then the techniques are called AJ. 
One of the methods to thwart such tactical operations of an adversary is to 
deny communication over these nets by conducting electronic countermeasures, in 
this case, by jamming them. This jamming is accomplished by emitting energy 
toward the receiver at the same frequencies as the adversary nets whenever there is 
an attempt to communicate. 
The majority of the examples and specific discussions herein are focused on 
land-mobile communications. The results may appear to apply more to the U.S 
Army and Marines in the military. That is due to the proclivity of the author to 
focus on such applications. The technologies are fundamental, however, and apply 
to all military services—indeed, to all who use RF communications. To the extent 
that AJ electronic countermeasures (AJ ECM) are an issue, the results apply to 
commercial communication situations as well. In particular, much of the 
discussions are directly applicable to the aforementioned cellular phone and 
personal communication systems. Perhaps the most obvious of these is when the 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
4 
military must conduct operations in a situation where the adversary employs 
commercial communication means for their command and control [2, 3]. 
 
 
1.4 Networks 
 
Tactical military command and control are usually accomplished by RF 
communications. These communications are normally accomplished with 
networks, frequently referred to as nets. In this way, many nodes can communicate 
with each other as required. These nets are normally configured ahead of time and 
each member of the net knows who the other members are. If these 
communications are denied, by either intentional interference or any other means, 
then the command and control process is interrupted and operations can be 
affected. 
There are several forms of networks. A depiction of a tactical RF many-to-
many net is shown in Figure 1.1. This is typical for tactical push-to-talk (PTT) 
networks where all the personnel in a squad, for example, can communicate with 
one another. It is also possible to have one-to-many/many-to-one networks. These 
are depicted in Figure 1.2. This configuration is typified by very small aperture 
satellite (VSAT) networks, where the one node is the hub of the network. A

network can be one-to-one, as illustrated in Figure 1.3. Examples of this type of 
network are cell phones, personal communication systems (PCSs), and older forms 
of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) when in use. For this type of 
network, all the nodes can communicate with one another, but normally only two 
at a time. All of these forms of networks are susceptible to jamming. 
When we talk in modern parlance about networks, we obviously must include 
the network in the sky: the Internet. It is ubiquitous in almost all parts of the world 
and used by billions of people. The Internet does not follow the models described 
above, but provides for anybody-to-anybody communications as well as many-to- 
many communications (see Figure 1.4). We will discuss various aspects of 
communication over the Internet in this book. 
 
 
1.5 Spread Spectrum Technology 
 
Ab initio, spread spectrum communications technology was developed by the U.S. 
Department of Defense, in the United States anyway, as a way to thwart detection, 
exploitation, and countermeasures by adversaries. These communication 
technologies are rapidly moving out of the strictly military domain into 
commercial applications. One of these is the code division multiple access

(CDMA) spread spectrum (SS). Another example uses frequency hopping to 
achieve frequency diversity. These commercial applications of SS technology will 
cause these capabilities to be around for a considerable time to come. 
SS communication technology was developed as a communication technique 
to provide some degree of electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) for the 
communicator (given that jamming is an ECM technique). It represents one of the 
LPI, low probability of exploitation (LPE), or AJ techniques. A traditional single- 
tone jammer has little effect on the performance of such systems, forcing the

jammer to adopt different schemes of attack. At the very least, a jammer must be 
concerned about a much broader frequency range. 
One of the advantages of DSSS technologies is the ability to reuse the 
frequency spectrum. This is true for commercial wireless communicaitons as well. 
Such communications overlay one another in the frequency domain and allow 
many users to share the same frequencies. CDMA is facilitated by each user 
having a different code to spread its waveform. 
The analysis of jamming techniques and strategies is different from that 
focused on successful communication techniques in many subtle ways. The 
biggest difference, however, is the bit error rate (BER) regime analyzed. Pundits 
of communication strategies focus on obtaining BERs lower than around 10–3 (one 
bit in error out of 1,000, on average) and develop techniques for successful 
communications in that range. ECM techniques attempt to raise that to 10–1 or 
higher and develop strategies for countering communications in that range. It will 
be shown in Chapter 3 that if this level of BER can be achieved, then a jammer 
can be successful against AJ targets. 
Strictly speaking, AJ communication technology refers to the ability to combat 
jamming of a communication system. Being totally free from the effects of RF 
jamming in a wireless communication environment is an unrealistic goal. Given 
the right circumstances, all RF systems can be jammed. Common techniques for 
the implementation of AJ consist of ways to hide a signal so an interceptor or 
casual interloper does not know it is there, to move the signal around rapidly in the 
frequency spectrum so that traditional narrowband intercept receivers do not see 
the signal, and to have redundancy coding of digital signals. This last category was 
not initially developed to counter jamming but to combat noise effects on digital 
signals. If the jamming signal resembles thermal noise, then those techniques are 
effective against jamming as well. 
 
Spread spectrum technologies form the basis for all of the modern 
communication techniques we will discuss. We present here a brief introduction to 
the spectrum spreading approaches and techniques. Details will be presented in 
later chapters. 
 
1.5.1 Low Probability of Detection 
 
In low probability of detection (LPD) systems, the goal is to hide the signal 
somehow so that an unintended receiver has difficulty determining that the signal 
is even present. There are many potential reasons for doing so. In a military 
setting, it might be desirable to be able to communicate in a particular city without 
anyone knowing the presence of the forces. DSSS is an example of a LPD 
technology. 
 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
8 
1.5.2 Low Probability of Intercept 
 
If a signal cannot achieve LPD, then, by definition, an unintended receiver can 
detect the presence of the signal. It is still possible to provide some protection of 
signals, however. They can be made to be difficult to intercept, and in such cases, 
the signals are referred to as LPI. Frequency-hopping, described later, is an 
example of an LPI technology. 
 
1.5.3 Low Probability of Exploitation 
 
In those cases when achieving LPD and/or LPI are either too difficult or unneeded, 
it still might be desirable to avoid someone finding out what information is carried 
in the signal. The signal might be a voice conversation, for example, and the 
content of the conversation might be sensitive to the people doing the 
communicating. In that case, it is said that the denial of exploitation of the signal is 
the goal and such technologies are referred to as LPE. Encryption is an example of 
an LPE technique. 
 
In some places, LPE is defined to include LPI and LPD [4]. That will not be 
the case herein. 
 
1.5.4 Antijam 
 
This type of signal is designed to make it difficult for a jammer to be used 
effectively. In fact, the techniques used to achieve antijam signals are the same as 
those to achieve LPD, LPI, and LPE. In some cases, design parameters may be 
adjusted to optimize AJ over LPD, LPI, or LPE, but the underlying principles are 
the same. 
 
 
1.6 AJ Signal Types 
 
While there are more types of AJ communication techniques, the two predominant 
ones  in widespread use are direct sequence SS (DSSS) and frequency hopping SS 
(FHSS). A third type, called time hopping (TH), is also available and, as a 
technique to achieve AJ, it is beginning to emerge as a viable technique. 
 
1.6.1 Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum 
 
DSSS systems spread the information-bearing digital signal across a broad 
bandwidth and that entire bandwidth is occupied instantaneously—that is, the 
signal is spread over all the bandwidth at the same time. Taking a bounded energy 

Modern Communications and Electronic Countermeasures 
 
9 
data signal and spreading that energy across a very wide bandwidth causes the 
energy present at any particular frequency or small frequency band to be 
miniscule. Often it is so small as to be below the thermal noise at that frequency. 
Receivers that simply examine the spectrum at the appropriate frequency of 
operation of such communication systems will mistake the signal as noise and 
miss detection. Special signal processing is required to extract the signal. 
 
1.6.2 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum 
 
As opposed to DSSS, in FHSS systems the narrowband data signal at any given 
instant only occupies a single channel, usually narrowband. In the low VHF band1 
traditionally the frequency channelization has been 25 kHz, although this is getting 
narrower. Thus, the FHSS system at any instant is occupying this bandwidth. In 
the low VHF frequency band there are about 2,400 such channels available, and 
systems are usually designed to use some subset of these. Customarily, due to 
implementation convenience, the subset, referred to as the hop set, is sized to be a 
power of two. 
 
FHSS can be further divided into fast frequency-hopping spread spectrum 
(FFHSS) and slow frequency-hopping-spread spectrum (SFHSS). This distinction 
is normally based on the number of data bits sent on a particular hop dwell. If 
there are multiple data bits on a hop, then it is called SFHSS, while if there are 
multiple hops for each data bit, then it is called FFHSS. The number of data bits 
per hop in SFHSS sytems herein will be dentoted by LS while the number of hops 
per bit in FFHSS systems will be denoted LF. The dividing line beween SFHSS 
and FFHSS is one bit per hop or, equivalently, one hop per bit. 
FHSS has the advantage of frequency diversity. Transmitting the same 
information at different frequencies increases the probability of the information 
arriving at the receiver correctly since the multiple possible paths the signal can 
take from the transmitter to the receiver cause fading. This fading is frequency 
dependent, and, if either the transmitter or receiver is moving, this fading changes 
with such movement. 
It is common for digital frequency-hopping communication systems to use 
frequency shift keying (FSK) as the modulation of choice, and, in particular, binary 
FSK (BFSK) modulation with incoherent detection at the receiver. In BFSK, a 
data bit is sent as a tone at one of two frequencies. These tones are typically offset 
by some amount above and below a carrier frequency that is constantly changing 
                                                           
1 The VHF frequency band is used for much of the military PTT communications throughout the world. 
While the VHF band consists of all frequencies from 30 to 300 MHz, the low portion used for this 
purpose is usually restricted to 30 to 88 MHz. Frequencies above 108 MHz are also used extensively by 
the military and commercial air services for air traffic control. In the United States and many other 
countries, the band from 88 MHz to 108 MHz is restricted to commercial FM stations.

locations in the frequency spectrum [5]. We discuss FSK and other modulation 
techniques in detail in Chapter 3. 
 
1.6.3 Time-Hopping Spread Spectrum 
 
Under a broad range of conditions, the optimum way to detect a spread spectrum 
signal is with a radiometer. This device measures the energy in the bandwidth of 
the radiometer for a length of time called the integration time. At the end of that 
time, a decision is made as to whether a mark or space was sent. TH moves the 
time of transmission randomly, thereby causing the radiometer to measure noise 
much of the time. 
 
On a simpler basis, regular PTT communications used by militaries for years 
is a form of time hopping since the time between transmissions on a network is 
random. A receiver trying to listen to these communications, tuned to the 
frequency of the network, would listen to noise much of the time. 
 
One modern form of communication system design, ultrawideband (UWB) 
communications, capitalizes on time hopping to achieve AJ protection. It also 
allows for multiple users to share the same spectrum, as in DSSS and FHSS. 
Although this technology need not be limited to short-distance networking, at the 
time of this writing that appears to be the primary application. Considerable 
radiated power is required for cases where substantial distances are to be 
accommodated. UWB technology spreads the signal over large bandwidths, which 
can interfere with other types of communications in the same spectrum. 
 
1.6.4 Hybrids 
 
Combinations of the  AJ techniques can be and have been put together to gain the 
advantages of each. The most common form of a hybrid is the combination of 
DSSS with FHSS. In this combination, the stealthy nature of DSSS can be 
exploited as can the frequency diversity of FHSS. The baseband digital signal is 
first DS spread, creating a (relatively) wideband signal. That signal is then 
frequency-hopped around the spectrum using the hop set frequencies. Such signals 
are hard to detect and communication is more reliable than either modulation 
technique alone. 
 
 
1.7 Synchronization 
 
Due to the nature of tactical military communications, it is necessary to 
accommodate radios dynamically entering and leaving the nets. Even though the 
nominal composition of a net is normally established ahead of time, there may be 

Modern Communications and Electronic Countermeasures 
 
11
instances when it is necessary for a new node to be able to join. This is especially 
true with self-forming or so-called ad hoc networks, which are designed to 
facilitate network participants coming and going dynamically. In addition, 
communication over tactical networks is intermittent. When there is no exchange, 
oscillators tend to drift. Thus, synchronization is an important issue in these nets. 
It is not so difficult for non-SS networks. A transmitter just transmits on the 
correct frequency at a time when no other is using the channel. For FHSS 
networks, however, the new transmitter does not normally know the frequency the 
net is using at that moment. For DSSS networks, the new transmitter does not 
know the point in the spreading sequence the net is located. These produce special 
needs with such nets that do not exist in non-SS communications. 
 
 
1.8 Communication System Model 
 
The model of the communication system with the jammer present used here is 
shown in Figure 1.5. The signal from the transmitter propagates through the 
atmosphere to the intended receiver as well as to the jammer ES system receiver, if 
there is one. That signal is perturbed by thermal noise and possibly other 
interference, which need not necessarily be the same for the two propagation paths 
(in fact, in most cases it will not be the same). At the intended receiver, the signal 
is processed with the intent of extracting the information that was intended to be 
sent by the transmitter. At the jammer, the received signal is processed in several 
ways. Based on this processing, the jammer transmits a signal in the direction of 
the communication receiver with the intent of precluding that receiver from 
accurately extracting the information. 
 
The jammer is attempting to interfere with the receiver, not the transmitter. As 
such, the jammer must have some idea where the receiver is located. In tactical 
communication situations where networks are the primary communication means, 
each node typically transmits at least once during some time period. Those 
transmissions can be intercepted and the transmitters located to provide this 
information. 
 
 
1.9 Urban Electronic Warfare 
 
As we move further into the twenty-first century, U.S. and coalition forces are 
finding themselves much more involved with warfare in urban settings. Because of 
this we have significantly expanded the coverage of the technical issues involved 
with EW in such settings. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

In particular, as we explain in depth later, the main goal of EW in urban 
settings is to facilitate isolation of the particular urban area or a portion of it and/or 
a group of people. Such isolation helps to develop/maintain separation of foes 
from indigenous, gray2 populations as well as from supporting forces.  
 
 
1.10 Concluding Remarks 
 
The notions underpinning the techniques and methods to conduct EA against AJ 
and other communication targets are presented in the remainder of this book. AJ 
signaling was developed primarily to preclude such jamming, and considerable 
resources have been expended to make AJ techniques effective. That does not, 
however, negate the benefits to be obtained by countering communications, even if 
the targets are employing such techniques. 
 
In spite of the development of approaches to minimize the effects of jammers 
against AJ techniques, it is still possible to impact such communications. How to 
do this and how well it can be accomplished are presented herein.

CDMA [6] is no different from DSSS—it is the application of the technology 
that is different. With each user of the spectrum within the range of a single 
receiver possessing a different code sequence, they all can share the spectrum with 
minimal interference with one another, within some constraints. 
This book presents some common techniques for conducting EA against AJ 
communication systems. The first topic covered is the nature of detecting 
communication signals in noise. That is followed by discussions about AJ 
signaling techniques and how these signals in particular can be detected in noise. 
Next, the characteristics of RF signal propagation are presented in Chapter 5. 
Chapter 6 covers shift registers and discusses the recursive sequences that ensue 
from them. Chapter 7 focuses on the methods of synchronization and tracking of 
AJ signals. We present the major forms of jamming techniques in Chapter 8. This 
is followed in Chapter 9 by a presentation of methods of blindly discovering the 
codes used in CDMA systems. Chapters 10–14 discuss jamming of the forms of 
SS signaling. Chapter 10 covers DSSS sysems, Chapter 11 focuses on FFHSS 
jamming, and Chapter 12 covers SFHSS jamming. THSS, and, in particular, 
jamming UWB signals, is discussed in Chapter 13. Hybrids of these forms of SS 
are presented in Chapter 14. The characteristics of EW in urban settings is 
discussed in Chapters 15–17. Finally, blind detection of CDMA signals in urban 
environments is discussed in Chapter 18.

Detection of Signals in Noise 
 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
This chapter presents background material on how noise affects the signal 
detection process in EW systems. In communication EW system analysis and 
design, the word detection can mean different things. For example, when 
considering digital communication systems where the information is transported in 
the form of symbols, detection refers to the determination of which symbol was 
transmitted. When the system under consideration is a communication EW system, 
detection may refer to that, but it also refers to the determination if there is a signal 
present in a specified region of the frequency spectrum. In this chapter, indeed, in 
the entire book except Chapter 3, it is this latter definition that is used. 
Such detection is normally accomplished by downconverting the signal at the 
antenna to some convenient intermediate frequency (IF), which is then filtered and 
amplified to suitable levels for subsequent processing. For purposes of signal 
detection, it is determination of the signal power or amplitude which indicates 
presence or not. Therefore measurement of the signal amplitude is the apropos 
parameter. This can be done prior to any demodulation, but it is more common to 
amplitude demodulate the filtered signal prior to calculating the level. If there is a 
signal present with any type of modulation (including none—just the carrier), 
there is a nonzero level of AM detected. The mathematics behind this technique is 
well understood and systems with known performance can be designed this way. 
This chapter is structured as follows. We begin by defining what we mean by 
a signal and receiver. We then describe some statistical detection theories that are 
in common use. Probability density functions (PDFs) familiar to the analysis of 
noise amplitudes are described next. We then discuss radiometric detection of 
signals in noise, along with radiometer performance under nonideal conditions 
such as nonstationary noise, uncertainty in the knowledge of the thermal noise 
level, and non-Gaussian (impulsive) noise. We conclude the chapter with an in-
depth analysis of urban noise sources and their impact on EW in such an 
environment.

2.3 Receiver Structure 
 
A receiver used for the detection of signals is typified by the simplified block 
diagram shown in Figure 2.1. The antenna signal would typically feed a low noise 
amplifier (LNA), the reasons for which are described Section 2.5. Associated with 
the LNA would typically be some sort of suboctave or bandpass filter (suboctave 
is shown). The purpose of this filter is to minimize distortion in the signal caused 
by second harmonics. That signal is then converted in frequency to some 
convenient IF, fIF, which is subsequently amplified and filtered in several IF 
stages. There may even be additional stages of frequency conversion in the IF 
processing. After this amplification and filtering, the signal is detected in an 
envelope detector, producing as the output, the amplitude of the signal at the 
detector input. The envelope is compared with the threshold th and if the

threshold is exceeded, a signal presence is declared. If the threshold is not 
exceeded, then a signal absence is declared. 
 
This processing typically would be for only a limited time segment (0, T ) 
because the receiver would normally be retuned to look for signals in other parts 
of the spectrum. The part of the continuous communication signal that is measured 
in (0, T ) is called a signal segment herein. 
 
 
2.4 Binary Decision Theory 
 
The decisions that can be made when there are only two choices, as is the case 
here (signal present and signal absent) are indicated in Figure 2.2. If the signal is 
not present and the decision is made that it is present, then a false alarm has 
occurred. If absent and declared absent, then that is a correct decision. On the 
other hand, if the signal is present and it is declared present, then that too is a 
correct decision. Lastly, if the signal is present and it is declared absent, then a 
missed detection has occurred. The probability of false alarm is denoted Pfa while 
the probability of miss is denoted Pm. Note that the probability of detection is 
given as

This can be seen with the aid of Figure 2.3, which shows the PDFs of noise only

and signal plus noise in Figure 2.3(a). The light shaded area in Figure 2.3(b) 
corresponds to the probability of false alarm because there is only noise present, 
yet the signal level is above the threshold, and therefore signal present will be 
decided. Likewise, the dark shaded area in Figure 2.3(b) is the probably of miss 
because the signal level is below the threshold and therefore no signal is declared, 
even though the signal is present. The probability of detection is given by area A1, 
the whole area under the darkly shaded curve in Figure 2.3(a) less the darkly 
shaded area in Figure 2.3(b), A2 = Pm. Since for any PDF

and proper detection occurs when the signal is detected when it is present, then the 
probability of detection is given by Pd = A1 – A2 = 1 – Pm. It is clear from this 
discussion that Pd and Pfa are determined by where the threshold is set. 
 
2.4.1 Statistical Signal Detection Theory  
 
The signal is corrupted with external and internal noise so the data from the 
detector will be a random process. Consequently, the problem of detecting the 
presence of the signal from the noise is a statistical one. The idea behind the signal 
detection is that the presence of the signal changes the statistical characteristics of 
the envelope of the signal (2.2), in particular, its probability density and 
distribution. When the signal is absent, then the amplitude has the PDF pn(a), and 
when the signal is present, the PDF is ps+n(a).  
The problem of detecting the signal in noise can be posed as a statistical 
hypothesis testing problem. The null hypothesis H0 is that the signal is absent from 
the data and the alternative hypothesis H1 is that the signal is present: 
 
 
0
1
:Signal absent
:Signal present
H
H
 
(2.4) 
 
In binary hypothesis testing, it is assumed that one of the two hypotheses is indeed 
correct. There are four possible outcomes: 
 
 
Case 1: H0 is true, and we declare H0 to be true 
 
Case 2: H0 is true, but we declare H1 to be true 
 
Case 3: H1 is true, and we declare H1 to be true 
 
Case 4: H1 is true, but we declare H0 to be true 
 
A hypothesis test (or decision rule)  is a partition of the observation space 
into two sets, 
and its complement 
. We accept the null hypothesis if the 
observations are in 
; otherwise, we reject it. As indicated in Figure 2.2, there are 
two kinds of errors that we can make. A type I error is made by choosing 
hypothesis H1 when H0 is true and a type II error is made by choosing H0 when H1 
is true. In hypothesis testing the probability of a type I error is called the 
significance of the test, whereas Pd is called the power of the test. 
The problem is to find a test that is optimal according to some criterion. We 
will discuss a few such approaches here, but bear in mind that there are many 
others that are applicable to specific problems. 
The assumptions made about the signal affect the detection performance. The 
most general case is when the signal is random, as is the noise. In this case, 
nothing is known or assumed about the signal to be detected. The other end of the 
difficulty spectrum is when the signal is totally known and there is no noise (or 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
20
insignificant levels of noise) present. Other detection problems fall between these 
two extremes. 
There are two fundamental forms of optimizations in signal detection: 
Bayesian-based and frequency-based. The Bayes criterion is an example of the 
former, while Neyman-Pearson is an example of the latter. 
 
2.4.2 Bayesian Approach 
 
In the Bayesian approach, costs are assigned to the decisions; in particular, these 
costs are given by Cij, i, j = 0, 1. Cij is the cost incurred by choosing hypothesis Hi 
when hypothesis Hj is true. Next, probabilities 0 and 1 are assigned where 0 and 
1 = 1 – 0 are the probabilities of the hypotheses H0 and H1, respectively. These 
probabilities are called a priori probabilities or priors. The Bayes risk is then the 
overall expected value of the cost incurred by the decision rule :

R0 and R1 partition the input space: they are disjoint and their conjunction is the 
full input space. This means that every possible input x belongs to one and only 
one of these regions. In order to minimize the Bayes risk, a measurement x should 
belong to the decision region Ri for which the corresponding integrand in (2.7) is 
smaller. Therefore, the Bayes risk is minimized by assigning x to R0 whenever

Here, (x) is called the likelihood ratio,  is called the threshold, and the overall 
decision rule is called the likelihood ratio test (LRT). The expression on the right 
is called a threshold. 
 
It can be shown that the two main approaches to maximizing the desirable 
properties of the detection—the Bayes or Neyman-Pearson—amount to the same 
thing; the detector finds a likelihood ratio [which will be a function only of the 
sufficient statistic given by (2.9)] and then compares this ratio with a preset 
threshold. By varying the threshold, we can see that the detection ratio (where we 
correctly say H1) and the false alarm rate (where we incorrectly say H1) will vary 
in a predictable manner. Hence, if we have complete knowledge of the probability 
densities of H0 and H1, we can construct an optimal detector, or at least determine 
the properties of such a detector. 
 
Note that (2.9) requires knowledge of the costs associated with making the 
various decisions. Many times these costs are not accurately known. In that case it 
is common to assume equally distributed values, lacking any reason to assume 
otherwise. Another approach is to use the minimum probability of error decision 
rule discussed next. 
 
2.4.3 Minimum Probability of Error Decision Rule 
 
The minimum probability of error decision rule is a useful approach for decision 
making when the a priori Bayesian costs are not available. Again, let i denote the 
a priori probability of hypothesis Hi. Suppose our decision rule declares ―H0 is 
true‖ when 
0,

The minimum probability of error decision rule selects R0 and R1 to minimize 
(2.10). Since an observation x falls into one and only one of the decision regions

integrand in (2.10) is smaller. Thus, we select

The expression for (x) is somewhat complicated. By

Here we have used the assumption μ > 0. If μ < 0, then dividing 
by μ would reverse the inequalities. 
This form of the decision rule is much simpler: we just 
compare the observed value x to a threshold . Figure 2.4 depicts 
the two candidate densities and a possible value of . If each 
hypothesis is a priori equally likely (0 = 1 = ½ ), then  = μ / 2. 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the case where 0 > 1 (  > μ / 2). If we 
plot the two densities so that each is weighted by its a priori 
probability of occurring, the two curves will intersect at the 
threshold (see Figure 2.5). This plot also offers a way to 
visualize the probability of error.

Since Q(x) is monotonically decreasing, this says that the

 and increasing μ. 
 
In the preceding example, the computation of the probability of error involved 
a one-dimensional integral. If we had multiple observations, or vector-valued data, 
generalizing this procedure would involve multi-dimensional integrals over 
potentially complicated decision regions. Fortunately, in many cases, we can avoid 
this problem through the use of sufficient statistics. 
 
2.4.4 Maximum A Posteriori Interpretation 
 
The LRT is one way of expressing the minimum probability of error decision rule. 
Another way is 
 
Rule: Declare hypothesis i true such that ipi(x) is maximal.    
 
This rule is referred to as the maximum a posteriori, or MAP, rule because the 
quantity ipi(x) is proportional to the posterior probability of hypothesis i. This 
becomes clear when we write i = Pr{Hi} and pi(x) = pi(x|Hi). Then, by the Bayes 
rule, the posterior probability of Hi given the data is 
 
 
Pr{
} (
)
Pr{
}
( )
i

H
p x H
H x
p x

(2.18) 
 
Here p(x) is the unconditional PDF for x, which is effectively a constant when 
trying to maximize (2.18) with respect to i. 
Thus, in the MAP interpretation, the optimal decision boundary is the locus of 
points where the weighted densities (in the continuous case) ipi(x) intersect one 
another.  
 
2.4.4.1 Special Case of Bayes Risk 
 
As discussed above, the Bayes risk criterion for constructing decision rules assigns 
a cost Cij to the outcome of declaring Hi when Hj is true. The probability of error is 
simply a special case of the Bayes risk corresponding to C00 = C11 = 0 and          

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
26
C01 = C10 = 1. Therefore, the form of the minimum probability of error decision 
rule is a special case of the minimum Bayes risk decision rule: both are LRTs. The 
different costs in the Bayes risk formulation simply shift the threshold to favor one 
hypothesis over the other. In addition, as mentioned, if the a priori costs are not 
known, the minimum probability of error decision rule can be used. 
 
2.4.5 Neyman-Pearson Approach 
 
In many signal detection problems the imposition of a specific cost structure on 
the decisions made is not possible or desirable. The Neyman-Pearson approach 
involves a trade-off between the two types of errors that we can make in choosing 
a particular hypothesis. The Neyman-Pearson design criterion is to maximize Pd 
subject to a specified Pfa; it is also known as the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) 
detector. 
The probability of false alarm and probability of detection are related to each 
other through the decision regions. If R1 is the decision region for H1, we have

(2.20) 
 
The densities pn(x) and ps+n(x) are nonnegative, so as R1 shrinks, both probabilities 
approach zero. As R1 expands, both tend to one. The ideal case, where Pd = 1 and 
Pfa = 0, cannot occur unless the PDFs do not overlap (i.e., 
n
s+n
( )
( )
0
p
x p
x dx 

). 
Therefore, in order to increase Pd, we must also increase Pfa. This is the 
characteristic trade off in the hypothesis testing and detection theory. 
The Neyman-Pearson criterion specifies that the decision rule should be such 
that the probability of detection is maximized while not allowing the probability of 
false alarm to exceed a certain value . Thus, the criterion can be expressed as 
 
 
d

The maximization is over all decision rules denoted by {} (equivalently, over all 
decision regions ,
). Using different terminology, the Neyman-Pearson 
criterion selects the most powerful test of size (not exceeding) . The solution to 
this optimization problem is given by the Neyman-Pearson property.

which is to introduce the Neyman-Pearson criterion for signal detection. For those

The optimal decision rule is an LRT. (a) is the likelihood ratio, and  is the 
threshold. Observe that neither the likelihood ratio nor the threshold depends on 
the a priori probabilities Pr{Hi}; they depend only on the conditional densities pn 
and ps+n and the size constraint . The threshold can often be determined as a 
function of .

2.5.1 Channel Model 
 
The transmitted waveform gets corrupted by noise, n(t), often assumed to be 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), although there are other types of noise 
models available, and we will discuss some of them. 
 
Additive: The noise gets ―added‖ (as opposed to, for example, 
multiplied) to the received signal. 
 
White: The spectrum of the noise is flat for all frequencies, so 
therefore no particular frequency is favored in the spectrum (if 
there were such frequencies, it would be known as colored 
noise). The amplitude of this noise spectrum is given by N0, 
which is a PSD and is specified as

At the EW (or target) receiver, the noise components of concern for 
estimating signal detection performance are as indicated in Figure 2.8. For the 
moment we assume that there is no jamming signal present. The spectrum of the 
noise component, N0, is assumed to be a flat function of the frequency over a 
bandwidth that is wider than that of concern to our analysis. The noise power due

where N0 is given by (2.27). The other two noise components are the noise due to 
sources other than thermal agitation of electrons external to the system (e.g., 
atmospheric, man-made, and so forth) denoted by Pa, and that noise due to thermal 
agitation within the electronics of the system, represented by the noise factor f. 
The total noise power that the detector ―sees,‖ which is the noise power of concern 
to us when computing the BER performance, is therefore given by multiplying the 
total external power by the noise factor:

Typically, the first module encountered by a signal from an antenna in EW 
systems, or any receiving system for that matter, is an LNA. In fact, sometimes the 
LNA is integrated with the antenna for receive applications. The reason for this is 
how the various components in the receiver chain contribute to the noise level. If f1 
represents the noise factor of the first module with gain G1, f2 represents the noise 
factor of the second module with gain G2, and so on, the system noise factor is 
given by

So the effects of subsequent stages of amplification, losses, mixing, and so forth, 
each with an associated noise factor and gain, are reduced by the product of all the 
gains of the stages that precede them. Thus, the minimum noise factor is the noise 
factor of the first module. This is why the first module is usually an LNA. If G1 is 
sufficiently high, the effects of later modules are minimized. 

Detection of Signals in Noise

It is important to minimize the noise factor so that maximum sensitivity can 
be achieved. EW systems are sometimes used against distant targets, and 
sensitivity is important to intercept targets at long range. 
The external noise over and above the external thermal noise, that is, Pa, can be 
estimated with the aid of Figures 2.9 and 2.10, which chart averages of the 
external noise, Pa. These charts are worldwide averages, so to a first order, apply 
anywhere in the world. Pa is expressed in terms of decibels above the level of 
kBT0W for convenience. Note that these components add numerically, not in dB, as 
expressed in (2.30). 
When one of these factors is 10 dB higher than another, it is 10 times more 
significant, 20 dB corresponds to 100 times, and so forth. When there is a 10 dB or 
more difference, the weaker component can frequently be ignored. 
The noise power in (2.30) has a corresponding ―equivalent‖ PSD, which we 
will denote in the sequel by 
0.
N It must be remembered, however, that this is not 
the same N0 used when considering only thermally generated noise.  
The most significant ramification of this is that, in general,

for any bandwidth W with this definition of N0. The Fa terms, estimates of which 
are shown in Figures 2.9 and 2.10 [2], are decidedly not frequency independent, 
especially in the HF frequency range below 30 MHz. From 30 to 300 MHz, or so, 
galactic and man-made noise (MMN) sources dominate. Most PTT combat net 
radios (CNRs) operate in that range so it is certainly a frequency range of interest. 
From about 300 MHz to 1 GHz, MMN is dominant. Above 1 GHz, the thermal 
noise as given by N0 = kBT0W is the only source of significance. Therefore, above 
1 GHz we can say that 
 
 
N

(2.35) 
 
using the standard constant noise PSD. Below this frequency, using (2.35) for PN 
with the equivalent N0 produces only gross estimates of the detector input noise for 
frequency-hopping CNRs. If the target of interest is narrowband, however, so that 
the VHF channelization of 25 kHz is valid, then (2.35) with the equivalent 
0
Nis 
an accurate and useful estimate. In that case, at 100 MHz, for example, the span of 
W is only 25  103  100 106 = 0.4%, well within reasonable accuracy. 
MMN is external background noise caused by man-made sources. This noise 
would typically be larger in urban environments than in suburban settings and we 
explore it in depth later in this chapter. Representative sources of this type of noise 
are neon signs, welders, and electric heaters. The noise figure F represents the 
totality of the noise sources internal to the receiver, but reflected to the receiver

input, leaving the remainder of the receiver noise-free. Typical noise figures for 
receivers in the low VHF range are 10–20 dB, while in the UHF and above range, 
2–10 dB is typical. See [3] for a further explanation of the noise factor. 
As can be seen from Figures 2.9 and 2.10, the external noise can be several 
tens of decibels higher than the kBT0W noise for urban and suburban environments 
below about 1 GHz. At these levels, kBT0W noise can be ignored and system 
performance is largely dictated by the external, nonthermal noise sources. In many 
cases, the system noise figure is negligible in comparison as well. 
 
The Sun and other close stars and planets contribute to the thermal noise level 
as well. Table 2.1 shows the effective temperature of these noise sources [4]. 
These are particularly troublesome if a directional antenna is pointed at the source, 
and all real antennas are directional to some extent. 
 
2.5.2 Plasma Noise 
  
Plasma is the fourth state of matter, the other three states being solid, liquid, and 
gas. Though more than 90% of the universe consists of plasma, the only 
observable naturally occurring forms of plasma on Earth are lightning and fire.  
  
All matter consists of atoms bonded together in a lattice. Each atom in turn 
consists of a nucleus (positively charged protons and neutral neutrons) and 
electrons (negatively charged particles) that can be modeled as orbiting the 
nucleus; and, of course, two or more atoms may combine to form molecules. In a 
solid, the bonding between molecules is very strong with little freedom of 
movement for individual atoms or molecules. When a solid is heated, energy is

added to the molecules, and if heated sufficiently, it becomes a liquid because the 
bonding is weakened, permitting molecules to move about more freely. Heating 
further causes a break-up of the molecules and the liquid becomes a gas where 
individual atoms or molecules move about unhindered.  
The Earth’s lower atmosphere consists predominantly of oxygen, nitrogen, 
carbon dioxide, and argon gas molecules. In the upper atmosphere (80–100 km), 
interaction with extreme ultraviolet rays and cosmic radiation from the Sun heats 
up individual atoms to such levels that atoms are stripped of their electrons—a 
process with the appellation ionization. An ionized plasma containing negative 
electrons and positively charged atom nuclei (called ions) results.  
  
Because a plasma is an ionized medium, consisting of electrically charged 
particles (negative electrons and positive ions), its properties are controlled by 
electromagnetic forces according to Maxwell’s laws of electrodynamics [5]. These 
same rules describe the operation of an electromagnet or electric motor. In the case 
of an ionized plasma, the magnets are substituted by the Earth or Sun’s magnetic 
field. 
  
Stochastic plasma noise can sometimes produce large amounts of 
electromagnetic emissions and interfere or even damage nearby electronic 
equipment including sensitive EW systems. One of the major sources of plasma 
noise, especially in an urban setting, is from arc welders.

2.6 Noise Amplitude Probability Density Functions 
 
This section introduces the most common forms of PDFs of the amplitude of 
signals in noise under various conditions. 
 
2.6.1 Gaussian 
 
The noise entering the IF filter is assumed to be Gaussian (as it is thermal in 
nature) with an amplitude PDF given by

An example of a Gaussian PDF is shown in Figure 2.11. This Gaussian density has 
zero mean and unit standard deviation, the standard density. 
 
2.6.2 Rayleigh 
 
If Gaussian noise is passed through a narrowband filter (one whose bandwidth is 
small compared to the center frequency), then the amplitude PDF of the envelope 
of the noise voltage at the output has the form of the Rayleigh PDF

where A is the amplitude of the envelope of the filter output. 
  
The Rayleigh PDF is compared with Gaussian in Figure 2.11. In addition, a 
few Rayleigh PDFs are illustrated in Figure 2.12. The densities are shown 
corresponding to different values of the standard deviation. As the standard 
deviation increases, the PDFs decrease in height and become broader. 
 
2.6.3 Ricean 
 
Consider that a sine wave with amplitude, A, is present along with the noise at the 
input to the IF filter. The frequency of the sine wave is equal to the center 
frequency of the IF filter. It was shown by Rice that the amplitude of the signal at 
the output of the envelope detector will have the following amplitude PDF (known 
as a Ricean density) [6].

A few examples of the Ricean PDFs are illustrated in Figure 2.13. With low values 
of signal level and noise standard deviations, the Ricean PDF resembles the 
Rayleigh PDF, while as the signal gets larger and/or the noise power increases, it 
more closely resembles the normal PDF. 
 
2.6.4 Nakagami 
 
The Nakagami PDF was developed to model the amplitude distribution of HF 
signals propagated via the ionosphere [7–9]. Through the parameter m, the 
Nakagami distribution can model signal fading conditions that range from severe 
to moderate. The primary justification for the use of the Nakagami-m is its good fit 
to empirical fading data. Much theoretical and numerical analysis of the 
performances of diverse communication systems operating in Nakagami fading 
has been reported in the literature. 
Fewer results related to the computer simulation of Nakagami-m fading have 
been reported. 
In this section, we briefly recall some basic properties of the Nakagami PDF. 
The Nakagami-m PDF is given by:

If the location parameter is known, it can be subtracted from the original data 
points before computing the maximum likelihood estimates of the shape and scale 
parameters. 
 
2.6.6 Illustrative Noise Amplitudes 
 
A typical Gaussian noise PDF representing noise into a bandpass filter is shown in 
Figure 2.11. The Rayleigh PDF of the output of the bandpass filter with no signal 
present is also illustrated in Figure 2.11. That is what typically happens in a 
bandpass filter with noise only at its input. The output is characterized by a 
Rayleigh PDF.  
 
2.6.7 False Alarm Time 
 
Consider the envelope of the noise signal in Figure 2.17 and assume that the noise 
corresponds to a Rayleigh r.v. A false alarm occurs whenever the noise voltage 
exceeds a defined threshold th. The probability of this occurring is determined by 
integrating the PDF from that threshold out to the remainder of the possibilities, 
that is, the integration range is

Unfortunately, this cannot be evaluated in a closed form and so numerical 
techniques or a series approximation must be used.  
In terms of the PDFs, the detection and false alarm process is shown 
graphically in Figure 2.18.  
 
Note that this is for a single pulse of a steady sinusoidal signal in Gaussian 
noise with no detection losses. Pd and Pfa are determined numerically. 
 
 
2.7 Radiometric Detection of Signals in Noise 
 
2.7.1 Introduction 
 
A radiometer measures the energy content of the signal at its input, and the 
specifics of that signal in general do not need to be—and in the EW application are 
not normally—known. 
A radiometer detector is shown in Figure 2.19 that consists of a bandpass 
filter, a squaring function, and an integrator. W is assumed to be wide enough that 
the SOI passes through without distortion. The energy in a signal r(t), 0  t  T is 
given by

so a radiometer is an energy detector, and in an EW system that targets SS signals, 
radiometers are frequently wideband, and thus can be used against any type of SS 
system considered here. They need not be wideband, however. If W matches the 
width of each channel, there could be a radiometer for each of the channels in Wss.

This is the predetect SNR so SNR = CNR. This chart assumes a Rayleigh r.v.

As seen in (2.72), the radiometer is an energy detector, and the amount of 
energy present over (0, T ) is used as a measure of the signal presence or absence.  
The radiometer shown in Figure 2.19 measures the energy E of the input signal 
with frequency extent given by W Hz over a time interval T. After integrating for T 
seconds, the integrator output, , is sampled. If  exceeds the threshold given by 
th, the signal is declared to be present. 
Frequently the output of the radiometer is normalized by an estimate of the 
noise associated with the signal. In that case

is used, where N0 is the one-sided noise spectral density. Palpably, in that case 
some method must be available to generate the noise estimate. 
The performance of such radiometers was analyzed by Dillard and Dillard 
[12]. The probability of false alarm presented there is

The product TWF can be on the order of 1. For a typical VHF FHSS system, 
for example, using a radiometer as a detector of the data bits in BFSK, T  1 / 
20,000 seconds and WF  25 kHz, yielding TWF  1.

2.7.2 Radiometer Performance 
 
 
The radiometer is an optimum detector if the input noise is stationary and 
Gaussian with a flat PSD. It is also a reasonable architecture for deterministic but 
unknown signals in Gaussian noise [13]. Analysis of the classic radiometer for 
energy detection has been extended to cases where the input signals are corrupted 
by non-Gaussian noise [14]. In addition, analysis of the radiometer has been 
extended to the case when the input signal noise is nonstationary [15, 16]. 
As noted above, when the input to a bandpass filter is Gaussian, and therefore 
has a constant two-sided PSD, N0 / 2, the amplitude of the output is characterized 
by a Rayleigh density. If there is a sinusoidal signal present as well, then the 
amplitude of the output is characterized by a Ricean density. Expressing the input 
PSD by Sx(f ) = N0 / 2 and the output PSD by Sy(f ), then for any linear time 
invariant (LTI) system with transfer function given by H(f )

With a sinusoidal signal present in addition to having the noise spectrum at 
the output, there will be energy due to the signal. This is illustrated in Figure 2.22. 
 
If the input to the radiometer is AWGN with two-sided PSD given by N0/2, 
the normalized test statistic z / N0 is an r.v. with a central chi-square distribution 
(see Appendix 2A) with v = 2TW degrees of freedom, the PDF of which is given 
by

d is the difference in the means of the output densities under noise and signal-plus-

detectability. d 2 is a measure of the postdetection or output power SNR of the 
detector and is referred to as the deflection. Equation (2.91) relates the specified 
performance (Pfa and Pd) and the SNR necessary to achieve them. The value of d 
is typically determined by numerical integration.

This adjustment factor is illustrated in Figure 2.23 for when Pd = 0.9 (see [17, pp. 
27–34] for other values of Pd). 
Comparisons between the Edell model and the exact results given by (2.81) 
and (2.82) are given in Figures 2.24 and 2.25. We see that for the examples given, 
the SNR error is generally less than 0.5 dB. 
In classical energy detection, the performance of the detector is determined 
strictly by d. Detector performance is illustrated in Figure 2.26 where the 
probability of detection is plotted versus d. In this model, irrespective of the noise 
power level present, arbitrary levels of detection are possible simply by extending 
T (assuming the signal cooperates and remains on for the entire measurement). In 
this approach, the false alarm probability is determined by the selection of the 
threshold and, since this probability does not depend on any signal level because, 
for a false alarm to occur, by definition there is no signal present, it remains

constant. As mentioned previously, this is called CFAR detection, and is perhaps 
the most common form of signal detection since performance is known. 
 
2.7.3 Effects of Fluctuating Noise Levels on Radiometric Detection 
 
The above analysis assumed that the amount of noise power that is present is 
constant during the measurement interval and once the threshold is determined it 
also does not change during the measurement interval. In situations where this is 
not the case, considerable deviation from the results presented occurs. An HF 
channel may look like that in Figure 2.27 where significant levels of impulsive 
noise are likely to occur due to atmospheric conditions (lightning) or man-made 
sources, such as automotive ignitions and arc welders. Signals in the HF frequency 
range typically look more like the one shown in Figure 2.27 than ones with 
constant noise levels. When the noise is fluctuating, and the signal level is below 
the noise level, for example, in DSSS waveforms, the detectability is not a reliable 
measure of detection performance. 
With fluctuating noise levels and a constant threshold, Pd and Pfa do not 
remain constant. This is illustrated in Figure 2.28. With the threshold held at th as 
determined by the middle noise condition shown in Figure 2.28(a), then Pfa is 
given by the area in black and Pd is given by the area in gray. As the noise level 
increases, so does Pd, as shown in Figure 2.28(b); however, Pfa increases by the 
amount shaded in dark gray. The threshold would have to be adjusted to 1 to 
maintain a constant false alarm rate (shown here as 10–2). Likewise, as the noise 
level decreases as shown in Figure 2.28(c), Pfa decreases but so does Pd. The 
threshold would need to move to 2 in order to keep the false alarm rate constant.

An approach to estimate the detection performance of an energy detector in a 
time varying channel is presented in this section. The method assumes that the  
PDF for the noise power is known (or assumed or estimated to be log-normal, 
although other PDFs can also be used and the analysis approach remains valid). 
Then classical distribution functions of the detection probabilities are averaged 
over the range of noise level PN present. 
For large time-bandwidth products (TW > 100) [17], the probability of 
detection of such a detector can be approximated by

The probability of detection for several typical SNRs and TW products is 
illustrated in Figure 2.29. As is normal for such analysis, the threshold value was 
changed to establish Pfa. For the normal radiometer case considered earlier, once 
that threshold value was determined, it remained constant for all values of TW. 
That is not the case for Figure 2.29. The threshold level was changed in Figure 
2.29 so that the false alarm rate was approximately constant at ~10–4. It should be 
noted that Pfa is very sensitive to the value of this threshold. 
 
The same data as shown in Figure 2.29 is shown in Figure 2.30. This figure 
makes the extreme sensitivity to the SNR a little more obvious. Detection 
performance goes from virtually nothing to almost a sure thing for TW > 100 as 
the SNR varies over just a 10 dB range.

Since the probability of false alarm is dependent on parameters beyond the 
threshold, it is not possible to implement a constant false alarm process. That is, 
Pfa cannot be used to specify a constant th, which is then used to predict Pd. 
This model is more applicable to detection problems in a noise fluctuating 
channel than the classic radiometer analysis presented above. For the typical PDF 
defined with a 10 dB mean (n) and a standard deviation (n) greater than 0 dB, 
the detection performance can only be increased up to a limit with an increase in 
time-bandwidth product. Beyond that limit, no significant improvement can be 
obtained. 
 
2.7.4 Effects of Noise Power Level Uncertainty in Radiometric Detectors 
 
Even if the noise power level remains constant during the measurement interval, it 
must be measured in order for a radiometer to function correctly. It was noted in 
the previous section that Pfa is extremely sensitive to changes in the threshold in 
radiometers. This effect was quantized by Sonnenschein and Fishman [15], and the 
results obtained there are summarized in this section.

Figure 2.31 shows (2.123) for several values of U and Pfa = Pm = 10–2. Note 
that for small values of SNR that even for a small amount of uncertainty, on the 
order of fractions of a decibel, there is considerable variability in the amount of 
additional SNR required to assure the performance expected and predicted for the 
certain-noise case. The case of U = 1, or no uncertainty, is given by the U = 0 dB 
curve. 
Figure 2.32 shows the SNR variability for when the uncertainty U = 0.25 dB.

where U=1 is the SNR required when there is no uncertainty. This equation is 
plotted in Figure 2.33 for 0  U  3 dB. What Figure 2.33 indicates that if         
U=1 = –20 dB and the noise level uncertainty U = 1 dB, then   13 dB more 
SNR is required to ensure the performance of the radiometer. As the U=1 increase 
above zero, note from Figure 2.33 that, for small values of uncertainty, U << 1,  
  0, and the SNR prediction for certain-noise conditions is acceptable. 
 
This extreme sensitivity to uncertainty in knowing N0 is apparently due to the 
fact that at the SNR levels normally encountered in DSSS signals, which is 
typically less than zero, there is considerably more noise energy than signal 
energy. This is evident from (2.115) and (2.116) because the mean of the test 
statistic is influenced by the noise level for both hypotheses, and for typical DSSS 
signal-to-noise ratios the noise is the dominant signal present.  
 
The noise level uncertainty can arise from any and all of the noise sources 
discussed herein. It can be due to external sources, predominantly atmospheric in 
the low VHF range and man-made in the upper frequency ranges (both of which 
are impulsive in nature), or it can be due to any of the internal noise sources. 
Estimating this noise level accurately in a radiometer is critical to its performance. 
 
2.7.5 Energy Detection of a Signal with Random Amplitude 
 
The above analyses assumed that the noise into the detection receiver was 
Gaussian and stationary. Kostylev documented a development where the Gaussian

assumption was removed [13] (the stationary assumption remained). He allowed 
the amplitude of the signal to have Rayleigh, Ricean, and Nakagami distributions, 
as well as others, and computed the expressions for Pd and Pfa. Those results are 
summarized in this section. For the most part, the probabilities of false alarm and 
detection are not available in closed form but are manifest in functions that must 
be computed numerically.

2.8 Urban RF Noise 
 
2.8.1 Introduction 
 
By far, the most important source of noise in the higher mobile communication 
bands is that radiated by electrical equipment of various kinds and is MMN. MMN 
is almost always impulsive in nature [20], which means that its characteristics are 
fundamentally different from random noise of thermal origin. Impulsive noise (IN) 
is characterized by bursts of very short duration, which may have random 
amplitude and random time of occurrence. The impulsive nature of some MMN 
produces a PSD that is broadband. IN typically comes from electrical equipment 
where sparks occur. A prime example of this source is the car engine. First, it is 
ubiquitous, and second, the individual sources can be quite strong due to the high 
voltage breakdown at the spark plugs. In this section we focus considerably more 
on the predominant noise sources in urban settings: man-made noise [21]. 
Much of the material in this chapter came from [22]. 
 
2.8.2 Urban Noise Overview 
 
Most MMNs have an impulsive characteristic. That is, the energy arrives in bursts 
and can have significant amplitude. This is due to the sources of most such noise. 
Sources of this MMN include:  
 
 
Noise from electrical machinery (particularly from commutating DC 
motors); 
 
Switching transients; 
 
Figure 2.37. Detection performance base. (Source: [14]. © IEEE 2002. Reprinted with permission.) 

Detection of Signals in Noise

 
Discharge lighting; 
 
Microwave ovens; 
 
Automotive ignitions; 
 
Neon signs; 
 
Fluorescent lightbulbs; 
 
New compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs); 
 
Electric welders; 
 
Kitchen appliances. 
 
MMN from these sources is generally broadband and the emission levels are 
largely controlled by manufacturing and distribution standards. Taking local action 
against a specific piece of equipment may control noise identified from nearby 
sources. Proliferation of such MMN sources, however, particularly in built-up and 
industrial areas, coupled with the propagation of the signal to a receiving antenna, 
may result in an integrated MMN level that varies with location and time. This 
may be quantified statistically and used as a fundamental system design and 
planning parameter. By its very nature, however, such noise is dramatically non-
stationary. 
Other MMN sources not considered above include: 
 
 
Radiation from computing and telecommunications equipment;  
 
Unwanted (spurious) emissions from radio communication equipment. 
 
These sources often carry the appellation electromagnetic interference (EMI), also 
called radio frequency interference (RFI). They may exhibit discrete emissions on 
specific frequencies or across a frequency band. It is unclear, however, what their 
contribution to the background MMN level would be. These emissions are often 
regulated and covered by dictated specifications in a military setting. The 
analysis/design considerations that include EMI concerns are referred to as 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). It is often the case that many such 
electronic equipment are in close proximity to one another and this equipment 
must be able to function in the midst of noise energy from other devices. 
The effects of all these noise sources on radio communications may be 
overcome locally if the specific source can be identified. This may not be possible, 
however, for noise from telecommunication networks where the ubiquity of the 
wired network used for distribution may prevent avoidance action. Where an 
individual source cannot be identified, these unwanted signal sources may set an 
MMN background level. However, emissions from these unwanted and 
unintentional sources, which may have Gaussian noise characteristics in some 
cases, may make the interpretation of field noise measurements difficult. 
Furthermore, in an EW setting, it is typically unknown a priori where the system is 
to be placed in an urban environment, so the sources of noise are likewise 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
72
unknown a priori. Attempts to control the noise sources by preemption are likely 
to be unsuccessful.  
In all developed countries there are limits imposed on noise contribution of 
devices and, in particular, man-made devices. In the United States, those limits are 
established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC uses 
two categories of digital devices to establish unintentional radiation limits. Class A 
devices are intended for use in commercial or industrial settings, while class B 
devices are intended for home use. The limits on radiation from any digital device 
are documented in Chapter 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 15, 
specifically 15.109. The limits for class A devices are given in Table 2.2. Related 
international standards are similar to those given in Table 2.2. Most EW systems 
are very sensitive devices, with system sensitivity goals on the order of                
1–10 V m–1. In urban areas where there are many man-made devices, probably 
the most prolific being luminaries, the noise field strengths add. So even though 
the field strengths listed in Table 2.2 are specified at 30 m distance, there are so 
many of them, the noise fields in urban terrain are very strong. 
The characteristic nature of the majority of MMN sources is that they are 
impulsive, as is atmospheric noise. Furthermore, the energy distribution may not 
be Gaussian. This has been tackled (when considering atmospheric noise due to 
lightning) by providing estimates of the median noise power and then by applying 
a bandwidth-dependent parameter to describe the amplitude probability 
distribution (APD). 
The above approach may be suitable at lower frequencies (HF), where a 
median level can be measured, but may not be appropriate at VHF and higher 
frequencies. At these frequencies semi-impulsive peak levels may affect system 
performance even though the measured median level is below the internal noise 
level. Consequently, it is likely that the bandwidth parameter used to describe the 
non-Gaussian nature of the noise may not be adequate, particularly for wide-
bandwidth systems. 
Another approach is based on the assumption that at VHF the noise sources are 
purely impulsive and that the noise amplitude distribution (NAD) essentially 
describes the number of impulses with specified amplitude [24]. 
Yet another approach is to model impulsive noise as an alpha-stable process. 
Such stochastic processes have higher probability distribution tails, which permit

higher probabilities for larger noise energies than does a Gaussian assumption for 
the energy distribution. We discuss alpha-stable processes at the end of this 
chapter.  
 
2.8.3 Vehicle Ignition Systems 
 
In urban settings a very significant source of MMN is the ignitions in vehicles 
with internal combustion engines. Of course, the urban core is the place in a city 
where this problem would be the worst, exacerbated by the density of vehicles. As 
we move away from the core through the core periphery into the urban sprawl, this 
problem reduces. Of course, there are exceptions to this—rush hour, for example. 
Automotive ignitions are not the only sources of MMN, albeit in urban areas 
where there is considerable road traffic, it is one of the major ones. MMN, arising 
due to a variety of emissions from electrical discharges and other sources, may set 
a higher background limit than natural and internal noise. Because this IN source 
is so prevalent, we begin our discussion of MMN with that topic. 
 
2.8.3.1 Mechanical 
 
Taking ignition systems as an example, the sequence of events that leads to 
radiated interference is that (typically) initially contact breaker points open, 
interrupting the flow of current in the primary of the ignition coil and inducing a 
voltage of about 15 kV in the secondary (Figure 2.38). This 15 kV is sufficient to 
break down the air in the spark plug gap. The spark typically lasts for less than a 
microsecond and sustains a time-varying current, which is a function of various 
resonances (from parasitic inductances and capacitances), in the (mainly) high-
voltage wiring. Thus, the pulse has an oscillatory component. 
The spark pulse shown in Figure 2.39 and the two-sided spectrum in Figure 
2.40 are for illustrative purposes. Actual pulses will differ in scale and detail from 
these illustrations. For example, the electrical interference bandwidths could 
exceed hundreds of Megahertz. MMN has been detected at frequencies up to 7 
GHz [24]. 
 
2.8.3.2 Solid State 
 
Even though automotive ignition systems have for the most part moved away from 
the distributor and rotor concept to solid state ignitions, there are still several man-
made devices that utilize the old techniques. The lawn mower is a good example. 
Even so, the spark itself is a source of radiation and even with solid state ignitions 
there is still the requirement for spark plugs (see Figure 2.41). 
Solid state is a broad term applied to any engine’s ignition system that uses 
electronic devices such as diodes, transistors, silicon controlled rectifiers, or other 
semiconductors in place of one or more standard ignition components.

Electronic components are extremely small, have no moving parts, require no 
mechanical adjustments, are not subjected to wear, as with mechanical devices, 
deliver uniform performance throughout component life and under adverse 
operating conditions, and can be hermetically sealed, thus unaffected by dust, dirt, 
oil, or moisture. 
The capacitor discharge system illustrated in Figure 2.41 is breaker-less, with 
an electronic component replacing the mechanical points and related accessories 
(breaker cam, spark advance assembly, and so forth). The flywheel contains 
permanent magnets, but there are no other moving mechanical parts. 
The magnet on the flywheel induces a secondary current in the charge coil and 
trigger coil as it moves past the coils shown. The charge coil facilitates charging 
the capacitor while the trigger coil triggers the SCR, causing current to flow in the 
primary of the spark coil. 
The silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) shown in Figure 2.41 is a form of 
diode. It does not conduct current until it is triggered. The idealized voltages and 
currents shown on the right in Figure 2.41 explain the operation of the ignition 
system. The voltage across the charge coil is zero until the magnet mounted on the 
flywheel (there would be one for each spark plug) passes by the coil. When it 
passes by, it induces a magnetic field in the charge coil that causes a current to 
flow in it. This causes the capacitor to charge to a level determined by the physical 
size of the components involved. Once the magnet passes the charge coil, the 
capacitor voltage will remain at the level shown since the SCR is off and no 
current is flowing in the primary of the spark transformer. The upper diode keeps 
the charge from leaking off back through the charge coil. When a second magnet 
passes the trigger coil, a current is induced in it which causes a voltage to be 
developed at the trigger of the SCR. This short pulse causes the SCR to begin 
conducting and the capacitor rapidly discharges through the primary of the spark 
coil, through the SCR to ground. This current induces a large voltage in the 
secondary of the spark coil, which, in turn, causes the spark plug to fire. 
So, some of the emission sources in the mechanical ignition system have been 
removed, thereby quieting the system down somewhat. There are, however, ample 
sources of possible emissions in the solid state ignition. The spark plug still has to 
fire to do its job. There is a large secondary voltage in the solid state ignition, just 
as there is in the mechanical ignition. This will radiate noise. Finally, just as in the 
mechanical ignition system, the discharge capacitor will radiate as well. 
 
2.8.4 Fluorescent Lighting 
 
Another source of significant MMN in urban settings is fluorescent lighting, an 
example of the larger categorization with the appellation discharge lighting. 
Discharge lighting consists of fluorescent lamps, neon advertising signs, neon and 
argon glow lamps, mercury and sodium lamps, mercury-arc lamps, and carbon arc 
lights, among others. All discharge lighting luminaries work on the same basic 

Detection of Signals in Noise 
77
principles—we will discuss fluorescent lighting and, in particular, the relatively 
new compact fluorescent lights (CFL). Discharge lighting is very prolific in urban 
settings, especially in the concentrated urban core. 
 
2.8.4.1 Fluorescent Lamp Basics 
 
The fluorescent lamp was the first major advance to be a commercial success in 
small-scale lighting since the tungsten incandescent bulb. Its greatly increased 
efficiency resulted in cool (temperature wise) brightly lit workplaces (offices and 
factories) as well as home kitchens and baths. The development of the mercury 
vapor high intensity discharge (HID) lamp actually predates the fluorescent (the 
latter being introduced commercially in 1938, four years after the HID). However, 
HID type lamps have only relatively recently become popular in small sizes for 
task lighting in the home and office; yard and security area lighting; and light 
source applications in overhead, computer, and video projectors, all of which are 
extremely prolific in urban settings [25]. 
Like neon signs and mercury or sodium vapor street or yard lights, fluorescent 
lamps are a type of gas discharge tube. A small amount of mercury along with 
some inert gases (usually argon) at very low pressure are sealed inside a glass 
tube. A pair of electrodes, one at each end, are also sealed in the tube. A phosphor 
coating is applied to the inside of the tube, which produces visible light when 
excited with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The electrodes are filaments that are used 
at start up and remain hot during normal operation as a result of the gas discharge  
When power is first applied, a high voltage (several hundred volts) is needed to 
initiate the discharge. However, once this occurs, a much lower voltage—usually 
under 100V for tubes under 30W, 100 to 175V for 30W or more—is needed to 
maintain it.  
The electric current passing through the low-pressure gases emits considerable 
UV, but not much visible light. The gas discharge radiation is almost entirely 
mercury radiation, although the gas mixture is mostly inert gas and generally only 
around 1% mercury vapor. The internal phosphor coating converts most of the UV 
to visible light. The mix of the phosphors is used to color the light spectrum to the 
intended application. Thus, there are cool white, warm white, colored, and black 
light fluorescent lamps. 
At the wavelengths that are useful to humans, fluorescent lamps are about two 
to four times as efficient as incandescent lamps at producing light. Thus, they run 
cooler and consume less power for the same effective light output. They also last 
considerably longer—10,000 to 20,000 hours versus 1,000 hours for a typical 
incandescent. However, for certain types of ballasts, this is only achieved if the 
fluorescent lamp is left on for long periods of time without frequent on-off cycles. 
A picture of a CFL is shown in Figure 2.42. It consists of three basic parts: the 
base that screws into the socket, the electronics that is diagrammed in Figure 2.43,

and the bulb itself. To dim these bulbs, the frequency at which they are switched is 
increased to keep the efficiency up. That dictates the necessity for the circuitry 
shown in Figure 2.43. While the switching DC power supplies for these bulbs 
operate generally below about 100 kHz, significant radiated harmonics of this 
switching extends well into the UHF frequency range.  
 
2.8.4.2 Fluorescent Light Noise 
 
The spectra of typical RF noise emitted by compact fluorescent lightbulbs in a test 
in India in 2009 are shown in Figurers 2.44 and 2.45. This data was taken in a 
chamber that was isolated from outside signals, so was at a relatively short range. 
It can be seen, however, that this particular test sample violated the FCC emission 
limits at both the low end and the high end of the frequency range, and emitted 
considerable noise power. It would not take too many of these lights in proximity 
to an EW system in an urban environment to render the system inoperative. 
 
2.8.5 Microwave Oven Noise 
 
By definition, the common microwave oven emits radiation, albeit it is supposed 
to stay inside the unit. Invariably some escapes, however, and the escaping amount 
tolerated is controlled by government regulation primarily for safety reasons. 
Microwave ovens operate anywhere in the ISM frequency bands where the 
radiation is unlicensed, located around 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, and 60 GHz. 
The radiation levels, however, are regulated to limit the amount of interference. 
The internationally agreed upon ISM bands are given in Table 2.3. 
The radiation limits in the United States, as established by the FCC are: the 
field intensity (mW cm–2) at a distance of 5 cm from the unit must be less than 1 
mW cm–2 prior to sale and less than 5 mW cm–2 installed. The 5 mW cm–2 is the 
human exposure safety limit at 2 GHz and above as established by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard C9C.1-1982 [28]. This equates to an 
E-field of approximately 1.4 V cm–1 for installed microwave ovens. Note that most 
leakage is less than 0.2 mW cm–2 (0.3 V cm–1), so the typical situation is much less 
than the regulation requires. Nevertheless, these values of field strength are very 
high and can cause significant problems for sensitive EW systems, particularly 
because the signals from these noise sources are independent and therefore add 
together. In addition, weak, distant target signals would be completely masked by 
such high signal levels. 
 
2.8.6 Electric Motor Noise 
 
DC electric motors, such as those found in industrial sections of urban areas, are a 
prime  source  of  radiated  noise. When  an electrical motor runs,  the commutator

switches the direction of the electricity that flows in the windings (see Figure 
2.46). 
Though the system keeps the motor running, an occasional spark occurs 
between brushes and the commutator at the time of the commutation. This spark is 
one of the causes of the electrical noise. In addition, when the motor starts from a  
stalled position, a comparably higher current, or a stall current, flows into the 
windings. In most cases, the higher current causes higher noise levels. 
Another factor that causes noise in electrical motors is unintentional insulation 
that forms on the commutator surface, which results in unstable flow of electricity. 
This insulation causes current flow that is uneven across the surface of the 
commutator. 
Fortunately, most motors that are used in heavy manufacturing are AC 
induction motors. These motors work on the principle of induction between the 
stator (nonmoving) coils and the commutator (rotating) coils. They do not have 
brushes, so the continuous making and breaking of contact between two surfaces is 
avoided. Due to this, they do not generate RFI. 
 
2.8.7 Welder Noise 
 
RF-stabilized arc welders or resistance welders are commonly used to weld 
metallic parts in industrial production. Each device uses intense heat generated by 
passing large electric currents through the weld point with electrodes. The

electrodes of resistance welders are in physical contact with the weld, providing a 
continuous metal path for current flow. Electrodes of an RF-stabilized arc welder, 
however, do not make direct contact with the work. In RF-stabilized welders, a 
high-frequency medium current signal is added to either a direct or 60 Hz high 
power source of welding current, which ionizes a gaseous plasma between the 
electrodes and weld. The high electrical conductivity of the plasma formed in a 
chemically inert gas surrounding the weld provides a low impedance path for flow 
of the large direct or 60 Hz welding current without the necessity of metal-to-
metal contact, thereby substantially reducing the possibility of weld 
contamination. 
A spark-gap oscillator is used in RF-stabilized welders to produce a high-
frequency current of approximately 2 A. The HF band frequency spectrum 
generated by the spark gap is superimposed upon the primary welding current. A 
broadband current modulation is created, which radiates into the surrounding 
space via the plasma arc, the welding electrodes, the power supply connecting 
leads, and imperfections in the shields and grounds of the spark-gap oscillator. A 
series of measurements performed on a representative RF-stabilized arc welder 
using a vertically polarized antenna and peak-envelope detector at an observation 
distance of 100 ft are presented in Figure 2.47. The resulting spectrum, although 
continuous, was highly serrated; in plotting Figure 2.47 only the major features of 
the data have been reproduced. Mounting, housing, and model design details have 
a significant effect upon the radiated spectrum of welders of this category. The 
primary maxima occur in the lower portion of the HF band, somewhere between 1 
and 2 MHz. Subsidiary maxima lie in the upper portion of the HF band, 
approximately at 20 to 30 MHz. It has been observed that the construction of the 
 
 
Figure 2.46 Noise occurs in a DC motor when the brush makes and breaks contact with the 
conducting commutator. 

Detection of Signals in Noise 
83
surrounding building walls, the electrical grounding, and the presence of power 
lines contribute significantly to the propagation and attenuation of the welder-
generated RF noise. 
The necessary current density in electrical resistance welders is produced by 
applying pressure to the electrodes that is sufficient to puncture the insulating 
surface film and thereby produce 50 or 60 Hz short-circuit currents exceeding 10 
kA. Several hundred pounds of pressure are typically applied though the 
electrodes simultaneously with the heating current. 
Noise field strength measurements were performed on a representative 
example of resistance welder in the frequency range from 14 kHz to 1 GHz. The 
observed radiated noise spectra are impulsive and thus broadband. Results 
measured at distances of 6, 30, and 1,000 ft from a 150 kW production welder 
used in automotive vehicle manufacture are plotted in Figure 2.48 for horizontally 
oriented, linearly polarized receiving antennas. The resulting noise field strength is 
seen to remain appreciable at least to a range of 1,000 ft. 
The levels of noise exhibited in Figure 2.48, at 1,000 ft—on the order of        
40 – 90 dBV/m/MHz—are sufficient to totally saturate an EW system that may be in 
the surrounding area. This is especially true if the target signal is wideband 
CDMA, the bandwidth of which is on the order of 1–5 MHz. Typical sensitivities 
for EW receiving systems are 1–10 V m–1. So, a 40 dBV/m/MHz signal at 1 GHz, 
with a bandwidth of 1 MHz, produces a signal with E-field strength 102 V m–1,

10–100 times the sensitivity of the receiving system. Distant target signals will be 
completely masked by this interference. 
 
2.8.8 Relay Noise 
 
Mechanical relays are a very common and versatile method for switching a variety 
of electrical signals and power. The mechanical contacts in relays provide good 
isolation between the circuits activating them and the signals being switched, and 
can often handle large amounts of current. However, there are some effects related  
to mechanical contacts that produce RFI, particularly when they are switching 
power [31]. 
SCRs are also used to switch power on and off. However, there are no 
mechanical contacts in such configurations, so the noise produced by SCR 
switches, if there is any at all, is substantially weaker. 
  
2.8.8.1 Contact Wear, Arcing, and Noise 
 
Just as with any mechanical device, every time the contacts of a mechanical relay 
or switch are closed or open, there is a certain amount of wear (see Figure 2.49). 
For a very brief time, only a small section of the contact is touching, and all of the 
current must go through this part of the contact. If the current being switched is

large, part of the contact is degraded or destroyed. In addition, because there is a 
very small gap in the contacts for a brief time when the contacts are broken, an 
electrical arc may be generated across the gap if the voltage is high enough. This 
arc will produce RFI. A large industrial complex can use many such relays to 
control machines on manufacturing lines.  
How much wear on the contacts and how much RFI and noise generated 
depends on:  
 
The voltage and current being switched;  
 
Whether the voltage being switched is AC or DC;  
 
The type of load (resistive versus inductive);  
 
How quickly the relay operates (how long the contact area and gap are 
small);  
 
What type of contact protection or arc and noise suppression circuitry is 
used; 
 
Many other secondary factors, such as system wiring, grounding, and so 
forth.  
 
In addition to RFI generated upon the closing or opening of the relay contacts, 
the wear mentioned due to the particularly large currents over a small surface 
degrades the electrical conductivity of the surface. Over time, this alone will cause 
the relay to emit additional RFI. 
 
2.8.9 Characteristics and Impact of Man-Made Noise 
 
2.8.9.1 Characteristics of Man-Made Noise 
 
We will consider the power as a function of filter bandwidth for IN. For IN, the 
single pulse has a frequency spectrum that has a phase that changes slowly with 
frequency. Consequently, the voltage out of a filter depends on the filter 
bandwidth, provided the filter bandwidth is much less than the impulse spectral 
bandwidth. Consequently, there is a 6 dB change in instantaneous power from the 
 
Figure 2.49 Relay noise. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
86
filter, within the impulse time, for every doubling of filter bandwidth. This 6 dB 
change occurs approximately up to the bandwidth occupied by the pulse. Beyond 
this bandwidth, the noise power out of the filter is approximately constant.  
On the other hand, for AWGN, the frequency spectrum components have 
random phase with a decorrelation frequency roughly the inverse of the time- 
domain waveform duration. Thus, beyond the coherence bandwidth, the power out 
of the filter changes by 3 dB for every doubling of the filter bandwidth. 
Furthermore, provided that the AWGN is white so that the PSD is approximately a 
constant spanning the entire real frequency axis, the power out of the filter will 
continue to rise with increasing filter bandwidth. 
The instantaneous total power out of the filter will be a combination of the 
powers from IN and AWGN as depicted in Figure 2.50. In Figure 2.50 the noise 
power is shown for a filter for different bandwidths in a constant noise 
environment comprising AWGN from a thermal origin, and IN. The intercepts on 
the ordinate are arbitrary and depend, inter alia, on the noise figure of the 
receiving system and the strength of the IN environment. For reasonable 
combinations of IN and AWGN, there will be a characteristic ―knee,‖ as seen in 
Figure 2.50, corresponding to the matching of the filter bandwidth to the IN pulse 
bandwidth. Hence, as the filter bandwidth is increased, the response will rise at 
either 3 dB or 6 dB per doubling of bandwidth depending on whether AWGN or 
IN dominates. The relative strength of the two components is reflected in the 
vertical translation of one curve relative to the other. If AWGN is dominant, the 
filter response will change by 3 dB per octave bandwidth. If IN is dominant, the 
 
Figure 2.50 Noise power at the output of a filter. 

Detection of Signals in Noise 
87
filter response will initially change by 6 dB per octave bandwidth followed by no 
increase beyond the knee point. 
The output of a filter is a function of the filter bandwidth. As illustrated in 
Figure 2.50, starting at the narrowest bandwidth, if AWGN is dominant, the 
impulse noise will not be visible. As the bandwidth of the filter is increased, the IN 
increases at 6 dB per octave bandwidth so that, at some stage, the IN will dominate 
over the AWGN since the latter is increasing at 3 dB per octave. At this point, the 
IN will be visible as a series of short pulses above the AWGN and each of 
duration of approximately 1/W, where W is the bandwidth of the filter (in hertz). 
As the bandwidth of the filter is increased further, there comes a point when the 
AWGN again dominates over the IN and, at that stage, the IN is no longer visible 
above the AWGN. 
When detecting IN using a filter, one with as little ringing as possible avoids 
the possibility of mistaken identification of additional pulses. Filters with a 
Gaussian passband have a single pulse impulse response.  
 
2.8.9.2 Impact of Impulsive Noise on Digital Communications Systems 
 
A digital RF communications system is comprised of a transmit system, a 
propagation channel, and a receive system. The interference is typically injected 
when the signal is propagated, but can be generated local to the receiver (e.g., 
when the receiver is mounted in a vehicle). What is at issue here is the 
performance of the receive system in the presence of the combination of AWGN 
and IN. The effects of intentional jamming interference are discussed in Chapters 
8 and 10–14. 
In general, a receiver in a digital communication system is comprised of a 
number of stages corresponding to different types of processing as shown in Table 
2.4. Depending on the strength of the IN, it could impact the RF and IF stages. 
This may manifest itself in variations in AGC, loss of carrier, and loss of 
synchronization. It is assumed here that the IN is within one or two orders of 
magnitude of the thermal noise. 
In the case of CDMA, the despreading process may change the characteristics 
of the IN. However, if the IN is very wideband, then the correlation of an impulse

with a pseudo-random spreading code will have little effect on the shape of the 
impulse. Since the impulse is unlikely to coincide with a transition of the 
spreading code, it will emerge from the product process relatively unaltered. 
In the case of FHSS, due to the wide instantaneous bandwidth of the IN, it is 
likely to be present in most of the hops. Hence, the impact of IN is to add to the 
level of AWGN present which primarily impacts the detection performance. Since 
most FHSS systems employ MFSK (BFSK is the most common), the resulting 
performance can be determined by examining the BER performance curves plotted 
against the SNR where the noise is the combined noise of both sources. 
At any instant of time, the output of the matched filters will include: 
 
 
The signal; 
 
The IN; 
 
The AWGN. 
 
The signal and the AWGN will be continuously present, whereas the IN will be 
output for a period after an impulse is received. At the sampling instant, there will 
be a combination of all three sources. The combined voltage is compared to a 
threshold in order to estimate the symbol that is present. In the case of PSK, the in-
phase and quadrature filter outputs are normally converted into an amplitude and 
phase. The symbol is detected based on the region occupied by the tip of the 
complex signal phasor. In the case of QPSK, the complex plane is divided into 
four equal sectors. For BPSK there are two equal sectors. 
What matters is the amplitude of the IN and AWGN components in the 
matched filter bandwidth compared to the amplitude of the signal component. The 
RMS AWGN power is given by the noise power spectral density in the bandwidth 
of the matched filter. The PDF of the AWGN amplitude is Rayleigh distributed, 
and the decorrelation time is on the order of the filter impulse response time 
(symbol duration). Provided that the symbol duration is much greater than the 
individual noise impulse duration, the amplitude of the IN component is 
proportional to the matched filter bandwidth and the RMS IN power is 
proportional to the square of the matched filter bandwidth. Individual power 
considerations aside, the characteristics of the IN and the AWGN in the 
demodulator are essentially indistinguishable. This point is illustrated by Figure 
2.51 and Figure 2.52, which compare the autocorrelation of the noise output from 
a square-root raised cosine matched filter for AWGN and IN. It can be seen from 
the figures that the responses are nearly identical. 
Thus, we see that the total power of the IN and AWGN in the demodulator 
bandwidth affects the performance of the demodulator. However, it should be 
noted that the IN will only affect the output while the IN is present on the input 
and the AWGN is there all the time.

There are other demodulation issues for IN. The matched filter will ―ring‖ 
from a noise impulse. This means that the noise will impact on the demodulation 
of following symbols, the number and characteristics of which are dependent on 
the strength of the IN and the ringing characteristics of the filter. Figure 2.53 
shows the pulse output from a matched filter for an IN pulse and illustrates how 
the response spreads out over time. It should be noted that, although the matched 
filters are generally designed to reduce ISI, this relies on the timing of the data and 
the zero ISI will not apply to the IN contribution, which can arise at random times. 
  We assume that the IN arrives at the receiver at a random time, at a random 
amplitude, but with an average repetition rate. It is further assumed that the 
presence of the impulse within the demodulation filter bandwidth will result in 
data errors. The impact of the impulse depends on a range of factors such as 
whether interleaving is present and the type of encoding (if any) that is present on 
the system. 
However, given that a single impulse affects a limited number of symbols, it 
follows that the symbol error rate is proportional to the number of impulses per 
second. Note that this is not the symbol error rate, in the conventional sense, in 
that conventional error rate is expressed as the fraction of symbols in error or bits 
compared to the total number of symbols, or bits transmitted. Hence, symbol error 
rate (SER) due to impulse noise is given by:

where Rl is the rate of impulses per second and Rs is the symbol rate. 
 
2.8.9.3 Noise Environment Relation to Receiver Performance 
 
The MMN environment is normally characterized by the NAD. The NAD is 
expressed in terms of the ―spectrum amplitude‖ (in dBV/MHz) against the average 
number of noise pulses per second. 
A typical receiver unit of a radio communication system consists of an 
antenna, coupled to a bandpass filter, followed by an LNA. The LNA is followed 
by downconversion mixing to a lower IF frequency, followed by further 
amplification, before symbol estimation and other processing steps. As discussed 
in Section 2.5, the noise figure arises from the excess noise contributed by the 
receiver chain.  
 
2.8.9.4 Summary 
 
A fundamental characteristic of IN is that the single pulse has a spectrum that has 
a phase that changes slowly with frequency. For IN pulses that are within some 
small orders of magnitude of the thermal noise level, the demodulation 
performance of a digital receiver will depend on the total power of the IN and 
AWGN in the demodulator bandwidth. For strong IN, the ―ringing‖ characteristic 
of the demodulator filter can cause multiple symbol errors. However, the base is a 
single symbol error for each impulse. It is expected that the error rate will be 
inversely proportional to the symbol, or bit rate, for a fixed number of pulses of IN 
per second.

 Although the impulse function is a 
simple representation of an IN event, it is too much of an idealization for our 
purposes. This is because if it equals ―1,‖ the impulse function will contain all 
frequencies in equal measure. Because of its short duration, we expect an IN to 
have a wide, but not infinite, bandwidth.

We have assumed that the filter is causal (which all real filters are), which implies 
that h() = 0 for  < 0, with the zero as the lower integration limit. We know that if 
g1 and g2 are functions that vanish outside the intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] 
respectively, then g1* g2 vanishes outside the interval [a1 + a2, b1 + b2]. Thus, if the

bandwidth, Z(f ) is well spread out and Y(f ) will probably occupy most or all of 
the bandwidth of H(f ). 
 
2.8.10.5 Impulsive Noise Analysis Using Wavelets 
 
Another useful characterization of individual noise impulses involves the use of 
wavelets. We present a brief outline of such characterizations here.

As illustrated in Figure 2.54, j,k is obtained by scaling the basic function and 
shifting/translating this scaled version along the t-axis. If  is a special kind of 
function called a wavelet, then every square integrable function can be expanded 
in terms of the set of translated and scaled wavelets j,k. In other words, if g(t) is 
square integrable, then there is a sequence of coefficients cj,k such that

2.8.10.6 Analysis of Noise Using Wavelets 
 
A real noise impulse has finite duration and limited amplitude. In fact, since 
physics dictates that it is physically impossible to have a truly discontinuous 
change from one voltage level V1 to a distinct voltage level V2, a noise waveform, 

Detection of Signals in Noise

just like any other real waveform, must be continuous. We can therefore conclude 
that noise impulses are amenable to modeling with wavelets. 
If z(t) is a noise signal with wavelet transform

then the set of coefficients {cj,k} contain enough information to perfectly 
reconstruct the signal z(t). In general, the sequence {cj,k} may have infinitely many 
nonzero terms, but z(t) can be approximated to arbitrary precision with a finite 
number of terms. Furthermore, efficient algorithms exist for computing the 
coefficients from a sampled signal.  
Many wavelets systems exist and some of these have very different 
characteristics. In particular, some wavelets are smooth and can be differentiable 
to any required order while other wavelets have a noise-like character. These 
noise-like wavelets are an approach for characterizing the structure of noise. One 
set of wavelets often used to characterize noise, and in particular MMN, is the 
Daubechies wavelets, some of which are illustrated in Figure 2.55.  
 
2.8.11 Man-Made Noise Power 
 
In this section, we provide a discussion of MMN power in various settings. This 
information was compiled by the ITU Radio Communications Study Group in 
2005. 
 
2.8.11.2 Median Values of MMN Power 
 
Median values of MMN power for a number of environments are shown in Figure 
2.56, which also includes a curve for galactic noise. In all cases, results are 
consistent with a linear variation of the median value, Fam, with frequency f of the 
form

(2.158) is not valid in the range 0.3 to 250 MHz for all the environment categories 
except those of curves D and E as indicated in the figure. 
For the business, residential, and rural categories, the average over the above 
frequency range of the decile deviations of noise power with time, DU, and DL, is 
given in Table 2.6, which also provides values of the deviation with location. It 
may be assumed that these variations are uncorrelated and that log-normal half 
distributions each side of the median are appropriate. These values were measured

generate the MMN. 
An analysis of available measurement data for business areas in the frequency

At VHF, a significant component of MMN is due to ignition impulses from 
motor vehicles. For this contribution noise may be present as an impulsive NAD 
(the impulsive noise spectrum amplitude as a function of impulse rate). 
 
2.8.11.3 Modeling the Noise Amplitude Distribution 
 
Hagn and Sailors [33] examined four approaches to the representation of the NAD. 
Of the four they considered, the one that is used most is the composite Gaussian 
model discussed next.

IN Noise Amplitude Distribution 
 
For MMN, noise may be presented as an impulsive NAD (the impulsive noise 
spectrum amplitude as a function of impulse rate). Figure 2.57 is an example of 
the noise amplitude distribution at 150 MHz for three categories of motor vehicle 
density. For frequencies other than 150 MHz, raise or lower curves H, M, and L in

Summary 
 
Some models and the techniques used to represent IN have been described. MMN 
is the prevalent noise in urban environments, and such noise has a distinctive 
impulsive nature to it. IN does not possess the same PDF characteristic as thermal 
noise, and its effects are different. 
The noise power, while needed to determine the SNR, for example, is seldom 
sufficient to determine system performance (white Gaussian background noise 
being the only exception). Appropriate probabilistic descriptions of the impulsive 
nature of the received random noise waveform are required.  
 
2.8.12 Alpha-Stable Processes 
 
2.8.12.1 Introduction 
 
Since it is made up of many impulsive time functions, MMN is typically modeled 
as having Gaussian PDF. However, some of the impulses are of significant 
 
 
Figure 2.57 Noise amplitude distribution at 150MHz. H: high noise location (V = 100), M: moderate 
noise location (V = 10), L: low noise location (V = 1). (Source: [22].)

amplitude—more than would be accurately predicted by a Gaussian PDF. In order 
to incorporate these seemingly out-of-place large amplitude impulses into the 
model of MMN, a PDF based on an alpha-stable process can be used [34]. Even 
though these noise sources may not follow Gaussian statistics exactly, their PDFs 
are 
symmetric. 
Symmetric 
alpha-stable 
(SS) 
processes 
have 
special 
characteristics, and we summarize them in this section. 
Heavier tails in the PDF allow for higher probabilities of large-amplitude noise 
admitting impulsive noise with significant amplitudes. Atmospheric noise and 
MMN are not Gaussian but can be modeled as alpha-stable processes [34], but 
these produce symmetric PSD. An alpha-stable process with symmetric PSDs is 
called symmetric alpha-stable and denoted by SS. The spectra for a few standard 
alpha-stable processes are shown in Figure 2.58. The tails of alpha-stable 
processes are heavier than Gaussian (SS with  = 2) as shown in Figure 2.59.  
The following definition is from [34].

The location parameter is a, the scale parameter (also called the dispersion) is 
, the index of skewness is , and the characteristic exponent is . A small positive 
value of  indicates severe impulsiveness, while a value of  close to 2 indicates a 
more Gaussian type of behavior. When  = 2, the stable distribution reduces to the 
Gaussian distribution.

except for  = 2 which is the Gaussian case, the Cauchy case ( = 1,  = 0), and 
the Pearson case ( = ½,  = –1). There are power series expansions of stable

2.8.12.2 Statistical Modeling with Non-Gaussian Stable Distributions 
 
 
The stable distribution has the characteristic called the stability property, which 
states that the sum of two independent stable random variables with the same 
characteristic exponent is also stable and has the same characteristic exponent. 
Furthermore, the stable distribution is the only probability distribution that has this 
property [34]. 
 
2.8.12.3 Stable Signal Processing with Fractional Lower-Order Moments 
 
From the signal processing point of view, the adoption of a stable model for noise 
has important consequences. As mentioned, for a non-Gaussian stable distribution 
with a characteristic exponent , only moments of order less than  exist. In 
particular, the variance (i.e., the second-order moment) of a stable distribution 
with a < 2 does not exist, making the use of variance as a measure of dispersion 
meaningless. 
The absence of finite variance does not mean, however, that there are no other 
adequate measures of variability of stable random variables. The dispersion of a 
stable random variable plays an analogous role to the variance. For example, the 
larger the dispersion of a stable distribution, the more it spreads around its median. 
Hence, the minimum dispersion criterion becomes the ―equivalent‖ of the 
minimum variance measure of optimality in stable signal processing. It minimizes 
the spread of the distribution about the median value. 
Minimizing the dispersion is also equivalent to minimizing the fractional 
lower-order moments of estimation errors, which measure the Lp distance between 
an estimate and its true value, for 
2.
p 
 This result is not surprising since the 
Lp norm with p < 2 is well known for being robust against outliers such as those 
that may be described by the stable law.

2.8.12.4 Extension to Bivariate Random Variables 
 
The notions expressed above for a single SS r.v. can be extended to bivariate 
(and higher) r.v.s. Let y1 and y2 denote two such r.v.s. The joint PDF of y1 and y2 
can be determined from the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of their characteristic 
function [35]

The second of these, when  = 2, is the (bivariate) Gaussian PDF. The first, when 
 = 1, is called the Cauchy distribution. The smaller  is, the more impulsive the 
underlying function is.  
 
2.8.13 Summary 
 
We presented considerable detail in this section on the principal sources of noise 
in an urban environment. The predominant sources below about 1 GHz are all 
produced by humans and thus called man-made noise, with vehicle ignitions and 
discharge lighting perhaps the worst offenders. EW systems are very sensitive 
because they must frequently collect signals from a considerable distance. The 
additive effects of the MMN in urban settings could very well preclude these 
systems from functioning properly. 
 
A better environmental noise model in an urban setting is to model the noise 
as SS processes rather than AWGN. These processes have heavier tails and thus 
admit to higher probabilities of noise impulses with significant amplitudes. 

Detection of Signals in Noise 
109
Adopting such allows for more accurate characterization of the surrounding noise 
fields and helps to understand the difficulties of EW operations in urban terrain.  
 
 
2.9 Effects of Impulsive Noise on Signal Detection 
 
2.9.1 Introduction 
 
As discussed above, the primary type of noise in urban environments is due to 
man-made sources and the PDF for that noise is not accurately modeled as 
Gaussian. Rather, the noise more accurately is modeled as an alpha-stable process 
and, in particular, as an SS. The effects of modeling MMN in this way was first 
examined by Tsihrintzis and Nikias [36] where the thermal noise was not included 
on the assumption that the SS noise level is much larger. Ambike, Ilow, and 
Hatzinakos [37] determined the performance effects on binary antipodal (symbol 
 {+1, –1}) signals when the thermal noise is included along with the SS noise. 
We will examine this approach in this section to determine the effects of both 
types of noise by comparing the performance of an optimal (nonlinear) receiver 
with the conventional linear receiver. This discussion is based largely on [37]. 
We assume that the data on which our detectors operate are discrete 
sequences. The received sequence, after being demodulated and sampled K times 
per symbol, can be written as

is the transmitted antipodal signal during one symbol interval, 
and {nG(k)} and {n(k)} are zero-mean Gaussian and SS noise components, 
respectively. It is assumed that 1
2

 to ensure the existence of the mean. The 
symbol detection is on a symbol-by-symbol basis since the symbols are 
equiprobable. We assume that both noise components are stationary sequences 
over the time interval of concern, that are i.i.d. (within their own sequence; they 
are not identically distributed between each other—the PDF of the one sequence is 
Gaussian, while the other is SS) and independent of each other and the signal. 
The SS r.v. with zero-mean is defined through its characteristic function (2.163) 
with a = 0. Since we have assumed that {nG(k)} and {n(k)} are independent, the 
characteristic function of the total additive noise is

2.9.2 Receiver Structures 
 
The detector is a nonlinearity followed by an accumulator (integrator in discrete 
form) and a threshold comparator. Here we will examine the performance of 
 
 
The optimal Bayes detector given by (2.9); 
 
A linear receiver that is optimal in the presence of Gaussian noise alone; 
 
Locally optimum detectors that can be realistically implemented. 
 
2.9.2.1 Optimal Bayes Receiver

based on the observed samples [x(l), x(2), ..., x(N)] is given as [37]

A numerical and Monte Carlo simulation experiment was documented in [37] 
using symbols that were rectangular pulses with K = 2. Pe is plotted in Figure 2.61

As we can see, as f increases or  decreases, there is more noise in the receiver and 
the detection performance degrades. For Pe = 1.5  10–2, there is approximately a 5 
dB gain in SNR necessary, for the optimum receiver over the linear one. This gain 
increases for more impulsive channels (higher f and lower ). For purely Gaussian 
noise (f = 0), the optimal and linear receivers have the same performance, of 
course.

The simulation results also showed considerable improvements of the non-
linear receivers over the linear ones. For f = 0.5 and  = 1.5 the suboptimum 
receivers demonstrated an SNR performance gain of 3 dB. For more impulsive 
channels (smaller ), even larger gains were demonstrated over the linear receiver.  
 
2.9.4 Summary 
 
We have considered the detection of a binary signal in a mixture of Gaussian and 
SS noise. Linear receivers suffer about a 5 dB performance degradation versus 
optimal nonlinear receivers. The suboptimal but realizable nonlinear receivers 
outperformed the linear receiver by approximately 3 dB. The simulation results 
compare very well with the calculated results. 
 
 
2.10 Concluding Remarks 
 
We have discussed the detection of communication signals in the presence of 
noise in this chapter. We covered the basic properties of statistical signal detection 
theory and the common forms of tests applied to the problem. We also explored 
 
Figure 2.61 Performance of optimal and linear receivers for = 1.5, K = 2. When f = 0 (no impulsive 
noise), the performance of the linear receiver and optimal receiver are the same, denoted by the solid 
line. (Source: [37]. © IEEE 1994. Reprinted with permission.)

the statistical properties of the common types of noise encountered with these 
types of problems. 
 
Next we investigated the detection properties of radiometers. A radiometer is 
a device for measuring the energy content of a signal and, assuming AWGN is the 
type of noise present, it is the optimal energy detector. The classical radiometer 
analysis assumes that the noise is stationary during the measurement process. 
Since this is not always true, we explored the impacts on detectability when the 
background noise changed. 
 
We then had an in-depth discussion of noise sources in urban environments. 
Man-made sources are by far the largest contributors to RF noise in such settings, 
and we indicated that almost all MMN sources are impulsive in nature. That led us 
into a discussion of alpha-stable processes, which have statistical characteristics 
that more closely resemble IN than the Gaussian model does.

Signaling for Modern Communications 
 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
Modern signaling, in particular, AJ techniques, were devised to allow for reliable 
communication even in the presence of noise and interference. Our primary 
interest is when the interference is intentionally placed (i.e., a jammer). How well 
a jammer works against these signals is discussed in Chapter 8 and Chapters 10–
14. It is deemed prudent to first discuss the techniques to facilitate modern 
communications, and such is the subject of this chapter. 
This chapter is structured as follows. We first cover some terminology 
associated with digital communications to include coding techniques, interleaving, 
SNR, and bandwidth. We then discuss the common forms of MPSK with which 
we are concerned and their performance with noise and tone interference. That is 
followed by a discussion of MFSK performance. Next we introduce quadrature 
amplitude modulation (QAM) and study its performance in noise and tone 
interference. Then we delve into the forms of spread spectrum of concern, and, in 
particular, we cover DSSS, FHSS, and THSS (UWB), and hybrids of these. Lastly, 
we present a discussion of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), 
which is an emerging popular form for dealing with ISI on wideband channels. 
 
 
3.2 Signaling 
 
Signaling in this context refers to the method of impressing information onto some 
form of baseband signal, and then placing this signal on the proper carrier for 
transmission. It also includes the reception of the carrier and subsequent extraction 
of the information at a receiver. Thus, it refers to the entire communication process 
over RF transmissions. 
Modulation is the method whereby the carrier signal is modified. It is the 
modulation type that determines, to a large extent, the performance of a particular 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
122
communication technique. In addition, it is the modulation that determines the 
required SNR from the detector at the receiver for a specified BER level of 
performance. Hence, the modulation determines the level of JSR required to 
achieve whatever level of jamming is desired, and so determines many of the 
parameters of an EA system. 
Some of the early FHSS communication systems used analog modulations. 
They used frequency modulation (FM) as their modulation technique. In at least 
one case, the radios were not blanked as they changed frequency, causing some 
strange RF characteristics. Because of the advance of the speed of monolithic 
integrated circuits as well as modern digital signaling technology, all of the current 
important communication systems use some form of digital modulation. Digital 
modulations allow for coding at the source level to remove redundancy and at the 
channel level to facilitate error detection and correction. Such error processing 
increases the system throughput and optimizes channel utilization. All modern 
systems are inherently digital, even if the information-bearing signal is analog. 
The analog signal is first converted to digital for processing and may be converted 
back to analog at the receiver. 
Another technique for countering the deleterious effects of jamming is channel 
coding. Extra bits are added to the transmitted signal with such coding. These bits 
provide redundancy or other mathematical properties that make the signals more 
jam resistant. 
Modulating a carrier may or not be part of the spectrum spreading process. As 
previously mentioned, the vast majority of the modulation techniques used in any 
relevant way are digital. Frequency and phase modulations are those of choice for 
FHSS and DSSS, respectively. The frequency modulation used is normally FSK, 
but it is also possible to use PSK in FHSS systems. Most PSK systems use 
coherent detection at the receiver; differential PSK (DPSK) is one notable 
exception. 
 
Amplitude shift key (ASK) is a common modulation technique for some types 
of TH systems. The amplitude sent is A > 0 for a one and –A for a zero. The time 
of the occurrence of these pulses is determined by a pseudo-random sequence. 
Pulse position modulation (PPM) is also used in TH systems and we will focus on 
that in this chapter. 
 
For digital modulations, symbols are used to modulate the carrier. Symbols 
are the result of mapping the digital information in the form of data words onto 
another form as illustrated in Figure 3.1. An example for multiple frequency shift 
key (MFSK) illustrates this. Suppose two data bits are used to form a digital word. 
Then 22 = 4 possible symbols emerge. A symbol in MFSK is a distinct tone used 
to modulate the carrier. One such mapping could be as shown in Table 3.1 and 
illustrated in Figure 3.2. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
123
 
Figure 3.2 Mapping from digital data words to 22 FSK symbols. 
The most prolific form of modulation for FHSS communications is MFSK, 
with the most common being BFSK. Likewise, the most common form of 
modulation for DSSS communications is MPSK, with M = 2 or 4.

3.3 Binary Signal Reception 
 
Let two arbitrary binary signals, with finite energy over T, be represented by s1(t) 
and s2(t), where the first signal represents the digit 1 and the latter represents the 
digit 0. T is the bit time. These signals are generated at the transmitter, suitably 
modulated onto a carrier for transmission, and subsequently demodulated at the 
receiver. When no noise or interference is present, these signals will be perfectly 
detected at the receiver and every bit sent will be correctly extracted. Noise, 
however, is always present in any real situation, and this noise can cause errors in 
the decoding process. Whatever the means for extracting the data bits at the 
receiver, the random noise induced by the transmitter, the propagation medium, 
and the receiver must be accounted for in order to maximize the probability that 
the received data sequence has as few errors as possible. 
 
Although other choices are possible and frequently applied, the most common 
form of channel assumed between the transmitter and receiver is the AWGN 
channel. This is where the noise is assumed to originate from a physical process 
that emits EM energy in such a way that the amplitude of the noise can be 
statistically described by the Gaussian PDF. This assumption is both 
mathematically convenient as well as reasonably accurate in many real cases. 
Thus, the noise PDF is given by

The notation (, 2) is used for the noise model in (3.4). 
 
In this book we will abuse the notation somewhat and not make the distinction 
between N0 and 
0,
Nimplying the latter always present. That is, all noise sources 
need to be included when considering the SNR. This can get tricky when dealing 
with non-Gaussian noise sources, however. 
The maximum likelihood receiver is the optimum architecture for detecting 
these binary signals when the noise is AWGN. The two types of optimum 
detectors for binary digital signals with arbitrary wave shapes are shown in Figure 
3.3. If the bit energies for s1(t) and s2(t) are E1 and E2, then

to 12.5 kHz). In the Channel 2–6 TV band in the United States (54–88 MHz), the 
TV channelization is 6 MHz. 
In hard decision decoding, a decision is made as to which symbol was sent 
based on the energy outputs of the detectors. Either a space or mark is decided. In 
soft decision decoding, additional information is used. Such information could 
take many forms, such as information about the channel when the symbol was 
sent, gleaned by some means. In addition, with soft decision decoding, sometimes 
decisions can be made about the received symbol other than assuming it was only 
a mark or space. If the energy from the two detectors is about the same, the soft 
decision decoder could declare that it does not know. 
The probability of an error occurring in a bit is denoted Pe, and is sometimes 
called the bit error rate (BER) since they are equivalent. Note that Pe, in general, 
is different from the symbol error rate (SER), which is the probability of a symbol 
error and is denoted Ps. 
 
 
3.4 Error Control 
 
All communications are subject to errors due to noise and interference. The noise 
can be unintentional or intentional; it makes no difference. However, the type of 
noise or interference does make a difference. There are essentially two common 
 
Figure 3.4 Pe for binary signal detection when the data signals have arbitrary wave shapes. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
128
methods to deal with errors caused by RF noise: automatic repeat request (ARQ) 
and forward error correction (FEC). 
In ARQ schemes, when a message is received in error (the error being detected 
by some mechanism at the receiver) the receiver sends a negative acknowledgment 
(NAK) back to the transmitter so the message can be resent. In excessively noisy 
cases, this can occur several times. The disadvantage of ARQ is obvious: the 
system throughput can be dramatically reduced by the noise or interference. 
Another significant disadvantage of ARQ is that a reverse communication path is 
required from the receiver back to the transmitter in order to transmit the NAK. 
Countermeasures specifically designed for ARQ schemes will not be considered 
herein. 
For FEC, one of the forms of coding is applied to the data to be sent. This is 
accomplished by adding some number of bits as appropriate to the data, thus also 
reducing the information throughput. This is often a favorable trade-off, however, 
in that lower SNRs are permitted in the data signal, allowing for lower signal 
power for the same BER performance or better BER performance for the same 
signal power. Different methods of coding have been devised. The effects on 
jamming performance of FEC codes will be discussed. 
 
As will be shown, uncoded BFSK signals suffer significant degradation due to 
jamming. As an example of coding advantages, consider perhaps the simplest type 
of coding, repetition coding. In this case, the transmission of a bit of data is 
repeated some number of times. Without interleaving, these bits would be sent in 
succession. If a hop is being jammed, then this coding technique is ineffective 
since all the resulting coded bits would be jammed. If, however, the bits are 
interleaved where each of the coded bits are sent on a different hop, for many 
types of jamming there is a high probability that some of the bits will be sent in 
portions of the spectrum that are not jammed and therefore are received error-free, 
subject only to noise levels. 
 
 
3.5 Coding Techniques 
 
It is well known that coding is effective at combating channel noise in digital 
communication systems. It would therefore be expected that it could be used to 
counter the effects of intentionally injecting noise into the channel as a noise 
jammer does. This turns out to be the case, and the effects for noise jamming can 
be overcome by coding the transmitted signal. 
Digital communication receivers in systems that employ coding also employ 
decoders to reverse the coding process. The goal of coding is to maximize the 
probability of decoding the same uncoded tuple that was sent. Communication 
channels are corrupted by factors such as thermal noise, intentional noise inserted

by jammers, unintentional noise inserted by man-made objects such as microwave 
ovens, and other signals generated by other communication systems sharing the 
same band. All these sources can cause errors in the receiving process. 
Coding adds some bits to each data word to be transmitted. Often these bits are 
parity bits. The parity of a digital word consisting of b (> 0) bits is the number of 
binary 1’s in the word. Even parity is when this number is an even integer and odd 
parity is when this number is an odd integer. 
In general, there are two kinds of coding techniques in digital communication 
systems: block coding and convolutional coding. In block coding, several data bits 
are assembled together and encoded together. Such encoding usually entails 
adding parity bits to this group assembled. Convolutional coding, on the other 
hand, emits a continuous stream of encoded bits in response to a continuous 
stream of bits to be encoded. The encoded symbol that is currently emitted from 
the encoder is a function of not only the current symbol to be encoded but also one 
or more previous bits. 
 
3.5.1 Block Coding 
 
Block coding is when a group of k symbols are input to the encoder and n encoded 
symbols emerge. This is illustrated in Figure 3.5. Block codes can be linear or 
nonlinear but only linear block codes are discussed here. 
 
For binary systems, the size of the output space is 2n, while the size of the 
input space is 2k. For each input symbol di  K there is one and only one encoded 
symbol ej  E. It is always true that n > k; thus, 2n > 2k. Therefore, not all of the 
possible encoded symbols are used. It is this fact that is exploited to make 
effective block codes. The rate of a block code is given by r = k / n.

 These tuples are sometimes referred to as vectors. A 
properly selected set of code words makes up a vector space, which means that the 
sum of any two of them is also a code word. The number of places where two code 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
130
words differ is known as the Hamming distance, dH, between them. Thus, if         
e1 = (1001001) and e2 = (0010111), then dH = 5. The minimum Hamming distance 
of a code is called the minimum distance of the code and denoted by dmin. If the set 
of codewords all at the same Hamming distance di from the all zero codeword is 
denoted by Wi, then the weight distribution of the code is given by the set of all Wi 
for which di = dmin, …, n.  
As a concrete example of these concepts, suppose the code words are as 
depicted in Table 3.2. In this case dmin = 1, n = 5, k = 4, r = 4/5, W1 = {3},           
W2 = {1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11}, W3 = {4, 8, 9, 12}, W4 = {7, 13, 14}, and W5 = {15}. The 
input symbol space K is of size 24 = 16, while the output encoded symbol space E 
is of size 25 = 32. 
A systematic block code is a linear block code where the data bits are used 
directly in part of the output symbol. Schematically this is shown in Figure 3.6. 
A binary symmetric channel (BSC) is a binary communication channel for 
which the probability of making an error and decoding a one when a zero was sent 
is equal to the probability of decoding a zero when a one was sent. The probability 
of not making an error is denoted by P, so the probability of making an error is 
given by 1 – P. Such a channel can be represented as in Figure 3.7.  
A channel is memoryless if P(00) = P(11) = P does not change according to 
any previous symbols. Thus, P is constant with time. Many of the performance 
parameters of digital communication systems depend on the memoryless channel

presume this to be the case, however. 
Denote y as the input to the channel and x the output of the channel. Denoting 
the decision made by a decoder as ˆ,x then a maximum likelihood decoder is one 
that employs the rule: ―Choose ˆx  to be that xm so that pY(yxm) is maximized‖ [2].

That is, the overall probability to be maximized is the product of the 
individual symbol probabilities that make up the tuples. This would not be true if 
the channel had memory because in that case the current probability would depend 
on one or more prior symbols. Actually, the logarithm of this function is also used 
since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function of its argument. Taking 
the logarithm of (3.14) converts it into a sum rather than a product.

The effects of coding digital signals are quite dramatic with low input error 
rates. Most error correcting codes are designed to operate in this range—they were 
designed with thermal background noise in mind. The decoding error performance 
for Golay (23, 12, 3) code that corrects up to three symbols in error in a block of 
23 binary symbols containing 12 information bits is shown in Figure 3.8. As seen, 
at small error rates, less than, say, 5% in this example, the output error rate is 
significantly below that of the uncoded symbols. At sufficiently large input error 
rates, however, the corrected bit error rate will actually exceed the uncoded rate. 
Above that point is called error extension. The point at which these two curves 
cross is called the critical symbol error rate. Table 3.3 [4] lists some popular 
codes and the critical input error rate at which error extension begins. 
In the region of low Pe, where most codes are designed to operate, the coding 
decreases Pib by decades. Above some relatively low Pe, however, the decoded bit 
error rate rises quite rapidly. This effect is shown in Figure 3.9, where the details 
of Figure 3.8 at low Pe are illustrated. Clearly, the decoded error rate is quite low 
below about Pe = 0.04, but at values as low as Pe = 10–1, the decoded BER is as 
large as 0.5  10–1, approaching regions where many digital, machine-to-machine 
communications cannot operate. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
133
What this means for a jammer is that channel binary symbol rates on the order 
of 10% (10–1) are sufficient to negate the coding advantage in many cases. 
 
3.5.2 Convolutional Coding 
 
Convolution encoding entails entering k information symbols into a linear shift 
register. The properties of these shift registers are examined in Chapter 6. The 
outputs of the shift register stages are input to modulo two adders in a way that is 
specified by the code. After the k information symbols are loaded into the shift

register, the n output symbols are formed at the n outputs of these adders. These, 
then, are the encoded information symbols. The constraint length of a code is 
defined as the number of past input symbols that can influence the current output 
symbol. 
 
3.5.2.1 Coded MFSK  
 
Reed-Solomon codes are sometimes used with noncoherent, orthogonal MFSK. 
The performance of such a detector for a few of these codes is shown in Figure 
3.10 [5] where hard decision decoding was assumed. The dual rate codes have also 
been applied to MFSK with performance characteristics shown in Figure 3.11 [6] 
for r = ½ in Gaussian noise and hard decision decoding. The transition regions in 
these cases are quite narrow, typically going from no communications (10–1 BER) 
to 10–5 BER in only a few decibels of Eb / N0. 
From the point of view of the communicator, this can be viewed positively in 
that applying additional energy of only a few decibels can result in effective 
communications. It can also be viewed as positive by a jammer in that applying 
only a few decibels, more energy (noise in this case) can quickly degrade 
communications. In stressed environments, therefore, it is necessary to operate 
communication systems at values of Eb / N0 considerably larger than those in the 
transition regions, whenever possible. 
The BER performance for uncoded QPSK in AWGN is shown in Figure 3.12. 
Table 3.4 contains the coding gains obtained by comparing Figures 3.10 and 3.11 
with Figure 3.12. These coding gains are for a BER of 10–5, so the uncoded SNR is 
13.4 dB. Of course, all of this gain does not come free. It costs in terms of either 
bandwidth required for the same data rate or a lower data rate for the same 
bandwidth.

For the Reed Solomon codes, if W is the bandwidth for uncoded 2-FSK, for MFSK 
with 2Mfrequencies, the required uncoded bandwidth is about 2m–1W/M, and with 
Reed-Solomon (n, k) coding, the bandwidth is approximately 2m–1nW / Mk. For the 
dual-m coding, the bandwidth required is approximately 2m–1nW / m. 
 Clearly, coding can help improve the performance of MFSK systems. It 
entails some amount of overhead, however. In some applications, such as voice 
transmission, there is a certain minimum rate that can be tolerated before 
communication becomes affected. Some other types of communication do not 
have this constraint—computer-to-computer communications via modems, Wi-Fi, 
or WiMAX, for example. In this case, the communication just slows down. In fact, 
in very noisy or heavily jammed RF environments, it is possible to adjust the 
amount of encoding to continue to allow some communications through almost 
any amount of noise. A 1 Mbps channel can be reduced to a 10 bps channel this 
way, but some information gets through; it just takes longer. 
Some forms of communication are also more tolerant to errors than others. 
When one bit out of 100 (BER = 10–2) is demodulated in error for voice 
communications, it would probably be unnoticeable. On the other hand, a bank 
transaction that moves $1 million from one bank to another would take at least 300 
bits, considering 8 bits per character, 7 characters in the above amount (= 56 bits 
for the amount of money) and two 15-character bank numbers (= 240 bits for bank 
identification). A BER = 10–2 would create three errors in the transaction, which 
would likely be disastrous. 
 
 
3.6 Bit Interleaving 
 
The purpose of bit interleaving is to spread the bits from a data word over several 
other blocks so that a burst of noise or other interference which destroys the 
integrity of a sequence of bits will only hit one or a few from each data word. If 
each word, before interleaving, is coded via an error-detecting and correcting 
method that is effective on the number of bits greater than or equal to the number 
perturbed, then the data words are received correctly. 
 
A simple way to perceive how interleaving works is to look at an example. 
Suppose eight data words, each eight bits long, are arranged in rows, forming an   
8  8 matrix. Without interleaving, the data words are sent serially by row. 
Instead, send the data bits out by column. This, then, results in having a bit from 
each data word in each of the newly formed data words. If a noise burst then 
destroys eight or fewer serial bits, one bit from each reassembled word at the 
receiver could be in error. If the original coding were applied, correcting one or 
fewer bits in error, the data stream would be received and decoded correctly. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
138
 
As mentioned, much of the theory of RF communications is based on the 
assumption of a memoryless channel. Recall that through such a channel, the 
probability of one symbol is independent of all the others. When coding is applied 
to AJ signals, this assumption does not apply. Bit interleaving restores (most of) 
the memoryless characteristics of coded channels. 
 
 
3.7 Side Information 
 
When information about the channel is known at the receiver and/or transmitter, it 
is called side information. This information can consist of, for example, whether 
the channel is being jammed during the reception of a data bit. It could also consist 
of the type of fading that is occurring on the channel or an estimate of the number 
of paths being taken by the received signal on its way from the transmitter to the 
receiver, as specific examples. 
 
3.7.1 Jammer State Information 
 
Jammer state information (JSI) refers to when the receiver knows the channels and 
symbol times that the jammer was on and therefore knows if a particular symbol 
may be in error caused by the jammer. Notice that it is not necessarily the case that 
the symbol is in error, just that there is a higher probability of it. Recall that hard 
decision decoding is when a decoder makes a decision as to what information 
symbol was sent each symbol period without using any other information. Some 
decoders can be designed to provide to what degree they believe the output symbol 
is correct, the reliability of the information. Soft decision decoders take advantage 
of this information and use it to decide the transmitted symbol or perhaps to reject 
the symbol altogether (the erasure channel). 
 
One way to obtain jammer state information is to monitor the whole spectrum 
over which the communication system operates. If wide jamming techniques are in 
use, then the receiver can determine the frequency range over which the jamming 
is taking place. If that coincides with the frequency at the moment, then the 
receiver knows that the symbol was jammed. For MFSK, there is an easier way 
suggested by Trumpis [7]. Since there is a bandpass filter for each of the M 
symbols, without jamming, significant energy will come from the filter 
corresponding to the symbol that was sent. With jamming, if the jammer is in the 
channel of the data tone, then it aids in correct detection. If it is not, then two or 
more of these filters will provide significant detected energy and thus the receiver 
knows if the symbol was jammed or not, although the receiver probably would not 
know which is the right symbol. Since there is a simple way to generate such 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
139
jammer state information, it is normally assumed to be available to the receiver 
trying to make symbol decisions. 
 
3.7.2 Channel State Information 
 
When it is known (or estimated) what type of channel is present, it is called having 
channel state information. A fading channel could be a Ricean fading channel or a 
Rayleigh fading channel. Different kinds of noise are sometimes assumed if there 
is good reason to do so. The AWGN channel is one such noise assumption. Noise 
colored in specific ways can also be factored in, if, in fact, it is known that such 
noise is present. Knowledge of the type of channel can significantly improve on 
the ability to estimate what symbol was sent. 
 
 
3.8 Signal-to-Noise Ratio 
 
For narrowband signaling, the ratio of the bit (symbol) energy, Es, to the noise 
PSD, N0, is often used as a measure of the SNR. In addition, if the symbol rate of 
the data, Rs, is numerically equivalent to the channel bandwidth, Wb, then

While this relationship still applies to analysis of narrow (instantaneous)

3.9 Channel Bandwidth 
 
Most narrowband communication systems use 25 kHz or 50 kHz channel 
bandwidths. However, after January 1, 2011, manufacturers cannot manufacture or 
import equipment in the United States operating with a maximum channel 
bandwidth greater than 12.5 kHz unless it demonstrates a 12.5 kHz or better 
equivalent spectrum efficiency. In addition, any new equipment submitted to the 
FCC for certification must be capable of operating in 6.25 kHz channels or on 
equivalent spectrum efficiency (e.g., two voice paths in a 12.5 kHz channel). 
Lastly, applications for new systems or modification applications that expand the 
authorized contour of an existing system operating at greater than a 12.5 kHz 
equivalent spectrum efficiency will not be accepted.  
Furthermore, after January 1, 2013 radio systems must operate in 12.5 kHz 
equivalent spectrum efficiency or better. This bandwidth will not support analog 
FM voice communications. However, with higher order digital modulations         
(8 bps/Hz, for example), adequate digitized voice can be supported. 
 
 
3.10 Phase Shift Keying 
 
3.10.1 Introduction 
 
Multiple phase shift keying (MPSK) is characterized by causing a phase change 
within the carrier signal. This phase change can be relative to an absolute value or 
it can be differential, becoming DPSK, with the information contained in the phase 
at one bit time compared with the last. MPSK systems are always coherently 
detected, whereas DPSK is a form of noncoherent modulation since carrier phase 
tracking need not be maintained over long periods. A constellation diagram for 
MPSK is a representation of the phase states associated with the modulation. 
Three such constellation diagrams are shown in Figure 3.13. The x-axis is 
normally referred to as the in-phase (I) axis and the y-axis is referred to as the 
quadrature phase (Q) axis. A symbol in MPSK is defined by an angle from some 
reference, frequently taken as the positive x-axis in the constellation diagram. 
Thus, each dot in Figure 3.13 is an MPSK symbol. For example, for 23 PSK where 
the data words consist of three bits, the symbols might be as shown in Table 3.5 
corresponding to Figure 3.13(c). (Of course, other mappings are possible and 
might be better for other reasons.) The primary modulations used for DSSS 
systems are BPSK and QPSK. The latter has desirable spectrum occupancy 
performance advantages over the former; its performance is, however, more 
sensitive to noise and interference. Two types of the latter are minimum shift key 
(MSK) and offset QPSK (OQPSK).

Phase shifting a carrier signal is accomplished by imposing the data signal on 
the carrier by changing the latter’s phase. The amount of phase change depends on 
the number of phase states. For the BPSK signal s(t) during time interval k,

longer applies in this case. The constellation has its points at 0 and  radians in 
this case; it is still BPSK, however. If the carrier has an arbitrary starting phase  
other than 0, then BPSK still results, but with the constellation points offset by .

Obviously, this can be extended to any desired number of states. However, as 
the number of states increases, the probability that a received symbol with noise 
present falls into the regime of an incorrect symbol increases because the size of 
each regime gets smaller. Therefore, the sensitivity to noise and interference 
increase with higher-order phase modulation.

which shapes the data pulses during the modulation process according to the  
cos() and sin() functions. MSK, in particular, has a significant advantage over 
the other types of PSK discussed here in the out-of-band power spectrum of the 
signal. Such out-of-band energy interferes with communications in those channels. 
The comparison for these modulation types is shown in Figure 3.15 [8]. 
 
3.10.2 BPSK  
 
A simplified flow diagram of a BPSK communication system is shown in Figure 
3.16. The filtering and amplification stages are not shown (because they are not 
germane to our current discussion). We discuss the fundamental characteristics of 
this system in this section. In particular, we will derive the expression for the BER 
for BPSK modulation. The binary digits 1 and 0, or +1 and –1, are represented by 
Figure 3.14 Time sample function, also referred to as the time window function.

respectively. An information source 
generates a sequence of information bits represented by p(t). These are modulated 
onto a carrier and sent out over the free-space portion of the channel. Here they are 
usually corrupted by noise and interference before reaching the receiver. At the 
receiver, the bits are extracted from the carrier generating an estimate of the bits 
sent, these estimates being represented by ˆ( ).
p t  
A simple but completely effective modulator for BPSK is shown in Figure 
3.17. Multiplying a carrier generated here by the oscillator at frequency f0, by the 
data sequence represented by 1, causes the carrier phase to change at the data rate 
in accordance with the data sequence.  
The optimum BPSK detector is illustrated in Figure 3.18, which is a correlator, 
also known as a matched filter [9] . The received signal, corrupted by noise, is first 
multiplied by a signal that is the difference between the two possible,

The integrated signal is sampled at the end of the symbol period, with the sample 
compared with a threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, then one of the two 
possible symbols is declared present. If the threshold is not exceeded, then the 
other symbol is declared.

The last line comes about because the cos x function integrated over an integer 
number of periods is zero. Substituting this into (3.9) yields R12 = –1. 
The received signal, after filtering and frequency downconversion at the input 
to the detector, is given by r(t) and the signal at the output of the detector is given 
by v(t). In general, r(t) is comprised of the transmitted signal s(t), AWGN, and 
zero or more interfering signals.

Equation (3.44) is plotted in Figure 3.21 for some values of SIR = R / I.  
As expected, the stronger the interfering signal is, the poorer the performance 
that ensues from the BPSK communication system. The infinite case is, of course, 
when I = 0 (no interference); note that this curve corresponds to Figure 3.20. 
 
 
3.10.3 QPSK 
 
A model of a QPSK modulator is shown in Figure 3.22 [9]. It can be viewed as 
two BPSK modulators operating in parallel with their outputs added. The carriers 
must be in phase quadrature and the quadrature data rate is half that of the 
baseband data. The two BPSK data streams are constructed from the original data 
sequence by loading a 2-bit shift register with two sequential bits from the original 
data stream. These two bits are used to modulate quadrature carriers as shown in 
Figure 3.22.

Figure 3.22 QPSK modulator can be configured from two parallel BPSK modulators. (After: [9]. © 
John Wiley & Sons, 2002. Reprinted with permission.) 
The resulting QPSK transitions are shown in Figures 3.23(a) and 3.24(a). 
Notice that some of these transitions pass thorough the origin. This causes the 
amplitude of the carrier, once modulated with this data sequence, to be zero for an 
amount of time during these transitions. Using power amplifiers in or near 
saturation causes severe distortion in the transmitted signal and significant out-of- 
band interference results. If the Q channel is delayed by one bit time from the I 
channel, then, as shown in Figure 3.23(b), only one bit (coordinate) is allowed to

by delaying each by one bit and transmitting the even and odd bits via separate channels.

change at a time, and the resulting allowed transitions are as shown in Figure 
3.24(b). The transitions through the origin are eliminated, as are the distortions. 
This technique is called offset QPSK (OQPSK) or staggered QPSK (SQPSK). In 
this case, only a one-stage shift register is needed.  
A QPSK demodulator is illustrated in Figure 3.25 [11]. This particular 
configuration takes advantage of the fact that a QPSK signal is made up of two 
BPSK signals and simply separates them. The signal into the QPSK detector

Equation (3.59) was depicted earlier in Figure 3.12. We see that the performance 
is somewhat worse than BPSK as would be expected because of the increased 
density of the constellation. 
Since Ts = 2Tb, the bandwidth required for QPSK is ½ that for BPSK for the 
same data rate. Since the throughput is the same for BPSK and QPSK, the latter is 
generally favored over the former to take advantage of the narrower bandwidth 
requirements even though the BER performance is somewhat worse. Alternately, 
the QPSK data rate can be twice that for BPSK for the same bandwidth.  
As with BPSK, (3.59) can be put in a form with power ratios

Equation (3.39), using (3.67) and (3.68), is illustrated in Figure 3.27 where       
SIR = R / I = 1 / . Note that (3.63) corresponds to the SIR =  curve in Figure 
3.27. 
 
Comparing Figure 3.27 with Figure 3.20, we see that the QPSK performance 
is approximately 5 dB worse than BPSK for the same level of interfering tone. 
That means that QPSK requires a 5 dB stronger signal than BPSK for the same 
BER performance when interference is present. 
 
3.10.4 DBPSK 
 
Recall that for DPSK, the current bit is determined by a phase relationship with the 
previous bit. The only case discussed here will be DBPSK, although higher forms 
are certainly possible and exist. Extensions of these arguments to higher orders are 
straightforward. Although either is possible, herein a 1 is encoded as a phase 
change of  radians from the previous bit, while a 0 is encoded as no phase 
change.

Figure 3.28 One possible DBPSK modulator. 
A modulator architecture for generating BDPSK is shown in Figure 3.28. This 
modulator differentially encodes each data bit prior to being upconverted with the 
mixer. A 1 in the input stream causes the output to reverse: 0 to  or  to 0, 
whichever applies. On the other hand, a 0 in the data stream keeps the output 
phase the same.  
Receiver architectures for DBPSK are shown in Figure 3.29 [14]. The receiver 
in Figure 3.29(a) is suboptimal but quite simple to implement, while that in Figure 
3.29(b) is optimal.

Equation (3.77) is plotted in Figure 3.30 [16] for some representative parameters. 
It is assumed in this example that WFT = 1. This example indicates that DBPSK is 
relatively sensitive to tone interference, producing a Pe of 10–1 with ISR less than 
zero.

when dkf represents the frequency offset of the modulating tones from the carrier 
frequency f0. In particular, for BFSK, in the most common case when the 
modulating tones are located symmetrically on either side of the carrier frequency 
and offset by f , dk = 1 represents the data bit during that interval. 
For MFSK, either coherent or noncoherent detection can be used, but due to 
implementation complexity and similar performance of the modulation schemes at 
high SNR, noncoherent detection is more common. In that case, the tones may be 
coherent within a hop (for SFHSS) but incoherent between hops. Coherent 
detection requires that the receiver be phase-locked to the received signal, whereas 
for noncoherent detection this is not required. Recovery of the signal carrier phase 
is therefore required for coherent reception. 
It is possible to use coherent FSK detection, where the phase is preserved and 
the receiver phase is aligned with that of the received signal. For large Eb / N0, 
however, the performance of these detectors is essentially the same as noncoherent 
detectors. This coherent detection is possible within a dwell for SFHSS systems, 
but phase coherency is difficult to maintain over large changes of the frequency

control the phase angle of the tones as the data stream selects the signal to send. 
synthesizers, so phase coherence from dwell to dwell is difficult to track. Because 
of this and the fact that coherent detection requires more processing to keep track 
of the carrier phase for equivalent performance, by far the most prolific form of 
modulation for FHSS systems is noncoherent BFSK. For these reasons we will 
only consider non-coherent reception here. 
When jamming FSK signals, the jammer attempts to raise the noise power at 
the output of the detection filters at the receiver. This is true irrespective of the 
particular jamming technique employed. When the target employs noncoherent 
FSK, then these filters are usually bandpass filters just prior to energy detection. 
 
A block diagram of a notional noncoherent MFSK transmitter is shown in 
Figure 3.31 when M = 4. The data stream d(t) selects which of the tones (symbols) 
is used to modulate the carrier. The symbol frequencies are f1, f2, f3, and f4, while f0 
moves the tones from the baseband frequency range higher for efficient 
propagation. This is the carrier signal frequency. Note that if cable is the 
propagation medium, then the carrier oscillator may not be needed.  
In this case, each symbol in the data stream d(t) represents two bits of 
information because 4 = 22. For 8-FSK, there would be eight such oscillators and 
each symbol of d(t) would represent three bits of information since 8 = 23. In 
general, for MFSK modulation, log2 M bits of information are transmitted with 
each symbol. 
 
3.11.2 BFSK 
 
As mentioned, noncoherent detection is the most prolific detection scheme for 
MFSK. This is because it is difficult to build oscillators that maintain phase 
coherence over the large and rapid frequency changes that occur in MFSK signals.

Figure 3.32 Noncoherent BFSK detector architecture. 
It is, however, possible in SFHSS systems to maintain coherency from one bit to 
the next within a hop. 
 
The receiver detector structure for noncoherent detection of BFSK with hard 
decision decoding is shown in Figure 3.32. The incoming signals are first 
converted to a suitable intermediate frequency (IF) and then bandpass filtered. 
This filter removes significant out-of-band unwanted signals from further 
processing. The filtered signal, after another stage of suitable frequency 
conversion, is then sent to two channels for detection. The mark and space 
frequencies are different and so the bandpass filters for the appropriate frequency 
will only pass signals at its associated frequency offset from the carrier frequency. 
If a mark was sent, then the bottom (mark) channel output after square law 
envelope detection will be larger than the upper (space) channel. The output from 
the detector that is the larger is selected as the tone that was sent. Even though the 
noise spectral density, whether unintentional as specified by N0 and therefore 
modeled as a constant level, or jammer noise, whose spectral density can also be 
modeled as a constant level, the associated time domain signals are constantly 
changing amplitudes and therefore the power levels are changing. This effect can 
cause an error to be made in this selection process because noise can cause the 
energy in the complementary tone channel to be larger than that in the data tone 
channel during a symbol interval. The comparison is made between these two 
amplitudes by subtracting one from the other, forming z = r1 – r2. The decision is 
made via: 
 
Choose mark if z < 0; 
Choose space if z > 0.

Figure 3.33 Channel structure for BFSK. 
The mark and space filters shown in Figure 3.32 are bandpass filters. They could 
also be baseband lowpass filters, or some other type. 
The spectrum structure for BFSK is illustrated in Figure 3.33. Two tones are 
placed somewhere in the spectrum, one representing a space and the other a mark. 
Typically, these tones are placed symmetrically on either side of the carrier 
frequency and that will be assumed here. The two signals at the input to the 
detector in Figure 3.32 can be represented as

Noise in the Complementary Channel Only 
 
For the follower jammer that will be discussed subsequently, one possibility is to 
use a jamming technique that places a narrowband noise (NBN) signal in the 
complementary channel. Since, in general, it is not known which side of the carrier 
tone is the complementary channel (and it can change every symbol interval), the 
probability is reduced by a factor of ½ . Thus,

Note that Pe from additional noise in the complementary channel, given by (3.91), 
is larger than that from additional noise in the data channel given by (3.93). The 
presence of the Pn term in the numerator accounts for this difference. 
 
Noise in Both Channels  
 
In this case B1 = B2 = 0; however, again, it is not known which side is the 
contiguous channel; therefore, a factor of ½ is necessary. In addition, the power 
per channel is reduced by ½ giving the power

These three cases are plotted in Figure 3.34 for some representative 
parameters. Note that as the level of additional noise takes Pn / R above 0 dB, the 
effect of the additional noise in the data channel only is to reduce Pe. Additional 
noise in the complementary channel or both channels raises Pe to levels at which it 
is difficult to communicate at relatively low levels of noise. Jamming just one 
channel on one side of the detected signal produces Pe > 10–1 at Pn / R  –4 dB for 
 = 10 dB and –5 dB for  = 20 dB. Similarly, jamming both the tone channel and 
one of the adjacent channels produces Pn / R  –8 dB for  = 10 dB and –5 dB for 
 = 20 dB.

A comparison of these five cases is illustrated in Figure 3.35 when the 
interfering tone is 5 dB below the signal level and the added noise is equivalent to 
the signal level [
n /
1 (0 dB)
P
R 
]. For these example parameters, an interferer in 
the complementary channel creates more havoc than in both channels because in 
the latter case, the tone in the data channel assists the receiver in correctly 
detecting the signal (phase differences in this channel are not accounted for here). 
To account for phase, assuming a uniform distribution of the phase over (0, 2), 
averaging the phase PDF over this range would be required. Likewise, noise in the 
complementary channel only keeps Pe higher than the cases with noise in the data 
channel for the same reason. 
The noise level in Figure 3.35 is quite high, being equivalent to the signal 
level. With lower noise levels, the BER would be lower than that shown. 
Similarly, for lower levels of interference, the BER would be lower.

This function is plotted in Figure 3.37 for some values of M. The larger M is, the 
more susceptible noncoherent MFSK is to symbol errors. The required bandwidth, 
however, decreases as more information is being sent within a symbol. This has 
benefits because narrower filters can be used in the receiver, thus decreasing the 
noise level and increasing the SNR. The bandwidth required is actually a factor of 
M / log2 M less than BFSK [17]. 
Comparing Figure 3.20 with M = 2 in Figure 3.37, we can see that coherent 
BPSK exhibits about a 5 dB better performance at Pe = 10–2 than noncoherent

BFSK; this difference decreases to about 4 dB at Pe = 10–4. It would therefore be 
expected that EA against coherent BPSK is more difficult than against 
noncoherent BFSK. 
Letting M = 2, then, yields Pe for this detector as

This function is plotted in Figure 3.37 when M = 2. A summary of these results is 
given in Table 3.6. An SNR of around 8.9 dB is all that is required to achieve a Pe 
of 10–2. 
The FHSS systems included here are assumed to operate in a channelized 
spectrum, such as the low VHF band. In addition, they are assumed to use MFSK 
modulation. Due to this latter assumption, the input to the channel from the 
transmitter will be a tone, whatever the carrier modulation technique employed at 
the transmitter. If the carrier modulation is amplitude modulation, then the FSK 
tones are simply translated in frequency to a higher place in the spectrum. If the 
carrier modulation is FM, then several tones separated by the modulation tone 
frequency are generated with amplitudes determined by the Bessel function of the 
first kind and zeroth order, but, due to the first assumption, only one of these tones 
is carried in any given channel. The remainder of the tones generated are assumed 
to be small compared with the first one. 
 
 
3.12 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
 
QAM is a modulation technique in which two sinusoidal carriers, one 90 degrees 
out of phase with respect to the other, are used to transmit data over a given 
channel. Because the orthogonal carriers occupy the same frequency band and 
differ by a 90o phase shift, each can be modulated independently, transmitted over 
the same frequency band, and demodulated at the receiver. For a given available 
bandwidth, QAM enables data transmission at twice the rate of a standard pulse

amplitude modulation (PAM) without any degradation in the BER. QAM and its 
derivatives are used in both mobile radio and satellite communication systems. 
QAM requires changing the phase and amplitude of a carrier sine wave. One of 
the easiest ways to implement QAM with hardware is to generate and mix two 
sine waves that are 90o out-of-phase with one another, as illustrated in Figure 3.38. 
Adjusting only the amplitude of either signal can affect the phase and amplitude of 
the resulting mixed signal. 
These two carrier waves represent the in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) 
components of our signal. Individually each of these signals can be represented as: 
 
 
cos
I
A

 
(3.110) 
 
and 
 
 
sin
Q
A

 
(3.111) 
 
Note that the I and Q components are represented as cosine and sine because the 
two signals are 90o out-of-phase with one another. Using the two identities above 
and

As (3.112) illustrates, the resulting identity is a periodic signal whose phase can be 
adjusted by changing the amplitude of I and Q. Thus, it is possible to perform

digital modulation on a carrier signal by adjusting the amplitude of the two mixed 
signals. 
As mentioned, QAM can be extended to any order desired, with the trade-offs 
being spectrum efficiency on the one hand and BER versus SNR performance on 
the other—the higher orders or modulation being more sensitive to the SNR than 
lower orders. 
 
Some modern communication systems use higher orders of QAM because of 
its efficiency. Up to 64QAM is used in WiMAX when the noise environment 
supports it. In this section we will review the characteristics of 2QAM, 4QAM, 
and 16QAM. Extending the performance to higher forms is a straightforward 
extension of the last of these. 
 
We should note that although we only show square constellations here for 
simplicity in exposition, the constellations need not be square. Any shape 
imaginable is possible. 
 
A representative receiver architecture for 4QAM is shown in Figure 3.39. The 
incoming signal (after filtering, amplification, and perhaps frequency conversion) 
is multiplied again by the orthogonal functions—cos ct for the I-channel and sin 
ct for the Q-channel. The results of this multiplication are integrated for a symbol 
interval, Ts, filtered, sampled, and manipulated to recover the amplitude, A, and 
phase, , as shown in Figure 3.39. The result is an estimate of the original data 
sequence. 
 
3.12.1 2QAM and 4QAM Modulations 
 
Observing Figure 3.13, we can see that 2QAM modulation is the same as BPSK, 
and 4QAM modulation is the same as QPSK modulation. The characteristics of 
these modulations were already examined in Section 3.9. Therefore, we need not 
develop these modulations further here.

3.12.2 16QAM Performance with Gray Mapping 
 
In this section we will derive the theoretical 16QAM BER with a Gray-coded 
constellation mapping in AWGN. Gray mapping is when each adjacent symbol is 
different in only one bit, as illustrated in Figure 3.40. The 4 bits at each 
constellation point in 16QAM can be considered as two bits each on independent I 
and Q axes as indicated in Table 3.7. 
 
3.12.2.1 Symbol Error and Bit Error Probability

constellation symbols differ by a single bit. So if the noise causes the constellation 
to cross the decision threshold, only one out of k bits will be in error. Thus the 
relation between bit error and symbol error is given by 
 
 
s
b
P
P
k

 
(3.113) 
 
Note that for very low values of Es / N0, it may happen that the noise causes the 
constellation to fall near a diagonally located constellation point. In that case, each 
symbol error will cause two bit errors, hence the need for the approximate 
relationship in (3.113). However, for reasonably high values of Es / N0, the 
chances of such events are negligible. 
 
3.12.2.2 Bit Energy and Symbol Energy  
 
Since each symbol consists of k bits, the symbol-to-noise ratio is k times the bit 
energy to noise ratio, namely,

3.12.2.3 Scaling Factor in QAM 
 
There is a scaling factor that is normally used when analyzing QAM. The purpose 
of this scaling factor is to normalize the average energy to 1. For an MQAM 
constellation mapping, where 
M is a power of 2, the elements of the alphabet 
are

We can take advantage of the symmetry in the constellation by first noting that 
each quadrant contains M / 4 constellation points and that the energy of the real 
and imaginary components are the same. Furthermore, in each quadrant the

3.12.2.4 Computing the Probability of Error 
 
Consider the 16QAM constellation shown in Figure 3.41. To determine the BER, 
we have three distinct types of symbols that we need to examine, since they may 
lead to different results. The interior symbol regions are {s5, s6, s9, s10}, while the 
corner symbol regions are those around {s0, s3, s12, s15}. The remaining symbols 
with equivalent constraints are neither the interior nor corner points and they are 
{s1, s2, s4, s7, s8, s11, s13, s14}. Due to symmetry, we can see that the contribution to 
the BER from each member of these sets is the same.  
 
The received signal can be any of

The performance of all three modulation techniques are compared in Figure 
3.45. 4QAM performs the worst of the three at low SNR, whereas when the SNR 
reaches about 10 dB or so, it starts to outperform Gray-encoded 16QAM. BPSK 
has the best performance at all SNR levels. At high SNR levels, 4QAM and 
16QAM BER performance are essentially the same, while the throughput of 
16QAM is four times the throughput of 4QAM for the same bandwidth. Therefore, 
if the SNR is adequate, 16QAM is the better choice. 
 
 
3.13 Spread Spectrum 
 
In spread spectrum communication systems the signal that is transmitted is 
typically much wider than the minimum necessary, hence the appellation spread 
spectrum. A relatively narrow bandwidth information signal is spread in frequency 
to take advantage of the properties of such modulations.

We present the salient characteristics of SS signaling in this section. In 
particular, we cover the properties of DSSS, FHSS, both fast and slow, THSS, and 
hybrids of these. Much more will be provided in later chapters where we address 
how to jam these signal types. 
  
3.13.1 Processing Gain 
 
The definition of processing gain (Gp) of a spread spectrum communication 
system we will use is given by the ratio of the detector output SNR, SNRo, to the 
SNR at the detector input, SNRi, namely,

Other definitions have been made of spread spectrum processing gain, but this is 
the one used here. 
 
In SS systems, advantage is taken of the significantly wider bandwidth 
occupied by the modulated signal compared to the data, or modulating signal. This 
bandwidth expansion is what accounts for most of the favorable properties in SS 
systems. 
 
3.13.2 Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum 
 
In DSSS systems all users transmit in the same bandwidth simultaneously (see 
Figure 3.46). Some points to be noted from Figure 3.46 are: 
 
 
Figure 3.46 CDMA channels occupy the same frequency spectrum. A channel is defined by its 
spreading code.

 
All users share the same bandwidth. 
 
Users are separated by a code, not by a timeslot or frequency. 
 
Each user is spread in the frequency domain. 
 
At the receive end, users are despread using the code that is unique to the 
transmitter and receiver.  
 
The power axis shows the strength of the cumulative addition of signals 
transmitted by all users. 
 
The codes used for spreading have low cross-correlation values and are unique 
to every user. This is the reason that a receiver that has knowledge about the code 
of the intended transmitter is capable of selecting the desired signal.  
In DSSS systems the data signal is multiplied by a PN code. This results in low 
cross-correlation values among the codes and the difficulty in jamming or 
detecting a data message. The relatively slow data signal is multiplied by the much 
faster PN code chip sequence. It is a well-known fact that the faster a signal is (the 
shorter the chip time), the greater its spectrum width. The result is that the coded 
signal occupies the same bandwidth as the coding signal.  
Several families of binary PN codes exist. A customary way to create a PN-
code is by means of at least one shift register (shift registers are discussed at length 
in Chapter 4). When the length of such a shift register is n, the period NDS of the 
above-mentioned code families is given by

The spreading process and the effects of a narrowband interferer, such as a 
jammer, are illustrated in Figure 3.47. The modulated DSSS signal, the spectrum 
of which is shown solid, is typically below the noise floor as shown. The interferer 
is shown with its power level above the noise floor. These signals add in the 
frequency domain and are all received by the DSSS receiver. By simply 
multiplying the received signal by the same code sequence as the one used in the 
transmitter (after they are synchronized), the interfering signal is spread out in 
frequency for exactly the same reason the baseband signal was spread in the 
transmitter—the interfering signal is decorrelated, and multiplying by the high- 
speed chip sequence, the energy is spread out in the spectrum, making the energy 
in any small bandwidth (such as the bandwidth of the baseband signal) quite small. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
191
However, since the same code is used in the receiver, the intended baseband signal 
is collapsed to its original form and recovered. 
  
Thus, the resulting filtered signal is comprised of mostly the original baseband 
information, and the other DSSS signals, just like the aforementioned jammer, 
have been reduced to noise. This is how DSSS can be used as a multiple access 
technique. 
A simplified flow diagram of a DSSS system is illustrated in Figure 3.48. In 
DSSS, the data signal is normally multiplied by a much higher-rate spreading 
signal, noted as the code generator in Figure 3.48. The multiplication in Figure 
3.48 is accomplished by the exclusive OR. The result is a digital signal at the rate 
of the spreading signal. One bit of the spreading signal is referred to as a chip, and 
the spreading signal is sometimes referred to as the chipping signal. That signal is 
then normally 2n PSK modulated onto the carrier. For BPSK, for example, this 
modulation process can be accomplished by simply multiplying the carrier 
waveform, usually a sine wave, by the digital signal from the exclusive OR. In this 
case, multiplying a sine wave by +1 or –1 accomplishes the same thing as 
changing the phase directly.  
 
The process is reversed at the receiver. After RF amplification (not shown), 
downconversion in the mixer, and amplification (also not shown), the phase 
modulation is removed by the multiplier (exclusive OR in this case). With a large 
enough SNR, the data sequence is thus removed from the carrier. In this simple 
case it is assumed that the two code generators are synchronized so that their PN 
codes are locked together. The synchronization mechanism is not shown in Figure 
3.48.

The most popular modulations for DSSS are from the PSK family. This is 
when the modulation information is contained in the relative phases of one bit 
relative to the last one or to a reference phase. BPSK is probably the most 
common but higher forms are also used. BPSK uses two phase states to represent 
whether the data bit is a one or zero. In QPSK, four phase states are used to 
represent one of the possible states associated with two data bits (00, 01, 10, or 
11). In general, 2n PSK is possible. The architecture used herein for DSSS AJ 
communication is shown in Figure 3.49. 
 
Herein it is assumed that chip transitions coincide with data bit transitions and 
that the chip rate is an integer multiple of the data rate. It is a system requirement 
to avoid spillage of energy into areas of the spectrum where it is not wanted and 
most well-designed DSSS systems incorporate this. 
The spreading signal is generally coded with a code selected for some 
desirable property—orthogonality with other code sequences in the same family, 
for example. 
 
The data stream d(t) is mapped (encoded) into I and Q symbols, depending on 
the modulation scheme used. The I and Q components are then multiplied by the 
spreading code cI(t) and cQ(t). This is followed by filtering the chipped waveform 
with chip filters, which are usually of the square root raised cosine variety. After 
chip filtering, the I and Q channel signals are converted to some higher IF 
frequency and then converted to analog form for RF processing. This RF 
processing consists of conversion to the transmit frequency f0, filtering, and 
amplification. The resulting signal is then transmitted. 
Whereas d(t) is has a relatively slow data rate, say, 100 kbps, and therefore a 
relatively narrowband spectrum denoted by Wd, cI(t) and cQ(t) have much higher 
data rates, say, 100 Mbps, and therefore a relatively wider frequency extent. The 
bandwidth of cI(t) and cQ(t) is Wss. This multiplication essentially makes the 
bandwidth of the transmitted signal that of cI(t) and cQ(t) and at any given narrow 
frequency region the power is low—frequently below the thermal noise floor. The 
result of multiplication by cI(t) and cQ(t) produces a sin x x  spectrum as shown 
 
Figure 3.48 DSSS notional block diagram. The two code generators are assumed to be synchronized 
(see Chapter 7).

in Figure 3.50(a). The higher sidelobes are usually filtered off with the filter 
shown in Figure 3.50(b), with the result being only the main lobe for transmission 
as shown in Figure 3.50(c). After MPSK modulation, the resulting signal is up-
converted in frequency to f0 by simple multiplication. After appropriate filtering 
and amplification, the signal is transmitted. 
 
At the receiver, the signal is amplified and filtered, but is still wideband. After 
downconversion to the IF frequency in analog form, the signal is converted to 
digital form at the sample rate. That signal is then multiplied with cosine and sine 
waveforms at the IF frequency for conversion to baseband. After chip filtering 
these I and Q channel signals then are despread by multiplication by cI(t) and cQ(t)  
again. The resulting signals are then integrated over the symbol time (Ts = NcTc) 
and the resultant symbols are decoded from I and Q back into d(t). 
The two receiver synchronization loops are shown at the bottom of Figure 
3.49; the first is for coherent demodulation of the chips at a frequency of n  fIF, 
and the second provides for coherent detection of each chip. This latter one drives

the receiver PN generator to keep the PN sequence in proper phase. Whereas M 
could be any power of 2, M = 2 is the most popular choice because of the ease of 
implementation. 
 
One of the characteristics of the PSK forms of modulation is that they have a 
constant modulus. That means their amplitude does not change. This is particularly 
important in those communication systems that are power limited, such as cell 
phone systems, PCS, and satellite communications. In those systems the final 
amplifiers that raise the signal power to levels adequate for transmission can be 
operated in saturation for maximum efficiency. Trying to use such an amplifier 
with signals that have varying amplitude generates what are normally considered 
unacceptable levels of intermodulation distortion, which interferes with other 
communications and wastes power. 
 
Just as the spreading signal at the transmitter broadens the narrowband data 
signal, a narrowband signal received at the receiver is spread out by the action of 
the despreader. The same is true of other wideband signals with different 
spreading codes. 
 
3.13.2.1 DSSS Processing Gain

3.13.3 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum 
 
In FHSS communication systems the narrowband information signal is modulated 
onto a carrier signal, and the frequency of the carrier signal is changed frequently. 
In addition to supplying a degree of LPI and LPE, FHSS systems enjoy the 
advantage of frequency diversity that helps to mitigate multipath, frequency- 
dependent fading. 
As mentioned in Section 1.6.2, the frequency hopping technique is divided into 
fast frequency hopping and slow frequency hopping with the distinction based on 
the number of data bits sent per hop. 
One of the simplest coding techniques for MFSK is to divide the energy in a 
symbol, Es, into m equal-energy subsymbols, also called chips, and transmit these 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
196
subsymbols at different frequencies that are hopped independently. This is called 
time diversity transmission or repetition coding. For fast frequency hopping, the 
hop rate is determined by LF, where each of the LF subsymbols represents a 
different hop and therefore a different hop frequency. For slow frequency hopping, 
the subsymbols are interspersed on the hop as well as on subsequent hops, as 
shown in Figure 3.51. In this example there are two symbols that have been 
divided into six subsymbols each. These subsymbols are transmitted as shown, 
both on the same hop and on subsequent hops. When these subsymbols are 
received, they are incoherently detected at the receiver and an estimate of the 
original data sequence is obtained.  
The transmitter model for FHSS shown in Figure 3.52 does not depend on 
whether it is SFHSS or FFHSS. Differences do arise for more detailed models that 
incorporate implementation issues, however. The data sequence is used to select 
which tone in the MFSK modulator is to be sent as the current symbol. The 
selected tone is upconverted to the hop frequency by the tone from the synthesizer, 
the frequency of which is controlled by a pseudo-random number generator.

3.13.3.2 Fast Frequency Hopping 
 
The channel structure for FFHSS is illustrated in Figure 3.53. Each data bit is 
transmitted at several (in this case, LF = 4) frequencies. This has several 
advantages, as will be explained below. Its biggest disadvantage relative to SFHSS 
described later is implementation complexity. For effective voice communication, 
typically 16,000 bps are required (although this is getting smaller with modern 
source coding techniques). For LF = 4, as in this example, and assuming some bits 
are required for system administration (say 1,000 bps), then the channel data rate 
would be about 68,000 bps. Depending on the modulation used, this could easily 
cause the required channel bandwidth, in many situations, to be too large for 
reasonable RF SNRs.  
The detector structure for noncoherent BFSK FFHSS systems with hard 
decision decoding is shown in Figure 3.54. The pseudo-random code generator 
changes the frequency of the local frequency synthesizer in lock step with the one 
in the transmitter—they are assumed to be synchronized, although the modules to 
perform this synchronization are not shown in Figure 3.54. This local frequency 
moves the output of the mixer r(t) to the appropriate channel center frequency. 
Through the detector, the processing is the same as in Figure 3.3. At the output of 
the detectors, an accumulator adds the detector outputs until LF samples have been 
collected. A decision is then made as to whether a mark or space was sent on the 
previous LF frequencies.

FFHSS with Diversity Coding 
 
One of the simplest forms of coding to improve performance of FFHSS systems 
against multitone jammers is to add frequency diversity. In this approach, each bit 
is transmitted on m frequencies in succession so that the chip duration is given by

where NT = N0 + J0. This function is plotted in Figure 3.55 for several values of M. 
Also shown in Figure 3.55 is the BER for broadband noise, for comparison. 
Diversity coding is also referred to as repetition coding and time diversity. 
 
For most of the coding schemes indicated, above   10 dB, the coding 
improves the error performance. Below this value, however, it is interesting to 
note that the uncoded performance is better than all the coding approaches. This is 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

another manifestation of the error extension behavior of codes as discussed in 
Section 3.4. 
 
3.13.3.3 Slow Frequency Hopping 
 
The channel structure for SFHSS systems is shown in Figure 3.56. At any given 
instant, the signal is located at some channel and the data bits are represented by 
tones spaced around the center frequency of that channel. 
BFSK is Illustrated in Figure 3.56, but in general, MFSK can be implemented 
[24]. 
The performance of a slow frequency hopping BFSK system at any given 
frequency is the same as the performance of a BFSK system that is not hopping. In 
this case, at each hop, there are several bits transmitted. One receiver detector 
structure is shown in Figure 3.57, which is an incoherent radiometer. This 
structure is similar to that for the noncoherent BFSK FFHSS detector except that 
the sums over samples from LF frequencies at the output are missing. A decision is 
made at each bit time as to whether a mark or space was sent. Passing through the 
bandpass filters is noise and possibly a jamming signal. Passing through one of the 
filters is also the signal at that instant. The filter outputs are then detected with a 
square law device and then sampled forming the sampled signals r1k and r2k,   k = 
1, 2, …, LS where LS is the number of bits per hop. The mark sample is subtracted 
from the space sample forming the test statistic z. If z if less than zero, a mark is 
declared, and if z is greater than zero, a space is declared.

When noise is used as the jamming waveform, it usually means an RF carrier 
that is FM modulated with a noise waveform, but not always. When tones are 
used, they are placed in the spectrum so they pass through the space and mark 
bandpass filters in the target system. These filters are normally spaced at a fixed 
offset from the channel center frequency, but within the channel. 
The RF signals received by the antenna are first converted to a fixed, lower 
frequency for subsequent processing. This signal is then filtered to a maximum 
bandwidth of W hertz. A pseudo-random number generator, used at both the 
transmitter and receiver and synchronized, is used to control the frequency of a 
second local oscillator/frequency synthesizer. At any given time, this oscillator is 
tuned to one of the carrier frequencies of the frequency hopping system. 
Depending on the data bit transmitted, either a mark or a space frequency is 
present, which are offset somewhat from the carrier frequency. These tones then 
pass through their respective filters to reduce noise and interference and are then 
(normally) noncoherently detected. While square-law detection is shown here, 
envelope detectors or matched filters could also be used. The outputs of these 
detectors are then sampled for each bit. A bit decision is made every Tb seconds. 
The bit decision (mark or space) is determined by whichever detector output is the 
largest. To avoid energy from the incorrect detector, the frequency separation 
between the two filters must be an integer multiple of the data rate R. 
 
A detection error occurs when a space is transmitted and the jammer or noise 
causes the mark detection channel to detect more energy than the space channel, 
similarly for when a mark is transmitted and a space is detected. 
 
3.13.4 DSSS and FHSS Hybrid Spread Spectrum 
 
DSSS/FHSS systems combine the modulations of DSSS and FHSS to take 
advantage of the benefits of both. DSSS provides covertness and FHSS provides 
frequency diversity that helps the communicator when frequency selective fading 
is present, which it usually is. These systems can be coherent or incoherent. 
Coherent PSK modulation is frequently used for DSSS modulation. The phase of 
the signal is preserved at the receiver and is used to demodulate the signal. When 
the phase cannot be preserved, when there are many simultaneous users of the 
same frequency spectrum, for example, incoherent reception ensues. In general, 
coherent reception results in somewhat better communication performance. 
 
It is difficult to maintain phase coherency when the transmitter makes large 
frequency changes. Therefore, incoherent operation is normal for the FHSS mode. 
Within a dwell, however, phase coherency can be maintained and thus coherent 
PSK can be used for the DSSS modulation.  
 
DSSS/FHSS systems can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous 
operation is when the hopping transitions occur at the same time for all nodes in 
operation sharing the spectrum in a region. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
203
 
In any frequency hopping system, when there are multiple networks sharing 
the spectrum, a transmission from one node can land on the same frequency as 
another node at the same time. This is called a ―hit.‖ The hopping codes are 
normally designed, when possible, to minimize these hits but their total avoidance 
is difficult. When such hits occur, the probability of a symbol error occurring 
increases and must be taken into consideration when designing such systems. 
Because all nodes are synchronous, for synchronous systems, a hit is a total hit in 
the sense that the entire transmission is overlapped. In asynchronous situations a 
hit can be either a total hit or a partial hit, in that only a portion of the dwell 
overlaps. 
 
DSSS/FH SS systems can employ either fast or slow FHSS. Recall that for 
SFHSS, there is more than one data bit transmitted per dwell. In the case of 
DSSS/SFHSS systems, SFHSS means that there is more than one chip sent per 
dwell. For DSSS/FFHSS, a single data bit is sent at multiple dwell frequencies, but 
the data bit is first DSSS modulated to spread the signal. This is shown notionally 
in Figure 3.58 for LF = 3 tones per bit and Nd = 11 chips per dwell. 
The block diagram for a transmitter for DSSS/FHSS hybrid system is shown in 
Figure 3.59. The data sequence d(t) is first DSSS modulated. This signal, c(t), is 
then frequency hopped with the frequency synthesizer. The resultant signal is then 
bandpass filtered and amplified for transmission. 
When DPSK is used as the DSSS modulation, the receiver structure is as 
shown in Figure 3.60. First, the synthesizer and mixer remove the FHSS 
component. The DPSK is then demodulated with the matched filters shown. 
When BFSK is the DSSS modulation used, the receiver structure is as shown 
in Figure 3.61. The FHSS is removed as for DPSK. After that, the BFSK 
component is determined by the detection scheme shown. The signal is delayed by 
Tc, and then match-filter detected. For MFSK, the receive structure is as shown in  
Figure 3.61 with the additional filters added as necessary to account for the 
additional frequencies.

3.13.5 Chaotic Shift Keying 
 
A relatively new technique for digital communication systems is based on chaos 
theory. There have been several such techniques proposed [25–32], but a simple 
one is explained here, called the chaotic shift key (CSK), to get the basic ideas 
across [33]. The overall communication system using CSK is illustrated in Figure 
3.62. 
 
In CSK systems, the digital symbol to be transmitted is added to a chaotic 
signal prior to transmission. Communication systems that utilize CSK employ 
coherent or noncoherent reception. For coherent reception, straightforward CSK is 
used, while for noncoherent reception differential CSK (DCSK) is implemented. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
206
 
 
Figure 3.63 Coherent chaotic communication system employing chaotic shift keying. 
 
The biggest advantage to CSK is its noise-like characteristics, similar to DSSS 
signals. These systems can be used to provide low-level encryption and data 
hiding due to the noise-like nature. 
 
3.13.5.1 Coherent Reception 
 
When coherent reception is employed, the receiver has information about the 
chaotic signal at the transmitter. The receiver must synchronize to the received 
signal using this information. In a binary system, for example, the transmitter 
would encode the data symbol into one of two chaotic signals. The receiver then 
correlates using synchronized replicas of the chaotic signals with the received 
signal and the channel with the largest response is selected as the symbol that was 
transmitted. 
 
A block diagram of a binary coherent CSK system is illustrated in Figure 
3.63. During time interval k, the data stream {k}, where k  {–1, +1}, selects M 
samples {xi0, xi1, ..., xiM}, where i  {1, 2}, from one of two chaotic maps denoted 
by x1 and x2. For simplicity, assume that there is a single chaotic sample source 
(map) denoted by x with samples denoted by xk. If x1 is selected, then sk = xk, and if 
x2 is selected, then sk = –xk. The spreading factor is the number of chaotic map 
samples in one bit interval and is defined as 2. Thus, 2 = M. Therefore, during 
data symbol interval l, the output of the transmitter is

3.13.5.2 Noncoherent Reception 
 
For noncoherent reception, DCSK is the technique used to send data bits. In this 
case, each time slot is divided in half. During the first half time period, a reference 
chaotic signal is sent. During the second half, the data bit is sent. Thus, the first 
half period is compared to the second half. If they are the same, then one symbol 
was sent; if they are different, then the other symbol was sent. 
 
A block diagram of such a noncoherent system is shown in Figure 3.64. At the 
beginning of the bit period l of duration 2, the transmitter switch is in the up 
position transmitting the reference chaotic sequence. At t =  , the switch changes 
to the lower position and the delayed sequence, multiplied by the value of the data 
bit l  {–1, +1}, is transmitted. At the receiver the incoming sequence is delayed 
the same amount . The delayed sequence from the first half bit time is then 
multiplied and accumulated with the sequence in the second half and the result of 
the accumulation is compared with a threshold. If the sum is below the threshold, 
then one symbol is declared, and if above, the other symbol is declared.

3.13.6 Time-Hopping Spread Spectrum  
 
3.13.6.1 Introduction 
 
In this section we examine THSS communication systems. Probably the only such 
technology available for this purpose at the time of this writing is ultrawideband 
(UWB) signals, so that is the technology we will focus on here. We must bear in 
mind that UWB is not the only technology for implementing THSS, however. 
THSS systems transmit short pulses at times that are selected by a pseudo-
random sequence. The optimum detector of signals in AWGN channels is the 
radiometer, which measures the energy content at a point in the RF spectrum. The 
longer the channel is integrated, the better the detection performance. If a short 
pulse is transmitted followed by a long period of silence, then much more noise is 
integrated than signal, and the detection performance deteriorates accordingly. 
This is the fundamental principle behind THSS that provides some of the LPI 
functionality. Another is the pseudo-random placement in time of the data pulses. 
This provides further LPI/LPE capabilities. Lastly, the very narrowband pulses 
transmitted by these systems spread the signal energy across a very wide 
bandwidth, making the PSD at any one channel very small—below the noise. This 
makes it very difficult to detect the presence of the pulse, much as in DSSS.

3.13.6.2 Ultrawideband Systems 
 
UWB communication technology is relatively new, and in the United States, it has 
been approved for use only under extremely limited conditions. Because of its 
potential for interference with so many existing communication services, those 
conditions limit its use to personal area networks (PANs). Such networks are for 
communication between devices either a person is wearing or are otherwise within 
very close proximity. It could be argued that such applications would probably be 
of limited use as EW targets. However, this is not to say that UWB 
communications will forever be limited to this application—a very unlikely 
circumstance. Therefore, we include this examination of the EW performance 
against such systems, especially for urban environments. 
 
A notional comparison of narrowband (NB), wideband (WB), and UWB 
signals is illustrated in Figure 3.65. NB signals, typically 25 kHz wide, are 
normally fairly powerful compared to the noise floor, to be effective at 
communication. WB signals, as typified by 3G PCS CDMA signals, are typically 
several megahertz in width, and utilize notably less power than the NB 
counterparts. UWB signals can occupy several gigahertz, and their power is so low 
it is typically below the noise floor. 
 
A signal is classified as UWB if its bandwidth is 500 MHz or greater or 20% 
or more of its center frequency. UWB communication is also called baseband and 
carrier-free transmission. 
 
UWB communication systems are a relatively new concept that exhibit some 
very useful characteristics, including: 
 
 
Figure 3.65 Frequency spectrum comparison of NB, WB, and UWB.

 
Extremely short-duration pulses that result in ultrawide bandwidth signals 
hundreds to thousands of megahertz); 
 
Extremely low PSD—they qualify as DSSS signals; 
 
Center frequencies typically between 650 MHz and 5 GHz; 
 
Multimile ranges with submicrowave average power levels; 
 
Excellent immunity to jamming, intentional or otherwise; 
 
Exceptional multipath tolerance (most of the time); 
 
Are relatively simple and are less costly to build than radios built using 
other SS technologies; 
 
Consume substantially less power than conventional radios. 
 
Due to their low PSD, impulse radios (another appellation for ultra wideband 
radios) can qualify for type acceptance in the United States under the rules of Part 
15 for unlicensed applications and can share spectrum without affecting 
conventional radio transmissions. This means that any operator anywhere in the 
United States can implement her or his own cell phone system without getting the 
approval of the FCC or any other government agency. 
 
The spectrum of an impulse function is a constant value and an impulse 
function can be approximated in practice. It sometimes consists of a few cycles of 
a carrier signal above 1 GHz, but often is a derivative of a Gaussian function, 
which is easy to generate. 
 
THSS is employed with UWB by randomly varying the pulse times. This TH 
tries to foil the attempts of a receiver to integrate the signal for reliable detection. 
As with other forms of SS technology, such THSS would be controlled by a PN 
sequence. Processing gain is achieved by coherently adding more than one 
impulse per data bit, denoted by L, and the processing gain is given by GL = 10 
log10 L. Additional processing gain is achieved by the low duty cycle of the pulses 
relative to the frame time, Tf. This processing gain is then GT = 10 log10(Tf / Tp). 
The total processing gain is then the sum of these. Thus, if L = 4, Tp = 1 ns, and Tf 
= 1 s (corresponding to an uncoded data rate of 1 Mbps), the GT = 30 dB,   GL = 
6 dB, and Gp = 36 dB. 
 
By using THSS, multiple users can share the same spectrum, by the same 
rationale, employed for DSSS and FHSS. The coding that controls the impulse 
time minimizes the collisions of the pulses. In this example, if perfect coding were 
employed, 1,000 users could share the same spectrum. 
UWB communications is an LPD/LPI technique. The energy in the spectrum 
is spread across such wide bandwidth and the peak power is low, so the spectrum 
looks noise-like, much as a DSSS signal looks noise-like. UWB does not achieve 
such wide bandwidths by applying coding, as in DSSS and FHSS, but by taking 
advantage of the very narrow pulse width.

Figure 3.66 PPM modulation with time hopping for UWB communications. 
 
This form of SS communications achieves AJ capabilities by gating the time 
at which the receiver looks for the impulse, and the gate has a width of 
approximately the width of the impulse—that is, 1 ns or so. This precludes 
jamming energy from having any impact on the receiver except during that gate. 
Time hopping is introduced via pseudo-random coding so that the timing of the 
next frame varies randomly. The PN code is known only to the transmitter and 
receiver.  
 
3.13.6.3 Modulation Formats 
 
PPM, OOK, and PAM are the principal modulation types used for UWB 
communication systems. Channel coding can be applied as well, to improve 
system performance. Each information bit is represented by one or more impulses. 
While the impulse is there, a wide spectrum signal emerges that has very low PSD. 
The time between pulses is typically long enough for the pulse response of the 
channel to die out so there is little ISI. Also, during this time there is no signal in 
the spectrum. 
 
PPM modulation with THSS is illustrated in Figure 3.66. A frame is the 
timeframe within which a time hopped signal occurs. If a zero is sent, the leftmost 
impulse is transmitted, while if a 1 is transmitted, the impulse is delayed for a 
duration Tp where Tp is the impulse width. 
 
In binary PAM (BPAM), an impulse is sent to represent the binary 1 and its 
negative is sent to represent the binary zero. In OOK, the pulse is sent to represent 
the binary one, and no pulse is sent to represent the binary zero. BPAM enjoys a 6 
dB processing advantage over BOOK. 
 
3.13.6.4 UWB Pulse Position Modulation 
 
There are several ways UWB communication systems can be implemented. 
Probably the most popular modulation scheme is PPM, but other methods of 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
212
impressing the information stream onto the carrier, such as OFDM and BPSK, are 
certainly possible.  
In UWB PPM communications, information is conveyed with narrow pulses 
(monocycles), so the RF and analog circuitry is reduced to a wideband low-noise 
amplifier, a correlator and data converters. No up/downconversion or mixer are 
needed, which results in substantial reduction of transceiver size and power 
consumption. A comparison of a direct IF sampling transceiver and a UWB 
transceiver architecture is shown is Figures 3.67 and 3.68. It indicates that a UWB 
transceiver can be implemented with considerably fewer components than the IF 
sampling receiver and can be implemented as a simple chipset with very few off-
chip components.  
In PPM, typically ultrashort ―Gaussian‖ monocycle pulses with carefully 
controlled pulse-to-pulse intervals are transmitted. A Gaussian monocycle is the 
first derivative of the Gaussian pulse shown in Figure 3.69 [34]. The transmitter 
sends the appropriately delayed Gaussian pulse to the antenna. The function of the 
transmitter antenna is to formulate the first derivative of the Gaussian pulse 
yielding the Gaussian monopulse as the actual waveform transmitted shown in 
 
 
Figure 3.67 Traditional IF sampling transceiver architecture. 
 
Figure 3.68 UWB transceiver architecture is much simpler than a superheterodyne receiver.

Figure 3.70 Time waveform of Gaussian monocycle. 
Figure 3.70. At the receive antenna, the function of the antenna is also to find the 
first derivative of the received signal, and that is what is sent to the receiver. 
The widths of these pulses is typically in the 200 ps to 1.5 ns range, while the 
time between data pulses is on the order of 100 ns to 1 s. With these pulse rates, 
data rates on the order of 1 Mbps to 10 Mbps are possible. These short monocycle 
pulses are inherently wideband. For example, a pulse width of 200 ps corresponds 
to a bandwidth of 5 GHz. Typical time-domain and the corresponding frequency

domain performances are illustrated in Figure 3.71. 
  
We will focus on PPM here as the type of modulation that appears to be the 
most flexible and exhibits most of the desirable characteristics of UWB systems. 
The information is conveyed by the position of the pulse, as illustrated in Figure 
3.66. In this case, if a 0 is to be received then the pulse will occur at the receiver at 
time t. If a 1 is to be received, the pulse occurs at t + Tp. As will be explained 
below,  is a fraction between 0 and 1, and Tp is the pulse width.

Information bits are normally transmitted with several (many) pulses, so that a

environment, it is reasonable to approximate the combined effect of the other 
users’ dehopped interfering signals as a Gaussian random process, and thus the 
same reception algorithm can be used [35]. 
The PSD of a UWB PPM signal is illustrated in Figure 3.72. We can see that 
the envelope of the PSD follows (3.165), but the actual PSD consists of impulse 
functions at the multiples of the symbol rate. These impulse functions occur at the 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
217
harmonics of the data rate. The impulses can be minimized by dithering the data 
signal [37]. 
 
3.13.6.5 Regulatory Emission Limits 
 
Since UWB technology is, by definition, wideband, it has the potential to interfere 
with many other RF signals if the power is high enough. Therefore, in 2002 in the 
United States, the FCC developed a power level mask that defines, depending on 
the frequency, how powerful a UWB single can be. That mask is shown 
graphically in Figure 3.73 along with several previously approved services. It is 
these services that dictated the structure of the mask. Because the signal must 
traverse at least one wall to propagate from inside a building to outside, there is a 
different mask depending on whether the UWB system is operating inside or 
outside a building. These two masks are illustrated in Figure 3.73, along with a 
similar mask adopted by CEPT in Europe. 
 
 
3.13.6.6 Monocycle Shapes for UWB Communications 
 
Unfortunately, the Gaussian monopulse does not satisfy the FCC limit. This is 
illustrated in Figure 3.74, where the spectrum of the monopulse is compared with 
the outdoor limit. Therefore, other possible monocycle shapes were investigated. 
UWB is a baseband technology, and thus the choice of the monocycle shape 
will affect the performance. Several possible monocycles (duration Tp = 0.5 ns for 
specificity) for UWB are discussed in this section.

The nominal center frequency and bandwidth of this monocycle depend on the 
pulse width. Bandwidth is approximately 116% of the center frequency, so the 
UWB criteria on bandwidth is clearly met. The spectrum of the time hopped UWB 
signal is asymmetrical. As seen, the monocycle has a single zero crossing. If 
additional derivatives of the Gaussian function are used, the relative bandwidth 
decreases and the center frequency increases for fixed time delay. 
The transmit antenna for such wideband signals serves as a highpass filter and 
as such essentially differentiates the transmitted impulses [37, 38]. The number of 
differentiations depends on the type of antenna. If the Gaussian monopulse is used 
as the transmit impulse function, then the second derivative of the Gaussian 
function is what is received. If the third derivative is used as the impulse function, 
then the received impulse is the fourth derivative, and so on.

If the transmitter produces the Gaussian pulse and sends it to the antenna, the 
antenna effectively computes the first derivative of the pulse, and transmits that 
signal. The Gaussian monocycle is given by the first derivative of the Gaussian

where Eb is the energy per bit and Ppeak is the peak power of the UWB signal. This 
peak power occurs over a very short period of time, however, so the time-averaged 
power is quite low. The spectrum is more or less constant over a considerable 
range. Typical frequencies are 1.5 GHz with greater than 25% fractional 
bandwidth, as previously mentioned. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
221
For realistic values of the parameters, the communication range of UWB 
technologies is relatively small, especially for ground-to-ground based 
applications (multiple-mile ranges have been achieved). Signals above 1 GHz 
require antennas with considerable gain to extend beyond a few kilometers due to 
the R–4 propagation characteristics close to the earth and the inverse dependency of 
received power on frequency. Considerable data rates are possible, making such 
technology potentially applicable to ad hoc, multinode communication networks 
such as those for sensor field communications, for example, or video transmission 
over short ranges. However, air-to-ground or air-to-air communications would 
enjoy much better range performance where the propagation is proportional to R–2.

The half power bandwidth is 116% of the center frequency and since fc defines the 
pulse width, then the pulse width specifies both the center frequency and 
bandwidth. In practice, the center frequency of a pulse is approximately the 
reciprocal of the pulse’s length and the bandwidth is approximately equal to the 
center frequency. Thus, for the 0.5 ns pulse shown in Figure 3.71, the center 
frequency and the half power bandwidth are approximately 2 GHz.

where Tp is the pulse width and W is its bandwidth. Thus, when f = 2 GHz, a 25% 
fractional bandwidth is 500 MHz, and Tp  0.5 ns. The spectra of a Gaussian 
monopulse of a few typical durations are shown in Figure 3.75. 
 
The First Seven Derivatives. The time waveforms of the first seven derivatives of 
the Gaussian pulse are illustrated in Figure 3.76, while the corresponding PSDs are 
shown in Figure 3.77 along with the FCC mask. As is evident, the seventh 
derivative is the minimum order derivative that satisfies the outdoor mask while 
the fifth derivative satisfies the indoor mask. It is also evident that as the order

increases, the bandwidth is reduced somewhat. In addition, as the order increases, 
the number of zero crossings increases by one for each increase in order. This 
implies that the frequency is increasing, which is evident from Figure 3.77. 
The value of  varies according to the derivative order as shown in Table 3.8. 
This table also lists the important frequency information of the first seven 
derivatives. 
 
Other Possible Waveforms 
 
The Gaussian pulse and Gaussian monocycle are arguably the most prolific 
waveforms used in UWB PPM communication systems. Some others are also 
useful, however, and a few are summarized in Table 3.9 [34]. Quickly plotting the 
FCC limits on the PSDs listed in Table 3.9 shows that there are several regions for 
each of the PSDs that exceed the limits. 
Waveforms other than the Gaussian monocycle are also possible candidates for 
UWB communication systems, especially if the FCC mask is not a factor. In this 
section we present a few and compare their BER performance with simulations. 
The waveforms along with their PSDs are illustrated in Table 3.9. 
 
Scholtz Monocycle. The Scholtz monocycle is very similar to the second derivative 
of the Gaussian monocycle so its performance would be expected to be similar. 
 
Manchester Monocycle. The Manchester monocycle has amplitude A during the 
first half of the monocycle width and has amplitude –A during the latter half. 
 
RZ-Manchester Monocycle. The return-to-zero Manchester monocycle has 
amplitude A and –A for only a portion of each half monocycle width. 
 
Sine Monocycle. The sine monocycle is simply just one period of a sine wave.

Performance 
 
Simulations of the different monocycle shapes for UWB help to illustrate the 
trade-offs among the effects of the monocycle shapes on the design of filters, the 
choice of receiver bandwidth, the antenna design, the bit error rate performance, 
and the multipath performance. The spectrum characteristics of these monocycles 
and their bit error rate performances in an AWGN are compared by simulation. 
The spectrum characteristics for these monocycles are illustrated in Table 3.9. In 
the bit error rate simulations, every monocycle width is chosen to be 0.5 ns, and 
the ratio of Tf and Tm is set to be 1,024. 
 
Monocycle Spectrum Characteristics. Unlike the conventional narrowband 
communication systems, it is desirable for UWB signaling to spread the energy as 
widely in frequency as possible to minimize the PSD. As shown in Table 3.9, 
Gaussian pulse and rectangle monocycle have DC components, which may reduce 
the antenna radiating efficiency. The Scholtz monocycle, the Gaussian monocycle 
and the RZ-Manchester monocycles have wider 3 dB bandwidth than others. 
 
BER Performances in AWGN Channel. As discussed previously, the optimum 
receiver in AWGN is a correlation receiver. As obvious from (3.158), the 
modulation parameter  will affect the BER, since Tm is the length of the delay 
between a zero and one in PPM (see Figure 3.66). The optimal choice of  for a 
given received monocycle on a single link is given by [35]

where Tm is the monocycle duration. Note that when  is greater 
than one, wrec(t) and wrec(t – ) are orthogonal. Therefore, opt can be chosen as 
one. To compare the BER performance, opt for the Gaussian pulse, the Gaussian 
monocycle, the Scholtz monocycle, the Manchester monocycle, the RZ 
Manchester monocycle, the sine monocycle, and the rectangle monocycle are first 
determined by using (3.172). In this case, optTm are given by 0.5 ns (opt = 1), 
0.1917 ns (opt = 0.3834), 0.125 ns (opt = 0.025), 0.25 ns (opt = 0.5), 0.25 ns (opt 
= 0.5), 0.25 ns (opt = 0.5), and 0.5 ns (opt = 1), respectively. The simulation 
results are illustrated in Figure 3.78 [40]. It shows that the performances of the 
Scholtz, Manchester, RZ-Manchester, sine and Gaussian monocycles are 
somewhat better than those of the Gaussian pulse and rectangle monocycle, 
although the results are within 2 dB of each other.  
 
Summary. In this section, we investigated several candidate monocycle shapes for 
UWB. Their single-link performances are simulated and compared. The results 
show that monocycle shape affects the PPM BER; however, the performance in all

cases is very similar. The monocycle shape also determines the spectrum 
characteristics of UWB signals. 
 
Of those monocycles we discussed, only the seventh-order derivative of the 
Gaussian monocycle complies with the FCC mask. All the other monocycles 
exceed the mask in most of the spectrum. 
 
3.13.6.7 Jam Resistance and Processing Gain 
 
Processing gain is a measure of the communication system’s resistance to 
interference and UWB has a huge processing gain. One definition of processing 
gain is the ratio of the bandwidth of the signal to the bandwidth of the information 
signal. For example, IS-95 spread spectrum system with 8 kHz of information 
bandwidth and a 1.25 MHz channel bandwidth yields a processing gain of 156 (22 
dB). An impulse system transmitting the same 8 kHz information bandwidth and a 
2 GHz channel bandwidth the processing gain is 250,000 or 54 dB. 
Other ways of calculating the processing gain for a UWB signal are: 
 
 
The duty cycle of the transmission (e.g., a 1% duty cycle yields a process 
gain of 20 dB); 
 
The effect of integrating over multiple pulses to recover the information 
(e.g., integrating energy over 100 pulses to determine one digital bit 
yields a process gain of 20 dB); 
 
The total process gain is then 40 dB. 
 
Thus, a 2 GHz/10 Mpps link transmitting 8 kbps would have a process gain of 54 
dB, because it has a 0.5 ns pulse width with a 100 ns pulse repetition interval = 
0.5% duty cycle (23 dB) and 10 Mpps/8,000 bps = 1,250 pulses per bit (another 31 
dB). 
 
3.13.6.8 Multipath and Propagation 
 
Multipath fading is less of a problem for UWB systems than for conventional 
communication systems. In fact, Rayleigh fading, so noticeable in cellular 
communications, is a continuous wave phenomenon, not an impulse 
communications phenomenon. In an impulse system, in order for there to be 
multipath effects, one of the following special conditions must exist: 
 
 
The path length traveled by the multipath pulse must be less than the 
pulse width times the speed of light. For a 2 GHz pulse, that equals  0.15 
m or about 1/2 ft, that is, [1/2 ns]  [300,000,000 meters/second]. This is 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
230
illustrated in Figure 3.79, in the case where the pulse traveling path 1 
arrives one half a pulse width after the direct path pulse. 
 
 
The multipath pulse travels a distance that equals multiples of the interval 
of time between pulses multiplied by the speed of light. For a 1 Mpps 
system, that would be equal to traveling an extra 300, 600, and 900 
meters. However, because each individual pulse is subject to the pseudo-
random dither, these pulses are decorrelated. 
 
Pulses traveling between these intervals do not cause self-interference. In Figure 
3.79, this is illustrated by the pulse traveling path 2, while pulses traveling grazing 
paths, as illustrated in Figure 3.79 by path 1, create impulse radio multipath 
effects. Figure 3.80 shows how easy it is to resolve multipath impulse signals in 
the time domain. Note that the receive antenna’s characteristics convert the 
Gaussian monocycle into a ―W‖ waveform as seen in Figure 3.80. The first 
arriving pulse (between 3 ns and 6 ns) is of a lower amplitude because it traveled 
through more walls than some later arriving pulses (the pulse arriving at between 8 
ns and 11 ns). 
UWB PPM communication systems have a far superior performance in high 
multipath environments than narrowband systems, as well as DSSS systems. 
Multipath is a critical problem for most communication systems in urban 
environments because there are many objects that reflect RF signals. In these 
environments, UWB systems can operate at high data rates with lower bit error 
rates and with lower transmit powers.

3.14 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing 
 
This section will review the fundamental characteristics of orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, and also discuss common impairments 
and how, in some cases, OFDM mitigates their effect. Where applicable, the 
impairment effects and techniques will be compared to those in a single carrier 
system. 
 
3.14.1 Single-Carrier Modulation System 
 
A typical single-carrier modulation spectrum is shown in Figure 3.81. A single 
carrier system modulates information onto one carrier using frequency, phase, or 
amplitude adjustment of the carrier. For digital signals, the information is in the 
form of symbols that are modulated onto the carrier. As higher data rates are used, 
the duration of one bit or symbol of information becomes shorter. The system 
becomes more susceptible to loss of information from impulse noise, signal 
 
Figure 3.80 UWB multiple multipath examples. 
 
 
Figure 3.81 Single carrier spectrum. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
232
reflections, and other impairments. These impairments can impede the ability to 
recover the information sent. In addition, as the symbol rate increases, ceteris 
paribus, the bandwidth used by a single carrier system, increases, and the 
susceptibility to interference from other continuous signal sources becomes 
greater. 
 
3.14.2 Frequency Division Multiplexing Modulation System 
 
Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) extends the concept of single carrier 
modulation by using multiple subcarriers within the same single channel. This 
combination of subcarriers is frequently moved in frequency as a group. The total 
data rate to be sent in the channel is divided between the various subcarriers. The 
data do not have to be divided evenly, nor do they have to originate from the same 
information source or even have similar statistical properties. Advantages include 
using separate modulation/demodulation customized to a particular type of data, or 
sending out banks of dissimilar data that can be best sent using multiple, and 
possibly different, modulation schemes. 
FDM systems, an example of a spectrum for which there are three subcarriers, 
as illustrated in Figure 3.82, usually require a guard band between modulated 
subcarriers to prevent the spectrum of one subcarrier from interfering with 
another. These guard bands lower the system’s effective information rate when 
compared to a single carrier system with similar modulation because the spectral 
efficiency is less. 
 
3.14.3 Orthogonality and OFDM 
 
If the FDM system shown in Figure 3.82 used a set of subcarriers that were 
orthogonal to each other, a higher level of spectral efficiency could be achieved. 
 
 
Figure 3.82 Frequency division multiplexing spectrum. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
233
The guard bands that were necessary to allow individual demodulation of 
subcarriers in an FDM system would no longer be necessary. The use of 
orthogonal subcarriers would allow the subcarriers’ spectra to overlap, thus 
increasing the spectral efficiency.  
As pointed out in (3.11), if the dot product of two deterministic signals is 
equal to zero, these signals are said to be orthogonal to each other. Similarly, if 
two stochastic processes are uncorrelated, then they are orthogonal. OFDM is 
usually implemented in practice using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The 
sinusoids of the DFT form an orthogonal basis set, and a signal in the vector space 
of the DFT can be represented as a linear combination of these orthogonal 
sinusoids. One view of the DFT is that the transform essentially correlates its input 
signal with each of the sinusoidal basis functions. If the input signal has some 
energy at a certain frequency, there will be a peak in the correlation of the input 
signal and the basis sinusoid at that frequency. This transform is used at the 
OFDM transmitter to map an input signal onto the orthogonal basis functions of 
the DFT, which form a set of orthogonal subcarriers. Similarly, the transform is 
used again at the OFDM receiver to process the received subcarriers. The signals 
from the subcarriers are then combined to form an estimate of the source signal 
from the transmitter. Since the basis functions of the DFT are uncorrelated, the 
correlation performed in the DFT for a given subcarrier only sees energy for that 
corresponding subcarrier. The energy from other subcarriers does not contribute 
because it is uncorrelated. This separation of signal energy is the reason that the 
OFDM subcarriers’ spectra can overlap without causing interference. Figure 3.83 
illustrates an OFDM spectrum where there are nine subcarriers. Notice that where 
each of the spectra for the subcarriers peaks, all the other spectra are zero. This is a 
feature of the orthogonality of the subcarriers. Each of these subcarriers carries its 
own information stream that may or may not be related to the information streams 
in the other subcarriers. 
 
3.14.4 Implementation of OFDM Systems 
 
The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the inverse discrete Fourier transform 
(IDFT) are used in OFDM systems because they can be viewed as mapping data 
onto orthogonal subcarriers. For example, the IDFT is used to take in frequency-
domain data and convert it to time-domain data. In order to perform that operation, 
the IDFT correlates the frequency-domain input data with its orthogonal basis 
functions, which are sinusoids at certain frequencies. This correlation is equivalent 
to mapping the input data onto the sinusoidal basis functions. 
In practice, the DFT and IDFT are implemented with the fast Fourier 
transform (FFT) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) blocks. An OFDM 
system treats the source symbols (e.g., the QPSK or QAM symbols that would be 
present in a single carrier system) at the transmitter as though they are in the 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
234
frequency domain. These symbols are used as the inputs to an IFFT block that 
converts the signal into the time domain. The IFFT takes in N symbols at a time 
where N is the number of subcarriers in the system. Each of these N input symbols 
has a symbol period of T seconds. Recall that the basis functions for an IFFT are N 
orthogonal sinusoids. These sinusoids each have a different frequency and the 
lowest frequency is DC. Each input symbol acts like a complex weight for the 
corresponding sinusoidal basis function. Since the input symbols are complex, the 
value of the symbol determines both the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid for 
that subcarrier. The IFFT output is then summed over all N sinusoids. Thus, the 
IFFT block provides a simple way to modulate data onto N orthogonal subcarriers. 
The block of N output samples from the IFFT make up a single OFDM symbol. 
The length of the OFDM symbol is NT, where T is the IFFT input symbol period 
mentioned above. 
The time domain signal that results from the IFFT is transmitted across the 
channel to the receiver over at least one path. At the receiver, an FFT block is used 
to convert it back into the frequency domain. Ideally (lacking significant noise, 
interference, and ISI), the FFT output will be the original symbols that were sent 
to the IFFT at the transmitter. When plotted in the complex plane, the FFT output 
samples will form a constellation, such as 16-QAM shown in Figure 3.84. The 
block diagram in Figure 3.84 illustrates the conversions between the frequency 
domain, the time domain, and back again in an OFDM system and shows in this 
case how the 16 QAM signal is reconstructed. 
 
3.14.5 Multipath Channels and the Use of Cyclic Prefix 
 
A major problem in most wireless communication systems is the presence of at 
least one multipath channel. In a multipath environment, the transmitted signal 
 
Figure 3.83 OFDM spectrum. 

Signaling for Modern Communications 
235
reflects off of several objects as it traverses from the transmitter to the receiver(s). 
As a result, multiple delayed versions of the transmitted signal arrive at the 
receiver. The multiple versions of the signal can cause the received signal to be 
distorted. 
A multipath channel will cause two problems for an OFDM system. The first 
problem is ISI, illustrated in Figure 3.85. This problem occurs when the received 
OFDM symbol is distorted by the previously transmitted OFDM symbol. The 
effect is similar to the ISI that occurs in a single-carrier system. However, in that 
case, the interference is usually due to several previous symbols instead of just the 
previous symbol; the symbol period in single carrier systems is typically much 
shorter than the time span of the channel (the delay time of the longest significant 
delayed component), whereas the typical OFDM symbol period is much longer 
than the time span of the channel. The second problem is unique to multicarrier 
systems and is called the intrasymbol interference. It is the result of interference 
among a given OFDM symbol’s own subcarriers. 
 
3.14.5.1 Intersymbol Interference 
 
Perhaps the biggest advantage of OFDM is its ability to essentially remove ISI. 
Assume that the time span of the channel is L samples long. Instead of a single 
carrier with a data rate of R sps, an OFDM system has N subcarriers, each with a 
data rate of R / N sps. Because the data rate is reduced by a factor of N in each 
subcarrier, the OFDM symbol period is lengthened by a factor of N. By choosing 
an appropriate value for N, the length of the OFDM symbol becomes longer than 
the time span of the channel. Because of this configuration, the effect of ISI is the 
distortion of the first L samples of the received OFDM symbol. An example of this 
effect is shown in Figure 3.85. By noting that only the first few samples of the 
symbol are distorted, we can use a guard interval to remove the effect of ISI. For 
 
Figure 3.84 Simplified OFDM system. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
236
example, the guard interval could be a section of all zero samples transmitted in 
front of each OFDM symbol. Since it does not contain any useful information, the 
guard interval would be discarded at the receiver. If the length of the guard 
interval is properly chosen such that it is longer than the time span of the channel, 
the OFDM symbol itself will not be distorted. Thus, by discarding the samples 
from the guard interval, the effects of intersymbol interference are eliminated as 
well. 
 
In OFDM an all-zero guard interval is not really used because it is 
impractical. Instead, the cyclic prefix is inserted during this time interval. Its 
samples are still thrown away at the receiver, but it provides some useful 
properties that an all-zero guard interval does not have. 
 
 
3.15 Concluding Remarks 
 
The most common forms of spread spectrum AJ communication techniques, 
DSSS, FHSS, and THSS, were discussed in this chapter. These were developed 
primarily to, if not defeat, then certainly to mitigate the effects of jamming. This 
was the motivation of the military for such development, but the advantages of, in 
particular, DSSS for providing CDMA, and FHSS for GSM, to commercial

streams exhibiting ISI caused by the time delay of reflected signal at the receiver.

cellular communications has become obvious. Thus, the capabilities of DSSS and 
FHSS have found a niche in the commercial telephone market and THSS is 
emerging. Methods to counter the advantages of SS are the subject of the 
remainder of this book. 
In this chapter we discussed the performance of the main types of modulation 
used in SS systems. This analysis resulted in expressions for the BER (Pe) as a 
function of the SNR of the signal. It was shown that for the postdetection SNRs 
expected to be achieved in these communications systems (>10 dB) the BER of 
BPSK is 10–5 or better while that for the higher modulations, 4QAM and 16QAM, 
the BER is about 10–3 or better.

Antijam Signal Detection 
 
 
4.1 Introduction 
 
In many cases of practical utility, the presence of signals must be established 
before jamming is initiated. There are several reasons for this to include avoiding 
possible friendly fratricide, to conserve energy in the jammer, and to ascertain that 
the target has not moved in frequency. Determining such presence in this context 
is called detection. We specifically address AJ signal detection in this chapter. 
 There are several authoritative sources of information on SS signal detection. 
Dillard and Dillard [1] focus specifically on the topic and present many design 
charts and equations that can be used to ascertain detection capability. The 
handbook by Simon et al. [2] provides much signal design information if you are 
interested in designing SS communication systems. Other excellent sources for SS 
system design are the books by Peterson et al. [3] and Torrieri [4], the latter of 
which also includes some intercept and EW information. Dixon [5] was one of the 
first to write a book on the topic and remains an excellent source. A book covering 
only CDMA DSSS systems was written by Viterbi [6]. Nicholson [7] prepared a 
book describing how to design signals to be LPI. Since there are several excellent 
sources, the information contained in this chapter is sufficient to introduce the 
reader to the subject, but is not a complete treatise. Also presented are the results 
of an extensive simulation on the detectability of such signals. 
 
This chapter is organized as follows. We begin with an introduction to the 
types of receivers typically used for the detection of AJ signals. We then discuss 
detection of DSSS signals by various means, some of which are specific to a type 
of signal while some are more general (such as the radiometer discussed Chapter 
2). Detection techniques for THSS/UWB signals are presented next. Detectors and 
their performance for FHSS systems are then presented. Finally, the results of a 
performance simulation are presented where the target environment consisted of 
several networks of SFH signals.

4.2 Signal Detection 
 
Signal detection is for the purpose of controlling the jammer. As such, parameters 
associated with signals are estimated in the detection process. The frequency, time 
of intercept, and power (or amplitude) of the signals being detected are 
determined. In addition, the type of modulation of the signals is a parameter that is 
important in order to properly match the jamming waveform to the signals. 
How signals are detected depends on the characteristics of the signal. Optimal 
strategies to detect analog signals are different from those for digital signals. 
Strategies for nonspread signals are different from those for spread signals. If 
spread, the strategies are different for DSSS signals and FHSS signals [1, 8–10]. 
 
Simply detecting the presence of an FHSS signal in a crowded spectrum is 
rarely sufficient. The theoretical calculations on the ability to detect targets form 
bounds on possible performance, however. It is almost always necessary to 
perform measurements on detected signals to sort them and attempt to associate 
one hop with previous ones. Therefore, except for the simplest cases when BBN or 
PBN jamming can be used, aspects of follower jamming are almost always 
implemented in practice.  
 
 
4.3 Receivers 
 
RF receivers are used for the detection of AJ communication signals. They are 
used to convert the frequency of the intercepted signal to some lower frequency 
range where the signal can be processed. In some cases, the receiver itself provides 
demodulation and detection functions. Sometimes these are provided by modules 
external to the receiver. The particular receiver employed will vary in architecture 
depending on the types of signals to be detected. Such receivers usually either 
have a wide instantaneous bandwidth in order to receive a significant portion of 
the signals, or they must scan the frequency spectrum very fast, essentially 
emulating wideband receivers. Some of the general characteristics of receivers are 
covered here. 
 
The role of receivers in EW, in particular ES, is to detect or intercept targets, 
in the shortest possible time. However, the bandwidth in which targets operate, 
especially AJ targets, may span a wider bandwidth than is practically 
instantaneously covered by a receiver. In order to cope with this very large 
bandwidth, a widely favored receiver architecture employs a receiver of a more 
modest bandwidth with an agile center frequency. The frequency-swept 
superheterodyne receiver is an example of this sort of receiver.  
 
There are two general types of receivers used for these functions. Due to the 
wideband characteristic of AJ signal, be they DSSS, THSS, or FHSS, the receivers 
must be able to tune, usually rapidly, over that bandwidth. They can also be staring 

Antijam Signal Detection 
243
receivers where a significant portion of the entire bandwidth is within the pass- 
band of the receiver. 
 
4.3.1 Staring Receivers 
 
Staring receivers do not change their frequency, but stay tuned to the same place. 
While their input is normally fairly wideband, that need not be the case. FHSS 
systems, for example, could hop into the bandwidth of a relatively narrow 
bandwidth receiver. Such detection performance, however, is neither reliable nor 
robust. 
 
Digital receivers for SS signal detection, which are typically staring over 
limited bands, were examined extensively by Tsui [11]. A single digital receiver 
with substantial dynamic range, for example, can cover the low VHF range. Wide 
dynamic range is important so that close, usually friendly, transmitters do not 
saturate the receiver, thereby precluding the reception of weak, distant targets. 
 
4.3.2 Scanning Receivers 
 
Scanning receivers measure energy in a (relatively) narrow bandwidth while being 
tuned over a wider bandwidth. There are two types of these receivers: scanning 
superheterodyne and compressive. The former typically has a much narrower 
instantaneous bandwidth than the latter and therefore a finer frequency resolution. 
On the other hand, the latter are considerably faster than the former and therefore 
possess a much higher probability of detection, when sensitivity and dynamic 
range are not issues. 
 
4.3.2.1 Superheterodyne Receiver 
 
One method to measure the energy of an FHSS signal and determine the hop 
frequencies is with a scanning narrowband superheterodyne receiver. This receiver 
will not detect every hop, but it has been shown that several hops in a 5 second 
transmission of an FHSS transmitter can be detected [12]. A simplified block 
diagram of such a configuration is shown in Figure 4.1. Such a system linearly 
changes its frequency with time, and the output of an envelope detector is used to 
estimate the location of the frequency of energy incident to the receiver [13].

Many modern superheterodyne receivers are digitally tuned, which means that 
a digital command rather than a voltage level as shown in Figure 4.1 tunes the 
local oscillator. This configuration is shown in Figure 4.2. A receiver such as this 
dwells at a frequency channel, the width of which is determined by the bandpass

filter. A typical dwell might be 10 ms, or it could match the hop rate of a specific 
target. Digitally controlled synthesizers (NCO) such as the one shown here can 
tune from one frequency to the next rapidly, especially if the next frequency 
channel is adjacent to the current one. In fact, with two digitally controlled 
synthesizers, one could be tuning to the next frequency while the other one is used 
to collect data at the current channel. In that case the tuning time is the time it 
takes to switch between oscillators and the settling time of the bandpass filter—
typically approximately 1 / WF when WF is the width of the filter. 
A narrowband receiver system is simulated in [12], for example, where the 
narrowband receiver is scanned across the FHSS system’s bandwidth to ascertain 
detectability of an FHSS system. 
 
4.3.2.2 Compressive Receiver 
 
A compressive receiver performs a continuous fast scan over a frequency range of 
interest. In the case of SS systems that region of interest would be Wss or a 
substantial fraction of it. These receivers can scan several hundreds of megahertz 
in microseconds, facilitating a high probability of detection performance. One 
such configuration is shown in Figure 4.3. The incoming signal r(t) is mixed with 
a VCO signal whose output is given by

The output of the compressive filter has energy at a time corresponding to the 
location in frequency of the input signal. Thus, a time to frequency transformation 
has occurred. By measuring the time from the start of the sweep to when that 
energy appears, an estimate of the frequency can be determined along with an 
estimate of the energy in the signal [12, 16–21]. 
 
Compressive receivers have been analyzed for the intercept of frequency 
hopping targets [17, 20] and for the intercept of DSSS systems [21]. Results are 
shown in Figure 4.4 for the former and in Figure 4.5 for the latter. The SNR in

compressive receiver is much higher than the radiometer.

both these charts is based on all of Wss as the noise source. An SNR of –15 dB 
over Wss = 50 MHz corresponds to an SNR of –15 + 33 = 18 dB over a channel 
bandwidth of 25 kHz, for example. In Figure 4.4, if Tb is the data bit time, then    
T1 = mTb is the duration of the compressive filter impulse response, Ts = MTb is the 
scan period, and  is the SNR. BTs is the product of the bandwidth of the 
compressive filter and the scan period.  
 
Notice that in Figure 4.4, the results are based on 1,000 observations. Since 
the compressive receiver scans every 100 s in this example, the data applies to 
100 ms of signal samples, implying a maximum target hop rate of 10 hps. 
Compressive receivers can handle faster hop rate targets, but the performance is 
less than that shown in Figure 4.4 because of the fewer samples available. 
 
4.3.3 Detectors 
 
Detectors are those parts of receivers that perform the function of determining the 
presence of specific signals. The two kinds of detectors considered here are 
matched filters with envelope detection and radiometers. In addition, the filter 
bank combiner that uses them is discussed. 
 
4.3.3.1 Matched Filter 
 
A matched filter followed by an envelope detector is frequently implemented in 
SS detectors [22]. Matched filters are optimum detectors. A filter is matched to a 
signal r(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ T if its impulse response is given by 
 
Figure 4.5 ROC for DSSS signal detection. (Source: [21]. © IEEE 1991. Reprinted with permission.)

The output of such a filter in response to r(t) at its input has a peak when t = T, and 
the value of that peak is Rxx(0) [23]. 
 
One of the advantages of matched filters in detectors is their processing gain. 
Denote the output SNR of the filters as o and that at the input i. Then

where WF is the noise bandwidth of the filter. Thus, the output SNR can be larger 
than that at the input by the factor 2TWF. For measuring for the presence of DSSS 
signals, for example, T and WF can be quite large, say, T = 10 seconds and WF = 10 
MHz, yielding a 83 dB processing gain. Practical matters would limit this to 
something less than 83 dB; nevertheless, the gain can be substantial. Note that WF 
should not be larger than that of the signal for which detection is desired. If it is, 
then more noise and possibly other signals are admitted into the detection process 
than need to be. 
 
Matched filters can be implemented in analog or digital form. Surface 
acoustic wave (SAW) devices are popular analog device choices for matched-filter 
construction, but with the progress in high-speed digital components, digital 
implementations are the method of choice when possible. Digital implementations 
allow easily changing the configuration as technology progresses, whereas a SAW 
implementation would require changing the hardware. One configuration for a 
digital matched filter is illustrated in Figure 4.6. The delayed input signals  r(k – j)

The values of the weights are determined by the signal to which the filter is 
matched. 
 
Since matched filters are designed to match specific signals about which all is 
known, they are of limited use for detection of generally unknown signals in 
general-purpose, noncooperative EW systems. Of course, in those cases where the 
signal specifics are totally known, the matched filter is the optimum way to detect 
the signal. In many cases, enough is known about the SOI that some of the 
matched filter concepts can be employed, however. In addition, detailed 
knowledge is required on how matched filters work for EA purposes, discussed 
elsewhere in this book. A much more promising candidate for the general-purpose 
EW system is the energy detector, also known as a radiometer, which we 
discussed in Chapter 2. 
 
4.3.4 Filter Bank Combiner 
 
When several parallel channels of radiometers or matched filters are implemented, 
then the configuration is called a filter bank combiner (FBC), one configuration of 
which is shown in Figure 4.7 [24–26]. There are Nc paths in the FBC, each tuned 
to the center frequency of a channel where Nc is the number of channels in Wss.

Each such path could consist of a radiometer followed by a threshold detector, a 
matched filter followed by an envelope detector and threshold detector, or any 
other mechanism for energy detection. If the threshold is exceeded in a path, the 
logical output of the threshold detector is a 1, and the OR output is 1 whenever any 
of the inputs is a 1. After a measurement interval defined by M dwells, a detection 
is declared if the output of the summing device exceeds the detection threshold th.  
When there is a path for each possible channel in Wss, then the system shown 
in Figure 4.7 is called an FBC. When there are fewer than that, it is called a partial 
band FBC (PB FBC). Due to implementation complexity, in most cases of 
practical interest, the PB FBC is implemented [1].  
 
Usually the overall performance of a detector would be specified in terms of 
Pd and Pfa—typically in the form of performance versus SNR. With this 
information, the per-channel detection and false alarm probabilities can be 
obtained from [28]

when th = 1 and Nc and Nh (Nh are the number of hops in a message) are 
adequately large, where TM is the message duration, Pd is the overall probability of 
detection, and Pfa is the overall probability of false alarm. The SNR required to 
achieve these performance levels is given by [26].

The last step follows because Nc = Wss/Wh. The SNR is plotted in Figure 4.8 with 
parameters compatible with the low VHF band. In this case th = 1, so that a single 
hit is all that is necessary to declare detection. As the length of the message 
increases past 3 seconds or so, the SNR required to achieve Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 10–4 
gets smaller than 10 dB, even for a single hit requirement. For these numbers to 
apply, however, there can be only a single signal present in Wss so, again, it 
describes a bounding case that is unlikely to occur in practice. 
For an optimum FBC, M = Nh, where Nh is the number of hops in the message. 
Obviously, then, a PB FBC is a suboptimal detector. 
FBC performance is illustrated in Figure 4.9 compared to a compressive 
receiver for the same parameters. The FBC is only slightly better than the 
compressive receiver in this case, indicating that the realizable compressive 
receiver is a good approximation to the FBC. 
 
 
4.3.4.1 Stepping Wideband Radiometer 
 
Radiometers were discussed at length in Chapter 2. We briefly discuss their 
application to receivers here.  
A simplified block diagram of a receiver with an embedded radiometer is 
shown in Figure 4.10. Up until the last stages of the IF chain the receiver is the 
same as described previously. The last stage of the IF chain provides for noise 
limiting to constrain the amount of noise input to the radiometer. After such

Krasner formulated the wideband radiometer detection performance 
evaluation as a nonlinear programming problem [27]. His analysis assumed that a 
wideband radiometer was stepped across a frequency span, dwelling at a channel 
for a period of time and that Pd and Pfa are specified, for each dwell (need not be 
the same for each dwell). The goal was to find the optimal dwell times for each

dwell, assumed to be different, in general. We will summarize that analysis in this 
section.  
We assume that a filter of bandwidth WF is stepping through a band of total 
width W in search of a signal of bandwidth Ws. In our applications, W is fixed but 
larger than Ws, and the filter and signal have ideal rectangular shapes in magnitude 
versus frequency. We further assume that there is a total of M steps to be searched 
within the band W. These steps may either be disjoint or may overlap. If the signal 
to be detected may occur in any location within the input passband, then the 
adjacent steps should overlap by at least Ws to ensure that in one of the steps the 
signal is wholly contained within the stepping filter’s passband. This will 
maximize the probability of detecting the signal. Overlap of adjacent steps by Ws 
implies a number of steps equal to (W – Ws)/(WF – Ws), assuming that this quantity 
is an integer. Note that there are no repeats of dwell bands. W is searched from one 
end to the other one time. What happens if repeat sweeps are allowed, which is a 
much more probable scenario? 
For simplicity we assume that the SOI has energy in only one of the M steps. 
This is a fair approximation for the case in which W >> Ws and adjacent steps are 
overlapped by Ws. Then the probability that the signal of interest straddles two 
steps is small. 
The basic parameters are the dwell times of the steps, which we denote by Ti,  
i = 0, …, M – 1. In general,

Total time T is measured in ―steps.‖ We assume that the dwell time at each 
step is sufficiently long that square-law detection followed by integration at each 
step yields an output statistic that is Gaussian. As such a dwell step might be on 
the order of 1 ms, the total time of 10,000 units, for example, would then 
correspond to 10 seconds. As mentioned, however, the dwell time of 1 ms is the 
average time since we are seeking the optimum combination of dwell times to 
maximize the detection performance. 
For DSSS we assume that the input SNR, SNRi, measured in bandwidth W, is 
very small compared to unity. That is, SNRi << 0 dB.  
For a given frequency step, suppose that the input SNR has a specified 
functional form (the form need not be the same for each step). The output SNR of 
the square-law detector followed by the integrator is given by

Performance 
 
Reference [27] provides an algorithm for optimally assigning the time to dwells 
that we won’t discuss here. We will, however, show some of the results obtained 
by simulating the algorithm. 
 
Figure 4.11 shows the probability of detection when the maximum total 
search time was 250,000 with the other parameters shown in the caption. For short 
T, the detection probability is quite low. The optimum dwell times, however, 
increase Pd much faster than when the dwell times were all set equal. For longer 
total times, say, beyond about 125,000, the detection performance is almost 
perfect. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
256
 
It is interesting to note that in this example, when T is small, the total time 
gets distributed to few dwells [27], but as it gets larger, the algorithm tends to 
distribute the time fairly evenly across the dwells. This performance can be seen as 
the two curves in Figure 4.11 coalesce at about 100,000 steps. 
 
 
4.4 DSSS Signal Detection 
 
We will discuss several techniques for detecting DSSS signals in this section   
[28–30]. To detect DSSS signals, the signals typically must be extracted from 
below the noise floor, or at least from one another as in CDMA. Wideband 
receivers are typically used and suppression of narrowband interference sources is 
usually required. 
 
DS signals are normally detected with one of the energy detectors discussed in 
Section 4.2. Since DS signals do not change frequency, a starting receiver can look 
at the appropriate part of the spectrum for whatever length of time is required. For 
hybrid SS signals, where both FHSS and DSSS are used, this is not the case, 
however, and the receiver must be able to detect both modulation types. 
 
For tactical communications, one of the issues that must be addressed by an 
interceptor is interference. The VHF and UHF spectrums are very crowded and 
narrowband interference is very likely to be present. In most countries, for 
example, the frequency of the lowest TV channel is around 50 MHz, in the middle 
of the low VHF military band. One method to mitigate such interference is with 
notch filters [31]. 
 
4.4.1 Signal Specific Detection 
 
There are techniques for detection of DSSS signals that depend on the structure of 
the specific signals. Some of those techniques are presented in this section.

probability = 0.04, total search time = 250,000,  = 5 yielding Pfa = 10–5.

The effects of the digital modulation are removed and the square of the signal 
has a significant signal component at twice the carrier frequency. This 
characteristic can be used to detect whether a BPSK signal is present. Of course, 
the original carrier frequency must be known or estimated. Alternately, the 
squared spectrum can be examined for energy peaks. Where such peaks occur 
indicates a possible DSSS signal at half that frequency. 
 
4.4.1.2 2n
 
 PSK 
 
A similar characteristic is observed for higher forms of PSK. However, for DSSS 
it is frequently the case that the signal is below the noise level, and thus  < 1. In 
that case raising the exponent reduces the SNR more because

but since  = R / PN < 1, log() < 0. Thus, the larger the value of n, the smaller the 
SNR becomes. 
 
4.4.1.3 Cyclostationary Characteristics 
 
Many data modulations for DSSS have statistical characteristics that vary in a 
periodic sense. The mean, variance, and so forth for these processes repeat

themselves. This gives rise to the possibility of exploiting these characteristics to 
ascertain both the presence of the signal (detection) as well as determination of the 
type of signal (classification). An example of this is illustrated in Figure 4.12 [32]. 
The cyclic spectrum of QPSK is shown in Figure 4.12(a), while that for MSK is 
shown in Figure 4.12(b). Measuring these spectra in the parameter space shown 
would allow for successfully distinguishing between these two signals. 
This, then, is a type of detection of DSSS signals that relies on characteristics 
of the signals themselves. 
 
4.4.2 Nonsignal Specific Detection 
 
Specific characteristics of the modulations were exploited in the last section to 
facilitate DSSS signal detection. It is possible to filter the signal at the transmitter 
to minimize these features, however, and thereby making detection using these 
techniques less reliable. 
 
In addition to this shortcoming, such techniques are only useful when 
searching for specific signals—the so-called directed search. When general 
search for DSSS signals is required, when the types of signals in the spectrum are 
not necessarily known a priori, these approaches are inappropriate. General search 
is accomplished without reliance on signal structure. Two such approaches are 
presented in this section: the radiometer and a technique based on time series 
processing.

4.4.2.1 Radiometer Detection 
 
The radiometer discussed in Section 2.7 is perhaps the most common way to 
detect the presence of DSSS signals. The measurement of the energy in a pass- 
band, which may or may not contain a signal, is performed. The resulting energy 
level is compared with a threshold, and, if larger, signal detection is declared. 
Values below the threshold are interpreted as noise, and values above the threshold 
are interpreted as signal presence. The threshold level is therefore critical for 
proper performance of a radiometer for DSSS signal detection. However, as 
discussed in Section 2.7, long-term variation in the background noise dictates that 
the threshold be adjusted if that background changes. Since the characteristics of 
the signal are not specifically exploited, the radiometer can be used against a wide 
variety of signals to detect energy. 
The radiometer system is shown in Figure 4.10. The input bandpass filter 
selects the center frequency, f, and bandwidth, W, of interest. In general, these 
parameters are varied in a search for the correct W, and f, of the target signal. In 
practice, this signal is an IF signal where the bandwidth and frequency have 
already been accounted for in the filtering and mixing that precedes the 
radiometer. The squaring device follows the input filter to give a measure of 
received energy. Finally, the integrator integrates over the observation interval, T, 
for the energy measurement. 
The output of the integrator is compared to a threshold and if the output 
exceeds the threshold, detection is declared. A false alarm occurs when a threshold 
crossing occurs with no signal present. With a deterministic signal and AWGN, 
the output statistics are characterized by a chi-square distribution. However, for 
large WsT, the output statistics are approximately Gaussian. The Nieman Pearson 
test is parameterized by the probability of false alarm and the probability of correct 
detection.

This is the amount by which the power of jamming/interfering signals are reduced 
during the despreading process at the target receiver. 
 
Performance Model 
 
The performance model for the radiometer can be simplified by assuming that the 
radiometer output is Gaussian, which is the assumption often made. The 
approximation of the radiometer is based on the mean value

For low input SNR, the means and variances in (4.35) and (4.36) are close to the 
same for either hypothesis; signal present or noise only. The signal is detectable if, 
after sufficient integration time, the difference between s+n, and n is greater than 
the standard deviation s+n = n. Thus, the radiometer performance can be given

4.4.2.2 Delay and Multiply Receiver 
 
A code clock estimator is depicted in Figure 4.13. The technique used for the 
extraction of the chip rate is called ―delay and mix,‖ or ―delay and multiply,‖ with 
the resulting architecture referred to as the delay and multiply receiver (DMR). 
The idea is to delay the spreading sequence by a fraction of a chip duration (½ of a 
chip is illustrated in Figure 4.13) and multiply it by the undelayed sequence. This 
delay and multiply operation produces a spectral line at the bit rate that can be 
detected by a radiometer and/or tracked by a PLL. Once again, this detection 
method is effective on the binary DSSS systems because of the binary nature of 
their spreading sequences. However, since chaotic spreading sequences are not 

Antijam Signal Detection 
261
 
Figure 4.13 Delay and multiply receiver.  
binary, it can analytically be shown that the chaotic DSSS system is resistant to 
this method of detection as well.  
The delay and multiply detector, like most other suboptimal DSSS detectors, 
does not operate well when the SNR is negative [33]. When the noise power is 
greater than the signal power, producing a negative SNR, the operation of 
multiplication actually reduces the resulting SNR even further, as explained in 
Section 4.4.1.2. 
 
The output bandpass filter of the DMR selects the rate tone. If the actual rate 
tone is not known exactly, a search in the center frequency, fr = 1/Tc, must be 
performed, which makes the DMR more complex than the radiometer. The 
number of rate-tone frequencies that must be searched depends on the uncertainty 
of fr and the bandwidth of the output filter which is assumed to be 1/Ti, where Ti is 
the integration, or observation, time. 
 
The output of the multiplier can be divided into four components: rate tone, 
self noise, signal-times-noise, and noise-times-noise. For the case of very weak 
signals, as DSSS signals generally are, all but the first and last terms may be 
ignored. This leads to an expression for the SNR at the output of the DMR to be

DMR. 
 
4.4.2.3 Comparison of the DMR and Radiometer Intercept Receiver in 
Nonstationary Environments 
 
The radiometer is a standard for detection of unknown signals in noise [35], and is 
optimal when the noise is AWGN. In ideal cases, it can detect arbitrarily weak 
signals by integrating received energy for a sufficiently long time. Detectors that 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
262
take advantage of the cyclostationarity of digitally modulated signals can have 
superior performance in a nonstationary noise environment [36]. This 
phenomenon is discussed here with simple models used to show the relationships 
between spread spectrum processing gain (PG), detection performance, and noise 
fluctuation.  
The source of noise fluctuation may be temperature drift in the receiver 
(warmer receiver front-ends will be noisier), changes in external noise due to 
antenna pointing or otherwise changing in the physical environment, or fluctuation 
of interfering signals. This fluctuation in received energy, not caused by the signal 
of interest, can cause false detections or make it difficult to set the detection 
threshold. 
The quadratic detector considered here is the DMR discussed in Section 
4.4.2.2. This circuit, used as a detector, can be used to overcome the problem with 
nonstationary noise. This is done with added complexity at the intercept receiver. 
The DMR may be countered with proper signal design [37]. This is also 
considered in the comparison of the radiometer and DMR. 
 
Stationary Noise 
 
We now compare the performances of the radiometer and DMR for the case of 
stationary noise which is the ideal case. The performances are investigated and the 
effects of detector parameters are considered. Simple models are used to find the 
operating threshold of each detector.  
 
Radiometer 
 
The radiometer performance is very similar to that of the DMR. For very low input 
j, the output SNR is given by (4.38) with appropriate modification of Ps, and Pnn. 
Thus, the radiometer SNR, is also proportional to

E
N
 The performance 
depends on the prefilter bandwidth, W, as does that of the DMR. One of the 
advantages of the radiometer is that there is no delay to set, so its performance is 
simpler to quantify.  
The sensitivity of performance to bandwidth is important because it determines 
how the detection threshold affects the searches in center frequency and chip rate. 
In Figure 4.14 we plot the product o  Wn versus WTc, assuming a fixed target 
signal chip rate. Here Wn = Tc/Ti is the normalized bandwidth of the integrator. 
Notice that WTc can range from 0.25 to 2.0 with only a 3 dB loss in normalized 
SNR. The optimum WTc is approximately 0.5 where the bandpass radiometer 
bandwidth is matched to the chip rate. The optimum o  Wn is –23 dB for        
Ec/N0 = –10 dB. For other signal levels, assuming they are less than 0 dB, we can 
approximate o by

As predicted in [37] with o = 10 dB and Pfa = 10–3, the probability of 
detection is Pd = 0.8. Using this detection criteria the input CNR threshold can be 
found. First Ec/N0 is solved for in (4.39) letting o = 10 dB. Because of the 
bandwidth factor of 2 between Rc and the null-to-null BPSK bandwidth, the CNR 
is 3 dB less than Ec/N0. Finally, letting W = 1/Tj, we have Wn = l/(RcTj). The 
resulting threshold for radiometer detection is

Thus, given the chip rate and the integration time, (4.40) is the lowest CNR 
for which the detection criteria can be met. 
 
DMR 
 
The DMR multiplies the signal by a delayed version of itself, which produces the 
rate line and provides the chip rate of the target signal. When the exact signal 
bandwidth and Rc are not known, a variable bandwidth and center frequency can 
be incorporated in the DMR. However, the delay also affects performance and it 
must be chosen to give a good performance over a range of uncertainty in Rc. 
 
The DMR performance is given by the equations in [39]. These are used to 
plot o versus WTc in Figure 4.15 where graphs are provided for TdW = 0.3, 0.5, 
0.7, and 0.9. The delay is set relative to the prefilter bandwidth W. We note that if

Figure 4.15 DMR performance versus normalized bandwidth. (Source: [38]. © 1989 IEEE. Reprinted

Td is chosen too small, the DMR has a much higher sensitivity to bandwidth than 
the radiometer. The curve for TdW = 0.5 shows the least bandwidth sensitivity 
without a ripple. The curve for TdW = 0.9 shows a better performance at large 
bandwidths, but has a ripple of variation in o. In this curve, we see the effects of 
the bandwidth and delay. The bandwidth causes the first peak in o and the delay 
causes the second. 
 
Once the delay is set, we see that the DMR bandwidth can vary from WTc 
equal to 0.6 to 2.25. Thus, the DMR is more sensitive to bandwidth mismatch than 
is the radiometer. The optimum bandwidth gives oW = –31 dB. This is 8 dB 
worse than the radiometer, but because of the square relationship between input 
and output SNR, this means a 4 dB difference in CNR threshold. 
 
The detection performance can again be extrapolated giving the approximate

With the CNR thresholds from (4.40) and (4.42), we have the relationships 
between spreading rate, integration time, and CNR. We see from (4.40) and (4.42) 

Antijam Signal Detection

that the CNRt decrease as the square root of the chip rate. Also, the detectability 
threshold can be lowered by increasing the integration time. The threshold 
decreases as the square root of the integration time. 
 
The target signal can lower the CNR by increasing Gp. This is done by 
keeping the data rate, Rd, constant and increasing the chip rate, Rc, according to 
(4.34). Assuming that the target system needs CNR = 9 dB after despreading, the 
CNR in the spread bandwidth is given by

So, for a fixed data rate, the target signal can reduce CNR proportionally to the 
increase in Rc. Thus, the target signal has this advantage over both the radiometer 
and DMR. 
 
The detectability threshold for a radiometer and achievable CNR to spread 
bandwidth are shown in Figure 4.16 where two example data rates are shown: 300 
bps and 16 kbps. Detection threshold curves are shown for the radiometer and the 
DMR with 1 second integration time. Notice that any pair of target CNRcom line 
and CNRt line have an intersection point. To the left of this point are the spread 
bandwidths for which the target signal can be detected. To the right of the 
intersection point are the spreading bandwidths for which the target signal cannot 
be detected with sufficient quality at the given integration time. 
 
We see that for a 300 bps data rate and the maximum spreading bandwidth, 
the radiometer cannot detect the target signal with a 1 second integration time. 
However, for a 16 kbps data rate, the target signal can be detected using its 
maximum spreading rate with the DMR. 
 
Nonstationary Noise Environment 
 
In the previous section there were no interference fluctuations. If interference 
fluctuations are present during detection, the performance of the detectors 
deteriorates. This section considers the effects of interference fluctuations on 
detection performance.  
 
First, consider the effects of interference fluctuations on radiometer 
performance. The radiometer detects the presence of a signal by the change in 
received background energy. Without signal interference this background energy 
is due to the various noise sources. This level changes very slowly and is 
considered to be constant. When a signal other than noise is received, the received 
energy level is changed and the increase is detected. With interference fluctuations 
present, the background energy will change with these fluctuations. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
266
 
The background energy received by a radiometer may vary unpredictably in 
real signal environments. This variation can be modeled as an additive r.v. on the 
mean output of the radiometer. Thus,

where  is a zero mean r.v. with standard deviation . With this model for the 
interference fluctuations we can derive a new approximation for the radiometer’s 
output SNR. The interference variation adds to the output variance, o, in (4.37).

This is an approximation for the case of low input SNR and no bandwidth

Of course, the detection threshold with interference fluctuations is the same as 
before when


on the other 
hand, there is a lower bound on the detection threshold. That is, after a point we 
cannot increase the detection probability by increasing the integration time. Thus, 
the interference fluctuations can limit the performance of the radiometer. 
 
Next we consider the effect of interference fluctuations on DMR performance. 
The interference fluctuations do not affect the strength of the rate line amplitude 
with the DMR. The interference fluctuations may increase or vary the background 
noise level, but increasing the integration time in the DMR overcomes this 
problem. Thus, the detection threshold is not changed significantly by interference 
fluctuations. 
There is another consideration, however, with the use of the DMR when 
interference fluctuations are present. By design, the DMR produces tones, or rate 
lines, from received signals and the interference fluctuations may include some 
digitally modulated carriers. In that case, the DMR output will have rate lines at 
the symbol rate of the interference signals as well. Also, if unmodulated carriers 
are present in the interference, there will be tones at the beat frequencies (i.e., 
difference frequencies). These added rate lines and beat tones can easily be 
confused with the actual rate line of the signal of interest. 
 
In the worst case, the interference could add a spectral line at the DMR output 
that would cover up the target signal’s rate line. However, with a 1 second 
integration time, the interfering tone would have to be within 1 or 2 Hz of the 
target signal chip rate. Since this is unlikely, the interference fluctuations are 
assumed to have no effect on the DMR detection threshold. In addition, if the 
interference rate line is equal to that of the SOI, then the chip rate will be properly 
determined even though it may not belong to the SOI. 
 
If filtering is used by the communicator in order to defeat the DMR, the 
performance of the DMR may be severely degraded. For example, filtering may 
reduce the rate tone SNR by 20 dB. In this case, the detection threshold will be 
raised by 10 dB.  
 
Finally, we consider the detection thresholds of the radiometer and the DMR 
with interference fluctuations. These are depicted in Figure 4.17 where CNRt is 
plotted versus spread bandwidth for the radiometer and the DMR. Both use a 1 
second integration time. The radiometer threshold is plotted for three values of 
interference fluctuation: e = 0.01, 0.1, and 1%. Notice that the DMR performs 
better than the radiometer for any amount of interference fluctuation if the input 
bandwidth is large enough. Even with only 1% variation in the background power 
level, the DMR performs better than the radiometer for the spread bandwidths of 
200 kHz or greater. However, for the case of signal pulse filtering, labeled 
DMR/LPI, the radiometer has better performance for spread bandwidths up to     
10 MHz. 
We compared the performances of the radiometer and DMR intercept 
receivers in this section. The DMR can give superior performance in an

environment with nonstationary interference. This is achieved at the cost of higher 
complexity at the detector (adding a delay module). Some of this performance gain 
can be nullified if the target uses filtering to defeat the DMR. Which detector is 
most appropriate depends on the target signal and the cost complexity trade space. 
 
4.4.2.4 Autoregressive-Based DSSS Detection 
 
As above, the estimation problem associated with detection of DSSS signals is to 
determine whether a noise signal r(t) = n(t) or a signal plus noise signal, r(t) = s(t) 
+ n(t) is present [40]. Denote the noise process by

the innovation of the random process. That is, sample yn can be determined from 
the previous p samples plus a sample from the Gaussian innovations process. 
Gaussian noise alone is represented by an AR(0) model, where the p AR

Any discrete time sequence can be perfectly represented by an AR(p) process 
for some p, which may be infinite. For time sequences that require a large value of 
p, often a smaller number of values are included and the subsequent modeling 
error is accepted. Therefore, sampled DSSS signals can be represented by an AR 
process. The coefficients ai and the samples ei are unknown, and the 
autoregressive method of DSSS signal detection relies on determining whether the 
AR(p) model is present or the AR(0) model is present. Therefore, the null

One advantage of this approach over the radiometer is its relative insensitivity 
to long-term variations in the background noise (stationarity). This insensitivity is 
illustrated in Figure 4.19, which illustrates Pfa as the noise variance estimate error 
increases away from nominal (at zero variance). The probability of detection as the 
error in this estimate changes is illustrated in Figure 4.20. For the radiometer, 
whereas the probability of detection increases as the error increases, the 
probability of false alarm does as well. This feature is not present in the AR-based 
detection process. 
 
4.4.2.5 Fluctuations of the Autocorrelation 
 
Burel, Quinquis, and Azou [43] presented a method of not only detecting the 
presence of a DSSS signal, but, determining the symbol period also based on the 
eigendecomposition of the autocorrelation matrix of the received signal. We 
present a summary of their approach in this section. 
 
It is assumed that the DSSS signal uses short codes so that a full period of the 
spreading sequence occurs in each symbol. It is based on the behavior of DSSS 
statistical properties versus those of random thermal noise.

where h(t) is the convolution of the pseudo-random sequence with the transmitter 
filter (and with the channel echoes if there are any). We make the following 
assumptions: 
 
 
The symbols are centered and uncorrelated. 
 
The noise at the input of the receive filter, nc(t), is white, Gaussian, 
centered, and uncorrelated with the signal. Its PSD is N0/2.

The signal is hidden in the noise. [The signal-to-noise ratio (in decibels)

Signal Detection 
 
First, a technique is presented for detection of the presence of a DSSS signal that 
is below the noise based on computation of the first- and second-order statistics of 
the autocorrelation estimate. The received signal is divided into M nonoverlapping 
windows of duration T, which contains a few symbols or more. Within each of 
these windows the autocorrelation estimate is found as

for multiples of the symbol period. 
 
High values of () are obtained for every  multiple of the symbol period Ts.

Figure 4.21 shows an example of the detector output. The horizontal axis 
represents  (in s) while the curve represents () (i.e., the estimated fluctuations 
of the autocorrelation estimator). The horizontal lines represent the theoretical 
mean fluctuation and the approximate upper bound. We can see the peaks 
extending above the upper bound. Furthermore, we can see that these peaks are 
located at multiples of a given period. This means that a DSSS signal is hidden in 
the noise, which is the case. The parameters of this signal are: input  = –10 dB,  
M = 31, and N = 255.  
 
Summary 
 
DSSS signals are, by design, difficult to detect. Indeed, they are often transmitted 
below the noise level. Furthermore, a DSSS signal is especially built to be similar 
to a noise, in order to have a low probability of detection and interception. The 
autocorrelation of a spread spectrum signal is close to a Dirac delta function, as 
well as the autocorrelation of white noise (this is due to the pseudo-random 
sequence). The detector described here is based on the fluctuations of 
autocorrelation estimators, rather than on the autocorrelation itself. Although the 
autocorrelation of a DSSS signal is similar to the autocorrelation of noise, we have 
shown that the fluctuations of the second order estimators when a signal is buried 
in the noise versus just noise alone are different. The proposed method is able to 
estimate the symbol period of the DSSS signal. It should be noted, however, that it 
was assumed that the spreading code is short so that at least one complete cycle 
through the code is contained within every symbol. 
 
 
4.5 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum Signal 
Detection 
 
4.5.1 Introduction 
 
The FBC and PB FBC discussed in Section 4.3 are the most common methods to 
detect the presence of an FHSS signal. As mentioned, however, simply detecting

1994. Reprinted with permission.) 
the presence is rarely sufficient in crowded spectrums. Since the purpose of 
detection is to indicate to a jammer whether a signal is present, it is almost always 
necessary to measure parameters based on the energy in the channel to perform 
hop association. 
Measuring appropriate parameters depends on somehow determining the 
frequency to which the transmitter has hopped. The entire frequency band over 
which the targets hop can be simultaneously monitored with one of the receiver 
types discussed in Section 4.3. Once new energy is detected at some frequency, 
then measurements must be made to determine if that is the target of interest 
because, typically, several new energy alarms will occur if there are very many 
targets present, and they are frequently changing frequency. Thus, signal sorting 
becomes important. 
 
Optimum receiver structures have been determined for the interception of 
FHSS signals. The specific architectures for these receivers depend on the type of 
signal and detection goal. The optimum receiver architecture for SFHSS targets 
(multiple bits per hop) is illustrated in Figure 4.22 while that for FFHSS signals 
(multiple hops per bit) is shown in Figure 4.23 [45]. After appropriate filtering and

frequency downconversion, an FBC is used to ascertain whether the signal is 
present or not. 
For SFHSS signals, optimum detection requires searching over all the 
possible data patterns, since many data bits are contained within each dwell. On 
the other hand, for FFHSS, there are many dwells per data bit and it is only 
necessary to search over the possible dwell frequencies. Neither of these 
architectures is practically realizable in general. They do, however, form the 
limiting cases of what performance is possible. These architectures assume that the 
timing epoch information is available at the receiver and the receiver integration 
times are aligned to it. 
 
4.5.2 Searching for FHSS Targets 
 
Described in this section is a technique for searching for FHSS targets. In addition, 
a method for estimating the time to first intercept for each target is presented. We 
assume that the target emitters hop in a (pseudo) random fashion from one 
frequency in their hop set to the next. The search strategy employed by the 
receiver, on the other hand, is to step from one frequency channel to the next in a 
linear fashion—the receiver does not hop around looking for energy. 
 
4.5.2.1 Linear/Periodic Search Strategy 
 
It is necessary to repeatedly retune the center frequency of the receiver in order to 
maintain surveillance over the entire search bandwidth. The sequence and timing 
of changes to the center frequency constitute a search strategy. This is a sensor 
scheduling problem. Typically, the search bandwidth is divided equally by the 
bandwidth of the receiver and the strategy involves tuning the receiver into each of 
the smaller bands in some sequence. In each band, we say the receiver dwells for a 
certain period before retuning to a different band. 
An obvious and widely used strategy is the periodic strategy. Here, the 
receiver simply steps through each of the bands sequentially with equal dwell 
periods (although as discussed in Section 4.3.4.1, allocating time in equal dwells 
may not be the best strategy). Once the receiver steps to the last band in the 
sequence, it begins again from the first. We call the sweep period the time to 
complete a sequence.  
On the other hand, FHSS emitters typically employ a random (more 
accurately, a pseudo-random) hopping strategy. The set of frequencies used by an 
emitter constitutes its hop set and may consist of all the frequency channels in a 
band or some subset of them.  
The goal of the receiver is to try to detect radiation from the emitter in the 
shortest possible time. For detection to occur, the receiver must be dwelling in the 
―right‖ band (i.e., the one on which the emitter operates, at the right time). 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
282
The fundamental trade-off being examined in this technique is the scan rate of 
the EW receiver versus receiver bandwidth. For a constant signal level and 
bandwidth, the greater the extent of the receiver bandwidth beyond the bandwidth 
of the target signal, the lower the receive SNR since more noise is permitted into 
the receiver while more signal energy is not. Therefore, the wider the bandwidth 
the fewer the number of targets that can be detected. However more channels are 
covered in a given period of time, thus searching faster. On the other hand, the 
narrower the bandwidth, the slower the scan rate and therefore the fewer the 
number of channels covered during a given time period, taken as 1 ms and 10 ms 
for now. In this case, the SNRs are higher, however. 
 
4.5.2.2 Window Functions, Pulse Trains, and the Interception Process 
 
We model the process of detection or interception of an emitter by a receiver in 
terms of window functions or pulse trains [46]. A window function is binary, ―on‖ 
or ―off,‖ and is a function of time. Interception is said to occur when two 
independent window functions are simultaneously ―on.‖ One window function 
represents the times at which the receiver is dwelling on a channel in which the 
emitter operates. The other window function represents the times at which the 
emitter is in the channel of the receiver. The situation is depicted in Figure 4.24. 
Interception/detection is said to occur when these pulses coincide. The receivers 
synchronously and repetitively linearly scan a bandwidth W from a low-frequency 
channel centered on fL, to a maximum frequency channel centered on fM. If energy 
is detected in the currently selected bandwidth, W, a detection is declared. 
One additional assumption is worth mentioning. We assume that in the event 
of a coincidence of the two window functions, there is enough of an overlap that 
the energy received from the target at the receiver is sufficient to produce an 
adequate SNR to produce usable detection results.

Markov-Chain Model for FHSS Hopping Characterization 
 
The hopping characteristics of the emitters are modeled as a discrete-time Markov 
chain (DTMC), which is a statistical construct for modeling certain kinds of 
stochastic processes. One of the processes well modeled by a Markov chain is the 
hop sequence of a frequency hopping emitter as long as the hop pattern is assumed 
to be truly random. We will make that assumption here. Since the Markov chain is 
the mathematical construct that we will use, we will first review the characteristics 
of such chains that are pertinent to our discussions. For those readers who would 
like to delve further into Markov chains, [47] is recommended reading. 
 
Markov Chains 
 
A Markov chain is a stochastic process with state space , that is, it is a sequence 
{Xt} of random variables defined on some probability space and taking values in 
. The variable t represents time. For a DTMC, the time variable t takes on integer 
values, whereas in a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), it takes real values. 
We assume that the set  is finite (i.e., we consider only finite Markov chains). 
Without loss of generality, its elements are the numbers 1, ..., |S|.2 We briefly 
review the properties of discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains that are 
relevant here. 
Our approach in this section is to examine a linear receiver search strategy 
targeted against FHSS targets whose hop pattern is based on a DTMC. We seek to 
find the smallest maximum time (minimax) to first intercept of a target. 
 
Discrete-Time Markov Chains 
 
For a DTMC, the process obeys the discrete-time Markov property that

and all integer n. In other words, this means, given Xn, that the next 
state Xn+1 is conditionally independent of Xn−1 ,Xn−2,…. The next state does not 
depend on how we got to the current state. A DTMC is called time invariant if the 
right hand side (RHS) of (4.85) is independent of n. A (time-invariant) DTMC can 
be conveniently defined in terms of its transition matrix P with elements

Note that the column vector 1, all of whose elements are 1, is a right eigenvector of 
P corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.

The first-passage time between states i and j when i

is the amount of time, 
given that, at time t, the Markov chain is in state i, it takes until the chain enters 
state j for the first time. The mean first-passage time between i and j, when it

column. Computation of

then yields a vector

m of the mean first-passage times to state j from state i in an 
ascending order of index, excluding the mean first-passage time from state j. (The 
matrix I is the appropriately sized identity matrix.) 
 
The ES receiver is assumed to progress linearly from some initial frequency 
channel in succession up to some maximum frequency channel, and then is reset 
and starts over at the initial channel again. 
 
Time to First Intercept 
 
Our goal is to determine the maximum time to the first intercept of a frequency 
hopping target and to minimize it. The spectrum characteristics of a target then is 
modeled as a Markov chain. The intercept receiver is modeled as above—a 
sweeping receiver stepping from one frequency channel to the next in a linear 
fashion, dwelling on each channel sufficiently long to reliably measure the energy 
present on that channel. 
Suppose that an FHSS emitter with a random hop pattern begins operating in 
channel i. Without a loss of generality, suppose that it begins emitting its first 
(detectable) pulse at time 0. Let Ti(τ) be the time at which our linear-based search 
strategy first intercepts a pulse; the intercept time  is the total scan time of the 
receiver (from fL to fM). The intercept time is the first time after (or at) time 0 that 
the receiver visits band i when a pulse is emitted. The intercept time is an r.v. so 
we can define a mean or expected intercept time { ( )}.
iT 
 Moreover, the expected 
intercept time can be maximized over the pulse width of the emitter pulse train. 
We call this the maximum expected intercept time or MEIT, fi(τ). The intercept 

Antijam Signal Detection 
285
time is always maximized when the pulse width is 0. Let 
( )
f  denote the vector 
of these MEITs in each channel. 
The maximum expected intercept time is determined with the following 
property (suitably modified to reverse the characteristics of the target and 
receiver). 
Denote by Ri the event that the ES receiver is tuned to channel i and by Tj the 
event that the transmitter is emitting in channel j. Then coincidence occurs when 
the events Ri and Ti occur. Denote this event by RiTi. Note that we are not 
assuming here that the receiver and transmitter are synchronized (transmitter 
epoch timing is known at the receiver). As mentioned, we are assuming that when 
RiTi occurs there is enough time overlap that there is enough signal received by the 
receiver to produce sufficient energy for detection purposes. 
The simultaneous operation of the receiver and transmitter form a DTMC. 
The transition matrix for this DTMC can be written as follows. From this 
description of the DTMC we can say that if the current state of the DTMC is RiTj, 
then the next state can be any state from the set

where Nch is the number of channels that the transmitter has available to use. For 
the problem described here, the receiver has the same number of channels to scan. 
For example, for the low VHF range from 30–90 MHz, there are Nch = 2,400 
channels available. (For simplicity, we are assuming that the hop set for the 
transmitter consists of all these channels. Extension to when the hop set is a subset 
is straightforward.) 
 
The targets of interest here for the most part form PTT networks, and in such 
networks the emitters are typically off considerably more than they are on. This 
must be taken into account in the modeling. We will assume that the average duty 
cycle of the targets is the same and we will denote it by . Palpably, a target must 
be on in order to be detected. 
 
First, let’s examine what happens when Nch = 2. The transition matrix in this

The transition diagram corresponding to this transition matrix is shown in Figure 
4.25. As we see from either P or Figure 4.25, the Markov chain consists of two 
subchains that do not communicate with each other. Depending on the initial state, 
the chain remains in one or the other subchain. Figure 4.25(a) corresponds to when 
the receiver and target are ―synchronized.‖ There is never a detection no matter 
how long the Markov chain operates. Figure 4.25(b) corresponds to continuous 
detection. There is detection on every step, as long as the target is emitting. 
 
Now suppose Nch = 3. Taking the duty cycle into consideration, the transition

to change states to one that corresponds to a transmitter being off makes practical 
sense. 
This DTMC is periodic by definition (receiver repeats as does the emitter). The 
transition diagram is not shown here as it is too large. Therefore, this DTMC is an 
ergodic, cyclic DTMC [48] and several important results that apply to regular 
DTMCs [49] apply to this problem, in particular, the mean time to first passage 
and their variances [50]. This is the form of the transition matrix irrespective of the 
size of the problem.  
Since we are assuming the transmitter frequency pattern is determined by an 
m-sequence3, there are no repeated channels until they have all been visited by the 
transmitter.

targets (FHSS). As an example, suppose we search 30–90 MHz 
with a scanning receiver with an instantaneous bandwidth of W 
= 20 MHz, followed by a 800 bin FFT, yielding 25 kHz search 
channels. Thus Nch = 3. We assume that the average duty cycle

can see that the largest number of steps to first passage occurs 
for any initial state and state 4, that is (R2T2)on, with 1.7  104 
steps. If the targets are FHSS emitters with a nominal hop rate of 
100 hps (10 ms dwell), then the longest mean time until first 
detection is 170 seconds.

The standard deviation of the time to first passage (or first 
detection) corresponding to the largest mean time to first 
passage (R2T2) is

or 234 seconds; 
therefore, 99.7% of the targets are detected in 170 + 3234 = 
932 seconds. 
 
The mean times for subsequent detections are also available 
from these vectors. Considering state 0 (R1T1), the time between 
visits to the state is given by m00. In this case it is T0 = 452 steps 
or 4.5 seconds. The mean time to revisit state 4 (R2T2) is given 
by m44 or 17,000 steps corresponding to 170 seconds. Finally, 
the mean time to revisit state 8 (R3T3) is given by m88 or 452 
steps, corresponding to 4.5 seconds. So the model indicates that, 
on average, every target will be detected at least every 170 
seconds.


corresponds to the average time a network 
member other than the net control station (NCS) transmits in 
each frame in the simulation presented later in this chapter. As 
described there, the NCS actually transmits once for each of the 
other network members, of which there are four on each 
network. The duty cycle of the NCS is therefore 20/372. The 
maximum mean time to first detection for the NCSs is therefore 
1,122 steps, or 4.2 seconds, with a variance of 2.7104 steps2, or 
a standard deviation of 164 seconds. 
 
 
4.6 FHSS Signal Sorting 
 
In a follower jammer, it is necessary to determine the frequency to which the 
target has hopped since it is assumed herein that a priori information about this is 
unavailable to the jamming system. Thus, measurements of the spectrum are 
necessary and there are parameters determined that are used for such 
discrimination. These parameters are random variables and so the performance of 
the jamming system can only be described statistically. 
Typical parameters for tracking frequency-hopping targets are azimuth, hop 
phase, and amplitude. Azimuth is the angle of arrival of a signal at the jammer and 
will be a constant, subject, of course, to statistical variability and systematic errors, 
as long as the jammer and target are not moving. Even if they are moving, 
however, azimuth may still be usable since the azimuth will not vary much for 
subsequent hops for most situations. Hop phase is the expected time that the next 
hop will start based on the timing of the current hop. As long as the hop rate is a 
constant, then this can be predicted. One of the ECCM techniques for hopping 
systems, however, is to vary the hop timing, so this parameter is not always useful. 

Antijam Signal Detection 
291
Amplitude is the absolute amplitude of the signal at the jammer. Variations in 
propagation phenomena as well as antenna gain can make it difficult to use 
amplitude as a sort parameter, however. This is especially true for ground-based 
platforms. Airborne jammers experience less variation in propagation so they may 
be better able to take advantage of the amplitude as a sort parameter. 
Tracking frequency-hopping targets based on these parameters requires 
establishing gates which determine the limits within which the parameters must be 
within in order to declare a hop as belonging to a particular target or not. The gates 
have a specified minimum and maximum. The gate for azimuth, for example, 
might be 10o, depending on the accuracy of the instrument used to measure the 
azimuth. The gates are based on the initial detection of a potential target and the 
measurements made thereon. Normally the gates would be continuously updated 
as the collection process proceeds. 
 
4.6.1 Sort Parameters 
 
Details of the aforementioned frequency-hopping sort parameters are discussed in 
this section. 
 
4.6.1.1 Hop Phase 
 
Hop phase is defined as the time that a hop begins (or ends) relative to the time 
that a previous hop began (or ended). The resolution on measuring the hop phase 
is limited by, inter alia, the revisit time of a scanning receiver. For example, for the 
low VHF frequency range, 30 to 90 MHz is the spectrum of concern, and if the 
jammer receiver is using a 4 MHz instantaneous bandwidth, then Nc = 60 MHz/4 
MHz = 15, and is dwelling for 200 μs on each frequency, a revisit to any particular 
channel is given by 15  200 μs = 3 ms. This is the limit on the ability to measure 
hop phase. In this example then, for 100-hps targets, the resolution using only hop 
phase is given by 3 ms/10 ms or 0.33. Therefore, on average, only about three 
targets can be sorted based on hop phase alone. 
When a new net member starts communicating, it most likely has a new 
azimuth associated with it, whereas when tracking the same target, azimuth is an 
important track parameter, and this situation must be accommodated. Hop phase is 
critical in this situation. 
 
4.6.1.2 Azimuth 
 
The azimuth angle of arrival is the direction from which the target signal 
originates. Since the target of the jammer is the receiver to which the target 
transmitter is sending information, not the transmitter, the azimuth can still be 
used as a sort parameter. It cannot, in all cases, be used to point a directional 
jamming antenna, however. Such would be the case for small-scale operations. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
292
The smaller the azimuth gates are, the fewer measured azimuths occur within 
the gates, which results in fewer hops being detected. On the other hand, the wider 
the gates are, the higher the probability that more than one target will appear 
within the gates, leading to confusion over which hop belongs to the correct target. 
The better the instantaneous DF accuracy, the smaller the azimuth gate can be. 
Unfortunately, the limits on DF accuracy are often not imposed by the EW system 
itself, but are caused by external factors such as multipath reflections, cochannel 
interference, and high noise levels. 
If  represents the received SNR, Td is the sample time, and Bn is the noise 
bandwidth (25 kHz in the low VHF range), then the Cramer-Rao bound limits the 
ability to measure azimuths to 
 
 
d
n

T B


 (4.95) 
 
where σ is the standard deviation of the measurement. Thus, the larger any of these 
parameters is the better the azimuth can be measured. The Cramer-Rao bound is a 
theoretical bound assuming that the variations in the parameters are normally 
distributed. Being a lower bound on performance, the accuracy will be worse than 
that indicated by this bound. 
 
4.6.1.3 Amplitude 
 
Amplitude information is, in general, not very reliable when the entire low VHF 
spectrum is used for hopping. The received power levels of signals in free space 
are given by the equation (more on this in Chapter 5)

where PT is the transmitted power, GTR is the transmit antenna gain in the direction 
of the receiver, GRT is the receive antenna gain in the direction of the transmitter, 
DTR is distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and λ is the wavelength. 
Theoretically, then, the power levels will decrease by 6 dB for every octave 
increase in frequency. For the low VHF, the frequencies are varied between 30 and 
90 MHz, which represent 1.5 octaves. Therefore, signal levels should not vary by 
more than about 9 dB across the band in free space. Close to the ground 
propagation can best be described by setting the exponent in the denominator in 
this expression to four rather than two, which yields a 12 dB loss per octave 
distance. Again, over the low VHF range, the total variability of the amplitude 
would be about 18 dB for stationary targets. In fading channels, this variability 
will be larger. 

Antijam Signal Detection 
293
 The receive antenna gain influences the amount of received power. The 
antenna gain shown in Figure 4.26 is typical for a ground-based antenna in this 
frequency range, tuned to a half wavelength at 60 MHz. Considerable variation 
can be seen over the lower VHF range that complicates the utilization of signal 
amplitude for sorting. 
There are some special cases, however, when amplitude sorting can be used. In 
standoff situations, that is, the collection systems are some distance from the 
targets, amplitude can be used to eliminate friendly communications since they 
will typically be much stronger. Another case where amplitude can be used is 
when the collection systems are much closer to the targets than friendly 
communicators, which could be the case for UASs, for example. Again, however, 
amplitude could be used primarily to sort friendly from target communications 
since in this case, the target signals will be much stronger. 
 
4.6.1.4 Summary 
 
As an example of the above discussion, suppose there are two parameters: azimuth 
and hop phase with probabilities Pa and Ph, respectively. Further suppose, for 
discussion purposes, that these parameters have a uniform probability distribution, 
that is, any value within appropriate ranges is equally likely. In addition, suppose 
that gating is used. That is, a measured parameter is compared with hard limits 
within the tracker. If the sort azimuth gates are set at 10o and the time resolution is 
500 μs, then the probability of a target being within the azimuth gates is

 assuming omnidirectional antenna coverage in the 
horizontal plane. The probability of measuring two hops with the same hop phase 
is Ph = 0.5 ms/10 ms = 0.05 assuming 100 hops per second targets. The probability

of confusing hops is then P = PaPh = 0.055  0.05 = 0.00275. The theoretical 
upper bound on size of the target environment that can be dealt with without 
ambiguity is given by the reciprocal of P. In this example the bound is 364. 
 
4.6.2 Tracking Metrics 
 
There are two ways discussed here for measuring the closeness of a set of 
measured parameters to another set. The first is based on an approach that assumes 
that the error sources are Gaussian. The second is based on a weighted Euclidean 
distance measurement. 
If there are M sort parameters and they are independent random variables, then 
the probability of getting targets confused can be expressed as 
 
 
k
M
k=1
P = 
P

 
(4.97) 
 
where Pk is the probability associated with the occurrence of sort parameter k.  
Upon initial detection, the parameters are measured and assigned to trackers. 
Upon subsequent detections and assignment of hops, the parameters are compared 
to statistical values related to these parameters and, if sufficiently close, the hop is 
associated with the transmitting net being tracked.  
Suppose that the statistics associated with measuring the sort parameters are 
Gaussian. The mean and standard deviation values of differences in measured and 
expected parameters are calculated for the target. The joint probability density 
function of these parameters is given by

mj is the mean of xj and σj is the standard deviation. Of the signals detected at any

target being tracked, subject to being a certain minimum value.

since the first term in (4.100) is a constant that can be absorbed in β. The smaller 
the value of β, the better the fit to the statistics, that is, the larger 
( )
p x  will be. 
The minimum threshold value of 
( )
p x  is reflected in (4.101) by a threshold value 
of β, given by βth. If β  βth for one or more detected signals, then that signal with 
the smallest β is associated with the target. If β > βth for all detected targets, then 
no hop is associated with the target and that hop is not jammed. 
The second metric used for tracking a target from one hop to the next, as well 
as tracking nets when a new net member starts communicating, is a weighted 
Euclidean distance measurement of the measured parameters versus the tracker 
values. This can be expressed as

where the wk are the weights. 
The weights are selected so that selective importance is assigned to all the 
terms in (4.102). No hop is detected when D exceeds a predefined threshold. The 
distance measurement is calculated on a hop-to-hop basis. Once no hop is detected 
for the wait time (defined by hop dwells), then that target is declared ―down‖, and 
the operator is free to be assigned to a new target. The smaller this value is, the 
more the amount of time waiting for the next transmission on a net is reduced. 
This decreases the probability of being able to track communications on a 
particular net, but may increase the likelihood of being able to detect more targets, 
regardless of the net. 
The Euclidean distance method for tracking targets from one hop to the next is 
certainly heuristic as opposed to the Gaussian-based distance that is optimum, as 
long as the statistics involved are normal. 
The net effect of including the probability of detecting the correct hop is to 
decrease the probability of a bit error in the targeted communication system. The 
probability of being confused as to the identity of the correct hop, denoted here as 
Pconfused, is found as follows. Denote the total number of possible targets or 
transmitters by NT. The probability of exactly n events happening out of a possible 
NT is given by the binomial distribution

As an example suppose there are two parameter gates, azimuth and hop phase. 
Using the numbers above, suppose the azimuth gate is set at  10o and the hop 
phase gate is set at  0.25 ms. Then

for a 100-hps target system. This function is plotted in Figure 4.28. It only takes an 
environment of about 200 targets to cause confusion 1/10 of the time. Above about 
1,000 targets, confusion is almost always assured. 
 
The probability of bit error calculated earlier can now be modified to include 
the effects of tracking the frequency hopping targets. Frequency-hopping 
communication system jammers track a target until some time expires from when 
the last hop from the target transmitter was detected. Call the number of hops over 
this time NH. Let event A = this hop passes the tracking gate and it is the only one 
and event B = at least one hop passed the tracking gates on the last NH hops. If it 
is assumed that the trackers and their gates have already been assigned to a target, 
then the probability that this hop will pass the tracking gates and the jammer will 
not be confused (although it could still jam the wrong target by these criteria 
because a wrong target could be the one that passed the tracking criteria) is given 
by P{AB}. 
The conditional probability is necessary because, if the target has been 
detected and assigned to a tracker, then there is a very high probability that the 
target will again pass the tracking gates. The binomial distribution described above 
would yield the probability of passing the tracking gates if the events were 
independent. Now

Gone, the easier it is for the jammer to make a tracking error. Conversely, the 
longer the interval over which no hops make it through the tracking gates, the 
more likely a hop will occur within the tracking space.

4.7 Performance Simulation  
 
This section presents the results of a computer simulation of an ES system 
collecting FHSS AJ targets in support of the EA function, based on the discussions 
in Sections 4.1through 4.6. 
Realistic simulation of the operation of an ES system interacting with a target 
environment is a multidimensional problem; the number of parameters is very 
large. Nevertheless, the analysis was performed to ascertain the collection 
(detection, identification, and location) performance of such a system measured in 
terms of probabilities of collecting (detecting and identifying) and locating targets 
in these environments. Only a few of the various parameters were varied, made 
necessary by practical computation limitations. 
 
4.7.1 Simulation Description 
 
The computer models of the target environment and the collection systems were 
essentially autonomous. The only common factors were the total simulation time 
and the simulation time increment per pass. One hour of simulated time was used 
for all cases considered. This value was selected primarily to keep the computer 
time to within reasonable limits. The time increment per pass (epoch) was 0.01 
seconds for all cases. Ten values of seed random variables were used for each case 
and the results were averaged. 
The Longley-Rice propagation model [51] (see Chapter 5) was used to 
compute all signal levels in the simulation, to include the target signal levels at the 
target receiver as well as the jammer signal level at the receiver. Model parameters 
used were typical of a region consisting of rolling hills and not too good but not 
too bad ground conditions. All transmissions were assumed to be vertically 
polarized. 
 
4.7.1.1 Target Environment 
 
The target environment consisted of a variable number of communication 
networks, ranging from 12 to 96, where each net had five members. The first 12 
target nets are illustrated in Appendix B based on the nodes indicated in Figure 
4.31. The remainder of the target nets was randomly placed within the target area 
shown by first placing the net control station (NCS) for each. The remainder of a 
net was then deployed randomly within a 14 km radius of the respective NCS. 
The targets were all assumed to be hopping at a rate of 100 hps over the low 
VHF frequency range of 30–90 MHz. The effects of transmitter switching times 
were not considered. Each transmitter had an ERP of 50 watts and the transmit 
antenna heights were all 5 m. 
Over the 1 hour of simulated time, it was assumed that the targets were 
stationary. The transmissions on the nets consisted of the NCS transmitting to a 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
300
net member for 5 seconds and then that net member responded with a 5 second 
transmission. The NCS then transmitted to the next net member and that net 
member responded with a 5 second transmission. Between each of these 
transmissions, the radios were off for 2 seconds. This continued until the NCS had 
called all stations on its net and they had all responded. The network was then 
inactive for an average time of 300 seconds. All of these time variables were 
randomly varied with approximately normal distributions. 
 
4.7.1.2 ES Systems 
 
Two ES system configurations were examined: UAS mounted receiving systems 
and ground standoff platforms. For the UAS configuration, the collection receivers 
were mounted in two UASs and were deployed at an altitude of 1,000 m, 8 km 
across the forward line of own troops (FLOT). The systems were netted together 
for obtaining target fixes. Implicit in this scenario, then, was a data link to ground 
processors from the UASs. The UASs loitered in the same position for the 1 hour 
simulation time. Each ground station contained two operators for a total of four, 
two per UAS. 
In the ground standoff configuration, the receiving equipment was contained 
within the same shelter as the operators. The systems were deployed 5 km behind 
the FLOT and the receive antenna heights were 10 m. Three such systems were

included in the simulation, with two collection operators in each, for six operators. 
Other than this, the scenario was the same as the UAS configuration. 
The collection system operation was simulated as a scanning wideband 
receiver with direction finding (DF) capability. The instantaneous bandwidth of 
the receivers was a simulation variable and was set at 4 MHz, 12 MHz, and 24 
MHz. A filter bank channelized to 25 kHz followed this receiver. The process of 
target collection started with scanning the frequency spectrum looking for energy. 
If energy was detected at a channel, an attempt to compute the location of the 
emitter generating the energy was made. If a location was computed, then that 
target was assigned to an operator for copy. After this assignment, copy proceeded 
by that operator based on hop phase, instantaneous azimuth, and power level 
measurements as well as minimum signal level requirements. 
Each operator was assigned a geographic area defined as a rectangle. The 
rectangles were obtained by dividing the target area from top to bottom into equal 
areas. This area was then used to assign targets to operators: four areas for the 
UAS configuration and six areas for the ground standoff. These rectangular areas 
were derived by placing horizontal slices across the target area shown in Figure 
4.31, equally spaced top to bottom. 
As mentioned, targets were assigned to collection operators based on their 
geographic locations. If the conglomerate ensemble of collection systems could 
compute a target fix [a minimum of two lines of bearing (LOBs) were necessary], 
and the collection operator that was assigned to the area where the fix is in was not 
busy prosecuting another target, that operator was assigned to copy the new target. 
That operator continued to copy the target net until no hops matched the tracking 
criteria for a prescribed number of hops called herein the wait time. If a hop 
reappeared that did satisfy the tracking criteria, then this time clock was reset 
regardless of whether the hop was associated with the correct target. Once no 
target satisfied the tracking criteria for this number of hops, that operator was 
proclaimed not busy anymore and was available to be assigned to the next target 
that appeared within his/her assigned area.  
The scan rate of the receivers was varied between 20 GHz per second to 120 
GHz per second. Furthermore, the scanning receivers were time-synchronized 
between collection systems so that the same frequencies were scanned at the same 
time by all receivers. This scan rate is determined by the instantaneous bandwidth 
of the wideband receiver and the sample (receiver dwell) time. To put these 
numbers in perspective, suppose that the receiver had a 2.5 MHz instantaneous 
bandwidth (IBW) and dwelled at a tuned frequency for 100 μs. The search rate in 
this case was 25 GHz per second. The channel resolution in this case was       
1/100 μs = 10 kHz, but with a signal processing smearing factor (defined later) of 
2.5, the net resolution was approximately 25 kHz, the assumed width of a VHF 
channel. 
In such a system configuration, when the scanning receiver detected energy at 
a channel and subsequent measurements allowed that channel to be declared

associated with the last hop, a separate, narrowband but fast tuning receiver would 
be tuned quickly to that frequency. There would be one such hand-off receiver for 
each operator. 
The receiver was tuned to a frequency and the energy within that channel  (25 
kHz wide) was measured. A target location was automatically obtained on each 
cell that contained sufficient energy, as long as adequate data link capacity was 
present. 
 
Intersystem Data Link 
 
The rate of the data link that interconnects the systems limited the number of 
LOBs that could be transferred among systems. Since all the systems were time 
synchronized and covered the same instantaneous frequency band at the same 
time, a target detected at one system at a frequency would also be detected at the 
same time at all collection systems, subject to signal level constraints. That is, the 
signals must have been at an adequate level as well as have an adequate SNR to be 
detected. If too many signals were detected at a time for the data link to transfer 
the LOBs to the other stations, the remaining signals were considered not detected 
for the purpose of computing locations. The data link data rate used for all the 
results herein was 200 kbps at a frequency of 1.7 GHz. The SNR characteristics of 
the data link at this frequency were included. 
In the event of copying a target, as opposed to searching for targets, the hop 
phase and instantaneous LOB at the copying site were used along with the signal 
amplitude so the data link is not a constraint in this case. 
 
Signal Detection 
 
Typically, for single hop detection, a 15–20 dB SNR is necessary to detect BFSK 
signals when Pfa  10–3 and Pd  0.99. Pfa refers to the probability of declaring a 
hop present when none was and Pd refers to the probability of declaring a hop 
present correctly. These results assume that an FFT channelized receiver 
architecture is implemented and is based on a statistical estimation likelihood 
theory leading to optimum results (as long as the noise present is Gaussian.) For 
these results to apply, however, the targets must be fast frequency hopping. For the 
SFHSS cases herein, although not necessarily optimum, the detection results are 
applicable. A Pfa of 10–3 produces about one error every 10 seconds per channel. A 
Pd of 0.99 ensures that 99% of the time a hop is detected in the channel when one 
is there. Typically, data rates around 16 kbps are used, leading to approximately 
160 data bits or BFSK tones in a 10 ms hop. They are not optimum in the sense 
that not all of the information in the signal is exploited—in particular, the data 
sequence.  
This leads to the second assumption about the thresholds: that the FFT sample 
windows coincide precisely with the period of the sine wave input signal. When 

Antijam Signal Detection 
303
misalignment of the window occurs, spectral splattering results, pushing signal 
energy into adjacent FFT bins [52]. For this analysis, it was assumed that the 
alignment of FFT points and target tones occurred and they were correctly 
combined so that FFT points were an accurate representation of the energy in the 
signal. 
The third assumption is that the hop epoch information was completely known. 
That is, it was assumed that the target hop time was known to the receiver. If this 
information is not known, then the statistical derivation leading to the exact 
optimal results is an approximation and some method of establishing (measuring) 
the timing information is required. Establishing the optimum thresholds then 
becomes a matter of simulation because some of the statistics involved are 
correlated [52].  
The fourth simplifying assumption, made for simulation feasibility, is that the 
hopping targets all changed channels at the same time. This occurred once per pass 
through the simulation at a rate of 100 hps. 
The signal must have been detected within the first 30% of the hop. If it was, 
the hop was detected. One event that could have led to failure to collect 70% of a 
hop was due to the scanning receiver. If the instantaneous frequency of an 
operator’s target was not covered by the receiver until 30% or more of the hop was 
transmitted, then the hop was not detected. This could have happened at all scan 
rates less than 20 GHz/sec. Because achieving a scan rate of 20 GHz/sec is not a 
major challenge with modern technology, all the scan rates considered herein were 
at or above this rate. Therefore, this is not a limitation. Another reason why an 
individual hop may not have been detected is that the SNR was too low. The noise 
sources simulated consisted of RF background noise (galactic, atmospheric, and 
man-made) and system noise, as represented by the system noise figure. A high 
rural noise environment was assumed [51].  
Another case was when the signal level was too low. The receiver dynamic 
range was a simulation variable and close interferers combined with this dynamic 
range set the minimum signal levels that could be detected. Lastly, the copying 
operator’s measured LOB to the target may have been consistently too far away 
from what the tracker expected. How these parameters were factored into the 
detection performance is described later. 
A target transmitter is considered identified if the transmission was detected 
within the first 2 seconds. Seventy percent or more of the hops associated with a 
transmission must have been detected in order to proclaim the collection a success. 
When this occurred, the transmission was said to have been copied.  
 
Noise Figure 
 
The system noise figure was varied between 0 and 10 dB. Noise is added to a 
signal by the electronics of the system, primarily by the front end. The noise figure 
is a measure of this noise. For a well-designed system in this frequency range,     

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
304
10 dB is achievable but with difficulty. With cooled receiver front ends, noise 
figures lower than this are possible. It can be argued, however, that the external 
noise level is higher than this, however.  
  
Minimum Detectable Signal 
 
In dense target environments, almost every channel is occupied by a signal—either 
friendly or hostile (and often both). With stand-off platforms, friendly transmitters 
are closer and therefore higher levels of their signals are received while target 
signals are further away and weaker. In the case of UAS platforms, the targets are 
closer than friendly interferers so the dynamic range is not as much of a concern. 
We must design for the case where weak target signals are in channels adjacent to 
powerful signals and not masked by the sidelobe response of the receiver chain. 
The dynamic range and signal level of the closest interfering transmitter set the 
minimum detectable signal (MDS) level given by 
 
 
I,dBm

where PI is the signal level of the interfering signal at the collection site. The 
sidelobes generated by any signal processing system that samples the signal can 
mask signals of interest, which frequently are substantially weaker than interfering 
signals. The level of the highest of these sidelobes is given by the first sidelobe 
dynamic range, as given above. Therefore, for a signal to be detected, its power 
level must have been above the MDS. Three values of receiver dynamic range 
were used in the analysis: 50 dB, 72 dB, and 96 dB. These levels are achieved by 
weighting the sidelobe response at the expense of widening the width of the main 
lobe. This is called smearing. In all cases in this simulation, the closest interferer 
was located 0.5 km away from the collection system and its ERP was 30 watts. 
The MDS values corresponding to the above conditions are –110 dBm for a 96 dB 
dynamic range, –86 dBm for a 72 dB dynamic range, and –64 dBm for a 50 dB 
dynamic range. 
 
Rejection of Friendly Transmitters 
 
It was assumed that friendly transmissions could be automatically detected, sorted, 
and rejected as signals of interest. This is a somewhat optimistic assumption 
against modern frequency hopping targets. With the older version of some radios, 
there was a 150 Hz squelch tone that could be used for this purpose. This tone was 
transmitted to reduce the noise in the receiver as a signal is received intermittently. 
Many new radios also have this feature so its utility for sorting is limited. 
However, other parameters, such as unique hop dwell times, are sometimes used 
for this purpose.

4.7.2 Statistics Collected 
 
The statistical parameters consisted of the following: (1) probability of copying a 
target at least once (Pc), (2) probability of identifying a target at least once (Pit), 
(3) probability of copying an NCS at least once (Pcn), (4) probability of 
identification of an NCS at least once (Pin), (5) probability of locating an NCS at 
least once (Pln), and (6) probability of locating a target at least once (Plt). A target 
in these definitions refers to any transmitter, including the NCS. Copying and 
identification are as defined earlier. 
All of the results herein are based approximately on the equivalent of 10 dB 
amplitude gates resulting in an approximate resolution of 20 / 50 = 0.4. Table 4.1 
shows the upper bound on the size of the target environment based on the 
parameters used in this analysis with the assumptions mentioned. To ascertain the 
effects of the wait time before declaring the signal gone, three values were 
evaluated: 20 hops equating to 0.2 second; 200 hops equating to 2 seconds; and 
500 hops equating to 5 seconds. 
 
4.7.3 Results  
 
The simulation results are presented in two sections, with each section referring to 
the particular platform configuration. First, the results for the UAS configuration 
are presented, followed by those for the ground stand-off configuration. 
 
4.7.3.1 UAS  
 
All of the results for the UAS configuration used the weighted Euclidean metric 
for sorting and tracking. 
Shown in Figure 4.32 is Pc plotted versus the number of target nets when  
IBW = 4 MHz and the dynamic range is 72 dB. Pc decreases approximately 
linearly as the number of nets increased and waiting only 20 hops before moving 
on the next target is noticeably better than waiting 200 hops, while 200 hops is 
better than 500 hops. The trade-off on the number of hops to wait is whether the 
goal is to copy a net or, as this statistic measures, to copy as many individual

transmissions as possible, although it is not obvious a priori which approach yields 
better performance. Pc is based on the latter, whereas the former likely produces 
more information. If the goal is to copy as many transmissions as possible, then 
setting the number of hops to wait as short as possible is reasonable. Figure 4.33 
shows Pit as a function of the number of nets. Again, the linear decrease is present. 
 
Waiting only 20 hops before moving on to the next target produced Pc above 
0.8 for up to 90 nets, while Pit remained above 0.7 for these same conditions. 
These are relatively high probabilities and indicate that signal levels are probably 
not the limiting parameters. Timing of intercept operations caused some targets to

be missed, although identifying 70% of the targets indicates that not many were. 
Shown in Figure 4.34 is Pcn, the probability of copying an NCS at least once 
while Figure 4.35 shows Pin, the companion statistic that illustrates the ability to 
identify an NCS. These probabilities remained reasonably high as the number of 
nets increased with no substantial decrease until the number of nets exceeded 44. 
In fact, for a wait time of 20 hops, Pcn and Pin remained relatively flat regardless of 
the number of nets. 
Even when the wait time was allowed to extend to 200 and 500 hops, these 
statistics remained relatively high. The NCS transmitted the most compared to 
other members on the nets, which mostly accounts for this. The wait time is the

metric.

UAS, and weighted Euclidean metric.

delay before declaring a target as gone. Since the NCS transmitted after each of 
the other nodes, the longer the wait time, the higher the probability of capturing 
the NCS. The tradeoff is waiting for the next node to transmit versus covering all 
the necessary frequencies. 
Plt and Pln equaled unity for the above cases, indicating that a system with the 
performance described has no problem locating targets. Recall that the target 
location process was independent of what the system operators were doing; 
therefore, there is no variation with the wait time. The only limits on target 
location performance, as represented by these probabilities, were the data link 
capacity and target detectability (a target must be detected before it can be 
located). This is not to say, however, that the DF performance is not reflected in 
the other results. Target locations, to include the effects of DF accuracy, are 
critical elements of the copy performance due to the method of tasking operators 
with detected targets and the subsequent target tracking. 
Varying the dynamic range, IBW, azimuth gates, noise figure, and detection 
threshold had little effect for the UAS configuration. For the cases considered 
here, achieving a 15 dB SNR at UAS collection systems was never a problem 
since the UASs flew very close to the targets. In fact, the SNRs were always 20 dB 
or better, considerably exceeding the required 15 dB. The target signal levels were 
sufficient so that the MDS levels were always met or exceeded. This is illustrated 
in Figure 4.36 where Pc is shown for when the dynamic range was reduced to 50 
dB. There are no significant differences from when the dynamic range was 72 dB. 
Changing the azimuth gates had no effect because of the statistics captured. 
Concentrating on collection of a single target instead of a target net negates some 
of the requirement for more accurate azimuth measurements. 
Comparing Figure 4.37 for 12 MHz and Figure 4.38 for 24 MHz with Figure 
4.36 shows that widening the IBW and thereby increasing the scan rate had no 
effect on the results. This indicates that widening the IBW beyond 4 MHz had no 
impact on the ability to capture transmissions in adequate time for target 
identification. It further indicates that the limit on hop phase resolution imposed by 
the IBW (about 3 ms) was adequate. The ability to copy targets was, however, 
subject to the assumptions given earlier (such as 70% of a hop). If these 
assumptions are violated, then a wider bandwidth may very well be necessary. 
In summary, for cross-FLOT UAS collection platforms a dynamic range of 50  
dB was adequate as was a 4 MHz IBW scanning receiver. Adequate SNRs and 
signal levels were available to provide reliable detection, collection and 
identification performance. 
 
4.7.3.2 Ground Stand-Off 
 
Both the Gaussian and the weighted Euclidean tracking metrics were examined for 
the ground stand-off configuration. Ground stand-off platforms suffer primarily

from the signal propagation characteristics discussed in the next chapter. The 
signal loss is much greater when the collection site is close to the ground. There 
are two fundamental limitations: noise induced onto the signal by external and 
internal means and the desensitizing effects of close (friendly) interfering 
transmitters. The effects of these limitations are shown in this section. 
 
Euclidean Metric 
 
The probability of copy of a target at least once, when the system noise figure is 
10 dB, the SNR threshold was 15 dB, representing a type of radiometer detector, 
and the dynamic range was 72 dB, is shown in Figure 4.39. The 50 dB dynamic 
range performance (not shown) produced very poor results because of the signal 
propagation effects discussed previously. The signal levels of close transmitters 
produced too much interference and distant targets could not be detected. The 72 
dB dynamic range did not improve this much. Detection and collection 
probabilities were less than about 0.2, irrespective of the number of nets. Since the 
target networks were placed uniformly throughout the target area, as more were 
added, a smaller percentage of them fell within the detection range of the ground, 
standoff collection systems. The probability of identification of a target is shown 
in Figure 4.40, which is essentially identical to Figure 4.39, indicating that for 
when the number of target nets was greater than 25, Pit < 0.2. Therefore, if a 
transmission was copied, it was identified, at least once, although the fraction of 
targets for which this happened was relatively low. 
The probability of copy of an NCS is shown in Figure 4.41, with similar 
results. Few of the control nodes were copied. Likewise, the probability of

identification of an NCS is shown in Figure 4.42 with the same results. If an NCS 
was copied, it was identified. The low results are due to the relatively few control 
nodes within range of the ground stand-off collection systems. 
The probability of locating a target is shown in Figure 4.43, again indicating 
the relatively low fraction of targets located. Somewhat more overall targets were 
located than NCS nodes, however, the latter of which is shown in Figure 4.44.  
Less than 0.2 of the number of control nodes were located for any number of 
networks. 
Typical SNR densities for 12 and 96 target nets are shown in Figure 4.45 and

the corresponding distribution functions are shown in Figure 4.46. Recall that the 
SNRs calculated here incorporate the system noise figure. That is, it is the SNR 
expected at the input to the detector. For 12 nets, about 65% of the received SNRs 
were below the necessary 15 dB, while for 96 nets, about 75% were smaller. 
Reducing the noise figure by 10 dB (to 5 dB) increased the SNR by the same 
amount in these figures, which would effectively move the abscissa the same 
amount to the right, yielding about 35% for 12 nets and 55% for 96 nets with 
SNRs below the detection threshold. Therefore, one would expect a substantial 
improvement, other factors being the same, if the noise figure could be reduced. It 
will be shown below that this is precisely what happened. It is also clear from 
these figures that for the standoff case with limited dynamic range and sensitivity,

the wait time did not matter. This is because the collection systems only saw a 
limited set of targets; those they could hear, they collected. 
Although the fraction of targets collected and located was low in all cases for 
ground stand-off collection systems, as more target nets were included, in general 
the ES results decreased. This was caused by two factors. The first were the timing 
impacts even though the number of target networks within range was limited. The 
operators were busier handling the additional targets and some were undetected. 
The second was, as more targets were added, they were added uniformly in the 
target array. Since the ground assets could only see a limited amount of this target 
area, the majority of the new target nets added was not within their field of view. 
These factors were true both for collection as well as target location. 
 
Gaussian Metric 
 
All of the above results are based on the heuristic Euclidean distance metric 
discussed earlier. The effects of employing the Gaussian based metric did not 
change performance from the Euclidean case. Either distance metric may be used. 
Target location performance obviously is not affected. These results do indicate, 
however, that these two tracking metrics can be used to track frequency hopping 
targets. 
The dynamic range is not the only limiting factor, as increasing it by 24 dB did 
not change the results. It can therefore be concluded that the noise, as represented 
by the noise figure and detection threshold, was also a prominent cause of lack of 
collection from ground stand-off platforms. Reducing the noise figure to 0 dB 
yields about two to four times improvement for all statistics over the 10 dB noise 
figure case. 
 Some limits are imposed by the dynamic range. Increasing the dynamic range 
to 96 dB from 72 dB at a 0 dB noise figure produced about a double increase in 
performance. Some performances, however, were worse using the larger dynamic 
range, in particular, for the longer wait times and larger target nets. This is because 
the collection systems were hearing substantially more targets. 
For the UAS case there was no variation in results when the azimuth gate 
parameter was varied. Although this parameter was not varied for the ground 
stand-off case, we would expect a greater effect since the LOB accuracy for each 
LOB obtained is inversely proportional to 
, and the SNRs were substantially 
less in many cases.  
For the ground stand-off case, then, in summary, the system noise figure and 
the dynamic range were critical factors affecting collection performance. With a 
72 dB dynamic range, a 10 dB noise figure, and a 15 dB SNR detection threshold, 
collection performance was fairly poor, typically below 20% to 30% of all targets. 
Increasing the dynamic range to 96 dB while decreasing the system noise figure to 
0 dB substantially improved performance.

4.8 Concluding Remarks 
 
The results presented in this chapter point out that a UAS is an excellent platform 
for collection of low VHF frequency-hopping communication signals. The system 
parameters necessary to be effective are quite modest. A ground stand-off platform 
on the other hand, has a very limited capability with technology that is available 
today. The performance can be substantially improved with some developments in 
the areas of noise reduction and detection algorithms. 
The statistics used for this evaluation were more appropriate for target 
identification and tracking than for information collection (e.g., situation 
assessment). For the latter function, more than two collection systems would be 
needed and different statistical criteria would be more appropriate. Nevertheless, 
the results presented do indicate that significant signal collection performance can 
be achieved.

Radio Signal Propagation 
 
 
5.1 Introduction 
 
Signals propagate from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna in all RF 
communication systems in the form of electromagnetic (EM) waves. How well 
they do this largely determines the signal strength at the receiver. The propagation 
effects are the same for the signal from the intended transmitter as well as for the 
jammer-to-receiver link, although the specifics may vary somewhat because the 
propagation paths are normally different. Any obstacles that are between the 
transmitter and the receiver would probably not be in the path from the jammer to 
the receiver. The fundamentals, however, are the same. 
 
The other factor that limits how well a signal is received is the noise in the 
channel as perceived by the receiver. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the 
receiver is the overarching determinant of how well a signal is received. Noise 
arises externally to the receiver and within the receiver. Both limit performance, 
and normally they are additive. Noise effects were discussed in Chapter 2. 
Modern communication systems can be found in most frequency bands. The 
ones considered here, however, will be limited to the HF (0.5–30 MHz), VHF (30–
300 MHz), and UHF (300–3,000 MHz) frequency bands. For HF, both sky-wave 
and ground-wave propagation systems can be used for communications. 
We cover radio signal propagation in general in this chapter. This material 
describes the basic propagation mechanisms found in most places (under water is 
an exception to this that is not covered). Because of its increased importance, we 
devote Chapter 16 specifically to signal propagation in urban terrain, and cover the 
frequency range associated with the most prolific modern signals in this setting. 
All of the important communication systems as of this writing, forming the 
targets for our EW systems, are implemented digitally so those are the only signals 
of interest. There are some exceptions to this, primarily in the urban environment, 
such as CB radios. We will not delve into the details of these radios, however.  

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

It is the BER that specifies how well a digital communication system works 
and is a function of the SNR at the receiver RF input. An EW system tries to 
decrease the SNR at the target receiver by raising the noise level. The usual 
jammer performance in such instances is specified by the jam-to-signal ratio (JSR) 
at the receiver input. We will discuss many facets of EW systems and how, and 
how well, the SNR can be decreased. 
We begin this chapter with a discussion of the fundamental characteristics of 
VHF and above signal propagation and, in particular, the effects of the Earth since 
we are most concerned with signals propagating close to the Earth. Following that, 
we enter into a discussion of HF signal propagation and present two ways to 
model nonionospheric signal propagation: a simple model and a complex model 
suitable for computer implementation. Lastly, HF sky-wave propagation is 
discussed. 
 
 
5.2 Propagation of Signals in the VHF Range and 
Above 
 
5.2.1 Introduction 
 
It can be argued that the low VHF frequency range is the most heavily used for 
communications by land-mobile military forces. That is certainly where the 
majority of the tactical CNRs have been built. It offers reasonable propagation 
ranges coupled with acceptable bandwidths, along with reasonable noise levels. 
Lower than this, in the HF range, the signals will normally propagate further for a 
given amount of effective radiated power (ERP), but the bandwidth is smaller. 
Higher than this, larger bandwidths are possible but the signals do not propagate as 
far, typically.  In this section, the discussion about signal propagation will begin 
with the VHF range and higher. HF signal propagation is presented after that     
[1–3]. 
 
5.2.2 Free-Space Propagation 
 
From basic physics, as a radio wave travels away from an isotropic antenna,1 its 
energy expands spherically. The power per unit area on the surface of the sphere 
thus decreases. The power field associated with the propagating wave is called its 
power density and is given in units of W m–2. The electric field associated with a 
propagating signal is denoted by E and is given in units of V m–1. If there are no 
obstructions to distort the wave, the power density decreases as the square of the 
                                                           
1 An isotropic antenna is an imaginary antenna where energy leaves equally in all directions. 

Radio Signal Propagation

distance it travels. This is the case when the radio wave is far from the surface of 
the Earth, such as in outer space.  
 
The equation that dictates the amount of power received by a receive antenna 
with gain2 GRT in the direction of the transmitter is known as the Friis equation and 
is given by

(5.1) 
 
In this equation, GTR is the transmitter antenna gain in the direction of the receiver, 
PT is the amount of power that is entering the transmit antenna, and  is the 
wavelength of the signal, given by  = c / f when f is the frequency (in hertz). The 
constant c is the speed of propagation, normally accepted as the speed of light for 
RF propagation in free space. DTR is the distance between the transmitter and 
receiver, in units consistent with . The product GTRPT is often referred to as the 
ERP. 
 
While communications close to the earth, described next, do not normally 
follow (5.1), at altitudes such as those typified by air-to-air communications, this 
expression does apply. Furthermore when the jamming target is close to the 
ground and the jammer is airborne, and vice versa, the jamming link may follow 
(5.1). Thus, the links between the transmitter and jammer and jammer and receiver 
may have entirely different characteristics. 
 
5.2.3 Propagation Close to the Earth 
 
Expression (5.1) dictates that the power received decreases as the square of the 
distance traveled. When close to the Earth or other large object, this dependence 
on the square of the distance is no longer valid. It actually normally falls faster 
than the square of the distance, and the rate depends on the propagation medium 
and the nature of any obstructions. A common approximation that is useful in 
many cases is a model that assumes the decrease in power density is proportional 
to 
TR
n
D, where the value of n varies with the particular situation. Outdoors, in 
reasonably flat Earth surface conditions, n = 4 is frequently used. Inside buildings 
and factories it can be more than or less than 4. In fact, n has been measured to 
vary over the range of 1.6 to over 5 [4]. 
                                                           
2 The gain of an antenna in a given direction is the degree to which the antenna prefers to emit (or 
receive) energy in that direction. It is usually specified relative to an isotropic antenna where it is 
denoted Gi. Thus, an antenna that emits twice the amount of energy in some direction has a gain of 2 in 
that direction. Since GdB = 10 log10 G, a factor of two is about 3 dB.

The discussions in this section apply to both the communication path as well 
as the transmitter-to-jammer path and the jammer to receiver path, as long as these 
links are all close to the Earth. 
When the transmit and receive antennas are high enough and/or the 
propagation path short enough, then the propagation mechanism consists of a 
direct wave component as well as a component that is reflected off the Earth at 
some point between the antennas. If the Earth is smooth at the point of reflection, 
then the reflected component will be specular with significant deterministic 
characteristics. If the Earth is very rough at the point of reflection, then the 
reflected component will be largely diffuse (also referred to as scattered) and 
spatially uniform with reflection angle. Figure 5.1 shows the parameters involved 
[5].

signal3. E0 is the free-space field strength when there are no ground effects. 
Parameter k is referred to as the reflection coefficient and, in general, is a 
complex number. The first term in brackets represents the direct wave; the second 
term is the reflected component, while the third represents the surface wave. A 
represents the attenuation of the surface wave, which, as mentioned above, 
depends on the Earth’s surface conditions.  
At the point of reflection, the wave leaves with a different phase angle that 
depends on the polarization of the signal at this point, the angle of incidence, and 
the ground characteristics. For antennas close to the ground (relative to a 
wavelength), k approaches –1 and  approaches 0, causing the first two terms to 
cancel, leaving only the third, surface wave, term. For antennas that are elevated 
further relative to a wavelength, the surface wave component is negligible and 
only the direct wave and ground reflected wave need be considered. Thus, for 
VHF frequencies and above, where the antennas are typically elevated, the third 
term in (5.2) is small compared to the other two and is assumed to be 0. For the 
HF range, and in particular when f < 10 MHz, the antennas under consideration 
here are relatively close to the ground and the first two terms cancel, leaving only 
the third term. Furthermore, there can only be direct and reflected components 
when the transmitter and receiver are within radio line of sight of each other, 
whereas the surface wave can propagate much further than that, depending on 
surface conditions. 
 
When the signal at the receiver is composed of the sum of the direct wave and 
the reflected wave, the reflected path will impose a certain amount of additional 
phase delay. In addition to this phase difference at the receiver, an additional phase 
term is added due to the complex nature of the reflection coefficient at the point of 
reflection. 
 
The surface wave travels along the surface of the Earth from the transmitter to 
the receiver. The magnitude of this component of the signal is strongly dependent 
on the characteristics of the Earth between the transmitter and receiver. When 
good ground conditions for propagation (wet, for example, or sea water) are 
present, the surface wave component can extend to 100 km or more. 
First, consider the VHF case when there is no significant surface wave. Close 
to the earth, surface waves propagate poorly in the VHF and above ranges. 
Vertically polarized EM waves propagate better than those with horizontal 
polarization. For reliable propagation via the surface wave, the frequency must be 
limited to a range of about 1.5 MHz to 5 MHz. 
                                                           
3 The polarization of a propagating wave is the orientation of the E-field vector relative to something. 
Close to the Earth, that something is usually taken to be the unit vector tangent to the Earth’s surface. 
Not close to the Earth (in space, for example), the polarization is specified relative to something—
usually an antenna.

The permittivity and conductivity actually vary considerably with frequency 
and soil type as shown in Figure 5.2 [7]. The variability with frequency over the 
typical land mobile communication system range (low VHF) is not so great. In the 
cellular bands around 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz, however, the ground conditions 
significantly affect the permittivity and conductivity. 
The vertical polarization reflection coefficient, rv, is plotted in Figure 5.3 for 
when the frequency is mid-range through the low VHF, 60 MHz. The curves do 
not change much for anywhere in the range of 30 MHz to 90 MHz, however. 
Figure 5.3(a) is the magnitude, while Figure 5.3(b) is the phase. The three curves 
correspond to poor soil, average soil, and wet (good) soil with parameters given in

The angle where the minimum in the amplitude occurs is called the pseudo-
Brewster angle. This angle decreases with increasing soil conductivity being the 
least for salt water. 
The phase of the horizontal reflection coefficient, rh, is 180o for all of the 
conditions considered here, while the amplitude is shown in Figure 5.4. 
 
In summary, horizontally polarized waves always undergo an 180o phase 
reversal at the point of reflection. Vertically polarized waves undergo this phase 
reversal at reflection angles below the pseudo-Brewster angle but not above it, 
where the phase shift is less. 
The second component in the reflection coefficient in (5.3) is a factor    g(P, 
P’), which accounts for the finite dimensions of the reflecting plane. This function

is the value of the Fresnel-Kirchoff function shown in Figure 5.5. 
 
Distances dP and dP’ in these expressions are derived from analysis of the 
Fresnel zones. See [9] for a complete derivation. Figure 5.6 depicts the case of a 
reflection off the ground somewhere between the transmitter and receiver. The 
rays that travel between T and R that have equal time delays define the ellipsoid. 
When the path length is an integral multiple of /2, the ellipsoid is a cross section 
of the Fresnel zone corresponding to that multiple. Distance dP is the length of PC 
and dP’ is the length of P’C. In general dP  dP’, but they are equal if d1 = d2 in 
Figure 5.1. 
  
The number of Fresnel zones that must be included in this analysis depends 
on the size of the reflecting area. This, in turn, depends on the height of the 
 
Figure 5.6 Reflection ellipsoid between transmitter (T) and receiver (R). (Source: [9]. © IRE 1979.

The parameters in this equation are as shown in Figure 5.1. 
When the distances involved are short, the Earth can be modeled as a flat 
plane. In those cases, a propagating wave can be modeled as a direct wave and one 
interfering wave reflected off the Earth’s plane as seen in Figure 5.7. The Earth at 
the point of reflection can be modeled as smooth, where the wave is perfectly 
reflected, or rough. In the latter case, the wave after reflection is better modeled 
with random parameters. The method to discern between the two is presented here. 
The phase difference between the direct wave and reflected wave at the 
receiver can be expressed as [11] 
 
Figure 5.7 The two-ray model consists of a direct wave with a single reflected wave.

The received power at large distances (beyond DTO) therefore falls as the fourth 
power of that distance. In addition, it increases as the square of the heights of the 
product of the antennas. Lastly, it is independent of frequency. In the sequel, this 
propagation model will be called the two-ray model. 
This function is plotted in Figure 5.8 out to 100 km for some typical 
parameters. In this case, DTO is as shown in Table 5.2 so the graphs for ranges less

than this are not accurate. Also plotted is the received power due to free space for 
comparison. 
 
The free-space model (5.1) prescribes that the signal level falls as the square 
of the frequency. Thus, if the frequency is doubled, the signal level at a given 
distance is 6 dB less. This model indicates that beyond DTO, the signal level is 
independent of frequency. Thus, there is a fundamental difference between free- 
space propagation and propagation when there is a ground reflected wave 
involved.

for horizontal polarization. In these expressions r and  are the permittivity and 
conductivity of the soil in the area given in Figure 5.2 and hT and hR are the 
physical heights of the phase centers of the antennas. The ground characteristics 
do not change the antenna heights much above the VHF range. Table 5.3 
illustrates h0 for a few conditions. The effective antenna height for horizontal 
polarizations for all practical purposes is the same as the physical height for land 
mobile communications. For vertical polarizations in the low VHF range, the 
effective height can be considerably higher than the physical height. The effective 
height is increased more over water than over ground and is increased more over 
wet, or better conducting, ground than over poorly conducting, dry ground.

The jamming antenna also has an effective height that would typically be 
different from the transmitter and receiver. This would be especially true if the 
jammer were airborne. 
 
5.2.6 Surface Roughness 
 
The two-ray model described above assumes that the Earth is a smooth plane. In 
fact, this is rarely the case and surface roughness can impact on the reflection. If  
represents the standard deviation of the irregularities of the Earth’s surface relative 
to the mean height in a region, Parsons [13] derives the following as the Rayleigh 
criterion. This criterion, borrowed from the field of optics, was put forth by Sir 
Walter Rayleigh as the point when two diffracted light beams could be resolved. 
Considering Figure 5.9, the two beams on the left are not resolvable, the ones in 
the middle are just resolvable, and those on the right are over-resolved. In this 
figure,  is the phase difference of the two beams. Rayleigh’s criterion says that 
the resolution limit is where the null of one beam is placed at the maximum of the 
other. This occurs at  = /5. 
 
The same signal reflected from two surfaces a distance h apart, as illustrated 
in Figure 5.10, defines the roughness of a surface. The lower signal travels a 
distance of 2x1 more than the upper signal. By simple trigonometry,

where i is the standard deviation of the irregularities. From these expressions, it 
can be seen that for very irregular terrain when i is large, the roughness factor 
gets small and the reflection is mostly due to the diffuse component. Conversely,

when the surface is smooth, i  0, the f (i)  1, and the reflection is mostly 
specular. This terrain roughness factor is plotted in Figure 5.11. 
 
5.2.7 Diffraction Loss 
 
When a propagating signal encounters an obstacle with a sharp edge, signal 
diffraction occurs. Diffraction is a bending of the wave and accounts for the ability 
to receive signals behind mountains, for example. The scenario is shown 
schematically in Figure 5.12. In that case, define [15]

This function is plotted in Figure 5.13. There are also approximations to account 
for multiple such sharp peaks [17, 18]. 
If the edge is not peaked, but rounded, then the losses are normally greater than 
those predicted by this expression. The more rounded the peaks, the higher the 
diffraction loss. If the sharp peak in the knife-edge diffraction is replaced by a 
cylinder of radius r corresponding to approximately the roundness of the peak, 
then an excess loss is experienced given by [19]

where  denotes the angle between the ray paths as they cross over the peak. See 
Figure 5.14. The amount of this excess loss is shown in Figure 5.15 for several 
values of r / . Parson reports that if the peak is irregular, covered with trees for 
example, then the loss is only about 65% of the value computed with this equation. 
 
5.2.8 Terrain Irregularity 
 
The micro-effects of terrain irregularity on reflected wave propagation were 
discussed in Section 5.2.6. Larger-scale terrain irregularity affects all the 
propagation models discussed here. Let h denote the terrain irregularity 
parameter that is the interdecile range of the heights of the land above some level. 
Then one experiment produces the standard deviation of the field strength (E in 
dBV/m) as (h /  < 5,000) [20].

This function is plotted in Figure 5.16. Up to about h /  = 3,000 or so, an 
increase of terrain variability h relative to a wavelength causes an increase in the 
variability of the received signal strength. 
 
5.2.9 Attenuation Due to Woodlands 
 
Trees and other vegetation in dense woodlands will attenuate the signal level. The 
effect is seen in Figure 5.17 [21]. Denser and/or moister vegetation can increase 
these levels even more. Note that vegetation attenuates vertically polarized signals 
more than horizontally polarized ones.

This curve applies when the transmitter and receiver are both in and close to 
the woods. If they are well outside the woods with the woods between them, then 
the woods forms a diffracting obstacle and the discussion in Section 16.4.2 
applies. 
 
5.2.10 Multipath Reception 
 
In the VHF and above frequency range, signals normally arrive at a receiver from 
multiple directions, whether that receiver is the intended one or the jammer 
receiver. One of these could be the direct path from the transmitter or not. This 
phenomenon is caused by reflections of signals off multiple objects within the 
range of the communication system. In some situations, such as cellular phone 
systems in cities, multipath reflections may be the only components present—a 
direct path between the mobile handset and a base station does not exist. 
Moreover, in mobile communication situations, which are normally the case for 
land-mobile tactical communications, the arrival direction of these signals varies 
as the vehicles move. Such movement causes changing multipath effects. The 
faster the movement of the receiver and/or transmitter, the more rapid the 
fluctuations in the received signal. 
 
Multipath effects can include signal enhancement or signal degradation, 
depending on the phases and amplitudes of the reflected signals as they add at the 
receiver. Furthermore, for digital modulations intersymbol interference (ISI) 
occurs. This is when one or more symbols preceding the current symbol being 
received interfere with the current symbol due to one or more of these reflections 
because the distance traveled by the reflected signal is larger. Symbol overlap of 
10% or greater is usually enough to cause significant degradation in the 
communication system. The delay spread is a statistical measure of the time 
delays of the various multipath components. 
 
Two statistical approaches are usually used to model multipath reception: 
Ricean or Rayleigh. If there is no strong direct wave component, then the signal is 
diffuse and the Rayleigh distribution more accurately depicts the statistics of the 
received signals. If there is a strong direct wave component, then the signal is 
largely specular and the Ricean distribution is more accurate. A third approach that 
is more accurate than either of these and, in fact, includes the Ricean and Rayleigh 
channels as special cases is the Nakagami distribution. 
 
5.2.10.1 Ricean Fading 
 
Ricean fading occurs when there is a strong specular component present along 
with diffuse components. The joint probability density function (PDF) for 
amplitude a and phase  in this case is given by [11]

where a  is the local-mean power. This function is plotted in Figure 5.18. As K 
increases, the mean of the density gets larger and the maximum amplitude 
decreases. 
 
5.2.10.2 Rayleigh Fading 
 
Rayleigh fading occurs when there is no dominant signal, but reception is via one 
or more reflected and/or scattered components. As the receiver moves, the 
amplitude and phases of these components change, which causes varying 
reception. The amplitude of the received signal can be statistically described by 
the Rayleigh density function given by

Nakagami fading can be a more accurate model than either the Ricean or Rayleigh 
models. The Nakagami PDF was developed to model the fading on HF channels 
and is based on fitting the density to measured data. It more closely models the 
amplitude fading that occurs when there is no direct component better than the 
Rayleigh density function. The PDF is given by [23]

5.2.11 Doppler Shift 
 
When a signal is sent between a transmitter and receiver and the receiver is 
moving with a velocity v there is a change in the frequency of the signal that 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

occurs. This phenomenon is called the Doppler shift, named after the Austrian 
physicist Christian Doppler, who quantified it in 1845. Specifically, the frequency 
is changed by an amount

f



 
 (5.41) 
 
where  = c / fc is the wavelength and  is the angle of the incoming signal at the 
receiver relative to the direction of the receiver. In mobile communication 
situations typically many of these signals arrive at the same time at differing 
angles. That means the relationship between the amplitudes and phase angles is 
constantly changing as well. The maximum shift occurs when the receiver is 
moving directly away from or toward the transmitter where  = 1. That 
maximum frequency shift is given by

Doppler spread and S(f ) gives the density at any given frequency in this range. 
From the figure, it is clear that as the velocity increases, the density gets smaller 
and broader. 
 
5.2.11.1 Autocorrelation with Distance 
 
As a receiver moves, the phase and amplitudes of the multipath rays hitting the 
antenna change. The amount of change varies depending on the distance traveled.

There are three instrumentation, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands in 
North America, Europe, and Japan, the characteristics of which are given in Table 
2.3. Transmissions in these bands are unlicensed (but still restricted) by the federal 
governments of their respective countries so anyone can use them, subject to 
certain emission constraints (such as power level). The bands were established to 
allow for experimentation into radio technologies. They also provide useful ranges 
for expanding commercial cellular and PCS spectra.

DSSS system can operate in the presence of other narrowband signals without 
much degradation to either. Therefore, the frequency ranges are of interest to 
DSSS system designers. The band at 5.8 GHz has developed considerable interest 
for in-building communication for both personal phone systems and wireless local 
area networks (WLANs). 
 
Outdoor propagation at 5.4 GHz follows the same laws of physics as other 
frequency ranges in outdoor conditions. All of the models discussed apply as 
appropriate. Indoor propagation is different, although the same laws are followed. 
More on indoor propagation is presented later. 
 
5.2.12 Oxygen Absorption at 60 GHz 
 
The frequency band around 60 GHz has been proposed for use in outdoor 
microcellular systems, as well as indoor PCS systems. The primary advantage of 
this band is the absorption of RF signals by oxygen in the atmosphere that 
discourages interference of and by neighboring systems. A system on one floor of 
an office building, for example, would not interfere with that on another. The 
absorption of RF energy by oxygen and water can be seen in Figure 5.22 [27]. In 
addition to the absorption characteristics in the higher-frequency ranges, there is 
substantial bandwidth available at these frequencies. This facilitates considerably 
more simultaneous users. 
 
The absorption of water is an important factor in outdoor microcellular 
applications because of the effects of rain. When raining, the excessive absorption 
around 22 GHz and above 60 GHz makes these frequencies undesirable for 
outdoor applications. In indoor settings, picocells, for example, 22 GHz may be a 
good frequency to use, although 60 GHz provides substantially more attenuation.

Indoor delay spreads are on the order of 15 to 50 ns. To avoid intolerable 
distortion due to ISI, a maximum of 10% overlap in received symbols is required, 
limiting the minimum symbol time to 150–500 ns. This corresponds to a symbol 
rate of 2 Mbps–6.6 Mbps.  
 
5.2.13 Propagation Models 
 
Four models for calculating the losses encountered by VHF signals and above are 
presented in this section. 
 
5.2.13.1 Egli Propagation Model 
 
In 1957, John Egli developed a propagation model that was based on the above 
theoretical arguments, but introduced another factor that brings the frequency back 
into the mix. Since propagation tends to be frequency-dependent, he added a 
multiplicative factor to account for this [28]. The reported limits on this model are 
1 < DTR < 50 km and 30 MHz < f < 1 GHz. The median (exceeded 50% of the 
time) received power is given by [29] 
 
Figure 5.22 Specific attenuation at the higher frequencies. (Source: [27]. © John Wiley & Sons 1992.

where the frequency f is in megahertz, hT is the height of the transmit antenna, hR 
is the height of the receive antenna, PT is the transmit power, GTR is the gain of the 
transmit antenna in the direction of the receiver, GRT is the gain of the receive 
antenna in the direction of the transmitter, and DTR is the distance between the 
transmitter and receiver in units consistent with hT and hR. Expression (5.45) 
applies with the proper substitution of subscripts to the jammer links as well. This 
function is consistent with the two-ray model with n = 4 given previously. A plot 
of this function out to 100 km at 60 MHz is shown in Figure 5.23 for three 
transmit antenna heights (could be either antenna) compared with free-space 
propagation. 
It has also been reported that the standard deviation of the received signal 
power varies with frequency, as we would expect. This variation is described by 
the empirical equation [29]

with f in megahertz. This function is plotted in Figure 5.24. The standard deviation

where  is the wavelength of the signal. As mentioned previously, n is a constant 
that typifies the type of propagation conditions being considered. The Rn model is 
applicable for frequencies in the VHF range and above. This function is plotted in 
Figure 5.25 for n = 4 at 60 MHz. Again, (5.49) applies to the jammer links as well. 
Shown in Figure 5.26 is the SNR versus distance between the transmitter and a 
receiver, either the intended receiver or the receiver of the jammer, for three 
transmitter power levels. These SNR values are based on the Rn propagation 
model.  The frequency for the curves in Figure 5.26 was chosen to be midway 
through the low VHF range at 60 MHz. At that frequency, the noise is 
approximated according to the curves shown in Figure 2.10, where a suburban 
environment was assumed. In that case, the external noise is about 30dB
,
B
k TW or 
30 dB above a value of kBT0W. The receiver noise figure also adds to the noise 
level at the receiver as explained in Section 2.5.1. For the example considered 
here, it was assumed to be 15 dB, substantially less than the external noise, making 
this term negligible. It was further assumed that GT = GR = 1 (0 dB). 
Whereas the received signal level decreases, the noise level does not. It is 
frequently assumed constant, independent of spatial parameters. This, of course, is 
not always true especially when considering MMN, such as that from vehicle 
ignitions and welding machines. Thus, in this example, with a transmitter power of 
1 W, the SNR value of 8.9 dB or greater, corresponding to a BER of 10–2, is 
achieved at ranges less than about 20 km with no fade margin. If the transmitter 
power is 10 W then 8.9 dB is achieved at about 35 km and for 100 W at about 55 
km.

and C(f) is a constant given by Table 5.5. Rmin and Rmax refer to the minimum and 
maximum ranges over which the numbers are accurate. 
 
Applicability to the jammer links applies for the Nicholson model; however, 
attention to the ranges in Table 5.5 the altitude of the jammer is important as well. 
 
5.2.13.4 Longley-Rice Propagation Model 
 
This is a computer model developed in the 1960s for calculating propagation 
losses close to the Earth’s surface [31]. It is an empirical model with parameters 
 
Figure 5.26 SNR decreases as the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases. In this Rn
model example,  f = 60 MHz. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

based on field measurements. These measurements were taken at frequencies 
between 20 MHz–20 GHz. 
In the point-to-point mode, when the communication is between a single 
transmitter and single receiver (as opposed to the mobile, broadcast mode), the 
propagation path is determined to be free-space, line-of-sight, diffraction, or 
troposcatter, as illustrated in Figure 5.27, and the appropriate model parameters 
are adjusted accordingly. The model calculates the additional loss imposed over 
and above the free-space loss as a function of path length. This additional loss is 
denoted A and is composed of two components: the reference attenuation, denoted 
as Aref, which is attenuation due to frequency and distance, and Vmed, which is an 
adjustment to Aref that accounts for time, location, and situation variability. In the 
point-to-point mode, the location variability is not a factor. Therefore,

The time variability takes into account nine radio climates that vary throughout 
the year. Vmed is the mean additional attenuation and adjusts Aref for the median. 
Therefore, the resulting total loss is the loss that can be expected 50% of the time.

Extensive documentation for the Longley-Rice model is available at [32] 
along with a software listing in FORTRAN that implements it. It also contains the 
algorithm in pseudo-code so that adaption to other programming languages is 
straightforward. 
 
The Longley-Rice model applies to the jammer links as well. When used for 
placement of a jammer, the area mode is more applicable since the target locations 
are not normally known in advance. 
 
 
5.3 HF Signal Propagation 
 
5.3.1 Introduction 
 
HF signals propagate via two fundamental mechanisms: a ground-wave 
phenomenon and a sky-wave mode. While the overall characteristics are presented 
here, [33] is an excellent source for more detailed information on the HF signal 
propagation modes. 
 
5.3.2 Noise 
 
Just as in the VHF range and higher, there are two fundamental sources of noise: 
external and internal. Below about 10 MHz, however, the external noise is usually 
much greater than the internal noise. In this frequency range, atmospheric noise is 
by far the dominating source. This is noise caused by lightning in thunderstorms 
and sandstorms. It can travel great distances by the same mechanisms that signals 
propagate in the ionosphere. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
354
Figure 2.9 illustrates the levels of atmospheric noise in the frequency range 
below 100 MHz. Even though the product kBTW represents a power level, the 
value of Fa in these charts can be used to predict the noise electrical field strength. 
The RMS field strength is related to Fa, which is the noise level relative to kBT0W,

where En is for a 1 kHz bandwidth in decibels above 1 V m–1. If bandwidths 
other than 1 kHz are under consideration then 20log10WkHz must be added. For 
example, if the bandwidth is 10 kHz, then 20 dB more noise will be present. If the 
bandwidth is 500 Hz then 20log10(0.5) = –6 dB must be added. For different 
conditions such as time of year, or time of day, these levels would be different; 
those shown are representative. The noise power in decibels above kBTW is given

There is variability to these parameters since they represent statistical 
processes. A reasonable value to use in many cases for this variability is 10 dB 
[34]. Thus, to ensure system performance, 10 dB must be added to the ordinate. 
This factor represents a reasonable estimate for a fade margin in this frequency 
range. 
 
MMN is also shown in Figure 2.9. This is noise from arc welders, neon signs, 
vehicle ignitions and the like, that are products of humans. These noise sources 
can be significant in the HF frequency range, especially since an advancing 
brigade is not exactly quiet. We discussed MMN in depth in Chapter 2. 
 
5.3.3 Ground Wave 
 
Reliable ground-wave propagation is limited to the frequency range of 1.5 to       
10 MHz. The quality of such communications is highly dependent upon the Earth 
characteristics over which the signal propagates. Used for communication by ships 
at sea where the sea provides favorable conditions for propagation, ranges up to 
1,000 km can be accommodated with the ground wave at relatively low 
transmitted power. 
 
Two models for HF ground EM wave propagation are presented in this 
section. The first is considerably simplified, which makes quick calculations easy. 
The second, due to Bremmer, is considerably more complicated, as well as 
accurate, and is suitable for computer implementation. As explained later, the 
Bremmer model is not suitable for sky-wave propagation.

Braun defines four conditions for which calculation of the propagation loss 
factor A is different, as follows [35]: 
 
1. Av, where DTR < DCR, for vertical polarization and the distance is short 
enough so the curvature of the Earth can be ignored; 
2. Ah, where DTR < DCR, same as 1 for horizontal polarization; 
3. Av, where DTR > DCR, for vertical polarization and the distance is such 
that the curvature of the Earth must be taken into consideration; 
4. Ah, where DTR > DCR, same as 3. for horizontal polarization.

when f is expressed in megahertz. This function is plotted in Figure 5.28. It is 
assumed here that the ground is homogeneous between the transmitter and 
receiver. Homogeneous in this case means that the soil conditions are the same all 
along the path between the transmitter and receiver. In addition to that, it assumes 
that the conditions are the same for considerable depth into the soil. At HF 
frequencies the signals penetrate the Earth as a function of the soil conditions 
approximately as shown in Table 5.6 [36]. Since HF signals can propagate for 
considerable distances, this assumption is only valid for short paths. For longer 
paths, the propagation must be evaluated for each segment. This is illustrated in 
Figure 5.29. 
 
For all practical purposes, horizontally polarized surface waves do not 
propagate well in the HF range so this polarization will not be considered further.

The signal strength using this function is plotted in Figure 5.30 for medium soil 
conditions at 20oC. For this curve PT = 50 W, GTR = 0 dB and hT = hR =  / 4. 
 
Curves for the other soil conditions are similar to Figure 5.30. Salty seawater 
facilitates ground-wave propagation better than fresh water. Fresh water and moist 
ground characteristics are similar. 
Receiver sensitivities of 15 dBV/m are typical in the HF range. Therefore, all 
conditions considered here allow C2 of land forces at tactical ranges (< 30 km). 
These calculations and curves apply, of course, to the transmitter-to-receiver 
path, the transmitter to jammer path and the jammer-to-receiver path. The signal 
level, however, is only half the story. Reception quality also depends on the 
amount of noise present. Define a measure of signal-to-noise ratio as

Figure 5.31 SNR for medium soil conditions. 
 
 
 
SNR = ER/En as determined by (5.56) and (5.61). Then Figure 5.31 shows the SNR 
for medium soil conditions when PT = 50 W, GTR = 0 dB, hR = hT = /2, and the 
noise level at 1 MHz is 90 dB in Figure 2.9. The bandwidth of the signal for this 
chart was 3 kHz, typical for voice communications in the HF region. Then at         
1 MHz, Fa = 50 dB, at  5 MHz  Fa = 30 dB, and at 10 MHz, Fa = 30 dB. Note from 
Figure 2.9 that at these frequencies and grades of service, the MMN at a quiet 
location is on the same order as the atmospheric noise. Thus, the amount of noise 
is approximately twice that of each source alone, or about 3 dB higher. 
An SNR of 10 dB would be considered enough for relatively clear reception as 
long as it was at this level constantly. Charts similar to Figure 5.31 show that with 
a 50 dB noise level at 1 MHz, at link distances typical of land force C2, the signal 
produced by the ground-wave is large enough out to at least 40 km to facilitate 
communication. 
When the diffraction angle  <  / 2Re radians, where Re is the radio radius of 
the Earth (4/3 its actual radius assuming it is a sphere), then there is no appreciable 
direct wave nor can there be a reflected wave. Diffraction is the predominant cause 
of propagation in this region and the loss settles to a constant 0.62/1/3 dB km–1. 
The critical angle is plotted in Figure 5.32. The loss in this region is shown in 
Figure 5.33 for a few frequencies. 
 
5.3.3.2 Bremmer Model 
 
Bremmer documented an HF ground-wave propagation model [37] that was 
subsequently modified somewhat by Fulks for the Defense Nuclear Agency 
(DNA) [38]. It is widely believed  that  in  the  event  of a nuclear explosion in the

atmosphere, the D-layer (explained later) will be so disturbed and loaded with 
extra charges that sky wave HF propagation will not be possible as the D-layer 
would not let any wavefronts through (in either direction). HF ground-waves 
would not be affected, however. Therefore, the DNA was interested in how well 
HF ground-waves propagate. 
In any case, the model estimates the electric field emitted from a short vertical 
dipole antenna driven by a 1 kW transmitter through lossless cables at distances 
over an assumed smooth earth. As modified by Fulks (and corrected here), it is 
given by the expression

5.3.4 Sky Wave 
 
The ionosphere is the region of the Earth’s atmosphere that extends from 
approximately 50 km to 600 km altitude. It is located just above the stratosphere 
that extends from about 10 km to 50 km altitude. The stratosphere, in turn, is 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
366
situated just above the troposphere that extends from the Earth’s surface to an 
altitude of about 10 km. 
 
Except for Earth to space links, all VHF and above propagation occurs within 
the troposphere and so propagation characteristics are determined mostly by this 
region. HF and lower communications can transpire within the troposphere as 
well, as in the case of the ground-wave discussed above. There is another mode of 
propagation, however, that is supported by the ionosphere. This region will reflect 
(refract, actually) HF and lower-frequency signals back to the Earth. The Earth, in 
turn, will sometimes reflect the signals back up toward the ionosphere. Very long- 
distance 
communication 
is 
possible 
this 
way 
with 
multiple 
such 
refractions/reflections. 
Propagation of HF signals via the sky-wave is complicated to treat 
theoretically. The interaction of the Earth’s magnetic field with electrons in the 
ionosphere and  the ionization of the ionosphere by the sun lead to many complex 
properties. Propagation via ionospheric refraction is made possible by ultraviolet 
rays from the sun energizing atoms in the ionosphere that cause free electrons, 
 
Figure 5.34 Example of field strengths computed with Bremmer’s model. These ground constants are 
for sea water. In addition, the transmitter power is 1 kW, vertical polarization, and neither antenna is 
elevated. (Source: [38].) 

Radio Signal Propagation 
 
367
thus creating positive ions. The electron density in the ionosphere tends to be 
formed into regions at specific heights, which vary according to the sunspot 
activity that frees the electrons. The interaction of the traveling waves with these 
ions and free electrons facilitates propagation. The ion density in the ionosphere 
can reach as high as 1012 ions (or electrons) per cubic meter. 
 
During the daytime, there are four identifiable layers in the ionosphere: D, E, 
F1, and F5. The E, F1, and F2 layers will refract EM waves, while the D layer 
does not. The D layer, however, can significantly attenuate signals passing through 
it. The D layer forms at altitudes of about 60 to 90 km with a half thickness4 of 
typically 10 km. As mentioned above, in the event of a nuclear explosion, it is 
believed that the D layer will become so ionized that the traversal of HF EM 
waves through it will be impossible or at least severely attenuated. 
The maximum ionization of the E layer normally occurs at about 120 km with 
a half thickness of 20 to 25 km. The F1 layer forms about 170–220 km with a half 
thickness of about 50 km. The F2 layer forms from 225 to 400 km altitude with a 
half thickness of 100 to 200 km. In addition, there is occasionally an additional 
layer called sporadic E, denoted Es, which forms at an altitude of 120 km with a 
very small half-thickness of 300 m to 1 km. The concentration of electrons in the 
Es layer is much higher than the other regions and therefore higher frequencies are 
refracted in them. At night, the D and E layers completely disappear and the two F 
layers combine into a single layer. Figure 5.35 depicts the characteristics of the 
ionosphere. 
 
As the sun traverses the sky, the layers are formed and changed. The 
concentration of the D layer is highest at midday. Because of the changing layer 
electron densities and half thickness, the frequencies that are usable by refraction 
change as the day goes on. Furthermore, when the day to night and night to day 
transitions (called the day/night terminators) occur, there is considerable turmoil 
in the ionosphere. Thus, it is normally necessary to monitor the usable frequencies 
and adjust the one in use. In addition, the usable frequencies change with the 
season and latitude. 
 
Figure 5.36 shows some of the possible paths HF sky waves can take as they 
propagate. A single wave can be refracted by any of the refractive layers and 
reflected by the Earth several times. 
 
The ionosphere will refract a maximum frequency at any given moment. 
There is also a minimum. If the frequency is too high, it will pass through without 
being refracted. If it is too low, the D-layer absorption will prevent it from 
reaching the refracting layers. The maximum frequency is called the maximum 
usable frequency (MUF), while the minimum frequency is called the lowest usable 
frequency (LUF). These frequencies are different for the E layer, F1 layer, and F2  
 
 
                                                           
4 The half thickness of a layer is the thickness where the density falls to one-half of its maximum value.

layer because they are largely determined by the actual electron density near the 
refraction region. 
The critical frequency (also called the ionospheric plasma frequency) is the 
highest frequency that the F layer will refract. Ionospheric sounders normally are 
used to determine this frequency. A vertical sounder radiates signals directly 
upward toward the ionosphere. The frequency is swept and the return time and 
amplitude are measured. The frequency where the signal no longer returns is the 
critical frequency. More accurate ionospheric information is obtained with an 
oblique sounder, which attempts to measure the characteristics near the region 
where refraction occurs. It does this by aiming its swept signal toward that region. 
This is possible in a cooperative communication situation, but is not likely to be 
possible for uncooperative EW or EA. 
 The amount of bending due to refraction in the ionosphere is due primarily to 
two factors: the wavelength (and therefore frequency) of the signal and the ion 
density in the ionospheric layer. The higher the density, the more bending occurs, 
and the longer the wavelength (lower the frequency), the more the bending. An 
additional factor called the critical angle is also a determinant of whether a signal 
is refracted enough by the ionosphere to return to Earth. At a given frequency and 
ionospheric layer with a given density, the critical angle is that angle at which if 
the signal impinges on the layer at a higher angle (more toward zenith), the signal 
will  pass  through  and  not  be  refracted  by  that layer. With (im)proper antenna 
orientation it is possible for the sky wave to interfere with the ground-wave. 
Normally there is, by design, a skip zone, which is the region between where the 
ground-wave ends and the sky wave returns to Earth the first time. In this region, 
there is no appreciable signal strength. By orienting the antenna so that the sky-
wave signal takes off close to zenith, however, the sky wave will return virtually 
straight back down, forming a cone around the transmitter. This is called the near 
vertical incidence sky-wave (NVIS) and is useful for relatively short-range 
communications in mountainous terrain, for example. The ground-wave can 
interfere with the NVIS signal, however, and vice versa. 
As noted, it is possible that an EM wave can be refracted by the ionosphere 
and reflected by the Earth many times. The wave propagation mode is indicated by 
the notations 1F1, 1F2, 2F2, and so forth. The first number is the number of hops 
the wave makes. The second letter/number combination is the ionospheric layer of 
refraction. Because of the altitudes of the refracting layers, very long 
communication paths are possible using HF sky-wave links. One-hop F layer 
refractions can propagate 3,000 km or more, while multihop signals can propagate 
around the world. One-hop E-layer signals can propagate up to around 2,000 km. 
 
The signal arriving at the receiver, then, consists of potentially several signals 
refracted off the ionosphere as well as a ground-wave component. Let Gj(Aj,j,j,t) 
denote the gain of path j where Aj denotes the attenuation factor of the path, j is

the ground-wave. 
 
A closed-form expression for determining the signal level for sky-wave 
signals in the HF range is currently unavailable. Calculation of the performance of 
HF sky-wave links is based on measured parameters of the ionosphere such as the 
length. Braun [39] describes a procedure for calculating the expected performance 
of sky-wave communication links. A similar procedure is described by Davies 
[40]. 
 Phenomena known as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) frequently 
occur. These are uneven shapings of one or more of the layers and can cause 
unexpected reflection angles from the layer. Signals can be focused or defocused 
by the TIDs. This focusing is illustrated in Figure 5.37, which can cause signals to 
arrive stronger or weaker. A TID can last for 10 minutes or longer and travel 
through a layer. Their horizontal speed is on the order to 5–10 km per minute. 
 
Primarily because closed-form equations for the prediction of HF sky-wave 
signal propagation characteristics are not available, a modeling program for 
worldwide HF propagation has been developed over several years by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA), Institute for Telecommunications Sciences (ITS) and its 
predecessors. The program is available free on the Internet [41]. It is called the 
Ionospheric Communication Enhanced Profile Analysis and Circuit (ICEPAC) 
prediction program. This model is very flexible and provides data such as the 
MUF, expected SNRs at the receiver using two points or in an area mode, and 
field strength at the receiver using two points or in an area mode. Many graphical 
presentations are available from the model—example outputs are shown in Figures 
5.38 and 5.39 (the actual displays are, of course, in color).

Jammers for the sky-wave modes of HF propagation are subject to the same 
limitations as the communicator. The implications of the MUFs and LUFs are the 
same, but it is important to keep in mind that the propagation paths between the 
transmitter and receiver are generally going to be dramatically different from the 
jammer links. 
 
 
5.4 Concluding Remarks 
 
The fundamentals of RF signal propagation important to understanding spread 
spectrum systems were presented in this chapter. The vast majority of spread 
spectrum systems for land mobile forces use the VHF and higher-frequency 
spectrum, but some use the HF range. Therefore, salient characteristics of both 
were presented. 
 
The bandwidth available in the VHF range and above is the primary reason 
for the interest in that frequency spectrum. In the range below about 30 MHz, by 
international agreement, the bandwidths are narrow—typically 3 kHz or so. In the 
VHF range, they are normally 25 kHz, and in the UHF range they are wider than 
that. With   newer  communication  technology,  these  bandwidths  are  becoming  
 
Figure 5.37 TIDs. TIDs can cause dispersion or concentration due to their focusing effects.

narrower, however, and the same or more information can be sent over such 
channels. 
 
The attenuation of RF signals with distance is probably the most important 
propagation effect. In clear space, when there are no obstacles to impact the 
propagating sphere of RF energy, the attenuation increases as 1 / R5. In most cases 
of C2 of military ground forces, it is more appropriate to use 1 / R4, however. If 
propagation into and out of buildings is important, a factor higher than 4 is 
necessary.  
Direct wave propagation in the HF range follows these same physical laws. 
Ionospheric, long-distance HF communication, however, is governed by factors 
that are more complicated and it is normally necessary to measure the attenuation.

Feedback Shift Registers and Recursive 
Sequences 
 
 
6.1 Introduction 
 
 
SS systems use pseudo-random sequences as the underlying codes to spread the 
data streams. These sequences are normally, but not always, generated with shift 
registers. This chapter introduces shift registers and how they are used to generate 
such sequences.  The specific types of shift registers considered here linear 
feedback shift registers (LFSRs), which have properties that are useful for 
generating linear recursive sequences (LRSs), and nonlinear feedback shift 
registers (NLFSRs), which generate nonlinear recursive sequences (NLRSs). LRS 
is another appellation for a pseudo-random sequence. Before discussing these 
topics, however, a discussion of Galois fields is presented for those not familiar 
with the topic. FSR operation and RS properties are derived from the Galois field 
theory. 
 
This chapter is included to provide an introduction to this basic technology 
and how such registers are used in AJ systems. Linear sequences are relatively 
easy to exploit, however. 
 
The structure of this chapter is as follows. We start with a review of Galois 
fields, as they form the mathematical underpinnings for shift registers. We then 
discuss the basic characteristics of shift registers. Maximal sequences are 
introduced after that followed by a discussion on correlation functions. The 
properties of m-sequences as they are used in modern communication systems is 
then covered. An introduction to product codes, such as Gold codes and Kasami 
sequences, is then provided. Some linear feedback shift register fundamental 
design issues are then presented followed by a discussion of some applications of 
LFSRs in modern communication systems, particularly LPI systems. Lastly, we 
briefly discuss nonlinear feedback shift registers, although most of the theoretical 
properties of these are still unknown.

6.2 Galois Fields 
 
A field is a mathematical construct comprised of a closed set of elements X = {Xi}, 
possibly infinite, and two operations denoted  and . The operations  and  are 
called multiplication and addition, by convention. Closed here means that if Xi and 
Xj are in the field then so are Xi  Xj and Xi  Xj. In a field there exists an additive 
identity element denoted by 0 such that for every element Xi in X there exists 
another element in X, called the additive inverse and denoted by –Xi, such that Xi  
(–Xi) = 0. In a field there exists a multiplicative identity element denoted by 1 such 
that for every element Xi in X, except 0, there exists another element in X, denoted 
Xi
–1, such that Xi  Xi
–1 = 1. 
 
In addition to these characteristics, for X to be a field,  and  must be 
commutative:

where the parentheses mean that the operation contained within them is performed 
first. 
A familiar example of a field is the set of all real numbers, both positive and 
negative, including 0;  is the arithmetic multiplication, and  is arithmetic 
addition. The multiplicative identity element is the number 1 while the additive 
identity element is the number 0. The set of integers is not a field since for any 
element other than 1, there is no integer multiplicative inverse. 
 
LRS theory is based on Galois fields. A Galois field is one that is limited in 
size (not infinite) and the number of elements in the field is a prime number, p, or 
an integer power of a prime number. Galois fields are denoted by GF(p). It can be 
shown that for any prime number p and integer m, GF(pm) is also a field. GF(pm) is 
called an extension field of p. 

Feedback Shift Registers and Recursive Sequences 
 
379
For the analysis of LFSRs for AJ communications, particular Galois fields are 
of interest. These have elements from 2m for some integer m and they are denoted 
by GF(2m). The binary field is perhaps the simplest to understand. It consists of 
two elements, 0 and 1, and is denoted as GF(2). The operations in this field are the 
exclusive OR, denoted by , which is analogous to the addition function in the 
field of real numbers but without carry, and multiplication, denoted by , which is 
analogous to the multiplication function in the field of real numbers. The 
definition of these operations is shown in Table 6.1. Herein, when there is no 
confusion that would result, modulo-2 multiplication, in conformance with normal 
practice, will be denoted simply by placing variables next to each other; thus,        
a  b = ab. Note that multiplication modulo-2 is the same function as normal 
integer multiplication. It is also equivalent to the binary logical AND function. 
GF(2m) consists of all m-tuples of binary digits, that is, from {0, 1}. Thus, 
when m = 4, for example, GF(24) consists of the elements given in Table 6.2. The 
arithmetic in GF(2m) is called modulo-2 arithmetic. 
 
Modulo-2 arithmetic is used in GF(2m). This arithmetic is similar to binary 
arithmetic except there is no carry function. That is, 
 
 
and the 1 that would be carried from the first column on the right in binary 
arithmetic is not carried in modulo-2 arithmetic. Also, in modulo-2 arithmetic, 
each element in GF(2m) is its own additive inverse because 0  0 = 0, 1  1 = 0, 
while 1  0 = 1 and 0  1 = 1. Also, subtraction of b from a, defined as a + (–b), 
is accomplished by the addition operator; thus, addition and subtraction are 
equivalent.

where the coefficients fi are selected from GF(2) and D is an indeterminate, are 
useful for analyzing LFSRs. The nature of D is not significant for our purposes. 
The mathematical operations that are defined for when the coefficients are real 
numbers apply in this case as well, except the mathematics is carried out modulo-
2. Thus, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined in the 
familiar way.  
The Euclidean division algorithm [1] states that any polynomial f (D) of degree 
m over GF(2) can be divided by another polynomial, g(D) over GF(2), of degree at 
least 1 as

where h(D) is the quotient and r(D) is the remainder, and r(D) has a maximum 
degree of m – 1. As an example, suppose f (D) = D4 + D2 + 1 and g(D) = D3 + 1. 
Then 
 
 
so h(D) = D and r(D) = D2  D  1.

If r(D), = 0 then g(D) is said to divide f (D). If g(D) divides f (D), then g(D) is 
said to be a factor of f (D). Most of the characteristics of interest for LRS 
generation and analysis are associated with the remainder, r(D). 
 
These polynomials have roots just as polynomials over the real field do. A 
root of f (D) is any value of D for which f (D) = 0. Thus, D = 1 is a root of D3  1 
because letting D = 1, 13  1 = 1  1  1  1 = 0. The roots of a polynomial need 
not necessarily be in GF(2), just as the roots of a polynomial over the real field 
may be complex and therefore not part of the real field. In addition, if f (D) is 
factorable, then it is said to be reducable; otherwise, it is said to be irreducible. 
The factorization of f (D) is unique as well. An irreducible polynomial is also 
known as a primitive polynomial. From above, (D – 1) is a factor of D3  1. This 
can be verified by 
 
 
 
 
Thus, r(D) = 0 and D3  1 = (D  1)(D2  D  1). 
 
The extension field of GF(2) of degree m, GF(2m), has 2m elements in it. There 
are 2m distinct polynomials over GF(2) of degree m – 1. Therefore, these 
polynomials can represent each of the elements of GF(2m) on a one-to-one basis. 
Addition of the polyonmials occurs in the normal way and each polynomial is its 
own additive inverse. The product of two polynomials of degree m (all 
polynomials are of degree m as long as m is equal to or greater than the largest 
degree of all the polynomials under consideration, with the appropriate 
coefficients set to 0, as necessary, in some of the polynomials) is defined as the 
remainder after the two polynomials are multiplied normally, and the product 
divided by the irreducible polynomial, h(D), used to define multiplication. Thus, 
the multiplication is defined modulo-h(D). Therefore, the elements of GF(2m) can 
be described by their corresponding polynomial. 
 
Polynomials defined over GF(2) form what is called an Abelian 
(commutative) group with polynomial addition as the operator. A group is a 
mathematical structure with fewer restrictions than a field; that is, a field is an 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
382
Abelian group, but the inverse is not necessarily true. Polynomial multiplication is 
communicatve and associative, and obeys the distributive law, but polynomials 
defined over a field do not form a field. What is missing is a multiplicative inverse 
of f (D), f- –1(D), so that f (D)f- –1(D) = 1. 
 
 
6.3 Shift Registers 
 
Shift register sequences are the mechanism to control the frequency in an FHSS 
system and to determine the bit sequence in DSSS systems. Short sequences are 
more readily exploited than long sequences, mainly because the latter take longer 
to repeat. Short sequences used by FHSS targets facilitate discovering the hopping 
frequencies in use and their pattern, and therefore predictive jamming can be used, 
which is the most efficient and effective kind. 
A shift register consists of delay elements and digital logic. The delay elements 
are depicted as in Figure 6.1. Delay elements are also called one-bit registers and 
flip-flops. Whatever digital bit is present on the input (D) is stored when the clock 
signal occurs. The stored bit is available on the output (Q). This bit is stored 
indefinitely until either the power is removed (assuming volatile implementations) 
or another clock signal occurs. Most delay elements can also be preloaded with 
binary digits as well. Whatever value is on the preset line when the load signal 
occurs is stored in the element. 
 
Figure 6.1 Delay element. 

Feedback Shift Registers and Recursive Sequences 
 
383
In the remainder of this book, for clarity we will not show the clock, preset, or 
load inputs to the delay elements. It is important to remember, however, that they 
are involved in the proper operation of shift registers. 
A shift register is configured with one or more delay elements connected one 
after the other. A four stage shift register is depicted in Figure 6.2. The output of 
one element forms the input to the next. The serial output of the register is usually 
taken as the output of the last stage. It is also possible to use all or some of the 
stages as simultaneous, parallel outputs. 
Suppose this shift register is preloaded with 1001 and the sequence 0100, in 
succession, was applied to the input to the first stage. The bits would shift through 
the register on each clock pulse following the pattern shown in Figure 6.3. At the 
end of m = 4 clock pulses, the shift register contains exactly what comprises the 
input sequence, with the first bit in the last stage, the second bit in the third stage, 
the third bit in the second stage, and the last bit in the first stage. 
Note that the register can also be preloaded by inputting the initial sequence 
through the first stage serially and clocking the register four times. Parallel 
initialization such as indicated here is faster, if that is an issue, which it normally is 
not for spread spectrum applications. 
Now suppose that the last stage of the shift register is fed back to the input 
stage as shown in Figure 6.4. If the register is preloaded with 1001, the register 
will continue to generate this sequence after every four clock pulses. 
Linear recursive sequences are formed with shift registers by combining the 
outputs of one or more stages and feeding them back to the input stage. By 
including these elements, sequences longer than m can be generated with an m-
 
 
Figure 6.3 Four-stage shift register sequence. 
 
Figure 6.2 Four-stage shift register. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
384
stage register. The logic element used to perform this combining is the XOR. Its 
truth table is given in Figure 6.5(a). The XOR is sometimes referred to as a half 
adder because its output is the binary sum of the inputs with no carry function 
implemented (see Figure 6.6). Note that the truth table in Figure 6.5 is the same as  
the operation performed in GF(2m) by the addition operator. 
  
Suppose that stages 3 and 4 are combined and fed back to the input of the first 
stage as illustrated in Figure 6.7. Then with the initial load of 1001 the sequence 
shown in Table 6.3 is generated. The two rows in bold are the same, indicating the 
sequence is starting over. A length 15 sequence is thus generated with a four-stage 
register. This is the maximum length, as it is equal to N = 2m – 1 with m = 4 in this 
case. Such a sequence is called a maximal sequence, or m-sequence. 
By using different feedback taps in an LFSR, different sequences are generated 
even with the same initial load; however, some of these sequences may not be 
maximal. A different initial load of an LFSR that generates an m-sequence will 
generate the same m-sequence  but with a  different phase—that is, the m-sequence

starts at a different point but the bit pattern is the same. 
 
Careful inspection of Table 6.3 reveals that every 4-bit binary number except 
0 is displayed in one of the rows and each occurs only once. This is characteristic 
of maximal sequences. If the shift register ever contains all 0’s, it will remain in 
that state forever. Therefore, all 0’s in the shift register is not part of the sequence 
generated nor can it be an initial load. 
 
The LRS generator shown in Figure 6.7 has the XOR in the feedback path. 
Such a configuration is sometimes referred to as an S-type LFSR. Another name 
for this architecture is the Fibonacci configuration [2]. It is also possible to put 
them in the feedforward path between the register stages as shown in Figure 6.8. 
The sequence generated by this register is given in Table 6.4. Notice that in this 
case the sequence generated is not maximal. The pattern repeats itself after only 
three clock pulses, illustrated by the bold rows in Table 6.4. 
Feedforward shift registers can also be configured to generate maximal 
sequences, however, as seen in Figure 6.9 and Table 6.5. Here, the m-sequence is 
generated with period N = 2m – 1 = 15. Feedforward LRS generators are also 
sometimes referred to as an M-type LFSR. Another name for this type of shift 
register is the Galois configuration. The Galois configuration is usually preferred

when implemented in hardware because there are fewer logic elements in the 
feedback path and therefore the LFSR is faster. This is less of a factor when the 
LFSR is implemented in software. 
The general forms for the two types of LFSRs are shown in Figures 6.10 and 
6.11. The multiplication factors gi determine whether stage i in the LFSR is used 
in the feedback or feedforward paths. 
The following analysis of the mathematics of the LFSR are taken from [3] and 
follows that development closely. From Figure 6.10, the sequence xi is given by

The denominator in this ratio is called the characteristic polynomial for the LFSR 
and depends only on the interconnections as represented by the gi. The numerator 
depends on the initialization load for the LFSR and determines the phase of the 
sequence. 
If the sequence corresponding to g(x) is an m-sequence, that is, it has a period 
N, then f (x) must divide 1  DN. In addition, for g(x) to generate an m-sequence, it 
is necessary (but not sufficient) that f (x) be primative, which, as discussed above, 
is true if and only if f (x)  f1(x)f2(x) for any f1(x) and f2(x). 
 
The XOR logic element is the one used for the combination of the stages in an 
LFSR, however, other logic elements are also used. In an LFSR they are not used 
for feedback or feedforward purposes, but to form the the output sequence. We 
will see later that they are used for these purposes in nonlinear shift registers. 
AND, OR, NAND, and NOR combinational logic elements can be used to 
advantage to form sequences with particular properties. 
 
Shift registers can be used to multiply and divide polynomials whose 
coefficients are from GF(2) as described in Section 6.1.1. The diagram shown in 
Figure 6.12 multiplies the two polynomials y(D) and g(D) [4, 5], x(D) = y(D)g(x).

6.4 Maximal Sequences 
 
Two m-sequences are cyclically equivalent if they are time shifted versions of one 
another. If two m-sequences are not cyclically equivalent, then they are called 
cyclically distinct. Table 6.6 gives the number of cyclically distinct m-sequences 
for some values of N [6]. The number of primitive polynomials of degree m is 
given by [6]

A sequence generated with an LFSR of length N is referred to as an RN code. 
Thus, when N = 7, an R7 code is generated. 
 
 
6.5 Correlation Functions 
 
The correlation of two sequences is a measure of how similar the two are at bit 
offsets from one another. A sequence that is not offset at all from a copy of itself 
will have maximum correlation since the bit values are identical. The correlation is 
given by the sum of the products of the two sequences taking each bit position one 
at a time. Since 1  1 = –1  –1 = 1, when they are identical, the correlation value 
will equal N = 2m – 1. When the two sequences are offset from one another, 
approximately half of the values in the correlation sum will be +1 and half will be 
–1. The sums are therefore near zero.  
 
The autocorrelation function of a sequence x(k) consisting of elements from 
GF(2) is given by

Figure 6.15. Note that even with these short sequences, the correlation was higher 
when the sequences were alike in Figure 6.14 at a 0-bit lag. 
In spread spectrum communication systems, it is important to have sequences 
where the autocorrelation function is large at zero lag so that synchronization can 
be accomplished. At lags other than zero it is desirable that the autocorrelation be 
small so the false synchronization lock can be avoided. In addition, the cross 
correlation between two sequences being used by two different communication 
systems should be low even at zero lag so that a false correlation indication of the 
two signals is avoided. 
The properties mentioned above apply when the entire period of a sequence is 
available for processing. This is not always the case, especially when N is large. In 
those cases, large values of the correlation function of a sequence may very well 
occur at other than zero lag and this must be taken into consideration. 
In addition, these properties assume that the signals are time-synchronized, that 
is, the bit timing is the same for the signals being considered. Synchronizing these 
signals is more difficult (we discuss a technique for chip-timing synchronizing in 
otherwise asynchronous systems in Chapter 7). Sometimes GPS signals are used to 
accomplish this time synchronization. GPS timeticks are accurate to within 100 ns 
or so and very accurate bit clocks can be maintained in the mobile phones. 
An effective jamming technique that will be discussed at length later is to 
attack the synchronization process in both DSSS and FHSS systems. If the targets 
can be prevented from synchronizing they cannot communicate at all. 
 
There is a lower bound on the cross-correlation function between two           
m-sequences with period N, which was discovered by Welch. It is given by [3, 7]

6.6 Properties of m-Sequences 
 
This section presents some properties of m-sequences that make them particularly 
useful in SS systems. 
 
Property 1: There is only one value of correlation between two phases of an      
m-sequence that is other than 1/N. Thus, for sequence x:

The correlation function repeats itself every 2m – 1 bits. This is particularly useful 
for synchronizing the locally generated sequence to that of the incoming signal. 
 
The bit offset of the local sequence is frequently determined by sliding the 
two sequences past each other. When there is no bit offset between the two, then   
 = 0 and the correlation peak occurs. This is illustrated in Figure 6.16. If

Property 2: As illustrated in Table 6.3, an m-sequence generates all possible m bit 
binary numbers except for the all zero tuple. Furthermore there is one run of 1s of 
length m, one run of 0s of length m – 1, two runs of 1s of length m – 2, two runs of 
0 of length m – 2 and, in general, n runs of 1s of length m – n, and n runs of 0 of 
length m – n, where n = 1 to m. 
 
Property 3: Combining two phase offset versions of the sequence yields another 
phase offset version of the same sequence. Combining in this case refers to the 
XOR function or modulo-2 addition. 
 
Property 4: An m-sequence contains one more one than zero. The number of 1s 
will equal 2m–1, while the number of 0s will equal 2m–1 – 1. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
398
 
Figure 6.16 Product codes are generated by combining two m-sequences with an XOR. 
 
Property 5: In any two instantiations of an m-sequence (same sequence but 
shifted in offset), the number of 1s is about equal to the 0s in both sequences. 
 
Property 6: An LFSR of size m produces a sequence with period N. 
 
 
6.7 Product Codes 
 
Product codes are codes that are generated by combining two (or more) m-
sequences with an XOR as shown in Figure 6.16. The constituent m-sequences are 
called factors since they, in a sense, are multiplied together to generate the product 
code and they are factors just as 2 and 3 are factors of 6. Product codes generated 
this way are not necessarily maximal codes. One family of important product 
codes are the Gold codes. 
 
6.7.1 Gold Codes 
 
Gold colds are product codes made from two maximal sequences of the same 
length. Certain m-sequences, when offset and linearly combined, generate another 
m-sequence. Such m-sequences are called preferred pairs. Preferred pair Gold 
codes have three-valued cross correlations as shown in Table 6.7 [8], and these 
three values occur at the frequency indicated in the fourth column. 
 
Fold codes have some very desirable correlation properties. Gold codes can be 
generated by initially loading one of the LFSRs in Figure 6.16 with any value 
other than 0, and seeding the other shift register with any of the numbers between 
0 and 2m – 1. The resultant sequences are the Gold code sequences. Another code 
is generated by seeding the first LFSR with all 0s, and the second LFSR will 
generate the initial m-sequence. Thus, there are 2m + 1 Gold codes available 

Feedback Shift Registers and Recursive Sequences 
 
399
associated with a particular LFSR structure. Gold codes of length 1,023 (m = 10) 
are used in GPS. 
 
6.7.2 Kasami Codes 
 
Kasami codes also exhibit correlation functions with very desirable properties. In 
fact, their cross-correlations can reach the Welch lower bound in (6.26). If s 
denotes an m-sequence of degree m, then s* is derived from s by taking every rth 
bit of s. Sequence s* is sometimes denoted by s[r]. When r = 2m/2 + 1, s[r] is 
periodic with a period of 2m/2 – 1. If s[r] is repeated r times, another sequence s1 is 
obtained. When s is added to the 2m/2 – 2 cyclically shifted versions of s1, and 
including s and s1, the Kasami sequences result. The correlation function values 
for Kasami sequences are the same as for Gold codes given in Table 6.7. 
 
 
6.8 LFSR Design 
 
Galois field theory is useful for determining the taps for LRS generation. A tap is 
used in the LFSR if its coefficient i = 1 and is a 0 otherwise. These i are the 
coefficients of the generator polynomial for that LFSR:

Figure 6.17 LFSR corresponding to g6.14 = x3 + x + 1. 
In addition to being prime, a primitive polynomial must be a factor of xN  1, 
where N = 2m – 1. It is such a factor if it divides xN 1 with no remainder. The 
generator polynomial g6.17(x) is sometimes denoted as 
4.17
[4, 1]
.
g
 The LFSR 
corresponding to primitive polynomials generate m-sequences. 
 
Generator polynomial g6.17 cannot be factored, and therefore it is prime, and it 
divides x7  1 evenly because 
 
Therefore, the corresponding primitive polynomial will generate a maximal 
sequence. The sequence for g6.17 is given in Table 6.8. 
 
6.8.1 Synthesis of m-Sequence LFSRs 
 
It is possible to determine all of the LFSRs of  a  given  size  m  that will  generate   
m-sequences. From the above, it is known that the corresponding polynomials 
must divide xm + 1. It is simply necessary to factor xm + 1 to determine all its 
factors. Those factors with the same order as the specified LFSR size will 
correspond to m-sequence-generating LFSRs. For example, suppose m = 3. Then 
N = 23 – 1 = 7 and the factors of x7  1 must be found. These are

and the two factors x3  x  1 and x3  x2  1 satisfy the criteria and therefore 
corresond to LFSRs that generate m-sequences. One of these generators is shown 
in Figure 6.17. The other is shown in Figure 6.18. Table 6.9 shows the sequence 
for the LFSR in Figure 6.18. 
 
6.8.2 Other Ways to Generate m-Sequences 
 
There are other ways to generate LRSs than with LFSRs. The two that are 
mentioned here are memory-based and counter-based. Both of these methods of 
generating m-sequences can be used to generate any sequence, since they are 
totally general. 
 
6.8.2.1 Memory-Based Generator 
 
With the desired sequence stored in a memory, using a simple address generator to 
access the applicable memory location would produce the desired sequence. Such 
an architecture is shown in Figure 6.19. With the development of large memories 
on a single integrated circuit, such a configuration is very attractive from a cost 
and size point of view. The address generator could be nothing more than the 
appropriately sized counter. 
The memory could be read-only memory (ROM) or read-write memory, also 
called random access memory (RAM). The former can be packed more densely 
but is limited in flexibility. Once the ROM is programmed, the sequence cannot be 
changed until the memory is replaced. The latter type of memory provides the 
flexibility to change the sequence generated but requires more area on an 
integrated circuit chip.

Figure 6.20 Counter-based LRS generator. 
 6.8.2.2 Counter-Based Generator 
 
A simple binary counter, coupled with Boolean logic elements (AND, OR, NOT) 
can generate an arbitrary sequence. This configuration is shown in Figure 6.20 for 
a simple three-stage counter that implements an LRS. The logic for even this 
simple counter sequence generator is substantial and becomes quite complicated 
for large m. 
 
 
6.9 Applications 
 
LFSRs are used in DSSS, FHSS, and THSS AJ communication systems. While 
they, in general, are multiple-use finite state machines [9], their typical use in 
these systems is for generation of the sequence used to code the data sequence. 
Two typical examples of how this can be done are described in this section. 
 
6.9.1 FHSS 
 
The parallel output configuration could be used, for example, to select the 
frequencies in FHSS systems. The frequencies would appear to be pseudo-
randomly selected. All numbers are in such a sequence eventually, however. There 
are about 2,400 channels in the lower VHF frequency band of 30–90 MHz. To be 
able to address all of these, 12 bits are necessary because  211 = 2,048 and           
212 = 4,096. Frequency-hopping systems typically do not use every channel all the 
time but rather a selected subset called the hop set. The arrangement shown in 
Figure 6.21 could be used with such systems, where the channel mapping 
component is where the hop set is defined. In this architecture, many of the 
random m-sequence symbols would be mapped to the same RF channel.

Figure 6.21 Generation of the frequency hopping hop set with an LFSR. 
6.9.2 DSSS 
 
A DSSS data modulator can be configured with an LFSR using the serial output of 
the last stage in the register as shown in Figure 6.22. The XOR effectively 
multiplies the data sequence by the much higher bit rate LFSR sequence, thereby 
generating the DSSS chipped signal. The output of this stage is then sent to the RF 
modulator to move the signal to the appropriate frequency for transmission.

6.10 Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers 
 
While LFSRs with maximal sequences can be, and have been, used in generating 
spreading codes, they are susceptible to relative ease in determining the taps, thus 
making them vulnerable to rather casual exploitation. To address this problem, 
nonlinear feedback shift registers1 (NLFSRs) were developed whose sequences 
are considerably more difficult to determine. We will discuss them in this section. 
 
It is important to note that avoiding exploitation is not always the reason for 
spreading a signal. A good example of this is PCS and cellular phone systems that 
employ CDMA modulation. In that case, CDMA is used to facilitate spectrum 
sharing rather than avoiding exploitation. Secrecy is accomplished in other ways 
in these systems. The codes used to spread the signals for channel access are not 
only linear, but they are published in the open literature. 
 
It should be noted that a general procedure for implementing NLFSRs is, at 
the time of this writing, an ongoing research problem. Only solutions for special 
cases have been devised [10–16]. 
As was established earlier in this chapter, sequences of length 2n – 1 can 
always be obtained from an n-stage shift register by means of a feedback logic 
consisting entirely of modulo-2 additions. The number of modulo-2 unique 
configurations yielding the maximum length of 2n – 1 is given by 
(2
1) / ,
n
n


where  is Euler’s function [17]. To a first approximation, the number of linear 
configurations yielding maximum length is 2n / n. Sometimes a linear 
configuration for maximum length involves only two taps. 
 
The removal of the restriction that the feedback configuration be linear 
increases the number of maximum length shift register codes of degree n from less 
than 2n/n to 
1
2
2
/ 2 .
n
n

 This enormous increase in the number of maximal length 
codes makes determining the particular code in use considerably more difficult to 
ascertain, thereby making exploitation much more difficult. In spread spectrum 
applications this is a very desirable quality, especially in military settings. 
While there are several general methods available to implement NLFSRs we 
will briefly discuss three of the most common methods: 
 
 
Nonlinear combination of the outputs of two or more LFSRs, which we 
will assign the appellation nonlinear combination generators; 
 
 
Nonlinear combination of several bits from a single LFSR, which here we 
will call a nonlinear filter; 
                                                           
1 Linear logic is when the logic is comprised of only modulo-2 adders, also known as exclusive-OR 
networks. Nonlinear logic adds the other logic components (AND, OR, NAND, NOR) to the mix. Any 
Boolean function is a candidate to use for the feedback function.

6.10.1 Nonlinear Combination Generators 
 
A nonlinear combination generator uses several maximum-length LFSRs. The 
sequence is generated as a nonlinear Boolean function f of the outputs of these 
LFSRs. The function f is called the combining function. If n maximum-length 
LFSRs with lengths 11, l2, …, ln (in general

where a0, a1, … are the coefficients (

in the algebraic normal form of f. 
Thus, it is desirable to use a combining function with a high nonlinear order. 
Several feedback shift registers operate in parallel and their output is combined 
using a suitable function f (see Figure 6.23).  
 
6.10.2 Nonlinear Filter Generators 
 
Another way to implement NLFSRs is to use a nonlinear filtering function f with 
one output and n inputs, which uses a single maximum-length LFSR (see Figure 

Feedback Shift Registers and Recursive Sequences 
 
407
 
Figure 6.24 Nonlinear filter. The notation is opposite what is normally used with LFSRs (n – 1)st stage
as the output, (zeroth stage as the input) by tradition. 
6.24), where n is the number of stages in the LFSR. This configuration is also 
known as the Fibonacci NLFSR [18]. When less than all of the n (say, k) stages are 
used as inputs for the feedback function it is called an (n, k) NLFSR [19].  
A nonlinear filter generator uses a single maximum-length LFSR, and the 
sequence is generated as a nonlinear function f of the state of the LFSR. The 
function f is called the filtering (or feedback) function. If the LFSR has length n 
and f has a nonlinear order m, the linear complexity is at most

Note the two fundamental differences between the nonlinear combination 
generator and the nonlinear filter generator: 
 
 
In the former the SRs are LFSRs and the nonlinear output function is 
determined by the output stage of these registers. 
 
In the latter the feedback function of a single SR is where the 
nonlinear function is placed. 
 
6.10.3 Variable Clock 
 
There is another way to remove the linearity property from LFSRs. That is to vary 
the clock rate. This can be accomplished by having one LFSR control the clock 
rate of one or more other LFSR. This is illustrated in Figure 6.25 [17]. In this case, 
LFSR0 controls whether LFSR1 or LFSR2 is clocked. The outputs of LFSR1 and 
LFSR2 are XORed and the resulting output is thus randomized. When the receiver 
contains this same module, is synchronized, and is loaded with the same initial 
seed, the receiver will recover the sequence and will despread the signal.

6.11 Concluding Remarks 
 
This chapter presented a very brief introduction to FSRs and their properties. Also 
presented were some of the useful characteristics of the FSR that such devices 
generate. These characteristics are exploited in spread spectrum communication 
systems, primarily to generate the codes used to spread the data. 
 
It should be noted that linear shift registers are fairly easy to exploit, given a 
sequence of the code. Nonlinear shift registers are much more difficult and 
therefore are more prolific. Nonlinear registers were only briefly discussed in this 
chapter, as it is intended to be an introduction and/or review of shift registers. For 
those interested in pursuing the nonlinear shift register theory further, [10] is an 
excellent reference. 
 
The characteristics of FSRs are based on Galois field mathematical theory, 
and in particular GF(2m), the extension field of the prime number 2, consisting of 
m-tuples of binary digits.

Synchronization and Tracking in Spread 
Spectrum Systems 
 
 
7.1 Introduction 
 
All forms of SS communication systems considered here have the requirement to 
keep the transmitter and receiver synchronized. Synchronization of frequency, 
chip time, and code are necessary. These variables are generally initially unknown. 
Furthermore, Doppler shifts in frequency due to motion of the transmitter, 
receiver, or both frequently occur. Other frequency offsets are due to drifting of 
the transmitter and receiver oscillators. The initial acquisition of the correct chip 
time and phase offset is referred to as coarse acquisition. The subsequent tracking, 
once coarse acquisition has been achieved, is sometimes referred to as fine 
acquisition. Both terms will be used herein. 
 
Coarse code acquisition consists of searching the time/frequency space 
illustrated in Figure 7.1. Each combination of phase offsets and frequency is called 
a cell. In general, both the time and frequency dimensions must be searched for 
coarse acquisition. In many practical cases, however, one of these can be readily 
estimated, and the searching is only needed over the other dimension. In DSSS, for 
example, coarse acquisition attempts to adjust the phase offset of the locally 
generated pseudo-random sequence to within a large fraction of one chip time, Tc. 
In DSSS the carrier frequency is generally known in advance. Tracking in DSSS 
attempts to keep the phase offset within a small percentage of Tc so that correlation 
can be maintained. For FHSS, coarse acquisition consists of finding where in the 
hop sequence the system is at, although maintaining the correct timing is also 
important. 
 
In general, the methods to acquire synchronization and facilitate tracking are 
different, depending on whether the communication system is employing DSSS or 
FHSS. In this chapter, DSSS acquisition and tracking will be discussed first, 
followed by that for FHSS.

7.2 DSSS Synchronization 
 
DSSS systems use coding to generate the spreading sequence. If the transmitted 
code and the locally generated code at the receiver are not synchronized, then the 
data bits will not be decoded properly. The sequences must be well within a bit 
duration to function [1, 2]. 
 
We consider in this section two types of synchronizations and one type of 
tracking, since the latter has few variations. For synchronization, we first must 
accomplish blind chip timing synchronization. This lines up the chip transition 
times among all the incoming CDMA signals so asynchronous DSSS systems 
become synchronous. Second is synchronization of the codes of the received 
signal and the locally generated signal 
 
Consider the simple case illustrated in Figure 7.2. We have represented the 
code in the received signal as a single 1 and all the rest as zeros. The known local 
code is shown at the bottom and it exhibits both timing offset and code offset. It 
also has a single 1 and all the rest are zero. Note that in the cooperating 
(communicating) case, the code is known. In the noncooperating (EW) case, the 
code may not be known, so a search for the code may also be required. Searching 
for these offsets and potentially codes is frequently done at least partially in 
parallel.

7.2.1 DSSS Code Synchronization 
 
Many coarse acquisition methods are based on the block diagram shown in Figure 
7.3. The received signal is multiplied by the locally generated pseudo-random 
sequence at some phase offset, which is estimated. If the offset corresponds to the 
same offset in the received signal, then the signal at the output of the mixer will be 
the narrowband data signal generated at the transmitter. Significant energy will 
emerge from the bandpass filter and be subsequently detected by the energy 
detector. The energy will exceed the properly selected threshold and coarse 
acquisition will have been achieved. The receiver will then engage the fine 
acquisition/tracking mode. 
 
If the locally generated phase offset does not coincide with the offset of the 
received signal, the output of the mixer will still be a wideband signal and little 
energy will pass through the bandpass filter. The energy detected will then be low 
and not exceed the threshold. In that case, the phase will be adjusted forward or 
backward by some mechanism. This is usually accomplished by skipping one chip 
period of the clock driving the generator. This process will proceed until the 
correct phase offset is found. It is generally not necessary to search the entire 
phase offset space because it is typically known or can be estimated what the 
maximum offset is due to other considerations, for example, the length of time the 
local oscillator could have drifted or the deployment geometry. 
 
There are several forms of energy detectors that can be used in Figure 7.2. 
Matched filters and radiometers are two of them. The matched filter will be 
analyzed in detail here [3]. The radiometer was examined in Chapter 2. 
 
 
Figure 7.2 There are two types of offsets associated with DSSS synchronization—both are shown 
here. The first involves a timing offset, while the second is due to a code offset.

7.2.1.1 Matched Filter 
 
A matched filter combines the implementation of the bandpass filter with the 
energy detector in Figure 7.3. Matched filters can be implemented either in analog 
or digital form. An extensive and thorough treatment of digital matched filter 
performance is provided by Turin [4]. For convenience it is assumed that the 
DSSS signal is BPSK. Extension to higher forms of PSK is straightforward.

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is a graphical representation of Pd 
plotted versus Pfa. Any stochastic signal detector has an associated ROC curve, 
and, in general, they are different depending on the type of detector. Of course, the 
matched filter is the optimum detector structure when the noise in question is 
Gaussian. An example of such a curve is shown in Figure 7.4 for the matched filter 
for a few typical valuse of the time-bandwidth product TWss when the signal-to-
noise ratio,  = –20 dB.

7.2.1.2 Code Acquisition 
 
Irrespective of the code used, the code space must be searched in some fashion to 
find the correct phase offset. There are several ways to accomplish this. The 
simplest is a serial approach where one phase offset at a time is attempted and the 
comparison with the threshold is made. If the sequence length, N, is large, 
however, this approach can be very slow if bounds on the search space are not 
available.  
On the other hand, a fully parallel implementation is possible that would be the 
fastest way. In this architecture, N parallel matched filters would simultaneously 
search the code space, one offset for each matched filter. The filter with the largest 
output would correspond to the correct phase offset. If N is large, implementation 
would be prohibitive, however. 
Between these two approaches, fully serial and fully parallel, there are 
compromises that can be made. Instead of a fully parallel implementation, for 
example, some smaller number of parallel matched filters could be included and 
they would be time shared. 
One technique that is reasonably efficient from both an acquistion time point 
of view and hardware complexity is the multidwell approach, shown in Figure 7.5 
[6]. The first energy detector implements a relatively low threshold with a short 
integration time. Its purpose is to quickly eliminate offsets that are not acceptable. 
This stage would have a relatively high false alarm rate but a corresponding high 
probability of detection. The parameters for the second energy detector would be

selected to implement a low false alarm rate and a low probability of miss (higher 
probability of detection), and therefore a longer acquisition time. The goal is to 
have the first stage hand off to the second infrequently so that the overall 
acquisition time is minimized. 
 
Acquisition Time 
 
A figure of merit for any DSSS signal acquisition approach is the average time it 
takes to achieve synchronization. This time is a random variable because of the 
underlying randomness in the pseudo-random codes. A transmission can occur at 
any time. Synchronization, however, is a function of the receiver. The receiver 
must find where the code is in the PN sequence to synchronize with it. Because of 
this random nature of the acquisition time, it can only be described statistically 
with moments and distribution functions. 
 
The least desirable situation is false synchronization, also called false alarm or 
false lock. When this occurs, the receiver thinks it is synchronized when it is not, 
so it incorrectly decodes the incoming signal, generating bad or no data until 
synchronization is again attempted. 
 
Serial searching is the most common form of DSSS search method. The 
average acquisition time for serial search is given by [7]

Barker Codes 
 
Barker codes are useful in spread spectrum systems for synchronization. They 
form a set of PN codes that is very small with short periods, the longest sequence 
having 13 bits. The code words are shown in Table 7.1. 
 
The autocorrelation of the Barker 7 sequence is illustrated in Figure 7.6. It is 
typical of the Barker correlation functions in that the value of the correlation 
function is one of –1, 0, 1, or N, with N only occuring for 0 offset.

These functions are normally used in a ―one-shot‖ fashion in that they are sent 
through the correlator only once. They are used at system initialization where the 
Barker correlator looks for the sequence before any data is added to the chip 
sequence. In that way, accidentally sending the sequence during data transmission 
can be avoided because the chip sequence can be controlled. 
 
7.2.2 Chip Timing Synchronization 
 
Many of the algorithms discussed in the sequel assume that the CDMA 
communication system is operating in a synchronous mode. This is synonymous 
with saying that the relative timing between all the terminals are all known.  
 
To address this issue, a method was devised by Strom et al. to essentially 
synchronize CDMA systems [8]. Albeit this method was for the purpose of 
communication system synchronization, it also applies to synchronization at an 
EW system attempting to intercept CDMA signals. We discuss the technique in 
this section. 
The standard method of code acquisition (initial propagation delay estimation, 
typically before data transmission) is the sliding correlator and modifications 
thereof [9]. Just like the standard detector, these methods are single-user 
algorithms and work reasonably well in a multiuser environment if the received 
powers are similar, but fail in a near-far environment [10, 11]. Another approach 
to code acquisition is to transmit a known bit sequence during acquisition, but 
these cannot be used for tracking (propagation delay estimation during data 
transmission). 
Strom et al. dealt with the full problem, that is, simultaneous estimation of the 
propagation delay, phase, and amplitude for all users in a DS-CDMA system. 
Most of the algorithms proposed, however, dealt with a propagation delay 
estimation. Obtaining accurate propagation delay estimates is a difficult problem 
and there exist a multitude of algorithms for (suboptimally) estimating the 
remaining parameters given reliable estimates of the propagation delays. 
Furthermore, no knowledge of the data sequences is required by the proposed 
algorithms. This means that the algorithms are applicable to both the acquisition 
and tracking problems.  
 
7.2.2.1 Target Signal Model 
 
The system under consideration is modeled as an asynchronous K-user DS-CDMA 
system operating over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel (as 
mentioned in Chapter 2, in the frequency range of the UMTS systems, this is a 
reasonable assumption since the fractional bandwidth is low). The modulation 
scheme is BPSK with bit duration T and chip duration Tc = T/N, where N is an 
integer. The code waveforms are assumed to be periodic with period T. As a 

Synchronization and Tracking in Spread Spectrum Systems

general rule, a subscript l implies that the subscripted quantity is due to the lth 
user. For instance, a period of the lth user's code waveform is denoted by bl(t), 
where bl(t) = 0 for

7.2.2.3 Estimation Algorithms 
 
Strom et al. [8] proposed four algorithms for estimating the parameter vector: an 
ML estimator, an approximate ML estimator, an estimator based on MUSIC, and 
an estimator based on a sliding correlator approach. The first two are detailed here. 
Let ˆdenote an unbiased estimator of the vector of deterministic unknown

Maximum Likelihood 
 
The first algorithm is a maximum likelihood estimator where the log-likelihood 
function (7.41) is maximized over 
.
 As seen from (7.41), the optimization 
problem is separable with respect to 2. That is, we can fix 2 and maximize the 
log-likelihood function with respect to , ,
and .  
Maximizing the log-likelihood function is equivalent to minimizing the 
negative log-likelihood function. Thus, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates

simultaneously. It is important to realize that the log-likelihood function is 
conditioned on ,z which, in turn, is defined by the transmitted bits from all users. 
Therefore, in order to use the maximum-likelihood algorithm as stated in (7.42) 
we need to maximize (7.42) for all possible bit sequences. This estimator exploits 
the full structure of the problem and will achieve the CRB. 
The maximization over z is unfortunate since this is a mixed type optimization 
problem with both continuous and discrete parameters. The problem is solvable in 
principle, but the complexity becomes overwhelming as the number of users or the 
observation interval grows. 
 
Approximate Maximum Likelihood 
 
As mentioned above, the problem with the ML estimator is that we need to test all 
possible transmitted bit sequences in order to perform a true maximum-likelihood 
estimation of the unknown parameters. However, we can make an approximation 
that in essence allows us to ―forget‖ that we have a mixed optimization problem. If 
we define

Since we are not using the full structure of s(m) we should expect (7.46) to yield 
poorer estimates than (7.42). The AML algorithm finds estimates of all the delays 
simultaneously.

. Oversampling was not used (i.e., Qc = 1). 
Each Monte Carlo run represents a particular realization of the noise and data 
sequences. Throughout all the simulations, the delays, received amplitudes and 
phases were fixed. The measure of performance is the sample standard deviation, 
std(
1ˆ). A total of 500 Monte Carlo runs were done for each simulation. The 
absolute performance of the timing estimators (in terms of standard deviation) is, 
of course, dependent on the particular  for which the simulations were done. 
However, the relative performance of the estimators proved to be roughly 
independent of the delays.  
The near-far ratio is defined as R2 / R1, where all interfering users had the 
same received power, Rl = R2 for l = 3, 4, …, 7. The Cramer-Rao bound serves as 
a lower bound on the standard deviation. For our simulated case, the actual CRB 
was very close to the asymptotic expression for an observation interval M > 20. 
Furthermore, the estimators turned out to be approximately unbiased, and hence 
the sample standard deviation is an appropriate measure of performance.  
Since we are searching for the global minimum, we may sometimes find an 
estimate that is more than one chip duration away from the true delay. Such an 
estimate is called an outlier and was excluded from the data before the standard 
deviation was calculated. This was done in order to make the comparison with the 
CRB meaningful. An outlier error is, of course, disastrous in the acquisition phase; 
however, in the tracking phase, we will probably limit the search of the cost 
function to be in the vicinity (say, 
c / 2
T

) of the previous estimate. This is 
reasonable since the propagation delays typically are slowly varying.  
The relative number of outliers are listed in Table 7.2. For the MUSIC 
algorithm, the number of outliers decrease as the observation interval or SNR 

Synchronization and Tracking in Spread Spectrum Systems

increases; the outlier frequency is only weakly dependent on the near-far ratio for 
medium to high SNR and sufficiently large M. The correlator had no detected 
outliers when R2 / R1 = 0 dB and 1 = 2Eb,1 / N0 = 5, 10, 15 dB. However, for       
R2 / R1 = 20 dB, the number of outliers was high and decreased only slowly with 
M. Hence, the correlator has fewer outliers than MUSIC when we have perfect 
power control or low SNR. In case of the AML algorithm, the optimization was 
carried out by a numerical search started at the true delay. Therefore, we seldom 
encountered an outlier since we were likely to find a local minimum close to the

1ˆ as a function of the number of observed vectors for AML (x),
MUSIC (o), and correlator () for different near-far ratios. The solid line is the Cramer-Rao bound.

starting point in this case. We did not attempt to further quantify the outlier 
frequency for the AML since, as discussed below, the AML has little practical 
value for acquisition. 
In Figures 7.9 and 7.10 [8], the standard deviation is plotted as a function of 
the number of observed vectors for the AML, MUSIC, and correlator algorithms 
for near-far ratios 0 and 20 dB. Figure 7.11 shows the standard deviation for the 
estimators as a function of the near-far ratio. For both figures, the signal-to-noise 
ratio was l = 15 dB. Note that the MUSIC and AML algorithms performed 
similarly and in a near-far resistant manner. However, the correlator performance 
degraded rapidly with the near-far ratio. The CRB is seen to be invariant to the 
near-far ratio; furthermore, the CRB was not attained by any of the algorithms. 
 
 7.2.2.4 Summary and Conclusions 
 
The standard algorithm for estimating propagation delays in an asynchronous DS-
CDMA system works satisfactory when the multiuser interference is low. 
However, in a near-far situation, the performance is severely degraded. The 
structure of the asymptotic CRB indicates that it is possible to find good near-far 
resistant propagation delay estimators. The two proposed algorithms, AML and 
Figure 7.10 Same as Figure 7.9 except that the near-far ratio is 20 dB. Note the severe degradation of
the performance of the correlator when the near-far ratio is increased. (Source: [8]. © 1996 IEEE.

MUSIC, are shown to be robust against multiuser interference. Furthermore, they 
place no constraints on the data sequence and can therefore be used for tracking as 
well. Recursive formulations are also possible, which lower the computational 
complexity. The MUSIC estimates are found one by one, whereas the AML 
algorithm computes all estimates simultaneously. Obviously, if only one or a few 
propagation delays are of interest, the MUSIC algorithm is preferable since, for 
instance, it only requires knowledge of the code sequences of the users whose 
delays are to be estimated. Moreover, the AML cost function is highly nonlinear 
with many local minima and is therefore sensitive to correct initialization. Thus, 
the AML is of limited practical value for the acquisition problem. 
 
7.2.3 Non-Gaussian Noise 
 
As we pointed out in Chapter 2, over significant portions of some of the frequency 
bands of interest to us, up to about 1 GHz, in fact, the predominant external noise 
sources are not Gaussian as we have been assuming up to now. In the HF range, 
Figure 7.11 Standard deviation of 
1ˆ as a function of the near-far ratio for AML (x), MUSIC (o), and 
correlator () for different near-far ratios. The solid line is the Cramer-Rao bound. The number of 
observed vector samples is M = 100. Note that the AML and MUSIC estimators are unaffected by the 
near-far ratio while the correlator shows an increasing standard deviation as the near-far ratio is 
increased. (Source:[8] © 1996 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.)

below about 30 MHz, atmospheric noise dominates the external noise. Above that, 
from about 30 to 300 MHz, galactic noise sources (the stars) produce the largest 
average external noise. From about 300 MHz to about 1 GHz, man-made noise is 
the main culprit. It isn’t until about 1 GHz that the assumption of AWGN is valid. 
 
PTT CNRs are the predominant mode of communication in the low VHF 
range (30–90 MHz). The external noise here is predominantly galactic and man-
made. 
 
We present in the section an analysis of the effects of non-Gaussian noise [12] 
on code acquisition. Atmospheric noise is very impulsive, being caused by 
lightning. In the lower-frequency ranges (HF) signals can travel long distances due 
to the reflections off the ionosphere as discussed in Chapter 5. Being very 
powerful generators, lightning thus can be heard a long way from its point of 
origin. Typical MMN is also very impulsive in nature, being caused by mechanical 
and electrical devices that turn on and off frequently. 
We will use the observation model described in Chapter 4, but repeated here 
for convenience (with different noise characteristics, however). In a DSSS system, 
the received signal can be expressed as

We assume that there is a preamble for acquisition so that no data modulation

UMTS PCS standards all have a code acquisition scheme that can be modeled this 
way. 
A typical structure of a PN code acquisition module with a noncoherent I-Q

7.2.4 Code Synchronization for Band-Limited DSSS Systems 
 
Benedetto and Giunta documented the results of a development that determines the 
phase offsets of asynchronous CDMA signals when the communication channels 
and therefore the digital signals are band-limited [15]. Most analyses of DSSS 
systems and technologies assume that the PN code sequence consists of 
rectangular pulses, where in reality they never are. Truly rectangular pulses at the 
receiver implies that there is infinite bandwidth over which the signal travels. This 

Synchronization and Tracking in Spread Spectrum Systems 
 
439
is never the case, and band-limiting tends to round the corners of the pulses, 
sometimes severely. We will briefly describe the approach in this section. 
Most asynchronous CDMA systems need to search for the timing (phase) 
offset of the PN code sequence in order to align the signals. The codes used in 
CDMA systems are only truly orthogonal when they are aligned in phase. Such 
systems employ a type of detection system that typically looks like the one in 
Figure 7.12. The incoming signal is first amplified and filtered (not shown) and 
then applied to a detector. The detector typically is a demodulator, in our case 
normally a correlator, and the results of correlating the incoming signal with a 
locally generated version of the code are applied to a threshold comparing device. 
If the correlation results are above a threshold (normally set by the amount of false 
alarms permitted), decision logic is employed as described above. The resulting 
decision is declared that the correct phase offset is present (H1) if the correlation is 
above a threshold or declared that the phase offset incorrect (H0) if the comparison 
is small. If the signal is declared present, then the receiver enters the tracking 
mode; if not, the search is repeated with the next candidate phase offset.  
 
7.2.4.1 Receiver Model

filter is depicted in Figure 7.14 [19] where the I and Q samples at time k, 
I

Q,

chip waveform, with raised-cosine spectrum and roll-off , and defined as

Now consider N samples of the complex envelope of the received signal after 
the matched filter {r(kTc / 2 − τTc), k = 1,...N}, with the normalized timing offset τ, 
being τ = 0 in the chip-synchronous case while randomly distributed over         
−0.5 ≤ τ ≤ 0.5 in the chip-asynchronous case, being independent of the sampling 
times (either integer or half-integer multiples of the chip period Tc) [9]. 
The power detector first estimates the cross-correlation ρw(τ) between r(t) and 
the code candidate c(t), shifted by (kTc / 2 + Tc), where  is the normalized local 
PN code delay and is assumed to be an integer [15]:

We use a parabolic interpolation to approximate the ambiguity function 
because we are dealing with band-limited signals. Unlike rectangular chips, the 
auto-correlation functions of band-limited chip waveforms (such as the ones with 
square-root raised-cosine spectrum) are well matched by parabolic functions in the 
neighborhood of its maximum, according to their Taylor’s expansion truncated up 
to the second order [15].  
 
7.2.4.3 Performance 
 
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the new acquisition method based 
on the parabolic interpolation in this section. We need to point out that, in real 
cases, the algorithm considers as possible candidates the only testing variables for 
which z is greater than x and y simultaneously. 
The best-case results are illustrated in Figure 7.15. The best case is defined in 
Figure 7.16(a); it is where the timing offset  = 0. The worst case performance, 
defined in Figure 7.16(b), is illustrated in Figure 7.17. The worst case is when the 
timing offset is  = Tc/4. We can see that the power test is affected somewhat more 
by the timing offset. However, it is also clear that the interpolation test procedure 
performs about as well as the power test. 
 
 
7.3 DSSS Tracking 
 
Tracking DSSS signals is the process of keeping the receiver’s locally generated 
code sequence in phase with the incoming code sequence. This is necessary for the 
receiver to correctly decorrelate the signal to extract the data. It also spreads any 
interfering signals, although proper synchronization is not necessary to accomplish

that. While there are numerous techniques for implementing DSSS tracking, most 
are based on the delay lock loop (DLL). 
The DLL relies on the theoretical triangular shape of the correlation function 
of m-sequences. An example of such architecture is shown in Figure 7.18. The 
locally generated code sequence is sent to a three-stage shift register. The last 
stage, which represents a delay of three chips in the sequence, is the late code. The 
code sequence from the middle stage is used to decorrelate the incoming signal, 
and the sequence from the first stage is the early code. The incoming code 
sequence is modulo-2 added to the early local PN sequence in the upper path of 
Figure 7.18(a). If they are synchronized then the correlation function shown at the 
top of Figure 7.18(b) is generated by the early correlator. The incoming code 
sequence is modulo-2 added to the late local code sequence in the late correlator in 
Figure 7.18(a). The correlation function shown in the middle of Figure 7.18(b) is 
implemented through this path.  
The difference in the two correlation functions, when in sync, is shown at the 
bottom of Figure 7.18(b), and there is a balance point that always occurs at a fixed 
point in time after a chip starts. If this point occurs at some other time, depending 
on which side of the in-sync point it occurs, it indicates that the clock should be 
delayed or advanced. 
 
Another example of a correlator that would work in this architecture is shown 
in Figure 7.19. This is a straightforward parallel implementation of a correlator 
with shift registers and exclusive ORs.

7.4 FHSS Synchronization 
 
This section presents discussions of synchronization of FHSS AJ communication 
systems. The basic principles are similar to those for DSSS, however, the details 
are different. We examine three techniques for coarse acquisition of FHSS signals. 
This discussion follows that in [16] closely. 
If an FHSS network fails to synchronize, it cannot communicate. A jammer 
can try to attack the synchronization process, but it must know when 
synchronization is occurring to be successful. As will be shown, however, such 
attacks can be very productive. 
 
The environment in which these techniques are compared consists of push-to-
talk networks for which there may be extended periods of no communications. In 
this time, the clocks in the transmitter and receiver may have drifted apart, thus 
causing the PN codes to be out of sync. Therefore, before each transmission the 
transmitter and receiver are synchronized. 
Although, in general, a two-dimensional search is required over both frequency 
and code, in this analysis the frequency search will be ignored. In many cases of 
practical interest, such as ground-deployed PTT communication networks, this is a 
safe assumption. It may not be a safe assumption for high-velocity aircraft 
communications. 
With this technique, a leader is transmitted prior to sending any data from the 
transmitter to the receiver. This leader is comprised of several passes through the 
hop set with a known data sequence attached. In general, if the synchronization 
search fails on the first pass through the search space, additional passes can be 
attempted, although normally rapid synchronization is required to maximize the 
data throughput. The number of hops in the synchronization sequence here is 
denoted H. The received signal during the kth hopping interval of the 
synchronization process can be expressed as

approximate noise bandwidth. For comparative analysis of the three approaches 
analyzed, the sum of the powers in the specular (direct) component and scatter 
(reflections) component to an average power over all the hops are assigned as R. 
The factor ai accounts for the effects of the random amplitude fluctuations in the 
specular component in the Ricean channel model. The cj factors account for the 
random fluctuations in the reflected components and there are several of them, 
indexed by j. Thus,

Thus, is averaged over H hops and b is summed over several multipath channels. 
 
The number of channels available to the FHSS system is denoted by F and it 
is assumed that h of these contain interfering tones, all of which have power equal 
to that of the intended signal, independent of each other, and with uniform random 
phases. While these are gross assumptions for cochannel interference, they do 
facilitate an approximate analysis of the effects of interfering signals. Furthermore, 
they are very good assumptions when the interference emanates from a multitone 
jammer discussed in Chapter 8. 
Since the probability that no interfering signal is present in a frequency 
channel during a single hop is (1 – 1/F)h, then the probability that at least one of

7.4.1 Matched Filter 
 
The first technique for FHSS code synchronization employs a matched filter 
shown in Figure 7.20. H matched filters are implemented in parallel. The detector 
is normally implemented at each of H successive frequencies, but, in fact, they 
need not  be  sequential if  the delays  are  correctly  selected. The output  of these  
detectors are delayed appropriately from 1 to H hop intervals, and the outputs of 
the delays are added. If this sum is above threshold, then sync lock is declared. In 
this case the probability of false lock is given by (7.88) and the probability of 
missing synchronization is given by (7.90) with H = P and = 
1
th
γ
.  
This method of synchronization is faster than the serial search technique 
discussed next, but the probability of false lock is higher. The matched filter 
method, since several parallel channels are working at the same time, requires 
substantially more components than the serial search scheme.  The performance of 
the matched filter code acquisition system with h = 5 interfering signals are shown 
in Figure 7.21 for some representative values of the parameters. For this there 
were no jammers considered, but the interfering signals from other transmitters 
were at the same level as the signal (ISR = 0 dB). Pfa varies with the SNR, but the 
threshold was varied to keep it near 10–4. 
The average time to achieve sync is given by

7.4.2 Serial Search 
 
The second technique employs an active correlator for serial search. Such a 
correlator is shown in Figure 7.22. The integration time is set at an integer number 
of hop intervals, Ts = HTh. If the receiver is in sync with the incoming signal, then 
all  H hops  periods  will  contribute  to  the  test statistic z. When z rises above the  
threshold level, sync lock is declared. If some of the receiver hop frequencies do 
not coincide with the incoming hop sequence, then during those periods with no 
match, the output of the squaring envelope detector will be due to noise only. If a 
sufficient number of hops do not match, then z will not be above the threshold and 
the control will hold back the clock for one period, thus slipping the code sequence 
by one chip. This process is repeated until the correct code phase is found. 
 
Generally, declaring synchronization on a single successful attempt will yield 
poor results and too many false locks. Typically, m sequential successful 
synchronization indications are needed.  For stepped serial synchronization the 
probability of false hit on a single attempt is given by (7.88) with H = A and

Note that the receiver knows the hop sequence (code), but does not know 
where in the sequence the incoming signal is located within that sequence. A 
typical hop set would be comprised of, say, 256 frequencies, so a search over 256 
hop intervals should suffice to find where the sequence is in its pattern. 
 
The serial search scheme is slow but it has a high probability of finding the 
code sequence. That is, the probability of false lock is low. In the noise-free case, 
it is guaranteed to find the correct code location. 
The probability of missed sync for the serial search technique assuming m = 2 
sequential hits are required is illustrated in Figure 7.23. As for matched filtering, 
the thresholds were adjusted to keep Pfa  10–4.

7.4.3 Two-Step Synchronization 
 
Because of the sporadic characteristics of PTT communication, rapid and accurate 
techniques are required to facilitate resynchronization upon every transmission 
event. That is the motivation for the third form of FHSS code synchronization 
approach discussed here. 
 
This two-level code synchronization approach was first analyzed by 
Rappaport and Schilling [6]. This is a combination of the serial search and 
matched filter. A block diagram of the approach is shown in Figure 7.24. The 
leader transmits a short segment of H hop frequencies. The first stage is comprised 
of a passive correlator (matched filter), the output of which, if above threshold

, triggers the second stage, which is a bank of active correlator detectors. The 
matched filter is designed to search P of the H frequencies in this sync prefix. 
When the match filter exceeds its threshold, it is an indication that a possible sync 
prefix has been detected. In that case one of the c active correlators is started (if 
one is available) to look for the remainder A (P + A = H) of the hop set. At the end 
of the H hops, if the active correlator has detected enough of the hops, its output 
will exceed the second threshold indicating that sync lock has been achieved. If it 
does not exceed the second threshold then that correlator is made available to the 
pool for subsequent assignment by the matched filter. If there is no available 
active correlator when the first step indicates the presence of the sync prefix, then 
that notification is ignored. 
There are P passive matched filters in the first stage and A active correlators in 
the second. The relatively low reliability but fast performance of the matched filter 
is used to presort through the possible code offsets before the time-consuming, but 
high reliability, active correlator technique is employed. The rationale for such an 
approach is that the passive scheme is fast but hardware-intense, whereas the 
active scheme is slower but hardware light. The effect of interfering signals and 
jamming tones is essentially to increase the number of false detections in the first 
step of the two-step process. This increases the load on the correlators for the 
second step, increasing the blocking probability. It also, however, increases the 
probability of correctly detecting the beginning of a correct synchronization 
sequence. The false detection and false dismissal probabilities are given by (7.88)

 The Erlang blocking formula (7.96) reflects the likelihood of a call 
getting blocked in a phone system, assuming the call attempts arrive according to a 
random process characterized by the Poisson distribution, and is used here as an 
indication of whether an active correlator is available. In this formula, c represents 
the number of processing assets available and a represents the rate at which these 
assets are tasked to perform a function. 
 
Equation (7.95) is illustrated in Figure 7.25 for the two-step code acquisition 
process for several values of c. Note that the curves turn upward as the SNR 
increases past some point for c < 7. This is because the Erlang blocking 
probabilities increase as the SNR increases. It is ameliorated as the number of 
second-stage correlators increases, and for c  7 for this example and for the 
ranges displayed the characteristic disappears. Although the false alarm 
probability varies with the SNR, the threshold values were adjusted for these 
curves to make Pfa approximately 10–5 at  = 0 dB.

7.4.4 Comparison of Mean Acquisition Times 
 
The mean acquisition times for the serial search (active correlator) and the 
matched filter (passive correlator) are shown in Figure 7.26. Clearly, the passive 
approach is much faster than the active approach by a considerable amount for 
reasonable sizes of the correlators. The active approach may require many 
seconds. This chart assumes that m = 1, Nc = 20 for a 100-hps FHSS system. 
 
Similar data for the two-level approach is shown in Figure 7.27. Relying on 
the presorting possible with the matched filter significantly shortens the code 
acquisition time. These times are short enough to facilitate PTT communications. 
 
 
7.5 FHSS Tracking 
 
Just as for DSSS, after coarse acquisition establishes code synchronization to 
within a single dwell time or code symbol, handoff to the tracking mode occurs. 
Coarse acquisition establishes this synchronization to typically half to one-quarter 
of a chip interval. The tracking function is to maintain the code synchronization to 
within a small fraction of a single chip. 
 
There are two goals of the tracking circuit. The first is to maintain code 
synchronization. In addition to this, if the coarse synchronization has established a 
track incorrectly, the second goal of the tracking function is to recognize this and 
return to coarse synchronization as quickly as possible. 
 
Perhaps the most common architecture for FHSS tracking is based on the 
early-late gate. That will be described here. 
 
Figure 7.26 Comparison of the mean synchronization acquisition times for active and passive 
correlators.

7.5.1 Early-Late Gate Tracking 
 
One implementation of an early-late tracking gate is shown in Figure 7.28. When 
the receiver is perfectly synchronized to the incoming chip signal, the early and 
late gates, which are of duration Tc/2 each, occupy the first half and last half of the 
chip duration, respectively, as shown in Figure 7.28(b). When synchronized, the 
output of the early gate integrator increases to a fixed level during the first half, 
and that level is maintained during the second half. During the second half of the 
chip duration, the late integrator also rises to that same level. At the end of the 
chip, the two integrator outputs are compared (by subtraction in this case) and the 
output will be 0 V. This output is sent to a voltage-controlled clock, which slows 
the clock rate with a positive input voltage and increases the rate for a negative 
input. 
 
If the receiver is early (the gates occur too early compared to the chip), then at 
the end of the chip duration, there is a negative value out of the comparator as 
shown in Figure 7.28(c), indicating to the voltage controlled clock to shift later in 
time. If the receiver is too late, then at the end of the chip there is a remaining 
positive value out of the comparator as shown in Figure 7.28(d), indicating to the 
clock to adjust the time so the early and late gates occur earlier. 
This description assumed that the chip was a logical 1. Additional logic is 
required to handle the case when the chip is a logical 0, but the modification is 
straightforward. This architecture, then, can be used to move the timing of the 
locally generated pseudo-random sequence back and forth within the duration of a 
chip.  
 
There is always some residual phase jitter in the early-late tracking loop due 
to the uncertainty in clocks matching in the transmitter and receiver. The variance 
of this jitter is given by [6]

As explained in [6], the tracking loop phase jitter will reduce the correlation 
peak because the correlation is not perfect. Assuming that the phase jitter is

peak is reduced by a factor d given by

There are a wide variety of control processes that can be implemented. Recall 
that one of the goals of tracking is to return to coarse synchronization as quickly as 
possible when that function has incorrectly established what it thought was 
synchronization. The architecture of the control system for the tracking loop 
establishes the performance of the loop. 
One possibility is to return to coarse acquisition when a single miss in the 
tracking loop is detected. This is perhaps the fastest way to correct incorrect coarse 
synchronization, but will also lead to a higher level of correct tracking being 
rejected. It is also possible to have m out of n type of control, where m < n 
detections of sync-loss out of n passes are required before returning to coarse 
synchronization. A refinement of this second approach could be to return to m = 0

upon any detection of correct tracking. For this last approach, the mean time to

When q = Pm, then TL is the mean time to loss of synchronization for this 
approach, also known as the mean hold time (TH), when the code epoch has been 
correctly determined. When q = 1 – Pfa, the mean hold time for when the code 
epoch is not established is given, also known as mean time for false lock (Tfl). 
 
The same Ricean fading model, as described previously by (7.82), was used to 
describe the signal propagation environment. The normalized mean hold time is 
shown in Figure 7.30 (normalized by the chip time) performance versus the chip 
energy SNR when there are neither interferers nor tone jammers. The parameter n 
is the number of times the tracking detector must detect loss of sync before 
returning to the coarse acquisition process. For example, for an SNR of 5 dB and

mean false lock time. For these example parameters, the recovery time from a 
false lock condition is essentially instantaneous. For example, when                 
log10 TFL / Tc = 2, TFL = 0.01 second and for this value of the abscissa and n = 2, 
log10 TH / Tc  106 second.

The normalized mean false hold time is illustrated in Figure 7.32 versus the 
relative strength of the scattered signals at the receiver, as expressed by B. As 
more power shifts into the reflected components from the direct component (B 
increases), the hold time tends to approach asymptotic values for each n. Likewise, 
for small amounts of power in the scattering components, the hold time decreases 
relatively rapidly as B increases.  
The normalized mean hold time is shown in Figure 7.33 versus the number of 
other users of the spectrum as heard by the receiver. As opposed to coarse 
acquisition, where interfering signals have a profound impact on synchronization, 
the hold time is not particularly sensitive to the number of potential interfering 
users for the parameters indicated. The effects of interfering signals on coarse 
acquisition are discussed earlier.

The fundamental properties of synchronization and tracking in DSSS and FHSS 
systems are presented in this chapter. PN code synchronization and tracking are

requirements of all AJ systems. Synchronization is the process of initially 
determining where in the PN sequence the received signal is located. Once this is 
established, handoff to the tracking function is accomplished. The tracking 
function attempts to keep the receiver PN code generator within a small fraction of 
a chip time. 
This discussion is included here to establish the baseline for effective jamming 
techniques against these functions to be discussed next in Chapter 8.

Jamming Techniques 
 
 
8.1 Introduction 
 
In this chapter we discuss types of jamming strategies that a jammer could use 
against AJ targets. The coverage is not all-inclusive, but most of the more common 
approaches are presented. A jammer can use several possible strategies—each has 
its own advantages and disadvantages and may be the ―best‖ strategy against a 
particular set of targets.  
First, noise jamming is presented. Within this category are wideband noise, 
partial-band noise, and narrowband noise. The first two could apply to a nonagile 
jammer where the jamming signals occupy a portion of or the entire spectrum in 
use by the AJ system, but the signals stay in one place in the spectrum. The 
narrowband noise case is associated with follower jamming where attempts to 
follow a frequency-hopping AJ target are made. If the signal can be correctly 
found quickly enough then jamming energy can be applied and communication 
denial can be attempted at the new frequency. 
Next tone jamming is discussed. Tone jammers can be applied to both DSSS 
and FHSS AJ signals. A single tone can be used against DSSS or FHSS when the 
latter is attempted with the follower strategy. Multiple tones can be applied to both 
types of AJ signals as well. Multiple-tone jamming is also referred to as multitone, 
or MT, here. 
Swept jamming is presented next, which takes one of the basic techniques and 
scans the waveform across all or a significant portion of the spectrum of interest. 
This sweeping can be accomplished with analog ―scanning‖ exciters or digital 
―stepping‖ exciters. In the former case the jamming waveform is only at a given 
channel for an ―instant.‖ In the latter, the jamming signal can dwell at a channel 
for arbitrary (and mixed) times. 
Pulse jamming is the appellation applied to intermittently transmitting high- 
power energy. It is the DSSS analog to partial-band noise jamming against FHSS 
AJ signals and the results are similar.

The last jamming technique presented is smart jamming, where particular parts 
of a signal are targeted. Much must be known about the particular target signal to 
apply this technique. The ability to synchronize the jamming waveform with the 
target signal is also required with smart jamming. This problem is exacerbated by, 
typically, the flight time of the jamming signal, which is difficult to predict. The 
jamming signal must be synchronized with the target signal at the target receiver. 
The chapter concludes with a discussion of jam-to-signal ratio (JSR) 
calculations with the models presented in Section 2.1. The JSR is the parameter 
that indicates whether jamming is effective. The required JSR depends on the 
particular type of signal being considered. When referring to JSRs herein, it is 
implicitly meant to refer to these signal levels at the target receiver. Occasionally, 
to reinforce this point, the received jammer power will be referred to as J to 
distinguish it from the jammer ERP at the transmitter, denoted as JT here and 
previously. S and R are only used to refer to the average signal power at the 
receiver depending on whether the signal is specified as s(t) or r(t), while PT refers 
to the target net transmitter ERP. 
 
 
8.2 Jamming Strategies 
 
It has been shown that jamming approximately 30% or more of a voice 
transmission degrades the intelligibility significantly enough to deny an effective 
transfer of information [1]. Therefore, denying 30% of transmissions represents a 
reasonable goal to strive for and serves as a useful threshold to achieve for such 
communications. Jamming of substantially less than 30% is effective against 
coded or uncoded digital data communications, as will be shown. Jamming 
effectiveness criteria for digital communications will be substantially different 
from that for analog, voice communications. All important SS communication 
systems utilize digital signaling techniques. 
There are several possible strategies that a jammer can employ against a 
communication system to include AJ systems. Some techniques are more effective 
than others, and a successful strategy depends on the particular type of AJ 
employed. 
 
Two fundamental waveforms are typically used against AJ communication 
systems. A carrier signal centered on the transmitting frequency is unmodulated, 
modulated with one or more tone signals, or modulated with a noise signal. The 
bandwidth of the noise can be varied. When the carrier is not modulated, the 
jamming waveform is a single tone. When modulated with more than one tone, 
then multiple tones are emitted by the jammer. Usually, the placement of these 
tones is based on some knowledge of the target or targets to be jammed. Noise is 

Jamming Techniques 
 
469
used to raise the background noise in the spectrum in which the AJ system is 
operating. 
The taxonomy of jamming strategies consists of how the available jammer 
power is distributed with frequency, the type of modulation transmitted (if any), 
the time-sharing of the jammer among several targets, and power sharing, where 
the instantaneous power can be distributed among several targets. 
 
8.2.1 Partial Dwell Jamming of FHSS Systems 
 
When jamming FHSS systems using a follower jamming technique, only a portion 
of each dwell is jammed. There is a finite amount of time to ascertain if newly 
detected energy belongs to the correct signal to jam. It is not normally possible to 
jam the entire hop dwell at the receiver, but only a fraction of it, denoted here by . 
Likewise, when jamming using a partial-band technique, with either noise or 
multiple tones, only a portion of the dwells is jammed. The FHSS system can hop 
into a band or tone that contains a jamming signal or not, depending on the 
placement of the jamming signal and the hop sequence. 
The overall probability of jamming a dwell is given by the probability of a 
symbol error when the jammer is not present and Pe is determined by the thermal 
background noise, and probability of a symbol error when the jammer is present, 
where the BER is determined by the composite effects of the jammer energy 
combined with the thermal noise. For simplicity, in this section it is assumed that 
the FHSS system is using BFSK modulation. Extensions to higher orders of FSK 
modulation are straightforward. The probability of a bit error occurring when the 
jammer is not present is due to the background noise only and is given by (3.93)

8.2.2 Noise Jamming 
 
For noise jamming, the jamming carrier signal is modulated with a random noise 
waveform. The intent is to disrupt the AJ communication waveform by inserting 
noise into the receiver. The bandwidth of the signal can be as wide as the entire 
spectrum width used by the AJ system or much narrower, occupying only a single 
channel. The effects are different depending on the details of the implementation. 
 
The noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian, and therefore this is the type 
of noise sources designed into jamming systems. Theoretical Gaussian noise has 
an infinite frequency extent. Colored Gaussian noise is Gaussian noise that has 
been subject to filtering and is the appropriate type to use in situations where the 
filtering effects are important. 
 
8.2.2.1 Broadband Noise Jamming 
 
Broadband noise (BBN) jamming places noise energy across the entire width of 
the frequency spectrum used by the target communication systems. It is also called 
full band jamming and is sometimes called barrage jamming. This latter 
appellation, however, also refers to cases where less than the full band is jammed. 
This type of jamming is useful against all forms of AJ communications. It is 
generally useful for coverage of an area for screening purposes as well. In this EP 
role, the jammer is placed between an adversary’s ES system(s) and friendly 
communications. Directional antennas are, of course, required to be pointed in the 
direction of the ES systems if friendly fratricide is to be minimized. If used 
correctly, this prevents the adversary from intercepting friendly communications at 
least for a time. 
Since BBN jamming generates signals that are similar to broadband noise, the 
level of jamming power is sometimes referred to as J0 and is measured in 
watts/hertz just as background noise is specified. The primary limitation of BBN 
jamming is that it results in low J0 as limited jammer power is spread very wide. It 
is not as effective as partial-band jamming can be against BFSK. The spectrum of 
BBN jamming is illustrated in Figure 8.1(b). 
This type of jamming essentially raises the background (thermal) noise level at 
the receiver, creating a higher noise environment for the AJ system. Noise is the 
nemesis for any communication system and if the noise level can be increased, it 
makes it more difficult for the communication system to operate. At the very least 
it decreases the range over which the communication system is effective. In some 
cases, this effect is adequate to accomplish the goals of ECM. In other cases, 
communication can be totally denied. 
BBN jamming is a direct assault on the channel capacity of a communication 
system. This capacity, assuming the noise is Gaussian, was first investigated by 
Shannon in 1948 [2]. It expresses the maximum data rate that the channel can

(b) full-band jamming (BBN), (c) contiguous partial-band jamming (PBN), (d) noncontiguous partial-
band jamming (PBN), (e) narrowband noise jamming (NBN), (f) single-tone (ST) jamming, and (g)
multitone (MT) jamming.  
carry with an arbitrarily small error rate. If an attempt is made to transmit a digital 
signal through the channel with a higher bit rate than that given by the capacity, 
then errors are assured in the received signal. The capacity of a channel corrupted 
by such noise is given by

where Wss is the bandwidth of the signal, R is the average power of the signal, and 
PT is the total average noise present given by PT = Wss(N0 + J0). Clearly, as the 
noise level is raised by intentionally inserting Gaussian noise into the channel, the 
SNR decreases, thus decreasing the channel capacity. BBN jamming of FHSS 
systems utilizing BFSK produces the Pe given in (3.89).

BBN Jamming Effects on Synchronization 
 
PTT FHSS systems typically must maintain tracking on every transmission 
attempt. The tracking consists of aligning the time epoch of the transmitter at the 
receiver and maintaining the PN code sequence. Generally maintaining coarse 
synchronization can be accomplished by keeping the transmitter and receiver 
clocks/oscillators running even when not transmitting. The fine tracking, however, 
must be adjusted on each attempt. Tracking causes the receiver to hop to the same 
frequencies as the transmitter and ensures that these hops occur at the same time. 
If the receiver is precluded from tracking the transmitter, then communication is 
denied. The effects of BBN jamming when FHSS systems are trying to 
synchronize and track are addressed in this section. 
BBN jamming raises the background noise levels and, as such, can be used to 
attack the synchronization and tracking processes. The arguments in Section 7.4.1 
apply directly here with the higher noise level. Thus,

Matched Filter Coarse Acquisition. When the matched filter approach to achieving 
coarse acquisition is used, then (7.84) and (7.86) are used directly. The results for 
an example when  = 10 dB are shown in Figure 8.2.  
 
As noted in Chapter 4, well-designed FHSS receivers employ limiters prior to 
their detectors to eliminate excessive jamming signal energy. As seen in Figure

  0 dB. 
 
Stepped Serial Coarse Code Acquisition. Just as for matched filter jamming, the 
analysis in Section 7.4.1 applies here as well since the noise level is raised. For 
serial search code acquisition, one technique is to require that some number of 
successive hits is required before declaring that coarse synchronization has been 
achieved. Another is to require some number of hits, and with a miss, the system 
drops back one stage. This is illustrated with the finite state machine in Figure 8.3. 
When the strategy is that m consecutive hits must occur to declare 
synchronization, then

Two-Step Coarse Acquisition. When the acquisition function is split into two steps 
as described in Section 7.4.1.3, the first step is passive correlation with a matched 
filter and the second step is active correlation with a stepped serial correlator.

probability of false alarm is given by (7.84) and the probability of missing 
synchronization is given by (7.86) with these modifications. 
The BBN jamming performance is illustrated in Figure 8.5 where the 
probability of not acquiring synchronization is depicted for a few values of SNR. 
In this example, jamming is very effective at precluding synchronization at 
relatively high SNRs. The threshold of PNoSync > 0.3 is reached at   –4 dB at      
 = 10 dB,   –1 dB for  = 20 dB, and   –2 dB for  = 30 dB.

 = 30 dB, 1 = 80 (19 dB), 2 = 40 (16 dB). 
8.2.2.2 Partial-Band Noise Jamming 
 
Partial-band noise (PBN) jamming places noise-jamming energy across multiple, 
but not all, channels in the spectrum used by the targets. These channels may or 
may not be contiguous. The spectrum for PBN jamming is illustrated in Figure 
8.1(c, d); Figure 8.1(c) illustrates contiguous channels while Figure 8.1(d) 
illustrates noncontiguous channels. 
Let  denote the fraction of the target net band instantaneously covered by the 
jammer. It will be shown later that optimal PBN jamming is more successful than 
BBN jamming. Optimal in this sense means that there is a ―best‖ value of . The 
performance of PBN jamming is given by (8.2) where

This function is plotted in Figure 8.6 for some values of . For   0.3, Pe > 10–1 
for   0 dB indicating good jamming performance. Below about  = 0.3,            
Pe < 10–1 for   0 dB so about one-third of the channels must be jammed. 
 
8.2.2.3 Narrowband Noise Jamming 
 
Narrowband noise (NBN) jamming places all of the jamming energy into a single 
channel. The bandwidth of this energy injection could be the whole width of the 
channel or it could be only the data signal width or the complementary signal 
width. In the former, when the target is a digital signal, BFSK, for example, both 
the mark and the space tone frequencies receive jamming energy. Narrowband 
noise jamming is illustrated in Figure 8.1(e). Pe for jamming both data paths is 
given by the same expression as for BBN as (3.96) with
nP

assuming follower 
jamming is employed (the only situation where NBN jamming of FHSS signals 
makes sense). This also ignores tracking issues discussed later. 
 
When there is a noise signal of average power J injected into the data channel 
only, then Pe can be calculated by considering the data channel as receiving a

signal that is Rayleigh distributed while the complementary channel is receiving a 
signal that is Ricean distributed. In a Rayleigh distributed channel the received 
signal consists of several randomly distributed specular components and no direct 
component while the received signal in a Ricean channel has a significant direct 
component in addition to the specular components. In that case, the PDF of the 
signals in the two filters is given by [3]

8.2.3 Tone Jamming 
 
In tone jamming, one or more jammer tones are strategically placed in the 
spectrum. Where they are placed and their number affect the jamming 
performance. Two types of tone jamming are illustrated in Figure 8.1. Single-tone 
jamming places a single tone where it is needed and is illustrated in Figure 8.1(g). 
Multiple-tone jamming distributes the jammer power among several tones and is 
illustrated in Figure 8.1(g). 
The phase of the jammer tone relative to the target signal can be an important 
parameter [4, 5]. Suppose that the data symbol is a mark. Further, assume the 
jammer signal level is sufficiently greater than the noise that it can be neglected. 
When n = 1, in a jammed channel the single jammer tone present is either at the

mark or the space frequency. If it is at the mark frequency, then the phase can 
present a problem if the jammer tone is sufficiently out of phase as explained 
below. If it is at the space frequency, then if the JSR is large enough, the symbol is 
jammed independent of the phase relationship. 
When n > 2 and the tones are present in a contiguous band of channels, then 
jamming performance, the same as that for PBN jamming is achieved. For PBN 
jamming, it makes no theoretical difference whether the jammer power that makes 
it through the detector filters is a tone with or without noise modulation. Thus, we 
have partial-band multitone jamming. Realistically, a tactical jammer is limited to 
about 100 watts ERP for a UAS jammer to about 5 kW ERP for a large ground- 
based jammer. In these cases, n would be limited to on the order of 10 for the 
jammer to be effective, thus, for the low VHF (30 to 90 MHz),   0.004 or so. 
For n = 2 there will be a symbol error if the channel is jammed at all and the 
jammer tone power in the complementary channel is greater than the power in the 
symbol channel, which consists of the symbol tone and one of the jammer tones. 
The power in the symbol channel depends on the phase relationship between the 
symbol signal and the jammer tone.  
To determine the effects of the phase relationship, consider the phasor diagram 
shown in Figure 8.7 [5]. Assume that the phase of the jammer tone relative to that 
of the symbol tone is uniformly distributed over (0, 2); thus, p() = 1/2 as 
shown in Figure 8.8. For the jammer to be effective in a jammed channel then the 
jammer wants to optimize a parameter  so that

J  
(8.18) 
 
The total signal at the symbol frequency that also has the jammer tone is thus 
given by

Note that  is upper bounded by four, as any larger value would produce an 
argument for the cos–1 function that is greater than 1. In addition, it is lower-
bounded by zero, since at 0 it implies that the jammer is infinitely more powerful 
than the signal. Since J = R/, this expression indicates that J can be as much as 6 
dB less than R and still accomplish jamming, but the phase relationship must be 
correct. Ps is plotted in Figure 8.9.

This function is plotted in Figure 8.10 for some values of SNR versus  when the 
number of channels jammed is 10 out of 2,400. Over the majority of the range of 
, the SNR makes little difference. 
Peterson [7] argues that when the background noise is negligible, and only one 
jamming tone is allowed per channel, then close to the optimum value of n is 
given by

where x stands for the integer part of x, and in this case, J stands for the total 
average jammer power arriving at the receiver. The rationale for this is that if n is 
larger than this, the jammer power per channel is less than the signal power in that 
channel and (neglecting noise effects) the signal in the channel will be detected 
properly. Likewise, if n is smaller than this value, the jammer power per channel is 
more than is needed to accomplish the jamming, and jamming power is wasted 
and more channels could be jammed with the same total jammer power. 
 
8.2.3.1 Single Tone 
 
A jamming signal transmitted at a single frequency was shown in Figure 8.1(f). 
Thus, the jamming signal is a CW tone placed at a single frequency. Single-tone 
jamming is also called spot jamming. It will be shown in later chapters that CW

jamming of FHSS systems is unsuccessful. It has been successfully applied to very 
narrow targets such as OOK telegraphy that is not changing frequency, however. 
Single-tone jamming may be useful, for example, against DSSS AJ systems by 
overcoming the processing gain of such systems at the receivers and causing 
deleterious effects at the despread level. When the total jammer power is fixed, 
more power can be placed in a single tone than in each of multiple tones, thereby 
increasing the probability of overcoming the processing gain.  
 When there is a single tone and it is placed in the data channel, while the 
complementary channel has only thermal noise, then the jammer can enhance the 
ability of the receiver to correctly decode the data bit, depending on the phase 
relationship between the interfering tone and the data tone and the relative 
magnitudes of the tones. Based on (3.35), the probability of bit error in this case, 
is, however,

8.2.3.2 Multiple Tones 
 
The jammer could emit L > 1 tones, randomly placed, or placed at specific 
frequencies. If a particular target AJ communication system is vulnerable to 
specific tones and the jammer knows that, then it may be more prudent to use 
tones at those specific frequencies rather than placing them randomly. 
When the tones are in consecutive channels, this is called comb jamming. 
Herein, no matter which tone jamming strategy is being discussed, it is tacitly 
assumed that the tone is placed precisely at a frequency in the spectrum so that the 
jammer tone passes through the receiver filters without distortion or attenuation. 
Multitone jamming is illustrated in Figure 8.1(g). 
When the interference is jammer tones only into both the data channel and the 
complementary channel with no noise, then Pe is given by (3.99)

Confined to Within the Same Channel, L  M  
 
The L tones can be confined to be in the same channel or they can be distributed 
through the spectrum. It is assumed that each of the jamming tones is at the same 

Jamming Techniques 
 
485
power level as the others since the jammer does not know which of the M data 
tones is present and has no basis upon which to apply higher power to one of the 
tones over another. The goal when constrained to within the channel is to place 
tones at two or more locations where data tones may be located. 
 
If an FFHSS AJ system hops to a channel where such a jammer is located, one 
of M tones will be transmitted representing a single symbol. By jamming with two 
or more tones, the jammer is assured of hitting at least one incorrect tone and 
maybe two. It is also possible for the jammer to reinforce the correct symbol tone 
with one of its own tones. Therefore, whether the jammer is effective or not will 
depend on: (1) if the correct symbol tone is not hit then the JSR at the tone 
frequencies, and (2) if the correct symbol tone is hit with one of the jammer tones, 
then depending on the phase relationship between the jammer tone and data tone 
and the JSR, the receiver may correctly decide which symbol was sent and the 
jammer will be ineffective or the jammer could be successful. 
 If an SFHSS AJ system hops to such a channel then some of the symbol tones 
could be received in error depending on the JSR. At those tone frequencies, 
representing symbols that were not sent the jammer signal must be larger than the 
signal frequency to be effective. At those symbol times when the jammer hits the 
symbol tone that was sent, then the receiver may correctly decide the transmitted 
symbol since the jammer reinforces the symbol energy, but this depends on the 
phase relationship. 
 
If there are L tones all placed in the same channel, and left there then this 
jamming technique would be ineffective against FHSS AJ communication 
networks because the target would have to hop to that channel to be jammed. 
Therefore, a better strategy is for the jammer to be swept or hopped randomly to 
attempt to hit as many channels as possible. 
 
This technique could be used against DSSS AJ systems, but jammer 
performance is critically important for effective jamming. The best jammer 
performance is obtained by placing the multiple tones at integer multiples of the 
data rate. The tone jammer performance against DSSS is illustrated in Figure 8.11 
and 8.12. In Figure 8.11, a single tone is placed at f = 1/2Tc away from the carrier 
with the curves based on exact calculations. The curves in Figure 8.12 are based 
on an example of five tones placed at f =  1/Tc,  1/2Tc, and 0. These curves are 
based on an approximate bound. Also shown in Figure 8.12 is the communication 
system performance in the presence of noise only (no jammer). 
These charts demonstrate that tone jamming, whether single or multiple tones 
are used, is relatively ineffective for even moderate values of the SNR when

performance would implement SNRs higher than those shown in Figure 8.11 and

Not Confined to Within the Same Channel 
 
The jammer tones can be placed throughout the spectrum of operation of the 
communication system. In that case, a frequency-hopping system may hop to one 
of the tones and send data at that tone or it may not. A DSSS system may also 
encounter one of the tones. A hybrid system may hop to one of the tones, but the 
effect will be different from the FHSS case because of the direct sequence 
spreading. 
 
Multiple Tone Effects on Synchronization 
 
Some synchronization processes for FHSS were presented in Section 7.4.1. The 
FHSS analysis included the effects of thermal noise and interfering signals on the 
performance of three schemes for synchronization. It was assumed that interferers 
arrived at the target receiver at the same signal level as the intended signal. Those 
interferers could just as easily be considered multiple tone jammers. Presented 
here are the performances of multiple tone jammers against these synchronization 
techniques. 
 
To consider the tone jammers, it is only necessary for

in that analysis. The number of jamming tones is given by h. 
 
It is assumed here that the jammer has no knowledge of the hop sequence. 
Thus, the only alternative is to place the jammer tones randomly throughout Wss. If 
the jammer knew the hop sequence, then it would be perfectly effective, limited 
only by the amounts of power involved. That is not the problem analyzed here. 
It is assumed that the FHSS receiver implements limiters prior to the FHSS 
detectors. In that case, the optimum jamming power per tone is slightly greater 
than the maximum signal level because less than this and the receiver is not 
jammed, while with jamming power greater than this, the limiters remove the 
excess jamming energy and is therefore wasted. Hence, when NJ is the number of 
jammer tones present, since

Multiple-tone jamming performance against two-step synchronization is shown 
in Figures 8.13 and 8.14. The jamming effectiveness as the JSR is increased is 
shown in Figure 8.8. T1 would normally be somewhat higher than T2 because in 
two-step synchronization the first stage has lower reliability but is faster, while the 
second stage has higher reliability but can be somewhat slower. As there are more 
correlators available for the second step in the synchronization technique, weaker 
jammer signals have less effect on the received signal. Therefore, the jammer 
performance improves as the JSR is increased when there are more second-step 
correlators available. 
The effects of increasing the number of tones are shown in Figure 8.14. Higher 
SNR means that in step 1 there are more hits that are false. With few correlators 
for the second step, many of the valid hits are discarded so the BER is higher than 
for the lower SNR. This is evident in Figure 8.14 by comparing like SNR curves 
for c = 3 and c = 7. 
 
In this analysis WIF = 1/Th so it is applicable to FFHSS systems. For SFHSS 
systems, this bandwidth has insufficient width to communicate much data; for 
example, at 100 hps, WIF = 1/10 ms = 100 Hz. Instead WIF  1/Tb, yielding typical 
VHF bandwidths of 25 kHz for a 20 kbps data rate. 
 
As mentioned in Section 7.5.1, with early-late gate tracking of FHSS systems, 
successful communications is not substantially affected by interfering tones. That 
is not the case here for coarse synchronization. Therefore, it is important for 
successful ECM to deny the initial synchronization of a communication network. 
 
Figure 8.13 Multiple-tone jamming performance against two-step coarse synchronization. For this 
example 1 = 60 (18 dB), 2 = 20 (13 dB), b = 0.5, c = 3, P = 10, A = 10, and h = 20.

8.2.4 Swept Jamming 
 
A concept similar to broadband or partial-band noise jamming is swept jamming. 
This is when a relatively narrowband signal, which could be as narrow as a tone 
but more often is a PBN signal, is swept or scanned in time across the frequency 
band of interest. At any instant in time, the jammer is centered on a specific 
frequency and the only portion of the spectrum being jammed is in a narrow 
region around this frequency. However, since the signal is swept, a broad range of 
frequencies can be jammed in a short period. When implemented digitally, for 
example, the jammer may spend 100 s at any one frequency before moving on to 
the next band to be jammed. Normally these bands would be consecutive, but do 
not have to be—the bands could actually be selected randomly with digital 
synthesizers generating the jamming waveform. In this way this jammer could 
cover the whole 30–90 MHz band in about 240 ms. 
The net effect of such a jamming strategy is similar to a barrage jammer except 
that the full power of the jammer is employed at each dwell bandwidth. It is also 
possible to sectorize the jamming strategy and avoid certain bands that might be in 
use by friendly forces. This is true only when the timing is tailored to the target 
receivers so that the jamming signal is present at the receiver for an adequate 
dwell time. The characteristics of the target receivers must be taken into 
consideration for swept jamming to be effective. 
It is also important to note that the characteristics of the target receiver are 
important for evaluating the effectiveness of swept jamming. The filtering process 
in the receiver has considerable impact on the dwell duration required. All the 
Figure 8.14 Multiple-tone jamming performance example against two-step synchronization acquisition 
as the number of tones, h, is varied. In this case 1 = 60 (18 dB), 2 = 20 (13 dB), b = 0.5, P = 10,  = 0 
dB, m = 1, and A = 10. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

analyses herein are predicated on the jammer dwell being long enough so the 
jammer effects are not hindered by such concerns. 
The main purpose for sweeping the partial-band noise waveform is to ensure 
that the jammer enters the frequency spectrum where an FHSS target net is 
located. Normally FHSS AJ networks do not use every channel from, say, 30 MHz 
to 90 MHz, but only a portion, called the hop set. These hop sets need not be that 
large to be effective. It could be that a partial-band jammer permanently situated in 
a portion of the spectrum does not cover any of the hop set frequencies, or perhaps 
just a few of them. This renders the partial-band jammer ineffective. By sweeping 
the jamming waveform over the whole range, then the jammer is ensured to jam at 
the entire set of hop frequencies. 
Timing is one of the more important parameters for a swept jammer. The 
sweeping must be fast enough to ensure that the whole band is covered in a 
sufficiently short period or hops will occur for which no jamming signal is present. 
On the other hand, sweeping cannot be so fast that when a hop is jammed, an 
inadequate fraction of the hop is jammed. A BER of 10–1 means that it is necessary 
to jam 1 bit out of 10, or for an AJ system that is sending data at 20 kbps, 2,000 
bits must be jammed to produce this BER. If this system is an SFHSS network at 
100 hps, each hop will contain around 200 bits (this discussion ignores the finite 
time it takes to go from hop to hop). Therefore, at least 10 hops per second must 
be jammed. Since these hops can be anywhere in the spectrum from the point of 
view of the jammer, at least 10 sweeps per second are required. To cover the 60 
MHz in the low VHF range 10 times per second requires a sweep rate of 600 MHz 
per second. Each channel is 25 kHz, so this equates to 24,000 channels per second, 
or a maximum of 42 s on each channel if the jamming waveform is one channel 
wide (25 kHz). If it is 10 channels wide (250 kHz), then 4.20 s per channel is 
allowed and if it is 100 channels wide (2.5 MHz) then 4.2 ms can be spent on each 
channel. 
 The trade-off with these numbers is that as the instantaneous bandwidth is 
increased, the power per channel decreases if the total jammer power remains 
fixed. Obviously, when the instantaneous bandwidth gets large enough to be equal 
to the total target system bandwidth, the results are the same as BBN jamming. In 
that case, there is no point in sweeping at all. 
 
8.2.5 Pulse Jamming 
 
Pulse jamming is similar in concept to partial-band noise jamming. The fraction, 
, in this case corresponds to the portion of time that the jammer is on relative to 
off, whereas for PBN jamming the fraction corresponded to the portion of the 
spectrum covered at a time. The statistics work out to be the same, however. Short 

Jamming Techniques 
 
491
pulses have broad spectral content and therefore are similar to broadband noise 
when they are on. 
 
Pulse jamming can have lower average power than some of the other jamming 
techniques discussed herein, and be just as or more effective. The duty cycle 
determines the relationship between the average power and peak power. The 
jamming effects depend on the peak power and how often that signal returns to the 
receiver. 
 
8.2.6 Follower Jamming 
 
A follower jammer attempts to locate the frequency to which the frequency-
hopping transmitter went, identify the signal as the one of interest (the target), and 
jam at the new frequency. This jamming waveform could be in the form of tones 
or it could modulate the tones with, say, noise using FM modulation. Follower 
jamming is also referred to as responsive jamming, repeater jamming, and repeat-
back jamming. 
 
Some basic limitations to employing follower jammers against FHSS targets 
were determined by Torrieri [10].1 These limits are related to the placement of the 
communicators relative to the jammer that imposes timing constraints. 
The task of the ES system is to acquire where an FHSS signal has moved in 
frequency so the EA system can place the jamming signal at that frequency. This 
is typically done by measuring the spectrum for new energy loss or gain and 
making appropriate measurements on those channels. A loss of energy implies that 
the target has moved to a new frequency. A gain of energy in a channel implies 
that a new signal is present, which may or may not be the target. ES to find the 
new frequency can be very difficult to do accurately and rapidly. Even when the 
channel structure of the spectrum is limited, when measuring just energy, most 
targets may look similar. It requires an examination of the details of each new 
signal to determine if it is the target. 
The timing of a follower jammer must satisfy certain constraints due to the 
finite propagation and processing time of the signals. In general, to meet the 
timing requirements, the jammer must lie anywhere on or within the ellipse shown 
in Figure 8.15 based on [10].

The timing of such is shown in Figure 8.16. T represents the difference in 
propagation time of the transmitter signal at the receiver and the jammer. This 
time may actually be negative if the jammer is closer to the transmitter than the 
receiver. The jammer takes a certain amount of time to process the signal and this 
is represented by Tproc. The jammer signal takes a certain amount of time to 
propagate to the receiver once the jammer signal is started. This is represented by 
Tprop. For the majority of the cases of interest herein, the propagation times are 
negligible compared with the other times involved. 
 
The dwell fraction within which follower jamming will be effective depends 
on the path length difference between the path between the transmitter and 
receiver versus the path from the transmitter to the jammer and the jammer to the 
receiver. It is also affected by the amount of processing time required at the 
jammer to make a jamming decision. This is illustrated in Figure 8.17 as an 
example. In this case, it is assumed that the jammer processing time is 10% of the 
dwell time. The data shown in Figure 8.17 corresponds to the fraction of a dwell 
that is available for the jammer to jam. A dwell of 10–5, for example, if LF = 4,

would correspond to a bit rate of 25 kbps, about that required to transmit uncoded 
voice traffic. 
When one adjacent channel is jammed, the full power of the jammer is placed 
into that channel while when two or more channels are jammed, the jammer power 
is divided among those channels, leaving the power per channel less than what it is 
otherwise. For BFSK, on the other hand, if only one adjacent channel is jammed, 
the jammer does not know if it is the complementary channel so the probability of 
jamming the hop is half of what it is otherwise. 
It may be required to jam both adjacent channels. To do this without jamming 
the data channel adds complexity to the jammer, so therefore the jammer may 
choose to jam all three channels, thus ensuring that the complementary channel is 
jammed. This does, of course, decrease the power per channel by a factor of 3 (4.8 
dB). Figure 8.18 illustrates jamming all three consecutive channels. If it is decided 
to jam just one adjacent channel, Pe is decreased by half in that case because either 
adjacent channel could be the correct one and it will be jammed half the time. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

Figure 8.18 Follower jammer jamming three contiguous channels. 
The data shown in Figure 8.19 compares the jamming effectiveness when one 
complementary channel is jammed versus when all three are jammed when           
 = 20 dB. For the parameters used in this example, jamming one adjacent channel 
is better even though some (on average, half) of the symbols are not jammed due 
to ignorance of the correct complementary channel. 
The requirement to jam the current symbol is restrictive relative to  the 
placement of the jammer. For example, for SFHSS and digitized voice 
communications, the data rate would be on the order of 20 kbps so the symbol 
time is about 500 s. The amount of the symbol necessary to jam depends on the 
JSR relative to the SNR since the decision as to whether a mark or space was sent 
is based on the energy detectors at the output of the bandpass filters. Suppose that 
a mark was sent (see Figure 8.20). A space will be decided if the jammer catches 
the last   500 s of the symbol in this case. The allowable path-length 
differences are shown in Figure 8.21 for three times corresponding to  = 0.4, 0.45, 
and 0.5.

8.2.6.1 Follower Jamming with Narrowband Noise 
 
Receiver detection performance is based on the SNR in the channel after the 
detector filters have removed out-of-channel noise. Therefore, placing a noise 
waveform in the channel will affect the ability of the receiver to properly detect 
the tone. 
In this section, the analytical results are first presented. They are compared in 
the last section.

Thus, for  >> 3 dB, the optimum jammer power is approximately equal to the

all. A BER of 10–1 or higher is achieved by the noise alone in that case.

whereas jamming the data channel is given by (8.36), which is clearly smaller due 
to the lack of the J term in the numerator of the multiplying coefficient. 
 
When picking just one of the adjacent channels shown in Figure 8.18, the 
probability of successfully jamming the correct channel is half of what it would be 
otherwise. Therefore, when including the effects of jamming, only a portion of the

Jamming Two Contiguous Channels with Narrowband Noise 
 
When both the data channel and one of the adjacent channels are jammed with 
noise signals that are wide enough to fill the bandwidth of the detector filters, then 
the same results as broadband jamming ensues, as given by (3.95). The jamming 
power per channel is reduced by half, however so

noise in both the adjacent channels without jamming the data channel. In that way, 
it is assured that the complementary channel will be jammed. The drawback is

It is also possible to apply narrowband noise jamming to all three channels at the

channel gets jammed. The jammer power per jammed channel is reduced to one-
third, but there is no loss associated with not knowing which adjacent channel is

NBN jamming. Signal detection in noncoherent FSK receivers is based on 
measuring the energy from the channel filters. Placing additional energy at the 
correct FSK tone increases this energy, thus facilitating easier detection.  
 
Again, we are faced with the quandary whether to jam one, two, or three 
channels.

Wherein most FHSS systems are built with the data channel and the 
complementary channel in two contiguous channels, an effective ECCM technique 
is to use independent synthesizers in the FHSS system to place the mark and space 
center frequencies independently of each other [12]. The jammer, in this case, 
cannot simply jam the adjacent channel with any success. 
 
 

Jamming Techniques

Tones in Both the Data Channel and Complementary Channel 
 
With tones in both the data channel and both of the adjacent channels, it is known 
that the jammer energy injected into the noncomplementary channel is wasted but 
it is also known (in the majority of cases) that both the data channel and the 
complementary channel are being jammed. With independent synthesizers for the 
mark and the space, this ECM approach is ineffective as discussed in the last 
section. 
When both the data channel and the complementary channel are jammed with 
tones, then
2
eP is given by (3.99) but with the power half of what it is otherwise

and the jamming power per channel is half of what it was when a signal channel 
was jammed as explicitly noted in these expressions. 
 
As long as it is known that the complementary channel is adjacent to the data 
channel, then Pe is reduced by a factor of 2, assuming that the mark and the space 
are independent. As long as the extra channel covered by the jammer is always 
below (or above) the detected tone frequency, then the complementary channel 
will be jammed half the time. Thus, P2 = Pe in (8.2) where

eP  is given by (8.51).

8.2.7 Smart Jamming 
 
This category of jamming techniques attempts to disrupt portions of digital signals 
only, selecting only those portions necessary to deny communications, if possible. 
Some types of communication systems must be synchronized to operate properly. 
This synchronization is different from that described in Chapter 7 for 
synchronization of phase shift key signals. IS-95, for example, uses a separate 
coded Walsh channel for synchronization purposes. That channel alone could be 
attacked to degrade the synchronization process. 
Likewise, some AJ signals must track the timing and phase of the transmitted 
signal. Sometimes separate channels are used for this purpose that are not spread. 
Some FHSS schemes use just a few known frequencies for acquisition. Some 

Jamming Techniques 
 
503
scheme is necessary so new members can join the network. An attack on the 
acquisition of the receiver of the incoming digital signal timing and framing 
information is thus possible. DSSS systems must establish where the transmitted 
signal is in the coding sequence so a search over the code space is required for 
acquisition. The major limitation is that the time acquisition occurs must be known 
if it’s time related or the separate channel location if that is the approach used. Cell 
systems and PCS systems used out-of-band signaling to initiate calls. That channel 
can be jammed to preclude call set-up, to include in GSM. Some two-way pager 
systems use these techniques as well. Deception jamming is also possible. Here, 
false messages are sent to the receiver, such as movement orders. 
Taking the notion of smart jamming to the limit, we obtain what could be 
called brilliant jamming. In this category an attempt is made to change specific bit 
patterns in a digital message so that an incorrect but valid message is received. The 
biggest limitations of this are that ultra-timing precision is required as well as 
significant a priori knowledge of the target signal structure. 
 
 
8.3 Asset Sharing 
 
Improving the efficiency of a jammer by increasing the number of signals it can 
simultaneously jam is desirable. This is possible with several techniques. Sharing 
of the jamming assets among several targets increases the utility of the jammer as 
a weapon. It is possible to share the power among targets. It is also possible to 
share the time that the jammer is on, switching from one target to the next in 
succession. This section describes some of these. 
 
8.3.1 Look-Through 
 
For nonspread signals look-through is often employed as a strategy to determine 
whether the target has moved to a new frequency or otherwise has stopped 
transmitting. Look-through is implemented to conserve jamming resources and/or 
to increase the effectiveness of the jammer by jamming more targets than 
otherwise possible. 
 
Look-through is accomplished by turning the jammer transmitter off for a 
short period and measuring the spectrum. It generally does not work against FHSS 
AJ systems because the frequencies change so often when it is assumed that the 
jammer does not know the hop set frequencies. The same can be said for FH/DSSS 
hybrid AJ systems. Look-through for DSSS systems may work if the signal has 
sufficient strength to detect it. 
 
 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
504
8.3.2 Power Sharing 
 
 
It is possible to jam more than one target at the same time. One manifestation of 
this is the aforementioned MT jamming. However, the signals need not be 
narrowband tones to implement such power sharing. Such techniques are 
discussed more fully in [16]. 
 
8.3.3 Time Sharing 
 
Another technique for simultaneous coverage of more than one target is sharing 
the full power of the jammer on each target over time. Jamming a digital signal 
can be accomplished by raising the BER up to a certain level. Such signals need 
not be jammed 100% of the time. One bit in 10 in error is a BER of 1/10, which 
will cause unreliable communication in computer-to-computer links, although 
such a BER would probably be tolerable for voice communications. Neglecting 
the time it takes to switch between frequencies, one jammer could simultaneously 
service 10 such target nets. 
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, it has been shown that for 
analog communication only about 30% of the transmission need be jammed to 
preclude effective voice understanding [16]. Therefore, if a scheme could be 
devised to move back and forth between targets, up to about three could be 
jammed essentially simultaneously with the same jammer. This is called time 
sharing. 
 
 
8.4 Jamming Power to Signal Power Ratios 
 
The jamming power to signal power ratio at the receiver for the most part 
determines the degree to which jamming will be successful. For digital signals, the 
jammer’s goal is to raise this ratio to a level such that the BER is above a certain 
threshold. For analog voice signals, the goal is to reduce the articulation 
performance so that the signals are difficult to understand. For analog voice 
signals the articulation index depends on the timing of the disruptions as well as 
the JSR. Analog voice communication signals are not of significant interest here 
since all important SS systems employ digital techniques. For voice 
communications, the analog voice signals are converted to digital form with A/D 
converters for DSSS, FHSS, and THSS systems. For computer-to-computer 
communications such conversion is, of course, not necessary.  
Actual jamming levels are only approximately predicted by propagation 
models discussed in Chapter 5. On the other hand, in most practical situations, 
actually measuring the JSR cannot reasonably be accomplished. Thus, it is wise to 

Jamming Techniques 
 
505
design jamming margins into the system. If a JSR of 6 dB is required, and the 
model indicates this can be accomplished with a certain jamming power level at a 
certain distance, then designing for a 10 dB JSR, for example, is prudent to 
account for the unknowns in the transition from the models to actual practice. 
 
8.4.1 Rn Model JSR 
 
The propagation loss with distance in this model as expressed by (5.48) is given in 
decibels. Therefore, the JSR can be expressed as

where it has been assumed that the ground characteristics between the transmitter 
and the receiver are the same as those between the jammer and receiver [thus, 
L(D0) is the same for both paths]. 
This function is plotted in Figure 8.24 as a function of the ratio of the distances 
indicated and the power ratio of the jammer to the transmitter where it is assumed 
that n = 4 and GJR = GRJ = GTR = GRT. 
 
8.4.2 Two-Ray Propagation JSR 
 
When the antennas are elevated high enough off the ground, there could be a 
significant ground reflection component at the receiver. As an additional 
consideration, there could be a reflection from the transmitter as well as from the 
jammer. Here it is assumed that there are reflections due to both sources. The JSR 
in this case is given by

This equation is plotted in Figure 8.25 for two antenna height ratios. When            
hJ/hT = 1, the results are the same as the Rn model above. When this ratio is five, 
the jamming performance is somewhat better as shown.  
Inspection of this expression reveals that the JSR varies linearly with the ratio 
of the gain of the jammer antenna (toward the receiver) to that of the transmitter 
(also toward the receiver). It also varies linearly with the ratio of the power of the 
jammer to that of the transmitter. The receiver antenna gain, for most tactical AJ 
systems, would be the same in the directions of the transmitter and receiver, so it 
would have no effect. The JSR also varies as the fourth power of the ratio of the 
distance between the jammer and receiver to that between the transmitter and 
receiver. It also varies with the square of the ratio of the antenna heights. The 
receiver antenna height has no effect either, since it is the same for the transmitter 
path as for the jammer path.

Jamming Techniques 
 
507
Thus, the JSR increases by 6 dB for every doubling of the jammer to 
transmitter antenna height ratio and –12 dB for every doubling of the jammer-
receiver range compared to the transmitter-receiver range. This illustrates that 
jammer antenna height is important, as is the range between the jammer and the 
receiver. A jammer mounted on a UAS addresses both of these issues positively 
allowing considerable antenna heights to be achieved along with placing the 
jammer close to the target receiver (assuming that the approximate location of the 
target receiver is known). 
The variation with height ratio is shown in Figure 8.26. A jammer mounted on 
a UAS that can get reasonably close to the target can perform very effectively 
denying communications. If the target receiver height is 3 m, then at                   
DTR / DJR > 0.5, a UAS need only fly at an altitude of about 300 m to produce a 
JSR of 20 dB or more.

where, as above, it is assumed that the ground characteristics between the 
transmitter and receiver are the same as those between the transmitter and receiver. 
This is the same result as for the Rn model above with n = 4. 
 
8.4.4 Egli Model JSR 
 
The JSR computed with this model yields the same expression as (8.58) since the 
(40/f )2 terms cancel. 
 
 
8.5 Jammer Platform Configurations 
 
Jammers for land warfare can be configured in many forms whether they are AJ 
jammers or not. A standoff jammer is one that is deployed within the geography of 
friendly forces. A stand-in jammer is deployed among the adversarial forces. Due 
to the nature of broadband or partial band-jamming waveforms, such are not 

Jamming Techniques 
 
509
normally used in standoff configurations because of the possibility for excessive 
fratricide for friendly forces. The exception to this is screening jamming when the 
goal is to jam an adversary’s ES systems to preclude interception of friendly 
communications. 
Jammers can be vehicle mounted or dismounted. If they are vehicle mounted, 
they can also be implemented to operate on the move. If they are dismounted, they 
would remain stationary. 
Airborne jammers are employed to extend the range of effectiveness as 
indicated above. A jammer mounted in a UAS can be placed closer to the target 
receivers in a stand-in configuration, thereby substantially reducing the fratricide 
problem. 
The simplest waveform for EA against digital communications is BBN. It also 
is the least complicated and therefore the least expensive system to implement. 
Since a UAS can be a stand-in platform, BBN would typically be the waveform of 
choice for this application. 
Various delivery mechanisms exist to deploy dismounted jammers. They can 
be hand-emplaced by individuals. They can be fired from artillery. UAVs or other 
aircraft, both manned and unmanned, can deploy them. When a UAS is used in 
this role, the overflight possibilities of the UAS can be favorably employed to 
placed the expendable jammers very close the receivers and could be deployed as 
arrays. Such arrays could be configured to cover a whole region with BBN 
jamming energy. Jammers can be deployed via missiles that travel at significant 
velocity. These configurations can be readily retargeted in flight and cover regions 
that are widely separated. 
 
8.6 Concluding Remarks 
 
This chapter presented the most common jamming strategies against AJ targets. 
The parameters involved are the bandwidth of the jamming waveform relative to 
that of the AJ signals, and, if tone jamming, the number and placement of the 
tones. The effectiveness of these jamming techniques at jamming AJ signals is 
presented in Chapters 10–14. 
 
The concept of swept jamming was also presented. This is when one of the 
basic jamming waveforms is swept across the AJ frequency band. Its advantage is 
that at each individual frequency the entire jammer power is applied to the 
channel. Its disadvantage is that it is not present continually at any one frequency. 
Characteristics of the target receivers are important considerations for swept 
jamming. The dwell must be long enough at each frequency or frequency band to 
realize the effects of the jammer. 
 
Follower jamming was also discussed, which attempts to ascertain where an 
FHSS AJ signal appears once it has left the last frequency. This is accomplished 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
510
with a supporting ES system. There are significant timing issues associated with 
follower jammers that are dependent on distances and processing times. 
 
Smart jamming was discussed as a potential jamming strategy. If significant 
information is known about the AJ target, then potentially advantage can be taken 
of it for jamming purposes. Smart jamming targets only portions of digital 
messages and precision timing is required to accomplish it. 
 
The last topic presented was estimation of the JSR using the different models 
presented in Chapter 2. It was shown that the four models presented reduced to 
two when the JSR was the parameter of importance. The difference between the 
two models is an antenna height ratio. In addition, the models are independent of 
frequency because of the assumption that the propagation conditions between the 
transmitter and receiver are the same as between the jammer and receiver and the 
frequency effects cancel. 
 
The modeling results indicated that if the jammer can get close and high in the 
air, the jamming could be particularly effective. This is a UAS configuration of a 
jammer. 
 
Note that there are countermeasures to jamming that an AJ system can 
employ. Rejection of narrowband jammer signals is possible with one or more 
rejection filters in the receiver, which can be particularly effective against the MT 
jamming of DSSS systems. It is difficult to reject BBN and PBN jamming 
waveforms, however, as this would require excising considerable portions of the 
spectrum and communication would be hindered. It is also difficult to excise the 
effects of follower jammer waveforms on FHSS systems, as these are predicated 
on detecting the energy from the communication system prior to jamming, 
implying that the frequency is being used.

Blind CDMA Code Discovery 
 
 
9.1 Introduction 
 
CDMA technology specifically is for the purpose of allowing multiple 
communication systems to share the same spectrum simultaneously. A 
narrowband digital signal is spread out in the frequency spectrum by 
multiplication by a chip sequence that has a much higher clock rate, as illustrated 
in Figure 9.1. Signals spread by this method have very little energy at any 
narrowband portion of the RF spectrum and can be below the noise level within 
that band. This can make such signals very hard to detect. 
 
In this chapter we present techniques for blindly determining the spreading 
codes in CDMA signals. The chapter is structured as follows. First, we briefly 
review what it means to blindly estimate a spreading code sequence. We then 
present a technique for estimating the code when it is known that there is a single 
DSSS signal present. We then present three algorithms that estimate the spreading 
codes when multiple CDMA signals could be present. The first uses subspace 
decomposition with a MUSIC approach. The second also uses subspace 
decomposition but implements an iterative procedure for estimating the code 
sequence. The last algorithm can be used if it is known that the codes are based on 
m-sequences using an extended Massey algorithm. 
 
 
9.2 CDMA Signals 
 
Conventional techniques for geolocation of targets emitting RF energy, such as 
interferometry or differential Doppler, cannot separate the energy from more than 
one signal simultaneously present on a frequency. These techniques assume that 
there is a single target present. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

Figure 9.1 Generating CDMA signals. The data sequence is given by d(t) and c(t) is the chip 
sequence. 
 
CDMA, by its very nature, imposes several broadband signals on the same 
portion of the frequency spectrum. These signals are separated in the receivers in 
the CDMA system by using codes. The receivers know what code is used by the 
MTs, and can process the signals received with those codes, properly decoding the 
signal of interest while simultaneously suppressing all other signals in the band. 
A very common technique for spreading the digital signals in CDMA systems 
is illustrated in Figure 9.2. A short code, say, with a 15-bit PN spreading code, is 
applied to the symbols, separating them into I and Q channels, and the result 
applied to the RF phase modulators. These two channels (I and Q) are then 
combined in the RF modulator and transmitted.

Blind CDMA Code Discovery

Generally, it is not known a priori by an EW intercept system what specific 
CDMA codes are in use in a region. By applying blind discovery techniques, the 
codes can be determined, as can the power levels of the individual signals. For 
systems employing short codes, however, it is frequently sufficient to try all 
possible sequences to determine which are in use at the current time. This requires 
knowledge of timing offsets as will be described. 
 
The chip sequence c(t) determines the characteristics of how the channel can 
be shared among several users. The codes for c(t) are orthogonal for all users of 
the channel. Therefore, their cross-correlation is low, while exhibiting a large 
autocorrelation value at zero lag offset. 
 
Once the code is determined, several functions can be performed. If the code 
so discovered is the totality of the spreading code, then despreading is possible and 
the spreading code can be applied to the received signal and the despread, 
narrowband signal ensues. The time difference of arrival (TDOA), frequency 
difference of arrival (FDOA), or direction of arrival (DOA) methods can be 
applied to geolocate the transmitter. Whether or not the code is the totality of the 
spreading process, users can be tracked over the battlespace once they are 
identified by their unique code sequence. 
 
 
9.3 Single Code Discovery 
 
In this section we discuss a technique for blindly determining the spreading code 
of a DSSS signal when there is only a single signal present. It is based on results 
presented by Burel and Bouder [1]. Generally, the properties of the transmitter are 
unknown, including the spreading code. Also, we do not assume that we know the 
family of spreading codes possible. We do assume that the symbol period Ts is 
known; if it is not, then it can be estimated with the technique outlined in Section 
4.4.2.5. 
First we divide the received signal into windows, each the size of the symbol 
period. Each of these windows contains the end of one symbol of duration Ts – t0 
and the beginning of the next symbol of duration t0, which is assumed to be 
unknown. Eigenanalysis of the autocorrelation of the samples in the windows 
produces two large eigenvalues, assumed without loss of generality to be the first 
two. Denote by h(t) the convolution of the pseudo-random sequence with the 
impulse responses of all the filters in the transmission path:

A limitation of this method is that it assumes that short codes are used. Also, 
the derivation assumes that there is a single DSSS signal present in the passband

of the intercept receiver. Therefore, it has EW applications for finding the codes of 
DSSS signals but limited utility for intercept of CDMA signals where multiple 
signals are expected to be the norm. 
 
 
 
9.4 Blind Estimation of Multiple Codes with Subspace 
Decomposition and MUSIC 
 
Haghighat and Soleymani [2] developed a method for blind code discovery based 
on the eigendecomposition of the autocorrelation matrix of the received signal and 
the MUSIC algorithm. We summarize their technique in this section. In this 
approach all possible potential spreading codes must be examined by projecting 
onto the noise and signal subspaces. If these potential codes are unknown, then all 
possible 2N–1 sequences must be examined. 
 
9.4.1 Signal Model 
 
We assume that the direct sequence CDMA communication system is 
synchronous. As previously mentioned, the synchronization of a PCS downlink 
can be accomplished at the BS. While the PCS uplink is asynchronous at RF, there 
are ways to synchronize the signals in the intercept system (and BS). No a priori 
information is assumed to be known about the target CDMA system, including the 
possible spreading codes. 
When there are L users of a channel, the received signal prior to sampling in 
that channel during the time interval (0, T) can be represented as

where Al is the amplitude of the lth user, assumed unknown but constant over the 
time of concern, 
{ 1, 1}
ld 
 represents the data sequence, with both values 
equiprobable, and cl(t) is the pseudo-random spreading sequence of the lth user. 
Furthermore, it is assumed that the spreading codes are short.1 The noise in the 
channel is given by n(t), which is assumed to be AWGN with variance 2. 
 
After sampling, (9.12) can be represented by 
                                                           
1 A short spreading sequence is one where the extent of the code is 1 bit. This can be extended to a few 
bits and the results herein still apply.

Singular vectors spanning the signal subspace are given by Us and those

subspace is given by 0 and, in this case, is the number of active users in the 
channel (0 = L). The eigenvalues in  can be separated into two disjoint sets: 
those that are larger than some threshold and those that are smaller than that 
threshold. The smallest eigenvalues have multiplicity N – L [3].

If 
ic corresponds to an active user in the channel, then the code sequence lies in 
the signal subspace and fi = 0. On the other hand if fi > 0, then that user is not 
active at the moment. Likewise, if the ith user is active, then gi = 1, and if the ith 
user is not active, then gi < 1. This is the MUSIC algorithm. 
 
A unique signature sequence (code) is assigned for each mobile terminal. It is 
generated by using a combination of a code for the manufacturer and the mobile 
serial number. 
Thus, expressions (9.20) and/or (9.21) can be used as tests for the presence or 
absence of a particular code sequence. If the code sequence is known in advance, 
then the tests given by these functions will determine its presence. If the possible 
code sequences are not a priori known, then (9.20) must be tested for all possible 
code sequences. In all cases of practical interest, however, the number of possible 
code sequences are limited. 
The spreading codes consist of N chips. Therefore, the examination of all 
possible 2N–1 different combinations is required to ascertain which code sequences 
are active at the moment. This, however, is not adequate to determine precisely 
which users are active since linear combinations of the code sequences can cause 
similar behavior for tests (9.20) and (9.21). That is, such linear combinations can 
produce 
0
if 
 and 
1.
ig 
 Thus, false positives can be produced, depending on 
which particular code sequences are active. Some method is therefore required to 
determine how many users are active. 
 
Such a method is provided by decorrelating the received signal. Such a 
decorrelating function can be determined as [2]

 In 
that case the noise component is due to background and system noise only, and 
interference from other users is not present. When
ic is a combination of codes, 
significant interference from the other codes is present and such clustering does 
not occur and the decorrelator output is dispersed. This is illustrated in Figure 9.5. 
In Figure 9.5(a) there is an authentic code while in Figure 9.5(b) there is a 
combination of codes that causes the PDF to spread out. 
A cost function can be defined based on this clustering/disbursing

9.4.3 Performance 
 
The results presented above were simulated. A processing gain of N = 16 was 
used. When there were 10 users of the channel, the initial SVD indicated that there 
were 64 users present. The inverse of the cost function is illustrated in Figure 9.6. 
In Figure 9.6(a), all the users had equal power. In Figure 9.6(b) one user had an 
SNR of 6 dB, while all the others had an SNR of 26 dB. In both cases, the 
procedure described above found the 10 authentic code sequences. 
 
9.4.4 Summary 
 
While the technique presented in this section can be used to determine multiple 
codes as demonstrated in Figure 9.6,
'
K can be, and usually will be, much larger 
than the number of possible code sequences K. This results in a considerable 
computation burden, so parallel implementations are required in practice. In many 
cases this number can be pared down considerably.

Performance of this algorithm for a particular example is shown in Figure 9.7 
Note that the detection rate decreases rather rapidly with multiple users. The 
discovery rate falls to 50% with only two CDMA signals present and becomes 
virtually useless with more than three simultaneous users. 
This algorithm does work when there is more than one user present, but is 
limited to synchronous CDMA systems. We discussed methods of forming 
synchronous CDMA networks from asynchronous ones in Chapter 7.

9.6 Blind Discovery of DSSS m-Sequence Chip Codes 
 
If the targets of concern are known to employ linear m-sequences, including Gold 
codes constructed from two m-sequences, then there is an alternative method to 
estimate the chip sequence [6] based on an extended Massey algorithm [7]. It is 
based on analysis of the LFSR as described in Chapter 7, one of which is shown in 
Figure 9.8 for convenience. The next value to enter the leftmost stage (nth) is

Some method must be found that estimates the tap weights using (9.48). One 
method is to examine all tap set vectors and count identical ones. The vector that 
occurs the majority of the time is assumed to be the actual vector. The results for 4 
windows and 50 windows are illustrated in Figure 9.9 for n = 8 taps, averaged over 
1,000 simulation runs. 
 
Gold codes are built from two or more linear feedback shift registers, with the 
case of two of order p1 and p2 illustrated in Figure 9.10. Two m-sequences 
modulo-2 added in this way generate the linear product code of length p1 + p2.

This sequence can be discovered in a similar way as described above. Knowing 
the LFSR structure, it is possible to determine which transmitter is broadcasting. 
 
Limited results are available based on general CDMA signaling. These results 
are delineated in Table 9.1 for up to three signals. When the m-sequence lengths 
are different, in some cases no solutions are available, but for the important special 
case of equal sequence lengths, the technique does yield viable solutions. 
 
 
9.7 Concluding Remarks 
 
We examined several techniques for estimation of the spreading codes of CDMA 
signals in this chapter. Since, in general, for EW applications, knowledge of the 
specific code in use is not generally known, methods to recover it from signals 
received are important.

In some cases, even though the specific code is not known at the intercept 
receiver, it may be possible that the set of possible codes is known. This 
information can be exploited in those cases to optimize the search for the specific 
code.

10.1 Introduction 
 
Performance of jamming techniques against DSSS targets is presented in this 
chapter. DSSS systems spread the baseband data signal over a broad bandwidth to 
achieve AJ protection. Frequently these signals are below the noise floor at the 
point of reception, so even detecting their presence can be difficult. However, the 
existence of the near-far problem in multiple access DSSS systems supports the 
notion that DSSS signals can be jammed. The near-far problem is created by one 
signal (DSSS or otherwise) being significantly stronger than a DSSS signal within 
the same bandwidth so the receiver is swamped by the first signal. This is similar 
to jamming.  
Because they are the most prolific forms, all of the results in this chapter are 
presented for signals with PSK modulations, and, in particular, attention is focused 
on BPSK and QPSK. QPSK can be considered two independent BPSK signals at 
half the data rate. In addition, offset QPSK and MSK are two forms of QPSK that 
have desirable properties in the form of reduced sidelobes, which lower the 
interference in adjacent frequency channels. Although these forms of modulation 
imply coherent detection, noncoherent demodulation is also possible [1]. 
The resultant spectra of UWB signals are similar to those of DSSS; however, 
we believe that this topic is of sufficient importance that there is a separate chapter 
for it. 
This chapter is structured as follows. We first define the DSSS communication 
system that comprises the target we are talking about. Next, the characteristics of 
BBN jamming of DSSS systems is addressed, limiting the discussion to BPSK and 
QPSK modulations as these are the most prolific modulations for DSSS systems at 
the time of this writing. Then, PBN jamming of DSSS is presented, followed by 
similar coverage for pulsed jamming. Tone jamming, both single tone and

multitone, is discussed last, covering the characteristics of both long and short 
spreading codes, as the jamming performance depends on code length. 
 
 
10.2 DSSS Communication Systems 
 
10.2.1 Introduction 
 
In the DSSS transmitter, the data signal modulates a carrier, then the data-
modulated signal modulates a wideband spreading code onto a wideband carrier. 
In the cases we consider, the phase of the carrier is the manifestation of the 
modulation by the spreading code. Furthermore, we only consider binary and 
quadriphase modulations. 
At a synchronized receiver, the received signal is despread by a despreading 
code and demodulated by a carrier. The modulation in all the cases we are 
concerned with is digital phase modulation. Note that different modulation may be 
used for the carrier and the spreading signal. 
To measure the BER, it is necessary to know the test statistics of the data, 
jammer, and noise signals at the output of the correlator in the receiver. It is 
assumed that the noise is Gaussian with variance N0W. Throughout this section, 
coherent synchronization is assumed. 
We will consider two types of spreading modulation, biphase and (offset) 
quadriphase, and two types of data modulation, biphase and quadriphase in this 
chapter. A word on notation is in order at this point. We will use the acronyms 
shown in Table 10.1 since we use the terms for the modulation types quite 
frequently.

waveforms, also with values ±1 . The jammer frequency j may or may not be 
equal to the signal frequency 0. wI(t) and wQ(t) are weighting functions for the in-
phase and quadrature phase paths, respectively, which are used in the model to 
control whether the modulation is BPSK or QPSK. T0 represents the time offset of 
the code waveform for the in-phase component, relative to that for the quadrature 
component. For BPSK/BPSK, T0 = 0,

A mathematical model block diagram of a BPSK/QPSK DSSS receiver is shown

applied to determine the modulation type. The first mixer stages then convert the 
signals in the two paths to an IF frequency. The signals are then multiplied by a 
synchronized replica of the code sequence, bandpass filtered, and mixed at the

bandpass filtering and integrator is a correlator). Decision logic is at the output of 
the integrators to decide which symbol was sent.

depending on the identity of the data bit, g is a zero mean Gaussian r.v. with 
variance N0/2 and is the response of the correlation receiver to thermal channel 
noise n(t), and the third term is the response to the jamming signal. 
The third term in (10.5) depends on a specific code sequence ci+l and the 
jammer frequency offset . In general, it is not possible to find a closed form 
expression for the moments of the third term in (10.5). However, there are two 
cases in which the third term can be simplified. The first case is when the period of 
the spreading code is one data bit long, that is, a short code. In this case, the third 
term is a deterministic quantity and not a random variable. Therefore, the jammer 
contribution is to the mean and not to the variance. This case has been investigated 
in detail for various data modulation schemes when  is zero [1]. A closed form 
solution for this case will be given when the jammer frequency offset is an integer 
multiple of the bit rate. 
The second case is when the period of the spreading sequence is long and the 
number of chips per bit is large. This case is particularly interesting, as many 
practical systems satisfy this condition. In this case, closed form solutions can be 
obtained for the bit error rate using Gaussian approximations. 
 
10.2.4 Spreading Codes 
 
Jamming performance depends on the length of the spreading code used in DSSS 
systems. A short code repeats itself every one or a few data bits while a long code 
repeats itself over many more data bits. Hence, for the former, L  N while for the 
latter L >> N, where
p /10
10
.
G
N 
 Since the short code sequence is repeated in every 
data bit, and a symbol is either a 1 or 0 for BPSK or a 00, 01, 10, or 11 for QPSK, 
it is relatively easy to recover the code sequence in a short code. Hence, short 
codes are much more vulnerable to ES, and therefore EA, than long codes. In non-
adversarial situations, however, when recovery of the codes is not a concern, short 
codes can be used to advantage. The spreading codes for 3G+ PCS systems, for 
example, are published in the open commercial literature and knowledge of the 
one in use is not an issue at all in commercial applications.

For EW we encounter both short and long codes, and, as we will see, jamming 
performance is not the same for different length codes. We will consider the 
following two cases of interest for urban EW applications: 
 
 
Long period sequences, that is, L is finite and L >> N; 
 
Short period sequences where 
.
L
N

 
 
10.2.4.1 Short Codes [6] 
 
As mentioned above, the length L of a short code sequence is such that one or 
more cycles of the code is contained in each symbol; that is, 
.
L
N

 
It can be shown that for MT jamming, the type of data modulation (BPSK or 
QPSK) yields the same average performance for quadriphase spreading so we will 
discuss only the three cases:  
 
 
Biphase spreading with BPSK and QPSK data modulation; 
 
Biphase spreading with QPSK data modulation; 
 
Quadriphase spreading with BPSK and QPSK data modulation. 
 
As a point of interest for EW, using short codes with DSSS makes such 
signaling quite vulnerable. The military development of DSSS focused on long 
codes since their spread properties are considerably better than short codes. For 
example, techniques are available to automatically determine the spreading code 
when it is repeated within each bit several times, thereby considerably easing the 
difficulties involved with EW. If an EW system can determine the code, the DSSS 
signals can be despread within that system, just as it is despread at the target 
receiver. In addition, with the code known, a jammer can encode the jamming 
signal with that code thereby removing all of the AJ advantages of DSSS. 
However, personal communication systems employing CDMA are not 
designed to avoid intercept or provide for jamming resistance. CDMA is used in 
these systems to increase the spectrum usage, thereby increasing the revenue flow 
for the service provider. Using CDMA with these systems provides other 
advantages as well, such as soft degradation as more users come online; however 
these advantages do not include LPI or AJ.

This function is plotted in Figure 10.5 where the PN sequence has maximal length 
with period Tc and length L chips. The resulting jammer power emerging from the 
decorrelation process is therefore spread over a wide bandwidth and is 
decorrelated with the signal. This jammer signal has the same characteristics as 
AWGN on the DSSS system.  
The PSDs of the PN sequence and the jammer can be approximated by boxcar 
functions shown in Figure 10.6 where AJ = J/WJ and C  1/L. The graphical 
convolution of these PSDs is also shown in Figure 10.6. The resulting signal is

The fundamental property of PN sequences that DSSS systems take advantage 
of is the effect of this spreading of unsynchronized energy in the decorrelation 
process, while simultaneously compressing the synchronized energy down to its 
original bandwidth. These effects are independent of whether the unsynchronized 
energy is noise, is caused by unintentional interference, or caused by intentional 
interference such as a jammer. It is also independent of the type of interfering 
signal. The signal could be BBN, PBN, NBN, or multiple tones [9, 10]. 
For BBN, PBN, and tone jamming, all of which are constantly present, the 
effect of the jamming is to raise the postdetection noise floor. In those cases, 
repeat coding is ineffective at reducing the BER because the coding reduces the 
per symbol energy as Es / m while the postdetection jamming signal is present at 
all frequencies in Wss. There is no benefit achieved by possibly placing a coded 
symbol either at a frequency or a time that does not experience the jamming 
signal. Thus, the effect is simply to reduce the SNR of the data bits, rendering 
jamming more effective and coding ineffective at defeating it. Increasing m simply 
increases the BER. 
Repeat coding against pulsed jamming, on the other hand, can be effective. In 
that case there is a time when the jammer is off and there is a possibility that a 
coded symbol is transmitted when the jammer is off. 
Although signal fading due to frequency-selective channel characteristics can 
affect the BER of DSSS signal, such effects are not analyzed here. The interest 
herein is to ascertain the effects of jamming waveforms. If desired, the effects of 
channel fading can be included [11, 12].

We will consider four types of spreading/modulation schemes and examine 
EW performance against each of them. These are: (1) biphase spreading/BPSK 
data modulation, (2) quadriphase spreading/BPSK data modulation, (3) biphase 
spreading/QPSK data modulation, and (4) quadriphase spreading/QPSK data 
modulation. These phase spreading/modulation techniques all require coherent 
demodulation. While it is possible to implement DSSS systems that are non-
coherent, we assume herein that all the DSSS implementations are coherent. That 
assumption is satisfied by all the DSSS implementations with which we are 
concerned. 
 
Typically postdetection SNRs on the order of 10 dB or higher are required. 
When N ~ 400, the processing gain is about 26 dB, indicating that the RF SNR 
must be about 10 dBm – 26 dB = –16 dB or more. When N ~ 10, the processing 
gain is about 10 dB, indicating an RF SNR of 10 dBm – 10 dB = 0 dB is required. 
Between these values of N, values of required RF SNR will thus vary between –16 
dB to 0 dB.  
 
 
10.4 BBN Jamming of DSSS Systems 
 
BBN jamming of DSSS signals is when the jammer signal is noise with a 
bandwidth approximately the same as the DSSS signal. BBN jamming is

Figure 10.7 BBN jamming of DSSS. 
illustrated in Figure 10.7. It is tacitly assumed that the center frequency of the 
jamming signal is the same as that of the DSSS target. Only hard decision 
decoding with no JSI is considered in this section. 
With multiple users of a DSSS system within range of a single receiver, the 
effects of interference are very similar to AWGN. Techniques have been 
investigated to mitigate this interference and therefore mitigate the effects of BBN 
jamming [13–17]. 
 
From an intuitive point of view, at the target DSSS receiver we know that the 
detector output SNR, SNRo, is increased by Gp. The output signal level is increased 
by Gp while the output noise is not. The decorrelation process does not affect the 
noise, and whatever noise exists at the input will exist at the output of the detector. 
Therefore to use BBN as the jamming technique, the processing gain must be 
overcome in order to put enough noise at the detector output to affect the detection 
process. 
The signal-to-noise plus jamming ratio after the despreading and demodulation 
processes for DSSS receivers, denoted by 0, when the jamming waveform is 
BBN is given by

(10.23) 
 
where R is the signal power received, N0 is the one-sided noise spectral density, 
Wss is the bandwidth of the signal, J is the jamming power at the receiver, and Gp 
is the number of chips per data bit. In this expression it is assumed that the 
receiver noise bandwidth is matched to that of the signal. If Tb denotes the 
baseband data bit duration and Tc denotes the spreading waveform chip duration, 
then Gp, the processing gain, is given by

Wss = 2/Tc from null to null while the 3 dB bandwidth is Wss  0.88/Tc. It is 
frequently assumed that Wss = 1/Tc as we will in the sequel.

Thus, the received SNR is effectively increased by the processing gain of the 
DSSS system. In order to disrupt the signal at the receiver, the jamming signal 
must somehow overcome this processing gain. In addition to the processing gain 

Electronic Warfare and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Systems

to be overcome by the jammer, the effectiveness of a jammer against DSSS 
depends on whether the DSSS signal is error protection coded or not. 
The performance of DSSS systems that are phase modulated with BBN 
jamming is the same as the performance with AWGN only. Thus, [18, 19]

Schilling et al. examined the problem of noise and tone jamming of M-ary 
DSSS systems [20]. In particular they examined the effects of BBN and tone 
jamming on BPSK and QPSK modulated DSSS signals. They defined a parameter 
 as

where Tb is the data bit time. For short codes where the length of the spreading 
sequence is such that the sequence repeats itself within the bit duration (short 
codes, N  L) then, since c(t) is a maximal sequence, there is one more +1 than –1

Therefore  = Ts/L = Tc. For long codes this relationship is not necessarily true, 
and  will depend on the particular properties of c(t). There could be many more 
+1’s than –1’s for example, depending on which part of the sequence is included 
in the data bit. On average, however,  = Tc even for long codes. Therefore they 
assumed  = Tc and we will do that here as well. 
 
10.4.1 BPSK and QPSK 
 
It was established in Chapter 3 that the bit error performance for BPSK and QPSK 
in AWGN are the same. The power per symbol for QPSK is half that for BPSK 
while the symbol duration is twice as long, which ensures that the energy per bit 
for both approaches is the same. For rectangular pulse shapes and BBN jamming 
the bit error performance is given by

of SNR when Gp = 100 (Gp,dB = 20 dB). 
The SNR here includes the noise in Wss. The equivalent narrowband SNR can 
be determined if the despread bandwidth of the data symbol is known. It is given 
by Rs = 1/Ts = WF. Suppose WF = 25 kHz and Wss = 50 MHz. If the spread SNR is 
–20 dB, then the despread SNR is

In the case illustrated in Figure 10.8, the BBN jammer remains relatively 
ineffective until the processing gain (N = 100, 20 dB) is overcome. At that point 
however, Pe  10–1 or higher irrespective of the spread SNR of those considered 
here. 
The jamming performance for BBN as the Gp is varied from Gp = 10 to          
Gp = 1,000 is shown in Figure 10.9 for  = –20 dB. Note that Gp = 100 is 
approximately that for some forms of 3G+ PCS. Increasing the JSR by 10 dB 
improves the jamming performance, as measured by the processing gain 
overcome, by about 3 dB at Pe = 10–1. It is worth noting again, to be fair, that 3G+ 
PCS systems were not designed for antijam performance.  
 
10.4.2 BBN Jamming of Chaotic Systems 
 
The effects of BBN jamming on the chaotic communication systems introduced in 
Section 3.13.5 are similar to those discussed for BPSK and QPSK. The jammer 
produces the equivalent of additional background noise with which the 
communication system must contend. Adding BBN essentially increases the 
background noise throughout the whole spectrum. Chaotic signals are noiselike in 
character, just as DSSS signals. The effects of the various jamming techniques, 
including BBN, would be expected to be similar.

where, as before, J0 is the jammer energy density as if the jammer power were 
spread over the whole spreading bandwidth Wss. Both the jammer energy as well 
as the thermal noise affect performance, although frequently it is assumed that the 
jammer energy is larger than the thermal noise so that the latter can be ignored. 
That is normally the case in the portion of the spectrum covered by WJ but not 
outside this region. It typically takes  > 10 dB for effective communication 
performance and  = 0 dB implies that the jamming signal is 10 dB higher than the 
noise level. Therefore, ignoring the noise in the region of the spectrum covered by 
the jammer is justified. 
Just as for other forms of jamming, techniques have been investigated for 
suppression of the effects of PBN jamming [21, 22]. 
 
Figure 10.10 illustrates the spectra for PBN jamming of DSSS signals. The 
jammer signal could be centered at the center frequency of the signal as shown in 
Figure 10.10(a) or it could be offset as shown in Figure 10.10(b). In fact, it need 
not be contiguous as shown in Figure 10.10 for the following analysis to apply. 
 
If SJ(f) denotes the density function of the jamming signal and that signal is 
Gaussian noiselike, then for BPSK and QPSK the BER is given by [23, 24]

assuming that Rs = WF and inserting Tc = 1/Wss. This function is plotted in Figure 
10.11 versus the processing gain, Gp. Clearly, if the jammer can overcome the 
processing gain of the DSSS system, significant deleterious effects can occur in 
the receiver. When  = –10 dB for  = 10 dB, coding gains less than 13 dB can be 
tolerated while if  = 20 dB, coding gains of over 20 dB are still effective. 
These results are not very sensitive to the SNR level at these levels of JSR. 
The DSSS processing gain when using PBN jamming BPSK or QPSK signals is 3 
dB less than for BBN jamming. Thus, PBN jamming is the preferred choice 
against these signal types.

10.6 Pulse Jamming of DSSS Systems 
 
A pulsed jammer transmits BBN power for a fraction of the time specified by  
and is off for the rest of the time, the fraction of which is 1 – . If a pulsed jammer 
and nonpulsed BBN jammer have the same average power, then the pulsed 
jammer will have a larger peak power since it is not always emitting. The 
bandwidth of the pulse jammer when it is on is assumed to be Wss [25]. As with 
noise jamming, techniques have been examined to mitigate the effects of pulse 
jamming on DSSS systems [26]. 
 
As with any pulsed signaling, including jamming, the receiver characteristics 
are important to evaluate the effectiveness of the jamming waveform. The signal 
must be present long enough for the receiver filters to settle in order for the 
analysis that follows to apply.

This BER is plotted in Figure 10.1, which illustrates the dramatic benefits of 
pulsed BBN jamming over continuous BBN jamming of uncoded BPSK DSSS 
systems. The pulse jammer enjoys about a 15 dB advantage over the BBN barrage 
jammer at a BER of 10–4. At an Es / NT of –3 dB and less, the two jamming 
techniques produce about the same results. Figure 10.13 assumes that the optimum 
pulse width is used.

10.6.2 Pulsed Jamming of Repeat Coded BPSK DSSS Systems 
 
Interleaving the data bits before multiplying by the spreading sequence spreads the 
data bits out over time, usually separated by enough time so that the resulting 
spread data bit chips are independent. With no interleaving and associated 
deinterleaving, the BER performance of repeat-coded BPSK DSSS is the same as 
uncoded [28] and there is no advantage to coding.

where m is the diversity of the code; that is, the number of times the bits are 
repeated. By noting that WJ = Wss, NT = N0 + J0, R = EbRs, PN = N0Wss,                 
Gp = Wss/Rs,  = R/PN,  = J/R, and J = J0WJ, then (10.60) can be expressed in 
terms of power ratios as

lines are without JSI while dotted are with JSI. For m = 1, these curves are the same. In this example,

which is plotted in Figure 10.14 for  = 0.3. The deleterious effects of coding on 
jamming performance at low JSR are evident in Figure 10.14. We should keep in 
mind, however, that when m = 3, the effective data rate reduces to 1/3 what it was 
when uncoded, 1/5 when m = 5, and so forth. The communicator can punch 
through the jamming this way but pays a price for it. 
 
Without JSI the soft decision decoder is basing its decisions on bit reliability 
computed without knowledge of the presence or absence of a jamming signal. 
Other information then is used, such as estimates of the noise level and the channel 
fading characteristics.

which is also plotted in Figure 10.14. 
When the receiver knows the JSI, the pulse jamming performance 
significantly degrades as illustrated in Figure 10.14. For the parameters in this 
example, repeat coding effectively defeats the pulse jamming attempts. At   Pe = 
10–2, without JSI, m = 3 repeat coding degrades JSR performance by about 7 dB 
and m = 5 about 10 dB. With JSI the degradation is even greater. 
 
Jamming performance variation with  is illustrated in Figure 10.15. The JSI 
in this case significantly degrades the jamming performance, even for relatively 
small amounts of coding. 
 
For repeat codes with m symbols per data bit [31], hard decision decoding, 
and unknown jammer state the BER is given by

Pe is plotted in Figures 10.16 for  = 0.3, Gp = 100, and  = –10 dB, although the 
results are essentially independent of the SNR at these levels of jamming. The 
other parameters for this figure are similar to those for 3G+ PCS. Comparing the

decoding. Here, Gp = 100,  = –10 dB, and  = 10 dB. When m = 1, the JSI and no JSI curves are the

curves here with those in Figure 10.14, as expected, jamming performance is 
better against hard decision decoding when JSI is not available.

where  is given by (10.65) and (10.66) without the leading  multiplier. In this 
case the jamming performance decreases somewhat as seen in Figures 10.16 when 
 = 0.3. Again, the variation with  for hard decision decoding is illustrated in 
Figure 10.17. Without JSI there is an optimum  that maximizes Pe; however, 
repeat coding also decreases jammer performance for hard decision decoding. 
 
A comparison of soft decision and hard decision decoding when JSI is not 
available is shown in Figure 10.18 for  = 0.3, Gp,dB = 20 dB, and  = –10 dB. 
Pulsed jammer performance is better against hard decision decoding by about 10 
dB at 10–2 BER when there is no coding (m = 1). With minimal coding (m = 3 in 
this case), Pe never reaches acceptable jamming performance for either decoding 
method. Likewise, pulsed jamming performance is shown in Figure 10.19 for the 
same parameters except  = 0.3. In this  case, as  expected,  jamming performance

10.7 Tone Jamming of DSSS Systems 
 
10.7.1 Introduction 
 
Tone jamming employs one of the easiest waveforms to generate and use. As 
opposed to BBN and PBN jamming discussed previously, tone jamming 
minimizes friendly fratricide so is less likely to lead to objections to its use. This 
section follows [5] closely. 
Tone jamming can employ one or multiple tones. The spectrum when one 
tone is used is illustrated in Figure 10.20 while the spectrum in the case of MT 
jamming is illustrated in Figure 10.21. The jamming tones can be located 
arbitrarily, but some locations produce better results than others. Several 
techniques have been developed as countermeasures for tone jamming of DSSS 
systems [32–42].

jammer, and noise.

1 Modern DSSS receivers are implemented with rake fingers, one finger for each estimated multipath 
component. In order to set the parameters for these fingers, estimates of the time delays for these paths 
are necessary. This information is therefore available anyway for the time delay of any direct path.

We assume that the received noise is band-limited to approximately the signal 
bandwidth, which would be the case in practice due to filtering in the receiving 
chain. We assume an AWGN channel so the noise at the output of the bandpass 
filter is bandlimited Gaussian noise. Since the receiver input noise is n(t), then for 
the in-phase path, the noise at the output of the bandpass filter is

10.7.5 Single-Tone Jamming 
 
In the presence of noise alone, or broadband jamming with equivalent spectral 
density, the performance of coherent spread systems is exactly the same as that of 
their unspread counterparts. That is, the presence of quadriphase or biphase chip 
spreading on BPSK data does not alter the fact that the signals are antipodal, and 
hence the error rate performance is given by

information bit, and N0 is the single-sided noise spectral density. This statement is 
also true for QPSK data modulation. 
The case of single-tone jamming is considered here and MT jamming will be 
investigated in Section 10.7.7. The single-tone jamming notion is illustrated in 
Figure 10.20. For single tone jamming, there are two cases considered here 
depending on the placement of the jamming tone: 
 
 
The jamming signal frequency is the same as the DSSS carrier frequency 
(close to it but not on it—directly on it attenuates the jammer signal 
unnecessarily, see Figure 10.5). 
 
The jamming frequency is offset from the DSSS carrier frequency. 
 
The DSSS signals considered here could have BPSK or QPSK data modulation 
and the spreading can be biphase or quadriphase. In general, the jamming 
effectiveness is dependent on the phase of the jamming signal relative to that of 
the target signal and the resulting probability of a bit error is denoted Pr{e }

where  is that phase difference. To remove this dependency it is necessary to 
average over [0, 2) as

A single-tone jammer places a high power CW tone at some place in the 
frequency spectrum. That place would normally depend on the target and the goal 
would be to optimize that placement in some sense to the jammer’s favor. When 
the jammer is placed within Wss, it is assumed herein that any effects of wideband 
filtering at the receiver have no effect on the jammer signal. In other words it is far 
enough from the filter band edges that this filtering does not attenuate it 
significantly.

When the length of the PN code, L, is large compared to N, the number of 
spreading chips in a data symbol (and therefore equal to the processing gain, Gp), 
those terms preceded by the 1 / L factor can be neglected in (10.86) with little loss 
of generality, which simplifies the Pe expression to [5]

When the modulation is BPSK, then the performance is as indicted by (10.89). In 
the case of  = 0, (10.89) is illustrated in Figure 10.22 for  = –10 dB. 
 
When 
0

the tone can be placed anywhere within Wss. Here, (10.86) 
generates the curves illustrated in Figure 10.23. Again at   Gp, Pe  10–1. Figure 
10.24 illustrates the effects of varying the frequency offset of the jammer tone for 
small processing gain conditions. For Gp,dB = 13 dB, jamming performance 
decreases the further away from f0 the jamming tone is placed. For Gp,dB = 20 dB, 
the jamming performance remains relatively constant irrespective of how far away 
the tone is placed. 
 The average probability of error is calculated using (10.85). For coherent 
target links, assuming a uniform PDF for  in (10.85) may not be a good 
approximation. The phase is likely to be correlated from one symbol to the next.

The performance of biphase spreading and BPSK data depends on the relative

10.7.5.2 Biphase Spreading BPSK Data Modulation: Short Codes 
 
If L ~ N, then the Gaussian approximation is not valid even though N >> 1 because 
k1, the number of ―one‖ chips in a bit interval, is not independent bit by bit. 
Therefore, kl is not an r.v. but a deterministic quantity.

JSR. (After: [5]. © 1983 IEEE. Reprinted with permission.) 
 
As illustrated in Figure 10.5, on-tune jamming (0) is not the best place 
to put a jammer tone due to the severe attenuation of the tone there. It would be 
better to place the jammer at a frequency 1/Ts higher or lower than at the carrier 
frequency. In that case the contribution of the jammer to the decision is 
proportional to (L+1)/L2 ~ 1/L rather than 1/L2. In general, if the jammer is off-
tuned by a multiple l of the data bit rate, then

while for N = 128, about 15 dB more jamming power is required.

This function is also illustrated in Figure 10.22. Note that this Pe is now 
independent of the jammer phase. 
 
At low JSR, for BPSK data modulation, single-tone jamming is more 
effective on biphase spreading than on quadriphase spreading. Where   Gp, this 
reverses and it becomes more effective against quadriphase. In addition, note that 
at this SNR, and lower values as well, Pe  10–1 when   Gp. At high JSRs          
( > 10 dB or so), the jamming performance is almost independent of the SNR. 
The case when 
0

 is also illustrated in Figure 10.23. The effects of 
varying the tone frequency offset from the DSSS carrier frequency are the same as 
for biphase spreading shown in Figure 10.24.

From (10.112) it is clear that if 
(e )
P
 is averaged over  [0, 2) using (10.85), 
then biphase spreading and quadriphase spreading both provide the same 
performance for BPSK data encoding. On the other hand, for a coherent jammer  
( = 0o), quadriphase spreading has a 3 dB advantage over the biphase spreading. 
These results are plotted in Figure 10.28 for N = 4, 32, and 64. If we accept

 the spreading provides little to no AJ protection, although, to be fair, the

The cases for both  and

are illustrated in Figure 10.23. The effects 
of offsetting the jammer tone from the DSSS center frequency are not significant 
in this case. 
Employing (10.85) with (10.119), the cases for l = 1 and 10 are illustrated in 
Figure 10.29. Since the frequency offset from the carrier (or IF) is given by l/Ts, 
when l = 1 the tone offset was at the first offset position, and when l = 10, the 
jammer tone was at the tenth. In neither case was there a jammer tone at the target 
center frequency. The effects of offsetting the jammer tone from the DSSS center 
frequency are not significant. 
If the conditions similar to those discussed in (10.90) are satisfied, then for

Using (10.85), the curves generated by this function are nearly identical to the 
corresponding curves in Figure 10.22; Pe is slightly larger for higher JSR values 
(above about 25 dB). 
Comparing (10.86) and (10.119), we see that an offtuned jammer is as 
effective against biphase spread/BPSK data and biphase spread/QPSK data when 
L >> N. 
 
10.7.5.6 Quadriphase Spreading and QPSK Data Modulation: Long Codes 
 
When L >> N the type of spreading for QPSK data modulation makes no 
difference. Therefore the results are the same as for BPSK, (10.119).

single jammer tone was derived by Lau et al. [45].  
 
10.7.6.1 Coherent Reception

Here, f is the normalized jammer frequency given by f = fJTb where fJ is the actual 
jammer frequency and Tb is the bit time. This BER is illustrated in Figure 10.31 
for representative values. For all values of SNR considered in the example shown 
in Figure 10.31, Pe rises above 10–1 around 0 dB JSR. 
 
10.7.7 Multitone Jamming  
 
If the jammer employs MT, then (10.86), (10.107), and (10.119) can still be used 
to calculate the BER. For a NJ tone jammer, (10.107) with L >> N (10.107) can be 
modified to 
 
Figure 10.30 BER for Chaotic coherent CSKJ communication system. In this example 2 = 200 and
the normalized jamming frequency is 3.12735. (After: [45]. © IEEE, 2002. Reprinted with

The same conclusion also holds for biphase spreading and BPSK data and 
quadriphase spreading and QPSK data encoding. These conclusions are for the 
case when the terms corresponding to 1/L are dropped in (10.107) and (10.119). 
The results are not the same for short codes where off-tuning by 1/Ts produces 
better results. 
  
When MT jamming tones are used as the jamming waveform against BPSK 
DSSS signals, results ensue that are the same as partial band jamming discussed 
previously. This is based on assuming that the output of the DSSS despreader at 
the receiver is Gaussian noise. 
The notion is illustrated in Figure 10.21. Five equal amplitude and equally 
spaced tones, centered on and symmetric around f0 are shown in Figure 10.21(a). 
The more general case of three unequal amplitude and unequally spaced tones 
asymmetric around f0 is illustrated in Figure 10.21(b). Milstein, Davidovice, and 
Schilling examined the effects of multiple tones on DSSS signals [44]. 
The development in Section 10.7.5 can be extended to the case when there are 
multiple tones arbitrarily spaced within the DSSS signal. Those extensions are 
presented in this section. Let 
n
J denote the power of the nth jammer tone at the 
receiver, fn denote the frequency difference between the nth jammer tone and the 
DSSS carrier frequency, and n denote the phase differences. Furthermore suppose 
there are NJ jammer tones present. 
In the case of multiple tones, the jammer power is split into some number of 
channels, and the power per channel is therefore reduced. We will assume here 
that the same total power results irrespective of the number of jammed channels. 
Figure 10.21 illustrates the notion of multiple tone jammer channels. 
For L >> N and including the effects of phase offsets, it is necessary to average 
over (0, 2), for each k . Thus

These results are illustrated in Figure 10.32 for BPSK data modulation and 
biphase spreading when NJ = 1 compared with NJ = 3. The MT jamming 
performance is lower than single tone because the power per tone is 1/3 that for 
the single tone, although at Pe > 10–1 the differences are insignificant. The effect of 
averaging over the phase offset is to decrease the effectiveness of the jamming. In 
this example, at  = 10 dB, Pe reduces from 0.006 to 0.007 as NJ is increased from 
1 to 3. 
When the effects of the phase difference between the jammer tones and the 
target signal are ignored, the BER from (10.86), (10.111), and (10.107) all produce 
the same result for MT jamming given by

where the total jamming power at the receiver is held constant. This function is 
illustrated in Figure 10.33 for  = –10 dB, Gp = 20 dB, and Tb = 100 s. For this 
illustration, the tones are placed at multiples of 1/Tb, and the multiples start at zero 
and go up. Therefore there is always a tone at zero offset, if there is a tone at 2/Tb 
then there is a tone at zero and 1/Tb as well, and so forth. So with a single tone, Pe 
does not reach 10–1 until the spreading gain is overcome. With multiple tones, 
however, Pe = 10–1 is reached at lower values of JSR. For example, when NJ = 10, 
Pe = 10–1 is achieved at  = 10 dB, an improvement of 10 dB.

10.7.7.4 Multitone Jamming of Biphase or Quadriphase Spreading and BPSK Data 
Modulation Long and Short Codes 
 
Chen derived some results for BPSK spreading/BPSK data modulation and QPSK 
spreading/BPSK data modulation in the presence of multiple jammers [2]. The 
results for the two cases, as expected, are the same. In addition there was no 
assumption about PN code length in the development of the BER so this approach 
works for long as well as short codes. The only requirement is that the noise is 
Gaussian. 
The BER is given by

 
On-tune jammer, short code; 
 
Jammer off-tune by 1/Ts, short code; 
 
Long (random) code. 
 
In all cases, the number of chips per symbol, N, is 31. These results indicate that if 
the jammer is offtuned by one symbol rate, the jamming performance against short 
codes is much better than if the jammer were ontune, and is in fact comparable to 
performance with the biphase long code. This effect is due primarily to the 
suppression of the signal when the jammer is ontuned as illustrated in Figure 10.5. 
We might draw the conclusion from Figure 10.35 that short codes are 
preferable to long codes where the jammer is offtuned by the bit rate. This 
conclusion, however, overlooks the serious vulnerability of systems employing 
short codes. It is reasonably straightforward for an EW system to discover a short 
code that is sent repeatedly. The target loses all AJ processing gain against this 
jamming strategy. Therefore, short codes can be (and are) used in many non-
adversarial spread-spectrum systems such as ranging and CDMA systems. Long 
codes are necessary if vulnerability to EW is a consideration. 
 
10.7.9 Summary 
 
Analytical expressions for the BER performance of a DSSS system have been 
derived for a tone jammer with an arbitrary frequency offset. From these results it 
can be shown that BPSK and QPSK data provide the same performance for long 
period sequences. Quadriphase chip spreading provides 2–3 dB better performance 
than biphase chip spreading for the long period sequences. These results are 
generalized for MT jammers. For moderate length sequences (longer than one 
symbol but not much longer), the BER will depend on a particular spreading 
sequence and will be different for different spreading sequences because the 
random effects do not average out. 
 
 
10.8 Concluding Remarks 
 
The effectiveness of the principal types of jamming on DSSS signals was 
presented in this chapter along with some illustrative examples using typical 
parameters. These types include BBN jamming, PBN jamming, pulsed jamming, 
and tone jamming. The last of these includes both single tone jamming and MT 
jamming.

Only PSK modulations were discussed. That is because BPSK and QPSK are 
the most prolific types of modulations for DSSS systems. The latter includes offset 
QPSK and MSK, both of which exhibit reduced sidelobe levels in the frequency 
domain, which reduces the interference caused in nearby frequency channels. 
They do, however, increase the amount of ISI in general (which is a function of 
timing). 
Repeat coding is ineffective against all but pulsed jamming because for 
jammer signals that are steadily present, the decorrelation process in a DSSS 
receiver converts the jammer signal to a post-detection signal that has AGWN 
properties and the noise floor is effectively raised by the detection process. The 
jammer noise is spread across all frequencies and all time so that there is no place 
where the communication signal can avoid the jammer signal. Therefore, for fixed 
signal power, the energy per bit is decreased with repeat coding thereby increasing 
the jammer effectiveness. For pulsed jamming, there are times when the jammer 
signal is not present so the possibility exists to receive a data symbol that is 
degraded by thermal noise only. 
The length of the spreading code in the DSSS system affects the ability to jam. 
Short codes, which repeat themselves after one or a few data bits, are quite 
vulnerable to attempts to ascertain the underlying code sequence, which, in some 
cases such as PCS, is not a problem. In situations where the DSSS coding is used 
for LPI or AJ purposes, however, the vulnerability of short codes cannot be 
tolerated. This is true for most military applications. Long codes, which repeat 
themselves after many data bits, are far less vulnerable. 
Whereas for PBN, placing the center of the jammed band at the center of the 
DSSS signal is optimum; exactly the opposite is true for MT jamming. A tone 
placed at the DSSS center frequency suffers severe attenuation by the 
decorrelation process.

Electronic Warfare and Fast Frequency 
Hopping Systems 
 
 
11.1 Introduction 
 
FFHSS systems, where there is one or more hop dwells per data bit, were devised 
as a countermeasure to follower ES and EA systems. If the hopping is fast enough, 
depending on the physical relationship of the communication transmitter and 
receiver relative to the placement of the jammer, the signal will have moved onto 
the next hop frequency before the jamming signal arrives at the receiver, thereby 
making following jamming ineffective. This chapter presents the performance of 
follower jamming, BBN jamming, PBN jamming, and MT jamming of FFHSS 
systems, while Chapter 12 presents jamming performance for SFHSS systems with 
these same techniques [1–6]. 
In general, the type of jammer that performs best for SFHSS targets is 
different from that used against fast frequency hopping targets. Whereas following 
jamming can be rendered ineffective by hopping faster, follower jamming can be 
very effective against SFHSS. 
 
In this analysis it is assumed that the jammer knows all of the pertinent target 
parameters except the hopping code. Thus, the hopping band, the channel 
information such as bandwidth, center frequencies, the location of the bandpass 
filters relative to the channel center frequencies, the bit rate, the symbol rate, and 
any coding that is applied, are all known parameters. Most of the time, several, but 
not all, of these parameters will be known. What is not known must be measured 
from the signals received by the associated ES system. 
 
This chapter is structured as follows. We begin by discussing the channel 
structure for FFHSS signals. That is followed by a brief review of the receiver 
architecture used for intercept of FFHSS systems and what the implications are for 
intercepting multiple hops per data bit. We then cover the performance of BBN 
jamming of these signals. Follower jamming performance is covered next, 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

followed by the performance analysis of PBN jamming. Next we discuss tone 
jamming performance. The chapter concludes with a brief review of the 
performance of pulsed jamming against FFHSS systems. 
 
 
11.2 Channel Structure 
 
The channel structure with the jammer present is shown in Figure 11.1. Depending 
on the jamming strategy, the shaded region would change, of course. Figure 11.1 
illustrates partial-band contiguous jamming. In this chapter, a channel is defined as 
the portion of the spectrum containing a single MFSK data tone. This is not the 
normal definition, where a channel is defined as the portion of the spectrum within 
which the entire modulated signal is located. The individual channel structure is 
shown in Figure 11.2 for BFSK. The two tone frequencies representing the mark 
and space are normally located in the center of the bands symmetrically on either

side of the frequency f0. We will assume such a channel structure herein, although 
in practice the two channels need not be adjacent (although they normally are). 
Only noncoherent FFHSS systems will be considered herein. This is the most 
prolific form of FFHSS system. Whereas it is not difficult to build SFHSS systems 
that are coherent within a dwell, it is difficult to maintain coherency as the 
synthesizers in the transmitter and receiver change over large frequency spans for 
either SFHSS or FFHSS systems. It is possible to construct coherent FFHSS 
systems, however. For those interested in how effective jammers can be against 
coherent systems, [7–13] should be consulted. 
Another area that is not addressed herein are the effects of fading on FFHSS 
systems. Fading impacts the BER of these systems, however [14–18]. Such fading 
is normally frequency dependent and as such is somewhat mitigated by FFHSS 
systems since multiple frequencies are used for each data bit. 
There are two practical waveforms to use for follower jamming FFHSS 
systems: narrowband noise and tones. In either case, the detected tone channel 
could be jammed, the complementary channel could be jammed, or both could be 
jammed. As will be shown, when using either narrowband noise or tones above    
  0 dB, the complementary channel must be jammed because placing additional 
energy only at the detected tone channel enhances the receiver’s ability to properly 
detect the signal. 
There are two particular effects that must be considered with FFHSS systems. 
The first is the effects of multiple dwells per data bit. Simply causing one dwell to 
be received in error does not ensure that the data bit will be detected in error since 
there are other dwells for that data bit. The second consideration, not unique to 
FFHSS but still noteworthy, is the effect of only jamming parts of dwells, either 
individually or parts of the set corresponding to a data bit. This latter condition can 
arise in three cases:  
 
 
In follower jamming when the signal must first be detected in order to be 
jammed; 
 
In partial band noise jamming when only a portion of the spectrum is 
covered by the jammer at any given time; 
 
In partial band MT jamming when multiple tones are placed in the 
spectrum but not every data tone frequency contains a jamming signal. 
 
 
11.3 Receiver Architecture 
 
For simplicity, this analysis is restricted to BFSK systems. The receiver structure 
for noncoherent FFHSS BFSK considered here is shown in Figure 11.3. This is a 
hard decision receiver in that statistics about the detection process are not used in 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
600
the decision as to which symbol was sent. It is also possible to consider soft 
decision decoding where the detection statistics are taken into account [19–28]. 
The incoming signal somewhere in bandwidth Wss is first frequency converted to 
some convenient center frequency and then filtered by a bandpass filter of width W 
Hz. These operations have no effect on the analysis. Next, the signal is mixed with 
a local oscillator that is tuned to the correct center frequency where the signal is 
located. It is assumed that the local pseudo-random code generator and time 
epochs are in sync with those at the transmitter. Offset from that frequency are the 
two tone frequencies f1 and f2, the former representing a space and the latter a 
mark. Passing through both bandpass filters is noise and possibly a jamming 
signal. Passing through one of the filters is also the signal at that instant. The filter 
outputs are then detected with a square law device and then sampled forming the 
sampled signals r1k and r2k, k = 1, 2, …, LF. These statistical variables are summed 
from one to LF. The mark sum is subtracted from the space sum forming test 
statistic z. If z if less than zero a mark is declared and if z is greater than zero a 
space is declared. 
 
 
11.4 Multiple Dwells Per Data Bit 
 
For FFHSS, there are LF hops per data bit and the probability of receiving a data 
bit in error is determined by receiving over half of the individual dwells in error. 
Therefore, there will be a data bit detection error if

A majority of the dwells need to be detected correctly in order to correctly 
detect the data bit. Because of the memoryless channel assumption, the probability 
of correctly detecting a majority of dwells is given by

11.5 BBN Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
Like DSSS, in BBN jamming against FFHSS systems, the background noise in all 
channels is raised by the level of the jammer noise power density. The 
communication performance, and therefore the effectiveness of the jammer, can be 
determined in the same way as for noise only, with the jammer power added to the 
noise power. 
The analysis of the effectiveness follows that in Section 3.11 with the noise 
level adjusted to be NT = N0 + J0, where J0 is the amount of noise jamming power 
per Hertz added by the jammer. This is true for both coded and uncoded signals.  
In this case,  = 1. The probability of correctly detecting a data bit per dwell is

This jamming performance for BBN jamming is illustrated in Figures 11.4 and 
11.5 for LF = 1 and LF = 3, respectively. In the former, Pe > 10–1 for  > –5 dB 
when  = 20 dB and  > –7 dB when  = 10 dB. For lower values of the JSR the 
difference in SNR becomes more apparent. When LF = 3, the corresponding JSR is

Milstein et al. analyzed the effects of BBN jamming on FFHSS systems when 
these FHSS systems employed representative coding [8]. Their results indicate that 
for NJ = 100 frequency channels out of Nc = 1,000 covered by the jammer and with 
 = 10 dB, a (23, 12) Golay code when N = 521 of the 1,000 channels were used 
for hopping degrades jamming performance by about 3 dB, and a (7, 4) Hamming 
code when N = 571 channels degrades jamming performance by about 2 dB at this 
same BER. Increasing the JSR to 30 dB totally negated the effects of coding and 
the BER was maintained above 10–1. When  = 30 dB the codes were beyond the 
point where error extension sets in for these codes. Achieving these levels of JSR, 
however, is difficult when the receiver employs limiters prior to detection. 
 
 
11.6 Follower Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
It is possible to employ a follower jammer against FFHSS systems. The necessary 
speed to perform the sorting and tracking exacerbates the problem, however. For 
any scenario, it is possible to determine a hop rate for which follower jamming 
cannot be effective because the transmitter (and receiver) have moved to the next 
frequency before the jammer can put energy into the receiver [29–32]. 
 
Follower jamming performance equations were presented in Chapter 4. Those 
results are used in this section to examine the expected performance of jamming 
techniques against FFHSS targets. 
The question naturally arises whether it is better to jam one, two, or three 
channels. Furthermore, if only one frequency is jammed, which should it be: the 
detected channel or one of those adjacent to it? If two are jammed, which two: the 
detected channel along with an adjacent channel or the two adjacent channels? If 
all three are jammed then it is clear which channels are jammed. The lower the 
number of channels jammed, the more power can be delivered in the jammed 
channels while for more jammed channels, the power per channel is less. Figure 
11.6 shows a comparison of one channel versus three based on

Recall that  is the fraction of a dwell that is jammed by the follower jammer. 
From Figure 11.6 it is clear that in this case jamming one channel is better, even 
though the probability of hitting the correct channel is less, although for Pe > 10–1

the differences are not large. These results are illustrative; however, they are 
relatively insensitive to variations in the SNR. 
 
11.6.1 Follower/NBN Jamming 
 
The follower/NBN jamming performance is based on (11.1), (11.3), and (11.6) 
with the probability of a data bit error on each dwell as given in Table 11.1. Figure 
11.7 shows comparisons of the jamming performance when  = 10 dB,  = 0.1, 
and LF = 1. Pdata refers to jamming only the data channel, Pcomp refers to jamming a 
single adjacent channel, which may or may not be the complementary channel, P2 
refers to jamming 2 channels, one of which is the data channel, Padj refers to 
jamming the 2 channels adjacent to the data channel, and P3 refers to jamming all 
three channels. For the values of SNR illustrated and only 10% of the hop 
jammed, the BER does not reach the goal of 10–1 for any jamming method. 
Jamming a single adjacent channel (the complementary channel half the time) 
produced the best jamming results, leveling to BER of about 5  10–2 at about  = 
10 dB. 
When the fraction of hop jammed is increased to  = 0.3, the results in Figure 
11.8 ensue. Again, it is illustrated that jamming the data channel alone is not 
effective at  > 0 dB, but jamming the complementary channel achieves an 
acceptable BER at 
4dB.

The effects of increasing the number of hop dwells per data bit are 
illustrated next. The results are shown in Figure 11.9 for when the jammed fraction 
 = 0.1 and LF = 3. Within the ranges considered, only the complementary channel 
jammer produced errors approaching 10–2. Clearly, increasing the diversity is an 
effective countermeasure to EA. 
When the jammed fraction  = 0.3, the results improved somewhat as shown in 
Figure 11.10. The BER never rises to 10–1 but levels to about 6  10–2 at   15 dB 
for complementary channel jamming. The other jamming approaches barely

produce Pe > 10–2. For more reasonable level of JSR (around 0 dB), no method 
procduces Pe > 10–2. 
When the SNR is increased to 20 dB, for  = 0.1 and LF = 1, the calculated 
performance is as shown in Figure 11.11. Comparing this with Figure 11.7, at 
lower jamming levels the BER decrease. Above about   0 dB, the BER is not 
very sensitive to the SNR. 
Comparing Figure 11.12 with Figure 11.8, the same conclusions can be 
reached. The jamming performance is not very dependent on the SNR above         
  0 dB or so. Above   5 dB, the BER rises above 10–1 for jamming the 
complementary channel, and the other methods approach 10–1 for large levels of 
jamming.  
Figure 11.13 shows the jamming performance when the signal  = 20 dB,        
 = 0.1, and LF = 3. The larger number of dwells per data bit decreases the jammer 
performance by almost an order of magnitude, keeping the data throughput above 
2 × 10–2. That performance loss is regained, however, if the dwell fraction is raised 
to 0.3 as illustrated in Figure 11.14. None of the jamming techniques produces an 
adequate BER, however. 
The energy detector at the receiver makes a judgment as to which tone was 
sent depending on the amount of energy emerging from the filters. Placing noise 
energy in the data channel without placing it in the complementary channel still 
effectively increases the energy in that channel, thereby enhancing the receiver’s 
ability to correctly determine the tone that was sent and, therefore, data channel 
jamming is ineffective. 
Therefore, one conclusion for narrowband noise jamming is that jamming one 
of the adjacent channels (either one, one of which will be the complementary 
channel half the time) produces the highest BER in most cases. Also, it is 
important to jam as much of the hop as possible, especially if the FFHSS system 
employs diversity. Above a JSR around zero, the BFSK signal performance with 
jamming present is not very sensitive to the SNR level. 
 
11.6.2 Follower/Tone Jamming 
 
 
The expressions for the BER with tone jamming are given by (11.1), (11.3), and 
(11.6) with the error rate per dwell as specified in Table 11.2. Comparisons of 
follower jamming approaches with tone jamming are shown in Figures 11.15 
through 11.23. When  = 10 dB,  = 0.1, and LF = 1 dwell per data bit, the results 
are shown in Figure 11.15. At lower values of JSR, the strategy of jamming both 
the data channel and one of the complementary channels is best. Even jamming 
the data channel alone is a reasonable approach. But as the JSR increases past 
about 1 dB, jamming one of the adjacent channels produces the best jamming

performance. The effects of jamming just the data channel are pronounced in these 
results and should be avoided unless it is known that the JSR is weak, under which 
circumstance that strategy produces reasonable results. 
 
The results for the same SNR and LF but with the jammed fraction increased 
to 0.3 are shown in Figure 11.16. Again, adequate performance starts at 
approximately 1 dB JSR for the best strategies of those considered. For larger JSR, 
jamming one of the two adjacent channels produces the highest BER. Above   3 
dB, Pe is higher than 10–1 for all strategies except jamming the data channel only. 
At high JSR, any of the strategies would be adequate for data signals. At low JSR, 
even jamming the data channel produces positive jamming results. 
 
When the SNR is 10 dB, the jamming fraction is 10%, and the number of 
hops per data bit is 3, considerable jamming degradation occurs as shown in 
Figure 11.17. A BER of 1% is about all that any of the strategies could 
accomplish, with most of them significantly worse than that. This is further 
evidence that follower jamming against FFHSS systems when LF > 1 is largely 
unproductive when the fraction of dwell jammed is low. Jamming performance 
improves considerably when the fraction increases, however, as shown in Figure 
11.18. Even at LF = 3, the BER increases beyond 10–1 when jamming the adjacent 
channels at JSR above about 5 dB. 
The results for when  = 20 dB,  = 0.1, and LF = 1 are shown in Figure 11.19. 
Even with no diversity the BER never rises to 10–1 for any jamming strategy. 
Above   0 to 5 dB, all viable approaches settle to Pe  4  10–2. For the same 
SNR, increasing the spectrum fraction to 0.3 significantly improved the jamming 
performance as illustrated in Figure 11.20. In that case, around 0 dB, jamming the 
complementary channel was effective. 
 
As expected, when diversity was added to the signal the jamming 
performance degrades as shown in Figure 11.21. The BER of 10–1 was not 
achieved with any of the jamming approaches. Much of the jamming performance  
returned, however, when  = 0.3, with the adjacent channel performance rising 
above 10–1 around 3 dB as seen in Figure 11.22. 
 
11.6.3 Summary for Follower Jamming 
 
Comparing Figures 11.7 through 11.14 for NBN jamming with corresponding 
Figures 11.15 through 11.22, it is evident that, at least theoretically, when 
jamming one of the two adjacent channels, the performance on NBN and tone 
jamming are about the same. For the other approaches to follower jamming, using 
tones is somewhat more effective for like parameters. This effectiveness manifests 
in the jammer’s ability to produce a higher BER with a specific JSR.

Around the critical region where   0 dB, jamming the complementary channel is 
the best all-around approach. 
For high SNR, the transition from low to high BER occurs more sharply for 
tone jamming, although the ultimate BER achieved is about the same. This is a 
disadvantage for the tone jammer because the transition from being in a jam 
condition to no-jam occurs over a very narrow range of JSR. Since the NBN 
performance falls off more slowly, the jamming performance degrades more 
gracefully. 
The deleterious effects of increasing the frequency diversity in FFHSS systems 
can be addressed by increasing the dwell coverage fraction. For a given 
operational configuration this can only be accomplished by decreasing the 
processing time since the signal propagation speed is fixed. If the jammer is 
mobile (as on a UAS for example) it can be moved closer to the path between the 
transmitter and receiver to gain some speed benefits, however. 
 
 
11.7 PBN Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
PBN jamming signals are also useful for jamming FFHSS systems. A dwell is 
jammed when it hops into the part of the spectrum containing the jamming 
Figure 11.22 Comparison of the jamming strategies for follower jamming with tone jamming 
waveforms,  = 20 dB,  = 0.3, LF = 3. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

waveform, although this does not necessarily cause that dwell to be detected in 
error. Likewise, when the dwell hops into a part of the spectrum that is not 
jammed, the thermal noise can still cause a detection error even though there is no 
jamming signal present. Note that, as discussed in Chapter 4, the portion of the 
spectrum being jammed with PBN need not be contiguous for these results to 
apply. 
While the jammer will move the bands being jammed around in the spectrum 
to avoid countermeasures by the communication system, such as precluding 
hopping to that portion, in general this movement is neither associated with the 
pattern nor timing of the hopped system. Compared with the FFHSS hop timing, 
changing the location of the PBN signal is relatively slow. 
 
11.7.1 Uncoded Signals 
 
PBN jamming of uncoded FFHSS signals will be considered here. The partial 
band jammer occupies the bandwidth shown in Figure 11.1, which is a fraction of 
the whole bandwidth. The total hop bandwidth is given by Wss while the jammer 
bandwidth is given by WJ. 
The PBN method of jamming a FFHSS system is illustrated in Figure 11.1 for 
LF = 4 hops per bit. During a single data bit interval, the transmitter and receiver 
change frequencies LF = 4 times at equal intervals T seconds long. The specific 
frequencies will depend on whether a mark or space is transmitted. In the next bit 
interval four (probably) distinct frequencies are chosen. 
Lee et al. [33] performed a general analysis of the performance of an FFHSS 
system with PBN jamming using square-law detectors and noncoherent combining 
of the decisions per hop. The detector structure analyzed by Lee et al. is shown in 
Figure 11.3. The following is a simplified analysis of PBN that applies to the same 
receiver structure and will serve the purpose here. There will be an error detecting 
a dwell if the SNR and JSR parameters are appropriate and the dwell lands within 
the portion of the spectrum being jammed. The fraction of the spectrum jammed is

when it is assumed that TcWF = 1. 
 
At high enough signal levels and low enough jamming power, an optimum 
value of  is discernable that maximizes the BER. This can be seen in Figures 
11.23 and 11.24 where the BER is plotted versus  when the  = 10 and 20 dB and 
LF = 4. The peaks of these curves is the optimum jamming value for . 
Unfortunately, for reasonable values of JSR for the SNRs considered here, that 
optimum  is 1, implying BBN jamming.

In the low VHF band (30–90 MHz, 25 kHz channels), there are approximately 
2,400 channels. Jamming 10% of them results in jamming 240 channels while 
jamming 30% results in jamming 720 channels. In the UHF frequency band (225–
400 MHz, 50 kHz channels) there are 3,500 channels. In that case 10% amounts to 
350 channels while 30% amounts to 1,050 channels. Noise jamming easily causes 
friendly fratricide, be it BBN or PBN. Jamming such large portions of the 
spectrum could only be applied under special circumstances due to this fratricide.  
 
11.7.2 Error Coded Signals 
 
When the FHSS signals employ error coding some degradation in jamming 
performance will occur. This is illustrated in Figure 11.25 for a few typical error-
correcting codes. For  = 10 dB, the error correcting codes considered here 
degrade jamming performance by between 1 and 3 dB at Pe = 10–2. When              
 = 30 dB, however, the codes are in the error extension region and Pe  10–1 for 
all the SNRs considered [34–36]. Such a large JSR is difficult to achieve, 
however, due to the signal limiters that are normally employed prior to the 
detectors in FHSS systems. 
 
11.7.3 Narrowband Noise Jamming 
 
When the bandwidth of the jammer signal matches that of the channel, jamming 
can still be effective. The FFHSS signal must hop into that channel, however. The 
performance is illustrated in Figure 11.26 for this case. Shown there are BER for 
uncoded as well as coded signals. 
Against uncoded signals the BER falls fast with this jamming approach even 
when  = 30 dB because of the low probability of the FFHSS signal encountering 
the jamming signal. 
 
 
11.8 Single-Tone Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
Single-tone jamming was examined by Milstein et al. [8] against uncoded and 
coded FHSS systems. For single-tone jamming, example results are shown in 
Figure 11.27. Such a strategy places all the jammer power at a single frequency. 
At best, this strategy will jam a single data bit, and that is when LF = 1. For any   
LF > 1, the data bit is susceptible to only thermal noise at any other frequency. 
Single-tone jamming, therefore, is not a viable technique and is not used for 
FFHSS systems.

11.9 Multiple-Tone Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
MT jamming can be effective against FFHSS signals. The jamming tones are 
placed at NJ frequencies. For simplicity, it is assumed that the possible locations of 
the hopping tones in the spectrum are known, even though the hop sequence is not. 
This assumption would typically be satisfied in practice. When the jammer hops to 
one of these frequencies with a data tone, that tone is actually enhanced by the 
jammer and detection performance at the receiver is improved. The advantage of 
MT jamming occurs when the tone is placed so that the complementary channel 
associated with a hop receives the jammer energy. In that case, the jamming 
effectiveness is a function of SNR and JSR at the receiver [8, 37]. 
 
As in PBN jamming, the multiple tones need not be contiguous. In addition, 
the jammer would typically change the frequency of the tones periodically to 
avoid countermeasures by the transmitter and receiver. 
 
For completeness, it should be noted that generating multiple tones with a 
single high-power amplifier at a jammer is not necessarily the best method of 
providing jamming signals. It can be shown that the power per tone when doing so 
decreases approximately as the square of the number of such tones generated [37]. 
Thus, the efficiency of the jammer is compromised.

11.9.1 Uncoded FFHSS MFSK Signals 
 
FFHSS signals are, by definition, frequency diversity coded since a single data bit 
is transmitted on several hop dwells. Therefore, the advantages of this coding as 
discussed in Section 3.13.3.2 and in this chapter are present in all FFHSS signaling 
schemes. Hence, when coding is discussed for such signals, other forms of coding 
are implied. This will be discussed in Section 11.9.2. 
For MT jamming, the jamming tones are fixed in the spectrum. For uncoded 
FFHSS signals, a bit error will occur when the dwell lands in a channel if the 
dwell hits the complementary channel of that data channel. If the dwell hits the 
data channel, the detection performance of the receiver is enhanced because the 
jammer tone energy adds to that of the data tone. The data tone and 
complementary tone need not be contiguous in this case. 
 Let Nc denote the number of channels in Wss. The fraction of the channels 
jammed is given by

11.9.2 Error-Coded FFHSS MFSK Signals 
 
The types of coding applicable to FFHSS signals, other than frequency diversity 
coding, in general, are the same available for other digital modulations. 
Convolutional and block coding techniques discussed in Section 3.4 apply here as 
well. 
 
 
 
11.10 Pulsed Jamming of FFHSS Systems 
 
Pulsed jamming is not as effective against FFHSS systems as it is against the 
DSSS systems discussed in Chapter 10. PBN jamming has similar effects on 
FFHSS systems that pulsed has on DSSS [39]. 
 
 
11.11 Concluding Remarks 
 
Various techniques for jamming FFHSS signals were presented in this chapter. In 
addition to BBN, follower jamming using NBN and tones, as well as PBN and MT 
jamming were discussed. Jamming the synchronization process in FFHSS systems 
is also possible, and some discussion on the significance of doing this was 
included. 
A comparison of BBN, PBN, and multitone jamming against FFHSS systems 
is shown in Figure 11.28 for  = 0.1 and LF = 1. For this comparison, it is assumed 
that the hop rate, Rh, is numerically equal to the noise filter bandwidth in the 
receiver so that TcWF = 1. It is also assumed that for PBN jamming, the optimal 
jamming fraction is used by the jammer.  
Recall that in the far positive region of SNR for uncoded BFSK and for the 
optimum fraction in PBN jamming, the BER falls off linearly as the SNR 
increases, yielding a significant advantage to the jammer. In the region of interest 
for successful jamming, however, no such advantage exists for PBN jamming. 
BBN jamming in the region of positive JSRs is the better strategy, ceteris paribus, 
when  = 0.1 and LF = 1. 
When  is increased to 0.3, both PBN and MT jamming improves as illustrated 
in Figure 11.29. Of course BBN jamming is not changed. In this case, PBN with a

JSR greater than about 3 dB provides successful jamming, irrespective of the 
SNR. MT jamming, while better than when  = 0.1, still does not achieve the 10–1 
BER goal. 
On the other hand, when LF is increased to 3, BBN jamming improves while 
the other two worsen, as illustrated in Figures 11.30 and 11.31. BBN gets better 
because there is less signal energy per tone since the available energy is spread 
over multiple (3 in this case) tones. Neither value of  is sufficient to provide 
successful jamming when frequency diversity is included in the signaling scheme. 
For the ranges of variables considered here, when the SNR is relatively low 
and the processing gain marginal, the MT technique rises to a better Pe faster than 
the other two, but at higher JSRs (above about 10 dB), the other two are better. 
MT jamming is the better approach for higher SNR and better processing gain. In 
both cases of MT jamming, the goal of a 10–1 BER is almost reached at   0 dB. 
 
FFHSS, as an ECCM technique, was devised to thwart ES and EA attempts. If 
the hopping is fast enough, it can indeed accomplish these tasks. Implementation 
of FFHSS systems is considerably more difficult than SFHSS systems, which are 
discussed in the next chapter.

Chapter 12 
 
 
Electronic Warfare and Slow Frequency 
Hopping Systems 
 
 
12.1 Introduction 
 
Slow frequency hopping is when the communication system changes its frequency 
on a regular basis and there is more than one data bits transmitted per dwell at 
each frequency. A typical hop rate is around 100 hps, which means that the 
transmitter dwells at each frequency for somewhat less than 10 ms. It must be less 
than 10 ms per frequency because it takes a finite amount of time to switch 
between frequencies and the filters to settle. 
 
In this chapter it is assumed that the FHSS system employs noncoherent, 
MFSK modulation. The tone frequencies of the target are given by f1, f2, , fM as 
shown in Figure 12.1. It is assumed that these tones are placed symmetrically on 
each side of the carrier frequency f0. The instantaneous bandwidth of the jammer is 
given by WJ and the total bandwidth covered is given by Wss. The target frequency 
need not be known exactly and the epoch (timing) information of the target signal 
is not known. 
 
As in Chapter 11, the effects of frequency selective channel fading will only 
be briefly addressed for SFHSS systems [1]. This is not to imply that such fading 
is not important, but the goal here is to focus on the effects of jamming. 
 
Error control coding is an important countermeasure for jamming SFHSS 
systems as discussed in Chapter 3. Turbo coding has recently been devised as a 
method of error control coding for SFHSS systems [2–6]. Other coding has also 
successfully been applied to SFHSS signals for error control [7]. When results as 
to the effectiveness of jamming against these signals are available, they are 
included here. 
 
For the most part, in this chapter it is assumed that the transmitter and receiver 
have synchronized epochs and hopping codes. Some results are presented, 
however, for the case of attacking SFHSS code acquisition processes.

The structure of this chapter is as follows. As in Chapter 11, we begin by 
analyzing the performance of BBN jamming on SFHSS systems. We follow this 
with the effects of PBN jamming followed by MT jamming performance. 
Follower jamming, including both NBN and MT techniques, is addressed next. 
We conclude the chapter with a brief discussion of jamming error-coded MFSK 
signals. 
 
 
12.2 BBN Jamming of SFHSS Systems 
 
Just as for FFHSS jamming where broadband noise raises the noise floor 
everywhere in the spectrum, the same applies to SFHSS jamming. The analysis in 
Section 11.5 applies here as well. The biggest difference is that for SFHSS 
systems, the tones are phase incoherent from one hop to the next but within a hop 
they may be phase coherent.

where NT = N0 + J0 is the total noise density due to thermal noise and the jammer, 
and l = log2M. This function is plotted in Figure 12.2 for BFSK (M = 2) where it is 
assumed that the detector filter bandwidth, WF, is numerically equivalent to the 
data rate; that is, WF = Rb. Figure 12.3 shows the jamming performance for M = 4. 
BBN jamming is more effective against BFSK than QFSK with a JSR that is about 
5 dB less at Pe = 10–1. 
 
The communication system processing gain in this case is given by [10]

The processing gain in dB is given by Gp,dB = 10 log(N). For the example 
illustrated, M = 2, suppose Rb = 20 kbps and Wss = 60 MHz. Then Gp,dB = 32 dB. 
 
12.2.2 Error Coded 
 
Frequency diversity coding transmits the SFHSS bit at multiple frequencies, which 
is the same definition as FFHSS systems. Therefore, jamming performance against 
diversity coded SFHSS systems have the same performance as uncoded FFHSS 
systems as presented in Chapter 11. 
 
Other forms of coding can be applied to SFHSS systems, however, and their 
communication performance is better than diversity coding. The SFHSS signals 
can be treated quasi-statically to determine the effects of coding. Quasi-static 
analysis means that within a dwell, the data modulation can be treated as if the 
signal were not hopping. 
 
 
12.3 PBN Jamming of SFHSS Systems 
 
It is important to recall that the channels jammed by a PBN jammer need not be 
contiguous. The jammer could split its energy over several disjoint channels if it is 
advantageous to do so. This is shown in Figure 11.1(d). Also, the jammer would 
likely change the portions of the spectrum being jammed periodically to avoid 
effective FHSS system countermeasures. The fraction of the spectrum covered by 
the jammer is given by 
 
 
J
ss
W
W

 
(12.3) 
 
For contiguous PBN jamming, a signal at a single center frequency is modulated 
with a noise waveform that has a frequency bandwidth that is normally 
considerably wider than the channel bandwidth considered above. 
With PBN noise jamming, when the signal hops to a new frequency, that 
channel may be in the band that is being jammed or not. If it is, then the total noise 
present will be the sum of the jammer noise and the thermal noise. If that channel 
is not being jammed then the signal degradation is due to the thermal noise only.

The probability of a symbol error in the presence of a jammer is given by the 
probability of a symbol error when the jammer is present times the probability of 
the jammer being present plus the probability of a symbol error when the jammer 
is absent times the probability of the jammer being absent. Thus,

In the analysis of PBN jamming FHSS systems, it is often assumed that the 
noise can be ignored compared to the jammer. That assumption is marginal. Most 
of the time a frequency-hopping receiver is dealing with background noise, not the 
partial band jammer. Of course, in a crowded environment the biggest problem 
will be cochannel interference anyway, not a jammer. However, by ignoring the 
effects of thermal noise on the BER performance it is assured that the jammer will 
produce at least the BER computed, so it represents a worst case for the jammer. 
 
The approximate effects of considering such cochannel interference, with an 
emphasis on the interference effects on coarse acquisition of FHSS signals, was 
considered by Putnam [11] as described in Chapter 4. In that analysis, it was 
assumed that the interference was received at the same signal level as the target 
signal. A comparison was made for three coarse acquisition schemes: serial search, 
matched filter, and the combination, two-level acquisition. Typical results are 
shown in Figure 12.5 for the two-step acquisition. For the parameters considered, 
Pfa = 10–9, M = 5, M being the number of matched filters used, K = 10, K = T1/Tc, 
where T1 is the duration of the time an active correlator takes and Tc is the hop

interval, Nc = 1,000 is the number of hopping channels available, C is the number 
of active correlators considered, NU is the number of simultaneous users of the 
channels, and b is the average fractional power in the scattering components of the 
signal. For a detailed explanation of these parameters see [11]. For as few as five 
users, the probability of missed acquisition (PNoSync) increases by over three orders 
of magnitude. Clearly, interference is a significant limit to coarse acquisition in 
SFHSS systems. 
Assume initially that the signal is BFSK and that the noise can be neglected. In 
addition, assume that the jammer distributes its total power over the entire 
bandwidth Wss. Denoting the jammer power by J, the power spectral density of the 
jammer is J/Wss and NT = J/Wss. Since Eb = R/Rb,

Wss/Rb is the ratio of the total bandwidth to the data rate and, assuming that the 
spectral efficiency of the modulation process (= Rb/WF) is one, is equal to the 
processing gain of the AJ communication system. Therefore the processing gain of 
the system improves the bit error performance by this amount. The jammer is

placing energy in all of the frequency channels while the communicator is 
occupying only one at a time. The jammer is therefore wasting [(N – 1)/N]J of its 
power. Only (J/N) of the power is effectively jamming the receiver and the 
effective jamming power is PJ/Wss. The probability of a bit error is therefore

The expression above for M = 2 is plotted in Figure 12.6 for noncoherent

 as opposed to exponentially when N/ > 2. Therefore, partial band jamming is 
considerably more effective at interfering with the communicator than BBN 
jamming in this region. If the jammer knows, can determine, or can estimate the 
SNR of the target receiver it can adjust its power and spectrum fraction to achieve 
the desired level of Ps.

Figure 12.6 Comparison of BBN jamming versus PBN band jamming for representative processing 
gains (20 dB and 24 dB). 
The jammer is prudent to choose the optimum value for  rather than jam the 
whole band. The advantage of PBN jamming is evident from this chart. At a 10–3 
BER, the PBN jammer has about a 15 dB advantage over the BBN jammer. This 
advantage can be almost completely restored with coding and interleaving as long 
as the communication system can maintain operation in the low bit error rate 
region. When a channel BER of 5% or so is established by the jammer then the 
coding gain almost totally disappears as discussed in Section 3.3. 
The dependence of Pe on the processing gain is illustrated in Figure 12.7 where 
Pe is plotted versus N. The performance advantage of PBN jamming is clearly 
evident, keeping Pe relatively high even as the processing gain is increased ten-
fold. It should be noted, however, that JSR decreases as the fraction of the band 
jammed increases. This is because it is more prudent to put the jamming energy 
into a smaller segment so that the communicator does not see the jammer as much 
but when they do meet, the jammer has more concentrated energy so the 
communicator has a harder time getting the bits through without error. 
 
12.3.2 Error-Coded SFHSS MFSK Systems 
 
Utilizing the jammer state information then, when it is assumed that the jamming 
noise density is sufficiently larger than the background noise, the bit error 
probability when only noise is present can be ignored; then if a symbol is not 
jammed, an error-free decision can be made as to whether the symbol was a mark 

Electronic Warfare and Slow Frequency Hopping Systems

or a space. With diversity, if all the symbols were jammed then the decision as to 
whether the transmitted symbol was a mark or a space is based on the largest 
detector output summed over the diversified symbols. This is referred to as soft 
decision detection [13]. 
 
Worst-case PBN jamming performance against diversity coded BFSK is 
shown in Figure 12.8 [14]. In this chart, m refers to the diversity of the code. The 
diversity is the number of equal energy subsymbols derived from the data bits. In 
repetition coding, for example, it is the number of frequencies transmitted per 
information bit. Also shown on the chart is the optimum value of the diversity, 
denoted 
,
mwhich is a function of the SNR. 
Ma and Poole [12] characterized several codes used for MFSK in partial band 
noise jamming and compared them to the uncoded case. The results for binary 
error-correcting codes when the worst-case parameters are used is shown in Figure 
12.9. Figure 12.9 assumes hard decision decoding and no JSI availability. Table 
12.2 shows numerically the performance of the codes considered under the worst-
case situations for a BER of 10–5. At reasonable values of JSR (> –10 dB), the 
addition of coding to the FHSS system actually increases jamming performance! 
 
Shown in Figure 12.10 is the Eb/J0 required for BFSK to produce a Pe = 10–5 
versus the fraction of the spectrum jammed for binary coding without diversity. 
Again, this data assumes hard decision  decoding with no JSI. An  optimum value

At values of  other than * the SNR required to produce a BER of 10–5 is smaller. 
 
Closed-form error probabilities for coded performance are difficult to obtain. 
Instead bounds are often used to evaluate performance; one of these is the  
Chernoff bound. This bound for communication performance with coding and 
diversity utilizing soft decision decoding and assuming JSI is available is given by

Thus, there is an optimum spectrum fraction and optimum amount of 
frequency diversity for worst-case jamming effectives. Figure 12.11 shows this 
worst-case jamming effectiveness with PBN jamming for binary error correction 
codes with optimum diversity included [12]. Note that for many of the codes, 
above   –12 dB, uncoded transmission outperforms coding. This data applies to 
FFHSS as well as SFHSS with bit interleaving sufficient to approximate a 
memoryless channel. 
 
The required JSR to achieve a 10–5 BER as a function of the spectrum fraction 
covered by a PBN jammer against codes utilizing optimum diversity is shown in 
Figure 12.12. While Pe > 10–5 is not adequate for most jamming attacks, it does 
illustrate that with as little as 1% of the spectrum jammed, the JSR need not be that 
large to be effective. 
 
Table 12.3 shows the error performance of diversity only MFSK with 
optimum diversity in the best case jamming environment [12]. Table 12.4 shows 
the error performance when coding is employed in the worst-case jamming 
situation [12]. 
 
There is an optimum amount of diversity depending on the SNR. The upper 
bound on the BER for BFSK for the optimum diversity and the worst-case band 
fraction of  = 0.75 in PBN jamming is shown in Figure 12.13 [15]. Comparing 
Figure 12.11 PBN jamming performance against binary error correcting codes employing optimum 
diversity for BFSK ignoring the effects of thermal noise. (After: [12]. © IEEE 1984. Reprinted with

this with Figure 12.4 it is clear that including the diversity has restored to the 
communicator most of the SNR advantage that the PBN jammer had without 
diversity. In this chart the optimum diversity is given by

 
(12.26) 
 
as long as   –6 dB. For larger values of m than 
*,
m BER performance degrades 
because of the effects of noncoherent combining in the receiver. 
 
The comparison shown in Figure 12.14 [16] shows the performance gain of 
coding (diversity) for noncoherent BFSK compared with BBN jamming without 
diversity and PBN jamming with no diversity. It again shows that the diversity 
processing removes most of the jammer gain over no diversity. The approximately 
30 dB gained by the jammer due to the linear relationship between JSR and Pb 
disappears  at  low  values  of  SNR.  At  reasonable  values of  JSR  (above  about  
–10 dB), however, PBN jamming with * when the communication system uses 
diversity m* the BER increases over the case of no diversity. 
 
In a Rayleigh fading communication channel (not the jammer channel), the 
energy per bit of the signal at the receiver is described by the density function

This function is plotted in Figure 12.15. At  = 0 dB (mb/J = 0 dB),   0.2 is

larger, requiring about   0.5 at   –9 dB. For lower JSR values, the 10–1 BER 
goal is not achievable. Such JSR levels are possible if the jammer can get close to 
the target receiver.

In this case the peak value of the BER occurs at  = 1 so the optimum jamming 
strategy is to jam the full band. However, Pe > 10–1 for  < 6 dB at   0.2 to 0.3, 
so, again, relatively small amounts of jammed spectrum can produce favorable 
results. 
 
 
12.4 Multitone Jamming of SFHSS Systems 
 
One technique for jamming FSK signals is to broadcast narrowband signals at the 
tone frequencies used by the communication system. As described in Chapter 8, 
such jamming is referred to as multitone jamming. The fraction of the tones 
jammed, NJ, compared to the totality of channels in Wss is given by , the same 
quantity as for partial-band jamming. That is,

and Wc is the width of one channel. 
It is not necessary to hit the tone frequencies exactly. It is sufficient to put the 
tone anywhere within the pass band of the receiver filters to be effective. It is also 
possible to emit energy at randomly selected frequencies. This type of jamming is 
called independent multitone jamming. 
The number of tones per jammed channel in MT jamming is given by n. Note 
that all channels are not necessarily jammed, just those that have n tones in them. 
When a mark (or space) is sent the following possibilities arise: (1) one of the 
tones is at the frequency of the mark and one or more are at some other location, 
or (2) none of the tones is at the mark frequency. For the first case, the power or 
the signal at the mark frequency coupled with the jammer power at the same 
frequency would cause the receiver to decide correctly that a mark was sent. In the 
second case, successful jamming would depend on the relative power levels 
between the mark signal and one (or more) of the jamming signals. However, 
when the jammer power is larger than the mark signal only one of the jammer 
tones is necessary, not multiples. Therefore this strategy wastes the jammer power. 
Thus a single tone per channel at most is a better strategy, spreading the jammer 
power into more channels. 
 
This tone, placed at one of the data tone frequencies, will cause an erroneous 
detection decision (M – 1) / M times when the tone sent is evenly distributed over 
the M tones. The other decision will be correct since the jammer tone is at the tone 
frequency that was actually sent. 
 
12.4.1 Uncoded SFHSS MFSK Systems 
 
For BFSK there are two possible values for n: n = 1 and n = 2. For n = 1, a symbol 
error will occur when the jamming tone power is larger than the symbol tone 
power and the jammer tone frequency is at the complementary tone frequency. 
The probability of this is  / 2. Since these are independent events, the probability 
of a bit error is given by

is plotted in Figure 12.16 for  = 10 dB and 20 dB when  = 10/2,400 and in 
Figure 12.17 for  = 100/2,400. The BER increases until  = 1 to 3 dB, after which 
it remains constant irrespective of  and the SNR. In neither case is a BER of 10–1 
achieved. 
When n > 1 and MFSK in a jammed channel, then at least two of the detectors 
will have significant energy in them. At least one of them is assured to be in a 
complementary channel to the correct symbol detector. However, one of them may 
be in the correct symbol detector or in another complementary channel. If the 
jammer tone is in the correct detector, then, as explained in Section 6.1.3, the 
phase relationship between the symbol tone and the jammer tone may make that 
detector output greater or smaller than the jammed complementary channel 
depending on the phase relationship of the jammer tone to the data tone. Of 
course, if the second jammer tone is at another complementary frequency, then a 
detection error is forced if the jammer tone is more powerful than the data tone, 
and no detection error occurs otherwise. Thus, even though the channel contains 
jamming tones and one of these is at the same frequency as the data symbol, the 
correct symbol may still be detected. 
The jamming performance depends on, among other things, the number of 
tones in each channel. For BFSK, there are two possible tones per channel and 
with n = 2 MT jamming one or two of these tone frequencies can be jammed, 
depending on whether the channel is jammed and, of course, the SNR. 
The probability of generating a detection error for BFSK is given by

The MT jammer performance is illustrated in Figure 12.18 for two values of 
SNR and spectrum fractions. The spectrum fractions are given by (12.32) and 
represent the fraction of the channels with jammer tones in them. In all cases, 
effective jamming occurs when  > 2 or 3 dB irrespective of the SNRs considered 
here.  
 
Peterson [21] also points out that tone jamming is more efficient than PBN 
jamming with the optimal band fraction   according  to Table 12.5. To glean the 
significance of this analysis, consider the example from earlier. Suppose the 
jammer is mounted in a UAS with an ERP of 
T
100
.

 Suppose the target 
communication networks need a BER of 10–3 or better to work properly (this is 
one bit in 1,000 or fewer in error) and they employ omnidirectional antennas with 
0 dB gain. The chart in Figure 12.19 [22] indicates that in a Rayleigh fading 
channel, an SNR of 30 dB or more is required, which corresponds to a factor of 
1,000. (Most channels in the VHF range exhibit either Rayleigh or Ricean fading.

Rayleigh fading is due to specular or diffuse signal components only while Ricean 
fading has a significant direct component as well.) Suppose the total hop 
bandwidth is 50 MHz at a middle frequency of 60 MHz, a data rate of 25 kbps, 
and a suburban noise environment. Since Eb / NJ = R / J Wss / Rb then the required 
S/J is 103  25  103/50  106 = 0.5. This corresponds to a JSR of 2 (3 dB). From 
Figure 12.20, at any link distance against 1 W or 10 W targets the links are 
jammed. For targets of 100 W, the jammer must be very close and even then only 
for the 30 km link distance. 
 
12.4.2 Error-Coded SFHSS MFSK Signals 
 
The performance of MT jamming when the BFSK signal is coded with time 
diversity m is shown in Figure 12.21 [23]. In the horizontal  region  every channel 
has a tone in it so the signal is jammed with probability one. As always, it should 
be remembered that diversity reduces data throughput. When m = 5, the data bit is 
sent five times so the data throughput is reduced about five times, but a  = –8 dB 
causes Pe > 10–1 in this case. 
As shown above for partial band jamming, the jamming SNR advantage is 
largely lost because of diversity in the communication signal. This is shown in 
Figure 12.21. When diversity is not used in the communication system, the 
jammer using MT  jamming  has a  25 dB SNR  advantage  over the  receiver  at a 
Figure 12.19 FSK BER performance versus SNR in a Rayleigh fading channel. (Source: [22]. ©

658
BER of 10–4. With the optimum amount of diversity the receiver gets this jammer 
advantage back to within 1.6 dB of BBN jamming. Again though, adding time 
diversity reduces data throughput since a single data bit must be sent several times. 
Another technique is to send pilot bits whose value and location are known (in 
time and frequency) and constant. These pilot bits are used to estimate the channel 
parameters. Such tones (bits) can be used to estimate multipath, for example, 
which may be necessary anyway for the channel to work correctly. 
 
 
12.5 Follower Jamming of SFHSS Systems 
 
As for FFHSS systems, a follower jammer attempts to follow an SFHSS signal as 
it changes frequencies. Measurements on intercepted energy are made and 
characteristics are measured to try to correlate one hop with the last. Once a 
determination is made that a hop correlates with the target of interest, a jamming 
signal is initiated at that frequency. That jamming waveform could be of many 
types, but the most common are narrowband noise and one or a few tones [24]. 
Both increase the energy in the filters in the target receiver. 
 
As opposed to FFHSS systems, where consideration of jamming one, two, or 
all three channels (data tone, one of the other adjacent channels, two adjacent

channels only, or all three channels) needs to be addressed, for SFHSS there is no 
distinction between jamming the data channel and its complementary, since it is 
not known which to call which. The net effect of jamming only one channel is the 
same whichever is chosen, which is to reduce the BER by half what it would be 
otherwise since, on average, half of the data bits are jammed in that bit’s 
complementary channel. Also, for SFHSS, since the complementary channel can 
be determined, it makes no sense to jam the channel on the other side of whichever 
tone is called the data channel. Therefore, the follower schemes that make sense 
for SFHSS are not exactly the same as for FFHSS. The ones that do potentially 
make sense jam only one channel or two (both data channels).  
The jamming performance will depend on which scheme is chosen. What 
makes follower jamming different for SFHSS systems from FFHSS systems is 
twofold: 
 
 
The complementary channel can be determined by measurement so it 
is not an unknown. 
 
Since several data bits are sent per dwell, successfully jamming the 
channel results in jamming the data bits, whereas for FFHSS, the 
data bit is also transmitted on one or more additional dwells due to 
the inherent frequency diversity. 
 
Narrowband in this case refers to a channel width that is approximately half 
(for BFSK) its normal definition so that only one of the data tones is jammed. In 
the low VHF range, for example, the bandwidth would be approximately 12.5 kHz 
while in the HF range it would be approximately 1.5 kHz. 
This argument assumes that BFSK was the modulation, but the arguments are 
easily extended to include MFSK in the logical way. Jamming performance, of 
course, will depend on how many tones are present. In this section, uncoded BFSK 
will be assumed. 
Therefore the probability of bit errors can be expressed as in Chapter 11, 
suitably modified for SFHSS systems. Again, let  denote the fraction of the dwell 
upon which jamming energy is applied. The probability of a bit error for an 
individual dwell is given by

12.5.1 Noise Jamming 
 
For noise jamming, the noise can be one channel wide or can cover both channels. 
In the latter case, the jamming performance is the same as PBN jamming when the 
correct hop association is accomplished. In this case, however,  corresponds to 
the fraction of the hop jammed as opposed to the fraction of the spectrum covered 
by the jammer.

When unmodulated tones are used as the jammer waveforms, it is assumed that the 
tones are placed within the bandpass of the receiver filters of width WF. The tones 
need not be at exactly the same frequency as the data tones to effectively raise the 
energy level in the complementary channel filter [26].

 12.5.3 Comparison 
 
Comparisons of these four approaches to follower jamming SFHSS systems for 
representative values of the parameters are shown in Figure 12.22 through 12.25. 
In Figure 12.22,  = 10 dB and  = 0.1. All of the jamming approaches produce 
similar results, and the BER never achieves 10–1. When the fraction of the dwell 
jammed is raised to  = 0.3, the results in Figure 12.23 ensue against the same 
SNR. Again, all techniques produced similar results, achieving a 10–1 BER 
between 0 and 2 dB JSR. 
For a 20 dB SNR and  = 0.1, the results are shown in Figure 12.24. At higher 
values of JSR the results are similar to those for  = 10 dB. At lower JSRs values, 
however, the results are different. When  = 0.3, the performance is shown in 
Figure 12.25. 
 These results indicate that the particular method of follower jamming SFHSS 
targets is not a critical factor. The timing, however, as well as the ability to 
accurately identify the new hop as belonging to the target of interest is critical. In 
dense target environments it becomes extremely difficult to associate one hop with 
the last one from the same transmitter. 
Performance of the various techniques as the dwell fraction is varied is shown 
in Figure 12.26 for a few values of  JSR. As  expected, when  JSR  is  greater  than

0 dB, the performance is not improved much. Also, the performance degrades 
gracefully as the fraction decreases. 
 
 
12.6 Error-Coded MFSK Jamming 
 
SFH signals can be treated quasi-statically. That means that within a dwell, where 
many data bits are sent, the signal can be treated as if it were not hopping. This is 
particularly useful for coded MFSK signals since there is a wealth of knowledge 
about such signals. References [27–29] are suggested sources. 
 
 
12.7 Concluding Remarks 
 
A comparison of BBN jamming, best case PBN jamming, and best case n = 1 MT 
jamming of noncoherent, orthogonal uncoded 2-FSK is shown in Figure 12.27 
[30]. Clearly the n = 1 multitone is the best for uncoded BFSK signals. 
Additionally, beyond a fairly low JSR threshold, both worst-case BN and worst-
case MT have an inverse linear relationship to the SNR, a significant advantage 
for the jammer as opposed to spreading the jamming energy over the whole 
hopping bandwidth. This demonstrates the importance of coding for BFSK 
communications, which at low Pe removes the jammer advantage. It is possible to 
―punch through‖ coding applied to BFSK signals. This requires a channel BER of 
about 0.04 to 0.12. When this happens the decoded BER is approximately equal to 
the channel BER that, for many purposes, precludes effective communications. At 
low Eb / N0, or, equivalently when Rb = WF, at high enough JSR, adding coding 
actually decreases performance. For Eb / N0 < 6 dB, all of these coding schemes 
produce a BER larger than when uncoded. For reasonable values of JSR, coding 
makes digital signals very vulnerable to PBN jamming. Only at values of JSR less 
than –5 dB or lower is coding effective. 
The required decoded BER depends on the application. Many situations, such 
as voice communications, can tolerate a significant BER and still be effective. 
Many others cannot. Thus it is important to know the target set for the jammer for 
the EA to be effective. 
 
It is possible for BFSK communication systems to add more and more coding 
as the communication environment gets noisier and noisier. When it does so, it 
either decreases the information throughput rate while holding the required 
bandwidth constant or it increases the bandwidth required while holding the 
information data rate constant. In most realistic military scenarios, the bandwidth 
is the limiting factor so normally the information data rate is decreased.

As can be noted by observing Figures 12.9, 12.11, and 12.14, it is frequently 
true that adding coding shortens the region from low BER to high BER. This can

13.1 Introduction 
 
As pointed out in Chapter 3, UWB signals have significant processing gain so we 
would expect problems trying to jam them with any kind of reasonable power in 
the jammer. Therefore a different approach than simply overpowering the UWB 
signals is in order. One method is to try to attack the inherent nonlinearities in the 
UWB receiver. 
 
Also, at least for the foreseeable future, UWB communication technology, in 
the United States and Europe at least, will be limited to personal area networks 
(PANs) because of the high potential for interfering with other narrower 
communication services. This is not necessarily the case for the rest of the world, 
however. UWB systems have been shown to work effectively over links of several 
kilometers at microwatt power levels, so usage for more general purpose wireless 
communications, such as cellular phone systems, is certainly possible. In fact, 
some estimates of cellular coverage with UWB technology have the number of 
subscribers per cell in the 1,000 range whereas limits at the time of this writing are 
in the range of 50–100 per cell. 
 
UWB systems transmit information with very short duration pulses rather than 
by modulating a carrier to move the information signal elsewhere in frequency. 
The large bandwidth of a UWB system is determined by the pulse shape and 
duration. This large system bandwidth relative to the information bandwidth 
allows UWB systems to operate with a (very) low power spectral density. A low 
power spectral density implies an inherent covertness of UWB, due to the fact that 
the UWB signal may be near or below the noise floor of an EW receiver, much 
the same as DSSS signals can be. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
670
We investigate the detectability of UWB systems with noncooperative EW 
systems in this chapter. UWB signals are hard to detect because a limited amount 
of power is distributed across a very wide bandwidth, as discussed in Chapter 3. 
This is not the primary reason for a communicator to use UWB signaling, 
however. It is principally a technique for sharing common bandwidth among 
many users. 
Since the details of the modulation process are not known to a noncooperative 
EW receiver, the interceptor cannot use a matched filter or a correlator and must 
treat the signal as a random process and base its detection on the presence or 
absence of energy compared to the background noise. As described in Chapter 2, 
the module that does this is an energy detector. 
This chapter is structured as follows. We begin with an evaluation of the 
detectability of a UWB signal, and it should surprise no one that the detector of 
choice is the radiometer. That is followed by an analysis of jamming performance. 
In particular, the techniques we look at for jamming UWB signals are BBN, MT, 
tone, pulsed, PBN, and NBN. 
 
 
13.2 Detecting UWB Signals 
 
We examine the detectability of UWB signals in this section. Two measures of 
detectability will be described. The first measure computes Pd versus the SNR 
required to achieve some measure of performance, usually Pfa and Pd. The second 
measure is the ratio of the distance an intercepting interloper must be to the 
distance between the target transmitter and receiver to achieve a measure of 
performance, again usually Pd and Pfa.

Possible modulation schemes that have been proposed for UWB 
communications systems are pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), on/off keying 
(OOK), bipolar signaling, pulse position modulation (PPM), and various 
combinations of these. An M-ary PPM scheme, bipolar signaling, and an M-ary 
combination of bipolar signaling and PPM (biorthogonal signaling) are considered 
here.

13.2.2 Required SNR Measure of Effectiveness 
 
13.2.2.1 Radiometer Detectors 
 
We will use the radiometer as the architecture to examine the detectability of 
UWB signals. We discussed radiometers at length in Chapter 2 where, in 
particular, the fundamental radiometer shown in Figure 13.1 was characterized. 
This section describes a wideband radiometer system, and introduces the multi-
radiometer detector, in the form of a time-channelized radiometer. 
As pointed out in Chapter 2, the optimal receiver for detection of a signal in 
AWGN is the energy detector or the radiometer. It is easily implemented in 
hardware and can be used to detect SS signals. Detection is accomplished by 
calculating the energy of the received message and comparing with a 
predetermined threshold. As illustrated in Figure 13.1, it consists of a bandpass 
filter of bandwidth W, a squaring device, and an integrator with an integration time 
T set equal to the observation time interval. 
The performance of the radiometer is characterized by the probability of 
detection Pd when the signal is present (along with the noise, of course) and the 
probability of false alarm Pfa when only noise is present. The signal power-to-
noise PSD, R/N0, is usually the parameter specified to achieve the Pd and Pfa goals. 
We will use R/N0 as a measure of the covertness of the communication system 
under consideration. 
When the signal is absent and the input to the radiometer is strictly noise with 
two-sided PSD N0/2 and the statistics of the output of the radiometer U are

normalized, the normalized random variable Y = 2U / N0 has a central chi-square 
distribution with v = 2TW degrees of freedom where T and W are the observation 
time interval and the filter bandwidth of the radiometer respectively, as illustrated 
in Figure 13.1. The PDF of Y is given by [1]

Pfa is a system parameter that is specified by the requirements of the application,

probability of non-cooperative detection for UWB signals is extremely low as

13.2.2.2 Time-Channelized Multichannel Radiometer 
 
The radiometer described above is a wideband radiometer in which a single 
radiometer observes the entire bandwidth Wi over time T. Other radiometer 
architectures improve the total time bandwidth product and thereby the probability 
of detection. One possibility is the channelized radiometer exemplified in Figure 
13.2. M radiometers are used in parallel and each radiometer can observe either a 
different portion of the spectrum or a different time window, reducing the noise 
measured by each radiometer [4]. 
The time interval for each channel of this system is on the same order as the 
pulse duration, Tp, which yields T0W approximately equal to 1. For these 
radiometers, Edell’s model is no longer valid, but other models for a wide range of 
TW are given in [1]. Park’s [5] and Dillard’s [6] models are derived from Barton’s

A time-channelized radiometer gives better detection performance for UWB 
signals than a frequency channelized configuration. This is due to the fact that 
UWB systems only transmit a short period of time. The total observation window 
T is divided among the M radiometers, each observing T0 = T / M of the window.2 
The optimum M is when T / M is equal to the pulse duration Tp because increasing 
the time window beyond the pulse duration only increases the noise captured 
without measuring any additional signal energy. 
The detectability of a UWB signal varies depending on what is a priori known 
about the signal. The ideal detector is a multiradiometer system that is perfectly 
synchronized with the received pulse and has prior knowledge of pulse width as 
well as the bandwidth of the SOI. For this case, the bandwidth of the input filter is 
set to the signal bandwidth and the observation intervals to the signal pulse width 
(T0). When less is known about the SOI less sensitivity ensues and the parameters 
of the multiradiometer system are adjusted according to what is known about the 
SOI.  
 
Single Signal 
 
The overall performance (i.e., the probability of detection Pd and the probability of 
false alarm Pfa) of the intercept system is a function of the performance

of the individual radiometers. The radiometer analytical models require 
that only one radiometer with a single observation and integration interval is used 
for detection and that there is significant signal energy present for the entire 
duration of the observation interval. Observation intervals of the individual 
radiometers larger than the pulse width result in the signal being limited to only 
part of the observation interval because UWB signals are (very) low duty cycle 
pulses. Furthermore, the Gaussian assumption for the output statistics of the 
radiometer is invalid because for UWB signals,

 For these reasons, the 
available theoretical models are not applicable, so to determine the detectability 
we must resort to numerical simulation. 
We will assume that the individual radiometers in the multiradiometer system 
(FBC) are identical; thus the parameters 
fai
P and
di
P are the same for each of them.

Equations (13.22) and (13.23) are valid for the single user case when there is a 
single pulse to be detected within a frame and we have M radiometers within the 
frame. 
Given Pfa and Pd for the multiradiometer system,
fai
P and
di
P can be calculated 
iteratively using (13.22) and (13.23). The threshold for the individual radiometers 
is determined by simulation to meet the 
fai
P criterion and then, given this threshold 
value, the R / N0 is found to meet the required 
di
P criterion. We will compare the 
results so obtained with the required R / N0 for CDMA by applying the analytical 
models to the latter since the constraints that render the models inapplicable in 
UWB do not exist in wideband CDMA. 
Since the bandwidth or the pulse width may not be known to the intercept 
receiver, we first consider the performance of the receiver unaware of the SOI 
specifications. The multiradiometer system for this receiver is similar in structure 
to the optimal receiver, but the observation interval, T0, and the bandwidth of the 
input filter will likely not be equal to the actual pulse width or the bandwidth of 
the SOI. We consider the performance when the bandwidth is unknown but the 
pulse width is known and also the case when the pulse width is unknown but the 
bandwidth is known. However, for now, synchronization is assumed. We now 
consider these scenarios in more detail. 
 
Bandwidth Unknown, Pulse Width Known. First we consider the case when the 
SOI bandwidth is unknown. For this case, the receiver structure is similar to the 
optimal receiver with the same number of radiometers, M, and the observation 
interval set equal to the pulse width. If the bandwidth of the input filter of the 
radiometer is set to be greater than the SOI bandwidth, then the noise power 
increases. For bandwidths less than the SOI bandwidth the signal power decreases. 
Both cases reduce the available SNR. 
 
Pulse Width Unknown, Bandwidth Known. We assume in this case that the 
observation interval of the intercept receiver is different from the actual pulse 
width of the SOI while we can set the bandwidth to be that of the SOI since it is 
known. As before, an observation interval that is longer than the pulse width 
results in excess noise, while an observation interval smaller than the pulse width 
reduces the signal power. Again both cases reduce the available SNR. Clearly, the 
number of individual radiometers required to cover a frame is a function of the 
observation interval, T0, as is obvious from Figure 13.2. Assuming the observation 
interval of the receiver is TR, then the total number of radiometers per frame is

We have assumed the received signal to be time synchronized with the 
observation intervals of the individual radiometers for the cases considered above. 
For asynchronous signals, there is overlap into adjacent radiometer integration 
intervals. In the worst-case scenario, exactly half the signal overlaps onto the 
observation interval of the following radiometer, since the radiometers are aligned 
in time, thus minimizing signal power in both radiometers. In this case, the signal 
power input to a particular radiometer is reduced by 3 dB. As a result the required 
R/N0 to meet performance criteria increases by 3 dB-Hz. The actual performance 
of the receiver depends on the amount of signal overlap, and the performance 
(required SNR) increases as 
3
SNR dB-Hz where 0 <  < 1. However, since our 
objective is to obtain an upper bound on signal detectability, the assumption of 
perfect synchronism is reasonable for our purposes. 
 
Multiple Signals 
 
For L active users in the environment there are L pulses, which are 
pseudorandomly shifted within a time frame. The multiradiometer receiver 
structure is still that in Figure 13.2, but because of the presence of more pulses in 
the system and thus more energy per frame, the performance criterion of the 
individual radiometers
d
(
)

can be decreased while meeting the system 
performance criteria. The L pulses may or may not overlap with each other and as 
a result two cases arise. We assume that all the pulses have equal amplitudes. We 
also assume that the intercepting receiver has knowledge of the bandwidth and 
pulse width of the SOI (the most likely case unless there is nothing known about 
the signal environment). 
 
Nonoverlapping Signals. In this case, we are assuming that the pulses occupy 
different time slots within a frame. The multiradiometer system for this case is 
similar to that in the single user case, except that for L users, Pd of the overall 
system is related to the individual radiometer

R / N0 when L users are active and x pulses overlap. p(x) is the probability that x 
pulses out of L pulses overlap. 
Because p(x) is not normally available in closed form we use numerical 
simulation to evaluate (13.28). When L users are active each frame has exactly L 
pulses, which are pseudorandomly placed within the frame. Since a pulse can 
occupy any time slot in the frame with equal probability, the individual user pulses 
are uniformly spread within the frame. The performance for a particular frame 
depends on the maximum overlap. The average for a given number of users is 
calculated by averaging R/N0 over the number of frames, where the maximum 
overlap for each frame is the maximum number of users that overlap in a single 
time slot in the frame. The performance for the CDMA signal is calculated by 
using the analytical expressions given in (13.19) or (13.20) with allowances made

Performance 
 
Numerical results for the UWB signals are obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. 
The users are assumed to be stationary for the duration of the simulation in the 
peer-to-peer network topology. For simplicity we assume that all the pulses at the 
multiradiometer detection system have equal amplitudes.

Ideal Multiradiometer. In the ideal case, the multiradiometer system is assumed to 
have complete knowledge of the system specifications (i.e., the bandwidth and the 
pulse width). The performance criteria for the radiometer is assumed to be           
Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 0.01. The filter is a fourth-order Butterworth filter with a 4 GHz 
cutoff. The observation interval of the radiometer is the pulse width, Tp. 
The 
fai
P and the 
di
P values for the individual radiometers are calculated 
iteratively for the single user case using (13.22) and (13.23). The integrator is reset 
after each observation interval Tp. The threshold is selected to meet the 
fai
P
requirements of the individual radiometers. This threshold is then used to calculate 
the required R/N0 to meet the
di
P criterion. 
The required SNR obtained for UWB in the single user case is compared with 
that for CDMA in Table 13.1. For CDMA we assume a bandwidth of Ww = 5 MHz 
and a chip rate of 3.7 Mcps. As for the UWB system, performance criteria of       
Pd = 0.9 and Pfa = 0.01 are assumed for this CDMA system. We used the Park 
model of the radiometer to compute these values. We see that UWB is much more 
difficult to detect (by more than 30 dB) than the CDMA system in the single-user 
case. Note that 100 dB-Hz corresponds to

Multiradiometer Performance with Unknown Bandwidth. In this section we 
evaluate the performance of the multiradiometer detector without prior knowledge 
of the UWB system bandwidth. The other parameters are the same as in the ideal 
case. The 
di
P and the 
fai
P of the radiometer are unchanged from the optimal case 
because the observation interval is known. Figure 13.3 shows the probability of 
detection, Pd, as a function of R/N0 for bandwidths of W = 4 GHz and 50 GHz. We 
can conclude that the multiradiometer performance is not very sensitive to filter 
bandwidth mismatch.

suboptimal multi-radiometer system are similar to those in the ideal case, but the

radiometers within a single time frame vary with the observation interval. Figure 
13.4 shows Pd as a function of the R/N0 for observation periods of the radiometer 
of 0.6 ns and 60 ns. For the second case, the observation interval is set equal to the 
frame time; thus a single radiometer occupies the entire frame. This represents the 
extreme case when maximum noise power is input to the radiometer. We see that

multiradiometer receiver performance is relatively insensitive to variations of the 
observation interval. 
 
Summary 
 
In this section we quantitatively evaluated the UWB detection performance of a 
multiradiometer intercept receiver. We quantified this performance for a few 
variations of the radiometer parameters to evaluate how well they match the 
parameters of the SOI. Results showed that the detector was relatively insensitive 
to prior knowledge about the bandwidth and pulse width of the UWB signal. In 
addition it was shown that UWB signals are considerably more difficult to detect 
than CDMA signals.

McKinstry and Bueher [9] took a somewhat different approach to evaluate the 
detectability of UWB systems. We briefly describe their approach and some of 
their results here.

13.2.2.1 Detection Methods 
 
For radiometers with a large time-bandwidth product, TW, many of the available 
models discussed in Section 2.7 are very closely approximated by Edell’s model. 
In that case, the probability of detection, Pd, is given by

where Pfa is the probability of false alarm in noise alone, R is the average signal 
power at the radiometer, and N0 is the noise PSD. This single radiometer model is 
used in [2] to compare the detectability of a UWB system with more traditional 
wideband DSSS systems. To quantitatively evaluate performance, [10] determines 
the probability of detection versus the relative distance between transmitter and 
interceptor. This assumes a scenario such as that depicted in Figure 13.5. The 
probability of detection can be found as a function of the ratio d/d0, the ratio of the 
distance from the transmitter to interceptor (d) to the distance from the transmitter 
to the intended receiver (d0). The interceptor in this situation is attempting to 
detect the presence of the transmitted signal, not demodulate it. This same metric 
will be used here to compare the detectability of UWB systems and also to 
compare different radiometer configurations. 
The same time-channelized multiradiometer system as above was used, whose 
architecture is shown in Figure 13.2. This system consists of M radiometers each 
of which detects energy over an interval of T0. This gives an overall observation 
interval of T = MT0. Considered above is the case when T of the radiometer system 
is equal to the frame time, Tf, of the UWB system; however, this is not a necessary 
condition and actually creates some limitations to the performance of the detection 
system. If T is allowed to be greater than Tf these difficulties are alleviated as will 
be shown. 
As above, the overall desired Pfa can be chosen by setting the probability of 
false alarm for each channel,

The overall probability of detection of an impulsive UWB signal not known to be 
synchronized with the radiometer cannot be expressed simply, so we use 
numerical simulation to determine this relationship. 
Simulation of UWB systems employing binary PPM, bipolar modulation,     
4-ary PPM, 4-ary biorthogonal modulation, 16-ary PPM, and 16-ary biorthogonal 
modulation were carried out to evaluate BER performance in AWGN. Simulation 
of the binary PPM system using a rate 1/4, constraint length 9 convolutional code 
with Viterbi soft decoding was also performed.

 If we assume that the noise in each of

We can conclude from this that noncooperative detection of UWB signals has 
a very low probability of success and the distance required to detect a signal with a 
reasonable probability of detection is substantially less than the distance at which 
the target receiver using a matched filter and knowledge of the transmitter can 
receive the signal. 
The above analysis assumes that the receiver knows when the pulses are to 
occur so it can look for them. In a noncooperative EW system that is not the case. 
The issue is further compounded when the UWB systems use PN codes to 
randomize the pulse occurrence time. This PN code is known to the target 
transmitter and receiver but not to the EW system. The only known answer to this 
quagmire is to let a wideband radiometer integrate over a reasonably wide 
bandwidth.  
 
Single Wideband Radiometer Detector 
 
The performance of a single wideband radiometer (represented effectively by 
Edell’s model) with an observation time of 100 s against a single user employing 
uncoded UWB SOIs, and a binary PPM system using a rate 1/4, constraint length 
9 convolutional code with Viterbi soft decoding is shown in Figure 13.6. This plot 
shows that higher-order modulations and channel coding can negatively impact 
detectability. 
 
Channelized Wideband Radiometer Detector 
 
For the channelized radiometer system, the performance of the detector is affected 
by the parameters chosen. The total interval time for detection decisions was equal 
to the frame time of the UWB signal above. If the detector’s frame is synchronized 
with the received UWB signal’s frame, then when a signal is present, each detector 
frame will have a channel that overlaps with the UWB pulse transmitted during 
that frame. But if the detector’s frame is not synchronized (exactly half a frame 
time off, for example) there will be some detector frames that contain no UWB 
pulses (assuming the pulse in a given frame is randomly distributed due to the 
time-hopping code). These frames that do not overlap with a pulse will have a very 
low probability (= Pfa) of indicating that a signal is present. This also has a 
―ceiling‖ effect on the maximum achievable average probability of detection when 
the detector is not synchronized. The probability of detection as a function of 
distance for the uncoded binary PPM signal is plotted in Figure 13.7 for the cases 
where the detector is perfectly synchronized with the receiver, the detector is 
exactly half a frame and half a pulse width off from synchronization, and the 
detector is assumed to have a uniformly random time offset from synchronization. 
For this comparison the overall observation interval was set equal to the UWB 
frame duration (T = Tf), the observation interval of each channel was set equal to 
the pulse duration (T0 = Tp), and the overall probability of false alarm was set to 

Electronic Warfare and Ultrawideband Systems 
687
0.01. All plots giving the results of the channelized radiometer detector are from 
simulations using Park’s model (13.19) for each radiometer channel. The results 
from the simulations using Dillard’s model are nearly identical and thus are not 
shown. 
The probability of detection for the channelized radiometer can be improved 
by increasing the overall observation interval. A similar effect is seen in the single 
wideband radiometer when the observation interval is increased [2, 5]. By 
increasing the overall observation time to multiple frames, the ―ceiling‖ effect 
seen in Figure 13.7 disappears and the difference due to frame synchronization is 
greatly minimized. 
As can be seen by comparing Figures 13.6 and 13.7, the channelized 
radiometer is able to detect the UWB signal from a greater distance than the single 
radiometer (except for very small probability of detection values). It is interesting 
to note that the channelized radiometer detection curve has a steeper slope than the 
single radiometer curve. This implies that the distance between almost certain 
detection and almost certain failure of detection is smaller for the channelized 
radiometer.  
The choice of the observation interval for each channel is also important to 
the performance of the detector. This choice may be influenced by the hardware 
difficulties for detecting energy over such short intervals or due to lack of 
information about the pulse width of the signal to be detected. Figure 13.8

modulation schemes. (Detection is by a single radiometer using an observation window of 100 s,
computed using a path loss coefficient of 4, a BER at intended receiver of 10–4, and a Pfa of 10–2. The
UWB signal has a bandwidth W of 3.25 GHz, a pulse width of 400 ps, and a pulse repetition time of
1 s ). (Source: [9]. © IEEE 2002. Reprinted with permission.)

compares the performance of the channelized detector for different channel 
observation intervals. As the channel observation interval grows larger than the 
pulse duration, more noise is captured relative to the energy of the pulse resulting 
in a reduction of the SNR and the performance of the detector decreases. The 
performance of the channelized system to detect the binary PPM UWB signal with 
T0 = 25Tp (shown in Figure 13.8) yields roughly equivalent performance to the 
single wideband radiometer. The energy distribution over time of the pulse used 
determines the optimal value for the channel observation interval for the detector. 
Simulation revealed this optimum value is slightly less than Tp for detecting the 
UWB SOI described here. 
 
Summary 
 
The performance of a channelized radiometer detector was evaluated for use in 
detecting UWB signals and compared to the single wideband radiometer detector. 
The parameters that impact the performance of such a channelized detector were 
evaluated and it was shown that it is possible to construct a channelized radiometer 
detector that improves detectability of UWB signals over a single radiometer if 
sufficient information about the UWB system is known. 
 
 
13.3 Jamming UWB Signals 
 
UWB signal jamming can be accomplished with any of the techniques discussed 
in Chapter 8: barrage, partial band, tone, or multitone. Jamming effectiveness on

the synchronization and timing modules would depend on the particular system 
being examined, and thus far there have been very few UWB systems deployed. 
We examine the effectiveness of the first four techniques mentioned here. 
 
13.3.1 Jamming Effects on UWB Systems 
 
Tone jamming and narrowband interference causes significant problems for UWB 
systems. This is due to the low transmit power and the large bandwidth that 
contains multiple jamming tones, when MT jamming is considered. Due to the 
wide bandwidth of a UWB signal the most likely scenario encountered is tone 
jamming although the other types of jamming may apply as well.  
 
13.3.2 Processing Gain 
 
The robustness to interference of UWB systems is due to the processing gain. The 
processing gain in UWB is partly due to the number of pulses per bit (NS) and 
partly due to the duty ratio of the signal (Tp / Tf, where Tp is the length of the pulse 
and Tf is the length of the frame; there are NS pulses of length Tp each sent in the 
frame). Reception of a time hopping UWB signal using a matched filter essentially 
works as a time gate thereby effectively reducing the interference power. 
 
13.3.3 BBN Jamming 
 
Tesi et al. conducted simulation experiments to examine the performance of UWB 
signals in colored noise [11]. The noise had a total power of 10 dBm, and white 
noise was filtered with a raised cosine filter to produce the colored noise. Signal

power was fixed at 0 dBm. Processing gain was set at 20 dB, which was obtained 
with 10 dB from the duty cycle factor (Tf / Tp = 10) and 10 dB from coherent 
integration (L = 10). The SNR was fixed at 8 dB. 
 
Typical results are shown in Figure 13.9. In this case, BPAM was the 
modulation and time hopping was employed. The impulse had Tp = 1 ns. Similar 
to DSSS, the processing gain must be overcome before the jamming reached 
acceptable level.

where s(t) is the target UWB signal, j(t) is the jamming signal, and n(t) is noise. 
The jamming PSD is NJ = J / WJ where J is the jamming power. Any nonlinearity 
or front end saturation of the target receiver are not taken into account. 
 
13.3.5 Multitone Jamming 
 
Hämäläinen et al. documented an analysis of the effects of MT jamming on UWB 
communication signals [12]. In that analysis, 10 jammer tones were randomly 
placed within the passband of the UWB system. The total jamming power in all 
the tones was +15 dBm. 
 
A comparison of the MT jamming performance for BPAM and BPPM is 
illustrated in Figure 13.10. The goal of 10–1 BER was never achieved for either 
modulation type, which is typical for DSSS signals. 
  
Giorgetti, Chiani, and Win [13] documented the results of an analysis and 
simulation experiment on the effects of multiple narrowband interferers on UWB 
systems. The receiver they considered was the common matched filter (MF) 
receiver illustrated in Figure 13.11. Included in Figure 13.11 are a single target 
UWB signal at the receiver given by

13.3.6 Pulsed Jamming 
 
The effects of pulsed jamming on DSSS signals was discussed in Chapter 10. 
Pulsed jamming also affects UWB communication signals in a similar way. Tesi et 
al. conducted an analysis of the effects of pulsed jamming on UWB signals around 
2 GHz [11]. The pulsed signal in that analysis consisted of a truncated sinc pulse 
with a bandwidth of 60 MHz. The total average power for the jamming pulse was 
10 dBm. 
 
Typical results of the analysis are shown in Figure 13.15. As with DSSS, like 
BBN above, the processing gain was the limiting factor that precluded jamming at 
acceptable values of JSR.  
 
13.3.7 Partial-Band Noise Jamming 
 
The power scaling parameter ζ in Figure 13.16 represents the ratio between the 
UWB signal level at the center frequency of the jammer band ( fJ) to the UWB 
signal level at the UWB center frequency ( fc) and is given by:

Thus, just as in other forms of spread spectrum signaling, the processing gain 
reduces the PSD of the jammer by spreading the power of the interferer over the 
UWB bandwidth when despreading the UWB signal. The power scaling factor ζ 
represents the effectiveness of the jammer. If the jammer is located at a frequency 
with a low UWB PSD, it has less effect than when the jammer’s frequency is close 
to the maximum UWB PSD.

We assume that the jamming is narrowband when compared to the carrier 
frequency of the target bandpass signal. In the barrage jamming case, when the 
entire UWB bandwidth is jammed, the PSD of the jamming signal is NJ = J/W, 
where NJ and J denote one-sided power spectral density of the jammer and 
jamming power, respectively. With the jammer bandwidth denoted by WJ, the 
fraction of the partial band jamming PSD that overlaps the target signal PSD is

The BER is plotted against different JSR values using the seventh Gaussian 
pulse derivative (Tp = 0.5 ns) with two Eb/N0 values—3 dB and 8 dB in Figure 
13.17 [15]. Interference is located at 6 GHz having different bandwidths. In Figure 
13.18, the corresponding BERs as a function of JSR are given for the first and 
seventh derivatives of the Gaussian pulse when the center frequency of the 
interference varies but the bandwidth is fixed to 20 MHz. The impact of the 
increased desired signal bandwidth on improved sensitivity against the 
interference can be easily seen from the curves. When the first derivative is used, 
WJ/W ≈ 4.6% but for the seventh, WJ/W ≈ 0.33% using WJ = 20 MHz.

Figure 13.19 is an example of jamming performance against a UWB TH-PPM 
link for a single tone jammer, with the levels of SNR indicated. For these curves, 
the pulse time was  Tp = 500 ps, the frame time was Tf = 100 ns, the delta offset 
was  = 300 ps, there were 2 pulses per symbol, and the jammer was at fJ = 2.412 
GHz. Also neither the target link nor the jammer to receiver link experienced 
fading and the noise was AWGN. This chart is an illustration of the relative 
immunity of the UWB link to jamming. Comparing this with Figures 13.17 and 
13.18 we see that the jamming performance is considerably worse. The reason for 
this is here we have a  single tone, implying zero  jamming  bandwidth whereas in 
Figures 13.17 and 13.18, the jammer signal was substantially more broadband and 
much more of the spectrum was impaired by the jammer. 
 
 
13.4 Concluding Remarks 
 
In this chapter the detectability and jam capability of an EW system when 
targeting UWB targets was examined. We determined that UWB signals are 
difficult to jam because of their processing gain. The processing gain is the 
product of two factors: Tf /Tp and L, where L represents the number of pulses per 
symbol. As with DSSS targets, essentially the processing gain must be overcome 
before the jamming is effective. 
UWB signals are detectable with a channelized radiometer; however, doing so 
is expensive. Essentially a (time) channel is required for each possible pulse time, 
and, for example, when Tf = 1 s and Tp = 1 ns, there are 1,000 possible pulse

codes are used to move the SOI around in the time slots.

Electronic Warfare and Hybrid Spread 
Spectrum Systems 
 
 
14.1 Introduction 
 
Hybrid spread spectrum signals are made of combinations of the two basic forms 
of spread spectrum signaling: DSSS and FHSS. Although more complicated to 
design and build than either DSSS or FHSS systems alone, the combination 
provides some very attractive features for the communicator. DSSS is an LPD 
technique that hides the signal, sometimes below the thermal noise level, but in 
any case, makes the signal look like noise. The FHSS aspect makes the signal 
difficult to associate one hop with the next with an ES system, therefore making 
hop dwell association difficult. It also provides for frequency diversity, mitigating 
the effects of frequency selective fading. 
The structure of this chapter is as follows. First, we review what a hybrid SS 
system is. We then examine jamming performance of coherent hybrid systems, 
taking a look at BBN, PBN, MT, and NBN follower methodologies. Last we 
explore noncoherent hybrid SS systems using the same jammer strategies. 
 
 
14.2 Hybrid SS Systems 
  
Only SFHSS systems are discussed in this chapter. This is because DSSS/FFHSS 
systems are difficult to build for all but the lowest throughput communication 
systems. Their application to the mobile, tactical scenario has been limited. 
The DSSS signal must be code locked and synchronized in order to retrieve the 
underlying data. Therefore, either code-coherence must be maintained from hop to 
hop, or the code must be resynchronized at the new hop frequency. In the latter 
case, data throughput is reduced. In the former case, if code coherency is lost it 
also must be reacquired. It is assumed here that for FHSS, noncoherent

demodulation is employed. Coherent demodulation of the DSSS signal is 
considered first then noncoherent DSSS demodulation is examined. 
The hybrid processing gain is given by

where ND denotes the DSSS processing gain and the FHSS processing gain is NF 
(= Nc). These are linear terms, not in decibels. Therefore, substantial overall 
processing gain is achievable with only moderate individual processing gain. 
The appellation SFHSS is somewhat of a misnomer when it comes to hybrid 
SS systems. It normally means more than one data bit is transmitted on each hop. 
What it is intended to infer with hybrid systems is that at each hop dwell the signal 
can be treated as if it were not hopping at all and the associated DSSS signal can 
be treated as such. This, then, ignores transition times between hops and the 
accompanying phase acquisition issues, when phase coherence acquisition is 
required. 
 
As with any hopping system, the signals from multiple sources occasionally 
collide. If the systems are operating asynchronously, they do not share hop timing 
(epoch) information. Therefore, when they collide there can be full or partial 
temporal overlap. It is assumed that even in the asynchronous case, the hop rates 
are common. 
 
Let N denote the length of the DSSS spreading code. It was discussed in 
Chapter 10 that for DSSS systems, long spreading codes are desirable for anti-ES 
reasons. One problem with long codes, however, is that acquiring them at the 
receiver can take longer than allowed for hybrid systems—code acquisition must 
be significantly shorter than the hop dwell. Determining the location in the 
spreading sequence must be done rapidly in such systems so that the majority of 
the dwell can be used to send data in SFHSS applications. Therefore, short codes 
are normally used in DSSS/FHSS hybrid systems. Thus, for the majority of this 
analysis, short DS codes are assumed, so that N = ND. One case is considered later 
in the chapter where long codes are used.  
 
In this chapter, only uncoded signals are considered. 
 
 
 
14.3 Coherent Reception 
 
When signals are coherently detected at a receiver, knowledge of the phase of the 
incoming signal is required so that the receiver can phase lock to it. When an 
FHSS signal changes frequency the phase coherency is lost, for coherent 
demodulation of the DSSS signal the hopping rate must be slow enough so that the 
phase lock can be regained and meaningful data can be exchanged.

For brevity here, the underlying PN codes are assumed random. Geranoitis [1] 
considers this case as well as deterministic and Gold coded sequences, the latter of 
which would be the normal case. 
 
A block diagram of a DSSS/SFHSS transmitter is shown in Figure 14.1. This 
same diagram applies whether the system is coherent or noncoherent. The 
coherency occurs in the DSSS modulator before the frequency hopping is applied 
[1]. The signal from the DSSS modulator for BPSK can be expressed as

where S is the average power in the signal, a(t) = c(t)w(t) is the shaped code 
sequence where c(t) is the code sequence and has values from {–1, +1} of duration 
Tc [w(t) is weighting applied to this sequence to achieve specific signaling 
characteristics], fc is the IF, d(t) is the data sequence consisting of bits from         
{–1, +1} of duration Tb, and (t) is the phase imposed by the DSSS modulator. 
Short DSSS codes are assumed so that there are N code pulses for each data bit 
and Tb = NTc and the period of the code sequence is N. 
 
This signal is then hopped by multiplication by cos[2f(t)t + (t)] where (t) 
remains constant for the duration of the dwell. The signal from the mixer is

The final RF oscillator puts the resultant signal where desired in the spectrum. 
A block diagram of a coherent DSSS/SFHSS receiver is shown in Figure 14.2. 
The first bandpass filter has a bandwidth equal to the total of the hopped and 
spread signal. Then the signal is asynchronously dehopped. The dehopped signal is 
then bandpass filtered with a filter of width Wss, which removes unwanted noise 
and interference that are not in the pass band of interest, but passes the DSSS

signal of bandwidth Wss. The resulting signal is multiplied by a phase-coherent 
replica of the coded signal at the transmitter, integrated for a bit time, Tb, and a 
decision made as to which symbol was sent. 
The signal received is corrupted by noise in the channel and possibly other 
interfering signals, which may cause the data bit to be detected in error. For 
coherent DSSS/FHSS systems, the probability of a symbol error for coherent 
detection can be approximated as [1]

where L is the number of users in the geographical vicinity of each other, and l is 
the number of full hits. A full hit is total temporal overlap of two or more signals. 
Partial hits are also possible in asynchronous systems, where only part of a hop 
dwell collides with another signal. Expression (14.4) is only an approximation 
because the effects of such partial hits are ignored. Pe,f(l) is the error probability 
given that l full hits have occurred from the other L – 1 users. It is assumed that the 
frequency spectrum is channelized so that there is no overlap of the signals in

14.3.5 BBN Jamming of Coherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
As mentioned above, DSSS/SFHSS communication systems within range of each 
other can operate synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the timing 
information that is available. If all communication nodes have the same timing 
information, synchronous operation is possible. Otherwise, only asynchronous 
operation is possible. This issue is exacerbated by the hidden node problem in 
networks.1 
 
14.3.5.1 BBN Jamming of Coherent Asynchronous DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
The jamming performance, in general, is different depending on whether the DSSS 
modulation is BPSK or QPSK. These cases are treated separately.

14.3.5.2 BBN Jamming Coherent Synchronous DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
The discussions after (14.4) would lead us to believe that the jamming 
performance against synchronous and asynchronous systems would be the same. 
This is because Pe is approximated by assuming that all the hits are synchronous. 
There is, however, a subtle difference in the way P is calculated. For asynchronous 
systems, P is given by (14.7). For synchronous systems, Pp = 0 and 
 
 
f
P
P

 
(14.23) 
 
Other than this difference, Pe is calculated with (14.4) and the variables as 
expressed in (14.5), (14.6), (14.8), and (14.23).

14.3.6 PBN Jamming of Coherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
The notion of PBN jamming of DSSS/FFSS systems is illustrated in Figure 14.3. 
We assume for convenience and without much loss in generality that the edges of 
the jamming spectrum are aligned with the edges of two channels and the DSSS 
spectrum occupies the entirety of one channel of width WF, with no overlap. The 
average power in the DSSS signal is then

When only a portion of the spectrum is jammed then there are channels that

The same comments as in Section 14.3.5.2 apply here as well, and the BER is 
calculated in the same way as in the last section using the appropriate change of 
variables. 
 
14.3.7 Multitone Jamming of Coherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
As shown in Chapters 10, 11, and 12, multitone jamming can be effective against 
both DSSS and FHSS systems. Techniques have been devised to attempt to 
mitigate the effects of tone jamming against hybrid systems as well. Such 
techniques consist of filtering out tone interference or jamming tones in the 
frequency domain by eliminating narrowband regions of the spectrum [3, 4]. In 
this section the effects of partial hits are ignored; thus, the communication 
networks are synchronized. 
The notion of MT jamming of hybrid DSSS/FHSS systems is illustrated in 
Figure 14.5 when NJ = 2. A tone is placed in several of the DSSS channels and the 
hybrid signal will either hop into one of the channels with a jammer tone in it, or it 
will hop into a channel where there is no such tone. Again, the fraction  of Wss 
jammed is given by 
 
 
J
c
N
N

 
 (14.28) 
 
 
Best-case jamming occurs when the jammer knows the hopping center 
frequency and places a jamming tone near, but not at, that point. Jamming 
performance degrades when the jamming tone is offset by large distances from fk, 
whereas close to the center frequency jamming performance is relatively 
independent of the tone offset. At zero offset, the despreading process significantly

multitone jammer, within each DSSS channel there is only one tone at any given instant.

degrades the jamming tone [5] as indicated in Section 10.7.8. Offset from the 
center frequency by the symbol rate produces the best jamming performance. 
Haiou and Naitong [6] performed an analysis of the effects of multitone 
jammers on coherent QPSK DSSS/SFHSS hybrid systems. The communication

For the parameters illustrated, MT jamming achieves Pe > 10–1 at  = 15 dB 
when  = 0.3 and ND = 7 which is about 5 dB higher than BBN and PBN jamming. 
When  = 0.1, inadequate jamming performance ensues for all values of JSR 
considered. Below about  = 0 dB, the BER remains relatively constant and 
independent of .

14.3.8 NBN Follower Jamming of Coherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
Follower jamming can be employed against DSSS/SFHSS systems with any of the 
jamming waveforms discussed in Chapter 8. The same timing limitations as in 
Chapter 12 exist for hybrid SS systems, but, because of the difficulty detecting the 
DS signal rapidly, the problem is exacerbated. Normally it is necessary to process 
several chips of the DS signal in order to ascertain whether the signal exists in a 
frequency channel [7]. 
For SFHSS, there would be, typically, 100 data bits or more during any dwell. 
Each of these data bits is spread by the DS signal. Since short codes are normally 
used, it would not be unusual to have on the order of 7–31 chips per data bit in 
such a system. If N = 7 and if the data rate is 10 kbps, then the chip waveform 
would be 70 kcps yielding a main lobe 3 dB bandwidth of 140 kHz. 
 
Once the target is selected, jamming would be accomplished by attacking the 
data (DS) channel since the data modulation is PSK. Neglecting the added 
difficulty of tracking hybrid signals from hop to hop, the jamming performance is 
the same as for nonhopped DS spread signals discussed in Chapter 10. The 
tracking can be taken into account in the same way as follower jamming in 
Chapter 12. 
 
14.3.9 Jamming Coherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems Comparisons 
 
This section presents the performance of BBN and PBN jamming against coherent 
DSSS/SFHSS systems. Figure 14.7 illustrates a few values of the parameters. Of 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
720
course, the BBN performance does not vary as  is varied so BBN jamming results 
in the same curve in Figure 14.7. 
 
For PBN, the goal of Pe = 10–1 is not achieved. For  = 10 dB, whether  is 
0.1 or 0.3, the results do not vary significantly. When  = 20 dB, with low values 
of JSR,  = 0.1 actually increases more rapidly as the JSR is increased. For  > 15 
dB, or so,  = 0.3 surpasses that of  = 0.1, however. 
 
 
14.4 Noncoherent Reception 
 
For coherent demodulation of a received signal, the local demodulation oscillator 
must be phase locked to the incoming signal so the phase information can be 
extracted. In some cases, such phase synchronization is not feasible, for example, 
when the noise or interference levels are too high. In those cases, noncoherent 
detection is preferred and can be used to avoid the requirement for the phase lock. 
In this section the performance of BBN, PBN, and MT jamming against 
noncoherent DSSS modulation types BFSK, MFSK, and DPSK are examined [8]. 
 
For BFSK DSSS modulation, the signal from the DSSS modulator shown in 
Figure 14.1 that is to be hopped is given by

which consists of square pulses with values from {–1, +1} of duration Tc; w(t) is

Tb;  is the frequency offset of the BFSK signal above and below fc; and (t) is the

there are N code pulses for each data bit and Tb = NTc and the period of the code 
sequence is N. 
 
A receiver for noncoherent BFSK is illustrated in Figure 14.8. The received 
signal is first noncoherently dehopped after bandpass filtering with bandwidth Wss. 
The dehopping mixer is then followed by a bandpass filter of bandwidth WF, that 
of the DSSS signal. This signal, r(t) is then sent to the DSSS despreader. The 
upper two integrate and dump channels of the despreader will integrate those chips 
that are offset from fc on the additive side while those in the lower two integrate 
and dump channels in Figure 14.8 will accumulate energy when the chip is offset 
on the lower side of fc. After one bit time, Tb, the outputs of the accumulated 
channels are compared and a bit decision is made. 
 
For MFSK DSSS modulation, (14.37) still applies, but the data bits d(t) are 
selected from the set {1, 2, , M} and the duration of each symbol is Ts = Tb log2 
M and the period of the code is NMFSK = N log2 M. The receiver for MFSK is the 
same as that shown in Figure 14.8 with more filter channels added in the normal 
way.

where, in this case, d(t) is a differentially encoded version of the data sequence. 
Otherwise, the variables are the same. While the transmitter for DPSK is the same 
as that shown in Figure 14.1, the receiver is different. It is shown in Figure 14.9. 
After being dehopped by an NCO that is synchronized with the transmitter 
hopping sequence, the signal is sent to two identical demodulation channels as 
shown in Figure 14.9, where the lower channel is delayed by one bit time. The in-
phase and quadrature-phase channels of the delayed channel are compared to their 
counterpart in the current symbol to detect the differential phase change. Again, 
after one bit time a decision is made as to what the accumulated phase change was. 
 
In general, for noncoherent DSSS/FHSS systems, the probability of a symbol 
error for noncoherent detection can be expressed as [2]

where L is the number of users in the geographical vicinity of each other, lf is the 
number of full hits, and lp is the number of partial hits. A full hit is total temporal 
overlap of two or more signals while a partial hit is some, but less than full, 
temporal overlap. Ph(lf, lp) is the probability of lf full hits and lp partial hits from

the other L – 1 users while Pe(lf, lp) is the conditional error probability given that lf 
full hits and lp partial hits have occurred. It is assumed that the frequency spectrum 
is channelized so that there is no overlap of the signals in frequency. All hits are 
temporal rather than in the frequency domain. 
 
14.4.1 Noncoherent Asynchronous DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
In asynchronous hybrid systems, the signals hop independently of one another, 
changing frequency according to a timing plan that applies to each network 
independently. Therefore, the signals can interfere with one another either partially 
or fully. In general, both of these types of collisions can increase the BER, 
depending on the SNRs involved. 
For asynchronous systems, Ph(lf, lp ) is given by [2]

In this case, the term synchronous means that all the radios hop from one 
frequency to the next at the same time. When the DSSS/FHSS hybrid system is 
synchronous, there can be only full hits. In that case, lp makes no sense and (14.39) 
using (14.40) reduces to

14.4.3 BBN Jamming of Noncoherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
Just as for DSSS and FHSS systems, BBN jamming raises the background noise 
level as if the noise were that much higher. The jammer signal bandwidth is 
assumed to be at least as wide as the total bandwidth of the DSSS/FHSS system 
denoted by Wss. 
 
14.4.3.1 Noncoherent Asynchronous DSSS/SFHSS 
 
In this section the BBN jamming performance against BFSK, MFSK, and DPSK 
modulated noncoherent asynchronous signals will be presented. 
 
BFSK 
 
The conditional probability of error given that lf full hits and lp partial hits have 
occurred for DSSS/FH hybrid SS system employing BFSK as the DSSS 
modulation and BBN as the jamming waveform is given by [2]

Figure 14.10 illustrates the BBN jamming performance when an asynchronous 
DSSS/SFHSS hybrid system uses these modulations for a square chip waveform. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
726
For all of the modulation types it takes a JSR of about 10 dB or more to achieve a 
BER of 10–1. BBN is most effective against BFSK and least effective against 
DPSK. 
 
14.4.3.2 Noncoherent Synchronous DSSS/SFHSS 
 
BBN jamming performance against synchronous DSSS/SFHSS systems is 
presented here. It is assumed that Wss = NcWF, where the width of each 
communication channel is WF, so that the entire spectrum is covered by the 
jammer.

which, likewise, is the same as (14.51) with lp = 0 and C = ½ . 
BBN jamming performance against synchronous systems is also shown in 
Figure 14.10 for these modulation types. For the range of BER of importance here, 
the jamming performance is virtually the same. What differences there are, occur 
at low values of JSR and therefore low BER. At these levels, BBN jamming is 
more effective against synchronous targets. For DPSK, jamming effectiveness is 
the same for both synchronous and asynchronous targets. Also we can note that, 
just as for nonhopping DSSS systems discussed in Chapter 10, the DSSS 
processing gain must be overcome before the jamming is effective. 
 
14.4.4 PBN Jamming of Noncoherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems

The first term in (14.56) is due to the hop not landing on a jammed channel and no 
overlap with another emitter so any error is due to noise only, while the second 
accounts for the case when the communication system hops into a jammed 
channel.

eP depends on the type of DS modulation employed and is computed as 
indicated in this section. 
 
14.4.4.1 Noncoherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
PBN jamming allows for concentrating a greater amount of power over a smaller 
portion of the spectrum than BBN and demonstrates the tradeoff between higher 
power in a smaller portion of the spectrum and broader spectrum coverage, albeit 
with lower power everywhere. 
 
Table 14.1 gives the expressions for
2eP (kf, kp) for asynchronous and 
synchronous PBN jamming of hybrid systems. As above, in synchronous 
applications, the epoch information is known among all the communication nodes 
within range of each other. Therefore, there are no partial hits. PBN jamming 
performance against asynchronous DSSS/SFHSS hybrid systems is illustrated in 
Figure 14.11 for typical values of the parameters. The 10–1 BER for the FSK 
modulations is achieved at   20 dB, the value of the DSSS processing gain, and 
is not achieved for DPSK. 
Just as for BBN jamming, the differences between asynchronous and 
synchronous occur at low JSR values. For practical values of JSR where Pe > 10–1,

there is no difference between the two. The performance results are therefore very 
similar. 
 
14.4.5 Multitone Jamming of Noncoherent DSSS/SFHSS Systems 
 
14.4.5.1 Nonoverlapping Channels 
 
An analysis of MT jamming effects on noncoherent DSSS/SFHSS systems when 
the DSSS channels were not allowed to overlap, as previously assumed, was 
conducted by Laxpati [9]. See Figure 14.12(a). Only synchronous systems were 
considered in that analysis as well. Jamming tone frequency offsets were included, 
however. With a posteriori detection, the probability of detecting the correct 
MFSK symbol is given by the probability of not selecting any of the other M – 1 
incorrect symbols; thus

achieved for these values and SNRs. Furthermore,  > 10 dB before any 
significant jamming effects are noted at all. 
  
Figure 14.14 illustrates some of the effects of offsets of the jamming tones. 
Jammer tones are placed at offsets of 0.5/Tc and 1/Tc. The jamming performance is 
not significantly dependent on the tone offset placement as seen in this example. 
 
14.4.5.2 Overlapping DSSS Channels 
 
Laxpati and Gluck [10] examined the hybrid case with MT jamming when the 
DSSS channels are allowed to overlap as illustrated in Figure 14.12(b). Again, 
noncoherent  detection  of  the  MFSK  signal was assumed. They also considered 
long codes, irrespective of the DSSS synchronization issues. Their results indicate 
that the probability of a correct symbol decision in the jth slot is given by

An example of the results of this analysis is illustrated in Figure 14.15. For 
this example there are 491 channels available to the communication system. As for 
the nonhopping DSSS systems discussed in Chapter 10, the jamming is relatively 
ineffective until the DSSS processing gain is overcome. 
 
14.4.6 Jamming DSSS/SFHSS Performance Comparisons 
 
In this section the three types of jamming waveforms are compared against one 
another for a given modulation type and jamming performance against 
synchronized timing is compared with that for asynchronous timing. 
Figure 14.16 illustrates BBN and PBN jamming performance for asynchronous 
and synchronous epochs and BFSK modulation. Several observations can be 
concluded from Figure 14.16: 
 
 
BBN and PBN jamming of asynchronous targets produces the same 
results. 
 
Pe > 10–1 for  > 15 dB for both values of N. 
 
Figure 14.15 Example of results when considering overlapping DS channels in hybrid DSSS/SFHSS
systems with noncoherent BFSK. In this case there are 491 channels. K = 10,  = 0. The jamming tones
have fixed, minimal spacing. (After: [10]. © IEEE 1995. Reprinted with permission.)

 
As expected, DSSS signals with shorter spreading sequence length are 
more susceptible to jamming. 
 
For JSR values of interest, synchronous and asynchronous timing react to 
the same type of jamming in the same way. 
 
If the goal is to produce a BER greater than 10–1, then the selection of PBN or 
BBN is arbitrary and can be made for other reasons, such as fratricide avoidance. 
Figure 14.17 shows a comparison of the three jamming techniques against 
asynchronous BFSK and QFSK. From this example we can see that BBN jamming 
at  > 5 dB or so outperforms the other two techniques. At  < 5 dB, PBN 
jamming produces the most errors. MT jamming is the worst performer for all 
conditions and produces the same results against both BFSK and QFSK with these 
parameters. 
  
 
14.5 Concluding Remarks 
 
Jamming performance using standard jamming waveforms against hybrid SS 
systems was explored in this chapter. The three jamming waveforms considered 
were BBN, PBN, and multitone. Targets employing BFSK, MFSK, and DPSK 
modulations were evaluated as well for SFHSS formats.

For the examples considered, with parameters nominal for the targets 
expected, it can be concluded that PBN jamming performs best at low JSR values 
while BBN jamming is best at higher values.

Characteristics of Urban Terrain 
 
 
15.1 Introduction 
 
The military cognoscenti have always viewed cities as centers of gravity—
something to be either protected or taken away during war. The population 
centers, transportation hubs, seats of government, sources of wealth, centers for 
industry, information networks, and key nodes of communication within a nation 
are normally located in the cities. Forecasts based on the worldwide migration 
trend from agrarian to industrialized societies predict that 85 percent of the 
world’s population will reside in urbanized areas by 2025. As the world trend 
toward urbanization increases, the military significance of cities likewise must go 
up. 
Urban areas are today (in many cases), and will be in the future, significant 
sources of conflict. Cities are where radical ideas ferment and are freely 
propagated, dissenters and discontents find allies, mixtures of people cause ethnic 
friction (frequently based on religious beliefs), and disgruntled groups receive 
media attention. Adversaries may focus on the capture of radio and television 
stations in an attempt to influence public opinion and attain their political goals. 
The United States is likely to be forced to neutralize or stabilize some extremely 
volatile political situations, or provide assistance to allies in need of support, by 
deploying forces into urban environments [1–4]. 
For the foreseeable future, western forces will be facing urban 
gorillas/terrorists as the primary adversary. One of the fundamental tenents of such 
forces is to take advantage of asymmetric techniques such as manipulating the 
media and therefore sentiments back home. This is best done in places where there 
is a considerable population concentration: urban areas [5]. 
Conducting EW operations in an urban setting brings with it a myriad of 
problems that don’t exist in an open, rural environment (at least not as severely). 
In this chapter we introduce some of the characteristics of urban terrain, laying the 
groundwork for discussions of the EW techniques in cities in Chapters 16 and 17.  

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
740
Signal propagation in cities, especially in areas where there are high-rise 
buildings, is significantly different from rural terrain. Few of the signals are 
received over a direct path. To quantify this, models have been developed to 
primarily estimate signal strength at a receiver. Such models are discussed in 
Chapter 16. Likewise the noise sources likely to be encountered in urban areas are 
fundamentally different from rural settings. Where at a quiet receiving site in rural 
environments a sensitive EW system must deal with principally thermal noise 
sources, in an urban environment the predominant noise is likely to emerge from 
man-made sources, which is decidedly non-Gaussian in nature. We focused on 
understanding these sources of noise in Chapter 2. Finally, in Chapter 17 we 
consider EW operations in urban terrain and specifically focus on the particular 
problems such environments pose.  
 
 
 
15.2 Military Operations in Urbanized Terrain 
 
Military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) is defined as all military actions 
planned and conducted on a topographical complex and its adjacent terrain where 
man-made construction is the dominant feature. It includes combat in cities, which 
is that portion of MOUT involving house-to-house and street-by-street fighting in 
towns and cities [6]. MOUT affects the tactical options available to a commander. 
A built-up area is a concentration of structures, facilities, and populations, such as 
villages, cities, and towns, which form the economic and cultural focus for the 
surrounding area. 
 
 
15.3 Cities 
 
Cities are centers of populations, finance, politics, transportation, communication, 
industry, and culture. They generally have large population concentrations ranging 
from tens of thousands to millions of people. Because of their psychological, 
political, or logistical value, control of cities have often been the scenes of pitched 
battles. 
Operations in built-up areas are normally conducted to capitalize on the 
operational or tactical significance of a particular city. The side that controls a 
major city usually has a psychological advantage, which can be enough to 
significantly affect the outcome of a countrywide conflict. In developing nations, 
control of only a few cities is often the key to the control of national resources.  
The abundance of guerrilla and terrorist operations conducted in built-up areas 
(e.g., Santo Domingo, Caracas, Belfast, Managua, Beirut, Bagdad, Sana’a) 
demonstrates the importance many insurgent groups place on urban warfare. 

Characteristics of Urban Terrain 
741
Many cities have expanded dramatically in the past several years, thereby 
losing their well-defined boundaries as they extended into the countryside. 
Transportation systems (highways, canals, and railroads) have been built to 
connect population centers while industries have grown along those connectors, 
creating ―strip areas.‖ Rural areas are connected to the towns by a network of 
secondary roads. 
 
15.3.1 Multiple Avenues of Approach  
 
Urban terrain is a unique battlespace that provides both the attacker and defender 
with numerous and varied avenues of approach and fields of fire. The urban 
battlespace is divided into four basic levels: building, street, subterranean, and air. 
Operations can be conducted from above ground, on ground level, inside 
buildings, or below the ground, typically with fighting on all levels 
simultaneously. 
 
15.3.1.1 Building Level 
 
Buildings provide cover and concealment; limit or increase fields of observation 
and fire; and canalize, restrict, or block movement of forces, especially 
mechanized forces. They provide optimum perches for snipers and antiair 
weapons. Buildings also provide antitank weapons optimum positioning to allow 
engagement from above, exploiting an inherent weakness found in most armored 
vehicles—their top. As we will see, buildings, especially tall ones, significantly 
increase the space for war fighters to occupy. 
 
15.3.1.2 Street Level 
 
While streets provide the means for rapid advance or withdrawal, forces moving 
along streets are often canalized by buildings and have little space for off-road 
maneuver. Because they are more difficult to bypass, obstacles on streets in 
urbanized areas are usually more effective than those on roads in open terrain. 
 
15.3.1.3 Subterranean Level 
 
Subterranean systems are easily overlooked but can be important to the outcome 
of operations. These areas include subways, sewers, cellars, and utility systems 
(see Figure 15.1). The city of Los Angeles alone has more than 200 miles of storm 
sewers located under the city streets. Both attacker and defender can use 
subterranean avenues to maneuver to the rear or the flanks of an enemy. These 
avenues also facilitate the conduct of ambushes, counterattacks, and infiltrations. 
 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
742
15.3.1.4 Air Level 
 
The air provides another avenue of approach in urban areas. Aviation assets can be 
used for high speed insertion or extraction of troops, supplies, and equipment. 
While aviation assets are not affected by obstacles on the streets, they are affected 
by tall buildings, light towers, signs, power lines, and other aerial obstructions. 
They are also vulnerable to the man-portable surface-to-air missile threat, crew 
served weapons, and small arms fire. Helicopters and UAS provide the necessary 
maneuverability, while fixed wing aircraft would typically be relegated to 
transport and broad area activities, such as intelligence collection. Significant 
portions of a city can be affected by EW operations from fixed wing aircraft. 
 
15.3.2 Categories of Built-Up Areas 
 
Built-up areas are sometimes, and somewhat arbitrarily, classified as: 
 
 
Villages (populations of 3,000 or less); 
 
Strip areas (industrialized zones built along roads connecting towns or 
cities); 
 
Towns or small cities (populations from 3,000 to 100,000 and not part of 
a major urban complex); 
 
Figure 15.1 Subterranean systems. Urban terrain has several opportunities for subterranean systems 
such as the subway depicted here. Such subterranean systems extend the three dimensional battlespace 
to a full sphere, not just the hemisphere above ground. 

Characteristics of Urban Terrain 
743
 
Large cities with associated urban sprawl (populations in the millions, 
covering hundreds of square kilometers). 
 
Military operations that may work well in one of these settings may not work at all 
in the others. We have learned that the traditional tactics applied to large forces 
moving across rural terrain, in many cases do not work in urban settings. 
 
15.3.3 Characteristics of Urban Areas 
 
A typical urban environment consists of combinations of one or more city cores, 
commercial ribbons, core peripheries, residential sprawl, outlying industrial areas, 
and outlying high-rise areas. Each of the urban area’s regions has distinctive 
characteristics that may weigh heavily and differently in planning for MOUT. 
Many cities consist of a core containing high-rise buildings surrounded by a 
much larger area having buildings of relatively uniform height spread over regions 
comprising many square blocks, except for isolated clusters of high-rise buildings. 
In this surrounding urban area the buildings lining one side of a street are adjacent 
to each other or have passageways between them that are narrower than the width 
of the buildings. The street grid organizes the buildings into rows that are nearly 
parallel. 
 
15.3.3.1 City Core 
 
In many cities, the city core has undergone more recent development than the core 
periphery. As a result, the two regions are often quite different—both in terms of 
architecture as well as building materials. Typical city cores are made up of high-
rise buildings made of concrete and steel which vary in height. Modern urban 
planning for built-up areas allows for more open spaces between buildings than in 
old city cores or in core peripheries (see Figure 15.2). 
 
15.3.3.2 Commercial Ribbons 
 
Commercial ribbons are composed of rows of stores, shops, and restaurants that 
are built along both sides of major streets through built-up areas. Typically, such 
streets are 25 meters wide or more. The buildings in the outer areas are uniformly 
two to three stories tall—about one story taller than the dwellings on the streets 
behind them (see Figure 15.3).

Figure 15.2 Typical urban core. 

Characteristics of Urban Terrain 
745
15.3.3.3 Core Periphery 
 
The core periphery generally consists of streets 12–20 meters wide with 
continuous fronts of brick or concrete buildings. The building heights are fairly 
uniform—2 or 3 stories in small towns, 5 to 10 or more stories in large cities 
(Figure 15.4). 
 
15.3.3.4 Residential Sprawl 
 
Residential sprawl areas consist mainly of low houses or apartments that are one to 
three stories tall. The area is primarily composed of detached dwellings that are 
usually arranged in irregular patterns along streets, with many smaller open areas 
between structures (Figure 15.5). 
 
15.3.3.5 Outlying Industrial Areas 
 
These areas generally consist of clusters of industrial buildings varying from one 
to five stories in height. Buildings generally vary dramatically in size and 
composition to match the needs of the particular businesses they house. Industrial 
parks found in many larger cities are good examples of this category (Figure 15.6).

15.3.3.6 Outlying High-Rise Areas 
 
These areas are similar in composition to city core areas, but may be composed of 
clusters of more modern multistory high-rise buildings in outlying parts of the city. 
Building height and size may vary dramatically (Figure 15.7). Generally, there is 
more open space between buildings located in the outlying high-rise areas than is 
found within the city core area. 
 
 
15.4 Characteristics of Urban Warfare 
 
We cover some of the relevant characteristics of warfare in an urban setting in this 
section. We will focus on those most relevant to the EW issues of operation in 
such terrain. 
Urban warfare is warfare of vertical envelopment, rather than horizontal, the 
way most developed militaries have been trained to fight. It requires tactical 
thinking in three dimensions. Units must maintain ―spherical‖ security at all times. 
The three-dimensional nature of the urban battlespace requires all-around security. 
Subterranean pathways through cities can allow forces to relatively easily move 
past and/or around friendly units, facilitating attacks from surprise directions.  
 
Figure 15.7 Outlying high-rise area. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
748
 
15.4.1 Asymmetric Tactics 
 
While it can be said that as of this writing there are no significant peer adversaries 
of the United States, what adversaries there are will likely choose asymmetric 
tactics, attacking the places where the United States is weakest (homeland 
sympathies, for example). Another example is propaganda via the Internet. 
 
15.4.2 Difficult Terrain 
 
An adversary can hide in buildings and fight through windows. Movement from 
one building to the next can frequently be accomplished without detection and 
sometimes such movement can be accomplished without going outside. 
 
Signals typically don’t take direct paths in a city. (We will talk much more 
extensively about signal propagation in the next chapter.) At any given receive 
site, whether it’s the targets’ receiver or the receiver of an EW system, the signals 
intercepted are comprised of several replicas of the target signal, each delayed by a 
different amount due to the different paths taken from the transmitter to the 
receiver. Signals are reflected off buildings and diffracted around edges of 
buildings. To complicate the matter further, moving objects cause the reflections 
on these paths to be time varying and significant fading in and out of the received 
signal occurs. This fading can be on the order of 30 dB or more within the distance 
of a wavelength (tens of centimeters). 
 
15.4.3 Identification of Friend from Foe 
 
When the adversary acts, dresses, looks, and talks like the indigenous population, 
it can be difficult identifying one from the other. The warfighters can readily blend 
into the crowd with no one the wiser. With widespread proliferation of PCS 
devices, including cellular phones and personal digital assistants, an adversarial 
war fighter can be executing C2 while walking down the street, mixed in with non-
combatants. 
 
15.4.4 Underground Enemy 
 
As mentioned, the basements of buildings as well as other subterranean features, 
such as subways, causes the battlespace environment to occupy more than just the 
hemisphere defined as above the ground. Significantly sized forces can move 
undetected through subway tunnels to cross from one side of a city to the other.  
Communications is particularly difficult in subterranean settings, however. 
While signals can propagate down subway tunnels, they do not propagate through 
the ground at all well. This gets progressively worse as the frequency increases. 

Characteristics of Urban Terrain 
749
This poses issues with C2 of adversarial (and friendly) forces, but also creates 
intercept and jamming issues by friendly forces. 
Urban terrain is a complex and challenging environment. It possesses all of 
the characteristics of the natural landscape, coupled with manmade construction, 
resulting in an incredibly complicated and fluid environment that influences the 
conduct of military operations in unique ways.  
 
At street level the signals emanating from an elevated fixed transmitting 
antenna are shadowed by the buildings, which gets more severe as the frequency 
increases. Except along occasional streets aligned with the transmitter, or at very 
close ranges, the transmitting antenna is not visible from street level. Thus 
propagation must take place through or between buildings, reflected off one or 
more, or over the rooftops with signals diffracted at the roofs down to street level. 
 
Signal propagation through buildings is accompanied by loss due to 
reflection, attenuation, and scattering by exterior and interior walls. While the 
energy penetrating the row of buildings immediately in front of the MT may be 
significant, the majority of the propagation path cannot include passing through 
buildings. When passageways do exist between buildings, they are seldom aligned 
from row to row and aligned with the transmitting source. As a result, the majority 
of the paths are either over the rooftops or consist of one or more reflections off 
the sides of buildings. The field reaching street level results from diffraction of the 
fields incident on the rooftops in the vicinity of the mobile antenna. While the 
process by which the energy at the rooftops or reflected from a wall reach the 
mobile antenna may be quite complicated, the process is still expected to take 
place in the immediate vicinity of the MT. 
 
15.4.5 Armor 
 
Tanks and armored personnel carriers cannot conveniently operate in cities 
without extensive dismounted infantry support. Rubble from fallen buildings can 
get in the way of effective movement. Recovering damaged armored vehicles is 
more difficult in urban areas for the same reason. Tracked vehicles are preferable 
to wheeled vehicles in situations where there is likely to be large amounts of 
rubble in the streets. Otherwise wheeled armored vehicles are faster and 
preferable. 
Tanks and infantry working as an integrated team may prove especially 
effective. The tank improves success in meeting engagements, countering 
ambushes, and in maintaining momentum during fire and maneuver. 
 
15.4.6 Fratricide 
 
Fratricide in all forms is a serious problem when fighting in cities because it is 
harder to identify friend from foe. By definition, the noncombatant civilians make 
up a substantial portion of the populace, probably the majority of it. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
750
 
15.4.7 Civilian Structures 
 
Major civilian structures in cities (e.g., hospitals, churches, banks, embassies) are 
located where they can be tactically useful, they can command key intersections, 
and/or are built of especially solid construction. Therefore, such facilities are 
particularly useful to urban defenders. 
 
15.4.8 Artillery 
 
Indirect fire artillery and antiaircraft artillery, as well as direct fire weapons, such 
as the tubes on tanks, can be useful in urban combat, provided there is little 
concern about collateral damage. Unfortunately, ―collateral damage‖ is a popular 
influential topic in PSYOPS, especially if noncombatants, and in particular, 
children, are involved. Newer GPS-guided artillery fire has proven to be a very 
effective capability in urban situations; the downside is the expense to acquire 
these shells. 
 
15.4.9 Electronic Warfare 
 
EW, on the other hand, while technically being an indirect fire weapon, does not 
directly cause collateral damage—permanent collateral damage anyway. Its effects 
are only felt directly while the jamming is taking place. The jamming, however, is 
usually intended to cause a target or targets to act differently in some way than 
they would if the jamming were not applied; so there is (hopefully) a lasting effect. 
It is not likely to impact on nontargeted entities, however. 
 
15.4.10 HUMINT 
 
Intelligence, especially from human sources, is absolutely critical to successful 
urban operations. This form of intelligence is referred to as HUMINT, and goes 
beyond simply talking to the indigenous population to gain knowledge. Everybody 
in the battlespace is a potential source of useful HUMINT, including soldiers on 
patrol and local children. 
 
15.4.11 Ambushes 
 
Hit-and-run ambushes by small groups are a favorite tactic of urban paramilitary 
forces. The local insurgents are likely to know the terrain better than coalition 
forces and can take advantage of that. 

Characteristics of Urban Terrain

15.4.12 Situational Awareness 
 
The restricted and compartmented nature of the urban battlespace makes it 
difficult to gain and maintain situational awareness. Even small unit leaders must 
learn to quickly recognize and utilize key terrain in the urban environment. They 
must learn how to determine which buildings or facilities will give them a tactical 
advantage. This includes such things as tall buildings for observation, command 
and control, and fields of fire. 
Situation assessment can be defined as the process of evaluating the current 
state of affairs within the decision maker’s area of interest (AOI). It includes the 
three levels or stages as depicted in Figure 15.8, which is a model of the situation 
assessment process as applied to dynamic decision making proposed by Endsley in 
1995 [7]. The first step to being aware in a situation is to perceive the 
environment—to make observations. The second step is to understand what is 
being observed (level 2). The last step is to project a short time into the future 
what is likely to happen. Based on this projection, a decision is made as to what 
action is appropriate and then that action is taken. The action likely changes the 
environment in some way, providing feedback to what is being observed. Then the 
process is repeated.  
Factors affecting this SA process are comprised of task or system factors that 
are outside of the person’s control, and individual factors. The elements of the 
former are the system capacity, the interface design through which the person 
interacts with the system, the stress and workload of the person making the 
assessment, the complexity of the system or task, and the amount of inherent 
automation. The elements of the latter include the goals and objectives of the 
 
Figure 15.8 Situation awareness model. (Source: [7]. © 1995.)

human in the situation and that person’s preconceptions or expectations. 
Contributing to the human factor implications are the long-term memory of the 
person, that person’s information processing ability, and the degree of automatic 
response that the person possesses (automaticity). These, in turn, are influenced by 
the person’s abilities, experience, and training. 
Although not specifically included in Figure 15.8, significant communication 
is implied in order to develop awareness of situations. Only in the simplest of 
cases is the flow shown in Figure 15.8 performed by a single person at a single 
location. With the complexity of combat, many people are involved in the process 
and they must communicate with one another. 
 
 
15.5 Typical Tactics of Urban Guerillas 
 
The urban insurgent works alone or in small cells, trying to avoid detection or 
identification. Being, for the most part, indistinguishable from the local populace, 
gathering in large groups would be an indication of something unusual happening. 
Somewhat to the contrary, urban insurgents also create incidents or amass crowds 
to lure the opposition force into a trap. 
Local industry and public services are disturbed by strikes and sabotage. 
Suicide bombers are frequently a cultural norm that attracts otherwise normal 
citizens, especially in Muslim-dominated countries. The bombers are convinced 
that to kill in such a way is a glorious and heavenly thing to do. Widespread 
disturbances that are designed to stress the resources of the opposing force are 
organized and executed. 
Opportunities for hostile propaganda arise by provoking the opposing force 
into overreacting. Such reactions can be viewed as overkill if not outright 
barbarous, especially when the civilian populace is involved in some way. It is 
perhaps worst, at least to western minds, when civilian children are included. In 
those cases where there are various factions in a country, especially when they are 
based on religion, such factions can be provoked into interfactional strife. 
Sniping 
has 
long 
been 
a 
mainstay 
tactic 
of 
military 
forces 
in a conflict. Urban terrain provides ample opportunities for applying these tactics. 
Witness the slaying of President Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 by Lee Harvey 
Oswald. There wasn’t even a conflict occurring in the United States at the time. 
Such sniping opportunities occur at roadblocks and outposts, as well as many other 
places (stop lights). 
Lowering public morale by planting explosive devices, either against specific 
targets or at random, is an effective technique. It causes confusion and destruction, 
resulting in the sense of no safe place to be.

15.6 Psychological Implications and Operations in 
Asymmetric Warfare 
 
In the post-Cold-War era, leaders of potential enemies of the United States and 
other western cultures have discovered that they can win the ―hearts and minds‖ of 
the world’s people through the selected use of real information, disinformation, 
manipulation of the press, propaganda, and other psychological warfare operations 
(PsyOps) methods. 
It is believed by some analysts that such PsyOps and propaganda programs 
will continue to have an increasingly more influential impact on future conflicts, 
and that our military and political leadership should seriously consider expanding 
efforts by U.S. psychological warfare operations and units to counter these 
developments. 
 
 
15.7 Concluding Remarks 
 
We have provided an overview of several of the characteristics of EW in urban 
terrain. The terrain itself was first discussed, followed by some of the peculiarities 
such terrain imposes on conducting EW operations.  
 
Modern warfare is being and will be conducted largely in urban settings. This 
is the nature of the state of affairs in the early twenty-first century. Largely 
because by far the most likely enemy western, developed militaries will encounter 
are guerillas aimed at asymmetric warfare and the best terrain for those kinds of 
endeavors is the urban setting. This is where their actions can receive the most 
attentions and therefore have the most asymmetric effect. 
 
Some types of modern war fighting targeted at urban settings need not even 
occur in that setting. The Internet is an example of this; so is broadcast and 
satellite TV. Significant military actions can be initiated well away from where the 
effects are intended.

Signal Propagation in Urban Settings 
 
 
16.1 Introduction 
 
We covered signal propagation characteristics in general in Chapter 2. This 
chapter is devoted to analyzing signal propagation in urban settings. While wars 
have been fought in city environments for as long as wars have been fought, the 
urban setting has become significantly more important in recent years. Such 
settings have some peculiar characteristics for EW operations and we will discuss 
some of them here. 
 
This chapter is structured as follows. First we review the properties of urban 
signal propagation, particularly with many buildings around. We then cover 
propagation characteristics for microcellular regions followed by an examination 
of the effects of vegetation. We then have a dialog about the prevailing 
propagation models specifically designed for urban environments. The chapter 
concludes with an exploration of the characteristics of indoor signal propagation. 
 
 
16.2 General Characteristics of Urban Signal 
Propagation 
 
The vast majority of urban propagation prediction research has been for the 
purpose of installing cellular and PCS wireless telephone systems. Therefore the 
characteristics of these systems drive the parameters chosen (such as frequency 
range considered). The modern cellular and PCS telephone systems worldwide 
have primarily two frequency bands: one in the 800–900 MHz range and one in 
the 1,800–1,900 MHz band. Some of the newer network systems (Wi-Fi and 
WiMAX) include the ISM frequency bands around 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz as well. 
Therefore the frequencies considered in the urban propagating analyses 
predominantly include these bands. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
756
 
The most prevalent analytical model for analysis of signal propagation in the 
VHF and higher ranges in suburban and rural environments is the two ray model. 
Egli also developed a model for propagation above 40 MHz [1]. That model is 
based on empirical data collected [1]. Longley and Rice also developed a VHF+ 
propagation model for use above 20 MHz based on empirical data [2]. 
 
The wavelengths at frequencies below about 100 MHz are large compared 
with the typical structure size in urban environments. Therefore neither the Egli 
nor the Longley-Rice model would apply. The two ray model may be applied to 
frequencies down to 20 MHz or so, but the validity of that model to urban 
environments has not been proven. Furthermore, there is little motivation for 
developing such a model since the predominant wireless communications in urban 
environments, as mentioned, are in the UHF and above range. 
 
Signals in the microwave band are common in urban areas, but those links are 
always point-to-point line of sight. Microwave signals do not propagate through 
buildings very well. Furthermore, such signals are normally used to exchange 
PSTN or similar signals, so the links can be carefully engineered and planned; 
they are not mobile. Two-ray modeling of the propagation paths can be applied in 
these cases. 
 
 
 
16.3 Urban Signal Propagation 
 
16.3.1 Introduction 
 
The understanding of mobile radio channel characteristics is essential for the 
analysis and design of EW systems that include third, fourth, and beyond 
generation wireless communication systems. Accurately modeling the radio 
channel, especially in urban environments, is very difficult to accomplish with any 
degree of fidelity. In the urban setting, the locations of the BS towers is likely to 
be well known, and EW planning to deal with these fixed sites is eminently 
possible. The MSs, on the other hand, are a different story. MSs can be anywhere 
within the communication system coverage area, which would likely contain many 
cells, especially in medium to large urban areas. Furthermore, it is likely that the 
MSs are the more interesting target, especially for geolocation and EA. 
Historically, by far the most used techniques for understanding propagation in 
urban terrain are the empirical models developed by Okumura [3], Hata [4], and 
COST-231[5] propagation models for elevated antennas. In the 1990s some 
analytical approaches to analysis of urban signal propagation emerged and are 
used along with the empirical models. The lower limit on the frequencies of these 
approaches are generally around 100 MHz or so while the upper limit is about 3 
GHz. They are therefore useful for analysis of other types of communication 
systems as well. 

Signal Propagation in Urban Settings 
757
Because the rows of buildings have the form of rectangular obstacles lying on 
the ground, as seen in the cross section in Figure 16.1, propagation over the 
rooftops involves diffraction past a series of parallel blocks with dimensions that 
are large compared to wavelength. At each block a portion of the field will diffract 
toward the ground. These fields can rejoin those above the buildings only after a 
series of multiple reflections and diffractions as suggested by the rays labeled 4 in 
Figure 16.1. 
 
Most of the diffractions are through large angles and/or the fields must be 
reflected two or more times between the buildings. Each diffraction and/or 
reflection induces losses in the energy of these waves; therefore, these fields will 
have small amplitude and can be neglected. Note that while fields reflected 
between two rows of buildings contribute to the multipath interference between 
those two rows, they do not contribute to multipath interference between any other 
two rows. 
 
16.3.2 Properties of Urban Signal Propagation 
 
16.3.2.1 Transmissions 
 
In urban networks, reflections off of objects such as buildings and the ground and 
transmission into buildings through doors or windows as well as walls play a 
primary role in the received signal strength. Diffraction and scattering are also 
important, but from experiments it has been shown that they play a secondary role 
in many cases. When the object that the signal is hitting is much larger than the 
wavelength, then the behavior of the signal can be modeled as a ray that is 
partially reflected off of the object and partially transmitted through the object, the 
magnitude of both depending on the relative dielectric constant of the material 
given by

as well as the angle of incidence hitting the wall. In addition, some of the signal 
energy is partially absorbed by the object. 
Consider the received signal strength on one side of a wall with a transmitter 
on the other side as shown in Figure 16.2. We consider the received signal strength 
in two locations, specifically, one at the same height as the transmitter and one 
elevated from the transmitter by 15 m. The elevated position causes the signal to 
approach the wall from a nonperpendicular angle. At these distances, the signal 
strength decays according to free-space propagation (r –2) and then intersects the 
wall and suffers insertion loss. The frequency considered is 2.4 GHz, as in 
802.11b/g. Three types of wall materials are examined as shown in Figure 16.2. 
First, as expected, the channel gain increases as the distance between the 
transmitter and receiver decreases when the receiver and transmitter are at the 
same height. This agrees with our intuition from free-space propagation. We can

see the impact of the material by noting the variation in the received signal 
strength for the different materials. For reference purposes, consider that without 
the wall, when the transmitter is about 5 m from the wall and a receiver that is at 
the same height as the transmitter, the channel gain is –14 dB. Thus, when the 
angle of incidence is 0o (directly horizontal in this case), the wall reduces the 
channel gain by 0 dB (for glass) to 6 dB (for concrete). The impact of the angle of 
incidence can be seen when the transmitter and receiver are not at the same height. 
As we can see, this results in the signal strength first increasing and then 
decreasing as the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases; this is in 
opposition to intuition and is caused by the angle of incidence increasing (as 
measured from the horizontal). The characteristic causing this counterintuitive 
behavior is that when the ray hits the wall at a grazing angle, only a small amount 
of signal power is transmitted through the wall. As we see, the point where the 
signal strength changes from increasing to decreasing depends on the material, and 
the thickness of that material. It also depends on the height of the receiver. 
Figure 16.2 shows variation of the channel gain due to the different building 
materials. While this simple experiment proves the point that different materials in 
walls have different effects on signals traversing through them, it is difficult to 
exactly analytically quantify this behavior since walls, especially exterior walls, 
are typically constructed with nonhomogeneous material. A second problem is that 
it is not realistic to know the construction material for each building being 
considered.  
 
16.3.2.2 Reflections off a Wall 
 
Reflections off a wall are the complementary effect to transmission through it. 
However, a significant amount of energy can be absorbed by the wall depending 
on the materials from which it is made and the angle of incidence as we observed 
in Figure 16.2. Therefore the power transmitted through a wall and the power 
reflected off of it do not necessarily sum to the power of the incident signal. 
Consider the urban canyon illustrated in Figure 16.3. In addition to the direct 
path between the transmitter and receiver, the signal is repeatedly reflected off of 
walls and, in a sense, focused down the street. A similar effect can also arise in 
hallways and tunnels. The result is that the received signal strength may be 
stronger when propagating down a street than it would be with the same 
transmitter-receiver distance in free-space. The phase of the signal is affected by 
the length of the path taken, and in some cases, the signal at the receiver can be 
completely cancelled when the reflected path length is such that the reflected 
signal arrives 180o out of phase with the direct path. 
Figure 16.3 shows the channel gain down an urban canyon for the same set of 
materials considered above as well as for the free-space approximation. Note that 
free-space analysis (d2) predicts substantially smaller received signal strength than 
the simulations indicates. For example, when the receiver-transmitter distance is 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
760
300 m, the difference between the free-space and the model that accounts for 
reflection ranges from 13 dB to 5 dB, depending on the material and the distance 
between the walls.  
We have also included approximations of the channel gain given by d–α, 
where, for a canyon width of 7 m, α = 1.38 and a canyon width of 35 m, α = 1.47. 
These approximations are very close to the characteristics for the brick wall case. 
In suburban and rural settings it is often assumed that α  {2, 4}. However, as this 
example demonstrates, it is possible that for some paths we have α < 2. That is, 
while 
buildings 
may 
block 
communication, 
they 
may 
also 
enhance 
communication. It is also possible to have  > 4 in some settings, for example 
inside building propagation. 
The smoothness of the walls also affects the reflection characteristics. This is 
due to the wide variation in the reflection coefficient as the angle of incidence 
varies. Depending on the material and the width of the material, there may be 
some angles of incidence where no signal is reflected at all. Such angles are called 
 
Figure 16.3 Propagation characteristics down an urban canyon. (Source: [7]. © Elsevier North 
Holland 2007. Reprinted with permission.) 

Signal Propagation in Urban Settings 
761
Brewster angles. In some settings, the wide variation of the reflected signals 
strength as a function of incident angle results in large fluctuations in the total 
received signal strength for small movements of the receiver or transmitter 
antenna. 
 
16.3.2.3 Fading 
 
Wireless signals can experience small-scale fading or multipath fading, which are 
especially pronounced in urban settings. Such fading results from the constructive 
and destructive interference of signals at the receiver that follow different paths 
from the transmitter to the receiver as mentioned above. As a result, because the 
wavelength is small, a small displacement of the transmitter or the receiver, or for 
that matter, any mobile object in the vicinity, will cause a change in the 
interference and hence a change in the received signal strength. 
Fast-fading is typically not relevant in wide bandwidth communications such 
as those often used for data communications (e.g., 802.11, 802.16), or the 3G+ 
PCS standards, however. This is because the received signal strength is essentially 
averaged over the bandwidth. Figure 16.4 illustrates a comparison of the 
fluctuations caused by fading in narrowband versus wideband systems. At some 
locations, the narrowband signal strength is quite low, even 40 dB less than the 
mean signal strength of 0 dB. A narrow bandwidth communication will experience 
such degradations in signal strength. However, when averaged over a sufficiently 
wide bandwidth, the average signal does not experience such severe degradation. 
The narrow bandwidth signal experiences rapid and large fluctuations, while the 
wide bandwidth case experiences much smaller variations. 
Figure 16.4 Characteristics of rapid fading for narrowband and wideband sources. (Source: [7]. ©

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
762
In general, the wider the bandwidth, the less susceptible to fast fading. 
However, variation in signal strength also depends on the environment. Figure 
16.5 shows the variance of the received signal strength over a circle with a one 
meter radius as a function of the bandwidth. Each curve is for a slightly different 
environment, but in all cases it is for propagating down the urban canyon as shown 
in Figure 16.3. In general, the variance decreases as the bandwidth increases; 
however, the variance of the narrow bandwidth case and the rate that the variation 
decreases with the bandwidth is environment dependent. In all cases, the variance 
is quite small when the bandwidth exceeds 10 MHz, while 802.11b has a 
bandwidth of 22 MHz. Keep in mind, however, that there are other factors besides 
multipath reflections that could cause large changes in signal strength over small 
changes in position, that is changes in antenna orientation and passing vehicles. 
 
16.3.2.4 Diffraction 
 
As mentioned, reflections play the most significant role in signal propagation in 
urban environments. Transmission through walls, windows, and so forth also play 
a major role. Even though diffraction plays a less important role in many cases, in 
other cases it can be a major contributor. When a signal is diffracted it ―bends‖ 
around a corner due to geometrical optical phenomenology to include the edges of 
buildings as well as the roof lines. The diffracted signal, however, is normally 
significantly weaker than the original signal; the sharper the bend, the weaker the 
signal.

Ikegami et al. documented an analysis coupled with experimental verification 
of the effects of propagation in urban environments [8]. They posited that there are 
two dominant rays impinging on an MS on the streets in an urban setting. These 
two rays consist of one that is diffracted by the last rooftop on the path between 
the BS and the MS and another that is reflected off the building behind the MS 
(see Figure 16.6). There could be other paths, but they assumed that all other paths 
could be ignored compared with the two dominant ones shown.

on the two ray assumption is

where E0 is the free space field strength, W, H, , and hr are defined in Figure 16.6 
expressed in m, degrees, and f is in MHz. Lr is the reflection loss given by the ratio 
of the amplitudes of the direct and reflected waves. 
It is important to note that in the experimental verification of the analytical 
results, both of these waves were diffracted as shown in Figure 16.6. Therefore the 
reflected wave would experience more loss than the direct wave. However, the 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
764
angle for path 1 is larger than for path 2 so the strength of the diffracted signal is 
lower. In addition, the frequencies examined were 209.75, 395.425, and 589.75 
MHz as opposed to the 802.11 frequency considered previously of 2.4 GHz. 
Consider the example in Figure 16.7, which shows the diffraction around a 
corner. The diffraction losses are shown in the graph compared with free space 
losses. As h increases, the receiver antenna moves further away from the corner 
and the losses increase. Figure 16.8 shows diffraction over a building where two 
diffractions are required. On both ends, as h increases, the signal must make a 
sharper bend (i.e., the diffraction angle increases) and, hence, more loss is 
incurred. It is important to notice how quickly the signal strength decreases as h 
increases. From Figure 16.8, we can see that diffracting over a building that is only 
5 m higher than the transmitter and receiver results in a channel gain that is too 
small for typical 802.11 communications. 
 
Figure 16.7 Diffraction at a corner of a building, top view. As h increases there are two effects: (1) h
is increasing thereby increasing the link distance and (2) the diffraction angle is increasing. (Source:

Signal Propagation in Urban Settings 
765
While diffracting around two or more corners leads to losses too large for 
802.11, it might be able to communicate effectively around a single corner. 
Consequently, in an urban area, especially in the urban core, a significant portion 
of the coverage area of 802.11 is due to diffraction.  
 
16.3.2.5 Scattering 
 
Scattering refers to the impact of smaller objects on the propagation (e.g., 
lampposts, trees, vehicles, people, and office furniture). Scattering also accounts 
for the unevenness of building walls (e.g., windows, doors, or façades). Scattering 
is particularly prevalent when the dimensions of the object off of which the signal 
reflects are on the order of a wavelength (12.5 cm at 2.4 GHz). Without detailed 
knowledge of the location and dimension of small objects and without details of 
building walls, it is difficult to accurately analyze the effects of these types of 
scatterers. The effects of scattering are normally handled by considering the 
contribution of scatterers stochastically.  
Scattering frequently occurs when a wireless signal propagates through 
vegetation (we discuss vegetation effects later). Indeed, if the vegetation is large 
and dense, the scattered signal dominates over the direct, nonscattered signal. 
Even when the vegetation is thin, as it usually is in urban areas, the vegetation can 
cause loss. At 2.4 GHz, vegetation causes a loss of approximately 0.2 dB per 
meter of vegetation. Diffraction over vegetation is also common. 
 
16.3.2.6 Time-Varying Channel Gain 
 
While the variability of channel gain is greatly affected by the movement of the 
transmitter or receiver, the channel gain can also change when the transmitter and 
receiver are fixed, but objects in the environment move such as passers-by, 
vehicles, and wind-blown vegetation and street signs. Figure 16.9 shows a typical 
gain variation as a function of time for a receiver and transmitter as observed 
along a sidewalk in a large city. 
 
16.3.2.7 Delay Spread 
 
As mentioned earlier, the wireless signal may follow several different paths from 
the transmitter to the receiver. While one impact of these multiple paths is that the 
signal may experience multipath fading, another result is that the multiple copies 
of the signal will be received at different points of time. Essentially, these multiple  

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
766
 
copies interfere with each other, causing destructive and constructive interference, 
as mentioned. When this self-interference is considered as noise, it is clear that the 
effective SNR is decreased by the presence of these delayed copies. When the 
receiver either at the BS or the MS employs rake receivers, these reflected signals 
actually increase the signal level so the traditional calculation of SNR considers 
delayed copies of the transmission as useful signal power. If the rake time delays 
are not properly estimated or if the rake fingers are not there at all, the traditional 
SNR is not a good indicator of BER performance. 
A channel where multiple copies of the signal arrive at different times is said 
to have delay spread. Two common measures of delay spread are the mean delay 
spread and the RMS delay spread (see [9] for definitions). With an RMS delay 
spread of above 60 ns, which is quite common in outdoor urban settings (signals 
travel at about the speed of light, which is approximately 1 ns per foot, so 60 ns 
corresponds to a propagation distance of approximately 60 ft), the impact of the 
delay can be quite severe. It has been found by measurements that indoors the 
RMS delay spread is typically less than 50 ns due predominantly to the short 
distances signals travel when reflected off a wall, but outdoors, it can exceed 500 
ns. Furthermore, the delay spread typically increases with the distance between the 
transmitter and receiver. Therefore, rooftop configurations, which are able to 
propagate considerable distances due to the lack of obstructions at higher heights, 
are likely to experience large delay spread values.

Measurements at frequencies of 35 MHz to 1,500 MHz have shown that building 
exterior walls have an attenuation of between 15 and 25 dB. These levels have a 
log normal distribution with a standard deviation of 8–14 dB. Measured loss

through the sides of buildings yield a loss of 3–7 dB through a double pane 
window and 20–30 dB through a concrete wall. 
 
 
 
16.4 Path Loss Predictions for Large Systems 
 
Macrocellular networks make use of high BS antennas to achieve coverage out to 
distances from the BS that are in the range from 1 to 20 km. For most cities, such 
distances lie outside the high-rise core, in regions where the buildings are of a 
more uniform height, and the propagation takes place past many rows of buildings 
(see Chapter 15). If we restrict the prediction to that of range dependence, we can 
use average descriptors of the buildings to get reasonable results. 
 
16.4.1 Path Loss 
 
Because the BS antenna is located well above the average building height in such 
a case, propagation must take place through the buildings, between them, or over 
the rooftops with the fields diffracted at the roof edges down to the street level. 
Propagation must primarily take place over the rooftops because signal 
propagating through the buildings are highly attenuated by losses due to reflection, 
diffraction, and scattering by exterior and interior walls and the signals cannot 
readily propagate through the gaps (see Figure 16.1 for notional propagation 
paths). 
 
To estimate the mean path loss in a macrocellular environment it is assumed 
that the rows of buildings are replaced by rectangular cylinders lying on the 
ground. All rows are assumed to have the same height, and each row of buildings 
is separated by the same distance d as shown in Figure 16.1. The distance d is the 
average of the separation from back-to-back across the yards and front-to-front 
across the streets. The mean sector average path loss L in decibels is given by the 
difference of the sector average received power to the radiated power for isotropic 
antennas both in decibels, and is given by [10]

The second term Lrts of (16.3) is referred to as the rooftop-to-street diffraction and 
scatter loss component. The third term Lmsd of (16.3) is the multiple-screen-
diffraction loss from the BS transmitter antenna to the rooftop of the last building 
before the mobile receiver. 
The rooftop-to-street diffraction and scatter loss Lrts was first postulated by 
Parson and then by Ikegami et al. [8]. Ikegami posited that many rays reach the 
MS from many different directions after encountering diffractions, reflections, and 
scattering effects around the receiver. However, close to the MS, propagation may 
be represented by two main rays. The first of these is diffracted from the rooftop 
of the building nearest the MS in the direction of the base station, while the second 
is reflected from the face of the building across the street (paths 1-2 and 1-5 in 
Figure 16.1). Further, the two main rays are roughly equal. Thus, the rooftop-to-
street diffraction and scatter loss, Lrts, can be written as

Signals undergo multiple diffractions as they traverse from the BS to the MS. 
The field incident on the top of each row of buildings is backward diffracted as 
well as forward diffracted. Fields that are backward diffracted do not contribute to 
the signal level at the MS and as a result are neglected. As a result, propagation is 
one of multiple forward diffraction and is represented by the multiple-screen-
diffraction loss

16.4.2 Vegetation Effects on Path Loss 
 
Torrico, Bertoni, and Lang [12] investigated the effects of tree vegetation on the 
propagation of UHF signals in urban environments. We briefly discuss their 
results in this section, indicating that vegetation should not be ignored in the UHF 
frequency range. 
In suburban environments, it is common to see rows of trees planted along the 
streets, often one in front of each house, and with the trees taller than the houses. 
 
Figure 16.10 Top view of the BS to MS path. 
 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
 
770
One possible arrangement of rows of trees next to rows of houses is depicted in 
Figure 16.11. Each row of houses or buildings is represented by an absorbing 
screen, while the canopy of the adjacent row of trees is represented by a partially 
absorbing phase screen. With this model, the field passing any row is equal to the 
field incident on the row multiplied by the transmission coefficient past the tree 
canopy. The phase and amplitude of the transmission coefficient are found from 
the width and physical properties of the canopy. Numerical evaluation of the 
physical optics integral was then used to find the field incident on the next screen. 
 
The attenuation and phase of the partially absorbing phase screen are found by 
taking the tree canopy to have an elliptical cross-section, with the semi-minor axis 
equal to a and the semi-major axis equal to b (see Figure 16.12). The center of the 
canopy is assumed to be at the same height as the buildings, so that the canopy 
extends a distance b above the buildings. Figure 16.13 shows the attenuation over 
and above the free space loss. The calculations assume d = 50 m, f = 900 MHz,     
θ = 90o, 89.5o (corresponding to α = 0, 0.5o), and tree width 2a = 4, 8 m for trees 
that are b = 4 m higher than the buildings. It is seen from the results that for α = 
0.5o, the field amplitude at the top of the buildings, with and without trees, 
increases to a settled value for N greater than about 15. 
 
However, for α = 0, the field amplitude continues to increase with increasing 
N. This behavior is similar to that found previously for buildings alone. After ten 
rows the wider trees are seen to have 4–5 dB more path loss than the buildings by 
themselves. 
 
16.4.3 Antenna Height Gain 
 
As noted previously, in macrocellular systems the BS antenna is typically well 
above the average building height. However, the glancing angle α shown in Figure 
16.1 is still small—typically less than 1.5o over most of a cell (if he = 10 m, then 
the distance corresponding to 1.5o is 380 m, fairly close to the BS antenna in a 
macrocellular system). Therefore Lmsd in (16.3) is not very sensitive to the 
 
 
Figure 16.11 Vegetation and how it can be modeled as phase and absorbing screens.

irregularities in the row spacing between buildings/houses, or the lack of 
parallelism between the rows. Thus, we can use the average distance between 
buildings/houses, back-to-back across the yard or front-to-front across the street 
for the rectangular cylinders that are representing the row of houses. Also because 
of the low glancing angle, , we can represent the rectangular cylinders as thin 
absorbing screens. 
 
A typical height gain characteristic is shown in Figure 16.14. In this case 
increasing the antenna height by a factor of 10 raises the amount of signal received 
by about 10 dB. 
 
16.4.4 Path Loss Predictions in the High-Rise Urban Core 
 
When one or both ends of the radio link are located in the high rise core, 
diffraction propagation will take place around the sides of tall buildings, as well as 
over the tops of lower buildings (see Figure 16.15), along with reflections (the 
main propagation mechanism) and scattering. If all of the buildings are much taller 
than the BS antenna, propagation takes place around the buildings through the 
―urban canyons‖ formed by the buildings (see Figure 16.16). In large cities, such 
as parts of Manhattan and Los Angeles, the tall buildings completely fill the 
blocks, which, for the most part, are arranged in a rectangular grid. For these 
regions it is possible to characterize the path loss without reference to the shapes 
of individual buildings because the individual effects tend to average out. 
However, in most urban cores, the buildings have a more random appearance 
when viewed over an area of 1 km2 or greater. Some of the buildings will be low, 
plazas and other open spaces break up the canyon walls, and the buildings, shape 
and orientation may not conform to a rectangular grid. In these environments 
accurate predictions of the path loss over some site require that the actual

building shapes be accounted for. Such site-specific predictions usually use optical 
ray tracing methods.  
In the urban core, the BS antenna may very well be below the height of the 
buildings as depicted in Figure 16.17. Diffraction will still occur at the corners of 
rooftops; however, it will also occur around the vertical edges of buildings causing 
propagation down the urban canyons (see Figure 16.16). Reflections, however, are 
still the predominant propagation mechanism in the urban core. 
 
 
16.5 Path Loss Prediction for Microcellular Systems 
 
Microcellular systems make use of BS antennas at about the height of the 
buildings or on lampposts to cover cells of radius 1 km or less. For such small 
cells, the street grid is more likely to be rectangular, and streets are a more 
significant fraction of the total area in a cell. Averages of the heights and spacing 
of buildings and vegetation can no longer be applied. In addition, the proximity of 
buildings to the BS must be taken into account. In low rise areas, the BS antenna 
may be slightly below the average building heights. In this case the proximity of 
the buildings may be accounted for through orientation, with respect to the street 
grid, of the propagation paths over the buildings. 
 
In microcellular systems the fading characteristics close to the BS vary 
considerably as illustrated in Figure 16.18. This is due primarily to the many 
reflective paths available when the MS is close to the BS, particularly the ground 
if nothing else. Moving the MS by a wavelength (cm) can completely cancel the 
signal at the MS. 
 
16.5.1 Line-of-Sight Propagation Along Streets 
 
On LOS paths in microcellular environments, measurements have shown that a 
simple two-ray model consisting of the direct and the ground-reflected ray 
commonly used in suburban and rural propagation studies are sufficient to predict 
the spatial average propagation loss. Measurements made at 900 MHz with 
vertically polarized antennas are in close agreement with the two-ray theory [12]. 
When the signal is plotted versus D on a logarithmic scale it is seen that distinctly 
different behaviors are obtained before and after a break point. Before the break

point, the radio signal oscillates severely due to destructive and constructive 
combination of the two rays at the receiver, while after the break point, it 
decreases more rapidly with distance with a typical loss exponent of 4 (i.e.,

16.5.2 Propagation over Buildings for Low Antennas 
 
A theoretical approach was developed to predict the path loss for propagation over 
buildings for low antennas in a microcellular environment where the antennas are 
above, at, or a little below the average building heights. Evaluation of the two 
dimensional diffraction process in the plane wave perpendicular to the rows of 
buildings for low BS antennas required the study of fields radiated by a source that 
was localized in the vertical plane, rather than an incident plane wave. Such a 
study was carried out for the special case when the horizontal separation between 
the BS and first row of buildings is d and is further discussed in [15] for the case 
when propagation is oblique to the street grid. 
 
The average path loss L in decibels is computed just as it was for the 
macrocellular case by using (16.3). The only difference lies in how the multiple 
screen diffraction term Lmsd of (16.8) is evaluated. The multiple screen diffraction 
due to propagation past M rows of buildings is computed based on the field 
reduction factor QM(gc). The dimensionless parameter gc is given by

16.6 MS to Base Propagation 
 
The astute reader will by this point recognize that we have been focused strictly on 
the path from the BS antenna to an MS. There are reasons for this. First of all, the 
propagation paths are bidirectional, at least to first order. We would expect that a 
path from an MS to the BS would exhibit similar characteristics as the path in the 
other direction. 
 
The second reason is that cellular and PCS systems utilize a technique of 
power control in the MSs. A BS controls the power emitted by an MS by adjusting 
the power dynamically at least several times a second (the exact number depends 
on the particular system being considered). If there is too much attenuation being 
experienced by the signal entering the base, the BS simply increases the MSs 
transmit power. Therefore the propagation loss is not such a major factor on the 
uplink. 
 
 
16.7 Propagation Models 
 
16.7.1 Introduction 
 
We should note that monopole antennas rely on an image that theoretically (and 
practically) extends into the Earth. For an elevated monopole antenna, that image 
is ―elevated‖ the same amount into the Earth. As such, the image of cellular BS 
antennas that are elevated on masts or are placed on top of multifloor buildings is a 
considerable distance into the ground. Therefore, in most cases, the MS is in the 
near field of the base station’s antenna. Therefore EM waves have a reactive 
component as does the base antenna impedance [16]. Part of the problem is the 
height of the base antennas. The entire height contributes to the antenna radiation 
pattern. The models that are generally used for urban propagation analysis do not 
explicitly take this reactive component into account. They are, however, all based 
on measurements, so this reactive component is taken into account. Such 
considerations complicate an accurate mathematical model.

16.7.2 Hata-Okumura Propagation Model 
 
16.7.2.1 Introduction 
 
 
The Hata-Okumura is the most widely used model in radio frequency propagation 
for predicting the behavior of cellular transmissions in built up areas. We 
summarize the Hata-Okumura model in this section. 
 
The Hata propagation model, based on field measurements reported by 
Okumura [3], is well established and widely used for urban propagation analyses 
in the UHF range up to 1.5 GHz. An extension of the model toward higher 
frequencies is found in COST-231 report, which is useable up to 3 GHz.  
The Hata-Okumura computation model was first described by Y. Okumura in 
1968 [3]. M. Hata simplified the model in 1980 [4], which led to the restriction 
that only regions with less than a 20 km distance to the transmitter can be 
predicted. 
As only four parameters are required, the computation time is very short. This 
is an advantage of this model. However, the model neglects the terrain profile 
between transmitter and receiver (i.e., hills or other obstacles between the 
transmitter and the receiver are not considered). Also phenomena like reflection 
and shadowing are not explicitly included. 
 
16.7.2.2 Parameters 
 
 The four parameters with their limits are: 
 
 
Frequency f (150 ... 1,500 MHz);  
 
Distance between transmitter and receiver D (1 ... 20 km);  
 
Antenna height of the transmitter hT (30 ... 200 m);  
 
Antenna height of the receiver hR (1 ... 10 m). 
 
16.7.2.3 Hata Model 
 
In the late 1960s, Yoshihisa Okumura conducted an extensive set of propagation 
measurements in the Tokyo metropolitan area. From these measurements he 
developed a set of curves giving the median attenuation relative to free space in an 
urban area. The computation model was first published by Okumura in 1968 [3]. 
Some of the Okumura data are shown in Figures 16.19–16.21. 
The 1980 model that Hata published as an extension to Okumura's model was 
suitable for computer applications [4]. The model computes the path loss as a 
function of transmit and receive antenna heights, path distance, radio frequency, 
and the type of clutter (urban, suburban, or rural). First, a basic equation is 
computed that is the loss in urban areas. Correction factors (given next) are 
applied  to  this  basic  equation  for  suburban  and  rural  areas. Common standard

deviations between Okumura-Hata predictions and measured path loss are 10–14 
dB. 
The model described here is applicable outside of the urban core of high-rise 
buildings. This is to say that the buildings are assumed to be relatively low rise 
and more or less uniform in height. 
This model is suited for both point-to-point and broadcast transmissions. It 
assumes that the base antenna is always above the height of any intervening 
buildings (see Figure 16.1). 
There are some legitimate urban targets of concern below the lower valid 
frequency of 150 MHz. Many contemporary potential adversaries that operate in 
urban terrain use VHF radios, for example. CB radios at just under 30 MHz are 
also popular. The characteristics exhibited by this model at 150 MHz provide at 
least a starting point for analysis.

 Thus the MS is always at ground level, in 
compliance with the requirement to be outside the urban core. 
As the height of the transmitter and the receiver is measured relative to the 
ground, an effective antenna height heff is additionally used and added to the 
antenna height of the transmitter; see Figure 16.1. This also improves the accuracy 
of the prediction. 
  
Suburban/Rural Areas 
 
This version of the Hata model is applicable to the transmissions just out of the 
cities and in rural areas where man-made structures are there but not so high and 
dense as in the cities. To be more precise, this model is suitable where buildings 
exist, but the MS does not have a significant variation of its height. This model is 
suited for both point-to-point and broadcast transmissions.

Expression (16.27) is compared with Okumura’s curves in Figure 16.22, which 
shows the excess loss over and above that for free space given in (16.5). The 
modified Hata model is seen to be within about 3 dB of the Okumura data points 
over the frequency range 100 to 3,000 MHz. Equation (16.26) applies for distances 
from 1 to 100 km, MS antenna heights of 1–10 m, and fixed-site antenna heights 
between 30 m and 1,000 m. 
 
16.7.4 Walfisch and Bertoni Model 
 
Walfisch and Bertoni put the urban propagation characteristics on a theoretical 
basis rather than empirical as the Hata-Okumura model is based [6]. They 
proposed a method based on numerical integration of the Kirchoff-Huygens 
integral [18] in optics to determine the fields diffracted past half-screens as 
illustrated in Figure 16.23. The field in the aperture of the first (n = 0) half-screen 
is used to compute the field in the aperture of the second screen, and so on. The 
incident plane wave was assumed to have unit amplitude magnetic intensity

polarized along the z-axis in Figure 16.23, and has implied time dependence 
exp(jt). The parameters are defined in Figure 16.23 and the UHF frequency 
range (300 MHz to 3 GHz) is considered.

A portion of the field diffracted by each row of buildings reaches street level 
where it can be detected by the MS. Diffraction down to the MS from the rooftops 
of neighboring buildings, paths 2 and 5, has previously been proposed as the final 
stage in the propagation process. In addition there is propagation through buildings 
as indicated by path 3 that reach the MS at ground level. 
 
With all these possible paths from the BS to the MS, it is still believed that the 
majority of the energy from the transmitting BS arrives at the MS from 
diffractions and reflections from the structures in the close vicinity of the MS. As 
mentioned, it is widely believed that there are two dominant waves impinging on 
an MS at ground level in urban settings: the one diffracted directly down to the 
MS from the last rooftop prior to the MS’s location and one reflected off the 
building behind the MS. All other wavefronts are inconsequential relative to these 
two.  
 
16.7.5 Path Loss in Street Microcells—Two-Slope Model 
 
For ranges less than 500 m and antenna height less than 20 m, some empirical 
measurements have shown that the received signal strength for LOS propagation 
along city streets can be accurately described by the two-slope model [20]

It depends on frequency, with the breakpoint at 1.9 GHz being about twice that for

16.8 Indoor Propagation 
 
It is often said that an army should avoid urban terrain due to its difficulties—
especially indoors. Yet a good deal of the time modern armies conduct operations 
in urban terrain; it has become unavoidable with the types of adversaries currently 
engaged and anticipated. In particular, large cities are becoming more of the 
twenty-first century battleground than open spaces. As such it is prudent to 
examine the propagation conditions that exist within buildings as well as into and 
out of buildings, to the extent that it is different from regular outdoor propagation. 
The European COST 231 research project developed a model for indoor 
office propagation. The excess attenuation (in dB) grows linearly with the number 
of walls traversed while the effect of floors is nonlinear. The model for path loss 
for 800–1,900 MHz is [22]

The sum of terms in (16.34) on the right side excluding the first, called the excess 
loss, L, is plotted in Figure 16.26 for a few values of the parameters. We see that 
for N > 1 or 2, and even minimal walls, the signals suffer considerable attenuation 
inside buildings going from floor to floor. 
 
 
16.9 Concluding Remarks 
 
We discussed the major characteristics of EM wave propagation in urban settings 
in this chapter. Modeling such propagation is considerably more difficult than in 
open environments where there are not as many obstructions. 
 
It can be concluded, as indicated in the discussion, that the most significant 
properties affecting UHF signals in cities are the reflections off buildings and the 
propagation into and out of buildings, including the absorption properties of the 
 
Figure 16.26 Indoor propagation excess path loss (over and above free space path loss). f = 800–
1,900 MHz.

materials in walls as well as its relative dielectric constant. Diffraction and 
scattering are important parameters as well, but less so than the first two. As 
indicated, delay spread causing ISI is a consideration in urban signaling but with 
the rake receiver and related technologies this should not play a significant role in 
the future. 
 
The models discussed are the most popular for modeling urban propagation. 
The Hata formulas are based on the measurements of Okumura in Tokyo and are 
believed to be the most accurate and representative characteristics available. The 
Walfisch model is not based on collected data but is analytically derived from 
optical principles; it also is thought to be the most accurate analytical model 
available.

Chapter 17 
 
 
Urban Electronic Warfare 
 
 
17.1 Introduction 
 
We have discussed the general characteristics of urban signal propagation in 
Chapter 16, and the predominant sources of noise generated in an urban 
environment in Chapter 2. Thus having set the properties of communications 
expected in urban settings, in this chapter we focus our attention on some of the 
specific issues associated with conducting EW operations targeting these 
communications in urban settings. 
 
EW in urban settings with the few exceptions discussed in this chapter is just 
like EW in rural settings. The goal of EA to deny the exchange of information 
between a target transmitter and receiver by injecting noise or some other signal 
into the target receiver that overwhelms the target signal and disallows the 
exchange of information. The primary goal of ES is to provide targeting level data 
to the EW systems so that the correct links can be targeted. A secondary goal of 
ES is to garner combat information for situation assessment and subsequent 
decision making (to the extent that this is different from the primary goal). 
This chapter is structured as follows. We first examine some extracts from 
Army FM 03-03, Urban Operations, which provide some insight as to what the 
U.S. Army believes is the principal use of EW for urban warfare. That is followed 
by a discussion of the (more or less) unique challenges in urban EW. We conclude 
the chapter with a description and conclusions derived from a computer 
operational simulation of some EW architectures and their tradeoffs for urban EW. 
 
17.2 Electronic Warfare  
 
Army FM 3-06, Urban Operations, describes the U.S. Army’s doctrine on urban 
operations [1]. Included in that doctrine is consideration  of EW. EW is defined in 
paragraph 5-70 as: 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
792
  
Electronic warfare (EW) includes all actions that use 
electromagnetic or directed energy weapons to control the 
electromagnetic spectrum or to attack a threat. Conducting EW 
in urban areas seeks to achieve much the same results as in other 
environments. A major consideration in urban areas is collateral 
effects on portions of the urban infrastructure that rely on the 
electromagnetic spectrum for service. Thus, precision is a major 
factor in planning for EW operations. For example, EW 
attacking a threat’s television broadcasts avoids affecting the 
television broadcasts of neutral or friendly television. Likewise, 
EW attacking military communications in a large urban area 
avoids adversely affecting the area’s police and other emergency 
service communications. Urban offensive and defensive 
operations will have the least restrictions on EW operations 
while urban stability may have significant constraints on using 
EW capabilities.  
 
FM 03-06 considers computer network operation (CNO) as being particularly 
important in urban warfare. In paragraphs 5-71–5-74, CNO is presented as 
follows: 
 
Computer Network Operations  
 
CNO include computer network attack (CNA), computer 
network defense (CND), and computer network exploitation 
(CNE). CNO are not applicable to units at corps and below. 
Echelons above corps (EAC) units will conduct CNA and CNE. 
If tactical units require either of these network supports, they 
will request it of EAC units.  
 
Computer Network Attack 
  
Considerations regarding the execution of CNA in urban 
operations (UOs) are similar to those of EW: CNAs that do not 
discriminate can disrupt vital civilian systems. However, 
possible adverse effects on the civilian infrastructure can be 
much larger—potentially on a global scale. In the short term, 
CNAs may serve to enhance immediate combat operations but 
have a debilitating effect on the efficiency of follow-on urban 
stability operations. Because of these far-reaching effects, 
tactical units do not execute CNA. CNA is requested of EAC 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
793
units. EAC units will receive all requests from lower echelons, 
carefully consider second- and third-order effects of CNA, and 
work to ensure its precise application. 
 
Computer Network Defense  
 
In urban operations, CND will require extreme measures to 
protect and defend the computers and networks from disruption, 
denial, degradation, or destruction. The nature of the urban 
environment and configuration of computer networks provides 
the threat with many opportunities to interdict local area 
networks (LANs) unless monitored by military forces. LANs 
controlled by military forces are normally more secure than the 
civilian 
infrastructure. 
Commanders 
should 
prepare 
for 
opportunities by the threat to insert misinformation. 
  
Computer Network Exploitation 
  
CNE consists of enabling operations and intelligence collection 
to gather data from target or adversary automated INFOSYS or 
networks. Tactical units do not have the capability for CNE. 
CNE contributes to intelligence collection at EAC. In urban 
operations (UO), CNE will be centrally controlled. 
 
 
17.3 Electronic Isolation 
 
FM 3-06 explains the main purpose of EW in urban environments is to provide 
electronic isolation [2]: 
 
 
Electronic isolation is achieved through offensive information 
operations (IO). Electronic warfare (particularly two of its 
components: electronic warfare support and electronic attack) 
and computer network attack are critical to electronic isolation 
… At the operational level, offensive IO aims to quickly and 
effectively control the information flow into and out of an urban 
area. This isolation separates the threat's command and control 
(C2) system in the urban area from its operational and strategic 
leadership outside the urban area. Offensive IO also focuses on 
preventing the threat from communicating with civilians through 
television, radio, telephone, and computer systems. At the 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
794
tactical level, IO aim to isolate the threat’s combat capability 
from its C2 and leadership within the urban area, thus preventing 
unity of effort within that area. Defensive IO can prevent 
isolation of friendly forces defending in an urban area. 
 
There are three types of isolation defined in the same document as [3] 
 
Isolation of an urban environment is often the most critical 
component of shaping operations. Commanders who’s [sic] AO 
includes operationally significant urban areas often conduct 
many shaping operations to isolate, or prevent isolation of, those 
areas from other parts of the AO. Likewise, commanders 
operating in the urban area focus on isolating decisive points and 
objectives in the urban area or averting isolation of points that 
are critical to maintaining their own freedom of action. Isolation 
is usually the key shaping action that affects UO [urban 
operations]. It applies across full spectrum operations. Most 
successful UO have effectively isolated the urban area. Failure 
to do so often contributed to difficult or failed UO. In fact, the 
relationship between successful isolation and successful UO is 
so great that the threat often opposes external isolation actions 
more strongly than operations executed in the urban area (or 
critical areas within). In some situations, the success of isolation 
efforts has been decisive. This occurs when the isolation of the 
urban area compels a defending enemy to withdraw or to 
surrender before beginning or completing decisive operations. In 
UO that are opposed, Army forces attempt to isolate the threat 
three ways: physically, electronically, and, as a resultant 
combination of these first two, psychologically [see Figure 
17.1]. 
There are many different types of communication systems in most, if not all, 
major urban areas. Isolating an adversarial group from communicating with sister 
forces means cutting off all these lines of communication. CNO will certainly be a 
factor in order to accomplish this—if nothing more than taking a server out by 
flooding. Mobile, wireless connectivity through Wi-Fi or WiMax must be denied 
or significantly degraded in addition to the normal methodologies thought of when 
considering EW. The ability to exchange data and information over cellular 
phones and PCS systems implies the necessity of EW against wireless phone 
systems.

17.4 Networked Communications 
 
Just as many of the world’s developed militaries are making use of the latest in 
communication technology to effectively use networking as a force multiplier, 
opposing urban forces have also learned to make use of the benefits of network 
centric/enabled communications, using modern technologies such as wireless 
phones, cellular networks, and the Internet. The significant advantage is that their 
communications merge with normal commercial traffic as the guerillas try to 
evade EW monitoring [4]. 
 
 
17.5 Improvised Explosive Devices Countermeasures 
 
Remote activation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) is another capability of 
commercial communications used by urban guerillas. Wireless phones, remote 
control equipment, and infrared remote controls are some of the activation devices 
that have been used by insurgents in the Middle East for the past few decades. 
Military forces are countering this threat with a wide range of countermeasures, 
constantly improved to attempt to stay ahead of evolving threats. Consequently, 
unlike the more common IW operations, where jammers are employed by EW 
units, urban combat (UC) requires the use of IED jammers by every combat 
vehicle, EOD team, and even by dismounted patrols. This trend has led to the 
development of reliable, effective, ―switch on and forget‖ jammers that can

effectively combat remote triggering of IEDs without degradation of the vehicle’s 
or individual's communications system.  
 
This capability does not come without problems, however. For example, it 
would be desirable to not have the IED jammer on all the time to allow legitimate 
cellular traffic to transpire. Rather, a signal initiated jamming (SIJ) capability 
would be desired. Unfortunately, once one of these jammers ―triggers‖ on a 
suspected signal, it could trigger other jammers instead, and so on. Before long, all 
or a large number of the jammers are triggered. 
 
 
17.6 Challenges of Urban EW 
 
In addition to, or in lieu of, traditional military tactical push-to-talk radios, 
typically in the VHF frequency range, an urban RF environment consists of a 
plethora of ―nonstandard‖ radio systems. The RF environment in an urban setting 
is expanding at an explosive rate in major cities around the world due primarily to 
PCS and cellular phone systems as well as mobile Internet services these phones 
provide. 
 
Even though the tenents of EW are basically the same in an urban 
environment as they are anyplace else, there are some particular issues with urban 
terrain that should be discussed. We will cover some of them in this section. 
 
17.6.1 Multipath 
 
 
 
 
In an urban battlespace, signal propagation occurs primarily by the signals taking 
many paths to get from the transmitter to the receiver. In many cases this is caused 
by diffraction at the top edge of the building closest to the MT in the direction to 
the transmitter and reflection off the structure on the other side of the road from 
that building. This causes two signals to arrive at the MT; however, there is a high 
likelihood that there are many more. They are just weaker than the two mentioned. 
 
Moving structures such as vehicles or traffic signs blowing in the wind cause 
these multiple paths to have a nonstationary character. This causes time-variable 
fading whether the target or EW system is moving or not. The difficulty this 
presents to an EW system is that most of the existing engineering and physical 
theory of signal detection, processing, and throughput assumes stationary noise. If 
this isn’t the case then the EW system will likely have degraded performance. 
 
 
 
 
17.6.2 Lack of Direct Wave Signal Component 
 
Except in rare circumstances, there is no direct signal path from the target 
transmitter to the intercept receiver or from the EA transmitter to the target 
receiver. As discussed in Chapter 16, almost all signals are reflected or diffracted 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
797
in an urban environment, especially in the urban core. That makes accurate 
geopositioning of the transmitter essentially impossible. 
 
It also imposes a different PDF for the amplitude of the intercepted signal. 
With a direct wave component, the PDF of the amplitude of the intercepted EM 
wave takes on a Ricean fading distribution whereas for a signal with no direct 
wave component the amplitude PDF has a Rayleigh fading characteristic. The 
important significance of this is that the received signal, being composed of the 
sum of several multipath components, will suffer significant time-varying fading. 
This makes reliable interception problematic. It also makes it difficult to reliably 
deliver the jamming waveform to the receiver. 
 
17.6.3 3D Battlespace 
 
Signals can emerge from any direction, including down from the top. Many EW 
systems utilize dipole or monopole antennas that have theoretical nulls overhead 
or directly underneath. In theory, signals arriving from these directions will not be 
detected. In reality, some of the signal will arrive not directly from these 
directions, but they could still be significantly suppressed. 
 
FM 03-06 
 
Urban areas present an extraordinary blend of horizontal, vertical, 
interior, exterior, and subterranean forms superimposed on the natural 
relief, drainage, and vegetation. An urban area may appear dwarfed on a 
map by the surrounding countryside. In fact, the size and extent of the 
urban area of operations is many times that of a similarly sized portion 
of undeveloped natural terrain. A multi-storied building may take up the 
same surface area as a small field, but each story or floor contains 
approximately an equal area as the ground upon which it sits. In effect, 
a ten-story building can have eleven times more defensible area than 
―bare‖ ground—ten floors and the roof. It is the sheer volume and 
density created by this urban geometry that makes UO resource 
intensive in time, manpower, and materiel.  
This means that 11 times the firepower can occupy the same patch of ground. 
 
17.6.4 Cover and Concealment 
 
In an urban setting there is a plethora of cover and concealment, especially for 
dismounted infantry. Rooftops and windows provide good firing positions. 
Especially when elevated (e.g., rooftops), extended communication paths can be 
established where an EW system at ground level would not be within the line of 
sight of the receiver. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
798
 
Movement in urban settings can readily be concealed as forces move from one 
structure to another. When so doing, they may be exposed only for a brief time 
before reaching their destination. As mentioned, subterranean pathways may form 
the ultimate in concealment, letting movements be completely covered. 
 
17.6.5 Noncombatant Population 
 
The noncombatants in an urban setting are likely to be the largest segment present 
and often determining friend from foe is difficult at best. With the proliferation of 
commercial communication technology, at the time of this writing, half of the 
world’s population possess and use cellular phone technology. 
 
17.6.6 Cochannel 
 
The increasing use of cellular and personal communication networks in urban 
settings produces increasing levels of cochannel interference. This is because these 
systems reuse frequencies in different cells. This frequency reuse causes signals to 
interfere with one another at an EW system, making it difficult to separate one 
signal from another. Elevated EW systems have better range, but with frequency 
reuse an elevated platform sees multiple cells with the same frequencies in use. 
Elevated stand-off platforms have this problem more than stand-in EW systems or 
ground-based EW systems. 
 
17.6.7 Elevated Antennas 
 
Antennas are easier to elevate in an urban area than in a rural areas due to tall 
buildings. This increases an EW system’s range because there are fewer 
opportunities for signal blockage. 
 
This however, could work to a disadvantage. It was already mentioned that 
the cellular frequencies are reused—usually in cells a few cells distant. Elevating 
the EW antenna makes it easier for these distant cells to interfere with the cell of 
interest. 
This problem is not unique to cellular/PCS systems. Several (all) of the signals 
expected in urban environments have limited frequencies over which they can 
operate (except for those in the ISM band, but even there the communicators must 
remain within the band—they just don’t require a license). All of those systems 
reuse the available frequencies so they all can potentially cause interference, both 
to the EW intercept system as well as each other. 
 
17.6.8 Nontraditional Emitters 
 
There are many nontraditional sources of RF signals in urban settings. These 
include, but are not limited to: 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
799
 
RC toys; 
 
Walkie-talkies, both professional and toys; 
 
Garage door openers; 
 
CB radios; 
 
Paging systems; 
 
Ham radios; 
 
Licensed and unlicensed private radio systems; 
 
Licensed business radio systems (e.g. taxis); 
 
Remote-controlled devices; 
o 
Lamps; 
o 
Fans; 
o 
TVs; 
o 
Stereos. 
 
Most of these RF sources simply raise the noise floor, thereby lowering the SNR at 
the intercept receivers. In general, these signals must limit their power and many 
can operate only in the ISM bands (see Chapter 2). Even though a signal is 
delegated to the ISM bands does not mean that there is no spillover to other 
regions of the frequency band, however. With enough such signals in the RF 
environment there is a point where the SNR gets too bad for effective EW and, in 
particular, ES operations.  
 
17.6.9 Encryption 
 
Most nonmilitary communications are not encrypted, although there are 
exceptions. Therefore detection of encrypted communications immediately 
indicates a probable SOI. 
 
17.6.10 EW Fratricide 
 
Recall that SIJ is when the jammer’s intercept receiver detects an SOI and 
subsequently initiates jamming on that target. This same situation can occur when 
the intercept receiver of a second jammer detects the jamming signal of the first 
EW system, and initiates jamming. This scenario could escalate until, in the limit, 
all jammers in a region are trying to jam each other. This is called EW fratricide. 
 
17.6.11 Power and HVAC 
 
In rural settings, the military typically must bring its power sources with it in the 
form of fossil-fueled generators. On the other hand, power is readily available in 
urban settings as is HVAC. In most (all?) large cities, power from the power grid 
is plentiful and readily available (unless removed). 
 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
800
17.6.12 Satellite Navigation Denied Areas 
 
Satellite navigation devices do not work well in covered areas. Thus inside 
buildings and underground, navigation must be provided by more traditional 
means such as maps. Maps may very well be available for such man-made 
structures such as hotels and subway systems. They would not generally be 
available for such infrastructure as sewer tunnels. That would provide an 
advantage for indigenous urban guerillas more familiar with the environment. 
 
Denial of satellite navigation in outdoor environments would have to be 
provided by EW resources. 
 
17.6.13 Urban Impulsive Noise 
 
We examined urban RF IN at length in Chapter 2. Due to its ubiquity in urban 
environments, however, it is worth mentioning again. It is perhaps the largest 
challenge to overcome when conducting EW operations in urban terrain. 
 
17.6.14 Gathering Intelligence 
 
FM 03-06 explains that intelligence collection in urban warfare is different from 
that for open, more traditional combat operations: 
 
A complex intelligence environment requiring lower-echelon 
units to collect and forward essential information to higher 
echelons for rapid synthesis into timely and useable intelligence 
for all levels of command. Understanding the multifaceted urban 
environment necessitates a bottom-fed approach to developing 
intelligence (instead of a top-fed approach more common and 
efficient for open terrain and conventional threats). It also 
emphasizes the need for intelligence reach and a truly 
collaborative approach to the development and sharing of 
intelligence. 
  
17.6.15 Friendly C2 Communications 
 
Just as the terrain in an urban setting can affect the ability of an intercept receiver 
to receive a target signal with a good SNR, those same terrain effects have an 
impact on friendly forces to communicate with one another, and for the same 
reasons. VHF and UHF communications in an urban core can be virtually non-
existent. That is why there are so many cellular towers in such settings.

17.7 Urban Electronic Warfare Operational Simulation 
 
17.7.1 Introduction 
 
An operational computer simulation experiment of urban EW was conducted to 
examine a few EW architectures to support networked ground-component forces. 
The three specific cases examined were: 
 
 
A set of distributed thin jammers; 
 
One and two thick jammers; 
 
One UAS mounted thin jammer. 
 
Thin and thick jammers get their name from computer networking jargon. Thin 
jammers have little indigenous capability for ES. They are basically relegated to 
signal detection, thus identifying energy with frequency. A thick jammer, on the 
other hand, has sufficient ES capability (usually associated with the presence of an 
EW operator) to make independent decisions as to the importance of a detected 
target. 
In addition to these, simulations were executed for the baseline where there 
was no jamming and when jamming was complete—no communications were 
allowed to transpire. These two cases form the worst case and best case limits of 
jamming effectiveness. 
ES was not modeled for the study principally because the model used does not 
include the capability for ES. Thus it was assumed that the locations of the targets 
were known and the closest jammer to a target was tasked with jamming that 
target. This in effect removed the ES portion of the problem and concentrated the 
results strictly on the EA aspect. ES was modeled in a separate effort [5] (see also 
Chapter 4). 
 
17.7.2 EW Methodology 
 
The methodology used to model the effects of jamming are summarized in the 
following equations:

(17.3) 
 
Using the following logic determined whether the jamming was successful or not: 
 
IF SJR(dB) < THRESHOLD -> COMMO JAMMED 
ELSE  -> COMMO SUCCESSFUL 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
802
 
The attenuation losses in (17.1)–(17.3) are calculated using the Hata-Okumura 
models. Further logic to ascertain jamming success was based on Figure 17.2. If 
the target receiver was within the jammer’s antenna pattern, as illustrated by the 
lines emanating from the jammer in Figure 17.2, (17.1)–(17.3) are calculated to 
determine if the message was received. 
 
17.7.3 Modeling EW Limitations 
 
The EW capability had some limitations. In particular: 
 
 
Only EA is modeled; ES and EP were not implemented. Therefore 
modeling accurate follower jamming is not possible. This results in the 
lack of ability to explicitly play frequency hopping and the effects of 
propagation effects due to frequency, multipath fading, and so forth were 
not examined. 
 
The jammer only operates on one frequency, not a bandwidth of 
frequencies. 
 
17.7.4 Key Assumptions 
 
The principal assumptions made in the modeling process were: 
 
 
Figure 17.2 Jammer model used in the simulation. 
 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
803
 
Blue maneuver and communications were precoordinated, minimizing 
negative effects of jamming fratricide. 
 
Jammer is reactive; it only activates when it receives threat 
communications and turns off when communications have ceased. 
 
Red was unaware of blue jamming resulting in red tactics not changing 
due to jamming. 
 
17.7.5 Urban Scenario 
 
17.7.5.1 Urban Scenario Overview 
 
The urban scenario included portions of a U.S. Army Future Combat System 
(FCS) Combined Armored Battalion CAB(–) with a supporting Non-Line of Sight 
(NLOS) Battalion Bn(–) conducting operations in urban terrain in support of a 
Joint Task Force (JTF) conducting operations to restore a legitimate government 
(see Figure 17.3.) 
In the scenario the urban terrain is restrictive and complex with minimal LOS. 
Both mounted and dismounted blue assaults were conducted. The ground 
movements were augmented with joint air support available for precision strikes. 
 
Figure 17.3 Urban scenario. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
804
Artillery/NLOS-LS assets provided on-call support. Threat CO(+) consisting of 
mixed conventional and unconventional forces attempts to defend the government 
seat of power using adaptive/evasive urban tactics and the red forces reacted 
dynamically to blue’s advancement. They made good use of coverage provided by 
urban terrain. There was extensive IED placement. However they had limited 
ADA and mortar support and no artillery or air support. Red forces used buildings 
to their advantage by using ―pop-up‖ tactics from windows and roofs.  
Red forces relied on barriers and IEDs to slow/prevent blue maneuvers causing 
blue to stop at barriers and remove the obstacles, making them vulnerable. There 
were two types of IED’s in play: 
 
 
Typical roadside IED, aimed at destroying passing vehicles (5 of 7 IEDs 
were of this type); 
 
IEDs/bombs placed deliberately near barriers where blue infantry would 
be vulnerable. These were aimed at inflicting damage to blue infantry 
forces. (Two IEDs near barriers were of this type.) 
 
17.7.6 Role of Electronic Warfare in the Urban Scenario 
 
EW was used in the scenario for three primary purposes: 
 
 
Counter red IED remote triggering (7 in scenario); 
 
Prevent red forces from calling for support from southern units; 
 
General disruption of red C2 and coordination/synchronization. 
 
17.7.7 Cases Examined 
 
17.7.7.1 Thick Jammer Architecture 
The thick jammer used in the cases examined consists of EW (ES and EA) 
equipment mounted on a small vehicle, such as the HMMWV shown in Figure 
17.4. Such a configuration could house up to two operators, but only one jammer 
was used in the modeling. The transmitter emitted 27 dBW (500 W) and the 
omnidirectional antenna was mounted atop a 5 m mast. It was assumed that 
jamming was the sole mission of the vehicle. There was one jammer per CAB(–) 
included. The jamming vehicle travels behind main combat force and it must stop 
to provide jamming support. 
 
17.7.7.2 Thin Jammer Architecture 
 
Two versions of the thin jammer were simulated: (1) a jammer mounted in all of 
the FCS RSTA vehicles in the CAB(–) for which there were five in the simulation 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
805
(see Figure 17.5), and (2) a jammer mounted in the Fire Scout UAS (see Figure 
17.6). In both cases the thin jammer emitted 20 dBW (100 W). 
In the ground configuration the omnidirectional antenna was mounted atop a 
3m mast. In addition, jamming was not the sole, or even the principal, mission of 
the vehicles. The vehicles maneuvered ahead of the main combat force and the 
jammers were active while maneuvering. 
There was one thin UAS jammer in the CAB(–). The UAS maneuvered in a 
continual racetrack above the city. Because of the flight pattern of the UAS, 
jamming was the sole mission of UAS (the UAS was not retasked to provide 
coverage of other space than that required for the jamming racetrack. The jammer 
was active while maneuvering.

17.7.8 Base Case Results 
 
17.7.8.1 Loss-Exchange Ratio 
 
The base case LER performance is shown in Figure 17.7. Overall blue force 
performance is increased with effective jamming present. The ground thin case 
was close to providing the same benefit as the unrealistic ―optimal‖ case. The 
reasons for this are: 
 
 
The jamming platforms remain near blue forces, protecting them from 
immediate effects of IEDs. 
 
The platforms were able to jam while moving, preventing any lapse in 
protection. 
 
Figure 17.6 Helicopter UAS thin jammer configuration. 
Figure 17.7 Loss exchange ratio (LER) for the base case. 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
807
The UAS case does not perform as well due to tall buildings affecting jammer 
coverage 
 
17.7.8.2 Losses 
 
The red losses remained relatively constant as indicated in Figure 17.8. Jamming 
was able to significantly reduce IED detonations, decreasing blue losses due to 
IEDs: 
 
 
92% of IEDs detonated in baseline; 
 
56% of IEDs detonated in thin case; 
 
69% of IEDs detonated in UAS case; 
 
23% of IEDs detonated in optimal case. 
 
In contrast, the thick jamming architecture did not perform well. This is primarily 
due to the fact that the small blue force had only one thick jammer in the scenario. 
Furthermore there were lapses in coverage when the jammer must maneuver to its 
next position. 
In complex urban environments, the thin architecture provides the best 
jamming coverage due to its proximity to blue forces and wide distribution across 
the battlefield. 
 
17.7.8.3 Jammer Effectiveness over Time 
 
Thick Jammer Performance 
 
The performance versus time for the thick jammer in the urban scenario is shown 
in Figure 17.9. The thick jammer is effective when it is on but needs to shut-off 
while maneuvering, which allows the threat to eventually succeed with 
communications. 
 
Figure 17.8 Losses base case. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
808
 
Thin Jammer Performance 
 
The ground thin jammer performance over time is shown in Figure 17.10. The 
jamming platforms are relatively close to the threat so the weaker power of the 
thin jammer is adequate. The relatively wide distribution of jammers also provides 
more widespread disruption of threat communication than a single source. In 
addition, these jammers could remain operational while maneuvering as opposed 
to the thick jammer assumption that it could not. 
 
UAS Thin Jammer Performance 
 
These results are shown in Figure 17.11. Due to the complex terrain, consisting 
mostly of (relatively) tall buildings, the UAS performance was not very good— 
 
Figure 17.10 Thin jammer performance versus time. 
 
Figure 17.9 Thick jammer performance versus time. The solid line is the percentage of the threat 
forces that are connected, the dashed line is when the jammer is on, and the dotted line corresponds to 
the percentage of jammers lost. 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
809
especially in the latter stages of the engagement. Throughout the scenario the 
buildings prevented adequate signal strength from reaching the receiver in the 
UAS, preventing signal detection, and therefore missing the jamming opportunity. 
 
17.7.9 Conclusions 
 
The scenario represents a small-scale engagement in an urban environment with 
few players and a heavy IED presence. Red threat communications travel a 
relatively small distance. The maximum range of a jamming system is not as 
crucial as urban penetration. The amount of threat C2 communication/coordination 
is much less than in a large-scale scenario. 
A jammer must be in a position to intercept the threat if ―reactive‖ jamming (as 
opposed to barrage jamming) is used. The jamming platforms must be widely 
distributed and maneuver with forces to provide constant coverage. 
The majority of the key threat players (IEDs, units calling for reinforcement, 
and so forth) positioned close to the advancing blue force. If jammers are 
sufficiently distributed among the blue force, the jamming systems only need to 
influence small local areas, which means that low power is required. 
The urban environment is very complex with many parts of the advancing blue 
force being separated from one another. In the complex urban environment, the 
ground-based thin architecture is able to provide the best jamming coverage due to 
its proximity to protected forces and wide distribution throughout the battlespace. 
The thick ground-based architecture is ineffective if only one jammer can be 
allocated to CAB due to it needing to maneuver often to remain with the main 
force, which requires jamming to be shutoff. Adding another heavy jammer and 
carefully coordinating maneuvers between the two makes the thick based 
architecture a viable option. 
Thin ground-based architecture performs well in an urban scenario due to it 
being widely distributed and local to the maneuvering forces, as well as its ability 
 
Figure 17.11 Thin UAS jammer performance over time. 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
810
to continue to operate while maneuvering. There was a slight improvement in 
performance gained when thin jammers added to C2 vehicles as well as the RSTA 
vehicles due to the RSTA vehicles maneuvering ahead of main force, leaving 
some portions unprotected. 
The thin UAS-based architecture performed adequately but had difficulty with 
the complex urban terrain. The UAS did not intercept many of the threat 
communications due to the scarcity of threat communications and blockage from 
large buildings, resulting in the UAS jammer being inactive for a large portion of 
the scenario. 
In complex urban environments, the ground-based thin architecture is able to 
provide the best jamming coverage due to its proximity to blue forces and wide 
distribution across the battlespace. The thin jammer architecture is better suited to 
the complex terrain due to the large number of jammers present and the adequacy 
of their range. 
 
 
17.8 Concluding Remarks 
 
We discussed EW operations in urban terrain in this chapter. In the first part we 
provided some quotes from current U.S. Army doctrine on EW to glean an overall 
picture of how modern EW professionals view EW operations in urban terrain. 
After that, several characteristics of urban EW operations that are different from 
those in rural situations were presented. Those included indicate that such 
operations are (or can be) considerably different from rural terrain, even though 
the fundamental purpose and methods of EW are basically the same. 
 
It is important to note that most of the problems created by the urban terrain 
are due to the noncooperative nature of EW operations as opposed to the 
cooperative behavior of the target communication systems. This is a characteristic 
in common with EW in rural areas. As example of this is the possibility of using 
RAKE receivers in the target communication receivers. These can be used because 
of the knowledge of the PN codes in use in the cooperating target systems whereas 
the EW receiving system would not likely know that code. 
 
In the second part of the chapter we presented a summary of a computer 
simulation of EW effects in an urban scenario. Three cases were included: (1) a 
single heavy jammer; (2) several ground-based thin jammers mounted on host 
vehicles whose primary purpose is not hamming; and (3) a single thin jammer 
flown on a UAS. The simulation indicated that the distributed ground-based thin 
jammer architecture produced the best results. 
Future warfare will depend extensively on the ability to communicate. Creating 
dominant battlespace knowledge, where friendly forces know more about an 
adversary than that adversary knows about friendly forces will only be possible if 
communications is facilitated. 

Urban Electronic Warfare 
811
Analysis results of three architectures based on simulations were presented. It 
was shown that the best jammer configuration for the urban scenario is the 
multiple ground-based thin jammers. The primary reasons for this are two-fold: 
 
 
The jammers were distributed and therefore could detect more targets and 
effectively apply jamming power; and 
 
The jammers could operate on-the-move—they need not stop to operate.

Robust Blind Detection and Geolocation of 
CDMA Signals in an Urban Environment 
 
 
18.1 Introduction 
 
Spread spectrum signals have been used for secure communications for several 
decades [1]. Currently, they are also widely used outside the military domain, 
especially in CDMA systems [2, 3]. Due to their low probability of interception, 
these signals increase the difficulty of spectrum surveillance, such as might be 
required by the FCC or law enforcement agencies. The presence of a CDMA 
transmission is very difficult to detect. In this chapter, we describe an approach to 
the blind detection and geolocation of CDMA signals far below the noise level. It 
is based on analysis of the variations of second order statistics estimators of the 
correlator output with and without a signal present. First a threshold is determined 
below which the fluctuations in the variance with noise only present remains. The 
variations in the second-order statistics of signals received at an intercept site are 
then determined. If there is a CDMA signal hidden within the noise, and the signal 
employs a short spreading code;1 these variations rise above the threshold at 
multiples of the symbol time (1/rate). 
 
 
The organization of this chapter is as follows. We begin with a presentation of 
the problem environment we are trying to solve. Next we describe the 
mathematical model we will use. That is followed by a brief review of the 
technique used in antenna arrays called beamforming, and in particular, extensions 
to the standard beamformer model to improve its resolution. Next, the actual 
technique for detection and geolocation of CDMA signals is described. A 
particular problem in the process we describe is what we call spatial cochannel 
interference, and we discuss that as well, bounding its effects. Finally we describe 
                                                           
1 Recall that a short spreading code is a code that is repeated one or more times in every symbol.

how the DSSS detection algorithm described in Chapter 10 can be used to assist in 
the solution to the problems here. 
 
 
18.2 CDMA Signals 
 
When a DSSS signal is hidden in the noise, the actual fluctuations go above the 
noise-only threshold. Not only does the method provide a detection of a DSSS 
signal hidden in noise, but it also provides a precise estimation of the duration of 
the pseudo-random sequence used by the transmitter.  
 
The performance of the method increases with the number of windows (which 
itself increases with the duration of the signal used for computing statistics), and 
also with the length of the pseudo-random sequence used by the transmitter. For 
example, for pseudo-random sequences of length 127, and 400 analysis windows, 
the predetection limit is approximately –12 dB, and the computation time is only a 
few seconds on a PC. 
 
The problem to be solved is to detect and locate CDMA target emitters in an 
urban environment. The approach proposed is to first divide the area of interest 
(AOI) into appropriately sized cells as illustrated in Figure 18.1. Beams are then 
formed at two or more intercept sites, and these beams are steered toward each of 
these cells in turn, the current cell being examined called the cell of interest (COI). 
(Although squares are shown, palpably the shapes of the AOI and COI can be 
anything.) With CDMA, the AOI will contain many potential targets and they all 
can occupy the same frequency spectrum.2 The beamforming process eliminates 
the extra CDMA targets, which are now interferers, for all directions except the 
direction of the COI. Using an algorithmic process to detect DSSS signals, if there 
is a target within the COI, the detection process will determine this, even if the 
CDMA signal is well below the noise floor. Last, if the target set is using short 
spreading codes, as explained in Chapter 9, it is possible to blindly determine what 
the spreading code is. This process is continued until all the cells in the AOI are 
examined, and then the process is started over. Note that the cells need not be 
equal. 
 
CDMA signals share the characteristic that they overlap in the same 
frequency band. Each target signal uses a unique code to decorrelate all of the 
signals in a frequency channel. The decorrelation process collapses the signal that 
was transmitted with that unique code to a narrowband, baseband signal that can 
then be demodulated. The other CDMA signals with different codes do not 
properly decorrelate, and remain noiselike after the decorrelator. 
 
 
                                                           
2 Every cell containing every available channel is not a likely scenario for economic reasons. It is more 
likely that a cell would contain two or three channels. In the case of IS 95, for example, each channel is 
1.25 MHz wide.

Conventional direction-finding techniques, such as phase interferometry, 
cannot properly process frequency channels with cochannel interference, which is 
essentially what a set of CDMA signals is to such techniques.  
 
The thrust of this method of detection and geolocation is to employ spatial 
filters to separate the target nodes, rather than time filtering or frequency filtering. 
There are many techniques that can be applied to the problem of spatial filtering. 
We will discuss a few. 
 
 
18.3 Parametric Data Model 
 
In this section we describe the model used in the remainder of this chapter. 
 
18.3.1 Sensor Array

signal bandwidth, its measured output will be proportional to the field at

We see that (18.2) requires that the array aperture (i.e. the physical size measured 
in wavelengths) be much less than the inverse relative bandwidth (f /W). In the 
array processing literature, this is referred to as the narrowband assumption. For 
an L-element antenna array of arbitrary geometry, the array output vector is 
obtained as

As previously alluded to, a signal source can be associated with a number of 
characteristic parameters. For the sake of clarity and ease of presentation, refer to 
Figures 18.3 and 18.4; we assume that  is a real-valued scalar referred to as the

case is straightforward. 
 
The superposition principle is applicable assuming a linear receiving system. 
If M signals, denoted here by sm(t), impinge on an L-dimensional array from 
distinct DOAs 1, ..., M, the output vector takes the form

The methods to be presented all require that M < L, which is therefore assumed 
throughout this chapter. It is interesting to note that in the noiseless case, the array  
output is then confined to an M-dimensional subspace of the complex L-space, 
which is spanned by the steering vectors. This is the signal subspace, and this 
observation forms the basis of subspace-based methods, of which we will present 
one. 
The sensor outputs are appropriately preprocessed and sampled at arbitrary 
time instances, labeled t = 1, 2, ..., N for simplicity. Clearly, the process ( )
r t can be 
viewed as a multichannel random process, whose characteristics can be well 
understood from its first and second order statistics determined by the underlying 
signals and noise. The preprocessing of the signal is often done in such a way that 
( )
r t can be regarded as temporally white. 
 
18.3.2 Spatial Covariance Matrix 
 
The signal parameters that are of interest in this chapter are spatial in nature, and 
thus require the crosscovariance information among the various sensors, that is the 
spatial covariance matrix

usually termed spatially white, and is a reasonable model for receiver noise. 
However, other MMN sources need not, and probably won’t if present, result in 
spatial whiteness, in which case the noise may need to be prewhitened. More 
specifically, if the noise covariance matrix is Q, the sensor outputs are multiplied 
by
1/2

Q
prior to further processing.3 The source covariance matrix, S, is often 
assumed to be nonsingular (a rank-deficient S, as in the case of coherent signals, is 
discussed later) or near-singular for highly correlated signals.

over t = 1, 2, ..., N. We will primarily focus on reviewing a few techniques based 
on second-order statistics.  All of the earlier formulation assumed the existence of 
exact quantities (i.e. infinite observation time). It is clear that in practice only 
sample estimates, which we denote by a hat (i.e., )ˆare available. We will estimate

Throughout this chapter we assme that we know the number of signals, M, 
impinging on the antenna array. This is generally a fairly safe assumption since 
there are good and consistent techniques for estimating M in the event that such 
information is not available. 
 
 
18.4 Beamforming 
 
Many approaches have been developed to “steer” the beam of an antenna array in 
particular directions. This steering is usually implemented to avoid interference 
from emitters that are not of interest to the receiving system. We will discuss a few 
of the techniques here, but this is certainly not an exhaustive discussion. 
 
18.4.1 Conventional Delay and Multiply Beamformer 
  
Perhaps the first was the straightforward, standard delay and multiply 
beamforming (called the conventional or standard beamformer) illustrated in 

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques 
822
 
Figure 18.5 Delay and multiply beamformer. The weights, wi, can be either preset or adaptively 
determined. 
Figure 18.5. In this technique the signals from an array of antennas are multiplied 
with complex weights. Because the weights are complex, such multiplication 
modifies both the amplitude as well as the phase of the received signal. The most 
basic delay and multiply beamformer actually only varies the phase while keeping 
the amplitude common. The weights can be fixed, as in the case of a fixed 
beamformer, where the direction of the beam to be steered is known, or they can 
be changed to steer the beam in some desired direction. For this beamformer, 
however, the weights are not adaptive. For an array of L antennas, this 
beamformer will place nulls in the direction of L – 1 interfering signals.  
 
Let 
 
M = number of interfering signals impinging on the array; 
L = number of antenna elements in the array; 
P = number of calibrated angles. 
 
When the signal s(t) is impinging on the array from direction 0, the response of 
the array is given by the product of the signal and the array response to the signal, 
namely,

Unfortunately the conventional beamformer suffers from the problem of low 
resolution. Figure 18.6 shows the effects, where two signals are arriving with a 
separation of 10o when the resolution of the array is 12o. The signals cannot be 
discerned.

18.4.2 Standard Capon Beamformer 
 
The standard Capon beamformer (SCB) is an adaptation of the delay and multiply 
beamformer. A block diagram of a general adaptive beamformer is shown in 
Figure 18.7. This adaptive beamformer as shown requires knowing the signal of 
interest (or an estimate of it, which is fairly common in EW applications to include 
the one discussed in this chapter), designated by d(k). The output of the 
beamformer in the kth time interval, y(k) can be expressed as 
 
 
H
( )
( ) ( )
y k
w
k r k

    (18.24) 
 
The goal of the adaptation processor is to find the optimum weight vector w  for 
some optimality criteria. For example, in the case of the Weiner filter, the block 
diagram that is the same as the one shown in Figure 18.7, the optimality criterion 
is the minimization of the MSE in the error signal, e(k), given by

the weight vector is found by maintaining a distortionless response toward the

variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, the sample matrix 
inversion (SMI) beamformer, or the standard Capon beamformer (SCB). 
 
The resolving power of the SCB is illustrated in Figure 18.6, in comparison to 
the conventional delay and multiply beamformer. In this case, the two signals are 
clearly resolved. 
 
The SCB attempts to steer a beam in the direction of the SOI with an array 
gain of g = 1, while simultaneously steering nulls in the directions of the M 
interferers. 
 
Generally the covariance matrix, R, is not available and must be estimated. 
The most common way to do this is with the observed data sequences themselves 
as

computed. Also, when N is small compared with the number of antenna elements, 
the estimate for R can be in error as well. 
  
18.4.3 Robust Capon Beamformer 
 
There are many other possible beamformer algorithms, including several versions 
of the robust Capon beamformer (RCB). It is known, for example, that the biggest 
problem with the SCB technique is its supersensitivity to mismatches in the 
estimated angle of arrival (AOA), 0, and the closest calibrated ( ).
a  Differences 
of only a few degrees can drastically impact its performance as the SOI in this case 
is treated as interference. Various approaches have been devised, however, to deal 
with this supersensitivity problem; we will discuss a few of them here.

When the loading parameter,, is fixed, it is referred to as a fixed diagonal 
load (FDL). We describe next a method where the loading parameter is free to 
vary. It is called a general linear combination (GLC)–based robust beamformer.

As mentioned, the sample covariance matrix ˆR can be a poor estimate of the true 
covariance matrix R when N is small, relative to the array dimension M. An 
improved estimate of R is provided by the GLC-based covariance matrix estimator 
[6]. This estimator uses the sample covariance matrix ˆR and the identity matrix I 
to obtain a more accurate estimate of R than ˆ ,

Example [6]: We examine a performance comparison, as determined by the output 
SINR, as N increases for the SCB, FDL, and GLC. We also include the case when 
the true R is used (denoted by SINR). For the FDL we set the fixed DL level to 
equal the noise power, which is assumed known. We assume a ULA with M =10 
sensors and with /2 interelement spacing. The far-field narrowband source 
waveforms and the additive noise are assumed to be temporally white, circularly 
symmetric, complex Gaussian random processes with zero-mean and variances 
according to the SNRs. The noise is further assumed to be spatially white, and its 
covariance matrix is the identity matrix I. Three sources with SNRs 10 dB, 20 dB, 
and 20 dB are assumed to be present at 0o, 20o, and 60o, respectively. We assume 
that there are no errors in the array steering vector. The SOI is the first (10 dB) 
signal and the other two sources are interferers. For each scenario 1,000 Monte 
Carlo trials were performed.  
Figure 18.9 shows the mean of the output SINRs versus the number of 
snapshots N. As shown, SCB converges to the optimal SINR value very slowly, 
since ˆR contains the SOI and the SOI power is not small. GLC converges to the 
optimal value faster than all the other algorithms. FDL gives the second best 
performance. 
 
18.4.4.2 Summary 
 
In this section we have described a GLC-based robust adaptive beamformer, 
where the sample covariance matrix ˆ ,
R used in the SCB formulation, is replaced 
by an enhanced covariance matrix estimate R  given by (18.37). GLC is a robust 
DL approach where the loading elements need not be fixed or the same. We can 
efficiently obtain the enhanced covariance matrix estimate completely 
automatically (i.e., without specifying any user parameter). Numerical examples 
demonstrated the performance of GLC compared with that of the SCB and FDL.

18.4.5 Eigendecomposition Method 
 
The most robust RCB method illustrated in Figure 18.8 is based on 
eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. As before, there are two 
(mathematical) subspaces associated with R: the signal subspace and the noise 
subspace. The basis vectors of the signal subspace are orthogonal to the noise 
subspace and the basis vectors of the noise subspace are orthogonal to the signal 
subspace. The covariance matrix can be expressed as

where Us is a matrix representing the signal subspace and contains the steering 
vectors, ( ),
a corresponding to the AOAs of the signals; s is a diagonal matrix 
containing the eigenvalues of the signal subspace; Un is a matrix that represents 
the noise subspace and contains the remaining steering vectors, at angles where no 
signals are arriving; and n is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of the 
noise subspace.  
 
First we estimate the value of the covariance function. Then the 
eigendecomposition of ˆ ,
R given by (18.47), is found (there are standard software 
packages available, for example in MATLAB and MathCad, for this function).

of . The example results of this method are also shown in Figure 18.8. There is 
essentially no degradation of SINR as the error is increased, at least for the 
parameters corresponding to this example.  
 
A drawback of the eigendecomposition method is the requirement to 
frequently compute the eigendecomposition of ˆ .
R  Such an operation requires 
O(L3) floating point computations. Methods have been devised, however, to avoid 
these computations. 
 
It has been observed that RCB eigendecomposition techniques for spatial 
filtering tend to perform poorly at low SNRs. This is due primarily to the 
probability of a subspace swap, that is, the switching of the noise subspace with 
the signal subspace, as the value of the signal eigenvalues approach the value of 
the noise eigenvalues. An analysis was performed by Thomas, Scharf, and Tufts 
[7] on the susceptibility of the approach to such swapping. Some of those results 
are shown in Figure 18.10. As can be seen, good performance is maintained down 
to around 0 dB SNR before significant problems occur. 
Gp for WCDMA is about 22 dB, as is the processing gain for the other 3G+ 
standards. This is the maximum processing gain. In the worst case, if the post-

detect SNR required is 10 dB (a reasonable goal) then the predecorrelation SNR 
that is required is –12 dB, which puts the probability of subspace swap at about 
0.4. If the spreading code is unknown at the intercept receiver, then about 40% of 
the time there will be a subspace swap. With the orthogonal variable spreading 
factor (OVSF) coding in the standards, Gp can be as low as 6 dB (4 chips per 
symbol). With a coding gain of 6 dB, the predecorrelation SNR required is 4 dB, 
and the probability of subspace swap is low (essentially zero). If the code can be 
determined, as discussed in Chapter 9, then the postdecorrelation SNR is about  10 
dB, and essentially no swapping will occur in either case. 
 
 
18.5 CDMA Detection and Geolocation4 
 
The principal issue with detection and geolocation of CDMA signals is their 
frequency sharing. CDMA targets (as opposed to DSSS, which is the same 
technology but different application) are designed to use the same frequency 
channel among many target radios. As mentioned, traditional DF techniques will 
not work in such cochannel situations. The beamforming techniques mentioned 
above (and others) are capable of processing cochannel signals, typically placing 
nulls in the direction of interferers and a finite gain in the direction of the SOI. 
 
The approach considered here for CDMA signal detection and geolocation 
relies on the beamformer capability of separating signals in the spatial domain 
rather than the time or frequency domains. Multiple sensor arrays can be placed in 
the vicinity of the target AOI. The AOI is divided into cells of size determined by 
the resolution and accuracy of the sensor array. A 1 km x 1 km region (106 m2), for 
example could be divided into 10  10 m cells (102 m2), resulting in 104 cells. The 
sensors point beams to the cells (probably sequentially, but that is not necessary). 
After the nulls are established at each sensor, SOIs appearing at the look direction 
are determined and if any are detected, signal detection is declared. When two or 
more sensors detect the presence of the SOI emanating from the COI then a target 
location is declared at the COI. If 1 ms is required for the processing at each cell, 
then the entire AOI would be examined in 10 seconds. 
 
Each cell is examined in this way. This processing will result in a map of the 
AOI indicating the locations (cells) of all of the resolvable SOIs. 
 
One significant drawback of the SCB is the requirement to have a replica of 
the SOI with which the incoming signal can be compared. In addition, in theory 
the SOI must contain a training sequence for optimal weight determination. For 
the problem space being considered here, neither of these conditions applies. The 
lack of a training sequence can be handled by using (18.16) as an estimate of the 
autocorrelation matrix, which, in our case, contains noise as well as the SOI. 
Including the SOI degrades the optimality of the weights so obtained.

Modern Communications Jamming Principles and Techniques

The requirement to have a replica of the SOI is not so easily solved. A 
question to be determined is how exact must this match be in order to compute 
acceptable weights. For our problem space, we know a considerable amount about 
the SOI but we do not know it exactly. We know its modulation, for example 
(BPSK), as well as its chip and data rates. What we don’t know is the baseband 
data and the spreading code.  
 
18.5.1 Spatial Cochannel Interference 
 
As mentioned, CDMA targets are difficult to separate based on frequency because, 
by design, they overlap 100% in frequency. As depicted in Figure 18.11, SDMA 
does not totally eliminate cochannel problems, however. As shown, any target 
transmitter appearing within the beam will provide a certain amount of energy to 
the intercept site, and this energy will appear as though it is emanating from the 
target COI. 
  
To take an example of the possibility of occurrence of such cochannel 
interference, we pose an example. Suppose the AOI is 1 km  1 km, and the cells 
are 10 m  10 m. There are 104 such cells in the AOI. If there is a maximum of 60 
transmitters in the AOI , then assuming a uniform distribution throughout the AOI, 
the probability of any one cell containing a target of any variety is 6  10–3, or 
0.6%. The worst case for the interceptor is if it is located at one corner of the AOI 
and the COI is located at the diagonally opposite corner. In that case there are 
about 140 cells between the interceptor and the COI. The probability of having 
exactly n cells occupied is given by the binomial distribution

where N is the total number of possibilities (in our case N = 140), and p is the a 
priori probability of a cell containing a target (in our case p = 6  10–3). This 
distribution is plotted in Figure 18.12 using these numbers. The probability of 
having no cells occupied is reasonably good, P ~ 0.4. The probability of having 
one, which could be the COI but we have no way of knowing that, is about 0.37. 
The first possibility of having undetected spatial cochannel is when n = 2, and 
that probability is about 0.18. The remainder probabilities are as indicated in 
Figure 18.12. After about n = 4 or so, the probabilities are basically nil. Remember 
that these are worst-case probabilities. In actuality, in most cases they would be 
less. 
This argument presupposes that the beams are only wide enough to cover one 
cell at range. This equates to a beam that is 0.6o wide for this example. The 
reasonably achievable beamwidth is  maybe 5o. If  cells are  37 m  37 m, then the

required beamwidth is about 2o and the number of total cells is 841, 29 cells on a 
side, N = 41. These results are shown in Figure 18.13. 
There are ways to deal with this spatial cochannel interference; we will 
discuss a few here. 
 
 
Detect the presence of the cochannel interference and subsequently 
ignore the detection event. The uplink data streams are, in all likelihood, 
not synchronous. As such, at the intercept site, which, by practical 
assumption cannot be synchronized with the transmitter, the detected bit 
stream timing will be askew and variable, depending on the particular 
geometry of the target and the interferers as well as their signal strength. 
Such processing could be used to identify multiple transmitters in the 
beamwidth, and the subsequent detection indication ignored. The 
probabilities of having cochannel interference are fairly low in the first 
place. Ignoring a detection and moving on to the next cell would not be 
required very often. 
 
 
Demodulate the detected signals at each intercept site. If clean 
demodulation of BPSK is possible, the probability is high that it is a good 
signal without cochannel interference. 
 
 
 
Figure 18.12 Binomial distribution when N = 140, p = 6  10–3. 

Robust Blind Detection and Geolocation of CDMA Signals in an Urban Environment  
837
 
 
Demodulate the detected signals at each intercept site and exchange them 
among the sites or send them all to a central site. Such demodulation 
needs to be synchronized so that approximately the same bits are 
demodulated. At the central site, or at one or more of the intercept sites, if 
the signals correlate sufficiently then chances are very high that the 
intercept sites saw the same signal. In that case, the cochannel 
interference doesn’t matter; it’s as if it weren’t there, and accurate 
detection can be declared. 
 
 
The possible cochannel conditions that can occur are shown in Figures 18.14 
and 18.15 (of course, there can be more than one target in each beam causing the 
interference). As these figures point out, there is only one condition that can occur 
that produces an incorrect decision. That is when there is cochannel interference in 
both beams but there is no legitimate target in the COI. 
Note that this single condition in Figures 18.14 and 18.15 where a detection 
error occurs is potentially undetectable without further processing. The problem is 
when there is at least a single target in each beam and none in the COI 
[Figure18.15(c) with only one false target in the left beam]. In this case, 
examining the bit stream at each intercept site for timing anomalies will reveal 
none at either site. Therefore each intercept site will think that there is a target in 
the COI,  although they  are each  looking  at different  targets, both incorrect. The

only way to detect this problem is to compare the two bit streams from the two 
intercept sites against each other. There is a very high probability these bit streams 
will not match, even though the timing of the data collection can be synchronized 
very tightly. That will indicate that they are looking at two different targets. To 
accomplish this, however, the detected bit  streams must  be exchanged  or  both 
sent to a common site where the streams could be compared. This would require a 
datalink of some kind between the intercept sites. 
 
 
18.6 Blind Identification of CDMA Signals 
 
There have been many blind techniques for detection of DSSS signals proposed. 
We will discuss one here that has the potential for robust blind detection of 
CDMA signals, assuming that the signals employ short spreading codes. This 
technique was developed by Burel and others and is based on the differences 
between the second order statistics of a signal in noise and that of noise alone. 
A procedure was described in Section 4.4.2.5 using the fluctuations of the 
data for detection of DSSS signals. That procedure is based on the differences 
between the statistical characteristics of true noise versus pseudo-noise. That 
procedure can be used here to detect the presence of a DSSS signal in the COI at 
each of the intercept systems. 
 
 
18.7 Concluding Remarks 
 
In this chapter we presented a methodology for detecting and geolocating CDMA 
signals in an urban environment. The idea is to divide the AOI into smaller cells, 
and search these smaller cells one at a time from two or more intercept sites. Using 
beamforming technology at the intercept sites, most of the interfering signals not 
in the COI, but in the channel where the SOI are contained, are eliminated. In most 
cases, signals can be geolocated successfully with two or more intercept systems. 
In the few cases where a false detection can occur, we described some ways to 
ameliorate this problem.

under the curve from x to plus infinity.  
 
Craig derived a simpler form for the erfc function that involves only a finite

(A.5) 
 
This function is plotted in Figure A.1. For x = 0, the area under both tails of the 
Gaussian density are equal and therefore are exactly one half. The maximum value 
of Q(x) is one for large negative values of x, while the minimum is zero for large 
positive values of x. 
 
Craig also provides us with an alternate expression for the Gaussian             
Q-function that, like the complementary error function, is given by an integral 
with finite limits thereby requiring less precision than that provided by (A.5). It is 
given by

A.2 Marcum’s Q-Function 
 
Marcum’s Q-function and the zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind are 
frequently encountered in the analysis of communication systems as well as in the 
design and analysis of electronic warfare systems, where, in particular, signal 
detection problems are analyzed. Marcum’s Q-function is an integral of the tail of 
a probability density function as discussed next. The Bessel functions satisfy the 
following for a real variable x [2]

A plot of this function for small values of x is shown in Figure A.3. 
 
Marcum’s Q-function has no closed form solution and so must be determined 
by numerical means. It is also an improper integral in that one of the limits extends 
to infinity. In some cases this can cause numerical instability in its computation. 
Therefore means are sought for more reliable ways to compute it. One such 
approach was presented by Homier [3]. The expression for this function depends 
on the relationship between a and b, and is given by: 
 
If b – a > ,

In these expressions,  is a parameter that depends on how close a and b are to 
being equal. When a and b are equal, numerical problems occur, so that is treated 
as a special case. A typical value for  is 10–3.

B.1 Introduction 
 
The specific nets used in the simulations described in the text are shown in this 
appendix. In those cases where there were only these 12 nets, no other nets were 
simulated. In those cases when more than 12 nets were simulated, the additional 
nets were added to the region shown at random, but at tactically significant ranges. 
All of the numbers in these charts are in kilometers. For readers unfamiliar with 
the military symbology in the figures, the symbols are defined in Figure B.1.

Richard A. Poisel received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the Milwaukee 
School of Engineering in 1969 and an M.S. in the same discipline from Purdue 
University in 1971. He spent three years in the military service from 1971 to 1973.  
After his service he attended the University of Wisconsin, where he received a 
Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering in 1977. From 1977 to 2004 he was 
with the same government organization, which has had several different names 
and is currently known as the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering 
Command, Intelligence and Information Warfare Laboratory. During the 1993–
1994 academic year, Dr. Poisel attended the MIT Sloan School of Management as 
a Sloan Fellow, receiving an M.B.A. Initially a research engineer, Dr. Poisel 
eventually rose to the role of the director of the laboratory on an acting basis from 
1997 to 1999. He was appointed chief scientist in 1999 and was relocated to the 
Army’s Intelligence Center at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona, where he served as a 
technical advisor to the command group. He is currently employed by Raytheon 
Missile Systems as a senior engineering fellow.
