Series Foreword
The Publications Committee of the American Association 
of Neurological Surgeons began publishing the first edi-
tion of the Neurosurgical Operative Atlas in 1991. To allow 
for timely publication, coverage of six operations was pub-
lished at bimonthly intervals in looseleaf format in the 
order finished manuscripts were received. The completed 
series had nine volumes and covered the entire spectrum 
of neurosurgery.
The goal was to publish a comprehensive reference that 
included well-established neurosurgical procedures as 
practiced in the United States and Canada by authors who 
are respected in the field.
Working together, the AANS Publications Committee and 
Thieme New York have organized the second edition of this 
atlas series. The atlas’s main purpose remains the same, 
to be a ready reference for well-established neurosurgical 
procedures for trainees and practitioners of neurosurgery 
worldwide. The new edition contains five volumes, cover-
ing neuro-oncology, spine and peripheral nerves, functional, 
pediatric, and vascular neurosurgery. For each volume, one or 
more lead editors with known expertise in the subject area 
were selected. Each volume editor had complete freedom to 
add, revise, or delete chapters. The number of chapters per 
volume is approximately the same as the number of chapters 
in that particular subject area found in the first edition.
Each chapter is designed to teach a specific surgical tech-
nique or approach. The illustrations of the techniques are a 
vital part of the work, and the authors commissioned most 
of the drawings in color. The text in each chapter covers the 
case selection, the operative indications and contraindica-
tions, special points in the anesthetic technique, a step-by-
step detailed description of the operation, and postoperative 
complications. Detailed discussion of diagnostic techniques, 
pathology, mechanisms of disease, histology, and medical 
management are not included since they are logically out-
side the scope of a surgical atlas. Detailed tables, reference 
lists, and statistical analysis of results are also not included 
because they are readily available in standard texts.
We hope you find this reference of value in your practice 
of neurosurgery.

Preface
As a subspecialty, functional neurosurgery is unique in two 
respects. It is the branch of neurosurgery that relies most 
heavily on brain physiology to guide the surgical approach 
and confirm the final result. Fueled by rapid advances in 
neuroscience, it is also the subspecialty experiencing the 
most rapid introduction of novel procedures for novel in-
dications.
In this revised and updated edition of the operative at-
las, the authors cover surgical techniques, indications, and 
perioperative complications for the major procedures of 
functional neurosurgery. The chapters are organized around 
three branches of functional neurosurgery: epilepsy, pain, 
and movement disorders. Physiological principals and re-
cording techniques are explained and illustrated. Many of 
the procedures that will evolve in the near future, such as 
new targets for deep brain stimulation, will utilize techni-
cal approaches similar to those described here for today’s 
“standard” brain targets. Where multiple technical ap-
proaches may be taken for a particular procedure, we have 
included chapters detailing each type of approach. There 
are a number of new topics covered since the first edition, 
including new brain stimulation indications, “frameless” 
neuronavigation approaches to deep brain targets, and use 
of interventional MRI. The text may serve as a preoperative 
reference for advanced practitioners as well as newcomers 
to the field.

  Subdural and Stereotactic Depth Electrode 
Implantation in the Evaluation of Ablative 
Epilepsy Surgery Candidates 
  Joseph R. Smith and Kostas N.  Fountas 
    The effectiveness of depth and subdural electrode record-
ings in localizing epileptic foci is well documented. In recent 
years we have used invasive monitoring in 47% of our an-
terior mesial temporal resections (ATL) with normal mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI), in 19% with mesial tempo-
ral sclerosis (MTS), and in 29% with foreign tissue. Invasive 
monitoring has been used in 88% of extramesial temporal or 
neocortical (XMT) resections with normal MRI and in 45% 
with foreign tissue lesions. 
 Ancillary studies such as positron emission tomography 
(PET), subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered with MRI (SIS-
COM), and magnetic source imaging (MSI) may help localize 
the focus of the seizure. However, invasive electrographic 
monitoring remains the standard for seizure focus localiza-
tion in cases inadequately localized with noninvasive elec-
troencephalography (EEG).  
 Patient Selection 
 All patients considered for depth or subdural electrode im-
plantation have disabling simple or complex partial seizures 
(with or without secondary generalization) that have re-
sponded poorly to multiple antiepileptic medications for 
two or more years. All candidates must also be free of any 
signiﬁ cant medical or psychiatric problems. 
 Most cases undergoing invasive monitoring have normal 
MRIs. These cases undergo implantation of an array of sub-
dural or depth electrodes. Localizing data obtained from in-
terictal or ictal EEG recordings correlated with clinical seizure 
characteristics determine the areas of implantation. Patients 
with signiﬁ cant bitemporal interictal or ictal discharges un-
dergo bitemporal implantation of amygdalohippocampal 
depth electrodes to determine whether there is a dominant 
resectable focus. Bitemporal bur hole subdural electrodes (8-
contact depth-type) are added to monitor anterior basal and 
lateral temporal cortex, particularly when there is no MRI 
evidence of MTS. Use of depth-type electrodes for subdural 
monitoring has the advantage of allowing the removal of the 
electrodes without reopening the bur hole incision. 
 Preoperative carotid amytal testing may conﬁ rm the ab-
sence of sufﬁ cient contralateral recent verbal memory sup-
port. In this case, a patient with MRI-documented left MTS 
and ipsilateral electrographic epileptiform abnormalities 
may undergo implantation of a combination of left amyg-
dalohippocampal depth electrodes and left anterior tem-
poral subdural grid and strip electrodes. If the seizure focus 
excludes the mesial temporal or temporal language areas, 
resection is feasible. 
 Cases with poor interictal and ictal electrographic locali-
zation are unlikely to be localized with invasive monitoring. 
In some of these cases, ancillary studies such as SISCOM 
occasionally provide enough localizing information to guide 
subsequent electrode implantation (e.g., a mesial frontal 
seizure focus).  
 Types of Electrode Implants 
 All depth electrodes (AdTech Corp., Racine, WI, USA) have 
a diameter of 1.3 mm. The contact lengths are 2.3 mm. 
The contacts are made of MRI compatible platinum. The 
contact wires are made of platinum, and are individually 
insulated with Teflon. The outer insulation of the elec-
trode shaft is polyurethane impregnated with barium. The 
electrode contacts and the contact collars at the tails of 
the electrodes are all sealed to prevent cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) leakage. The number of contacts and intercontact 
spacing used per electrode vary from 4 to 12, but both 
may be customized to the area of implantation.   Figure 
1.1   illustrates the locations of our more commonly used 
electrode trajectories. 
 Subdural electrodes (AdTech Corp., Racine, WI, USA) are 
composed of the same contact and insulating materials as 
depth electrodes. Standard contact spacing is 10 mm, and 
the exposed diameter of contacts is 2.3 mm. Subdural strips 
and grids vary considerably in conﬁ guration. The particular 
electrodes used are dictated by the interictal and ictal scalp 
EEG ﬁ ndings, initial clinical seizure characteristics, imaging 
data (e.g., cases where a seizure focus is suspected to be 
adjacent to a structural lesion), as well as by the results of 
intraoperative electrocorticography at the time of implan-
tation.   Figure 1.2   shows examples of depth and subdural 
electrodes.

Subdural and Stereotactic Depth Electrode Implantation

  Preoperative Preparation 
 The areas of entry of the depth electrodes and the location 
of the craniotomy incision determine the area of scalp to be 
clipped and shaved. Antibiotics are begun intravenously on the 
morning of surgery and are continued for 24 hours after sur-
gery. Versed is given intravenously for preoperative sedation. 
Depth and subdural electrode implantation may be done under 
general anesthesia or neuroleptanalgesia using alfentanil and 
propofol. If only depth electrodes are being implanted in a co-
operative patient, neuroleptanalgesia is used, and a ﬁ eld block 
of the scalp is performed ( Fig. 1.3 ). A mixture of 20 cc of 0.25% 
Marcaine ( bupivacaine hydrochloride)  with epinephrine, 20 cc 
of 0.5% Lidocaine with epinephrine, and 4 cc of sodium bicar-
bonate 8.4% is used. The bicarbonate neutralizes acidity and 
considerably reduces the discomfort of the block. Additional 
local anesthesia is used for bur hole incisions if depth type 
subdural strip electrodes are implanted  ( Figs. 1.3 A,B) . 
 If a craniotomy is being done for implantation of sub-
dural electrodes, general anesthesia may be used. Motor 
mapping may be accomplished under general anesthesia. 
Neuroleptanalgesia with local anesthesia is used if language 
or sensory stimulation mapping is being conducted intraop-
eratively. Alternatively, language or sensory mapping can 
be accomplished extraoperatively by stimulating individual 
subdural contacts.  
 Operative Procedure  
 Computerized Stereotactic Depth Electrode Target 
and Trajectory Acquisition 
 The MRI/computed tomography (CT)-compatible Leksell 
basering and localizer (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) is ﬁ xed 
to the patient’s skull  ( Fig. 1.4 ) . Carbon ﬁ ber posts and MRI/
CT-compatible pins are used. The MRI scan consists of a con-
trast enhanced T-1 weighted volume acquisition using axial 
1.3 mm slices with zero slice gaps. This is followed with a 
whole head CT scan using 3 mm slices with zero slice gaps. 
The two datasets are imported over the local network to the 
computer workstation (BrainLab, Heimstetten, Germany). 
After fusing the MRI data to the CT data, targets and trajec-
tories are deﬁ ned (  Fig. 1.5 A) . A probe view algorithm is used 
to maximize the distance between any surface veins and 
depth electrodes at the cortical entry points  ( Fig. 1.5 B) .

Subdural and Stereotactic Depth Electrode Implantation

 Depth Electrode Placement 
 The patient is positioned semisitting for implantation of 
posterior entry depth electrodes (e.g., amygdalohippocam-
pal electrodes with occipital entry)  ( Fig. 1.1 A) . If the entry 
point is anterior or vertex, the patient is positioned supine. 
If craniotomy or bur holes for subdural electrodes are to fol-
low, the approximate incision locations are also marked off 
with gentian violet. Depth and bur hole depth type subdural 
electrodes are usually placed in that order with a single 
prepping and draping. If craniotomy for subdural grids fol-
lows depth implantation, separate prepping and draping are 
done after depth electrode placement. 
 The Leksell stereotactic apparatus is an arc radius system 
with a radius of 190 mm. The x, y, and z target coordinates, 
and the ring (anterior-posterior) and arc (lateral) angles of 
trajectory derived from the computer workstation are trans-
ferred to the arc apparatus manually. The arc is adjusted 
from side to side to set the computer generated x value, 
which is seen on the vernier scale on the right side of the bar 
to which the arc attaches. The vertical side bars are adjusted 
in the anterior-posterior direction to set the computer-gen-
erated y value (the vernier scales are on the lateral bars of 
the basering), and in the superior-inferior direction to set 
the computer generated z value (seen on the vertical vernier 
scales on side bars). The guide block holder slides along the

side bar. The side bars are adjusted in the anterior-posterior direction 
to set the computer-generated y value, and in the superior-inferior di-
rection to set the computer-generated z value. The large arrow shows 
the guide block holder. This slides along arc to adjust arc angle (lateral 
angle). The small black arrow points to the left trunion. Rotation of 
the arc around the trunions adjusts the ring angle (anterior-posterior 
angle).

arc to adjust arc angle (lateral angle). Rotation of the arc 
around the trunions adjusts the ring angle (anterior-poste-
rior angle). The arc is attached to the basering  ( Fig. 1.6 ) . 
 The entry point is inﬁ ltrated with several cc’s of 0.5% 
Lidocaine hydrochloric acid (HCL) with epinephrine, and 
incised with a #15 blade. A drill guide tube is then advanced 
through the incision down to the skull, and antibiotic irri-
gation is ﬂ ushed through the tube. After estimating a drill 
length that will pass only slightly beyond the inner table, 
a 7/64-inch twist drill hole is made with a high-speed air-
driven drill  ( Fig. 1.7 ) . After passing through the inner table, 
the drill bit is advanced inward an additional 1–2 mm to 
partially lacerate the dura and facilitate subsequent pas-
sage of a monopolar cauterizing electrode. The drill guide 
and guide block are then replaced with a 2.1 mm inner di-
ameter guide block. The dura and pia are cauterized with 
a monopolar electrode (AdTech, Racine, WI, USA). This is 
shown in  Fig. 1.8 .

 Next, a 14-gauge depth electrode cannula (Ad Tech Corp., 
Racine, WI, USA) is passed through the same guide block 
to the target point  ( Fig. 1.9 A) . This creates a track through 
which the electrode with semirigid stylet may be accurately 
placed. Intraoperative ﬂ uoroscopy is used to verify proper 
placement  ( Fig. 1.9 B) . The cannula and guide tube are then 
withdrawn. An insertion tool (AdTech Corp., Racine, WI, 
USA) is passed through a large diameter guide block, and 
inserted into the slot and central bore of an anchor bolt 
 ( Fig. 1.10 A) . The anchor bolt is then screwed into the twist 
drill hole until it no longer easily advances. The insertion 
tool and guide block are then removed. The depth electrode 
is then inserted after marking off a length off 190 mm  ( Fig. 
1.10 B) . Fluoroscopy is used to verify proper location. The 
stylet of the electrode is removed, and the distal shaft of 
the electrode is wrapped in the threading of the head of the 
anchor bolt. It is secured with liquid Silastic and a Silastic 
cap  ( Fig. 1.11 ) . By using CSF-tight depth electrodes, liquid 
Silastic, and Silastic caps, CSF leakage is eliminated. 
 During the procedure intravenous neuroleptanalgesia is 
maintained with propofol and alfenta (alfentanil hydrochlo-
ride) at such a level that the patient is somnolent but easily 
arousable. The patient is repeatedly checked for arousability 
and orientation. If there is any alteration in level or con-

tent of consciousness, intravenous sedation is tapered or 
discontinued. If there is no improvement, the procedure is 
terminated, and an emergency CT scan is performed to rule 
out an intracranial hematoma. 
 After all electrodes are placed, each entry site is covered 
with antibiotic ointment. Labels are then placed on the dis-
tal end of each electrode for later identiﬁ cation in the moni-
toring suite by the EEG technicians . 
 Subdural Electrode Placement 
 If bur hole depth type subdural electrodes are to be placed 
 ( Fig. 1.12 ), the previously marked-off incisions are inﬁ l-
trated with 0.5% Lidocaine and the incisions made. A nickel-
size bur hole is made with an air-driven drill and the dura is 
opened linearly. After the electrodes are inserted, the dura 
is closed with running interlocking 4–0 dural suture. The 
electrode tails are brought out through separate exit points 
created by a 14-gauge Tuohy needle and secured with 3–0 
nylon purse string sutures  . The distal ends of all electrodes 
are then attached to the scalp with adhesive strips. The ba-
sering apparatus is removed, and a craniotomy type dress-
ing is applied. 
 If a craniotomy is being performed for implanting sub-
dural grid electrodes, either neuroleptanalgesia is used if 
language or sensory mapping is being performed intraop-
eratively, or general anesthesia is administered. The area to 
be monitored dictates craniotomy size and location.   Figures 
1.13 A and 1.13 B  show a craniotomy with subdural grid elec-
trodes in position and a postoperative X-ray, respectively.

Electroencephalographers refer to these when localizing the 
seizure focus.  Figures 1.14 A and 1.14 B show the method of 
exiting and securing the electrode cables, respectively. CSF 
leakage has been virtually eliminated by using multicontact 
subdural grid electrodes with multiple small diameter cables 
secured with purse string sutures at skin exit sites. If occipital 
entry electrodes were placed, their anchor bolts are covered 
with ﬂ uffed burn gauze and incorporated into the craniot-
omy dressing. A neck roll is used throughout the monitoring 
period to protect these depth electrodes from dislodging. 
 Recording 
 Recording is begun shortly after the patient returns to the 
monitoring unit. Usually it requires a partial or complete 
tapering of antiepileptic medication before seizures occur. 
If all seizures are localized to the same region, recording 
three or four habitual seizures is sufﬁ cient. If the case is 
complex (e.g., independent bilateral anteromesial temporal 
foci, or more than one seizure focus suspected based on two 
clinically different seizure types), at least twice as many 
seizures may need to be recorded. After the recordings are 
completed, the patient is placed back on therapeutic doses 
of antiepileptic medication. Simultaneous recording and 
storing EEG and video are mandatory for the epileptolo-
gist to determine whether a recorded electrographic seizure 
precedes the clinical seizure, as would be expected.  
 Stimulation Studies 
 Extraoperative stimulation mapping is usually done in cases 
where subdural grid electrodes are implanted under gen-
eral anesthesia in or near presumed functional areas. Map-
ping is done 24 hours after the patient is placed on loading 
doses of antiepileptic medication (after recording has been 
completed).  
 Electrode Removal 
 Once all studies are completed, the depth and bur hole 
depth type subdural electrodes are removed in the moni-
toring unit using antiseptic precautions. Sedation is rarely 

 
1

necessary in adults. Removal is done with the patient su-
pine to prevent any pneumocephalus that might occur if the 
electrodes were extracted with the patient’s head elevated. 
After removing each depth electrode, the entry site is cov-
ered with antibiotic ointment and a sterile absorbant pad.  
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 After all subdural and depth electrodes are removed, a ﬁ sh-
net-type stockinet cap is placed on the patient’s head to 
hold the pads in place. The patient’s head is then maintained 
in a ≥ 45 degree head up position for the next 24 hours to 
allow the entry sites to seal off. If they remain dry overnight, 
the patient is discharged with instructions to keep the head 
dry for several days. Resective surgery is planned no sooner 
than 6 weeks after the electrodes are removed to ensure all 
entry sites heal properly. Subdural grid and strip electrodes 
are removed during a second intraoperative procedure.  
 Complications 
 Hemorrhage and infection are the most common compli-
cations associated with implantation. By using contrast-
enhanced MRI for depth electrode implantation (see Com-
puterized Stereotactic Depth Electrode Target and Trajectory 
Acquisition) and observing CSF-tight closures (see Depth 
Electrode Placement and Subdural Electrode Placement), 
these should be kept to a minimum.

  Selective Hippocampectomy Sparing 
Amygdala and Neocortex for Temporal 
Lobe Epilepsy 
 Michel F.  Levesque 
 Excision of the anterior temporal lobe is the most fre-
quently performed procedure for temporo-limbic epilepsy 
and has been classically associated with good seizure con-
trol. Surgical outcome can be signiﬁ cantly improved if there 
is lateralized initial focal sphenoidal onset with ictal scalp 
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, preoperative evi-
dence of localized metabolic dysfunction on ﬂ uorodeoxy-
glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and if 
hippo campal sclerosis is identiﬁ ed as the underlying patho-
logical substrate in the absence of extra-hippocampal le-
sion (dual pathology). Anterior temporal lobectomy, how-
ever, creates new pervasive cognitive deﬁ cits in learning 
and memory functions and moderate to severe affective 
disorders in some patients. The need to develop a more 
selective procedure was pioneered by Niemeyer, and led 
to the technique of selective amygdalohippocampectomy 
by Yasargil. We have modiﬁ ed these surgical techniques 
based on the hypothesis that the entorhinal-hippocampal 
complex is the generator and ampliﬁ er of abnormal epilep-
tiform discharges and that hippocampal sclerosis is a nec-
essary and sufﬁ cient pathological substrate of nontumoral 
temporo-limbic epilepsy. 
 Patient Selection 
 Patients are selected after electrographic and behavioral 
seizure onsets are documented with noninvasive video-
telemetry recordings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
with and without contrast agent will rule out any structural 
lesion. Hippocampal volumetric studies on coronal MRI can 
also quantify degrees of hippocampal atrophy. A battery of 
neuropsychometric tests is administered to all patients and 
scored according to standard procedures. Before surgery, 
a Wada test (intracarotid amytal injection) will document 
language lateralization and contralateral memory functions 
to minimize risks of global amnesia. The ideal candidate 
for the selective anterior hippocampectomy-sparing pro-
cedure will have a focal sphenoidal seizure onset on scalp 
EEG localizing to one temporal lobe, convergent neuropsy-
chological deﬁ cits, nonlesional imaging studies, and a sup-
portive Wada test. In some cases, quantitative cerebral 
[ 18 F]-FDG-PET can be performed to complete the evaluation. 
Stereotactic intracranial recording of chronically implanted 
depth electrodes can also be used to select patients for this 
procedure when noninvasive localization fails to indicate a 
focal onset.  
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The introduction of frameless stereotactic image guidance 
has greatly facilitated the planning and execution of the 
selective hippocampectomy-sparing amygdala and neocor-
tex procedure. A preoperative MRI of the brain is obtained 
with ﬁ ducial markers attached to the patient’s scalp and 
images are transferred to the workstation. The entry point 
and extent of the craniotomy can be planned before surgery 
and the trajectory from the sylvian ﬁ ssure to the lateral horn 
outlined and injected later in the viewﬁ nder of the operat-
ing microscope. Under general anesthesia, the patient will 
receive a loading dose of phenytoin to reach therapeutic 
levels, prophylactic antibiotherapy, and dexamethasone. 
Other medications or anticonvulsants delaying bleeding 
time (such as valproic acid) will be stopped at least two 
weeks before the procedure.  
 Operative Procedure 
 In the supine position, the head is turned to the contra lateral 
side of the exposure and a small roll placed under the ip-
silateral shoulder. The head is then secured in the Mayﬁ eld 
three-point headrest (Integra Lifesciences, Plainsboro, NJ) 
with the temporal branch of the zygoma placed along the 
horizontal plane. The sagittal midline is then elevated to 
30 degrees, similar to the position for anterior temporal 
lobectomy. This allows a better exposure of the plane to 
the hippocampal sulcus and entorhinal cortex. The ﬁ ducial 
markers placed preoperatively are then read with a wand, 
activating the receivers from the image guidance system. 
After standard sterile draping, a frontotemporal skin ﬂ ap is 
elevated and wrapped in a moist laparotomy sponge  ( Fig. 
2.1 ) . A longitudinal incision of the temporalis muscle along 
its ﬁ ber is made toward the origin of the zygomatic arch 
and divided along its superior attachment. The two ﬂ aps of 

 
2 Selective Hippocampectomy Sparing Amygdala and Neocortex  13
muscle are elevated with a periosteal elevator and retracted 
anteriorly and inferiorly. A frontotemporal craniotomy is 
then performed to expose the sylvian ﬁ ssure, without drill-
ing the pterion down. The surgical approach and eventual 
resection margins are illustrated in  Fig. 2.2 . 
 At a distance of 5 cm from the tip of the temporal pole, the 
microscope is brought over the surgical ﬁ eld and the entry 
point selected preoperatively is identiﬁ ed. Two microsurgi-
cal jewelers’ forceps are used to mobilize and separate the 
arachnoid layer covering the sylvian draining veins to access 
the sylvian ﬁ ssure. The sylvian draining veins are mobilized 
and gently elevated laterally or superiorly according to the 
variable anatomy of this region. This exposes the sylvian 
cistern between the temporal and frontoparietal operculum 
 ( Fig. 2.3 ) . The subarachnoid space is entered mesially and

inferiorly along branches of the sylvian trifurcation, distal 
to the temporo-polar artery, anterior to the Heschl gyrus 
and angular artery. The inferoposterior insular sulcus is 
then exposed along an avascular region  ( Fig. 2.4 ) . A 1 cm 
longitudinal keyhole incision is made along the sulcus lep-
tomeninges with microbipolars and a microsuction tip. The 
direction of the dissection into the lateral temporal horn is 
here critical and should be at 45 degrees lateral and within 
1 cm of the entry point from the inferior insular sulcus. Lon-
gitudinal ependymal arterioles usually indicate the vicinity 
of the roof of the ventricle, identiﬁ ed by a gush of clear 
cerebro spinal ﬂ uid. A tapered 5 mm wide microretractor 
can be used to elevate the lateral roof of the ventricle. This 
exposes the dorsal hippocampus, which is identiﬁ ed from 
the anterior tip of the ventricle to the trigone region. 
 The inferolateral boundary of the resection parallels the 
collateral eminence, lateral to the curved pes hippocampus 
to reach the collateral sulcus above the tentorial edge. This 
initial lateral dissection is performed with microbipolars 
and a microsuction tip. Microcottonoid pledgets are left 
anteriorly and posteriorly and will be retrieved after the 
mesial dissection is completed. Our attention and micro-
scope are then directed toward the mesial structures above 
the pes hippocampus. With a microcottonoid, the choroid 
plexus is gently elevated mesially to expose the white ﬁ m-
bria-fornix. This structure is dissected and elevated longitu-
dinally from anterior to posterior with a blunt micro-nerve 
hook or microbipolar and traversed to reach the subarach-
noid space  ( Fig. 2.5 ) . The choroidal ﬁ ssure remains unex-
posed and no attempt is made to identify the optic tract 
located superiorly and mesially to the choroidal ﬁ ssure. 
This dissection is carried inferiorly, leading to the ambi-
ens cistern. Ammon’s horn arteries arising distally from the 
lateral trunk of the anterior choroidal artery or posterior 
cerebral artery are identiﬁ ed and divided at their closest 
entry points into the hippocampal sulcus. The uncal artery 
is also divided and the uncus is dissected anteriorly then 
laterally at the pes-amygdala junction to reach the collat-
eral sulcus where the anterior microcottonoid is retrieved. 
The posterior hippocampus is transected along a coronal 
plane at 3 cm from the pes to reach the initial posterior 
lateral dissection and posterior microcottonoid. The pia of 
the entorhinal-parahippocampal gyrus is incised and the 
entorhinal hippocampus is elevated to produce an en bloc 
specimen  ( Fig. 2.6 )  suitable for quantitative histology or in 
vitro neurophysiological studies. 
 This sharp dissection is avascular and the blood loss is 
minimal. The dural closure is performed in a watertight 
fashion and the skull, temporalis muscle, and skin closures 
are standard.  
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The patient is extubated and sent to the recovery room 
and the intensive care unit for overnight observation. A 
postoperative computerized tomography of the brain is 
performed the next day before the patient’s transfer to the 
ﬂ oor, where he is kept for an additional 24 to 48 hours 
before discharge. One or two anticonvulsants are adjusted 
to maintain therapeutic seric levels. The dexamethasone, 
accompanied by an antacid, is tapered over the following 
10 days. Headaches and jaw pain from the temporalis mus-
cle are usual postoperative complaints. Complications of 
upper quadrantanopia, transient dysnomia, or transient 
hemiparesis are much less frequent than those found after 
temporal lobectomies. 
 The major advantage of this selective hippocampec-
tomy procedure is that the amygdala and neocortex are 
spared, producing a seizure-free outcome with minimal 
cognitive and affective changes. The preservation of the 
temporal neocortex is beneﬁ cial to the patient’s cognitive 
outcome because it is involved in perception and immedi-
ate memory functions by its coordinated and distributed 
activity, and in long-term declarative memory following 
Fig. 2.4 Exposure of the inferolateral sulcus of the insula at the site of 
entry toward the lateral horn of the ventricle. Note the relative avascu-
lar plane parallel to a distal branch of the middle cerebral artery.

campus. This leads to the perforating Ammon’s horn arteries along

slow synaptic changes. These functions are independent 
from mesiotemporal lobe structures and justify a more 
selective resection that preserves a functional neocortex 
remote from the “zone of seizure origin.” The amygdala, 
a major projection center for several neurochemical sys-
tems, has a more controversial role in the generation of 
temporo-limbic epilepsy. We believe this structure is not 
part of the generator-ampliﬁ er complex of hippocampal 
epilepsy and is not subject to selective vulnerability that 
leads to dynamic pathological changes in the hippocam-
pus. Leaving the amygdala intact should prevent severe 
affective disorders seen after amygdalohippocampectomy 
and temporal lobectomy. 
 Our technique of selective transinsular hippocampectomy 
is safer than selective amygdalohippocampectomy and of-
fers the shortest route to the inferior horn of the lateral 
ventricle. It does not require drilling of the pterion, does 
not expose the carotid artery, optic nerve, or the origin of 
the anterior choroidal artery into the lateral ventricle. Selec-
tive amygdalohippocampectomy reaches only the anterior 
portion of the hippocampus after a large removal of the 
amygdala and retraction back into the ventricle, allowing 
a limited resection of the anterior pes. Postoperative MRIs 
following our technique are presented in   Figure 2.7 . We 
have demonstrated a seizure-free status in  about 95% of 
our patients and shown signiﬁ cant improvement in verbal 
and memory scores compared with patients who receive 
anterior temporal lobectomies. None of our patients have 
suffered severe depressive symptoms during a mean follow-
up period of 36 months. 
 Selective transinsular hippocampectomy does not replace 
an anterior temporal lobectomy in cases of regional tempo-
ral seizure onset, associated with more widespread pathol-
ogy, or posterior lateral onset requiring epicortical language 
and seizure mapping. Because the incidence of hippocampal 
epilepsy represents about 65% of patients with temporal 
lobe epilepsy, this may reﬂ ect the incidence of patients who 
may beneﬁ t from this technique.

 Surgical Anatomy of the Temporal Lobe 
 Arthur J. Ulm III, Necmettin Tanriover, Albert L. Rhoton Jr., and Steven N. Roper 
 
  The temporal lobe is an area of great importance for all 
neurosurgeons, especially for those involved in the surgi-
cal treatment of epilepsy. Successful surgery within the 
temporal lobe requires an understanding of structural and 
functional relationships and demands that the surgeon pos-
sess a three-dimensional grasp of the anatomy so that he or 
she can dissect through the parenchyma to deep structures 
without veering off course. As in other areas, the proper 
identiﬁ cation of key landmarks is critical to this process; 
these will be discussed in this chapter. The cortex of the 
temporal lobe includes the six-layered neocortex of the 
superior, lateral, and inferior surfaces as well as the perial-
locortex and allocortex of the mesial temporal structures. 
Its boundaries include the sylvian ﬁ ssure, superiorly, and 
the limits of the middle fossa, inferiorly and anteriorly. 
The medial boundaries are formed by the insula and the 
crural and ambient cisterns. The posterior limit is deﬁ ned 
by the lateral parietotemporal line (which runs from the 
parieto-occipital sulcus to the preoccipital notch), the tem-
poro-occipital line (which runs perpendicular to the lateral 
parietotemporal line and intersects the posterior extension 
of the sylvian ﬁ ssure), and the basal parietotemporal line 
(which runs along the medial surface of the hemisphere 
from the preoccipital notch to the origin of the parieto-
occipital sulcus). 
 Superior Temporal Lobe 
 The sylvian fissure forms the superior boundary of the 
temporal lobe. It is divided into a sphenoidal compart-
ment, anteriorly, and an operculoinsular compartment, 
posteriorly. The middle cerebral artery begins at the bi-
furcation of the internal carotid artery and its M1 segment 
then courses through the sphenoidal portion of the sylvian 
fissure to the surface of the insula. The M2 segment begins 
in the operculoinsular compartment of the sylvian fissure 
at the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery into a su-
perior and inferior trunk  ( Fig. 3.1 ) . The trunks give rise to 
the various branches of the middle cerebral artery, which 
course to the perimeter of the insula, the circular sulcus. 
The M3 segment refers to these branches as they run from 
the circular sulcus to the surface of the sylvian fissure. The 
branches that course from the sylvian fissure over the sur-
face of the hemisphere are called the M4 segments. After 
exiting the sylvian fissure, some branches of the middle 
cerebral artery course over the lateral surface of the tem-
poral lobe and provide its arterial supply. These include the 
uncal, temporopolar, and anterior temporal arteries, which 
may arise before the bifurcation of the middle cerebral 
artery, and the middle and posterior temporal arteries, 
which arise from the inferior trunk of the middle cerebral 
artery (  Fig. 3.2 ) . The fissure also contains the superfi-
cial and deep sylvian veins. The superficial Sylvian vein 
drains the superior portion of the lateral temporal lobe. It 
empties into the sphenoparietal sinus, anteriorly, and the 
transverse sinus, via the vein of Labbe, posteriorly. It may 
also empty into the superior sagittal sinus via anastomotic 
veins that course over the convexity of the hemisphere. 
The deep sylvian vein runs in the floor of the sylvian fissure 
and empties into the basal vein of Rosenthal. The insula 
of Reil lies deep to the sylvian fissure and is covered by 
and peripherally contiguous with the opercular cortices 
of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes  ( Fig. 3.3 ) . It is 
a periallocortical area that is circumscribed by the circular 
sulcus. It is divided into several gyri breves and gyri longus 
by five to seven radially oriented sulci. The anteroinferior 
limit of the insula is called the limen insulae  ( Fig. 3.3 ). 
Many descriptions of anterior temporal lobectomy include 
a subpial resection of the superior temporal gyrus over the 
sylvian fissure. The limen insulae marks the endpoint of 
this resection. 
 The superior surface of the temporal lobe is composed 
of the superior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, He-
schl gyrus (gyri), and the planum temporale. Heschl gyrus, 
which may be single or multiple in a given temporal lobe, 
runs in an oblique direction across the top of the temporal 
lobe and contains the primary auditory cortex  ( Fig. 3.3 ) . The 
planum temporale lies posterior to Heschl gyrus and is sepa-
rated from it by Heschl sulcus  ( Fig. 3.1 C) . It is a triangular 
area that is involved with language processing. The planum 
temporale shows left-right asymmetry with the dominant 
planum temporale having a larger surface area than the 
nondominant one.

tion into the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery 
(MCA). The M1 pre-bifurcation segment of the MCA extends from the 
ICA bifurcation to the MCA bifurcation and runs in the sphenoidal com-
partment of the sylvian ﬁ ssure. The M1 segment continues a variable 
distance as M1 post-bifurcation trunks before the genu at the level of 
the limen insulae. At the limen insulae, the post-bifurcation trunks turn 
to run along the surface of the insula as the M2 segments. The M2 seg-
ments run within the sylvian compartment of the sylvian ﬁ ssure. (B) 
Coronal dissection demonstrating the course of the MCA within the 
sphenoidal and Sylvian compartments of the sylvian ﬁ ssure. The M1 pre- 
and post-bifurcation trunks run within the sphenoidal compartment. At 
the limen insulae the artery turns to run posteriorly within the sylvian 
compartment. The genu marks the division between the M1 and M2 
segments of the artery. The M2 arteries give off branches to the lateral 
cortex which course over the frontal, parietal, and temporal opercula. 
The opercular portions of the MCA correspond to the M3 segments. 
(C) Superior view into the temporal horn demonstrating the close rela-
tionship of the MCA to temporal lobe structures. The M1 segment lies 
anterior and superior to anterior pole of the temporal horn. The anterior 
choroidal artery arises from the ICA distal to the take off of the posterior 
communicating artery (PCoA), traverses the crural cistern and enters 
the medial aspect of the temporal horn posterior to the apex of the 
uncus. (D) The M1 segment frequently gives off cortical branches prior 
to its bifurcation. These branches are early frontal and early temporal ar-
teries. Lenticulostriate arteries often arise from the proximal segment of 
these early branches. P.Com.A. = posterior communicating artery; CNIII

temporal polar, anterior temporal, middle temporal, posterior temporal, 
temporo-occipital, and angular arteries, which arise as distal branches 
from the inferior trunk and early temporal branches. The orbital frontal, 
prefrontal, precentral, central, and anterior parietal arteries arise from 
the superior trunk and from early frontal branches. (C) Close-up view of

be seen. The red and black arrows mark insular stem arteries which 
give off perforators to the insula and which divide into multiple cortical 
branches. (D) Lateral view of the perisylvian cortex. The cortical M4 end

 Lateral Temporal Lobe 
 The lateral surface of the temporal lobe is composed of the 
superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri  ( Fig. 3.4 ) . They 
are separated by the superior and inferior temporal sulci. 
Sulcal anatomy is subject to considerable variability. The 
anterior end of the superior temporal gyrus may extend up 
to or over the temporal tip. At its posterior end, it may com-
municate with the sylvian ﬁ ssure, the angular sulcus, the 
anterior occipital sulcus, or the inferior temporal sulcus. The 
base of the superior temporal sulcus is the closest point on 
the lateral surface of the temporal lobe to the temporal horn, 
a distance of about 10–12 mm according to the work of Ono 
and colleagues. The inferior temporal sulcus often extends 
over the temporal tip. Posteriorly, it may communicate with 
the superior temporal sulcus, the occipitotemporal sulcus, 
the lateral occipital sulcus, or the intraparietal sulcus. The 
most important functional consideration in this area is the 
posterior primary language area. Based on cortical stimula-
tion studies, this is most commonly located in the poste-
rior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, although this 
is subject to individual variability. The arterial supply to the 
lateral surface of the temporal lobe was discussed in the 
previous section on the sylvian ﬁ ssure. The superior, lateral 
temporal lobe is drained by a group of small temporosylvian 
veins, which course over the superior temporal gyrus and 
empty into the superﬁ cial sylvian vein. The remainder of 
the lateral surface is drained by the anterior, middle, and 
posterior temporal veins, which course inferiorly and drain 
into the lateral tentorial sinus, the vein of Labbe, or directly 
into the transverse sinus. 
 Inferior Temporal Lobe 
 The inferior surface of the temporal lobe is formed by the in-
ferior aspect of the inferior temporal gyrus, the lateral occipi-
totemporal (fusiform) gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus 
 ( Fig. 3.5 ) . The occipitotemporal sulcus separates the inferior 
temporal gyrus from the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus. An-
teriorly, the occipitotemporal sulcus may communicate with 
the rhinal sulcus or the collateral sulcus. Posteriorly it may 
communicate with the inferior temporal sulcus, the superior 
temporal sulcus, or the lateral occipital sulcus. The collateral 
sulcus separates the lateral occipitotemporal gyrus from the 
parahippocampal gyrus. Anteriorly it may communicate with 
the rhinal sulcus. Posteriorly, it may communicate with the 
occipitotemporal sulcus, the calcarine sulcus, or the inter-
lingual sulcus. The rhinal sulcus forms the lateral boundary 
of the most anterior portion of the parahippocampal gyrus. 
Most of the inferior surface of the temporal lobe is supplied by 
the anterior, middle, and posterior temporal arteries, which 
arise from the P2p and P3 segments of the posterior cerebral 
artery in the ambient cistern and then course over the edge

21
of the tentorium and the parahippocampal gyrus  ( Fig. 3.6 ) . 
Venous drainage of the inferior temporal surface (lateral to 
the collateral sulcus) is provided by the anterior, middle, and 
posterior temporobasal veins. These veins run posterolater-
ally and usually end in the lateral tentorial sinus. 
 Mesial Temporal Lobe 
 The mesial temporal structures lie medial to the collateral 
sulcus and inferior to the temporal horn of the lateral ven-
tricle. They include the parahippocampal gyrus, the hippoc-
ampal formation, the uncus, and the amygdala. The view 
from the temporal horn is critical in orienting the surgeon to 
the structural relationships of the mesial temporal lobe  ( Fig. 
3.7 ) . The ﬂ oor of the temporal horn is formed by the dorsal 
surface of the hippocampus, medially, and the collateral emi-
nence, laterally  ( Fig. 3.7 ) . The roof of the temporal horn is 
formed by the deep temporal white matter and the tail of the 
caudate nucleus and the stria terminalis also run in this area 
 ( Fig. 3.8 ) . The anterior roof of the temporal horn is formed by 
the inferior surface of the amygdala. The medial aspect of the 
temporal horn is formed by the choroidal ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 3.7 ) . 
A slightly different angle of orientation is afforded by the 
trans-sylvian, transinsular approach used for selective amy-
gdalohippocampectomy as described by Yasargil  ( Fig. 3.9 ) . 
 Following the cortex from the parahippocampal gyrus 
to the dentate gyrus, there is a transition from six-layered 
neocortex in the parahippocampal gyrus to three-layered 
allocortex in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus  ( Fig. 3.8 ) . 
The subdivisions of the subiculum (presubiculum, para-
subiculum, subiculum, and prosubiculum), which lie be-
tween the parahippocampal gyrus and the hippocampus, 
form a transitional zone in this process. The hippocampus 
proper (Ammon’s horn) is composed of a layer that contains 
pyramidal cell axons and basal dendrites (stratum oriens), a 
layer that contains the soma of the pyramidal cells (stratum 
pyramidale), and a layer that contains the apical dendrites 
of the pyramidal cells (strata moleculare, radiatum, and la-
cunosum). The alveus is the gross anatomical structure that 
is formed by pyramidal cell axons and forms the surface that 
faces the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. The same 
axons go on to form the ﬁ mbria (a fold of white matter that 
abuts the choroidal ﬁ ssure)  ( Fig. 3.8 )  and the fornix. The 
fornix is composed of ﬁ bers running between the hippo-
campus and the subiculum in the temporal lobe and the sep-
tal, hypothalamic, and thalamic nuclei. The dentate gyrus is 
composed of a dendritic layer (the molecular layer), which 
contains the soma of the dentate granule cells (the granule 
cell layer), and a polymorphonuclear layer (the hilus), which 
contains granule cell axons (mossy ﬁ bers) and interneurons. 
The hippocampus can be divided into an anterior portion 
(called the pes or the head), and is recognized by several 
small, round protuberances on its ventricular surface (the 
digitationes), a middle portion (the body), and a posterior 
portion that curves superiorly toward the splenium of the 
Fig. 3.5 (A) Inferior view of temporal lobe. From lateral to medial there 
are three prominent sulci. The occipital temporal sulcus separates the 
inferior temporal gyrus from the occipitotemporal gyrus (OTG). The 
collateral sulcus separates the OTG from the parahippocampal gyrus. 
Anteriorly, the rhinal sulcus lies lateral to the uncus. (B) Close-up view

tern and the posterior segment faces the cerebral peduncle. Rhinal S. =

Fig. 3.6 (A) Dissection of the perimesencephalic cisterns showing the 
relationship of the hippocampus to the mesial temporal structures. The 
posterior cerebral artery gives off multiple hippocampal perforating 
arteries as well as the medial and lateral posterior choroidal arteries. 
The head of the hippocampus lies lateral to the apex and posterior seg-
ment of the uncus and occupies a portion of the ﬂ oor and medial wall 
of the temporal horn. (B) The posterior cerebral artery is divided into 
anatomic parts based upon location. The P1 segment extends from the 
basilar artery to the posterior communicating artery (PCoA). The P2a 
segment extends from the PCoA through the crural cistern to the back 
edge of the cerebral peduncle. The P2p begins at the back edge of the 
cerebral peduncle and runs through the ambient cistern and ends at the 
collicular plate. The P3 segment is the portion that traverses the quad-
rigeminal cistern. The anterior choroidal artery arises from the internal 
carotid artery just distal to the PCoA and runs through the crural cistern 
entering the temporal horn at the inferior choroidal point which lies just 
posterior to the posterior segment of the uncus. The inferior choroidal 
point marks the beginning of the choroidal ﬁ ssure within the temporal 
horn. (C) Inferior view of temporal lobe after removal of the uncus and 
parahippocampal gyrus on the right side of specimen. The PCA gives 
off several branches within the ambient cistern. These branches include 
the lateral PCA, which supplies the choroid plexus of the temporal horn, 
and inferior temporal arteries, which supply the inferior temporal lobe 
and anastamose with temporal branches from the middle cerebral ar-
tery. The P2p segment often takes a superior and lateral course within 
the ambient cistern above the parahippocampal gyrus making access 
to this segment difﬁ cult. Tail = tail of hippocampus; Body = body of hip-

corpus callosum (the tail)  ( Fig. 3.6 ) . Posteriorly, the tail of 
the hippocampus is contiguous with the gyri of Andreas 
Retzius, the fasciola cinerea, the gyrus fasciolaris, and the 
subsplenial gyrus. In cross-section, the hippocampal forma-
tion is an S-shaped structure; the parahippocampal gyrus 
forms the base, the subiculum forms the ﬁ rst curve back 
(laterally), the area CA1 of the hippocampus forms the top 
curve, and areas CA2 and CA3 curve back down toward the 
subiculum  ( Fig. 3.8 ) . The end of the hippocampal pyramidal 
layer (CA4) lies in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the V-
shaped granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus sits astride 
the end of this pyramidal layer. Because of this infolding, the 
hippocampal sulcus is formed between the lower blade of 
the dentate gyrus (above) and the subiculum (below). The 
hippocampal sulcus is the entry point for the hippocampal 
arteries that supply this area  ( Figs. 3.6 and 3.7 ) . They arise 
as a series of two to six small branches off of the posterior 
cerebral artery and end in tiny radial branches called the 
arteries of Uchimura. 
 The hippocampal sulcus is a key structure in the en bloc 
resection of the mesial temporal lobe. From the vantage 
point of the temporal horn, it is exposed by teasing the ﬁ m-
bria away from the choroidal ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 3.7 ) . The sulcus is 
then appreciated as a two-layered pial structure with small 
vessels running between its pial leaves that sit below the 
edge of the dentate gyrus with the subiculum lying deep to 
it. Anteriorly, the hippocampal sulcus fans out laterally and 
anteriorly with a portion of the pes hippocampi and the pos-
terior portion of the uncus lying above it and the anterior 
extension of the parahippocampal gyrus lying inferior to it 
 ( Fig. 3.7 ) . This lateral extension is an excellent area to begin 
the dissection through the hippocampal sulcus because, at 
that point, it is lateral to the edge of the tentorium and one 
is much less likely to enter the crural or ambient cisterns. 
 The parahippocampal gyrus runs between the collateral 
and rhinal sulci, laterally, and the subiculum medially  ( Figs. 
3.5 and 3.10 ) . Posteriorly, it is contiguous with the isthmus 
of the cingulate gyrus and the lingual gyrus  ( Fig. 3.10 ) . Ante-
riorly, it is contiguous with the uncus. The entorhinal cortex 
is not a gross anatomical landmark, but it is functionally 
important because it forms the primary point of communi-
cation between the hippocampal formation and the rest of 
the cerebrum. It is located in the anterior portion of the pa-
rahippocampal gyrus. The perirhinal cortex lies just lateral 
to it and lines the wall of the rhinal sulcus  ( Fig. 3.10 ) . 
 The uncus is an anteromedial extension of the parahip-
pocampal gyrus and the pes hippocampi  ( Fig. 3.10 ) . It ex-
tends medially across the edge of the tentorium to abut the 
Fig. 3.7 Intraoperative photographs demonstrating relationships be-
tween the right hippocampus, ﬁ mbria, hippocampal sulcus, and uncus. 
Anterior is up and medial is to the left in all images. In (A), the ﬁ mbria is 
seen as a ﬂ ap of white matter that is contiguous with the alveus (which 
forms the ventricular surface) of the hippocampus. In (B), the ﬁ mbria 
has been dissected away from the choroidal ﬁ ssure to expose the poste-
rior cerebral artery in the ambient cistern through the intact arachnoid. 
In (C), more of the ﬁ mbria has been removed (and the vantage point 
of the microscope has been moved superiorly) to expose the anterior 
longitudinal hippocampal vein (Ant. Long. Hippocampal V.) in the hip-
pocampal sulcus. The surface of the subiculum can be seen through the 
hippocampal sulcus. In (D), the dissection has proceeded through the 
dorsal aspect of the pes hippocampi to demonstrate the leading edge 
of the hippocampal sulcus. The uncus extends medially from this point 
to enter the anterior incisural space.

crural cistern and the cerebral peduncle. Its medial surface 
contains ﬁ ve small gyri. Anteriorly, the sulcus semianularis 
separates the semilunar gyrus (above) from the gyrus am-
biens (anteriorly) and the uncinate gyrus (posteriorly). The 
band of Giacomini and the intralimbic gyrus are located 
posterior to the uncinate gyrus. The uncal sulcus is formed 
by the uncus folding posteromedially over the parahippo-
campal gyrus. A more general classiﬁ cation of the uncus con-
sists of the anterior segment, which faces the carotid cistern, 
the posterior segment, which faces the cerebral peduncle, 
and the apex, which is the medial-most point of the uncus. 
 The amygdala is a nuclear complex that lies anterosupe-
rior to the pes hippocampi. Superiorly, the lateral extension 
of the anterior commissure and the substantia innominata 
separate it from the putamen and the globus pallidus. It is 
composed of two groups of nuclei. The corticomedial group 
includes the anterior amygdaloid area, the nucleus of the 
lateral amygdaloid tract, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, and 
the cortical amygdaloid nucleus. The larger basolateral group 
includes (going lateral to medial) the lateral amyg daloid nu-
cleus, the basal amygdaloid nucleus, and the accessory basal 
amygdaloid nucleus. Because of a lack of gross anatomical 
landmarks within the amygdala and its proximity to the di-
encephalon, the superomedial portion of the amygdala is 
usually left in place during anterior temporal lobectomy. 
 The arterial supply to the mesial temporal structures is 
provided by the internal carotid artery, the anterior choroi-
dal artery, and the posterior cerebral artery. The anterior 
choroidal artery arises from the internal carotid artery 
just superior to the posterior communicating artery in the

superomedial aspect of the temporal horn (this is the plexal 
segment of the anterior choroidal artery)  ( Fig. 3.11 C) . In 
addition to mesial temporal structures, it supplies portions 
of the optic tract, the lateral geniculate body, the posterior 
limb of the internal capsule, the globus pallidus, the origin 
of the optic radiations, the middle one third of the cerebral 
peduncle, the head of the caudate nucleus, the red nucleus, 
the subthalamic nucleus, and areas of the thalamus. 
 The posterior cerebral arteries arise from the bifurcation 
of the basilar artery. The P1 segment extends to the point 
where it is joined by the posterior communicating artery in 
the lateral portion of the interpeduncular cistern. The P2a 
portion extends from the posterior communicating artery 
to the back edge of the cerebral peduncle; the P2p segment 
begins at the posterior edge of the peduncle, traverses the 
ambient cistern and ends at the collicular plate  ( Fig. 3.6 ) . 
The P2a and P2p segments give off the hippocampal arter-
ies  ( Figs. 3.6 and 3.11 ) . The P3 segment begins at the back 
edge of the collicular plate and traverses the quadrigeminal 
cistern. The P4 segment begins where the posterior cerebral 
artery bifurcates into the parieto-occipital and calcarine ar-
teries. The P2p and P3 segments give off inferior temporal 
branches that supply the inferior surface of the temporal lobe 
and anastamose with the middle cerebral artery. In addition 
to temporal lobe branches, the cisternal portion of the pos-
terior cerebral artery also gives rise to the medial and lateral 
posterior choroidal arteries  ( Fig. 3.6 ) , the thal amogeniculate 
arteries, and the posterior thalamoperforating arteries. These 
vessels supply portions of the thalamus, the pulvinar, the 
medial and lateral geniculate bodies, the region of the pos-
terior commissure, and the lateral mesencephalon. 
 The uncus is supplied by small branches which may arise 
from the internal carotid artery, the middle cerebral artery 
(before its bifurcation), or the anterior choroidal artery  ( Fig. 
3.6 ) . The amygdala is supplied by branches from the anterior 
choroidal artery or the anterior temporal branch of the mid-
dle cerebral artery. The parahippocampal gyrus is supplied 
by the inferior temporal branches that arise from the P2p 
and P3 segments of the posterior cerebral artery. Venous 
drainage of the mesial temporal structures is provided by 
the anterior hippocampal vein, the uncal veins, the anterior 
and posterior longitudinal hippocampal veins  ( Fig. 3.7 C) , 
the inferior ventricular vein, and the inferior choroidal veins, 
which empty into the basal vein of Rosenthal. The basal vein 
of Rosenthal can be divided into three segments. The stri-
atal segment extends from the ventral aspect of the anterior 
perforated substance to the point where it is joined by the 
peduncular vein on the anterior surface of the cerebral pe-
duncle. The peduncular segment  ( Figs. 3.6 and 3.12 ) extends 
from the peduncular vein through the superior aspect of the 
ambient cistern to the lateral mesencephalic sulcus, where 
it is joined by the lateral mesencephalic vein. The mesen-
cephalic segment courses around the midbrain through the 
quadrigeminal cistern and joins the internal cerebral veins 
and the contralateral basal vein to form the vein of Galen. 
 In addition to blood vessels, the crural and ambient cis-
terns contain and abut many structures that are important to 
be aware of so that they may be protected during surgery of 
the mesial temporal lobe. The oculomotor nerve runs in the 
crural cistern between the uncus and the cerebral peduncle 
carotid cistern  ( Fig. 3.6 B) . The cisternal segment of the ante-
rior choroidal artery then traverses the crural cistern, which 
is a lateral extension of the interpeduncular cistern that 
lies between the uncus and the cerebral peduncle. Just be-
hind the uncus, the anterior choroidal artery penetrates the 
choroidal ﬁ ssure and runs within the choroid plexus in the

to enter the cavernous sinus  ( Figs. 3.6 and 3.12 ) . The troch-
lear nerve runs through the ambient cistern just below the 
edge of the tentorium to enter the cavernous sinus as well. 
The optic tract runs in the superior aspect of the ambient cis-
tern from the chiasm to the lateral geniculate body  ( Fig. 3.5 ) . 
After exiting the lateral geniculate body, the geniculocal-
carine ﬁ bers (optic radiations) take two courses to the pri-
mary visual cortex. The ﬁ bers subserving the contralateral, 
inferior visual quadrant travel posteriorly in the roof of the 
posterior temporal horn to the supracalcarine cortex. The 
ﬁ bers that carry information from the contralateral superior 
visual quadrant take a more circuitous course (Meyer loop) 
along the inferior and lateral walls of the temporal horn. It is 
these ﬁ bers which can be damaged during anterior temporal 
lobectomy and produce the partial, superior quadrantanop-
sia that is an occasional sequela of this surgery. The lateral 
aspect of the mesencephalon also lies in close proximity to 
the posterior mesial temporal structures. The posterior edge 
of the collicular plate marks the boundary between the am-
bient and quadrigeminal cisterns  ( Figs. 3.7 and 3.10 ) .

The choroid plexus is attached to both sides of the choroidal ﬁ ssure by 
the taniae fornix and the taniae thalami. The collateral trigone and emi-
nence are formed by the impression of the collateral sulcus on the ﬂ oor

the lateral ventricle. The head of the hippocampus forms part of the ﬂ oor

the temporal horn. The uncal recess is a cleft between the anterior head 
of the hippocampus and the amygdala. It marks the most anterior exten-
sion of the temporal horn and lies anterolateral to the inferior choroidal 
point. The hippocampal arteries arise from the posterior cerebral artery 
and course through the hippocampal sulcus. (C) Close-up view of choroi-

body. (D) Anterior choroidal ﬁ ssure dissection. The taniae thalami attach

 Temporal Lobectomy under General 
Anesthesia 
 Diana L. Abson-Kraemer and Dennis D. Spencer  
  In many major epilepsy centers, epilepsy surgery is per-
formed with the patient under general anesthesia. This 
chapter will focus on the techniques developed by the sen-
ior author (DDS) at the Yale University Medical Center for 
standard anteromedial temporal resection and amygdalo-
hippocampectomy (AMTR) on patients with medically in-
tractable epilepsy of medial temporal onset. This operation 
is designed to resect the anterior 3–3.5 cm of the middle and 
inferior temporal gyri, most of the amygdala, and 3–4 cm of 
the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus  ( Fig. 4.1 ) . 
 This procedure has been designed to maximally resect me-
sial structures and to minimize lateral neocortical resection 
because the pathological substrate responsible for seizures 
has been identiﬁ ed within the mesial structures. The radical 
resection of mesial structures detailed in this procedure re-
moves all potentially epileptogenic hippocampus to the level 
of the quadrigeminal plate. This approach allows maximal 
resection of hippocampus with no additional neuropsycho-
logical or neurological morbidity, ensuring that operative 
failure cannot occur because of retained mesial structures. 
 The extent of lateral temporal neocortical resection is 
limited to the temporal pole to allow access to the medial 
temporal structures: 3–3.5 cm of inferior and middle tem-
poral gyri is removed and the superior temporal gyrus is 
completely spared. Language dominance in the resected 
hemisphere does not alter the surgical planning or modify 
the neocortical resection, as we have not observed perma-
nent aphasia after limited neocortical resection. 
 Patient Selection 
 Patients with medically intractable epilepsy of medial tem-
poral lobe origin are candidates for AMTR after all preop-
erative screening criteria have been evaluated. Patients for 
whom the screening criteria suggest a unilateral temporal 
focus are operated on without invasive intracranial ictal 
monitoring. The following criteria must be concordant for 
these patients: ictal onset lateralized to one hemisphere 
as seen on electroencephalography; unilateral mesial tem-
poral atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); neu-
ropsychological and Wada testing to conﬁ rm memory dys-
function consistent with the side of ictal onset; and Wada 
conﬁ rmation that the contralateral hemisphere supports 
memory function. Patients who do not meet these criteria 
Fig. 4.1 Overview of planned surgical resection. Anterolateral resec-
tion will include 3–3.5 cm of the inferior and middle temporal gyri, and 
mesial resection will include 3–4 cm of the hippocampus and para-
hippocampal gyrus. (From Blackwell Scientiﬁ c Publications, Inc., from

may require intracranial monitoring to correctly identify the 
site of ictal onset before a surgical resection is performed. 
 Some patients may not meet the requirements for a 
standard AMTR. Exclusionary criteria include suspicion by 
electroencephalographic or imaging criteria that the origin 
of epileptogenesis is not within the medial temporal lobe. 
Findings that might alter selection for a standard mesial re-
section include the absence of hippocampal atrophy on MRI, 
a neocortical structural lesion on imaging studies, or docu-
mentation of lateral neocortical ictal onset by invasive elec-
trode recordings. In such cases, the patient might require 
subdural grid placement for ictal localization and language 
mapping or intraoperative mapping of language function 
under local anesthesia during temporal lobectomy. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Anatomy 
 Mesial temporal resection requires particular knowledge 
of the intimate anatomic relationship of the amygdala and 
hippocampus to structures in the perimesencephalic region. 
The amygdala is bordered medially by the carotid artery 
and optic tract, and superiorly by the anterior perforated 
substance and basal ganglia. The head of the hippocampus is 
bordered medially by the third nerve, the posterior cerebral 
artery, and crus cerebri, and is bordered superiorly by the 
optic tract and then by the lateral geniculate body as one 
moves posteriorly. The tail of the hippocampus is bordered 
medially by the parahippocampal gyrus, and superiorly by 
the pulvinar of the thalamus, internal capsule, and tail of 
the caudate nucleus. The surgeon must possess a thorough 
knowledge and three-dimensional understanding of this 
anatomy before performing this procedure. See the anatomy 
texts by Duvernoy, Pernkopf, or Rhoton for comprehensive 
illustrations of this complex anatomy  ( Fig. 4.2 ) . 
 Anesthesia 
 The following protocol of “light” general anesthesia has been 
developed to minimize the effects of anesthetic agents on 
intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) and evoked po-
tential monitoring. Patients receive no medications before

horn of the left lateral ventricle. The relationship of the hippocampus 
to the amygdala, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and thalamus can be 
appreciated. (From Platzer W (ed), Monsen H (transl): Pernkopf Anatomy:

Patients are maintained on a fentanyl infusion of 1–2 μg/
kg/hr and 0.25–0.75% isoﬂ urane inhalation anesthesia, and 
are immobilized with pancuronium. The scalp is inﬁ ltrated 
with local anesthesia prior to the surgical incision. If ECoG 
is performed, the end-tidal isoﬂ urane concentration is 
reduced to lower than one half MAC and nitrous oxide is 
discontinued 30 minutes before ECoG. Once ECoG is com-
pleted, the anesthesiologist adjusts the anesthetic regimen 
as clinically necessary, and the patient is given droperidol 
and midazolam as amnestic agents. This regimen appears 
to minimize the effects of anesthetic agents on ECoG and 
provide effective anesthesia: no patient has reported recall 
of the procedure postoperatively. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The standard anteromedial temporal resection may be di-
vided into the following steps, which are described in de-
tail in this chapter: exposure, lateral neocortical resection, 
exposure of the temporal horn and hippocampus, resection 
of the amygdala, and mobilization of the hippocampus and 
parahippocampal gyrus. 
 Exposure 
 Surgery is performed with the patient under general an-
esthesia as previously described, and the patient receives 
an arterial line and Foley catheter for intraoperative moni-
toring. The patient is placed supine with the ipsilateral 
shoulder supported by a blanket roll. The head is clamped 
into three-point pin ﬁ xation and turned laterally 80 degrees 
until the zygoma is the most superior point of the head; the 
vertex of the head is then dropped very slightly. This posi-
tion provides access to the lateral temporal neocortex and 
allows a direct line of vision along the length of the tempo-
ral horn and hippocampus during medial dissection. 
 A question mark incision is inscribed to expose the tem-
poral lobe and inferior frontal lobe  ( Fig. 4.3 ) . The temporalis 
fascia and muscle are incised with monopolar cautery and 
are reﬂ ected anteriorly. The temporalis fascia is undercut 
along the posterior 1–2 cm of the zygoma to augment the 
anterior reﬂ ection of the temporalis ﬂ ap; however, care 
must be taken to avoid the seventh cranial nerve, which 
lies within the uppermost layers of this fascia. A high-speed 
drill is used to fashion a free bone ﬂ ap over the inferior 
frontal and temporal lobes; care is taken to maximize the 
anterior and inferior reaches of the exposure. More bone is 
removed along the ﬂ oor of the middle fossa and at the an-
terior temporal tip with rongeurs. Any air cells encountered 
during exposure are sealed with bone wax. Exposure of the 
most anterior and inferior aspects of the temporal fossa is 
of paramount importance for the success of the rest of the 
procedure because this lessens the subsequent retraction 
on the lateral temporal neocortex, which is required to gain 
access to the posterior hippocampus during the last stages 
of dissection. Ideally, the ﬂ oor of the temporal fossa and the 
anterior temporal tip are within a centimeter of the margins 
of the bone ﬂ ap. One centimeter of the lateral sphenoid 
ridge is removed, which allows the sylvian ﬁ ssure and infe-
rior orbital frontal lobe to be visualized. 
 A U-shaped dural incision is begun inferiorly and fol-
lows the bone margins so the dural ﬂ ap may be reﬂ ected 
superiorly over the sylvian ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 4.3 ) . An additional 
T-shaped incision is made at the anterior temporal fossa 
to expose the temporal tip. Strict hemostasis is achieved 
with dural tack-up sutures, and the reﬂ ected dura is covered 
with a moist cottonoid pledget to prevent shrinkage during 
the procedure. The sylvian ﬁ ssure and the superior, middle, 
and inferior temporal gyri are identiﬁ ed and the exposed 
surfaces of the brain are covered with collagen sponges and 
cottonoid pledgets. 
 Lateral Neocortical Resection 
 Lateral neocortical resection of the middle and inferior 
temporal gyri is performed en bloc to allow pathological 
examination of the specimen. The arachnoid over the mid-
dle temporal gyrus is incised 3–3.5 cm from the anterior 
temporal tip, and the line of resection is carried into the 
inferior temporal gyrus using bipolar cautery and ultrasonic 
aspiration. The superior margin of the resection is limited by 
the arachnoid of the superior temporal gyrus. The depth of

bone ﬂ ap, and dural incision are demonstrated. The anterior reﬂ ec-
tions of the scalp and temporal muscle have been omitted for clarity.

pocampus to the level of the quadrigeminal plate.
the resection extends to 2.5–3 cm and includes the fusiform 
gyrus  ( Fig. 4.4 ) ; with experience, more fusiform gyrus can be 
removed during neocortical resection, simplifying exposure 
of the temporal horn and mobilization of mesial structures. 
 Bridging veins from the sylvian ﬁ ssure to the sphenopa-
rietal sinus will be identiﬁ ed at the anterior temporal tip. 
Bleeding from these veins is likely during temporal lobe 
retraction unless they are cauterized and divided during this 
stage of the procedure. Review of the late venous phase of 
the patient’s Wada test will identify the occasional patient 
for whom this drainage represents a signiﬁ cant source of 
runoff; in such cases, the veins can be preserved by decreas-
ing the amount of lateral neocortical retraction. Once the 
neocortical resection is completed, two self-retaining Green-
berg 5/8-inch retractor blades are positioned, one to support 
the superior temporal gyrus, and the second is placed on the 
cut surface of the middle and inferior temporal gyri. 
 Exposure of the Temporal Horn and Hippocampus 
 The temporal horn of the lateral ventricle is a key landmark 
for the exposure and resection of mesial structures. The tem-
poral horn lies deep to the exposed surface of white matter, 
which was previously covered by the middle temporal gyrus. 
Ultrasonic aspiration or bipolar cautery is used to divide this 
white matter until the temporal horn is entered. The head 
of the hippocampus is visible as a rounded mass indenting 
the medial surface of the temporal horn opposite the site of 
entry, and may be injured if dissection is carried too deeply. 
The ependymal surface and choroid plexus are identiﬁ ed 
and a cottonoid pledget is placed into the temporal horn to 
protect the choroid plexus from manipulation and to pre-
vent blood in the resection bed from entering the ventricular 
system. These pledgets will be replaced and moved posteri-
orly as the length of temporal horn is exposed. 
 The hippocampus is exposed by opening the temporal 
horn to the level of the calcar avis. This is done by incising 
the fusiform (occipitotemporal) gyrus along the occipito-
temporal fasciculus until the arachnoid of the mesial oc-
cipital temporal gyrus is identiﬁ ed. Incision of the fusiform 
gyrus creates a line from the ﬂ oor of the temporal horn to 
the ﬂ oor of the middle temporal fossa  ( Fig. 4.4 ) : this line 
will run parallel to the operating room ﬂ oor because the 
patient’s head is laterally rotated. Dissection begins at the 
original entry point into the temporal horn and continues 
posteriorly through the fusiform gyrus so the ventricle will 
be opened to the level of the calcar avis  ( Fig. 4.4 ) . The tail 
of the hippocampus will curve medially as it passes behind 
the quadrigeminal plate, marking the limits of posterior dis-
section. An attempt to keep the plane of dissection within 
the mesial fusiform gyrus will minimize a Meyer loop as it 
courses along the lateral and inferior aspects of the tem-
poral horn; in most cases this will avoid even a superior 
temporal quadrantanopsia. The retractor blade supporting 
the lateral temporal neocortex is bent and inserted along 
the cut edge of the lateral fusiform gyrus to support the 
freed lateral temporal lobe during this dissection  ( Fig. 4.5 ) . 
Care during retraction is advisable to minimize transient 
postoperative language disturbances. Any remaining mesial 
fusiform gyrus is removed using the ultrasonic aspirator 
before the mesial resection is begun. 
 Resection of the Amygdala 
 Resection of the mesial structures begins by removing the 
inferior two-thirds of the amygdala and uncus of the pa-
rahippocampus. The operating microscope is moved into 
the ﬁ eld for the remainder of the procedure. The amygdala 
is identiﬁ ed anteromedial to the temporal horn, and an 
incision from the tip of the temporal horn is directed an-
teriorly and medially toward the lesser sphenoid wing to 
transect the amygdala  (Fig. 4.5) . The amygdala is bounded 
superiorly by the anterior perforated substance and basal 
ganglia; therefore, a conservative resection that does not 
reach above the limits of the superior temporal gyrus is 
advisable. Subpial resection of the amygdala is performed

using ultrasonic aspiration, or alternatively, can be mobi-
lized using a dissecting spatula if a pathological specimen 
is desired. Orientation of the amyg dala is enhanced if a por-
tion of the ependyma is included with the specimen; this 
allows the lateral amygdaloid nucleus to be identiﬁ ed for 
qualitative or quantitative analysis. Subpial dissection of 
the amygdala will expose the arachnoid overlying the free 
edge of the tentorium, third nerve, and posterior cerebral 
artery during this dissection. The retractor which had been 
supporting the superior temporal gyrus is inserted deeper 
to gently retract the superior temporal gyrus, the temporal 
stem, and the cut margin of the amygdala. While under the 
microscope, any remaining uncus can be removed from the 
tentorial edge using ultrasonic aspiration and microdis-
section; care must be taken to preserve the arachnoid. The 
dissection proceeds posteriorly, through the ﬁ ber tracts of 
the uncinate fasciculus and the intralimbic lobe of the pa-
rahippocampus, to the hippocampus proper  ( Fig. 4.5 ) . 
 Mobilization of Hippocampus/Parahippocampal 
Gyrus 
 Mobilization of the hippocampus and parahippocampal 
gyrus represents the most technically difﬁ cult aspect of 
the case; however, careful attention to arachnoidal planes 
and a detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the region 
minimize the risks of this resection. We routinely reduce 
the degree of suction, bipolar cauterization, and ultrasonic 
aspiration along the free margin of the tentorium to de-
crease the risk of injury to medial structures during this 
dissection. 
 Mobilization of the parahippocampus along the collat-
eral sulcus will aid in dissection of the parahippocampal 
gyrus and hippocampus. Subpial dissection along the pa-
rahippocampal gyrus is performed using ultrasonic aspira-
tion to free it from the collateral sulcus until the posterior 
portion of the hippocampus is seen to curve medially be-
hind the superior colliculus. Several arteriolar branches 
emanating from the posterior cerebral artery may enter 
the collateral sulcus and will be encountered during dis-
section. They are cauterized once well within the sulcus, 
then divided sharply with microscissors; if the specimen 
is to be used for electrophysiological experiments, this 
blood supply is preserved until the last moments of the 
dissection. 
 Mobilization of the medial parahippocampal gyrus, hip-
pocampus, and ﬁ mbria requires dissection along the hip-
pocampal ﬁ ssure and arachnoid overlying the brain stem 
and thalamus. The medial parahippocampal gyrus (subicu-
lum) is freed using subpial dissection with the ultrasonic 
aspirator; great care is taken to respect the integrity of the 
arachnoidal planes that cover the brain stem and the perfo-
rating vessels that supply it  ( Fig. 4.6 ) . Small vessels from the 
posterior cerebral and anterior choroidal arteries will enter 
the hippocampal ﬁ ssure to supply the hippocampus and 
parahippocampus. Recurrent branches can arise off these 
arterioles to supply the midbrain; therefore, these vessels 
may be cauterized and then sharply divided with microscis-
sors only after they are well within the ﬁ ssure. 
 The ﬁ mbria is prominent posterior to the choroidal ﬁ s-
sure and is easily elevated from the arachnoid overlying 
the lateral inferior thalamus; it can then be divided with 
the ultrasonic aspirator. The tail of the hippocampus will 
be seen curving behind the quadrigeminal plate at the 
posterior margins of the resection. The ultrasonic aspira-
tor is used to transect the hippocampus by cutting across 
its tail, aiming for the collateral sulcus and the previous 
incision made along the occipitotemporal fasciculus. This 
resection should allow en bloc delivery of 3 cm of intact 
Fig. 4.5 Approach to the mesial structures. (A,B) The

(D) Resection of the amygdala. Ultrasonic aspiration

tion. The line of vision of the surgeon is shown for ori-
entation. (From Blackwell Scientiﬁ c Publications, Inc,

hippocampus for pathological inspection. If the patient’s 
preoperative workup revealed strong evidence for posterior 
hippocampal seizure onset, an additional resection of the 
residual hippocampal tail may be performed using ultra-
sonic aspiration. Special mention of the anatomy of this 
region is warranted; the tail of the hippocampus is bor-
dered superiorly by the pulvinar of the thalamus, the inter-
nal capsule, and the tail of the caudate nucleus. Therefore, 
any superior diversion at this level could lead to signiﬁ cant 
neurological injury. 
 Once the hippocampus is delivered, strict hemostasis of 
the resection bed is achieved using Surgicel or Gelfoam; 
cauterization of the arachnoid overlying the brain stem is 
avoided. The retractors are removed, allowing the lateral 
temporal lobe to settle into position. The dura is reapproxi-
mated, incorporating a graft if necessary to form a water-
tight closure. The bone ﬂ ap is secured into position and the 
scalp is closed in anatomical layers. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Several complications of this procedure can be avoided with 
careful attention to surgical technique. Transient dysphasia, 
seen in about one-half of dominant temporal lobe resec-
tions, may be secondary to disconnection of the medial and 
lateral temporal lobes and may be exaggerated by retrac-
tion. This dysphasia uniformly resolves within a week after 
surgery. 
 Visual ﬁ eld deﬁ cits have become uncommon as the Meyer 
loop is largely spared by this resection. Hemianopsia could 
occur if en passant branches of the inferior occipitotem-
poral artery within the arachnoid of the inferior temporo- 
occipital lobe are transected during dissection. Injury to 
these vessels at the posterior resection along the occipi-
totemporal fasciculus may be avoided by ensuring that all 
posterior dissection is performed using subpial technique 
with ultrasonic aspiration and that the pia arachnoid is cau-
terized only after careful inspection. 
 Cranial neuropathies have been reported in the neuro-
surgical literature after temporal lobectomy. Palsies of the 
third, fourth, and seventh cranial nerves are reported as 
complications. The risk of transient neuropathies of the 
third and fourth cranial nerves may be avoided by meticu-
lous attention to arachnoidal planes and by avoiding bipo-
lar cauterization along the incisura. The temporalis branch 
of the facial nerve may be protected by limiting dissection 
within the temporalis fascia to avoid a postoperative motor 
palsy of the forehead. In addition, delayed facial nerve palsy 
due to traction or cautery near the genu of the facial nerve 
has been reported in several cases: risk of this injury may 
be minimized by limiting monopolar cauterization along 
the ﬂ oor of the temporal fossa. Treatment with steroids 
has led to complete resolution of delayed seventh nerve 
palsies. 
 Hemiparesis remains the most signiﬁ cant risk of medial 
temporal lobectomy. Resection within the insula and ma-
nipulation of middle cerebral arteries are well-recognized 
historic causes of postoperative hemiplegia, which are 
avoided by the standard resection discussed in this chapter. 
However, the risk of hemiplegia with AMTR does remain and 
may occur during medial dissection via damage to branches 
of either the anterior choroidal artery or the posterior cer-
ebral artery. The anterior choroidal artery lies within the 
ventricle, and is at particular risk if the choroid plexus is 
injured during dissection. Cauterization of the choroid may 
lead to thrombosis of the anterior choroidal artery and in-
farction within the internal capsule and lateral thalamus;

therefore, particular care should be taken to cover the ex-
posed choroid plexus with cottonoid pledgets (often secured 
under the tip of the retractor blade) at every opportunity to 
avoid accidental injury by suction or ultrasonic aspiration. 
Damage to the posterior cerebral artery can be avoided dur-
ing mobilization of the hippocampus by ensuring that the 
arterioles supplying the hippocampal ﬁ ssure and collateral 
sulcus are interrupted as far from the posterior cerebral ar-
tery as possible. Thalamoperforating arteries arising from 
the posterior cerebral artery are at risk during resection of 
the posterior hippocampus. Care to maintain the integrity 
of the arachnoid overlying the brain stem will safeguard 
these arteries. Finally, careful attention to the position of the 
retractor blades throughout the procedure will avoid undue 
pressure along the midbrain or thalamus, which could lead 
to an inadvertent plegia.

 Temporal Lobectomy 
 Allen R. Wyler 
 
 Patient Selection 
 Anterior temporal lobectomy is indicated for patients 
who continue to have complex partial seizures in spite of 
adequate trials with the major categories of antiepilep-
tic drugs, as administered by a neurologist specializing in 
epilepsy. 
 An appropriate preoperative evaluation should include 
(1) volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
including thin cuts through the temporal horns at right 
angles to the long axis of the ventricle to identify mesial 
temporal (or hippocampal) sclerosis; (2) long-term elec-
troencephalographic (EEG)/video monitoring to docu-
ment complex partial seizures; (3) a neuropsychological 
test battery with emphasis on assessing memory function; 
(4) although some epilepsy centers require an intracarotid 
Amytal (Wada) test to determine speech laterality and 
memory integrity, this is not necessary for every routine 
case; and (5) for patients without clear MRI evidence of 
unilateral hippocampal sclerosis correlative with ictal EEG 
localization, we require invasive monitoring to localize the 
focus. For this purpose I use subdural strip electrodes (Ad-
Tech Medical Instrument Corp., Racine, WI) in preference 
to depth electrodes. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 For surgeons who are not extremely experienced with the 
complex surgical anatomy of the mesial temporal region, 
neuronavigation is a useful aid. If employed, a gadolinium-
enhanced volumetric MRI is loaded onto the neuronaviga-
tion system preoperatively. 
 On the morning of surgery, 1 g of intravenous cepha-
losporin is given 1 hour before the incision is made. No 
further antibiotics are given. Because valproic acid can be 
associated with bleeding disorders, this medication is dis-
continued at least 3 weeks before surgery. The morning of 
surgery, the patient receives his or her other usual medica-
tions with a few sips of water. 
 Adults receive 10 mg Decadron (Dexamethasone) intrave-
nously 1 hour before surgery (the pediatric dose is appropri-
ately adjusted). Steroids are continued postoperatively for 
4 days. Steroids are tapered postoperatively with a Medrol 
(Methylprednisolone) dose pack. 
 Anesthesia 
 There is little objective evidence to validate the routine use 
of electrocorticography (ECoG) for patients with complex 
partial seizures of mesial temporal lobe origin. In fact, most 
of the evidence available (admittedly retrospective) argues 
that ECoG-guided resections do not yield results superior 
to standard resections. Thus I perform all routine tempo-
ral lobectomies with the patient under general anesthesia 
induced with intravenous thiopental (1–3 mg/kg) and fen-
tanyl (50–150 μg) in an average adult. A nondepolarizing 
muscle relaxant, pancuronium bromide (0.1–0.15 mg/kg), 
is given intravenously to facilitate endotracheal intuba-
tion. Isoﬂ urane in low concentrations (0.5–1.0% inspired) is 
administered. The proposed incision is inﬁ ltrated with 1% 
Lidocaine (epinephrine 1:100,000). Arterial pCO 2  is main-
tained at a level near 40 mm. Neither mannitol nor other 
diuretics are used. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Positioning 
 The patient is placed supine on an alternating air mattress 
with the head held in the Mayﬁ eld three-pin holder (Cod-
man, Inc., Raynham, MA)  ( Figs. 5.1 A and 5.1 B) . The sagittal 
and axial midlines of the head should angle 20 degrees and 
30 degrees, respectively, with the horizontal. The zygoma 
should be the highest point of the head. 
 Initial Exposure 
 A minimum of hair is shaved, only enough to make a 
standard curvilinear frontotemporal incision similar to the 
pterional approach to the circle of Willis  ( Fig. 5.1 C) . The 
temporalis muscle is incised directly beneath the skin and 
reﬂ ected with it. The bone ﬂ ap should be based low in the 
middle fossa, extending just above the sphenoid wing, but 
within the conﬁ nes of the fan of the temporalis muscle  ( Fig. 
5.1 D) . A rongeur or high-speed drill may be used to en-
large the bone opening toward the middle fossa ﬂ oor and 
anteriorly into the sphenoid wing for several centimeters 
 ( Fig. 5.2 A) . The dura can be opened by a cruciate incision to 
optimize temporal tip exposure and should extend  about 1

37
cm above the easily identiﬁ able sylvian ﬁ ssure  ( Figs. 5.2 B  
and 5.2 C) . 
 Temporal Resection 
 A distance of 4 cm from the temporal tip is measured along 
the middle temporal gyrus posteriorly from the sphenoid 
wing (  Fig. 5.3 A ). This will mark the posterior limit of the 
proposed lobectomy regardless of speech laterality. An inci-
sion is made in the sulcus between the superior and middle 
temporal gyri and carried mesially until the temporal ven-
tricular horn is entered  ( Figs. 5.3 B and 5.4 A) . A small cot-
ton pledget should be placed into the ventricle to maintain 
orientation  ( Figs. 5.3 C and 5.3 D) . 
 A Codman irrigating bipolar coagulator (Codman, Inc., 
Raynham, MA) and suction is used to remove the middle and 
inferior temporal gyri as one surgical specimen. The superior 
temporal gyrus is then removed; care is taken to use sub-
pial dissection technique and maintain an intact pia along 
the sylvian ﬁ ssure and basal temporal regions. The superior 
temporal gyrus is removed to the level of the ventricle, and 
then the amygdala is partially removed. The rest of the inferior 
temporal structures are removed piecemeal mesially until the 
parahippocampal gyrus is encountered. At this point, only the 
mesial temporal structures remain and the ependymal surface 
of the hippo campus should be easily identiﬁ ed  ( Fig. 5.4 B) . 
 Up to this point, the operation can proceed using loupe 
magniﬁ cation (3.5–4x). However, from this point on, visu-

an angle of 30 degrees to the long axis of the body, placing the zygoma

line of the head forms an angle of 20–30 degrees with the plane of the 
operating table. (C) A curvilinear scalp incision is made from anterior to 
the ear to midforehead, shaving only a minimum of hair and following 
just inside the hairline. (D) A small craniotomy is based underneath the 
fan of the temporalis muscle at the level of the temporal squamosa.

this, the parahippocampus and fusiform gyri are removed; the hippo-
campus is then removed as a separate surgical specimen. (C) Once the 
hippocampus is removed, the edge of the tentorium should be clearly 
viewed along with the third nerve, the peduncle, and the posterior cer-
ebral artery. The position of the choroid plexus is also noted.

Temporal Lobectomy

alization must be through an operating microscope. The 
hippocampus and uncus can now be removed en bloc for 
pathological examination. First, a cotton strip is applied 
down the sylvian ﬁ ssure into the ventricle to terminate at 
the choroidal ﬁ ssure. (Incorrect patient positioning at the 
beginning of the case will make identiﬁ cation of the choroi-
dal ﬁ ssure problematic.) This cottonoid is placed to hide and 
protect the choroid plexus and mesial superior structures. 
An incision is made along the choroidal ﬁ ssure from the 
level of the posterior boundary of the cerebral peduncle an-
teriorly until the tip is reached. This serves as the superior-
mesial margin of the resection. The posterior incision is then 
made at the level of the posterior margin of the cerebral pe-
duncle laterally to the lateral hippocampal margin, and then 
brought anteriorly and laterally until it meets the lateral 
resection margin. Microdissection techniques can now be 
used to carefully remove the hippocampus from the intact 
pial surface. As the hippocampus is rolled posteriorly, care 
is taken to coagulate and cut the numerous small vessels 
supplying the mesial temporal lobe arising from the poste-
rior communicating and cerebral arteries without damaging 
the vessels that supply the peduncle and thalamus (this is 
the cause of “traction hemiplegia” and hemianopsias.) To 
help orient the pathologist to the hippocampal long axis, I 
place a silver clip at each end of the specimen before remov-
ing it from the cranium. With the hippocampus removed, 
the pial bank overlying the tentorial incisura and cerebral 
peduncle should be intact  ( Fig. 5.4 C) . Below this barrier 
the surgeon should be able to view the cerebral peduncle, 
posterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, 
and third nerve. Pial bleeding should be carefully controlled 
with bipolar cautery. 
 The resection cavity is irrigated completely free of blood 
and the dura closed in a watertight manner. Dural tack-up 
sutures are secured and the bone ﬂ ap is sutured into place. 
I prefer to close muscle, fascia, and galea with 2–0 and 3–0 
Vicryl sutures. I close the skin with staples. A drain is not 
necessary. Blood loss should not exceed 300 cc. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The patient is moved to an intensive care unit for overnight 
observation unless a seizure monitoring room in the epi-
lepsy unit is available where he or she can be carefully mon-
itored. Should a rise in body temperature occur, an incentive 
spirometer is used. The Foley catheter and arterial lines are 
removed as soon as possible. The next morning, the patient 
is moved from the intensive care unit to a surgical ﬂ oor unit. 
The intravenous drip is converted to a heparin lock as soon 
as the patient is taking ﬂ uids. Ambulation and sitting in a 
chair are encouraged. Unless a problem arises, the patient 
is discharged on the third postoperative day. 
 If the patient is taking two anticonvulsive drugs, the least 
effective drug is tapered after 1 year. If seizure-free at 2 
years, the remaining drug is tapered. One seizure during or 
after the drug is withdrawn indicates that single-medica-
tion therapy needs to be resumed. 
 Hemiparesis 
 Hemiparesis usually occurs after damage (cauterization 
or tearing) of the small perforating vessels arising from 
the posterior communicating/cerebral vessels or anterior 
choroidal artery. Paralysis occurs immediately, and in most 
cases is permanent. Review of the earlier literature has indi-
cated that this occurred in about 5% of cases. This incidence 
can be minimized with careful technique and the use of the 
operating microscope for all mesial resections. 
 Visual Field Deﬁ cits 
 Patients may have a contralateral superior quadrant-anop-
sia from damage to the Meyer loop. The incidence can be 
minimized with minimal lateral cortical and maximal me-
dial resections. However, this rarely results in signiﬁ cant 
vocational disability. Homonymous hemianopsia can be 
caused by vascular damage to the geniculate body or op-
tic tract in much the same way as hemiparesis is caused. 
Again, this risk can be minimized with careful microsurgical 
technique. 
 Aseptic Meningitis 
 This complication will present from 72 hours to 1 week after 
surgery and will often surface after antiinﬂ ammatory drugs 
are withdrawn. Signs and symptoms of meningitis, includ-
ing elevated body temperature, stiff neck, severe headache, 
serious nausea, and lethargy, are present. This is a diagnosis 
of exclusion and can be made only after lumbar puncture 
shows cloudy, xanthrochromic cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) 
with negative cultures. 
 Operations particularly prone to this complication are 
ones in which the ventricular system is opened to the sub-
dural space. The incidence can be minimized by carefully 
irrigating blood from the resection site before closing the 
dura as tightly as possible so that CSF cannot freely com-
municate with the subgaleal space. 
 The treatment after this complication aims to minimize 
fever by using steroids. Drainage of CSF with a lumbar drain 
for 24 to 48 hours is also helpful, but increases the risk of 
infection. 
 Signiﬁ cance of Postoperative Seizures 
 Seizures that occur within the ﬁ rst 24 hours do not correlate 
with poor long-term outcome. However, when the patient 
has adequate antiseizure drug serum levels, seizures after 
48 hours indicate that the resection will fail to provide long-
term relief.

 Surgical Treatment of Extratemporal Epilepsy 
 Sheila Smitherman , Bharat Guthikonda, and  Daniel Yoshor 
     
Approximately 150,000 people develop epilepsy each year. 
Up to 25% of epileptics will fail medical treatment and will be 
diagnosed with medically intractable epilepsy. Extratempo-
ral resections are far outnumbered by temporal lobectomies 
or resections in the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Surgi-
cal management for extratemporal epilepsy has historically 
been more difﬁ cult than that for temporal lobe epilepsy and 
has had a lower rate of success. Nonetheless, several studies 
report cure rates (deﬁ ned as Engel Class I, seizure-free) in 
the range of 60–80% for extratemporal resections, which is 
a strong indicator of the utility of the procedure. 
 Extratemporal epilepsy often involves eloquent areas of 
the brain, and cortical excision in these areas may be as-
sociated with signiﬁ cant and unacceptable postoperative 
neurologic deﬁ cits. In recent years, the procedure of cortical 
resection has been increasingly replaced by lesionectomy 
for patients with epilepsy in association with a concordant 
and discrete lesion identiﬁ ed on imaging studies. The rea-
son for this is that neuroimaging techniques have become 
increasingly more reliable in identifying small tumors, 
structural abnormalities, and developmental defects in the 
area of primary epileptogenic zone. This has enabled the 
epilepsy surgeon to perform a lesionectomy instead of the 
less speciﬁ c corticectomy in the area of the epileptogenic 
focus. The term epileptogenic lesion includes congenital 
abnormalities such as cortical dysplasia; tumors; encepha-
lomalacia secondary to previous trauma; and vascular mal-
formations such as cavernomas and arteriovenous malfor-
mations. When a patient with a seizure disorder is found 
on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have a lesion, the 
epilepsy team needs to deﬁ ne the relationship of the radio-
graphically deﬁ ned lesion to the generation of seizures. Of-
ten this is poorly deﬁ ned, and a surgical strategy is difﬁ cult 
to produce. Several surgical approaches can be proposed: 
(1) lesionectomy (resect only the lesion); (2) resect lesion 
with margins; (3) resect lesion and distant epileptogenic 
focus; and (4) resect epileptogenic focus without resecting 
the lesion. 
 Lesional surgery is based on the assumption that a seizure 
disorder and the presence of a lesion are not coincidental. 
Attempts should be made to provide evidence that the pa-
tient’s seizures are caused by the radiographically identiﬁ ed 
lesion. Lesion location correlates well with seizure semiol-
ogy in some patients, which makes pure lesionectomy ap-
pear to be reasonable surgical option. Several studies, how-
ever, have demonstrated that only a fraction of patients with 
extratemporal epilepsy caused by a tumor or other lesion 
are seizure-free after lesionectomy alone. Furthermore, pa-
tients whose lesions are identiﬁ ed on radiographic studies 
and whose epilepsy has lasted less than one year are more 
likely to be seizure-free than those who have had epilepsy 
for longer than one year. 
 Patients with medically refractory seizures and lesions 
in or near the eloquent cortex should be considered for 
a staged approach featuring initial implantation of intra-
cranial electrodes and resection of the epileptogenic area 
suggested by the initial monitoring. Alternatively, a patient 
with a lesion in or near eloquent areas can be treated in 
a single operation with intraoperative cortical mapping to 
deﬁ ne cortical eloquence, and a resection based on the ana-
tomic lesion with or without additional tailoring based on 
intraoperative electrocorticography. Epileptic areas in criti-
cally eloquent cortex may be treated with multiple subpial 
transections (MSTs). 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Extratemporal epilepsy is a heterogeneous group of epi-
lepsy disorders that are often more difﬁ cult to characterize 
than temporal lobe epilepsy. Tools that have aided in the 
preoperative assessment include electroencephalography 
(EEG), computed tomography (CT), MRI (with and without 
contrast), single photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). These have 
all been used with varying degrees of success to delineate 
the area of epileptogenicity. 
 Since the advent of MRI, lesions such as benign and ma-
lignant neoplasms, cortical dysplasia, vascular malforma-
tions, and posttraumatic brain injury have been seen and 
characterized with better accuracy than CT could provide 
previously. Some patients with extratemporal epilepsy can 
avoid invasive monitoring if a structural abnormality or le-
sion is seen on MRI. 
 Epilepsy can be controlled surgically only if the epilep-
togenic zone can be accurately identiﬁ ed. Surface EEG is 
the main tool for noninvasive identiﬁ cation and characteri-
zation of epileptogenic foci. It is usually performed in the 
hospital over a period of 1–2 weeks in the epilepsy center, 
where the patient can be video monitored 24 hours a day. 

 
6 
Surgical Treatment of Extratemporal Epilepsy 
43
The patient’s antiepileptic drug doses are reduced in an ef-
fort to provoke seizures during the monitoring period. 
 If the MRI and EEG do not provide enough information 
for the surgeon, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan 
may provide enough additional information to locate the 
focus. A PET scan demonstrates the metabolic activity of the 
brain. In an interictal PET scan, there is decreased metabolic 
activity in the region of epileptogenicity. During seizure ac-
tivity, the focus demonstrates increased metabolism. It is 
most reliable in identifying temporal lobe seizure foci and 
least reliable in localizing extratemporal, nonlesional foci. 
 SPECT is useful in both the ictal and interictal periods. 
Ictal SPECT studies can be obtained only if the radioisotope 
is injected within seconds of a seizure onset. The isotope 
is concentrated in the region of seizure onset. Sequential 
imaging studies can be obtained up to several hours after 
injection to demonstrate the area of ictal onset. 
 Despite the advances in imaging, a subset of patients re-
quires invasive monitoring to better deﬁ ne or characterize 
the epileptogenic zone. In cases of extratemporal epilepsy, 
surface EEG with video monitoring often does not provide 
speciﬁ c enough localization for a surgical plan to be de-
vised. For these patients, subdural grid and strip electrodes 
and depth electrodes are used to gather additional informa-
tion. 
 The major advantage of subdural electrodes over depth 
electrodes is that they do not penetrate cerebral tissue and 
can record from a wide area of the cortical surface. They can 
also be used for extraoperative cortical stimulation to map 
out functional areas of the brain. 
 Subdural grids and strips have ﬂ at metal (either stainless 
steel or titanium) contact points mounted in clear ﬂ exible 
Silastic  ( Fig. 6.1 ) . The transparency of the plastic allows the 
underlying cortex to be easily visualized, enabling the sur-
geon to ensure cortical veins or other important structures 
are not excessively compressed or damaged by the elec-
trode array. Grids are commercially available in a variety of 
dimensions from 16 contact points up to 64 contact points. 
They can also be customized to provide adequate coverage 
for a speciﬁ c case. Grids are used in cases where the epi-
leptogenic focus is poorly localized with surface EEG or if a 
large area of cortex needs to be monitored. Subdural strips 
are useful to evaluate less accessible cortical surfaces such 
as the orbital frontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus. 
 Depth electrodes are made of thin ﬂ exible plastic and 
have multiple contact points. They are often used in com-
bination with subdural electrode arrays for completeness. 
For the workup of extratemporal epilepsy, depth electrodes 
are used in the orbital-frontal area to better characterize 
seizures in the frontal lobe. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Grid Placement 
 Subdural grids must be placed via a craniotomy ﬂ ap, so 
grids are usually placed only unilaterally  ( Fig. 6.2 ) . Their 
use is indicated when the epileptogenic zone is large or 
poorly deﬁ ned, and require a large surface area of cortex to 
be monitored. The patient is positioned on the operating 
table as for a standard craniotomy; the area of the head to 
be operated on is shaved and exposed in the surgical ﬁ eld. 
The patient is then prepped and draped as for a standard 
craniotomy. The patient should receive a dose of antibiotics 
before the skin incision. Subdural strips may be placed via 
a bur hole in the area to be monitored. Several (usually two 
or three) strips can be placed through the same bur hole. 
This enables the surgeon to place each strip into a separate 
area in the subdural space. For subdural strips and grids, 
the electrode wires then must be tunneled out under the 
scalp via a separate stab incision several centimeters away, 
preferably at least 5 cm  ( Fig. 6.2 ) . Tunneling the electrodes 
reduces the potential for infection while the electrodes re-
main implanted. Most patients keep the grids or strips for 
1–3 weeks. Throughout the entire monitoring period, the 
patient should receive prophylactic antibiotics. The compli-
cations most commonly seen are intracranial hemorrhage 
and infection. Most authors describe complication rates of 
4–6% with the placement of large grids. 
 To place a subdural grid, a generous bone ﬂ ap is typi-
cally elevated. It is useful to employ an osteoplastic ﬂ ap, 
one with muscle attached because this provides a lasting 
blood supply to the bone ﬂ ap and thereby reduces the risk 
of postoperative infection. When placing the grids on the 
brain convexity, there are several important points to re-
member. The edge of a grid should not overlie the larger 
draining veins such that compression of the vein could lead 
to compromised venous drainage, venous engorgement, or 
Fig. 6.1    Subdural strip electrode arrays and grid electrode arrays are 
available in a variety of dimensions. Multiple strips and grids are often 
used for adequate coverage of the area of interest.

thrombosis. In addition, when using more than one grid or a 
combination of grids and strips, the edges should overlap. If 
there is a small space between the two, cortical lacerations 
can result or herniation of brain tissue through the space 
can occur. One way to ensure the maintenance of overlap-
ping edges is to suture the edges together before placing 
them over the convexity of the brain  ( Fig. 6.2 ) . Once this is 
done, intraoperative photographs should be taken to serve 
as references during the monitoring period. 
 Before closing the dura, the electrode array should be an-
chored to the dura in several areas with a dural suture to 
prevent it from shifting during closure or in the postopera-
tive period while the patient is being monitored. The bur 
holes made for the bone ﬂ ap are used as exit holes in the 
skull for the electrodes, so it is helpful not to cover the bur 
holes with a plate when plating the bone ﬂ ap for closure. 
One problem that is encountered with long term invasive 
monitoring with subdural electrodes is cerebrospinal ﬂ uid 
leakage. Some recommend placing bone dust in the bur 
holes to minimize leakage, then gluing the dust. We favor 
the application of a thin layer of collodium on the electrode 
tail exit sites. 
 A series of anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays should be 
taken immediately postoperatively, as well as several days 
after the electrodes are placed to monitor their movement 
during seizure activity. In addition, a volumetric CT scan is 
taken and merged with the preoperative MRI to allow pre-
cise identiﬁ cation of electrode positions. 
 Once the electrodes are placed, the patient can be moni-
tored for seizure activity in the hospital’s epilepsy study 
unit. This is often done in conjunction with the patient re-
ducing or stopping the antiepileptic drugs. Furthermore, 
extraoperative functional mapping in the conscious patient 
by stimulating the strips and grids can assist in the surgi-
cal planning by deﬁ ning the borders of eloquent areas. The 
most frequent areas of interest are the Broca area, Wernicke 
area, the motor strip and the somatosensory area of the 
parietal lobe. 
 The extent of resection in cases of extratemporal epilepsy 
is less clearly deﬁ ned than for temporal epilepsy. When the 
preoperative assessment points to a particular extratempo-
ral lobe as the focus of epileptogenicity, cortical excision is 
planned. 
 Cortical Resection 
 The frontal lobe is the most frequent location of the 
extratemporal epilepsies. These patients can have a complex 
array of seizure manifestations. Frontal lobe seizures are 
usually of brief duration; they tend to occur at night, have a 
sudden onset, and have no or minimal postictal confusion. 
Seizures originating in the supplementary motor area are 
often characterized by complex tonic posturing without loss 
of consciousness (elevation of contralateral shoulder, elbow 
ﬂ exion, arm abduction); speech arrest is also common with 
seizures in this area. Cingulate gyrus seizures are described 
as absence or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, also mani-
festing limbic automatisms (such as vocalization or urinary 
incontinence). Other authors describe epileptic attacks of 
frontal lobe origin as commencing in several ways. Loss of 
consciousness and turning the head to the contralateral side 
are frequent initial manifestations. The patients frequently 
suffer generalized tonic-clonic seizures after this. 
 The patient is positioned supine on the operating table 
with the head in standard three-point ﬁ xation. If intraop-
erative electrocorticography is to be used for speech and 
motor mapping, local anesthesia is used if the patient can 
tolerate the procedure and participate in the intraoperative 
tests. The patient is prepped and draped as for a standard 
craniotomy. Frontal lobe excisions usually require a large 
craniotomy ﬂ ap for adequate exposure of the motor strip 
and Broca area, which will be evaluated carefully with in-
traoperative electrocorticography. The entire thickness of a 
gyrus must be resected for successful treatment. 
 For total frontal lobectomies, the superior, middle, and 
inferior frontal gyri over the lateral convexity should be re-
sected en bloc. Large frontal resections can be safely per-
formed in the nondominant hemisphere. If the resection is 
being performed on the dominant hemisphere, the resec-
tion should stop halfway down the middle frontal gyrus. 
The posterior 2.5 cm of the inferior frontal gyrus is generally 
left intact to avoid disturbances in speech function, unless 
language mapping suggests that a resection will be well 
tolerated. The patient’s speech is repeatedly tested with 
visual cues while the cortex is repetitively stimulated. Lan-
guage cortex is identiﬁ ed and mapped when dysphasia or 
frank speech arrest occurs. The mapping continues during 
the resection to minimize risk of damaging the patient’s 
speech function. Care should be taken to avoid precipitating 
a seizure during stimulation for mapping purposes. Ice cold 
irrigation should be readily available in case a seizure occurs 
Fig. 6.2  A large craniotomy ﬂ ap is required to allow for multiple grid 
placement. The electrodes exit the bur holes made for the craniotomy 
and the electrodes are tunneled out through separate stab incisions in 
the scalp to reduce the risk of infection.

Surgical Treatment of Extratemporal Epilepsy

intraoperatively. The surgeon can use a syringe with a ﬂ ex-
ible plastic catheter on the end to gently drip on the stimu-
lated area to halt the seizure activity. Even with the most 
cautious intraoperative speech monitoring, the patient may 
develop a postoperative dysphasia. This can be transient and 
should improve during the postoperative course. 
 Anterior-frontal excisions, or frontal pole excisions, are 
usually performed for patients who have posttraumatic 
epilepsy secondary to previous frontal lobe contusions or 
cortical dysplasia in the orbital frontal cortex. The frontal 
pole can be safely resected en bloc. 
 Medial frontal resections can be performed by remov-
ing the cingulate gyrus over the corpus callosum. Extreme 
caution must be used with regard to venous drainage; it 
is ideal to have venous drainage to sylvian veins to com-
pensate for any frontal venous drainage that is sacriﬁ ced. 
Transient postoperative dysphasia after frontal lobectomy 
can be attributed to venous occlusions when the superior 
sagittal sinus, rather than sylvian veins, was the recipient 
vein of drainage. 
 Seizures originating in the perirolandic cortex are difﬁ -
cult to treat surgically. The central lobule is traditionally 
considered an inoperable region because of unacceptable 
postoperative neurologic deﬁ cits. These patients can have 
somatomotor seizures, somatosensory seizures, or both. The 
lower central areas of the pre- and postcentral gyri can be 
resected if focal motor or sensory seizures are the patient’s 
predominant symptoms. The resection should extend su-
periorly 2.5–3 cm above the sylvian ﬁ ssure. Extensive intra-
operative mapping of lip, tongue, and hand function is criti-
cal in this operation to minimize postoperative neurologic 
morbidity. Patients who already have neurologic deﬁ cits in 
the limb near the area of interest can have a more aggressive 
resection performed because the risk of damaging normal 
functional cortex is lower. 
 The ideal patient for epilepsy surgery in the perirolandic 
cortex is the young child because of the potential for recov-
ery of motor function with neuronal plasticity. The age at 
which neuronal plasticity and recovery of function is possi-
ble is not clearly deﬁ ned, but children younger than 7 years 
have recovered function well. The resection is performed 
with an ultrasonic aspirator on low suction and low vibra-
tion amplitude to leave the surrounding pia, especially the 
upper bank of the insula, intact. 
 Isolated parietal lobe epilepsy is uncommon. It is often 
seen in association with structural or neoplastic lesions. 
Seizures can manifest as contralateral, or occasionally bi-
lateral, sensations incorporating all sensory modalities. 
Most patients with epilepsy originating in the parietal lobe 
have no signs or symptoms suggestive of this location. If 
the patient does have symptoms, lateralized ictal paresthe-
sias—tingling, numbness, prickling or “electric shock” sen-
sations in the arms or face—are sometimes described by 
these patients. Resections in the parietal region must follow 
meticulous mapping of the postcentral gyrus. Dominant 
hemisphere cortical resection should be performed un-
der local anesthesia if possible with careful intraoperative 
electrocorticography to avoid severe postoperative sensory 
deﬁ cits. Nondominant hemisphere parietal resections can 
be performed with less concern for proprioceptive deﬁ cits 
or apraxias as long as the postcentral gyrus is left intact. 
Partial visual ﬁ eld deﬁ cits should be expected when either 
side is resected. 
 Occipital epilepsy is uncommon, and is associated with 
structural or neoplastic lesions. Ictal activity can be pro-
voked by stimuli involving the receptive function of the 
parietal and occipital lobes. The most common source is 
photic stimuli. Ictal discharges originating in the occipital 
lobe or the parieto-occipital junction are characterized by 
visual phenomena such as seeing ﬂ ashes of light or colors or 
amaurosis described as pure blackout or whiteout. Seizures 
can spread rapidly and manifest as motor activity or lan-
guage dysfunction, which can be misleading in suggesting 
a different area of epileptogenicity. 
 The occipital lobe is resected with the patient in the prone 
position  ( Figs. 6.3 and 6.4 )  and awake; the surgery should 
be performed with electrocorticography to minimize visual 
loss secondary to the resection. Intraoperative evoked po-
tentials are also useful to identify the borders of the visual 
cortex. Unfortunately, successful outcomes after occipital 
resections are rarer than with frontal lobe resections. 
 Aims of Surgery 
 The goal of neurosurgical intervention for uncontrolled sei-
zures is to render the patient seizure-free without causing 
neurologic deﬁ cits and to reduce antiepileptic drug toxic-
ity. When determining a patient’s candidacy for epilepsy 
surgery, one must review the patient’s medication history 
and demonstrate failure to control seizures despite the use 
of at least two ﬁ rst line drugs at maximally tolerated doses 
for 2 years.

 Multiple Subpial Transection 
 MST is one of the newer surgical techniques designed for 
use in patients in whom the epileptogenic zone resides in 
or encroaches on eloquent cortex. It was developed by Frank 
Morrell and his colleagues out of the desire to provide a 
surgical option for patients who had epileptic foci in ar-
eas thought of as inoperable because resecting these areas 
would produce unacceptable neurologic deﬁ cits: pre- and 
postcentral gyrus, Broca area, and Wernicke area. The pro-
cedure’s function is based on studies that revealed the func-
tional unit of the cerebral cortex was a vertically oriented 
column. Another key factor is that disrupting the horizon-
tally oriented ﬁ bers in the cerebral cortex does not elimi-
nate the physiologic function of that cortical area. In addi-
tion, this horizontal connection and conduction of electrical 
activity are essential for the development of discharges that 
lead to epilepsy. Furthermore, a volume of synchronously 
ﬁ ring cerebral cortex of 12–25 mm 2  is necessary to produce 
an epileptic spike. 
 Morrell devised this orientation-selective lesion to reduce 
synchronized cell discharge without impairing the function 
of the cells in the region and minimize unacceptable neu-
rologic morbidity. The rationale was to leave the vertical col-
umnar arrangement of the cortical cells intact but to disrupt 
the recruitment of neural tissue required to produce a sei-
zure  ( Fig. 6.5 ) . This is achieved by using a small transector to 
place small cuts  ( Fig. 6.6 )  that are perpendicular to the pial 
surface, 5 mm apart from each other. This technique leaves 
the vertical columnar arrangement of the cortex intact and 
preserves function, but prevents the seizure discharge from 
spreading in the horizontal plane to reduce seizures. It is 
common for some neurologic deﬁ cits to appear postopera-
tively, but these generally resolve over several weeks with 
satisfactory improvement in seizure control. 
 The patient is placed under general anesthesia on the op-
erating table. The head is shaved, prepped, and draped as 
for a standard craniotomy procedure. Once the cerebral cor-
tex has been mapped with electrocorticography  ( Fig. 6.7 ) , 
transection can begin. The subpial transector is an instru-
ment that has a steel wire whose end is ﬂ attened and turned 
up at either a 90-degree or 105-degree angle  ( Fig. 6.6 ) . The 
obtuse angle makes hooking and damaging cortical vessels 
less likely. The hook is rounded on the end. The wire must 
be malleable enough to orient its tip with respect to the 
Fig. 6.4 The skin incision is a generous hockey-stick incision to allow 
for adequate exposure and intraoperative monitoring. Note the rela-
tionship of the incision to anatomic landmarks such as the inion exter-
nally and the sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses.       
 Fig. 6.5 Disruption of the horizontal nerve ﬁ bers with the subpial 
transector. Note the depth of the hook is ~4mm, just above the white 
matter. The gray matter consists of the molecular layer most superﬁ -
cially, followed by the granular, pyramidal, and multiform layers. The 
vertical columnar organization is preserved by maintaining the hook of 
the transector perpendicular to the gyral surface. The horizontal ﬁ bers 
are disrupted at intervals of 5 mm to halt the seizure activity. 
 
Fig. 6.6 Subpial transectors. Several variations of this instrument are 
commercially available. Key features of the instrument are the ﬂ at han-
dle that is used to help the surgeon to maintain the hook in a perpen-
dicular orientation relative to the gyral surface. The wire shaft of the 
instrument should be ﬂ exible enough to provide angular variation, as 
different gyri need to be accessed for transection.

handle and allow different gyri to be accessed easily. Several 
models of subpial transectors are commercially available. 
The differences in their design lie in the angle of the wire 
with respect to the handle of the instrument. This facilitates 
access to gyri that would otherwise be difﬁ cult to reach and 
transect with a straight wire and handle. 
 Transection begins with making a small hole in the pia. 
Morrell suggests using the sharp tip of a number 11 blade, 
but more recent authors describe the ease with which a 
20- or 25-gauge needle breaches the pial membrane. The 
nick in the pia should be made in a relatively avascular area 
of the cortex, and as near a sulcus as possible. Maintaining 
as few breaches in the pia as possible is important to pre-
vent fibroblast invasion at the puncture site, thus reduc-
ing subsequent scarring. The foot plate of the transector 
is introduced into the hole and swept forward, arcing the 
hook underneath the pia of the gyrus. The foot plate of the 
transector must be maintained perpendicular to the pial 
surface (in a vertical orientation) to avoid damage to the 
vertical columnar organization of the cortex. The transec-
tor has a triangular shaped handle with the flat part of it 
oriented such that it rests on the surgeon’s hand when the 
hook of the transector is vertically oriented. This gives the 
surgeon tactile feedback to help maintain the correct orien-
tation of the hook through the transection, while the hook 
is partially out of view. The surgeon slides the transector 
across the gyrus to the far side, then elevates it so the tip 
of the hook is visible below the pia but does not penetrate 
it. The hook is then gently drawn back toward the entry 
point in the pia. Care must be taken to visualize the tip 
below the pia through the entire transection. Resistance 
while advancing the hook can indicate that a deep vessel 
is caught on the hook. If this occurs, the surgeon must 
carefully backtrack a small distance then re-advance the 
hook at a slightly different orientation. This avoids tear-
ing the larger vessels, which would produce brisk bleed-
ing. There will be a small amount of bleeding from surface 
capillaries, but this should not obscure the view. It can be 
controlled by gentle application of Gelfoam over the area. 
The small red stripes of the capillary bleeding can serve 
as a landmark from which the 5 mm distance for the next 
transection can be measured  ( Fig. 6.8 ) . If more than just a 
small amount of blood seeps into the subarachnoid space, 
subarachnoid blood can spread and obscure the view for 
accurate measurement of the 5 mm intervals. Thus several 
authors suggest starting at the lower gyri and working su-
periorly. 
 The transections are repeated until the epileptogenic fo-
cus is eliminated. This may mean that several transections 
are made in more than one gyrus. Intraoperative electro-
cortography is an essential adjunct to this procedure to dic-
tate to the surgeon when a enough transections have been 
performed to eliminate the seizure focus. Persistent spikes 
can be seen on EEG after subpial transection. Despite the 
abnormal electrical activity, symptoms often improve. Over 
time, the electrical activity may disappear altogether.

highlighted electrodes in this grid indicate the area of epileptogenic-
ity. Magniﬁ ed below: A 20G spinal needle is used to puncture the pial 
surface. The transector is introduced in this opening, directed to the 
far side of the gyrus, tilted up to the pial surface until the tip of the 
hook is seen but does not penetrate the pia, and gently drawn back 
to produce the transection. The transected areas often leave a red 
stripe where capillary bleeding results. These serve as a landmark from 
which the 5 mm distance can be measured.

 Postoperative Management Including 
Complications 
 The four areas for which MST is most commonly used have 
their own associated complications. Patients with epilep-
togenic foci in the precentral gyrus can develop upper motor 
neuron signs such as hyperreﬂ exia, spasticity, and increased 
muscle tone contralaterally following MST. Furthermore, 
they can develop weakness in the contralateral face, arm, or 
leg. More subtle neurologic morbidities include impairment 
of skilled movements seen on careful neurologic examina-
tion. Foci that are in the postcentral gyrus can have postop-
erative sensory problems after MST. There can be deﬁ cits in 
stereognosis, graphesthesia, two-point discrimination, and 
ﬁ ne, rapid skilled movements. When MST is performed in 
the Broca area, postoperative deﬁ cits can include impair-
ment in writing or copying, and in verbal ﬂ uency. When 
MST is performed in the Wernicke area, speaking, writing, 
reception of speech, reading, copying written words, nam-
ing, and word ﬁ nding can be affected. Further injuries that 
result in long-term neurologic morbidity include damage to 
larger vessels that result in intraparenchymal hemorrhages. 
These hemorrhages can become cystic areas that can be 
seen on MRI. Whether these areas later cause persistent or 
recurrent seizure activity is not known. 
 Although MST is a relatively new mode of therapy for 
medically intractable epilepsy with foci in eloquent cortex, 
some results are promising. Some authors report about 80% 
of patients with a good outcome (deﬁ ned as Engel classiﬁ ca-
tion I-III: seizure-free, rare seizures—2 per year, or 90% re-
duction). Some patients who fail MST surgery are frequently 
later diagnosed with Rasmussen’s encephalitis. MST can 
temporarily relieve (or even eliminate) seizures in these 
patients, but the cortical tissue that was not transected 
later becomes involved with this progressive encephalitis. 
However, some reports of long-term follow-up reveal poor 
epilepsy control with MST. These authors describe a prefer-
ence for selective resection of relatively eloquent cortex and 
leaving intact absolutely eloquent cortex. 
 Extratemporal resection for patients with medically in-
tractable seizures is a safe and effective treatment. Seizure-
free outcomes are described in approximately two thirds 
of patients and mortality is very low in all of the recent 
literature. Morbidity is usually what was expected preop-
eratively based on the primary epileptogenic zone identiﬁ ed 
with MRI, SPECT, surface EEG, and, in some cases, subdural 
electrodes. Successful outcomes depend somewhat on the 
site of origin of the epileptogenic focus and site of surgical 
involvement. Overall, surgical treatment of extratemporal 
epilepsy has a lower success rate than that for temporal 
epilepsy, and surgical management of frontal lobe epilepsy 
is the most successful surgery for lobar epilepsy foci.

 Anatomical Hemispherectomy 
 Atthaporn Boongird and William E. Bingaman 
 
  Anatomical hemispherectomy is an effective surgical treat-
ment of intractable hemispheric epilepsy. First introduced 
by Dandy in 1923 for malignant glioma, the operation has 
been modiﬁ ed by various authors to reduce the compli-
cations that are sometimes associated with anatomical 
hemispherectomy. Despite these modiﬁ cations and reports 
of complications, the anatomical removal of a diseased 
hemisphere remains useful for certain pathologies such as 
hemimegalencephaly and diffuse malformations of cortical 
development, and in reoperation after other disconnective 
hemispherectomy techniques have failed. 
 Patient Selection and Preoperative 
Evaluation 
 Patients are selected based on the presence of medically 
intractable epilepsy arising from one cerebral hemisphere. 
Patients with hemimegalencephaly or diffuse hemispheric 
malformations of cortical development usually have mal-
formed gyral anatomy, abnormal white matter, and hetero-
topic deep gray matter. Often, the malformation of corti-
cal development extends to the ventricle and may involve 
the basal ganglia with absence of the normal white matter 
anatomy routinely followed during disconnective hemi-
spherectomy techniques. At our center, anatomic removal 
of the affected tissue is preferred over disconnection to help 
ensure seizure activity ceases completely. The other indica-
tion for anatomical hemispherectomy is the postoperative 
functional hemispherectomy patient who has recurrent 
seizures. For these patients, anatomic removal of the re-
maining hemisphere stops seizures in about 50% of patients 
(personal series). 
 Preoperatively, a team of specialists, including adult and 
pediatric epileptologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, 
and neuropsychologists, evaluates these patients. The rou-
tine preoperative evaluation to determine surgical candi-
dacy follows: 
 1.  History and physical examination —A detailed history, 
including prenatal events, birth history, and epilepsy risk 
factors, is elicited. Developmental history is also impor-
tant. The neurologic examination focuses on sensorimo-
tor, language, and visual functions. Cognitive function 
should be generally assessed. The ideal hemispherectomy 
candidate has a contralateral hemiparesis and hemianop-
sia without ﬁ ne ﬁ nger movements. The degree of motor 
impairment needs to be accurately documented to help 
counsel the parents on what to expect postoperatively. 
Similarly, the presence or absence of a hemianopsia 
should be assessed and parents need to be counseled 
about the presence of a contralateral hemianopsia post-
operatively. This speciﬁ c visual ﬁ eld deﬁ cit will preclude 
driving later in life. Any associated medical illness or 
syndrome such as epidermal nevus syndrome should be 
documented. 
 2.  Clinical semiology and video electroencephalography 
(VEEG)— All patients have preoperative VEEG monitoring 
to document seizure semiology and interictal and ictal 
electroencephalographic (EEG) data. The seizure type and 
location of epileptic events are documented and charac-
terized. EEG ﬁ ndings can be variable with lateralization 
to the ipsilateral diseased hemisphere or in a bilateral or 
generalized pattern. Although not an absolute contraindi-
cation, the evidence of independent bilateral hemispheric 
ictal patterns may inﬂ uence postoperative seizure out-
come and parents should be counseled appropriately.  
 3.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)— Routine MRI, in-
cluding volumetric T1, T2, and FLAIR sequencing, is per-
formed in all patients. This is perhaps the most impor-
tant preoperative data because the individual anatomy 
helps determine the operative technique and documents 
the integrity of the unaffected hemisphere. Patients with 
bilateral imaging pathology are not necessarily excluded 
from consideration for hemispherectomy, but caution 
should be exercised in these circumstances. Speciﬁ c 
anatomical details involving ventricular size, presence of 
heterotopic cortical dysplasia, the anatomy of the poste-
rior basal frontal cortex, and location of the midline help 
to deﬁ ne the surgical plan. 
 4.    Other adjunctive preoperative tests— Single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 18-ﬂ uoro-
deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) 
scanning are infrequently performed to glean additional 
metabolic information, especially if bilateral disease 
is present on MRI. The intracarotid sodium amytal test 
is not routinely performed because of pediatric age 
considerations and poor baseline language function in 
some patients. It may be of use in older patients who 
may not experience language transfer after dominant 

50

Epilepsy
hemispherectomy. Finally, neuropsychological evaluation 
should be attempted to help gauge developmental delay 
and establish the preoperative baseline. Any associated 
behavioral problems should also be documented. 
 Timing of Surgery 
 The appropriate timing of surgical intervention is contro-
versial. Many experienced epileptologists recommend early 
intervention to stop seizures and maximize chances for neu-
rodevelopment. Nevertheless, the literature shows little evi-
dence to support early surgery, and the risks of the surgical 
procedure (blood loss, hypothermia) in younger patients 
needs to be considered. Generally, for less severe epilepsy 
we consider a body weight of 10 kg as acceptable to undergo 
the procedure. All patients and families are asked to donate 
red blood cells and plasma before the operation. For the 
patient with catastrophic hemispheric epilepsy, surgery is 
performed earlier with informed consent on the risks of 
excessive blood loss and mortality. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should be taken on the morn-
ing of surgery and intravenous AEDs administered during 
surgery as necessary. Preoperative laboratory evaluation, 
including complete blood count, platelet count, chemis-
try panel, coagulation proﬁ les, and current AED levels, are 
checked before surgery. Intravenous steroids and antibiot-
ics are administered during the hour before the operation. 
Immediately before the surgery, the patient is identiﬁ ed by 
the surgical, nursing, and anesthesia teams and the type and 
location of the procedure are reviewed and documented. 
An indwelling arterial line, a bladder catheter, and intrave-
nous catheterization via peripheral and central venous can-
nulas are placed after endotracheal anesthesia is induced. 
The body temperature is kept at or above 36°C by warming 
the room and the application of warming blankets. Neu-
romuscular blockade, narcotics, and inhalational agents are 
routinely used for general anesthesia since electrocorticog-
raphy and cortical stimulation are not routinely used during 
surgery. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Positioning and Craniotomy 
 Patient positioning is optimized to allow access to the lat-
eral surface of the affected cerebral hemisphere and to mini-
mize neck torsion. The head may be positioned in rigid point 
ﬁ xation or resting on a head support. The head is positioned 
with a 90 degree lateral turn with ipsilateral shoulder sup-
port. The head is elevated above the level of the heart to 
assist with venous return and reduce risk of bleeding. The 
vertex is slightly down to allow access to the mesial tempo-
ral lobe structures and interhemispheric ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 7.1 ) . 
The body pressure points are padded and the patient cov-
ered with warming blankets. The head is then shaved and 
a T-shaped incision planned to allow access from the ﬂ oor 
of the middle fossa to the midline of the head. Superﬁ cial 
landmarks useful for incisional planning include anatomic 
midline from nasion to inion, the lateral edge of the anterior 
fontanelle, transverse sinus location, the greater wing of the 
sphenoid bone, and the zygomatic arch  ( Fig. 7.2 ) . 
 The T incision is designed by a line at least 0.5 cm from 
midline and a perpendicular line from the zygomatic root 
just anterior to the tragus. The midline incision extends 
from the hairline to a point 4–5 cm above the inion. The 
scalp is prepared with a sterile Betadine (povodine-iodine) 
surgical scrub and paint technique with care to avoid al-
lowing Betadine solution into the eyes. A wide surgical 
prep area is performed to allow postoperative drains to be 
tunneled subcutaneously. After subcutaneous injection of 
0.5% Lidocaine with 1:200,000 diluted epinephrine dosed 
according to individual body weight, the incision is made 
with a surgical scalpel with care in the younger patient with 
an open anterior fontanelle to avoid sagittal sinus injury. All 
bleeding points must be carefully controlled with bipolar

spherectomy.

electrocautery and small hemostatic clips are then applied 
to the skin edges. The skin edges are then reﬂ ected and peri-
osteum and temporalis muscle fascia visualized. The muscle 
is mobilized off the underlying bone with a T incision, re-
ﬂ ecting each muscle cuff inferiorly. The zygomatic root and 
anatomic keyhole are identiﬁ ed. If applicable, the coronal 
suture should be gently separated from the dura starting 
from the lateral edge of the anterior fontanelle. Bur holes 
are made at the keyhole, the ﬂ oor of the middle fossa just 
above the zygomatic arch, and lastly along the parasagittal 
areas just off the midline to avoid sagittal sinus injury (if the 
anterior fontanelle is closed). The optimal craniotomy ﬂ ap 
allows exposure to the midline, orbitofrontal base, ﬂ oor of 
the middle fossa, and total length of the sylvian ﬁ ssure. The 
craniotomy ﬂ ap is carefully removed with a high-speed air 
drill craniotome. The midline cut should be made last and 
kept 1 cm away from the sagittal suture to minimize blood 
loss and sinus injury. A smaller straight drill bit is used 
for making dural tack up stitches. The dura is then tacked 
up to the overlying bone using 4–0 Neurolon sutures. The 
sphenoid wing is then partially removed and hemostasis 
achieved with bone wax. All inferior temporal bone surfaces 
are carefully inspected for exposed mastoid air cells, which 
are then waxed. 
 Dural Opening and Initial Brain Exposure 
 After the dura mater is opened in an H-fashion  ( Fig. 7.3) , 
the sylvian ﬁ ssure is identiﬁ ed and venous drainage pat-
terns inspected. The distance from the superior craniotomy 
edge to the interhemispheric ﬁ ssure is veriﬁ ed. The location 
of major draining veins to the sagittal sinus are noted and 
carefully protected until later in the procedure to avoid early 
and often devastating blood loss. The orbitofrontal region 
is inspected and the position of the olfactory tract visual-
ized as an anatomic guide to the gyrus rectus and midline 
structures. 
 Sylvian Fissure Dissection 
 The dissection begins with early exposure and control of 
the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk in the sylvian ﬁ s-
sure just distal to the lentriculostriate branches. The sylvian 
ﬁ ssure is split along its entire length by using bipolar elec-
trocautery, suction, and sharp microdissection (loupe mag-

niﬁ cation is preferred for this portion of the procedure)  ( Fig. 
7.4 ) . This should be done carefully to minimize bleeding, 
but cortex can be aspirated as necessary to aid in exposure. 
Once opened, the insular cortex including the inferior and 
superior circular sulci should be visualized along the length 
of the sylvian ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 7.5 ) . The MCA is then ligated with 
bipolar cautery and surgical hemostatic clips. 
 Infrasylvian Dissection and Ventricular Access 
 The inferior circular sulcus is identiﬁ ed and the white mat-
ter of the temporal stem is identiﬁ ed just deep to this. Using 
suction aspiration, the white matter is removed along the 
temporal stem and the temporal horn of the lateral ventri-
cle is entered. A cottonoid patty is placed here to protect 
the choroid plexus and prevent blood from entering the 
ventricular system. The pial dissection along the anterior 
(temporal) aspect of the sylvian ﬁ ssure is carried below the 
main sylvian vein to the ﬂ oor of the anterior aspect of the 
middle fossa. The anterior temporal pole is then aspirated 
to expose the edge of the tentorium with care not to violate 
the mesial pia. The white matter dissection of the temporal 
stem is then continued posteriorly to expose the temporal 
horn from the anterior aspect to the trigonal region  ( Fig. 
7.6 ) . A long, thin cottonoid is then placed posteriorly into 
the ventricle passing from the trigone up into the lateral 
ventricle. The posterior trigonal area is then plugged with a 
large cotton ball to prevent blood from entering the lateral 
ventricle and passing to the dependent hemisphere. The 
tentorial edge and basomesial temporal pia mater are then 
exposed by dissecting the lateral ventricular sulcus (collat-
eral eminence) from within the temporal horn just lateral 
to the hippocampus. This can be done with bipolar coagula-
tion and suction or ultrasonic aspiration. In either case, the 
amygdala, hippocampus, and choroid plexus are protected 
from injury with cottonoid patties. Once the mesiobasal pia 
is identiﬁ ed just lateral to the parahippocampal gyrus, the 
dissection can be extended anteriorly to meet the pial dis-
section at the ﬂ oor of the anterior middle fossa. The para-
hippocampus is then aspirated to identify the tentorial edge. 
The tentorial edge is then followed from anterior to poste-
rior, curving back behind the mesencephalon. At this point, 
the posterior cerebral artery branches can be ligated as they 
pass from the perimesencephalic cistern over the tentorial 
edge to the temporo-occipital cortex. At the conclusion of 
this phase of the operation, the temporal lobe lateral to the

parahippocampal gyrus has been disconnected and the pos-
terior cerebral artery branches divided. The amygdala, hip-
pocampus, and a remnant of the parahippocampal gyrus 
remain in place. 
 Suprasylvian Dissection and Ventricular Access 
 Suprasylvian dissection through the superior limiting (cir-
cular) sulcus of the insula takes place to divide the coronal 
radiata and expose the lateral ventricle along its length. This 
can be done by careful dissection from above the insula or by 
following the trigonal ventricular opening around the poste-
rior aspect of the insula to the lateral ventricle  ( Fig. 7.7 ) . Dis-
section is facilitated by dividing the posterior branches of the 
MCA at the end of the sylvian ﬁ ssure. Once the corona radiata 
is divided, the entire length of the lateral ventricle is opened 
and the foramen of Monro plugged with a small cotton ball 
to prevent blood from entering the dependent ventricular 
system. Care should be taken to protect the choroid plexus 
to avoid unnecessary bleeding. Similarly, basal ganglia dis-
ruption can be prone to bleed and is best controlled by the 
application of hemostatic agents to the exposed surfaces. 
 Corpus Callosotomy and Mesial Disconnection 
 The corpus callosum is identiﬁ ed from within the ventricle 
at the junction of the septum pellucidum and the roof of the 
lateral ventricle. Aspirating the roof of the lateral ventricle 
just above this area leads to the gray matter of the ipsilateral 
cingulate gyrus and falx cerebri. This is meticulously aspi-
rated to prevent injury to the contralateral cingulum. Once 
this area is exposed, the pericallosal arteries and corpus 
callosum proper are easily identiﬁ ed. The corpus callosum 
and ipsilateral cingulate gyrus are then aspirated from the 
genu to the splenium. Complete sectioning is important to 
achieve and can be accomplished by following the perical-
losal artery, as it closely follows the characteristic course 
of the callosum. Special attention should be given to the 
genu and splenium to assure complete disruption of the 
horizontal ﬁ bers. Additional assistance is achieved by re-
moving the cingulate gyrus and identiﬁ cation of the infe-
rior edge of the interhemispheric falx. Finally, the ipsilateral 
fornix is disrupted by aspiration at a point just anterior to 
the splenium. Next, the mesial dissection should continue 
anteriorly coagulating and dividing the pia of the ipsilateral

anterior cerebral artery to where it joins the internal carotid 
artery. Dissection posterior to this landmark is ill advised 
to avoid injury to the hypothalamus and brainstem. Special 
care should be taken after the hemisphere is removed to en-
sure the basal posterior frontal lobe is completely removed. 
Once all the pial surfaces and white matter tracts have been 
cut, the draining veins to the sinuses are circumferentially 
coagulated and divided and any bleeding points packed with 
hemostatic agent. At this point the entire hemisphere can 
be removed in one anatomic piece and sent for pathologic 
study  ( Fig. 7.9 ) . 
 Amygdalohippocampectomy 
 The entry of the anterior choroidal artery into the tempo-
ral horn (choroidal point) is identiﬁ ed and the amygdala 
is dissected along the plane connecting the M-1 segment 
of the MCA and the choroidal point  ( Fig. 7.6 ) . This dissec-
tion proceeds from superﬁ cial white matter of the remain-
ing temporal stem through the amygdala and ﬁ nally into 
the uncus. The remaining parahippocampus and uncus are 
then removed via subpial aspiration. Care should be taken 
not to violate the mesial pia or injure the structures in the 
perimesencephalic cistern (oculomotor nerve, brainstem, 
posterior cerebral artery, and basal vein of Rosenthal). The 
hippocampus is then reﬂ ected inferiorly and the choroidal 
ﬁ ssure opened by aspirating the ﬁ mbria or fornix. At this 
point, the hippocampal sulcus is identiﬁ ed and developed 
by further aspirating the dentate gyrus. Once visualized, 
the hippocampal sulcus, including the hippocampal arteries 
and veins, is coagulated and divided. The hippocampus is 
then removed in one segment for pathologic study. 
 Insula Removal 
 The ultrasonic aspirator or suction-coagulation can be used 
to remove the insular cortex by subpial aspiration. As the 
MCA has already been controlled, arterial injury is of less 
concern than in the functional hemispherectomy operation. 
Care must be taken to limit resection to the insular gyri to 
avoid injury to deeper thalamic and brainstem structures. 
Stereotactic imaging might be useful at this stage, although 
a practical approach is to stop the dissection when underly-
ing white matter is reached. 
 Closure 
 A subdural ventricular catheter is placed in the operative 
cavity and brought out through a separate stab incision in 
the skin. The dura is closed with running 4–0 sutures and 
approximated with sutures to the bone ﬂ ap. The bone ﬂ ap is 
reapproximated with titanium plates and screws or suture, 
depending on the age of the patient. The temporalis muscle 
is repaired with permanent suture and a subgaleal drain 
placed through a separate stab incision. The galea and skin 
are then closed in separate anatomic layers. The incision 
is then sterilely dressed and the head wrapped in a gauze 
dressing.

tion. 
mesial frontal lobe including the arterial branches from the 
anterior circulation. This mesial frontoparietal disconnec-
tion is followed anteriorly to the base of the frontal lobe 
just above the olfactory nerve (frontal pole). Posteriorly, the 
edge of the falx is followed as it transitions to the tentorium. 
This mesial parieto-occipital resection should connect with 
the basal temporal disconnection below the sylvian ﬁ ssure, 
which was performed earlier. At this point, the callosum is 
disconnected and the pia along the mesial aspect of the en-
tire hemisphere is coagulated and divided. The only remain-
ing portion of the hemisphere in place is the basal frontal 
lobe below the genu and the draining veins to the venous 
sinuses. 
 Frontobasal Disconnection and Hemispheric 
Removal 
 The last remaining pia to be divided extends from the ante-
rior aspect of the sylvian ﬁ ssure down along the posterior 
basal frontal lobe. This pia is coagulated and divided along 
with the MCA branches to the frontal cortex. The posterior 
basal frontal lobe is aspirated maintaining a plane just ante-
rior to the anterosuperior insula  ( Fig. 7.8 ) . The orbitofrontal 
pia is then coagulated and divided down to the olfactory 
nerve and the pia overlying the gyrus rectus is identiﬁ ed 
and divided. The gyrus rectus is then aspirated to expose 
the contralateral gyrus rectus and a cottonoid patty placed 
to mark the midline. The pial dissection along the olfac-
tory nerve is then carried anteriorly to avoid disrupting the 
nerve. The remaining gyrus rectus is then aspirated; the 
posterior removal is limited by the internal carotid artery. 
The deep white matter and mesial frontal gyri are removed 
in subpial fashion by a dissection plane marked by the ante-
rior aspect of the frontal horn starting below the dissection 
of the genu of the corpus callosum. This dissection is per-
formed through the caudate nucleus along the course of the

 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The acute post-operative complications consist of hemor-
rhage, coagulopathy, aseptic meningitis, infarction, and 
hydrocephalus. Routine blood work, including hematocrit, 
platelets, and coagulation parameters, is closely monitored 
for the ﬁ rst 48–72 hours. Abnormal clotting times are com-
monly seen and corrected by administering fresh frozen 
plasma. The external ventricular catheter is set at the level 
of the foramen of Monro and maintained for 4–5 days to 
allow egress of bloody cerebrospinal ﬂ uid to minimize the 
    
severity of aseptic meningitis. Prophylactic intravenous anti-
biotics and steroids are continued during this period. Routine 
postoperative MRI is performed in the ﬁ rst 24 hours after 
operation to assess for residual tissue and hemorrhage and 
to determine baseline postoperative ventricular size. Anti-
convulsant levels are checked daily and dosing adjustments 
made as necessary. All the patients are evaluated by physical 
medicine and rehabilitation and receive physical, occupa-
tional, and speech therapy. Follow-up imaging of the brain 
is scheduled at 6 weeks postoperatively to check for hydro-
cephalus. All patients continue the same AED regimen at dis-
charge under the guidance of the medical epileptologists.

 Functional Hemispherectomy 
 Johannes  Schramm 
 
 Patient Selection 
 Functional hemispherectomy or hemispherotomy is indi-
cated for patients with severe unihemispherical damage in 
drug-resistant epilepsy or infantile catastrophic epilepsy. 
Typical diagnoses include extensive cortical dysplasia, 
hemimegalencephaly, Sturge-Weber disease, Rasmussen’s 
encephalitis, and perinatal infarct. Clinically these pictures 
are characterized by hemiparesis, partial or complete hemi-
anopia, and drug-resistant epilepsy. Hemiparesis is spastic, 
patients can walk, and frequently arm movement is more 
impaired than leg movement. In many cases the ﬁ ne pincer 
movements of index ﬁ nger and thumb are not possible but 
handgrip is maintained. 
 Increase in motor deﬁ cit is rather unlikely if damage 
to the hemisphere occurred in the ﬁ rst 2–3 years of life. 
Hemispherectomy is contraindicated if language function 
has not transferred or if presurgical evaluation could not 
demonstrate that all ictal activity originates from the af-
fected hemisphere. In subtotal hemianopia, completion to 
total hemianopia is unavoidable and considered by many 
patients to be acceptable in the event of surgery. In later 
onset hemisphere damage the intracarotid amobarbital 
test (Wada test) may be necessary to demonstrate that lan-
guage function has transferred to the healthy hemisphere. 
To establish diagnosis apart from the history of drug-re-
sistant or catastrophic epilepsy, presurgical evaluation with 
high-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and video 
electroencephalograph monitoring of seizures is usually 
sufﬁ cient. If mental retardation allows, neuropsychological 
testing is also performed. Mental retardation is no longer 
considered a contraindication. 
 Timing of surgery is determined by proof of unilateral 
hemispherical damage, severity of epilepsy, and age of the 
patient. Hemispherectomy carries no risk of increasing 
deﬁ cit if performed before the second or third year of life, 
so operation before that is considered ideal. In later onset 
Rasmussen’s encephalitis timing is more controversial: In 
young adults language function may never transfer, but im-
paired function of the healthy hemisphere induced by the 
severe epilepsy can produce neuropsychological deteriora-
tion and may indicate earlier surgery. Conservative neu-
rologists frequently feel that different therapeutic trials are 
necessary; others feel that early intervention is helpful to 
prevent neuropsychological damage because severe spastic 
hemiparesis caused by the progression of Rasmussen’s en-
cephalitis is usually unavoidable. In catastrophic infantile 
epilepsy a very early operation may be favorable for inborn 
brain malformations, even in the ﬁ rst months of life. In our 
experience, surgery at 4 months of age can be performed 
safely, but earlier interventions have been reported. 
 Approach Selection 
 Functional hemispherectomy  in the classical sense refers to 
the technique developed by Rasmussen, but several other 
techniques consisting of a combination of smaller brain 
excisions with disconnections of most parts of the brain 
and a callosotomy also correspond to a functional hemi-
spherectomy frequently called hemispherotomies. Strictly 
speaking, a hemispherotomy would consist only of discon-
necting steps without resection, but in the literature hemi-
spherotomy and functional hemispherectomy are used 
interchangeably for all these techniques. For these proce-
dures it is irrelevant whether parts of the hemisphere are 
removed or are only disconnected from the long tracts and 
contralateral hemisphere. This chapter will detail two surgi-
cal techniques: Rasmussen’s procedure and the transsylvian 
transventricular hemispherotomy (TTH). 
 The choice of procedure, i.e., classic Rasmussen’s func-
tional hemispherectomy (RFH) versus a TTH depends on the 
experience of the surgeon. For RFH only two large parts of 
the brain are removed: the temporal lobe, and the central 
hemispheric area, which includes the motor and sensory 
strip with an adjoining strip of frontal lobe and parietal 
lobe. This is supplemented by a callosotomy and a discon-
nection of the residual frontal lobe and parietal lobe, and 
the occipital lobe. The TTH includes an uncoamygdalohip-
pocampectomy, a transventricular callosotomy, and discon-
nections of the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Several 
other techniques for functional hemispherotomy have been 
published, but will be mentioned here only brieﬂ y. 
 Among the TTH approaches the keyhole transsylvian tech-
nique is ideal for atrophic hemispheres with enlarged ven-
tricles and most suitable for cases with perinatal infarction 
and large cysts in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. 
It is not the ideal procedure for hemimegalencephaly. For 
hemimegalencephaly a functional hemispherectomy tech-
nique should be used that is associated with a sufﬁ cient 
extent of tissue resection to allow for postoperative swell-

57
ing, which is more likely to be caused by the large volume 
of the affected hemisphere. RFH may be used if the surgeon 
is unfamiliar with the minimalistic TTH procedure, but it 
requires a larger exposure, more time and is usually associ-
ated with higher blood loss. It is easier to remove the most 
mesiobasal parts of the temporal lobe (hippocampus and 
parahippocampal gyrus) if these structures can be visual-
ized through the resection cavity of the lobectomy. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Antiepileptic drugs are not withdrawn and are given orally 
the morning before surgery. For hemimegalencephaly and 
other malformations with a near normal brain volume dex-
amethasone (4 mg, 6 times daily) is started 1 or 2 days be-
fore surgery and tapered within 4 to 6 days after surgery. 
In cases where much less tissue manipulation is necessary, 
such as large infarcts or huge ventricles, no dexamethasone 
is given. Two units of packed red cells are type matched 
and kept ready at the blood bank but not routinely in the 
operating room. In babies the matched units are ready in 
the operating room. 
 A prophylactic antibiotic (cefazoline 25–50 mg/kg) is 
given after anesthesia is induced and before the skin is in-
cised. Usually at least two intravenous lines are placed; in 
infants a third line may be necessary. Monitoring includes 
the usual parameters, PO 2 , PCO 2 , body temperature, blood 
pressure. A central venous line is not used routinely, or only 
in very small babies with expected larger blood loss than 
usual; for example, in hemimegalencephaly. A transurethral 
catheter is placed routinely. The patient may be placed ei-
ther in a lateral decubitus position or on his back with the 
shoulder elevated  ( Fig. 8.1 ) . A Bair Hugger (Augustin Medi-
cal, Eden Prairie, MN) is used to maintain body temperature 
between 36 and 37 degrees centigrade. An intra-arterial line 
is placed. During surgery serial tests of blood chemistry, he-
matocrit, acid base status, and (less frequently) coagulation 
parameters are conducted. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The position of the head is so that the plane of the fron-
totemporal region is parallel to the ﬂ oor but a slight tilt 
downward of the vertex is advisable. The head is placed 
in a Mayﬁ eld frame, the line of incision is marked with a 
skin marker, and the hair is prepped with antiseptic gel and 
braided away from the incision line. A .5 inch wide strip of 
skin overlying the incision line is shaved and the gelled hair 
is then covered with drapes, which are tacked to the skin 
following the curved outline of the incision. The skin inci-
sion is shown in   Fig. 8.1  , and the number 1 is used for RFH. 
Incision 2 is used for TTH. The skin incision and later the 
craniotomy need not reach the midline at the vertex. 
 Rasmussen’s Functional Hemispherectomy 
 The skin incision starts in front of the ear and has the typical 
question mark appearance of a frontotemporal skin incision. 
The ﬂ ap is then reﬂ ected and covered by wet cloth. The tem-
poralis fascia is cut 3–4 mm below its insertion and the tem-
poralis muscle is loosened from the bone with a periosteal 
elevator. The temporal muscle is reﬂ ected over the zygoma 
and covered in wet cloth. The bone ﬂ ap is large enough to 
expose the upper half of the temporal lobe and the central 
frontoparietal area to about 3 cm from the midline. 
 Three to four bur holes are placed with an air drill, and 
connected by craniotome cuts with a high-speed crani-
otome after the dura is separated from the overlying bone 
with a dissector or a Gigli (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) 
saw guide. The wing and the inferior portion of the tem-
poral bone are removed with a rongeur or high-speed drill 
to expose the anterior portion of the temporal lobe and 
the proximal sylvian ﬁ ssure. Twist drill holes are placed 
through the outer edge of the cranial bone cut and used for 
dural tack-up sutures. Four of these holes are also used for 
bone ﬂ ap sutures. Two pairs of holes are placed centrally 
in the bone ﬂ ap for tack-up sutures to be inserted through 
the bone ﬂ ap after closure of the dura. Bone wax is used 
sparingly and titanium clips used for hemostasis on the du-
ral edge are removed during closure. The dura is opened, 
leaving a basal bridge and reﬂ ected, and covered by saline-
soaked cottonoids. 
 Functional hemispherectomy with Rasmussen’s technique 
consists of four steps: (1) Perform a temporal lobectomy in-
cluding the hippocampus; (2) Remove the suprasylvian cen-
tral tissue block, opening the lateral ventricle; (3) Perform a 
transventricular callosotomy from inside the ventricle; and 
(4) Perform the frontal and parieto-occipital disconnections.  
The microscope is now brought into place. The sylvian ﬁ s-
sure may be left closed, using subpial dissection to expose 
the temporal and frontoparietal operculum. 
 The temporal lobectomy as the ﬁ rst step is done through 
two cortical incisions. One runs immediately parallel to the 
sylvian ﬁ ssure and a second on the dorsal temporal lobe in 
a 90-degree angle to the ﬁ rst incision down to the temporal 
base  ( Fig. 8.2 ) .  Microscissors and bipolar coagulation are 
used to make a pial incision on the superior temporal gyrus 
parallel to the sylvian ﬁ ssure  ( Fig. 8.2 ) . Major veins and M 2 
branches should be preserved.

a Mayﬁ eld frame, the frontotemporal plane of the skull is parallel to 
the ﬂ oor, the vertex may be slightly tilted downward. Incision line 1 is

and incision line 2 is used for transsylvian-transventricular functional 
hemispherectomy.

I 
Epilepsy
 A small Freer (or Penﬁ eld) dissector (Aesculap, Tuttlin-
gen, Germany) is used to dissect the arachnoid layer away 
from the cortex of the superior temporal gyrus parallel to 
the sylvian ﬁ ssure down to the level of the insular cortex, 
ending at the inferior circular sulcus. The posterior temporal 
lobe division is performed with the ultrasonic aspirator and 
bipolar coagulation down to the same level as the subpial 
dissection. About 10 mm basolaterally from the inferior cir-
cular sulcus the temporal horn is reached and opened along 
its length axis to the tip of the temporal horn. The dissection 
is then carried down to the temporal base laterally of the 
hippocampus and the  ultrasonic aspirator, dissector, and 
bipolar are used to disconnect the lateral neocortical part of 
the temporal lobe parallel to the hippocampus. Anteriorly 
the arachnoid of the uncus is cut and divided, always stay-
ing lateral to the tentorial border so the temporal tip and all 
of the lateral neocortical part of the temporal lobe can be 
removed in one piece. 
 The second part of temporal lobe removal consists of 
removing the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus 
and the mesial part of the uncus and the lateral part of the 
amygdala. At this stage the amygdaloid body is protruding 
medio-superiorly in a lateral basal direction into the lumen 
of the former temporal horn. First, the uncus is emptied 
with the ultrasonic aspirator by being carefully set low for 
intensity of suction and vibration, thus avoiding penetra-
tion of the ultrasonic aspirator through the arachnoid cov-
ering of the uncus and protecting the 3 rd  cranial nerve and 
major arterial vessels. Posteriorly the uncal removal ends 
on a line parallel to the MCA and the limen insulae. The 
lateral parts of the amygdaloid body are then removed with 
the aspirator along a line  (Number 1 in    Fig. 8.5 ) running 
from the limen insulae to the choroidal point, which is the 
most anterior point of the choroidal ﬁ ssure in the temporal 
horn, marked by the end of the insertion of the choroid 
plexus in the temporal horn. The ﬁ mbriae are then discon-
nected with bipolar coagulation and a dissector along the 
choroidal ﬁ ssure and the hippocampus and parahippocam-
pus are peeled out of its arachnoid layer using the Freer 
dissector, alternating from the lateral and mesial aspect. 
Posteriorly the ultrasonic aspirator is used again to discon-
nect the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus from the 
posterior aspect of the temporal lobe and the hippocampal 
tail. Anterior to the choroidal point  (Number 3 in  Fig. 8.5 ) 
the entorhinal cortex is also removed mesiobasally from 
the amygdaloid body with the ultrasonic aspirator forming 
a disconnection line from the choroidal ﬁ ssure posteriorly 
to the emptied arachnoid covering of the uncus anteriorly. 
The small vessels entering the hippocampal ﬁ ssure from 
mesially located larger branches are carefully coagulated

sion runs parallel to the sylvian ﬁ ssure on the superior temporal gyrus 
of the temporal lobe with the posterior border of its resection corre-
sponding to a full temporal lobectomy, i.e., reaching far more posteri-
orly then for an anterior two-thirds resection. The posterior resection 
line is approximately 8 cm behind the temporal pole. The central block 
is 5–6 cm wide and includes the precentral and postcentral gyrus and 
reaches from the sylvian ﬁ ssure up to the convexity.

the opercula. The arrow points to the circle symbolizing the ascending 
M1 branch just anterior to the limen insulae. Note how different the 
overlap of the temporal operculum versus the much larger overlap of 
the frontoparietal operculum is with regard to the outline of the syl-
vian ﬁ ssure. The exposure shown in (B) is obtained after a resection of 
the opercula similar to Villemure’s opercular window technique. The 
thick interrupted line corresponds to the circular sulcus.

and divided with microscissors working a few millimeters 
in the hippocampal ﬁ ssure. Then the longitudinal roll of 
the hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus complex can be 
removed en bloc or in smaller fragments, depending on the 
experience of the surgeon. The en bloc removal allows for 
detailed histopathological evaluation. 
 In the second step a 5–6 cm wide block of hemispheric 
brain tissue  ( Fig. 8.2 )  is removed from the sylvian ﬁ ssure 
upward to the midline, reaching the falx by opening the lat-
eral ventricle widely and including the operculum. A width 
of 5–6 cm is enough to safely reach the anterior genu and 
posterior end of the corpus callosum, which is usually no 
longer than 7–7.5 cm. Again, subpial dissection is used on 
the operculum parallel to the sylvian ﬁ ssure. Two parallel 
cortical incisions after careful coagulation of the arachnoid 
are placed above the sylvian ﬁ ssure leading up to the ver-
tex. At the superior circular Sulcus of the insular cistern the 
transsection of the corona radiata is done from the ven-
tricular lumen outward after the ventricular cavity has been 
reached by the two vertical incisions. The brain is divided 
with the ultrasonic aspirator. Not all M3 and M4 branches 
need to be preserved. On the mesial surface, removal of this 
hemispheric block automatically corresponds to a callosal 
section in the central area of this approach. 
 The third step is to complete the transventricular cal-
losotomy, disconnecting the callosal ﬁ ber tracts from the 
ependymal surface toward the arachnoid covering of the 
cingulate gyrus anteriorly and posteriorly. The pericallosal 
artery is a good guideline in the anterior part of the cal-
losal section. The posterior part of the callosal section is 
also disconnected from within the ventricle, always care-
fully coagulating ependymal veins. At the end of this step 
the white matter of the basal frontal lobe is still intact, as are 
the white matter tracts lateral of the tip of the frontal horn. 
Similarly, the mesial white matter of the occipital, parietal, 
and dorsal temporal lobes is still intact. 
 The fourth step consists of disconnecting the frontal lobe 
and the parieto-occipital lobe completely. The corona ra-
diata anterior and posterior to the central block resection 
laterally from the ventricle is still intact and can be discon-
nected by retracting the frontal lobe and frontal operculum 
anteriorly and elevating it at the same time by retraction. 
The white matter is transected with a dissector or aspira-
tor at the level of the superior circular sulcus. After having 
reached the most anterior aspect of the superior central 
sulcus (the sulcus where the insular cortical surface changes 
into the undersurface of the frontal operculum,  Figure 8.3B ) 
the disconnection has now to be carried from the mesial 
callosal disconnection area down to the frontal base. This 
is done by using bipolar and suction or the ultrasonic as-
pirator. An ideal guideline is to follow the anterior cerebral 
artery from its most mesial point (the border between A2 
and A1) and work through the tip of the frontal horn across 
the frontal base to the carotid bifurcation, and then discon-
nect the frontal basal white matter parallel to the M1 seg-
ment  (line 2,    Fig. 8.5   )  reaching the superior circular sulcus 
at the rostral end of the sylvian cistern under the frontal 
operculum. 
 The posterior disconnection can only be done if the syl-
vian cistern is exposed to its very end. The posterior part 
of the corona radiata is still intact after the central tissue 
block is removed, and is then divided with the aspirator 
at the level of the superior circular sulcus, usually sparing 
major branches of the MCA at the distal end of the sylvian 
ﬁ ssure. The parietal operculum can be reﬂ ected with a self-
retaining retractor and the disconnection line is carried 
from the posterior part of the lateral ventricle opening up 
the trigone down to the posterior end of the temporal lobe 
resection cavity. At this stage the parietal and occipital lobes 
are disconnected in their superﬁ cial layers but not yet in 
the deep mesial parts. The mesial disconnection is started 
superiorly at the posterior end of the central callosotomy 
where the falcotentorial rim can be visualized through the 
mesial arachnoid, which usually is left intact. For the dorsal 
callosotomy and parieto-occipital disconnection the falco-
tentorial rim is the guide structure, as the pericallosal artery 
is too thin or absent. Dividing the mesial white matter of 
the occipital and parietal lobes on the medial wall of the 
trigone, one follows the outline of the falcotentorial rim 
toward the temporal fossa, ﬁ nally reaching the posterior 
margin of the temporal lobe resection. The frontal, parietal, 
and occipital lobes are disconnected, and the mesial and ba-
sal arachnoid surfaces are left intact. The posterior cerebral 
artery is spared, as are major branches of the MCA and the 
pericallosal artery. This avoids producing infarcted areas in 
the remaining lobes. 
 Before dura closure the ventricular system and the resec-
tion cavities are repeatedly irrigated with warm saline solu-
tion. The dura is closed with interrupted and running 3–0 
silk sutures or 4–0 silk sutures in small infants. The bone 
ﬂ ap is reinserted and ﬁ xed with 2–0 nonabsorbable sutures. 
Central tack-up sutures are added. The temporalis muscle 
is sutured to its insertion anteriorly, superiorly, and basally 
with interrupted Vicryl sutures. The scalp is then reﬂ ected 
and closed in two layers with interrupted Vicryl sutures and 
skin staples. No subgaleal suction drainage is used. 
 Transsylvian-Transventricular Functional 
Hemispherectomy 
 This version of functional hemispherectomy uses much less 
brain resection and more disconnection. 
 The four main features are the transsylvian approach 
through a small craniotomy via a linear incision, a small 
temporo-mesial resection limited to uncoamygdalohippo-
campectomy, and transventricular callosotomy followed by 
transsylvian frontobasal disconnection and transsylvian-
transventricular occipitoparietal mesial disconnection. A 
schematic view of the disconnection lines is shown in   Fig-
ure 8.4 . 
 The skin incision for this approach is linear (incision 2 in 
 Fig 8.1 ), and may be slightly curved anteriorly in its superior 
part if the craniotomy is planned to be longer than 4.5 cm. It 
starts in front of the ear and leaves the temporalis fascia in-
tact. The temporalis fascia is split in the same direction as the 
skin and the temporal muscle insertion at the linea tempora-
lis is dissected with a periosteal elevator. The skin retractor is 
then placed deeper, retracting the two parts of the temporalis 
muscle. The bone ﬂ ap is planned to be 4 cm high and 4–5 

60

Epilepsy
cm long, its lower border parallel to the sylvian ﬁ ssure only 
overlying the temporal operculum for about 0.5 cm and thus 
overlying the frontal and parietal operculum 3.5 cm. The ex-
act anterior-posterior length of the craniotomy ﬂ ap can easily 
be calculated from the preoperative MRI, which will show 
the length of the basal ganglia block. If the ventricles are 
enlarged, a 4 cm craniocaudal craniotomy ﬂ ap usually ending 
superiorly at about the level of the roof of the lateral ventricle 
is enough. A neuronavigation system may be used to ideally 
place the bone ﬂ ap. Because the corpus callosum usually is 
no longer than 7.5 cm, a 5 cm bone ﬂ ap easily allows the sur-
geon to view obliquely through this opening, even in brains 
with little atrophy, and to reach the anterior end of the ros-
trum and the posterior border of the splenium. 
 The dura is opened with two diagonal incisions, reﬂ ected 
and covered by wet cottonoids. The sylvian ﬁ ssure is identi-
ﬁ ed on the brain surface and opened to expose the ascend-
ing M1 branch, the limen insulae, and the insular cortex 
with the M2 and M3 branches. It is important to open the 
sylvian ﬁ ssure to the very end to expose the circular sulcus 
superiorly and temporally  ( Fig. 8.3 ) . 
 Frequently the MCA branches are much smaller than in 
healthy brains. In cases with larger cystic cavities in the 
MCA territory, one may encounter several layers of dense 
membranes and it may not at all be easy to identify which 
cavity corresponds to one of the enlarged ventricles. In 
these polycystic hemispheres a good identiﬁ er is the choroid 
plexus and the typical appearance of ependyma. The classic 
shape and structure of the hippocampus may no longer be 
recognizable. The dissection at the level of the insular cortex 
is then carried underneath the frontoparietal operculum 
until the circular sulcus is reached. 
 The ﬁ rst step, the temporo-mesiobasal resection, is 
started by opening the temporal horn through the infe-
rior circular sulcus. Because the temporal horn is usually 
enlarged, it can be reached easily through 10 to 15 mm of 
brain tissue dissecting laterobasally from the inferior circu-
lar sulcus. Once the temporal horn is opened, one can see 
the whole length of the hippocampus; the choroid plexus 
is recognizable, and is a good guide to the choroidal ﬁ s-
sure. The arachnoid of the temporal pole anterior to the 
ascending M1 is coagulated and transected and the uncus is 
emptied with the ultrasonic aspirator. The aspirator should 
be set to low values for suction and irrigation and thus the 
arachnoid of the uncus will be left undamaged. Viewing 
through the sylvian ﬁ ssure into the longitudinally opened 
temporal horn, one can see the emptied uncus anteriorly 
and the choroidal ﬁ ssure more posteriorly. With the ultra-
sonic aspirator the mesial disconnection is then performed 
from the choroidal point anterior through the tissue of the 
amygdaloid body and the entorhinal cortex, always respect-
ing the arachnoid on the mesial surface. Laterally from the 
hippocampus, a similar disconnection is made far poste-
riorly with a dissector or an aspirator always parallel to 
the hippocampus. Mesially the ﬁ mbriae are disconnected 
with a dissector; the parahippocampal gyrus comes into 
view and is sub pially elevated with a dissector out of its 
arachnoidal bed. During this step the small vessels crossing 
from the perimesencephalic cistern into the hippocampal 
sulcus have to be coagulated and cut. At this stage the hip-
pocampus has been disconnected mesially, laterally and 
anteriorly, so the only step remains the posterior discon-
nection with the aspirator. Working alternately from lateral

peel the longitudinal roll of the combined hippocampus/
parahippocampus out of its arachnoid layer and remove it

rior part of the trigone.

on the mesial aspect of the temporal lobe.

 The second step is the entry into the lateral ventricular 
lumen, following the outline of the circular sulcus from the 
most posterior part of the sylvian ﬁ ssure under the fron-
toparietal operculum to its most anterior aspect. This can 
be done with bipolar or ultrasonic aspiration, having co-
agulated the pia and divided it with ﬁ ne scissors. One has to 
cross several major M3 and M4 branches of the MCA, most 
of which are left intact. In this way the corticospinal ﬁ bers 
passing from the cortex through the corona radiata lateral to 
the ventricle have totally been disconnected and the whole 
ventricle can now be viewed through this U-shaped opening 
of the ventricular system. 
 The third step is the mesial disconnection, which has to 
be done for the frontobasal white matter, the whole corpus 
callosum, and the mesial white matter of the occipitopari-
etal lobe. One starts at the frontal end of the disconnection 
line viewing at the opened frontal horn and the base of 
the frontal lobe. The disconnection line (line 2,   Fig. 8.5   )  is 
aimed to reach the base of the frontal lobe just anterior to 
the descending M1, deeper down anterior to the A1 until 
the midline. The arachnoid over the lateral aspect of the 
basal frontal lobe is coagulated and cut. With the aspirator 
the white matter and cortex are removed, creating a narrow 
slit between the tip of the frontal horn and the arachnoid at 
the frontal lobe base. One can see the M1 and A1 through 
the basal arachnoid covering which usually is left intact. 
The basal disconnection is carried down to the level of the 
interhemispheric ﬁ ssure. One can open the arachnoid to 
make sure that one actually sees both A2 segments and then 
carries the disconnection antero-mesially around the genu 
of the corpus callosum, always following the outline of the 
A2 around the genu to the superior surface of the corpus 
callosum. The retractor is slowly moved from anterior to 
posterior retracting the frontoparietal operculum, and the 
disconnection is carried through the corpus callosum fol-
lowing the outline of the pericallosal artery. The arachnoid 
of the cingular gyrus is left intact. In the posterior part of the 
corpus callosum it is better to follow the inferior border of 
the falx, working one’s way posteriorly. Here one is guided 
by the falcotentorial rim, which safely leads the surgeon 
posterior of the splenium through the posterior part of the 
trigone. At the level of the calcar avis the posterior cerebral 
artery is crossing the tentorial rim covered by arachnoid 
and is spared. With the aspirator one continues the dis-
connection always following the tentorial rim now turning 
more anteriorly toward the resection cavity where the hippo-
campus has been removed. Ependymal veins are coagulated 
carefully and cut. When viewing into the ventricular trigone 
via the posterior part of the insular cistern two to three ma-
jor MCA branches transect the view and are usually spared. 
At the end the ventricular cavity is irrigated repeatedly. If 
the insular cortex has not been destroyed it may be removed 
after the MCA branches are mobilized with the aspirator 
working subpially. Hemostasis on the outer surface of the 
basal ganglia block is best achieved by careful bipolar co-
agulation and Surgicel. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Patients are brought to the intensive care unit in all cases. 
Infants, children, and adults with a large extent of brain 
manipulation are extubated on the intensive care when fully 
awake and after having reached a normal temperature. In 
juveniles and adults with a large atrophy or large cystic 
components and little brain manipulation, immediate ex-
tubation may be possible. Monitoring comprises the classic 
parameters of neurofunction, such as state of wakefulness, 
verbal response, motor reaction and papillary reaction and 
also pulse frequency, blood pressure, and temperature. Uri-
nary output is monitored because diabetes insipidus has 
been described. 
 Fluid losses, including cerebrospinal ﬂ uid, are replaced 
during surgery. Severely retarded children, small infants, 
and patients with hemimegalencephaly may be kept more 
than one night on the intensive care unit. Anticonvulsant 
medication is continued postoperatively without interrup-
tion. Moderately elevated temperatures in the postoperative 
period are very frequent and do not automatically indicate 
infection. 
 Postoperative complications include hematomas, electro-
lyte disturbances, ventriculitis, and craniotomy infection. 
Physical therapy is used if an increase in hemiparesis is 
noted. If hemiparesis is signiﬁ cant, patients are transferred 
to a rehabilitation clinic. 
 In children, in particular in babies, special care needs to be 
taken because of different physiology and particularly be-
cause blood volume is relatively low. Preventing hypother-
mia is more difﬁ cult and blood components should begin 
to be replaced early during surgery to prevent hemoglobin 
from falling to 8 g/l.

the limen insulae (4) parallel to the M1 segment and crosses the bulg-
ing amygdala complex reaching the choroidal point (3) in the tempo-
ral horn, (the end of the choroidal ﬁ ssure). The frontobasal discon-
nection (2) is shown going from the bottom of the tip of the anterior 
horn through the frontobasal white matter immediately anterior to 
the middle cerebral artery.

 Contrary to expectations Sturge-Weber disease usually 
does not pose a signiﬁ cant risk of blood loss and hemostasis 
is not more difﬁ cult. Hemimegalencephaly may be associ-
ated with abnormal large veins deep in the white matter 
and an increased vascularization, plus a greater tendency 
to bleed during surgery. In addition, midline structures may 
be located asymmetrically and not truly on the midline. 
Hemimegalencephaly procedures in babies are therefore 
particularly difﬁ cult. 
 Three alternative techniques for TTH are shown schemati-
cally in comparison to the TTH described here in detail in

 Multiple Subpial Transection 
 Walter W.  Whisler 
 
  Multiple subpial transection (MST) is a surgical technique 
in which ﬁ ne parallel cuts are made in areas of the brain 
cortex that cannot be surgically resected in patients with 
medically intractable focal epilepsy. This procedure is used 
alone if the seizure focus resides only in an eloquent area 
(the motor strip, the sensory strip, or the speech area); if 
the seizure focus extends into an eloquent area beyond 
boundaries that could be surgically resected, the proce-
dure is used in combination with a primary resection of 
the seizure focus. 
 The scientiﬁ c rationale behind MST is described in a pub-
lication published earlier and is based on the facts that: (1) 
the vertical column is the master organizational principle 
of the cerebral cortex; (2) a cortical island wider than 5 
mm or with horizontal connections larger than 5 mm is 
required to be able to support paroxysmal discharges; and 
(3) in the initial phases of seizure spread, an interruption in 
the short intrinsic internuncial connections of the cerebral 
cortex interferes with cell synchronization and ictal propa-
gation  ( Fig. 9.1 ) . 
 Patient Selection 
 Selection criteria are similar to those for focal cortical resec-
tions (medically intractable seizures that arise from a single 
focus based on imaging, seizure semiology, and electroen-
cephalograph [EEG] or invasive recording), but with the 
additional criteria that the seizure focus involves eloquent 
cortex such as primary motor cortex, or speech areas. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The extent of surgical treatment is tailored for each pa-
tient. Since the boundaries of the epileptogenic lesion, and

tions without disrupting vertical organization of cortex.

therefore the extent of the MST, are guided by intraopera-
tive electrocorticography, it is important that the anesthetic 
agents do not interfere with the EEG recordings (avoid using 
benzodiazepines, nitrous oxide, and halothane). We employ 
ample local anesthesia (Lidocaine and Bupivacaine). In the 
conscious patient, this is supplemented with droperidol and 
fentanyl. For patients who are intubated, we use methohexi-
tal with fentanyl, droperidol, and pancuronium in associa-
tion with the local anesthetic. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The surgical subpial transector instrument consists of a 
blunt hook with a polished tip, fabricated from a single piece 
of stainless steel wire (Whisler/Morrell subpial transector, 
Remond Neurotechnologists, Lake Zurich, IL, USA). The wire 
is slightly springy, but malleable enough that the orienta-
tion of the handle to the tip can be altered to allow the an-
gle of the handle to be changed for differences in approach 
to the gyri, especially if there are physical impediments 
produced by the relationship of the gyri to the edge of the 
craniotomy. The tip of the hook is bent upward at an obtuse 
angle for a distance of 5 mm. Although the hook on our ini-
tial instrument was bent to 90 degrees, we have increased 
this angle to 100 degrees. This makes it less likely that the 
hook will become entangled in deep vessels, and permits 
disengagement if they are encountered. The hook must be 
held perpendicular to the pial surface at all times during the 
transection; otherwise, the cortex will be undercut rather 
than transected. To help maintain this perpendicular orien-
tation, the instrument is designed so that the plane of the 
hook is oriented parallel to the ﬂ at side of the handle. 
 After electrocorticography and functional mapping have 
been performed, the proposed area of transection is out-
lined with a black thread. Although the plan is to make the 
transections cross the axis of the gyri, this is not always pos-
sible. The blood vessels do not always overlie the sulci and 
may cross the gyri, so it is often difﬁ cult to decide exactly 
where the sulci are located. Some ﬁ ne capillary bleeding is 
associated with each transection. This bleeding is usually 
self-limiting, but on occasion there is enough subarachnoid 
bleeding to impair anatomical visualization. This subarach-
noid bleeding tends to gravitate to the more dependent 
areas of the exposure. Therefore, it is best to begin the 
transection in the more dependent regions. If the gyrus is 
obscured by subarachnoid blood, a small nick can be made 
in the pia over a dependent area of the brain and the blood 
milked and washed from the subarachnoid space. 
 Once the proposed area of transection has been identi-
ﬁ ed and an avascular area on the gyrus next to the sulcus 
is selected, the ﬁ rst assistant makes a pinhole-sized nick 
in the pia arachnoid with a # 20 spinal needle  ( Fig. 9.2 ) . 
Through this ﬁ ne pinhole, the tip of the transection hook 
is introduced and, with the hook kept perpendicular to the 
pial surface at all times, its tip is brought to the surface of 
the pia arachnoid where it can be visualized. The tip of the 
hook is passed across the gyrus, being careful not to extend 
deeper than 5 mm below the pia. At intervals, the tip of the 
hook is brought to the surface of the pia to make certain

that the correct depth is maintained  ( Fig. 9.3  inset A) . After 
the hook has been passed completely across the gyrus to 
its fullest extent, it is then swept back; its tip keeps the 
pia slightly elevated  ( Fig. 9.3  inset B) . By sense of feel, it is 
possible to detect any resistance that would be caused by 
contact with any signiﬁ cant blood vessels, especially any 
deep in a sulcus. If resistance is encountered, the hook can 
be backed off and dropped a little, and it will slide past the 
vessels or the obstruction. The transector hook is gently 
drawn back across the gyrus on the same plane it was intro-
duced. A strict vertical orientation is maintained and guided 
by the ﬂ at side of the handle. In instances where it has been 
necessary to transect intrasylvian or interhemispheric cor-
tices, it is impossible to manipulate the hook as described. 
The hook is introduced upside down and pushed across the 
gyrus, rather than being swept back across the gyrus. This 
is especially helpful with transection of the frontal leg area 
of the cortex next to the falx. 
 As soon as the transector hook has been removed, a small 
piece of thrombin-soaked Gelfoam is placed over the pin-
hole introduction site  ( Fig. 9.4 ) . A small cotton sponge is 
placed across the entire transection site, and gentle pres-
sure is applied for about 1 minute. While this is being done, 
another transection is begun at a distant site, but within the 
proposed transection area. By rotating to a different loca-
tion within the deﬁ ned area to be transected, the subpial 
bleeding will usually have stopped by the time I return to 
make the next adjacent transection. The capillary bleeding 
from each transection results in a ﬁ ne red line, which usu-
ally becomes a dark blue line after a few minutes. Using the 
transection line as a reference, the next transection is made 
5 mm parallel to the previous transection  ( Fig. 9.5 ) . 
 MST is usually performed on eloquent cortex in conjunc-
tion with resection of adjacent noneloquent cortex (usually 
dominant anterior temporal lobe). Of 9 patients who un-
derwent MST alone without cortical resection and a median 
follow-up of 8 years, 2 are seizure-free and 7 are at least 90% 
improved (Engel class I-III). In addition we have also per-
formed MST in 20 patients with Landau-Kleffner Syndrome 
(acquired epileptic aphasia of childhood). Although aphasic

before surgery, about 66% of the patients were eventually 
able to speak in complex sentences. 
 In a recent meta-analysis of 211 patients from 6 epilepsy 
centers, 71% of patients with generalized seizures undergo-
ing MST alone (without lesion resection) had about a 95% 
seizure reduction. Multiple subpial transection for intracta-
ble partial epilepsy: an international meta-analysis. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 After an extensive area has undergone MST, there will be 
a small amount of edema in the outer layers of the cortex, 
which can be seen on magnetic resonance or computed to-
mography scans, as well as spotty and occasionally verti-
cally oriented, lenticular-shaped signals caused by bleeding. 
After transection, patients are usually asymptomatic and 
the changes seen on the scans usually resolve with very few, 
if any, residual effects. Patients sometimes have transient 
neurologic ﬁ ndings that are compatible with the area of 
MST that occur in the immediate postoperative period, but 
these changes rapidly clear before the patient leaves the 
hospital. 
 In our series of the ﬁ rst 97 patients, no patient died as a 
result of MST. Ten patients had transient (up to 6 months) 
changes. Seven patients (7.2%) had permanent complica-
tions ranging from asymptomatic intracerebral hemor-
rhages to a permanent weakness of the foot, a worsening of 
a previous dysphasia and an intracerebral hemorrhage with 
hemiplegia in a patient with multiple calciﬁ ed granulomas. 
As our experience has increased, the complication rate has 
decreased and there has been no mortality.

  Sectioning of the Corpus Callosum for 
Epilepsy 
 Bharat Guthikonda,  Sheila  Smitherman , and Daniel Yoshor 
  Van Wegenen and Herren observed several patients in the 
1930s who suffered from glioma, meningioma, or infarction 
affecting the corpus callosum. They noted that, in several of 
these patients, preexisting seizure disorder improved signiﬁ -
cantly as the callosal involvement progressed. The seizures 
became less frequent, more focal, and often were not accom-
panied by loss of consciousness. Subsequent animal studies 
conﬁ rmed that the corpus callosum is an important pathway 
for seizure propagation and generalization. Partial division 
of the corpus callosum had previously been performed as 
a means to access the third ventricle for tumor resection 
and was clinically well tolerated. It was with this knowledge 
that, in 1940, Van Wegenen performed the ﬁ rst corpus cal-
losotomy for palliation of medically intractable seizures. 
 Over the subsequent 40 years, several variations of com-
missurotomy were performed with varying frequency and 
varying degrees of success. Bogen et al and Luessenhop  
published series showing beneﬁ t of performing callosotomy 
for epilepsy control in the 1960s and 1970s. However, be-
cause of the high morbidity, corpus callosotomy for epilepsy 
control fell out of favor. 
 The return of callosotomy was sparked by the diligent 
work of Wilson and coworkers at Dartmouth in the mid 
to late 1970s. Wilson adopted three operative philosophies 
that markedly decreased the morbidity and mortality as-
sociated with callosotomy: (1) use of the surgical micro-
scope; (2) sectioning only the corpus callosum (without 
involving other midline commissures); and (3) staging the 
cases where total callosotomy was deemed necessary. The 
improved outcomes were later conﬁ rmed by the work of 
several others. 
 Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) placement has also become a 
popular procedure for palliative seizure control. Although its 
long-term efﬁ cacy has not yet been determined, VNS place-
ment is an appealing alternative to corpus callosotomy be-
cause there is less associated morbidity. Overall, long-term 
maintenance of VNS actually make it signiﬁ cantly more costly 
than performing callosotomy. The role of corpus callosotomy 
needs to be well deﬁ ned given this less morbid option. 
 Patient Selection 
 Before palliative surgery for epilepsy is considered, a com-
plete epilepsy evaluation should be performed. This is ide-
ally done using a multidisciplinary approach consisting of 
the patient’s epileptologist, electrophysiologist, radiologist, 
and neurosurgeon. The epileptologist should conﬁ rm that 
the epilepsy disorder is indeed refractory to medical ther-
apy. This typically means that seizures have been present 
and disabling for at least 2 years and that maximal appro-
priately patterned anticonvulsant use with therapeutic drug 
levels has been unsuccessful in controlling the seizures. All 
patients should have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
with gadolinium. Inclusion of T2 and ﬂ uid-attenuated in-
version recovery sequences are critical to identify subtly 
abnormal areas. Venous anatomy can also often be assessed 
with MRI, which may become useful as craniotomy plan-
ning is performed. It is most important to exclude a focal 
abnormality that could make the patient a candidate for a 
resective procedure. If an epileptogenic focus can be identi-
ﬁ ed, nearly all epilepsy surgeons would agree that the initial 
surgical intervention should be a resective, potentially cura-
tive procedure. 
 Ictal electroencephalogram (EEG), preferably with a video 
monitoring component, is also crucial to preoperative eval-
uation. This is the ideal way to characterize the patient’s sei-
zure pattern and to determine the overall number of seizure 
types. Most patients who are considered for palliative epi-
lepsy operations suffer from more than one seizure type. 
 Wada testing is not routinely performed before callosal 
sectioning. However, it may be considered in left-handed 
patients or if there is signiﬁ cant left hemisphere disease 
on preoperative imaging. There have been reported cases 
of postoperative language deﬁ cits associated with mixed 
cerebral dominance, though this does not seem to the nor-
mal outcome in patients with mixed cerebral dominance 
(describes the scenario when the language-dominant hemi-
sphere does not control the dominant hand). 
 The two main seizures types that have beneﬁ ted the 
greatest from corpus callosotomy are drop attacks and sec-
ondarily generalized seizures. Multiple series have shown 
80–100% reduction in drop attacks.  Therefore, patients who 
are debilitated or otherwise seriously injured by the after-
maths of drop attacks should seriously be considered for 
corpus callosotomy. This appears to be the most favorable 
and common indication for callosotomy. 
 In the treatment of generalized seizures without a resect-
able focus, the outcomes of corpus callosotomy and VNS 
placement do not signiﬁ cantly differ. Therefore, VNS place-

68 
I 
Epilepsy
ment is often considered the ﬁ rst line palliative procedure 
for these patients because it avoids the risks inherent with 
intracranial surgery. 
 Other seizure types also appear to beneﬁ t from callosal 
sectioning. Tonic and tonic-clonic generalized seizures have 
both been shown to respond, to varying degrees, to callosal 
sectioning. Certain clinical syndromes have also been re-
ported to respond well to callosotomy. These include infantile 
hemiplegia, forme fruste infantile hemiplegia, Rasmussen’s 
encephalitis, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The former two 
tended to respond best, but the latter two improved sufﬁ -
ciently to also make callosotomy a viable option. 
 There have been no truly proven contraindications to per-
form callosotomy. Mental retardation has been shown to be 
a poor prognostic factor in terms of seizure control. 
 Most patients who are considered for callosotomy have 
intelligence quotients (IQs) lower than 75. The devastating 
impact that drop attacks and injuries from subsequent falls 
have on the lives of the patients and their families must be 
carefully considered when these patients are evaluated for 
corpus callosotomy. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Informed Consent Process 
 As with any surgical procedure, the surgeon should inform 
the patient and family about operative details, expected 
length of stay, neurological and medical risks of surgery, 
and goals of the operation. Given that corpus callosotomy is 
a palliative procedure, the family members must be made 
aware before surgery that seizures are not expected to be 
completely resolved. 
 Length of Callosotomy 
 The next decision that the surgeon should make before the 
operation is the extent of the callosotomy that will be per-
formed. When the operation was ﬁ rst being performed in the 
1940s, it was common to perform a complete callosotomy 
as an initial, one-stage operation. Often, other midline com-
missures such as the anterior, posterior, and hippocampal 
commissures were also sectioned at the same time. This led 
to high neurological morbidity. One of Wilson’s advance-
ments included performing an initial anterior callosotomy 
and leaving the other midline commissures untouched. This 
led to fewer postoperative deﬁ cits. 
 Much work has been done to determine the optimal length 
of the callosum to be sectioned. In 1988, Spencer et al sug-
gested that the results of complete callosotomy were twice 
as effective as anterior callosotomy. More recent studies do 
not support this hypothesis. Oguni et al found that section-
ing of the anterior two-thirds of the callosum yielded sig-
niﬁ cantly better results than sectioning only the anterior 
one-half. Mamelek et al found that, as long as the anterior 
half of the callosum was sectioned, the extent above that 
did not signiﬁ cantly reduce seizures. In fact, in their study, 
the group that had the worse outcome in terms of seizure 
reduction had the longest callosotomies. They also found 
that the extent of callosotomy had no impact on neuropsy-
chological outcome. Spencer et al, in 1993, concurred that 
anterior two-thirds callosotomy is also highly likely to be 
effective in reducing both atonic and tonic generalized sei-
zures. Those who failed anterior callosotomy were often 
referred for second-stage completion. This subgroup of pa-
tients tended to have more than two seizure types, lower 
intelligence scores (verbal IQ lower than 80), and diffuse 
ictal EEG patterns. Some have even suggested that patients 
with extremely low baseline neurologic function and diffuse 
EEG abnormalities should undergo complete callosotomy as 
the initial procedure because they are less likely to develop 
clinically apparent deﬁ cits. 
 The efﬁ cacy of anterior callosotomy and the increased risk 
of disconnection syndrome with complete callosotomy have 
led most centers, including ours, to advocate anterior two 
thirds callosotomy as the initial procedure. Convincing data 
have suggested that seizures are further reduced with the 
second-stage completion in patients with failed anterior cal-
losotomies with acceptable morbidity. The complications as-
sociated with complete callosotomy appear to be less appar-
ent when the procedure is performed in a staged fashion. 
 In the past, it seemed very common that the length of 
callosotomy was overestimated intraoperatively. However, 
with the ability to use intraoperative neuronavigation, the 
length divided can be determined with more accuracy. 
 Anesthesia 
 Anesthesia for corpus callosotomy adopts most of the neu-
roanesthetic principles used for craniotomy in general. Pa-
tients undergoing this procedure often suffer from mental 
retardation and thus require premedication for anxiety re-
lief. Parents or other loved ones are often kept within sight 
of the patient for comfort until the patient is completely 
sedated. 
 Patients who undergo callosal sectioning tend to be 
young. Therefore, they usually do not have signiﬁ cant medi-
cal comorbidities that need to be addressed by the anesthe-
siologist. An arterial line is usually placed after induction. 
Central venous pressure monitoring is usually not neces-
sary. Given that the patient is usually positioned in a supine 
position with the head slightly elevated, end tidal carbon 
dioxide and precordial Doppler are often used to help detect 
evidence of air embolus. Minimal blood loss is anticipated 
with callosotomy. 
 We do not routinely use intraoperative electrocorticogra-
phy in callosotomy cases at our center. 
 General Preoperative Care 
 Anticonvulsant levels are optimized prior to surgery. Preop-
erative antibiotics are also used. We prefer using Cefazo-
lin for gram positive skin ﬂ ora coverage. Clindamycin or 
vancomycin is alternatively given if previous anaphylactic 
response was noted with penicillin or cephalosporins. Dex-
amethasone (10–20 mg) is given before skin incision. If the 
brain is suspected to be edematous, mannitol is also useful

at dural opening. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) 
for the lower extremities are routinely used in our adult 
patients. As deep venous thrombosis is extremely unusual 
in the pediatric population, SCDs are not routinely used in 
children. An indwelling urinary catheter is placed after in-
duction. Because the craniotomy is usually made over or just 
adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, type speciﬁ c blood is 
always kept available 
 Operative Procedure 
 Positioning and Set-Up 
 We prefer to place the patient in a supine position. Once 
the bed is positioned such that the head is slightly elevated 
and the neck slightly ﬂ exed, we secure the head with three-
point skeletal ﬁ xation. This places the site of the planned 
craniotomy at the highest point in the operative ﬁ eld. Intra-
operatively, we can use the Trendelenberg or reverse Tren-
delenberg settings to maneuver the bed when approaching 
the posterior or anterior callosum, respectively. All pressure 
points are generously padded and we ensure that the neck 
and chin are positioned to avoid obstructing the endotra-
cheal tube or jugular venous return. 
 Other centers have experienced equal success position-
ing the patient in the lateral decubitus position with the 
nondominant hemisphere dependent. The purpose of this 
is to allow gravity induced retraction of the nondominant 
hemisphere without the use of brain retractors. A possible 
disadvantage of this approach is that midline orientation 
may become distorted. 
 We, along with almost all centers today, use image-guided 
surgical navigation (frameless stereotaxy) routinely for cal-
losal sectioning. After the patient is satisfactorily positioned, 
we enter the previously placed ﬁ ducials to achieve highly 
accurate registration. 
 Exposure 
 Several types of skin incisions can be made to perform cal-
losal sectioning. At our center, we use a U-shaped scalp ﬂ ap 
with the open end toward the ear  ( Fig. 10.1 ) . The closed end 
of the U extends slightly across midline. The surgeon should 
be cognizant to remain behind the hairline with the ante-
rior limb of the scalp ﬂ ap if possible. We approach via the 
nondominant side unless there is extensive pathology in the 
dominant hemisphere. The scalp ﬂ ap is retracted laterally. 
Straight line (both vertical and horizontal) and bicoronal 
incisions have been advocated by others. If a second-stage 
posterior callosotomy seems likely, a straight line incision 
may be preferred to allow easier extension. 
 The craniotomy should go at least to, if not slightly across, 
midline so that the superior sagittal sinus is fully exposed. 
This facilitates interhemispheric retraction and dissection. 
For anterior callosotomy, the anterior-posterior length of 
the bone ﬂ ap should be 6 to 8 cm. Two thirds of the bone 
ﬂ ap is anterior to the coronal suture and one third is behind. 
The necessary lateral exposure is only 3 to 4 cm. At least 2 
or 3 bur holes are placed along the midline and 2 more are 
placed laterally. The dura is carefully separated from the 
inner table of the skull, and special care is taken along the 
sagittal sinus. A high-speed craniotome is used to complete 
the craniotomy  ( Fig. 10.1 ) . Epidural tack-up sutures may 
be placed at this point, upon dural closure, or not placed at 
all, depending on the surgeon’s preference. Most bleeding 
along the midline can be stopped with a surgical hemostatic 
agent such as Surgicel or Gelfoam and an overlying cotto-
noid patty. 
 Callosal Sectioning 
 The dura is opened in a U-shaped fashion and ﬂ apped to-
ward the sagittal sinus. This allows for careful inspection 
for arachnoid granulations and cortical veins draining into 
the sinus as midline is approached. At this stage the ve-
nous anatomy along the midline can be carefully assessed. 
Arachnoid bands tethering these veins are sharply dis-
sected. There are usually multiple corridors between veins 
for interhemispheric dissection. If at all possible, no drain-
ing veins are sacriﬁ ced. A self retaining Greenberg retractor  
is placed along the medial edge of the exposed hemisphere. 
The cortex is buffered by a Telfa patty prior to retractor 
placement. A second retractor is usually placed along the 
falx to widen the operative ﬁ eld. The remainder of the dis-
section and callosal sectioning are performed using the op-
erating microscope.

 As the retractors are able to be advanced deeper, the cin-
gulate gyri are exposed. Gentle dissection is performed to 
identify a plane between the two. The callosomarginal ar-
teries are often seen and appropriately protected at this 
stage. This portion of the exposure is often the most dif-
ﬁ cult, especially when previous infection or trauma has led 
to scarring. Once the cingulate gyri are separated and the 
retractors are advanced, the glistening white surface of the 
corpus callosum is identiﬁ ed  ( Fig. 10.2 ) . The paired peri-
callosal arteries should be identiﬁ ed on the surface of the 
callosum. Gentle technique must be used to avoid injury 
to these critical vessels. This dissection is repeated in an 
anterior-posterior direction until the anterior two thirds 
(posteriorly to the mid body-posterior body junction) of 
the callosum is exposed. 
 The callosotomy is begun anteriorly. Depending on the 
vascular anatomy, the callosum is sectioned either be-
tween or lateral to the pericallosal arteries. Gentle suction 
and bipolar coagulation with micro forceps are used to di-
vide the callosum. Midline orientation may be periodically 
conﬁ rmed using surgical navigation. Ideally, callosal sec-
tion will lead to the cleft between the leaves of the septum 
pellucidum  ( Fig. 10.3 ) . Entry into the lateral ventricles is 
avoided. If there is a breach in the ependyma, it is covered 
with a cottonoid patty to prevent entry of blood products 
into the ventricle. The division is continued in an anterior to 
posterior fashion until sectioning of the anterior two-thirds 
is stereotactically conﬁ rmed. 
 If a second-stage completion callosotomy is required, a 
separate craniotomy is performed. The patient is positioned 
in a similar fashion with the head slightly more ﬂ exed. The 
anterior aspect of this craniotomy corresponds to the pos-
terior aspect of the initial craniotomy. It extends 6 cm pos-
teriorly with its center 2 or 3 cm anterior to the lambda. 
The posterior interhemispheric dissection is facilitated by 
the deeper falx and the dearth of bridging veins in this re-
gion. The posterior body and splenium are sectioned using 
the same technique described earlier. Upon completion, the 
velum interpositum, the arachnoid over the vein of Galen, 
the prepineal cistern and the quadrigeminal cistern should 
all be visualized. 
 Closure 
 Meticulous hemostasis using the microscope is performed 
when the callosotomy is completed. The area is gently ir-
rigated. A ventricular drain is almost never necessary. The 
lone exception is when the ventricle is entered in a patient 
with preexisting hydrocephalus. The dura is closed in a wa-
tertight fashion. This can nearly always be achieved without 
patching. Epidural tack-up sutures may be placed at this 
stage (if not done at the time of opening). The bone ﬂ ap is 
resecured using titanium miniplates and screws. The scalp 
is closed in two layers. The galea is closed using 2–0 or 3–0 
Vicryl suture and the skin is reapproximated using staples 
or suture (4–0 Nylon or Prolene). 
 Postoperative Care 
 Patients are routinely observed in the intensive care unit 
overnight or longer as needed. They are then transferred to 
regular care until the time of discharge which is typically 
3–5 days after surgery. The head of the bed is kept slightly 
elevated. Blood pressure control is strictly maintained, with 
intravenous antihypertensive drips if needed, to help pre-
vent postoperative hemorrhage. Prophylactic antibiotics are 
given for 24 hours after surgery. Steroids are tapered over 
the course of 10 to 14 days and are given with an H2 blocker 
or proton pump inhibitor. The patient is normally main-

tained on the anticonvulsant regimen for at least 2 weeks 
after surgery at which time alterations may be made per 
the epileptologist’s discretion. The decision about need for 
a second-stage completion operation is typically not made 
for 2 to 6 months after the initial operation. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The alterations in surgical technique introduced by Wilson 
and advanced by others have signiﬁ cantly lowered the mor-
bidity of callosal sectioning. Complications such as wound 
infection, meningitis, or hematoma occur at the same rate 
as with craniotomy for other pathology (1–2%). Most deaths 
occur secondary to pulmonary complications and have be-
come increasingly unusual as patients are often mobilized 
starting on the ﬁ rst postoperative day. 
 Two postoperative neurological syndromes occasionally 
occur after callosotomy. Immediately after anterior callos-
otomy alone, some patients may develop decreased sponta-
neity of speech in association with varying degrees of pare-
sis of the contralateral extremities. The syndrome is nearly 
identical to the super mesenteric artery syndrome, which 
has been described after resection of tumors located in or 
near the dominant supplementary motor area. The similar 
ﬁ ndings in callosotomy patients may arise secondary to re-
traction injury to the supplementary motor area, though our 
approach usually involves the nondominant hemisphere. 
There is no speciﬁ c treatment for this syndrome. Postop-
erative imaging may be performed to exclude hematoma or 
infarct. The symptoms nearly always resolve within days to 
weeks after surgery. 
 The splenium of the corpus callosum is the major route for 
interhemispheric sensory transfer. Following complete or 
isolated posterior callosotomy, true interhemispheric sen-
sory disconnection can occur. The posterior disconnection 
syndrome does not allow the dominant hemisphere to rec-
ognize visual or tactile inputs that are presented only to the 
nondominant hemisphere. This syndrome appears to occur 
much less often when a complete callosotomy is performed 
in a staged fashion. Even when it does occur, studies have 
shown that it is rarely disabling or bothersome to patients. 
This may be secondary to the poor baseline neurological 
function of callosotomy patients. 
 Postoperative language deﬁ cits have been noted by some  
when callosotomy was performed on patients with mixed 
cerebral dominance. These deﬁ cits occurred independent of 
whether anterior or complete callosotomy was performed. 
 Certain seizure types may tend to worsen or even occur 
for the ﬁ rst time after callosal sectioning. Partial seizures 
and, less often, absence seizures may become more frequent 
after surgery. One potential etiology for this phenomenon 
includes removal of inhibitory signals normally relayed 
by an intact corpus callosum. Another possibility is that, 
though the generalization component of a secondarily gen-
eralized seizure may be successfully removed, the inciting 
partial component remains. 
 Conclusions 
 Corpus callosotomy is a safe and effective palliative pro-
cedure for medically refractory epilepsy when no resect-
able lesion is identiﬁ ed. This is especially true when drop 
attacks or generalized seizures are the main types. Use of 
the microscope, staged operation for complete callosotomy, 
and leaving other midline commissures untouched have de-
creased the morbidity of the procedure. Preoperative coun-
seling of the patient and family is crucial to setting realistic 
goals and optimizing surgical outcome. Most neurological 
complications after callosotomy are fortunately temporary 
or clinically unapparent. As the long-term outcome of VNS 
placement, a callosotomy alternative, is still unknown, the 
role for corpus callosotomy may change in the future.

 Vagus Nerve Stimulation for Intractable 
Epilepsy 
 Charles Y. Liu , Arun Paul Amar , Michael L.  Levy, and  Michael L. J. Apuzzo 
  Epilepsy affects up to 1% of the general population. It is the 
most prevalent neurological condition that affects people of 
all ages and is the second most common neurological disor-
der overall. Satisfactory seizure control remains elusive in 
30–40% of patients. About half of these patients have partial 
onset seizures, and in the United States alone, there are at 
least 300,000 people with medically refractory seizures of 
partial onset. Only 30,000 to 100,000 of these patients are 
candidates for temporal lobectomy, focal cortical resection, 
callosotomy, hemispherectomy, subpial transection, and 
other intracranial procedures. 
 Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with the NeuroCybernetic 
Prosthesis (NCP) system from Cyberonics, Inc. (Houston, TX, 
USA) has been an important adjunct in the management 
of patients with intractable seizures. This device delivers 
intermittent electrical stimulation to the left cervical vagus 
nerve trunk, which secondarily transmits rostral impulses to 
exert widespread effects on neuronal excitability through-
out the central nervous system. The exact mechanism by 
which VNS reduces seizure frequency is unknown. 
 Patient Selection 
 Clinical experience with VNS began in 1988 with the ﬁ rst 
human implant of the NCP system. Since then, more than 
1000 patients have participated in 7 clinical trials through-
out 26 countries, and more than 3000 patient-years of data 
have accrued. These studies conﬁ rm the long-term safety, 
efﬁ cacy, feasibility, and tolerability of VNS, as well as the 
durability of the NCP device. VNS gained approval by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997. 
 With respect to epilepsy, the device is approved by the 
FDA “as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of 
seizures in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age with 
partial onset seizures which are refractory to antiepileptic 
medications.” However, seizures have been reduced with 
off-label use among children younger than 12 years and pa-
tients with primarily generalized seizures. Patients with both 
idiopathic epilepsy and seizures of structural etiology are 
considered candidates. Seizure frequency and type, severity 
of attacks, drug toxicity, and overall impact on quality of life 
must all be considered before a patient is deemed refractory 
to pharmacotherapy. Patient compliance and sufﬁ cient trials 
of investigational drugs must also be monitored. 
 At present, we do not consider the NCP device an alterna-
tive to conventional methods of epilepsy surgery that of-
fer a higher likelihood of stopping seizures. Patients should 
undergo an extensive diagnostic algorithm that may include 
video monitoring, brain imaging, invasive or scalp electroen-
cephalography, and neuropsychological testing to ascertain 
their eligibility for temporal lobectomy, focal cortical resec-
tion, subpial transection, callosotomy, hemispherectomy, 
or other treatment strategies. A discussion of the relative 
advantages of such procedures versus those of VNS should 
then ensue. 
 The NCP system cannot be inserted in patients who have 
undergone a prior left cervical vagotomy. Furthermore, rel-
ative contraindications include progressive neurologic or

systemic diseases, pregnancy, cardiac arrhythmia, asthma, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active peptic ulcer 
disease, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Neurosurgeons are the ideal candidates for performing these 
surgeries, because they play active roles in comprehensive 
epilepsy programs and participate in decisions about which 
patients should initiate VNS therapy. 
 By way of anatomic review, the vagus nerve lies in the 
carotid sheath wedged between the internal jugular vein 
and the carotid artery. The sternocleidomastoid muscle lies 
lateral and anterior to the sheath; the sympathetic trunk lies 
deep and posterior. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, which 
supplies all muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid, 
lies medially in the tracheoesophageal groove. Electrode 
model drills with practice devices supplied by the manu-
facturer help familiarize the surgeon with the technique and 
strategy of electrode placement. Finally, before the ﬁ rst VNS 
system is inserted, team rehearsals should be conducted to 
review the room organization and reduce trafﬁ c. This may 
minimize the risk of hardware infection during the actual 
procedure. 
 Figure 11.1   depicts a schematic representation of VNS 
therapy. A pulse generator inserted in the subcutaneous tis-
sues of the upper left chest delivers intermittent electrical 
stimulation to the cervical vagus nerve trunk via a bifur-
cated helical lead. The left side is chosen because anatomical 
studies in dogs suggest that the efferent projections of the 
vagus nerve are asymmetric, and that the right side prefer-
entially supplies the sinoatrial node of the heart and the left 
side preferentially innervates the atrioventricular node. 
 The components of the currently implanted NCP system 
consist of a model 102 pulse generator, a model 302 lead, 
and several peripheral components, such as a telemetry 
wand that interrogates and programs the pulse generator 
noninvasively  ( Figs. 11.2 A,B,C,D) . This programming wand 
is interfaced with a handheld computer that runs a menu-
based software package furnished by Cyberonics. The sys-
tem also includes a handheld magnet that patients may 
carry to alter the character of stimulation that the genera-
tor delivers. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The operation takes less than 2 hours and is typically per-
formed under general anesthesia. However, regional cervical

blocks have also been used in conscious patients. Although it 
can be performed as an outpatient procedure, it may be de-
sirable to observe patients overnight for vocal cord dysfunc-
tion, dysphagia, respiratory compromise, or seizures induced 
by anesthesia, even though these complications are rare. 
 Prophylactic antibiotics are administered for 24 hours 
perioperatively. 
 Following endotracheal intubation, we rotate the table 90 
degrees clockwise from the anesthesia setup, which thus 
lies alongside the patient’s right foot. This facilitates the 
interaction of the various members present, including the 
surgeon, scrub technician, assistant, and neurophysiology 
technician. 
 The patient is positioned supine with mild neck extension 
to facilitate passage of the tunneling tool that connects the 
two incisions. The head is rotated 30 to 45 degrees toward 
the right, bringing the left sternocleidomastoid muscle into 
prominence. 
 A 5-cm lateral incision is made along the anterior fold of 
the axilla, and the underlying fat is dissected to the level of 
the pectoralis fascia  ( Fig. 11.3 A) . Alternative locations to ac-
commodate the pulse generator have also been described. 
 Next, a transverse 5-cm incision is made along a skin 
crease similar to that used for a C5–6 anterior cervical dis-
cectomy. Alternatively, a longitudinal skin incision can be 
made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid 
muscle centered on its midpoint. The platysma muscle is 
divided vertically, and the investing layer of deep cervical 
fascia is opened along the anterior border of the sterno-
cleidomastoid, allowing it to be mobilized laterally. After 
the carotid pulse is palpated, the neurovascular bundle is 
identiﬁ ed and sharply incised to reveal its contents. Self-
retaining retractors with blunt blades expedite this stage of 
the procedure. Care is taken to limit the exposure between 
the omohyoid muscle and the common facial vein complex 
to minimize potential hazards to adjacent neurovascular 
structures. 
 Within the carotid sheath at the level of the thyroid car-
tilage, the vagus nerve is generally encountered deep and 
medial to the internal jugular vein, encased in ﬁ rm areolar 
tissue lateral to the common carotid artery. There is vari-
ability in the relative positions of these structures, and the 
technique for isolating the nerve from the remainder of the 
neurovascular bundle must account for this diversity. We 
attempt to minimize direct manipulation of the nerve. 
 Next, the nerve trunk is identiﬁ ed and dissected with the 
aid of the operating microscope or surgical loupes for at 
least 3–4 cm of length. Insertion of a blue background plas-
tic sheet or vessel loops between the nerve and the under-
lying vessels greatly facilitates the subsequent steps of the 
procedure  ( Fig. 11.3 B) . 
 A tunneling tool is then used to create a subcutaneous 
tract between the two incisions  ( Fig. 11.4 ) . The tool is di-
rected from the cervical to pectoral sites to minimize poten-
tial injury to the vascular structures of the neck. 
 Depending on the relative size of the exposed nerve, ei-
ther a small or a large helical electrode is then selected for 
insertion. The lead connector pin is passed through the tun-
nel and emerges from the chest incision; the helical elec-
trodes remain exposed in the cervical region. 
 Each coil is applied by grasping the suture tail at either 
end and stretching the coil until its convolutions are elimi-
nated  ( Fig. 11.5 A) . The central turn of this unfurled coil is 
applied either obliquely or perpendicularly across or be-
neath the vagus trunk and wrapped around the surface of 
the nerve  ( Fig. 11.5 B) . The coil is then redirected parallel to 
the nerve as the remaining loops are applied proximal and 
distal to this midpoint  ( Fig. 11.5 C) . The memory within the 
elongated coil will cause it to reassume its helical conﬁ gura-
tion and conform to the nerve snugly. Either the positive or 
the negative terminal may be applied ﬁ rst, but the anchor-
ing tether is generally applied last  ( Fig. 11.5 D) . 
 While all these maneuvers are taking place, additional 
electrodiagnostic testing of the generator is simultaneously 
performed between the neurology team and the scrub tech-
nician. Once the generator passes this pre-implant diagnos-
tic test, it is ready for insertion. 
 The lead connector pin is connected to the pulse genera-
tor and secured to their receptacles with set screws, using 
the hexagonal torque wrench. It is important to completely 
insert the hex wrench into its socket in the epoxy header, to 
decompress the backpressure that builds up as the connec-

tor pin enters the receptacle. This step is essential to form 
a good contact between the lead and the generator. If the 
connector pin fails to make such contact, the generator may 
attempt to overcome the resulting increased impedance 
by augmenting the output current, leading to intermittent 
symptoms of overstimulation. 
 Additional electrodiagnostic examination is then per-
formed to appraise the coupling of all connections and 
to verify the integrity of the overall system followed by a 
lead test. During this test stimulation, the response of the 
patient’s vital signs and electrocardiogram are monitored. 
Rarely, profound bradycardia will result, necessitating the 
use of atropine. The incidence of this event is thought to be 
on the order of 1 in 1000. If it occurs, attention should be di-
rected to the lead to ensure that the electrodes encircle the 
vagus nerve trunk rather than one of its cardiac branches. 
After the test stimulation, the generator is restored to its 
inactive status until 1 to 2 weeks postoperatively. This wait-
ing period allows postoperative edema to resolve and the 
electrode to ﬁ xate properly to the nerve. 
 The redundant portion of the lead between the genera-
tor and electrode is secured to several areas of the cervical 
fascia with Silastic tie-downs  ( Figs. 11.6 A, B) . The objec-
tive is to form superﬁ cial and deep restraint conﬁ gurations 
that help prevent excessive traction from being transmitted 
to the electrodes during repetitive neck motion. First, a U-

shaped strain relief bend is made inferior to the anchoring 
tether, and the distal lead is secured to the fascia of the 
carotid sheath. Next, a strain relief loop is established by se-
curing the lead to the superﬁ cial cervical fascia between the 
sternocleidomastoid and platysma muscles. Care is taken 
not to sew the lead directly to the muscle. 
 Finally, the generator is retracted into the subcutaneous 
pocket and secured to the pectoralis fascia with O-Prolene 
or similar nonabsorbable suture, using the suture hole con-
tained within the polyurethane header. Any excess lead is po-
sitioned in a separate pocket at the side of the generator. To 
prevent abrasion of the lead, however, it should not be placed 
behind the pulse generator. Wound closure then proceeds in 
standard multilayer fashion, using a subcuticular stitch for 
the skin. The cosmetic results are generally very good. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 A recent meta-analysis of 454 patients enrolled in one of 5 
controlled clinical trials suggests that the response of in-
dividual patients to VNS varies widely. Although 1–2% of 
subjects enjoy complete seizure cessation, others derive no 
beneﬁ t, and the remainder experience intermediate results. 
The proportion of patients who sustain a 50% reduction in 
baseline seizure frequency is about 43%. This ﬁ gure is simi-
lar to the initial results of many new drug trials, but VNS 
differs signiﬁ cantly in that its efﬁ cacy is maintained dur-
ing prolonged stimulation, and unlike the case with chronic 
antiepileptic medication, overall seizure control improves 
with time. The median reduction in seizure frequency for 
the entire group was 35% at 1 year, 43% at 2 years, and 44% 
at 3 years. In general, long-term continuation rates are high, 
reﬂ ecting the unique proﬁ le of safety, efﬁ cacy, and tolerabil-
ity that VNS provides. 
 Adverse effects are typically transient, mild, and limited 
to cycles of stimulation. Initially, patients may experience 
voice alteration (20–30%), paresthesias (10%), or cough (6%), 
but these side effects diminish greatly over time. Surgical 
complications are rare but include infection requiring expla-
nation (about 1%), vocal cord injury (less than1%), and lower 
facial paresis (less than 1%). Physiologic perturbations are 
highly unusual, and device failures are uncommon. 
 The most common reason for revising the NCP is for de-
pleted pulse generator battery. This is done with a very sim-
ple outpatient procedure under local anesthesia. Depending 
on whether the implanted device consisted of the current 
single pin model 302 lead or an older model 300 double pin 
lead, a model 102 or model 102R pulse generator is used. Cy-
beronics keeps a database of implanted devices that can be 
easily accessed to verify the correct replacement generator. 
Care should be taken to insert the connector pins in the right 
orientation in double pin model 102R replacement units. 
 In rare circumstances, the spiral electrodes of the NCP 
system may need to be detached from the vagus nerve. Indi-
cations for lead removal include patients who fail to derive 
any therapeutic beneﬁ t or suffer intolerable side effects, 
lead fracture or other equipment malfunction, or the need 
for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and body, 
which is otherwise contraindicated while the electrodes re-
main in situ. 
 Fibrosis in the vicinity of the electrodes has engendered 
concern about the potential for injury to the nerve during 
electrode removal. One option is to simply cut off the distal 
lead and leave the electrodes attached; if less than 10 cm of 
the lead wire remains, MRI with body coils becomes per-
missible. However, electrodes retained on the vagus nerve 
trunk may restrict the space available for new electrodes. 
With careful dissection, complete removal of the existing 
coils and replacement with new electrodes can be safely 
performed even years after implantation. A plane can gener-
ally be established between the most cephalad attachment 
and the vagus nerve. Thereafter, the spiral electrodes and 
anchoring tether can be dislodged from cranially to caudally 
by introducing the tips of a small scissor into this plane and 
gently prying open the helices. Because the suture tails on 
the coils are considered to be responsible for much of the 
ﬁ brosis, some have advocated cutting off those tails after 
the device is implanted.

  Microvascular Decompression for Trigeminal 
Neuralgia 
 Chandranath  Sen 
  Trigeminal neuralgia is a disorder characterized by uni-
lateral paroxysmal episodes of lancinating pain along one 
or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. It is often idi-
opathic, but can occasionally be the presenting symptom 
of multiple sclerosis or a tumor or vascular malformation. 
The idiopathic variety is more commonly found in women 
older than 50 years. The etiology of idiopathic trigeminal 
neuralgia is believed to be a hyperactive dysfunction of 
the trigeminal nerve caused by a cross compression of the 
trigeminal root at its exit from the brain stem by an artery or 
a vein or both. Although the proposed cause of this disorder 
was initially described by Dandy and then by Gardner, the 
operation for microvascular decompression was popular-
ized by Jannetta  in the late 1960s and is a widely accepted 
treatment option for this disorder. 
 Patient Selection 
 On physical examination, these patients have no neurological 
deﬁ cit except for perhaps very slight hypoesthesia in the re-
spective trigeminal distribution. The patient’s general medi-
cal condition and physiological state should also be evalu-
ated. The diagnosis is, however, based on the typical history. 
The pain is intermittent and between the attacks the patient 
is free of pain. The pain is commonly in the third division and 
is triggered by touching the face, washing, talking, and chew-
ing. A contrast magnetic resonance image scan is performed 
initially when diagnosed to rule out a structural lesion. 
 Drug therapy is the usual ﬁ rst line of treatment. It is initi-
ated with carbamazepine. This is effective in most patients; 
however, the natural history of the disorder is punctuated by 
spontaneous remissions. Some patients are intolerant to the 
drug or develop adverse reactions requiring discontinuation 
of the carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine is better tolerated by 
patients and can be the initial drug of choice. Other drugs 
can also be used secondarily, but these are less effective. 
When drug treatment fails, surgical therapy is considered. 
Microvascular decompression by a posterior fossa craniec-
tomy is one treatment option. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The operation is performed under general anesthesia with 
endotracheal intubation. The patient is given a dose of van-
comycin and tobramycin 30 to 60 minutes before the inci-
sion. Steroid medications have not been found to be of use 
in this operation. A supine or a lateral decubitus position is 
used for the operation, so the probability of air embolism 
is much lower than when the patient is in a sitting posi-
tion. A precordial Doppler is placed and also the end tidal 
carbon dioxide is monitored to detect such an occurrence. 
An arterial line is routinely used to monitor blood pressure. 
Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is routinely 
used during this operation. Monitoring the brainstem audi-
tory evoked potentials is important to prevent injury to the 
cranial nerve VIII during the procedure. Cranial nerve VIII 
is often injured because the cerebellum is retracted exces-
sively during the operation. 
 Most frequently we use a supine position with the pa-
tient’s head turned to the side opposite to that of the sur-
gery by about 60 degrees and ﬁ xed in a three-point ﬁ xation. 
Because most patients are older, the active range of motion 
of the neck is examined before the anesthesia. If the range 
is diminished or the patient has cervical spine problems or 
a short neck, a lateral decubitus position is used. When the 
patient is placed in a lateral decubitus, a soft axillary roll is 
used under the dependent side of the chest wall to prevent 
brachial plexus injury. The pressure points are thoroughly 
padded and the hip and trunk are secured with adhesive 
taped to the operating table to prevent slippage or move-
ment when the table is rotated. The ipsilateral shoulder is 
pulled down with adhesive tape so it is not in the way of the 
surgeon, again, remaining aware that the brachial plexus of 
that extremity is not stretched. The head is placed neutral 
to the chest in a three-point pin ﬁ xation. 
 Attention to the head position is critical, because subop-
timal positioning can be quite frustrating considering that a 
small incision and craniectomy is used for the surgery. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Incision and Bony Opening 
 A small area of scalp behind the ear is shaved and prepared 
in a sterile manner. A vertical incision is made about 1 inch 
medial to the mastoid tip and the suboccipital region is ex-
posed  ( Fig. 12.1 ) . The asterion is visualized since it indicates 
the approximate location of the junction of the sigmoid and 

80 
II Pain
transverse sinus  ( Fig. 12.2 ) . A small craniectomy is created 
with a high-speed pneumatic drill using a cutting bur to 
expose the inferior edge of the transverse sinus, the sigmoid 
transverse junction, and the medial edge of the sigmoid 
sinus ( Fig. 12.3 ) . The mastoid air cells are often opened and 
should be occluded with bone wax. The edges of the sinuses 
must be exposed to have an optimal opening. The opening 
does not need to extend down to the level of the foramen 
magnum. The dura is opened and reﬂ ected away with stay 
sutures to allow access to the superolateral part of the cer-
ebellar hemisphere at the junction of the tentorium and the 
petrous bone. 
 Exposure of the Trigeminal Nerve and Identiﬁ cation 
of the Microvascular Relationships 
 Under the magniﬁ cation of the operating microscope, the 
lateral supracerebellar infratentorial route is taken to the 
trigeminal nerve. This prevents any lateral to medial re-
traction of the cerebellum which is detrimental to cranial 
nerve VIII. The cerebellum may be quite full initially and 
protrude through the dural opening. A narrow cottonoid 
strip is laid on a strip of rubber dam to gently depress the 
superolateral corner of the cerebellum to allow access to 
the arachnoid membrane near the petrosal venous complex 
and the trigeminal nerve. Opening this arachnoid allows 
sufﬁ cient cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) drainage to give excel-
lent relaxation. This initial move to drain the CSF should 
be made very carefully and under microscope visualization 
to avoid inadvertent tearing of the petrosal vein that can 
pose a problem to control without adequate preparation. 
If this vein ruptures prematurely, the patient’s head is gen-
tly elevated and a cottonoid is placed toward the bleeding 
area. Blind and hasty manipulation in the inferior part of the 
wound is avoided to prevent injury to cranial nerve VIII. If 
the vein has been avulsed from the entry in to the superior 
petrosal sinus, the site is gently packed with Surgicel and 
maintained with a small cottonoid tamponade. The blood 
is then thoroughly washed away so the surgeon can see the 
arachnoid planes. 
 The arachnoid is sharply divided along the cerebello-
mesencephalic ﬁ ssure to allow the cerebellum to fall away 
and expose the trigeminal root. The vestibulocochlear nerve 
bundle is visible at the inferior corner of the exposure. Usu-
ally, after sufﬁ cient arachnoid dissection, the cerebellum falls 
away and the entire area is visualized without a retractor. If 
necessary, a narrow (3–5mm) retractor is placed to expose 
the entire root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve. The direc-
tion of the retraction should be such that the superolateral 
edge of the cerebellum is retracted in an inferomedial direc-
tion, again aimed at minimizing the stretch on the vestibu-
locochlear nerve. The entire course of the trigeminal root 
in the posterior fossa must be fully visualized. None of the 
vascular relations to the nerve are disturbed at this point, 
and the surgeon must be able to inspect the entire nerve 
circumferentially all the way to its entry into the Meckel 
 Fig. 12.1 The location of the incision is indicated in relation to the ear 
and the mastoid bone. 
Fig. 12.2    The bony exposure includes the suboccipital region. The as-
terion, which is marked by the junction of the lambdoidal, mastoidal, 
and squamosal sutures, is exposed. This marks the sigmoid transverse 
junction.

edge of the transverse sinus, the sigmoid transverse junction and the

cave. Occasionally, there may be bony protrusion from the 
petrous bone posterior to the trigeminal root that obscures 
the area where it enters the Meckel cave. To visualize this 
area, the surgeon has to either drill down the protrusion 
or use an endoscope to look around it. The temptation to 
retract more on the cerebellum should be avoided. 
 Neurovascular Relations of the Trigeminal Root 
 The most common offending vessel is a loop of the superior 
cerebellar artery (SCA). Although the vessel courses around 
the pons well above the trigeminal root, it can be redundant 
and loop down below the level of the trigeminal. It usually 
does so medial to the trigeminal root and comes up, and at 
this point pushes into the root entry zone deeply grooving 
the nerve  ( Fig. 12.4 ) . It then dips deeply in to the groove 
between the cerebellum and the mesencephalon before 
traveling onto the superior surface of the cerebellum. The 
SCA bifurcates into a caudal and a rostral trunk after rising 
from the basilar artery. Depending on the location of the 
bifurcation, the compression of the nerve may be caused by 
either the main trunk or the caudal or both the caudal and 
rostral branches. 
 Infrequently, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery may 
compress the nerve root as it loops upward from its origin 
and then dips down toward the vestibulocochlear nerve. A 
dilated and tortuous basilar artery may be a rare source of 
compression. Occasionally the nerve may be compressed by 
two arteries or an artery and a vein. 
 Venous compression of the trigeminal root is less fre-
quently encountered. The complex of superior petrosal 
veins or its tributaries may contact the nerve and indeed 
produce a groove  ( Fig. 12.5 ) . Sometimes the root entry zone 
may be scissored between a branch of the SCA on the su-
peromedial aspect and the vein on the inferolateral aspect.  
These relationships should be clearly deﬁ ned before decom-
pression is begun. 
 Microvascular Decompression 
 When there is only an arterial compression by an SCA loop, 
the vessel is released along a signiﬁ cant length of its course 
by sharp arachnoid dissection before it can be mobilized. 
Perforating branches arise from the artery that should be 
carefully protected and limit the degree to which the vessel 
may be mobilized. The loop of the artery is then mobilized 
away from the nerve and small wisps of shredded Teﬂ on 
(polytetraﬂ uoroethylene or PTFE) felt are placed around the 
nerve and the artery to separate them and maintain them 
in position. During this process there should be no kinks 
in the artery or its branches. Enough felt should be placed 
such that even if the vessel moves after the patient assumes 
an upright posture, the nerve is still protected. In some oc-
casions, the SCA loop can be wrapped in a wisp of Teﬂ on 
felt conﬁ gured like a sling and sutured with an 8–0 nylon 
suture to the tentorium to hold it away from the vicinity of 
the nerve  ( Fig. 12.6 ) . 
 Should the brainstem auditory responses deteriorate at 
any point during the operation, the retractors should be 
relaxed and the surgeon should wait, allowing the potentials 
to recover before proceeding. If there is venous compres-
sion, the offending vein is dissected using sharp arachnoid 
dissection along a length of the vessel. These veins have 
very thin walls and can rupture easily and thus require very 
patient and careful dissection. Depending on the size of the 
vein, it can either be preserved and decompressed (similar 
to an artery using wisps of Teﬂ on felt), or a smaller vein 
 Fig. 12.4    The redundant loop of the superior cerebellar artery is shown 
in an exposure of the patient’s right side. The ascending portion of the 
loop with the caudal and rostral divisions of the artery compressing 
the root entry zone of the trigeminal root is seen. 
Fig. 12.5 The petrosal venous complex is shown with one of the tribu-
taries crossing the lateral aspect of the nerve and compressing the 
root entry zone.

can be coagulated along its course and a segment cut and 
excised. The veins should be dissected off the nerve and the 
brainstem before coagulation to avoid thermal injury to the 
structures. Bipolar coagulation is kept at a low level during 
such maneuvers. All the vascular contacts with the nerve 
are decompressed systematically so that the surgeon does 
not miss any of them. 
 Closure 
 The retractor is removed after hemostasis is conﬁ rmed. The 
dura is closed as watertight as possible and the mastoid air 
cells are again occluded with bone wax. Usually a cranio-
plasty is not necessary because the opening is small. The 
incision is closed in multiple layers and sutures are used on 
the skin to avoid any postoperative CSF leakage. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The patient is watched in an intensive care unit type set-
ting overnight and then on a regular ward. Nausea and 
headaches are controlled symptomatically. Antibiotics are 
continued for 24 hours and no steroids are used. Diet and 
activity are normalized as tolerated. 
 Conclusion 
 Microvascular decompression is successful in producing pain 
relief in 80–90% of patients in the case of typical trigeminal 
neuralgia. In a well-executed operation, no sensory deﬁ cit is 
produced. If there is slight decrease in sensation, it usually 
recovers completely. In this procedure, there is no correla-
tion between postoperative sensory impairment and pain 
relief. When there is a clear and convincing surgical ﬁ nding 
of vascular compression, it correlates well with a successful 
operation. Over a course of 10-year follow up, 10–20% recur-
rence is usually reported.

 Stereotactic Radiosurgery of the Trigeminal 
Nerve Root for the Treatment for Trigeminal 
Neuralgia 
 Ronald F. Young 
 Patient Selection 
 Patients are generally selected for any form of surgical 
therapy of trigeminal neuralgia based on previous failure 
of pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for 
trigeminal neuralgia are (1) sharp, knife-like pain of dura-
tion from a fraction of a second up to several seconds to 
one minute; (2) pain conﬁ ned within one or more of the 
major peripheral divisions of the trigeminal nerve; and (3) 
The presence of trigger zones from which innocuous stimuli 
trigger the patient’s characteristic pain. 
 An additional diagnostic criterion is the response of the 
pain to pharmacological treatment. The most effective phar-
macological treatment is carbamazepine or similar pharma-
cological agents. Other medications in the anticonvulsant 
family such as gabapentin, phenytoin, and Lamictal are less 
effective. 
 Radiosurgery is less damaging than ablative procedures 
such as radiofrequency electrocoagulation, percutaneous 
glycerol rhizotomy, balloon compression, or surgical root 
section, but is nevertheless a form of ablative treatment of 
trigeminal neuralgia. In this context, ablative procedures 
should not be recommended for patients with atypical fa-
cial pain. Some patients who present with histories of facial 
pain of longer duration or associated with constant ach-
ing background pain may be successfully treated by abla-
tive procedures. This is particularly true for patients with 
long-standing trigeminal neuralgia who have been treated 
with carbamazepine. Patients who lack trigger phenomena 
and whose pain extends beyond the trigeminal distribution 
should not be considered for radiosurgical treatment. 
 Patients with recurrent trigeminal neuralgia after other 
surgical procedures may be treated successfully with radio-
surgery. Radiosurgery may also be used to treat trigeminal 
neuralgia related to multiple sclerosis, although the suc-
cess rate seems to be lower in that context. Patients whose 
trigeminal neuralgia is related to structural lesions such as 
tumors and vascular malformations may also be success-
fully treated with radiosurgery, although in that situation, 
the treatment is usually directed at the structural lesion 
rather than at the trigeminal nerve root, the latter of which 
is often not visible on imaging studies and, therefore, cannot 
be used as a target for radiosurgery. 
 There are no true contraindications to radiosurgery as a 
treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Even patients who use 
chronic anticoagulation and are not suitable for any form 
of invasive procedure, be it microvascular decompression 
or any of the percutaneous procedures, can be treated with 
radiosurgery. Likewise, elderly patients who are not suitable 
for the general anesthesia required either for microvascular 
decompression (MVD) or for balloon compression and who 
may not be able to tolerate a procedure such as radiofre-
quency electrocoagulation or glycerol rhizolysis even under 
sedation, may be treated successfully with radiosurgery. A 
relative contraindication to radiosurgery is a patient with 
severe pain, unremitting and unresponsive to medication, 
who requires immediate relief. Typically, after radiosurgery, 
there is a latency period varying from days to months before 
the pain is relieved. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 A preoperative cerebral imaging study is strongly recom-
mended before radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal 
neuralgia. The ideal study is a magnetic resonance image 
(MRI) scan before and after intravenous contrast material 
is administered. Some authors have recommended imaging 
studies designed to determine whether a cross-compress-
ing vascular structure can be identiﬁ ed that is putatively 
responsible for the patient’s trigeminal neuralgia. If such 
a structure is identiﬁ ed, MVD is recommended by some, 
whereas if such a structure is not identiﬁ ed, radiosurgery or 
a percutaneous procedure is considered. Others believe that 
whether or not a vessel can be demonstrated on MRI scan-
ning is unimportant in such a decision because they believe 
that vascular compressing structures are always present, 
whether or not they are visible on scans. It has not been this 
author’s approach to use the demonstration of a vascular 
structure compressing the trigeminal nerve root in the de-
cision-making process. The primary purpose of a preopera-
tive MRI scan is to determine whether a structural lesion is 
present that causes the patient’s trigeminal neuralgia. Such 
knowledge is important in stereotactic radiosurgical treat-
ment planning. Routine preoperative laboratory studies are 
not recommended or considered necessary. Other typical 

84 
II Pain
preoperative studies, such as chest X-ray and electrocardio-
gram, are also considered to be unnecessary for radiosurgi-
cal treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. 
 Preparation for the procedure in our institution involves 
inserting an intravenous line to administer intravenous se-
dation. Typically, midazolam 1 mg and fentanyl 50 to 100 
mcg are used for initial sedation. Larger doses are employed 
for patients with signiﬁ cant anxiety. Monitoring of blood 
oxygenation and electrocardiogram during administration 
of conscious sedation is recommended. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The ﬁ rst step in the operative procedure is to apply the ster-
eotactic frame. I prefer to apply the stereotactic frame with 
the patient in the sitting position, allowing easy access to 
the anterior and posterior aspects of the head to place local 
anesthesia and the ﬁ xation pins. Although for many years, I 
had recommended antiseptic preparation of the skin before 
injecting anesthetic and placing stereotactic pins, I have not 
used this in more than 4 years, and have never seen a case 
of ﬁ xation pin infection. The scalp is inﬁ ltrated with local 
anesthetic, a combination of 0.5% Xylocaine and 0.25% Sen-
sorcaine in a 50/50 mixture and injected at each of the four 
ﬁ xation pin sites. I recommend injecting 5 ml of the mixture 
at each pin site. Xylocaine in the mixture provides virtually 
immediate anesthesia, and Sensorcaine provides lasting an-
esthesia for several hours after the pins are removed. It is 
important to place the stereotactic frame low enough on the 
patient’s head so that the subsequent MRI scan will identify 
the trigeminal nerve root within the stereotactic space de-
ﬁ ned by the stereotactic frame. 
 Once the stereotactic frame has been applied, a noncon-
trast MRI scan is performed. The scan is performed with 
1-mm thick sections so that the images can be reformatted 
in the coronal and sagittal planes  ( Fig. 13.1 ) . 
 The MRI scan data are exported to the treatment plan-
ning computer with appropriate software. For Gamma Knife 
radiosurgery, the GammaPlan (Elektra, Inc., Atlanta, GA) is 
used, and for linear accelerator radiosurgery, appropriate 
treatment planning computer software is used. 
 The isocenter is located in the trigeminal nerve root. Using 
the Gamma Knife, a single isocenter with the 4-mm collima-
tor is employed, and the isocenter is positioned such that 
the 20% isodose line is tangential to the adjacent pontine 
surface  ( Fig. 13.2 ) . It is important to conﬁ rm the location 
of the isocenter on axial, coronal, and reconstructed sagit-
tal MRI scan images. The degree to which one can visualize 
the cisternal segment of the nerve varies from patient to 
patient. All three imaging planes should be used to ensure 
correct localization. 
 Radiosurgical doses between 70 and 90 Gy have been em-
ployed. To ensure consistent and understandable terminol-
ogy, it is important to deﬁ ne for Gamma Knife radiosurgery 
the output factor that is used to calculate and state the radi-
osurgical dose. Older reports of Gamma Knife radiosurgery 
use a 0.8 output factor, and this led to dose prescriptions 
of 70, 80 and 90 Gy at the dose maximum, or 100% isodose 
point. Later, the recommended output factor was increased 
to 0.87, which resulted in the equivalent doses converting 
to 76, 87, and 98 Gy. It is also important to recognize that 
Fig. 13.1 (A) Axial,  (B)  coronal, and  (C)  reconstructed sagittal mag-
netic resonance imaging scans demonstrate the right trigeminal nerve 
root.

dose prescriptions for radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal 
neuralgia are, by convention, stipulated at the 100% isodose 
line. In a comparison done at our facility of more than 250 
patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery for classi-
cal trigeminal neuralgia, we found no signiﬁ cant difference 
in the rate of pain relief at 76, 87, or 98 Gy. Because we did 
ﬁ nd a signiﬁ cant increase in the rate of facial numbness at 
increasing dose prescription levels, we have decreased our 
current typical prescription dose to 87 Gy. 
 For linear accelerator radiosurgery, prescription doses in 
a similar range have been used. A 5 mm collimator with 
linear accelerator (LINAC) radiosurgery provides a similar 
dose distribution to that provided with the Gamma Knife, 
taking into account the appropriate arrangement of arcs for 
LINAC radiosurgery. It is important to emphasize that radio-
surgery is a team effort and that participation and input in 
the procedure from neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, and 
radiation physicist is essential. The ﬁ nalized treatment plan 
should be approved by all three members of the radiosurgi-
cal treatment team. Quality assurance measures should be 
used, depending on the particular radiosurgical device to 
ensure that the treatment plan is performed according to 
the written speciﬁ cations. This applies particularly to con-
ﬁ rmation of the correct collimator, setting of X, Y, and Z 
stereotactic coordinates, and administering the radiosurgi-
cal dose. At the conclusion of the procedure, the stereotactic 
frame is removed. Occasionally, arterial bleeding will be en-
countered, particularly from the pins placed in the occipital 
region, which may encounter the occipital artery. Usually, 
such arterial bleeding can be controlled with digital pres-
sure. Sometimes the inﬁ ltration of an additional amount of 
epinephrine-containing local anesthetic about the area of 
the arterial bleeding will arrest it. Rarely, it may be neces-
sary to place a suture ligature to arrest the bleeding. 
 It has been our policy to perform stereotactic radiosur-
gery as an inpatient procedure and, therefore, when the 
procedure is completed, patients are transferred to the hos-
pital for overnight observation and discharged to return to 
normal activities the following morning. In many centers, 
radiosurgery for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is per-
formed as an outpatient procedure. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 As mentioned earlier, there is typically a latency period af-
ter radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia before 
the pain is relieved. This latency period may vary from as 
short as a few days to as long as 6 months. It has been our 
arbitrary policy to declare treatment failure if the patient 
continues to require medication and continues to have pain. 
For purposes of assessing outcomes, we have categorized 
the results of radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal neural-
gia as follows: 
■  Excellent pain relief. This category identiﬁ es patients 
who are completely free of trigeminal neuralgia pain and 
take no medications.  
■ Good relief. This category encompasses patients who 
have no trigeminal neuralgia pain but still require medi-
cation.

resonance imaging scans demonstrate placement of the treatment iso-
centers for Gamma Knife treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The 20% iso-
dose line is tangential to the surface of the pons.

 ■ Failure. This category encompasses all other treatment 
outcomes. 
 Approximately 60% of patients treated for trigeminal 
neuralgia with radiosurgery will fall into the excellent cat-
egory within 6 months of treatment. Another 30% will fall 
into the good category, and approximately 10% of patients 
will be considered treatment failures. Repeat radiosurgical 
treatment may be used to treat patients who fail to respond 
within the 6-month interval after a ﬁ rst treatment or who 
sustain recurrent trigeminal neuralgia after an initial period 
of successful relief of pain. Since facial numbness, when it 
occurs following radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal neu-
ralgia, typically occurs 6 to 12 months after the radiosurgical 
procedure, I generally recommend waiting at least 1 year 
from the radiosurgical treatment before proceeding with a 
repeat procedure in the event of initial failure. The radio-
surgical dose to be used for a repeat treatment is not clearly 
established. We initially began to use doses of about 50% of 
the original treatment dose, but have gradually increased 
this. Many people recommended repeating the treatment at 
a similar dose to an original treatment, that is, 76 to 98 Gy. 
 The only signiﬁ cant complication of radiosurgical treat-
ment of trigeminal neuralgia is facial numbness. The inci-
dence of facial numbness is directly correlated to the ra-
diosurgical dose used. For radiosurgical doses of 76 Gy, the 
overall rate of facial numbness is about 5–10%, for 87 Gy 15–
25%, and for 98 Gy 25–50%. As mentioned, facial numbness 
after radiosurgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia gener-
ally is evident 6 to 12 months after the procedure. However, 
I have had patients who have developed facial numbness as 
late as 26 months after the procedure. Facial numbness is 
usually temporary and typically recedes or resolves com-
pletely over an interval of 6 to 18 months following its onset. 
Permanent numbness, particularly of a bothersome degree, 
is extremely rare after radiosurgical treatment of trigemi-
nal neuralgia. Perhaps 1% of patients may be expected to 
develop painful dysesthesias after radiosurgical treatment 
of trigeminal neuralgia, but I have not personally seen a 
patient who I would consider to have anesthesia dolorosa. 
It is important to warn patients preoperatively about the 
potential for facial numbness, and particularly to warn them 
about the potential functional problems attendant with fa-
cial numbness. These include difﬁ culty chewing, biting the 
lips or tongue, difﬁ culty speaking, drooling, unpleasant sen-
sations such as the feeling of worms or bugs crawling on the 
face, and the risk of anesthesia dolorosa. Finally, patients 
should be warned of the risk of corneal numbness and loss 
of the corneal reﬂ ex, with the risk of neuroparalytic kerati-
tis, corneal ulceration, or loss of vision. 
 A rare patient, perhaps 0.5% or less, may develop irrita-
tion of the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve with invol-
untary contraction of the masseter muscles. This problem 
generally resolves spontaneously and completely, although 
6 to 18 months may lapse before it resolves completely. Oc-
casionally patients also develop numbness in the occipital 
region of the scalp subsequent to the procedure. This re-
sults from either direct injection of local anesthetic into the 
greater occipital nerve, or placement of a ﬁ xation pin into 
the greater occipital nerve. This numbness virtually always 
resolves within 6 to 12 weeks. In more than 900 treatments 
of trigeminal neuralgia with radiosurgery, I have never seen 
a case of radiation necrosis of the brainstem providing that 
the appropriate collimator size, isocenter positioning, and 
in the case of linear accelerator treatment, arc number and 
arrangements have been used.

 Percutaneous Balloon Compression for 
Trigeminal Neuralgia 
 Jeffrey A. Brown and Julie G. Pilitsis 
  In the 1950s, neurosurgeons frequently performed intraop-
erative manipulation of the trigeminal ganglion, and maxil-
lary and mandibular divisions to treat trigeminal neuralgia 
(TN) pain. Based on this concept, Sean Mullan introduced 
the technique of percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) 
for TN in 1983. Since that ﬁ rst publication, results from more 
than 800 PBCs have been reported in the literature. 
 Patient Selection 
 Intermittent, one-sided, sharp, electric shock-like pain in 
one or more of the trigeminal distributions are characteris-
tic of classical TN (Burchiel type 1).The pain is often relieved 
with an anticonvulsant such as carbamazepine. Once the 
diagnosis of TN has been established, magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the trigeminal nerve should be obtained 
using T1-weighted 1 mm axial slices through the pons. This 
technique will identify a secondary cause of TN, such as 
a trigeminal schwannoma or an arteriovenous malforma-
tion and may show compression on the nerve by a vein 
or an artery. Even if a secondary cause of TN is present, 
PBC may remain a reasonable surgical option. The selection 
of a surgical approach depends on many factors, including 
general health, concerns about the morbidity of a posterior 
fossa operation, and pain division. Young patients are can-
didates for PBC if they are willing to accept the mild numb-
ness postoperatively. Contralateral jaw weakness is not a 
contraindication, despite temporary masseter and pterygoid 
weakness. PBC produces little to no injury of unmyelinated 
ﬁ bers and thus is well-tolerated in ﬁ rst division TN. PBC 
rarely causes anesthesia dolorosa and is performed under 
general anesthesia, limiting the pain and anxiety inherent 
to other percutaneous procedures. In addition, the cannula 
does not pass through the foramen ovale, reducing the small 
but signiﬁ cant risks of intracranial needle penetration. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 An MRI or computed tomography scan is performed in the 
initial screening. A submental skull X-ray can identify pa-
tients in whom the foramen ovale is not easily visualized or 
in whom the diameter is too narrow to allow penetration of 
the balloon. Preoperative clearance should include an elec-
trocardiogram since the mean age of patients is 65 years; 
an EKG also identiﬁ es patients with cardiac arrhythmias 
who may be at risk when the expected bradycardia occurs 
during PBC. Oral acyclovir may be given before surgery to 
patients with recurrent cold sores, in an effort to alleviate 
a postoperative outbreak. There is limited clinical evidence 
to support its effectiveness. 
 Operative Procedure 
 PBC is performed in the angiography suite where multiplane 
ﬂ uoroscopy is available or in the operating room with a 
portable ﬂ uoroscope. Light general anesthesia is induced, 
then an external pacemaker is placed on the patient set 
to trigger at 45 beats per minute. It is tested before drap-
ing. The pacer blocks the bradycardia more rapidly than 
atropine, but if it persists, 0.4 mg atropine can be given 
intravenously. The expected depressor response consists of 
bradycardia and brief hypotension, often with reﬂ exive hy-
pertension. Atropine inhibits the depressor response and is 
not given preoperatively. 
 The patient is positioned supine with a roll under the 
shoulders, in 15 degrees of extension. The face is rotated 
15 to 30 degrees to the opposite side. Because older pa-
tients often have cervical spondylosis, further motion may 
be limited. The perioral region is sterilely prepared. The eyes 
are lubricated and taped shut. The entry point is marked 
on the cheek 2.5 cm lateral to the angle of the lip in a skin 
crease. For ﬁ rst division pain, this mark is placed slightly 
more lateral. Towels are placed to isolate the site, followed 
by a larger drape to cover the body. The pressure monitor is 
then ﬁ xed to an adjacent pole. The ﬂ uoroscope is draped. A 
US Food and Drug Administration-approved PBC kit is avail-
able that includes sharp and blunt trocars, an introducing 
cannula, curved and straight stylets, and a #4 balloon (Cook 
Vascular, Inc., Leechburg, PA, USA). The insoufﬂ ation syringe 
(Merit Medical, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) is connected to 
the balloon and measures intraluminal pressures, with a 
target pressure of 1.3–1.6 atmospheres. Pressure need not be 
measured, but may aid in measuring the degree of compres-
sion. The balloon is inﬂ ated with 0.75–1.0 of contrast until a 
pear shape is observed, though this shape may vary. 
 A # 11 blade is used to nick the skin. This incision should 
accommodate the cannula easily, but should not be so large as

to require suturing at the end of the procedure. The 45 degree 
sharp obturator is placed in the cannula to puncture the skin. 
It is then replaced with the blunt obturator. The entry point 
should allow the cannula to approach the ﬂ oor of the middle 
fossa at a slope nearly parallel to the petrous bone for third 
division pain. For maxillary division pain the angle is more 
oblique. For ﬁ rst division pain the obliquity is even greater. 
Regardless, it is essential to understand that the cannula does 
not pass beyond the foramen ovale. Only the guiding stylets 
and balloon catheter are inserted intracranially  ( Fig. 14.1 ) . 
 A submental view is obtained once the cannula has 
reached the skull base and is used repeatedly during its 
advancement to the foramen ovale. The approach angle is 
essentially parallel to the ﬂ uoroscopy. In this view, the im-
aging unit is directed at an angle of about 29 degrees under 
the chin. The neck is slightly extended and the head later-
ally rotated 15 degrees to the opposite side. The foramen 
ovale is seen medial to the mandible, lateral to the maxilla, 
and directly above the petrous bone. When the foramen is 
engaged, the depressor response may brieﬂ y occur. The sur-
geon should feel some resistance on the cannula, as though 
its sides were gripped, while it engages. The cannula should 
not penetrate any further. No cerebrospinal ﬂ uid will be ob-
tained, since the cannula has not entered the subarachnoid 
space surrounding the trigeminal ganglion. This is different 
from the expectations about positioning that occurs with 
glycerol and thermal rhizotomy. 
 Once the cannula has engaged the foramen ovale, the 
blunt obturator is removed and a straight guiding stylet 
is inserted. Venous bleeding may occur from the epidural 
veins as a straight guiding stylet is inserted and passes just 
beyond the cannula and the inner aspect of the foramen 
ovale. In addition, the surgeon may feel a characteristic pop, 
similar to the tactile feeling noted when performing a lum-
bar puncture. If excessive resistance to stylet entry occurs, 
the cannula may not be correctly positioned. 
 An anterior-posterior view is then obtained, with the 
petrous bone centered in the ipsilateral orbit. The medial 
dip in the petrous bone is the proximal entrance to the 
Meckel cave, the porus trigeminus  ( Fig. 14.2 ) . The stylet 
is directed to the center of the porus for second division 
pain or multidivisional pain, the lateral porus for third divi-
sion pain, and the medial porus for ﬁ rst division pain. In 
patients with ﬁ rst division pain, the cannula is aimed from 
a more lateral to medial position so the stylet may pass to 
the medial porus. The porus is located about 17 mm beyond 
the foramen ovale. The system is designed so that when the 
cannula is placed at the foramen ovale, it is not possible to 
pass the guiding stylet beyond the porus into the posterior 
fossa. The curved stylet may allow greater mobility within 
the porus. Its curve should be directed caudally during pas-
sage through the cannula. The tip is then rotated superome-
dially once beyond the cannula to decrease the risk of dural 
perforation. If the dura is perforated, the stylet should be 
redirected to remain interdural. The only indication of du-
ral perforation may be a lack of pear shape during inﬂ ation 
despite images indicating appropriate positioning. 
 A lateral view is then obtained, keeping the ﬂ uoroscopy 
parallel to the skull base, and is used for the actual compres-
sion. The planum sphenoidale and posterior clinoids will be 
superimposed. For second or third division pain, the stylet 
remains parallel and adjacent to the petrous bone. For ﬁ rst 
division pain, the stylet should be placed more superiorly 
above the petrous bone. Once the proper trajectory is es-
tablished, the stylet is removed and the balloon catheter 
placed. The catheter has a thin radio-opaque inner wire. 
 The tip of the balloon should be placed at the edge of the 
petrous bone for third division pain. For ﬁ rst division pain 
the balloon is positioned about 2 mm posterior to the petrous 
edge in a superomedial direction because the ﬁ rst division 
ﬁ bers are located superiorly in the trigeminal root. The third 
division ﬁ bers are located inferiorly. Because the catheter 
is approaching the nerve root from the foramen ovale, it is 
traversing the root obliquely. Once properly positioned, the 
stylet is removed and the blocking device ﬁ rmly secured 
on the catheter at the edge of the cannula, preventing the

skull in the foramen ovale.

balloon from sliding into the posterior fossa when it is in-
ﬂ ated. Air is evacuated from the balloon with a tuberculin 
syringe connected to a three-way stopcock. The balloon is 
only then connected to the insoufﬂ ation syringe and the 
monitor is at a zeroed pressure. 
 The balloon is slowly inﬂ ated while intermittent blood 
pressures and lateral images are observed. When the bal-
loon inﬂ ates within the porus, the characteristic pear shape 
is seen. If the catheter tip is not within the porus, the pear 
shape is not seen, numbness is less, and pain relief is lim-
ited to the third division. At the porus, the distal balloon 
lifts the dura off the ganglion. Proximally, it compresses 
the retrogasserian ﬁ bers against the ﬁ rm edge of the dura 
and the petrous ridge as the dura splits allowing the nerve 
to pass into the Meckel cave. If the balloon ruptures there 
have been no sequelae. If the patient is allergic to the dye 
used, premedication with steroids is suggested. Using a 
# 4 French balloon catheter, the intraluminal balloon pres-
sure is raised to 1.3–1.6 atmospheres. Once that pressure 
is reached and the corresponding pear shape is observed, 
the balloon should be left inﬂ ated for 1 minute or longer 
if more signiﬁ cant numbness is sought  ( Fig. 14.3 ) . The de-
pressor response is usually present and the pacemaker may 
be triggered. There may be an elevation of blood pressure 
after the pacemaker is triggered, which can be controlled 
with anesthetic. After deﬂ ation, the balloon and catheter are 
removed together. If the catheter is inadvertently removed 
separately, cerebrospinal ﬂ uid may drip through the cannula 
because the subarachnoid space surrounding the ganglion 
in the Meckel cave has now been opened. The skin incision 
is compressed against the maxilla for 5 minutes. The entry 
point is covered with a Steri-Strip and Band-Aid. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The patient is transferred to the recovery room and may be 
discharged home a few hours after PBC or remain hospital-
ized until the next day. The patient should be evaluated for 
the adequacy of pain relief. Typically, the patient awakens 
without pain, except for local discomfort at the needle en-
try site. Trigeminal pain may persist for a day or two post-
operatively and then subside. The degree of sensory loss 
should also be assessed. A decrease in touch and pinprick 
sensation occurs in about 66% of patients. Patients may ﬁ nd 
the associated numbness slightly uncomfortable at ﬁ rst, but 
usually adjust in the ﬁ rst 3 to 4 weeks. It generally resolves 
by 3 to 6 months. Pain relief tends to persist even after the 
numbness resolves. Decreased sensation is most common in 
patients with third division pain. Despite absence of sensory 
change, complete pain relief may occur. Rarely, patients re-
port dysesthesias such as unpleasant hypalgesias (decreased 
sensitivity to pain) and hypoesthesias (decreased sensitivity 
to touch). 
 The corneal reﬂ ex is usually not decreased, perhaps be-
cause compression selectively preserves A-delta and C ﬁ b-
ers, making PBC especially useful for ﬁ rst division TN pain. 
Thermal rhizotomy injures all ﬁ ber types at temperatures 
required to create a clinical lesion. Gamma knife radiosur-
gery has similar effects. Glycerol rhizotomy is not easily per-
formed selectively. Mild ipsilateral temporal and masseter 
muscle weakness occurs in 66% of patients, but usually is of 
minimal clinical relevance as patients have avoided using 
that side of their mouths for years. If temporomandibular 
joint pain occurs, it is treated with oral antiinﬂ ammatory 
medication. 
 One study of this procedure using Kaplan-Meier curves 
found a recurrence rate of 26% following PBC, with a mean 
time until recurrence of 18 months. The recurrence rate is 
30% at 10 years. Recurrence rates are higher in patients with 
multiple sclerosis and may reach 50%. Recurrences are gen-
erally managed with carbamazepine or other anticonvul-
sants. If medical therapy fails, the patient may have a repeat 
procedure. Repeat procedures are well tolerated and do not 
have increased technical difﬁ culty. 
 Numerous series have been published over the last 2 dec-
ades and have recognized other infrequent complications. 
One case report described PBC resulting in subarachnoid 
hemorrhage and fatal complications secondary to the sharp 
obturator being used beyond the foramen ovale. A second 
death was observed following rupture of a dural arteriove-
nus ﬁ stula during the procedure. A carotid cavernous ﬁ stula 
and an external carotid ﬁ stula have also been reported. This 
suggests that a cannula with a blunt obturator should be 
used to reach the foramen ovale through the cheek. 
 Conclusions 
 PBC is a simple and effective treatment for TN that has been 
used successfully for more than 2 decades. It is especially 
useful for patients with ﬁ rst division pain because of the 
low risk of corneal keratitis and for patients with multidivi-
sional pain because it does not require multiple lesions; it 
is helpful in patients who are difﬁ cult to communicate with 
during selective thermal rhizotomy. It is a relatively inex-
pensive, when compared with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, 
for example, and is a technically simple operation in a time 
when cost is an issue.

 Percutaneous Retrogasserian Glycerol 
Rhizotomy for Trigeminal Neuralgia 
 L. Dade Lunsford and Douglas S. Kondziolka 
 Patient Selection 
 We generally consider multiple options in all patients who 
require surgical management of their trigeminal neuralgia. 
In general, such patients should be considered refractory 
to or intolerant of medical therapy and have progressively 
more severe pain. Although Gamma Knife (Elektra, Stock-
holm, Sweden) radiosurgery represents the most benign and 
least risky procedure, some patients, especially those who are 
having persistent or severe and chronic attacks of pain that 
interfere with eating, chewing, talking or are losing weight or 
are dehydrated, require a more rapid onset of pain relief. In 
such cases, the more rapid onset of the beneﬁ t obtained by 
glycerol rhizotomy should be strongly considered. 
 Patients must have typical trigeminal neuralgia: sharp, 
lancinating facial pain with pain lasting for seconds to less 
than a minute; occasionally, more lingering pain can be 
noted in patients who have been under chronic medical 
therapy such as carbamazepine or gabapentin. The pain 
should be conﬁ ned to one or more of the major divisions 
of the trigeminal nerve on one side of the face. In addi-
tion, the patient should have a characteristic response to 
medical management and have typical exacerbating factors 
such as light touch trigger zones. We do not believe that 
glycerol rhizotomy or any other potentially ablative proce-
dure should be considered for patients with atypical facial 
pain. Many patients who are considered for percutaneous 
retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy (PRGR) have had previous 
surgical procedures with incomplete pain relief or recur-
rence of their pain. Prior radiofrequency rhizotomy poses 
special problems, as the trigeminal cistern may be difﬁ cult 
to identify with cisternography. 
 Although most patients tend to have lower division (V2 or 
V3) pain, the procedure can be considered for patients with 
V1 pain; special techniques are used to ﬂ oat the glycerol ef-
fect on top of intracisternal contrast. This bathes the upper 
division ﬁ bers more thoroughly in the neurolytic effect of 
glycerol. We have found no difference in response rate to 
glycerol rhizotomy, depending on the divisions of their pain. 
 The general medical condition should strongly be consid-
ered in the selection of a surgical recommendation. Among 
the issues are the patient’s cardiovascular risk factors, blood 
pressure control, and anticoagulation use. We have found 
the risk of percutaneous management by transovale glycerol 
injection to be higher in patients who are on antiplatelet 
agents; this leads to the risk of maxillary hematomas and 
difﬁ culty in penetrating the foramen ovale. Thus our policy 
is to request that all such patients be off antiplatelet agents, 
including aspirin, for at least 1 week before the scheduled 
surgical procedure. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 All patients seen in the outpatient ofﬁ ce should have a high-
resolution imaging study of the skull base, preferably mag-
netic resonance imaging (a tic protocol 1–1.5 mm slices done 
in a volume acquisition stacked through the cranial nerves 
supplemented by a T2-weighted volume acquisition using 
1–2 mm. slices, turning cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) white, 
and thereby showing beautifully the anatomic and vascu-
lar neuro-relationships of the posterior fossa and cranial 
nerves). We also do routine presurgical screening, including 
laboratory studies, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram. 
 After the risks, beneﬁ ts, and alternatives have been thor-
oughly explained, the patient is brought to the operating 
room and treated by our anesthesia team. We do not use 
arterial blood pressure catheters unless the patient has se-
vere hypertension. Sedation is provided beginning with an 
introductory cautious use of intravenous midazolam and 
fentanyl, a potent analgesic. These must be titrated in each 
patient, based on anxiety and blood pressure effects, recall-
ing that the patient will be brought to a semisitting position 
during the procedure at sometime after the needle is placed. 
This position may also affect blood pressure (postural hy-
potension). Women tend to have hypertensive responses 
with transovale penetration or injection of the glycerol, 
whereas men tend to have vasovagal responses. The latter is 
a monosynaptic event, for which the anesthesiologist must 
be prepared to administer Atropine. Some members of our 
anesthesia team prefer to supplement the overall sedation 
using intravenous Propofol, which is quite satisfactory be-
cause sedation is necessary but cooperation is not required 
for intraoperative sensory testing. 

 
15 Percutaneous Retrogasserian Glycerol Rhizotomy for Trigeminal Neuralgia 
91
 We do not routinely use antibiotics, because the risk of 
percutaneous therapy is extremely low if the patient’s face 
is prepped with alcohol, a sterile technique is maintained 
throughout, and ﬁ ngers contaminated by intraoral place-
ment when the needle is initially placed never contact the 
needle. 
 Operative Procedure 
 A small procedure table is placed at easy reach of the sur-
geon. On it are placed a 20-gauge spinal needle, a 2 cc vial of 
sterile anhydrous 99.9% glycerol (prepared at our institution 
by our pharmacy), and a small vial of radio-opaque tanta-
lum powder (many centers consider this optional, although 
we always prefer to have a permanent marker at the target, 
and to have it available in case repeat glycerol rhizotomy is 
needed). Local 1% Xylocaine without epinephrine is used 
for local inﬁ ltration. The patient is positioned supine on 
an X-ray compatible C-arm ﬂ uoroscopic table. A ceiling- or 
ﬂ oor-mounted C-arm ﬂ uoroscope is placed in the anterior-
posterior (AP) direction above the patient’s head  ( Fig. 15.1 ) . 
A cerebellar horseshoe head rest is used to position the 
neck, freeing the occiput and the skull from impairment by 
the C-arm ﬂ uoroscopic imaging. The patient’s neck is kept 
in a neutral position straight ahead. In fact, the AP imaging 
must be done in such a way that the petrous bone is directly 
at the level of the inferior orbital rim. In this projection, the 
target point in the left-right or X coordinate represents the 
junction of the medial and inferior orbital rims  ( Fig. 15.2 ) . 
Using relatively standard magniﬁ cation, the foramen ovale 
is 1–2 cm lateral to this and just below the inferior orbital 
rim. It can be recognized on AP and lateral ﬂ uoroscopic im-
aging and usually does not require the beam or the patient’s 
head to be rotated. 
 The patient’s face is prepped and draped with alcohol only. 
A felt tip sterile marking pen is used to mark an entry point 
25 mm lateral to the corner of the mouth with the patient’s 
lips in a neutral position  ( Fig. 15.3 ) . External landmarks are 
marked on the face such that the Y coordinate is 25 mm 
anterior to the tragus along the orbitomeatal line, and the Z 
coordinate lies in the plane of the orbitomeatal line. This in-
dicates the superior-inferior location of the foramen ovale. 
The X coordinate lies at the radiographic target, and will be 
reached after transovale penetration. The needle should be 
aimed to go through the mid to medial part of the foramen 
ovale. Too lateral placement of the needle through the fo-
ramen ovale can result in subtemporal penetration of the 
subarachnoid space leading to the false recognition of CSF 
(a necessary but insufﬁ cient sign of appropriate localiza-
tion). Too medial placement of this runs the risk of being a 
subdural placement medial to the trigeminal cistern. 
 An index ﬁ nger is placed into the oral cavity in the pty-
geroid fossa, but not with pressure  ( Fig. 15.4 ) . The ﬁ nger 
simply feels the spinal needle slide in a submucosal plane 
as it advances toward the foramen ovale. The spinal needle

Fig. 15.2 Lateral ﬂ uoroscopic view used to assess the needle depth. The head is placed in a neutral position and the beam is horizontal.       
is placed after using a 25-gauge needle to inject a small 
wheel of local anesthetic at the entry point lateral to the 
corner of the mouth. Further deeper inﬁ ltration using 1% 
Xylocaine (no epinephrine) is done, after which the 20-
gauge standard spinal needle is advanced. The ﬁ rst move is 
only to set the left-right of X coordinate in the region of the 
foramen ovale. After this is properly set and visualized on 
the ﬂ uoroscopic imaging, the radiology technician moves 
the C-arm  to the lateral position. A true lateral view must 
be obtained. When this is the case, both internal auditory 
canals, the petrous bones superimposed, and both ante-
rior cranial fossa (planum sphenoidal) are superimposed 
and indicate no beam angulation). When this is done, the 
proper Y,Z coordinate target represents a point that is ra-
diographically deﬁ ned as the V established by the lateral 
petrous bone overlying the medial clivus. This radiographic 
V is the anatomic location of the trigeminal cistern. The 
foramen ovale will have been traversed before the intra-
cisternal target point is reached. In some patients, a direct 
ﬂ uoroscopic “needle view” can help to show the medial 
aspect of the foramen ovale, facilitating placement of the 
needle into the trigeminal cistern .
 Adequate sedation and blood pressure monitoring is 
performed while the needle is advanced. Once the needle 
is in position for satisfactory penetration of the foramen 
ovale, the patient is given an additional boost of analgesics 
or Propofol. This facilitates relatively pain-free placement 
of the 20-gauge needle, which should glide effortlessly in 
most patients (unless they are elderly, stenotic from bony 
overgrowth, or have had prior surgical procedures), through 
the foramen ovale. The surgeon may feel a small pop when 
entering the trigeminal cistern, the same feeling as with a 
lumbar puncture. Male patients, especially younger males, 
occasionally become slightly hypotensive, and the anesthe-
siologist must be prepared to give Atropine. When the stylet 
is removed, CSF should slowly drip. The trigeminal cistern is 
always punctured with the patient in the semisitting posi-
tion with the neck slightly ﬂ exed. The appearance of CSF is 
a good but insufﬁ cient marker, and may be variable depend-
ing on the history of surgery, the position of the patient, and 
the rotation of the hub of the needle. All hub quadrants are 
checked. 
 The needle should never be deeper than the ﬂ uoroscopi-
cally deﬁ ned level of the clivus. Beyond that almost invari-
ably indicates that the needle has penetrated too deep. Since 
it comes from lateral to medial, deeper penetration runs the 
risks of introducing the needle into the cavernous sinus. 
As previously noted during radiofrequency procedures, the 
needle can penetrate the optic nerve. Too deep lateral place-
ment runs the risk of entering the temporal lobe. Once spi-

nal ﬂ uid is identiﬁ ed, iodinated contrast is injected into the 
trigeminal cistern. We use nonionic iohexal. We draw up 0.5 
cc of this into the sterile tuberculin syringe. The trigeminal 
cistern commonly varies between 0.25 and 0.4 cc. It never 
exceeds 0.5 ml, and should give a characteristic AP and lat-
eral radiographic appearance after a slow penetration of the 
cistern  ( Fig. 15.5 ) . After the contrast is injected, the stylet 
is replaced to prevent egress of the contrast before AP and 
lateral radiographs are taken. 
 With the patient in the semisitting position, we aim to 
deﬁ ne the cisternal volume so that the volume of subse-
quent glycerol to be injected can be properly based on the 
affected divisions of the trigeminal nerve. AP and lateral 
radiographs are taken. Next, the contrast is allowed to exit 
from the needle by removing the stylet. If the contrast under 
ﬂ uoroscopy rapidly drains out so that no signiﬁ cant contrast 
remains in the cistern, it is not necessary to put the patient 
into the Trendelenberg position with the head extended. If, 
however, contrast remains in the cistern, and especially if 
the patient has lower division pain, the patient should be 
placed in Trendelenberg, head extended, and contrast al-
lowed to dump into the posterior fossa as opposed to com-

ing out of the spinal needle. Once this is performed, the 
patient is then brought back up to the semisitting position 
under anesthesia monitoring. As the glycerol injection may 
cause some discomfort, especially around the eye, it is nec-
essary to warn the patient and instruct the anesthesiologist 
to increase pain medication as needed, and to slowly inject 
the glycerol. 
 We mix the glycerol with tantalum powder to leave a per-
manent radiographic marker. This allows us to conﬁ rm the ﬁ -
nal positioning of the glycerol and leaves a permanent marker 
of appropriate target placement. Many patients will get an 
ipsilateral physiologic response consisting of facial blushing. 
Face or orbit pain, or even tic pain, may ensue, so additional 
pain medication may be warranted. In a few patients, the 
monosynaptic vasovagal response can be so profound as to 
lead to asystole. A cardiac thump and Atropine are almost 
invariably sufﬁ cient to overcome this very rare event. 
 Once the glycerol is injected and placement conﬁ rmed, 
the needle is completely removed all at once. A Band-Aid is 
placed over the cheek, and the patient remains in a semisit-
ting position for 2 hours. We do not let the patient extend 
the head when transferring to a stretcher. It is important 
there are no air bubbles  in the glycerol solution. 
 Seven procedural features help to predict success of 
PRGR. When all the factors are present, successful pain re-
lief within a matter of days can be predicted in more than 
95% of patients: 
 1.  Easy penetration of the foramen ovale 
 2.  Free ﬂ ow of CSF 
 3.  Normal contrast cisternogram 
 4 . Easy evacuation of the contrast after the cisternogram 
through the needle 
 5.  Physiologic response during injection of the glycerol 
(pain around the eye, facial blush) 
 6.   Systemic physiological effect in some patients (brief hy-
pertension or brief mild to moderate hypotension) 
 7.  Normal ﬁ nal appearance of the cistern after glycerol is 
mixed with tantalum dust 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 It appears necessary for the patient to stay in the semisitting 
position for approximately 2 hours to have the full neuro-
lytic effect develop within the trigeminal nerve. We send 
our patients to observation beds for overnight observation 
and they return home the following day. 
 Other than perioperative blood pressure or cardiac 
changes, other complications are relatively rare. Some days 
after their ﬁ rst procedure, about 10–20% of patients will 
have detectable—but usually mild—reduction in light touch 
or pain pin perception. With repeated glycerol procedures, 
the incremental sensory dysfunction increases, so that by 
two or three procedures, 50–70% of patients will have mild 
to moderate detectable sensory changes. Deafferentation 
pain in our experience has been extremely unusual and 
most likely occurs in the context of herpes simplex. The 
risk of developing delayed corneal dysfunction is extremely 
low, especially with an initial procedure. 
 Many patients have chronic herpes simplex perioralis 
virus in the gasserian ganglion. With percutaneous thera-
pies, the subsequent development of cold sores is com-
mon. For patients who have a history of repeated cold sore

attacks, we place them prophylactically on Acyclovir and 
give them Acyclovir ointment for perioral application in 
the perioperative interval. Patients should be warned that 
2 to 3 days after the procedure (usually after they are long 
home), they may develop cold sores. Severe outbreaks of 
cold sores are associated with the rare development of 
deafferentation pain sequelae, usually annoying paresthe-
siae or dysesthesiae, so the cold sores should be treated 
vigorously. 
 Early aseptic meningitis (1–2 days) is an extremely rare 
event, occurring in approximately 2 of 1,000 cases. Although 
spinal ﬂ uid analysis must be urgently repeated to conﬁ rm 
absence of bacterial meningitis, patients can be placed on 
corticosteroids if the CSF gram stain is negative. The pleocy-
tosis may be profound, and can be very hard to differentiate 
from true bacterial meningitis. The risk of bacterial menin-

gitis is minimized by making sure the spinal needle does not 
penetrate the oral mucosa. 
 Conclusions 
 PRGR has been widely used in the United States and abroad 
as a primary alternative to other transovale percutaneous 
management strategies. We use this technique in a select 
group of patients who are not considered candidates for mi-
crovascular decompression or Gamma knife® radiosurgery, 
which we regard as the most minimally invasive treatment 
strategy  ( Fig. 15.6 ) . PRGR is an effective surgical procedure 
that does not require intraoperative cooperation of the pa-
tient, has a high and rapid success rate, can be repeated 
when needed, and has a low complication rate.

Trigeminal Neuralgia 
 Chad J. Morgan and  John M. Tew Jr. 
 Percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy (PSR) for the treat-
ment of trigeminal neuralgia has proven to be an invaluable 
innovation with a unique longevity. This technique with a 
curved tip electrode offers precise targeting of the trigemi-
nal root and ganglion under image-guided ﬂ uoroscopy and 
eliminates the need to frequently reposition the cannula. 
Percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy has high rates of 
success, acceptable durability, a respected safety proﬁ le, and 
a high level of patient satisfaction. 
 Patient Selection 
 The diagnosis is established before any treatment paradigm 
is initiated for patients with suspected trigeminal neuralgia. 
Five criteria deﬁ ne the disorder in our practice: (1) the patient 
experiences paroxysmal sharp and shooting pain that is char-
acterized by exacerbations and remissions; (2) pain follows 
the distribution of the trigeminal nerve; (3) the patient has 
a normal neurological exam, including no signiﬁ cant loss of 
facial sensation; (4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
brain; demonstrates neither mass lesions nor demyelinating 
plaques; and (5) pain is induced by cutaneous stimulation. 
 All primary surgical treatment modalities must be consid-
ered and then tailored speciﬁ cally for patients when medical 
management has failed. We believe that PSR provides timely 
symptomatic relief and is well suited for elderly patients 
and for those who are not candidates to undergo posterior 
fossa exploration. In these populations, this percutaneous 
procedure provides safe, rapid relief with a proven longevity 
and an acceptable risk proﬁ le. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Three key steps to ensure the performance of a successful 
percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy sequentially in-
clude the following:  
 1. Cannulate the foramen ovale and the trigeminal cistern.  
 2. Stimulate to reproduce pain and determine intensity 
threshold. 
 3. Generate an effective partial sensory lesion.

 This three-step approach to percutaneous radiofrequency 
ablation of the trigeminal nerve has proven safe and effec-
tive in more than 95% of patients in the senior author’s (JMT) 
experience. 
 Understanding the skull base anatomy and its anatomic var-
iants is essential before the foramen is cannulated  ( Fig. 16.1 ) . 
Aberrant placement of the cannula can cause unintended 
neurovascular injuries. Use of lateral ﬂ uoroscopic imaging 
will aid in avoiding the inferior orbital ﬁ ssure or the jugular 
foramen. Pulsatile blood ﬂ ow through the cannula indicates 
the internal carotid artery (ICA) has been penetrated in one 
of three locations: at the proximal C2 segment at the carotid 
canal, at the C3 segment with the electrode passing through 
the cartilage of the foramen lacerum, or at the cavernous (C4) 
segment  ( Fig. 16.2 ) . If the ICA is penetrated, the cannula is 
withdrawn promptly, manual pressure is applied over the 
posterior pharyngeal space, the procedure is discontinued, 
and the patient is allowed 24 to 48 hours to convalesce.

 Operative Procedure 
 The primary goals are to penetrate the medial portion of 
the foramen ovale and to place the electrode’s tip in the 
retrogasserian rootlets  ( Fig. 16.3 ) . Using Hartel landmarks, 
we advocate either the direct penetration technique or the 
sequential palpation in which the surgeon processes the 
cannula down the smooth surface of the infratemporal fossa 
toward the superior-medial aspect of the foramen  ( Fig. 
16.4 ) . If the cannula enters the posterior-lateral aspect of 
the foramen, it may elude the trigeminal cistern and miss 
the trigeminal ganglion within its dural investment. As the 
electrode is advanced, it may not reach the maxillary or 
ophthalmic divisions of the rootlet. 
 Step 1: Cannulate the Foramen Ovale 
 The procedure begins by administering 0.4 mg of intra-
muscular Atropine to reduce oral secretions and prevent 
bradycardia. After the patient is positioned supine on the 
ﬂ uoroscopic table with the head neutral, Hartel anatomic 
landmarks are plotted on the face  ( Fig. 16.5 ) . Two points 
provide the rostral-caudal and medial-lateral trajectories 
for penetrating the foramen ovale and the third point shows 
needle penetration of the jaw. After preparing the affected 
cheek with Betadine (povidone-iodine), 30 to 50 mg of 
methohexital is intravenously injected. A 21-gauge spinal 
needle placed in the deltoid subcutaneous tissue acts as a 
reference electrode. 
 Once the patient is anesthetized, an oral airway inserted 
between the molars prevents the patient from involuntar-
ily biting the surgeon’s ﬁ nger that guides the cannula. The 
index ﬁ nger of a surgeon’s gloved hand is placed inside 
the patient’s cheek just inferior and lateral to the lateral 
pterygoid wing. A standard 100–mm, 20-gauge cannulated 
needle is then directed from a point 2.5 cm lateral to the or-
bital commissure toward the medial portion of the foramen 
ovale. Fluoroscopic visualization is important to localize the 
needle. Use of the image intensiﬁ er in the lateral plane ef-
fectively localizes the needle.   Entrance of the cannula into 
the foramen is signaled by a wince and a brief contraction of 
the masseter muscle, indicating contact with the mandibu-
lar sensory and motor ﬁ bers. Before the cannula is advanced 
any farther, a lateral ﬂ uoroscopic image conﬁ rms its proper 
placement in the foramen ovale  ( Fig. 16.6 A) . Fluoroscopy 
allows targeting a point of the lateral projection of the cli-
vus, which is 5 to 10 mm below the ﬂ oor of the sella  ( Fig. 
16.6 B) . 
 Difﬁ culty penetrating the foramen of ovale should cause 
pause and a return to a fundamental principle:  the safest 
approach to the foramen of ovale is a trajectory that begins 
anterior-medial to the foramen. The surgeon can sequen-
tially palpate by using the cannula along the smooth surface 
of the infratemporal fossa and enter the superior medial as-
pect of the foramen. This technique allows the electrode to

enter the trigeminal cistern and sequentially contact each of 
the three divisions of the trigeminal root. Furthermore, tar-
geting the anteromedial portion of the foramen of ovale re-
duces the risks associated with probing alternative portions 
of the skull base and lowers the incidence of hematoma 
caused by venous or arterial hemorrhage. 
 Step 2: Stimulate the Trigeminal Nerve 
 After the foramen of ovale is penetrated, the electrode is 
passed through the cannula. When making subtle adjust-
ments of the electrode tip position for precise stimulation of 
the division of the trigeminal root, the surgeon should meet 
two important objectives:  
 1. Precisely reproduce the patient’s trigeminal pain pattern, 
which will lessen the likelihood of lesions in adjacent 
divisions. The key to precise stimulation is principally 
related to electrode tip placement.  
 2. Determine the intensity threshold required to reproduce 
the patient’s typical pain. This provides the neurosurgeon 
insight about the duration and temperature required to 
generate an effective partial sensory lesion. 
 Targeted stimulation begins by manipulating the elec-
trode’s tip in two dimensions as viewed on lateral ﬂ uoros-
copy: the relationship of the electrode tip to the proﬁ le of 
clivus and the curvature of this tip. When the tip rests at the 
clival level, a stimulating pulse typically elicits paresthesias 
in the maxillary division rootlets. Advancing beyond the 
clival proﬁ le moves the electrode near the ophthalmic divi-
sion rootlets and withdrawing the needle from the clival 
level targets the mandibular division rootlets  ( Fig. 16.7 ) . 
The electrode’s tip should not advance more than 10 mm 
deep to the proﬁ le of the clivus, because the tip can contact 
the abducens nerve. Sometimes the needle tip must be re-
directed more anterior-medially (near the posterior clinoid 
process) for closer contact with the ophthalmic division. If 
the globe moves during stimulation, the cannula is too near 
the cranial nerves (CNs) in the cavernous sinus or the brain-
stem. Stimulus-evoked facial contractions indicate that the 
electrode may be too deep or inclined too low on the clivus, 
or the stimulation level is too high. A lesion should not be 
made if there is any indication of motor activity of CNs III, 
IV, VI, or VII or arterial bleeding. 
 After this initial placement, axial rotation of the curved 
electrode permits a secondary form of targeting for precise 
localization within the sensory root. The curved electrode 
tip is a coil spring that carries a thermocouple, a stimulator, 
and a lesion-generating probe. When fully inserted into the 
cannula, the curved tip extends 5 mm beyond the end of 
the cannula and 3 mm perpendicular to the long axis of the 
electrode. Insulating the cannula with polytetraﬂ uoroethyl-
ene allows only the extruded portion of the electrode (0 to 5 
mm) to be conductive. Although rotation can occur through 
a 360-degree axis, ﬁ nal positioning of the electrode’s tip is 
determined by the patient’s response to electrical stimula-
tion. A tip projecting cephalad or medial provides better ac-
cess to the ﬁ bers of the ophthalmic division. A tip projecting 
caudal or lateral should enable contact with the mandibular 
ﬁ bers  ( Fig. 16.7 ) . If the electrode contacts the motor root and 
elicits stimulation of the masseter or pterygoid muscles, the 
electrode can be rotated laterally to reduce the incidence of 
a lesion that may result in a trigeminal motor paresis. 
 Several general principles apply for reproducing the pa-
tient’s pain proﬁ le. A square-wave current of 100 to 400 
mV at 50 Hz and 1 millisecond duration typically repro-
duces the paroxysmal bouts of pain that are reminiscent of 
trigeminal neuralgia. Stimulation at higher voltage (500 to 
1000 mV) may be required for patients who have had previ-
ous intracranial rhizotomy or repeated alcohol injections. 
Stimulation can also be achieved with mild heat (lower than 
50°C). The evoked response not only localizes but reliably 
indicates the probe temperature required for lesion pro-
duction. Consequently, the threshold current responsible 
for eliciting pain can be translated into a temperature and 
duration for the initial lesion. Speciﬁ cally, the sensitivity 
of the nerve to a stimulus can be used to extrapolate an 
effective partial sensory lesion. Our paradigm for convert-
ing a stimulus threshold to an initial lesion is described in 
 Table 16.1 .

   Step 3: Generate a Lesion 
 Generating a lesion with dense hypalgesia in the primarily 
affected divisions provides sufﬁ cient longevity, yet limits 
the morbidity associated with denser lesions. Additional 
treatments can be performed on patients with recurring 
pain; this dense hypalgesia provides clinical effectiveness 
and high patient acceptance. 
 With the information gained during stimulation, addi-
tional intravenous anesthetic is administered and a pre-
liminary lesion is produced. A thermocouple sensor is lo-
cated at the electrode tip (calibration accuracy ±2°C, range 
30–100°C). A facial ﬂ ush, secondary to antidromic release 
of vasodilatory neuropeptides (e.g., substance P, calcitonin 
gene-related peptide), usually appears at this point and 
helps to localize the region of the nerve root undergoing 
thermal destruction. 
 After the patient is fully awake, careful sensory testing of 
the face is conducted. Repeat lesions are produced until the 
desired effect is achieved; sequential lesions are made at a 
60- to 90-second duration by increasing the temperature 
5°C. When analgesia is approached, great care is exercised to 
avoid overshooting the desired result, which includes pres-
ervation of the sense of touch. With production of a partial 
lesion, completion of the lesion is often possible without 
additional anesthesia and with constant sensory testing to 
ﬁ nely control denervation. This tactic is particularly valu-
able when it is imperative to avoid analgesia and to preserve 
cranial sensitivity (as for a V1 lesion). 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 When the desired sensory loss has been achieved, the pa-
tient is observed for an additional 15 minutes. If the exami-
nation indicates a stable level of hypalgesia, the distribution 
and degree of deﬁ cit are documented by careful sensory and 
motor testing. During the next 4-hour period in the hospital 
room, the patient is observed and informed (with family) 
of the requisite eye care, chewing exercises, and the con-
sequences of facial hypalgesia. Anticonvulsant medications 
are sequentially tapered before discontinuation. 
 In a retrospective study of 1200 patients (mean follow up 
9 years, range 1 to 21 years), 20% experienced pain recur-
rence as minor (requiring no medication) in 5%; moderate 
(well controlled with medication) in 5%; and severe (re-
quired a surgical procedure) in 10%. In a prospective study of 
154 patients (15-year follow up), Kaplan-Meier analysis es-
timated a 25% pain recurrence rate at 15 years: recurrences 
were 15% at 5 years, 7% at 5 to 10 years, and 3% at 10 to 15

years. Pain recurrence correlated directly with the degree 
of sensory loss (60% with mild hypalgesia versus 25% with 
dense hypalgesia and 20% with analgesia). Median pain-
free survival rates were 32 months for patients with mild 
hypalgesia and more than 15 years for those with analgesia 
or dense hypalgesia. 
 Some facial numbness always develops after a successful 
radiofrequency thermocoagulation procedure. Troublesome 
numbness and paresthesias as results of the inherent sen-
sory deﬁ cit proved to be the most consistent adverse effect 
(3%). Constant, severe dysesthesia in anesthetic or analgesic 
zones (anesthesia dolorosa) occurred in fewer than 1% of 
patients. Other complications included corneal analgesia in 
6%, neurogenic keratitis in 2%, and transient diplopia in 1% 
of patients. Nerve injuries (in order of frequency) were the 
abducens nerves located in the lateral dural wall of the cav-
ernous sinus, trochlear nerve, and the oculomotor nerve. The 
most persistent diplopia lasted 4 months and all occurrences 
resolved spontaneously. Paresis of muscles innervated by 
the motor root of the trigeminal nerve occurred in 16% of pa-
tients. The motor root lies medial to the ganglion and may be 
avoided by lateral rotation of the curved electrode if stimu-
lation produces contraction of the masseter or pterygoid. 
 Conclusions 
 Overall, percutaneous rhizotomy of the trigeminal nerve via 
thermal ablation is a safe and elegant procedure when per-
formed by experienced neurosurgeons. Treatment of this 
benign disorder demands such a procedure that is associ-
ated with low morbidity and negligible mortality. If patients 
experience a recurrence, a repeat percutaneous radiofre-
quency rhizotomy does not pose a signiﬁ cant problem be-
cause the procedure is easily repeated. Therefore, higher 
recurrence rates are acceptable to reduce the risk of dener-
vation paresthesias and dysesthesias.

  Dorsal Root Entry Zone Lesioning for 
Neuropathic Pain 
 Amr O. El-Naggar 
  The dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) operation is one of a few 
neuro-lesioning operations involving the central nervous 
system that are still in use today. DREZ lesioning involves 
the creation of lesions in the dorsal root entry zone areas. It 
uses a radiofrequency current delivered through a specially 
designed thermocouple electrode to destroy Rexed layers 
I through V. These lesions are mainly targeted toward the 
cells of origin of the second-order neurons in Rexed layers 
II and V, which give rise to the spinothalamic and spino-
reticular tracts. The DREZ extends from the upper cervical 
cord to the conus medullaris deep to the intermediolateral 
sulcus. It intermingles cephalad with the trigeminal nu-
cleus caudalis, which is the caudal portion of the trigeminal 
nucleus. 
 Patient Selection 
 Careful patient selection is the key to the success of any op-
erative procedure. Patients with deafferentation pain syn-
dromes, especially brachial and sacral plexus avulsion pains, 
beneﬁ t the most from this operation. The DREZ operation is 
also very successful for paraplegic patients with intractable 
pain, including central, radicular pain, and postamputation 
phantom pain. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 A thorough evaluation of the patient’s pain is thus essential, 
especially for patients who have undergone previous mul-
tiple surgical procedures. Plain roentgenograms or multi-
planar and 3D computed tomography scans are obtained 
routinely to study the details of the bone anatomy, which 
is especially helpful for patients who have had previous 
operative interventions. Other preoperative radiological 
studies are usually essential to conﬁ rm the diagnosis, as 
in cases of brachial plexus or sacral plexus avulsion inju-
ries, where magnetic resonance imaging and myelography 
usually show evidence of pseudomeningoceles along the 
avulsed roots  ( Fig. 17.1 ) . Those studies will also help the 
surgeon visualize the spinal cord at the proposed operative 
site for evidence of scar tissue or traumatic syringomyelia 
 ( Fig. 17.2 ) . 
 Operative Procedure 
 All DREZ operations are performed under general anesthesia 
with physiologic monitoring as determined by the patient’s 
general condition. The patient is then placed in the prone 
position. Patients undergoing cervical DREZ lesions or lesions 
involving the upper four thoracic segments have their heads 
immobilized in a Mayﬁ eld head holder (Ohio Medical Instru-
ment Co., Cincinnati, OH) to ensure anatomical alignment. 
Full ﬂ exion and elevation of the head is also essential in cases 
involving the uppermost cervical levels. A reverse Trende-
lenberg position is then used to position the operative site 
horizontally  ( Fig. 17.3 ) . Patients undergoing lesions below 
T4 are placed in the prone position with the head turned to 
one side. Adequate cushioning by placing soft rolls under 
the chest, hips, arms, and legs will prevent pressure injuries 
 ( Fig. 17.4 ).  Intraoperative steroids are given in the form of 
intravenous 1–2 mg/kg/hr Solu-Medrol (methylprednisone) 
throughout the procedure along with 20 mg of Pepcid (fa-
motidine) intravenously. Muscle relaxants are used in cases 
where intraoperative evoked potential monitoring is used. 
 The level and extent of the surgical exposure relate di-
rectly to the level and number of dermatomes affected. 
Patients undergoing cervical DREZ lesions require lami-
nectomies extending one level rostral to the highest der-
matome affected, whereas those undergoing thoracic 
DREZ lesions require laminectomies two levels higher. The 
number of laminectomies performed is based directly, in 
a one-to-one ratio, on the number of painful dermatomes. 
For patients (such as those with phantom pain) under-
going a conus medullaris DREZ lesioning for intractable 
lower extremity pain, T10 through L1 laminectomies are 
performed. 
 The anatomy of the spinal roots varies according to the 
level of their origin from the spinal cord. The cervicodorsal 
roots are made up of 5–8 individual rootlets that form the 
main sensory branch and exit via the intervertebral foramen 
at the level of origin from the spinal cord. In contrast, the 
thoracic dorsal roots are made up of 2–four rootlets that 
are much smaller in diameter and form the main dorsal 
root. These exit at least 2–3 vertebral levels below their 
origin from the spinal cord. Whereas the cervical sensory 
rootlets originate close together, the thoracic roots often are 
separated by several millimeters with a distance of 5 mm 
between successive thoracic dorsal roots. This blank space

DREZ lesioning. 
 At the level of the conus medullaris, the lower lumbar 
and sacral roots are close to each other and may overlap the 
conus and hide the lower sacral sensory roots. The avulsed 
area on the spinal cord at the level of the conus is often hid-
den by these superﬁ cial sensory rootlets from higher levels, 
and the surgeon must carefully retract them to expose the 
avulsed area. Anatomical identiﬁ cation of the sacral sensory 
roots is often difﬁ cult. The S1 dorsal root is the largest, and 
the best way to identify it visually is for the surgeon to ﬁ nd 
the last sacral root, which is extremely small, and count up 
from that point to the largest dorsal root, which should be 
the level of S1. The most accurate method of dorsal root 
localization is somatosensory evoked potentials. Electrical 
stimulation over the femoral triangle, stimulating the femo-
ral nerve, will give a good L1 localization. The recording 
electrodes are placed on the spinal cord while stimulating 
over the popliteal fossa (posterior tibial or sciatic nerve) and 
recording on the conus gives good S1 localization. Where 
there is an area of unilateral avulsion on the conus or loss 
of a leg from trauma, the intact leg can be used for somato-
sensory localization  ( Fig. 17.5 ) . 
 The thoracic dorsal roots are the most difﬁ cult to identify 
precisely at their origin on the spinal cord. We use the “rule 

 
17 Dorsal Root Entry Zone (DREZ) Lesioning for Neuropathic Pain 105
of two”: the origin of the dorsal root from the spinal cord 
is approximately two vertebral levels above its exit at the 
intervertebral foramen. For patients with postherpetic pain 
involving the thoracic or abdominal area, the surgeon may 
note after opening the dura that some dorsal roots appear 
abnormal. This is a good indication that the proper roots 
for the DREZ lesion have been localized. Precise anatomical 
localization is important to restrict the lesion to the painful 
areas of the body. 
 In most instances, a standard multilevel bilateral laminec-
tomy is performed. Hemilaminectomies are performed on 
patients with thoracic postherpetic neuralgia and unilateral 
intractable radicular pain secondary to spinal cord injury. 
Postoperative recovery is faster and incisional pain less se-
vere for patients undergoing hemilaminectomy. 
 We prefer to use the Midas Rex drill (Medtronic, Min-
neapolis, MN) to perform the laminectomies to save opera-
tive time and for its safety when used by an experienced

surgeon. We use the S-1 drill bits for lumbar and thoracic 
laminectomies and hemilaminectomies, and the B-1 drill 
bits for the cervical region. We ﬁ rst use the AM-8 drill bit to 
drill the lower portion of the most caudal lamina to expose 
the ligamentum ﬂ avum bilaterally. The S-1 or B-1 bit is then 
used to cut through the laminae one after the other, rostrally 
 ( Fig. 17.6 A) . The supraspinous and interspinous ligaments 
above and below are cut with Mayo scissors and the laminae 
and spinous processes are removed en toto. 
 Cottonoid strips are placed over the sides of the wound 
and the dura is then opened in the midline, sparing the 
arachnoid  ( Fig. 17.6 B) . Using 4–0 silk sutures placed  about 2 
cm apart, the dural edges are retracted laterally, thus maxi-
mizing the exposure. In patients with trauma or prior opera-
tive procedures, the dura and arachnoid may be adherent 
and scarred down to the spinal cord. Gentle and blunt dis-
section using the microscope is required to separate them. 
The arachnoid is opened directly over the dorsal root entry 
zone in patients undergoing unilateral DREZ lesions. The 
arachnoid is ﬁ rst opened in the middle of the exposure by 
using a sharp hook and scissors. Its edges are then secured 
to the dural edges with small hemostatic clips  ( Fig. 17.6 C) . 
It is then opened caudally and rostrally with a microbayonet 
forceps and sharp microscissors. It is important to keep the 
arachnoid edge secured to the dural edge with hemostatic 
clips so that when the dura is closed the subarachnoid space 
is maintained and adhesion of the dura to the spinal cord 
is prevented. 
 Once the arachnoid is satisfactorily opened, any adher-
ent structures over the DREZ should be dissected and re-
tracted. Commonly, multiple serpentine vessels along the 
intermediolateral sulcus must be mobilized to allow for 
the DREZ electrode to be introduced. The description of the 
DREZ electrodes and the speciﬁ cs of the operation for vari-
ous indications are mentioned later. In general, the DREZ 
electrode is placed ﬁ rst into the most caudal aspect of the 
region to be lesioned, and is then moved stepwise in a ceph-
alad direction. This allows the neurosurgeon to visualize the 
upper dorsal rootlets as a guide. The electrode is placed into 
the entry zone at the same angle as the dorsal root, about 
45 degrees. The electrode is placed into the spinal cord to a 
depth of 2 mm, at which point the insulating collar prevents 
further ingress. Lesions are made at 75°C for 15 seconds us-
ing the radiofrequency generator. The lesions are made at 
1 mm intervals along the entire affected dorsal root entry 
zone. The spinal region to be lesioned can be measured, and 
if the distance is 10 mm then 10 lesions should be made. A 
comparison of the improvement in pain after DREZ proce-
dures between the earlier patients operated on in the late 
1970s and the more recent cases reveal improved results 
with a greater number of DREZ lesions. Blood vessels are 
gently retracted and the electrode slipped into the entry 
zone to prevent all except the smallest vessels adherent to 
the DREZ area from coagulating. 
 After all lesions are made, total hemostasis is obtained 
within the thecal sac and all residual blood is gently irrigated 
away. The dura and arachnoid are reapproximated in a single 
layer of continuous 4–0 Vicryl or silk suture;  the silver clips 
are removed gradually as the suture approaches the site of 
the clip to avoid any gaps in the arachnoid closure. Dural tack-
up sutures are placed to avoid compression in case a post-
operative epidural hematoma develops. A tack-up suture is 
placed at each end of the dural exposure between the suture 
line and the adjoining supraspinous or interspinous ligament. 
Central tack-up stitches are also used: two in four-level lami-
nectomies and three in ﬁ ve-level laminectomies. These are 
placed between the dural suture line and the connective tis-
sue overlying the adjoining joint capsules in the lumbar and 
thoracic regions, or to the cervical fascia and nuchal ligament 
in the cervical region. We prefer to place tack-up stitches in

all cases, whether bilateral laminectomies or hemilaminecto-
mies are performed. We ordinarily do not use epidural drains. 
If drains are used they are preferably removed on the ﬁ rst 
postoperative day to avoid infection and the development of 
a cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) ﬁ stula. 
 Electrodes and Lesion Parameters 
 The DREZ electrodes in use at Duke are manufactured by 
Cosman Medical Inc., Burlington, MA. Radionics also manu-
factures the RF lesion generator used in the DREZ operation 
 ( Fig. 17.7 ) . The El-Naggar-Nashold standard DREZ electrode 
(Cosman Medical Inc., Burlington, MA) has a lesion tip of 2 
mm and is 0.25 mm in diameter. The electrodes are made 
of a hollow stainless steel tube tapered and pointed at the 
end with an internal thermister at the tip to measure the 
temperature of the lesion. The RF lesions are made at 75°C 
for 15 seconds; this results in a lesion (2  4–5 mm) that 
will destroy the upper 5 or 6 Rexed layers in the dorsal horn. 
Two postmortem studies have conﬁ rmed the focal nature of 
the lesions of the Rexed layers. The heat produced at the tip 
of the electrode is produced by the radiofrequency current 
generator. Spinal cordotomy-type electrodes are not satis-
factory to make DREZ lesions. 
 Brachial Plexus Avulsion Injury 
 A bilateral laminectomy, usually extending from C5 to T1, is 
performed, although at least a portion of the healthy roots 
above and below the avulsion must be visualized to avoid 
any residual postoperative pain. The intermediolateral sul-
cus marking the entryzone of the avulsed rootlets is readily

identiﬁ ed in most cases and is easily seen along an imagi-
nary line connecting the entry zone of the ﬁ rst attached root 
above and the ﬁ rst attached root below the avulsed area. 
Also, identifying the DREZ area on the normal contralateral 
side helps the surgeon identify the overall anatomy of the 
area. DREZ lesions are then placed 1 mm apart, extending 
between the healthy rootlets above and below  ( Fig. 17.8 ) . 
A unilateral hemilaminectomy can certainly sufﬁ ce and 
is better tolerated by patients; however, it should be per-
formed by experienced neurosurgeons because the line of 
the avulsed roots could be difﬁ cult to identify. 
 Conus Medullaris Root Avulsions 
 Avulsion injuries of the conus medullaris differ from those 
in the cervical region in that usually only one or two lum-
bosacral roots are avulsed (L5 or S1). When the conus is 
exposed at operation, the lumbosacral dorsal roots on either

plexus avulsion injuries. 

 
17 Dorsal Root Entry Zone (DREZ) Lesioning for Neuropathic Pain 109
side can be seen along with the avulsed area on the conus. 
The dorsal roots on the side of the avulsion must be carefully 
retracted laterally until the avulsed root level is visualized 
 ( Fig. 17.9 ) . 
 Paraplegia with Intractable Pain 
 The arachnoidal scarring and adhesions commonly found 
in these cases must be meticulously dissected to identify 
the DREZ. Intraoperative ultrasound is also used whenever 
a traumatic syrinx is suspected on clinical, radiological, or 
surgical grounds. Any syrinx should be drained by placing a 
syringo-subarachnoid or syringo-peritoneal shunt in addi-
tion to the DREZ lesions  ( Fig. 17.10 ) . For patients with spinal 
cord injury, the DREZ lesions must be extended, especially 
upward, until healthy roots are identiﬁ ed. Several of our 
patients with gunshot injuries of the spinal cord had root 
avulsions adjacent to the contused areas. Such avulsed areas 
have to be targeted with the DREZ lesions. 
 Postherpetic Neuralgia 
 Unlike postherpetic neuralgia of the face, which responds 
very well to the nucleus caudalis DREZ surgery, thoracic 
distribution postherpetic neuralgia does not respond as 
well. DREZ surgery should be considered only after other 
procedures have failed. Evoked potentials are very helpful in 
localizing the responsible dorsal rootlets; we ﬁ nd this to be 
crucial to avoid incomplete pain relief. Both somatosensory 
evoked potential (SEP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) 
studies are performed intraoperatively. Anatomic localiza-
tion is most difﬁ cult with the thoracolumbar dorsal roots

and dorsal roots that originate from the conus medullaris. 
Careful SEP studies from the painful areas of the body give a 
precise dorsal root localization, allowing the neurosurgeon 
to conﬁ ne the DREZ lesions to the involved painful area. 
 We now routinely monitor SEPs intraoperatively. The po-
tential recorded is produced by simultaneous ﬁ ring of dorsal 
horn neurons, the maximal discharge being in the spinal 
cord segments of entry of the nerve stimulated  ( Fig. 17.5 ) . 
This allows the level for lesion production to be precisely 
located. Stimulating electrodes are placed bilaterally near 
affected nerves as determined from the preoperative sen-
sory exam, and on the contralateral side near the compara-
ble intact nerves. This allows normal and abnormal signals 
to be compared. 
 To stimulate the body or the extremities, we use subcuta-
neous bipolar needle electrodes; bipolar gold discs are used 
to stimulate the face. The evoked potentials are recorded 
from the surface of the spinal cord or the cervicomedullary 
junction with platinum-iridium multicontact disc electrodes 
and from the depth with the lesion-generating electrode. 
 The largest amplitude negativity is determined after the 
intact side is stimulated. The negativity is usually much re-
duced or otherwise abnormal on the affected side. We have 
found that often after DREZ lesions are produced, the nega-
tive wave is replaced by a positive one. This positive potential 
generally signals the volume-conducted approach toward the 
electrode of neural activity, but without neuronal discharge 
at the electrode site. This positivity provides for immediate 
feedback about the technical success of the operation. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Patients who undergo conus medullaris DREZ lesioning or 
lower thoracic procedures are nursed in the ﬂ at position for 
24 hours, then progressively ambulated. Patients with upper 
thoracic, cervical, and caudalis DREZ surgery are kept with 
the head of the bed up 30 degrees. Early ambulation is now 
recommended for those patients. Steroids are continued in 
the postoperative period for 3 days followed by a 40 mg 
Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone acetate)  intramuscular 
injection before discharge. Analgesics are limited to those 
necessary to control postoperative pain. 

 
17 Dorsal Root Entry Zone (DREZ) Lesioning for Neuropathic Pain 111
 Complications 
 Postoperative complications are in the order of 3–5%, in-
cluding CSF leakage and postoperative epidural hematoma 
formation, in addition to ipsilateral lower extremity weak-
ness or incoordination, especially following DREZ lesions of 
the thoracic cord. CSF leakage can be prevented by having a 
tight dural closure and nursing the patient in the appropri-
ate position postoperatively. Epidural hematomas can be 
prevented by having a dry ﬁ eld before closure in addition to 
the use of tack-up stitches. Neurologic deﬁ cits in the form of 
ipsilateral or bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness 
can be avoided by careful monitoring of evoked potentials 
and downstream electromyographic recording in addition 
to thorough adherence to the above mentioned principles 
of lesion making.

  Nucleus Caudalis Dorsal Root Entry Zone 
Lesioning for Intractable Facial Pain 
 Amr O.  El-Naggar 
  The nucleus caudalis is the most caudal portion of the spinal 
nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. It receives the major pain 
afferents from the trigeminal system. Radiofrequency (RF) 
lesions in the nucleus caudalis have a similar functional ef-
fect as the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesions, and are 
performed to treat intractable pain of head and facial origin, 
especially pain caused by deafferentation. 
 Patient Selection 
 Careful patient selection is the key to the success of any 
operative procedure. Trigeminal nucleus caudalis lesions are 
used successfully to treat intractable facial pain secondary 
to postherpetic neuralgia or anesthesia dolorosa, and for pa-
tients with trigeminal dysesthesia for whom all other surgi-
cal treatments have failed. It is also employed in the surgical 
treatment of selected cases of intractable vascular headache 
syndromes. Because it is located in the brainstem area, sur-
rounded by numerous tracts and nuclei, special training is a 
must before a surgeon performs such a delicate procedure. 
Neuro-augmentative procedures for relief of intractable fa-
cial pain should also be considered ﬁ rst before proceeding 
with nucleus caudalis DREZ surgery. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 A thorough evaluation of the patient’s pain is  essential, es-
pecially for patients who have undergone multiple surgical 
procedures. For instance, when dealing with facial pain de-
termining whether we are dealing with a case of recurrent 
trigeminal neuralgia, atypical facial, residual facial pain, 
dysesthetic pain, or anesthesia dolorosa. Plain roentgeno-
grams are obtained routinely to study the details of the bone 
anatomy, which is especially helpful for patients who have 
had previous operative interventions. Other preoperative 
radiological studies such as head computed tomography and 
brain magnetic resonance imaging are usually essential to 
conﬁ rm the diagnosis, or to exclude other etiologies of facial 
pain such as multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, or arachnoid 
cysts. All patients are given antibiotics and steroids preop-
eratively. 
 Operative Procedure 
 All caudalis DREZ operations are performed under general 
anesthesia with physiologic monitoring as determined by 
the patient’s general condition. A Foley catheter and an arte-
rial line are essential. A Mayﬁ eld head holder (Ohio Medical 
Instrument, CO., Cincinnati, OH) i s placed and the patient is 
then placed in the prone position. The head is fully ﬂ exed 
and elevated to better access the suboccipital area and open 
up the craniocervical junction. A reverse Trendelenberg po-
sition is then used to position the operative site horizontally 
 ( Fig. 18.1 ) . Adequate cushioning by placing soft rolls under 
the chest, hips, arms, and legs will prevent pressure injuries. 
Particular care should be taken to avoid injury to the ul-
nar and peroneal nerves. Muscle relaxants are used in cases 
where intraoperative evoked potential monitoring is used. 
Unilateral and bilateral exposures can be performed in the 
lateral park bench semiprone position. If the lateral position 
is chosen, the head must be kept perpendicular to the neck 
to avoid any rotation at the craniocervical junction. 
 For a bilateral exposure, a midline skin incision is made 
1 inch below the inion down to the spinous process of C2. 
Dissection is then performed in the midline down to the 
periosteum of the skull bone and down to the posterior 
arch of C1. The suboccipital muscles are dissected from the 
suboccipital bone and from the posterior tubercle of C1. 
There is no need to strip any of the suboccipital muscles 
attached to C2. 
 A suboccipital craniectomy is then performed using a per-
forator and rongeurs or the Midas Rex AM 8 bit  (Medtronic, 
Minneaspolis, MN) as a perforator followed by a suboccipital 
craniotomy using the B 1 footplate and removal of the bone 
ﬂ ap in one piece. Care should be taken during dissection of 
the paraspinal muscles at the C1–2 area because of large 
veins. Careful dissection of the periosteum above and un-
derneath the posterior arch of C1 should be performed be-
fore the rongeurs or the drill is used. The craniectomy needs 
to extend about one third the distance from the foramen 
magnum to the inion. The rim of the foramen magnum is 
carefully dissected and preferably removed piecemeal. The 
atlanto-occipital membrane is then dissected and cut with 
Dandy scissors. The ligamentum ﬂ avum between C1 and C2 
is also excised. Bone wax and Surgicel are used to control 
bleeding and the dura is then opened. 

 
18 Nucleus Caudalis Dorsal Root Entry Zone Lesioning for Intractable Facial Pain 113
 The dura is opened with the aid of the operative micro-
scope. A 2 mm incision in the midline is made with a small 
scalpel below the circular sinus, sparing the arachnoid. The 
dura is then incised sharply in the midline and the inci-
sion extended caudally to the C2 lamina. It is then extended 
upward until the circular sinus is reached. Using 4–0 silk 
sutures placed  about 1 cm apart, the dural edges are re-
tracted laterally to maximize the exposure. The incision is 
then extended across the circular sinus. If the sinus is small, 
bleeding is controlled with bipolar cautery; however, if it is 
large, the edges have to be sutured with 4–0 silk sutures. 
Temporary hemostatic clips can be placed initially to control 
bleeding from the circular sinus, then replaced subsequently 
with the 4–0 silk sutures. Once the dura is opened beyond 
this point, the incision is curved laterally toward the side 
of the pain if unilateral lesioning is desired, or converted 
into a Y-shaped incision if bilateral lesioning is intended. 
The surgeon may use the Y-shaped incision in either case to 
better visualize the anatomy and to better identify the obex 
and the 4th ventricle. 
 The arachnoid is incised in the midline with microscis-
sors and a sharp hook and its edges are secured to the dural 
edges with small hemostatic clips. It is then opened caudally 
and rostrally with a microbayonet forceps and sharp micro-
scissors. The arachnoid edge must be secured to the dural 
edge with hemostatic clips so that when the dura is closed 
the subarachnoid space is maintained and the dura does not 
adhere to the spinal cord. The posterior inferior cerebellar 
artery is almost always encountered, and care should be 
taken to avoid injury to this important vessel while open-
ing the arachnoid. This is especially important for patients 
who have undergone a previous retromastoid craniectomy 
for microvascular decompression of the ﬁ fth cranial nerve 
for tic douloureux because scarring and thickening of the 
arachnoid can obscure the vessel. 
 Once the arachnoid is satisfactorily opened, any adher-
ent structures over the DREZ should be dissected and re-
tracted. Commonly, multiple serpentine vessels along the 
intermediolateral sulcus must be mobilized to allow the 
DREZ electrode to be introduced. If bleeding is encoun-
tered, a small piece of Surgicel placed on the vessel is al-
most always sufﬁ cient for hemostasis; if the bleeding is 
signiﬁ cant, bipolar coagulation at a low setting is used. All 
surface vessels are to be very well protected. Before any le-
sion is performed, the surgeon will need to identify all the 
important structures and landmarks. The C2 rootlets, the 
ﬁ bers of the 11th cranial nerve, the dentate ligaments, the 
vertebral arteries, the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, 
the obex, and the 4th ventricle are among those structures 
 ( Fig. 18.2 ) . 
 For a unilateral exposure a paramedian skin incision is 
made on the ipsilateral side of the pain 2 cm lateral to the 
midline. The incision is made starting from the level of the 
C2 spinous process until the craniocervical junction. The 
incision is curved gently upward for another 3–4 cm toward 
the side of the pain. The incision is then extended deeper 
into the subcutaneous tissue and the trapezius muscle ﬁ b-
ers. As soon as this is performed the greater occipital nerve 
is identiﬁ ed emerging between the ﬁ bers of the semispina-
lis capitis muscle. The latter ﬁ bers are split longitudinally 
along the nerve and a self-retaining retractor is placed. The 
underlying rectus capitis posterior minor muscle is detached

from the posterior tubercle of C1 and from its counterpart 
and reﬂ ected upward. The rectus capitis posterior major 
is retracted laterally. The suboccipital craniectomy is com-
pleted only on the ipsilateral side, encroaching about 1 cm 
on the other side. A C1 hemilaminectomy is performed as 
well. The dura and arachnoid are incised in the middle of 
the exposure following the same guidelines as mentioned 
earlier  ( Fig. 18.3 ) . 
 Electrodes and Lesion Parameters 
 The lesions are created using the El-Naggar-Nashold nucleus 
caudalis DREZ electrodes. The electrodes were manufactured 
by Cosman Medical, Inc., Burlington, MA . They deliver an RF 
current heating and destroy the tissue surrounding the active 
tip of the electrode. They are also thermocouple electrodes; 
they also record the temperature of the tissue. Five electrodes

are in use today. The variations in the size and conﬁ guration of 
the electrodes allow for the variation in the size and orienta-
tion of the nucleus. The ﬁ rst four electrodes are used routinely 
in all caudalis DREZ cases; however, the ﬁ fth electrode is used 
only for lesions to be made in the nucleus above the obex. Each 
electrode has an active tip and an insulated portion to spare 
the overlying spinocerebellar tracts and the trigeminal tract. A 
total of 20 lesions are made between the C2 ﬁ bers and the obex 
level. The distance is about 2 cm, allowing for a distance of 1 
mm between lesions. All lesions are made after the electrodes 
are introduced fully into the medulla; the surgeon must ensure 
that the insulated portion is all the way in. The handle of the 
electrode should remain perpendicular to the brainstem. The 
entry site should always be 2 mm dorsal to the ﬁ bers of the 
11th cranial nerve. Each lesion is made at 80°C for 15 seconds 
per lesion  ( Figs. 18.4, 18.5, and 18.6 ) .

 The ﬁ rst electrode with an active tip of 0.8 mm is intro-
duced into the medulla immediately above the DREZ area 
of the C2 sensory rootlets. Three lesions are made with that 
electrode. The second electrode with an active tip of 1.2 
mm is then used to make three additional lesions. The third 
electrode with an active tip of 1.6 mm is then used to make 
four lesions. The fourth electrode with an active tip of 1.8 
mm is then used to make six lesions. The ﬁ fth electrode 
with an active tip of 1.5 mm and insulation of 1.5 mm can 
be used only above the obex for ﬁ ve lesions. This is only 
used for patients with intractable facial pain that involves 
the most central portions of the onion skin representation. 
Only one row of lesions is made with these electrodes. The 
creation of two rows of lesions at this time is limited  to 
select recurrent cases when more destruction of the nucleus 
is required. In those situations, one row of lesions is made 
1 mm behind the 11th cranial nerve ﬁ bers and the second 
row is made 2 mm dorsal to the ﬁ rst row. When two rows of 
lesions are made, each lesion is made at 75°C for 15 seconds 
per lesion. 
 After all lesions are made, total hemostasis is obtained 
within the thecal sac and all residual blood is gently irri-
gated away. The dura and arachnoid are approximated in a 
single layer of continuous 4–0 silk suture; the silver clips are 
removed gradually. Lost spinal ﬂ uid is replaced with normal 
saline irrigation. A dural graft is necessary for tight closure. 
Fibrin glue is placed for a better seal. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Postoperative care is similar to care of all craniotomy pa-
tients. Early ambulation is advisable. Steroids are used for 
about 3 days postoperatively. Most of these patients develop 
transient ataxia for up to 10 days postoperatively. Physical 
therapy assistance is necessary for their ambulation in the 
ﬁ rst 2 days after surgery. Most patients do not need assist-
ance beyond the third day. 
 Complications 
 Postoperative complications are in the order of 3–5%. This 
includes CSF leakage, which can be prevented by having a 
tight dural closure and nursing the patient in the appro-
priate position postoperatively. In nucleus caudalis DREZ 
operations, we almost invariably place a dural graft at the 
time of closure to avoid undue tension on the dura, which 
in turn allows for a better, tighter closure. Risk infection is 
less than 2% . Appropriate cultures and antibiotics will be 
necessary in those situations. Pain often recurs. We have 
performed secondary nucleus caudalis DREZ surgery with 
very good success.

  Implantation of a Dorsal Column Stimulator 
for Pain Relief 
 John P. Gorecki 
 Patient Selection 
 Dorsal column stimulation is a modality that is used to 
reduce pain when anatomic correction of the underlying 
problem is not indicated and traditional medical or surgical 
interventions are not feasible or effective. The most com-
mon indication for dorsal column stimulation performed in 
the United States is “failed back surgery syndrome.” Dorsal 
column stimulation is primarily indicated for neuropathic 
or deafferentation pain. Complex regional pain syndrome 
may respond to dorsal column stimulation. Traditionally, 
sympathetic nervous system manipulation is the primary 
treatment for sympathetically mediated pain, but some 
surgeons  now offer dorsal column stimulation before sym-
pathectomy. Pain secondary to ischemic peripheral vascu-
lar disease is due to a combination of nociceptive activa-
tion and deafferentation secondary to ischemic damage to 
sensory nerves, and therefore responds to dorsal column 
stimulation. Some evidence suggests that blood ﬂ ow im-
proves when dorsal column stimulation is used to control 
ischemic pain. Dorsal column stimulation is used to treat 
phantom pain and less commonly for stump pain. Patients 
with neuropathy such as brachial plexus injury secondary 
to radiation or peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes 
can also beneﬁ t from dorsal column stimulation. The results 
of stimulation for patients with incomplete spinal cord in-
jury and pain are variable. In cases of complete cord lesions 
it is unlikely that adequate stimulation will be technically 
possible due to loss of dorsal column ﬁ bers. 
 Before a trial of dorsal column stimulation, patients usu-
ally undergo intensive therapy in a comprehensive multi-
disciplinary pain management clinic. Such therapy includes 
pharmacological agents such as tricyclic antidepressants, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, Neurontin (Gabapentin), non-
steroidal anti-inﬂ ammatory agents, and narcotic analgesics. 
Most patients also receive physical therapy, desensitization 
therapy, biofeedback, and psychological counseling. It is im-
portant that patients receive an exhaustive investigation to 
adequately explain the etiology of the pain and to explore 
avenues for direct or anatomic repair of the underlying prob-
lem. For instance, patients with the label “failed back sur-
gery syndrome” deserve complete lumbar X-rays (including 
ﬂ exion and extension views), simple blood work to rule out 
subclinical infection, and recent magnetic resonance imag-
ing (MRI) with and without contrast enhancement, to ensure 
that further decompression or stabilization is not indicated. 
The best candidate for dorsal column stimulation has uni-
lateral radicular pain that persists after complete surgical 
decompression of the root, with no evidence of residual root 
entrapment or mechanical instability. The pain of arach-
noiditis also responds well to dorsal column stimulation. 
 Alternatives include further conservative measures, ac-
cepting an altered lifestyle that may reduce pain, destruc-
tive procedures that inherently carry greater risk of compli-
cation, chronic oral narcotics, and intraspinal drug infusion. 
In general, destructive neurosurgical procedures have less 
favorable long-term outcomes for the control of pain that is 
not secondary to malignancy. Retrogasserian lesions for tic 
douloureux and dorsal root entry zone lesions for brachial 
plexus avulsion are notable exceptions. Conversely, stimu-
lation procedures are less effective for pain secondary to 
malignancy. 
 The dorsal column stimulation system consists of two 
components. The functional component is the epidural lead, 
which is implanted in the epidural space close to the dor-
sal columns. This lead may be implanted via a percutane-
ous technique or by performing a laminectomy. The second 
component is a power source. Electric current is passed to 
the electrode lead from either of two sources. There is a 
totally implanted pulse generator, similar to a cardiac pace-
maker, which has a self-contained battery. Alternatively, a 
subcutaneous radiofrequency (RF) receiver, which can be 
activated by placing an antenna outside the skin close  to the 
receiver, can be implanted. The antenna receives its power 
from an external RF generator that is powered by standard 
9-V batteries and in many ways resembles a trans cutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation unit. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Almost all surgeons now employ some form of trial stimula-
tion prior to implanting a permanent dorsal column stimu-
lation system. A percutaneously placed electrode meets the 
needs for trial stimulation well, since it is relatively non-
invasive. Trial stimulation allows the patient to experience 
the paresthesia induced by stimulation and to determine the 
extent of pain reduction that dorsal column stimulation can 
deliver. Most patients receive potent analgesics during the 
placement of the lead, which can falsely appear to reduce 

 
19

pain levels if the trial lasts 24 hours or less. During the trial 
stimulation period, patients need to document the pain level 
objectively during and without stimulation. Furthermore, A 
period of sustained poststimulation pain reduction should 
be documented. We use a verbal digital pain scale in which 
the patient rates pain on a scale from 0 to 10; 0 represents no 
pain and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. We arbi-
trarily have patients initially stimulate 1 hour on and 1 hour 
off. This regimen is modiﬁ ed based on the response observed. 
The patient records the pain level in a diary in much the same 
manner as vital signs are plotted graphically for hospitalized 
patients. It is most valuable if a third party assists with this 
documentation. Testing may last up to 1 week. 
 Anesthetic Technique 
 Local anesthesia for placing the electrode lead is favored so 
that localization of the paresthesia produced by stimulation 
can be conﬁ rmed. Epidural anesthesia can be used to main-
tain the perception of stimulation-induced paresthesia. 
Most patients with chronic pain tolerate procedures poorly, 
so it is useful, but not necessary, to use general anesthesia 
to place the pulse generator or receiver. Local anesthesia 
is strongly recommended for any procedure that involves 
manipulation of the electrode, regardless of whether the 
style of the lead demands a small laminotomy for insertion. 
This, however, is left to the individual surgeon’s preference. 
Patients should receive intravenous anti-staphylococcal an-
tibiotics perioperatively and during trial stimulation. 
 Operative Procedure 
 A commercially available spinal cord stimulation lead kit is 
manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) 
or Quest Medical, ANS Division (formerly Neuromed) (Al-
len, TX, USA). 
 Operative Positioning 
 Epidural Lead 
 For lead placement, the patient is usually positioned prone 
on an X-ray-compatible table. Fluoroscopy is used during 
this part of the procedure. The patient is positioned in a 
reversed fashion, with the head located at the foot of the 
table. This allows for greater extension of the table from its 
base, and hence better access for the C-arm  ( Fig. 19.1 ) . Some 
surgeons position the patient in a lateral or even a sitting po-
sition for this part of the procedure and occasionally this has 
merit, as the effect of stimulation sometimes varies signiﬁ -
cantly when the patient is no longer in the prone position. 
It is, however, much easier to assess electrode position with 
ﬂ uoroscopy using a true anterior-posterior (AP) projection. 
 Pulse Generator/Receiver 
 The pulse generator is most often positioned subcutane-
ously over the abdomen so it is easily accessible and less 
likely to result in discomfort. With this placement, more po-
tent stimulation can be achieved, if necessary, by program-
ming the pulse generator positive and the epidural elec-
trode negative, thus establishing an electric ﬁ eld directed 
through the spinal cord. This stage of the procedure is most 
readily accomplished with the patient in a lateral position 
supported by a beanbag. In this position, access is afforded 
to the midline back and the abdomen at the same time  ( Fig. 
19.2 ) . When the stimulation electrode is in the neck, it is 
most convenient to place the pulse generator below the 
clavicle, much like a cardiac pacemaker. 
 Draping 
 Draping is routine. A sterile plastic ﬁ lm (Op-Site)  or iodine-
impregnated Op-Site is thought to reduce infection and help 
hold the towels in place. It is worthwhile to mark the ab-
dominal incision before draping because the landmarks are 
easily covered and the pulse generator can easily be placed 
in a position that is less than convenient when the patient 
is sitting or standing. The generator can be a source of pain 
if it is against pressure points such as the pubis, iliac crest, 
ribs, or belt line. 
 Skin Incision 
 The skin incision for placing the electrode is in the midline, 
over the spine, and extends about 0.5–1 inch long for per-
cutaneous electrodes and about 2–3 inches long for elec-
trodes placed by laminectomy. For stimulation in the lower 
extremity, the electrode tip should end at about T8 or T9 and 
the entry point should be at the thoracolumbar junction or 
the upper lumbar region. The location is usually cephalad to 
any laminectomy scar. For upper extremity stimulation, the 
incision is over the upper thoracic spine and the electrode 
ends in the cervical spine. 
 Epidural Lead Placement via Percutaneous Technique 
 Once the patient is positioned, prepped, and draped, the 
incision site is chosen by carefully palpating the spine and 
is conﬁ rmed by counting the vertebral levels with ﬂ uoros-
copy. The skin is inﬁ ltrated with local anesthetic, usually 
epinephrine. A short midline incision is made down to the 
fascia and a self-retaining retractor is placed. To place the 
percutaneous style of electrode, the Tuohy needle provided 
in the kit is advanced into the epidural space. The angle of 
penetration should be as shallow as possible; this can be 
accomplished by using a paramedian approach rather than 
placing the needle in the midline  ( Fig. 19.3 ) . Fluoroscopic 
guidance is used to place the needle. In most cases, it is de-
sirable to have the tip of the needle close to the midline or 
pointing toward the side of the pain. For this reason, entry 
from the side of the spinous process opposite the painful 
side is appropriate  ( Fig. 19.3 ) . The epidural space is identi-
ﬁ ed by one of several techniques. The surgeon can use a 
glass syringe with constant positive pressure to easily iden-
tify a loss of resistance. Air can be freely injected into the 
epidural space.  

120 II 
Pain
 An alternative is the hanging drop technique, in which 
the negative pressure of the epidural space is recognized 
by a drop of ﬂ uid at the needle hub being drawn inward. If 
the dura is inadvertently penetrated and cerebrospinal ﬂ uid 
obtained, the needle is removed and epidural placement is 
attempted at another interspace, usually more cephalad. 
The hanging drop technique may create confusion in this 
regard due to the use of the ﬂ uid. Once the tip of the Tuohy 
needle is in the epidural space, a spring guide (also provided 
in the kit) can be advanced to dissect an epidural path un-
der ﬂ uoroscopy. Sometimes the actual electrode is easier to 
advance. The space can also be dissected by injecting air or 
preservative-free saline. The electrode is then advanced to 
the desired position, close to the midline, so that the lead 
electrodes will overlie the dorsal columns. The lead should 
terminate slightly eccentric to the side of the pain; however, 
the electrode should be advanced in the midline until the 
desired spinal level is reached. The electrode should not slip 
around the dura to lie in a ventral position, which will often 
result in painful radicular or motor stimulation. The ﬂ uoro-
scopic C-arm is adjusted to produce a true AP projection by 
making the distance between the spinous process and the 
pedicles symmetrical, thus reducing parallax. The lead can 
be guided by twisting it at the same time as advancing or 
withdrawing, since the internal guide wire has a small bend 
at the tip. This bend can be modiﬁ ed by the operator. This 
technique is similar to threading an angiographic catheter. 
It is best to plan stimulation through the middle two elec-
trodes; this leaves greater opportunity for later reprogram-
ming by using a combination of all of the contacts.

advancing the lead. (B) The patient is po-

Implantation of a Dorsal Column Stimulator for Pain Relief 121
 Once in a satisfactory position, the electrode is connected 
to the temporary extension cable and trial stimulation is ini-
tiated using the “screener.” It is most effective if the patients 
are informed of the procedure preoperatively so that they 
know what to expect. The desired goal is to induce paresthe-
sia in a distribution that covers the entire area involved with 
pain. It is acceptable if the paresthesia extends beyond the 
painful area, but it should cover the area of pain as faith-
fully as possible. To achieve stimulation, one must choose 
a stimulation frequency between 0 and 120 Hz; 100 Hz is 
a good starting point. The amplitude is gradually increased 
until the patient recognizes paresthesia. Turning up the am-

plitude too quickly can frighten the patient and compromise 
the success of the procedure. The pulse width is adjustable 
on the screener. It is useful to start with a high pulse width 
to maximize the area of coverage during initial placement. 
To stimulate, at least one electrode must be positive and 
one negative; more contacts can be used as needed, but 
will usually require more amplitude to produce paresthesia. 
The sensation of stimulation is usually anatomically more 
closely related to the negative electrode. Medtronic elec-
trodes are numbered from 0 to 3; 0 is most distal. It is help-
ful to start with electrode 1 negative and 2 positive. 
 If initial stimulation is not satisfactory, the electrode po-
sition is adjusted based on a knowledge of anatomy. More 
cephalad dermatomes are added along the dorsal columns 
from a more lateral position extending upward from the 
conus toward the head. Therefore, one can move toward 
paresthesia in the foot or toes by moving the electrode more 
medially or more caudally. Belt-like paresthesia produced 
around the trunk suggests that the electrode is too lateral 
or too cephalad. Screening can be tedious and time-con-
suming, but it is usually possible. to establish satisfactory 
stimulation. A good position is documented by saving the 
ﬂ uoroscopic image. The guide wire is removed while watch-
ing with the ﬂ uoroscopic image to prevent the electrode 
from dislodging. An anchor is passed over the electrode and 
secured to the electrode with a 2–0 braided permanent liga-
ture. The anchor is then secured to the fascia with a perma-
nent suture  ( Fig. 19.4 ) . 
 The tunneling device provided is then used to pass the 
temporary extension test cable out to a remote skin puncture 
site opposite the side planned for the pulse generator. The 
pulse generator is usually positioned on the nondominant 
side of the abdomen to enable the patient to hold the mag-
net over the generator with the dominant hand. Placement is 
modiﬁ ed based on anatomy or scars. The temporary exten-
sion is connected to the epidural electrode using set screws. 
Care is taken to ensure that electric contact is made by each 
screw. The connector site is covered with a silicone boot that 
is secured with a ligature to reduce tissue ﬂ uid interference 
with electrical contact  ( Fig. 19.5 ) . The leads should not be 
cleaned with saline because it is a corrosive solution. 
 The excess electrode is gently curved to avoid tension and 
placed in a subcutaneous pocket  ( Fig. 19.6 ) . The wound is 
closed in at least two layers to prevent the foreign body 
from working its way out through the skin. A “purse string” 
is placed where the test electrode exits, and the electrode is 
held with a suture. 
 Epidural Lead Placement via Laminectomy 
 To place electrodes that are implanted via laminectomy, the 
principles are the same. The entry laminectomy is usually 
at T10–11 so that the electrode tip ends at the top of T9 or 
bottom of T8. The paraspinal muscles are carefully stripped 
from the spine and lamina at one interspace. A partial lami-
nectomy, large enough to allow passage of the electrode, 
is performed. The epidural space is cleared and the size of 
the opening conﬁ rmed using the lead blank. The electrode 
is then carefully advanced in the epidural space with the 
electrodes facing the dura. The position of the lead is then 
conﬁ rmed by test stimulation. It is occasionally necessary to 
enlarge the laminectomy opening to allow greater manipu-
lation of the electrode position; however, this makes the 
procedure more uncomfortable for the patient. If enough 
dura is exposed, the electrode can be sutured to the dura. 
The reported advantage of the laminectomy electrode is re-
duced migration, but this is achieved at the expense of a 
more difﬁ cult procedure. The laminectomy electrode does 
not absolutely eliminate migration  ( Fig. 19.7 ) .

 Pulse Generator or Radiofrequency Receiver 
 The permanent pulse generator or receiver is implanted af-
ter a successful trial stimulation. If the electrode needs to 
be repositioned or if a percutaneous trial electrode is being 
replaced by a laminectomy-style electrode, the procedure 
is performed as described in the previous section with the 
patient awake to conﬁ rm accurate positioning. Otherwise, 
this step is easily performed with the patient under general 
anesthesia in a lateral position. 
 The temporary lead is cut ﬂ ush with the skin and dis-
carded. The back incision is opened and the temporary ex-
tension wire disconnected and discarded. A skin incision 
is made at the proposed site for the pulse generator, and 
a subcutaneous pocket is fashioned. The pocket should be 
deep enough to allow healthy skin to cover the unit but not 
so deep that it is difﬁ cult to achieve programming with the 
telemetry unit. Hemostasis is ensured early because the mo-
nopolar cautery can damage the pulse generator circuitry. 
 The extension lead for the epidural electrode being used is 
passed between the two incisions using the tunneling device 
provided in a prepackaged kit. The extension lead connects 
to the pulse generator with set screws. Care is taken to en-
sure electrical contact. The epidural electrode and extension 
leads are united with set screws and the junction is protected 
with a silicone boot. Excess cable is carefully positioned to 
avoid any tension or kinks. The connector site is positioned 
so that it will not be the source of an uncomfortable pressure 
point after surgery. The wounds are closed in two layers. 
 The unit is programmed the next day when the patient is 
fully attentive. 
 Monitoring 
 There should be observation to detect potential neurological 
deﬁ cit referable to the spinal cord after the epidural elec-
trode is placed or manipulated. 
 The results of trial stimulation will guide the choice of set-
tings on the permanent pulse generator. The electrode com-
bination selected produces paresthesia covering the area of 
pain. An interactive computer program can assist in select-
ing the most useful combination by working through all of 
the possible combinations with the patient and documenting 
the most useful responses. The lowest effective amplitude for 
stimulation should be selected. Sometimes patients choose 
a different amplitude when standing as opposed to reclining 
or sitting. Most patients prefer to feel paresthesia while they 
stimulate, but pain relief can occur with subthreshold stimula-
tion. The frequency of stimulation is adjusted based on patient 
comfort. The smallest effective pulse width is selected to re-
duce the amount of current used and to prolong battery life. 
 Implanted Hardware 
 Pulse Generator 
 The pulse generator is similar to a cardiac pacemaker and 
provides the impulse current to the electrode. Currently 
available pulse generators may be rechargeable or nonre-
chargeable. The rechargeable can be expected to last much 
longer before needing surgical replacement, but carries 
with it the inconvenience of requiring regular recharging. 
This is typically done for a few hours each week, by wearing 
a noninvasive induction coil type recharger unit over the 
pulse generator. Pulse generators now typically allow up to 
16 separate electrodes from multiple leads to be attached, 
although simpler 8 channel and 4 channel devices are avail-
able. An example of a rechargeable pulse generator is shown 
in   Figure 19.8  . The pulse generator is programmed non-
invasively by radio telemetry using a handheld program-
mer  ( Fig. 19.9 ) . An alternative to the pulse generator is an 
RF receiver, which requires an external power source with 
an antenna that must be placed directly over the receiver 
to activate the electrode. This system allows the patient to 
more easily control or manipulate the stimulation; although 
slightly less costly, it requires the patient to carry the exter-
nal unit. Systems based on RF are rarely implanted in the 
United States. 
 Electrode Leads 
 Several electrode styles are available, offering a variety of 
beneﬁ ts  ( Fig. 19.8 ) .

126 II 
Pain
 The percutaneously placed electrode allows easy place-
ment and is most commonly used for trial screening stimu-
lation. At some centers, the trial stimulation is done as a 
completely percutaneous procedure and the electrode is re-
moved regardless of the outcome. If the patient progresses 
to permanent implantation, a new electrode is placed. Avail-
able percutaneous leads have 4 or 8 contacts. 
 The laminectomy style electrode provides a larger, ﬂ at, 
paddle-shaped lead that is designed to reduce migration 
and to provide stimulation over a wider area. This lead is 
placed under direct vision, which some surgeons favor over 
the percutaneous technique. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Complications with this modality are frequent but, for-
tunately, are rarely serious. For patients using long-term 
dorsal column stimulation, the complication rate may ap-
proach 40%, and the most common problems relate to tech-
nical difﬁ culties with the equipment. Leads can fracture, 
with loss of stimulation, requiring replacement. The pulse 
generators require replacement when the battery has been 
drained. Migration continues to be a problem. When this 
occurs, the patient no longer experiences stimulation in 
a desirable location. With multiple contact leads, repro-
gramming can often overcome this situation, thus reduc-
ing the need for surgical repositioning. Lead fracture and 
migration are recognized by X-ray. More problematic is the 
loss of effective pain control despite technically adequate 
stimulation. There is no ideal solution to this problem. A 
“stimulation holiday” may restore responsiveness to the 
therapeutic beneﬁ t. 
 Infection is a potentially serious complication, occurs in 
about 4% of cases, and usually involves  Staphylococcus. In-
fection is treated by removing the unit and administering 
systemic antibiotics. 
 There is risk of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid leakage during implan-
tation. There is also risk of new neurological deﬁ cit; how-
ever, this has been rare. During surgery to revise equipment, 
it is very difﬁ cult to avoid injury to the electrodes and insu-
lation, so one must be prepared to replace the components. 
Using monopolar cautery rather than sharp dissection re-
duces, but does not eliminate, such risk. 
 Patients with dorsal column stimulators should not un-
dergo MRI.

 Glossopharyngeal Rhizotomy for 
Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia 
 Mark K. Stevens and Burton M. Onofrio 
 Patient Selection 
 Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms 
of pain in the sensory distribution of the 9th cranial nerve. 
Except for the location of the pain and sensory stimuli, which 
induce it, the attacks are identical to trigeminal neuralgia. 
The attacks are typiﬁ ed by a series of lancinating electric-
like jabs of pain in the region of the tonsil or posterior third 
of the tongue. Radiation to the external auditory meatus or 
angle of the mandible may make it difﬁ cult to differenti-
ate from trigeminal neuralgia involving the third division 
and pain arising from the nervus intermedius. Occasionally 
glossopharyngeal neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia of the 
third division may coexist and require surgical manipulation 
of both the 5th and the 9th cranial nerves. Glossopharyngeal 
neuralgia occurs with 1/70 the frequency of trigeminal neu-
ralgia. It is rarely bilateral. 
 The glossopharyngeal nerve is a mixed nerve. The special 
visceral efferent ﬁ bers, which innervate the stylopharyn-
geus muscle of the pharynx, originate in the nucleus am-
biguous. The general visceral efferent ﬁ bers, which supply 
the parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland, arise 
in the inferior salivatory nucleus and terminate in the otic 
ganglion. The general somatic afferent ﬁ bers supply the 
sensation to the back of the ear; their cell bodies are in the 
superior ganglion, and the central connections terminate 
in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. The general 
visceral afferent ﬁ bers supply sensation to the carotid sinus, 
carotid body, eustachian tube, pharynx, and tongue. The cell 
bodies are in the inferior (petrosal) ganglion, and the central 
connections terminate in the tractus solitarius. The special 
visceral afferent ﬁ bers from the taste receptors of the pos-
terior one third of the tongue, in like manner, have cell bod-
ies in the inferior (petrosal) ganglion and terminate in the 
tractus solitarius. The glossopharyngeal nerve emerges from 
the medulla, dorsal to the inferior olivary nucleus, sepa-
rated from the ﬁ bers of the 10th and 11th cranial nerves by 
a septation. The ganglia of the nerve lie within the jugular 
foramen  ( Fig. 20.1A ) . 
 When dilemmas arise as to the nerve or nerves of ori-
gin of the neuralgia, differential temporary blocks may 
be employed. Cocainization of the pharynx alleviates the 
9th nerve component of the pain and cocainization of the 
pyriform fossa relieves neuralgia of the superior laryngeal 
branch of the vagus. Blocking the foramen ovale with bupiv-
acaine determines the component of the pain due to the 
third division of the trigeminal nerve. A tetracaine block 
of the jugular foramen will block all afferent impulses via 
the 9th and 10th cranial nerves and help to discover that 
rare patient suffering from pain mediated by the nervus 
intermedius component of the 7th cranial nerve. Obviously, 
for the blocks to be reliable they must be done when the 
frequency of the attacks and stereotypic triggers are de-
pendable enough to allow the physician to appreciate the 
interruption in their occurrence to determine the efﬁ cacy 
and dependability of the block in sorting out which nerve 
or nerves are mediating the pain. 
 Although the medical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia 
may give gratifying results for years, we have not observed 
the same degree of efﬁ cacy of medical treatment in patients 
suffering from glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Intermittent re-
petitive alcohol blocks may effectively control the pain of 
trigeminal neuralgia, but the extracranial anatomy of the 
9th nerve makes alcohol block of this nerve impossible 
without incurring unacceptable 10th nerve dysfunction. 
 Preoperative Management 
 In determining the type of surgical treatment, the surgeon 
must be aware of the clinical phenomena associated with 
the hypersensitivity of the dorsal motor nucleus of the 
vagus, which include cardiac arrest, syncopy, and seizures. 
Section of the ninth and upper ﬁ bers of the tenth cranial 
nerves causes little or no neurologic deﬁ cit. Microvascular 
decompression (MVD) risks intraoperative cardiac abnor-
malities and invites recurrence of pain postoperatively and 
seems unwarranted. Authors have described hypertensive 
crisis and intra- and extracerebellar hemorrhage from 9th 
and 10th nerve manipulation during MVD. 
 Recent reports have shown very favorable results with 
MVD. These surgical techniques are similar, so one could 
make an intraoperative decision based on what is found. If 
a vessel seems to be the pathological etiology, MVD may be 
considered. On the other hand, if no vascular abnormality 
is seen one certainly could section the appropriate lower 
cranial nerves, which will be reviewed later in this chapter. 
If recurring symptoms occur after MVD, reoperation is more 
difﬁ cult than the original surgery and carries a higher risk 
of complications. 

128 II 
Pain
 Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic 
resonance angiography should be used to rule out the other 
etiologies such as tumors, vascular abnormalities such as 
arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms, or multiple 
sclerosis plaques. 
 Radiofrequency procedures for extracranial destruction 
of the 9th nerve are unacceptable in that, like extracranial 
alcohol blocks of the jugular foramen, they invite unaccept-
able tenth nerve dysfunction. Yet, some neurosurgeons per-
form such procedures with acceptable results. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Anesthesia and Positioning 
 The sitting position offers some surgical advantages, includ-
ing ease of surgical exposure and less blood pooling in the 
operative ﬁ eld. Some anesthesiologists believe that access 
to the endotracheal tube, the reduction of facial swelling, 
and the ability to observe facial nerve function are notable 
advantages of the sitting position in anesthetic manage-
ment. Hazards to the patient in the sitting position include 
venous air embolism, arterial hypotension, changes in vital 
signs caused by brainstem manipulation, airway obstruc-
tion, and position-related brainstem ischemia. Preoperative 
identiﬁ cation of a patent foramen ovale cordis is a relative 
contraindication to the sitting position. Another relative 
disadvantage of the sitting position is surgeon arm fatigue. 
The other surgical position commonly used is the lateral 
decubitus position (park bench position). When operating 
on elderly patients or on patients with patent foramen ovale 
cordis, this would be the preferred position. 
 At least two intravenous access sites are recommended 
for posterior fossa procedures. When electroneurophysi-
ologic monitoring is used and an awake baseline is sought, 
the patient is not sedated before those data are collected. 
The only exception to that situation is when an awake ﬁ ber- 
optic intubation is done and there is a need to perform som-
atosensory evoked potential monitoring after the endotra-
cheal tube has been placed. Neurodiagnostic intraoperative 
monitoring of pharyngeal reﬂ ex may reduce the incidence 
of motor root injury. 
 The anesthesia is induced, and an arterial line is placed. 
Then, a central venous line is placed from the arm, using 
electrocardiographic localization, to the high right atrium. 
Adequate anesthesia is administered for pinion placement 
and supplemented local anesthesia if necessary. If trans-

patient is now used as a positioning guideline. The arms are 
carefully padded and, equally important, are carefully sup-
ported. With the use of muscle relaxants, the weight of the 
arms is enough in some instances to cause stretch injuries 
of the brachial plexus. The knees are ﬂ exed to avoid sciatic 
tension and the buttocks are padded to prevent pressure in-
jury to the sciatic nerves. The Doppler monitor is placed and 
the right atrial catheter is ﬂ ushed vigorously with saline to 
conﬁ rm correct placement. The blood pressure transducer 
is placed at the head level. Blood pressure requires some 
support with vasopressors or lighter anesthesia in about 
25% of the cases. 
 Monitoring for air embolism can be approached from sev-
eral aspects. Monitors include a precordial or mass spectrom-
eter, transcutaneous oxygen expired nitrogen, right atrial 
catheter, and (least sensitive) the esophageal stethoscope. 
 Many surgeons use the park bench position for posterior 
fossa surgery, including that for cerebellopontine angle tu-
mor removal and MVD of the 5th cranial nerve. Orientation 
from an anatomic point of view and familiarity with a spe-
ciﬁ c positioning technique are integral to minimizing the 
risk of any operation. For surgeons who are familiar with 
the park bench positioning, the description of the surgi-
cal anatomy and orientation of the illustrations are equally 
valid for the sitting position by merely rotating the illustra-
tions 90 degrees. 
 Surgical Technique 
 The basic surgical approach is a low retrosigmoid crani-
ectomy. 
 The patient is placed in the upright sitting position in the 
pinion headrest, with the head ﬂ exed and rotated to the side 
of the glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Either an S-shaped or a 
hockey stick-shaped incision is made over the ipsilateral 
occipital bone. The 3 cm craniectomy is done inferiorly to 
incorporate the portion of the occipital bone, which lies di-
rectly adjacent to the foramen magnum and is oriented in a 
transverse plane directly above the lamina of the ﬁ rst cervi-
cal segment. If a rongeur is used for the craniectomy, there 
is increased risk of epidural hemorrhage  ( Fig. 20.2A–C ) . The 
high-speed drill obviates the need to introduce a rongeur 
beneath the inner table of the occipital bone so that there is 
less chance of a dissecting epidural clot intra- and postop-
eratively  ( Fig. 20.2D ) . The dural margin remains adherent to 
the edges of the craniectomy. 
 The dura is then opened in a cruciate fashion and tacked 
back over the craniectomy margin to the pericranium or 
occipital fascia or muscle layer to prevent a dissecting epi-
dural hemorrhage  ( Fig. 20.2E ) . The cerebellar hemisphere 
is elevated to expose the arachnoid of the cisterna magna, 
which is opened to allow cerebrospinal ﬂ uid to ﬂ ow and the 
cerebellum to relax. By identifying the sigmoid sinus as it 
traverses the posterior fossa ﬂ oor, the surgeon can achieve 
precise retractor position to identify the jugular foramen. 
Once the self-retaining retractor has been ﬁ xed in position, 
illumination by the overhead surgical lights and operating 
loupes is usually sufﬁ cient. The operating microscope may 
enhance visualization at this point. The 9th cranial nerve in 
the jugular foramen is always separated by a dural septum 
from the 10th and 11th cranial nerves and jugular vein  ( Fig. 
20.1B ) . 
 The 9th nerve and upper one sixth to one eighth of the ﬁ la-
ments of the 10th nerve are sectioned with the aid of a black 
spatula or blunt hook and bipolar coagulation  ( Fig. 20.1C ) . 
The dural opening may then be closed by using pericranium, 
fascia lata, or homologous dura as a graft, or by closing the 
dura primarily. Closure of the bony defect with cranioplasty, 
mesh, or bone cement not only makes for better cosmesis 
but may lead to fewer postoperative headaches due to mus-
cular adhesions to the posterior fossa dura mater.

 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Although sensation is diminished over the pharynx and the 
gag reﬂ ex is abolished on the side of the divided nerve, and 
although discrete neurologic testing reveals absence of taste 
over the ipsilateral posterior one-third of the tongue, we, 
like Dandy, have never noted more than a transient distur-
bance in swallowing. With sectioning of the 9th and upper 
rootlets of the 10th cranial nerves, auricular ﬂ utter, tachy-
cardia, hypertension, ectopic ventricular contractions, and 
cardiac arrhythmias have been noted. Most of these events 
are transient intraoperative events. 
 Conclusions 
 Results conﬁ rm that the intracranial section of glossopha-
ryngeal and upper vagal rootlets cures vagoglossopharyn-
geal neuralgia with minimal complications. The incidence of 
motor root injury may be further reduced by intraoperative 
monitoring. MVD is an option; however, recurrent symptoms 
are possible. Therefore, many neurosurgeons restrict the MVD 
procedure to cases of severe compression involving the cau-
dal vagal rootlets, bilateral vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia, 
and contralateral vocal cord paralysis. Percutaneous thermal 
rhizotomy relieves the pain of vagoglossopharyngeal neu-
ralgia, but may be associated with higher incidence of vagal 
nerve root injury. Extracranial section of the glossopharyngeal 
or vagal nerves has a high recurrence rate and should be re-
stricted to patients who cannot tolerate another procedure.

  Motor Cortex Stimulation for Central and 
Neuropathic Pain 
 Jeffrey A.  Brown 
  Motor cortex stimulation is a form of neuromodulation used 
to ameliorate pain in central and neuropathic pain syn-
dromes. Such syndromes include pain conditions derived 
from thalamic, putaminal, and lateral medullary infarction; 
trigeminal nerve injury; postherpetic neuralgia, brachial 
plexopathy; spinal cord injury; and phantom limb pain. The 
ﬁ rst publication on the use of motor cortex stimulation for 
the treatment of intractable central pain was in 1991. Tsub-
okawa et al.  described the results of treating seven patients 
with thalamic pain, achieving excellent or good pain control 
without complications. Even in this ﬁ rst study, the authors 
observed improved movement of painful limbs. There was 
also increased cortical blood ﬂ ow and a rise in temperature 
in the painful limbs. 
 A more comprehensive evaluation of the beneﬁ ts of motor 
cortex stimulation ensued in a second publication by Tsub-
okawa et al.  In a series of 11 patients with central pain after 
putaminal or thalamic hemorrhage treated with motor cor-
tex stimulation for two years, more than 80% pain relief was 
maintained in 5 of the 11 patients. Meyerson et al.  were later 
able to relieve more than 50% of pain in 5 patients in a series 
of 10 patients. Only patients who had trigeminal neuropathic 
pain beneﬁ ted from stimulation, perhaps because there was 
no predictable technique for accurately localizing the stimu-
lating electrodes. Facial cortical representation is extensive 
and easier to locate. Meyerson et al. also observed additional 
beneﬁ ts from stimulation. In patients who received pain re-
lief there was reduced allodynia, dysesthesia, and hyperaes-
thesia during periods of stimulation. Katayama et al.  treated 
4 patients with motor cortex stimulation who no longer 
beneﬁ ted from deep brain stimulation of the ventroposte-
rolateral thalamic relay nucleus for their pain relief. These 
patients then reported 40–60% pain relief. Another patient 
whose ventroposterolateral nuclear stimulation was unsuc-
cessful later received relief with motor cortical stimulation. 
 Later studies have improved the surgical technique and 
observed better treatment results. Nguyen et al.  mapped out 
epidural stimulation sites that lead to the best pain relief. 
They noted that there was somatotopic correlation with the 
corresponding motor cortical focus for the region of pain. 
Computerized neuronavigational imaging of the motor cortex 
could be used to simplify planning for electrode placement. 
The procedure thus made use of a virtual representation of 
the cortical surface to identify the target for pain relief. In a 
series of 12 patients with medically intractable neuropathic 
facial pain, Nguyen et al. were able to provide 75% good to 
excellent pain relief. In patients with central pain, substantial 
pain relief was obtained in 10 of 14 patients  (77%). 
 Cerebral blood ﬂ ow increases during stimulation in the 
ipsilateral thalamus, cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, 
and midbrain. The extent of pain relief correlates best with 
anterior cingulate gyrus blood ﬂ ow. Functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that the cingulate 
gyrus is involved in the suffering element of chronic pain. 
Motor cortex stimulation improves motor function not just 
pain control. Improved thalamic hand syndrome, spastic-
ity, action tremor, intention myoclonus, advanced Parkinson 
symptoms, and motor functional recovery after stroke have 
been observed after intermittent or constant stimulation. 
 Laboratory studies of motor cortex stimulation show 
selective reduction in spinal cord dorsal horn neuronal 
responsiveness to pinch, but not to brush stimuli. When 
stimulation ceases, the effect on dorsal spinal cord neurons 
ceases. Two mechanisms for this diminished responsiveness 
are hypothesized. There may be either direct activation of 
inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord or indirect inhibi-
tion during stimulation. 
 Patient Selection 
 Indications for Surgery 
 The best indication for motor cortex stimulation is facial 
neuropathic pain that is no longer responsive to medical 
treatment. Medical treatment usually consists of anticon-
vulsant medications, including carbamazepine or gabapen-
tin, often in combination with antidepressants. Trigeminal 
nerve injury at the nerve root, the ganglion level, or periph-
erally are common causes of the neuropathic pain. Other 
causes of pain include postherpetic neuralgia and central 
pain that results from thalamic or lateral medullary stroke. 
Trigeminal neuralgia is not an indication. However, trigemi-
nal nerve injury that results from the surgical treatment of 
trigeminal neuralgia and causes primary burning, dyses-
thetic discomfort is an indication. 
 Other indications include phantom limb pain, neuropathic 
spinal cord injury pain at the level of injury, brachial plexus 
injury pain, and postherpetic neuralgia at sites other than 
the face. Only scattered case reports discuss the use of motor 

132 II 
Pain
cortex stimulation for complex regional pain syndrome or 
when spinal cord stimulation has failed to provide adequate 
pain relief for other forms of peripheral neuropathic pain. 
 Contraindications to motor cortex stimulation include ep-
ilepsy and limitations in a patient’s ability to communicate 
the nature of the pain; for example, because of dementia 
or aphasia, and inability to tolerate even a light general an-
esthesia. Severe depression or psychotic disorders that can 
be screened with a neuropsychological evaluation are also 
relative contraindications. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The surgical technique has been reﬁ ned since the initial 
description by Tsubokawa et al.  First, a treatment plan is 
created using an MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan 
that is integrated into a neuronavigational system. Some 
cen ters are also able to integrate functional MRI. The target 
is selected on the primary motor cortex based on anatomic 
landmarks. The target for facial pain is located anterior to 
the central sulcus at the level of the inferior frontal sulcus 
as seen on the sagittal MRI or CT  ( Fig. 21.1 ) . A light, general 
endotracheal anesthesia is induced. 
 Operative Procedure 
 A craniotomy is performed and centered over the region of 
the precentral and postcentral gyri, exposing the dura. The 
central sulcus at the level of hand function may be identiﬁ ed 
by using median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials 
and determining N20 P20 phase shift. This is accomplished 
by placing a four-plate paddle electrode perpendicular to 
the presumed region of the central sulcus. Stimulation is 
performed between adjacent pairs of electrodes along the 
paddle while holding it steady against the dura. The central 
sulcus in the hand area is located when the somatosensory 
evoked potential at the wrist undergoes a phase reversal be-
tween two adjacent electrodes, indicating those electrodes 
are “straddling” the sulcus  ( Fig. 21.2 ) . The paddle electrode 
is typically moved up and down along the dura to locate the 
hand area, then in the anterior or posterior direction until 
the central sulcus is located; a superﬁ cial suture in the outer 
layer of the dura can be used to mark this location. Cortical 
mapping is then performed. Electromyographic recordings 
during cortical stimulation in the target muscles of the region 
of pain determine the site of maximal electromyographic re-
sponse to stimulation. The exact locations of the electrodes 
will vary depending on the area of pain being covered. Once 
the desired region is located, a four-plate electrode paddle 
array, or two four-plate arrays are sutured to the dura, paral-
lel or perpendicular to the central sulcus, overlying the pri-
mary motor cortex  ( Fig. 21.3 ) . Often patients have residual 
pain relief from the intraoperative stimulation that persists 
for hours after emerging from anesthesia. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Several days of trial stimulation then proceed. When pain 
relief is substantial, or at least greater than 50%, the pulse 
generator is implanted in a second procedure. Subthreshold

nance images (MRIs) showing the target for stimulation in 
a patient with neuropathic facial pain. The target is located 
posterior to the split seen in the inferior frontal sulcus and 
anterior to the central sulcus located at the level of the su-
perior aspect of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle at 
the level of the third ventricle as seen on the coronal MRI.

 
21 Motor Cortex Stimulation for Central and Neuropathic Pain 133
stimulation relieves pain. Stimulation parameters vary but 
it is done at low frequency (40 Hz), usually low pulse width 
(90 millisecondsec), and low amplitudes (2–10 V). Some 
centers target stimulation amplitude at a percentage of mo-
tor threshold. More difﬁ cult to treat pain syndromes (such 
as anesthesia dolorosa) need higher energy delivery. 
 Reprogramming 
 Programming of motor cortex stimulation is different from 
the programming commonly done for spinal neuromodula-
tion. Because the stimulation parameters are subthreshold 
and based on the motor system, there are no paresthesias to 
guide the physician or patient to the comfortable program-
ming level. Optimal stimulation is the level of stimulation 
that provides the best pain relief, yet does not cause a seizure, 
pain from dural stimulation, or electromyographic activity. 
Empirical starting parameters for the amplitude are 2–4 V. 
 Stimulation may be intermittent or continuous. To pre-
serve battery life, some patients turn the pulse generator 
off while they are asleep. There is no permanent pain relief 
from cortical stimulation. Pain recurs shortly after stopping 
stimulation. 
 Morbidity 
 Seizures may occur, usually during intraoperative cortical 
mapping for placing the stimulator or later, during stimula-
tion parameter adjustment. Kindling and epilepsy have not 
occurred. Bezard et al.  have studied the effect of motor cor-
tex stimulation in primates. Though stimulation could cause 
reversible seizures, neither epilepsy nor a reduced threshold 
for kindling of seizure occurred. Epidural hematomas have 
been associated with the surgery, but without neurologic 
injury. Stimulator pocket infections and electrode wire frac-
tures occur. All these are known complications of the implan-
tation of neuromodulation equipment and are not unique to 
motor cortex stimulation. Pulse generators have varying life 
spans depending on the intensity of clinical use. 
 Conclusions 
 Motor cortex stimulation represents a paradigm change in 
the treatment of central and neuropathic pain syndromes 
and potentially the treatment of movement disorders and 
paresis associated with stroke. The morbidity is low and 
pain relief signiﬁ cant in patients who are otherwise not 
amenable to medical or surgical treatment. Clinical trials 
published after this technique was introduced a dozen years 
ago continue to show favorable pain relief in this difﬁ cult to 
treat population of patients.

 Chronic Electrical Brain Stimulation for 
Refractory Chronic Pain 
      Andre   Machado,     Brian Harris   Kopell    , and Ali R.   Rezai  
  Chronic pain of benign noncancerous origin is one of the 
most common heath problems in the world. Several treat-
ment modalities are available for patients with chronic 
pain. For medication and other modality refractory patients, 
several alternatives exist ranging from chronic epidural or 
intrathecal infusion to electricity-based neuromodulation 
approaches such as spinal cord stimulation, motor cortex 
stimulation (MCS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). MCS 
and DBS are the major two options for intracranial surgery 
when all other approaches have failed. 
 Patient Selection 
 Patient selection is the most critical step involved in DBS 
for pain. Patients considered for these procedures should 
not only have high ratings in pain scales, but should also be 
at least partially disabled by their pain conditions to justify 
the degree of intervention and risk. A key aspect of whether 
a patient is a reasonable candidate for these procedures re-
volves around a patient’s expectation of potential beneﬁ ts. It 
is useful to ask the patient if a reduction in pain by 40–50% 
would be meaningful to the quality of life and whether this 
would lead to more independence or productivity. 
 All patients who are considering the procedure should 
undergo a formal evaluation with a psychologist experi-
enced in the ﬁ eld of chronic pain. Chronic pain patients 
may have personality disorders, untreated psychiatric dis-
ease, and other comorbidities that should be ruled out, or 
at least taken into consideration, during the decision-mak-
ing process. Issues of secondary gain, especially pending 
legal actions where money rewards are implicit, may in-
ﬂ uence patient satisfaction from surgical interventions for 
pain. DBS entails implantation of hardware; if the patient 
has difﬁ culty operating basic new technologies, candidacy 
should be reconsidered. Patients and their families must 
have the commitment to return to the clinic for program-
ming as needed.

22 
Chronic Electrical Brain Stimulation for Refractory Chronic Pain 135
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Thalamic anatomy and parcellation can be described ac-
cording to several nomenclatures. In this discussion, prefer-
ence is given to follow the nomenclature proposed by Has-
sler, which is used in the Schaltenbrandt and Warren atlas . 
In this nomenclature, the sensory thalamus is referred to as 
the ventrocaudalis (Vc) nucleus. In another classiﬁ cation, 
the sensory thalamus is referred to as the ventral-poste-
rior (VP) nucleus, which is divided into two main sensory 
components; the VPM (medial) corresponds to the thalamic 
sensory representation of the face while the VPL (lateral) 
has the representation of the trunk and limbs  ( Fig. 22.1 ) . 
 In this chapter, we will describe the two most commonly 
used and reported targets: the sensory thalamus (Vc) and 
the periventricular/periaqueductal gray areas (PVGs/PAGs). 
Some authors have divided pain patients in two main groups: 
nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Patients with noci-
ceptive pain were believed to respond best to central gray 
matter stimulation; those with neuropathic pain were as-
signed to stimulation of the sensory thalamus. 
 Stereotactic MRI should be acquired before surgery for 
preoperative planning of the targets and trajectories. The 
parcellation of the thalamus in its nuclei cannot be directly 
visualized by either 1.5T or 3T MRI. Consequently, the pur-
pose of MRI is to accurately identify the anterior commis-
sure (AC) and the posterior commissure (PC), which serve as 
the main landmarks for the procedure (  Fig. 22.2 ) . The initial 
target can be determined indirectly by using coordinates 
based on the midcommissural point (the midpoint between 
AC and PC). 
 Ventrocaudalis Targeting 
 The sensory nucleus is the target of interest. The coordi-
nates for the Vc can be approximated at 11–16 mm lateral 
to the wall of the third ventricle, 0–2 mm anterior to the 
PC and at the level of the AC-PC plane. The face area can be 
approximated to be 13 mm from the midline, upper extrem-
ity 15 mm and lower extremity 17 mm from the midline. 
The width of the third ventricle can inﬂ uence the lateral-
ity of the target as the thalamus is pushed more laterally. 
In addition to the MCP guided coordinate determination, 
the thalamic sensory nucleus can be targeted by fusing a 
formatable computerized version of the Schaltenbrand and 
Warren atlas to the patient’s MRI. 
 Periventricular Gray Area Targeting 
 Preoperative targeting to the PVG is done in a similar fash-
ion, with the same landmarks. The coordinates for the PVG 
are about 2–3 mm lateral from the wall of the posterior 
part of the third ventricle. In the anterior-posterior direc-
tion, the target can be approximated at 5 mm anterior to 
the posterior commissure. As for the sensory thalamus, in 
the dorsoventral plane, the target is set at the AC-PC plane. 
The somatotopy of the PVG is less well determined than 
for the Vc, but a recent report  has suggested that repre-
sentation of the face is ventral while the lower extremity 
is dorsally located. 
 Choice of the bur hole location will determine the entry 
point and, consequently, the trajectory to either target. The 
thalamic nuclei are relatively vertical (in their longest axis) 
in relation to the AC-PC plane. To at least partially mimic 
the orientation of the sensory nucleus, it is advantageous 
to have a trajectory as vertical as possible. This will allow 
most of the span between the most ventral and dorsal con-
tacts of the DBS electrode to lie within the intended nucleus. 
Typically, the trajectory has a rostral inclination of 20–30 
degrees to avoid an entry point near the precentral cor-

tex. This angulation will cause the microelectrode to cross 
initially the ventral-medial (VIM)  nucleus before entering 
the sensory thalamus  ( Fig. 22.3 ) . Identifying the transition 
between this nucleus and the Vc serves as a landmark dur-
ing microelectrode recording, which determines the ante-
rior wall of the intended Vc target. In the coronal plane, 
the trajectory should be as parasagittal as possible. In most 
instances, a 10–15 degree angle is necessary to avoid large 
vessels such as the venous lakes near the sagittal sinus. 
 In addition to facilitating microelectrode recording and 
optimizing the orientation of the ﬁ nal DBS implant, the tra-
jectory is also planned to minimize risk of injury to intracra-
nial vessels. Injection of Gadolinium during the MRI proce-
dure enhances the venous system. These vascular elements 
can be seen along or near the planned trajectory and should 
be avoided.  Figure 22.4 shows an ependymal vessel in the 
vicinity of a planned trajectory to the sensory thalamus. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The techniques of DBS are described in the literature for 
movement disorders and are now well established. Surgeons 
familiar with the techniques of DBS for tremor and with tha-
lamic nuclear anatomy will be familiar with the techniques 
employed in thalamic stimulation for chronic pain. Several 
head frame and stereotactic systems are commercially avail-
able, so choice of frames and methods of preoperative imag-
ing and targeting (CT or MRI, or both) depends largely the 
surgeon’s preferences and familiarity. 
 The patient is brought to the operating room after the 
preoperative planning has been completed and is positioned 
supine. The head frame is attached to the operating table 
using an adapter to the Mayﬁ eld head holder. The patient 
is then sedated and the head is prepped and draped. The 
stereotactic arc is positioned on the head frame. The tar-
get coordinates are set and conﬁ rmed by more than one 
member of the surgical team. The anterior-posterior and 
medial-lateral angles are set, as determined by preoperative 
trajectory planning. The location of the bur hole is marked 
on the scalp. The 14 mm bur hole is created with a perfora-
tor aligned to the angles of the planned electrode penetra-
tion. This is important to avoid impacting the electrodes to 
the inner edge of the bur hole during the procedure. The 
cannula and microelectrode are mounted on the microdrive 
( Fig. 22.5 ).  The blood pressure should be under optimal 
control (systolic lower than 130 mm Hg) before the can-
nula penetrates the brain and should be carefully managed 
throughout the procedure to minimize the risk of intracer-
ebral hemorrhages. 
 Many strategies exist for microelectrode recording. It is 
also possible to target the thalamic nuclei without micro-

is the sensory thalamus. Given the angle of approach, the 
electrode will ﬁ rst cross the VL  before reaching the border 
to the sensory thalamus. The depth at which the transition 
between VL and the sensory thalamus occurs serves as a 
landmark for microelectrode recording.

electrode recording, using macrostimulation only. This chap-
ter focuses on mapping the Vc with microelectrode record-
ing followed by insertion of the macroelectrode and target 
conﬁ rmation with intraoperative macrostimulation. Macro-
stimulation alone will be described for PVG implantation. 
 Microelectrode recording in the thalamus starts at a 
distance dorsal from the actual target. The span between 
these two points is passed by the microelectrode at submil-
limetric increments, controlled by a microdrive. We start 
the recording tract 15 mm above the target. As the elec-
trode is advanced, the dorsal nuclear tier of the thalamus 
is found, followed by the ventral tier. Trajectories anterior 
to the surgical target will traverse the VIM nucleus. In this 
region, cells can be identiﬁ ed and isolated, and will respond 
to passive kinesthetic stimuli. The transition between this 
and the sensory nuclei is marked by cells that respond not 
yet to light touch but to pressure. As the electrode advances 
into the Vc, cells that respond crisply to light touch can be 
found. The receptive ﬁ elds (RFs) can be quite small, making 
it necessary to search for responses from face to toe on the 
contralateral hemibody. In patients with either peripheral 
or central deafferentation, one can expect signiﬁ cant re-
organization of the somatotopy. If the Vc is found only at 
the very end of the tract, it indicates that the targeting was 
too anterior. Because of the expected reorganization of the 
natural parcellation and somatotopy, multiple tracts may be 
necessary to identify the area that best matches the soma-
totopy of the patient’s pain. Microstimulation can be used 
in the areas that respond to light touch. The microstimula-
tion effects are referred to as the projected ﬁ elds (PF). The 
RF from MER and the PF from microstimulation will typi-
cally have a close somatotopic match. However, in cases of 
thalamic deafferentation and stroke, the RF and PF may not 
be congruent. In these instances, it is best to rely on micro-
stimulation PF rather than the RF as a predictor of results 
of macrostimulation. Once microelectrode stimulation has 
reﬁ ned the target for implantation, the macroelectrode (the 
DBS electrode) can be implanted at that location of soma-
totopic interest. 
 There are two commercially available DBS electrodes 
(Metronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The 3387 model has 4 
contacts with 1.5 mm height separated by 1.5 mm spaces. 
The 3389 model has contacts with the same size but the 
spacing is reduced, 0.5 mm. The total spans of contacts are 
10.5 mm and 7.5 mm, respectively. Given the reduced di-
mensions of the thalamic nuclei and the potential need for 
limited stimulation ﬁ elds, the more compact 3389 model 
may be preferred. The electrode is mounted on the micro-
drive and advanced to target. Intraoperative ﬂ uoroscopy is 
aligned to the frame to conﬁ rm the depth of implantation. 
 For the Vc, intraoperative testing with the macroelec-
trode can predict the postoperative programming results. 
All contacts should be tested in a systematic fashion. Pulse 
width is often in the 60–90 μs  range. Stimulation frequency 
is in the 25–100 Hz range with 50 Hz frequency being the 
most common. Stimulation results in paresthesias that can 
be described as a warmth, vibration, tingling, and buzzing 
by the patient. Faster rates may produce uncomfortable 
sensation. A combination that produces paresthesias over 
the entire area of pain should be found. Ideally, stimulation 
should be restricted to the painful area, although some 
“extra” stimulation is frequently obtained covering the 
areas outside the pain. Failure to obtain proper coverage 
with paresthesias should prompt the surgeon to consider 
moving the electrode to another location. The results can 
guide the next location. For example, if the desired cover-
age is in the leg but stimulation is accomplished in the 
upper extremity only, the next penetration should be more 
lateral, following the organization of the sensory thalamus 
(  Fig. 22.1 ) . 
 In PVG implantation, macrostimulation can produce a 
sensation of warmth in the area of pain or pain relief at 
low amplitudes. Increasing the amplitudes may cause eye 
bobbing or other side effects such a dizziness or presyncope 
sensation. Lower frequencies, in the range of 5–35 Hz, have 
been associated with better pain results. 
 The electrodes can be secured at the optimal locations 
with a bur hole cap, miniplates, or acrylic. Live ﬂ uoroscopy 
is used in the process of disassembling the microdrive to 
ascertain that the electrode is not dislodged in the pro cess. 
Once it is locked in place with the bur hole device, the elec-
trode is connected to an extension wire, which is exter-
nalized for the testing period. The excess electrode can be 
coiled in the subcutaneous tissue (  Fig. 22.6 ) and the incision 
is closed with special attention to prevent damage to the 
electrode. Larger coils instead of multiple small coils tend 
provide more slack for the second-stage implantable pulse 
generator  (IPG) implantation. Implantation of the IPG is of-
fered to patients that respond well to the trial period.

 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Trial Stimulation 
 Stimulation of the sensory thalamus produces paresthesias 
in the corresponding somatotopy, giving the programmer 
constant feedback about the location of stimulation. The 
contact combination, pulse widths, and amplitudes can be 
adjusted until optimal coverage with paresthesias is ob-
tained in the distribution of pain. Programming is initiated 
with a survey of effects produced with each contact set as 
the cathode. The contact that produces paresthesias closest 
to the area of pain is elected as the cathode. The anode can 
be set to a contact proximal or distal to the cathode until par-
esthesias are produced in the desired area. The pulse width 
is adjusted along with the amplitudes, to produce stimula-
tion that covers as much of the painful area as possible, 
while limiting the spread of stimulation to nonpainful areas. 
The frequency of stimulation is adjusted to produce pleasant 
paresthesias. Stimulation around 50 Hz is often reported to 
be most pleasant, but there is individual variability. More 
than one programming session is usually necessary. 
 The PVG should be stimulated with stepwise increments 
in amplitudes to avoid acute changes in blood pressure or 
heart rate. The thresholds for side effects can be determined 
and amplitudes set at 50–70% of these thresholds. Contact 0 
(the ventral-most contact) is more likely to cover leg pain. 
Dorsal contacts can be activated as cathodes to optimize 
coverage of the upper extremities. 
 The trial period is critical for decision making. Internaliza-
tion of the system should be offered to patients who present 
at least a 40–50% pain relief and are convinced that results 
will be meaningful to quality of life and activity levels. Deep 
brain stimulation tends to be more effective in the manage-
ment of pain at the early phases and is known to gradually 
loose efﬁ cacy over time. Patients who do not respond well 
in the trial period are very unlikely to have good long-term 
beneﬁ ts. For good responders who undergo permanent im-
plantation, stimulation “holidays” can be useful in main-
taining the efﬁ cacy of stimulation or recapturing lost ef-
ﬁ cacy. The surgical team should be available for periodical 
reprogramming sessions when the patient loses efﬁ cacy. 
It is frequently possible to regain beneﬁ ts that were lost 
over time with minor modiﬁ cations in programming such as 
small increments in amplitude or changes in frequency. 
 Complications 
 The surgical-related complications of DBS are similar to 
those for movement disorders because they fundamentally 
involve the same techniques. In 800 electrodes implanted 
at the Cleveland Clinic, the rate of postoperative hemor-
rhage seen on the CT scan was 2.25% per lead; symptomatic 
hemorrhages accounted for 0.75% per lead placement. Infec-
tious complications that required interventions affected 3% 
of DBS systems. 
 Prevention of intracranial hemorrhage is a major safety 
concern throughout the surgical procedure. Careful planning 
of the trajectories is aimed at avoiding blood vessels. During 
the procedure, careful management of the blood pressure 
is needed. If hemorrhage is seen, the cannula should not be 
removed until the bleeding stops. Meanwhile, careful and 
slow irrigation with a spinal needle shorter than the can-
nula is used to facilitate the drainage of blood accumulated 
in the brain. 
 Infections initiate more commonly in the IPG site than 
in the scalp. Superﬁ cial infections can be managed with 
antibiotic agents, but pus involving the hardware requires 
explanation of the system for adequate treatment. When a 
decision is made to treat an infection medically, it is neces-
sary to follow the patient with special attention to the risk 
that the infection will track the electrode system intracra-
nially and cause meningitis or cerebritis. This intracranial 
involvement of the infection is, however, rare.

  Deep Brain Stimulation for Medically 
Intractable Pain Syndromes 
 Pantaleo  Romanelli and Gary Heit 
  Medically intractable pain syndromes can be caused by a 
variety of factors inducing damage to the nervous tissue 
and subsequent induction of neuropathic pain. Deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) is one of many procedures available to the 
clinician to treat medically intractable pain. Choosing DBS 
over other neurostimulation options (motor cortex or spinal 
cord stimulation) requires a complex evaluation inﬂ uenced 
by the etiology and topographic pattern of pain. 
 Patient Selection 
 The initial evaluation of patients for DBS for pain should 
carefully assess whether the pain is medically intractable. 
Ideally, all patients should be screened by a physician with 
experience in the medical management of chronic pain syn-
dromes. A detailed history of the nature, location, and onset 
of the pain is needed. Documentation of prior interventions 
inclusive of medication trials, physical therapy, and cogni-
tive behavioral therapy is required. The latter is important 
for its potential for pain relief and to assess the presence and 
severity of potential underlying psychiatric disorders, which 
can be relative or absolute contraindications for implanta-
tion of any neuromodulation device. 
 Alternative surgical therapies to DBS such as spinal cord 
stimulation, intrathecal medications, motor cortex stimula-
tion, and ablative surgery should always be considered. The 
option of ablative surgery directed to central nervous system 
targets has not, for the most part, been proven to be an effec-
tive long-lasting therapy for the management of chronic pain. 
More often than not, this is reserved for patients with short-
ened life spans because the recurrence rate of pain caused by 
central nervous system plasticity is quite high. 
 In all cases of pain management it is important to correct 
underlying anatomical pathophysiological mechanisms that 
induce or perpetuate pain. For example, DBS should not be 
used as a ﬁ rst-line treatment for spondylolytic disease. But 
it may be appropriate for patients who have failed conserva-
tive or ﬁ rst-line surgical therapies for postlaminectomy syn-
dromes such as spinal cord stimulation. 
 When DBS appears to be a reasonable option for a speciﬁ c 
pain syndrome, it is important to explain the risks and ben-
eﬁ ts of surgery. Surgical complications for DBS range are 6–
25%, including the immediate perioperative and the chronic 
postoperative states. The higher complication rates were 
reported in the older literature and may reﬂ ect a less reﬁ ned 
implantation technique. Most authors now concur about 
single digit DBS complication rates. Reported complications 
include intracranial hemorrhage with subsequent focal neu-
rologic deﬁ cits, perioperative or delayed infection (up to 6
 months), and skin erosion over the implant. Reported ben-
eﬁ ts in the literature vary greatly, but a conservative meta-
analysis suggests that about 50% of the patients will experi-
ence a 50% or greater symptomatic gain. Loss of stimulation 
efﬁ cacy over time is a well-described phenomenon, which 
may or may not respond to changes of stimulation param-
eters. In general, we use a conservative approach, informing 
patients that DBS implantation is efﬁ cacious in about 50% of 
the cases and has a complication rate around 5%. 
 Stereotactic Targets for DBS in Medically Intractable 
Pain 
 There are two well established DBS targets for chronic pain 
syndromes. The ﬁ rst target, the ventralis caudalis (VC) nu-
cleus of the sensory thalamus is considered the best target 
for neuropathic pain syndromes. This target is indicated for 
patients with burning paresthesias, denervation pain, and 
peripheral neuropathies. Thalamic targets are indicated for 
pain in a broad multidermatomal distribution given the com-
pact representation of the homunculus. Patients whose neu-
ropathic pain syndrome is centered on a single dermatome 
or radicular distribution may beneﬁ t more from spinal cord 
stimulation. In contrast, nociceptive pain processes most 
likely will respond to stimulation in the periaqueductal gray 
region (PAG) or periventricular gray region (PVG). These tar-
gets are often used for patients whose pain responds to opi-
ates. Other central nervous system DBS targets have been 
poorly characterized and consist of the internal capsule, the 
intralaminar thalamic nuclei (including the centromedian-
parafascicular complex, the centrolateral nucleus, and oth-
ers), the nucleus of Fuxe-Hallstrom, and the pulvinar. We 
have implanted the centromedian nucleus (CM) in patients 
with central pain associated with thalamic or thalamocap-
sular strokes. DBS involving the CM appears to have com-
parable efﬁ cacy to VC DBS. This target can be quite useful 
for patients who may not undergo motor cortex stimulation 
(MCS) because of damage to the pyramidal pathways and 
consequent motor impairment (a factor strongly reducing 

140 II 
Pain
the efﬁ cacy of MCS) and for patients whose lateral thalamus 
has been damaged. A further target recently described is the 
posterior hypothalamic region to treat severe cases of clus-
ter headache. This target has proved, so far, to be the most 
effective procedure for pain and vasogenic changes induced 
by cluster headache. 
 Electrophysiological Conﬁ rmation 
 A guiding principle of DBS surgery is that the anatomi-
cal target loosely deﬁ nes the intended placement for the 
stimulating electrode, but that ﬁ nal target selection re-
quires some form of physiological mapping. For example, 
although identiﬁ cation and initial entry into sensory tha-
lamus may be based on anatomical data, it is essential to 
deﬁ ne the thalamic homunculus physiologically and place 
the electrode accordingly. Individual anatomical variations 
or homunculus distortion caused by denervation may alter 
the target location, especially in the sensory thalamus. The 
two methodologies most commonly employed to achieve 
electrophysiological conﬁ rmation are stimulation and re-
cording of the neural activity. 
 Micro- and macro-stimulating techniques deﬁ ne the sen-
sory representation in thalamus by induction of paresthesias. 
In the case of the PVG or PAG targets, stimulation will induce 
feelings of warmth or well being when the proper target is 
stimulated. Thresholds for macrostimulation should be 1–3 
mAmp or 1 to 3 V, depending on the stimulating device used 
(constant current or voltage stimulator). Single-cell electro-
physiology is generally accepted as a more accurate way to 
deﬁ ne the borders of a given target and to acquire detailed 
information about physiological topography. Microelec-
trode mapping provides excellent resolution in identifying 
symptomatic areas of the thalamic sensory homunculus. 
The goal of microelectrode recording is to determine the 
anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and superior-inferior ex-
tent of the homunculus, possible functional distortions, and 
the subsequent ﬁ nal DBS target. The DBS target is the tissue 
containing cells that respond to sensory stimulation near 
or in the region of pain. Subsequent test stimulation using 
the DBS electrode conﬁ rms placement accuracy and checks 
for potential untoward side effects. Levels of stimulation 
higher than 1–3 mAmp or 1–3 V may recruit more distant 
structures and lead to erroneous clinical judgments. 
 Optimal placement of the stimulating electrode should 
be in the centroid of the somatotopic region of the target 
where the pain is represented. In targets with somatotopic 
or homuncular representations, we usually employ three 
to ﬁ ve microelectrode tracks to deﬁ ne the spatial organiza-
tion of the target. There is little evidence to suggest that 
increased numbers of microelectrode tracks lead to a major 
risk of intracranial hemorrhage. 
 It is important to have some means of radiographic iden-
tiﬁ cation of the electrode tracks intraoperatively or explicit 
knowledge that the stereotactic system used is free of me-
chanical distortions. Assuming mechanical accuracy may 
contribute to a lower clinical success rate if either the map-
ping or ﬁ nal DBS electrode deviates from its intended ﬁ nal 
locus. This is particularly important when performing mi-
croelectrode tracks, where there is a potential for displace-
ment and subsequent deviation from the planned trajec-
tory. We have found that erroneous spatial assignment of 
physiology by 1–3 mm can be easily caused by mechanical 
displacement of microelectrodes tracks. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Preoperative Evaluation 
 Laboratory assessments include assessment of electrolyte 
imbalances that may lead to decreased seizure threshold, a 
routine hematocrit, and coagulation studies. Preparation for 
blood transfusion is unwarranted. 
 Surgical Planning 
 As in all stereotactic procedures, presurgical image planning 
is crucial for a successful operative intervention. Anatomical 
deﬁ nitions of DBS targets for pain are based on a Cartesian 
coordinate system anchored to a line projected between 
the anterior and posterior commissures (AC-PC line). The 
anterior and posterior commissures are best identiﬁ ed on 
sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed to-
mography (CT)  ( Fig. 23.1 ) . Subsequent surgical planning can 
then be performed on axial oblique scans acquired parallel 
to the AC-PC line or on reformatted images on a surgical 
planning workstation. MRI (alone or fused with a CT scan to 
remove the MRI spatial distortion) is preferred over CT im-
aging for the improved tissue resolution. Choice of speciﬁ c 
MRI sequences should be based on an understanding of the 
inherent spatial distortion of each individual scan sequence 
on the practitioner’s imaging system. We recommend the 
surgical planning MRI acquisition to include not only the 
centro-encephalic target region but also the cortex to de-
ﬁ ne the cortical entry point and the trajectory to the target. 
Critical neural structures (primary motor cortex, fornix, cau-
date nucleus) as well as sulci, vascular structures, and the 
ependymal surface of the ventricles, should be avoided to 
decrease complications from collateral damage. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The degree of DBS implantation accuracy for optimal thera-
peutic outcome remains poorly deﬁ ned. However, we be-
lieve that the difference between the planned and actual 
electrode position should not exceed 1–2 mm. This is ex-
tremely difﬁ cult to achieve because the spatial error rates of 
frame based and frameless systems are on the order of 1–4 
mm. To enhance the accuracy of the procedure, we prefer 
the use of a frame-based system complemented by intraop-
erative radiographs to localize explicitly the position of the 
instrumentation in space. 
 After the setup of a reference system for target localiza-
tion, the patient undergoes MRI or CT, or both (CT when 
fusion techniques are used) and the target and AC-PC line 
are delineated  ( Fig. 23.1 ) . The patient is then brought to 
the operating room and placed in some form of head ﬁ xa-

tion for frame-based systems or coregistered with an optical 
tracking system for frameless navigation. For most of the 
commonly used targets, the initial target coordinates can be 
deﬁ ned with respect to the AC-PC plane  ( Table 23.1 ) . These 
coordinates should deliver the mapping electrode into the 
presumed physiological target. From that point on, electro-
physiological deﬁ nition of the target via microelectrode re-
cording or stimulation will better reﬁ ne the ultimate resting 
place for the electrode. 
      All patients should receive appropriate intravenous an-
tibiotics 30 minutes before incision time and at least one 
dose of steroid to minimize posttraumatic brain swelling 
and inﬂ ammation caused by tissue debris and released blood 
products. The patient should be lightly sedated during ac-
cess to the intracranial space. Although many centers prefer 
propofol, we believe that it changes the physiological re-
sponses and should be avoided. Our preference has been to 
use short-acting narcotics (such as remifentanyl) to achieve 
adequate sedation and analgesia. Overall, the choice of an-
esthetic agents should be based on the experience of the 
center and considerations of medication effects on the pa-
tient’s level of conscienceness, mentation, and local physi-

added 1–3 mm to the lateral parametric for third ventricular widths greater than 11–12 mm). Additional adjustments may be necessary to 
accommodate radiographic evidence of local atrophy.

ology. Brief acting agents such as remifentanyl can be used 
effectively during the initial stages of access to the intracra-
nial space and then stopped with sufﬁ cient time before the 
physiological mapping and subsequent electrode testing to 
avoid confounding effects. We recommend an interval of 
3–5 half-lives for a given agent. 
 Bur holes are placed approximately 3 cm from the midline 
and 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture. The exact location 
of the bur hole should be deﬁ ned explicitly with a presurgi-
cal trajectory. Draping systems should allow for interaction 
with the patient and yet maintain a sterile ﬁ eld. An incision 
is made after widely inﬁ ltrating the skin with a 50% mixture 
of 1% Lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine. Before making the 
incision, we mark the calvarium percutaneously by partial 
penetration with a small twist drill guided by the stereotac-
tic system to deﬁ ne the entry point and maintain the speci-
ﬁ ed trajectory to the ﬁ nal target. The incision is then opened 
and rainy clips applied to the edges to minimize bleeding. 
A standard 15 mm bur hole is centered on the twist drill 
marker hole. To minimize cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) leakage, 
the dura and underlying arachnoid are rapidly opened and 
ﬁ brin glue applied to obliterate the hole. This is important 
to prevent CSF loss and entrance of air, which can jointly 
distort intracranial structures because of brain shift and 
postoperative pneumocephalus. We believe that opening 
the dura and arachnoid minimizes mechanical distortions of 
instrumentation tracts and minimizes hemorrhage risk. 
 Once the target has been satisfactorily identiﬁ ed physi-
ologically, the treatment electrode should be introduced 
with great care to ensure that it reaches the desired target 
locus. Current DBS electrodes are too ﬂ accid to be inserted 
accurately toward the target without mechanical guidance. 
Several commercially available guide cannulas are available. 
Once advanced beyond the guide cannula, the electrode 
should then be functionally tested using macrostimulation 
to assess location (obtain stimulation-induced paresthesias) 
and adverse effects. If both criteria are met, the electrode 
may be anchored using a variety of available systems, in-
cluding locking caps (Image Guided Neurologics, Jupiter, 
FL) or Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN, USA), miniplates, or 
methylmetacrylate. The electrode should be externalized 
with a temporary disposable lead to assess stimulation anal-
gesia before a pulse generator is implanted. Internalization 
of a clinically ineffective, untested system is expensive and 
almost always prohibits the patient from obtaining routine 
MRI. Externalization of temporary leads should be oriented 
diametrically away form the proposed location of the im-
plantable pulse generator. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 We use prophylactic antibiotics for the entire duration of 
the percutaneous trial, which is limited to no more than 7 
days. This strategy has limited the infection rate to less than 
1%. Trial stimulation protocols should consist of high- and 
low-frequency stimulation. We routinely perform the trial 
using 135–180 Hz for high-frequency stimulation, then 50–
70 Hz for low-frequency stimulation. Pulse widths of 60–90 
microseconds are employed. In general, higher frequency 
stimulation is more efﬁ cacious in sensory thalamus and the 
lower frequencies may work better in PVG/PAG targets. 
 Once efﬁ cacy has been demonstrated, the patient is re-
turned to the OR and the pulse generator is implanted. We 
prefer to place the generator in the infraclavicular region, 
anchoring it to the underlying pectoralis fascia. A pocket 
is made in the cephalad direction with respect to the skin 
incision. We avoid axillary implants because they are more 
prone to infections. The length of the extension cable used 
should be chosen to avoid mechanical traction on the con-
struct. The electrode to extension cable junction is placed 
in the parietal boss, where the complex can be anchored to 
the underlying fascia with a nonabsorbable suture to avoid 
undue mechanical strain on the DBS electrode.

 Thoracoscopic Sympathectomy 
 Brian Perri , Tooraj Gravori , and J. Patrick  Johnson 
 
  Hyperhidrosis is a condition of sweating in excess of that 
required for normal thermoregulation. The onset of symp-
toms is usually during childhood or adolescence. Although 
any body part can be affected, the sites most commonly 
affected are the palms  ( Fig. 24.1 ) , axillae, and soles of the 
feet. Hyperhidrosis causes lifelong social (and in some cases 
disabling) functional morbidities. The second (T2) and third 
(T3) thoracic ganglia are typically felt to be responsible for 
palmar hyperhidrosis; the fourth (T4) thoracic ganglia pri-
marily controls axillary hyperhidrosis. Upper thoracic sym-
pathectomy with ganglionectomies at T2, T3, and T4 levels 
has been performed by multiple centers to treat these con-
ditions. In the past, however, the approaches to the high 
thoracic sympathetic chain were highly invasive and were 
performed by posterior paraspinal, supraclavicular, or an 
open thoracotomy. The introduction of minimally invasive 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has enabled 
surgeons to obtain detailed and magniﬁ ed visualization of 
the sympathetic ganglia through percutaneous portals, and 
thus eliminates the need for an open thoracotomy. The tech-
nical aspects of the two-port thoracoscopic sympathectomy 
using 2 mm instruments will be described. We have changed 
from routinely doing T2–4 ganglionectomy and sympathec-
tomy on all patients as a result of current research. We now 
perform T3 ganglionectomies by dividing and removing the 
sympathetic chain above and below the T3 ganglion, for pa-
tients with symptoms of only palmar hyperhidrosis. We add 
the T4 ganglionectomy for patients who experience symp-
toms of palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. 
 Patient Selection 
 It is important to reserve surgical intervention of idiopathic 
hyperhidrosis for patients who are recalcitrant to nonopera-
tive interventions. Additionally, a preoperative comprehen-
sive workup is necessary to rule out secondary hyperhidro-
sis that may be treated medically. Among the many causes 
of secondary hyperhidrosis are paraneoplastic neurologic 
syndrome, thyroxicosis, diabetes mellitus, gout, menopause, 
pheochromocytoma, medications such as tricyclic antide-
pressants and propranolol, chronic alcoholism, and spinal 
cord injury. Nocturnal hyperhidrosis is speciﬁ cally associ-
ated with tuberculosis and Hodgkin disease. 
 In the absence of secondary causes of hyperhidrosis, pri-
mary hyperhidrosis has traditionally been treated medically

ﬁ rst. Systemic anticholinergic drugs have variable sympto-
matic treatment. However, they have common undesirable 
side effects. Topical anticholenergics such as Drysol (chlo-
ride hexahydrate) can be used to avoid the adverse effects of 
systemic anticholenergics, but can cause regional irritation 
that requires further skin care. Another innovative treat-
ment is direct application of current (15–20 mA) over the 
palmar skin daily for 30 minutes. More recently, injection 
of Botulinum toxin (Botox) directly into the palmar subepi-
dermal tissue has been tried. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 A complete laboratory workup that includes thyroid func-
tion panel, serum glucose levels, uric acid, and urine cat-
echolamine level should be performed in addition to routine 
imaging with at least a chest radiograph. The techniques 
described assume that bilateral endoscopic sympathecto-
mies are being performed on a patient with symptoms of 
bilateral hyperhidrosis. These techniques may also be used 
to perform a unilateral procedure. However, patients with 
unilateral symptoms must be thoroughly evaluated preop-
eratively for possible causes of secondary hyperhidrosis. 
 Operative Procedure 
 We prefer the double-lumen endotracheal intubation used 
for single lung ventilation. With this technique the ipsilat-
eral lung can be deﬂ ated so it does not obstruct the operative 
ﬁ eld. Before proceeding with the surgery on the contralat-
eral lung, the anesthesiologist should verify that the previ-
ously operative side lung is providing adequate ventilation. 
There have been reported cases of unrecognized hypoxia 
that led to death or severe cerebral ischemic injury. We rou-
tinely attempt to minimize incidence or at least the size of 
a postoperative pneumothorax by placing the suction/ir-
rigator instrument at the apex of the thoracic cavity and 
endoscopically visualize lung reinﬂ ation ( Fig. 24.2 ) . When 
the lung is nearly reexpanded, the endoscope and Endopath 
needle  port are withdrawn from the thoracic cavity. Next, 
the suction/irrigator is switched to the suction mode then 
completely withdrawn to evacuate any remaining air from 
the thoracic cavity. This port is then quickly sealed. 
 Palmar cutaneous temperature transducers can be used 
bilaterally to monitor for at least a 1°C temperature increase, 
which has been suggested to predict  adequate sympathec-
tomy and corresponding successful clinical outcomes. An 
alternative intraoperative method to monitor for successful 
sympathectomy is by laser Doppler ﬂ owmetry or arteriole 
Doppler of the hands. Blood ﬂ ow to the hands increases 
after successful sympathectomies and palmar temperature 
increases secondary to this. This increased ﬂ ow has been 
measured at an average of 48 ± 7 perfusion units preopera-
tively increasing to 121 ±17 perfusion units following sym-
pathectomy, and is measurable as early as 22 minutes after 
sympathectomy versus 34 minutes for the average meas-
urable palmar skin temperature increase. Caution must be 
used, however, because the initial cautery to the parietal 
pleura for exposure to the sympathetic chain may result in 
increased palmar blood ﬂ ow and thus inaccurately predict 
success of surgery. 
 The lateral decubitus position has typically been described 
for the VATS endoscopic sympathectomy. This positioning, 
however, requires that the patient be repositioned for sur-
gery of the contralateral side for bilateral sympathectomies, 
adding signiﬁ cant operative time. Our preference for patient 
positioning is supine (Inderbitzi’s position) with the pa-
tient’s arms abducted to 90 degrees and the operative table 
tilted in about 30 degrees of reverse Trendelenberg  ( Figs. 
24.3 and 24.4 ) . Reverse Trendelenberg allows the deﬂ ated 
ipsilateral lung to fall away from the upper thoracic cavity, 
and aids in surgical exposure by revealing the sympathetic 
chain. This positioning provides sufﬁ cient bilateral, surgical 
access when using ports via the third intercostal space along 
the midaxillary line. 
 It is possible to perform the thoracic sympathectomy for 
hyperhidrosis via a single port technique. This requires that 
the port be precisely placed along the midaxillary line be-
tween the third and fourth ribs. A 10 mm Flexi-path port 
(Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) is inserted 
with a blunt introducer through a 1.5 to 2 cm incision. The 
port can be secured to the skin with a staple gun. Care should 
be taken when introducing the thoracic ports to avoid the 
neurovascular bundle, which courses directly below the rib. 
Preemptive analgesia for the skin incision and an intercostal 
block are recommended to reduce the incidence of intercos-
tal neuralgia, one of the commonest complications of tho-
racoscopic sympathectomy. Additionally, a soft Flexi-path

visible in upper right of image. After the lung is visualized to be com-
pletely inﬂ ated, the suction/irrigator is switched to suction mode and

thoracic cavity to minimize the potential for a pneumothorax.

port and small diameter instruments; primarily a 5-mm 
endoscope and a 5-mm mini-Metzenbaum scissors with 
a monopolar electrocautery attachment help to decrease 
traumatic compression to the neurovascular bundle. Both 
instruments can be manipulated through a single port even 
though they rub against each other at the portal site. Use of 
two instruments through a single port can in fact be difﬁ cult 
because they tend to interfere with one another or expe-
rience friction against the plastic port. To correct for this 
problem, it is generally helpful to maneuver both instru-
ments (endoscope and working instrument) together slowly 
so that they are parallel and move together. The working 
instrument can be advanced and retracted, in a pistoning 
motion, beyond the endoscope. The instruments will tend 
to work in unison with this technique. Mineral oil can also 
be used to reduce friction of the instruments between each 
other and between the instruments and the port. 
 A second port can be placed if surgical access to the sym-
pathetic ganglion is too difﬁ cult. The optimal site for this 
second port placement is best determined by viewing the 
thoracic cavity exposure through the endoscope. The likely 
positions will be ventrally (anterior axillary line), dorsally 
(posterior axillary line), or caudally in the midaxillary line 
of the fourth intercostal space (between the fourth and ﬁ fth 
ribs). Care must be exercised when using a more cranial port 
than the third intercostal space because this places the sub-
clavian artery or brachiocephalic vein at risk for injury. The 
second port should always be placed under direct observa-
tion within the thoracic cavity using the endoscope. 
 The 0 degree endoscope usually provides sufﬁ cient visu-
alization for sympathectomies using a single or double port 
technique. A 30 degree scope offers increased circumfer-
ential visualization of the thoracic cavity. Additionally, the 
working instruments typically function best when work-
ing straight-on, whereas an angled scope can be positioned 
more tangential to the surgical ﬁ eld and is thus less likely 
to hinder the working instrument. 
 We have recently adopted and modiﬁ ed a less invasive 
thoracoscopic sympathectomy surgery. This technique uses 
disposable 3 mm Endopath access needles  ( Fig. 24.5 ) Model 
#AN3MM (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) 
for access ports to the thoracic cavity. A 2 mm 0 degree en-
doscope  ( Figs. 24.6 and 24.7 )  Model #26008AA (Karl Storz, 
Charlton, MA, USA) is placed through one Endopath needle 
and a 2 mm cautery shear is placed through the other. This is 
an attractive alternative to the larger ports and instruments 
typically used for thoracic sympathectomy surgery. We use 
the smaller endoscopic instruments and a two-port tech-
nique placed in the third intercostal space. The Endopath 
access needle is inserted posteriorly in the midaxillary line 
 ( Fig. 24.8 )  and the 2 mm 0 degree endoscope is ﬁ t neatly 
through this needle port. A 3.5 mm ﬂ exible port  ( Fig. 24.9 ) 
Model # 8903.072 (Richard Wolf, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) is 
placed 4 cm anterior to the Endopath needle port, in the 
anterior midaxillary line of the third intercostal space  ( Fig. 
24.10 ) . This port is not only ﬂ exible but shorter than the 
Varess needle port and ribbed to prevent it from backing 
out  ( Figs. 24.10 and 24.11 ) . A 3.5 mm combined electro-
cautery/scissor (Snowden Pencer, Inc., Tucker, GA, USA), a 2

Pencer, Inc., Tucker, GA) can be used through this working 
port. The potential advantages of using smaller instruments 
and a two-port technique are to decrease the incidence of 
postoperative intercostal neuralgia and to provide an im-
proved angle to approach the sympathetic chain. 
 The anesthesiologist needs to verify that the ipsilateral 
lung is deﬂ ated before the Endopath access needle port is 
introduced into the thoracic cavity. Once the endoscope is 
introduced through the needle port, the thoracic cavity, 
lung, and mediastinum are explored. Pleural adhesions to 
the lung parenchyma are sometimes found. These adhesions 
must ﬁ rst be cauterized, then divided to release the lung 
from the thoracic wall. The deﬂ ated lung is gently swept 
away from the upper thoracic spine if the sympathetic chain 
is not easily visualized by simply positioning the patient in 
reverse Trendelenberg. The lung can also be swept caudally 
if necessary. 
 There are some notable differences in the anatomy of the 
right and left thoracic cavities. On the right, the subclavian 
artery and vein are typically identiﬁ able but embedded 
within fat of the thoracic outlet at the chest apex. If visible, 
the ﬁ rst rib has a much higher take-off and smaller radius of 
curvature than the adjacent caudal ribs. The rib heads, be-
ginning with the second rib, are readily identiﬁ able through

the parietal pleura and are important landmarks during the 
thoracoscopic sympathectomy surgery  ( Fig. 24.11 ) . Addi-
tional landmarks to determine the T2, T3 and T4 ganglion 
of the sympathetic chain include the azygos vessels  ( Fig. 
24.12 ) . The azygos vein and azygos arch drain several large 
intercostal veins, which are easily seen in the right thorax. 
The highest intercostal vein is formed by the union of the 
second, third, and fourth intercostal veins. The continuation 
of the highest intercostal vein empties into the arch of the 
azygos. The ﬁ rst intercostal vein typically drains directly 
into the brachiocephalic vein. The union of the azygos arch 
and the brachiocephalic vein forms the superior vena cava 
in the right thorax. 
 In the apex of the left thorax, the aorta and brachiocephalic 
vessels lie next to one another  ( Figs. 24.13 and 24.14 ) . Each 
has a corresponding subclavian artery and vein that course 
parallel to each other and cross over the ﬁ rst rib head. This 
ﬁ rst rib head is thus not directly visible thoracoscopically. 
The second rib is usually the highest easily visible rib head 
articulating with the spine  ( Fig. 24.15 ) . The second, third, 
and fourth rib heads are easily visible and are key landmarks 
during the sympathectomy surgery. The stellate ganglion 
lies within the ﬁ rst intercostal space between the covered 
ﬁ rst rib head and the exposed second rib head. The high-
est intercostal vein is a continuation of the ﬁ rst segmental 
vein, which often courses directly over the stellate ganglion 
and superﬁ cial to the subclavian artery to empty into the 
brachiocephalic vein. 
 The sympathetic chain is a slightly raised, longitudinal 
structure running parallel to the spine and coursing over 
the rib heads just deep to the semitransparent parietal 
pleura. The parietal pleura from the third to fourth rib head 
is divided. Each sympathetic ganglion is located over or just 
beneath the corresponding numbered rib. The ganglion is 
distinguished from the sympathetic chain as a swelling of 
the chain. Repeated palpation or manipulation of the sym-
pathetic ganglion should be minimized because this may 
induce swelling, irritation, or hyperemia and induce bleed-
ing. Next, the exposed sympathetic chain and associated 
(T2) T3-T4 ganglion are isolated, cauterized, then excised 
and completely removed from the thoracic cavity. Hemo-
stasis is achieved when necessary using bipolar cautery  ( Fig. 
24.16 ) . 
 The best ganglion for resection in the treatment of palmar 
hyperhidrosis is still debatable. Compensatory hyperhidro-
sis has been reported to be as high as 95% in patients after 
Fig. 24.12 In the right upper thorax, the sympathetic chain can again be seen coursing over the rib heads adjacent to and parallel with the azygos 
vein. The patient is positioned supine in these photos. The rib heads articulate with the vertebrae as illustrated in the diagram Fig. 11.

sympathetic ganglion resection. Fortunately, these symp-
toms typically resolve by 6 months. Resecting any combi-
nation of the T2, T3, or T4 ganglion appears to be equally 
effective in providing greater than 98% symptomatic im-
provement in palmar hyperhidrosis. There also appears to 
be less severe compensatory truncal hyperhidrosis when re-
secting T3 versus T2 ganglion and infrequent compensatory 
hyperhidrosis when resecting T4 ganglion compared with 
the T2 ganglion resection. Inhibition of palmar and axillary 
hyperhidrosis is typically an added beneﬁ t resulting from 
the T4 ganglion resection. The accessory nerve of Kuntz is 
a ramus communicantes of T2, but can arise from T3 or T4. 
This accessory nerve (more than one may be present) can be 
identiﬁ ed before the parietal pleura is incised, as it courses 
parallel the sympathetic chain. This nerve branch may con-
tinue to carry neural signals past the transected segment of 
the sympathetic nerve trunk and should be transected when 
identiﬁ ed to increase the success of decreasing palmar 
hyperhidrosis. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 In spite of the beneﬁ ts offered by thoracoscopic sympathec-
tomy, the potential complications are real. The physiologic 
response of the body following sympathectomy can cause 
compensatory sweating in areas previously unaffected and 
gustatory sweating. In a series of 850 patients who under-
went this procedure, 55% experienced new trunk sweating 
and 36% reported new gustatory sweating. In another study, 
up to 99% of treated patients (72 total patients) experienced 
compensatory sweating (17% gustatory) within 1 month of 
surgery. The technical complications associated with the en-
doscopic approach and performance of the sympathectomy 
carry further risks that include pneumothorax, intercostal 
neuralgia, damage to the great vessels, and the sequelae of 
general anesthetic use, as well as Horner syndrome associ-
ated with T1 ganglion injury and recalcitrant hyperhidrosis. 
 Careful insertion of the port over the superior border of 
the rib reduces the risk of intercostal neurovascular injury 
and postoperative intercostal neuralgia. The port should 
be initially placed using a blunt tip instrument and only 
after the ipsilateral lung has been deﬂ ated to avoid injury 
to the lung parenchyma. The second port, and any subse-
quent ports, should be placed under direct visualization if 
possible. 
 Clear visualization and identiﬁ cation of the T2 ganglion 
helps identify the stellate ganglion, located just cephalad 
to the second rib and usually covered by a small fat pad. 
Avoiding manipulation of this fat pad and therefore poten-
tial injury to the stellate ganglion lessens the risk of Horner 
syndrome. Furthermore, avoiding this fat pad minimizes 
the risk of injury to the subclavian artery, which lies just 
beneath it. 
 Conclusions 
 Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is an effective and safe de-
ﬁ nitive treatment for primary palmar hyperhidrosis. The 
recent advances in technology have enabled this procedure 
to be performed using endoscopes and endoscopic working 
instruments as small as 2 mm in diameter. This has reduced 
the incidence of intercostal neuralgia and decreased scar-
ring. Supine patient positioning with arms abducted to 90 
degrees and slight reverse Trendelenberg has enabled us to 
perform bilateral sympathectomy procedures without hav-
ing to reposition the patient while under anesthesia. Awake 
thoracoscopic sympathectomies using local anesthetic and 
intravenous sedation versus general anesthesia may be a 
viable option in select patients in the near future.

 Physiologically Guided Transthoracic 
Endoscopic Sympathectomy 
    Ricardo   Segal    , Nahum   Beglaibter    , Peter M.   Ferson    , and Edwin   Nemoto  
  Thoracic sympathectomy includes excision, the creation of 
chemical, thermal, electrical, and laser lesions, and complete 
or partial ganglia disconnection. An exhaustive historical re-
view of cervicothoracic sympathectomy has been made by 
Drott . Chronologically, these procedures include open gan-
glionectomy, thoracoscopic ganglionectomy, dorsal open 
ganglionotomy, thoracoscopic monopolar sympathetic chain 
electrocoagulation, percutaneous radio frequency ganglion le-
sions, video-assisted thoracoscopic laser ganglion vaporization, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic ganglionectomy, and selective 
thoracoscopic division of the rami communicantes. An excel-
lent description of the thoracic endoscopic sympathectomy 
technique was provided by Kux in 1978 . However, it is only 
with the advent of video-assisted techniques in the 1990s that 
transthoracic sympathectomy could really be exploited. His-
torically, surgeons have disputed whether Tl, T2, and T3 must 
be excised or disconnected. Fortunately, since the 1960s, it has 
been demonstrated that resecting the Tl-stellate ganglion is 
unnecessary; this avoids Horner syndrome. However, not every 
experience indicates that it is enough to resect T2; most still 
include T3 as well. 
 Even when using open approaches and microsurgical 
techniques, reliance solely on anatomical landmarks does 
not eliminate a risk of Horner syndrome. This is due to mis-
identiﬁ cation of either the T2 and Tl ganglia or not achieving 
good resolution of symptoms because the upper trunk above 
the T2 ganglia has been mistaken for the thick rami commu-
nicantes. The anatomy of this section of the sympathetic 
system varies greatly. Intraoperative X-rays have shown 
clips appearing caudal to their real position, as conﬁ rmed 
by open approaches. Therefore, appropriate physiological 
responses to stimulation are needed to conﬁ rm anatomical 
localization. Lindquist provided an excellent description of 
the determination of blood ﬂ ow in response to electrical 
stimulation of the high thoracic sympathetic chain before its 
resection using an open (midline posterior) approach. Kao 
reported monitoring of palmar skin perfusion (laser Dop-
pler ﬂ owmeter) and temperature (telethermometer) during 
endoscopic laser ablation of T2 and T3 ganglia, but did not 
use electrical stimulation. To combine the best features of 
the foregoing procedures, we undertook the development of 
a technique of video-assisted transthoracic endoscopic elec-
trical sympathetic tract stimulation, with continuous moni-
toring of physiological responses, to identify the ganglia, 
tract, and rami communicantes to be resected. A detailed 
description of this surgical technique follows. 
 Patient Selection 
 Interruption of the upper thoracic sympathetic innervation 
of the upper extremities is a proven surgical procedure for 
relief of essential palmar hyperhidrosis. Long-lasting relief 
occurs in more than 90% of cases. Satisfactory pain relief is 
also provided in more than 50% of patients with complex 
regional pain syndromes (reﬂ ex sympathetic dystrophy and 
causalgia). Recently, it has been shown that  this procedure 
may also relieve facial hyperhidrosis and may provide pain 
relief in sympathetically mediated facial pain. Its usefulness 
in vasospastic (Raynaud disease) and occlusive vascular dis-
ease is still disputed. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Evaluation 
 All patients should undergo anterior-posterior and lateral 
X-ray ﬁ lms to rule out thoracic deformity or congenital 
anomaly and lung or mediastinal disease. Attention should 
be directed to the apical pleura. Pleural scarring is a relative 
contraindication to using the thoracoscopic approach. Thin 
adhesions from pulmonary inﬂ ammation may be readily 
mobilized via the video-assisted method. Dense, thickened 
apical scarring, such as from prior granulomatous disease, 
will render this technique unsafe. The patient’s pulmonary 
status is signiﬁ cant in those who suffer from severe, limiting 
respiratory abnormalities. 
 Anesthesia 
 The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. A 
single-lumen endotracheal tube is used and both lungs 
are ventilated during the whole procedure. The ipsilateral 
upper segments are partially collapsed by insufﬂ ating the 
pleural cavity via one of the trocars with carbon dioxide 
(CO 2 ) to a pressure of 5–7 mm Hg, and by ventilating with 
small volumes. This technique gives good exposure of the 
space between T2 and T4, saves the need of a double lumen 

152 II 
Pain
endotracheal tube, saves time of intubation, and because 
the collapse of the lung is very limited, allows the procedure 
to be performed safely, even when total collapse of the lung 
would be regarded unwanted. 
 In an otherwise healthy patient an arterial line is not nec-
essary because noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure is 
sufﬁ cient. A pulse oximeter provides adequate evaluation 
of ventilation. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Patient Positioning 
 The patient is placed in the supine position with both arms 
ﬂ exed 100 degrees and elbows ﬂ exed and internally rotated 
90 degrees. The forearms are loosely stripped to a bar at the 
level of the patient’s chin  ( Fig. 25.1 ) . Care must be taken not 
to overﬂ ex the arms to prevent any damage to the brachial 
plexus. This position exposes widely the two axillae. The 
patient should be positioned slightly ﬂ exed at the hip. Sand-
bags and lumbar rests are placed and the pelvis is secured 
with broad tape or a belt to both sides of the table to allow 
safe lateral rotation of the operating table. The area of the 
axilla and lateral chest on both sides is prepped and draped, 
allowing for the conversion to a thoracotomy through the 
third intercostal space should the need arise. The patient’s 
hands and eyes remain exposed for physiological monitor-
ing. This method of patient’s positioning allows the team 
to work on both sides consecutively in one sitting without 
repositioning and saves considerable operating room time. 
 Surgical Technique 
 Video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy is designed to pro-
vide all the advantages of an open procedure (anatomical 
identiﬁ cation, microneurosurgical technique, and neuro-
physiological conﬁ rmation) and minimize its invasiveness 
by using state-of-the-art video-assisted transthoracic en-
doscopy. To reach this goal, we cannot resort to the absolute 
minimum of invasiveness. Although others have performed 
endoscopic thoracic sympathetic ablation with a single port 
and laser or electrocautery, we recommend a thoracic sur-
geon, a neurosurgeon, and an assistant working through 
three ports. This allows microsurgical identiﬁ cation, physi-
ological conﬁ rmation, and in toto resection. The cosmetic 
disadvantage of three stab wounds instead of one is negli-
gible, especially if care is taken using subcuticular closure. 
The patient is discharged home in the framework of 23-hour 
observation, which does not count as a 1-day admission. The 
instrumentation required is readily available in any operat-
ing room ﬁ tted for transthoracic endoscopic procedures and 
consists of three reusable ports with associated trocars for 
introduction (one 10 or 5 mm for the scope and two 5 mm 
in diameter as working ports (Showden Pencer, Inc., Tucker, 
GA, USA), a 10 mm operating thoracoscope Model 26039

with the nonisolated proximal post of the coagulating for-
ceps. An 18-gauge hypodermic needle inserted in the soft 
tissue through one of the port stab wounds is used as a 
grounding electrode. The forceps are then used for stimula-
tion of the sympathetic tract, as shown in   Figure 25.1 (in-
set). Details of the stimulation parameters and recording of 
responses are described under Physiological Monitoring. 
 A single dose of prophylactic antibiotic (1 g cefazolin) is 
administered intravenously, or 500 mg vancomycin hydro-
chloride (if allergic to penicillin) is administered intraop-
eratively. 
 The table is laterally rotated to 30 degrees (operated side 
up) and put in a moderate reverse Trendelenberg position. 
The ﬁ rst port (5 or 10 mm) for the scope is inserted in the 
mid axillary line 2 cm below the axillary hair line, which 
corresponds roughly to the third or fourth intercostal space. 
This port is introduced carefully to avoid injury to the un-
derlying lung, which does not collapse until air has entered 
the pleural space. Two additional 5 mm working ports are 
inserted under direct vision at the axillary hair line. The 
chest is observed from inside to eliminate the risk of injur-
ing the intercostal neurovascular bundle in the anterior and 
posterior axillary line  ( Fig. 25.1 ) . This very high placement 
of the trocars minimizes the cosmetic defects caused by the 
incisions. Three access sites are usually sufﬁ cient for an up-
per thoracic sympathectomy  ( Fig. 25.1 ) . 
 After the ﬁ rst trocar is inserted, the pleural cavity is in-
sufﬂ ated with CO 2  to a pressure of 5–7 mm Hg. The lung 
partially collapses and the area between the dome and T3–4 
is exposed. Placing the patient in reverse Trendelenberg po-
sition with anterior rotation will usually result in the lung 
falling out of the ﬁ eld of view. If this does not occur, a fourth 
access site is created, usually slightly anterior and caudal to 
the viewing port, to insert an endoscopic fan lung retractor. 
 If ports of minimal size are desired, the working instru-
ments and the viewing lens can be inserted through 5 mm 
access sites. We typically use the 10 mm operating thora-
coscope for video-assisted thoracic procedures. When a 
smaller incision is desired, we use a 5 mm 30 degree scope 
 ( Fig. 25.2 ). 
 The sympathetic chain is easily identiﬁ ed beneath the 
translucent pleuron just lateral to the rib heads  ( Fig. 25.4A ) . 
In patients with average build, the ﬁ rst rib and the stellate 
ganglion may be readily visible. A blunt probe is used to 
identify the ﬁ rst rib by palpation at the thoracic inlet. The 
subsequent second, third, and fourth ribs can be seen and 
palpated very easily and are counted from the ﬁ rst rib. A 
grasper and endoscopic scissors are used to sharply incise 
the pleuron directly over the sympathetic chain from the 
top of the T2 rib to the bottom of the T4 rib  ( Fig. 25.4B ) . The 
scissors and the dissecting angle clamp are used to reﬂ ect 
the pleuron and encircle the sympathetic chain. The location 
of the ganglia and the rami communicantes along the sym-
pathetic chain is variable longitudinally; these structures 
must be carefully identiﬁ ed and dissected. Small intercostal 
veins may course over the sympathetic chain, larger on the 
right side draining into the azygos vein, and usually one 
small artery is present beneath the third rib. Identifying and 
controlling these structures avoids troublesome bleeding. 
 Once the sympathetic chain has been adequately exposed 
and the T2 and T3 sympathetic ganglions identiﬁ ed, the

level to be resected is conﬁ rmed with physiological testing, 
as described in the following section  ( Fig. 25.4C ). A hemo-
clip is then placed directly rostral to the upper limit of the 
T2 ganglion  ( Fig. 25.4D ) . The chain is transected below the 
clip, using scissors and not cautery to avoid damage to T1 
resulting in Horner syndrome, and resection is performed 
up to the caudal limit by transecting the rami communi-
cantes. The sympathetic chain is again clipped caudal to 
the T3 ganglion and the specimen is resected. Although the 
specimen is about 30  6  3 mm, it may be removed in 
toto through the 5 mm port without difﬁ culty. In our opin-
ion, with the combination of video-assisted visualization 
and the monitoring of physiological responses to electrical 
stimulation, there is no need for intraoperative conﬁ rma-
tion by frozen section that ganglia have been removed. We 
submit the specimen for permanent sectioning only. 
 Once hemostasis is obtained, the insufﬂ ation is stopped, 
one of the trocars is left open as a vent and the lung is fully 
reexpanded by the anesthetist under direct vision. We do 
not routinely use any chest drains. The trocar incisions are 
closed using subdermal absorbable stitches and glue. The 
patient is extubated when the procedure is complete. 
 Physiological Monitoring 
 Blood ﬂ ow to the patient’s ﬁ ngers is assessed by means of a 
photoplethysmograph attached to the ipsilateral thumb on 
its volar aspect. A Parks Model 1052 battery-operated photo-
plethysmographic transducer  (Parks Medical Electronics, Inc., 
Aloha, OR) is attached with two-sided transparent adhesive 
tape. This device produces an analog wave as a function of the 
pulsatile blood volume in the subcutaneous tissue. 
 Changes in wave amplitude are proportional to the relative 
actual pulse volume and thus are indicative of the overall 
skin blood ﬂ ow. To monitor antebrachial perfusion, antebra-
chial oxygenation (rSO) on the volar aspect of the forearm 
is monitored using the INVOS3100A cerebral oximeter (So-
manetics Corp., Troy, MI, USA). The cerebral oximeter uses 
near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to monitor tissue oxygena-
tion via NIR light reﬂ ected from the subcutaneous tissue, in 
this case the antebrachial muscles. The sensitive volume of 
the measurement is estimated to be an average half-sphere 
from the skin’s surface penetrating 2.5 cm deep into the 
muscle over an elliptical area 4 cm on the major axis. The

brachial muscle perfusion; subsequent clipping between T3 
and T4 resulted in a less dramatic increase in digital blood 
ﬂ ow and antebrachial muscle perfusion  ( Figs. 25.5 and 
25.6 ) . The changes in the digits and hand temperature are 
also dramatic, with an increase of as much as 10°C. 
 The importance of checking for pupillary size was shown 
when electrical stimulation of a ganglia-like enlargement of 
the sympathetic chain at the level of the T2 rib resulted in 
a twofold pupillary dilatation with only minimal ﬂ ow and 
temperature variations. We repeated the stimulation more 
caudally and found that the T2 ganglia were located more 
caudally, anterior to the upper aspect of the T3 rib head. 
Thus the use of physiological response to stimulation may 
have avoided Horner syndrome in that patient. 
light-emitting diode and two NIR receivers, is applied to the 
volar aspect of the forearm. 
 The cerebral oximeter is set to a trending rate of 2 per mm 
and a storage rate of 6 per min. Skin temperature is second-
arily dependent on blood ﬂ ow and on sweat evaporation. 
Both increased ﬂ ow and reduction of sweating will increase 
temperature. Temperature is measured using surface ther-
mistors Model 47 (Yellow Springs Instrumentation ). These 
are taped to the middle digit and dorsum of both hands 
and to the contralateral forearm. Blood pressure and heart 
rate are recorded to evaluate cardiovascular responses to 
stimulation. The anesthesiologist is requested to observe 
the pupillary size just before and during each stimulation. 
Extreme care must to be taken to not damage the cornea 
when elevating the upper eyelid to examine pupillary size. 
 Electrical stimulation parameters are trains of square 
wave, 500 millisecondsec duration, administered for a 
period of 1 minute, in increments of 1 V, with 3 minutes 
between to allow for recovery and return to the baseline. 
Initially, we obtained a voltage response curve and estab-
lished that 7 V to stimulation of T2 and T3 ganglia produced 
very signiﬁ cant reductions in digital blood ﬂ ow (40–60%) 
and antebrachial muscle perfusion unaccompanied by pu-
pillary changes  ( Fig. 25.5 ) . While stimulating at Tl, there 
was a onefold increase in pupillary diameter with only a 
10% reduction in digital blood ﬂ ow and antebrachial muscle 
perfusion. Since then, we have considerably reduced the 
length of the procedure by using only the 7 V current at 
each level  ( Fig. 25.6 ) . We have found transient increases 
of up to 33% in systolic blood pressure and heart rate more 
frequently with electrical stimulation of the left sympa-
thetic ganglia. 
 We also found that pressing or rubbing the T3 and T2 
sympathetic ganglia and manipulation during the dissection 
induce decrements in digital blood ﬂ ow and antebrachial 
muscle perfusion equivalent to those induced by electrical 
stimulation. Clipping between Tl and T2 resulted in a sig-
niﬁ cant, immediate increase in digital blood ﬂ ow and ante-

 The patient is brieﬂ y observed in the recovery room and 
transferred to the regular ﬂ oor. The patient is discharged 
home following 23 hours of observation after chest X-rays 
are obtained, and does not need an early follow-up visit 
because the trocar incisions have been closed with subcu-
ticular stitches. 
 Histological Conﬁ rmation

 Conclusions 
 Video-assisted transthoracic endoscopy provides a mini-
mally invasive, state-of-the-art technique by which to per-
form sympathectomy. Unilateral or bilateral procedures 
can be performed, requiring only a 23-hour postoperative 
observation period. In our view, an experienced endoscopic 
thoracic surgeon and neurosurgeon team guarantee safety. 
We demonstrated that physiological sympathetic ganglia 
identiﬁ cation can be achieved when performing video-as-
sisted transthoracic endoscopy. This requires only adapta-
tion of instruments commonly used in endoscopic surgery 
and adds only negligible time to the procedure. Using this 
technique, we have conﬁ rmed discrepancies between ana-
tomical and physiological identiﬁ cation. We believe that this 
is required to prevent morbidities such as Horner syndrome 
and to guarantee successful denervation. The minimal inva-
siveness afforded by transthoracic endoscopic sympathec-
tomy will encourage its frequent use for benign but inca-
pacitating entities such as palmar or facial hyperhidrosis 
and complex regional pain syndromes.

 Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections 
 Atichat Busracamwongs and Masami Hattori 
 
 Patient Selection 
 Patients with pain from lumbosacral nerve root irritation 
and inﬂ ammation are often referred for lumbar epidural 
steroid injections. In most cases, such patients have been 
treated conservatively for at least 4 weeks before the refer-
rals with failure or inadequate response. Conservative treat-
ments include bed rest, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and 
oral analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inﬂ ammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opiates. 
 Nerve root irritation and inﬂ ammation may be caused by 
compression from a disc herniation, neuroforaminal nar-
rowing, lateral recess narrowing, etc. Chemical irritation to 
nerve roots without mechanical compression is also a possi-
bility. In this case, leakage of phospholipase A2 enzyme into 
the epidural space from degenerative discs through tears of 
annulus ﬁ brosus irritates the nerve roots and causes radicu-
lar pain. 
 Low back pain can result from several causes such as facet 
arthropathy, inﬂ ammation of sacroiliac joints, degenerative 
disc disease without herniation, myofascial pain syndrome, 
irritation of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and verte-
bral compression fracture. These may result in referred pain 
to the lower extremities that mimics radicular pain. There-
fore, precise diagnosis is a key to positive outcome. 
 Patients with spinal stenosis causing neurogenic claudica-
tion are often referred for epidural steroid injections. This 
group of patients may obtain signiﬁ cant pain relief, which 
is usually temporary. 
 Predictors of outcome include accurate diagnosis, dura-
tion of pain, needle placement, and the patients’ employ-
ment and litigation status. Success rate is higher for low 
back pain with radiculopathy than without. Patients whose 
pain lasts less than 6 months are desirable candidates. The 
longer the symptoms linger, the lower the success rate. 
 Epidural steroid injections should also be considered in 
acute radicular symptoms superimposed on chronic low 
back pain. Ideally, needle placement close to or at the level 
of pathology is generally preferable because this allows the 
optimal amount of the injectate to directly contact the pa-
thology. Patients unemployed because of pain or who have 
pending lawsuits or litigation from work-related injury tend 
to have poor outcomes from the procedure. History of back 
surgery is considered another negative predictor for out-
come, possibly owing to scar tissue that develops in the 
epidural space after surgeries and interferes with the spread 
of steroid. The scar tissue can cause tension on nerve roots 
and results in radicular pain. 
 For most candidates, epidural steroid injections can 
shorten the duration of illness and reduce the intensity of 
the pain. This pain reduction allows earlier and more effec-
tive physical rehabilitation. Shorter recovery period, fewer 
medications, and an early return to work will make the epi-
dural steroid injection regimen more cost effective. 
 Contraindications to epidural steroid injections include 
coagulopathy, local infection, and sepsis. Patients that take 
antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and ticlopi-
dine should be clearly instructed to stop taking the agents 
for speciﬁ c lengths of time. These durations vary with the 
agents. If the patient takes one NSAID, we do not always 
require a temporary discontinuation unless the patient has 
other risks of bleeding tendency. Cautions should be exer-
cised in managing patients taking antiplatelet agents be-
cause certain patients are not allowed to stop taking these 
agents even for a short time. In this group of patients, such 
as those with drug-eluting coronary stents, discontinuing 
the agents may result in signiﬁ cant morbidity or mortality. 
Hypovolemia is a relative contraindication when a local an-
esthetic is administered along with steroid. In patients with 
history of allergy to contrast dye, an epidurogram should 
be avoided. A blind epidural should not be performed on 
patients who have intrathecal pumps, dorsal column stimu-
lators, or history of previous laminectomies or lumbar fu-
sions. In such cases, ﬂ uoroscopy should be used. 
 Lumbar epidural steroid injections can be done via in-
terlaminar and transforaminal routes. For patients with ra-
diculopathic symptoms and signs classic for distribution of a 
single nerve root that may be conﬁ rmed by imaging studies 
or nerve conduction studies, we prefer the transforaminal 
approach. Most of the pathology (such as disc herniations) 
that causes acute radicular symptoms takes place in the 
anterior epidural space. The injectate is deposited mainly 
in the anterior epidural space via transforaminal injection. 
In contrast, the interlaminar injections access the posterior 
epidural space where the injectate is primarily deposited. 
Moreover, because targets of transforaminal injections are 
more speciﬁ c, substantial reduction in the total dose and 
volume of injectate is allowed. It is widely believed that the 
transforaminal approach provides better results than the 
interlaminar technique. 

158 II 
Pain
 Steroids can promote inhibition of phospholipase A2 and 
interfere with the inﬂ ammatory cascade. Apart from the 
 antiinﬂ ammatory effect, steroids also have antinocicep-
tive and membrane-stabilizing effects that account for pain 
relief. In the interlaminar injections, we generally employ 
80 mg of methylprednisolone acetate diluted in preserva-
tive-free normal saline or 0.1–0.125% bupivacaine. The to-
tal volume of injectate is 6 to 8 ml. For the transforami-
nal technique, 20–40 mg of methylprednisolone acetate in 
0.1–0.125% bupivacaine for a total volume of 1 to 2 ml is 
injected. We repeat the injection if the previous one pro-
vides prolonged but incomplete relief, or if the pain returns 
after prolonged complete relief. Three injections per year 
are generally the maximum, to avoid serious adverse effects 
of steroids. Triamcinolone acetonide and betamethasone ac-
etate are alternatives to methylprednisolone acetate. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 We do not routinely obtain laboratory screening before the 
procedure unless there is an indication; for instance, if co-
agulopathy is suspected, a serum coagulogram should be 
obtained. 
 Our patients can elect to have the procedure done with 
or without sedation. In general, transforaminal injections 
tend to cause more pain and discomfort than injections with 
the interlaminar technique, because the needles penetrate 
layers of muscles. Furthermore, patients frequently expe-
rience paresthesiae during the procedure performed with 
the transforaminal technique. In this case, mild to moder-
ate sedation along with intravenous analgesics can make 
the patients very comfortable. Intravenous midazolam and 
fentanyl are our drugs of choice. Deep sedation is not desir-
able because cooperation from and communication with 
the patient is required and the duration of the procedure is 
usually short. 
 Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely given, since 
the risk of infection from the procedure is extremely low, 
provided the fact that the patient’s back is appropriately 
prepped with three passes of povidone-iodine solution and 
a strict sterile technique is maintained throughout the en-
tire procedure. 
 After a detailed explanation of risks, beneﬁ ts, and alterna-
tives, the patient signs an informed consent and is brought 
to a procedural suite that has resuscitation equipment and 
supplies for airway management. Blood pressure, oxygen 
saturation by means of pulse oxymetry, and electrocardi-
ogram are monitored, especially in sedated patients. The 
patient is instructed to inform us, should he or she develop 
paresthesias during needle manipulations or injections. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injections 
 Interlaminar epidural steroid injections can be performed 
either “blind” (without ﬂ uoroscopic guidance) or under 
ﬂ uoroscopy. 
 For blind epidurals, patients may be positioned in sitting, 
lateral decubitus, or prone position. After informed consent 
is obtained, the patient is placed on the table and monitors 
are attached. The skin of the lower back is prepped with three 
passes of povidone-iodine solution and draped. Lumbar 
spinous processes are palpated as landmarks. The spinous 
processes at the level of the iliac crest are approximately 
L3–L4. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are anesthetized 
with 1% bicarbonated Lidocaine. An 18-gauge Tuohy needle 
is inserted midline between the spinous processes and ad-
vanced until the needle engages the interspinous ligament 
 ( Figs. 26.1A and 26.2A ) . The stylet is removed and a loss-
of-resistance syringe ﬁ lled with preservative-free saline or 
air is attached to the needle. The Tuohy needle is advanced 
slowly while continuous pressure is applied on the plunger. 
When the needle opening penetrates the ligamentum ﬂ a-
vum and enters the epidural space, the plunger advances 
effortlessly without resistance  ( Figs. 26.1B and 26.2B ) . 
 For ﬂ uoroscopy-guided epidural steroid injection, the pa-
tient is positioned prone. The ﬂ uoroscope is positioned in 
anterior-posterior (AP) view. The interspace is conﬁ rmed 
under ﬂ uoroscopy. The needle tip is placed on the skin un-
der ﬂ uoroscopy until it overlaps the desired point of entry 
into the epidural space. This is the insertion site for the 
needle. The desired point may be at midline, to the left or 
right of the midline, but within the interlaminar space. Then 
the Tuohy needle is advanced similarly to the blind epi-
dural steroid injection with occasional ﬂ uoroscopic views 
to conﬁ rm trajectory of the needle toward the interlaminar 
space. When the needle opening penetrates the ligamentum 
ﬂ avum and enters the epidural space, a loss of resistance 
will be appreciated. 
 The needle tip placement in the epidural space and not 
in ligaments or the subarachnoid space must be conﬁ rmed. 
An aspiration is obtained to conﬁ rm that no cerebrospinal 
ﬂ uid or blood is drawn. If blood or cerebrospinal ﬂ uid is en-
countered, the needle must be removed and a needle place-
ment at a different level is considered. The correct needle 
placement can further be conﬁ rmed by injecting a contrast 
material or local anesthetics. With ﬂ uoroscopy, 1 ml or more 
of a nonionic radiographic contrast medium such as iohexol 
(Omnipaque 180 and Omnipaque 240, Nycomed Imaging 
A.S., Roskilde, Denmark) or iopamidol (Isovue, Bracco Di-
agnostics Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) will show spread of the 
contrast in the epidural space, typically with vacuolated ap-
pearance  ( Fig. 26.3 ) . Another option is to inject 1 ml of 1–2% 
preservative-free Lidocaine to conﬁ rm the needle placement. 
If the needle is in the intrathecal space, the patient will ex-
perience motor and sensory loss from the local anesthetic. 
On the lateral ﬂ uoroscopic view, the needle tip is seen at the 
posterior epidural space and most of the contrast material is 
typically visualized as a straight line outlining the posterior 
epidural space cephalad and caudad to the needle tip  ( Fig. 
26.4 ) . After conﬁ rming the needle placement, proceed with 
the steroid injection, which should ﬂ ow effortlessly. 
 A corticosteroid of choice, either 40–80 mg of methyl-
prednisolone or 20–40 mg of triamcinolone, is diluted in 
preservative-free saline or 0.1–0.125% bupivacaine. The total 
volume of injectate is usually 6 to 8 ml. All solution injected 
into the epidural space must be for epidural use.

Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections 159
 Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injections 
 Transforaminal epidural steroid injections must be per-
formed under ﬂ uoroscopy. For L1 to L4 nerve roots, starting 
with AP view, the ﬂ uoroscope is positioned to align the su-
perior and inferior end plates of the vertebral body. Then the 
ﬂ uoroscope is rotated in an ipsilateral oblique angle until 
the superior articular process (SAP) bisects or almost bisects 
the vertebral body superior end plate. A “Scotty Dog” image 
is obtained where the dog’s nose is the transverse process, 
the pedicle is the eye, the SAP is the ear, and lamina forms 
the body  ( Fig. 26.5  ). After the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and 
muscles are anesthetized with 1% bicarbonated Lidocaine, a 
3 or 5 inch 22-gauge spinal needle is inserted at the area just 
inferolateral to the pedicle  ( Fig. 26.5 ) . At the L1 and L2 nerve 
roots, the needle position should be even more inferolateral 
to the pedicle to avoid the artery of Adamkiewicz. The nee-
dle is advanced incrementally with intermittent AP ﬂ uoro-
scopic view until the needle tip is below or just inferolateral 
to the 6 o’clock position of the pedicle in A-P view. Once the 
needle position in the AP view is achieved, the lateral view

direct contact with the vertebral body at this point. When

utes after the procedure. If the patient’s vital signs are stable 
and no other complications are present, the patient may 
be discharged. In sedated cases, we transfer the patients 
to the postanesthesia care unit to recover from anesthesia. 
Postdural puncture headache is probably the most common 
complication that occurs when the needle placement is too 
deep and results in penetration of the dura mater into the 
intrathecal space. The incidence is lower with older patients 
age. The headache can be so severe that the patient becomes 
bedridden; however, it is generally self-limited after a short 
time. Treatments range from oral analgesics and epidural 
blood patches to surgical repair. 
 Epidural hematoma is a serious complication that can 
usually be prevented. The key is to avoid performing the 
procedure on patients with risks of bleeding. Early diagno-
sis and surgical decompression are extremely important to 
prevent permanent neurologic damage. 
 Epidural abscess may result in permanent neurologic 
damage; therefore, urgent surgical drainage and intravenous 
antibiotics are vital. Meticulous aseptic technique must be 
maintained throughout the procedure. A high index of sus-
picion, especially in high-risk groups such as HIV-positive, 
diabetic, other immunocompromised patients, will help di-
agnosis to be made in a timely manner. 
 Meningitis and arachnoiditis have been reported from 
intrathecal injections of methylprednisolone with polyeth-
ylene glycol as a preservative. However, there have been no 
reports of adhesive arachnoiditis in patients who received 
only epidural steroid injections. Albeit rare, there were re-
ports of septic and aseptic meningitis after epidural steroid 
injections. Intrathecal injections of local anesthetics can 
result in sudden onset of neurologic deﬁ cits and urinary 
advancing the needle, caution is exercised not to pierce the 
nerve root, which if pierced will cause the patient to feel 
intense paresthesiae or lancinating pain radiating into the 
leg. If the patient reports either of these, the needle must 
be pulled back and repositioned. Once intravascular and 
intrathecal position of the needle tip have been ruled out by 
a negative aspiration, 0.5–1 ml of contrast is injected to con-
ﬁ rm the needle placement. The contrast should travel into 
the ipsilateral anterior epidural space at the same level and 
may outline the nerve root  ( Fig. 26.6 ) . A total of 20–40 mg of 
methylprednisolone, 10–20 mg of triamcinolone, or 3–4 mg 
of betamethasone can be injected. Preservative-free normal 
saline or a local anesthetic may be added to the steroid to 
achieve the desirable volume of the injectate. 
 For the L5 nerve root, the ﬂ uoroscopic positioning is simi-
lar to that of the L1–L4 levels. However, rather than the S1 
SAP bisecting the vertebral body superior end plate on the 
oblique view, the C-arm is rotated in a similar fashion until 
a triangle is formed by the S1 SAP, the inferior border of L5 
transverse process, and the iliac crest  ( Fig. 26.7 ) . The spinal 
needle is passed within the triangle  ( Fig. 26.8 )  and the AP 
and the lateral views are used to conﬁ rm the needle place-
ment in a similar fashion. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 After the procedure, patients who did not receive sedation 
can be discharged from the hospital, if they have no compli-
cations. For patients who received a local anesthetic epidur-
ally, vital signs should be monitored for at least 10–15 min-

retention. Allergic reactions from injected medications or 
contrast dye are rare but possible. 
 Spinal cord and nerve root injury from incorrect needle 
placements are rare in experienced practitioners. However, 
to avoid damage to patients of neurologic tissue, caution 
must be exercised, especially when the patient reports par-
esthesiae during needle placements. Injury to the segmental 
artery and the artery of Adamkiewicz may result in serious 
permanent damage to the spinal cord and paraplegia. 
 Adrenal insufﬁ ciency can be prolonged after a series of 
injections. An epidural injection of 80 mg of methylpred-
nisolone acetate can cause adrenal suppression for up to 3 
weeks. Therefore, an elective major surgery within 1 month 
after the injection should be postponed. Apart from adrenal 
suppression, Cushing syndrome can also occur, even after 
only one epidural steroid injection. 
 Minor complications such as anxiety and vasovagal reﬂ ex 
may occur when the procedure is performed. These can be 
minimized by reassuring the patient and fully explaining 
the steps and nature of this noninvasive procedure before 
it is started. Some patients may experience signiﬁ cant ben-
eﬁ ts from light sedation. Back pain, which is usually muscu-
loskeletal and tends to be self-limited, is another common 
but generally benign adverse reaction.

 Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Movement 
Disorders 
 Ronald F. Young 
 Patient Selection 
 Brain lesioning by stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment 
of movement disorders is primarily used to treat tremor. 
Patients are selected for this procedure in the same manner 
as for procedures such as radiofrequency thalamotomy or 
deep brain stimulation (DBS). Patients should be assessed 
in a multidisciplinary movement disorders clinic to con-
ﬁ rm the underlying diagnosis, to ensure that adequate phar-
macological treatment has been provided before surgical 
intervention is considered, and to quantify the severity of 
the tremor by use of one of the standard tremor scoring sys-
tems. Neuropsychological testing should also be performed, 
because surgical intervention is generally not considered 
appropriate for patients with signiﬁ cant dementia. Radio-
surgical thalamotomy is particularly suitable for patients 
with tremor who are very elderly, who use anticoagulants 
chronically, who are immunosuppressed, or who have mar-
ginal mental status function. Radiosurgical thalamotomy 
may be considered for patients with Parkinson disease (PD) 
in whom tremor is the dominant or only signiﬁ cant symp-
tom. Radiosurgical thalamotomy may also be considered an 
alternative form of treatment for other forms of tremor such 
as tremor caused by multiple sclerosis or after head injury, 
stroke, or encephalitis. Unilateral or bilateral pallidotomy 
may also be accomplished with radiosurgical techniques 
but is rarely used currently because of the superior effec-
tiveness of subthalamic DBS in treating the full spectrum 
of PD symptoms. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The minimally invasive nature of radiosurgical lesioning 
procedures makes extensive preoperative laboratory evalu-
ation unnecessary. The essential preoperative evaluation 
is to conﬁ rm the nature of the patient’s tremor, to ensure 
that adequate pharmacological treatment has been tried, to 
quantitatively assess the severity of the tremor and conﬁ rm 
that it is disabling, and to ensure that the patient’s cogni-
tive mental function is adequate. A preoperative cerebral 
magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan is recommended to 
assess brain anatomy and any unsuspected pathology be-
cause these may inﬂ uence stereotactic treatment planning 
or the outcome of the procedure. Extensive cerebral atrophy, 
which might disqualify a patient for a DBS implant, does not 
preclude safe and effective radiosurgical treatment of move-
ment disorders as long as cognitive function is adequate. 
 Operative Procedure 
 Radiosurgical lesioning is a closed technique, that is, the 
skull is not opened. As a result, the radiosurgical target can-
not be deﬁ ned by microelectrode recording but must depend 
instead on MRI scan deﬁ nition only. Consequently, every ef-
fort must be made to ensure that sources of MRI distortion 
are eliminated or corrected for in calculating the stereotac-
tic target coordinates. For treating tremor, the target is the 
ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus contralateral to the 
side of the tremor being treated. For pallidotomy the target 
is the ventral posteromedial globus pallidus (Gpi). 
 The procedure begins by application of the stereotactic 
frame. Mild intravenous sedation (Midazolam 1 mg and Fen-
tanyl 50 μg) and local anesthesia are used to apply the frame. 
Every effort should be made to place the stereotactic frame 
to minimize offsets caused by pitch, roll, and yaw errors. The 
base of the frame should be placed parallel to the line be-
tween the external auditory canal and the ﬂ oor of the orbit 
to be parallel to the intercommissural plane. This placement 
will ensure that the anterior commissure (AC) and poste-
rior commissure (PC) are visible on the same axial MRI scan 
slice. The MRI scan sequences, which we use for target plan-
ning, are shown in   Table 27.1  . For target planning with the

Gamma Knife (Elektra, Inc., Atlanta, GA), the Leksell Gamma 
Plan computer is used. The planning begins by identiﬁ cation 
of the AC and PC on axial and reconstructed sagittal images 
 ( Fig. 27.1 ) . The intercommissural distance is then measured 
and the midcommissural point is deﬁ ned. For thalamotomy, a 
reconstructed coronal image is selected 5–6 mm posterior to 
the midcommissural point, for an average intercommissural 
distance of 26 mm. A simulated target is placed in the inferior 
lateral corner of the thalamic mass as identiﬁ ed on the coro-
nal image, such that the 50% isodose line (4 mm collimator) 
is coincident with the inferior lateral border of the thalamus 
 ( Fig. 27.2 ) . The stereotactic coordinates for this point are then 
obtained from the Gamma Plan computer. The only portion of 
the stereotactic targeting, which is done empirically, is the se-
lection of the distance posterior to the midcommissural point 
at which the coronal reconstruction is viewed. This distance 
is increased or decreased proportionate to the distance that 
the intercommissural point is more or less than 26 mm. The 
remainder of the targeting is done based on direct visualiza-
tion of the individual patient’s anatomy. 
 For pallidotomy, an axial image is selected that demon-
strates both commissures. A reconstructed coronal image 
is then viewed at a point 2–3 mm anterior to the mid-com-
missural point. The Gpi and the subjacent optic tract are 
visualized and the isocenter is positioned such that the 50% 
isodose line (4 mm collimator) is within the Gpi and supe-
rior to the optic tract. The stereotactic coordinates for this 
point are then obtained from the Gamma Plan computer. 
The importance of deﬁ ning the target on both axial and 
coronal scans cannot be overemphasized to properly de-
termine the Z or vertical coordinate in relation to the optic 
tract. The 50% isodose line should be as far as possible from

the optic tract consistent with a location, which includes the 
Gpi completely within the 50% line. 
 In our center we employ an algorithm, developed in-house, 
to correct for errors of pitch, roll, and yaw in stereotactic 
frame placement to obtain stereotactic target coordinates 
that reﬂ ect, as accurately as possible, the true anatomical 
location of the intended target. 
 Based on years of experience and long-term follow-up of 
hundreds of patients, we recommend a maximum radiosur-
gical dose of 140 Gy (output factor 0.87) for creating a brain 
lesion with the 4 mm secondary collimator helmet of the 
Leksell Gamma Unit. With these parameters a lesion about 
6 mm in diameter (113 mm 3  volume) will usually develop 
3–9 months after the procedure. Lesions will develop more 
rapidly with larger radiosurgical doses, but lesion volume 
will vary more and excessively large lesions associated with 
complications of the procedure will occur more frequently 
with larger doses. Smaller doses may sometimes fail to pro-
duce any deﬁ nable lesion and therefore no therapeutic ef-
fect. Follow-up MRI scans are recommended at regular in-
tervals postoperatively, particularly if the patient develops 
complications or if the symptoms for which the treatment 
was performed fail to improve. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 After a unilateral lesion we recommend that at least one 
year elapse before a contralateral lesion is performed. We 
further recommend that an MRI scan be performed imme-
diately before a second, contralateral lesion to conﬁ rm that 
the ﬁ rst lesion is of the usual size (about 6 mm diameter) 
and that there are no surrounding signal changes indicative 
of an excessive radiation reaction. Targeting and lesioning 
techniques are then performed in an identical fashion to the 
ﬁ rst lesion  ( Figs. 27.3A,B ) . 
 Unlike traditional open surgical procedures, complica-
tions of radiosurgery do not appear until many months after 
the procedure is completed. Complications of radiosurgical 
lesioning for the treatment of movement disorders arise 
from lesions, which develop larger than expected. Compli-
cations may also arise from misplaced lesions. Lesions typi-
cally develop gradually over a period of 2–6 months after 
the procedure at which time they reach their maximum 
volume and appear on gadolinium-enhanced MRI scan as a 
spherical contrast enhancing structure. The enhancement 
may be homogeneous, or mainly peripheral with a central

zone that does not demonstrate enhancement. Sometimes, 
however, the lesion continues to enlarge and is associated 
with diffuse MRI signal changes consistent with radiation-
induced edema, although most studies suggest that these 
zones are mainly composed of glial cell inﬁ ltration. Such 
lesions may involve the internal capsule or ventral poste-
rior thalamic nucleus after thalamotomy or the optic tract 
or internal capsule after pallidotomy. Associated deﬁ cits 
include sensory loss, weakness or paralysis, dysphasia, and 
visual ﬁ eld deﬁ cits. In our experience, after thalamotomy, 
about 4–5% of patients experience such side effects, but 
gradual recovery over a period of several months is usual. 
Commonly the deﬁ cits are mild, and we have never had to 
hospitalize a patient to manage such deﬁ cits. Homonymous 
hemianopsia after pallidotomy is a serious deﬁ cit and is 
seen in up to 4–6% of patients. In our experience such visual 
ﬁ eld deﬁ cits are permanent and not surprising in view of 
the proximity of the optic tract to the Gpi, which may re-
ceive as much as 15–25 Gy, well beyond the usual 8–9 Gy 
maximum radiation dose tolerance usually accepted for the 
optic apparatus.  
 The relatively high incidence of visual ﬁ eld defects after 
radiosurgical pallidotomy has caused us to limit its use to 
very rare cases in which DBS or radiofrequency pallidotomy 
cannot be used and the patient is signiﬁ cantly disabled by 
PD. Corticosteroids are of little or no use in treating the 
complications of radiosurgical lesioning. As the acute ra-
diation effects subside, the perilesional signal changes and 
the large lesions begin to recede and concomitantly the as-
sociated symptoms begin to decrease and then disappear 
in most cases. Several years after radiosurgical lesioning 
procedures, the lesion appears as a nonenhancing spheri-
cal T1 hypointensity on MRI. Radiosurgical thalamotomy 
resolves tremor completely or nearly completely in 85–90% 
of patients with PD or essential tremor and about 50% of 
patients with other forms of tremor.

  Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation for the 
Control of Tremor 
 Jason M.  Schwalb,  Clement Hamani, and  Andres Lozano 
  A speciﬁ c relay nucleus within the ventral thalamus, the 
ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus or its afferent axonal 
projections are currently the most widely chosen surgical 
targets for tremor that is not associated with Parkinson 
disease. Ventral thalamic nuclei are populated by neurons 
that ﬁ re in synchronous bursts whose timing is similar to 
peripheral tremor. The close temporal relationship between 
tremor and bursts of thalamic neuronal activity has led to 
the suggestion that these thalamic tremor cells could act as 
tremorigenic pacemakers. Intraoperative electrical stimula-
tion, or even insertion of a brain cannula or electrode, in ar-
eas of the thalamus populated by these tremor-synchronous 
cells is often sufﬁ cient to temporarily arrest tremor. Deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an alternative to 
lesions for treating movement disorders  ( Table 28.1 ) . 
 Patient Selection 
 Patients with functionally disabling essential tremor who 
fail conventional medical treatment are excellent candi-
dates for DBS. More distal tremors may be more effectively 
treated with thalamic DBS than proximal tremors involving 
the shoulder. For patients with multiple sclerosis-associated 
tremor, their disease needs to be fairly stable and they need 
to have at least 3 of 5 strength in the affected limb. Judg-
ment needs to be exercised in determining whether diminu-
tion or resolution of their tremor would lead to functional 
improvement because these patients often have other de-
bilitating neurologic deﬁ cits. In addition, it can be difﬁ cult 
to differentiate tremor from ataxia and dysmetria, especially 
if there are additional sensory or motor deﬁ cits. These pa-
tients are less likely than patients with essential tremor to 
derive long-term tremor control with thalamic DBS. Simi-
larly, for patients with posttraumatic or poststroke tremor, 
a determination of how much would be gained in functional 
status if their tremor is resolved needs to be made. These 
patients also seem to have a higher complication rate from 
surgery. 
 The risks of bilateral thalamic lesions (particularly to 
speech) can be quite high, reaching 60% in some series. Con-
sequently, perhaps the strongest indication for VIM thalamic 
DBS is the patient who has already undergone thalamotomy 
and requires a contralateral procedure. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Patients are evaluated by a neurologist who conﬁ rms the 
diagnosis and concludes that the tremor is resistant to

available medication. Advanced age is not a criterion for 
exclusion, but patients must show no evidence of signiﬁ cant 
cognitive impairment and must be able to tolerate a pro-
cedure under local anesthesia that lasts several hours. The 
patient’s tremor is evaluated with a standardized scale  ( Ta-
ble 28.2 ) . The scale describes the distribution and severity 
of tremor at rest, with maintenance of a sustained posture 
and with action. Because of the ﬂ uctuating nature of tremor 
severity and the effects of anti-tremor drugs, repeated as-
sessments that take into account whether the patient is on 
or off drugs are most informative. For essential tremor pa-
tients, most studies require that assessment be made after 
longer periods (days to weeks) off drugs. 
 Anti-tremor medications are withheld the day of surgery 
to accentuate the patient’s tremor. This facilitates the iden-
tiﬁ cation of thalamic tremor cells and allows the testing 
of the effects of manipulations on tremor throughout the 
operative procedure (for example, electrode insertion and 
electrical stimulation), which are of important localizing 
value. Similarly, we do not use any sedation or narcotics 
until after the electrode is implanted because these may af-
fect our microelectrode recording and the need for cogent 
feedback from the patient during the procedure. For agi-
tated patients who are hypertensive during surgery (greater 
than 150/90), we use labetalol. We usually do not use an-
ticonvulsants or arterial lines. Since we generally operate 
unilaterally, we ask the anesthetist to not place the blood 
pressure cuff and intravenous line in the arm that will be 
evaluated during surgery. 
 Stereotactic Imaging 
 A stereotactic frame is placed on the skull using a local an-
esthetic (1% Lidocaine) at the pin sites. Patients undergo 
stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or spiral 
computed tomography (CT), if unable to have an MRI, to 
calculate the coordinates of the anterior commissure (AC) 
and posterior commissure (PC). A series of 2-mm thick axial 
CT or 3D inversion recovery MRI scans are performed on a 
GE Signa 1.5-T unit. The MRI parameters we use are TR 4000 
millisecondsec, TE 90 millisecondsec, echo train 8, ﬁ eld of 
view 270 mm 2 , matrix 256  256, and frequency anterior-
posterior. The axial images are imported into a StealthSta-
tion where planning is performed with FrameLink 4.1 soft-
ware (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Coronal and 
sagittal images are reconstructed from the axial images. The 
coordinates of the AC and PC are identiﬁ ed and three ad-
ditional points are identiﬁ ed in the midline. The software 
then reformats the images parallel to the AC-PC line and 
orthogonal to the midline, eliminating the pitch, roll, and 
yaw that are present with uneven frame placement. 
 For patients with arm tremor, the initial target is usually 
15 mm from the midline, 3 mm anterior to the PC, and at the 
same depth (Z coordinate) as the PC. The target is adjusted 
laterally in patients with wide third ventricles (11–12 mm 
lateral to the wall of the third ventricle). We choose our ﬁ rst 
stereotactic trajectory to traverse the VIM nucleus and the 
ventral caudal (VC) (somatosensory nucleus, also known as 
ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial) nucleus. 
The VC nucleus represents a large, readily identiﬁ able tha-
lamic landmark on which to base decisions on the selection 
of subsequent electrode trajectories and by which to choose 
the ﬁ nal target for the DBS electrode. A sagittal map 14.5 
mm from the midline, based on the Schaltenbrand-Wahren 
Atlas, is shown in   Figure 28.1 . This is the most common 
starting laterality for tremor surgery. 
 Operative Procedure 
 In the operating suite, the patient is placed in a semi-sitting 
position. The frontal scalp is washed, shaved, and painted 
with Betadine (povidone-iodine) solution. Intravenous pro-
phylactic antibiotics directed at skin ﬂ ora are administered. 
The surgical site is draped. Under local anesthesia, a 3 cm 
linear parasagittal incision is made 2 cm from the midline 
and just anterior to the coronal suture on the side oppo-
site the most disabling tremor; the side contralateral to 
the dominant hand is chosen in patients with symmetrical 
symptoms. A 14.5 mm bur hole is made at the coronal su-
ture 20 mm from the midline. The dura is opened and the 
pia-arachnoid is coagulated with a bipolar forceps, avoiding 
surface vessels. The coagulated pia is incised with a blade. 
The dural opening is sealed with ﬁ brin glue to prevent cer-
ebrospinal ﬂ uid leakage and air entry. 
 Thalamic Mapping 
 Physiological corroboration of the thalamic target is man-
datory. Two alternate techniques are used for physiological

Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation for the Control of Tremor 171
mapping: macroelectrode stimulation, or microelectrode 
recordings and stimulation. Macroelectrodes allow thalamic 
mapping based on the interpretation of macrostimulation 
responses (mA currents). The technique of macroelectrode 
mapping is rapid and requires minimal equipment, but does 
not allow neuronal recording. Microelectrodes, on the other 
hand, allow the acquisition of direct measures of cellular ac-
tivity from individual neurons, offer exquisite physiological 
resolution of thalamic nuclei based on the pattern of neu-
ronal activity, and allow determination of receptive ﬁ elds. 
These advantages come at the price of extra time required 
for the procedures, the additional equipment needed, and 
the higher level of expertise required. We use the micro-
electrode technique exclusively and will emphasize this 
technique in this chapter. 
 Physiological corroboration of the thalamic target is 
achieved by using microelectrode recordings and stimula-
tion. A guide tube (about 1 mm in outer diameter) is in-
serted to a point 10 mm above the target. A microelectrode 
(0.2 to 1 megohm impedance at 1000 KHz with a diameter 
of about 15 μm at its tip) is introduced into the guide tube 
and is advanced in submillimeter steps with a microdrive. 
We use two microelectrodes side by side in the same guide 
tube with separate drivers for the recordings. The electrode 
conducts the cellular activity and also allows the passage of 
small electric currents to study the effects of microelectri-
cal stimulation. The cellular electrical signal is ampliﬁ ed, 
ﬁ ltered, and displayed on an oscilloscope and fed to an audio 
monitor. A window discriminator is used to count the dis-
charge frequency of the units. This technique allows individ-
ual neuronal units to be recorded. Electrical current (1 to 100 
μA, 300 Hz, and 100-μsec pulse widths) is delivered through 
the tip of the electrode for microstimulation mapping. 
 Physiological localization is performed by (1) identifying 
the VC nucleus based on the presence of a large number of 
cells responding to tactile stimulation in small receptive 
ﬁ elds; (2) studying the thalamic nuclei anterior to the VC 
nucleus for kinesthetic inputs, responses to voluntary move-
ment, and activity correlated with tremor; and (3) observing 
the effects of microstimulation on the patient’s tremor. The 
physiological criteria used in target selection are outlined 
in   Table 28.3 . 
  The ventrolateral motor thalamus consists of three nuclei: 
ventral oral anterior, ventral oral posterior, and VIM  ( Fig. 
28.1 ) . Typical trajectories through the thalamus are shown 
in   Figure 28.2  . All information on the receptive ﬁ elds of 
thalamic neurons encountered in the trajectories and the ef-
fects of microstimulation along each tract are recorded and 
annotated onto enlarged stereotactic maps of the thalamus 
as shown in   Figure 28.2  . This permits the physiological and 
anatomical data to be correlated. 
 The goal of surgery is to place the DBS electrode at a site 
where stimulation will suppress tremor without causing 
unwanted side effects. Although the exact target is still de-
bated, effective thalamic sites for the treatment of tremor 
are (1) areas populated by neurons whose spontaneous rate 
of discharge is synchronous with tremor (tremor cells;   Figs. 
28.2 and 28.3 ) ; and (2) areas where the mechanical trauma 
of electrode passage or small bursts of electrical current ar-
rest tremor. The tentative target for the electrode is usually

thalamus 14.5 mm from the midline. The 
ventral tier nuclei, their inputs and out-
puts, are most frequently arranged along a 
parasagittal, anterior to posterior axis. The 
major nuclei are identiﬁ ed using Hassler's 
nomenclature. The afferent and efferent 
connections of these nuclei in humans are 
not completely understood. One view is 
that the ventral oral anterior and ventral 
oral posterior receive predominantly basal 
ganglia inputs (globus pallidus internus and 
substantia nigra reticulate) and project to 
premotor cortical areas. Ventral intermedi-
ate is believed to receive predominantly cer-
ebellar inputs and vestibular and kinesthetic 
inputs and to project to the motor cortex. 
VC, the sensory nucleus, receives the me-
dial lemniscus and spinothalamic tracts 
and projects predominantly to the sensory 
cortex. Abbreviations: Ret = reticular; DO =

between kinesthetic and tactile neurons.

 Fig. 28.2    Functional map of thalamic neuronal activity. Three trajecto-
ries along ventral oral posterior, ventral intermediate (VIM), and ventral 
caudal (VC) (enlarged from Figure 1) separated by 2 mm in the 15 mm 
parasagittal plane are shown. The neuronal responses are detected by 
microelectrode recordings as changes in the baseline rate of action po-
tential discharges in individual neurons. The nature of the stimulus pro-
voking the neuronal responses is indicated by the colored bars. There is 
a good but not exact ﬁ t between the physiological data and the atlas-
derived projected thalamic map. The localization of the VC is conﬁ rmed 
by observing tactile neurons that respond to light stroking of the skin 
in a discrete receptive ﬁ eld. In trajectory 1, the tactile responses were 
obtained by touching the skin of the ﬁ ngers and hand with the hairs of 
a ﬁ ne paintbrush, indicating that at this laterality was found the soma-
totopic representation for cutaneous sensation in the upper extremity. 
In trajectory 2, deep tactile neurons responding to muscle or tendon 
squeezing or tapping (in this case biceps and forearm) were encoun-
tered. This class of neurons is usually found in the area of the border of 
VIM with VC. Kinesthetic neurons responding to movements of the wrist 
and elbow joint were observed in the three trajectories. In trajectory 3, 
neurons with voluntary responses to pointing and opening and closing 
the hand were identiﬁ ed. The location of thalamic neurons ﬁ ring in syn-
chrony with tremor in the contralateral arm in this patient is indicated 
by the asterisks .  At sites marked TA, tremor was arrested by electrical 
stimulation at 25 to 100 μA, 300 Hz, and 100 millisecondsec pulse width 
delivered in 1-second trains. Sites with tremor-synchronous neurons or 
where electrical stimulation abolishes tremor are good potential targets 
for insertion of the DBS electrode. In this patient, the quadripolar DBS 
electrode was inserted in trajectory 3 with the most distal electrode 
at the base of the thalamus, a position marked by the transition from 
neurons to axons. The electrode was inserted in trajectory 3 rather than 
trajectory 2, which also had tremor cells and sites where stimulation 
produced tremor arrest, to avoid the production of paresthesias associ-
ated with current spread to the nearby sensory (VC) nucleus. PC = pos-
terior commissure.

within the physiologically deﬁ ned VIM nucleus, 3 to 4 mm 
anterior to the border of the tactile sensory VC thalamus. 
The medial lateral placement is chosen on the basis of so-
matotopy. Intraoral structures and the face representation 
are most medial, about 12–14 mm from the midline. Upper 
limb representation is usually 14–16 mm from the midline 
and the lower limb just lateral to this. Lateral to VC lies the 
reticular nucleus shell and the internal capsule with the 
corticospinal ﬁ bers. The distal tip of the electrode is placed 
at the most ventral portion of the VIM, at the border of the 
base of the thalamus with the afferent axonal projections 
 ( Fig. 28.2 ) . 
 Electrode Implantation 
 The most popular DBS electrodes currently in use are quad-
ripolar and 28 or 40 cm long  ( Fig. 28.4 ) . At its distal end, the 
stimulating electrode has four platinum-iridium cylindrical 
surfaces (1.27 mm in diameter, 1.52 mm in length) with a 3 
mm center-to-center separation (3387 DBS, Medtronic, Min-
neapolis, MN, USA). To be in constant control of the course 
and position of the DBS electrode during introduction, po-
sitioning, and securing, the procedure is done under ﬂ uoro-
scopic control with the beam orthogonal to the stereotactic 
frame. We use the C-shaped plastic ring and cap that are 
packaged with the DBS electrode to secure the electrode. 
A 180 mm styleted cannula with an inner diameter that is 
slightly larger than the DBS electrode is inserted to the tar-
get under ﬂ uoroscopic guidance. This shorter cannula (190 
mm from the Leksell arc to the target of the frame) is used 
to make it easier to withdraw the cannula while holding the 
DBS electrode in place. The stylet is removed and the DBS 
electrode is inserted through the cannula to target. The elec-
trode manufacturer provides a DBS electrode holding de-
vice, which stabilizes and holds the DBS position while the 
cannula is partially withdrawn to expose the contacts  ( Fig. 
28.5 ) . Monopolar testing is performed with a Medtronic 
screener at 130 Hz, 90 microseconds and increasing volt-
ages to 10 V or until adverse effects are produced. In many 
cases, the patient will have little or no tremor at this point 
because of the mechanical insertional effect associated with 
the introduction of the cannula and DBS electrode. If adverse 
effects such as persistent or painful paresthesias at less than 
3.5 V occur with a low threshold, the electrode may be re-
positioned to a more favorable site chosen on the basis of 
the thalamic mapping data. If the location is felt to be good, 
the cannula is further removed under ﬂ uoroscopic control 
to ensure that the DBS electrode is not displaced  ( Fig. 28.6 ) . 
The stylet is removed from the DBS electrode and the brain 
cannula is completely removed while the DBS electrode is 
held in place. The DBS electrode is bent 90 degrees at the 
skull surface and anchored to the bur hole ring by wedging it 
into the ring’s groove. A bur hole cap secures the electrode in 
place. After a satisfactory position has been secured, the DBS 
electrode is either connected to a percutaneous lead (in-
serted through a scalp stab incision) for prolonged screening 
or the patient proceeds immediately to the implantation of 
a receiver or pulse-generating device  ( Fig. 28.7 ) .

 Receiver or Pulse Generator Implantation 
 The most popular pulse generators are implantable and pro-
grammable, and ﬁ tted with self-contained lithium batteries 
that can deliver current for several years  ( Figs. 28.4 and 
28.7 ) . The positioning used in the implantation procedure 
is similar to that for the insertion of ventriculoperitoneal 
shunts  ( Fig. 28.7 ) . The patient is given a general anesthetic. 
The scalp, neck, and upper chest are clipped, washed, and 
painted with a Betadine (povidone-iodine) solution. A dose 
of antibiotics is administered intravenously preoperatively, 
and two more doses are given postoperatively. The patient is 
positioned supine with the head turned to the opposite side 
and with a sandbag under the ipsilateral chest to elevate 
the area of the clavicle. A 6 cm horizontal incision is made 3 
cm below the clavicle. A subcutaneous tunnel is made con-
necting the scalp and infraclavicular incision with a device 
similar to a shunt tunneler, which is provided by the DBS 
electrode manufacturer. An electrode in-line extension is 
passed retrograde from infraclavicular to scalp incisions. 
The receiver or pulse generator is connected and secured 
to the extension with four screws. This device is ﬁ xed to 
the pectoralis fascia with nonabsorbable sutures to prevent 
migration. At the cranial end, the DBS electrode is connected 
to the extension by tightening the four screws. A clear plas-
tic sheath is secured over the assembly with silk ties. The 
wounds are closed and covered with sterile dressings. A 
diagram of the system in place is shown in  Figure 28.7 . 
 Programming 
 The parameters that may be adjusted include the choice of 
the following: (1) which of four stimulating electrodes to 
use (contact 0, 1, 2, 3, or any combination thereof); (2) the 
polarity of stimulation (each contact can be off, –, or +); (3) 
bipolar or monopolar stimulation with the pulse generator 
case being the anode; (4) the amplitude of stimulation; (5) 
the pulse width; and (6) the frequency of stimulation. The

possible enhances the adaptability of DBS. This is at the 
expense of the extra time and effort required to carefully 
study the effects produced with each new setting. In the 
initial period of 1 to 2 months after implantation, patients 
require frequent adjustment of the stimulation parameters 
to maximize beneﬁ ts and minimize side effects. Most pa-
tients turn the device off at bedtime by using a handheld 
magnet to control the pulse generator’s switch.

 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The complications of DBS for tremor can be considered in 
three categories: (1) those related to the surgical procedure; 
(2) those related to the hardware; and (3) those related to 
the electrical stimulation. The established risk of intrac-
erebral hemorrhage for functional stereotactic procedures 
is on the order of 1–2%. For this reason, and to document 
the position of the DBS electrode, we obtain postoperative 
MRIs on all patients  ( Fig. 28.8 ).  Hardware-related complica-
tions include DBS electrode fracture, extension wire failure, 
lead migration, erosion, infection, foreign body reaction, IPG 
malfunction and pain over the pulse generator. The risks of 
these complications vary from center to center for 2.7–50% 
of patients. 
 The spectrum of side effects experienced with VIM stimu-
lation from our series is shown in   Table 28.4 . Of note, side 
effects were reversible in all cases, mild, and accepted pro-
vided that the intensity of stimulation produced signiﬁ cant 
beneﬁ ts on tremor. In general, these side effects are similar 
to those experienced with VIM thalamotomy. The major dif-
ference is the reversibility of side effects with stimulation. 
 Patients with essential tremor (ET) can become tolerant of 
stimulation: they may require higher stimulation settings to 
obtain the same degree of beneﬁ t. However, this gradual in-
crease in stimulation may be problematic, because it may lead 
to side effects, such as speech difﬁ culty or paresthesias, as 
well as premature battery failure. Some have recommended 
cycling the stimulation at night in the hopes of avoiding this. 
Alternatively, some patients have gone on to have thalamo-
tomy lesions made through their DBS electrodes with good 
results. The discontinuation of stimulation may induce a re-
bound effect, in which the severity of tremor becomes worse 
than it was before stimulation commenced.

  Chronic Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation for 
Parkinson Disease 
 Brian Harris  Kopell , Andre Machado , and Ali R. Rezai 
    Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disor-
der associated with the death of dopaminergic cells in the 
substantia nigra (SN). Despite advances in the understand-
ing of the physiology of PD and improvements in pharmaco-
logical management, a substantial number of these patients 
are considered refractory to medical management because 
complications arise from medical therapy. Currently, the 
surgical standard for these patients is the implantation of 
deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and neurostimu-
lators; more than 35,000 such electrodes have been im-
planted worldwide. 
 The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is currently the most 
common target for DBS implantation because it has been 
demonstrated to effectively treat the entire spectrum of ad-
vanced PD symptoms: tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, motor 
ﬂ uctuations, and drug-induced dyskinesias. Furthermore, 
STN DBS is the only procedure that has been consistently 
demonstrated to reduce the need for dopaminergic medica-
tion postoperatively. 
 The mechanism of action of STN DBS is thought to be an 
interruption of excessive and abnormally patterned neuro-
nal activity in basal ganglia output. The connections of the 
STN with respect to the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocor-
tical motor circuit are shown in   Figure 29.1 . Information 
passing through the basal ganglia is organized anatomically 
though a direct and an indirect pathway. With regards to 
motor information, the putamen serves as the input struc-
ture, receiving input from the cerebral cortex. Direct path-
way information passes monosynaptically to the output 
structures of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internus 
(GPi), and the substantia nigra pars reticularis (SNr). Indi-
rect pathway information passes multisynaptically through 
the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and STN before terminat-
ing on GPi/SNr. Within these two pathways, only the STN is 
excitatory and glutamatergic; the other structures are all 
inhibitory and GABAergic. 
 Other anatomic relationships involving the STN have been 
elucidated and characterize the central role the STN may 
play in modulating motor behavior. The STN has a direct 
connection to SNc and has a reciprocal projection to the GPe 
and CM/Pf. A direct cortical projection, from primary motor 
cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor area to the 
STN, has been described and may be important in relaying 
sensory input to the basal ganglia and synchronizing oscil-
latory activity in the cortex, STN, and pallidum. 
 The STN is a biconvex lens shaped nucleus with a dense 
array of 560,000 neurons in a volume of 240mm. Several 
structures surround the STN that have particular relevance 
when considering the implantation of a DBS electrode in 
this area. The internal capsule, through which corticospinal 
and corticobulbar ﬁ bers pass, lies along the lateral and ante-
rior borders of the STN. Anteromedially lie ﬁ bers of the 3rd 
nerve, the posteromedial hypothalamus, and portions of the 
Fields of Forel. Posteromedially lie the red nucleus (RN), ﬁ b-

ers with cerebellothalamic projections, and the prelemnis-
cal radiation with ﬁ bers from the mesencephalic reticular 
activating system. Dorsal to the STN are the Zona incerta (ZI) 
and Forel Field H2 that separate it from the ventral border 
of the motor thalamus. Ventral to the STN are the cerebral 
peduncle and the substantia nigra. 
 Patient Selection 
 Neurological Screening 
 Surgical candidates must be thoroughly evaluated by a 
movement disorder neurologist. It is important to exclude 
patients with “Parkinson plus” syndromes such as multi-
system atrophy progressive supranuclear palsy, and striato-
nigral degeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
the brain is useful to rule out those with signiﬁ cant global 
atrophy, severe chronic ischemic changes, and structural 
abnormalities suggestive of atypical Parkinsonism. 
 STN DBS candidates should undergo a levodopa-challenge 
testing as part of the screening process. At the minimum, 
Uniﬁ ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III 
(motor) scores should be obtained in the off- and on-medi-
cation states. The patients should have at least a 30% de-
crease in UPDRS III scores in response to levodopa. Tremor is 
the only symptom that has been demonstrated to respond to 
STN DBS regardless of its degree of response to levodopa. 
 Symptoms that beneﬁ t most from STN DBS are appen-
dicular bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and gait disorder, to 
the extent that the gait disorder can improve with levodopa. 
DBS also ameliorates complications from dopamine replace-
ment therapy such as dyskinesias, on/off ﬂ uctuations, and 
on-period dystonia. Patients with asymmetric symptoms or 
those at higher risk for simultaneous bilateral implantation 
may be initially treated unilaterally. Axial symptoms such as 
postural instability, on-medication freezing, and hypopho-
nia, especially those who are medication insensitive, do not 
respond to STN DBS. 
 Medical Screening 
 Comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, 
and hypertension probably increase surgical risk, but do 
not exclude surgery if they are stable and optimally man-
aged. Younger patients tend to be better candidates; how-
ever, patients in their 70s may also beneﬁ t from surgery, 
with acceptable risk. Patients who depend on anti-platelet 
medications or Coumadin must be able to tolerate with-
drawal from these medications completely before undergo-
ing implantation. 
 Neuropsychological Screening 
 Patients with severe cognitive dysfunction or dementia on 
neuropsychological examination should be excluded from 
surgical intervention. Patients with mild cognitive impair-
ment or frontal dysexecutive syndrome may still undergo 
surgery, but they and their families should receive extra 
counseling about the potential for increased risk of post-
surgical cognitive impairment and confusion. Psychiatric 
conditions such as anxiety, depression, and mania must 
be identiﬁ ed and medically optimized preoperatively. The 
patient and family are counseled with regard to surgical 
expectations, emphasizing that STN DBS is not a cure but 
a way to control symptoms. Symptoms unlikely to respond 
should be highlighted. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Deep Brain Stimulation Electrode Implantation 
 We use microelectrode recording (MER) to perform STN DBS 
implantation on conscious patients in the off-medication 
state. This state accentuates the electrophysiologic char-
acteristics identiﬁ ed with MER and allows intraoperative 
testing of the lead for efﬁ cacy and for adverse effects. 
 Head Frame Placement 
 The head frame (Leksell G, Elekta, Inc., Atlanta GA, USA). 
is placed the morning of the surgical procedure with the 
patient awake, sitting in a wheelchair. The scalp is anes-
thetized at each pin site with local anesthesia (1:1 mixture 
of 0.25% bupivacaine and 2% Lidocaine). The base ring of 
the head frame should be placed as close to parallel to the 
anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) plane 
as possible. In addition, care should be taken to avoid any 
roll, pitch, or yaw because this will minimize two-plane 
adjustments when coordinate changes are performed dur-
ing surgery. Ear bars or an assistant holding the base-ring 
of the head frame can be used to ensure proper alignment. 
As a guideline, an imaginary line from the external auditory 
meatus to the lateral canthus of the eye can approximate 
the AC-PC plane  ( Fig. 29.2 ) . Alternative frameless systems 
for DBS placement are shown in  Figure 29.3 . 
 Preoperative Imaging 
 MRI is the imaging modality of choice in stereotactic tar-
geting and planning. Before the day of surgery, we acquire 
3 image sequences: a T1-weighted volumetric acquisition 
of the whole brain with gadolinium enhancement, a T2-
weighted axial acquisition through the region of the sub-
thalamus parallel to the AC-PC plane, and a T2-weighted 
coronal acquisition through the region of the subthalamus 
orthogonal to the AC-PC plane. The T2-weighted images are 
acquired in 2 mm intervals with no-gap. 1.5 or 3.0 T magnets 
can be employed successfully. On the morning of surgery, a 
stereotactic computed tomography (CT) is obtained (1 mm 
slices with no gap and no gantry tilt) and computationally 
fused with the MRI on a stereotactic planning station. CT is 
free from the image-distortions inherent to MRI and allow 
the stereotactic space to be deﬁ ned with a high degree of 
accuracy. Patients who have tremor-dominant PD should 
be scanned in their on-medication phase and patients with 
severe levodopa-associated dyskinesias should be scanned

in the off-medication phase to obtain scans with the mini-
mum motion artifact. 
 Anatomical Target Localization 
 The STN can be localized in two ways: indirect and direct tar-
geting. Indirect targeting refers to the method of localizing 
subcortical strictures in relation to the positions of the peri-
ventricular landmarks, the AC and PC, respectively. A standard-
ized brain atlas is used to deﬁ ne the  x- ,  y- . and  z- coordinates of 
the STN in relation to the midpoint of a line drawn between the 
commissures (midcommissural point, MCP)  ( Fig. 29.4 ).  
 As the image quality of MRI has evolved, the method of di-
rect targeting by visualization of the target structure borders 
has become feasible. The STN and other regional anatomic 
structures, the RN and the SN are fairly well seen on the T2-
weighted images  ( Fig. 29.5 ).  In practice, we use an amalgam 
of both techniques. Initially, we deﬁ ne the ventral border of 
the motor STN based on the Schaltenbrand-Wahren stere-
otactic atlas. Generally this corresponds to 11–12 mm lateral 
to midline, 3–4 mm posterior to MCP, and 4–5 mm ventral to 
MCP. We then use the T2-weighted images to ﬁ ne-tune the 
STN target obtained by the indirect method. We rely on the 
axial T2 images to adjust the x- and y- coordinates and the

coronal T2-images to adjust the x- and z- coordinates and 
minimize the inherent inaccuracy of choosing coordinates 
that are coplanar to the acquisition plane. 
 Once the STN is targeted, the angle of approach is de-
ﬁ ned with the volumetric contrast-enhanced T1 image set. 
In general we start with an AP angle that is about 50–70 
degrees with respect to the AC-PC plane and a lateral angle 
that is about 10–20 degrees from the parasagittal plane. The 
trajectory is altered in such a way as to avoid a transependy-
mal or transventricular approach. This is to avoid bleeding 
complications related to damage to ependymal blood ves-
sels. Similarly, the trajectory is modiﬁ ed to avoid traversing 
sulci or intrasulcal vessels highlighted by the gadolinium 
contrast  ( Fig. 29.6 ) . 
 Operative Procedure 
 The patient is positioned supine on the operating room ta-
ble, with the knees ﬂ exed and the head of the table slightly 
elevated. The head frame is ﬁ xed to the table. The patient’s 
feedback is solicited to ﬁ nd a neck position that is well tol-
erated. We then initiate short-acting sedation using the a2-
agonist, dexmedetomidine. This is to maximize patient com-
fort during Foley catheter insertion, incisions, and bur hole 
placement. In general, we prefer to perform the subsequent 
physiological localization of the STN with no sedation to pre-
vent any confounding of MER data and because a fully con-
scious patient will give the best feedback during test macros-
timulation. In our experience, however, we have successfully 
performed STN DBS implantation under dexmedetomidine 
sedation when sedation is absolutely necessary. 
 Intravenous prophylactic antibiotics are given. Tight blood 
pressure control (systolic blood pressure lower than 130 
mm Hg) is helpful to prevent intracranial hemorrhage. Pa-
tients with labile blood pressure may beneﬁ t from an ar-
terial catheter for enhanced titration of antihypertensive 
drugs. Bilateral supraorbital and occipital nerve blocks are 
performed to augment the local anesthetic used to inﬁ l-
trate the incision sites. Draping should be performed to al-
low visual access to the patient’s face, arms, and legs while 
maintaining a sterile surgical site.

 The x-, y-, and z- coordinates are set and the entry points 
and the midline are marked on the skin. The stereotactic arc 
is used to mark precisely the incision and the bur hole site 
as determined by the software-based trajectory planning. 
Straight AP incisions are often used. In patient with very 
thin scalps, a small miniﬂ ap can be considered to reduce 
the risk of eventual device erosion. A bur hole is made with 
a 14 mm diameter drill bit. The inner rim of the bur hole 
can limit axial translational movements of the cannula if 
the hole is drilled perpendicularly to the skull surface. The 
hoe is therefore drilled coaxial to the trajectory. It is worth-
while to start implantation on the side contralateral to the 
patient’s worst symptoms in case the patient does not tol-
erate a bilateral procedure. The dura mater, arachnoid, and 
pia mater of the exposed brain are coagulated and opened 
in a cruciate fashion, to allow visualization of any cortical 
surface vessels. Just before the bur hole is drilled, sedation 
is withdrawn to allow the patient to become fully conscious 
for microelectrode recording. The cannula is inserted for 
microelectrode recording to a predetermined dorsal offset 
to the chosen anatomical targeting. Gelfoam or ﬁ brin glue 
is placed around the cannula in the bur hole to provide a 
seal and minimize cerebrospinal ﬂ uid loss, pneumocepha-
lus, and subsequent brain shift that may affect the accuracy 
of the anatomical targeting. 
 Physiological Target Localization 
 A hydraulic or electrical microdrive is used to advance a 
microelectrode in submillimetric steps. FDA-approved mi-
croelectrodes are commercially available and are made of 
tungsten or platinum/iridium. Their impedance is generally 
in the 0.3 to 1.0 MΩ range to allow single unit neural activity 
to be resolved and to retain the ability to detect background 
group neuronal activities such as multi-unit activity (MUA) 
and local ﬁ eld potentials (LFPs). We start MER 15 mm above 
the anatomic target. Typical structures encountered in a 
MER STN pass include the thalamus, the ZI/Fields of Forel, 
the STN, and the SNr  ( Fig. 29.7 ) . 
 Figure 29.8   shows representative neuronal recordings. 
The thalamus is typically the initial structure encountered. 
The speciﬁ c thalamic nuclei recorded depends on the AP 
angle of approach but typically include the nucleus reticu-
laris, the ventralis oralis anterior, and the ventralis oralis 
posterior. There are two typical cell activities: bursting units 
(interburst frequency 15+/−19 Hz) and irregular tonic ﬁ ring 
(about 28 Hz) cells. The background activity is substantially 
less dense than that of the STN. After exiting the thalamus, a 
decrease of background activity coupled with the resolution 
of generally fewer ﬁ ring units indicate that the ZI/Fields of 
Forel have been penetrated. Activity here has a similar bi-
modal distribution of bursting and tonic ﬁ ring units usually 
with low ﬁ ring rates. A substantial increase in background 
neuronal activity heralds the entry into the STN. This in-
crease, perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of 
the STN compared with the other structures encountered 
in this procedure, can precede the resolution of single-unit 
activity indicative of the STN by 1–2 mm. Mean ﬁ ring rates 
have been reported in the 34- to 47-Hz range, with standard 
deviations in the 25 Hz range. Bursting units are common. 
Cells that respond to passive movement of the limbs are 
encountered in the dorsolateral part of the STN. Within this 
motor area, lower extremity-related units tend to be more 
medial than upper extremity-related units. An abrupt de-

crease in background noise is indicative of exiting the STN 
and entry into the SNr. The gap between STN and SNr can 
vary from a few hundred microns to 3 mm. In general the 
features that distinguish SNr from STN include higher ﬁ ring 
rates (50–70 Hz), paucity of kinesthetic-responsive units, 
and a more tonic/less irregular (fewer bursting units) ﬁ ring 
pattern. 
 Although MER can be done with multiple electrodes in a 
parallel fashion, we choose to use single electrodes in a se-
rial fashion, so that only one signal needs to be interpreted 
at a given time. Furthermore, a serial strategy may allow for 
fewer passes than a parallel one. The ﬁ rst MER tract uses 
the anatomic target deﬁ ned by the atlas and patient-speciﬁ c 
imaging data. In our practices, a given target/trajectory is 
deemed adequate for ﬁ nal lead localization if the segment 
of STN obtained is 5 mm or thicker and kinesthetic-respon-
sive units are obtained. A second recording track to localize 
the lateral border is of beneﬁ t, because this will delineate 
the anterior and laterally located internal capsule. If the 
MER recorded thickness of the STN is less than 5 mm or if 
kinesthetic-responsive units are not encountered, we elect 
to perform other tracts to deﬁ ne the anterior and lateral 
borders of the nucleus. Such tracts are typically separated 
by 2 mm. The ﬁ nal trajectory is at least 2 mm from these 
border structures. 
 Electrical stimulation through the microelectrode (micro-
stimulation) can be a useful adjunct to MER-based localiza-
tion. Typical parameters are 0–100 μA, pulse trains of 0.2 
to 0.7 ms, 330 Hz. Such levels of stimulation are well below 
the currents delivered by therapeutic DBS electrodes (mA 
range). Evoked paresthesias, focal motor contractures, or 
ipsilateral ocular phenomena may give clues to the relative 
position of the trajectory within the nucleus if the medial 
lemniscus, the corticobulbar/corticospinal tracts, and the 
fascicles of the III nerve, respectively, are stimulated. We 
perform microstimulation at the end of each MER track in

2 mm increments from ventral to dorsal. Because of the 
small currents used, microstimulation cannot guarantee a 
safe position of the DBS electrode and thus cannot supplant 
intraoperative test stimulation with the DBS lead. 
 Electrode Implantation and Fixation 
 The two commercially available electrodes have four con-
tacts of 1.5 mm height and 1.27 mm diameter and differ only 
in the spacing between contacts: 1.5 mm in the 3387 model 
and 0.5 mm in the 3389 model (Medtronic, Minneapolis, 
MN, USA). Contact 0 (the contact at the electrode’s tip) can 
be positioned at the physiologically deﬁ ned ventral border 
of the nucleus and the remaining contacts will span for 10.5 
mm (3387) or 7.5 mm (3389) in the trajectory  ( Fig. 29.9 ) . 
 Test electrical stimulation through the implanted DBS 
electrode (macrostimulation) with clinically therapeutic 
parameters is important to conﬁ rm that the implant site 
will yield good clinical results. Stimulation can be done in a 
bipolar or monopolar fashion using the Medtronic screener 
box. Typical parameters mirror settings used for chronic 
stimulation: 1–5 V, 90 ms pule width (PW), 130 Hz. Stimula-
tion effects are noted with respect to therapeutic beneﬁ t and 
side effects. Large differences in threshold between beneﬁ t 
and side effects ensure an acceptable therapeutic range for 
subsequent programming. Effects on tremor, rigidity, and 
bradykinesia are observed. Adverse events at low thresh-
olds (typically lower than 5 V) such as motor phenomena 
(contracture of the face/hand, conjugate ocular deviation, 
or dysarthria), ipsilateral ocular inversion/mydriasis, or 
persistent and uncomfortable paresthesias indicate an elec-
trode position that is too lateral, medial, or posterior than 
optimal. In these circumstances, the electrode may need to 
be repositioned in an appropriate direction at least 2 mm 
away from the initial implant site. Reimplantation of the 
DBS electrode within a radius of 2 mm may result in the DBS 
lead following the previous penetration track. 
 At this time ﬂ uoroscopy can be useful to ensure no change 
in electrode position as the mechanical stereotactic appara-
tus is disassembled around the lead  ( Fig. 29.10 ) . Finally, the 
stylet is removed from the DBS lead and the lead is anchored 
to the skull. We use the Stim-Loc (Medtronic) anchoring 
device, which consists of a bur hole ring that is anchored to 
the skull with two screws at the start of the implantation 
procedure, an inner hinged-gate locking mechanism that 
ﬁ ts around the DBS lead, and a cap  ( Fig. 29.11 ) . The distal 
aspect of the lead is protected by a blind connector and tun-
neled distally to the postauricular region. 
 Postoperative imaging is useful to detect hemorrhage or 
pneumocephalus, and to assess whether the accuracy of the 
implantation CT or MRI can be used for postoperative imag-
ing  ( Fig. 29.12 ) . If CT is used, 1 mm or thinner slices should 
be obtained to maximize spatial information. If MRI is used, 
the manufacturer’s guidelines must be followed strictly to 
avoid permanent thermal brain injury. 
 Pulse Generator Implantation 
 The second stage of the DBS procedure is implantation of 
the implantable pulse generator (IPG, sometimes called the 
neurostimulator) and the extension lead that connects the 
DBS lead to the IPG. Currently, two types of IPGs are avail-
able: single channel (Medtronic Soletra) and dual channel 
(Medtronic Kinetra)  ( Fig. 29.13 ) . This part must take place 
under general anesthesia because the extension leads must 
be tunneled. We perform this stage the following week, al-
lowing patients to recover from the lead implantation proc-
ess before undergoing the stress of general anesthesia. 
 The patient is positioned supine, with the head turned to 
the opposite side of the intended site of IPG implantation. 
Preoperative antibiotics are administered 30 minutes before

incision. A subcutaneous pocket is then created for the IPG 
and is connected to the DBS lead tunneled previously to 
the postauricular region. The most common location for the 
neurostimulator placement is infraclavicular and typically 
marked 2 cm below the clavicle and 4 cm away from the 
midline or 2 cm away from the lateral manubrial border. 
However, certain patients may require placement in other 
locations due to body habitus (very thin patients), age (pedi-
atric patients), a history of surgery in the region, or cosmetic 
preference. In such cases, an abdominal placement is useful. 
In most individuals, it is possible to create a subclavicular 
subcutaneous pocket that is deep enough for hardware im-
plantation. Placement under the pectoralis fascia prevents 
later gravitational migration. In thin patients, it may be nec-
essary to create a submuscular pocket under the pectoralis, 
although extra care must be taken to avoid a postoperative 
hematoma in this heavily vascularized region. Furthermore, 
when implanting the neurostimulator in an area besides the 
subclavicular region, care should be taken to ensure that the 
device does not encroach on any bony prominence such as 
the rib or the iliac crest. 
 A small parietooccipital incision is made to externalize the 
distal end of the previously implanted DBS lead. When ma-
nipulating the DBS lead, sharp instruments or instruments 
with “teeth” should always be avoided. Care should be taken 
to prevent accidental crushing of the wires. Rubber-shod 
instruments can be used, but the surgeon’s ﬁ ngertips may 
be the best instruments to handle the lead. 
 A tunnel is created from the parietal region to the neu-
rostimulator pocket and typically the 51 cm implantable 
extension wire is passed and connected to the distal aspect 
of the DBS lead and neurostimulator header. An alternate 
implantation site such as the abdomen requires the use of a 
longer extension lead. A good position for the connector is 
the postauricular region. When located too medially, it can 
cause pain when sleeping supine and may come in contact 
with the lesser or greater occipital nerves. If located too 
laterally, it may cause discomfort while wearing glasses. A 
low (cervical) position predisposes to lead fractures. The 
IPG is anchored to the fascia with nonabsorbable sutures 
behind which the excess extension lead is coiled. Closure is 
performed in layers after copious irrigation. 
 When using a dual channel (Medtronic Kinetra) IPG, both 
extension leads are passed under the skin on the same side. 
The disadvantages to this system include the greater vol-
ume that may impose a risk of erosion in very thin patients, 
shorter battery life compared with two single channel IPGs, 
and the fact that infection in the IPG pocket would place 
both DBS leads at risk. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Deep Brain Stimulation Programming 
 Each of the four contacts (numbered 0 to 3 from distal to proxi-
mal) can be designated as anode or cathode. Stimulation can 
occur in a monopolar mode, in which one or more of the con-
tacts are cathodes and the IPG case is the anode, or bipolar in 
which one or more of the contacts are anodes and cathodes. 
The most physiologically active contact is the cathode. 
 Several parameters can be manipulated by the clinician: 
voltage (V), current, pulse PW, and rate (R). For devices that 
generate a constant voltage despite variations in local im-
pedance, the amplitude of the current generated by the sys-
tem is determined by the V setting. In general, therapeutic

DBS in the STN ranges from 1.5 to 4 V with a pulse width of 
60 or 90 μs and rate of 130 Hz. Initial programming starts 
about 4 weeks after implantation to allow for edema around 
the DBS lead to subside. PD patients should be initially 
programmed in the off-medication state to easily observe 
the effects of stimulation. We start with single monopolar 
stimulation involving a contact in the dorsal region of the 
STN. For the ﬁ rst session stimulation is set to 1.0V. Anti-Par-
kinsonian medication is then restarted at slightly reduced 
dosage. Stimulation thereafter is gradually increased as 
medication is titrated downward. DBS programming for PD 
patients can have many nuances that are beyond the scope 
of this chapter. 
 Clinical Outcomes and Complications 
 As of 2005, more than 700 articles were published on DBS 
for PD. A meta-analysis of outcomes data for STN DBS for 
PD was published in 2006 in a special supplement of  Move-
ment Disorders . The estimated decreases in absolute UPDRS 
II (activities of daily living) and III (motor) scores after sur-
gery in the stimulation on/medication off state compared

with preoperative medication off state were 50% and 52% 
respectively. Average reduction in L-dopa equivalents fol-
lowing surgery was 55.9%. Average reduction in dyskinesia 
after surgery was 69.1%. Average reduction in daily off peri-
ods was 68.2%. Average improvement in quality of life using 
PDQ-39 was 34.5% ± 15.3%. 
 Complications of STN DBS for PD can be grouped into 
stimulation-independent and stimulation-dependent cat-
egories. Stimulation-independent adverse events include 
hemorrhage and stroke, infection, perioperative confusion, 
and hardware-related complications. Stimulation-depend-
ent adverse events are common and include paresthesias, 
motor contractions, eye deviation, and cognitive and behav-
ioral changes. Side effects are expected at high amplitudes. 
Well-located electrodes produce good clinical improvements 
at low amplitudes with high thresholds for side effects. 
 In a series of 800 DBS electrodes implanted at the Cleve-
land Clinic, the overall incidence of hemorrhagic seen on CT 
after DBS is 2.3% per lead. The rate of clinically signiﬁ cant 
hemorrhagic complications is 0.75% per lead. When a hem-
orrhage is identiﬁ ed, we admit the patient to the intensive 
care unit for rigorous control of the blood pressure and se-
rial neurologic examinations. The incidence of infection in 
our series is 3.1% per segregated unilateral system (DBS lead 
+ extension + single-channel neurostimulator). Infections 
are more common at the IPG implantation site. Mild superﬁ -
cial infections without evidence of signiﬁ cant subcutaneous 
ﬂ uid collection around the neurostimulator may be initially 
treated with antibiotics. However, close follow-up is neces-
sary to prevent extension of the infection and contamina-
tion along the wire system, which can ultimately lead to 
meningitis or cerebritis. Brain involvement is fortunately 
rare. Evidence of infection affecting the DBS leads  (proximal 
or at the level of the DBS lead/extension lead connector) 
should prompt the surgical team to explant the system to 
allow for adequate antimicrobial treatment. 
 Failure of the hardware typically presents with loss of motor 
beneﬁ t. An electronic analysis of the system may show high 
impedances, indicating an opened circuit and breakage of the 
lead or extension wire. Some patients may report shock-like 
sensations near the point of loss of insulation in the lead. X-
rays of the leads and extensions (AP/lateral skull, AP chest) 
may show the site of where the electrode is damaged. How-
ever, lack of radiographic evidence does not rule out hardware 
failure. Any hardware that has eroded through the skin and ex-
posed to air must be presumed contaminated and explanted.

 Pallidal Stimulation for Parkinson Disease 
 Kathryn L . Holloway , Mark S.  Baron,  Eric  Oberlander, and  Heather  Green 
 Patient Selection 
 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered as a treatment 
for Parkinson disease (PD) when medical management is 
no longer successful. PD patients chronically treated with 
levodopa may cycle between periods of dyskinesias and off 
periods when they are bradykinetic. Globus pallidus inter-
nus (GPi) DBS can improve all these symptoms by directly 
reducing the dyskinesias and improving mobility through-
out the day. In addition, GPi stimulation is as effective for 
tremor suppression as thalamic (vim) stimulation. 
 The choice between STN and pallidal stimulation is cur-
rently the subject of debate. Dementia is a relative contrain-
dication for pallidal and STN DBS. Patients with Parkinson 
plus syndromes, such as progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP) and multisystem atrophy (MSA) will not beneﬁ t from 
surgery. Other contraindications to DBS surgery include the 
standard anesthetic and surgical risk factors, with particu-
lar attention to coagulopathies and hypertension, which in-
crease the risk of hemorrhage. There is signiﬁ cant variability 
in the risk of intracranial bleeding, but a rate of 1–3% is 
generally quoted. There is a 1–7% risk of infection. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Objective clinical ratings are useful to assess a patient’s suit-
ability for surgery and postoperative outcome and complica-
tions. These clinical ratings are very useful in the evaluation 
and management of the patient and should not be thought 
of as just research tools. 
 The Uniﬁ ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Part 
III (motor examination) has become the standard, widely ac-
cepted rating scale  for these purposes. This scale is used to 
objectively quantify and compare the severity of Parkinso-
nian features both on and off medications and can be used 
intraoperatively to assess the efﬁ cacy of macrostimulation. 
The extent of levodopa responsiveness predicts the outcome 
of surgery. 
 Focused neuropsychological testing is necessary to evalu-
ate for dementia. Families and patients may not recognize 
developing dementia, so testing is important even when de-
mentia is not suspected. Disturbances in mood must be ad-
equately addressed before surgery because they can greatly 
affect the quality of life and response to surgery. We obtain a 
high-resolution magnetic resonance image (MRI) before the 
surgery to look for any underlying abnormalities. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The night before surgery, patients are told to stop their PD 
medications at midnight so that their symptoms are more 
pronounced during the intraoperative testing. DBS surgery is 
performed with local anesthesia and monitored sedation. We 
administer an antibiotic with gram-negative coverage, such 
as gentamycin, before the Foley catheter is placed, as well as 
vancomycin for gram-positive coverage before making the 
skin incision. A Propofol drip is started, the Foley is inserted, 
and the frame pin sites are injected with a Lidocaine, Mar-
caine, and epinephrine mix. The pins are approximated to the 
skull to minimize roll, pitch, and yaw. The frame and pins are 
placed so that the ring of the Cosman Robert Wells stereotac-
tic apparatus is at or just below the zygomatic arches. This 
ensures that the target area (globus pallidus [GPi] or subtha-
lamic nucleus [STN]) is well within stereotactic space. 
 The pins are placed at the top of the forehead but below 
the maximum circumference of the head to decrease the in-
cidence of frame slipping  ( Fig. 30.1 ) . The anterior-posterior 
commissure (AC-PC) plane is approximately at the level of 
traditional pin placement, just above the brow. The pins can 
create a signiﬁ cant artifact, obscuring visualization of the 
commissures, if using computed tomography (CT) alone for 
targeting. The arc adaptor plate is secured to the head ring, 
followed by attachment of the localizer. 
 The patient can be secured to the CT table with the Ra-
dionics adaptor (Integra Radionics, Burlington, MA), which 
greatly minimizes patient motion. A skin ﬁ ducial can be 
secured to the scalp site before the CT scan to allow the 
planned bur hole site to be identiﬁ ed on the images  ( Fig. 
30.1 ) . In GPi targeting, the bur hole can usually be placed 
about 2.5 cm off midline and thus allow for a trajectory 
entirely within one parasagittal plane. A CT scan is obtained 
in 1mm cuts with no gap, overlap, or gantry angle. Upon 
returning to the operating room, this scan is then compu-
tationally fused to the patient’s preoperative brain MRI in 
the stealth station FrameLink package (Medtronic Naviga-
tion, Louisville, CO), always using the CT as the reference or 
ﬁ rst scan  ( Fig. 30.2 ).  The centers of the localizer posts are 
selected. Once the AC-PC coordinates have been entered

ard Laitenen coordinates (19) for the GPi: 21 lateral, (+) 2 
anterior and (-) 4 below the midcommissural point. 
 After returning from the CT scanner, the patient is secured 
to the operating table using the Mayﬁ eld attachment (In-
tegra Radionics, Burlington, MA). Neck and back pain may 
limit the patient’s ability to tolerate this long procedure. The 
patient is positioned in a semireclining position to allow in-
teraction with the examiner and to optimize visualization of 
the bur holes. We do not raise the head excessively because 
of the risk of air embolism. Once comfortable, the patient is 
placed back on the propofol drip and kept asleep while the 
incisions and bur holes are completed. The head is prepped 
and draped using an Apuzzo drape (Integra Radionics, Bur-
lington, MA) over the frame. The surgical table is brought 
alongside the head, dividing the room into the sterile (head) 
side and the nonsterile examiners (body) side  ( Fig. 30.3 ) . 
 Once draped, the planned bur hole sites are anesthetized 
and the scalp is incised. The bur hole is placed based on 
the operative planning described above. Before attaching 
the stereotactic frame to the patient, the stereotactic arc, 
microdrive (Medtronic) and target base are “set to target” 
by entering the arc coordinates that have been calculated 
by the planning software  ( Fig. 30.4A ) . The length of the DBS 
electrode is set at this point by placing it through the drive 
on the arc and the bottom of the ﬁ rst contact of the DBS is 
set to the target  ( Fig. 30.4C ) . The dura is opened in a stellate 
fashion to allow access to all the exposed cortex. The under-
lying cortex and small veins are cauterized with the bipolar. 
The propofol is stopped as soon as the bur holes are drilled. 
 The stylet and macrocannula are inserted to a site about 
20 mm above the planned target to allow for microelectrode 
recording (MER). The stylet is removed from the macrocan-
nula and is replaced with a reducing tube  ( Fig. 30.4B ) . Next, 
Gelfoam or ﬁ brin glue is placed in the bur hole to decrease 
cerebrospinal ﬂ uid leakage. This minimizes pneumocephaly 
and resultant headache, confusion and potential brain shift. 
Fig. 30.1 The stereotactic head ring (Universal compact head ring 
[UCHR]) (Integra Radionics, Burlington, MA) (B) is placed with the pin 
sites at or below the maximum circumference of the head and at the base 
at or below the zygomatic arches. The arc adaptor (C) is attached to the 
UCHR. This provides the attachment for the localizer (A) and the arc.

 Before initiating microelectrode recording (MER), the 
impedance of the microelectrode should be checked in sa-
line. The best impedance for isolating a restricted number 
of neuronal units and identifying motor responsive cells 
is about 600–1200 KOhms. If the impedance is too low, a 
multi-unit recording will result, and it is therefore more dif-
ﬁ cult to identify motor responsiveness with the background 
noise. If the impedance is too high, it becomes more difﬁ cult 
to capture neuronal responses and electrical interference 
is problematic. The microelectrode is placed through the 
reducing tube while protecting its fragile point inside the 
microcannula. The encoding cable provides depth informa-
tion to the Leadpoint (Medtronic) MER platform and to the 
digital display unit  ( Fig. 30.5 ) .

shows the 5 channel stage en face. The microelectrode

Pallidal Stimulation for Parkinson Disease 191
 We use two physiologic techniques for target conﬁ rmation: 
(1) MER to identify the nuclei and surrounding structures and 
(2) macrostimulation to test for efﬁ cacy and side effects. 
 MER permits the structures traversed by the electrode to 
be delineated by recognizing their characteristic ﬁ ring pat-
terns. As the recording electrode passes in close proximity 
to neurons, the normal electrical discharge activity from 
the cells is transmitted through the electrode and displayed 
as continuous waveforms on an oscilloscope or computer 
monitor and is played on an audio monitor. 
 We begin recording neuronal activity at 20 mm above 
the stereotactic target. Striatal cells are typically ﬁ rst en-
countered at or below this depth. The striatal neurons are 
mainly slow ﬁ ring (lower than 10 Hz) and have a relatively 
long duration action potential. These units are distinctly 
activated with movement of the electrode and quickly de-
crease in ﬁ ring rate once the electrode excursion stops. The 
globus pallidus externa (GPe) activity is characterized by 
mostly higher frequency (about 60 Hz in PD) short-dura-
tion units. Most GPe neurons ﬁ re in a fairly regular fashion, 
interrupted irregularly by brief pauses. A smaller number 
of about 10–15% of GPe neurons ﬁ re in a burst fashion, with 
infrequent spikes between bursts. Border cells (cholinergic 
neurons equivalent to and in some respect continuous with 
the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert) can generally be identiﬁ ed 
in the transition between GPe and GPi. These units ﬁ re at 
low frequency in the 20 Hz range and can be readily distin-
guished by their regular rhythm. The entrance to the GPi is 
marked by a distinct and sharp increase in activity. The GPi 
is generally very dense with irregular and high frequency ac-
tivity (higher than 70 Hz in PD) without the distinct pauses 
of GPe neurons  ( Fig. 30.6 ) . 
Fig. 30.5 The Leadpoint microelectrode recording 
(MER) (A) platform is shown with the MER cable (B) 
in place for recording. For stimulation, the cable (B) is 
unplugged from the Leadpoint (A) and plugged into 
the MacroStim Interface (MSI) (E). The cable from the 
MSI is plugged into the screener (F). This allows the 
microcannula of the microelectrode to be used for 
macrostimulation. The encoder cable (D) links the 
Microdrive on the arc with the digital display unit 
(C) providing easily readable depth information in 
microns.
Fig. 30.6 This illustration shows the track of a mi-
croelectrode through the putamen with a typical 
burst of activity in the recording as the electrode is 
advanced, which then quiets down when stationary. 
The electrode then passes into the globus pallidus 
externus (GPe), characterized by high frequency 
pausers and a smaller number of bursters. The lam-
ina between GPe and GPi is marked by slow, regular 
discharging border cells on an otherwise quiet back-
ground. The entrance to GPi is marked by a promi-
nent increase in activity of cells. The motor territory 
(shown in purple) of the GPi is identiﬁ ed by cell activ-
ity that is altered by passive limb movements. The 
lower border of GPi is readily apparent as discharge 
activity precipitously stops as the electrode passes 
out of the nucleus. Finally, on most penetrations, the 
optic tract is detected as a brief burst of ﬁ ber activity 
in response to ﬂ ashes of light.

192 III 
Movement Disorders
 A substantial number of neurons in the motor territory 
of GPi modulate their ﬁ ring rate in response to movement 
of the extremities. This property can be used to conﬁ rm lo-
calization to the targeted posterolateral motor territory. Be-
cause these neurons are particularly responsive to proximal 
movements on the contralateral side, the examination for 
movement related neurons should emphasize assessment 
of contralateral proximal arm and leg movements. Because 
a neuron may only respond to movement in a speciﬁ c di-
rection, it is important for the examiner to move the joints 
sequentially in multiple planes  ( Fig. 30.5B ) . Often tremor-
related cells can be delineated by their audible rhythm, 
which is synchronous with the patient’s tremor. There 
may be overlap between the distributions of arm- and leg-
related cells  ( Fig. 30.7 ) , but leg cells tend to be more dorsal 
and medial to arm cells. 
 The neuronal activity decreases precipitously as the mi-
croelectrode exits GPi, but border cells may be encountered 
immediately below GPi, particularly with more anterior 
penetrations, which pass into the Nucleus Basalis of Meyn-
ert. In most penetrations passing through the longer central 
extent of GPi, the optic tract can be identiﬁ ed. It is best iden-
tiﬁ ed by turning off the operating room lights and listening 
for an audible modulation of multiunit axonal activity in 
response to brief on/off ﬂ ashes from a ﬂ ashlight directed 
into the patient’s contralateral visual hemiﬁ eld. The MER 
activity is recorded on appropriately scaled grid sheets that 
can be superimposed on transparent parasagittal maps con-
structed from the Schaltenbrand-Wahren Atlas  ( Fig. 30.8 ) . 
 After completing an initial MER tract, the tip of the mi-
croelectrode is withdrawn into the microcannula, which is 
then used for macrostimulation. The microelectrode cable 
is disconnected from the Leadpoint and connected to the 
Fred Haer MacroStim Interface, which is in turn connected 
to the Medtronic’s screener  ( Fig. 30.5 ) . The conﬁ guration is 
set to 0 +, 1 (–), 2 and 3 off. Testing consists of a subselection 
of UPDRS III parameters at 2 mm intervals along each track. 
Rigidity, ﬁ nger tap, open and close of the hand, heeltap, and 
observation of tremor and voice are recorded on a chart. 
Side effects are also noted on the record. The most common 
side effect of stimulation in the GPi region is increased tone 
in the arm or facial contraction caused by stimulation of the 
ﬁ bers of the internal capsule. The optic tract passes beneath 
most of the posterior GPi, so stimulation inferior to the GPi 
can elicit a perception of ﬂ ashing light. At target depth, the 
Fig. 30.7 Upper and lower limb territories of the GPi are overlapping 
as shown in this primate map of the GPi and STN. Green dots and 
red squares denote the location of neurons responding to the passive 
manipulation of the forelimb and hindlimb, respectively.
Fig. 30.8 Transparent Schaltenbrand-Wahren maps 
are overlaid on grid paper in which details of the in-
dividual electrode tracts are recorded. The mapped 
locations of nuclear boundaries, sensorimotor re-
sponses, and surrounding structures, along with 
the clinical response to micro- and macrostimula-
tion, are used to best ﬁ t the position of the elec-
trode tracks. This information is then used to decide 
whether to implant the deep brain stimulator lead or 
pursue another track.

 
30 
Pallidal Stimulation for Parkinson Disease 193
voltage is progressively increased to the screener limit of 
10 V, to discover and record any side effects of stimulation. 
 Figure 30.9   provides a representative sample of MER, mac-
rostimulation, and anatomic data on a patient. 
 A second track is chosen if the ﬁ rst track was not optimal. 
The next track should be at least 2 mm away from the ﬁ rst 
or the electrode will likely traverse into the path created 
by the ﬁ rst tract. These ﬁ ne adjustments to the target can 
be accomplished with an x-y stage or a multilumen stage. 
The multilumen stage of the Medtronic micropositioner is 
a 5 channel device in the shape of a cross, and consists of 
a central channel spaced 2 mm from each of the additional 
channels  ( Fig. 30.4A  inset) . 
 Once a track is identiﬁ ed with an adequate length of GPi, 
containing motor responsive cells, efﬁ cacy is demonstrated 
with macrostimulation, and no side effects at 10 V, the mi-
croelectrode is replaced with the DBS lead using ﬂ uoro-
scopic monitoring. Once the appropriate depth is selected, 
the cannula is withdrawn over the DBS electrode until the 
lead anchoring device clip can be applied and secured to 
the lead while monitoring on ﬂ uoroscopy. The stylet is then 
removed from the DBS lead and the cannulas pulled off over 
the DBS lead. The frame can be rotated away while the lead 
anchoring device cap is applied. The wound is copiously 
irrigated and the excess electrode is either tunneled to a 
separate wound with a straw or coiled within the bur hole 
wound. The wound is then closed and covered. If a second 
side is to be done, we have not found it useful to adjust the 
initial second side target based on the ﬁ rst side results. We 
instead use the initially intended target. 
 Generator Insertion 
 The patient is positioned similar to a VP shunt case, with 
the cranial incision, neck, and chest prepped and draped. 
The incision on the chest is placed lateral to the pocket so 
that future generator replacements do not require cutting 
across the extension. In addition, this orientation provides 
a wound and generator pocket that is facing the surgeon 
rather than tucked up against the head and neck. Care is 
taken to keep the generator at least 2 ﬁ ngerbreadths from 
the shoulder joint so that the generator does not irritate the 
shoulder with internal rotation. The generator is also placed 
one ﬁ ngerbreadth below the clavicle to prevent pain from 
the generator rubbing against the clavicle. If the generator 
is placed beneath more than 2 cm of adipose tissue within 
the pocket, the programmer may not be able to communi-
cate with it. 
 The cranial wound containing the tail of the DBS electrode 
is opened. A site for the connector is chosen. This must be 
secured to the periosteum of the skull to prevent migration 
downward to the neck, which predisposes to lead fracture. 
This site can be placed on top of the head or buried in the 
soft tissue behind the ear. The intracranial electrode must be 
tunneled by passing the electrode through a straw because 
it can fracture under traction. The hardware should be kept 
far enough posterior to the ear to prevent compression by 
the patient’s glasses, which can lead to erosion and discom-
fort. The tunneling device is used to pull the extension up 
from the chest. 
 The insulating boot is slid over the DBS electrode and the 
distal end of the electrode is slipped into the connector of 
the lead extender, taking care to align the contacts behind 
the screw heads. Each screw box must be held tightly be-
tween thumb and foreﬁ nger while the torque wrench is ap-
plied so that the screw box does not turn within the plastic 
casing and cut the electrode ﬁ laments. Once all 4 screws are 
tightened, the insulating boot is slid over the connector and 
secured on either end with a silk tie. The connector is then 
secured to the periosteum with one or two silk stitches. The 
programmer is then covered with a sterile sleeve, placed 
over the generator within the chest pocket, and imped-
ances are checked to ensure all connections are secure. The 
wounds are copiously irrigated and closed. 
Fig. 30.9 The illustrated microelectrode re-
cording-macrostimulation map provides a 
summary of the anatomic and physiologic 
information from a single track. The entrance 
and exit of the electrode from globus pallidus 
externus (GPe) and globus pallidus internus 
(GPi) and location of the optic tract are plotted 
by depth along the x-axis. The depths of neu-
rons responding to passive manipulation of the 
arms and legs are marked as well. The patient’s 
total  Uniﬁ ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale 
subscore (plotted on the y-axis) is recorded 
at baseline and then with macrostimulation 
starting at +4 mm from the targeted bot-
tom of GPi, generally in GPe, and continuing 
downward at 2 mm intervals through GPi to a 
level just above the optic tract. The illustrated 
case showed a progressive response to mac-
rostimulation as the electrode was advanced 
through GPi, with a 70% improvement from 
baseline at the bottom of GPi. The inserted 
Schaltenbrand-Wahren maps (coronal, upper 
left; sagittal, upper right) show the position of 
the electrode as determined by a postopera-
tive scan.

 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 One month after intracranial lead placement, a thorough 
evaluation of the side effects and efﬁ cacy encountered with 
stimulation from each contact is performed. The contact 
that provides the most beneﬁ t for the patient’s symptoms 
is used for stimulation. Although some symptoms may re-
spond quickly to stimulation, there may also be a signiﬁ cant 
delay of hours to day in therapeutic response.

 Pallidal Stimulation for Dystonia 
 Ron L.  Alterman and  Jay L. Shils 
 
 Patient Selection 
 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the globus pallidus inter-
nus (GPi) presently is the surgery of choice for patients with 
disabling, medically resistant primary torsion dystonia. Pa-
tients with early onset dystonia (younger than 26 years), and 
especially those who possess the DYT1 gene mutation, seem 
to beneﬁ t most, although patients with adult onset dystonia 
that is refractory to standard medications and targeted injec-
tions of Botulinum toxin also are candidates for pallidal DBS. 
 Surgeons who wish to perform DBS for dystonia should 
be familiar with the intricacies of diagnosing, classifying, 
and treating this complex disorder, which can result from 
numerous causes. In the United States, pallidal DBS is ap-
proved exclusively for the treatment of primary dystonia. 
There should be neither obvious structural lesions of the 
brain, documented with a recent magnetic resonance im-
age (MRI), nor a history of infectious, toxic, metabolic, 
hypoxic, birth-related, or traumatic brain injuries, any of 
which would point to a diagnosis of secondary, or sympto-
matic, dystonia. Patients who relate an onset of symptoms 
before age 20 or a strong family history of dystonia should 
be tested for the DYT1 gene mutation. Patients with child-
hood onset should also undergo a trial of levodopa therapy 
to diagnose or rule out dopa-responsive dystonia. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Routine preoperative laboratory studies including a complete 
blood count, serum chemistry, protime, type and hold, and 
urinalysis are recommended. Chest radiography and electro-
cardiography should be performed when indicated. Medical 
clearance should be obtained for any patient with signiﬁ cant 
comorbidities. Vitamin E and aspirin should be discontinued 
at least 14 days before the procedure to minimize the risk 
of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Anti-platelet agents and 
warfarin must also be discontinued. Anti-cholinergic medica-
tions, benzodiazepines, and baclofen should be withheld on 
the morning of surgery because these medications may inter-
fere with microelectrode recording (MER). If painful muscu-
lar spasms make awake surgery difﬁ cult, conscious sedation 
with propofol or dexmedetomidine may be necessary. Pro-
phylactic antibiotics are administered intravenously on the 
morning of surgery during frame application so that serum 
levels are therapeutic during the implantation procedure. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The following discussion assumes a familiarity with the ba-
sic operation of contemporary stereotactic head frames. 
 Frame Application 
 Frame application is perhaps the most overlooked step in 
performing functional neurosurgical procedures. Alignment 
of the frame with the patient’s anatomy simpliﬁ es target-
ing adjustments and standardizes the surgical angles of ap-
proach. We use the Leksell Model G Frame (Elekta Instru-
ments, Atlanta, GA, USA) because it is lightweight, easy to 
use, and allows the patient to be positioned as comfortably 
as possible during surgery. The frame is equipped with ear 
bars that minimize sideward tilt and axial rotation, yet per-
mit the sagittal pitch to be adjusted easily  ( Fig. 31.1 ) . 
 The frame is pitched so that the base ring lies roughly 
parallel to the zygoma, the anterior-posterior (AP) angle of 
10.1055/978-1-60406-073-7c031_f001

Fig. 31.1 Application of the head frame. The base of the frame is 
pitched so that it lies roughly parallel to the zygoma, approximating 
the orientation of the intercommissural line. Magnetic resonance im-
aging-compatible quick-ﬁ x pins of lengths that do not extend beyond 
the margins of the localizer are employed. The ear bars are passed 
through the most inferior of the three available holes so that the frame 
is elevated as much as possible relative to the shoulders. The ear bars 
are removed after the frame is ﬁ xed in place. Finally, the curved front 
plate is inverted to keep it out of the patient’s line of sight.

delineate the borders and expanses of speciﬁ c structures 
along the implantation trajectory with a resolution of about 
0.1 mm. 
 The scanning parameters for FSE/IR MRI are given in   Table 
31.1  . These images are sufﬁ cient for performing DBS im-
plants with microelectrode guidance; however, additional 
image sets such as gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, 
and computed tomography (CT) may also be employed. Con-
trast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI assists in the selection of 
safe entry points by highlighting the cortical veins. CT pro-
vides the most geometrically accurate images for ﬁ ducial 
registration. 
 The imaging datasets are transferred via internal network 
or CD-ROM to an independent workstation that is equipped 
with stereotactic targeting software such as Framelink (Sur-
gical Navigation Technologies, Boulder, CO); see   Fig. 31.3 ). 
After the various image sets are fused and the ﬁ ducials are 
registered, the surgeon is prompted to deﬁ ne the anterior 
and posterior commissures (AC and PC, respectively) as 
well as three points in the anatomic midline. The software 
uses these points to reformat the images orthogonal to the 
IC plane. The desired target, which is deﬁ ned relative to 
the commissures, may then be selected from a drop-down 
menu or selected visually with the cursor. 
 Assuming that the frame is applied with minimal roll or 
yaw, one can also calculate the target coordinates without 
stereotactic targeting software. First, the stereotactic coor-
which approximates that of the intercommissural (IC) line. 
So aligned, axial targeting images lie coplanar to the IC plane, 
the standard meridian for targeting deep brain structures. It 
is important to use the ear bar holes that are closest to the 
base ring because this raises the frame relative to the body, 
providing enough clearance between the head and shoul-
ders to accommodate the MRI table adapter. The adapter 
aligns the vertical axis of the stereotactic frame orthogonal 
to the axial scanning plane. Fixation pins of lengths that do 
not extend beyond the margins of the MRI localizing box are 
selected so that the frame can ﬁ t within the tight conﬁ nes 
of the scanner’s head coil. Opposing pins are applied and 
tightened simultaneously to reduce frame rotation. 
 Anatomical Targeting 
 We employ axial and coronal fast spin echo/inversion re-
covery (FSE/IR) MRI for anatomic targeting because the 
images are acquired rapidly (6–9 minutes per scan) and 
provide superior resolution of the commissures and deep 
gray matter  ( Fig. 31.2 ) . This pulse sequence is reported to 
resist magnetic susceptibility artifact, minimizing the risk 
of targeting errors caused by shift of the ﬁ ducials. The thick-
ness of the axial slices (3 mm) required to generate these 
high resolution images increases our initial targeting error 
along the Z-axis (depth), but this is compensated for by the 
intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs), which

IR images are employed to target the globus pallidus internus (GPi). 
The anterior and posterior commissures are readily visible on the axial 
image, as is the posterior-ventral GPi. Visualized on the coronal image, 
the target lies 2–3 mm superior and lateral to the optic tract.

Pallidal Stimulation for Dystonia 197
dinates for the commissures at the midline are derived. The 
coordinates for the midcommissural point (MCP) are then 
calculated as the arithmetic means of the respective coor-
dinates for the commissures. Finally, the coordinates for the 
inferior border of the posterior-ventral-lateral GPi are calcu-
lated relative to the MCP, the target lying 19–21 mm lateral, 
2–3 mm anterior, and 4 mm inferior to this imaginary point. 
As a ﬁ nal check, the calculated target point should be visual-
ized on both axial and coronal FSE/IR images. Our preferred 
target lays 2–3 mm superior-lateral to the optic tract and 
19–21 mm lateral of midline  ( Fig. 31.2 ) . 
 After the target point is selected, the desired trajectory 
is established by selecting an appropriate entry point. Our 
preferred implantation trajectory is demonstrated in   Fig-
ure 31.3  . The AP angle of approach is 60–65 degrees above 
the horizon of the IC plane. Because of the laterality of the 
target, a medial-lateral angle of 0–5 degrees to the vertical 
axis allows one to avoid the lateral ventricle and still employ 
parasagittal trajectories, simplifying the process of mapping 
the intraoperative microelectrode recording data. It is pref-
erable to enter the brain through a gyrus, thereby avoiding 
the sulcal veins. The surgical navigation software provides 
Fig. 31.3 Surgical trajectory for pallidal DBS. The desired trajectory to 
the target is established with the assistance of an independent targeting 
workstation (Stealth TreonPlus with Framelink Software, Surgical Navi-
gation Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA). The anterior-posterior angle of 
approach is 60–65 degrees above the horizon of the intercommissural 
plane and 0–5 degrees lateral of the vertical plane. The brain should be 
entered via a gyrus so that cortical veins are not injured. This trajectory 
allows one to avoid the lateral ventricles while maximizing the expanse 
of globus pallidus internus along the implantation trajectory. The par-
asagittal trajectory is easier to map against the parasagittal sections of 
stereotactic atlases (see Fig. 31.7).

with selecting a safe entry point. 
 To establish anatomically consistent trajectories, it is nec-
essary to know the pitch of the frame relative to the patient’s 
IC line for each case. Because the axial images are obtained 
parallel to the base of the frame, the angle of the IC line rela-
tive to the frame is given by the following equation: 
 Angle of IC line relative to the frame = 
Sin -1 (|ΔZ AC-PC | / IC Distance) 
 where ΔZ AC-PC  represents the difference in the Z coordi-
nates of the anterior and posterior commissures  ( Fig. 31.4 ) . 
This angle is added to the surgical AP angle of approach 
if the frame is pitched anteriorly or subtracted from the 
surgical AP angle if the frame is pitched posteriorly. If both 
commissures are visualized on the same axial image, no 
adjustment is necessary. Of course, surgical navigation soft-
ware performs this calculation automatically and provides 
the correct angles to be set on the frame  ( Fig. 31.3 ) . 
 Patient Positioning and Opening 
 The patient is positioned supine on the operating table, 
which is conﬁ gured as a reclining chair  ( Fig. 31.5 ) . This is 
done both for patient comfort and to elevate the frontal bur 
hole, minimizing cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) losses. Padding is 
placed between the patient’s head and the back of the frame 
for comfort. The systolic blood pressure should be main-
tained at 100–140 mm Hg to minimize the risk of ICH. 
 After prepping and draping, the MRI-derived target co-
ordinates are set on the frame and the operating arc is at-
tached. The predetermined angles of approach are set on 
the frame and a pointer is employed to center the frontal 
incision on the desired trajectory. If targeting has been per-
formed correctly, the entry point will lay just anterior to the 
coronal suture, 2–3 cm lateral to the midline. Lidocaine (1%) 
with epinephrine (1:100,000) is inﬁ ltrated before incision. 
The anesthesiologist may perform a regional scalp block. A 
curvilinear incision is made through the galea. Hemostasis 
is achieved with electrocautery and a self-retaining retrac-
tor is inserted. A 14-mm self-stopping perforator (Codman, 
Inc, Raynham, MA, USA) is employed to create a bur hole, 
which is again centered along the desired trajectory. The

Fig. 31.4 Determining the anterior-posterior angle of approach rela-
tive to the intercommissural plane. If the head frame is not applied 
parallel to the intercommissural plane, one may calculate the pitch 
of the frame relative to this meridian as demonstrated. This angle is 
added to the anterior-posterior angle if the frame is pitched anteri-
orly or subtracted if the frame is pitched posteriorly so that consist-
ent implantation trajectories may be employed. Of, course, targeting 
software performs this calculation automatically.

exposed dura is coagulated and incised in a cruciate fashion. 
The pial surface is gently coagulated and a sharp corticec-
tomy is performed, which allows the blunt guide tube to 
be inserted gently into the brain without displacing it. The 
stylet is removed and the cannula is irrigated to check for 
bleeding. The inner cannula, also known as a reducing tube, 
is inserted. The microelectrode is inserted through the re-
ducing tube and connected to the recording system. All of 
the electrical equipment in the operating room is unplugged 
to minimize 60 Hz interference. 
 Physiological Localization: Microelectrode Recording 
 The ﬁ ner details of MER are beyond the scope of this report. 
In brief, we use MER to reﬁ ne physiologically our initial, an-
atomically selected target and trajectory. Recording trajec-
tories begin within the striatum, 20 mm anterior-superior to 
our presumptive target. The recording electrode is advanced 
with the assistance of a motorized microdrive (FHC, Inc., 
Bowdoinham, ME) and the depth and ﬁ ring characteristics 
of each cell encountered are carefully recorded  ( Fig. 31.6 ) . In 
addition to single units, signiﬁ cant changes in background 
activity are noted, as quiet areas denote passage through 
the white matter laminae separating the nuclei. This is es-
pecially important in dystonia, where the difference in the 
ﬁ ring rates of globus pallidus pars externus (GPe) cells and 
GPi cells is not as great as the differences noted in Parkinson 
disease. Taking account of all these data, one can delineate 
the borders and expanses of each of the encountered struc-
tures with a resolution of about 100 μm. 
 The data from each trajectory are mapped onto scaled 
sagittal sections from the Schaltenbrand-Wahren atlas using 
a “best-ﬁ t” technique  ( Fig. 31.7 ) . Trajectories that are ac-
ceptable for implantation typically include a 3–4 mm span 
of GPe and at least 7 mm of GPi. The presence of GPi cells 
that change their ﬁ ring pattern in response to active or pas-
sive range of motion (kinesthetic cells) conﬁ rm that the tra-
jectory passes through the sensorimotor subregion of GPi, 
which lies posterior-ventrally in the nucleus. Exit from the 
GPi is marked by a sharp drop-off in the background activity. 
Approximately 2–3 mm ventral to this, one may encounter 
the optic tract (OT), which exhibits background activity that 
sounds something like a soft waterfall. The room is dark-
ened and one can hear a distinct ﬂ urry of neural activity in 
response to passing a ﬂ ashlight before the patient’s eyes. 
The OT is small and positioned inferior to the posterolateral 
GPi. Therefore, identifying the OT conﬁ rms that the surgical 
trajectory lies laterally within the GPi and exits the nucleus 
inferiorly, not posteriorly into the internal capsule. Identiﬁ -
cation of the OT provides an additional level of conﬁ dence

single-unit recordings from (A) the GPe and (B) GPI in a patient with 
generalized dystonia. Cells within the GPe ﬁ re at a slower rate than do 
cells of the GPi, though the differences are not as great as those seen 
in Parkinson disease. GPe cells will also exhibit brief bursts of activity as 
compared with the steadier though still irregular ﬁ ring of the GPi. (Im-

that the lead will be well positioned, but this should not be 
viewed as an absolute requirement for implantation, as the 
OT may not be detected in many cases. 
 Microelectrode Recording with Sedation 
 Ideally, DBS lead implants are performed with the patient 
awake; however, this may not be possible for patients (es-
pecially children) with generalized dystonia. The abnormal 
postures, cramping, and twisting, repetitive movements 
that characterize dystonia make lying still during these long 
procedures virtually impossible. In the past, we have em-
ployed low dose infusions of propofol (20–25 μg/kg/min) to 
perform DBS when patients could not tolerate being awake. 
Unfortunately, we have found that even at these low doses, 
propofol can signiﬁ cantly degrade the quality of the re-
corded signals. 
 Consequently, we have switched to dexmedetomidine for 
sedation during DBS surgery. Like propofol, dexmedetomi-
dine is rapidly eliminated from the body and may be ti-
trated to achieve desired levels of conscious sedation; how-
ever, dexmedetomidine does not affect single unit activity 
as severely as propofol, making it an excellent alternative 
for conscious sedation during microelectrode-guided DBS 
surgery. Typically, we sedate the patient during the open-
ing and stop the infusion once the bur hole is drilled. This 
allows the patient to regain consciousness slowly during 
MER so that he or she is awake and cooperative during test 
stimulation. 
 Lead Implantation and Test Stimulation 
 The DBS lead (Model 3387, Medtronic, Inc.;   Fig. 31.8 ) is in-
serted along the desired trajectory leaving the deepest con-
tact (contact 0) at the physiologically deﬁ ned inferior border 
of the GPi  ( Fig. 31.9 ) . The microdrive is equipped with inner 
and outer guide tubes, the inner reducing tube accommo-
dates the microelectrode while the outer accommodates 
the DBS lead. This design permits implantation of the DBS 
lead immediately after the desired target is physiologically 
identiﬁ ed without additional brain penetrations, decreasing 
the risk of hemorrhage and improving operative efﬁ ciency. 
 At the completion of MER, the recording electrode and 
reducing tube are withdrawn, leaving the outer guide tube 
in position for lead insertion. The extension arm is attached 
to the microdrive and the stop is secured to the lead 375 mm 
from the inferior margin of contact zero. Circle and cross-
hair reticules are attached to the frame and the C-arm ﬂ uor-
oscopy unit and operating table are manipulated to generate 
pure lateral radiographs that are centered on the target  ( Fig. 
31.10 ) . This image of the desired lead position is transferred 
to a second ﬂ uoroscopy screen so that subsequent images 
can be compared with it during the lead ﬁ xation process. 
 Before it is locked in position, the lead is used to test the 
effects of stimulation. Testing is performed in bipolar con-
ﬁ guration employing the following parameters: pulse width, 
60 μsec; frequency, 130 Hz; amplitude, 0–4 V. Stimulation 
amplitudes greater than 4 V are not used as we have never 
required these for therapy. The initial test is performed with 
the deepest pair of contacts (0–, 1+) because these are most 
likely to generate adverse effects (AEs). If no AEs are ob-
served, testing continues in a ventral to dorsal sequence (1–, 
2+; 2–, 3+; 3–, 2+). Unlike Parkinson disease, the response 
of dystonia to stimulation may not be apparent for days 
to weeks. Therefore, a lack of improvement in response to 
intraoperative stimulation should not be viewed as an indi-
cator of poor lead placement. Rather, one must be conﬁ dent 
that if the MER data are consistent with good placement and

model 3387 lead (bottom) is equipped with four, 1.5 mm long con-
tacts with an interelectrode spacing of 1.5 mm. The contacts are num-
bered consecutively from 0 to 3 beginning at the electrode tip. The 
lead is secured with the bur hole cap, which comprises a collar (top 
right) and a siliconized rubber plug (top left). The collar ﬁ ts snugly 
within a 14 mm bur hole. It is an incomplete ring, so it may be inserted 
with the insertion cannula in place. The lead is held within either of the 
two grooves by the rubber plug.

Fig. 31.9 Preferred lead position. A schematic representation of desir-
able lead position is demonstrated. Our goal is to position the DBS 
lead within the sensorimotor subregion of the globus pallidus inter-
nus (GPi), 20 mm lateral of midline. The deepest contact (contact 
0) is positioned at the inferior border of the GPi, which is delineated 
by microelectrode recording. A span of 7 mm or more of GPi allows 
three stimulating contacts (black rectangles) to be placed within the 
nucleus. Typically, contact 1 (the second deepest contact) is employed 
for therapy.

 
31 
Pallidal Stimulation for Dystonia 201
there are no AEs with up to 4 V of stimulation, the lead is 
positioned well. 
 Sustained time- and voltage-locked contractions of the 
contralateral hemibody or face indicate that stimulation is 
activating the ﬁ bers of the internal capsule, in which case 
the lead is placed too medially or posteriorly. The induction 
of phosphenes in the contralateral visual ﬁ eld suggests that 
the lead is too deep. Stimulation within the sensorimotor 
GPi may induce transient paresthesiae; however, sustained 
paresthesiae at low stimulation amplitudes indicate that 
the lead is positioned very posterior, and is activating tha-
lamocortical projections in the posterior limb of the internal 
capsule. 
 If any of these AEs occur, the lead position should be ad-
justed accordingly; however, one must keep in mind that 
CSF and edema ﬂ uid within previously made tracts can cre-
ate current sinks that will cause AEs to persist despite an 
appropriate positioning adjustment. Therefore, when we are 
conﬁ dent in our microelectrode localization, but are elicit-
ing an AE with stimulation, we will move the lead 2 mm in 
the appropriate direction, but no more. As the brain heals, 
the current leak will seal and the AE will abate. We have had 
to adjust lead position based on intraoperative test stimula-
tion only once. 
 Lead Fixation 
 A variety of lead ﬁ xation methods have been developed 
in response to difﬁ culties that some surgeons have expe-
rienced with the Medtronic, Inc. bur hole cap. Orthopedic 
cement alone is a poor ﬁ xation method because the cement 
does not bond with the lead but merely creates a channel 
through which the lead can slide easily. The Navigus TM lead 
holder (IGN, Inc., Melbourne, FL, USA) reliably ﬁ xes the DBS 
lead in place; however, it must be purchased separately, 
increasing procedure costs. 
 We have found that, when used in conjunction with C-
arm ﬂ uoroscopy, the Medtronic bur hole cap provides reli-
able ﬁ xation at no additional cost. The outer collar of the 
cap is an incomplete circle, allowing it to be inserted into 
the bur hole with the insertion cannula in place  ( Fig. 31.8 ) . 
The lead is then ﬁ xed in position by performing the follow-
ing steps:  
 1. Remove the lead’s wire stylet.  
 2. Grasp the insertion cannula with a mosquito clamp and 
slowly back it out of the patient’s brain while applying 
downward counter traction on the lead with a toothless 
bayoneted forceps, thereby preventing it from backing 
out with the cannula. Withdraw the cannula until the 
lead can be grasped at the level of the bur hole.  
 3. Loosen the stop. With the stylet removed, the combined 
resistance of the cannula and brain will prevent the lead 
from moving.  
 4. Grasp the lead between thumb and foreﬁ nger at the bur 
hole and, while simultaneously pulling a small length of 
slack through the cannula with the toothless bayonet, 
push the lead into one of the notches in the bur hole col-
lar  ( Fig. 31.8 ) .  
 Fluoroscopy is repeated after each step and lead position 
is adjusted if necessary. At this point, we prefer to have the 
deepest contact positioned 1–2 mm (the length of one con-
tact) superior to its desired depth because the ﬁ nal maneu-
ver of inserting the siliconized rubber plug will advance 
the lead this distance. The plug is inserted  ( Fig. 31.11 ) , and 
the ﬁ nal lead position is documented radiographically. The 
excess length of lead is then pulled through the cannula as

operating bed are manipulated to generate pure lateral radiographs

lead has traveled straight to the desired target. Serial radiographs are 
then taken to check for lead advancement or withdrawal during the 
ﬁ xation process (see text for details).

scopically, the lead is ﬁ xed in position with the siliconized rubber plug. 
One can expect 1–2 mm of downward movement of the lead when

it is wrapped around the bur hole cap beneath the scalp. The 
operating arc is removed. The incision is irrigated with baci-
tracin saline and closed in anatomical layers. After applying 
the dressing and removing the head frame, the patient is 
taken for postoperative MRI  ( Fig. 31.12 ) . 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Patients spend the ﬁ rst postoperative night in a carefully 
monitored setting. The blood pressure is maintained at 
100–140 mm Hg to prevent hemorrhage. If the postopera-
tive MRI reveals no hemorrhage and the patient is neuro-
logically intact, a normal diet is provided. Medications are 
resumed at preoperative doses. Intravenous antibiotics are 
continued for 24 hours. Mild narcotics are given for pain if 
necessary. Most patients are discharged to home on the ﬁ rst 
postoperative day. 
 Implantation of the Pulse Generators 
 The remainder of the DBS system is implanted 10–14 days 
after the lead is implanted. This is an ambulatory proce-
dure that is performed under general anesthesia. The pa-
tient is positioned supine with the head resting on a donut 
 ( Fig. 31.13 ) . A roll may be placed beneath the ipsilateral

stage of the device implantation is performed under general anesthe-

is placed within a subcutaneous pocket via the subclavicular incision. 
The extension is passed sequentially from the subclavicular incision 
to the postauricular incision and then the cranial incision, where it is 
connected to the deep brain stimulator lead.

scapula to extend the neck, providing a straighter trajectory 
for passing the extension cable. Intravenous antibiotics are 
again employed to reduce the risk of infection. 
 A 6–7 cm incision is made 2–3 cm inferior and parallel to 
the clavicle. Blunt dissection and Bovie cautery are employed 
to create a subcutaneous pocket just superﬁ cial to the pecto-
ralis fascia. Sponges soaked with bacitracin saline are placed 
within the pocket. Next, a small incision is made behind the 
ear, just cephalad to the nuchal line. Finally, the cranial inci-
sion is reopened and the free end of the DBS lead is identi-
ﬁ ed. The extension cable is passed subcutaneously from the 
chest incision to the cranial incision employing the passer 
that is provided with the extension cable. A protective sleeve 
is slid onto the lead and the end of the lead is inserted into 
the proximal end of the extension cable. The contacts must 
be dry and clean of all blood before they are inserted into the 
connector. Failure to do this risks creating a short within the 
circuit or having the lead become cemented in place when 
the blood dries. The connection is secured by tightening the 
set screws. The hexagonal torque wrench provided with 
the extension cable prevents overtightening of the screws. 
The sleeve is then slid over the connection. To prevent ﬂ uid 
from entering the connection, 2–0 silk ties are placed around 
the protective sleeve above and below the connection  ( Fig. 
31.14 ) . We have found that placing the connection between 
the lead and the extension cable under the galea, just lateral 
to the cranial incision, signiﬁ cantly reduces the incidence of 
lead fracture and wound erosion, both of which have been 
noted with placement of this connection near the nuchal 
line or over the parietal boss. The caudal end of the exten-
sion is connected to the pulse generator and the set screws 
are tightened  ( Fig. 31.15 ) . The bacitracin-soaked sponges are 
removed from the subcutaneous pocket and the generator is 
inserted, with the print facing superﬁ cially. The incisions are 
irrigated generously and closed in anatomical layers. 
 One may use two, 4-channel stimulators (Soletra TM , 
Medtronic, Inc.) or one, 8-channel device (Kinetra TM , 
Medtronic, Inc.) for patients who require bilateral therapy. 
The generators are activated 1 week after implantation. 
 Potential Complications 
 The most serious potential complication of DBS surgery is 
ICH, which is reported to occur in 1–2% of implants in most 
large series. Permanent neurologic deﬁ cit secondary to ve-
nous infarction has also been described, highlighting the 
importance of selecting entry points that avoid sulci and 
cortical veins. Device infection and wound breakdown are 
the most common difﬁ culties associated with DBS surgery; 
these occur in 5% of implants in our experience. Infected 
components should be removed and the patient treated 
with intravenous antibiotics for 4–6 weeks. It is our prac-
tice not to implant patients again for at least 1 month after 
the completion of antibiotic therapy to ensure the infection 
does not recur. Dystonia patients may suffer a higher inci-
dence of extension or lead fracture than other DBS patients; 
therefore, it is of utmost importance to protect the lead, 
which is frailer, more difﬁ cult, and riskier to replace than 
the extension cable. Bilateral lead implantations during one 
operating room session may increase the risk of postopera-
tive confusion, although we have not observed this compli-
cation in the primary dystonia population.

ﬁ cacy. The free end of the lead must be clean of blood and dry before 
it is inserted into the extension. The plastic booty is slid over the con-
nection and a watertight seal is created by the 2–0 Silk ties. The clear 
booty is preferred because it allows one to conﬁ rm that no ﬂ uid has 
entered the connection. This connection is placed just lateral to the 
cranial incision. Placement in the mastoid region risks erosion through 
the scalp or fracture of the lead.

 Selective Denervation for Cervical Dystonia 
 Antonio A. F. De Salles,  Dennis Malkasian, and  Alessandra  Gorgulho 
 
 Patient Selection 
 Denervation of the affected muscles (selective ramisec-
tomy) is one surgical option for the treatment of cervical 
dystonia (CD). This procedure was developed and perfected 
by Claude Bertrand and his collaborators. It has the draw-
backs of being irreversible and not directed to the cause of 
the disease. It also limits neck mobility to a certain extent. 
The results are satisfactory, with minimal disﬁ gurement and 
limitation of function. 
 Medical treatment of CD has not been very satisfactory. 
The injection of Botulinum toxin A into the affected muscles 
can provide substantial beneﬁ t, but an immunological reac-
tion to the toxin may preclude continuation of the treat-
ment. The patients who fail medical treatment are candi-
dates for surgical evaluation. 
 Surgical Anatomy 
 The denervation of the musculature that is involved with 
CD requires locating the nerve, innervating numerous cer-
vical muscles. A multitude of denervation combinations of 
various anterior and posterior cervical muscles is necessary. 
Classically, three muscle layers are described: superﬁ cial, 
intermediate, and deep.   Figure 32.1   shows the layers and 
their surgical importance. The superﬁ cial group (or so-
called extrinsic back muscles) is innervated by the anterior 
primary rami. The intermediate and deep groups, referred 
to as the intrinsic back muscles, are innervated by the pos-
terior primary rami. 
 The C-1 spinal nerve is located in the ﬂ oor of the suboc-
cipital triangle. It is inferior to the vertebral artery (VA) after 
exiting below the occiput and above C1 posterior arch. The 
suboccipital nerve comes from the posterior primary ramus. 
This nerve innervates the muscles that make up this trian-
gle. By exploring the portions of the muscles that face the 
centrum of the triangle with a nerve hook, one can locate 
and elevate the branches entering the muscle  ( Fig. 32.2 ) . 
The C-2 spinal nerve, including the greater occipital nerve, 
anterior primary ramus and ganglion, are inferior to the 
inferior oblique and superior to the highest multiﬁ di/rota-
tor complex  ( Fig. 32.3 )  and pass through the arch of C1 and 
Fig. 32.1 During surgery, the rami identiﬁ cation 
will be in the deepest layer represented in panel 
D. The posterior cervical muscles have three lay-
ers. (A) The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius 
are the most superﬁ cial. (B) The upper ﬁ bers of 
the trapezius are reﬂ ected down to demonstrate 
the splenius capitis (SpCp), longissimus capitis 
and a portion of the attachment of the semispi-
nalis capitis (SspCp) at the superior nuchal line. 
(C) The SpCp is bisected and reﬂ ected, exposing 
the SspCp. Below the SspCp lies the suboccipi-
tal triangle and the transversospinal deep layer. 
From the standpoint of anatomical location, 
the SspCp is an intermediate layer. Between 
the SspCp and suboccipital triangle and upper 
multiﬁ di/rotator complex is a plexus of venous 
elements. (D) The suboccipital triangle muscles 
have been removed. The geometric triangle is 
to illustrate the location of the anatomical trian-
gle. Note the location of the vertebral artery in 
the center of the triangle. The intertransversari  
muscles span from one lateral mass to the next 
one. The muscle connecting the C-1 lateral mass 
to the region of the skull just lateral to the oc-
cipital condyle and immediately posterior to the 
internal jugular vein is the rectus capitis lateralis.

sented in   Figure 32.5  , where the innervation of accessory 
nerve is described. 
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The muscles involved in CD vary from patient to patient. 
Thus, during the assessment of the individual patient, the 
affected muscles must be identiﬁ ed by clinical examination 
and electromyography (EMG)  ( Fig. 32.1 and 32.5 ) . Then the 
ﬁ ndings must be conﬁ rmed by nerve blocks; this step is 
important for diagnosis and for an estimation of the surgi-
cal result. 
the lamina of C2. All the other spinal nerves can be found 
exiting the neural foramina  ( Fig. 32.4 ) . 
 To accomplish sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle den-
ervation, the spinal accessory nerve must be identiﬁ ed in 
the posterior cervical triangle  ( Fig. 32.5A ) . The nerve lies 
between the posterior margin of the SCM and the anterior 
edge of the trapezius. Branches to the SCM are identiﬁ ed 
medially to this muscle, 4–5 cm from the mastoid tip  ( Fig. 
32.5B ).  SCM speciﬁ c denervation can be performed after 
conﬁ rmation by electrical stimulation. 
 Figure 32.6   shows the patient position that allows the ap-
proach of the two stages of the operation. The ﬁ rst stage of 
the operation terminates with the dissection and avulsion of 
the rami at C3, C4, C5 and C6 neural foramina as represented

reﬂ ection of the superﬁ cial and intermediate muscles 
reveals the deep layer. The suboccipital triangle and its 
relationship of the C-1 and C-2 (greater occipital nerve 
[GON]) come into view. Both of these spinal nerves exit 
the spinal canal in an exceptional manner. All other cervi-
cal spinal nerves pass through the neural foramina. The 
respective facet in relationship to the spinal nerve is dor-
sal to the dorsal root ganglion and spinal nerve. However, 
for C-1 and C-2 a neural foramen as such does not exist.

lationship to the suboccipital triangle. The suboccipital 
nerve (SON, C-1) is bound by the suboccipital triangle

the superior oblique capitis. The vertebral venous plexus 
has been removed. (B) The suboccipital vertebral venous 
plexus and its relationship to the deep muscle layer are 
demonstrated. This venous plexus, as also seen in Fig.

profuse bleeding. At this moment one needs to be care-
ful not to damage the vertebral artery lying deep to 
the plexus. Key: SspCp: semispinalis capitis, SpCp: sple-

Fig. 32.5 The incision parallel and just at the posterior 
border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), as shown in 
Fig. 32–6, exposes the posterior cervical triangle and 
the spinal accessory nerve. The fascia of this region is 
difﬁ cult and tenacious to dissect. The deep cervical fas-
cia and the prevertebral fascia interdigitate and lami-
nate around the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI). There 
can be numerous anastomoses between the sensory su-
praclavicular branches of the cervical plexus and other 
cervical sensory nerves to the spinal accessory nerve. 
Lymph nodes are also frequently in proximity to the 
nerve. Prior inﬂ ammatory events can cause adhesion

Fig. 32.6 The semisitting position with 15 degree head rotation to the 
side opposite that of the accessory nerve dissection is used when the 
accessory nerve and the dorsal rami of the cervical spinal nerves are to 
be dissected. The incision for the accessory nerve dissection extends 
from the mastoid process to the inferior third of the sternocleidomas-
toid muscle. It runs parallel and 1 cm posterior to the posterior edge 
of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see also Fig. 32.1). An incision in 
the midline from the inion to the C7 spinous process is performed for 
dissection of the dorsal rami.

 
32 
Selective Denervation for Cervical Dystonia 207
 Contraction of the SCM muscle tips the head toward the 
shoulder and rotates the chin to the opposite side. Contrac-
tion of the posterior group of muscles on one side, including 
the splenius capitis and semispinalis capitis muscles, ex-
tends the head with slight rotation to the opposite side and 
tilts the head to the same side. Contraction of the trapezius 
muscle extends and tilts the head to the same side, and 
elevates the ipsilateral scapula. These are muscles that can 
be studied by palpation, EMG, and anesthetic block. Deep 
muscles of the neck such as the rectus capitis posterior ma-
jor, obliquus capitis superior, obliquus capitis inferior, rectus 
capitis posterior minor, levator scapulae, and semispinalis 
and splenius cervicis muscles are also involved in the ex-
tension and lateral ﬂ exion of the neck. These muscles are 
treated as the posterior group of the neck and are dener-
vated surgically by sectioning of the posterior rami of the 
cervical spinal nerves. 
 The combination of contraction of the muscles of the pos-
terior group of the neck and the SCM muscles gives rise to 
different forms of CD. Classic spasmodic torticollis is caused 
by contraction of the SCM muscle on one side and the pos-
terior group on the opposite side. The head is tilted and 
rotated to the side opposite the affected SCM muscle. Bilat-
eral involvement of the posterior group of muscles leads to 
retrocollis. 
 The involvement of these muscles is conﬁ rmed by EMG 
recorded simultaneously from symmetrical muscles. For 
example, the right and left SCM muscles are compared, as 
are the splenius capitis, the semispinalis capitis, and the 
trapezius muscles. The patient is asked to sit and walk, and 
to rotate, ﬂ ex, and extend the neck during the recordings. 
The innervation of these muscles is then blocked by local 
anesthetic injection during the recordings. Some centers are 
currently using multichannel EMG combined with simulta-
neous videotaping (video-EMG). 
 Radiography of the cervical spine in neutral position, ﬂ ex-
ion, and extension is important to rule out instability. Com-
puted tomography of the cervical spine evaluates cranio-
vertebral abnormalities such as os odontoideum and other 
degenerative changes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the 
neck shows the hypertrophied muscles and rules out other 
causes of abnormal neck position.  
 Anesthesia and Monitoring 
 The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. 
Muscle relaxants are used only during induction. Electrical 
stimulation in the region where nerves must be present is 
invaluable for localizing these small rami during the opera-
tion. EMG is performed during the surgical procedure before 
and after denervation to ensure all nerve branches supply-
ing the muscle have been sectioned. Patients operated on 
in the semisitting position have a Doppler monitor and a 
central venous catheter for the detection and aspiration of 
venous air embolism.  
 Electrical Stimulation 
 Electrical stimulation is used to guide dissection and to en-
sure complete denervation. Nerve stimulation is performed 
with a Peacock electrode designed for rhizotomy. It is a uni-
polar electrode connected to a Radionics RFG-3B stimulator. 
The stimulator is set to 3 V, 10 Hz, and 1-millisecondsec 
pulses. Voltage is increased or decreased according to the 
proximity of the nerve being dissected.    
 Operative Procedure  
 Positioning 
 The semisitting position is used when the accessory nerve 
and the posterior rami of the spinal nerves are to be dis-
sected. The prone position is used when only the posterior 
rami of the spinal nerves are to be dissected. The Mayﬁ eld 
three-point ﬁ xation head holder is used in both instances. 
 Figure 32.6   shows the semisitting position. The head is ro-
tated slightly to the side opposite to that of the accessory 
nerve dissection. The chin is maintained at a distance of two 
ﬁ ngers from the manubrium. Draping is placed strategically 
to expose the lateral aspect of the neck and the posterior 
midline. The incisions for the dissection of the accessory 
nerve and the posterior rami of the spinal nerves are shown 
in   Figure 32.6  . When the patient is placed in the prone posi-
tion, the Wilson frame is used. The suboccipital and poste-
rior cervical region is prepared for a midline incision from 
the inion to the spinous process of C7.   
 Sternocleidomastoid and Trapezius Muscle 
Denervation 
 The incision is parallel to the posterior edge of the SCM 
muscle. It extends from the mastoid to the inferior third of 
the muscle  ( Figs. 32.6 and 32.5 ) . A solution of 0.5% Lido-
caine with epinephrine is injected and the incision is carried 
through the subcutaneous tissue and platysma muscle. Care 
must be taken to avoid damage to the great auricular nerve, 
the lesser occipital nerve, and several small branches of the 
cervical plexus that exit from under the SCM muscle. These 
sensory nerves turn around the posterior edge of the SCM 
muscle, about 5 cm below the mastoid process  ( Fig. 32.5 ) . 
 Under magniﬁ cation, blunt and sharp dissection with 
scissors is used to identify the posterior edge of the SCM 
muscle. Deep and cranial to the cervical plexus complex, the 
accessory branch to the trapezius muscle is identiﬁ ed. Elec-
trical stimulation as described above is invaluable at this 
point to distinguish between sensory and motor branches. 
The identiﬁ cation of the accessory nerve is conﬁ rmed by 
the motor response. This branch is followed in the direction 
of the skull base. The dissection leads to a space under the 
SCM muscle where the main trunk of the accessory nerve is 
identiﬁ ed  ( Fig. 32.5 ) . 
 The SCM muscle is isolated, bridged with umbilical tape, 
and sectioned 3 cm below the mastoid process. The internal 
jugular vein, carotid artery, and vagus nerve run deep to, 
and at the anterior edge of, the SCM muscle. These struc-
tures must be avoided during the isolation and sectioning 
of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The distal portion of the 
SCM muscle is reﬂ ected inferiorly. This maneuver exposes 

208 III 
Movement Disorders
a plexus of nerves that are dissected. Thorough stimula-
tion is performed at this point to identify all branches caus-
ing SCM muscle or trapezius muscle contraction. Motor 
branches from C1 and C2 may join this plexus and innervate 
the SCM muscle. The anterior division of the C1 root also 
innervates the throat and must be spared to avoid swallow-
ing problems. Some branches of C2-C3 may be missed even 
after careful intraoperative evaluation with EMG. Therefore, 
some SCM muscle activity may be preserved. However this 
residual activity is usually not associated with abnormal 
movements. 
 It is important to identify all branches penetrating the 
SCM muscle and to stimulate them to ensure complete 
denervation. A recurrent branch or branches between the 
accessory nerve branch to the trapezius muscle and that 
to the SCM muscle may be present. After all branches are 
identiﬁ ed, EMG is performed. If denervation of both the 
SCM and trapezius muscles is desired, the main trunk of the 
accessory nerve is sectioned, the proximal stump is cauter-
ized, and the distal stump is avulsed. The resected branches 
are submitted for pathological examination. Stimulation is 
repeated to ensure no motor response remains. EMG is re-
peated to document SCM and trapezius muscle silence. 
 If only the SCM or the trapezius muscle is to be dener-
vated, the branches causing contraction of the appropriate 
muscle are severed and avulsed. Thorough stimulation and 
EMG are performed after denervation to conﬁ rm complete 
absence of contraction and silence of the denervated mus-
cle. After denervation is complete, hemostasis is achieved 
and the wound is thoroughly irrigated with bacitracin. The 
SCM muscle is reapproximated with 1–0 Vicryl sutures, the 
platysma is closed with 3–0 Vicryl sutures, and 4–0 Dexon 
subcuticular stitches are used to close the skin  
 Posterior Ramisectomy 
 The incision extends from the inion to the C7 spinous proc-
ess. Bertrand and associates advocate lateral extension of 
the incision from the inion toward the mastoid process. This 
provides wide exposure of the C1 and C2 nerves after the 
trapezius and semispinalis muscle insertions are detached 
on the occiput. They also believe that the laterally extended 
incision minimizes retraction and that extensive retrac-
tion may hamper the information obtained by stimulation. 
However, we have found that a vertical incision is simpler 
and sufﬁ ces for exposure and stimulation of all posterior 
branches from C1 to C6. It also allows for preservation of the 
great occipital nerve  ( Figs. 32.2 and 32.3 ) . 
 After the injection of a solution of 0.5% Lidocaine with 
epinephrine, an incision is made through the skin and sub-
cutaneous tissue from the inion to the C7 spinous process. 
The paraspinal muscles are separated and retracted laterally. 
Unilateral or bilateral dissection is performed depending on 
unilateral or bilateral muscle involvement in the torticollis. 
Hemostasis is achieved and the lateral dissection is com-
pleted. The C1 arch is identiﬁ ed and the lateral dissection 
is performed to the paravertebral venous plexus at the C1-
occiput level. Dissection is extended to the intervertebral 
foramina at the levels below C1, including the C5–6 level. 
EMG is performed at this point. Adson cerebellar retractors 
are placed to maintain exposure. The microscope is brought 
into the ﬁ eld. 
 Tedious dissection is performed to expose the VA as it lies 
above the C1 arch. Profuse bleeding may develop from the 
intricate venous plexus surrounding the VA  ( Fig. 32.3B ) ; 
however, the meticulous use of bipolar cauterization and 
microscissor dissection allows exposure of the VA as it 
curves to enter the foramen magnum. The C1 root is identi-
ﬁ ed under the VAy and above the C1 posterior arch  ( Fig. 
32.3 ) . Electrical stimulation with a progressive decrease 
in voltage helps to pinpoint the nerve. Contraction of the 
paravertebral muscles is observed upon C1 stimulation. The 
branching of C1 is observed by lifting the transverse por-
tion of the VA as it lies over the C1 transverse process. The 
posterior division of the nerve is sectioned; a 1 cm length 
of the nerve is resected and sent for pathological examina-
tion. The distal portion is not avulsed to avoid bleeding from 
the paravertebral venous plexus. The proximal and distal 
stumps are cauterized with bipolar cautery. It is important 
to avoid proximal tension on the C1 root during its manipu-
lation. Postoperative dysphagia may develop if the medulla 
is compromised by proximal traction on the C1 root. 
 The microscope is directed to the C1–2 level. Electrical 
stimulation is used to determine the area of dissection. The 
C2 spinal nerve is identiﬁ ed between the posterior arc of C1 
and the lamina of C2. It is usually the largest of the dorsal 
rootlets. It has a sensory branch that constitutes the greater 
occipital nerve  ( Fig. 32.2 ) . This branch must be spared if its 
stimulation does not generate muscle contraction. The branch 
directed to the semispinalis capitis and adjacent muscles is 
resected and avulsed. The distal portion is sent for pathologi-
cal examination. The proximal stump is cauterized. 
 The microscope is directed successively to the lower 
interspaces. The dissection is performed as described above 
for C2. The C3 dorsal branch has several ramiﬁ cations. It is 
advisable to partially unroof the foramen at the C2–3 level 
to ensure all dorsal branches are isolated. When the level 
of branch of C3 is identiﬁ ed, by similarity the dissection at 
the lower levels becomes straightforward. The dissection is 
stopped only when no motor response to electrical stimu-
lation is observed. The C3, C4, C5, and C6 dorsal rami are 
resected, avulsed, and sent in separate containers for patho-
logical examination  ( Fig. 32.4 ) . Hemostasis is achieved. The 
Adson cerebellar retractors are removed. Stimulation and 
EMG are repeated to demonstrate the absence of muscle 
contraction and complete electromyographic silence. The 
paraspinal muscles and fascia are approximated with inter-
rupted 1–0 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissues with 
interrupted 3–0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin with a running 
3–0 nylon suture. 
 Some authors propose hemilaminectomy and dura open-
ing for dissection of C1 and C2 rootlets, aiming to preserve 
the posterior ones. The purpose is to avoid postoperative C2 
territory dysesthesia. The anterior roots are sectioned at the 
C1 and C2 levels. This technique is used only for unilateral 
cervical dystonia, because bilateral anterior rhizotomy at 
these levels may lead to swallowing problems. The space 
between the semispinalis muscles is explored to visualize 
the C3 to C6 posterior branches. Then, the procedure as de-
scribed above is performed. The advantages are preservation 

 
32 
Selective Denervation for Cervical Dystonia 209
of the sensory roots of C2 with avoidance of postoperative 
dysesthesia, decreased blood loss secondary to the dissec-
tion of the venous plexus close to the VA, and reduced risk of 
VA injury. The disadvantages are that hemilaminectomy has 
to be performed, the dura needs to be opened, and there is a 
risk of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid leakage postoperatively.  
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit for over-
night observation. Patients are usually discharged 48–72 
hours after the operation. 
 Physical therapy should be started 72 hours after the 
operation. The patient must be encouraged to force neck 
movements in all directions. Because rotation, extension, 
and ﬂ exion of the neck are mediated by agonists and antag-
onists on both sides of the neck, as well as in the posterior 
and anterior aspects of the neck, regaining a full range of 
neck movement is common even after extensive selective 
denervation.  
 Complications 
 Sectioning of branches of the brachial plexus and denerva-
tion of the diaphragm are possible complications; however, 
because of the meticulous stimulation of the nerves to be 
severed, these complications are unlikely. Sensory deﬁ cits in 
the occipital region and the ipsilateral auricular region are 
more common. This is caused by injury to branches of the 
cervical plexus and to the greater occipital nerve. Dysarthria 
and dysphagia may develop in the immediate postoperative 
period, but should subside in a few days.

 Patient Selection 
 Although the trend in developed countries is to perform 
deep brain stimulation (DBS) rather than lesional neuro-
surgery, there is still a place for lesional techniques in the 
treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia. Unilateral 
pallidotomy is a reasonable option for patients with pre-
dominant unilateral symptoms who do not want to have a 
DBS system implanted or live far from a center that can pro-
gram the stimulators. In addition, unilateral pallidotomy can 
be used for patients in health systems that do not cover pay-
ment for implantation of DBS systems and programming. 
 Patients with PD must fulﬁ ll the clinical diagnostic cri-
teria of the disease  ( Table 33.1 ) . Candidates for surgery 
must show a good response to levodopa (L-DOPA), but be 
disabled by motor ﬂ uctuations or the side effects of medi-
cal treatment, such as psychosis, systemic complications, 
or drug-induced involuntary movements (dyskinesias). The 
ideal candidate is one who is still responsive to L-DOPA, is 
relatively young, able to tolerate the surgery, cognitively 
intact and, because the effects of surgery are predominantly 
contra lateral, shows some asymmetry in motor function. 
Patients should be operated on the side contralateral to their 
most disabling symptoms. Patients with advanced PD who 
are wheelchair- or bed-bound (Hoehn and Yahr Stage V) are 
not good candidates for the surgery. Other exclusion crite-
ria may include patients with secondary Parkinsonism and 
the Parkinson plus syndromes, which are characterized by 
multiple system degeneration and more diffuse pathology 
than idiopathic PD. Patients should be seen by a movement 
disorder specialist who has conﬁ rmed the diagnosis of PD 
and optimized their medical therapy.   
 To be considered for surgery, patients with dystonia must 
have failed medical treatment, including anticholinergic 
drugs, neuroleptics, muscle relaxants, and sedatives. Pa-
tients with cervical dystonia must have failed Botulinum 
toxin injections, either because of a lack of initial beneﬁ t or 
a secondary failure caused by antibody development. Pa-
tients with signiﬁ cant contractures may need to undergo 
additional orthopedic procedures. L-DOPA-responsive dys-
tonia must be ruled out before any surgical procedure is 
attempted in dystonic patients.  
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Patients with PD are evaluated preoperatively in both the 
off medication condition (practically deﬁ ned as 12 hours 
without medication) and in the on medication condition (1 
hour after the usual morning dose of medication). Standard 
Parkinsonian scales can be applied to establish objective 
measures of the disability. Examples are the Hoehn and Yahr 
stages, the Schwab and England disability scale, the Core As-
sessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantation, and the 
UPDRS (Uniﬁ ed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale). 
 Standard scales for patients with generalized and cervical 
dystonia include the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating 
Scale, and the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating 
Scale, respectively. 
 We also perform neuropsychological and psychiatric 
screening of all of patients. 
 We prefer to operate on patients with no medication 
overnight or sedation, to facilitate unaltered microelectrode 
recordings and to obtain direct and immediate feedback 
about the effects of incremental lesions on motor perform-
ance. However, some dystonic young patients or those with 
abnormal posture that precludes frame placement do not 
tolerate the procedure without some degree of sedation or 
muscle relaxation. For patients who are hypertensive during 
surgery (about 150/90), we often use labetalol. The blood 
pressure cuff and intravenous line are always placed in the 
arm that will not be evaluated during surgery (ipsilateral to 
the surgical site).  
 Stereotactic Imaging 
 A stereotactic frame is placed on the skull using a local an-
esthetic (1% Lidocaine) at the pin sites. Patients undergo 
a stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or spiral 
computed tomography (CT), if unable to have an MRI, to 
calculate the coordinates of the anterior and posterior (AC

target. We use a system with parallel microelectrodes 250 
μm apart with separate drivers through a single guide tube. 
The guide tube is inserted to the tip of the brain cannula and 
driven with a manual hydraulic microdrive in submillimeter 
steps. The microelectrodes and all electrical leads are gas 
sterilized before use and assembled under standard sterile 
conditions. The hydraulic microdrive is sterilized by immer-
sion in 2% glutaraldehyde solution (Cidex) for at least 1 hour 
and rinsed well with sterile water. It is screw mounted on a 
custom-built microelectrode adaptor that holds the hydrau-
lic microdrive and the headstage ampliﬁ er. 
 The microelectrodes have exposed tips of 15–40 μm and 
high electrical impedances in the range of 0.2–1.0 MOhm. 
This allows the discrimination of spikes from individual 
neurons. The electrical signal is passed through a pream-
pliﬁ er and sent to an oscilloscope and an audio monitor. 
This permits visualization of the relative size and shape of 
the action potentials, and allows auditory monitoring of the 
neuronal activity. The audio monitor is useful in identifying 
the location of the bottom of the GPi, by noting a striking 
decrease in neural noise as the electrode passes through 
a region populated by active neurons to an area of axons, 
which is generally quiet. In addition, the audio monitor al-
lows rapid evaluation of changes in the ﬁ ring frequency of 
neurons to active and passive joint movements.   
 Intraoperative Monitoring of Neural Function 
 A typical trajectory passing through the target is shown in   Fig-
ure 33.1  . The electrode normally ﬁ rst starts recording neurons 
in the region of the external segment of the globus pallidus 
(GPe) and enters the medial pallidal lamina (white matter), 
which separates the GPe from the GPi. The microelectrode 
trajectory then courses into the GPi,e (the external segment 
of the GPi). The internal pallidal lamina separates the GPi,e 
from the GPi,i (the internal segment of the GPi). This lamina is 
occasionally detected by changes in background neuronal ac-
tivity or the presence of border cells, and is more likely to be 
found in anteriorly located trajectories. The electrode records 
high amplitude and high frequency discharges in the GPi,e as 
well as the GPi,i (see below). Once the electrode passes more 
ventrally beyond the GPi,i there is a decrease in background 
neuronal activity signaling entry into axons. Occasionally, a 
slight but detectable increase in background activity is heard 
as the electrode enters the axons of the OT. 
 Characteristics of Neurons in the Human 
Globus Pallidus 
 When patients were operated under local anesthesia, no 
signiﬁ cant differences were noticed between the neuro-
nal ﬁ ring rate and patterns of activity in dystonia and PD. 
However, dystonic patients who needed sedatives such as 
propofol showed a decreased ﬁ ring rate and long pauses of 
neuronal activity during the recordings. 
 Neurons that populate the GPe and GPi have distinctive 
patterns of ﬁ ring that are useful for localizing the tip of the 
electrode. GPe neurons have two distinct patterns of spon-
taneous ﬁ ring. Some units have a low-frequency discharge 
and PC) commissures. A series of 2 mm thick axial CT or 
3D inversion recovery (IR) and T2 MRI scans are performed 
on a GE Signa 1.5-T unit (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, 
USA). The axial images are imported into a StealthStation 
where planning is performed with FrameLink 4.1 software 
(Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Common anatomi-
cal points are used to superimpose the T2 and IR images. The 
ﬁ ducials of the frame are registered. Coronal and sagittal 
planes are reconstructed from the axial images. The coordi-
nates of the AC and PC commissures are identiﬁ ed and three 
additional points are selected in the midline. The software 
then reformats the images parallel to the AC-PC line and 
orthogonal to the midline, eliminating the pitch, roll, and 
yaw that are present with uneven frame placement. 
 The globus pallidus internus (GPi) is targeted though two 
methods. First, it is visualized in IR and T2 axial images so 
we can obtain a coronal slice that includes the center of the 
nucleus in the anterior-posterior plane. Then we use this 
coronal plane to target the inferior portion of the GPi that is 
adjacent to the lateral border of the optic tract (OT), which 
is often about 19–21 mm from the midline (direct target-
ing). The second method corresponds quite closely to that 
described by Laitinen and his colleagues, where we target a 
point that is 2–3 mm anterior to the midcommissural point 
(MCP), 3–6 mm below the intercommissural line, and 18–21 
mm from the midline (indirect targeting). Our ﬁ nal tentative 
target often takes into account the coordinates obtained with 
these two methods. Children with dystonia have their tar-
gets calculated mostly through the direct method because the 
relationship between the intraparenchymal structures and 
commissural landmarks can vary with the size of the brain. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The patient is taken to the operating room, positioned su-
pine, and the frame is attached to the table with an adaptor. 
We place the patient in reverse Trendelenberg with the legs 
down and the back up so that the head is elevated about 
30 degrees. Intravenous prophylactic antibiotics directed 
at skin ﬂ ora are administered. The frontal scalp is washed, 
shaved, and painted with Betadine (povidone-iodine) solu-
tion. Local anesthetic (1% Xylocaine) is used to inﬁ ltrate the 
scalp in a region 1–2 cm in front of the coronal suture, 2 cm 
from the midline, on the side contralateral to the hemibody 
with the worst motor symptoms. We use a 4-mm skin punch 
followed by a twist drill of the same size to penetrate the in-
ner table of the skull. The dura is opened with a blunt probe. 
We use a twist drill rather than a bur hole to minimize the 
size of the skull opening. We also seal the craniostomy with 
ﬁ brin glue. These measures and careful attention to posi-
tioning are designed to minimize cerebrospinal ﬂ uid out-
ﬂ ow, intracranial air entry, and brain shift.  
 Microelectrodes and Equipment for Intraoperative 
Single Unit Recording 
 After removing the drapes, a brain cannula with a blunt-
tipped stylet is introduced through the cranial opening into 
the parenchyma to a point 10 to 15 mm above the intended

(10–20 Hz) punctuated by rapid bursts (so-called low-fre-
quency burst neurons). Other units discharge with an irreg-
ular pattern at a relatively slow frequency (30–60 Hz), also 
with intervening brief pauses (termed slow-frequency dis-
charge-pause neurons). On the other hand, neurons in the 
GPi ﬁ re on average at a higher frequency (70–90 Hz, rang-
ing from of 20–200 Hz) and normally lack audible pauses. 
These are termed high-frequency discharge neurons. Some 
of these neurons, termed tremor cells  ( Fig. 33.2 ) , discharge 
in a rhythmic fashion in synchrony with peripheral tremor. 
Tremor cells tend to be found in the ventral half of the glo-
bus pallidus. The white matter laminae that separate the 
GPe from GPi and the GPi,e from GPi,i are ﬂ anked by border 
cells that often have wide spikes with a long after-potential. 
Border cells have the unique property of ﬁ ring in a regular 
pattern at rates on the order of 20–40 Hz. 
 As neuronal activity is recorded, the response of neurons 
to active and passive joint movements is tested. This con-
ﬁ rms the identity of the sensorimotor territory of GPi, pro-
vides indications of the somatotopic organization of the glo-
bus pallidus, and gives insight into the function of pallidal 
neurons. Approximately 20–35% of neurons in this region 
respond to passive joint movements.  
 Locating the Optic Tract and Internal Capsule 
 The position of the electrode in the OT is conﬁ rmed by the 
patient reporting stimulation-induced phosphenes in the 
contralateral visual ﬁ eld. The stimulation parameters em-
ployed are a 1 second train of pulses at 300 Hz (each pulse 
width is 100 μs) with a current that varies from 1 to 100 μA 
depending on the proximity of the OT. Patients most often 
report seeing white or yellow sparkles or dots of light in the 
contralateral visual ﬁ eld. A second method of identifying 
the OT is by recording ﬁ eld potentials in the OT axons with 
a strobe light, as shown in  Figure 33.1 . 
 At least two trajectories are required to map out the 
globus pallidus and adjacent eloquent structures. We sys-
tematically search for the internal capsule by moving the 
Fig. 33.1 Physiological data obtained from one trajectory through the 
globus pallidus and optic tract (OT), plotted on the 20 mm sagittal

electrode trajectory in the anterior-posterior direction. The 
internal capsule is identiﬁ ed by its lack of somatodendritic 
action potentials and by stimulation-induced tetanization 
(labeled as M or motor in   Fig. 33.2  ). The laterality is more 
difﬁ cult to assess from recordings alone. In the more lateral 
planes (22 or 24 mm from the midline), there is less GPi, 
more GPe, and the internal capsule is more posterior and 
more likely to contain lower extremity ﬁ bers (because of 
its somatotopic organization). The OT is also most exten-
sive in the anterior-posterior direction in the 22–24 mm 
parasagittal plane. If the plane of the electrode trajectory is 
too medial, no recordings from the GPe are obtained at the 
top of the trajectory and only a small number of the high 
frequency GPi neurons is recorded at the base.

tion methods alone (denoted by the word target in blue) was too close

Movement Disorders
 Lesion Making 
 The steps we take for making lesions are (1) identifying the 
sensorimotor part of the GPi (characterized by the presence 
of movement responsive neurons); (2) identifying the OT; 
and (3) identifying the internal capsule. The lesioning elec-
trodes have a 3 mm long uninsulated thermistor-coupled 
tip with 1 mm of diameter. Lesions are made in stepwise 
increments using radiofrequency thermocoagulation with 
a current generator. Speech, vision, and motor functions are 
closely monitored during lesioning. The tip is placed at the 
target site lying at least 3–4 mm away from the most proxi-
mal borders of the internal capsule and OT as determined 
from physiological mapping  ( Fig. 33.2 ) . 
 We have not found macrostimulation to be sufﬁ ciently 
reliable for routine mapping. For example, 10–15% of our 
patients deny seeing phosphenes with electrical stimula-
tion, even when the electrodes are in close proximity to the 
OT (conﬁ rmed by recording axonal responses to ﬂ ashes of 
light). Such false-negative results may account for some of 
the reported visual ﬁ eld deﬁ cits with pallidotomy using the 
macrostimulation technique alone. Stimulation mapping of 
the corticospinal tract produces muscular contractions that 
do not depend on the patient’s cooperation or verbal re-
sponse and is thus less susceptible to this problem. 
 The initial lesion is made with 60°C for 90 seconds, and 
clinical monitoring is performed to assess any immediate 
effects. A second step at 70°–80°C for 90 seconds is per-
formed again with simultaneous monitoring of the patient, 
and in most cases the lesion is enlarged to the ﬁ nal stage 
of 90°C for 60 seconds. This results in a roughly spherical 
lesion measuring 6–8 mm in diameter on acute postopera-
tive MRI. This corresponds to a volume of 110 to 270 cu mm 
 ( Fig. 33.3 ) . There is an immediate improvement in brady-
kinesia and rigidity with lesion making. The acute onset 
of choreic and dystonic dyskinesias is also often observed

cation of the globus pallidus lesion in a patient with idiopathic Parkinson 
disease in coronal (A), sagittal (B), and horizontal (C) planes. (From Lo-

during lesion making. The mechanism of these dyskinesias 
is unknown, but their occurrence often signals a good thera-
peutic effect. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 None of the more than 120 patients undergoing pallidotomy 
at our center has experienced visual deﬁ cit secondary to 
damage of the OT, which has been the most prevalent un-
wanted side effect in some series. Approximately 20% of our 
patients have developed a transient upper motor neuron 
facial weakness during the ﬁ rst 24 hours after surgery. This 
adverse effect has spontaneously resolved within 10 days as 
the edema in the internal capsule, documented with MRI, 
has cleared. There has been no incidence of surgical mortal-
ity, but there has been a 2% incidence of acute intracerebral 
hematoma requiring craniotomy for evacuation. 
 A correctly done pallidotomy that includes most of the 
motor territory of the GPi has predictable beneﬁ ts. Con-
tralateral rigidity, akinesia, and tremor, as assessed by the 
Uniﬁ ed Parkinson’s Rating Scale, are reduced for at least 5 
years. Contralateral drug-induced dyskinesias should be es-
sentially eliminated. A feature that has shown only minor 
improvement has been off period freezing. Features that 
have shown little or no improvement or indeed in some 
cases worsening have been speech and swallowing. 
 In our series, patients that had generalized dystonia were 
most commonly treated with bilateral pallidal lesions, 
whereas those with hemidystonia had unilateral pallidot-
omy. All patients with cervical dystonia were treated with 
pallidal DBS. As a general trend, patients with primary dys-
tonia, especially DYT1, responded better to pallidal inter-
vention than patients with dystonia secondary to destruc-
tive lesions and neurodegenerative conditions.

 Thalamotomy for Tremor 
 Scott C.  Kutz and  Roy A. E. Bakay 
 
  
 With the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the 
role of lesioning to treat movement disorders has greatly de-
clined in recent years. For patients with tremor predominant 
Parkinson disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), or other types 
of pathologic tremor, however, unilateral thalamotomy re-
mains a viable option. Thalamotomy implies different lesion 
sites to different surgeons, depending on whose nomencla-
ture is used and what the authors think they are lesioning. 
Vim thalamotomy is believed to be the best lesioning pro-
cedure for treating the symptoms of tremor. However, there 
are very few comparative studies and few randomized data 
on which to scientiﬁ cally base clinical practice. As such, we 
present our understanding of the best clinical practice.  
 Patient Selection 
 The medical treatment of tremor has become so sophisti-
cated that patients should be referred to neurologists with 
special expertise in movement disorders. Patients who are 
truly refractive to medication should be evaluated by a team 
of neurologists and neurosurgeons to determine whether 
they are candidates for stereotactic surgery. 
 In PD, akinesia is the most disabling feature of the disease 
and yet is not ameliorated by Vim thalamotomy. The charac-
teristic resting or pill rolling tremor is dramatic, but is usu-
ally not a source of signiﬁ cant disability. The combination 
of resting and action tremors is not uncommon in severely 
affected patients and is more likely to be disabling. At this 
point in the disease process, the other symptoms of PD often 
require treatment and would likely be better treated with 
stimulation or lesioning of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or 
globus pallidus internus (GPi). The best surgical candidates 
for a thalamic procedure have tremor-dominant symptoma-
tology and have failed medical management. Most surgical 
candidates are likely to be offered thalamic DBS because 
of equivalent efﬁ cacy to lesioning with less potential mor-
bidity. Thalamotomy remains an option in the treatment 
of tremor for well-informed patients who decide against 
stimulation, when DBS fails, when the cost of placing and 
periodically replacing a DBS pulse generator is prohibitive, 
or in remote areas where mandatory follow-up for adjusting 
pulse generators is not possible. 
 ET is the most common movement disorder; it affects 
5 to 10 million persons in the United States. Patients who 
are disabled with this type of tremor who do not respond 
to medical therapy are excellent candidates for thalamic 
stimulation or thalamotomy. Intention tremor from sev-
eral etiologies—including multiple sclerosis, stroke, and 
head injury—may respond to thalamotomy, but the beneﬁ t 
in these cases is much less predictable. Surgical success is 
diminished and the risk of complications increased in the 
presence of severe generalized brain atrophy, ataxia, or sig-
niﬁ cant memory or speech abnormalities; involvement of 
the dominant hemisphere may also signiﬁ cantly increase 
the risk of postoperative complications. 
 Patients with dramatic differences in side-to-side tremor 
should be operated in the hemisphere controlling the more 
severely affected side. For those whose asymmetry is less 
marked, we prefer to lesion the dominant hemisphere to 
restore function to the dominant side. Thalamotomy should 
not be performed bilaterally. 
 Successful surgical candidates should be in good general 
health. Special attention should be directed to exclude pa-
tients who have signiﬁ cant cognitive, swallowing, or speech 
difﬁ culties, as these are most likely to result in a postopera-
tive complication. Surgery is most successful for patients 
under the age of 65, but success can be achieved in older 
patients if they are in good health and retain good cognitive 
function.  
 Preoperative Preparation 
 The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. No pre-
operative medicines other than antihypertensives should be 
given. Excessive sedation can blunt neuronal ﬁ ring during 
the microelectrode recording (MER) portion of the proce-
dure. No lines should be placed on the limb contralateral to 
the intended lesion. Prophylactic antibiotics are optional. 
The initial target coordinates for stereotactic procedures 
have always been obtained by image-directed surgical 
methodology. There has been an evolution from standard 
X-ray ﬁ lm, to computed tomography (CT), and ﬁ nally to 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based targeting. The 
combination of computerized three-dimensional target im-
aging techniques with three-dimensional placement tech-
niques brings to stereotactic neurosurgery a high degree of 
precision. Any CT or MRI-compatible stereotactic frame can 
be used, but the functional Cosman-Roberts-Wells™ (Radi-

 
34

ner can then be engaged and multiple coordinates for initial 
and subsequent targeting generated. Alternatively, volumet-
ric images obtained can be reformatted on computer plan-
ning stations where corrections to pitch, yaw, and tilt can 
be made. These planning stations allow target, entry point, 
and trajectory to target to be planned. Many centers now 
use this latter method of targeting exclusively. Trajectories 
can be customized for each patient to avoid sulci and deep 
blood vessels en route to the desired target. Many times, 
the ventricular system may be avoided by choosing a more 
lateral entry point. Proponents of this technique argue that 
penetration of the ventricular system causes increased brain 
shift caused by excess cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) loss and al-
teration of microelectrode trajectory by passing through 
matter of variable densities. Opponents argue that stere-
otactic atlases have been based on rectilinear approaches 
to the deep brain targets. Mapping becomes progressively 
less accurate as the arc angle varies from a true vertical ap-
proach, and potential for target error increases. We prefer 
minimal angulation (1–4 degrees) to allow the most recti-
linear approach possible and avoid the lateral ventricle most 
of the time. 
 The Walker nomenclature of the VL thalamus is less 
detailed than the Hassler terminology. The VL nucleus is 
roughly the equivalent of Hassler’s nucleus ventro-oralis an-
terior (Voa), nucleus ventro-oralis posterior (Vop), and Vim. 
Voa/Vop is considered the best target for control of rigidity 
and Vim is the best target for control of tremor. Because the 
initial target point for many surgeons will vary from Vop to 
Vim, recommended target coordinates may vary from 1 to 
7 mm posterior to the midpoint of the AC-PC line. Similarly, 
the lateral coordinates from the midline vary from 10 to 15 
onics™, Burlington, MA, USA) and the Leksell™ (Elekta™, 
Stockholm, Sweden) frames seem best suited for functional 
stereotactic work. These are rectilinear systems with a semi-
circular arc ﬁ xed around the target, and allow easy transpo-
sition in X, Y, or Z coordinates, permit multiple areas to be 
tested without additional calculations, and minimize the 
need for manipulations of the frame coordinates. 
 The stereotactic frame is placed with the patient seated. 
The frame should be angled so as to be parallel to the can-
thomeatal line. This will frequently allow the CT or MRI scan 
slices parallel to the base frame to lie parallel to the anterior 
commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC line). Ear bars 
are available with both the functional Cosman-Roberts-
Wells and Leksell systems to aid proper frame alignment, 
minimizing tilt and rotation. The frame is secured after inﬁ l-
trating the scalp down to the periosteum with 1% Lidocaine 
hydrochloric acid (HCl) with epinephrine. If a particularly 
long operation is anticipated, a mixture of 1% Lidocaine HCl 
with 0.5% bupivacaine HCl in equal volumes can be used. 
Placing the intubation ring on the front of the frame creates 
additional space for the nose and provides easier airway ac-
cess to the anesthesiologist should it be required. 
 The patient is taken to the CT or MRI scan suite, where 
the head ring is afﬁ xed to the gantry of the scanner. We 
use serial 1.5–2 mm contiguous nonoverlapping contrast-
enhanced volumetric 1.5T MRIs that are performed through 
the entire brain and localizer frame. If the frame has been 
put on precisely, these sections will go through the AC-PC 
line and the exact slice can be determined from a midline 
reconstruction  ( Fig. 34.1 ) . If not, the angle of the gantry can 
be changed based on these reconstructs and the patient 
rescanned. The measurement mode on the CT or MR scan-

mm and the vertical coordinates above the AC-PC line vary 
from 0 to 3 mm. In addition to differences in target point, 
changes in the size of the third ventricle can push the target 
farther laterally and make it appear more anterior. For Vim 
targeting, we measure 4 mm anterior to the PC along the 
intercommissural line to identify the nucleus ventrocaudalis 
(Vc) of the thalamus  ( Fig. 34.2 ) . We prefer to use MER and 
neurologic examination intraoperatively to identify the Vc 
nucleus ﬁ rst, then move anteriorly to the appropriate posi-
tion in Vim for lesioning. It is generally 2–3 mm anterior 
to our Vc target. The lateral distance depends entirely on 
the observed location of the internal capsule on MRI. The 
internal capsule is 10–15 mm lateral to the midline for Vop 
and 16–22 mm for Vim. The lateral coordinate is selected 
as 2 mm from the edge of the internal capsule, and 1.5 mm 
above the AC-PC line. Generally, the target is 15 mm lateral 
to the midline or 11.5 mm + ½ the width of the third ventri-
cle from midline. Once the target coordinates are selected, 
the patient is transported to the operating room. 
 A sterile ﬁ eld must be maintained from the head ring up-
ward, but the patient’s body is best left uncovered and a 
sterile clear plastic drape with Ioban™ and pouches (catalog 
number 6617, 3M™, St. Paul, MN, USA) placed between the 
patient and the sterile ﬁ eld  ( Fig. 34.3 ) . It is very important 
to be able to see the affected side to observe spontaneous 
tremor as well as to test for strength and coordination. The 
anesthesia team should be on the side ipsilateral to the le-
sion. An arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitor-
ing is optional. Short-acting narcotics or low-dose infusions 
of propofol (Diprivan®, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE, USA) 
or dexmedetomidine (Precedex®, Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, 
USA) are administered only if absolutely required for patient 
comfort during opening or closure. All these medications 
will reduce tremor and neuronal ﬁ ring. We have observed 
that neuronal activity appears to be less affected when 
dexmedetomidine is used. Furthermore, tremor and neu-
ronal activity return to baseline more quickly after dexme-
detomidine is discontinued, in comparison to propofol. Once 
electrophysiological recordings are initiated, the anesthe-
siologist must not give any medication without discussion 
with the neurosurgeon. In the operating room setting, even 
the patient who is normally hypotensive may suddenly dem-
onstrate remarkable increased systolic pressures. Mean arte-
rial blood pressure should be kept lower than 90 mm Hg.

 Operative Procedure 
 Preliminary Steps 
 A 3 cm incision is created in coronal direction 1 cm posterior 
to the planned entry point, which is generally just anterior 
to the coronal suture and 1.5–2 cm from the midline. The 
calvarium is penetrated by a 14 mm pneumatic perforator to 
provide an adequate opening. A twist drill frequently does 
not provide sufﬁ cient room for testing of multiple closely 
spaced targets, especially if the skull is thick. After the open-
ing is made, it is advisable to cauterize the exposed arach-
noid and create an opening where the probe will pass. This 
prevents distortion of the brain when an attempt is made to 
pass a blunt instrument through what can be a thickened, 
tough arachnoid surface. 
 The patient’s tremor (at rest and with intention), strength, 
and vocalization should be tested when the patient ﬁ rst en-
ters the operating suite. Retesting should occur periodically 
throughout the preparatory phase and immediately before 
the microelectrode probe is passed.  
 Microelectrode Recording Technique for Physiologic 
Localization of the Target Site 
 Tremor is best treated with a small, precisely placed lesion 
in Vim. There is evidence that Vim receives both vestib-
ulothalamic and cerebellothalamic afferents and projects to 
the primary motor cortex (area 4). Neurons with rhythmic 
5–7 Hz action potentials have been recorded in Vim as well 
as Vop. Both Vop and Voa receive ﬁ bers from the internal 
segment of the globus pallidus, and project to the precen-
tral motor cortex and the supplementary motor cortex. In 

220 III 
Movement Disorders
the past, large lesions were made so that Voa, Vop, and Vim 
were included. With contemporary techniques, Voa does not 
need to be included in the lesion and only increases the risk 
of complications. The highest percentage of neurons exhib-
iting oscillatory tremor related activity in Vim, compared 
with Vop and Voa. Lesions that encompass this area most 
effectively treat tremor. 
 MER techniques are used in conjunction with radiographic 
methods to identify and localize tremor-related cells in the 
arm area of ventral Vim and discriminate the location of 
Vc and the internal capsule. Platinum-iridium glass-coated 
microelectrodes with a tip diameter of 2–4 μm and imped-
ance of 0.5–2 mOhm (at 1000 Hz) are secured in a stainless 
steel carrier tube and held in place protected within the car-
rier tube by a lock screw at the proximal end of the tube on 
the microdrive. The microelectrode carrier tube assembly 
is ﬁ xed to the microdrive head stage, and allows advance-
ment of the microelectrode over a total range of 45–50 mm. 
The microdevice is calibrated to allow the electrode posi-
tion to be monitored in micrometer increments. The head 
stage incorporates a high impedance preampliﬁ er, which 
is connected to standard electrophysiologic equipment for 
ampliﬁ cation, ﬁ ltering, and discrimination of electrophysi-
ologic signals. The recorded single cell (or unit) activity is 
displayed on an oscilloscope and fed into an audio ampliﬁ er 
for aural monitoring of the signal. 
 A stainless steel guide tube with a rigid obturator is passed 
through the brain, stopping in the white matter. The obtura-
tor is then withdrawn and replaced by the microelectrode-
head stage assembly. The carrier tube is inserted through 
the outer guide tube to a depth ~20 –45 mm short of the 
radiographically determined target site in the thalamus. The 
microelectrode is then advanced using the microdrive. The 
exact location of the microelectrode tip can be determined 
from the known position of the end of the guide tube. Sin-
gle units are discriminated throughout the tract. At 0.5–1.0 
mm intervals, neuronal responses to passive manipulation 
and active movement of individual body parts are sought 
and microstimulation is performed a maximum of 40–60 μA 
with trains of symmetric biphasic pulse pairs at a frequency 
of 300 Hz. The patient is instructed to report any change in 
sensation that occurs with microstimulation, describing its 
location, quality, and intensity. At each stimulation site, sen-
sory thresholds are determined by progressively decreasing 
the current intensity until the stimulus no linger elicits a 
sensory response. For each electrode penetration, responses 
to microstimulation, sensory thresholds, spontaneous activ-
ity patterns, and the response of discriminated units to sen-
sorimotor examination are plotted on an atlas of the human 
thalamus  ( Figs. 34.4 and 34.5 ) . 
 If electrophysiological recordings are initiated more than 
30 mm above target, identiﬁ cation of the caudate nucleus 
may be useful to plot the tract on an atlas. The dorsal tha-
lamus is then encountered 15–20 mm above target and is 
characterized by low-amplitude neuronal ﬁ ring, often in 
a 4 Hz bursting pattern. Lateral and ventral boundaries of 
Vim and the anterior border of Vc are determined based on 
microstimulation effects and neuronal response properties. 
The lateral border of the thalamus is adjacent to the inter-
nal capsule where microstimulation results in short-latency 
muscle contractions, which generally involve a small area 
of the contralateral body. The anterior border of the sen-
sory thalamus (Vc) is characterized by low threshold (5–10 
μA), microstimulation-induced paresthesias, and neurons 
with small, well-deﬁ ned receptive ﬁ elds to tactile sensa-
tion in a body area in which the stimulation-induced par-
esthesias occurred. Anterior sites are characterized by a lack 
of microstimulation-induced paresthesias, even at current 
intensities of 60 μA. There is a gradation of cell responses 
to sensorimotor examination as one moves rostrally from 
Vim to Vop and Voa; cells in Vim respond readily to passive 
(somatosensory) manipulation, whereas cells in Vop tend to 
respond more selectively to voluntary movement and less 
to passive (somatosensory) manipulation. Because of the 
somatotopic arrangement of Vim and Vc, penetrations made 
too medial or lateral are characterized by the microstimula-
tion-induced paresthesias or somatosensory responses pre-
dominantly restricted to the face or leg, respectively. The 
ideal location for lesioning is the ventral portion of Vim, 
which is characterized by induced somatosensory responses 
from movement of the contralateral thumb. It is also in this 
location where rhythmic grouped discharges time locked 
to the tremor frequency of the contralateral limbs may be 
identiﬁ ed. No motor responses are observed with micro-  
stimulation. It is important to explore below the target with 
microelectrode recording to ensure placement of the lesion 
at the ventral boundary of the nucleus. Below the thalamus 
is the zona incerta, a region that is predominantly white 
matter. 
 Figure 34.6   illustrates the relative location of the tar-
get site viewed in sagittal, coronal, and horizontal planes. 
High-frequency microstimulation in this area may abolish 
tremor; low-frequency stimulation may actually drive the 
tremor. Paresthesias should not be induced by low-inten-
sity microstimulation. The sites chosen for lesion placement 
should be selected to avoid the internal capsule and the 
anterior border of Vc. 
 Macroelectrode Techniques and Lesion Generation 
 Radiofrequency lesions are performed preferentially over 
those made by direct current because of the ability to shape 
and standardize the lesion. We prefer to use the Radionics™ 
Model RFG-3B (Radionics ™, Burlington, MA, USA)  to gener-
ate lesions. For a lesioning probe, a thermistor electrode is 
strongly preferred. Electrode tips of 1.1–1.6 mm diameter 
with electrode lengths of 3–5 mm are most commonly used. 
The rigid guide tube with an internal diameter that permits 
the passage of both the recording probe and the lesioning 
probe is highly desirable. Such a guide tube must fall short 
of the target so that unwarranted damage does not occur 
and adequate testing can be performed. The guide tube will 
provide some reassurance that the lesioning probe is going 
to the same area that was tested by the recording probe. 
 The same electrode can be used to stimulate and record 
impedances. As soon as the probe is started toward the tar-
get, the impedance monitor can be turned on to immedi-
ately provide a quick check of the circuit continuity. If the 
impedance is off-scale, there is a break in the circuit and 
grounds and connections need to be checked. If the im-

trolateral thalamus. The labeled nuclei are ventro-oralis anterior (Voa), 
ventro-oralis posterior (Vop), ventro-intermedius (Vim), and ventro-cau-
dalis (Vc). The electrode tracts are depicted by the three straight lines 
entering the thalamus from the anterior-dorsal border and proceeding 
in a caudoventral direction. Neurons were isolated using standard elec-
trophysiologic techniques, and the sensory modality and somatotopic 
speciﬁ city were assessed for each neuron. (A) Neuronal responses to 
somatosensory examination are coded by letters depicting the body 
part and the color of the bar along the right side to the electrode tract 
which depicts the sensory modality. Portions of the tract in which tac-
tile responses were found are in green; those with deep proprioceptive 
responses are colored yellow. Body regions are depicted by the letter 
along the right side of the tract: El, elbow; Fa, face; Fi, ﬁ nger; H, hand; L, 
leg; M, mouth; S, shoulder; Th, thumb; UL, upper lip; W, wrist; (B) along 
the left side of the tract, the purple bar depicts the response to micro-
stimulation; the numbers are the thresholds in microamps required to 
elicit a sensory response. In both (A) and (B), the solid red circles denote 
cells with a tremor-related ﬁ ring pattern. The shaded region denotes the 
lesion site. As demonstrated in (A), penetrations through the thalamus 
in this orientation in the parasagittal plane generally proceed through 
the leg area into the arm area. Proximal limb regions are encountered 
before distal limb regions (e.g., shoulder regions are encountered ﬁ rst, 
followed by progressively more distal arm regions). Deep responses are 
found through Vim, giving way to tactile responses as one proceeds 
into Vc. Responses to microstimulation (B) are generally similar to those 
found on somatosensory examination; the thresholds decrease as one 
moves closer toward Vc. (These ﬁ gures were adapted from data col-
lected in collaboration with Dr. Fred Lenz, Department of Neurosurgery, 
The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD.)

complications.

pedance reads 0, there is a short in the cable or electrode. 
Impedance monitoring toward the target can be quite useful 
to demonstrate dramatic changes going from white to gray 
matter, allowing boundary identiﬁ cation. 
 Once the electrode is in the proper place, electrostimula-
tion is a highly useful technique to conﬁ rm that the probe 
has been placed precisely. We do not use the stimulation 
generator on the lesion generator system because voltage-
dependent stimulation is less dependable than constant 
current stimulation. A Grass™ current generator with a 
constant current adapter (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA, 
USA) or the Ojemann™ cortical stimulator (Integra Life-
Sciences Corporation, Plainsboro, NJ, USA) works well for 
this purpose. Stimulation pulses can be used from 2 to 200 
Hz at 1–8 mA for 1 millisecondsec duration. A most useful 
technique is to test at 5 Hz and then switch to 50 Hz. Test-
ing at both low and high frequencies helps decipher mo-
tor from sensory responses when the patient is unable to 
distinguish them. Frequencies at the lower end will cause 
contralateral synchronous motor twitches when the target 
is too near the internal capsule. Macroelectrode stimulation 
that produces this type of motor response at low threshold 
(1–2 mA) strongly suggests that the probe is too close to 
the internal capsule, and a more medial location is advised. 
More tonic motor responses occur at the higher frequencies. 
Sensory responses generally occur at 50–100 Hz and, when 
they occur at a low milliamp range (lower than 1 mA), this 
strongly suggests that the probe is placed too far posteriorly. 
Paresthesias in the contralateral lip or hand (especially the 
thumb) suggest that the optimal lesion site is located just 
anterior to this location, where paresthesias should not be 
elicited until higher than 2 mA stimulation. The two most 
useful responses that indicate correct location are inhibi-
tion of deep tendon reﬂ exes and inhibition of tremor. The 
patient’s tremor in response to stimulation is generally ob-
served at 50 Hz and, if the electrode is in Vim or Vop, can 
be arrested. Macroelectrode stimulation of Voa generally 
increases the amplitude of the tremor of PD, especially at 
low stimulation rates (5 Hz), but at 50 Hz the rate of rapidly 
alternating movements of the arm can be slowed and ocular 
movements can be produced conjugately to the contralat-
eral side. At this frequency, occasionally tremor can be ar-
rested, although this may be secondary to current spread 
into Vop. If macroelectrode stimulation of a target point 
arrests tremor, a lesion in the same site will uniformly result 
in improvement. Contralateral upper and lower extremity 
deep tendon reﬂ exes should be tested repetitively before 
and during stimulation. 
 Once the electrode is believed to be in the proper posi-
tion  ( Fig. 34.7 ) , the lesion is made using an electrode that 
is 1 mm diameter with a 3 mm bare tip. A lesion 3 mm 
in diameter is anticipated. An initial temperature of 42°C 
allows for a potentially reversible lesion. Testing over a 10-
minute period of a patient’s strength, speech, and tremor 
gives an initial assessment of the safety of the lesion. The 
temperature is then raised to 65°C for 60 seconds. Through-

out this time, speech, strength, and tremor need to be care-
fully monitored and continuously evaluated. This is then 
repeated at 70°C and 75°C as tolerated by the patient until 
tremor abates. Tremor frequently resolves after the lesion-
ing probe is placed, but a lesion should still be performed 
as long as there is no neurologic deﬁ cit. Resting tremor can 
be exacerbated by having the patient count backward or 
recite the months of the year backward. Intention tremor 
may be monitored by having the patient draw spirals. A 
suggestion of dysarthria, weakness, or sensory loss should 
result in immediate termination of the lesion. In most cases 
of PD and ET, a 30–60 mm 3  lesion is sufﬁ cient and no further 
lesioning should be performed. A 100–200 mm 3 lesion is 
often required to treat secondary tremor caused by infarct 
or trauma (Holmes tremor). If, after the lesion is completed 
and observed for 10–15 minutes, the tremor returns, the 
temperature can be raised to 80°C for 60 seconds to slightly 
enlarge the lesion. Alternatively, the electrode can be with-
drawn 3–5 mm and a second lesion made at 75°C for 30 
seconds to extend the lesion into the superior aspect of the 
Vim and Vop. If neither strategy is completely successful, 
it is better to terminate the procedure at this point than 
continue to make increasingly larger lesions. 
 Closure 
 After removing the probe, the bur hole is ﬁ lled with Gel-
foam® and covered with a standard titanium bur hole cover. 
A watertight closure of the galea and skin will help prevent 
CSF leakage and infection. The wound is covered for 2 days 
and kept dry until suture or staple removal in 7–10 days.    
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Blood pressure control must be maintained for 12–24 hours 
postoperatively. This involves admission to the intensive 
care unit, with pressure monitoring through the arterial line 
and titration of antihypertensives as necessary. A CT scan 
should be obtained to identify hemorrhage in symptomatic 
patients. The most common postoperative ﬁ nding on CT 
scanning is a target lesion with a small high-contrast center 
and surrounding edema. This represents a protein coagulum 
from the thermal injury to the brain tissue and is frequently 
misdiagnosed as hemorrhage by radiologists. A larger lesion 
consisting of a solid or irregular high-density mass is indica-
tive of hemorrhage. 
 With large lesions, patients may experience a neglect syn-
drome, which generally clears within several weeks. The 
same may occur in the lower extremity, causing balance 
problems. By intervening early with physical therapy, it is 
likely that functional relearning for the side contralateral 
to the thalamotomy can be facilitated. The patient can be 
discharged 2–3 days postoperatively. Follow-up MRI is per-
formed 4–6 weeks postoperatively to conﬁ rm lesion loca-
tion and to evaluate the accuracy of targeting.  
 Complications 
 The true complication rate for thalamotomy in the modern 
era is difﬁ cult to determine because most of the literature 
on thalamotomy reﬂ ects outmoded surgical techniques. Em-
ploying modern techniques, mortality should be less than 
0.5%. The most common source of mortality and severe mor-
bidity is hemorrhage. Hemorrhage may occur immediately 
or be delayed by 1 or 2 days. With current techniques, an 
incorrectly placed lesion should be a rare source for compli-
cations, but collateral damage from too large a lesion is pos-
sible. Major complications result from lesions that are too 
large or are misplaced and include cognitive disturbances, 
paralysis, dysphagia, sensory loss, and speech disturbances. 
The combined complication rate would be anticipated to be 
15–20%, with permanent disability at about 2–4%. The infec-
tion rate is less than 0.5% and seizures occur in the 1% range. 
Hemiballism is rarely seen today, and certainly would be an-
ticipated at less than a 0.1% rate. Recurrence of tremor dur-
ing the ﬁ rst month after surgery is uncommon and suggests 
either too small a lesion or an inappropriately placed lesion. 
In our experience, a second larger or better placed lesion 
will almost always abolish PD or ET tremor permanently. 
Bilateral thalamotomy is no longer recommended, given the 
higher risk of hypophonia and other morbidity than with 
unilateral lesioning or bilateral chronic stimulation.

 Frameless Stereotaxy for Deep Brain Targets 
 Jaimie M. Henderson 
  
 The delivery of therapeutic interventions to deep brain tar-
gets requires highly precise navigational tools. The stereo-
tactic frame was introduced into clinical practice more than 
50 years ago to meet this need, and enabled functional neu-
rosurgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) 
to be developed. With the advent of frameless image-guided 
navigational systems in the past decade, accurate positional 
feedback has become commonplace. For most cranial neu-
rosurgery, image-guided systems have effectively replaced 
stereotactic frames. However, trajectory-based procedures 
such as lesioning or stimulation of the deep nuclei for Par-
kinson disease (PD) and tremor are still widely performed 
with a frame for accuracy and stability. 
 Although frameless systems have been widely perceived 
as providing insufﬁ cient accuracy for true stereotaxy, sev-
eral laboratory studies have demonstrated localization 
accuracies similar to those achievable with a stereotactic 
frame. Preliminary studies have shown the feasibility of 
using a surgical navigation system in conjunction with an 
image-guided microdrive to perform functional neurosurgi-
cal procedures with acceptable accuracy, and a multicenter 
trial demonstrated equivalent accuracy between a stere-
otactic frame system and an image-guided, skull-mounted 
platform. For several reasons, including patient comfort, 
reduced procedure time, and decoupling of imaging from 
surgery, frameless systems are increasingly being used as an 
alternative to frames in stereotactic neurosurgery. 
 Two systems are currently in use for frameless functional 
neurosurgery. Both rely on skull-implanted ﬁ ducials for the 
highest possible accuracy. Each system is designed to attach 
rigidly to the skull, and must maintain absolute rigidity dur-
ing the procedure so that the probe or electrode does not 
deviate from the planned target. 
 The Starﬁ x platform (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME, USA) is a 
custom-fabricated device based on rapid-prototyping tech-
nology. Following ﬁ ducial placement and imaging, custom 
software is used to plan the target-entry trajectory. This 
plan is then submitted to the company, which manufactures 
a high-grade plastic platform that attaches to the implanted 
ﬁ ducial markers. The ﬁ nished custom platform is sent by 
express mail within 24–72 hours. On the day of surgery, the 
platform is attached to the implanted ﬁ ducials after sterile 
preparation, and serves as a trajectory guide. This design 
trades the ﬂ exibility of real-time trajectory adjustment for 
simplicity and absolute rigidity. 
 The NeXframe (Image Guided Neurologics, Melbourne, FL, 
USA) is an adjustable platform that uses a polar alignment 
mechanism. Whereas the Starﬁ x device is custom-manu-
factured to be aligned along only one trajectory, the NeX-
frame requires a separate registration and alignment proce-
dure. This allows for changes in trajectory if the need arises 
during surgery. This device has been extensively tested in 
laboratory and clinical settings, demonstrating equivalent 
accuracy to a stereotactic frame. This chapter will focus on 
the use of the NeXframe for delivery of therapeutic inter-
ventions to deep brain targets.  
 Patient Selection 
 The frameless approach can be used for any patient un-
dergoing stereotactic surgery, although it is particularly 
appropriate for certain subsets of patients. Some patients 
may have very large or very small heads that cannot be 
comfortably accommodated by a frame. Others may have 
severe kyphosis, which precludes magnetic resonance im-
aging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning with a 
frame in place. Most patients are less intimidated by ﬁ ducial 
placement than by frame placement, and the ability to read-
just position during surgery is very helpful for patients with 
back pain or claustrophobia. Staged implantation of DBS 
electrodes may be indicated for patients with mild cognitive 
impairment, advanced age, or frail physical condition. The 
small ﬁ ducial markers can be left in place for up to several 
weeks, sparing patients the need for reapplication of the 
frame and reimaging.  
 Preoperative Preparation  
 System Preparation 
 The ﬁ rst step in preparing to perform frameless functional 
interventions is to verify the image-guided navigational sys-
tem. Studies should be undertaken using a skull phantom 
equipped with a clearly visible internal target  ( Fig. 35.1 ) . 
All instruments should be checked for geometry errors, tak-
ing care to verify accuracy during rotation throughout their 
full range of visibility. Registration and alignment should 
be simulated with the phantom in a position that would

weeks before surgery  ( Fig. 35.5 ) . Both CT and MRI scanning 
are thus decoupled from the physical act of surgery, allow-
ing planning to occur at any time before the procedure and 
eliminating delays on the morning of surgery related to im-
age transfer or difﬁ culties with frame placement. 
 Surgical planning is performed on the image-guided 
workstation in a manner identical to that used with frame-
resemble that of a patient during surgery. A rigid probe with 
absolutely no bend should be used to measure localization 
error  ( Fig. 35.1A ) . Average localization accuracies should 
be in the 1.25 mm range, with a 99.9% conﬁ dence interval 
of about 4 mm. The surgeon must be satisﬁ ed with the ac-
curacy of the system during bench testing before moving to 
clinical use. 
 Patient Preparation 
 Before surgery, ﬁ ducial markers are placed in the outpatient 
clinic. We use a one-piece stainless steel ﬁ ducial marker 
 ( Fig. 35.2 )  that is screwed into the skull via a small stab 
incision  ( Fig. 35.3 )  after sterile preparation and inﬁ ltration 
of local anesthetic. Fiducial placement is generally tolerated 
quite well by the patients, who usually equate the experi-
ence with a visit to the dentist. Five ﬁ ducial markers are 
placed to provide redundancy and to cover as much of the 
cranial volume as possible  ( Fig. 35.4 ) . A battery-powered 
autodriver greatly facilitates placing the self-tapping screws 
and prevents wobbling during insertion, which can lead to 
improper seating of the screws and dislodgement of the 
ﬁ ducials. Properly placed ﬁ ducials do not have mechanical 
deformations that plague stereotactic frame systems, and 
can provide very high levels of accuracy. 
 After the ﬁ ducials are placed, 1 mm thick CT slices are 
obtained, taking care that all ﬁ ducial markers are visible and 
that the entire cranial volume is imaged. These scans are 
then fused with volumetric MRI scans taken several days or

based stereotaxy. Target and entry points are selected, and 
the ﬁ ducials are identiﬁ ed. Care must be taken to locate 
the precise center of the ﬁ ducial marker in all three im-
age planes. A method for ﬁ nding the center of a one-piece 
titanium ﬁ ducial marker (Image Guided Neurologics, Mel-
bourne, FL, USA) is illustrated in  Figure 35.6 . 
 For patients undergoing functional interventions such as 
DBS placement, medications for tremor or PD are discon-
tinued the night before surgery. Preoperative antibiotics are 
routinely given 30 minutes before skin incision.  
 Operative Procedure 
 Most functional neurosurgical interventions are performed 
with minimal sedation to assess neurological function and 
preserve characteristic neuronal physiology. The patient is 
placed initially in a lounge chair position that is adjusted for 
optimal comfort. A noninvasive head holder with a cervical 
collar restraint  ( Fig. 35.7 )  minimizes head movement dur-
ing the initial incision, bur hole placement, and initial align-
ment of the trajectory guide. The collar portion can later 
be removed to allow full range of motion. This decreases 
claustrophobia and allows testing of the cervical muscula-
ture during surgery for cervical dystonia. 
 A C-arm ﬂ uoroscope can be used to verify electrode posi-
tion, and serves as an excellent draping ﬁ xture  ( Fig. 35.8 ) . 
The C-arm is brought in after patient positioning and before 
the initial registration phase. 
 An initial registration is performed using a noninvasive 
reference frame, touching each ﬁ ducial in turn with a non-
sterile probe. Pointing back to the ﬁ ducials can give the 
surgeon a fairly accurate estimate of the expected localiza-
tion error  ( Fig. 35.9 ) . The entry point is then localized with 
the image-guided surgery system and marked with a skin 
scratch. 
 The scalp is prepared using an aqueous antiseptic solu-
tion. A transparent lateral hip drape with Ioban® adhesive 
center is applied to the scalp, taking care to form the drape 
loosely around the posts of the ﬁ ducial markers. Stretching 

 
35 
Frameless Stereotaxy for Deep Brain Targets 229
An attempt should be made to dislodge the platform at this 
point, and if there is any movement, the screws must be 
tightened further. Resistance to screw advancement can of-
ten be remedied by backing the screws out by ½ to 1 turn to 
dislodge any bone chips before further tightening. 
 Once satisﬁ ed with the rigidity of the skull ﬁ xation, the 
surgeon attaches a reference arc to the platform  ( Fig. 35.10 ) . 
The ﬁ ducial markers are once again touched in sequence 
with the registration probe. Several subtle but important 
technical points can improve registration accuracy during 
this step. The registration probe should be aligned parallel to 
the long axis of the ﬁ ducial if possible to allow the tip of the 
probe to penetrate to the bottom of the registration divot. 
The cameras of the surgical navigation system should be 
carefully aligned so that the probe can be seen throughout 
the localization volume. The light-emitting diodes or reﬂ ec-
tive spheres of the probe should be squarely aligned with 
the camera to minimize errors that can be introduced by 
viewing the instruments edge-on. Each instrument should 
be veriﬁ ed before use and the tip position should agree with 
the expected position to within less than 1 mm, and prefer-
ably within 0.5 mm or less. 
 The registration is once again checked by pointing back to 
each ﬁ ducial with the registration probe. Registration errors 
should be less than 0.6 mm; the sphere of predicted 1 mm 
of the drape over the ﬁ ducials can inhibit accurate registra-
tion and predispose to punctures which can lead to breaks in 
sterility. After draping, the planned incision is injected with 
a local anesthetic solution. A small stab incision is made at 
the marked entry point with a #11 blade. A 1 mm twist drill 
is used to make a pilot hole in the outer table of the skull 
which will be used to guide accurate bur hole placement. 
The incision is then opened. A 14 mm bur hole is made using 
a standard automatic-releasing cranial perforator centered 
precisely on the pilot hole. The bur hole is initially made 
perpendicular to the skull, but as the diploe is reached the 
perforator should be angled to direct the bur hole slightly 
lateral. This maneuver reduces interference with the edge of 
the bur hole, which can occur when more lateral electrode 
passes are made. The small shelf of bone left by the perfora-
tor is removed using a rongeur to achieve maximum work-
ing room. The bone edges are waxed and remaining portions 
of the inner table removed with a curette. 
 After hemostasis is achieved, a combination lead anchor/
bur hole cover is placed (Stimloc, IGN, Melbourne, FL). The 
trajectory guide platform (NeXframe, IGN) is then attached 
to the skull with three self-drilling, self-tapping screws. The 
coupling between the platform and the skull must be com-
pletely rigid; otherwise, the platform could move during the 
surgery and displace the introducer cannula or electrode.

accuracy should encompass the entire cranial volume. Sys-
tem accuracy must be veriﬁ ed at each stage of the procedure 
to minimize errors and achieve optimal accuracy. 
 The dura mater is then opened, and a cortical incision 
made with bipolar cautery. Gelatin sponge (Gelfoam®) and 
ﬁ brin glue are placed within the bur hole to minimize loss 
of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) during the alignment procedure. 
Careful attention should be paid to replacing the sealant 
promptly each time bur hole access is needed during the 
procedure, because the more CSF lost, the greater the chance 
for brain shift or pulsatile movement of the brain with sys-
tole which can compromise physiological recordings. 
 The alignment ﬁ xture is placed on the platform and a 
guidance instrument is used to align the device to target 
 ( Fig. 35.11 ) . Software speciﬁ cally designed for trajectory-
based aiming can aid in this task  ( Fig. 35.12 ) . Great care

should once again be exercised to ensure the instrument ge-
ometry is veriﬁ ed and that alignment is performed precisely 
using the highest possible view magniﬁ cation, as small dif-
ferences in trajectory as measured at the skull surface can 
translate into large errors at the target point. The trajectory 
guide is swept back and forth, watching the computer screen 
as this procedure moves the aim point along a line which 
will usually not intersect the target on the ﬁ rst attempt. The 
base of the guide is then rotated, repeating the sweep and 
observing the change in movement of the aim point across 
the target. Eventually, the sweep will bring the aim point 
through the target point, and the locking screws on the base 
can be tightened. This aiming procedure is graphically pre-
sented in  Fig. 35.13 . 
 A 3 mm offset aiming ﬁ xture is provided with the NeX-
frame device, to allow compensation for trajectories which 
may be affected by the bur hole edge or surface features 
such as cortical veins. 
 Once the trajectory guide has been locked into place, a 
distance to target measurement is made using the naviga-
tional system. Unlike frame-based stereotaxy, the conﬁ gu-
ration of each patient’s cranial anatomy will determine the 
target depth, which may vary by as much as 20 mm from 
case to case. 
 At this point, the aiming ﬁ xture is replaced by the multi-
lumen adapter. A microdrive is mounted on the adapter and 
the depth to target is entered into the adjustment scale. The 
use of two individually variable depth adjustments allows a 
standardized microrecording paradigm without recalculat-
ing the microdrive position for each case. The ﬁ brin glue is 
removed from the bur hole and the outer cannula placed 
into the brain. Care must be taken to avoid any deﬂ ection 
from bone or dural edges, and the cannula should be slowly 
introduced, feeling for any resistance to advancement. The 
gelatin sponge and ﬁ brin glue are replaced. The stylet is 
then removed from the outer cannula and replaced by an 
inner cannula, through which a microelectrode may be 
placed. 
 For lesioning or stimulation procedures, electrophysiol-
ogy will usually be performed using either MER or stimu-
lation. Parallel tracks can be made by withdrawing the 
outer cannula and replacing it in one of the four other 
holes in the multilumen adapter. A variety of adapters are 
available to allow parallel trajectories as little as 1 mm or 
as much as 5 mm in any direction from the center of the 
bur hole. 
 Once the target has been deﬁ ned physiologically, the mi-
croelectrode and inner cannula are removed. If DBS is to be 
performed, the DBS electrode is measured to length using a 
cylindrical depth gauge, and a marker stop placed. The elec-
trode is then placed down the outer cannula. The outer can-
nula is withdrawn, and the lead is stabilized with the clip 
system. The cannula, electrode stylet, and NeXframe tower 
components are removed in a stepwise fashion, monitor-
ing electrode position using ﬂ uoroscopy if desired. Finally, 
the electrode is locked in place. If a staged procedure is to 
be performed, a protector is placed over the bare end of 
the lead and the lead is buried beneath the scalp before 
closure.  
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Patients are usually monitored overnight in a mini-intensive 
care unit or stepdown unit. Postoperative CT scans should 
be obtained to verify lead position and evaluate for intra- or 
extra-axial hemorrhage. For patients undergoing functional 
neurosurgical interventions, preoperative medications 
should be immediately restarted in the recovery room. 
 Complications are the same as those experienced with 
any stereotactic procedure, most commonly infection (5–
8%) and hemorrhage (1–2%). Infections can be minimized 
by administering preoperative antibiotics, paying careful at-
tention to sterile technique, and minimizing operating time 
as much as possible. Intracerebral hemorrhage is probably 
unavoidable in a small number of cases, but more superﬁ cial 
hemorrhages can be prevented by designing a trajectory 
which avoids surface vessels, sulci, and the periventricular 
zone. Contrast-enhanced imaging studies can help to iden-
tify and avoid blood vessels.

 Conclusions 
 Frameless techniques offer a viable alternative to stere-
otactic frames for functional neurosurgery and other tra-
jectory-based procedures, with several distinct advantages. 
Foremost among these is patient comfort and cooperation. 
Many patients are extremely apprehensive about frame 
placement, and some have refused to have surgery because 
they fear frame placement. In addition, rigid ﬁ xation of 
the patient to the operating table can restrict mobility. The 
frameless approach allows the patient free movement of the 
head, ability to readjust position, and less claustrophobia 
during the procedure. 
 Because ﬁ ducial markers can be placed 1 or more days be-
fore surgery, imaging and planning can be decoupled from 
the procedure. This can lead to net time savings of several 
hours on the morning of surgery, and allows patients with 
PD and other debilitating disorders to spend less time off 
medication.

 Magnetic Resonance Image-Directed 
Method for Functional Neurosurgery Using 
Implantable Guide Tubes 
 Nikunj K.  Patel , Puneet  Plaha , and Steven S. Gill 
    The success of stereotactic functional surgery depends on 
the accuracy with which an instrument or device can be 
delivered to a small subcortical target. Current methods 
usually employ a combination of anatomical and physiologi-
cal methods. Anatomical methods include direct and indi-
rect techniques. Direct targeting involves speciﬁ c magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) sequences that enable the target 
boundaries to be visualized. The indirect methods are based 
on brain atlases and typically use the anterior commissure 
(AC) and posterior commissure (PC) as internal landmarks 
to coregister the atlas with the patient. 
 It has long been appreciated, however, that there is sub-
stantial individual variation in the AC-PC-based coordinates 
of subcortical nuclei. To compensate for the individual vari-
ations when using the indirect method, many centers have 
developed intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological 
monitoring procedures using microelectrodes or macro-
electrode stimulation of the target sites or both. These pro-
cedures are performed when the patient is awake so that 
functional change can be observed. These techniques are 
constrained by their complexity, expense, potential compli-
cations, and long duration. 
 This chapter describes a direct targeting method using 
high-resolution MRI employing an implantable guide tube 
 ( Fig. 36.1 ) . The method relies on visualization of the deep 
brain nuclei on high-resolution MRIs, which delineate the 
target boundaries, and enables speciﬁ c regions of the nu-
cleus to be directly targeted. The delivery system comprises 
a modiﬁ ed stereoguide that can deliver an implantable 
guide tube to the vicinity of the desired target; a guide tube 
(in-house investigational device) whose proximal end can 
be ﬁ xed in a bur hole and a radio-opaque stylet  ( Fig. 36.1 ) 
that is inserted into the guide tube such that its distal end is 
at the desired target and which, following radiological con-
ﬁ rmation of its relationship to the desired brain target, can 
be withdrawn such that the guide tube now acts as a port 
for the implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation 
(DBS)  ( Fig. 36.2 )  or radiofrequency lesioning; catheters for

conditions, in both the axial and coronal planes with a 
slice thickness of 2 mm and voxel size 0.45  0.45 mm. 
Different sequences are used to optimize visualization of 
the different targets.  
 5.   The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is best seen on high-reso-
lution T2-weighted images (1.5 Tesla TR 2,500, TE 150, 
TSE 11, NSA 12)  ( Fig. 36.3 ) . This sequence also provides 
good visualization of the red nucleus and the mammil-
lothalamic tract. The location of other structures in the 
subthalamic region such as the zona incerta and prelem-
niscal radiation can be determined indirectly from these 
structures and with reference to a brain atlas used as a 
visual guide. Target visibility may be increased by adjust-
ing the window setting of the T2-weighted images to 
maximize the gray/white matter contrast and by using 
magniﬁ ed hard copy images. The boundaries of visible 
targets in the subthalamic region, such as the STN, may be 
enhanced by overlaying inverted images on to standard 
T2 images, a method that neutralizes the gray areas and 
allows for easier identiﬁ cation of the bright STN edges on 
a dark background. Often boundaries poorly seen in one 
imaging plane are better seen on another. With cross-cor-
relation of STN in axial, coronal and sagittal planes, the 
boundaries can be further identiﬁ ed, conﬁ rmed, and a 
three-dimensional map of the target constructed.  
 6.   We base target planning for the putamen and globus pal-
lidus on a combination of high-resolution T2-weighted 
and inversion recovery sequences. Using magniﬁ ed hard 
copies of the MRI scans, the inversion recovery scans are 
overlaid on the inverted T2 images to enhance the deﬁ ni-
tion of the putamenal and pallidal boundaries in both 
planes. 
 Transposing the Target Position into Stereotactic 
Space 
 1.   The three-dimensional coordinates of a selected target 
are determined by overlaying a transparency with a 1 
mm grid scaled to match the magniﬁ cation of the magni-
ﬁ ed hard copy images (e.g.,  1.6). The center of the grid 
drug delivery; and cell transplantation or viral-vector deliv-
ery. Implantation and veriﬁ cation is MRI or CT-directed and 
enable the whole procedure to be performed under general 
anesthesia. 
 Patient Selection 
 The method described is applicable to patients undergoing 
lesioning, chronic stimulator implantation, or infusions of 
drugs or biologics into subcortical structures. Patients with 
idiopathic Parkinson disease who have developed complica-
tions of medical therapy are generally good candidates for 
these procedures.

 1.  Our modiﬁ ed Leksell stereotactic frame, with noncon-
ducting plastic posts, is appropriately positioned low on 
the head parallel to the orbitomeatal plane and ﬁ xed to 
the skull using carbon ﬁ ber pins inserted into drill holes 
made in the outer table. 
 2.  The frame is applied under general anesthesia, which is 
maintained during the imaging; and with the head frame 
ﬁ xed within the head coil the patient remains immobi-
lized during the acquisition to reduce any movement-
related artifact. 
 3.  A midsagittal plan scan is acquired and the AC and PC are 
visualized. It is desirable to acquire images parallel to the 
AC-PC plane to allow direct comparison with an atlas. If 
the frame is not parallel, the orientation can be readily 
adjusted by loosening the ﬁ xation of the anterior posts to 
the frame and sliding them up or down before retighten-
ing them.

is positioned in the center of the stereotactic space by 
aligning four reference points on the transparency with 
the ﬁ ducials visible on the image. The positions of the 
reference points on the transparency are adjusted to ac-
commodate for the geometric distortion in the particular 
MRI scanner after carrying out phantom studies. 
 2.  The trajectory is planned. For DBS cases the electrode 
contacts are outlined on the images and typically the sec-
ond contact of a quadripolar lead (contacts 1 or 5 of lead 
3389 or 3387, Medtronic Inc.) is placed at the target site.   
 Operative Procedure  
 Surgical Procedure and Perioperative Conﬁ rmation 
of Accurate Targeting 
  1.  Surgery is performed under general anesthesia in a 
semisitting position, such that the frontal bur holes are 
uppermost.  
  2.  Typically the bur hole is made with a 0.25 inch drill, 
guided in a pre-planned trajectory by the stereoguide, 
and sized enough to visualize and coagulate cortical 
vessels under continuous saline irrigation, minimizing 
any cerebrospinal ﬂ uid loss  ( Fig. 36.4 ) . 
  3.  A customized elongated stop (Elekta Instrument AB, 
Stockholm, Sweden) is ﬁ xed into the upper carriage 
with the stereoguide set to the desired coordinates and 
trajectory, and rechecked, a probe is inserted through 
the stop to the level of the skull surface  ( Fig. 36.5 ) . 
  4.  The distance of the probe above the stop, which equates 
with the distance from the skull to the target, is meas-
ured and enables the guide tube to be cut to an ap-
propriate length  ( Fig. 36.5 ) . For the insertion of DBS 
electrodes, the guide tube is generally shortened so 
that when inserted, its distal end will be 12mm short of 
the target, thus ensuring that when the DBS lead is im-
planted, all four contacts will be exposed.  
  5.  A guide tube is inserted into the customized split guide 
(Elekta Instrument AB, Stockholm, Sweden) that is ﬁ xed 
into the lower carriage of the stereoguide.  
  6.   The probe is then advanced to the target through the 
stop and an appropriately-sized guide tube that is held 
in the instrument carriers split guide block  ( Fig. 36.6 ) . 
  7.  The split guide is then unclamped from the lower car-
riage and its halves removed allowing the guide tube to 
be advanced over the probe to the vicinity of the brain 
target  ( Fig. 36.7 ) . 
  8.  Cellulose gauze is laid over the dura around the guide 
tube and acrylic cement placed into the bur hole. The 
hub of the guide tube is seated in the acrylic cement, 
which once set secures the guide tube in place  ( Fig. 
36.8 ) . The probe is now removed. 
  9.  The length from the top of the guide tube dome to the 
stereoguide datum is measured. The probe is replaced 
with a radioopaque stylet cut to length such that its dis-
tal end projects beyond the distal end of the guide tube 
into the target  ( Fig. 36.9 ) . 
 10.   Our technique of guide tube and stylet implantation 
performed under general anesthesia typically takes 
20–30 minutes per side. 
 11.  The scalp wound is now closed and the patient is trans-
ferred to an MRI or a CT scanner where the position of 
the stylet is deﬁ ned in relationship to the desired target

 ( Fig. 36.10 ) with images acquired under stereotactic 
conditions. The perioperative images are laid onto the 
plan scans, formatted as inverted images, and any dis-
placement of the stylet from the planned target is meas-
ured. Peri- or postoperative target veriﬁ cation following 
implantation of a DBS electrode is subject to artifact and 
prevents accurate deﬁ nition of target localization in ad-
dition to carrying some risk.  
 12.  The DBS lead is implanted. 
 
 a.  Before inserting a DBS lead (for example DBS 3389 
or 3387 lead, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), 
the length to be inserted is marked off by a sutured 
stop around the lead, deﬁ ned by the length of the 
stylet that has been withdrawn from the guide tube 
 ( Fig. 36.11 ) . Once inserted, the lead’s tungsten guide 
wire is removed and the lead is bent through a 90 
degree arc conforming with that within the slotted 
hub of the guide tube. The lead is then secured to 
the skull with a miniplate and screws  ( Figs. 36.2 and 
36.12 ) . 
 
 b.  Implanting bilateral DBS leads and connecting to 
an implanted generator adds about 45–60 minutes; 
with total operative time, inclusive of perioperative 
MRI and transfers being about 3–3½ hours. 
 13.  The device placement is optimized and the target error 
corrected 
   The perioperative image may demonstrate a displacement 
of the radioopaque stylet from the chosen target. This may 
result from errors that have arisen during target localization, 
coordinate calculation, or during the operative procedure. In 
these circumstances if the error is large, for example 2 mm 
or larger, it may be corrected by implanting another guide 
tube and style, through another bur hole and trajectory, 
while the suboptimal guide tube and stylet remain in situ 
and act as an internal reference and a brain anchor to limit 
brain shift. On repeat conﬁ rmation of target localization, the 
suboptimal guide tube and stylet are then removed.  
  Where the error is small, for example smaller than 2 mm, 
it can be corrected by putting an appropriate curve in the 
distal end of the guide wire that introduces the DBS elec-
trode, and introduce it with image intensiﬁ er control. As the 
DBS electrode is introduced down the guide tube, the wire 
is straightened and as it emerges from the distal end of the 
guide tube the wire resumes its curved shape and the tip 
of the DBS electrode can be directed to the desired target 
 ( Fig. 36.13 ) .

 The Guide Tube 
 The guide tube is a thin-walled tube with a threaded cy-
lindrical hub positioned at its proximal end. The hub has a 
dome-shaped proximal end that is bisected by a slot that 
is in continuity with the bore of the guide tube. The junc-
tion between the slot and the bore of the tube forms an 
arc so that when a therapeutic device such as a catheter or 
DBS lead is inserted through it to the target and then bent 
through 90 degrees, the therapeutic device will not kink 
 ( Fig. 36.2 ) , and can then be securely ﬁ xed to the skull with 
ease. The guide tube has a removable radioopaque stylet 
 ( Fig. 36.1 )  whose T-shaped proximal end ﬁ ts within the hub 
and whose distal end projects beyond the guide tube into 
the target. The guide tube and stylet are injection molded 
from radioopaque implantable polyurethane.  
 Clinical Indications 
 The guide tube may act as a port for implanting electrodes 
for DBS and radiofrequency lesioning, catheters for drug or 
trophic substance delivery, neural stem cell or encapsulated 
cell transplantation, and viral-vector delivery. 
 The implantable guide tube is useful for gaining re-
peat access to functional targets without repeating the 
whole stereotactic procedure. The device facilitates non-
stereotactic replacement of hardware, for example DBS 
electrodes or catheters, after complications of migration, 
fracture, malfunction, or infection of these therapeutic 
devices.  
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 The technique described here reduces the number of brain 
trajectories and thus may reduce the potential associated 
brain trauma and hemorrhage risk. The procedure of guide 
tube and stylet implantation performed under general an-
esthesia typically takes 20–30 minutes per side, reducing the 
likelihood of brain shift and infection, and prevents patients 
from being exposed to many hours of awake surgery. 
 We have implanted 205 guide tubes in 101 patients; 
there were 4 procedure-related complications and 3 device-
related complications. One patient developed a nonhem-
orrhagic paresis with expressive dysphasia after which he 
continues to make a gradual recovery of function and at the 
12-month follow-up he exhibited a milder deﬁ cit. Another 
patient developed dysphagia for 3 months as a consequence 
of mistargeting secondary to an error in frame relocation, 
with both initial guide tubes and stylet implanted into the 
thalami bilaterally. There was one postoperative self-lim-
iting grand mal seizure and one death from pulmonary 
embolism. The device-related complications included one 
infection, one lead fracture, and one intermittently func-
tioning lead.  
 Conﬂ ict of Interest 
 The implantable guide tube and stylet is an in-house inves-
tigational device.

  Microvascular Decompression of the Facial 
Nerve for Hemifacial Spasm 
 John H. Sampson , Michael J.  Ellis,  Peter M.  Grossi , Takanori Fukushima, and  Tetsuro Sameshima  
    Hemifacial spasm is a condition that typically begins in 
midlife as an intermittent twitching of the facial muscles 
about one eye. The patient may enjoy asymptomatic periods 
early in the course of hemifacial spasm, but eventually it oc-
curs daily and the muscular contractions become stronger. 
As the syndrome worsens, other muscles innervated by the 
ipsilateral facial nerve, including the platysma and stape-
dius muscles, become involved to various degrees in the 
paroxysms of spasm. Also, tonic facial muscle contractions 
occur in addition to the rapid twitching, and mild paresis 
may develop eventually in some of the involved muscles. 
Hemifacial spasm not only alters the patient’s facial appear-
ance but repetitive closure of the eyelid on one side can 
interfere with vision and may restrict reading, driving, and 
other important activities.  
 Patient Selection 
 The diagnosis of hemifacial spasm is based on the history 
and physical examination. It must be differentiated from 
other conditions such as postparalytic hemifacial spasm 
(occurring after facial nerve trauma or Bell palsy), spastic 
paretic facial contracture, facial myokymia, blepharospasm, 
tics, and focal cortical seizures. 
 Although vascular compression of the facial nerve is the 
most common cause of spontaneous hemifacial spasm, there 
are other causes such as a neoplasm, aneurysm, or arterio-
venous malformation in the cerebellopontine angle. Thus it 
is important to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of the patient’s head as part of the initial evaluation. Con-
ventional MRI or cerebral angiography ordinarily will not 
reveal the exact nerve-vessel relationships in those patients 
with vascular compression, but will detect other etiological 
lesions such as those mentioned. Recently, Fukuda and col-
leagues  demonstrated the use of magnetic resonance angi-
ography to effectively deﬁ ne nerve compression and identify 
the vessels involved. However, such relationships identiﬁ ed 
on imaging studies should not be trusted for making the 
diagnosis. Of the various medical and surgical approaches 
that have been taken to the treatment of hemifacial spasm, 
the most successful has been microvascular decompression 
of the facial nerve at the brainstem.   
 Preoperative Preparation 
 After the ordinary preoperative preparations have been 
made, as for any craniotomy or craniectomy, and general 
anesthesia has been induced, a cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) 
lumbar drain can be established before the patient is po-
sitioned to help expose the facial nerve exit zone at the 
brainstem. The patient is positioned in the lateral decubitus 
position with 10 degrees of reverse Trendelenberg and with 
the head of bed elevated 15 degrees. The patient’s head is 
ﬂ exed forward and away from the side of the operation, and 
the vertex is positioned 15 degrees downward. The contra-
lateral neck is elevated to ensure adequate jugular venous 
drainage. The head holder is locked, and the ipsilateral (up-
per) shoulder is drawn gently into a caudal and anterior 
position with tape to provide the surgeon better access to 
the retromastoid region  ( Fig. 37.1A ) . This last maneuver is 
particularly important for right-sided operations for right-
handed surgeons. Intraoperative auditory and somatosen-
sory evoked potential monitoring has been found to play 
a pivotal role in guiding cerebellar retraction and the ma-
nipulation of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. 
If such monitoring is to be used, the ﬁ nal electrode attach-
ments are made before draping.  
 Operative Procedure 
 An area behind the ear is shaved, prepared with antiseptic 
solutions, and draped as a sterile ﬁ eld. A curvilinear scalp 
incision is made along the mastoid crease, beginning at or 
slightly below the level of the asterion  ( Fig. 37.1B ) . The inci-
sion is taken down to the hypodermis with a # 15 blade or a 
low-powered monopolar cautery device. Careful dissection 
with monopolar cautery allows a piece of superﬁ cial fascia 
to be harvested that will be used as graft during closure 
of the dura. The linear incision is taken down to the bone, 
which ordinarily requires coagulation and division of the 
occipital artery and division of the lesser occipital nerve. 
The periosteum and overlying soft tissues are stripped off 
the bone with a periosteal elevator and held in place with a 
cerebellar retractor or with hooks suspended to the drapes 
with rubber bands. 

242 III 
Movement Disorders
 Most commonly, an artery such as the anterior inferior 
cerebellar artery, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, 
or the vertebral artery can be seen against or distorting the 
facial nerve at its exit zone near the brainstem  ( Fig. 37.3A ) . 
The offending vessel is then gently lifted from the nerve 
and repositioned to minimize manipulation of the nerve 
 ( Fig. 37.3B ) . Effective decompression can be accomplished 
by using one of two techniques. First, the surgeon can place 
a polyvinyl alcohol foam sponge between the areas of con-
tact in such a way as to dissipate the arterial pulsations 
without producing mass effect on the nerve. Second (the 
common practice with our patients), a sling is fashioned 
from shredded Teﬂ on and used to position the vessel a non-
offending distance from the nerve. The sling is then ﬁ xed 
to the dura with ﬁ brin glue. It is extremely important not 
to risk kinking or stretching the vessel or disrupting a per-
forating vessel, to preserve its separation from the nerve. 
If tension on the vessel is unavoidable, the ﬁ rst technique 
should be used. In several cases of reexploration using the 
ﬁ rst technique, we have found signiﬁ cant adhesions be-
tween the decompressive implant and the nerve; as such, 
we prefer to use the sling technique on patients whenever 
possible. In the rare circumstance where no abnormality is 
encountered, the surgeon may proceed to the closure of the 
operative defect. 
 Using the fascial graft harvested from the initial expo-
sure, the dura is closed in a water-tight fashion  ( Fig. 37.4 ) . 
Fibrin glue is applied and a dural substitute is placed over 
the defect, which may be ﬁ lled with a bone substitute. A 
custom titanium plate is used to cover the bony defect; and 
the muscles, fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin are reap-
proximated with sutures in anatomic layers. The patient’s 
head is removed from the head holder, a sterile dressing is 
applied to the incision site, and a tight head wrap is placed 
 A small retromastoid craniectomy or craniotomy is created, 
positioned to expose the posteromedial aspect of the sigmoid 
sinus in the lateral portion of the cranial opening  ( Fig. 37.1B ) . 
The inferior margin of the cranial opening should be low, so 
that the remaining bone is extending directly away from the 
surgeon and no lip is left to obscure the surgeon’s view along 
the occipital cranial base. A partial occipital condylectomy is 
then performed to expose the edge of the inferior sigmoid 
sinus, which can be quite fragile in this area. We believe that 
this additional exposure improves visualization of the facial 
nerve root entry zone with the least amount of cerebellar 
retraction. Frequently, mastoid air cells will be opened dur-
ing the craniectomy or craniotomy. When encountered, the 
perforations must be covered with a generous amount of 
bone wax to reduce the likelihood of ﬂ uid (irrigation ﬂ uid, 
CSF, blood) collecting within the middle ear. At this point the 
operative microscope should be positioned. 
 The dura mater is opened inferiorly and posteriorly with 
a curved incision starting at the inferiormost exposure of 
the sigmoid sinus. If supplemental CSF drainage is in place, 
about 25 cc of ﬂ uid should be evacuated from the lumbar 
drain before the dura is opened. A cerebellar retractor with 
a 2 mm wide tip is placed against the inferior margin of the 
cerebellum, at an angle 60 degrees inferior to the cerebellar 
folia. Dissection is carried anteriorly across the skull base, 
within the subarachnoid space, and beneath the cerebellar 
hemisphere, until cranial nerve IX is found. This is then fol-
lowed toward the foramen where cranial nerves X and XI 
are visualized. The surgeon then dissects across the superior 
aspect of the glossopharyngeal nerve medially to expose the 
exit zone of the facial nerve  ( Fig. 37.2 ) . If evoked potentials 
are observed to decline during exposure of facial nerve, im-
mediate attention to be brought to adjusting the retractors, 
as they are most often the culprit.

over the incision. The monitoring electrodes and the lumbar 
drain are removed before the patient is allowed to awaken. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 Patients usually spend at least 6 hours in an intensive care 
unit, after which they can be transferred to a neurologi-
cal step-down unit. The relief of hemifacial spasm is often 
gradual. Although some patients may ﬁ nd immediate relief 
for a few days postoperatively, in many, hemifacial spasm 
may persist for days or months before total relief is appre-
ciated. Based on reported results of microvascular decom-
pression for hemifacial spasm, one can expect that 60–80% 
of patients will have complete relief initially and 15–35% 
will have signiﬁ cant improvement. Approximately 5% will 
show no improvement.  
 Complications 
 Several complications have been reported in the literature, 
but these are rare. These include ipsilateral hearing loss, ip-
silateral facial weakness or anesthesia, cerebellar injury, and 
CSF leak. Hanakita and Kondo  have also reported even rarer 
complications such as intracerebellar hematoma with acute 
hydrocephalus, cerebellar swelling with acute hydrocepha-
lus, brainstem infarction, traumatic aneurysm, supratento-
rial acute subdural hematoma, status epilepticus, cerebral 
infarction, and death.  
 Prevention and Treatment of Complications 
 Concerning the operation, an experienced surgeon and sur-
gical team will ordinarily produce better results with im-
proved outcome and fewer complications. The procedure 
is best done in conjunction with an experienced anesthesi-
ologist. That individual should know, in particular, how to 
detect and treat intravenous air embolism and how to bal-
ance the anesthetic agents in such a way that the patient re-
mains asleep during the operation and yet is light enough to 
permit intraoperative monitoring of auditory (and perhaps 
facial nerve) evoked potentials to avoid anesthesia-induced 
hypotension, and to allow rapid recovery of consciousness 
postoperatively. 

244 III 
Movement Disorders
 We and others now usually monitor brainstem auditory-
evoked potentials during posterior fossa operations for 
microvascular decompression of cranial nerves. Polo and 
colleagues  reported a series of 84 patients who underwent 
microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm during 
which intraoperative brainstem evoked potentials were 
monitored; 88% of patients had no hearing loss after sur-
gery, 9.5% had hearing impairment, and only 2.3% had com-
plete ipsilateral hearing loss. Speciﬁ cally, they concluded 
that a 1 millisecondsec delay in the latency of wave V serves 
as a critical warning that warrants immediate corrective 
maneuvers to prevent irreversible damage. Facial nerve 
monitoring may also be useful. Others  have reported the 
use of intraoperative facial monitoring to help guide and 
conﬁ rm decompression, but this adjunct is not routinely 
used at our institution. Taken together, intraoperative elec-
trophysiologic monitoring offers important insight into the 
integrity of cranial nerves during microvascular decompres-
sion, but is not an absolute safeguard against injury to these 
critical studies. 
 The crucial point of vascular compression in patients with 
hemifacial spasm seems to be within a few millimeters of 
the brainstem. Other vascular relationships with the facial 
nerve also exist laterally, but do not seem to be important

Microvascular Decompression of the Facial Nerve for Hemifacial Spasm 245
in the pathogenesis of hemifacial spasm. The surgeon who 
deals with these relationships instead of those at the nerve 
root exit zone will rely solely on facial nerve trauma to pro-
vide relief; the results probably will not be as good, and the 
incidence of postoperative facial paresis probably will be 
higher. 
 The surgeon performing microvascular decompression 
will reach the facial nerve root exit zone at the brain stem 
most easily by retracting the cerebellum in a cephalad di-
rection and dissecting medially across the superior aspect 
of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Lateral to medial cerebellar 
retraction and lateral to medial dissection along the facial/
vestibulocochlear bundle seem to increase the risk of an ip-
silateral sensorineural hearing deﬁ cit. The artery should be 
mobilized gently to avoid inducing vascular spasm. If such 
vasospasm does develop, it ordinarily will resolve in a few 
minutes, but if it is severe, the surgeon may wish to place a 
cottonoid patty soaked with papaverine against the spastic 
segment until resolution occurs. When the artery is brought 
to its ﬁ nal position, the surgeon must be sure that its main 
trunk and branches are not kinked or otherwise compro-
mised, including as the cerebellar retraction is released. 
 The intermittent and tonic contractions of the facial mus-
cles may continue postoperatively, especially if there was 
little operative manipulation of the facial nerve. If this does 
occur, it ordinarily subsides over days or perhaps weeks. On 
the other hand, if a signiﬁ cant degree of hemifacial spasm 
persists or returns after a period of relief, the surgeon will 
then need to decide whether to recommend reexploration, 
which in itself may not guarantee success. Kureshi and 
Wilkins reported the results of 31 reexplorations for fail-
ure or recurrence after micro vascular decompression for 
hemifacial spasm or trigeminal neuralgia. Postoperative 
complications, including ipsilateral hearing loss, ipsilateral 
facial paresis, ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis, and temporary 
imbalance, occurred in 75% of reoperated patients. As such, 
we recommend that patients with persistent or recurrent 
symptoms be treated with alternative medical treatments 
such as Botulinum toxin injections unless there remains un-
certainty about the ability to decompress the nerve during 
the ﬁ rst surgery.

Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided 
Stereotactic Cingulotomy for Intractable 
Psychiatric Disease
G. Rees Cosgrove
Cingulotomy has been performed for many years on pa-
tients with intractable pain and psychiatric illness. Fulton 
was the first to suggest that the anterior cingulum would be 
an appropriate target for psychosurgical intervention, and 
cingulotomy was initially performed as an open procedure. 
Foltz and White reported their experience with stereotactic 
cingulotomy for intractable pain and noted the best results 
were in those patients with concurrent anxiety and depres-
sion. The safety and effectiveness of cingulotomy in a large 
number of patients has been demonstrated and it has been 
the surgical procedure of choice in North America over the 
past 50 years.
In this chapter, we describe guidelines for the selection of 
surgical candidates along with details of operative technique 
and postoperative management including complications.
Patient Selection
Cingulotomy is considered only for patients with severe, 
treatment refractory psychiatric illness that interferes sig-
nificantly with normal functioning. All conventional thera-
pies, including psychotropic medication, psychotherapy, 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and behavior modification 
therapy, must have been tried without success before surgi-
cal intervention is considered. The severity of the patient’s 
illness must be manifest in terms of both subjective suffering 
and a decline in psychosocial functioning. Severity is usually 
measured with validated clinical research instruments such 
as a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score higher 
than 20 for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or a Beck 
Depression Inventory score higher than 30. Disability may 
be reflected by a Global Assessment of Function score lower 
than 50. The duration of illness is not as important as its 
severity although symptoms should generally have been 
present and unremitting for several years.
The psychiatric diagnostic groups as defined by the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edi-
tion, Revised that might benefit from cingulotomy are major 
affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar depression) and gen-
eralized anxiety states including OCD. Schizophrenia is not 
currently considered an indication for cingulotomy. Many 
OCD patients, because of the severity of their disorder, have 
major depression; these individuals remain candidates for 
surgery.
Contraindications to surgery include hysterical or socio-
pathic personalities and other axis II pathology. Impaired 
cognitive function and organic brain lesions demonstrated 
on imaging may increase the risk of complications. Ad-
vanced age and serious medical illness can also increase 
the risk of perioperative complications and postoperative 
confusion.
The selection of patients for cingulotomy is the most dif-
ficult aspect of the surgery. Patient selection is therefore the 
primary responsibility of the psychiatrist and is guided by 
the informed input of other members of the psychosurgi-
cal team.
The patient must be referred by his or her treating psychi-
atrist who has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the 
patient and who is willing to accept responsibility for future 
care. Medical records are reviewed by a multidisciplinary 
committee of psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery, and lay 
personnel experienced in the use of cingulotomy, to evaluate 
the patient’s suitability for surgery. All members of the com-
mittee must agree that the patient meets criteria for surgery 
and has exhausted all psychotherapeutic interventions.
If these initial criteria are met on record review, the pa-
tient then undergoes a more detailed on-site psychiatric, 
neurologic, and neurosurgical evaluation, including neu-
ropsychological testing, an electroencephalogram and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A family member or 
close personal friend is required to accompany the patient 
in order provide emotional support before, during, and after 
hospitalization. Both the patient and this family member 
must be fully informed of the benefits and risks of the pro-
cedure and be able to give informed consent.
Preoperative Preparation
MRI-guided stereotactic cingulotomy is similar to any other 
stereotactic neurosurgical procedure. All patients must un-
derstand the various stages of the surgery, including frame 
application, MRI scanning, and lesion placement in the op-
erating room. They need to be reassured that only the initial 
infiltration of local anesthetic will be uncomfortable and 

250 IV 
Other Disorders
patient’s head and stereotactic ring are then covered with a 
sterile plastic cover. No additional draping is generally nec-
essary. Sterile basins are positioned for surgical instruments 
on the right and lesioning electrode on the left.
Operative Procedure
The patient is sedated to minimize discomfort and anxiety.
After the stereotactic arc assembly is placed over the pa-
tient’s head and secured to the base ring, a limited bicoro-
nal scalp incision is made after local anesthesia (Lidocaine 
1%: 1/200,000 epinephrine) is administered. Bur holes are 
placed bilaterally about 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture 
and 1.5 cm from the midline. A handheld Hudson perforator 
is preferred over pneumatic powered drills to minimize pa-
tient anxiety. After bipolar cauterization, the dura is opened 
and an entrance point is chosen that avoids cortical ves-
sels. A standard thermocoagulation electrode (Radionics, 
Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) with a 10 mm uninsulated tip is 
inserted to the target coordinates and heated to 85°C for 
90 seconds. After adequate cooling, the electrode is then 
withdrawn 10 mm, and a second lesion is made, using the 
same lesion parameters. This results in a lesion of about 2 
cm in vertical height and 8–10 mm in diameter in the ante-
rior cingulum (Fig. 38.1). The procedure is then performed 
in an identical fashion on the opposite side. The bur holes 
are filled with Gelfoam and bone dust and the scalp incision 
closed in layers. A sterile dressing is applied, the stereotac-
tic frame is removed, and antibiotic cream is applied to the 
pin sites.
Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications
The patient is initially observed in a recovery room until 
fully awake, then transferred to the neurosurgical ward. 
A postoperative MRI scan is obtained to document lesion 
placement and to rule out perioperative complications. Only 
mild oral analgesics are generally required postoperatively.
Minor symptoms of headache, nausea or vomiting, and 
low-grade fever are typical. Temporary bladder dysfunc-
tion (either retention or incontinence) is not uncommon 
and can last a few days to a few weeks. Transient unsteady 
gait, dizziness, and mild confusion may rarely occur for a 
few days postoperatively. All these side effects are treated 
symptomatically with medications and usually disappear 
within few days. Intracerebral hemorrhage or subdural he-
matoma is rare and has occurred in only 4 cases in nearly 
1000 cingulotomies at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
Seizures, either focal or generalized convulsions, can occur 
postoperatively in 2–5% of patients. They tend to be isolated 
events, easily controllable with anticonvulsant medications, 
and are more common in patients with a history of seizures. 
Cingulotomy does not create significant behavioral or intel-
lectual deficits, and in a carefully studied cohort of patients, 
a comparison of preoperative and postoperative Weschler 
intelligence quotient scores demonstrated significant gains 
postoperatively.
that they will receive intravenous sedation and narcotics 
during frame placement. An explanation of the MRI scan-
ning process and how the targets are selected along with 
a detailed explanation of what will occur in the operating 
room is essential to the patient’s cooperation. We typically 
do not use any preoperative anticonvulsants or steroids and 
avoid arterial lines and bladder catheterization.
Operative Procedure
The patient is kept non per os after midnight except for his 
or her usual medications. One hour before arriving in the 
operative suite, droperidol 5 mg is administered intramus-
cularly and valium 10 mg is administered per os; these suc-
cessfully sedate even the most anxious patient.
Stereotactic Frame Application
When the patient arrives in the holding area, a peripheral 
intravenous line is inserted and additional intravenous se-
dation is administered as needed. An MRI-compatible stere-
otactic head ring is applied to the patient’s head after the 
pin insertion sites are infiltrated with local anesthesia (1% 
Lidocaine with 1:200:000 epinephrine). Pin sites are cho-
sen so that the base ring lies well below target plane and 
is roughly parallel to the orbitomeatal line. Placement of 
the frame is facilitated by use of an adjustable Velcro strap, 
which avoids the use of painful ear bars. The ring should 
be applied as symmetrically as possible, without rotation 
or tilt.
Target Acquisition
After an MRI-compatible stereotactic localizer is attached, 
the entire assembly is secured to the MRI couch mount 
adapter to keep the patient and stereotactic apparatus im-
mobilized. First, a T1-weighted midsagittal MRI scan (TR 
300 millisecondsec; TE 17 millisecondsec) is obtained as a 
reference to identify the cingulate gyri bilaterally, approxi-
mate the location of bur holes, and to plan the electrode 
trajectory. Next, oblique coronal sections (4 mm thickness 
and 1 mm intervals) are obtained parallel to the proposed 
electrode trajectory, spanning the entire anterior cingulate 
gyri and the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Target 
coordinates are calculated for a point in the anterior cingu-
late gyrus 2 to 2.5 cm posterior to the tip of the frontal horn, 
7 mm from the midline, and 1–2 mm above the roof of the 
lateral ventricle bilaterally. After the target is successfully 
calculated, the patient is returned to the operating room.
Patient Positioning
The patient is placed in a semireclining position on the 
operating table with the head positioned low enough to 
minimize the risk of air embolism. The stereotactic frame is 
then secured to the operating table using the Mayfield-Kees 
adapter to ensure the neck is in a neutral, comfortable posi-
tion. The scalp is shaved in the frontal region along the coro-
nal suture and scrubbed with soap solution and alcohol. The

MRI-Guided Stereotactic Cingulotomy for Intractable Psychiatric Disease 251
Cingulotomy is not considered a substitute for careful 
psychiatric management. Therefore, all therapies, includ-
ing psychotherapy, ECT, and psychotropic drugs that may 
have given partial benefit preoperatively, must be continued 
postoperatively.
Although some patients may experience an immediate re-
duction in anxiety, there is generally a delay between surgery 
and its beneficial effects on depression and OCD symptoms. 
This latency may be as long as 3 to 6 months and must be 
clearly explained to the patient and referring psychiatrist. 
Because of this, some patients commit suicide in the im-
mediate postoperative period before any beneficial effect 
of the cingulotomy is realized. Patients, their families, and 
the treating psychiatrists must be cognizant of and alert to 
this possibility, especially for patients who are considered 
high risk and those who have had suicidal ideation before 
surgery.
About half of the patients will require a repeat cingulot-
omy. Reoperation and enlargement of the cingulotomy le-
sion is considered if there has been a less than satisfactory 
response after 3 to 6 months. Multiple cingulotomies can be 
performed safely after adequate time has elapsed between 
procedures (Fig. 38.2). Repeat lesions should be made ante-
rior to the initial lesion to avoid injury to the premotor area. 
Occasionally, a third cingulotomy can be considered if the 
results of the initial two procedures were unsatisfactory. In 
these situations, we generally recommend converting the 
cingulotomy to a limbic leucotomy.

Conclusions
MRI-guided stereotactic cingulotomy is the most commonly 
performed procedure for intractable psychiatric disease in 
the United States. It is considered only after a patient has 
exhausted all conventional therapies and only for treatment 
refractory major affective disorders and OCD. Cingulotomy 
is a safe procedure with few side effects and is a useful and 
often life-saving intervention in a substantial percentage of 
patients.

 Implantation of Drug Infusion Pumps 
 Spiros Blackburn and Joshua Dowling  
 Implantable intrathecal pumps are currently used to treat 
spasticity and chronic pain. Drugs approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration for intrathecal use include 
baclofen, morphine, and ziconotide. Two pump types 
are currently available in the United States. These sys-
tems consist of either a constant infusion rate (Isomed®, 
Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or programma-
ble pump (Synchromed II®, Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, 
MN, USA) connected to a catheter leading into the spinal 
subarachnoid space  ( Fig. 39.1 ) . Although programmable 
pumps are more expensive, they are more widely used 
because they provide greater flexibility in adjusting medi-
cation doses. 
 Patient Selection 
 Continuous intrathecal drug infusion offers two major ad-
vantages over oral or intravenous delivery. Avoidance of the 
blood-brain barrier allows for greater drug potency. In ad-
dition, the differential between intracranial and intraspinal 
concentrations provides this greater potency with fewer 
central nervous system side effects. Thus patients can be 
considered for intrathecal infusion if their pain or spasticity 
cannot be adequately controlled with oral medication, or 
if the medications cause unacceptable side effects, such as 
sedation or cognitive problems. The speciﬁ c indications de-
pend on whether the pump is being implanted for spasticity 
or for pain. In either case the patient must be a reasonable 
candidate for an elective procedure usually performed un-
der general anesthetic. 
 Intrathecal baclofen infusion is highly effective for treat-
ment of spasticity from a variety of underlying causes, in-
cluding spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, 
and brain injury from trauma or stroke. Before a pump is im-
planted, a trial of intrathecal baclofen should be performed 
to demonstrate efﬁ cacy. In most cases, a bolus injection via 
lumbar puncture of 50–100 mcg of baclofen is performed, 
although for some patients a continuous infusion through 
an indwelling intrathecal catheter is preferable. Evalua-
tion at intervals by a physical therapist using spasm and 
Ashworth scales facilitates objective documentation of the 
effect. Patients should be thoroughly educated about the 
expected effects of the trial and of the permanent infusion 
pump. With a bolus, relief will be only transient and may 
be incomplete or excessive. As long as efﬁ cacy is demon-
strated, the exact infusion dose can be titrated after the 
pump is implanted if a programmable pump is planned. If a 
constant rate infusion pump is to be implanted, a catheter 
trial will allow the initial infusion dose to be determined. 
Patients frequently consider spasticity to include the un-
derlying weakness from their neurological condition. Am-
bulatory patients may underestimate the degree to which 
they use their increased tone for postural stability and be 
disappointed with excessive relief of spasticity. Therefore, 
the criteria for a successful trial and the goals of treatment 
must be reviewed with the patient in advance. 
 Intrathecal drug infusion is used for pain from malig-
nancy and for pain of benign etiology. As with spasticity, 
intrathecal infusion can be considered when pain cannot be

tion should be given to obstructions, such as gastrostomy 
tubes (G-tubes), colostomies, or previous surgeries. The 
possible need for G-tube in terminal patients can be antici-
pated by placing the pump on the right. Patients may also 
express a preference. 
 In most cases, general anesthetic is preferable for pump 
implantation. Although the surgery is predominantly subcu-
taneous, the tunneling procedure is particularly uncomfort-
able for the patients and is difﬁ cult to adequately anesthe-
tize with local agents. In patients who are poor candidates 
for general anesthetic, consideration can be given to local 
anesthetic supplemented with adequate sedation.  
 Operative Procedure 
 The patient is positioned in the lateral decubitus position 
with care taken to pad all bony prominences. Adequate 
exposure of the lumbar region, ﬂ ank, and abdomen is re-
quired. Positioning can be especially challenging in spas-
ticity patients with contractures. The ﬂ uoroscopic C-arm 
is positioned for an anterior-posterior view of the spine. 
The needle will be introduced via a paramedian approach 
to allow for an approach angle of around 45 degrees. This 
angle facilitates threading the catheter and ensures that 
it advances in a cephalad direction. A lumbar incision is 
therefore planned at around the L4–5 level for introduc-
ing the catheter into the L3–4 or L4–5 interlaminar space 
 ( Fig. 39.2 ) . The abdominal incision is planned at least two to 
three ﬁ ngerbreadths below the rib margin  ( Fig. 39.3 ) . If the 
incision is too high, the pump can cause signiﬁ cant discom-
fort against the ribs. The medial border of the pump should 
be close to midline to avoid contact with the iliac crest. On 
the other hand, the umbilicus must not be violated during 
subcutaneous pocket formation. After the skin is prepped, 
draping must be done very carefully to avoid contamination, 
adequately controlled without excessive side effects. For pa-
tients with benign pain, a clear underlying etiology for the 
pain should be deﬁ ned. Candidates for intrathecal narcotics 
usually undergo psychological evaluation to screen for un-
derlying psychiatric or psychological contraindications. This 
may be less relevant or practical in cancer patients. The pain 
must be narcotic responsive as established with a trial of 
continuous infusion using an epidural or intrathecal cathe-
ter. Because pain is often related to activity such as standing 
or walking, an epidural trial has the advantage of allowing 
for patient mobility without risk of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid (CSF) 
leakage and spinal headache. In some cases a bolus trial may 
be adequate, although results of a single injection can be 
misleading, given the inherent subjectivity of pain.  
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Preoperative preparation is directed toward anticipating 
and avoiding operative and postoperative complications. 
Infection, hematoma formation, and poor wound healing 
are primary concerns. Spasticity and cancer pain patients 
commonly encounter ongoing infections. These should 
be treated before implantation. All susceptible patients 
should be screened for urinary tract infection and for 
decubitus ulcers. Prophylactic antibiotics are administered 
perioperatively. These should be directed toward normal 
skin ﬂ ora. The possibility of resistant organisms should be 
considered in hospitalized or institutionalized individuals. 
Patients should not be anticoagulated in the periopera-
tive period because of the risk of intraspinal hemorrhage 
or hematoma within the pump pocket. If the patient has 
undergone an infusion trial, the catheter site should be 
completely healed. 
 The site of pump placement must be determined in ad-
vance. Either right or left abdomen is acceptable. Considera-

because hardware is to be implanted and will be lost in the 
event of an infection. 
 The catheter is placed ﬁ rst. Both single piece and two part 
catheters are available. Some aspects of implantation may 
be speciﬁ c to the hardware kit used, so the manufacturer’s 
recommendations should be followed. Nevertheless, gen-
eral principles apply. After inﬁ ltration with local anesthetic, 
a small stab incision is made with an 11 or 15 blade scalpel. 
A 15 gauge Tuohy needle is introduced under ﬂ uoroscopic 
guidance via a paramedian approach to the interlaminar 
space at L3–4 or L4–5  ( Fig. 39.4 ) . The needle is introduced 
with the bevel parallel to the axis of the spine and there-
fore to the dural ﬁ bers. When the needle enters into the 
lumbar cistern, it is rotated so that the opening is directed 
cephalad. The catheter is threaded through the needle until 
its tip reaches the desired level, which may vary depending 
on the indication or distribution of symptoms. A T7 level 
for the catheter tip is versatile. If the catheter cannot be 
advanced, the needle must be withdrawn along with the 
catheter because withdrawing the catheter through the 
needle can sheer off a piece within the spinal canal. The 
incision is then extended a few centimeters cephalad and 
carried down to the dorsal fascia  ( Fig. 39.5 ) . Hemostasis 
is achieved with the bipolar electrocautery. A purse string 
suture is placed around the needle. The needle is backed off 
the catheter. The catheter guide wire and needle are then 
fully withdrawn. CSF will usually drain spontaneously to 
conﬁ rm subarachnoid placement of the catheter, although 
gentle aspiration can be applied if needed. If doubt remains, 
contrast dye can be infused to conﬁ rm placement. The purse 
string suture is tied tight enough to snug the dorsal fas-
cia around the catheter without occluding it. The provided 
anchor is threaded over the catheter and secured with a 
nonabsorbable suture  ( Fig. 39.6 ) . It is important to conﬁ rm 
that the catheter is still patent. 
 Attention is directed to the abdomen, where the planned 
incision is inﬁ ltrated with local anesthetic. The incision is 
made with a scalpel and carried through the Scarpa fascia 
to the deep fascia. A subcutaneous pocket is created with 
blunt dissection and the Bovie to receive the pump. He-
mostasis must be fairly meticulous to avoid a postoperative 
hematoma. The pocket must be large enough for the pump

rod is withdrawn leaving the tunneling sheath in place. The 
catheter is then passed through the sheath to the pocket, 
and the sheath is withdrawn. It is not necessary to trim 
excess catheter. If the excess is trimmed, the length must 
be recorded for catheter volume calculations. This informa-
tion is essential for priming boluses and drug concentration 
changes. The catheter is attached to the pump connector 
and secured with a 2–0 silk tie. 
 Before the pump can be connected to the catheter, it must 
be prepared for implantation. The pump is shipped with 
sterile water in the reservoir. That ﬂ uid is withdrawn, and 
the pump is ﬁ lled with the desired drug. At this point the 
pump can be programmed for a priming bolus to clear the 
internal pump tubing and the implanted catheter, as well as 
for the initial infusion rate. 
 Once the pump is ready, the catheter connector is attached 
and secured with a 2–0 silk tie  ( Fig. 39.7 ) . Any excess cath-
eter is looped beneath the pump, which is inserted into the 
subcutaneous pocket  ( Fig. 39.8 ) . The pump is anchored to 
the fascia with 2–0 silk suture. Care must be taken to ensure 
that the catheter is not occluded by the anchoring sutures. 
Also, all excess catheter should be deep to the pump so that 
it is not punctured or lacerated during pump reﬁ lls. 
 After copious irrigation, the wounds are closed in layers, 
including superﬁ cial (Scarpa) fascia, dermis, and skin. Ster-
ile dressings are then applied.  
 Postoperative Management and Possible 
Complications 
 Routine overnight postoperative observation is generally 
sufﬁ cient for these patients. Initial drug infusion rates 
should be set low to avoid the possibility of overdose. The 
abdominal wound should be monitored for hematoma for-
mation because this can lead to wound breakdown or leak-
age and thereby to infection. In incontinent patients precau-
tions should be taken to avoid soiling of the lumbar wound 
in the early postoperative period.

without excessive tension. In obese patients, the subcutane-
ous tissue superﬁ cial to the pocket may be too thick, requir-
ing resection of a layer of fat to keep the reﬁ ll port within 
2.5 cm of the surface. This maneuver is preferable to making 
the pocket more superﬁ cial to begin with because the pump 
cannot be reliably anchored to subcutaneous fat to prevent 
ﬂ ipping. 
 Once the pocket has been completed, a tunneling device 
is passed from the lumbar incision to the abdominal inci-
sion. Lifting the lateral edge of the abdominal wound with 
a handheld retractor helps by reducing the curvature of the 
tunneling pass and ensuring that the tunneling device en-
ters the pocket beneath the Scarpa fascia. The tunneling

 Surgical complications include infection, pump pocket 
hematoma or seroma, CSF leak, and radiculopathy. Infec-
tions in contact with the hardware generally require expla-
nation. Most of these will occur within the pump pocket 
and be evident as erythema, drainage swelling, or break-
down of the abdominal wound. Infections tracking along the 
catheter can result in meningitis. In some cases in will be 
easier to withdraw CSF from the pump access port than to 
perform a lumbar puncture. A hematoma or seroma can ini-
tially raise concern of infection and may require exploration 
of the wound for evacuation to prevent wound breakdown, 
drainage, or excessive discomfort. In some cases, percutane-
ously tapping the wound for culture can rule out infection if 
exploration is not otherwise indicated. CSF leakage around 
the catheter can result in spinal headache. If it is severe, the 
leakage can produce ﬂ uid pockets in the lumbar wound or 
around the pump. If this leaks from the wound, infection, in-
cluding meningitis, can result. Epidural blood patching may 
solve the problem; however, it must be performed under 
ﬂ uoroscopic guidance to avoid puncturing or lacerating the 
catheter. In some cases, the catheter may need to be revised. 
Radiculopathy can result from injury to a root during needle 
insertion or from ongoing irritation from the catheter. If 
pain does not resolve spontaneously, catheter revision or 
removal should be considered. 
 Device related complications include catheter breakage, 
kinking, disconnection, or withdrawal from the subarach-
noid space. Most catheter problems can be diagnosed with 
plain X-rays. In some cases, the patency of the catheter must 
be established with a dye study performed by injecting the 
catheter access port with water-soluble contrast under 
ﬂ uoroscopy. Mechanical malfunction of the pump is rare. 
The pump can break free of its anchoring sutures, allowing 
it to ﬂ ip, thereby preventing access to the reﬁ ll port. In very 
thin or ill patients, erosion of the skin can lead to hardware 
exposure and infection. 
 Many potential complications are drug related. Drug 
overdosing is possible and can be fatal. Drug concentration 
changes or priming bolusing requires catheter length and 
volume to be properly calculated. Currently available pumps 
accept only a 24 gauge needle in the catheter access port, 
whereas reﬁ lls should only be done with a 22 gauge non-
coring needle. Although this prevents direct injection reﬁ ll 
drug into the subarachnoid space, injection into the pump 
pocket is still possible. Loss of drug effect from malfunc-
tion, catheter occlusion, or pump battery reaching end of life 
must be urgently addressed. For baclofen patients, this can 
lead to return of spasticity, muscle rigidity, fever, and hy-
potension, and in extreme cases can be fatal. Inﬂ ammatory 
masses at the catheter tip have been reported in patients 
receiving opiate infusions. Although rare, these granulomas 
can result in spinal cord compression and myelopathy and 
may present as a loss of or decrease in pain relief. If the mass 
is small or does not cause signiﬁ cant spinal cord compres-
sion, cessation of the drug may allow the lesion to regress. In 
some cases, the lesion may need to be surgically resected.

 Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Image-
Guided Brain Biopsy 
 Walter A.  Hall  and Charles L. Truwit  
 Patient Selection 
 Neurobiopsy allows neurosurgeons to safely and accurately 
localize and sample intrinsic lesions in the brain. The intro-
duction of stereotaxis into neurosurgery allowed a three-di-
mensional imaging database to be precisely translated into 
the three-dimensional coordinate system of the head frame 
and the ability to direct and stabilize the biopsy needle dur-
ing surgery. Computed tomography was rapidly replaced by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the radiographic me-
dium of choice because of its ability to display the brain in 
multiple projections with exquisite anatomical detail. The 
advent of neuronavigational systems in the 1990s has super-
seded frame-based stereotaxis for performing brain biopsy. 
All these techniques require preoperative imaging that is ob-
tained either several days or immediately before the planned 
operative procedure when the cranium is still closed. At 
the time of the procedure, the penetration of the skull and 
the opening of the dura mater can unfortunately result in the 
egress of cerebrospinal ﬂ uid with subsequent shifting of the 
brain and displacement of the intended target. The only cur-
rent surgical technique that allows the neurosurgeon to com-
pensate for brain shift is intraoperative MRI-guided brain bi-
opsy. Because the imaging is performed in near-real time, the 
surgeon can monitor the advancement of the biopsy needle 
through the brain until the target tissue has been accessed. 
 Intraoperative MRI-guidance was ﬁ rst used to perform 
brain biopsy nearly a decade ago; the initial procedures were 
performed with a 0.5-Tesla (T) interventional MRI system. 
Since 1999, we have combined the use of a 1.5-T short-bore 
intraoperative MRI system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, 
The Netherlands) with a disposable skull-mounted trajec-
tory guide for performing brain biopsy. Patients considered 
for MRI-guided brain biopsy can have lesions in both the su-
pratentorial and infratentorial compartments of the cranium. 
Because of the ability to avoid the ventricular system by 
careful selection of the needle trajectory, even lesions in the 
brainstem can be safely sampled via a coronal approach.  
 Preoperative Preparation 
 Patients receive preoperative antibiotics and intravenous 
corticosteroids before beginning the operation. The neuro-
surgeon reviews previous MRI to determine the appropriate 
MRI sequences for performing the brain biopsy. Demyeli-
nating disease and low-grade brain tumors are generally 
best visualized on T2-weighted orthogonal half-Fourier 
acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) or turbo 
ﬂ uid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images. Pri-
mary high-grade brain tumors and secondary metastatic 
tumors are usually best visualized on T1-weighted gadolin-
ium-enhanced images. The administration of the contrast 
agent is reserved until the time of the biopsy to prevent 
its diffusion into areas of blood-brain barrier breakdown 
distant from the focus of conﬂ uent tumor tissue. Most deep 
supratentorial and brainstem lesions are biopsied using im-
ages oriented in the sagittal and coronal planes. Superﬁ cial 
cortical and cerebellar lesions are imaged in the axial and 
coronal planes during biopsy.  
 Anesthetic Technique 
 MRI-guided brain biopsy can be performed under either lo-
cal or general anesthesia. We prefer to use general anesthe-
sia because it can be difﬁ cult for a patient to remain calm for 
the entire length of the procedure. The biopsy can last 1–3 
hours, depending on the surgical complexity. Many of the 
lesions that are biopsied are in intracranial locations, where 
it would be difﬁ cult for the patient to maintain his or her 
head in the proper orientation for the entire surgery.  
 Operative Procedure  
 Operative Positioning 
 The patient is transferred from the transport cart to the pad-
ded MRI-compatible surgical table and placed in the supine 
position. A shoulder role is placed if the head is to be turned 
or the target lesion is located in the posterior fossa. The head 
is placed on a foam rubber donut and the forehead can be 
taped to the surgical table to prevent inadvertent posterior 
rotation. One circular radiofrequency surface coil is placed 
under the head on the donut in a plastic bag to prevent soil-
ing. The second radiofrequency coil is stapled to the surgical 
drapes in a position that is opposite to the ﬁ rst coil and an 
Ioban (3M Medical Products, Minneapolis, MN, USA) drape 
is placed over the surgical ﬁ eld. The surface coils improve

sion is made that is long enough to accept the base of the 
trajectory guide. The initial portion of the procedure may 
be performed either outside the magnetic ﬁ eld using all 
standard surgical instrumentation or at the back end of the 
scanner, using MRI-compatible instrumentation. A bur hole 
is made through the skull with a cranial perforator. In areas 
of the skull where the bone is particularly thin (temporal) 
the cranial opening may need to be enlarged with a Kerrison 
rongeur to insert the bur hole design trajectory guide base. 
The dura mater is coagulated and incised in a cruciate fash-
ion and the base of the trajectory guide is secured in place 
with three self-tapping titanium screws with a disposable 
screwdriver that is included in the trajectory guide kit  ( Fig. 
40.3 ) . A single diameter guide tube is then snapped into the 
base and locked in place with a plastic tightening nut. To 
visualize the alignment stem, it is ﬁ lled with either saline 
or a mixture of gadolinium contrast and saline, depending 
on which MRI sequences best demonstrate the target lesion. 
The alignment stem is then inserted into the guide tube to 
determine a trajectory in several MRI planes for the biopsy 
using prospective stereotaxis. 
 At this point, the disposable surgical drapes that hang 
below the edge of the surgical table are cut off to enable 
the table to dock properly with the MRI scanner gantry and 
allow the patient to be transported to the opposite side of 
the magnet where the trajectory is deﬁ ned and the biopsy 
 performed. After the trajectory has been chosen and con-
ﬁ rmed on MRI in at least two projections  ( Figs. 40.4 and 
40.5 ) , the guide tube is secured by tightening the locking 
the signal-to-noise ratio that affords the high resolution 
imaging, and the biopsy is usually performed through the 
superﬁ cial coil  ( Fig. 40.1 ) . We have been able to access le-
sions in the cerebellum in this manner without having to 
place patients in the prone position. 
 Operative Procedure 
 The disposable Navigus trajectory guide  ( Fig. 40.2 ) that we 
use for brain biopsy is commercially available and manu-
factured by Image-Guided Neurologics, Inc. (Melbourne, FL, 
USA). The guide can be attached to the skull either in a bur 
hole or to allow for a twist drill craniostomy. We prefer the 
bur hole variation of the trajectory guide because it allows 
us to visualize the brain surface and any vessels that may 
underlie the dura mater that could be injured with a twist 
drill when the skull is penetrated, resulting in a subarach-
noid hemorrhage. The trajectory guide also comes in a ver-
sion that can be attached to the scalp through which the 
skull can undergo perforation. 
 An MRI-visible button with a single adhesive side is 
placed on the scalp where it is expected to undergo pen-
etration. Accurately localizing the site for opening the skull 
is particularly important for lesions located directly below 
the cortical surface. A misplaced cranial entry site may 
prevent the surgeon from sampling a lesion because of the 
obliquity of the angle needed to direct the biopsy needle. 
An angled base is also provided in the trajectory guide kit 
that allows for access of tissue in more extreme locations 
such as the anterior inferior frontal lobe, where the inci-
sion is located behind the hairline. The hair is not shaved 
but parted along the incision line and then prepped with 
an iodine-based scrub, alcohol, and Duraprep (3M Medi-

nut and the alignment stem is removed. A reduction cannula 
is inserted into the guide tube that will allow the biopsy 
needle to be secured at the target depth to prevent migra-
tion to either a shallower or a deeper level. In a stepwise 
fashion with periodic snapshot MRI updates, the titanium 
brain biopsy needle is gradually advanced toward the tar-
get in near-real time  ( Figs. 40.4 and 40.5 ) . The disposable 
titanium brain biopsy needle (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument 
Corp., Racine, WI, USA) that we use is 15 cm long and is an 
appropriate length to reach any location within the intrac-
ranial compartment  ( Figs. 40.2 and 40.3 ) . 
 For most lesions, HASTE imaging is used to determine the 
surgical trajectory to the target because of its rapid scan 
acquisition time. If the target lesion that is to be biopsied is 
best visualized on contrast-enhanced images, intravenous 
contrast is administered at this time before the biopsy nee-
dle is passed. Once the biopsy needle reaches the target 
and the reduction cannula is tightened around the needle, 
imaging is performed in two orthogonal planes  ( Figs. 40.4 
and 40.5 ) , along the entire length of the biopsy needle to 
document the location of the needle tip, from where the 
tissue samples are being obtained, and conﬁ rm the accuracy 
of the procedure. When performing the biopsy, a 10 cc sy-
ringe ﬁ lled with saline is used to gently aspirate the tissue 
being sampled into the needle through a 1 cm long side 
port  ( Fig. 40.6 ) . Flexible tubing connects the biopsy needle 
to the syringe so that there is very little manipulation of 
the outer cannula during sampling and the position of the 
needle remains constant. After aspirating the tissue sample 
into the biopsy needle, its inner stylet, which should contain 
the sample, is withdrawn from the outer cannula and the 
aspirated tissue is irrigated onto a piece of Telfa nonadher-
ent dressing (Tyco Healthcare Group, Mansﬁ eld, MA, USA). 
Multiple samples are usually obtained from the target tissue 
at different depths and in different directions for frozen sec-
tion and permanent pathologic analysis. At present, we still 
conﬁ rm the presence of pathologic tissue in the specimen 
before leaving the operating room. 
 While the pathologist is analyzing the tissue samples, the 
biopsy needle is removed  and three distinct MRI imaging 
sequences are used to evaluate the sample site for intra-

were obtained in case the pathologist does not identify diag-
nostic tissue in the frozen section tissue sample. The needle 
can then be reinserted for additional tissue sampling with-
out retargeting the lesion. 
 After diagnostic tissue has been conﬁ rmed, the patient 
is moved from the MRI scanner to outside the 5 Gauss line 
for closure. The trajectory guide is disengaged from the 
skull and the wound is irrigated with antibiotic solution. A 
titanium bur hole cover (OsteoMed, Dallas, TX, USA) is at-
tached to the skull with two self-tapping titanium screws 
operative hemorrhage. Because hyperacute blood (before 
conversion of intracellular oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemo-
globin) can be difﬁ cult to detect on MRI, a combination of 
HASTE, gradient echo (GE)-T2*, and turbo FLAIR sequences 
has proved sensitive to detect intraoperative hemorrhage 
accurately  ( Fig. 40.7 ) . The biopsy needle comes with a dis-
posable stop that can be used to mark the needle depth 
and prevent the needle from advancing farther. Before the 
biopsy needle is withdrawn, the stop is tightened onto the 
needle to mark the depth from where the tissue samples

to maintain the outer contour of the skull. The galea of 
the scalp is closed with interrupted inverted absorbable 
sutures and skin is closed with a continuous running ab-
sorbable suture.  
 Prospective Stereotaxis 
 Prospective stereotaxis is a novel way to determine the sur-
gical path for the brain biopsy needle, using a trajectory 
guide that starts at the site for biopsy and moves away from 
the target toward the distal end of the alignment stem. Af-
ter the biopsy location (target point) has been chosen, two 
additional points need to be identiﬁ ed in space to align the 
trajectory guide with the target. The second point is located 
at the tip of the alignment stem and is called the pivot point. 
The third point is located out in space and represents the 
desired location of the cross section of the alignment stem. 
Two orthogonal MRI planes are deﬁ ned such that their in-
tersection is the desired location of the alignment stem. Us-
ing rapidly updating MRI in these two planes, the alignment 
stem is oriented until all three points are collinear; this en-
sures the biopsy needle passing through the trajectory guide 
will encounter the target. 
 After the alignment stem is ﬁ lled with a ﬂ uid for visu-
alization on MRI, it is then inserted into the guide tube to 
perform prospective stereotaxis. Because it has a ball joint, 
the alignment stem can be rotated freely in space to align 
all three points in less than 5 minutes  ( Fig. 40.8 ) . After the 
points are aligned, scanning along the entire length of the 
 10.1055/978-1-60406-073-7c040_f007
 10.1055/978-1-60406-073-7c040_f007
 Fig. 40.7  Because the presence of hyperacute blood 
can be difﬁ cult to detect on MR imaging, a combi-
nation of turbo ﬂ uid-attenuated inversion-recovery 
(FLAIR) (upper left), half-Fourier acquisition single-
shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) (upper right), and 
gradient echo-T2* (lower left) sequences are neces-
sary to accurately exclude the presence of intraop-
erative hemorrhage. The black area on the gradient 
echo-T2* scan in the enhancing target represents air 
and not hemorrhage because it is not present on the 
turbo FLAIR or HASTE scans. A T1-weighted contrast-
enhanced scan is seen in the lower right.   (Copyright

 Fig. 40.8 Because of a ball joint, the alignment stem can be rotated

without moving the patient.   (Copyright © Walter A. Hall and Charles

stem is performed to conﬁ rm that the trajectory guide is 
directed toward the target and that the biopsy needle will 
encounter the tissue of interest after it passes through the 
brain. If the surgical path is considered accurate, the locking 
nut is tightened to prevent the trajectory guide tube from 
being redirected or displaced. 
 Postoperative Management Including 
Possible Complications 
 ChloraPrep antibacterial skin preparation (Medi-Flex, Inc., 
Leawood, KS, USA) is applied to the wound to prevent in-
fection and a Primapore dressing (Smith & Nephew, Hull, 
England) is placed over the wound for 48 hours. The patient 
is then transported from the surgical table to a gurney and 
transported to the recovery room for extubation. Usually the 
patient is discharged home the following morning, although 
some patients have been discharged home the same day at 
their own request after several hours of observation.
