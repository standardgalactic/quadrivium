Frame Relay
Introduction
Frame Relay is a high-performance WAN protocol that operates at the physical and data link layers of
the OSI reference model. Frame Relay originally was designed for use across Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) interfaces. Today, it is used over a variety of other network interfaces as well. This
chapter focuses on Frame Relay’s specifications and applications in the context of WAN services.
Frame Relay is an example of a packet-switched technology. Packet-switched networks enable end
stations to dynamically share the network medium and the available bandwidth. The following two
techniques are used in packet-switching technology:
•
Variable-length packets
•
Statistical multiplexing
Variable-length packets are used for more efficient and flexible data transfers. These packets are
switched between the various segments in the network until the destination is reached.
Statistical multiplexing techniques control network access in a packet-switched network. The advantage
of this technique is that it accommodates more flexibility and more efficient use of bandwidth. Most of
today’s popular LANs, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, are packet-switched networks.
Frame Relay often is described as a streamlined version of X.25, offering fewer of the robust
capabilities, such as windowing and retransmission of last data that are offered in X.25. This is because
Frame Relay typically operates over WAN facilities that offer more reliable connection services and a
higher degree of reliability than the facilities available during the late 1970s and early 1980s that served
as the common platforms for X.25 WANs. As mentioned earlier, Frame Relay is strictly a Layer 2
protocol suite, whereas X.25 provides services at Layer 3 (the network layer) as well. This enables
Frame Relay to offer higher performance and greater transmission efficiency than X.25, and makes
Frame Relay suitable for current WAN applications, such as LAN interconnection.

Frame Relay Standardization
Initial proposals for the standardization of Frame Relay were presented to the Consultative Committee
on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) in 1984. Because of lack of interoperability and lack
of complete standardization, however, Frame Relay did not experience significant deployment during the
late 1980s.
A major development in Frame Relay’s history occurred in 1990 when Cisco, Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC), Northern Telecom, and StrataCom formed a consortium to focus on Frame Relay
technology development. This consortium developed a specification that conformed to the basic Frame
Relay protocol that was being discussed in CCITT, but it extended the protocol with features that provide
additional capabilities for complex internetworking environments. These Frame Relay extensions are
referred to collectively as the Local Management Interface (LMI).
Since the consortium’s specification was developed and published, many vendors have announced their
support of this extended Frame Relay definition. ANSI and CCITT have subsequently standardized their
own variations of the original LMI specification, and these standardized specifications now are more
commonly used than the original version.
Internationally, Frame Relay was standardized by the International Telecommunication
Union—Telecommunications Standards Section (ITU-T). In the United States, Frame Relay is an
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard.
Frame Relay Devices
Devices attached to a Frame Relay WAN fall into the following two general categories:
•
Data terminal equipment (DTE)
•
Data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE)
DTEs generally are considered to be terminating equipment for a specific network and typically are
located on the premises of a customer. In fact, they may be owned by the customer. Examples of DTE
devices are terminals, personal computers, routers, and bridges.
DCEs are carrier-owned internetworking devices. The purpose of DCE equipment is to provide clocking
and switching services in a network, which are the devices that actually transmit data through the WAN.
In most cases, these are packet switches. Figure 10-1 shows the relationship between the two categories
of devices.

DCEs Generally Reside Within Carrier-Operated WANs
The connection between a DTE device and a DCE device consists of both a physical layer component
and a link layer component. The physical component defines the mechanical, electrical, functional, and
procedural specifications for the connection between the devices. One of the most commonly used
physical layer interface specifications is the recommended standard (RS)-232 specification. The link
layer component defines the protocol that establishes the connection between the DTE device, such as a
router, and the DCE device, such as a switch. This chapter examines a commonly utilized protocol
specification used in WAN networking: the Frame Relay protocol.
Frame Relay Virtual Circuits
Frame Relay provides connection-oriented data link layer communication. This means that a defined
communication exists between each pair of devices and that these connections are associated with a
connection identifier. This service is implemented by using a Frame Relay virtual circuit, which is a
logical connection created between two data terminal equipment (DTE) devices across a Frame Relay
packet-switched network (PSN).
Virtual circuits provide a bidirectional communication path from one DTE device to another and are
uniquely identified by a data-link connection identifier (DLCI). A number of virtual circuits can be
multiplexed into a single physical circuit for transmission across the network. This capability often can
reduce the equipment and network complexity required to connect multiple DTE devices.
A virtual circuit can pass through any number of intermediate DCE devices (switches) located within
the Frame Relay PSN.
Frame Relay virtual circuits fall into two categories: switched virtual circuits (SVCs) and permanent
virtual circuits (PVCs).
Switched Virtual Circuits
Switched virtual circuits (SVCs) are temporary connections used in situations requiring only sporadic
data transfer between DTE devices across the Frame Relay network. A communication session across
an SVC consists of the following four operational states:

Frame Relay
Frame Relay Virtual Circuits
•
Call setup—The virtual circuit between two Frame Relay DTE devices is established.
•
Data transfer—Data is transmitted between the DTE devices over the virtual circuit.
•
Idle—The connection between DTE devices is still active, but no data is transferred. If an SVC
remains in an idle state for a defined period of time, the call can be terminated.
•
Call termination—The virtual circuit between DTE devices is terminated.
After the virtual circuit is terminated, the DTE devices must establish a new SVC if there is additional
data to be exchanged. It is expected that SVCs will be established, maintained, and terminated using the
same signaling protocols used in ISDN.
Few manufacturers of Frame Relay DCE equipment support switched virtual circuit connections.
Therefore, their actual deployment is minimal in today’s Frame Relay networks.
Previously not widely supported by Frame Relay equipment, SVCs are now the norm. Companies have
found that SVCs save money in the end because the circuit is not open all the time.
Permanent Virtual Circuits
Permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) are permanently established connections that are used for frequent
and consistent data transfers between DTE devices across the Frame Relay network. Communication
across a PVC does not require the call setup and termination states that are used with SVCs. PVCs
always operate in one of the following two operational states:
•
Data transfer—Data is transmitted between the DTE devices over the virtual circuit.
•
Idle—The connection between DTE devices is active, but no data is transferred. Unlike SVCs,
PVCs will not be terminated under any circumstances when in an idle state.
DTE devices can begin transferring data whenever they are ready because the circuit is permanently
established.
Data-Link Connection Identifier
Frame Relay virtual circuits are identified by data-link connection identifiers (DLCIs). DLCI values
typically are assigned by the Frame Relay service provider (for example, the telephone company).
Frame Relay DLCIs have local significance, which means that their values are unique in the LAN, but
not necessarily in the Frame Relay WAN.
Figure 10-2 illustrates how two different DTE devices can be assigned the same DLCI value within one
Frame Relay WAN.

Frame Relay
Congestion-Control Mechanisms
Figure 10-2
A Single Frame Relay Virtual Circuit Can Be Assigned Different DLCIs on Each End of a VC
Congestion-Control Mechanisms
Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing simple congestion-notification mechanisms
rather than explicit, per-virtual-circuit flow control. Frame Relay typically is implemented on reliable
network media, so data integrity is not sacrificed because flow control can be left to higher-layer
protocols. Frame Relay implements two congestion-notification mechanisms:
•
Forward-explicit congestion notification (FECN)
•
Backward-explicit congestion notification (BECN)
FECN and BECN each is controlled by a single bit contained in the Frame Relay frame header. The
Frame Relay frame header also contains a Discard Eligibility (DE) bit, which is used to identify less
important traffic that can be dropped during periods of congestion.
The FECN bit is part of the Address field in the Frame Relay frame header. The FECN mechanism is
initiated when a DTE device sends Frame Relay frames into the network. If the network is congested,
DCE devices (switches) set the value of the frames’ FECN bit to 1. When the frames reach the
destination DTE device, the Address field (with the FECN bit set) indicates that the frame experienced
congestion in the path from source to destination. The DTE device can relay this information to a
higher-layer protocol for processing. Depending on the implementation, flow control may be initiated,
or the indication may be ignored.
The BECN bit is part of the Address field in the Frame Relay frame header. DCE devices set the value
of the BECN bit to 1 in frames traveling in the opposite direction of frames with their FECN bit set. This
informs the receiving DTE device that a particular path through the network is congested. The DTE
device then can relay this information to a higher-layer protocol for processing. Depending on the
implementation, flow-control may be initiated, or the indication may be ignored.
Frame Relay Discard Eligibility
The Discard Eligibility (DE) bit is used to indicate that a frame has lower importance than other frames.
The DE bit is part of the Address field in the Frame Relay frame header.
DTE devices can set the value of the DE bit of a frame to 1 to indicate that the frame has lower
importance than other frames. When the network becomes congested, DCE devices will discard frames
with the DE bit set before discarding those that do not. This reduces the likelihood of critical data being
dropped by Frame Relay DCE devices during periods of congestion.

Frame Relay
Frame Relay Local Management Interface
Frame Relay Error Checking
Frame Relay uses a common error-checking mechanism known as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
The CRC compares two calculated values to determine whether errors occurred during the transmission
from source to destination. Frame Relay reduces network overhead by implementing error checking
rather than error correction. Frame Relay typically is implemented on reliable network media, so data
integrity is not sacrificed because error correction can be left to higher-layer protocols running on top of
Frame Relay.
Frame Relay Local Management Interface
The Local Management Interface (LMI) is a set of enhancements to the basic Frame Relay specification.
The LMI was developed in 1990 by Cisco Systems, StrataCom, Northern Telecom, and Digital
Equipment Corporation. It offers a number of features (called extensions) for managing complex
internetworks. Key Frame Relay LMI extensions include global addressing, virtual circuit status
messages, and multicasting.
The LMI global addressing extension gives Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI) values
global rather than local significance. DLCI values become DTE addresses that are unique in the Frame
Relay WAN. The global addressing extension adds functionality and manageability to Frame Relay
internetworks. Individual network interfaces and the end nodes attached to them, for example, can be
identified by using standard address-resolution and discovery techniques. In addition, the entire Frame
Relay network appears to be a typical LAN to routers on its periphery.
LMI virtual circuit status messages provide communication and synchronization between Frame Relay
DTE and DCE devices. These messages are used to periodically report on the status of PVCs, which
prevents data from being sent into black holes (that is, over PVCs that no longer exist).
The LMI multicasting extension allows multicast groups to be assigned. Multicasting saves bandwidth
by allowing routing updates and address-resolution messages to be sent only to specific groups of
routers. The extension also transmits reports on the status of multicast groups in update messages.
Frame Relay Network Implementation
A common private Frame Relay network implementation is to equip a T1 multiplexer with both Frame
Relay and non-Frame Relay interfaces. Frame Relay traffic is forwarded out the Frame Relay interface
and onto the data network. Non-Frame Relay traffic is forwarded to the appropriate application or
service, such as a private branch exchange (PBX) for telephone service or to a video-teleconferencing
application.
A typical Frame Relay network consists of a number of DTE devices, such as routers, connected to
remote ports on multiplexer equipment via traditional point-to-point services such as T1, fractional T1,
or 56-Kb circuits. An example of a simple Frame Relay network is shown in Figure 10-3.

A Simple Frame Relay Network Connects Various Devices to Different Services over a
WAN
The majority of Frame Relay networks deployed today are provisioned by service providers that intend
to offer transmission services to customers. This is often referred to as a public Frame Relay service.
Frame Relay is implemented in both public carrier-provided networks and in private enterprise networks.
The following section examines the two methodologies for deploying Frame Relay.
Public Carrier-Provided Networks
In public carrier-provided Frame Relay networks, the Frame Relay switching equipment is located in the
central offices of a telecommunications carrier. Subscribers are charged based on their network use but
are relieved from administering and maintaining the Frame Relay network equipment and service.
Generally, the DCE equipment also is owned by the telecommunications provider.
DTE equipment either will be customer-owned or perhaps will be owned by the telecommunications
provider as a service to the customer.
The majority of today’s Frame Relay networks are public carrier-provided networks.

Private Enterprise Networks
More frequently, organizations worldwide are deploying private Frame Relay networks. In private Frame
Relay networks, the administration and maintenance of the network are the responsibilities of the
enterprise (a private company). All the equipment, including the switching equipment, is owned by the
customer.
Frame Relay Frame Formats
To understand much of the functionality of Frame Relay, it is helpful to understand the structure of the
Frame Relay frame. Figure 10-4 depicts the basic format of the Frame Relay frame, and Figure 10-5
illustrates the LMI version of the Frame Relay frame.
Flags indicate the beginning and end of the frame. Three primary components make up
the Frame Relay frame: the header and address area, the user-data portion, and the frame check sequence
(FCS). The address area, which is 2 bytes in length, is comprised of 10
bits representing the actual circuit identifier and 6 bits of fields related to congestion management. This
identifier commonly is referred to as the data-link connection identifier (DLCI). Each of these is
discussed in the descriptions that follow.
Standard Frame Relay Frame
Standard Frame Relay frames consist of the fields illustrated in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4
Five Fields Comprise the Frame Relay Frame
The following descriptions summarize the basic Frame Relay frame fields illustrated in Figure 10-4.
•
Flags—Delimits the beginning and end of the frame. The value of this field is always the same and
is represented either as the hexadecimal number 7E or as the binary number 01111110.
•
Address—Contains the following information:
–
DLCI—The 10-bit DLCI is the essence of the Frame Relay header. This value represents the
virtual connection between the DTE device and the switch. Each virtual connection that is
multiplexed onto the physical channel will be represented by a unique DLCI. The DLCI values
have local significance only, which means that they are unique only to the physical channel on
which they reside. Therefore, devices at opposite ends of a connection can use different DLCI
values to refer to the same virtual connection.

Frame Relay
Frame Relay Frame Formats
–
Extended Address (EA)—The EA is used to indicate whether the byte in which the EA value
is 1 is the last addressing field. If the value is 1, then the current byte is determined to be the
last DLCI octet. Although current Frame Relay implementations all use a two-octet DLCI, this
capability does allow longer DLCIs to be used in the future. The eighth bit of each byte of the
Address field is used to indicate the EA.
–
C/R—The C/R is the bit that follows the most significant DLCI byte in the Address field. The
C/R bit is not currently defined.
–
Congestion Control—This consists of the 3 bits that control the Frame Relay
congestion-notification mechanisms. These are the FECN, BECN, and DE bits, which are the
last 3 bits in the Address field.
Forward-explicit congestion notification (FECN) is a single-bit field that can be set to a value
of 1 by a switch to indicate to an end DTE device, such as a router, that congestion was
experienced in the direction of the frame transmission from source to destination. The primary
benefit of the use of the FECN and BECN fields is the capability of higher-layer protocols to
react intelligently to these congestion indicators. Today, DECnet and OSI are the only
higher-layer protocols that implement these capabilities.
Backward-explicit congestion notification (BECN) is a single-bit field that, when set to a value
of 1 by a switch, indicates that congestion was experienced in the network in the direction
opposite of the frame transmission from source to destination.
Discard eligibility (DE) is set by the DTE device, such as a router, to indicate that the marked
frame is of lesser importance relative to other frames being transmitted. Frames that are marked
as “discard eligible” should be discarded before other frames in a congested network. This
allows for a basic prioritization mechanism in Frame Relay networks.
•
Data—Contains encapsulated upper-layer data. Each frame in this variable-length field includes a
user data or payload field that will vary in length up to 16,000 octets. This field serves to transport
the higher-layer protocol packet (PDU) through a Frame Relay network.
•
Frame Check Sequence—Ensures the integrity of transmitted data. This value is computed by the
source device and verified by the receiver to ensure integrity of transmission.
LMI Frame Format
Frame Relay frames that conform to the LMI specifications consist of the fields illustrated in Figure
10-5.
Figure 10-5
Nine Fields Comprise the Frame Relay That Conforms to the LMI Format
The following descriptions summarize the fields illustrated in Figure 10-5.
•
Flag—Delimits the beginning and end of the frame.
•
LMI DLCI—Identifies the frame as an LMI frame instead of a basic Frame Relay frame. The
LMI-specific DLCI value defined in the LMI consortium specification is DLCI = 1023.

Summary
Frame Relay is a networking protocol that works at the bottom two levels of the OSI reference model:
the physical and data link layers. It is an example of packet-switching technology, which enables end
stations to dynamically share network resources.
Frame Relay devices fall into the following two general categories:
•
Data terminal equipment (DTEs), which include terminals, personal computers, routers, and bridges
•
Data circuit-terminating equipment (DCEs), which transmit the data through the network and are
often carrier-owned devices (although, increasingly, enterprises are buying their own DCEs and
implementing them in their networks)
Frame Relay networks transfer data using one of the following two connection types:
•
Switched virtual circuits (SVCs), which are temporary connections that are created for each data
transfer and then are terminated when the data transfer is complete (not a widely used connection)
•
Permanent virtual circuits (PVCs), which are permanent connections
The DLCI is a value assigned to each virtual circuit and DTE device connection point in the Frame Relay
WAN. Two different connections can be assigned the same value within the same Frame Relay
WAN—one on each side of the virtual connection.
In 1990, Cisco Systems, StrataCom, Northern Telecom, and Digital Equipment Corporation developed
a set of Frame Relay enhancements called the Local Management Interface (LMI). The LMI
enhancements offer a number of features (referred to as extensions) for managing complex
internetworks, including the following:
•
Global addressing
•
Virtual circuit status messages
•
Multicasting
