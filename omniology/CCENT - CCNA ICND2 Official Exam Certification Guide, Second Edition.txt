Dedications
For my wonderful, lovely, giving wife. Thanks so much for all your support, 
encouragement, love, and respect.

Acknowledgments
The team that helped produce this book has simply been awesome. Everyone who has 
touched the book has made it better, and the team has been particularly great at helping 
catch the errors that always creep into the manuscript.
Both Teri and Steve did great jobs as technical editors. Teri’s ability to see each phrase in 
the context of an entire chapter, or whole book, was awesome, helping to catch things that 
no one would otherwise catch. Steve did his usual great job—something like 5–6 books of 
mine that he’s done now—and as always, I get to learn a lot just by reading Steve’s input. 
The depth of the reviews for this book was better than any of my other books because of 
Teri and Steve; thanks very much!
Drew Cupp got the “opportunity” to develop one of my books for the ﬁrst time in a long 
time. Drew’s insights and edits worked wonders, and a fresh set of eyes on the materials 
copied from the previous edition strengthened those parts a lot. All while juggling things in 
the middle of a whirlwind schedule—thanks, Drew, for doing a great job!
The wonderful and mostly hidden production folks did their usual great job. When I saw 
how they reworded something, and thought “Wow, why didn’t I write that?” it made me 
appreciate the kind of team we have at Cisco Press. The ﬁnal copy edit, ﬁgure review, and 
pages review process required a fair amount of juggling and effort as well—especially for 
the extra quality initiatives we’ve implemented. Thanks to you all!
Brett Bartow again was the executive editor on the book, as has been the case for almost all 
the books I’ve helped write. Brett did his usual great and patient job, being my advocate in 
so many ways. Brett, thanks for doing so many things on so many levels to help us be 
successful together.
Additionally, there are several folks who don’t have any direct stake in the book who also 
helped it along. Thanks to Frank Knox for the discussions on the exams, why they’re so 
difﬁcult, and how to handle troubleshooting. Thanks to Rus Healy for the help with 
wireless. Thanks to the Mikes at Skyline for making my schedule work to get this book (and 
the ICND1 book) out the door. And thanks to the course and exam teams at Cisco for the 
great early communications and interactions about the changes to the courses and exams.
And as always, a special thanks to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ—thanks for helping me 
rejoice in you even while doing the ﬁnal reviews of 1400 pages of manuscript in just a few 
weeks!

Introduction
Congratulations! If you’re reading far enough to look at the introduction to this book, 
you’ve probably already decided to go for your Cisco certiﬁcation. If you want to succeed 
as a technical person in the networking industry, you need to know Cisco. Cisco has a 
ridiculously high market share in the router and switch marketplace, with more than 80 
percent market share in some markets. In many geographies and markets around the world, 
networking equals Cisco. If you want to be taken seriously as a network engineer, Cisco 
certiﬁcation makes perfect sense.
Historically speaking, the ﬁrst entry-level Cisco certiﬁcation has been the Cisco Certiﬁed 
Network Associate (CCNA) certiﬁcation, ﬁrst offered in 1998. The ﬁrst three versions of 
the CCNA certiﬁcation (1998, 2000, and 2002) required that you pass a single exam to 
become certiﬁed. However, over time, the exam kept growing, both in the amount of 
material covered and in the difﬁculty level of the questions. So, for the fourth major revision 
of the exams, announced in 2003, Cisco continued with a single certiﬁcation (CCNA), but 
offered two options for the exams to get certiﬁed: a single-exam option and a two-exam 
option. The two-exam option allowed people to study roughly half of the material, and take 
and pass one exam, before moving on to the next.
Cisco announced changes to the CCNA certiﬁcation and exams in June 2007. This 
announcement includes many changes, most notably:
■
The exams collectively cover a broader range of topics.
■
The exams increase the focus on proving the test taker’s skills (as compared with just 
testing knowledge).
■
Cisco created a new entry-level certiﬁcation: the Cisco Certiﬁed Entry Network 
Technician (CCENT) certiﬁcation.
For the current certiﬁcations, announced in June 2007, Cisco created the ICND1 (640-822) 
and ICND2 (640-816) exams, along with the CCNA (640-802) exam. To become CCNA 
certiﬁed, you can pass both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, or just pass the CCNA exam. 
The CCNA exam simply covers all the topics on the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, giving you 
two options for gaining your CCNA certiﬁcation. The two-exam path gives those people 
with less experience a chance to study for a smaller set of topics at a time, whereas the one-
exam option provides a more cost-effective certiﬁcation path for those who want to prepare 
for all the topics at once.
Although the two-exam option will be useful for some certiﬁcation candidates, Cisco 
designed the ICND1 exam with a much more important goal in mind. The CCNA 
certiﬁcation has grown to the point that it tested knowledge and skills beyond what an 

xxviii 
entry-level network technician would need to have. Cisco needed a certiﬁcation that was 
more reﬂective of the skills required for entry-level networking jobs. So, Cisco designed its 
Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices 1 (ICND1) course, and the corresponding 
ICND1 640-822 exam, to include the knowledge and skills most needed by an entry-level 
technician in a small enterprise network. And to show that you have the skills required for 
those entry-level jobs, Cisco created a new certiﬁcation, CCENT, which is attained by 
passing the ICND1 exam.
Figure I-1 shows the basic organization of the certiﬁcations and the exams used for getting 
your CCENT and CCNA certiﬁcations. (Note that no separate certiﬁcation exists for 
passing the ICND2 exam.)
Figure I-1
Cisco Entry-Level Certiﬁcations and Exams
As you can see from the ﬁgure, while the CCENT certiﬁcation is available by taking the 
ICND1 exam, you do not have to ﬁrst be CCENT certiﬁed before getting your CCNA 
certiﬁcation—you can choose to just take the CCNA exam and bypass the CCENT 
certiﬁcation.
The ICND1 and ICND2 exams cover different sets of topics, with a minor amount of 
overlap. For example, ICND1 covers IP addressing and subnetting, while ICND2 covers a 
more complicated use of subnetting called variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), so 
ICND2 must then cover subnetting to some degree. The CCNA exam covers all the topics 
covered on both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams.
While the popularity of the CCENT certiﬁcation cannot be seen until a few years have 
passed, certainly the Cisco CCNA certiﬁcation enjoys a position as the most popular entry-
level networking certiﬁcation program. A CCNA certiﬁcation proves that you have a ﬁrm 
foundation in the most important components of the Cisco product line—namely, routers 
and switches. It also proves that you have a broad knowledge of protocols and networking 
technologies.

Format of the CCNA Exams
The ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA exams all follow the same general format. When you get 
to the testing center and check in, the proctor will give you some general instructions and 
then take you into a quiet room with a PC. When you’re at the PC, you have a few things to 
do before the timer starts on your exam. For example, you can take a sample quiz, just to 
get accustomed to the PC and to the testing engine. Anyone who has user-level skills in 
getting around a PC should have no problems with the testing environment. Additionally, 
Chapter 18, “Final Preparation,” points to a Cisco website at which you can see a demo of 
the Cisco test engine.
When you start the exam, you are asked a series of questions. You answer a question and 
then move on to the next question. The exam engine does not let you go back and change 
your answer. Yes, that’s true—when you move on to the next question, that’s it for the 
earlier question.
The exam questions can be in one of the following formats:
■
Multiple-choice (MC)
■
Testlet
■
Drag-and-drop (DND)
■
Simulated lab (Sim)
■
Simlet
The ﬁrst three types of questions are relatively common in many testing environments. The 
multiple-choice format simply requires that you point and click a circle beside the correct 
answer(s). Cisco traditionally tells you how many answers you need to choose, and the 
testing software prevents you from choosing too many answers. Testlets are questions with 
one general scenario, with multiple MC questions about the overall scenario. Drag-and-
drop questions require you to click and hold the mouse button, move a button or icon to 
another area, and release the mouse button to place the object somewhere else—typically 
into a list. So, for some questions, to get the question correct, you might need to put a list 
of ﬁve things into the proper order.
The last two types both use a network simulator to ask questions. Interestingly, the two 
types allow Cisco to assess two very different skills. First, Sim questions generally describe 
a problem, and your task is to conﬁgure one or more routers and switches to ﬁx the problem. 
The exam then grades the question based on the conﬁguration you changed or added. 
Interestingly, Sim questions are the only questions that Cisco (to date) has openly 
conﬁrmed that partial credit is given.

xxx 
The Simlet questions might well be the most difﬁcult style of question on the exams. Simlet 
questions also use a network simulator, but instead of answering the question by changing 
the conﬁguration, the question includes one or more MC questions. The questions require 
that you use the simulator to examine the current behavior of a network, interpreting the 
output of any show commands that you can remember to answer the question. While Sim 
questions require you to troubleshoot problems related to a conﬁguration, Simlets require 
you to both analyze working networks and networks with problems, correlating show 
command output with your knowledge of networking theory and conﬁguration commands.
What’s on the CCNA Exam(s)?
Ever since I was in grade school, whenever the teacher announced that we were having a 
test soon, someone would always ask, “What’s on the test?” Even in college, people would 
try to get more information about what would be on the exams. At heart, the goal is to know 
what to study hard, what to study a little, and what not to study.
Cisco does want the public to know both the variety of topics, and an idea about the kinds 
of knowledge and skills required for each topic, for every Cisco certiﬁcation exam. To that 
end, Cisco publishes a set of exam objectives for each exam. The objectives list the speciﬁc 
topics, like IP addressing, RIP, and VLANs. The objectives also imply the kinds of skills 
required for that topic. For example, one objective might start with “Describe...” and 
another might begin with “Describe, conﬁgure, and troubleshoot....” The second objective 
clearly states that you need a thorough and deep understanding of that topic. By listing the 
topics and skill level, Cisco helps us all prepare for its exams.
While the exam objectives are helpful, keep in mind that Cisco adds a disclaimer that the 
posted exam topics for all its certiﬁcation exams are guidelines. Cisco makes the effort to 
keep the exam questions within the conﬁnes of the stated exam objectives, and I know from 
talking to those involved that every question is analyzed for whether it ﬁts within the stated 
exam topics.
ICND1 Exam Topics
Table I-1 lists the exam topics for the ICND1 exam, with the ICND2 exam topics following 
in Table I-2. Although the posted exam topics are not numbered at Cisco.com, Cisco Press 
does number the exam topics for easier reference. The table also notes the book parts in 
which each exam topic is covered. Because the exam topics might change over time, 
double-check the exam topics as listed on Cisco.com (speciﬁcally, http://www.cisco.com/
go/ccna). If Cisco does happen to add exam topics at a later date, note that Appendix C of 
this book describes how to go to http://www.ciscopress.com and download additional 
information about those newly added topics.

CCNA Exam Topics
In the previous version of the exams, the CCNA exam covered a lot of what was in the 
ICND (640-811) exam, plus some coverage of topics in the INTRO (640-821) exam. The 
new CCNA exam (640-802) covers all the topics on both the ICND1 (640-822) and ICND2 
(640-816) exams. One of the reasons for a more balanced coverage in the exams is that 
some of the topics that used to be in the second exam have been moved to the ﬁrst exam.

ICND2 Exam Topics (Continued)

xxxvi 
The new CCNA (640-802) exam covers all topics in both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams. 
The ofﬁcial CCNA 640-802 exam topics, posted at http://www.cisco.com, include all the 
topics listed in Table I-2 for the ICND2 exam, plus most of the exam topics for the ICND1 
exam listed in Table I-1. The only exam topics from these two tables that are not listed as 
CCNA exam topics are the topics highlighted in gray in Table I-1. However, note that the 
gray topics are still covered on the CCNA 640-802 exam. Those topics are just not listed in 
the CCNA exam topics because one of the ICND2 exam topics refers to the same concepts.
ICND1 and ICND2 Course Outlines
Another way to get some direction about the topics on the exams is to look at the course 
outlines for the related courses. Cisco offers two authorized CCNA-related courses: 
Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices 1 (ICND1) and Interconnecting Cisco Network 
Devices 2 (ICND2). Cisco authorizes Certiﬁed Learning Solutions Providers (CLSP) and 
Certiﬁed Learning Partners (CLP) to deliver these classes. These authorized companies can 
also create unique custom course books using this material, in some cases to teach classes 
geared toward passing the CCNA exam.
About the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Official Exam 
Certification Guide and CCNA ICND2 Official Exam 
Certification Guide
As mentioned earlier, Cisco has separated the content covered by the CCNA exam into two 
parts: topics typically used by engineers who work in a small enterprise network (ICND1), 
with the additional topics commonly used by engineers in medium-sized enterprises being 
covered by the ICND2 exam. Likewise, the Cisco Press CCNA Exam Certiﬁcation Guide 
series includes two books for CCNA—CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide and CCNA ICND2 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. These two books cover the 
breadth of topics on each exam, typically to a little more depth than is required for the 
exams, just to ensure that the books prepare you for the more difﬁcult exam questions.
The following sections list the variety of features in both this book and CCENT/CCNA 
ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. Both books have the same basic features, so if 
you are reading both this book and the ICND1 book, you don’t need to read the introduction 
to both books. Also, for those of you who are using both books to prepare for the CCNA 
640-802 exam (rather than taking the two-exam option), the end of this introduction lists a 
suggested reading plan.
Objectives and Methods
The most important and somewhat obvious objective of this book is to help you pass the 
ICND2 exam or the CCNA exam. In fact, if the primary objective of this book were 
different, the book’s title would be misleading! However, the methods used in this book to 

 xxxvii
help you pass the exams are also designed to make you much more knowledgeable about 
how to do your job.
This book uses several key methodologies to help you discover the exam topics on which 
you need more review, to help you fully understand and remember those details, and to help 
you prove to yourself that you have retained your knowledge of those topics. So, this book 
does not try to help you pass the exams only by memorization, but by truly learning and 
understanding the topics. The CCNA certiﬁcation is the foundation for many of the Cisco 
professional certiﬁcations, and it would be a disservice to you if this book did not help you 
truly learn the material. Therefore, this book helps you pass the CCNA exam by using the 
following methods:
■
Helping you discover which exam topics you have not mastered
■
Providing explanations and information to ﬁll in your knowledge gaps
■
Supplying exercises that enhance your ability to recall and deduce the answers to test 
questions
■
Providing practice exercises on the topics and the testing process through test questions 
on the CD
Book Features
To help you customize your study time using these books, the core chapters have several 
features that help you make the best use of your time:
■
“Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes: Each chapter begins with a quiz that helps you 
determine the amount of time you need to spend studying that chapter.
■
Foundation Topics: These are the core sections of each chapter. They explain the 
protocols, concepts, and conﬁguration for the topics in that chapter.
■
Exam Preparation Tasks: At the end of the Foundation Topics section of each 
chapter, the Exam Preparation Tasks section lists a series of study activities that should 
be done at the end of the chapter. Each chapter includes the activities that make the 
most sense for studying the topics in that chapter. The activities include the following:
—  Key Topics Review: The Key Topics icon is shown next to the most 
important items in the Foundation Topics section of the chapter. The Key 
Topics Review activity lists the key topics from the chapter, and the page 
number. While the contents of the entire chapter could be on the exam, you 
should deﬁnitely know the information listed in each key topic, so these 
should be reviewed.

xxxviii 
—  Complete Tables and Lists from Memory: To help you exercise your 
memory and memorize some lists of facts, many of the more important lists 
and tables from the chapter are included in Appendix J on the CD. This 
document lists only partial information, allowing you to complete the table 
or list. Appendix K lists the same tables and lists, completed, for easy 
comparison.
—  Deﬁnition of Key Terms: While the exams are unlikely to ask a question like 
“Deﬁne this term,” the CCNA exams do require that you learn and know a lot 
of networking terminology. This section lists the most important terms from 
the chapter, asking you to write a short deﬁnition and compare your answer 
to the glossary at the end of the book.
—  Command Reference Tables: Some book chapters cover a large amount of 
conﬁguration and EXEC commands. These tables list the commands 
introduced in the chapter, along with an explanation. For exam preparation, 
use them for reference, but also read the tables once when performing the 
Exam Preparation Tasks to make sure that you remember what all the 
commands do.
■
CD-based Practice Exam: The companion CD contains an exam engine (from Boson 
software, http://www.boson.com) that includes a large number of exam-realistic 
practice questions. You can take simulated ICND2 exams, as well as simulated CCNA 
exams, with the CD in this book. (You can take simulated ICND1 and CCNA exams 
with the CD in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.) 
■
Subnetting Videos: The companion DVD contains a series of videos that show how 
to calculate various facts about IP addressing and subnetting, in particular using the 
shortcuts described in this book.
■
Subnetting Practice: CD Appendix D contains a large set of subnetting practice 
problems, with the answers and with explanations of how the answers were found. This 
is a great resource to get ready to do subnetting well and fast.
■
CD-based Practice Scenarios: CD Appendix F contains several networking scenarios 
for additional study. These scenarios describe various networks and requirements, 
taking you through conceptual design, conﬁguration, and veriﬁcation. These scenarios 
are useful for building your hands-on skills, even if you do not have lab gear.

appendix includes instructions on how to check whether a later version of 
Appendix C is available online.)
—  Glossary: The glossary contains deﬁnitions for all the terms listed in the 
“Deﬁnitions of Key Terms” section at the conclusion of Chapters 1–17.

xlii 
■
Part VII: Appendixes (on CD)
The following appendixes are available in PDF format on the CD that accompanies this 
book:
—  Appendix D, “Subnetting Practice”: Although not covered in any of the 
chapters printed in this book, subnetting is easily the most important 
prerequisite assumed skill for the ICND2 exam. This appendix, as well as 
Appendixes E, H, and I, include materials from CCENT/CCNA ICND1 
Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide for those of you that bought this book, but 
not the ICND1 book. In particular, this appendix includes a large number of 
subnetting practice problems, with the answers listed. The answers use both 
binary and decimal-shortcut processes described in the ICND1 book’s 
Chapter 12; Appendix H of this book is a duplicate of ICND1’s Chapter 12.
—  Appendix E, “Subnetting Reference Pages”: This appendix summarizes 
the process to ﬁnd the answer to several key subnetting questions, with the 
details on a single page. The goal is to give you a handy reference page to 
refer to when practicing subnetting.
—  Appendix F, “Additional Scenarios”: One method to improve your 
troubleshooting and network analysis skills is to examine as many unique 
network scenarios as is possible, think about them, and then get some 
feedback as to whether you came to the right conclusions. This appendix 
provides several such scenarios.
—  Appendix G, “Video Scenario Reference”: The DVD includes several 
subnetting videos that show how to use the processes covered in Appendix H 
(copied from ICND1’s Chapter 12). This appendix contains copies of the key 
elements from those videos, which can be useful when watching the videos 
(so that you do not have to keep moving back and forth in the video).
—  Appendix H, “ICND1 Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting”: This 
appendix is a duplicate of Chapter 12 from CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. This chapter explains IP addressing and 
subnetting, which is considered prerequisite knowledge for the ICND2 exam. 
Appendix H is included with this book for those of you who do not have a 
copy of CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, but you 
need to review and learn more about subnetting.
—  Appendix I, “ICND1 Chapter 17: WAN Conﬁguration”: This appendix is 
a duplicate of Chapter 17 from CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. Chapter 12 of this book (ICND2), “Point-to-Point 
WANs,” makes a suggestion to review a few prerequisite points as listed in 
this chapter. This chapter is included in this book for those of you who do not 
have a copy of CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.

 xliii
—  Appendix J, “Memory Tables”: This appendix holds the key tables and lists 
from each chapter, with some of the content removed. You can print this 
appendix and, as a memory exercise, complete the tables and lists. The goal 
is to help you memorize facts that can be useful on the exams.
—  Appendix K, “Memory Tables Answer Key”: This appendix contains the 
answer key for the exercises in Appendix J.
—  Appendix L, “ICND2 Open-Ended Questions”: This appendix is a 
holdover from previous editions of this book. The older edition had some 
open-ended questions for the purpose of helping you study for the exam, but 
the newer features make these questions unnecessary. For convenience, the 
old questions are included here, unedited since the last edition.
How to Use This Book to Prepare for the 
ICND2 (640-816)  Exam
This book was designed with two primary goals in mind: to help you study for the ICND2 
exam and to help you study for the CCNA exam by using both this book and the CCENT/
CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. Using this book to prepare for the ICND2 
exam is straightforward—read each chapter in succession, and follow the study suggestions 
in Chapter 18, “Final Preparation.”
For the core chapters of this book (Chapters 1–17), you do have some choices as to how 
much of the chapter you read. In some cases, you might already know most of or all the 
information covered in a given chapter. To help you decide how much time to spend on each 
chapter, the chapters begin with a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. If you get all the quiz 
questions correct, or just miss one question, you might want to skip to the end of the chapter 
and the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section, and do those activities. Figure I-2 shows the 
overall plan.

When you have completed Chapters 1–17, you can then use the guidance listed in Chapter 
18 to detail the rest of the exam preparation tasks. That chapter includes the following 
suggestions:
■
Check http://www.ciscopress.com for the latest copy of Appendix C, which can 
include additional topics for study.
■
Practice subnetting using the tools available in the CD appendixes.
■
Repeat the tasks in all chapters’ “Exam Preparation Tasks” chapter-ending sections.
■
Review the scenarios in CD Appendix F.
■
Review all the “Do I Know This Already?” questions.
■
Practice the exam using the exam engine.
How to Use These Books to Prepare for the CCNA 
640-802 Exam
If you plan to get your CCNA certiﬁcation using the one-exam option of taking the CCNA 
640-802 exam, you can use this book along with CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. If you’ve not yet bought either book, you can generally get the pair 
cheaper by buying both books as a two-book set, called the CCNA Certiﬁcation Library.
These two books were designed to be used together when studying for the CCNA exam. 
You have two options for the order in which to read the two books. The ﬁrst and most 
obvious option is to read the ICND1 book, and then move on to this (ICND2) book. The 
other option is to read all of ICND1’s coverage of one topic area, then read ICND2’s 
coverage of the same topics, and then go back to ICND1 again. Figure I-3 outlines my 
suggested option for reading the two books.

Both reading-plan options have some beneﬁts. Moving back and forth between books can 
help you to focus on one general topic at a time. However, note that some overlap exists 
between the two exams, so you ﬁnd some overlap between the two books as well. From 
reader comments about the previous edition of these books, those readers who were new to 
networking tended to do better by completing all of the ﬁrst book and then moving on to 
the second, while readers that had more experience and knowledge before starting the 
books tended to prefer to follow a reading plan like the one shown in Figure I-3.
Note that for ﬁnal preparation, you can use the ﬁnal chapter (Chapter 18) of this book, 
rather than the ﬁnal preparation chapter (Chapter 18) of the ICND1 book.
In addition to the ﬂow shown in Figure I-3, when studying for the CCNA exam (rather than 
for the ICND1 and ICND2 exams), you must master IP subnetting before moving on to the 
IP routing and routing protocol parts (Parts II and III) of this book. This book does not 
review subnetting or the underlying math in the printed text, assuming that you know how 
to ﬁnd the answers. Those ICND2 chapters, particularly Chapter 5 (“VLSM and Route 
Summarization”), will be much easier to understand if you can easily do the related 
subnetting math.

Cisco might make changes that affect the CCNA certiﬁcation from time to time. You should 
always check http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna for the latest details.
The CCNA certiﬁcation is arguably the most important Cisco certiﬁcation, with the new 
CCENT certiﬁcation possibly surpassing CCNA in the future. CCNA certainly is the most 
popular Cisco certiﬁcation, is required for several other certiﬁcations, and is the ﬁrst step 
in distinguishing yourself as someone who has proven knowledge of Cisco.
CCNA ICND2 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide is designed to help you attain CCNA 
certiﬁcation. This is the CCNA ICND2 certiﬁcation book from the only Cisco-authorized 
publisher. We at Cisco Press believe that this book certainly can help you achieve CCNA 
certiﬁcation—but the real work is up to you! I trust that your time will be well spent.

An engineer has just installed four new 2960 switches and connected the switches to 
each other using crossover cables. All the interfaces are in an “up and up” state. The 
engineer conﬁgures each switch with the VTP domain name Fred and leaves all four 
switches in VTP server mode. The engineer adds VLAN 33 at 9:00 a.m., and then 
within 30 seconds, issues a show vlan brief command on the other three switches, but 
does not ﬁnd VLAN 33 on the other three switches. Which answer gives the most likely 
reason for the problem in this case?
a.
VTP requires that all switches have the same VTP password.
b.
The engineer should have been more patient and waited for SW1 to send its next 
periodic VTP update.

Foundation Topics
A Cisco Catalyst switch uses default settings that allow it to work with no additional 
conﬁguration, right out of the box. However, most installations conﬁgure three major types 
of switch features: VLANs, as covered in this chapter; Spanning Tree, as covered in Chapter 
2; and a variety of administrative settings that do not impact the forwarding behavior of the 
switch, which are explained in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide.
All published objectives for the ICND1 exam are considered to be prerequisites for the 
ICND2 exam, although the ICND2 exam does not cover those topics as an end to 
themselves. For example, as described in the ICND1 book, switches learn MAC addresses 
by examining the source MAC address of incoming frames, and make forwarding/ﬁltering 
decisions based on the destination MAC address of the frames. That book’s LAN chapters 
(Chapter 3 plus Chapters 7 through 11) also explain the concepts of autonegotiation, 
collisions, collision domains, and broadcast domains. So, while the ICND2 exam might not 
have a speciﬁc question on these topics, these topics might be required to answer a question 
related to the exam objectives for the ICND2 exam. And, of course, the CCNA exam covers 
all the topics and objectives for both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams.
Besides the base concepts, the ICND1 book also describes a wide variety of small 
conﬁguration tasks that either provide access to each switch or then help secure the switch 
when access has been granted. A switch should be conﬁgured with an IP address, subnet 
mask, and default gateway, allowing remote access to the switch. Along with that access, 
Cisco recommends several actions for better security beyond simply physically securing 
the router to prevent access from the switch console. In particular, passwords should be 
conﬁgured, and for remote access, Secure Shell (SSH) should be used instead of Telnet, if 
possible. The HTTP service should also be disabled, and banners should be conﬁgured to 
warn potential attackers away. Additionally, each switch’s syslog messages should be 
monitored for any messages relating to various types of attacks.
The three chapters in this ﬁrst part of the book pick up the LAN story, explaining the topics 
speciﬁcally related to ICND2 exam objectives. In particular, this chapter examines the 
concepts related to VLANs, and then covers the conﬁguration and operation of VLANs. 
The ﬁrst major section of this chapter explains the core concepts, including how to pass 
VLAN trafﬁc between switches using VLAN trunks, and how the Cisco-proprietary VLAN 
Trunking Protocol (VTP) aids the process of conﬁguring VLANs in a campus LAN. The 
second major section of this chapter shows how to conﬁgure VLANs and VLAN trunks, 
how to statically assign interfaces to a VLAN, and how to conﬁgure a switch so that a phone 
and PC on the same interface are in two different VLANs. The ﬁnal major section covers 
VTP conﬁguration and troubleshooting.

10     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
Virtual LAN Concepts
Before understanding VLANs, you must ﬁrst have a speciﬁc understanding of the deﬁnition 
of a LAN. Although you can think about LANs from many perspectives, one perspective in 
particular can help you understand VLANs:
A LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain.
A broadcast domain includes the set of all LAN-connected devices that when any of the 
devices sends a broadcast frame, all the other devices get a copy of the frame. So, you can 
think of a LAN and a broadcast domain as being basically the same thing.
Without VLANs, a switch considers all its interfaces to be in the same broadcast domain; 
in others words, all connected devices are in the same LAN. With VLANs, a switch can put 
some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another, creating multiple 
broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by the switch are called 
virtual LANs. Figure 1-1 shows an example, with two VLANs and two devices in each 
VLAN.
Figure 1-1
Sample Network with Two VLANs Using One Switch
Putting hosts into different VLANs provides many beneﬁts, although the reasons might not 
be obvious from Figure 1-1. The key to appreciating these beneﬁts is to realize that a 
broadcast sent by one host in a VLAN will be received and processed by all the other hosts

in the VLAN, but not by hosts in a different VLAN. The more hosts in a single VLAN, the 
larger the number of broadcasts, and the greater the processing time required by each host 
in the VLAN. Additionally, anyone can download several free software packages, 
generically called protocol analyzer software, which can capture all the frames received by 
a host. (Visit Wireshark, at http://www.wireshark.org, for a good free analyzer package.) As 
a result, larger VLANs expose larger numbers and types of broadcasts to other hosts, 
exposing more frames to hosts that could be used by an attacker that uses protocol analyzer 
software to try and perform a reconnaissance attack. These are just a few reasons for 
separating hosts into different VLANs. The following summarizes the most common 
reasons:
■
To create more ﬂexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that work  
together, instead of by physical location
■
To segment devices into smaller LANs (broadcast domains) to reduce overhead caused 
to each host in the VLAN
■
To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to 
a single access switch
■
To enforce better security by keeping hosts that work with sensitive data on a separate 
VLAN
■
To separate trafﬁc sent by an IP phone from trafﬁc sent by PCs connected to the phones
This chapter does not examine the reasons for VLANs in any more depth, but it does closely 
examine the mechanics of how VLANs work across multiple Cisco switches, including the 
required conﬁguration. To that end, the next section examines VLAN trunking, a feature 
required when installing a VLAN that exists on more than one LAN switch.
Trunking with ISL and 802.1Q
When using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, the switches 
need to use VLAN trunking on the segments between the switches. VLAN trunking causes 
the switches to use a process called VLAN tagging, by which the sending switch adds 
another header to the frame before sending it over the trunk. This extra VLAN header 
includes a VLAN identiﬁer (VLAN ID) ﬁeld so that the sending switch can list the VLAN 
ID and the receiving switch can then know in what VLAN each frame belongs. Figure 1-2 
outlines the basic idea.

12     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
Figure 1-2
VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches  
The use of trunking allows switches to pass frames from multiple VLANs over a single 
physical connection. For example, Figure 1-2 shows switch 1 receiving a broadcast frame 
on interface Fa0/1 at Step 1. To ﬂood the frame, switch 1 needs to forward the broadcast 
frame to switch 2. However, switch 1 needs to let switch 2 know that the frame is part of 
VLAN 1. So, as shown at Step 2, before sending the frame, switch 1 adds a VLAN header 
to the original Ethernet frame, with the VLAN header listing a VLAN ID of 1 in this case. 
When switch 2 receives the frame, it sees that the frame was from a device in VLAN 1, so 
switch 2 knows that it should only forward the broadcast out its own interfaces in VLAN 1. 
Switch 2 removes the VLAN header, forwarding the original frame out its interfaces in 
VLAN 1 (Step 3).
For another example, consider the case when the device on switch 1’s Fa0/5 interface sends 
a broadcast. Switch 1 sends the broadcast out port Fa0/6 (because that port is in VLAN 2) 
and out Fa0/23 (because it is a trunk, meaning that it supports multiple different VLANs). 
Switch 1 adds a trunking header to the frame, listing a VLAN ID of 2. Switch 2 strips off 
the trunking header after noticing that the frame is part of VLAN 2, so switch 2 knows to 
forward the frame out only ports Fa0/5 and Fa0/6, and not ports Fa0/1 and Fa0/2.
Cisco switches support two different trunking protocols: Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE 
802.1Q. Trunking protocols provide several features, most importantly that they deﬁne

headers which identify the VLAN ID, as shown in Figure 1-2. They do have some 
differences as well, as discussed next.
ISL 
Cisco created ISL many years before the IEEE created the 802.1Q standard VLAN trunking 
protocol. Because ISL is Cisco proprietary, it can be used only between two Cisco switches 
that support ISL. (Some newer Cisco switches do not even support ISL, instead supporting 
only the standardized alternative, 802.1Q.) ISL fully encapsulates each original Ethernet 
frame in an ISL header and trailer. The original Ethernet frame inside the ISL header and 
trailer remains unchanged. Figure 1-3 shows the framing for ISL.
Figure 1-3
ISL Header
The ISL header includes several ﬁelds, but most importantly, the ISL header VLAN ﬁeld 
provides a place to encode the VLAN number. By tagging a frame with the correct VLAN 
number inside the header, the sending switch can ensure that the receiving switch knows to 
which VLAN the encapsulated frame belongs. Also, the source and destination addresses 
in the ISL header use MAC addresses of the sending and receiving switch, as opposed to 
the devices that actually sent the original frame. Other than that, the details of the ISL 
header are not that important.
IEEE 802.1Q
The IEEE standardizes many of the protocols that relate to LANs today, and VLAN 
trunking is no exception. Years after Cisco created ISL, the IEEE completed work on the 
802.1Q standard, which deﬁnes a different way to do trunking. Today, 802.1Q has become 
the more popular trunking protocol, with Cisco not even supporting ISL in some of its 
newer models of LAN switches, including the 2960 switches used in the examples in this 
book.
802.1Q uses a different style of header than does ISL to tag frames with a VLAN number. 
In fact, 802.1Q does not actually encapsulate the original frame in another Ethernet header 
and trailer. Instead, 802.1Q inserts an extra 4-byte VLAN header into the original frame’s 
Ethernet header. As a result, unlike ISL, the frame still has the same original source and 
destination MAC addresses. Also, because the original header has been expanded, 802.1Q 
encapsulation forces a recalculation of the original frame check sequence (FCS) ﬁeld in the 
ISL Header

shows the 802.1Q header and framing of the revised Ethernet header.

ISL and 802.1Q Compared
So far, the text has described one major similarity between ISL and 802.1Q, with a couple 
of differences. The similarity is that both ISL and 802.1Q deﬁne a VLAN header that has a 
VLAN ID ﬁeld. However, each trunking protocol uses a different overall header, plus one 
is standardized (802.1Q) and one is proprietary (ISL). This section points out a few other 
key comparison points between the two.
Both trunking protocols support the same number of VLANs, speciﬁcally 4094 VLANs. 
Both protocols use 12 bits of the VLAN header to number VLANs, supporting 212, or 4096, 
VLAN IDs, minus two reserved values (0 and 4095). Of the supported VLANs, note that 
VLAN IDs 1–1005 are considered to be normal range VLANs, whereas values higher than 
1005 are called extended range VLANs. This distinction matters in regard to the VLAN 
Trunking Protocol (VTP), which is covered in the next section.
ISL and 802.1Q both support a separate instance of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for each 
VLAN, but with different implementation details, as explained in Chapter 2. For campus 
LANs with redundant links, using only one instance of STP means that some links sit idle 
under normal operations, with those links only being used when another link fails. By 
supporting multiple instances of STP, engineers can tune the STP parameters so that under 
normal operations, some VLANs’ trafﬁc uses one set of links and other VLANs’ trafﬁc uses 
other links, taking advantage of all the links in the network.
NOTE
802.1Q has not always supported multiple instances of STP, so some older 
references might have accurately stated that, at that time, 802.1Q only supported a single 
instance of STP.

Virtual LAN Concepts     15
One ﬁnal key difference between ISL and 802.1Q covered here relates to a feature called 
the native VLAN. 802.1Q deﬁnes one VLAN on each trunk as the native VLAN, whereas 
ISL does not use the concept. By default, the 802.1Q native VLAN is VLAN 1. By 
deﬁnition, 802.1Q simply does not add an 802.1Q header to frames in the native VLAN. 
When the switch on the other side of the trunk receives a frame that does not have an 
802.1Q header, the receiving switch knows that the frame is part of the native VLAN. Note 
that because of this behavior, both switches must agree which VLAN is the native VLAN.
The 802.1Q native VLAN provides some interesting functions, mainly to support 
connections to devices that do not understand trunking. For example, a Cisco switch could 
be cabled to a switch that does not understand 802.1Q trunking. The Cisco switch could 
send frames in the native VLAN—meaning that the frame has no trunking header—so the 
other switch would understand the frame. The native VLAN concept gives switches the 
capability of at least passing trafﬁc in one VLAN (the native VLAN), which can allow some 
basic functions, like reachability to telnet into a switch.
Table 1-2 summarizes the key features and points of comparison between ISL and 802.1Q.
IP Subnets and VLANs
When including VLANs in a design, the devices in a VLAN need to be in the same subnet. 
Following the same design logic, devices in different VLANs need to be in different 
subnets. 
Because of these design rules, many people think that a VLAN is a subnet and that a subnet 
is a VLAN. Although not completely true, because a VLAN is a Layer 2 concept and a 
subnet is a Layer 3 concept, the general idea is reasonable because the same devices in a 
single VLAN are the same devices in a single subnet.

16     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
As with all IP subnets, for a host in one subnet to forward packets to a host in another 
subnet, at least one router must be involved. For example, consider Figure 1-5, which shows 
a switch with three VLANs, shown inside the dashed lines, with some of the logic used 
when a host in VLAN 1 sends an IP packet to a host in VLAN 2.
Figure 1-5
Routing Between VLANs
In this case, when Fred sends a packet to Wilma’s IP address, Fred sends the packet to his 
default router, because Wilma’s IP address is in a different subnet. The router receives the 
frame, with a VLAN header that implies the frame is part of VLAN 1. The router makes a 
forwarding decision, sending the frame back out the same physical link, but this time with 
a VLAN trunking header that lists VLAN 2. The switch forwards the frame in VLAN 2 to 
Wilma.
It might seem a bit inefﬁcient to send the packet from the switch, to the router, and right 
back to the switch—and it is. A more likely option in real campus LANs today is to use a 
switch called either a multilayer switch or a Layer 3 switch. These switches can perform 
both Layer 2 switching and Layer 3 routing, combining the router function shown in Figure 
1-5 into the switch.
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
The Cisco-proprietary VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) provides a means by which Cisco 
switches can exchange VLAN conﬁguration information. In particular, VTP advertises 
about the existence of each VLAN based on its VLAN ID and the VLAN name. However, 
VTP does not advertise the details about which switch interfaces are assigned to each 
VLAN.
Because this book has not yet shown how to conﬁgure VLANs, to better appreciate VTP, 
consider this example of what VTP can do. Imagine that a network has ten switches

connected somehow using VLAN trunks, and each switch has at least one port assigned to 
a VLAN with VLAN ID 3 and the name Accounting. Without VTP, an engineer would have 
to log in to all ten switches and enter the same two conﬁg commands to create the VLAN 
and deﬁne its name. With VTP, you would create VLAN 3 on one switch, and the other nine 
switches would learn about VLAN 3 and its name using VTP.
VTP deﬁnes a Layer 2 messaging protocol that the switches use to exchange VLAN 
conﬁguration information. When a switch changes its VLAN conﬁguration—in other 
words, when a VLAN is added or deleted, or an existing VLAN is changed—VTP causes 
all the switches to synchronize their VLAN conﬁguration to include the same VLAN IDs 
and VLAN names. The process is somewhat like a routing protocol, with each switch 
sending periodic VTP messages. Switches also send VTP messages as soon as their VLAN 
conﬁguration changes. For example, if you conﬁgured a new VLAN 3, with the name 
Accounting, the switch would immediately send VTP updates out all trunks, causing the 
distribution of the new VLAN information to the rest of the switches.
Each switch uses one of three VTP modes: server mode, client mode, or transparent mode. 
To use VTP, an engineer sets some switches to use server mode and the rest to use client 
mode. Then, VLAN conﬁguration can be added on the servers, with all other servers and 
clients learning about the changes to the VLAN database. Clients cannot be used to 
conﬁgure VLAN information.
Oddly enough, Cisco switches cannot disable VTP. The closest option is to use transparent 
mode, which causes a switch to ignore VTP, other than to forward VTP messages so that 
any other clients or servers can receive a copy.
The next section explains the normal operations when the engineer uses server and client 
modes to take advantage of VTP’s capabilities, followed by an explanation of the rather 
unusual way to essentially disable VTP by enabling VTP transparent mode.
Normal VTP Operation Using VTP Server and Client Modes
The VTP process begins with VLAN creation on a switch called a VTP server. The VTP 
server then distributes VLAN conﬁguration changes through VTP messages, sent only over 
ISL and 802.1Q trunks, throughout the network. Both VTP servers and clients process the 
received VTP messages, update their VTP conﬁguration database based on those messages, 
and then independently send VTP updates out their trunks. At the end of the process, all 
switches learn the new VLAN information.
VTP servers and clients choose whether to react to a received VTP update, and update their 
VLAN conﬁgurations based on whether the VLAN database conﬁguration revision number 
increases. Each time a VTP server modiﬁes its VLAN conﬁguration, the VTP server 
increments the current conﬁguration revision number by 1. The VTP update messages list 

18     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
the new conﬁguration revision number. When another client or server switch receives a 
VTP message with a higher conﬁguration revision number than its own, the switch updates 
its VLAN conﬁguration. Figure 1-6 illustrates how VTP operates in a switched network.
Figure 1-6
VTP Conﬁguration Revision Numbers and the VTP Update Process  
Figure 1-6 begins with all switches having the same VLAN conﬁguration revision number, 
meaning that they have the same VLAN conﬁguration database; this means that all switches 
know about the same VLAN numbers and VLAN names. The process begins with each 
switch knowing that the current conﬁguration revision number is 3. The steps shown in 
Figure 1-6 are as follows:
1.
Someone conﬁgures a new VLAN from the command-line interface (CLI) of a VTP 
server.
2.
The VTP server updates its VLAN database revision number from 3 to 4.
3.
The server sends VTP update messages out its trunk interfaces, stating revision number 4.
4.
The two VTP client switches notice that the updates list a higher revision number (4) 
than their current revision numbers (3).
5.
The two client switches update their VLAN databases based on the server’s VTP 
updates.
While this example shows a very small LAN, the process works the same for larger 
networks. When a VTP server updates the VLAN conﬁguration, the server immediately 
sends VTP messages out all trunks. The neighboring switches on the other end of the trunks 
process the received messages and update their VLAN databases, and then they send VTP

messages to their neighbors. The process repeats on the neighboring switches, until 
eventually, all switches have heard of the new VLAN database.
VTP servers and clients also send periodic VTP messages every 5 minutes, in case any 
newly added switches need to know the VLAN conﬁguration. Additionally, when a new 
trunk comes up, switches can immediately send a VTP message asking the neighboring 
switch to send its VLAN database.
So far, this chapter has referred to VTP messages as either VTP updates or VTP messages. 
In practice, VTP deﬁnes three different types of messages: summary advertisements, subset 
advertisements, and advertisement requests. The summary advertisements list the revision 
number, domain name, and other information, but no VLAN information. The periodic 
VTP messages that occur every ﬁve minutes are VTP summary advertisements. If 
something changes, as indicated by a new 1-larger revision number, the summary 
advertisement message is followed by one or more subset advertisements, each of which 
advertises some subset of the VLAN database. The third message, the advertisement 
request message, allows a switch to immediately request VTP messages from a neighboring 
switch as soon as a trunk comes up. However, the examples shown for the purposes of this 
book do not make distinctions about the use of the messages.
Three Requirements for VTP to Work Between Two Switches
When a VTP client or server connects to another VTP client or server switch, Cisco IOS 
requires that the following three facts be true before the two switches can exchange VTP 
messages:
■
The link between the switches must be operating as a VLAN trunk (ISL or 802.1Q). 
■
The two switches’ case-sensitive VTP domain name must match.
■
If conﬁgured on at least one of the switches, the two switches’ case-sensitive VTP 
password must match.
The VTP domain name provides a design tool by which engineers can create multiple 
groups of VTP switches, called domains, whose VLAN conﬁgurations are autonomous. To 
do so, the engineer can conﬁgure one set of switches in one VTP domain and another set in 
another VTP domain, and switches in the different domains will ignore each other’s VTP 
messages. VTP domains allow engineers to break up the switched network into different 
administrative domains. For example, in a large building with a large IT staff, one division’s 
NOTE
The complete process by which a server changes the VLAN conﬁguration, and 
all VTP switches learn the new conﬁguration, resulting in all switches knowing the same 
VLAN IDs and name, is called synchronization.

20     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
IT staff might use a VTP domain name of Accounting, while another part of the IT staff 
might use a domain name of Sales, maintaining control of their conﬁgurations but still 
being able to forward trafﬁc between divisions through the LAN infrastructure.
The VTP password mechanism provides a means by which a switch can prevent malicious 
attackers from forcing a switch to change its VLAN conﬁguration. The password itself is 
never transmitted in clear text.
Avoiding VTP by Using VTP Transparent Mode
Interestingly, to avoid using VTP to exchange VLAN information in Cisco switches, 
switches cannot simply disable VTP. Instead, switches must use the third VTP mode: VTP 
transparent mode. Transparent mode gives a switch autonomy from the other switches. Like 
VTP servers, VTP transparent mode switches can conﬁgure VLANs. However, unlike 
servers, transparent mode switches never update their VLAN databases based on incoming 
VTP messages, and transparent mode switches never try to create VTP messages to tell 
other switches about their own VLAN conﬁguration.
VTP transparent mode switches essentially behave as if VTP does not exist, other than one 
small exception: Transparent mode switches forward VTP updates received from other 
switches, just to help out any neighboring VTP server or client switches.
From a design perspective, because of the dangers associated with VTP (as covered in the 
next section), some engineers just avoid VTP altogether by using VTP transparent mode on 
all switches. In other cases, engineers might make a few switches transparent mode 
switches to give autonomy to the engineers responsible for those switches, while using VTP 
server and client modes on other switches.
Storing VLAN Configuration
To forward trafﬁc for a VLAN, a switch needs to know the VLAN’s VLAN ID and its 
VLAN name. VTP’s job is to advertise these details, with the full set of conﬁguration for 
all VLANs being called the VLAN conﬁguration database, or simply VLAN database.
Interestingly, Cisco IOS stores the information in the VLAN database differently than for 
most other Cisco IOS conﬁguration commands. When VTP clients and servers store VLAN 
conﬁguration—speciﬁcally, the VLAN ID, VLAN name, and other VTP conﬁguration 
settings—the conﬁguration is stored in a ﬁle called vlan.dat in ﬂash memory. (The ﬁlename 
is short for “VLAN database.”) Even more interesting is the fact that Cisco IOS does not 
put this VLAN conﬁguration in the running-conﬁg ﬁle or the startup-conﬁg ﬁle. No 
command exists to view the VTP and VLAN conﬁguration directly; instead, you need to 
use several show commands to list the information about VLANs and VTP output.

Virtual LAN Concepts     21
The process of storing the VLAN conﬁguration in ﬂash in the vlan.dat ﬁle allows both 
clients and servers to dynamically learn about VLANs, and have the conﬁguration 
automatically stored, therefore making both client and server prepared for their next reload. 
If the dynamically learned VLAN conﬁguration was only added to the running conﬁg ﬁle, 
the campus LAN could be exposed to cases in which all switches lost power around the 
same time (easily accomplished with a single power source into the building), resulting in 
loss of all VLAN conﬁguration. By automatically storing the conﬁguration in the vlan.dat 
ﬁle in ﬂash memory, each switch has at least a recent VLAN conﬁguration database, and 
can then rely on VTP updates from other switches if any VLAN conﬁguration has changed 
recently.
An interesting side effect of this process is that when you use a VTP client or server switch 
in a lab, and you want to remove all the conﬁguration to start with a clean switch, you must 
issue more than the erase startup-conﬁg command. If you only erase the startup-conﬁg 
and reload the switch, the switch remembers all VLAN conﬁg and VTP conﬁguration that 
is instead stored in the vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash. To remove those conﬁguration details before 
reloading a switch, you would have to delete the vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash with a command such 
as delete ﬂash:vlan.dat.
Switches in transparent mode store VLAN conﬁguration in both the running-conﬁg ﬁle as 
well as the vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash. The running-conﬁg can be saved to the startup-conﬁg as well. 
VTP Versions
Cisco supports three VTP versions, aptly named versions 1, 2, and 3. Most of the 
differences between these versions are unimportant to the discussions in this book. 
However, VTP version 2 made one important improvement over version 1 relative to VTP 
transparent mode, an improvement that is brieﬂy described in this section.
The section “Avoiding VTP by Using VTP Transparent Mode,” earlier in this chapter, 
described how a switch using VTP version 2 would work. However, in VTP version 1, a 
VTP transparent mode switch would ﬁrst check a received VTP update’s domain name and 
password. If the transparent mode switch did not match both parameters, the transparent 
mode switch discarded the VTP update, rather than forwarding the update. The problem 
with VTP version 1 is that in cases where a transparent mode switch existed in a network 
with multiple VTP domains, the switch wouldn’t forward all VTP updates. So, VTP version 
NOTE
In some older switch Cisco IOS versions, VTP servers stored VLAN 
conﬁguration in both vlan.dat and the running-conﬁg ﬁle.

22     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
2 changed transparent mode logic, ignoring the domain name and password, allowing a 
VTP version 2 transparent mode switch to forward all received VTP updates.
VTP Pruning
By default, Cisco switches ﬂood broadcasts (and unknown destination unicasts) in each 
active VLAN out all trunks, as long as the current STP topology does not block the trunk. 
(You ﬁnd more on STP in Chapter 2.) However, in most campus networks, many VLANs 
exist on only a few switches, but not all switches. Therefore, it is wasteful to forward 
broadcasts over all trunks, causing the frames to arrive at switches that do not have any 
ports in that VLAN.
Switches support two methods by which an engineer can limit which VLAN’s trafﬁc ﬂows 
over a trunk. One method requires the manual conﬁguration of the allowed VLAN list on 
each trunk; this manual conﬁguration is covered later in the chapter. The second method, 
VTP pruning, allows VTP to dynamically determine which switches do not need frames 
from certain VLANs, and then VTP prunes those VLANs from the appropriate trunks. 
Pruning simply means that the appropriate switch trunk interfaces do not ﬂood frames in 
that VLAN. Figure 1-7 shows an example, with the dashed-line rectangles denoting the 
trunks from which VLAN 10 has been automatically pruned.
Figure 1-7
VTP Pruning
In Figure 1-7, switches 1 and 4 have ports in VLAN 10. With VTP pruning enabled 
network-wide, switch 2 and switch 4 automatically use VTP to learn that none of the

switches in the lower-left part of the ﬁgure have any ports assigned to VLAN 10. As a result, 
switch 2 and switch 4 prune VLAN 10 from the trunks as shown. The pruning causes switch 
2 and switch 4 to not send frames in VLAN 10 out these trunks. For example, when station 
A sends a broadcast, the switches ﬂood the broadcast, as shown by the arrowed lines in 
Figure 1-7.
VTP pruning increases the available bandwidth by restricting ﬂooded trafﬁc. VTP pruning 
is one of the two most compelling reasons to use VTP, with the other reason being to make 
VLAN conﬁguration easier and more consistent.

Cisco switches do not require any conﬁguration to work. You can purchase Cisco switches, 
install devices with the correct cabling, and turn on the switches, and they work. You would 
never need to conﬁgure the switch and it would work ﬁne, even if you interconnected 
switches, until you needed more than one VLAN. Even the default STP settings would

likely work just ﬁne, but if you want to use VLANs—and most every enterprise network 
does—you need to add some conﬁguration.
This chapter separates the VLAN conﬁguration details into two major sections. The current 
section focuses on conﬁguration and veriﬁcation tasks when VTP is ignored, either by 
using the default VTP settings or if using VTP transparent mode. The ﬁnal major section of 
this chapter, “VTP Conﬁguration and Veriﬁcation,” examines VTP speciﬁcally.
Creating VLANs and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface
This section shows how to create a VLAN, give the VLAN a name, and assign interfaces to 
a VLAN. To focus on these basic details, this section shows examples using a single switch, 
so VTP and trunking are not needed.
For a Cisco switch to forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must be conﬁgured 
to believe that the VLAN exists. Additionally, the switch must have nontrunking interfaces 
(called access interfaces) assigned to the VLAN and/or trunks that support the VLAN. The 
conﬁguration steps for creating the VLAN, and assigning a VLAN to an access interface, 
are as follows. (Note that the trunk conﬁguration is covered in the section “VLAN Trunking 
Conﬁguration,” later in this chapter.)
Step 1 To conﬁgure a new VLAN, follow these steps:  
a. From conﬁguration mode, use the vlan vlan-id global conﬁguration 
command to create the VLAN and to move the user into VLAN 
conﬁguration mode.
b. (Optional) Use the name name VLAN subcommand to list a name 
for the VLAN. If not conﬁgured, the VLAN name is VLANZZZZ, 
where ZZZZ is the 4-digit decimal VLAN ID.
Step 2 To conﬁgure a VLAN for each access interface, follow these steps:
a. Use the interface command to move into interface conﬁguration 
mode for each desired interface.
b. Use the switchport access vlan id-number interface subcommand to 
specify the VLAN number associated with that interface.

VLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and Verification     25
c. (Optional) To disable trunking on that same interface, ensuring that 
the interface is an access interface, use the switchport mode access 
interface subcommand.
The previous process can be used on a switch either conﬁgured to be a transparent mode 
switch or a switch with all default VTP settings. For reference, the following list outlines 
the key Cisco switch defaults related to VLANs and VTP. For now, this chapter assumes 
either default VTP settings or a setting of VTP transparent mode. Later in this chapter, the 
section “Caveats When Moving Away from Default VTP Conﬁguration” revisits Cisco 
switch defaults and the implication of how to go from not using VTP, based on the default 
settings, to how to use VTP.

command).
VLAN Configuration Example 1: Full VLAN Configuration
Example 1-1 shows the conﬁguration process of adding a new VLAN and assigning access 
interfaces to that VLAN. Figure 1-8 shows the network used in the example, with one LAN 
switch (SW1) and two hosts in each of three VLANs (1, 2, and 3). The example shows the 
details of the two-step process for VLAN 2 and the interfaces in VLAN 2, with the 
conﬁguration of VLAN 3 deferred until the next example.
NOTE
VLANs can be created and named in conﬁguration mode (as described in Step 
1) or by using a conﬁguration tool called VLAN database mode. The VLAN database 
mode is not covered in this book, and it is typically not covered for other Cisco exams, 
either.
NOTE
Cisco switches also support a dynamic method of assigning devices to VLANs, 
based on the device’s MAC addresses, using a tool called the VLAN Management Policy 
Server (VMPS). This tool is seldom if ever used.

The example begins with the show vlan brief command, conﬁrming the default settings of 
ﬁve nondeletable VLANs, with all interfaces assigned to VLAN 1. In particular, note that 
this 2960 switch has 24 Fast Ethernet ports (Fa0/1–Fa0/24) and two Gigabit Ethernet ports 
(Gi0/1 and Gi0/2), all of which are listed as being in VLAN 1.
Next, the example shows the process of creating VLAN 2 and assigning interfaces Fa0/13 
and Fa0/14 to VLAN 2. Note in particular that the example uses the interface range 
command, which causes the switchport access vlan 2 interface subcommand to be applied 
to both interfaces in the range, as conﬁrmed in the show running-conﬁg command output 
at the end of the example.
After the conﬁguration has been added, to list the new VLAN, the example repeats the show 
vlan brief command. Note that this command lists VLAN 2, name Freds-vlan, and the 
interfaces assigned to that VLAN (Fa0/13 and Fa0/14).

Example 1-1 uses default VTP conﬁguration. However, if the switch had been 
conﬁgured for VTP transparent mode, the vlan 2 and name Freds-vlan conﬁguration 
commands would have also been seen in the output of the show running-conﬁg 
command. Because this switch is in VTP server mode (default), the switch stores these 
two commands only in the vlan.dat ﬁle.
Example 1-1
Conﬁguring VLANs and Assigning VLANs to Interfaces (Continued)

28     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
A switch might not use the VLAN assigned by the switchport access vlan vlan-id 
command in some cases, depending on the operational mode of an interface. A Cisco 
switch’s operational mode relates to whether the interface is currently using a trunking 
protocol. An interface that is currently using trunking is called a trunk interface, and all 
other interfaces are called access interfaces. So, engineers use phrases like “Fa0/12 is a 
trunk port” or “Fa0/13 is an access interface,” referring to whether the design intends to use 
a particular interface to trunk (trunk mode) or to connect to just one VLAN (access mode).
The optional interface subcommand switchport mode access tells the switch to only allow 
the interface to be an access interface, which means that the interface will not use trunking 
and it will use the assigned access VLAN. If you omit the optional switchport mode access 
interface subcommand, the interface could negotiate to use trunking, becoming a trunk 
interface and ignoring the conﬁgured access VLAN.
VLAN Configuration Example 2: Shorter VLAN Configuration
Example 1-1 shows several of the optional conﬁguration commands, with a side effect of 
being a bit longer than is required. Example 1-2 shows a much briefer alternative 
conﬁguration, picking up the story where Example 1-1 ended, showing the addition of 
VLAN 3 (as seen in Figure 1-8). Note that SW1 does not know about VLAN 3 at the 
beginning of this example.

VLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and Verification     29
Example 1-2 shows how a switch can dynamically create a VLAN—the equivalent of the 
vlan vlan-id global conﬁg command—when the switchport access vlan interface 
subcommand refers to a currently unconﬁgured VLAN. This example begins with SW1 not 
knowing about VLAN 3. When the switchport access vlan 3 interface subcommand was 
used, the switch realized that VLAN 3 did not exist, and as noted in the shaded message in 
the example, the switch created VLAN 3, using a default name (VLAN0003). No other 
steps are required to create the VLAN. At the end of the process, VLAN 3 exists in the 
switch, and interfaces Fa0/15 and Fa0/16 are in VLAN 3, as noted in the shaded part of the 
show vlan brief command output.
As a reminder, note that some of the conﬁguration shown in Examples 1-1 and 1-2 ends up 
only in the vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash memory, and some ends up only in the running-conﬁg ﬁle. 
In particular, the interface subcommands are in the running-conﬁg ﬁle, so a copy running-
conﬁg startup-conﬁg command would be needed to save the conﬁguration. However, the 
deﬁnitions of new VLANs 2 and 3 have already been automatically saved in the vlan.dat 
ﬁle in ﬂash. Table 1-7, later in this chapter, lists a reference of the various conﬁguration 
commands, where they are stored, and how to conﬁrm the conﬁguration settings.
VLAN Trunking Configuration
Trunking conﬁguration on Cisco switches involves two important conﬁguration choices, as 
follows:
■
The type of trunking: IEEE 802.1Q, ISL, or negotiate which one to use
■
The administrative mode: Whether to trunk, not trunk, or negotiate
Cisco switches can either negotiate or conﬁgure the type of trunking to use (ISL or 802.1Q). 
By default, Cisco switches negotiate the type of trunking with the switch on the other end 
of the trunk, using the Dynamic Trunk Protocol (DTP). When negotiating, if both switches 
support both ISL and 802.1Q, they choose ISL. If one switch is willing to use either type, 
and the other switch is only willing to use one type of trunking, the two switches agree to 
use that one type of trunking supported by both switches. The type of trunking preferred on 
an interface, for switches that support both types, is conﬁgured using the switchport trunk 
encapsulation {dot1q | isl | negotiate} interface subcommand. (Many of the most recently 
developed Cisco switches, including 2960s, only support the IEEE-standard 802.1Q 
trunking today, so these switches simply default to a setting of switchport trunk 
encapsulation dot1q.) 
The administrative mode refers to the conﬁguration setting for whether trunking should be 
used on an interface. The term administrative refers to what is conﬁgured, whereas an 
interface’s operational mode refers to what is currently happening on the interface. Cisco 
switches use an interface’s administrative mode, as conﬁgured with the switchport mode 
interface subcommand, to determine whether to use trunking. Table 1-4 lists the options of 
the switchport mode command.

30     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
For example, consider the two switches shown in Figure 1-9. This ﬁgure shows an 
expansion of the network of Figure 1-8, with a trunk to a new switch (SW2) and with parts 
of VLANs 1 and 3 on ports attached to SW2. The two switches use a Gigabit Ethernet link 
for the trunk. In this case, the trunk does not dynamically form by default, because both 
(2960) switches default to an administrative mode of dynamic auto, meaning that neither 
switch initiates the trunk negotiation process. By changing one switch to use dynamic 
desirable mode, which does initiate the negotiation, the switches negotiate to use trunking, 
speciﬁcally 802.1Q because the 2960s only support 802.1Q.

First, focus on important items from the output of the show interfaces switchport 
command at the beginning of Example 1-3. The output lists the default administrative mode 
setting of dynamic auto. Because SW2 also defaults to dynamic auto, the command lists 
SW1’s operational status as access, meaning that it is not trunking. The third shaded line 
points out the only supported type of trunking (802.1Q) on this 2960 switch. (On a switch 
that supports both ISL and 802.1Q, this value would by default list “negotiate,” to mean that 
the type or encapsulation is negotiated.) Finally, the operational trunking type is listed as 
“native,” which is a subtle way to say that the switch does not add any trunking header to 
forwarded frames on this port, treating frames as if they are in an 802.1Q native VLAN.
To enable trunking, the two switches’ administrative modes must be set to a combination 
of values that result in trunking. By changing SW1 to use dynamic desirable mode, as

shown next in Example 1-3, SW1 will now initiate the negotiations, and the two switches 
will use trunking. Of particular interest is the fact that the switch brings the interface to a 
down state, and then back up again, as a result of the change to the administrative mode of 
the interface.
To verify that trunking is working now, the end of Example 1-3 lists the show interfaces 
switchport command. Note that the command still lists the administrative settings, which 
denote the conﬁgured values, along with the operational settings, which list what the switch 
is currently doing. In this case, SW1 now claims to be in an operational mode of trunk, with 
an operational trunking encapsulation of dot1Q.
For the ICND2 and CCNA exams, you should be ready to interpret the output of the show 
interfaces switchport command, realize the administrative mode implied by the output, 
and know whether the link should operationally trunk based on those settings. Table 1-5 
lists the combinations of the trunking administrative modes and the expected operational 
mode (trunk or access) resulting from the conﬁgured settings. The table lists the 
administrative mode used on one end of the link on the left, and the administrative mode on 
the switch on the other end of the link across the top of the table.
Controlling Which VLANs Can Be Supported on a Trunk
The allowed VLAN list feature provides a mechanism for engineers to administratively 
disable a VLAN from a trunk. By default, switches include all possible VLANs (1–4094) 
in each trunk’s allowed VLAN list. However, the engineer can then limit the VLANs 
allowed on the trunk by using the following interface subcommand:
sssswwwwiiiittttcccchhhhppppoooorrrrtttt    ttttrrrruuuunnnnkkkk    aaaalllllllloooowwwweeeedddd    vvvvllllaaaannnn {aaaadddddddd | aaaallllllll | eeeexxxxcccceeeepppptttt | rrrreeeemmmmoooovvvveeee} vlan-list
This command provides a way to easily add and remove VLANs from the list. For example, 
the add option permits the switch to add VLANs to the existing allowed VLAN list, and the 
remove option permits the switch to remove VLANs from the existing list. The all option 
means all VLANs, so you can use it to reset the switch to its original default setting 
(permitting VLANs 1–4094 on the trunk). The except option is rather tricky: It adds all

VLANs to the list that are not part of the command. For example, the switchport trunk 
allowed vlan except 100-200 interface subcommand adds VLANs 1 through 99 and 201 
through 4094 to the existing allowed VLAN list on that trunk.
In addition to the allowed VLAN list, a switch has three other reasons to prevent a particular 
VLAN’s trafﬁc from crossing a trunk. All four reasons are summarized in the following list:
■
A VLAN has been removed from the trunk’s allowed VLAN list.  
■
A VLAN does not exist, or is not active, in the switch’s VLAN database (as seen with 
the show vlan command).
■
A VLAN has been automatically pruned by VTP.
■
A VLAN’s STP instance has placed the trunk interface into a state other than a 
Forwarding State.
Of these additional three reasons, the second reason needs a little more explanation. (The 
third reason, VTP pruning, has already been covered in this chapter, and the fourth reason, 
STP, is covered thoroughly in Chapter 2.) If a switch does not know that a VLAN exists, as 
evidenced by the VLAN’s absence from the output of the show vlan command, the switch 
will not forward frames in that VLAN over any interface. Additionally, a VLAN can be 
administratively shut down on any switch by using the shutdown vlan vlan-id global 
conﬁguration command, which also causes the switch to no longer forward frames in that 
VLAN, even over trunks. So, switches do not forward frames in a nonexistent or shutdown 
VLAN over any of the switch’s trunks.
The book lists the four reasons for limiting VLANs on a trunk in the same order in which 
IOS describes these reasons in the output of the show interfaces trunk command. This 
command includes a progression of three lists of the VLANs supported over a trunk. These 
three lists are as follows:
■
VLANs in the allowed VLAN list on the trunk
■
VLANs in the previous group that are also conﬁgured and active (not shut down) on 
the switch
■
VLANs in the previous group that are also not pruned and are in an STP Forwarding 
State
To get an idea of these three lists inside the output of the show interfaces trunk command, 
Example 1-4 shows how VLANs might be disallowed on a trunk for various reasons. The 
command output is taken from SW1 in Figure 1-9, after the completion of the conﬁguration 

VLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and Verification     35
as shown in Examples 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. In other words, VLANS 1 through 3 exist, and 
trunking is operational. Then, during the example, the following items are conﬁgured 
on SW1:
Step 1 VLAN 4 is added.
Step 2 VLAN 2 is shut down.
Step 3 VLAN 3 is removed from the trunk’s allowed VLAN list.

Trunking to Cisco IP Phones
Cisco IP phones use Ethernet to connect to the IP network for the purpose of sending Voice 
over IP (VoIP) packets. Cisco IP phones can send VoIP packets to other IP phones to support 
voice calls, as well as send VoIP packets to voice gateways, which in turn connect to the 
existing traditional telephone network, supporting the ability to call most any phone in the 
world.
Cisco anticipated that each desk in an enterprise might have both a Cisco IP phone and a 
PC on it. To reduce cabling clutter, Cisco includes a small LAN switch in the bottom of each 
Cisco IP phone. The small switch allows one cable to run from the wiring closet to the desk 
and connect to the IP phone, and then the PC can connect to the switch by connecting a 
short Ethernet (straight-through) cable from the PC to the bottom of the IP phone. Figure 
1-10 shows the cabling as well as a few more details.
Figure 1-10
Typical Connection of a Cisco IP Phone and PC to a Cisco Switch
Cisco IP telephony design guidelines suggest that the link between the phone and switch 
should use 802.1Q trunking, and that the phone and PC should be in different VLANs (and 
therefore in different subnets). By placing the phones in one VLAN, and the PCs connected 
to the phones in a different VLAN, engineers can more easily manage the IP address space, 
more easily apply quality of service (QoS) mechanisms to the VoIP packets, and provide 
better security by separating the data and voice trafﬁc.

Cisco calls the VLAN used for the phone’s trafﬁc the voice VLAN and the VLAN used for 
data the data or access VLAN. For the switch to forward trafﬁc correctly, Cisco switches 
need to know the VLAN ID of both the voice VLAN and the data VLAN. The data (or 
access) VLAN is conﬁgured just as seen in the last few examples, using the switchport 
access vlan vlan-id command. The voice vlan is conﬁgured with the switchport voice vlan 
vlan-id interface subcommand. For example, to match Figure 1-10, interface Fa0/6 would 
need both the switchport access vlan 2 interface subcommand and the switchport voice 
vlan 12 subcommand.
Table 1-6 summarizes the key points about the voice VLAN.
Securing VLANs and Trunking
Switches are exposed to several types of security vulnerabilities over both used ports and 
unused ports. For example, an attacker could connect a computer to a wall plug cabled to a 
switch port and cause problems on the VLAN assigned to that port. Additionally, the 
attacker could negotiate trunking and cause many other types of problems, some related 
to VTP.
Cisco makes some recommendations for how to protect unused switch ports. Instead of 
using default settings, Cisco recommends conﬁguring these interfaces as follows:
■
Administratively disable the unused interface, using the shutdown interface  
subcommand.
■
Prevent trunking from being negotiated when the port is enabled by using the 
switchport nonegotiate interface subcommand to disable negotiation, or the 
switchport mode access interface subcommand to statically conﬁgure the interface as 
an access interface.
■
Assign the port to an unused VLAN, sometimes called a parking lot VLAN, using the 
switchport access vlan number interface subcommand.
Frankly, if you just shut down the interface, the security exposure goes away, but the other 
two tasks prevent any immediate problems if some other engineer enables the interface by 
conﬁguring a no shutdown command.

38     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
Besides these recommendations on unused ports, Cisco recommends that the negotiation of 
trunking be disabled on all in-use access interfaces, with all trunks being manually 
conﬁgured to trunk. The exposure is that an attacker could disconnect a legitimate user’s 
computer from the RJ-45 port, connect the attacker’s PC, and try to negotiate trunking. By 
conﬁguring all in-use interfaces that should not be trunking with the switchport 
nonnegotiate interface subcommand, these interfaces will not dynamically decide to trunk, 
reducing the exposure to trunking-related problems. For any interfaces that need to trunk, 
Cisco recommends manually conﬁguring trunking.
VTP Configuration and Verification
VTP conﬁguration requires only a few simple steps, but VTP has the power to cause 
signiﬁcant problems, either by accidental poor conﬁguration choices or by malicious 
attacks. The following sections ﬁrst examine the overall conﬁguration, followed by some 
comments about potential problems created by the VTP process. These sections then end 
with a discussion of how to troubleshoot problems related to VTP.
Using VTP: Configuring Servers and Clients
Before conﬁguring VTP, several VTP settings must be chosen. In particular, assuming that 
the engineer wants to make use of VTP, the engineer needs to decide which switches will 
be in the same VTP domain, meaning that these switches will learn VLAN conﬁguration 
information from each other. The VTP domain name must be chosen, along with an 
optional but recommended VTP password. (Both values are case sensitive.) The engineer 
must also choose which switches will be servers (usually at least two for redundancy), and 
which will be clients.
After the planning steps are completed, the following steps can be used to conﬁgure VTP:
Step 1 Conﬁgure the VTP mode using the vtp mode {server | client} global  
conﬁguration command.
Step 2 Conﬁgure the VTP (case-sensitive) domain name using the vtp domain 
domain-name global conﬁguration command.
Step 3 (Optional) On both clients and servers, conﬁgure the same case-sensitive 
password using the vtp password password-value global conﬁguration 
command.
Step 4 (Optional) Conﬁgure VTP pruning on the VTP servers using the vtp 
pruning global conﬁguration command.
Step 5 (Optional) Enable VTP version 2 with the vtp version 2 global 
conﬁguration command.

VTP Configuration and Verification     39
Step 6 Bring up trunks between the switches.
Example 1-5 shows a sample conﬁguration, along with a show vtp status command, for 
the two switches in Figure 1-11. The ﬁgure points out the conﬁguration settings on the two 
switches before Example 1-5 shows VTP conﬁguration being added. In particular, note that 
both switches use default VTP conﬁguration settings.

Basic VTP Client and Server Conﬁguration (Continued)

VTP Configuration and Verification     41
The example is relatively long, but the conﬁguration is straightforward. Both switches were 
conﬁgured with the VTP mode (server and client), the same domain name, and the same 
password, with trunking already having been conﬁgured. The conﬁguration resulted in 
SW2 (client) synchronizing its VLAN database to match SW1 (server).
Cisco IOS switches in VTP server or client mode store the vtp conﬁguration commands, and 
some other conﬁguration commands, in the vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash, and the switches do not store 
the conﬁguration commands in the running-conﬁg ﬁle. Instead, to verify these conﬁguration 
commands and their settings, the show vtp status and show vlan commands are used. For 
reference, Table 1-7 lists the VLAN-related conﬁguration commands, the location in which a 
VTP server or client stores the commands, and how to view the settings for the commands.

Basic VTP Client and Server Conﬁguration (Continued)

42     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
Any analysis of VTP and VLANs on Cisco switches depends on two important commands: 
the show vtp status and show vlan commands. First, note that when the domain is 
synchronized, the show vtp status command on all switches should have the same 
conﬁguration revision number. Additionally, the show vlan command should list the same 
VLANs and VLAN names. For example, both SW1 and SW2 end Example 1-5 with a 
revision number of 5, and both know about seven VLANs: 1–3 and 1002–1005. Both 
instances of the show vtp status command in Example 1-5 list the IP address of the last 
switch to modify the VLAN database—namely SW1, 192.168.1.105—so it is easier to ﬁnd 
which switch last changed the VLAN conﬁguration. Only on VTP servers, the show vtp 
status command ends with a line that lists that switch’s IP address that identiﬁes itself when 
advertising VTP updates, making it easier to conﬁrm which switch last changed the VLAN 
conﬁguration.
Note that the VTP password can only be displayed with the show vtp password command. 
The show vtp status command displays an MD5 digest of the password.
Caveats When Moving Away from Default VTP Configuration
The default behavior of VTP introduces the possibility of problems when ﬁrst conﬁguring 
VTP. To see why, consider the following ﬁve points about VTP:
■
The default VTP conﬁguration on Cisco switches is VTP server mode with a null 
domain name.
■
With all default settings, a switch does not send VTP updates, even over trunks, but the 
switch can be conﬁgured with VLANs because it is in server mode.
■
After conﬁguring a domain name, that switch immediately starts sending VTP updates 
over all its trunks.
■
If a switch that still has a (default) null domain name receives a VTP update—which 
by deﬁnition lists a domain name—and no password was used by the sending switch, 
the receiving switch starts using that VTP domain name.
■
When the previous step occurs, the switch with the higher VLAN database revision 
number causes the switch with the lower revision number to overwrite its VLAN 
database.
Example 1-5 progresses through these same ﬁve facts. Example 1-5 begins with trunking 
enabled between the two switches, but with default VTP settings (items 1 and 2 from the 
NOTE
Cisco switches send VTP messages and Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) 
messages on trunks using VLAN 1.

VTP Configuration and Verification     43
list preceding this paragraph). As soon as SW1 conﬁgures its VTP domain name, SW1 
sends VTP messages over the trunk to SW2 (item 3). SW2 reacts by starting to use the VTP 
domain name listed in the received VTP update (Freds-domain, in this case). By the time 
the vtp domain Freds-domain command was issued on SW2 in Example 1-5, SW2 was 
already using the dynamically learned domain name Freds-domain, so Cisco IOS on SW2 
issued the response “Domain name already set to Freds-domain” (item 4). Finally, SW2, 
with a lower VTP revision number, synchronized its VLAN database to match SW1 
(item 5).
The process worked exactly as intended in Example 1-5. However, this same process allows 
an engineer to innocently conﬁgure a switch’s VTP domain name and completely crash a 
switched LAN. For example, imagine that SW2 had conﬁgured VLAN 4 and assigned 
several interfaces to VLAN 4, but SW1 does not have a deﬁnition for VLAN 4. Following 
this same process, when SW2 synchronizes its VLAN database to match SW1, SW2 
overwrites the old database, losing the deﬁnition of VLAN 4. At that point, SW4 can no 
longer forward frames in VLAN 4, and all the users of VLAN 4 might start calling the help 
desk.
This same process could be used to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack using VTP. 
With only default VTP settings, any attacker that can manage to bring up a trunk between 
an attacking switch and the existing legitimate switch can cause the existing switches to 
synchronize to the attacking switch’s VLAN database, which may well have no VLANs 
conﬁgured. So, for real networks, if you do not intend to use VTP when installing a switch, 
it is worth the effort to simply conﬁgure it to be a VTP transparent mode switch, as is 
covered in the next section. By doing so, the conﬁguration of a VTP domain name on that 
new switch will not impact the existing switches, and the conﬁguration of a domain name 
on another switch will not impact this new switch.
Avoiding VTP: Configuring Transparent Mode
To avoid using VTP, you need to conﬁgure VTP transparent mode. In transparent mode, a 
switch never updates its VLAN database based on a received VTP message, and never 
causes other switches to update their databases based on the transparent mode switch’s 
VLAN database. The only VTP action performed by the switch is to forward VTP messages 
received on one trunk out all the other trunks, which allows other VTP clients and servers 
to work correctly.
Conﬁguring VTP transparent mode is simple: Just issue the vtp mode transparent 
command in global conﬁguration mode. You do not need a domain name or a password.
NOTE
The section titled “Troubleshooting VTP” explains how to recognize when VTP 
might have caused problems like those mentioned in this section.

44     Chapter 1: Virtual LANs
Troubleshooting VTP
VTP can have an enormous impact on a campus LAN built using Cisco switches, both a 
negative and positive impact. The following sections examine three aspects of VTP 
troubleshooting. First, the text suggests a process by which to troubleshoot VTP when VTP 
does not appear to be distributing VLAN conﬁguration information (adds/deletions/
changes). Following that, the text examines a common class of problems that occur when 
a trunk comes up, possibly triggering the neighboring switches to send VTP updates and 
overwrite one of the switch’s VLAN database. This topic ends with suggested best practices 
for preventing VTP problems.
Determining Why VTP Is Not Currently Working
The ﬁrst step in troubleshooting VTP should be to determine whether a problem exists in 
the ﬁrst place. For switches that should be using VTP, in the same domain, a problem can 
ﬁrst be identiﬁed when any two neighboring switches have different VLAN databases. In 
other words, they know about different VLAN IDs, with different names, and with a 
different conﬁguration revision number. After identifying two neighboring switches whose 
VLAN databases do not match, the next step is to check the conﬁguration and the 
operational trunking mode (not the administrative mode), and to correct any problems. The 
following list details the speciﬁc steps:
Step 1 Conﬁrm the switch names, topology (including which interfaces connect which  
switches), and switch VTP modes.
Step 2 Identify sets of two neighboring switches that should be either VTP 
clients or servers whose VLAN databases differ with the show vlan 
command.
Step 3 On each pair of two neighboring switches whose databases differ, verify 
the following:
a. At least one operational trunk should exist between the two switches 
(use the show interfaces trunk, show interfaces switchport, or 
show cdp neighbors command).
b. The switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP domain name 
(show vtp status).
c. If conﬁgured, the switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP 
password (show vtp password).

VTP Configuration and Verification     45
d. While VTP pruning should be enabled or disabled on all servers in 
the same domain, having two servers conﬁgured with opposite 
pruning settings does not prevent the synchronization process.
Step 4 For each pair of switches identiﬁed in Step 3, solve the problem by either 
troubleshooting the trunking problem or reconﬁguring a switch to 
correctly match the domain name or password.
While the process does spell out several steps, it mainly shows how to attack the problem 
with knowledge covered earlier in this chapter. The process basically states that if the 
VLAN databases differ, and the switches should be either VTP clients or servers, that a VTP 
problem exists—and the root cause is usually some VTP conﬁguration problem. However, 
on the exam, you might be forced to ﬁgure out the answer based on show command output. 
For example, consider a problem in which three switches (SW1, SW2, and SW3) all 
connect to each other. An exam question might require that you ﬁnd any VTP problems in 
the network, based on the output of show commands like those in Example 1-6.
NOTE
For real campus LANs, besides the items in this list, also consider the intended 
VTP design as well.
NOTE
It would be a good exercise to read the example and apply the troubleshooting 
steps listed at the beginning of this section before reading any of the explanations that 
follow the example.

For Step 1, the show cdp neighbors and show interfaces trunk commands provide 
enough information to conﬁrm the topology as well as show which links are operating as 
trunks. The show interfaces trunk command lists only interfaces in an operationally 
trunking state. Alternately, the show interfaces switchport command lists the operational 
mode (trunk or access) as well. Figure 1-12 shows the network diagram. Note also that the 
link between SW1 and SW3 does not currently use trunking.

For Step 2, a quick review of the show vlan brief command output from each switch shows 
that all three switches have different VLAN databases. For example, all three switches 
know about VLAN 3, whereas SW1 is the only switch that knows about VLAN 50, and 
SW3 is the only switch that knows about VLAN 20.
Because all three pairs of neighboring switches have different VLAN databases, Step 3 of 
the troubleshooting process suggests that each pair be examined. Starting with SW1 and 
SW2, a quick look at the show vtp status command on both switches identiﬁes the 
problem: SW1 uses the domain name Larry, whereas SW2 uses larry, and the names differ 
because of the different case of the ﬁrst letter. Similarly, SW3 and SW2 have difﬁculties 
because of the mismatched VTP domain name. Because SW2 is the only switch with 
lowercase larry, a solution would be to reconﬁgure SW2 to use Larry as the domain name.
Continuing Step 3 for SW1 and SW3, the two switches have the same domain name (Step 
3B), but a look at Step 3A shows that no trunk is connecting SW1 to SW3. CDP conﬁrms 
that SW1’s Gi0/2 interface connects to SW3, but the show interfaces trunk command on 
SW1 does not list the Gi0/2 interface. As a result, neither switch can send VTP messages 
to each other. The root cause of this problem is most likely an oversight in the conﬁguration 
of the switchport mode interface subcommand.
While the example did not have any problems because of VTP password mismatches, it is 
important to know how to check the passwords. First, the password can be displayed on 
each switch with the show vtp password command. Additionally, the show vtp status 
command lists an MD5 hash derived from both the VTP domain name and VTP password. 
So, if two switches have the same case-sensitive domain name and password, the MD5 hash 
value listed in the show vtp status command output will be the same. However, if two 
switches list different MD5 hash values, you then need to examine the domain names. If the 
domain names are the same, the passwords must have been different because the MD5 
hashes are different.
Before moving on to the next topic, here is a quick comment about VTP version and how 
it should not prevent switches from working. If you examine the show vtp status command 
output again in Example 1-6, note the headings VTP Version and V2 Mode Enabled. The 
ﬁrst line lists the highest VTP version supported by that switch’s software. The other line 
shows what the switch is currently using. If a switch has the VTP version 2 command 
conﬁgured, overriding the default of version 1, the switch will use vtp version 2—but only 
if the other switches in the domain also support version 2. So, a mismatch of the conﬁgured 
VTP version means that the switches work, but they would use VTP version 1, and the line 
reading “VTP V2 Mode” would list the word disabled, meaning that VTP version 1 is used.

Problems When Connecting New Switches and Bringing Up Trunks
VTP can be running just ﬁne for months, and then one day, a rash of calls to the help desk 
describe cases in which large groups of users can no longer use the network. After further 
examination, it appears that most every VLAN in the campus has been deleted. The 
switches still have many interfaces with switchport access vlan commands that refer to the 
now-deleted VLANs. None of the devices on those now-deleted VLANs work, because 
Cisco switches do not forward frames for nonexistent VLANs.
This scenario can and does happen occasionally, mainly when a new switch is connected to 
an existing network. Whether this problem happens by accident or as a denial of service 
(DoS) attack, the root cause is that when a new VLAN trunk (ISL or 802.1Q) comes up 
between two switches, and the two switches are either VTP servers or clients, the switches 
send VTP updates to each other. If a switch receives a VTP advertisement that has the same 
domain name and was generated with the same VTP password, one or the other switch 
overwrites its VLAN database as part of the synchronization process. Speciﬁcally, the 
switch that had the lower revision number synchronizes its VLAN database to match the 
neighboring switch (which has the higher revision number). Summarizing the process more 
formally:
Step 1 Conﬁrm that trunking will occur on the new link (refer to Table 1-5 for details).  
Step 2 Conﬁrm that the two switches use the same case-sensitive VTP domain 
name and password.
Step 3 If Steps 1 and 2 conﬁrm that VTP will work, the switch with the lower 
revision number updates its VLAN database to match the other switch.
For example, Example 1-6 and Figure 1-12 show that the SW1-to-SW3 link is not trunking. 
If this link were to be conﬁgured to trunk, SW1 and SW3 would send VTP messages to each 
other, using the same VTP domain name and the same VTP password. So, one switch would 
update its VLAN database to match the other. Example 1-6 shows SW1 with revision 
number 131 and SW3 with revision number 134, so SW1 will overwrite its VLAN database 
to match SW3, thereby deleting VLANs 49 and 50. Example 1-7 picks up the story at the 
end of Example 1-6, showing the trunk between SW1 and SW3 coming up, allowing VTP 
synchronization, and resulting in changes to SW1’s VLAN database.

VTP Configuration and Verification     51
In real life, you have several ways to help reduce the chance of such problems when 
installing a new switch to an existing VTP domain. In particular, before connecting a new 
switch to an existing VTP domain, reset the new switch’s VTP revision number to 0 by one 
of the following methods:
■
Conﬁgure the new switch for VTP transparent mode and then back to VTP client or 
server mode.
■
Erase the new switch’s vlan.dat ﬁle in ﬂash and reload the switch. This ﬁle contains the 
switch’s VLAN database, including the revision number.
Avoiding VTP Problems Through Best Practices
Besides the suggestion of resetting the VLAN database revision number before installing a 
new switch, a couple of other good VTP conventions, called best practices, can help avoid 
some of the pitfalls of VTP. These are as follows:
■
If you do not intend to use VTP, conﬁgure each switch to use transparent mode.  
■
If using VTP server or client mode, always use a VTP password.

Disable trunking with the switchport mode access and switchport nonegotiate 
commands on all interfaces except known trunks, preventing VTP attacks by 
preventing the dynamic establishment of trunks.
By preventing the negotiation of trunking to most ports, the attacker can never see a VTP 
update from one of your switches. With a VTP password set, even if the attacker manages 
to get trunking working to an existing switch, the attacker would then have to know the 
password to do any harm. And by using transparent mode, you can avoid the types of 
problems described earlier, in the section “Caveats When Moving Away from Default VTP 
Conﬁguration.”

Spanning Tree Protocol
When LAN designs require multiple switches, most network engineers include redundant 
Ethernet segments between the switches. The goal is simple. The switches might fail, and 
cables might be cut or unplugged, but if redundant switches and cables are installed, the 
network service might still be available for most users.
LANs with redundant links introduce the possibility that frames might loop around the 
network forever. These looping frames would cause network performance problems. 
Therefore, LANs use Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which allows the redundant LAN 
links to be used while preventing frames from looping around the LAN indeﬁnitely through 
those redundant links. This chapter covers STP, along with a few conﬁguration commands 
used to tune how STP behaves.
This chapter covers the details of STP, plus a newer variation called Rapid Spanning Tree 
Protocol (RSTP). The end of the chapter covers STP conﬁguration on 2960 series switches, 
along with some suggestions on how to approach STP problems on the exams.

Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)     61
Foundation Topics
Without Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), a LAN with redundant links would cause Ethernet 
frames to loop for an indeﬁnite period of time. With STP enabled, some switches block 
ports so that these ports do not forward frames. STP chooses which ports block so that only 
one active path exists between any pair of LAN segments (collision domains). As a result, 
frames can be delivered to each device, without causing the problems created when frames 
loop through the network.
This chapter begins by explaining the need for the original IEEE standard for STP and how 
the standard works. The second major section explains how the new and much faster Rapid 
STP (RSTP) works in comparison. The last two major sections examine the conﬁguration 
and troubleshooting of STP, respectively.
Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)
IEEE 802.1d, the ﬁrst public standard for STP, deﬁned a reasonable solution to the problem 
of frames looping around redundant links forever. The following sections begin with a more 
detailed description of the problem, followed by a description of the end result of how 
802.1d STP solves the problem. The sections end with a lengthy description of how STP 
works, as a distributed process on all LAN switches, to prevent loops.
The Need for Spanning Tree
The most common problem that can be avoided by using STP is broadcast storms. 
Broadcast storms cause broadcasts (or multicasts or unknown-destination unicasts) to loop 
around a LAN indeﬁnitely. As a result, some links can become saturated with useless copies 
of the same frame, crowding out good frames, as well as signiﬁcantly impacting end-user 
PC performance by making the PCs process too many broadcast frames. To see how this 
occurs, Figure 2-1 shows a sample network in which Bob sends a broadcast frame. The 
dashed lines show how the switches forward the frame when STP does not exist.

62     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
Figure 2-1
Broadcast Storm
Switches ﬂood broadcasts out all interfaces in the same VLAN, except the interface in 
which the frame arrived. In the ﬁgure, that means SW3 will forward Bob’s frame to SW2; 
SW2 will forward the frame to SW1; SW1 will forward the frame back to SW3; and SW3 
will forward it back to SW2 again. This frame will loop until something changes—someone 
shuts down an interface, reloads a switch, or does something else to break the loop. Also 
note that the same event happens in the opposite direction. When Bob sends the original 
frame, SW3 also forwards a copy to SW1, SW1 forwards it to SW2, and so on.
MAC table instability also occurs as a result of the looping frames. MAC table instability 
means that the switches’ MAC address tables will keep changing the information listed for 
the source MAC address of the looping frame. For example, SW3 begins Figure 2-1 with a 
MAC table entry as follows:
0200.3333.3333    Fa0/13   VLAN 1
However, now think about the switch-learning process that occurs when the looping frame 
goes to SW2, then SW1, and then back into SW3’s Gi0/1 interface. SW3 thinks, “Hmmm… 
the source MAC address is 0200.3333.3333, and it came in my Gi0/1 interface. Update my 
MAC table!” resulting in the following entry on SW3:
0200.3333.3333    Gi0/1   VLAN 1
At this point, if a frame arrives at SW3—a different frame than the looping frame that 
causes the problems—destined to Bob’s MAC address of 0200.3333.3333, SW3 would 
incorrectly forward the frame out Gi0/1 to SW1. This new frame can also loop, or the frame 
might simply never be delivered to Bob.

Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)     63
The third class of problem caused by not using STP in a network with redundancy is that 
working hosts get multiple copies of the same frame. Consider a case in which Bob sends 
a frame to Larry, but none of the switches know Larry’s MAC address. (Switches ﬂood 
frames sent to unknown destination unicast MAC addresses.) When Bob sends the frame 
(destined to Larry’s MAC address), SW3 sends a copy to SW1 and SW2. SW1 and SW2 
also ﬂood the frame, causing copies of the frame to loop. SW1 also sends a copy of each 
frame out Fa0/11 to Larry. As a result, Larry gets multiple copies of the frame, which may 
result in an application failure, if not more pervasive networking problems.
Table 2-2 summarizes the main three classes of problems that occur when STP is not used 
in a LAN with redundancy.
What IEEE 802.1d Spanning Tree Does
STP prevents loops by placing each bridge/switch port in either a Forwarding State or a 
Blocking State. Interfaces in the Forwarding State act as normal, forwarding and receiving 
frames, but interfaces in a Blocking State do not process any frames except STP messages. 
All the ports in Forwarding State are considered to be in the current spanning tree. The 
collective set of forwarding ports creates a single path over which frames are sent between 
Ethernet segments.
Figure 2-2 shows a simple STP tree that solves the problem shown in Figure 2-1 by placing 
one port on SW3 in the Blocking State.
Table 2-2
Three Classes of Problems Caused by Not Using STP in Redundant LANs  
Problem
Description
Broadcast storms
The forwarding of a frame repeatedly on the same links, consuming 
signiﬁcant parts of the links’ capacities
MAC table instability
The continual updating of a switch’s MAC address table with incorrect 
entries, in reaction to looping frames, resulting in frames being sent to the 
wrong locations
Multiple frame 
transmission
A side effect of looping frames in which multiple copies of one frame are 
delivered to the intended host, confusing the host

64     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
Figure 2-2
Network with Redundant Links and STP
Now when Bob sends a broadcast frame, the frame does not loop. Bob sends the frame to 
SW3 (Step 1), which then forwards the frame only to SW1 (Step 2), because SW3’s Gi0/2 
interface is in a Blocking State. SW1 ﬂoods the frame out both Fa0/11 and Gi0/1 (Step 3). 
SW2 ﬂoods the frame out Fa0/12 and Gi0/1 (Step 4). However, SW3 ignores the frame 
received from SW2, again because that frame enters SW3’s Gi0/2 interface, which is in a 
Blocking State.
With the STP topology in Figure 2-2, the switches simply do not use the link between SW2 
and SW3 for trafﬁc in this VLAN, which is the minor negative side effect of STP. However, 
if the link between SW1 and SW3 fails, STP converges so that SW3 forwards instead of 
blocks on its Gi0/2 interface.
How does STP manage to make switches block or forward on each interface? And how does 
it converge to change state from Blocking to Forwarding to take advantage of redundant 
links in response to network outages? The following sections answer these questions.
NOTE
The term STP convergence refers to the process by which the switches 
collectively realize that something has changed in the LAN topology, so the switches 
might need to change which ports block and which ports forward.

Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)     65
How Spanning Tree Works
The STP algorithm creates a spanning tree of interfaces that forward frames. The tree 
structure creates a single path to and from each Ethernet segment, just like you can trace a 
single path in a living, growing tree from the base of the tree to each leaf.
The process used by STP, sometimes called the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA), chooses 
the interfaces that should be placed into a Forwarding State. For any interfaces not chosen 
to be in a Forwarding State, STA places the interfaces in Blocking State. In other words, 
STP simply picks which interfaces should forward.
STP uses three criteria to choose whether to put an interface in Forwarding State:
■
STP elects a root switch. STP puts all working interfaces on the root switch in 
Forwarding State.
■
Each nonroot switch considers one of its ports to have the least administrative cost 
between itself and the root switch. STP places this least-root-cost interface, called that 
switch’s root port (RP), in Forwarding State.
■
Many switches can attach to the same Ethernet segment. The switch with the lowest 
administrative cost from itself to the root bridge, as compared with the other switches 
attached to the same segment, is placed in Forwarding State. The lowest-cost switch on 
each segment is called the designated bridge, and that bridge’s interface, attached to 
that segment, is called the designated port (DP).
All other interfaces are placed in Blocking State. Table 2-3 summarizes the reasons STP 
places a port in Forwarding or Blocking State.
NOTE
Because Ethernet bridges are seldom used today, this chapter refers only to 
switches. However, both bridges and switches use STP.
NOTE
The real reason the root places all working interfaces in a Forwarding State is 
that all its interfaces will become DPs, but it is easier to just remember that the all the root 
switches’ working interfaces will forward frames.

66     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
The STP Bridge ID and Hello BPDU
The Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) begins with an election of one switch to be the root 
switch. To better understand this election process, you need to understand the STP 
messages sent between switches as well as the concept and format of the identiﬁer used to 
uniquely identify each switch.
The STP bridge ID (BID) is an 8-byte value unique to each switch. The bridge ID consists 
of a 2-byte priority ﬁeld and a 6-byte system ID, with the system ID being based on a 
burned-in MAC address in each switch. Using a burned-in MAC address ensures that each 
switch’s bridge ID will be unique.
STP deﬁnes messages called bridge protocol data units (BPDU), which bridges and 
switches use to exchange information with each other. The most common message, called 
a Hello BPDU, lists the sending switch’s bridge ID. By listing its own unique bridge ID, 
switches can tell the difference between BPDUs sent by different switches. This message 
also lists the bridge ID of the current root switch.

placed into an STP Disabled State. So, this section uses the term working ports to refer 
to interfaces that could forward frames if STP placed the interface into a Forwarding 
State.

Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)     67
STP deﬁnes several types of BPDU messages, with the Hello BPDU being the message that 
does most of the work. The Hello BPDU includes several ﬁelds, but most importantly, it 
contains the ﬁelds listed in Table 2-4.
For the time being, just keep the ﬁrst three items from Table 2-4 in mind as the following 
sections work through the three steps in how STP chooses the interfaces to place into a 
Forwarding State. Next, the text examines the three main steps in the STP process.
Electing the Root Switch 
Switches elect a root switch based on the bridge IDs in the BPDUs. The root switch is the 
switch with the lowest numeric value for the bridge ID. Because the two-part bridge ID 
starts with the priority value, essentially the switch with the lowest priority becomes the 
root. For example, if one switch has priority 100, and another switch has priority 200, the 
switch with priority 100 wins, regardless of what MAC address was used to create the 
bridge ID for each bridge/switch.
If a tie occurs based on the priority portion of the bridge ID, the switch with the lowest 
MAC address portion of the bridge ID is the root. No other tiebreaker should be needed 
because switches use one of their own burned-in MAC addresses as the second part of their 
bridge IDs. So if the priorities tie, and one switch uses a MAC address of 0020.0000.0000 
as part of the bridge ID, and the other uses 0FFF.FFFF.FFF, the ﬁrst switch (MAC 
0200.0000.0000) becomes the root.
STP elects a root switch in a manner not unlike a political election. The process begins with 
all switches claiming to be the root by sending Hello BPDUs listing their own bridge ID as 
the root bridge ID. If a switch hears a Hello that lists a better (lower) bridge ID—called a 
Superior Hello—that switch stops advertising itself as root and starts forwarding the 
superior Hello. The Hello sent by the better switch lists the better switch’s bridge ID as the 
root. It works like a political race in which a less-popular candidate gives up and leaves the 
race, throwing her support behind another candidate. Eventually everyone agrees which

switch has the best (lowest) bridge ID, and everyone supports the elected switch—which is 
where the political race analogy falls apart.
Figure 2-3 shows the beginning of the root election process. In this case, SW1 has 
advertised itself as root, as have SW2 and SW3. However, SW2 now believes that SW1 is 
a better root, so SW2 is now forwarding the Hello originating at SW1. This forwarded Hello 
lists SW1’s BID as the root BID. However, at this point, SW1 and SW3 both still believe 
that they each are the best, so they still list their own BID as the root in their Hello BPDUs.
Figure 2-3
Beginnings of the Root Election Process
Two candidates still exist in Figure 2-3: SW1 and SW3. So who wins? Well, from the bridge 
ID, the lower-priority switch wins; if a tie occurs, the lower MAC address wins. As shown 
in the ﬁgure, SW1 has a lower bridge ID (32769:0200.0000.0001) than SW3 
(32769:0200.0003.0003), so SW1 wins, and SW3 now also believes that SW1 is the better 
switch. Figure 2-4 shows the resulting Hello messages sent by the switches.
After the election is complete, only the root switch continues to originate STP Hello BPDU 
messages. The other switches receive the Hellos, update the sender’s BID ﬁeld (and cost-
to-reach-the-root ﬁeld), and forward the Hellos out other interfaces. The ﬁgure reﬂects this 
fact, with SW1 sending Hellos at Step 1, and SW2 and SW3 independently forwarding the 
Hello out their other interfaces at Step 2.

Choosing Each Switch’s Root Port
The second part of the STP process occurs when each nonroot switch chooses its one and 
only root port. A switch’s root port (RP) is its interface through which it has the least STP 
cost to reach the root switch.
To calculate the cost, a switch adds the cost listed in a received Hello to the STP port cost 
assigned to that same interface. The STP port cost is simply an integer value assigned to 
each interface for the purpose of providing an objective measurement that allows STP to 
choose which interfaces to add to the STP topology.
Figure 2-5 shows an example of how SW3 calculates its cost to reach the root over the two 
possible paths by adding the advertised cost (in Hello messages) to the interface costs listed 
in the ﬁgure.

Figure 2-5
SW3 Calculating Cost to Reach the Root and Choosing Its RP  
As a result of the process depicted in Figure 2-5, SW3 chooses Gi0/1 as its RP, because the 
cost to reach the root switch through that port (5) is lower than the other alternative (Gi0/2, 
cost 8). Similarly, SW2 will choose Gi0/2 as its RP, with a cost of 4 (SW1’s advertised cost 
of 0 plus SW2’s Gi0/2 interface cost of 4). Each switch places its root port into a 
Forwarding State.
In more complex topologies, the choice of root port will not be so obvious. The section 
“STP Troubleshooting,” later in this chapter, shows an example in which the root port 
choice requires a little more thought.
Choosing the Designated Port on Each LAN Segment
STP’s ﬁnal step to choose the STP topology is to choose the designated port on each LAN 
segment. The designated port on each LAN segment is the switch port that advertises the 
lowest-cost Hello onto a LAN segment. When a nonroot switch forwards a Hello, the 
nonroot switch sets the cost ﬁeld in the Hello to that switch’s cost to reach the root. In effect, 
the switch with the lower cost to reach the root, among all switches connected to a segment, 
becomes the DP on that segment.
For example, in Figure 2-4, both SW2 and SW3 forward Hello messages onto the segment. 
Note that both SW2 and SW3 list their respective cost to reach the root switch (cost 4 on 
SW2 and cost 5 on SW3.) As a result, SW2’s Gi0/1 port is the designated port on that LAN 
segment.
All DPs are placed into a forwarding state, so in this case, SW2’s Gi0/1 interface will be in 
a forwarding state.

If the advertised costs tied, the switches break the tie by choosing the switch with the lower 
bridge ID. In this case, SW2 would have won, with a bridge ID of 32769:0200.0002.0002 
versus SW3’s 32769:0200.0003.0003.
The only interface that does not have a reason to be in a Forwarding State on the three 
switches in the examples shown in Figures 2-3, 2-4, and 2-5 is SW3’s Gi0/2 port. So, the 
STP process is now complete. Table 2-5 outlines the state of each port and shows why it is 
in that state.
Port costs can be conﬁgured, or you can use the default values. Table 2-6 lists the default 
port costs deﬁned by IEEE; Cisco uses these same defaults. The IEEE revised the cost 
values because the original values, set in the early 1980s, did not anticipate the growth of 
Ethernet to support 10-Gigabit Ethernet.
NOTE
A switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain if 
hubs are used. In such cases, another tiebreaker is needed: The switch chooses the 
interface with the lower internal interface number.

72     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
With STP enabled, all working switch interfaces will settle into an STP Forwarding or 
Blocking State, even access ports. For switch interfaces connected to hosts or routers, 
which do not use STP, the switch will still forward Hellos onto those interfaces. By virtue 
of being the only device sending a Hello onto that LAN segment, the switch is sending the 
least-cost Hello onto that LAN segment, making the switch become the designated port on 
that LAN segment. So, STP puts working access interfaces into a Forwarding State as a 
result of the designated port part of the STP process.
Reacting to Changes in the Network
After the STP topology—the set of interfaces in a forwarding state—has been determined, 
this set of forwarding interfaces does not change unless the network topology changes. This 
section examines the ongoing operation of STP while the network is stable, and then it 
examines how STP converges to a new topology when something changes.
The root switch sends a new Hello BPDU every 2 seconds by default. Each switch forwards 
the Hello on all DPs, but only after changing two items. The cost is changed to reﬂect that 
switch’s cost to reach the root, and the sender’s bridge ID ﬁeld is also changed. (The root’s 
bridge ID ﬁeld is not changed.) By forwarding the received (and changed) Hellos out all 
DPs, all switches continue to receive Hellos about every 2 seconds. The following list 
summarizes the steady-state operation when nothing is currently changing in the STP 
topology:
1.
The root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a cost of 0, out all its working  
interfaces (those in a Forwarding State).
2.
The nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports. After changing the Hello to 
list their own bridge ID as the sender’s BID, and listing that switch’s root cost, the 
switch forwards the Hello out all designated ports.
3.
Steps 1 and 2 repeat until something changes.

Spanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1d)     73
Each switch relies on these periodic received Hellos from the root as a way to know that its 
path to the root is still working. When a switch ceases to receive the Hellos, something has 
failed, so the switch reacts and starts the process of changing the spanning-tree topology. 
For various reasons, the convergence process requires the use of three timers. Note that all 
switches use the timers as dictated by the root switch, which the root lists in its periodic 
Hello BPDU messages. The timer and their descriptions are listed in Table 2-7.
If a switch does not get an expected Hello BPDU within the Hello time, the switch 
continues as normal. However, if the Hellos do not show up again within MaxAge time, the 
switch reacts by taking steps to change the STP topology. At that point, the switch 
essentially reevaluates which switch should be the root switch, and if it is not the root, 
which port should be its RP, and which ports should be DPs, assuming that the Hellos it was 
formerly receiving have stopped arriving.
The best way to describe STP convergence is to show an example using the same familiar 
topology. Figure 2-6 shows the same familiar ﬁgure, with SW3’s Gi0/2 in a Blocking State, 
but SW1’s Gi0/2 interface has just failed.

74     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
Figure 2-6
Reacting to Link Failure Between SW1 and SW3
SW3 reacts to the change because SW3 fails to receive its expected Hellos on its Gi0/1 
interface. However, SW2 does not need to react because SW2 continues to receive its 
periodic Hellos in its Gi0/2 interface. In this case, SW3 reacts either when MaxAge time 
passes without hearing the Hellos, or as soon as SW3 notices that interface Gi0/1 has failed. 
(If the interface fails, the switch can assume that the Hellos will not be arriving anymore.)
Now that SW3 can act, it begins by reevaluating the choice of root switch. SW3 still 
receives the Hello from SW1, forwarded by SW2, and SW1 has a lower bridge ID; 
otherwise, SW1 would not have already been the root. So, SW3 decides that SW1 is still 
the best switch and that SW3 is not the root.
Next, SW3 reevaluates its choice of RP. At this point, SW3 is only receiving Hellos on one 
interface, interface Gi0/2. Whatever the calculated cost, Gi0/2 will become SW3’s new RP. 
(The cost would be 8: SW2’s advertised cost of 4 plus Gi0/2’s interface cost of 4.)
SW3 then reevaluates its role as DP on any other interfaces. In this example, no real work 
needs to be done. SW3 was already DP on interface Fa0/13, and it continues to be the DP, 
because no other switches connect to that port.
When STP converges, a switch chooses transition interfaces from one state to another. 
However, a transition from blocking to forwarding cannot be done immediately because an

immediate change to forwarding could temporarily cause frames to loop. To prevent these 
temporary loops, STP transitions an interface through two intermediate interface states, as 
follows:
■
Listening: Like the Blocking State, the interface does not forward frames. Old, now-  
incorrect MAC table entries are timed out during this state, because the old incorrect 
MAC table entries would be the root cause of the temporary loops.
■
Learning: Interfaces in this state still do not forward frames, but the switch begins to 
learn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface.
STP moves an interface from Blocking to Listening, then to Learning, and then to 
Forwarding State. STP leaves the interface in each interim state for a time equal to the 
forward delay timer. As a result, a convergence event that causes an interface to change 
from Blocking to Forwarding requires 30 seconds to transition from Blocking to 
Forwarding. Additionally, a switch might have to wait MaxAge seconds before even 
choosing to move an interface from Blocking to Forwarding state. Following the same 
example shown in the last several ﬁgures, SW3 might wait MaxAge seconds before 
deciding that it is no longer receiving the same root BPDU on its root port (20 seconds is 
the default), and then wait 15 seconds each in Listening and Learning States on interface 
Gi0/2, resulting in a 50-second convergence delay.
Table 2-8 summarizes Spanning Tree’s various interface states for easier review.
Optional STP Features
STP has been around for over 20 years. Cisco switches implement the standard IEEE 
802.1d STP, but over the intervening years, Cisco added proprietary features to make 
improvements to STP. In some cases, the IEEE added these improvements, or something 
like them, to later IEEE standards, whether as a revision of the 802.1d standard or as an

additional standard. The following sections examine three of the proprietary additions to 
STP: EtherChannel, PortFast, and BPDU Guard.
EtherChannel
One of the best ways to lower STP’s convergence time is to avoid convergence altogether. 
EtherChannel provides a way to prevent STP convergence from being needed when only a 
single port or cable failure occurs.
EtherChannel combines multiple parallel segments of equal speed (up to eight) between the 
same pair of switches, bundled into an EtherChannel. The switches treat the EtherChannel 
as a single interface with regard to the frame-forwarding process as well as for STP. As a 
result, if one of the links fails, but at least one of the links is up, STP convergence does not 
have to occur. For example, Figure 2-7 shows the familiar three-switch network, but now 
with two Gigabit Ethernet connections between each pair of switches.
Figure 2-7
Two-Segment EtherChannels Between Switches
With each pair of Ethernet links conﬁgured as an EtherChannel, STP treats each 
EtherChannel as a single link. In other words, both links to the same switch must fail for a 
NOTE
If you plan to work on a production campus LAN network, you should probably 
learn more about STP features than is covered in this book. To do so, go to the Cisco 
software conﬁguration guide for 2960 switches and look at the chapters on STP, RSTP, 
and optional STP features. The introduction to this book lists information about how to 
ﬁnd Cisco documentation.

switch to need to cause STP convergence. Without EtherChannel, if you have multiple 
parallel links between two switches, STP blocks all the links except one. With 
EtherChannel, all the parallel links can be up and working at the same time, while reducing 
the number of times STP must converge, which in turn makes the network more available.
EtherChannel also provides more network bandwidth. All trunks in an EtherChannel are 
either forwarding or blocking, because STP treats all the trunks in the same EtherChannel 
as one trunk. When an EtherChannel is in Forwarding State, the switches load-balance 
trafﬁc over all the trunks, providing more bandwidth.
PortFast 
PortFast allows a switch to immediately place a port in Forwarding State when the port 
becomes physically active, bypassing any choices about the STP topology and bypassing 
the Listening and Learning States. However, the only ports on which you can safely enable 
PortFast are ports on which you know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking 
devices are connected.
PortFast is most appropriate for connections to end-user devices. If you turn on PortFast on 
ports connected to end-user devices, when an end-user PC boots, as soon as the PC NIC is 
active, the switch port can move to an STP Forwarding State and forward trafﬁc. Without 
PortFast, each port must wait while the switch conﬁrms that the port is a DP, and then wait 
while the interface sits in the temporary Listening and Learning States before settling into 
the Forwarding State.
STP Security
Switch interfaces that connect to end-user locations in the LAN have some security 
exposures. An attacker could connect a switch to one of these ports, with a low STP priority 
value, and become the root switch. Also, by connecting the attacker’s switch to multiple 
legitimate switches, the attacker’s switch could end up forwarding a lot of trafﬁc in the 
LAN, and the attacker could use a LAN analyzer to copy large numbers of data frames sent 
through the LAN. Also, users could innocently harm the LAN. For example, a user could 
buy and connect an inexpensive consumer LAN switch to an existing switch, possibly 
creating a loop, or possibly causing the new, relatively-low-powered switch to become the 
root.
The Cisco BPDU Guard feature helps defeat these kinds of problems by disabling a port if 
any BPDUs are received on the port. So, this feature is particularly useful on ports that 
should only be used as an access port and never connected to another switch. Additionally, 
the BPDU Guard feature is often used on the same interface that has PortFast enabled, 
because a PortFast-enabled port will already be in a Forwarding State, which increases the 
possibility for forwarding loops.

78     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
The Cisco Root Guard feature helps defeat the problem where the new rogue switch tries 
to become the root switch. The Root Guard feature allows another switch to be connected 
to the interface, and participate in STP by sending and receiving BPDUs. However, when 
the switch interface with Root Guard enabled receives a superior BPDU from the 
neighboring switch—a BPDU that has a lower/better bridge ID—the switch with Root 
Guard reacts. Not only does the switch ignore the superior BPDU, but the switch also 
disables the interface, not sending or receiving frames, as long as the superior BPDUs keep 
arriving. If the superior BPDUs stop arriving, the switch can start using the interface again.
Rapid STP (IEEE 802.1w)
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the IEEE deﬁnes STP in the 802.1d IEEE standard. 
The IEEE has improved the 802.1d protocol with the deﬁnition of Rapid Spanning Tree 
Protocol (RSTP), as deﬁned in standard 802.1w.
RSTP (802.1w) works just like STP (802.1d) in several ways:
■
It elects the root switch using the same parameters and tiebreakers.  
■
It elects the root port on nonroot switches with the same rules.
■
It elects designated ports on each LAN segment with the same rules.
■
It places each port in either Forwarding or Blocking State, although RSTP calls the 
Blocking State the Discarding State.
RSTP can be deployed alongside traditional 802.1d STP switches, with RSTP features 
working in switches that support it, and traditional 802.1d STP features working in the 
switches that support only STP.
With all these similarities, you might be wondering why the IEEE bothered to create RSTP 
in the ﬁrst place. The overriding reason is convergence. STP takes a relatively long time to 
converge (50 seconds with the default settings). RSTP improves network convergence 
when topology changes occur.
RSTP improves convergence by either eliminating or signiﬁcantly reducing the waiting 
periods that 802.1d STP needs to avoid loops during convergence. 802.1d STP requires a 
waiting period of MaxAge (default 20 seconds) before reacting to some events, whereas 
RSTP only has to wait 3*Hello (default 6 seconds). Additionally, RSTP eliminates the 
forward delay (default 15 seconds) time in both Listening and Learning States. Traditional 
STP convergence has essentially three time periods, each of which RSTP improves upon.

relatively slow convergence, and the reduction or elimination of these waiting periods 
makes RSTP convergence occur quickly.
RSTP convergence times are typically less than 10 seconds. In some cases, they can be as 
low as 1 to 2 seconds. The following sections explain the terminology and processes used 
by RSTP to overcome the shortcomings of 802.1d STP and improve convergence time.
RSTP Link and Edge Types
RSTP characterizes the types of physical connectivity in a campus LAN into three different 
types:
■
Link-type point-to-point
■
Link-type shared
■
Edge-type
Figure 2-8 shows each type.

RSTP Link and Edge Types
Figure 2-8 shows two sample networks. The network on the left is a typical campus design 
today, with no hubs. All the switches connect with Ethernet cables, and all the end-user

Like most texts, when needing to distinguish between the older 802.1d and 
newer 802.1w standards, STP refers to 802.1d, and RSTP refers to 802.1w.

devices also connect with Ethernet cables. The IEEE deﬁned RSTP to improve convergence 
in these types of networks.
In the network on the right side of the ﬁgure, hubs are still in use for connections between 
the switches, as well as for connections to end-user devices. Most networks do not use hubs 
anymore. The IEEE did not attempt to make RSTP work in networks that use shared hubs, 
and RSTP would not improve convergence in the network on the right.
RSTP calls Ethernet connections between switches links and calls Ethernet connections to 
end-user devices edges. Two types of links exist: point-to-point, as shown on the left side 
of Figure 2-8, and shared, as shown on the right side. RSTP does not distinguish between 
point-to-point and shared types for edge connections.
RSTP reduces convergence time for link-type point-to-point and edge-type connections. It 
does not improve convergence over link-type shared connections. However, most modern 
networks do not use hubs between switches, so the lack of RSTP convergence 
improvements for link-type shared doesn’t really matter.
RSTP Port States
You should also be familiar with RSTP’s new terms to describe a port’s state. Table 2-9 lists 
the states, with some explanation following the table.
Similar to STP, RSTP stabilizes with all ports either in Forwarding State or Discarding 
State. Discarding means that the port does not forward frames, process received frames, or 
learn MAC addresses, but it does listen for BPDUs. In short, it acts just like the STP 
Blocking State. RSTP uses an interim Learning State when moving an interface from a 
Discarding State to Forwarding State. However, RSTP needs to use Learning State for only 
a short time.

RSTP Port Roles
Both STP (802.1d) and RSTP (802.1w) use the concepts of port states and port roles. The 
STP process determines the role of each interface. For example, STP determines which 
interfaces are currently in the role of a root port or designated port. Then, STP determines 
the stable port state to use for interfaces in certain roles: the Forwarding State for ports in 
the RP or DP roles, and the Blocking State for ports in other roles.
RSTP adds three more port roles, two of which are shown in Figure 2-9. (The third new 
role, the disabled role, is not shown in the ﬁgure; it simply refers to shutdown interfaces.)
Figure 2-9
RSTP Port Roles
The RSTP alternate port role identiﬁes a switch’s best alternative to its current RP. In short, 
the alternate port role is an alternate RP. For example, SW3 lists Gi0/1 as its RP, but SW3 
also knows that it is receiving Hello BPDUs on interface Gi0/2. Switch SW3 has a root port, 
just as it would with STP. (See Figure 2-4 for a reminder of the steady-state ﬂow of 
BPDUs.) RSTP designates ports that receive suboptimal BPDUs (BPDUs that are not as 
“good” as the ones received on the root port) as alternate ports. If SW3 stops getting Hellos 
from the root bridge, RSTP on SW3 chooses the best alternate port as its new root port to 
begin the speedier convergence process.
The other new RSTP port type, backup port, applies only when a single switch has two links 
to the same segment (collision domain) . To have two links to the same collision domain, 
the switch must be attached to a hub, as shown in Figure 2-9 off SW2. In the ﬁgure, switch 
SW2 places one of the two ports into the designated port role (and eventually into a 
Forwarding State) and the other interface into the backup role (and eventually into the 
Discarding State). SW2 forwards BPDUs out the port in Forwarding State and gets the

same BPDU back on the port that is in Discarding State. So SW2 knows it has an extra 
connection to that segment, called a backup port. If the DP port in Forwarding State fails, 
SW2 can quickly move that backup port from a Discarding State to a Learning State and 
then a Forwarding State.
Table 2-10 lists the port role terms for both STP and RSTP.
RSTP Convergence
This section on RSTP started by telling you how similar RSTP is to STP: how they both 
choose a root using the same rules, choose designated ports using the same rules, and so 
forth. If RSTP did only the same things as STP, there would have been no need to update 
the original 802.1d STP standard with the new 802.1w RSTP standard. The main reason for 
the new standard is to improve convergence time.
The RSTP Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) works somewhat differently than its older 
predecessor. For example, under stable conditions, every switch independently generates 
and sends Hello BPDUs, rather than only changing and forwarding the Hellos sent by the 
root switch. However, under stable conditions, the end results are the same: A switch that 
continues to hear the same Hellos, with the same cost and root switch BID listed, leaves the 
STP topology as is.
The main changes with RSTP’s version of the STA occur when changes occur in the 
network. RSTP acts differently on some interfaces based on RSTP’s characterization of the 
interface based on what is connected to the interface.

Edge-Type Behavior and PortFast
RSTP improves convergence for edge-type connections by immediately placing the port in 
Forwarding State when the link is physically active. In effect, RSTP treats these ports just 
like the Cisco-proprietary PortFast feature. In fact, on Cisco switches, to enable RSTP on 
edge interfaces, you simply conﬁgure PortFast.
Link-Type Shared
RSTP doesn’t do anything differently from STP on link-type shared links. However, 
because most of the links between switches today are not shared, but are typically full-
duplex point-to-point links, it doesn’t matter.
Link-Type Point-to-Point
RSTP improves convergence over full-duplex links between switches—the links that RSTP 
calls “link-type point-to-point.” The ﬁrst improvement made by RSTP over these types of 
links relates to how STP uses MaxAge. STP requires that a switch that no longer receives 
root BPDUs in its root port must wait for MaxAge seconds before starting convergence. 
MaxAge defaults to 20 seconds. RSTP recognizes the loss of the path to the root bridge, 
through the root port, in 3 times the Hello timer, or 6 seconds with a default Hello timer 
value of 2 seconds. So RSTP recognizes a lost path to the root much more quickly.
RSTP removes the need for Listening State and reduces the time required for Learning 
State by actively discovering the network’s new state. STP passively waits on new BPDUs 
and reacts to them during the Listening and Learning States. With RSTP, the switches 
negotiate with neighboring switches by sending RSTP messages. The messages enable the 
switches to quickly determine whether an interface can be immediately transitioned to a 
Forwarding State. In many cases, the process takes only a second or two for the entire RSTP 
domain.
An Example of Speedy RSTP Convergence
Rather than explain every nuance of RSTP convergence, one example can give you plenty 
of knowledge about the process. Figure 2-10 shows a network that explains RSTP 
convergence.

84     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
Figure 2-10
RSTP Convergence Example: Steps 1 and 2
Figure 2-10 sets up the problem. On the left, in Step 1, the network has no redundancy. 
RSTP has placed all link-type point-to-point links in Forwarding State. To add redundancy, 
the network engineer adds another link-type point-to-point link between SW1 and SW4, as 
shown on the right as Step 2. So, RSTP convergence needs to occur.
The ﬁrst step of convergence occurs when SW4 realizes that it is receiving a better BPDU 
than the one that entered from SW3. Because both the old and new root BPDUs advertise 
the same switch, SW1, the new, “better” BPDU coming over the direct link from SW1 must 
be better because of lower cost. Regardless of the reason, SW4 needs to transition to 
Forwarding State on the new link to SW1, because it is now SW4’s root port.
At this point, RSTP behavior diverges from STP. RSTP on SW4 now temporarily blocks all 
other link-type ports. By doing so, SW4 prevents the possibility of introducing loops. Then 
SW4 negotiates with its neighbor on the new root port, SW1, using RSTP proposal and 
agreement messages. As a result, SW4 and SW1 agree that they can each place their 
respective ends of the new link into Forwarding State immediately. Figure 2-11 shows this 
third step.
Why can SW1 and SW4 place their ends of the new link in Forwarding State without 
causing a loop? Because SW4 blocks on all other link-type ports. In other words, it blocks 
on all other ports connected to other switches. That’s the key to understanding RSTP 
convergence. A switch knows it needs to change to a new root port. It blocks on all other 
links and then negotiates to bring the new root port to Forwarding State. Essentially, SW4 
tells SW1 to trust it and start forwarding, because SW4 promises to block all other ports 
until it is sure that it can move some of them back to Forwarding State.

RSTP Convergence Example: Steps 3 and 4
The process is not yet complete, however. The RSTP topology currently shows SW4 
blocking, which in this example is not the ﬁnal, best topology.
SW4 and SW3 repeat the same process that SW1 and SW4 just performed. In Step 4, SW4 
still blocks, preventing loops. However, SW4 forwards the new root BPDU to SW3, so 
SW3 hears two BPDUs now. In this example, assume that SW3 thinks that the BPDU from 
SW4 is better than the one received from SW2; this makes SW3 repeat the same process 
that SW4 just performed. It follows this general ﬂow from this point:
1.
SW3 decides to change its root port based on this new BPDU from SW4.
2.
SW3 blocks all other link-type ports. (RSTP calls this process synchronization.)
3.
SW3 and SW4 negotiate.
4.
As a result of the negotiation, SW4 and SW3 can transition to forwarding on their 
interfaces on either end of the link-type point-to-point link.
5.
SW3 maintains Blocking State on all other link-type ports until the next step in the 
logic.
Figure 2-12 shows some of these steps in the Step 5 portion on the left and the resulting 
behavior in Step 6 on the right.

SW3 stills blocks on its upper interface at this point. Notice that SW2 is now receiving two 
BPDUs, but the same old BPDU it had been receiving all along is still the better BPDU. So 
SW2 takes no action. And RSTP is ﬁnished converging!
Although it took several pages to explain, the process in this example might take as little as 
1 second to complete. For the CCNA exams, you should remember the terms relating to 
RSTP, as well as the concept that RSTP improves convergence time compared to STP.
STP Configuration and Verification
Cisco switches use STP (IEEE 802.1d) by default. You can buy some switches and connect 
them with Ethernet cables in a redundant topology, and STP will ensure that no loops exist. 
And you never even have to think about changing any settings!
Although STP works without any conﬁguration, you should understand how STP works, 
understand how to interpret the STP-related show commands, and know how to tune STP 
by conﬁguring various parameters. For example, by default, all switches use the same 
priority, so the switch with the lowest burned-in MAC address becomes the root. Instead, a 
switch can be conﬁgured with a lower priority, so the engineer always knows which switch 
is root, assuming that that switch is up and running.

STP Configuration and Verification     87
The following sections begin by discussing several options for load-balancing trafﬁc by 
using multiple instances of STP, followed by a short description of how to conﬁgure STP 
to take advantage of those multiple STP instances. The remainder of these sections show 
various conﬁguration examples for both STP and RSTP.
Multiple Instances of STP
When IEEE standardized STP, VLANs did not yet exist. When VLANs were later 
standardized, the IEEE did not deﬁne any standards that allowed more than one instance of 
STP, even with multiple VLANs. At that time, if a switch only followed IEEE standards, 
the switch applied one instance of STP to all VLANs. In other words, if an interface was 
forwarding, it did so for all VLANs, and if it blocked, again it did so for all VLANs.
By default, Cisco switches use IEEE 802.1d, not RSTP (802.1w), with a Cisco-proprietary 
feature called Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+). PVST+ (often abbreviated as 
simply PVST today) creates a different instance of STP for each VLAN. So, before looking 
at the tunable STP parameters, you need to have a basic understanding of PVST+, because 
the conﬁguration settings can differ for each instance of STP.
PVST+ gives engineers a load-balancing tool. By changing some STP conﬁguration 
parameters in different VLANs, the engineer could cause switches to pick different RPs and 
DPs in different VLANs. As a result, some trafﬁc in some VLANs can be forwarded over 
one trunk, and trafﬁc for other VLANs to be forwarded over a different trunk. Figure 2-13 
shows the basic idea, with SW3 forwarding odd-numbered VLAN trafﬁc over the left trunk 
(Gi0/1) and even-numbered VLANs over the right trunk (Gi0/2).

88     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
Later, when the IEEE introduced 802.1W RSTP, the IEEE still did not have a standard for 
using multiple instances of STP. So, Cisco implemented another proprietary solution to 
support one VLAN per RSTP spanning tree. Cisco has called this option both Rapid Per-
VLAN Spanning Tree (RPVST) and Per-VLAN Rapid Spanning Tree (PVRST). 
Regardless of the acronyms, the idea is just like PVST+, but as applied to RSTP: one 
instance of RSTP to control each VLAN. So, not only do you get fast convergence, but you 
can also load-balance as shown in Figure 2-13.
Later, the IEEE created a standardized option for multiple spanning trees. The IEEE 
standard (802.1s) is often called either Multiple Spanning Trees (MST) or Multiple 
Instances of Spanning Trees (MIST). MIST allows the deﬁnition of multiple instances of 
RSTP, with each VLAN being associated with a particular instance. For example, to achieve 
the load-balancing effect in Figure 2-13, MIST would create two instances of RSTP: one 
for the even-numbered VLANs and one for the odd-numbered VLANs. If 100 VLANs 
existed, the switches still would only need two instances of RSTP, instead of the 100 
instances used by PVRST. However, MIST requires more conﬁguration on each switch, 
mainly to deﬁne the RSTP instances and associate each VLAN with an instance of STP.
Table 2-11 summarizes these three options for multiple spanning trees.
Configuration Options That Influence the Spanning Tree Topology
Regardless of whether PVST+, PVRST, or MIST is used, two main conﬁguration options 
can be used to achieve the kind of load-balancing effects described around Figure 2-13: the 
bridge ID and the port cost. These options impact the per-VLAN STP topology as follows:
■
The bridge IDs inﬂuence the choice of root switch, and for nonroot switches, their 
choice of root port.
■
Each interface’s (per-VLAN) STP cost to reach the root, which inﬂuences the choice 
of designated port on each LAN segment.
The following sections point out a few details particular to the implementation of STP on 
Cisco switches, beyond the generic concepts covered earlier in this chapter.

The Bridge ID and System ID Extension
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a switch’s bridge ID (BID) is formed by combining 
the switch’s 2-byte priority and 6-byte MAC address. In practice, Cisco switches use a more 
detailed IEEE BID format that separates the priority into two parts. Figure 2-14 shows the 
more detailed format, with the former 16-bit priority ﬁeld now including a 12-bit subﬁeld 
called the system ID extension.
Figure 2-14
STP System ID Extension  
To build a switch’s BID for a particular per-VLAN STP instance, the switch must use a base 
priority setting of a multiple of decimal 4096. (These multiples of 4096, when converted to 
binary, all end with 12 binary 0s.) To create the ﬁrst 16 bits of the BID for a particular 
VLAN, the switch starts with a 16-bit version of the base priority value, which has all 
binary 0s in the last 12 digits. The switch then adds its base priority value to the VLAN ID. 
The result is that the low-order 12 bits in the original priority ﬁeld then list the VLAN ID.
A nice side effect of using the system ID extension is that PVST+ then uses a different BID 
in each VLAN. For example, a switch conﬁgured with VLANs 1 through 4, with a default 
base priority of 32,768, has a default STP priority of 32,769 in VLAN 1, 32,770 in VLAN 
2, 32,771 in VLAN 3, and so on.
Per-VLAN Port Costs
Each switch interface defaults its per-VLAN STP cost to the values shown earlier in Table 
2-6 as the revised IEEE cost values. On Cisco switches, the STP cost is based on the actual 
speed of the interface, so if an interface negotiates to use a lower speed, the default STP 
cost reﬂects that lower speed per Table 2-6. If the interface negotiates to use a different 
speed, the switch dynamically changes the STP port cost as well.
Alternatively, a switch’s port cost can be conﬁgured, either for all VLANs or for one VLAN 
at a time. After being conﬁgured, the switch ignores the negotiated speed on the interface, 
instead using the conﬁgured cost.

Next, the conﬁguration section shows how to examine the operation of STP in a simple

Verifying Default STP Operation
The following examples were taken from a small network with two switches, as shown in 
Figure 2-15. In this network, using default settings, all interfaces should forward except one 
interface on one switch on the links connecting the switches. Example 2-1 lists several 
show commands. The text following the example explains how the show command output

Example 2-1 begins with the output of the show spanning-tree vlan 3 command on SW1. 
This command ﬁrst lists three major groups of messages: one group of messages about the 
root switch, followed by another group about the local switch, and ending with interface 
role and status information. By comparing the shaded root ID and bridge ID in the ﬁrst two 
groups of messages, you can quickly tell whether the local switch is root because the bridge 
ID and root ID would be the same. In this example, the local switch (SW1) is not the root.

92     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
The third group of messages in the show spanning-tree vlan 3 command output identiﬁes 
part of the STP topology in this example by listing all interfaces in that VLAN (both access 
interfaces and trunks that could possibly support the VLAN), their STP port roles, and their 
STP port states. For example, SW1 determines that Fa0/11 plays the role of a designated 
port because no other switches compete to become the DP on that port, as shown with the 
role of ‘desg’ in the command output. Therefore, SW1 must be advertising the lowest-cost 
Hello onto that segment. As a result, SW1 places Fa0/11 into a Forwarding State.
While the command output shows that SW1 chose interface Fa0/16 as its RP, SW1’s logic 
in making this choice is not apparent from the command output. SW1 receives Hello 
BPDUs from SW2 on Fast Ethernet ports 0/16 and 0/17, both from SW2. Because both Fa0/
16 and Fa0/17 default to the same port cost (19), SW1’s path to the root is the same (19) 
over both paths. When a switch experiences a tie in regard to the cost to reach the root, the 
switch ﬁrst uses the interfaces’ port priority values as a tiebreaker. If the port priority values 
tie, the switch uses the lowest internal interface number. The interface priority and internal 
port number are listed under the heading “Prio.Nbr” in Example 2-1. In this case, SW1 is 
using the default port priority of 128 on each interface, so SW1 uses the lower port number, 
Fa0/16, as its root port, therefore placing Fa0/16 into a Forwarding State.
Note also that the command output shows Fa0/17 to be playing the role of an alternate 
(root) port, as shown with the “Altn” abbreviation in the command output. While the 
alternate port role is an RSTP concept, the Cisco 802.1d STP implementation also uses this 
concept, so the show command lists the alternate port role. However, because this port is 
neither an RP or DP, SW1 places this port into a Blocking State.
The next command in the example, show spanning-tree root, lists the bridge ID of the root 
switch in each VLAN. Note that both switches are using all default settings, so SW2 
becomes root in all four existing VLANs. This command also lists the priority portion of 
the bridge ID separately, showing the differing priority values (32,769, 32,770, 32,771, and 
32,772) based on the system ID extension explained earlier in this chapter. The last 
command in the example, show spanning-tree vlan 3 bridge id, simply lists information 
about the local switch’s bridge ID in VLAN 3.
Configuring STP Port Costs and Switch Priority
Example 2-2 shows how to impact the STP topology by conﬁguring port cost and switch 
priority. First, on SW1, the port cost is lowered on FastEthernet 0/17, which makes SW1’s 
path to the root through Fa0/17 better than the path out Fa0/16, therefore changing SW1’s 
root port. Following that, the example shows SW1 becoming the root switch by changing 
SW1’s bridge priority.

94     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
This example starts with the debug spanning-tree events command on SW1. This 
command tells the switch to issue informational log messages whenever STP performs 
changes to an interface’s role or state. These messages show up in the example as a result 
of the commands shown later in the example output.
Next, the port cost of the SW1 interface FastEthernet 0/17, in VLAN 3 only, is changed 
using the spanning-tree vlan 3 cost 2 command, in interface Fa0/17 conﬁguration mode. 
Immediately following this command, SW1 displays the ﬁrst meaningful debug messages. 
These messages basically state that Fa0/17 is now SW1’s root port, that Fa0/16 
immediately transitions to a Blocking State, and that Fa0/17 slowly transitions to a 
Forwarding State by ﬁrst going through the Listening and Learning States. You can see the 
timing of 15 seconds (per the default forward delay setting) in both the Learning and 
Listening States as shown in the shaded timestamps in the example.
Following the ﬁrst set of debug messages, the output of the show spanning-tree command 
lists FastEthernet 0/16 as Blocking and FastEthernet 0/17 as Forwarding, with the cost to 
the root bridge now only 2, based on the changed cost of interface FastEthernet 0/17.
The next change occurs when the spanning-tree vlan 3 root primary command is issued 
on SW1. This command changes the base priority to 24,576, making SW1’s VLAN 3 
priority be 24,576 plus 3, or 24,579. As a result, SW1 becomes the root switch, as shown 
in the debug messages that follow.
The spanning-tree vlan vlan-id root primary command tells a switch to use a particular 
priority value in that VLAN only, with the switch choosing a value that will cause the 
switch to become the root switch in that VLAN. To do so, this command sets the base 
priority—the priority value that is then added to the VLAN ID to calculate the switch’s 
priority—to a value lower than the current root switch’s base priority. This command 
chooses the base priority as follows:
■
24,576, if the current root has a base priority higher than 24,576  
■
4096 less than the current root’s base priority if the current root’s priority is 24,576 or 
lower
The spanning-tree vlan vlan-id root secondary command tells a switch to use a base 
priority value so that the local switch will become root if the primary root switch fails. This 
command sets the switch’s base priority to 28,672 regardless of the current root’s current 
priority value.
NOTE
Most of the conﬁguration commands for setting STP parameters can omit the 
vlan parameter, thereby changing a setting for all VLANs. For example, the spanning-
tree cost 2 command would make an interface’s STP cost be 2 for all VLANs.

STP Configuration and Verification     95
Note that the priority can also be explicitly set with the spanning-tree vlan vlan-id priority 
value global conﬁguration command, which sets the base priority of the switch. However, 
because many LAN designs rely on one known root, with one backup to the root, the other 
commands are typically preferred.
Configuring PortFast and BPDU Guard
The PortFast and BPDU Guard features can be easily conﬁgured on any interface. To 
conﬁgure PortFast, just use the spanning-tree portfast interface subcommand. To also 
enable BPDU Guard, add the spanning-tree bpduguard enable interface subcommand.
Configuring EtherChannel
Finally, the two switches do have parallel Ethernet connections that could be conﬁgured for 
EtherChannel. By doing so, STP does not block on either interface, because STP treats both 
interfaces on each switch as one link. Example 2-3 shows the SW1 conﬁguration and show 
commands for the new EtherChannel.

On 2960 switches, any port can be part of an EtherChannel, with up to eight on a single 
EtherChannel, so the EtherChannel commands are interface subcommands. The channel-
group 1 mode on interface subcommands enable EtherChannel on interfaces FastEthernet 
0/16 and 0/17. Both switches must agree on the number for the EtherChannel, 1 in this case, 
so SW2’s portchannel conﬁguration is identical to SW1’s.
The channel-group command allows for conﬁguring an interface to always be in a port 
channel (using the on keyword), or to be dynamically negotiated with the other switch 
using the auto or desirable keywords. With the on keyword used on SW1, if for some 
reason SW2 was not conﬁgured correctly for EtherChannel, the switches would not 
forward trafﬁc over the interfaces. Alternatively, the EtherChannel channel-group 
conﬁguration commands on each switch could use parameters of auto or desirable instead 
of on. With these other parameters, the switches negotiate whether to use EtherChannel. If 
negotiated, an EtherChannel is formed. If not, the ports can be used without forming an 
EtherChannel, with STP blocking some interfaces.
The use of the auto and desirable parameters can be deceiving. If you conﬁgure auto on 
both switches, the EtherChannel never comes up! The auto keyword tells the switch to wait 
for the other switch to start the negotiations. As long as one of the two switches is 
conﬁgured with as either on or desirable, the EtherChannel can be successfully negotiated.
In the rest of Example 2-3, you see several references to “port-channel” or “Po.” Because 
STP treats the EtherChannel as one link, the switch needs some way to represent the entire

EtherChannel. The 2960 IOS uses the term “Po,” short for “port channel,” as a way to name 
the EtherChannel. (EtherChannel is sometimes called port channel.) For example, near the 
end of the example, the show etherchannel 1 summary command references Po1, for port 
channel/EtherChannel 1.
Configuring RSTP
RSTP conﬁguration and veriﬁcation are incredibly anticlimactic after fully understanding 
the STP conﬁguration options covered in this chapter. Each switch requires a single global 
command, spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst. As you can tell from the command, it not only 
enables RSTP but also PVRST, running one RSTP instance for all deﬁned VLANs.
The rest of the conﬁguration commands covered in this section apply to RSTP and PVRST 
with no changes. The same commands impact the BID, the port cost, and EtherChannels. 
In fact, the spanning-tree portfast interface subcommand even works, technically making 
the interface an RSTP edge-type interface, instead of a link-type, and instantly moving the 
interface to a Forwarding State.
Example 2-4 shows an example of how to migrate from STP and PVST+ to RSTP and 
PVRST, and how to tell whether a switch is using RSTP or STP.

Of particular importance, take the time to compare the “protocol rstp” phrase shaded in the 
example with the earlier examples’ output from the show spanning-tree command. The 
earlier examples all used the default setting of STP and PVST+, listing the text “protocol 
ieee,” referring to the original IEEE 802.1d STP standard.
STP Troubleshooting
The ﬁnal sections focus on how to apply the information covered in the earlier parts of this 
chapter to new scenarios. While this section helps you prepare to troubleshoot STP 
problems in real networks, the main goal for this section is to prepare you to answer STP 
questions on the CCNA exams. (Note that these sections do not introduce any new facts 
about STP.)
STP questions tend to intimidate many test takers. One reason STP causes exam takers 
more problems is that even those with on-the-job experience might not have ever needed to 
troubleshoot STP problems. STP runs by default and works well using default 
conﬁguration settings in medium to small networks, so engineers seldom need to 
troubleshoot STP problems. Also, while the theory and commands covered in this chapter 
might be understandable, applying many of those concepts and commands to a unique 
problem on the exam takes time.
This section describes and summarizes a plan of attack for analyzing and answering 
different types of STP problems on the exam. Some exam questions might require you to 
determine which interfaces should forward or block. Other questions might want to know 
which switch is the root, which ports are root ports, and which ports are designated ports. 
Certainly, other variations of questions exist as well. Regardless of the type of question, the 
following three steps can be used to analyze STP in any LAN, and then, in turn, answer any 
STP questions on the exam:
Step 1 Determine the root switch.  
Step 2 For each nonroot switch, determine its one root port (RP) and cost to 
reach the root switch through that RP.

STP Troubleshooting     99
Step 3 For each segment, determine the designated port (DP) and the cost 
advertised by the DP onto that segment.
The following sections review the key points about each of these steps, and then list some 
tips for helping you quickly ﬁnd the answer for exam questions.
Determining the Root Switch
Determining the STP root switch is easy if you know all the switches’ BIDs; just pick the 
lowest value. If the question lists the priority and MAC address separately, as is common 
in show command output, pick the switch with the lowest priority, or in the case of a tie, 
pick the lower MAC address value.
Much like with real networks, if a question requires you to issue show commands on 
various switches to ﬁnd the root switch, an organized strategy can help you answer 
questions faster. First, remember that many variations of the show spanning-tree 
command list the root’s BID, with priority on one line and the MAC address on the next, in 
the ﬁrst part of the output; the local switch’s BID is listed in the next section. (See Example 
2-1 for a shaded example.) Also remember that Cisco switches default to use PVST+, so be 
careful to look at STP details for the correct VLAN. With these facts in mind, the following 
list outlines a good strategy:
Step 1 Pick a switch at which to begin, and ﬁnd the root switch’s BID and the local 
switch’s BID in the VLAN in question using the show spanning-tree vlan vlan-
id exec command.
Step 2 If the root BID and local BID are equal, the local switch is the root 
switch.
Step 3 If the root BID is not equal to the local switch’s BID, follow these steps:
a. Find the RP interface on the local switch (also in the show spanning-
tree command output).
b. Using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or other documentation, 
determine which switch is on the other end of the RP interface found 
in Step 3A.
c. Log in to the switch on the other end of the RP interface and repeat 
this process, starting at Step 1.
Example 2-5 shows the output of a show spanning-tree vlan 1 command. Without even 
knowing the topology of the LAN, take the time now to try this troubleshooting strategy 

100     Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol
based on the output in the example, and compare your thoughts to the explanations 
following this example.
The shaded portions of the example point out the root’s BID (priority and address) as well 
as SW2’s differing BID. Because the root switch’s BID is different, the next step should be 
to ﬁnd the root port, which is listed in two different places in the command output (Fa0/1). 
The next step would be to repeat the process on the switch on the other end of SW2’s Fa0/
1 interface, but the example does not identify that switch.
Determining the Root Port on Nonroot Switches
Each nonroot switch has one, and only one, root port (RP). (Root switches do not have an 
RP.) To choose its RP, a switch listens for incoming Hello BPDUs. For each received Hello, 
the switch adds the cost listed in the Hello BPDU to that switch’s port cost for the port on 
which the Hello was received. The least-calculated cost wins; in case of a tie, the switch 
picks the interface with the lower port priority, and if that ties, the switch picks the lower 
internal port number.
While the previous paragraph truly summarizes how a nonroot switch picks its RP, when 
an exam question supplies information about the root switch and interface port costs, a

slightly different approach can possibly speed your way to an answer. For example, 
consider the following question, asked about the network shown in Figure 2-16:
In the switched network shown in Figure 2-16, all switches and segments are 
up and working, with STP enabled in VLAN 1. SW1 has been elected root. 
SW2’s Fa0/1 interface uses a cost setting of 20, with all other interfaces using 
the default STP cost. Determine the RP on SW4.
Figure 2-16
STP Analysis Example 1
One way to go about solving this particular problem is to just apply the STP concepts as 
summarized in the ﬁrst paragraph in this section. Alternately, you might ﬁnd the solution a 
little more quickly with the following process, starting with a nonroot switch:
Step 1 Determine all possible paths over which a frame, sent by the nonroot switch, can 
reach the root switch.
Step 2 For each possible path in Step 1, add the costs of all outgoing interfaces 
in that path.
Step 3 The lowest cost found is the cost to reach the root, and the outgoing 
interface is that switch’s RP.
Step 4 If the cost ties, use the port priority tiebreaker, and if that ties, use the 
lowest port number tiebreaker.

Table 2-13 shows the work done for Steps 1 and 2 of this process, listing the paths and the 
respective costs to reach the root over each path. In this network, SW4 has ﬁve possible 
paths to the root switch. The cost column lists the interface costs in the same order as in the 
ﬁrst column, along with the total cost.
Just to ensure that the contents of the table are clear, examine the SW4 (Fa0/2) –> SW2 
(Fa0/1) –> SW1 physical path for a moment. For this path, the outgoing interfaces are 
SW4’s Fa0/2 interface, defaulting cost 19, and SW2’s Fa0/1 interface, conﬁgured for cost 
20, for a total of 39.
You should also realize which interfaces’ costs are ignored with this process. Using the 
same example, the frame sent by SW4 toward the root would enter SW2’s Fa0/4 interface 
and SW1’s Fa0/2 interface. Neither interfaces’ costs would be considered.
In this case, SW4’s RP would be its FA0/1 interface, because the least-cost path (cost 19) 
begins with that interface.
Beware of making assumptions with questions that require you to ﬁnd a switch’s RP. For 
example, in this case, it might be intuitive to think that SW4’s RP would be its Fa0/1 
interface, because it is directly connected to the root. However, if SW4’s Fa0/3 and SW3’s 
Fa0/1 interfaces were changed to a port cost of 4 each, the SW4 (Fa0/3) –> SW3 (Fa0/1) –
> SW1 path would total a cost of 8, and SW4’s RP would be its Fa0/3 interface. So, just 
because the path looks better in the diagram, remember that the deciding point is the total 
cost.
Determining the Designated Port on Each LAN Segment
Each LAN segment has a single switch that acts as the designated port (DP) on that 
segment. On segments that connect a switch to a device that does not even use STP—for 
example, segments connecting a switch to a PC or a router—the switch port is elected as 
the DP because the only device sending a Hello onto the segment is the switch. However, 
Table 2-13

Physical Path (Outgoing Interfaces)

SW4 (Fa0/2) –> SW2 (Fa0/1) –> SW1

19 + 19 + 20 = 58

STP Troubleshooting     103
segments that connect multiple switches require a little more work to discover which should 
be the DP. By deﬁnition, the DP for a segment is determined as follows:
The switch interface that forwards the lowest-cost Hello BPDU onto the 
segment is the DP. In case of a tie, among the switches sending the Hellos 
whose cost tied, the switch with the lowest BID wins.
Again, the formal deﬁnition describes what STP does, and you can apply that concept to 
any STP question. However, for the exams, if you just ﬁnished ﬁnding the RP of each 
nonroot switch, and you noted the cost to reach the root on each switch (for example, as 
shown in Table 2-13), you can easily ﬁnd the DP as follows:
Step 1 For switches connected to the same LAN segment, the switch with the lowest cost 
to reach the root is the DP on that segment.
Step 2 In case of a tie, among the switches that tied on cost, the switch with the 
lowest BID becomes the DP.
For example, consider Figure 2-17. This ﬁgure shows the same switched network as in 
Figure 2-16, but with the RPs and DPs noted, as well as each switch’s least cost to reach 
the root over its respective RP.
Figure 2-17
Picking the Designated Ports
Focus on the segments that connect the nonroot switches for a moment. For the SW2–SW4 
segment, SW4 wins by virtue of having a cost 19 path to the root, whereas SW2’s best path

is cost 20. For the same reason, SW3 becomes the DP on the SW2–SW3 segment. For the 
SW3–SW4 segment, both SW3 and SW4 tie on cost to reach the root. The ﬁgure lists the 
BIDs of the nonroot switches, so you can see that SW3’s BID is lower. As a result, SW3 
wins the tiebreaker, making SW3 the DP on that segment.
Note also that the root switch (SW1) becomes the DP on all its segments by virtue of the 
fact that the root switch always advertises Hellos of cost 0, and all other switches’ 
calculated cost must be at least 1, because the lowest allowed port cost is 1.
For the exams, you should be able to ﬁnd the root switch, then the RP on each switch, and 
then the DP on each segment, after you know the BIDs, port costs, and topology of the 
LAN. At that point, you also know which interfaces forward—those interfaces that are RPs 
or DPs—with the rest of the interfaces blocking.
STP Convergence
The STP topology—the set of interfaces in a Forwarding State—should remain stable as 
long as the network remains stable. When interfaces and switches go up or down, the 
resulting STP topology can change; in other words, STP convergence will occur. This 
section points out a few common-sense strategies for attacking these types of problems on 
the exams.
Some STP exam questions might ignore the transition details when convergence occurs, 
instead focusing on which interfaces change from Forwarding to Blocking, or Blocking to 
Forwarding, when a particular change happens. For example, a question might list details 
of a scenario and then ask, “Which interfaces change from a Blocking to a Forwarding 
State?” For these questions that compare the topologies both before and after a change, just 
apply the same steps already covered in this section, but twice: once for the conditions 
before the changes and once for the conditions that caused the change.
Other STP questions might focus on the transition process, including the Hello timer, 
MaxAge timer, forward delay timer, Listening and Learning States, and their usage, as 
described earlier in this chapter. For these types of questions, remember the following facts 
about what occurs during STP convergence:
■
For interfaces that stay in the same STP state, nothing needs to change.
■
For interfaces that need to move from a Forwarding State to a Blocking State, the 
switch immediately changes the state to Blocking.
■
For interfaces that need to move from a Blocking State to a Forwarding State, the 
switch ﬁrst moves the interface to Listening State, then Learning State, each for 
the time speciﬁed by the forward delay timer (default 15 seconds). Only then will the 
interface be placed into Forwarding State.

Troubleshooting LAN Switching
This chapter, along with Chapter 7, “Troubleshooting IP Routing,” and Chapter 11, 
“Troubleshooting Routing Protocols,” has an important job: to help you develop the 
troubleshooting skills required to quickly and conﬁdently answer certain types of questions 
on the exams. At the same time, this chapter can hopefully make you better prepared to 
solve real networking problems.
The troubleshooting chapters in this book do not have the same primary goal as the other 
chapters. Simply put, the nontroubleshooting chapters focus on individual features and 
facts about an area of technology, whereas the troubleshooting chapters pull a much broader 
set of concepts together. These troubleshooting chapters take a broader look at the 
networking world, focusing on how the parts work together, assuming that you already 
know about the individual components.
This chapter covers the same technology covered in the other chapters in this part of the 
book (Chapter 1, “Virtual LANs,” and Chapter 2, “Spanning Tree Protocol”) and the related 
prerequisite materials (as covered in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide). Also, because this chapter is the ﬁrst troubleshooting chapter in this book, it also 
explains some general concepts about troubleshooting methodology.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
Because the troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other 
chapters, including some chapters in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide, as well as show how to approach some of the more challenging questions on the 
CCNA exams, you should read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge level. 
For these reasons, the troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This 
Already?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly conﬁdent about troubleshooting LAN 
switching features covered in this book and CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide, feel free to move to the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section, near the end 
of this chapter, to bypass the majority of the chapter.
NOTE
For some thoughts about why troubleshooting is so important for the 
exams, refer to the section “Format of the CCNA Exams” in the introduction to this 
book.

110     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
Foundation Topics
This chapter has three major sections. The ﬁrst section focuses on the troubleshooting 
process as an end to itself. The second section explains how to apply the general 
troubleshooting methods speciﬁcally to a LAN switching data plane. The last section then 
lists some hints and ideas about speciﬁc types of problems related to LAN switching.
Generalized Troubleshooting Methodologies
When faced with a need to solve a networking problem, everyone uses some 
troubleshooting methodology, whether informal or formal. Some people like to start by 
checking the physical cabling and interface status of all the physical links that could affect 
the problem. Some people like to start by pinging everything that could tell you more about 
the problem, and then drilling deeper into the details. Some people might even just try 
whatever comes to mind until they intuitively know the general problem. None of these 
methods is inherently bad or good; I’ve tried all these methods, and others, and had some 
success with each approach.
While most people develop troubleshooting habits and styles that work well based on their 
own experiences and strengths, a more systematic troubleshooting methodology can help 
anyone learn to troubleshoot problems with better success. The following sections describe 
one such systematic troubleshooting methodology for the purpose of helping you prepare 
to troubleshoot networking problems on the CCNA exams. This troubleshooting 
methodology has three major branches, which generally occur in the order shown here:
■
Analyzing/predicting normal operation: The description and prediction of the 
details of what should happen if the network is working correctly, based on 
documentation, conﬁguration, and show and debug command output.
■
Problem isolation: When some problem might be occurring, ﬁnd the component(s) 
that do not work correctly as compared to the predicted behavior, again based on 
documentation, conﬁguration, and show and debug command output.
■
Root cause analysis: Identify the underlying causes of the problems identiﬁed in the 
previous step, speciﬁcally the causes that have a speciﬁc action with which the problem 
can be ﬁxed.
NOTE
The generic troubleshooting strategies and methods described here are a means 
to an end. You don’t need to study these processes or memorize them for the purposes of 
the exam. Instead, these processes can help you think through problems on the exam so 
that you can answer the questions a little more quickly and with a little more conﬁdence.

Generalized Troubleshooting Methodologies     111
Following these three steps should result in the engineer knowing how to ﬁx the problem, 
not just the problem symptoms. Next, the text explains some thoughts about how to 
approach each step of the troubleshooting process.
Analyzing and Predicting Normal Network Operation
Any network’s job is to deliver data from one end-user device to another. To analyze a 
network, an engineer needs to understand the logic used by each successive device as it 
forwards the data to the next device. By thinking about what should happen at each device, 
the engineer can describe the entire ﬂow of data.
The term data plane refers to any actions taken by networking devices for the forwarding 
of an individual frame or packet. To forward each frame or packet, a device applies its data 
plane logic and processes to the frame or packet. For example, when a LAN switch receives 
a frame in an interface in VLAN 3, the switch will make a forwarding decision based on 
the VLAN 3 entries in the MAC address table, and forward the packet. All this logic is part 
of a switch’s data plane processing.
The term control plane refers to the overhead processes that do not need to be done for each 
packet or frame. Instead, some control plane processes support the forwarding process. For 
example, VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) and IP routing protocols are examples of control 
plane processes. Other control plane processes can only be indirectly related to the data 
plane. For example, Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) can be useful for conﬁrming the 
accuracy of network documentation, but CDP can be disabled with no effect on the data 
plane forwarding processes.
To predict the expected operation of a network, or to explain the details of how a correctly 
functioning network is currently working, it can be helpful to begin by looking at either the 
control plane or data plane. This text shows the data plane ﬁrst, but in real life, you can pick 
one or the other in part based on the known symptoms of the problem.
Data Plane Analysis
Data plane troubleshooting examines each device in the expected forwarding path for the 
data, in order. The analysis begins with the host creating the original data. That host sends 
the data to some other device, which then sends the data to another device, and so on, until 
the data reaches the endpoint host. The receiving host typically sends some sort of reply, so 
to fully understand how useful communications happen, you also need to analyze the 
reverse process as well. In particular, the outward problem symptoms typically identify two 
end-user devices that cannot communicate, but the underlying problem might only be 
related to frames or packets going in one direction.

112     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
Unless a particular problem’s symptoms already suggest a speciﬁc problem, data plane 
troubleshooting should begin with an analysis of the Layer 3 data plane. If you start with 
Layer 3, you can see the major steps in sending and receiving data between two hosts. You 
can then examine each individual Layer 3 forwarding step more closely, looking at the 
underlying Layer 1 and 2 details. For example, Figure 3-1 shows the six major IP 
forwarding (data plane) steps in a small network.
Figure 3-1
Major Steps in an IP Forwarding Example
When understanding the expected behavior of Layer 3 in this case, you would need to 
consider how the packet ﬂows from left to right, and then how the reply ﬂows from right to 
left. Using the six steps in the ﬁgure, the following analysis could be done:
Step 1 Think about PC1’s IP address and mask, the IP address and mask of PC2, and 
PC1’s logic to realize that PC2 is in another subnet. This causes PC1 to choose to 
send the packet to its default gateway (R1).
Step 2 Consider R1’s forwarding logic for matching the packet’s destination IP 
address with R1’s routing table, with the expectation that R1 chooses to 
send the packet to R2 next.
Step 3 On R2, consider the same routing table matching logic as used on R1 in 
the previous step, using R2’s routing table. The matching entry should be 
a connected route on R2.
Step 4 This step relates to PC2’s reply packet, which uses the same basic logic 
as Step 1. Compare PC2’s IP address/mask with PC1’s IP address, noting 
that they are in different subnets. As a result, PC2 should send the packet 
to its default gateway, R2.

Step 5 Consider R2’s forwarding logic for packets destined to PC1’s IP address, 
with the expectation that the matching route would cause R2 to send 
these packets to R1 next.
Step 6 The ﬁnal routing step, on R1, should show that a packet destined to PC1’s 
IP address matches a connected route on R1, which causes R1 to send the 
packet directly to PC1’s MAC address.
After you have a good grasp of the expected behaviors of each step at Layer 3, you could 
then more closely examine Layer 2. Following the same ordering again, you could take a 
closer look at the ﬁrst Layer 3 routing step in Figure 3-1 (PC1 sending a packet to R1), 
examining the Layer 1 and 2 details of how the frame is sent by PC1 to be delivered to R1, 
as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2
Major Steps in a LAN Switching Forwarding Example
For this analysis, you would again begin with PC1, this time considering the Ethernet 
header and trailer, particularly the source and destination MAC addresses. Then, at Step 2, 
you would consider SW1’s forwarding logic, which compares the frame’s destination MAC 
address to SW1’s MAC address table, telling SW1 to forward the frame to SW2. Steps 3 
and 4 would repeat Step 2’s logic from SW2 and SW3, respectively.
Control Plane Analysis
Many control plane processes directly affect the data plane process. For example, IP routing 
cannot work without appropriate IP routes, so routers typically use a dynamic routing 
protocol—a control plane protocol—to learn the routes. Routing protocols are considered 
to be control plane protocols in part because the work done by a routing protocol does not 
have to be repeated for each frame or packet.
While the data plane processes lend themselves to a somewhat generic troubleshooting 
process of examining the forwarding logic at each device, control plane processes differ too 
much to allow such a generalized troubleshooting process. However, it is helpful to 
consider a speciﬁc set of troubleshooting steps for each speciﬁc control plane protocol. For

example, Chapter 1 explains how to approach troubleshooting various types of VTP 
problems.
Predicting Normal Operations: Summary of the Process
On the exams, some questions will simply require that you analyze and predict the normal 
operation of a working network. In other cases, predicting the normal behavior is just a 
precursor to isolating and ﬁxing a problem. Regardless, if the question gives you no speciﬁc 
clues about the part of the network on which to focus, the following list summarizes a 
suggested approach for ﬁnding the answers:
Step 1 Examine the data plane as follows:
a. Determine the major Layer 3 steps—including origin host to default 
router, each router to the next router, and last router to the destination 
host—in both directions.
b. For each Layer 2 network between a host and router or between two 
routers, analyze the forwarding logic for each device.
Step 2 Examine the control plane as follows:
a. Identify the control plane protocols that are used and vital to the 
forwarding process.
b. Examine each vital control plane protocol for proper operation; the 
details of this analysis differ for each protocol.
c. Defer any analysis of control plane protocols that do not affect the 
data plane’s correct operation until you clearly see a need for the 
protocol to answer that question (for example, CDP).
Problem Isolation
The troubleshooting process is seldom a sequential process. For organizational purposes, 
this chapter lists problem isolation as the second of three troubleshooting steps. However, 
this step is more likely to happen as soon as the ﬁrst step (predicting normal behavior) ﬁnds 
a problem. So, while the generic lists shown in this section help provide structure about how 
to troubleshoot a problem, the actual practice can be messy.
When you have no clues as to how to proceed, other than maybe that two hosts cannot 
communicate, it is again best to start with the Layer 3 data plane—in other words, IP 
forwarding logic. Then, when you ﬁnd an IP forwarding step that doesn’t work, examine 
that step more closely to further isolate where the problem is occurring. For example, 
consider Figure 3-1 again, which shows a packet being delivered from PC1 to PC2, and 
back, in six routing steps. In this case, however, you determine that R2 gets the packet, but 

Generalized Troubleshooting Methodologies     115
the packet is never delivered to PC2. So, you take closer look at everything from R2 to PC2 
to further isolate the problem.
After you isolate the problem to one IP forwarding step (as shown in Figure 3-1), you 
should continue to further isolate the problem to as small a number of components as 
possible. For example, if R2 gets the packet, but PC2 does not, the problem might be in R2, 
SW4, SW5, PC2, the cabling, or possibly devices left out of the network documentation.
The process to further isolate the problem typically requires thinking about functions at 
many layers of the OSI model, as well as both data plane and control plane functions. 
Continuing with the same example problem scenario, to be able to forward packets to PC2, 
R2 will need to know PC2’s MAC address as learned using Address Resolution Protocol 
(ARP). If you discover that R2 does not have an ARP entry to PC2, you might be tempted 
to think that some sort of IP-related problem exists. However, this problem might be caused 
by the SW4–SW5 trunk being down, which means that R2’s IP ARP request—a LAN 
broadcast—cannot be delivered by SW4 to SW5, and then to PC2. So, the problem with the 
packet-forwarding process from R2 to PC2 might be related to a control protocol (ARP), 
but the failed ARP request might be caused by yet other devices (SW4–SW5 trunk down), 
which might well be a Layer 2 or a Layer 1 problem.
If an exam question gives no hints as to where to start, the following process summarizes a 
good general systematic problem isolation strategy:
Step 1 Begin by examining the Layer 3 data plane (IP forwarding), comparing the results 
to the expected normal behavior, until you identify the ﬁrst major routing step that 
fails.
Step 2 Further isolate the problem to as few components as possible:
a. Examine functions at all layers, but focusing on Layers 1, 2, and 3.
b. Examine both data plane and control plane functions.
On the exams, remember that you get no extra points for good troubleshooting methods, so 
just ﬁnd the answer any way you can, even if that means you guessed a bit based on the 
context of the question. For example, the suggested process in Step 2A says to focus on 
Layers 1, 2, and 3; that suggestion is based on the fact that the CCNA exams focus mainly 
on these three layers. But you should look to shortcut this process as much as possible based 
on what the question says.
Root Cause Analysis
The ﬁnal of the three steps, root cause analysis, strives to ﬁnish the troubleshooting process 
to identify the speciﬁc device and function that needs to be ﬁxed. The root cause is the true 

116     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
reason the problem has occurred, and more importantly, it is the function that, when ﬁxed, 
solves that particular problem.
Finding the root cause is vitally important because the root cause, unlike many of the 
problems identiﬁed by the problem isolation process, has a speciﬁc solution associated with 
it. For example, continuing the same problem with R2 not being able to forward packets to 
PC2, consider the list of problems identiﬁed through problem isolation:
■
R2 cannot forward packets to PC2.
■
R2 gets no ARP reply from PC2.
■
SW4’s interface for the trunk to SW5 is in a down/down state.
■
The cable used between SW4 and SW5 uses the wrong cabling pinouts.
All these statements might be true about a particular problem scenario, but only the last 
item has an obvious actionable solution (replace with a correctly wired cable). While the 
other statements are valid and important facts found during problem isolation, they do not 
imply the speciﬁc action to take to solve the problem. As a result, the root cause analysis 
step reduces to two simple statements:
Step 1 Continue isolating the problem until you identify the true root cause, which in turn 
has an obvious solution.
Step 2 If you cannot reduce the problem to its true root cause, isolate the 
problem as much as is possible, and change something in the network, 
which will hopefully change the symptoms and help you identify the root 
cause.
Real World Versus the Exams
On the exam, you should look for clues as to the general topic for which you need to do 
some part of the troubleshooting process. For example, if the ﬁgure shows a network like 
the one in Figure 3-1, but all the multiple-choice answers refer to VLANs and VTP, start by 
looking at the LAN environment. Note that you might still want to consider Layers 1 
through 3, and both the data and control plane details, to help you ﬁnd the answers.
NOTE
This section applies generally to troubleshooting, but it is included only in this 
chapter because this is the ﬁrst chapter in the book dedicated to troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     117
Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane
The generic troubleshooting strategies explained so far in this chapter suggest beginning 
with the IP routing process at Layer 3. If the engineer identiﬁes a problem at a particular 
step in the IP forwarding process, the next step should be to examine that routing step more 
closely, including looking at the underlying Layer 1 and 2 status.
The following sections examine the tools and processes used to troubleshoot the LAN data 
plane processes at Layers 1 and 2. The rest of this chapter assumes that no Layer 3 problems 
exist; Chapters 7 and 11 examine Layer 3 troubleshooting. This chapter also makes some 
references to control plane protocols, speciﬁcally VTP and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), 
but VTP and STP have already been well covered in the two previous chapters. So, these 
sections focus speciﬁcally on the LAN switching data plane.
These sections begin with a review of the LAN switch forwarding processes and an 
introduction to the four major steps in the LAN switching troubleshooting process as 
suggested in this chapter. Next, the text examines each of these four steps in succession. 
Finally, an example of how to apply the troubleshooting process is shown.
An Overview of the Normal LAN Switch Forwarding Process
The LAN switch forwarding process, described in detail in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide Chapter 7, is relatively simple. However, before taking a closer 
look at how to use show command output to both predict normal operations and isolate the 
root cause of a forwarding problem, it is helpful to review how a switch thinks about the 
forwarding process when no problems exist. The following process steps outline that logic:
Step 1 Determine the VLAN in which the frame should be forwarded, as follows:
a. If the frame arrives on an access interface, use the interface’s access 
VLAN.
b. If the frame arrives on a trunk interface, use the VLAN listed in the 
frame’s trunking header.
Step 2 If the incoming interface is in an STP Learning or Forwarding State in 
that VLAN, add the source MAC address to the MAC address table, with 
incoming interface and VLAN ID (if not already in the table).
Step 3 If the incoming interface is not in an STP Forwarding State in that 
VLAN, discard the frame.
Step 4 Look for the destination MAC address of the frame in the MAC address 
table, but only for entries in the VLAN identiﬁed at Step 1. If the 
destination MAC is found or not found, follow these steps:

118     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
a. Found: Forward the frame out the only interface listed in the 
matched address table entry
b. Not found: Flood the frame out all other access ports in that same 
VLAN that are in an STP Forwarding State, and out all trunk ports 
that list this VLAN as fully supported (active, in the allowed list, not 
pruned, STP Forwarding)
To forward a frame, a switch must ﬁrst determine in which VLAN the frame should be 
forwarded (Step 1), learn the source MAC addresses as needed (Step 2), and then choose 
where to forward the frame. Just to make sure that the process is clear, consider an example 
using Figure 3-3, in which PC1 sends a frame to its default gateway, R1, with the MAC 
addresses shown in the ﬁgure.
Figure 3-3
Switched Network Used in Data Plane Analysis in Chapter 3
In this case, consider the frame as sent from PC1 (source MAC 0200.1111.1111) to R1 
(destination MAC 0200.0101.0101). SW1, using Step 1 of the summarized forwarding 
logic, determines whether interface Fa0/11 is operating as an access interface or a trunk. In 
this case, it is an access interface assigned to VLAN 3. For Step 2, SW1 adds an entry to its 
MAC address table, listing MAC address 0200.1111.1111, interface Fa0/11, and VLAN 3. 
At Step 3, SW1 conﬁrms that the incoming interface, Fa0/11, is in an STP Forwarding 
State. Finally, at Step 4, SW1 looks for an entry with MAC address 0200.0101.0101 in 
VLAN 3. If SW1 ﬁnds an entry that lists interface Gigabit 0/1, SW1 then forwards the 
frame only out Gi0/1. If the outgoing interface (Gi0/1) is a trunk interface, SW1 adds a 
VLAN trunking header that lists VLAN 3, the VLAN ID determined at Step 1.

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     119
For another slightly different example, consider a broadcast sent by PC1. Steps 1 through 
3 occur as before, but at Step 4, SW1 ﬂoods the frame. However, SW3 only ﬂoods the frame 
out access ports in VLAN 3 and trunk ports that support VLAN 3, with the restriction that 
SW1 will not forward a copy of the frame out ports not in an STP Forwarding State.
Although this forwarding logic is relatively simple, the troubleshooting process requires the 
application of most every LAN-related concept in both the ICND1 and ICND2 books, plus 
other topics as well. For example, knowing that PC1 ﬁrst sends frames to SW1, it makes 
sense to check the interface’s status, ensure that the interface is “up and up,” and ﬁx the 
problem with the interface if it is not. Dozens of individual items might need to be checked 
to troubleshoot a problem. So, this chapter suggests a LAN data plane troubleshooting 
process that organizes the actions into four main steps:
Step 1 Conﬁrm the network diagrams using CDP.
Step 2 Isolate interface problems.
Step 3 Isolate ﬁltering and port security problems.
Step 4 Isolate VLANs and trunking problems.
The next four sections review and explain the concepts and tools to perform each of these 
four steps. While some facts and information are new, most of the speciﬁc underlying 
concepts have already been covered, either in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide or in Chapters 1 and 2 of this book. The main goal is to help you pull 
all the concepts together so that analyzing unique scenarios—as will be required on the 
exams—takes a little less time, with a much better chance for success.
Step 1: Confirm the Network Diagrams Using CDP
The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) can be useful to verify the information in the network 
diagram as well as to complete the rest of the necessary information about the devices and 
topology. In real life, the network diagrams can be old and outdated, and a problem might 
be caused because someone moved some cables and didn’t update the diagrams. I doubt 
that Cisco would write a question with purposefully inaccurate information in the ﬁgure 
associated with the question, but the exam might easily include questions for which the 
network diagram does not list all the required information, and you need to use CDP to ﬁnd 
NOTE
The next two sections, “Step 1: Conﬁrm the Network Diagrams Using CDP,” 
and “Step 2: Isolate Interface Problems,” are also covered in the ICND1 book’s Chapter 
10. If you are reading both books to prepare for the CCNA exam, you don’t need to read 
these sections of this chapter as well as the similarly named sections of ICND1’s Chapter 
10. If you are reading both books, feel free to skip to the section “Step 3: Isolate Filtering 
and Port Security Problems.”

120     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
the rest of the details. So, this section reviews CDP, and a good ﬁrst LAN data plane 
troubleshooting step is as follows:
Step 1 Verify the accuracy of and complete the information listed in the network diagram 
using CDP.
Cisco routers, switches, and other devices use CDP for a variety of reasons, but routers and 
switches use it to announce basic information about themselves to their neighbors—
information like the host name, device type, IOS version, and interface numbers. Three 
commands in particular list the CDP information learned from neighbors, as listed in Table 
3-1. In fact, in cases for which no diagram exists, an engineer could create a diagram of 
routers and switches using show cdp command output.
The only tricky part of the process of comparing CDP output to a diagram is that the output 
lists two interfaces or ports on many lines of output. Reading left to right, the output 
typically lists the host name of the neighboring device under the heading of “Device ID.” 
However, the next heading of “Local Intrfce,” meaning ”local interface,“ is the local 
device’s interface name/number. The neighboring device’s interface name/number is on the 
right side of the command output under the heading “Port ID.” Example 3-1 lists an 
example show cdp neighbors command from SW2 in Figure 3-3. Take the time to compare 
the shaded portions of the command output to the accurate details in Figure 3-3 to see which 
ﬁelds list interfaces for which devices.
NOTE
This chapter shows a series of numbered troubleshooting steps for LAN 
switching, begun here with Step 1. The steps and their numbers are unimportant for the 
exam; the steps are just numbered in this chapter for easier reference.

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     121
CDP creates a security exposure when enabled. To avoid the exposure of allowing an 
attacker to learn details about each switch, CDP can be easily enabled. Cisco recommends 
that CDP be enabled on all interfaces that do not have a speciﬁc need for it. The most likely 
interfaces that need to use CDP are interfaces connected to other Cisco routers and switches 
and interfaces connected to Cisco IP phones. Otherwise, CDP can be enabled per interface 
using the no cdp enable interface subcommand. (The cdp enable interface subcommand 
reenables CDP.) Alternately, the no cdp run global command disables CDP for the entire 
switch, with the cdp run global command reenabling CDP globally.
Step 2: Isolate Interface Problems
A Cisco switch interface must be in a working state before the switch can process frames 
received on the interface or send frames out the interface. So, a somewhat obvious 
troubleshooting step should be to examine the state of each interface, speciﬁcally those 
expected to be used when forwarding frames, and verify that the interfaces are up and 
working.
This section examines the possible interface states on a Cisco IOS–based switch, lists root 
causes for the nonoperational states, and covers a popular problem that occurs even when 
the interface appears to be in a working state. The speciﬁc tasks for this step can be 
summarized with the following troubleshooting steps:
Step 2 Check for interface problems as follows:
a. Determine interface status code(s) for each required interface, and if 
not in a connect or up/up state, resolve the problems until the 
interface reaches the connect or up/up state.
b. For interfaces in a connect (up/up) state, also check for two other 
problems: duplex mismatches and some variations of port security 
purposefully dropping frames.

122     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
Interface Status Codes and Reasons for Nonworking States
Cisco switches use two different sets of status codes: one set of two codes (words) that uses 
the same conventions as do router interface status codes and another set with a single code 
(word). Both sets of status codes can determine whether an interface is working.
The switch show interfaces and show interfaces description commands list the two-code 
status just like routers. The two codes are named the line status and protocol status, with 
the codes generally referring to whether Layer 1 is working and whether Layer 2 is 
working, respectively. LAN switch interfaces typically show an interface with both codes 
as “up” or both codes as “down,” because all switch interfaces use the same Ethernet data 
link layer protocols, so the data link layer protocol should never have a problem.
The show interfaces status command lists a single interface status code. This single 
interface status code corresponds to different combinations of the traditional two-code 
interface status codes and can be easily correlated to those codes. For example, the show 
interfaces status command lists a “connect” state for working interfaces, which 
corresponds to the up/up state seen with the show interfaces and show interfaces 
description commands.
Any interface state other than connect or up/up means that the switch cannot forward or 
receive frames on the interface. Each nonworking interface state has a small set of root 
causes. Also, note that the exams could easily ask a question that only showed one or the 
other type of status code, so to be prepared for the exams, know the meanings of both sets 
of interface status codes. Table 3-2 lists the code combinations and some root causes that 
could have caused a particular interface status.
NOTE
This book refers to these two status codes in shorthand by just listing the two 
codes with a slash between them, for example, “up/up.”

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     123
The notconnect State and Cabling Pinouts
Table 3-2 lists several reasons why a switch interface can be in the notconnect state. Most 
of those reasons do not need much further explanation than the text in the table. For 
example, if an interface is connected to another switch, and the interface is in a notconnect 
state, check the other switch to ﬁnd out whether the other switch’s interface has been shut 
down. However, one of the reasons for a notconnect state—incorrect cable pinouts—
deserves a little more attention because it is both a common mistake and is not otherwise 
covered in this book. (Ethernet cabling pinouts are covered in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 
Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide Chapter 3.)
Ethernet unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling standards specify the pins to which each of 
the wires should connect on the RJ-45 connectors on the ends of the cable. The devices 
transmit using pairs of wires, with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-Tx using two pairs: one to 
transmit and one to receive data. When connecting two devices that use the same pair of 
pins to transmit, the cable—a crossover cable—must connect or cross the wires connected 
to each device’s transmit pair over to the other device’s expected receive pair. Conversely, 
devices that already use opposite pairs for transmitting data need a straight-through cable 
that does not cross the pairs. Figure 3-4 shows an example in a typical switched LAN, with 
the types of cabling pinouts shown.

124     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
Effective troubleshooting requires knowledge of which devices transmit on which pairs. 
Table 3-3 lists the more common devices seen in the context of CCNA, along with the pairs 
used. Note that when connecting two types of devices from the same column, a crossover 
cable is required; when connecting two devices from different columns of the table, a 
straight-through cable is required.
Interface Speed and Duplex Issues
Switch interfaces can ﬁnd their speed and duplex settings in several ways. By default, 
interfaces that use copper wiring and are capable of multiple speeds and duplex settings use 
the IEEE-standard (IEEE 802.3x) autonegotiation process. Alternately, switch interfaces, 
routers, and most network interface cards (NIC) can also be conﬁgured to use a speciﬁc 
speed or duplex setting. On switches and routers, the speed {10 | 100 | 1000} interface 
subcommand with the duplex {half | full} interface subcommand sets these values. Note 
that conﬁguring both speed and duplex on a switch interface disables the IEEE-standard 
autonegotiation process on that interface.
The show interfaces and show interfaces status commands list both the speed and duplex 
settings on an interface, as shown in Example 3-2.

Displaying Speed and Duplex Settings on Switch Interfaces (Continued)

126     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
While both commands can be useful, only the show interfaces status command implies 
how the switch determined the speed and duplex settings. The command output lists 
autonegotiated settings with an “a-”. For example, “a-full” means full-duplex as 
autonegotiated, where as “full” means full-duplex but as manually conﬁgured. The example 
shades the command output that implies that the switch’s Fa0/12 interfaces’ speed and 
duplex were not found through autonegotiation, but Fa0/13 did use autonegotiation. Note 
that the show interfaces Fa0/13 command (without the status option) simply lists the 
speed and duplex for interface Fa0/13, with nothing implying that the values were learned 
through autonegotiation.
Cisco switches have some interesting features related to interface speed that can help you 
determine some types of interface problems. If a Cisco switch interface has been conﬁgured 
to use a particular speed, and the speed does not match the device on the other end of the 
cable, the switch interface will be in a notconnect or down/down state. However, this kind 
of speed mismatch can only occur when the speed has been manually conﬁgured on the 
switch. Cisco switch interfaces that do not have the speed command conﬁgured can 
automatically detect the speed used by the other device—even if the other device turns off 
the IEEE autonegotiation process—and then use that speed.
For example, in Figure 3-3, imagine that SW2’s Gi0/2 interface was conﬁgured with the 
speed 100 and duplex half commands (not recommended settings on a Gigabit-capable 
interface, by the way). SW2 would use those settings and disable the IEEE-standard 
autonegotiation process because both the speed and duplex commands have been 
conﬁgured. If SW1’s Gi0/1 interface did not have a speed command conﬁgured, SW1 
would still recognize the speed (100 Mbps)—even though SW2 would not use IEEE-
standard negotiation—and SW1 would also use a speed of 100 Mbps. Example 3-3 shows 
the results of this speciﬁc case on SW1.
The speed and duplex still show up with a preﬁx of ”a-“ in the example, implying 
autonegotiation. The reason is that in this case, the speed was found automatically, and the 
duplex setting was chosen because of the default values used by the IEEE autonegotiation 
process. The IEEE standards state that for ports running at 100 Mbps, if autonegotiation 
fails, use a default half-duplex setting.
Finding a duplex mismatch can be much more difﬁcult than ﬁnding a speed mismatch 
because if the duplex settings do not match on the ends of an Ethernet segment, the switch

interface will be in a connect (up/up) state. In this case, the interface works, but it might 
work poorly, with poor performance and with symptoms of intermittent problems. The 
reason is that the device using half-duplex uses carrier sense multiple access collision detect 
(CSMA/CD) logic, waiting to send when receiving a frame, believing collisions occur 
when they physically do not, and stopping sending a frame because the switch thinks a 
collision occurred. With enough trafﬁc load, the interface could be in a connect state, but 
essentially useless for passing trafﬁc, even causing the loss of vital VTP and STP messages.
To identify duplex mismatch problems, try the following actions:
■
Use commands like show interfaces on each end of the link to conﬁrm the duplex  
setting on each end.
■
Watch for increases to certain counters on half-duplex interfaces. The counters—runts, 
collisions, and late collisions—occur when the other device uses full duplex. (Note that 
these counters can also increment when legitimate collisions occur as well.)
Example 3-2 (earlier in this section) uses shading to indicate these counters in the output of 
the show interfaces command.
The root cause of duplex mismatches might be related to the defaults chosen by the IEEE 
autonegotiation process. When a device attempts autonegotiation, and the other device does 
not respond, the ﬁrst device chooses the default duplex setting based on the current speed. 
The default duplex settings, per the IEEE, are chosen as follows:
■
If the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps, default to use half-duplex.  
■
If the speed is 1000 Mbps, default to use full-duplex.
Step 3: Isolate Filtering and Port Security Problems
Generally speaking, any analysis of the forwarding process should consider any security 
features that might discard some frames or packets. For example, both routers and switches 
can be conﬁgured with access control lists (ACL) that examine the packets and frames 
being sent or received on an interface, with the router or switch discarding those packets/
frames.
The CCNA exams do not include coverage of switch ACLs, but the exams do cover a 
similar switch feature called port security. As covered in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Chapter 9, the port security feature can be used to cause the 
NOTE
Ethernet interfaces using speeds faster than 1 Gbps always use full-duplex.

128     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
switch to discard some frames sent into and out of an interface. Port security has three basic 
features with which it determines which frames to ﬁlter:
■
Limit which speciﬁc MAC addresses can send and receive frames on a switch  
interface, discarding frames to/from other MAC addresses.
■
Limit the number of MAC addresses using the interface, discarding frames to/from 
MAC addresses learned after the maximum limit was reached.
■
A combination of the previous two points.
The ﬁrst port security troubleshooting step should be to ﬁnd which interfaces have port 
security enabled, followed by a determination as to whether any violations are currently 
occurring. The trickiest part relates to the differences in what the IOS does in reaction to 
violations based on the switchport port-security violation violation-mode interface 
subcommand, which tells the switch what to do when a violation occurs. The general 
process is as follows:
Step 3 Check for port security problems as follows:
a. Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show 
running-conﬁg or show port-security).
b. Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based 
in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security 
conﬁguration, as follows:
—  shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state.
—  restrict: The interface will be in a connect state, but the show port-
security interface command will show an incrementing violations 
counter.
—  protect: The interface will be in a connect state, and the show port-
security interface command will not show an incrementing 
violations counter.
c. In all cases, compare the port security conﬁguration to the diagram as 
well as the “last source address” ﬁeld in the output of the show port-
security interface command.
One of the difﬁculties when troubleshooting port security relates to the fact that some port 
security conﬁgurations discard only the offending frames, but they do not disable the 
interface as a result, all based on the conﬁgured violation mode. All three violation modes 
discard the trafﬁc as dictated by the conﬁguration. For example, if only one predeﬁned 
MAC address of 0200.1111.1111 is allowed, the switch discards all trafﬁc on that interface, 

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     129
other than trafﬁc to or from 0200.1111.1111. However, shutdown mode causes all future 
trafﬁc to be discarded—even legitimate trafﬁc from address 0200.1111.1111—after a 
violation has occurred. Table 3-4 summarizes some of these key points for easier study.
Troubleshooting Step 3B refers to the interface err-disabled (error disabled) state. This state 
veriﬁes that the interface has been conﬁgured to use port security, that a violation has 
occurred, and that no trafﬁc is allowed on the interface at the present time. This interface 
state implies that the shutdown violation mode is used, because it is the only one of the three 
port security modes that causes the interface to be disabled. To ﬁx this problem, the 
interface must be shut down and then enabled with the no shutdown command. Example 
3-4 lists an example in which the interface is in an err-disabled state.

130     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
The output of the show port-security interface command lists a couple of items helpful in 
the troubleshooting process. The port status of “secure-shutdown” means that the interface 
is disabled for all trafﬁc as a result of a violation, and that the interface state should be “err-
disabled.” The end of the command output lists a violations counter, incremented by 1 for 
each new violation. Interestingly, with a violation mode of shutdown, the counter 
increments by 1, the interface is placed into err-disabled state, and the counter cannot 
increment anymore until the engineer uses the shutdown and no shutdown commands on 
the interface, in succession. Finally, note that the second-to-last line lists the source MAC 
address of the last frame received on the interface. This value can be useful in identifying 
the MAC address of the device that caused the violation.
The restrict and protect violation modes still cause frame discards, but with much different 
behavior. With these violation modes, the interface remains in a connect (up/up) state while 
still discarding the inappropriate frames because of port security. So, avoid the pitfall of 
assuming that an interface in a connect, or up/up, state cannot have any other reasons for 
not passing trafﬁc.
Example 3-5 shows a sample conﬁguration and show command when using protect mode. 
In this case, a PC with MAC address 0200.3333.3333 sent frames into port Fa0/13, with the 
port conﬁgured to restrict Fa0/13 to only receive frames sent by 0200.1111.1111.

This show command output was gathered after many frames had been sent by a PC with 
MAC address 0200.3333.3333, with all the frames being discarded by the switch because 
of port security. The command output shows the disallowed PC’s 0200.3333.3333 MAC 
address as the last source MAC address in a received frame. However, note that the port 
status is listed as secure-up and the violation count as 0—both indications that might make 
you think all is well. However, in protect mode, the show port-security interface 
command does not show any information conﬁrming that an actual violation has occurred. 
The only indication is that end-user trafﬁc does not make it to where it needs to go.
If this example had used violation mode restrict, the port status would have also stayed in 
a secure-up state, but the security violation counter would have incremented once for each 
violating frame.
For the exams, a port security violation might not be a problem; it might be the exact 
function intended. The question text might well explicitly state what port security should 
be doing. In these cases, it can be quicker to just immediately look at the port security 
conﬁguration. Then, compare the conﬁguration to the MAC addresses of the devices 
connected to the interface. The most likely problem on the exams is that the MAC addresses 
have been misconﬁgured or that the maximum number of MAC addresses has been set too 
low. (CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Chapter 9, explains the 
details of the conﬁguration statements.)
One last security feature that needs a brief mention is IEEE 802.1x authentication. IEEE 
802.1x (not to be confused with the IEEE 802.3x autonegotiation standard) deﬁnes a 
process to authenticate the user of the PC connected to a switch port. 802.1x can be used as 
part of an overall Network Admission Control (NAC) strategy, in which a user internal to 
an enterprise LAN cannot use the LAN until the user supplies some authentication 
credentials.

132     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
With 802.1x, each user communicates with a AAA server with a series of authentication 
messages. The access switch listens to the messages, discarding all frames on the link 
except for 802.1x messages to and from the PC. When the switch overhears the message 
from the AAA server that says that the user has been successfully authenticated, the switch 
then allows all trafﬁc to ﬂow on that port. If the user is not authenticated, the switch does 
not allow trafﬁc on that interface. The details of how to conﬁgure 802.1x, and recognize an 
authentication failure as the root cause of a particular problem, is beyond the scope of this 
book.
Step 4: Isolate VLAN and Trunking Problems
A switch’s forwarding process depends on both the deﬁnitions of access VLANs on access 
interfaces and on VLAN trunks that can pass trafﬁc for many VLANs. Additionally, before 
a switch can forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must know about a VLAN, 
either through conﬁguration or VTP, and the VLAN must be active. The following sections 
examine some of the tools regarding all these VLAN-related issues. This conﬁguration step 
includes the following steps:
Step 4 Check VLANs and VLAN trunks as follows:
a. Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs, and 
reassign into the correct VLANs as needed.
b. Determine whether the VLANs both exist (conﬁgured or learned with 
VTP) and are active on each switch. If not, conﬁgure and activate the 
VLANs to resolve problems as needed.
c. Identify the operationally trunking interfaces on each switch, and 
determine the VLANs that can be forwarded over each trunk.
The next three sections discuss Steps 4A, 4B, and 4C in succession.
Ensuring That the Right Access Interfaces Are in the Right VLANs
To ensure that each access interface has been assigned to the correct VLAN, engineers 
simply need to determine which switch interfaces are access interfaces instead of trunk 
interfaces, determine the assigned access VLANs on each interface, and compare the 
information to the documentation. The three show commands listed in Table 3-5 can be 
particularly helpful in this process.
Table 3-5

EXEC Command
Description
show vlan brief
show vlan
Lists each VLAN and all interfaces assigned to that VLAN, but 
does not include trunks

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     133
If possible, start this step with the show vlan and show vlan brief commands, because they 
list all the known VLANs and the access interfaces assigned to each VLAN. Be aware, 
however, that the output of these commands includes all interfaces that are not currently 
operationally trunking. So, these commands list interfaces in a notconnect state, err-
disabled state, and most importantly in this case, interfaces that might trunk after the 
interface comes up. For example, these commands might include interface Gi0/2 in the list 
of interfaces in VLAN 1, but as soon as Gi0/1 comes up, the interface might negotiate 
trunking—at which point the interface would no longer be an access interface and would 
no longer be listed in the output of the show vlan brief command.
If the show vlan and show interface switchport commands are not available in a particular 
test question, the show mac address-table command can also help identify the access 
VLAN. This command lists the MAC address table, with each entry including a MAC 
address, interface, and VLAN ID. If the test question implies that a switch interface 
connects to a single device PC, you should only see one MAC table entry that lists that 
particular access interface; the VLAN ID listed for that same entry identiﬁes the access 
VLAN. (You cannot make such assumptions for trunking interfaces.)
After you determine the access interfaces and associated VLANs, if the interface is 
assigned to the wrong VLAN, use the switchport access vlan vlan-id interface 
subcommand to assign the correct VLAN ID.
Access VLANs Not Being Defined or Being Active
The next troubleshooting step, Step 4B, examines the fact that a switch does not forward 
frames in an undeﬁned VLAN or in a deﬁned VLAN that is not in the active state. This 
section summarizes the best ways to conﬁrm that a switch knows that a particular VLAN 
exists, and if it exists, determines the state of the VLAN.
VTP servers and clients only display their current list of known VLANs with the show vlan 
command. Neither the running-conﬁg nor the startup-conﬁg ﬁle holds the vlan vlan-id 
global conﬁguration commands that deﬁne the VLAN, or the associated name commands 
that name a VLAN. Transparent mode switches do put these conﬁguration commands in

both the vlan.dat and the running-conﬁg ﬁle, so you can see the conﬁguration using the 
show running-conﬁg command.
After you determine that a VLAN does not exist, the problem might be that the VLAN 
simply needs to be deﬁned. If so, follow the VLAN conﬁguration process as covered in 
detail in Chapter 1, summarized as follows:
■
On VTP servers and clients, assuming that VTP is working: The VLAN must be 
conﬁgured on a VTP server, typically with the vlan vlan-id global conﬁguration 
command, with the other VTP servers and clients learning about the VLAN. The 
VLAN can also be conﬁgured as a result of the switchport access vlan vlan-id 
interface subcommand, on the VTP server at which the VLAN does not yet exist, 
causing the server to automatically create the VLAN.
■
On VTP servers and client, assuming that VTP is not working: Troubleshoot VTP 
as covered in the section “VTP Troubleshooting” in Chapter 1.
■
On a VTP transparent switch: The conﬁguration is the same as on a server, but it 
must be done on each switch, because VTP transparent mode switches do not advertise 
the new VLAN to other switches.
For any existing VLANs, also verify that the VLAN is active. The show vlan command 
should list one of two VLAN state values: active and act/lshut. The second of these states 
means that the VLAN is shut down. To solve this problem, use the no shutdown vlan vlan-
id global conﬁguration command. Note that this command must be issued on each switch, 
because this shutdown state is not advertised by VTP.
Identify Trunks and VLANs Forwarded on Those Trunks
At this step (4C), you can separate problems into two general categories as you begin to 
isolate the problem: problems with the details of how an operational trunk works and 
problems caused when an interface that should trunk does not trunk.
The ﬁrst category in this step can be easily done using the show interfaces trunk 
command, which only lists information about currently operational trunks. The best place 
to begin with this command is the last section of output, which lists the VLANs whose 
trafﬁc will be forwarded over the trunk. Any VLANs that make it to this ﬁnal list of VLANs 
in the command output meet the following criteria:
■
 The VLAN exists and is active on this switch (as covered in the previous section and 
seen in the show vlan command).
■
The VLAN has not been removed from the allowed VLAN list on the trunk (as 
conﬁgured with the switchport trunk allowed vlan interface subcommand).

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     135
■
The VLAN has not been VTP-pruned from the trunk (as done automatically by VTP, 
assuming that VTP pruning has been enabled with the vtp pruning global 
conﬁguration command).
■
The trunk is in an STP Forwarding State in that VLAN (as also seen in the show 
spanning-tree vlan vlan-id command).
Example 3-6 shows a sample of the command output from the show interfaces trunk 
command, with the ﬁnal section of the command output shaded. In this case, the trunk only 
forwards trafﬁc in VLANs 1 and 4.
The absence of a VLAN in this last part of the command’s output does not necessarily mean 
that a problem has occurred. In fact, a VLAN might be legitimately excluded from a trunk 
for any of the reasons in the list just before Example 3-6. However, for a given exam 
question, it can be useful to know why trafﬁc for a VLAN will not be forwarded over a 
trunk. The output of the show interfaces trunk command’s three lists of VLANs shows a 
progression of reasons why a VLAN is not forwarded over a trunk. To remember the details, 
review the details surrounding Chapter 1’s Example 1-4 and the few paragraphs before the 
example.
A trunk’s native VLAN conﬁguration should also be checked at this step. The native VLAN 
ID can be manually set to different VLANs on either end of the trunk. If the native VLANs 
differ, the switches will accidentally cause frames to leave one VLAN and enter another. 
For example, if switch SW1 sends a frame using native VLAN 1 on an 802.1Q trunk, SW1 
does not add a VLAN header, as is normal for the native VLAN. When switch SW2 receives 
the frame, noticing that no 802.1Q header exists, SW2 assumes that the frame is part of 
SW2’s conﬁgured native VLAN. If SW2 has been conﬁgured to think VLAN 2 is the native 
VLAN on that trunk, SW2 will try to forward the received frame into VLAN 2.

136     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
The second general class of trunking problem is that an interface that should trunk does not. 
The most likely cause of this problem is a misconﬁguration of trunking on the opposite ends 
of the link. The switchport mode {access | trunk | dynamic {desirable | auto}} interface 
subcommand tells the interface whether to trunk and the rules with which to negotiate 
trunking. You can display any interface’s administrative (conﬁgured) trunking mode, as set 
by this conﬁguration command, using the show interface switchport command. Make 
sure that you know the meaning of each of this conﬁguration command’s options as listed 
in Table 1-4 in Chapter 1, and the combinations on either end of the segment that result in 
trunking, as listed in Chapter 1’s Table 1-5.
In some cases, an interface can fail to use trunking because of a misconﬁguration of the type 
of trunking—in other words, whether to use ISL or 802.1Q. For example, if two switches 
on opposite ends of a segment conﬁgured the switchport trunk encapsulation isl and 
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1Q commands, respectively, the trunk would not 
form, because the types of trunks (the encapsulation) do not match.
Example: Troubleshooting the Data Plane
This section shows an example of how to apply the steps to a particular network and 
scenario. The scenario includes several problems based on Figure 3-5. At the beginning, 
PC1, PC2, and PC3 cannot ping their default gateway, R1, at IP address 2.2.2.9. This 
section shows how to apply the troubleshooting processes covered so far in this chapter to 
uncover the problems and ﬁx them. For easier reference, the steps have been summarized 
here as follows:
Step 1 Verify the accuracy of and complete the information listed in the network diagram  
using CDP.
Step 2 Check for interface problems as follows:
a. Determine the interface status code(s) for each required interface, 
and if not in a connect or up/up state, resolve the problems until the 
interface reaches the connect or up/up state.
b. For interfaces in a connect (up/up) state, also check for two other 
problems: duplex mismatches and some variations of port security 
purposefully dropping frames.
Step 3 Check for port security problems as follows:
a. Identify all interfaces on which port security is enabled (show 
running-conﬁg or show port-security). 

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     137
b. Determine whether a security violation is currently occurring based 
in part on the violation mode of the interface’s port security 
conﬁguration, as follows:
—  shutdown: The interface will be in an err-disabled state.
—  restrict: The interface will be in a connect state, but the show port-
security interface command will show an incrementing violations 
counter.
—  protect: The interface will be in a connect state, and the show port-
security interface command will not show an incrementing 
violations counter.
c. In all cases, compare the port security conﬁguration to the diagram as 
well as the “last source address” ﬁeld in the output of the show port-
security interface command.
Step 4 Check VLANs and VLAN trunks as follows:
a. Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs, and 
reassign into the correct VLANs as needed.
b. Determine whether the VLANs both exist (conﬁgured or learned with 
VTP) and are active on each switch. If not, conﬁgure and activate the 
VLANs to resolve problems as needed.
c. Identify the operationally trunking interfaces on each switch, and 
determine the VLANs that can be forwarded over each trunk.

Step 1: Verify the Accuracy of the Diagram Using CDP
Example 3-7 shows a variety of example output from the show cdp neighbors and show 
cdp entry commands on the three switches in Figure 3-5. A simple comparison conﬁrms 
the names and interfaces in the ﬁgure, with the exception that SW2’s Fa0/9 interface 
connects to router R1, instead of SW2’s Fa0/10 interface shown in Figure 3-5.

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     139
This mistake in documentation in Figure 3-5 (listing SW2 interface Fa0/10 instead of 
Fa0/9) does not affect the current network’s operation. However, had trunking been 
required between SW2 and R1, SW2 interface Fa0/9—not Fa0/10—would have to have 
been explicitly conﬁgured to enable trunking, because routers cannot automatically 
negotiate to use trunking. Chapter 4, “IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes,” covers the 
details of router trunking conﬁguration.
Note that CDP does not identify documentation problems with the interfaces that connect 
to the end-user PCs; for the purposes of this example, know that the rest of the interfaces 
shown in Figure 3-5 are the correct interfaces.
Step 2: Check for Interface Problems
The next step examines the interface status on each of the interfaces that should currently 
be used. Example 3-8 lists several show interface status commands on both SW1 and 
SW3. (For this chapter’s purposes, assume that all interfaces on SW2 are working 
correctly.) Examine the output, identify any problems you see, and make a list of other 
interface-related problems you might want to investigate further based on this output.

140     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
One obvious problem exists on SW1, with interface Fa0/12 in a notconnect state. Many 
reasons for this state exist, almost all relating to some cabling problem—anything from a 
cable that is not fully inserted into the switch port to difﬁcult-to-ﬁnd interference problems 
on the cable. (See Table 3-2 for suggested reasons.)
SW3’s interfaces appear not to have any problems. However, all three interfaces have a 
duplex setting that is the same setting as what the switch would use if the autonegotiation 
process failed, with the use of half-duplex on Fa0/3 being notable. That raises the 
possibility of one of the two interface problems mentioned earlier in the chapter that could 
occur when the interface is in a connect state, namely, a duplex mismatch.
You can determine that SW3’s Gigabit 0/1 and 0/2 interfaces do not have a mismatch by 
simply using the show interfaces status command on SW1 and SW2 on the other end of 
those links, respectively. However, ports connected to a PC pose a troubleshooting problem 
in that you probably will not be near the PC, so you might have to guide the end user 
through some steps to verify the speed and duplex settings. However, it is helpful to look 
for the telltale signs of runts, collisions, and early collisions, as listed in the output of the 
show interfaces command in Example 3-9.

In this case, a duplex mismatch does indeed exist. However, note that these same counters 
do increment under normal half-duplex operations, so these counters do not deﬁnitively 
identify the problem as a duplex mismatch.
In this case, SW3’s conﬁguration was changed to use full-duplex on interface Fa0/13, 
matching the manual setting on PC3.
Step 3: Check for Port Security Problems 
The next step examines the port security conﬁguration and status on each switch. Starting 
with the show port-security command is particularly helpful because it lists the interfaces 
on which the feature has been enabled. Example 3-10 shows this command on SW1 and 
SW2, plus a few other commands. Note that both SW2 and SW3 do not have the port 
security feature enabled.
Examine the output in Example 3-10, and before reading beyond the end of the example, 
make a few notes about what next steps you would take to either rule out port security as a 
potential problem, or what command you would use to further isolate a potential problem.

The show port-security commands in the example list the interfaces on which port security 
has been enabled—speciﬁcally, SW1 interface Fa0/11 and no interfaces on SW2. On SW1, 
the notable items for troubleshooting are that the security action heading, which matches 
the violation mode setting, shows an action of restrict. With the restrict setting, SW1 
interface Fa0/11 can be in the connect state (as seen in Example 3-8), but port security can 
be discarding trafﬁc that violates the port security conﬁguration. So, a closer examination 
of the port security conﬁguration is in order, as shown in Example 3-11.

Troubleshooting the LAN Switching Data Plane     143
The example begins by conﬁrming the security mode and violation counter, as well as 
showing the last MAC address (0200.1111.1111) to send a frame into interface Fa0/11. 
PC1’s MAC address (0200.1111.1111) does not match the port security conﬁguration as 
seen in the second part of the example, a conﬁguration that defaults to a maximum of one 
MAC address with an explicitly conﬁgured MAC address of 0200.3333.3333. A simple 
solution is to reconﬁgure port security to instead list PC1’s MAC address. Note that the 
engineer would not need to use the shutdown and then the no shutdown commands on this 
interface to recover the interface, because the conﬁguration uses violation mode restrict, 
which leaves the interface up while discarding the trafﬁc to/from PC1.
Finally, the end of the example shows a log message generated by the switch for each 
violation when using restrict mode. This message would be seen from the console, or from 
a Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the switch, if the remote user had issued the 
terminal monitor EXEC command.
Step 4: Check for VLAN and VLAN Trunk Problems
Step 4A begins by examining the access interfaces to ensure that the interfaces have been 
assigned to the correct VLANs. In this case, all interfaces connected to PCs and routers in 
Figure 3-5 should be assigned to VLAN 3. Example 3-12 provides some useful show 
command output. Take a few moments to read through the example, and look for any 
VLAN assignment problems.

! The following log message also points to a port security issue.

144     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
The only problem in this case is the fact that while SW2’s Fa0/10 interface was assigned to 
VLAN 3, per the drawing in Figure 3-5, SW2 connects to R1 using Fa0/9 (as seen with CDP 
in Example 3-7). Interface Fa0/9 defaults to be in VLAN 1. To solve this particular problem, 
on SW2, conﬁgure the switchport access vlan 3 interface subcommand on interface Fa0/9.
The next part of Step 4 (Step 4B) suggests to check the VLANs to ensure that the VLANs 
are active on each switch. This ongoing example only uses VLAN 3, so Example 3-13 
shows that VLAN 3 indeed is known on each switch. When reading the example, look for 
any problems with VLAN 3.

In this case, VLAN 3 exists and is active on all three switches. However, SW2 lists a 
different name than do the other two switches. The name is unimportant to the operation of 
the VLAN, so this difference does not matter. As it turns out, SW2 is using VTP transparent 
mode, with SW1 and SW3 as VTP client and server mode switches, respectively. So, the 
name of VLAN 3 (book-vlan3) matches on SW1 and SW3.
Finally, the last part of troubleshooting Step 4 (Step 4C) suggests that you conﬁrm the 
trunking status of all expected trunk interfaces. It is also helpful to determine on which 
trunks the VLANs will be forwarded. Example 3-14 lists output that helps supply the 
answers. Examine the output in the example, and before reading past the end of the 
example, list any trunks that do not currently forward trafﬁc in VLAN 3, and make a list of

By examining the end of the show interfaces trunk command on each switch, you can see 
that of both trunk interfaces on each switch, only SW2’s Gi0/2 interface is not currently 
forwarding trafﬁc in VLAN 3. Earlier in this chapter, the section “Identify Trunks and 
VLANs Forwarded on Those Trunks” listed four reasons a VLAN would be excluded from 
a trunk. However, three of the four reasons can be ruled out based on the output in the 
commands in Example 3-14 and in a few other examples in this chapter. First, if VLAN 3 
were excluded because it was not in the allowed VLAN list, or because VLAN 3 was not 
active, VLAN 3 would not be omitted from the ﬁrst two lists of VLANs in SW2’s show 
interfaces trunk command. Also, VTP pruning can be ruled out because earlier examples 
showed that all three switches have at least one interface in VLAN 3 and in a connect state,

so even if all three switches used VTP correctly, with VTP pruning enabled, VLAN 3 would 
not be pruned. So, VLAN 3 is omitted in this case because of STP.
After ﬁnding all the problems in this ongoing example, and ﬁxing the problems, PC1, PC3, 
and R1 can all ping each other. PC2, with an unspeciﬁed cabling problem, still does not 
work.
Predicting Normal Operation of the LAN Switching 
Data Plane
One of the steps in troubleshooting is to analyze what should be happening so that you can 
then compare that to what is happening—and hopefully isolate the root cause of any 
problems. These last sections of Chapter 3 complete this chapter’s examination of how 
LANs should work by examining two examples of frames forwarded through a working 
version of the same sample network used in the just-completed troubleshooting example. 
The goal of these sections is to explain how to interpret the current show command output 
on switches to predict where the switches would each forward a particular frame. The ﬁrst 
example shows a broadcast sent by PC1 in Figure 3-5, and the second example shows the 
forwarding process for a unicast frame sent by R1 to PC1’s MAC address.
PC1 Broadcast in VLAN 1
The ﬁrst working data plane example examines the path of a broadcast sent by PC1. PC1 
might not have R1’s MAC address in PC1’s ARP cache, so in that case, PC1 sends an ARP 
broadcast, with an IP destination address of 255.255.255.255 and an Ethernet destination 
address of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. This section examines what the various switches do to 
forward the broadcast to all parts of VLAN 3, as shown in Figure 3-6.

148     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
Figure 3-6
Forwarding Path from PC1 to R1 per Example 3-14
To analyze the ﬂow of the broadcast, refer to the generic forwarding process, as 
summarized in the section “An Overview of the Normal LAN Switching Forwarding 
Process,” earlier in this chapter. Earlier examples conﬁrmed that SW1 port Fa0/11 is 
assigned to VLAN 3 and that SW1’s Fa0/11 interface is an access interface. Because the 
frame is a broadcast, SW1 will ﬂood the frame. Knowing these facts, Example 3-15 lists 
enough information to predict the interfaces out which SW1 will forward the broadcast 
frame sent by PC1 by listing the output of the show spanning-tree vlan 3 active command.

Note that SW1 will not forward the frame back out Fa0/11, as the frame came in on 
Fa0/11. Also, SW1 will forward the frame out both trunk interfaces (Gi0/1 and Gi0/2). 
Also, earlier in this chapter, Example 3-14 shows evidence that both SW1’s trunks use 
802.1Q, with native VLAN 1, so SW1 will add an 802.1Q header, with VLAN ID 3, to each 
copy of the broadcast frame sent over those two trunks.
SW1’s actions mean that both SW2 and SW3 should receive a copy of the broadcast frame 
sent by PC1. In SW2’s case, SW2 happens to discard its copy of PC1’s broadcast frame 
received on SW2’s Gi0/2 interface. SW2 discards the frame because of Step 3 of the generic 
forwarding process from earlier in this chapter, because SW2’s incoming interface (Gi0/2) 
is in a Blocking State in VLAN 3. (Example 3-14 and the text following that example 
showed SW2’s Gi0/2 interface in a Blocking State for VLAN 3.) Note that SW2’s Blocking 
State did not prevent SW1 from sending the frame to SW2; instead, SW2 silently discards 
the received frame.
For the copy of PC1’s broadcast frame received by SW3 on its Gi0/1 interface, SW3 ﬂoods 
the frame. SW3 determines the frame’s VLAN based on the incoming 802.1Q header and 
ﬁnds the incoming interface in an STP Forwarding State. Based on these facts, SW3 will 
forward the frame inside VLAN 3. Example 3-16 shows the information that’s needed to 
know on which interfaces SW3 forwards the VLAN 3 broadcast.

150     Chapter 3: Troubleshooting LAN Switching
As with SW1, SW3 does not forward the broadcast out the same interface in which the 
frame arrived (Gi0/1 in this case), but SW3 does ﬂood the frame out all other interfaces in 
that VLAN and in an STP Forwarding State, namely Fa0/13 and Gi0/2. Also, because 
SW3’s Gi0/2 interface currently uses 802.1Q trunking, with native VLAN 1, SW3 adds an 
802.1Q header with VLAN ID 3 listed.
Finally, when SW2 receives the copy of the broadcast in SW2’s Gi0/1 interface from SW3, 
SW2 follows the same generic process as the other switches. SW2 identiﬁes the VLAN 
based on the incoming 802.1Q header, conﬁrms that the incoming interface is in a 
Forwarding State, and ﬂoods the broadcast out all its interfaces that are both in a 
Forwarding State and in VLAN 3. In this case, SW2 forwards the frame only out interface 
Fa0/9, connected to router R1. Example 3-17 shows the supporting command output.

SW2 does not forward the frame out Gi0/1, because the frame entered SW2’s Gi0/1 
interface.
Forwarding Path: Unicast from R1 to PC1
The second data plane example examines how switches forward unicast frames. To analyze 
the forwarding process for unicast frames, consider R1’s ARP reply in response to PC1’s 
ARP request/broadcast. The destination addresses (both IP and MAC) of R1’s ARP reply 
are PC1’s IP and MAC addresses, respectively. Figure 3-7 shows the forwarding path, with 
the examples that follow spelling out how the generic frame-forwarding process applies to 
this particular case.

When SW2 receives the frame from R1, SW1 notes that the frame entered interface Fa0/9, 
an access interface in VLAN 3. The end of Example 3-17 previously showed Fa0/9 in an 
STP Forwarding State in VLAN 3, so SW2 will attempt to forward the frame instead of 
discarding the frame. As seen next in Example 3-18, SW2’s MAC address table lists PC1’s 
MAC address—0200.1111.1111—off interface Gi0/1 and in VLAN 3, so SW2 forwards 
the frame out Gi0/1 to SW3.
When SW3 receives the frame from SW2, SW3 notes that the frame entered interface 
Gi0/2, a trunking interface, and that the trunking header listed VLAN ID 3. The end of 
Example 3-16 previously showed Gi0/2 in an STP Forwarding State in VLAN 3 
(forwarding Step 3), so SW3 will not discard the received frame because of STP. As seen 
next in Example 3-19, SW3’s MAC address table lists PC1’s MAC address—
0200.1111.1111—off interface Gi0/1 and in VLAN 3, so SW3 forwards the frame out 
Gi0/1 to SW1.
When SW1 receives the frame from SW3, SW1 notes that the frame entered interface 
Gi0/2, a trunking interface, and that the trunking header listed VLAN ID 3. The end of 
Example 3-15 previously showed SW1’s Gi0/2 in an STP Forwarding State in VLAN 3, so 
SW1 will not discard the frame because of the interface not being in an STP Forwarding

This last step points out an important fact about the MAC address table and port security. 
Note that the show mac address-table dynamic command on SW1 does not list PC1’s 
MAC address of 0200.1111.1111, so you might have been tempted to think that SW1 will 
ﬂood the frame because it is an unknown unicast frame. However, because SW1 has 
conﬁgured port security on Fa0/11, including the switchport port-security mac-address 
0200.1111.1111 interface subcommand, IOS considers this MAC address a static MAC 
address. So, by leaving off the dynamic keyword, the show mac address-table vlan 3 
command lists all MAC addresses known in the VLAN, including 0200.1111.1111. This 
command output conﬁrms that SW1 will forward the unicast to 0200.1111.1111 only out 
interface Fa0/11.

IP Routing: Static and 
Connected Routes
This chapter begins Part II, “IP Routing.” The four chapters in this part focus on features 
that impact the IP routing process—also called IP forwarding—by which hosts and routers 
deliver packets from the source host to the destination host. These four chapters also 
occasionally explain topics related to IP routing protocols, in part because IP routing, a data 
plane feature, relies heavily on the control plane work done by routing protocols.
This chapter covers several topics related to connected routes, which are routes to reach 
subnet attached to a router interface. This chapter also explains static routes, including 
default routes, as well as reviews the basic codependent topics of IP addressing and IP 
routing.

162     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Foundation Topics
This chapter introduces several straightforward concepts regarding how a router adds 
routes to its routing table without using a dynamic routing protocol. In particular, this 
chapter covers connected routes, including connected routes when a router uses LAN 
trunking. It also covers static routes, with some emphasis on how routers use special static 
routes called default routes. However, because this chapter is the ﬁrst IP-centric chapter of 
this book, it begins with a brief review of two related topics: IP routing and IP addressing.
IP Routing and Addressing
IP routing depends on the rules of IP addressing, with one of the original core design goals 
for IP addressing being the creation of efﬁcient IP routing. IP routing deﬁnes how an IP 
packet can be delivered from the host at which the packet is created to the destination host. 
IP addressing conventions group addresses into consecutively numbered sets of addresses 
called subnets, which then aids the IP forwarding or IP routing process.
IP Routing 
Both hosts and routers participate in the IP routing process. The next list summarizes a 
host’s logic when forwarding a packet, assuming that the host is on an Ethernet LAN or 
wireless LAN:
1.
When sending a packet, compare the destination IP address of the packet to the sending 
host’s  perception of the range of addresses in the connected subnet, based on the host’s 
IP address and subnet mask.
a.
If the destination is in the same subnet as the host, send the packet directly to the 
destination host. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is needed to ﬁnd the desti-
nation host’s MAC address.
NOTE
The introduction to this book describes an alternate reading plan for readers 
pursuing the CCNA 640-802 exam, which you move back and forth between CCENT/
CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide and this book. If you are using this plan, 
note that the ﬁrst major section reviews topics from the ICND1 book. If you are following 
that reading plan, feel free to skip ahead to the section “IP Forwarding by Matching the 
Most Speciﬁc Route.”
NOTE
This book uses the terms IP routing and IP forwarding as synonymous terms. 
The term IP routing protocols refers to routing protocols that routers use to dynamically 
ﬁll the routing tables with the currently best routes. Note that some texts and courses use 
the term IP routing when referring to both the packet-forwarding process and the 
protocols used to learn routes.

IP Routing and Addressing     163
b.
If the destination is not in the same subnet as the host, send the packet directly to 
the host’s default gateway (default router). ARP is needed to ﬁnd the default gate-
way’s MAC address.
Routers use the following general steps, noting that with routers, the packet must ﬁrst be 
received, whereas the sending host (as previously summarized) begins with the IP packet 
in memory:
1.
For each received frame, use the data-link trailer frame check sequence (FCS) ﬁeld to  
ensure that the frame had no errors; if errors occurred, discard the frame (and do not 
continue to the next step).
2.
Check the frame’s destination data link layer address, and process only if addressed to 
this router or to a broadcast/multicast address.
3.
Discard the incoming frame’s old data-link header and trailer, leaving the IP packet.
4.
Compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table, and ﬁnd the route that 
matches the destination address. This route identiﬁes the outgoing interface of the 
router, and possibly the next-hop router.
5.
Determine the destination data-link address used for forwarding packets to the next 
router or destination host (as directed in the routing table).
6.
Encapsulate the IP packet inside a new data-link header and trailer, appropriate for the 
outgoing interface, and forward the frame out that interface.
For example, consider Figure 4-1, which shows a simple network with two routers and three 
hosts. In this case, PC1 creates a packet to be sent to PC3’s IP address, namely 172.16.3.3. 
The ﬁgure shows three major routing steps, labeled A, B, and C: PC1’s host routing logic 
that forwards the packet toward R1, R1’s routing logic that forwards the packet toward R2, 
and R2’s routing logic that forwards the packet toward PC2.
First, consider Step A from Figure 4-1. PC1 knows its own IP address of 172.16.1.1, mask 
255.255.255.0. (All interfaces use an easy mask of 255.255.255.0 in this example.) PC1 can 
calculate its subnet number (172.16.1.0/24) and range of addresses (172.16.1.1–
172.16.1.254). Destination address 172.16.3.3 is not in PC1’s subnet, so PC1 uses Step 1B 
in the summary of host routing logic—namely, PC1 sends the packet, inside an Ethernet 
frame, to its default gateway IP address of 172.16.1.251.

164     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Figure 4-1
Example of the IP Routing Process
This ﬁrst step (Step A) of PC1 sending the packet to its default gateway also reviews a 
couple of important concepts. As you can see from the lower part of the ﬁgure, PC1 uses 
its own MAC address as the source MAC address, but it uses R1’s LAN MAC address as 
the destination MAC address. As a result, any LAN switches can deliver the frame correctly 
to R1’s Fa0/0 interface. Also note that PC1 looked for and found 172.16.1.251’s MAC 
address in PC1’s ARP cache. If the MAC address had not been found, PC1 would have had 
to use ARP to dynamically discover the MAC address used by 172.16.1.251 (R1) before 
being able to send the frame shown in Figure 4-1.
Next focus on Step B from Figure 4-1, which is the work done by router R1 to forward the 
packet. Using the router’s six summarized routing steps that preceded Figure 4-1, the 
following occurs at R1. Note that the ﬁgure denotes many of the details with letter B:
1.
R1 checks the FCS, and the frame has no errors.
2.
R1 ﬁnds its own Fa0/0 interface MAC address in the frame’s destination MAC address 
ﬁeld, so R1 should process the encapsulated packet.
3.
R1 discards the old data-link header and trailer, leaving the IP packet (as shown 
directly under the R1 icon in Figure 4-1).

4.
(In the bottom center of Figure 4-1) R1 compares the destination IP address 
(172.16.3.3) to R1’s routing table, ﬁnding the matching route shown in the ﬁgure, with 
outgoing interface Fa0/1 and next-hop router 172.16.2.252.
5.
R1 needs to ﬁnd the next-hop device’s MAC address (R2’s MAC address), so R1 looks 
and ﬁnds that MAC address in its ARP table.
6.
R1 encapsulates the IP packet in a new Ethernet frame, with R1’s Fa0/1 MAC address 
as the source MAC address, and R2’s Fa0/0 MAC address (per the ARP table) as the 
destination MAC address. R1 sends the frame.
While the steps might seem laborious, you can think of briefer versions of this logic in cases 
where a question does not require this level of depth. For example, when troubleshooting 
routing problems, focusing on Step 4—the matching of the packet’s destination IP address 
to a router’s routing table—is probably one of the most important steps. So, a briefer 
summary of the routing process might be: Router receives a packet, matches the packet’s 
destination address with the routing table, and forwards the packet based on that matched 
route. While this abbreviated version ignores some details, it can make for quicker work 
when troubleshooting problems or discussing routing issues.
To complete the example, consider the same six-step router forwarding logic as applied on 
router R2, listed with letter C in Figure 4-1, as follows:
1.
R2 checks the FCS, and the frame has no errors.
2.
R2 ﬁnds its own Fa0/0 interface MAC address in the frame’s destination MAC address 
ﬁeld, so R2 should process the encapsulated packet.
3.
R2 discards the old data-link header and trailer, leaving the IP packet (as shown 
directly under the R2 icon in Figure 4-1).
4.
(In the bottom right of Figure 4-1) R2 compares the destination IP address (172.16.3.3) 
to R2’s routing table, ﬁnding the matching route shown in the ﬁgure, with outgoing 
interface Fa0/1 and no next-hop router listed.
5.
Because no next-hop router exists, R2 needs to ﬁnd the true destination host’s MAC 
address (PC3’s MAC address), so R2 looks and ﬁnds that MAC address in its ARP 
table.
6.
R2 encapsulates the IP packet in a new Ethernet frame, with R2’s Fa0/1 MAC address 
as the source MAC address, and PC3’s MAC address (per the ARP table) as the 
destination MAC address. R1 sends the frame.
Finally, when this frame arrives at PC3, PC3 sees its own MAC address listed as the 
destination MAC address, so PC3 begins to process the frame.

166     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
The same general process works with WAN links as well, with a few different details. On 
point-to-point links, as shown in Figure 4-2, an ARP table is not needed. Because a point-
to-point link can have at most one other router connected to it, you can ignore the data-link 
addressing. However, with Frame Relay, the routing process does consider the data-link 
addresses, called data-link connection identiﬁers (DLCI). The routing details regarding 
Frame Relay DLCIs are covered later in this book in Chapter 13.
Figure 4-2
Example of the IP Routing Process
The IP routing process on both the hosts and the routers relies on these devices’ abilities to 
understand IP addressing and predict which IP addresses are in each group or subnet. The 
next section provides a brief review of IP addresses and subnetting.
IP Addressing and Subnetting 
IP addressing rules aid the IP routing processes by requiring that IP addresses be organized 
into groups of consecutively numbered IP addresses called subnets. To allow a concise way 
to refer to a subnet, IP addressing deﬁnes the concept of a subnet number and subnet mask, 
which together exactly identify the range of addresses in a subnet. For example, the routers 
in Figures 4-1 and 4-2 used routes that listed subnet number 172.16.3.0 when forwarding 
the packet destined for PC3 (172.16.3.3). The ﬁgures omitted the subnet mask to reduce 
clutter, but any device can look at subnet number 172.16.3.0, with mask 255.255.255.0, and 
know that these two numbers concisely represent the following subnet:
■
Subnet number 172.16.3.0
■
Range of usable addresses in the subnet: 172.16.3.1–172.16.3.254

IP Routing and Addressing     167
The following list provides a brief review of some of the major IP addressing concepts. 
Note that this chapter solely focuses on IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses, with Chapter 17, “IP 
Version 6,” covering IPv6.
■
Unicast IP addresses are IP addresses that can be assigned to an individual interface for  
sending and receiving packets.
■
Each unicast IP address resides in a particular Class A, B, or C network, called a 
classful IP network.
■
If subnetting is used, which is almost always true in real life, each unicast IP address 
also resides in a speciﬁc subset of the classful network called a subnet.
■
The subnet mask, written in either dotted decimal form (for example, 255.255.255.0) 
or preﬁx notation form (for example, /24), identiﬁes the structure of unicast IP 
addresses and allows devices and people to derive the subnet number, range of 
addresses, and broadcast address for a subnet.
■
Devices in the same subnet should all use the same subnet mask; otherwise, they have 
different opinions about the range of addresses in the subnet, which can break the IP 
routing process.
■
Devices in a single VLAN should be in the same single IP subnet.
■
Devices in different VLANs should be in different IP subnets.
■
To forward packets between subnets, a device that performs routing must be used. In 
this book, only routers are shown, but multilayer switches—switches that also perform 
routing functions—can also be used.
■
Point-to-point serial links use a different subnet than the LAN subnets, but these 
subnets only require two IP addresses, one for each router interface on either end of the 
link.
■
Hosts separated by a router must be in separate subnets.
Figure 4-3 shows an example internetwork that exhibits many of these features. Switch 
SW1 defaults to put all interfaces into VLAN 1, so all hosts on the left (PC1 included) are 
in a single subnet. Note that SW1’s management IP address, also in VLAN 1, will be from 
that same subnet. Similarly, SW2 defaults to put all ports in VLAN 1, requiring a second 
subnet. The point-to-point link requires a third subnet. The ﬁgure shows the subnet 
numbers, masks, and range of addresses. Note that all addresses and subnets are part of the 
same single classful Class B network 172.16.0.0, and all subnets use a mask of 
255.255.255.0.

168     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Figure 4-3
Example IP Addressing Design
Figure 4-3 lists the subnet numbers, ranges of addresses, and subnet broadcast addresses. 
However, each device in the ﬁgure can ﬁnd the same information just based on its respective 
IP address and subnet mask conﬁguration, deriving the subnet number, range of addresses, 
and broadcast address for each attached subnet.
The CCNA exams require mastery of these IP addressing and subnetting concepts, but more 
signiﬁcantly, the exams require mastery of the math used to analyze existing IP networks 
and design new IP networks. If you have not already taken the time to master subnetting, it 
would be useful to study and practice before going further in your reading. While this 
section reviewed the basics of IP addressing, it does not cover subnetting math.
To learn about subnetting and the related math, you have a couple of options. For those of 
you who bought the two-book library that includes this book as well as CCENT/CCNA 
ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, dig into Chapter 12 of that book and do the 
practice problems listed. For those of you that bought this without the ICND1 book, all the 
resources for learning subnetting in the ICND1 book have been included on this book’s CD. 
Refer to the following elements:
■

■
CD-only Appendix E, “Subnetting Reference Pages”
■
CD-only Appendix H, “ICND1 Chapter 12: IP Addressing and Subnetting”

Subnetting videos
To be prepared to read the rest of this book without letting the subnetting math cause any 
difﬁculties, before reading any further in this book, you should be able to do the tasks in the 
following list, given plenty of time. You do not have to be able to ﬁnd the answer quickly 
at this point in your preparation, but to be prepared for the exams, you need to be ready to 
do these tasks within the listed time limits:

Given a dotted decimal mask, convert it to preﬁx notation, or vice versa. (Suggested

With these details of subnetting in mind, the next section examines how a router matches 
the routing table when the subnets listed in the routing table overlap so that one packet’s 
destination matches more than one route.
IP Forwarding by Matching the Most Specific Route
Any router’s IP routing process requires that the router compare the destination IP address 
of each packet with the existing contents of that router’s IP routing table. Often, only one 
route matches a particular destination address. However, in some cases, a particular 
destination address matches more than one of the router’s routes. Some legitimate and 
normal reasons for the overlapping routes in a routing table include the following:
■
The use of autosummary
■
Manual route summarization
■
The use of static routes
■
Incorrectly designed subnetting so that subnets overlap their address ranges
Chapter 5, “VLSM and Route Summarization,” explains more detail about each of these 
reasons. While some cases of overlapping routes are problems, other cases are normal 
operation resulting from some other feature. This section focuses on how a router chooses 
which of the overlapping routes to use, with the features that cause the overlap being 
covered in Chapter 5.
The following statement summarizes a router’s forwarding logic with overlapping routes:
When a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a  
router’s routing table, the router uses the most speciﬁc route—in other words, 
the route with the longest preﬁx length.

170     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
To see exactly what that means, the routing table listed in Example 4-1 shows a series of 
overlapping routes. First, before reading any text beneath the example, try to predict which 
route would be used for packets sent to the following IP addresses: 172.16.1.1, 172.16.1.2, 
172.16.2.3, and 172.16.4.3.
While a diagram of the internetwork might be supplied with the question, you really only 
need two pieces of information to determine which route will be matched: the destination 
IP address of the packet and the contents of the router’s routing table. By examining each 
subnet and mask in the routing table, you can then determine the range of IP addresses in 
each subnet. In this case, the ranges deﬁned by each route, respectively, are as follows:
■
172.16.1.1 (just this one address)
■
172.16.1.0–172.16.1.255
■
172.16.0.0–172.16.3.255
■
172.16.0.0–172.16.255.255
■
0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255 (all addresses)

and is explained later in this chapter.

IP Routing and Addressing     171
As you can see from these ranges, several of the routes’ address ranges overlap. When 
matching more than one route, the route with the longer preﬁx length is used. For example:
■
172.16.1.1: Matches all ﬁve routes; longest preﬁx is /32, the route to 172.16.1.1/32.
■
172.16.1.2: Matches last four routes; longest preﬁx is /24, the route to 172.16.1.0/24.
■
172.16.2.3: Matches last three routes; longest preﬁx is /22, the route to 172.16.0.0/22.
■
172.16.4.3: Matches the last two routes; longest preﬁx is /16, the route to 172.16.0.0/16.
Besides just doing the subnetting math on every route in the routing table, the show ip route 
ip-address command can also be particularly useful. This command lists detailed information 
about the route that the router matches for the IP address listed in the command. If multiple 
routes are matched for the IP address, this command lists the best route: the route with the 
longest preﬁx. For example, Example 4-1 lists the output of the show ip route 172.16.4.3 
command. The ﬁrst line of (highlighted) output lists the matched route: the route to 
172.16.0.0/16. The rest of the output lists the details of that particular route. This command 
can be handy command for both real life and for Sim questions on the exams.
DNS, DHCP, ARP, and ICMP
The IP routing process uses several related protocols, including the ARP protocol already 
mentioned in this chapter. Before moving on to the new topics for this chapter, this section 
reviews several related protocols.
Before a host can send any IP packets, the host needs to know several IP-related parameters. 
Hosts often use Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) to learn these key facts, 
including:
■
The host’s IP address 
■
The associated subnet mask
■
The IP address of the default gateway (router)
■
The IP address(s) of the DNS server(s)
To learn this information, the host—a DHCP client—sends a broadcast that eventually 
reaches a DHCP server. The server can then lease an IP address to that host and supply the 
other information in the previous list. At that point, the host has an IP address with which 
to use as a source IP address, and enough information to make the simple host routing 
decision of whether to send packets directly to another host (same subnet) or to the default 
gateway (another subnet). (In Microsoft Windows XP, the ipconﬁg /all command lists the 
host’s interfaces as the information listed before this paragraph.)

172     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Typically the user either directly or indirectly refers to another host’s host name, which in 
turn causes the host to need to send a packet to the other host. For example, opening a web 
browser and typing in http://www.cisco.com as the URL identiﬁes the host name of a web 
server owned by Cisco. Opening an e-mail client like Microsoft Outlook indirectly 
references a host name. The e-mail client was likely conﬁgured to know the host name of 
both an incoming and outgoing e-mail server, so while the user does not look at the settings 
every day, the e-mail client software knows the name of the hosts with which to exchange 
mail.
Because hosts cannot send packets to a destination host name, most hosts use Domain 
Name System (DNS) protocols to resolve the name into its associated IP address. The host 
acts as a DNS client, sending messages to the unicast IP address of the DNS server. The 
DNS request lists the name (for example, www.cisco.com), with the server replying with 
the IP address that corresponds to that host name. After it is learned, the host can cache the 
name-to-address information, only needing to resolve that name again after the entry has 
timed out. (In Windows XP, the ipconﬁg /displaydns command lists the host’s current list 
of names and addresses.)
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) includes many different functions, all focused 
on the control and management of IP. ICMP deﬁnes a varied set of messages for different 
purposes, including the ICMP Echo Request and ICMP Echo Reply messages. The popular 
ping command tests the route to a remote host, and the reverse route back to the original 
host, by sending Echo Request messages to the destination IP address and with that 
destination host replying to each Echo Request message with an Echo Reply message. 
When the ping command receives the Echo Reply messages, the command knows that the 
route between the two hosts works.
All these protocols work together to help the IP routing process, but DHCP, DNS, ICMP, 
and ARP typically do not occur for every packet. For example, imagine a new host 
computer connects to a LAN, and the user types the ping www.cisco.com command. 
DHCP might well be used as the OS boots, when the PC uses DHCP to learn its IP address 
and other information, but then DHCP might not be used for days. The PC then uses DNS 
to resolve www.cisco.com into an IP address, but then the PC does not need to use DNS 
again until a new host name is referenced. If the host was pinging the remote host, the local 
host then creates an IP packet, with an ICMP Echo Request inside the packet, with a 
destination IP address of the addresses learned by the earlier DNS request. Finally, because 
the host just came up, it does not have an ARP entry for its default gateway, so the host must 
use ARP to ﬁnd the default gateway’s IP address. Only then can the packet be sent to the 
true destination host, as described in the ﬁrst part of this chapter. For subsequent packets 
sent to the same host name, these overhead protocols likely do not need to be used again, 
and the local host can just send the new packet.

IP Routing and Addressing     173
The following list summarizes the steps used by a host, as needed, for the protocols 
mentioned in this section:
1.
If not known yet, the host uses DHCP to learn its IP address, subnet mask, DNS IP  
addresses, and default gateway IP address. If already known, the host skips this step.
2.
If the user references a host name not currently held in the host’s name cache, the host 
makes a DNS request to resolve the name into its corresponding IP address. Otherwise, 
the host skips this step.
3.
If the user issued the ping command, the IP packet contains an ICMP Echo Request; 
if the user instead used a typical TCP/IP application, it uses protocols appropriate to 
that application.
4.
To build the Ethernet frame, the host uses the ARP cache’s entry for the next-hop 
device—either the default gateway (when sending to a host on another subnet) or the 
true destination host (when sending to a host on the same subnet). If the ARP cache 
does not hold that entry, the host uses ARP to learn the information.
Fragmentation and MTU
TCP/IP deﬁnes a maximum length for an IP packet. The term used to describe that 
maximum length is maximum transmission unit (MTU).
The MTU varies based on conﬁguration and the interface’s characteristics. By default, a 
computer calculates an interface’s MTU based on the maximum size of the data portion of 
the data-link frame (where the packet is placed). For example, the default MTU value on 
Ethernet interfaces is 1500.
Routers, like any IP host, cannot forward a packet out an interface if the packet is longer 
than the MTU. If a router’s interface MTU is smaller than a packet that must be forwarded, 
the router fragments the packet into smaller packets. Fragmentation is the process of 
breaking the packet into smaller packets, each of which is less than or equal to the MTU 
value. Figure 4-4 shows an example of fragmentation in a network where the MTU on the 
serial link has been lowered to 1000 bytes through conﬁguration.

174     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Figure 4-4
IP Fragmentation
As Figure 4-4 illustrates, Koufax sends a 1500-byte packet toward Router LA. LA removes 
the Ethernet header but cannot forward the packet as is, because it is 1500 bytes and the 
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) link supports an MTU of only 1000. So LA 
fragments the original packet into two packets, each 750 bytes in length. The router does 
the math required to ﬁgure out the minimum number of fragments (two in this case) and 
breaks the original packet into equal-length packets. Because of this, any other routers the 
packets might go through are less likely to need to perform fragmentation. After forwarding 
the two packets, Boston receives the packets and forwards them without reassembling them. 
Reassembly is done by the endpoint host, which in this case is Clemens.
The IP header contains ﬁelds useful for reassembling the fragments into the original packet. 
The IP header includes an ID value that is the same in each fragmented packet, as well as 
an offset value that deﬁnes which part of the original packet is held in each fragment. 
Fragmented packets arriving out of order can be identiﬁed as a part of the same original 
packet and can be reassembled in the correct order using the offset ﬁeld in each fragment.
Two conﬁguration commands can be used to change the IP MTU size on an interface: the 
mtu interface subcommand and the ip mtu interface subcommand. The mtu command sets 
the MTU for all Layer 3 protocols; unless a need exists to vary the setting per Layer 3 
protocol, this command is preferred. If a different setting is desired for IP, the ip mtu 
command sets the value used for IP. If both are conﬁgured on an interface, the IP MTU 
setting takes precedence on that interface. However, if the mtu command is conﬁgured after 
ip mtu is conﬁgured, the ip mtu value is reset to the same value as that of the mtu 
command. Use care when changing these values.
The review of IP routing and addressing is now complete. Next, this chapter examines 
connected routes, including connected routes related to VLAN trunking and secondary IP 
addresses.

Routes to Directly Connected Subnets     175
Routes to Directly Connected Subnets
A router automatically adds a route to its routing table for the subnet connected to each 
interface, assuming that the following two facts are true:
■
The interface is in a working state—in other words, the interface status in the show  
interfaces command lists a line status of up and a protocol status of up.
■
The interface has an IP address assigned, either through the ip address interface 
subcommand or by using DHCP client services.
The concept of connected routes is relatively basic. The router of course needs to know the 
subnet number used on the physical network connected to each of its interfaces, but if the 
interface is not currently working, the router needs to remove the route from its routing 
table. The show ip route command lists these routes with a c as the route code, meaning 
connected, and the show ip route connected command lists only connected routes.
The following sections about connected routes focus on a couple of variations in 
conﬁguration that affect connected routes, thereby affecting how routers forward packets. 
The ﬁrst topic relates to a tool called secondary IP addressing, while the second relates to 
a router’s conﬁguration when using VLAN trunking.
Secondary IP Addressing
Imagine that you planned your IP addressing scheme for a network. Later, a particular 
subnet grows, and you have used all the valid IP addresses in the subnet. What should you 
do? Three main options exist:
■
Make the existing subnet larger
■
Migrate the hosts to use addresses in a different, larger subnet
■
Use secondary addressing
All three options are reasonable, but all have some problems.
To make the subnet larger, just change the mask used on that subnet. However, changing 
the mask could create overlapped subnets. For example, if subnet 10.1.4.0/24 is running out 
of addresses, and you make a change to mask 255.255.254.0 (9 host bits, 23 network/subnet 
bits), the new subnet includes addresses 10.1.4.0 to 10.1.5.255. If you have already 
assigned subnet 10.1.5.0/24, with assignable addresses 10.1.5.1 through 10.1.5.254, you 
would create an overlap, which is not allowed. However, if the 10.1.5.x addresses are 
unused, expanding the old subnet might be reasonable.

176     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
The second option is to simply pick a new, unused, but larger subnet. All the IP addresses 
would need to be changed. This is a relatively simple process if most or all hosts use DHCP, 
but a potentially laborious process if many hosts use statically conﬁgured IP addresses.
Note that both of the ﬁrst two solutions imply a strategy of using different masks in different 
parts of the network. Use of these different masks is called variable-length subnet masking 
(VLSM), which introduces more complexity into the network, particularly for people who 
are monitoring and troubleshooting the network.
The third major option is to use a Cisco router features called secondary IP addressing. 
Secondary addressing uses multiple networks or subnets on the same data link. By using 
more than one subnet on the same medium, you increase the number of available IP 
addresses. To make it work, the router needs an IP address in each subnet so that the hosts 
in each subnet have a usable default gateway IP address in the same subnet. Additionally, 
packets that need to pass between these subnets must be sent to the router. For example, 
Figure 4-5 has subnet 10.1.2.0/24; assume that it has all IP addresses assigned. Assuming 
secondary addressing to be the chosen solution, subnet 10.1.7.0/24 also could be used on the 
same Ethernet. Example 4-2 shows the conﬁguration for secondary IP addressing on Yosemite.

Routes to Directly Connected Subnets     177
The router has connected routes to subnets 10.1.2.0/24 and 10.1.7.0/24, so it can forward 
packets to each subnet. The hosts in each subnet on the same LAN can use either 10.1.2.252 
or 10.1.7.252 as their default gateway IP addresses, depending on the subnet in which they 
reside.
The biggest negative to secondary addressing is that packets sent between hosts on the LAN 
might be inefﬁciently routed. For example, when a host in subnet 10.1.2.0 sends a packet 
to a host in 10.1.7.0, the sending host’s logic is to send the packet to its default gateway, 
because the destination is on a different subnet. So, the sending host sends the packet to the 
router, which then sends the packet back into the same LAN.
Supporting Connected Routes to Subnet Zero
IOS can restrict a router from conﬁguring an ip address command with an address inside 
the zero subnet. The zero subnet (or subnet zero) is the one subnet in each classful network 
that has all binary 0s in the subnet part of the binary version of the subnet number. In 
decimal, the zero subnet happens to be the same number as the classful network number.
With the ip subnet-zero command conﬁgured, IOS allows the zero subnet to become a 
connected route as a result of an ip address command being conﬁgured on an interface. 
This command has been a default setting since at least IOS version 12.0, which was a 
relatively old IOS version by the time this book was published. So, for the exam, if you see

178     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
the ip subnet-zero command conﬁgured, or if the question does not specify that the no ip 
subnet-zero command is conﬁgured, assume that the zero subnet can be conﬁgured.
With the no ip subnet-zero command conﬁgured on a router, that router rejects any ip 
address command that uses an address/mask combination for the zero subnet. For example, 
the interface subcommand ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 implies zero subnet 10.0.0.0/
24, so the router would reject the command if the no ip subnet-zero global conﬁguration 
command was conﬁgured. Note that the error message simply says “bad mask,” rather than 
stating that the problem was because of the zero subnet.
The no ip subnet-zero command on one router does not affect other routers, and it does not 
prevent a router from learning about a zero subnet through a routing protocol. It simply 
prevents the router from conﬁguring an interface to be in a zero subnet.
Note that in today’s CCNA exams, you can assume that the zero subnet is allowed to be 
used unless the question states that it should not be used. In particular, a question that uses 
a classful routing protocol (as discussed in Chapter 5), or uses the no ip subnet-zero 
command, implies that the zero and broadcast subnets should be avoided.
ISL and 802.1Q Configuration on Routers
As discussed in Chapter 1, “Virtual LANs,” VLAN trunking can be used between two 
switches and between a switch and a router. By using trunking instead of using a physical 
router interface per VLAN, the number of required router interfaces can be reduced. Instead 
of a single physical interface on the router for each VLAN on the switch, one physical 
interface can be used, and the router can still route packets between the various VLANs.
Figure 4-6 shows a router with a single Fast Ethernet interface and a single connection to a 
switch. Either Inter-Switch Link (ISL) or 802.1Q trunking can be used, with only small 
differences in the conﬁguration for each. For frames that contain packets that the router 
routes between the two VLANs, the incoming frame is tagged by the switch with one 
VLAN ID, and the outgoing frame is tagged by the router with the other VLAN ID. 
Example 4-3 shows the router conﬁguration required to support ISL encapsulation and 
forwarding between these VLANs.
NOTE
Older editions of this book stated that you should assume that the zero subnet 
cannot be used, unless an exam question implied that the zero subnet was usable. The 
current CCNA exams, and therefore this book, allow the zero subnet to be used unless the 
exam question states or implies that it should not be used.

Routes to Directly Connected Subnets     179
Figure 4-6
Router Forwarding Between VLANs
Example 4-3 shows the conﬁguration for three subinterfaces of the Fast Ethernet interface 
on the router. A subinterface is a logical subdivision of a physical interface. The router 
assigns each subinterface an IP address and assigns the subinterface to a single VLAN. So, 
instead of three physical router interfaces, each attached to a different subnet/VLAN, the 
router uses one physical router interface with three logical subinterfaces, each attached to 
a different subnet/VLAN. The encapsulation command numbers the VLANs, which must 
match the conﬁguration for VLAN IDs in the switch.
This example uses subinterface numbers that match the VLAN ID on each subinterface. 
There is no requirement that the numbers match, but most people choose to make them 
match, just to make the conﬁguration more obvious and to make troubleshooting easier. In 
other words, the VLAN IDs can be 1, 2, and 3, but the subinterface numbers could have 
been 4, 5, and 6, because the subinterface numbers are just used internally by the router.

180     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
Example 4-4 shows the same network, but this time with 802.1Q used instead of ISL. IEEE 
802.1Q has a concept called the native VLAN, which is a special VLAN on each trunk for 
which no 802.1Q headers are added to the frames. By default, VLAN 1 is the native VLAN. 
Example 4-4 shows the difference in conﬁguration.
The conﬁguration creates three VLANs on the router Fa0/0 interface. Two of the VLANs, 
VLANs 2 and 3, are conﬁgured just like Example 4-3, except that the encapsulation 
command lists 802.1Q as the type of encapsulation.
The native VLAN, VLAN 1 in this case, can be conﬁgured with two styles of conﬁguration. 
Example 4-4 shows one style in which the native VLAN’s IP address is conﬁgured on the 
physical interface. As a result, the router does not use VLAN trunking headers in this 
VLAN, as is intended for the native VLAN. The alternative is to conﬁgure the native 
VLAN’s IP address on another subinterface and to use the encapsulation dot1q 1 native 
interface subcommand. This command tells the router that the subinterface is associated 
with VLAN 1, but the native keyword tells the router not to use any 802.1Q headers with 
that subinterface.
Routers do not perform dynamic negotiation of trunking. So, the switch connected to a 
router interface must manually conﬁgure trunking, as covered in Chapter 1. For example, a 
switch on the other end of the router’s Fa0/0 interface would conﬁgure the switchport 
mode trunk interface subcommand (to enable trunking manually), and if the switch is 
capable of using either type of trunking, the switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
interface subcommand to statically conﬁgure the use of 802.1Q.
Static Routes
Routers use three main methods to add routes to their routing tables: connected routes, 
static routes, and dynamic routing protocols. Routers always add connected routes when 
interfaces have IP addresses conﬁgured and the interfaces are up and working. In most

Static Routes     181
networks, engineers purposefully use dynamic routing protocols to cause each router to 
learn the rest of the routes in an internetwork. Using static routes—routes added to a routing 
table through direct conﬁguration—is the least used of the three options.
Static routing consists of individual ip route global conﬁguration commands that deﬁne a 
route to a router. The conﬁguration command includes a reference to the subnet—the 
subnet number and mask—along with instructions about where to forward packets destined 
to that subnet. To see the need for static routes, and to see the conﬁguration, look at 
Example 4-5, which shows two ping commands testing IP connectivity from Albuquerque 
to Yosemite (see Figure 4-7).

182     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
The end of the example shows two different ping commands on router Albuquerque, one 
to 10.1.128.252 (Yosemite’s S0 IP address) and one to 10.1.2.252 (Yosemite’s LAN IP 
address). The IOS ping command sends ﬁve ICMP Echo Request packets by default, with 
the command output listing an exclamation point (!) to mean that an Echo Reply was 
received, and a period (.) to mean no reply was received. In the example, the ﬁrst instance, 
ping 10.1.128.252, shows ﬁve responses (100%), and the second instance, ping 10.1.2.252, 
shows that no responses were received (0%). The ﬁrst ping command works because 
Albuquerque has a route to the subnet in which 10.1.128.2 resides (subnet 10.1.128.0/24). 
However, the ping to 10.1.2.252 does not work because Albuquerque does not have a route 
that matches address 10.1.2.252. At this point, Albuquerque only has routes for its three 
connected subnets. So, Albuquerque’s ping 10.1.2.252 command creates the packets, but 
Albuquerque discards the packets because no routes exist.
Configuring Static Routes
One simple solution to the failure of the ping 10.1.2.252 command is to enable an IP 
routing protocol on all three routers. In fact, in a real network, that is the most likely 
solution. As an alternative, you can conﬁgure static routes. Many networks have a few static 
routes, so you need to conﬁgure them occasionally. Example 4-6 shows the ip route 
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area

command on Albuquerque, which adds static routes and makes the failed ping from 
Example 4-5 work.
The ip route command deﬁnes the static route by deﬁning the subnet number and the next-
hop IP address. One ip route command deﬁnes a route to 10.1.2.0 (mask 255.255.255.0), 
which is located off Yosemite, so the next-hop IP address as conﬁgured on Albuquerque is 
10.1.128.252, which is Yosemite’s Serial0 IP address. Similarly, a route to 10.1.3.0, the 
subnet off Seville, points to Seville’s Serial0 IP address, 10.1.130.253. Note that the next-
hop IP address is an IP address in a directly connected subnet; the goal is to deﬁne the next 
router to send the packet to. Now Albuquerque can forward packets to these two subnets.
The ip route command has two basic formats. The command can refer to a next-hop IP 
address, as shown in Example 4-6. Alternately, for static routes that use point-to-point serial 
links, the command can list the outgoing interface instead of the next-hop IP address. For 
example, Example 4-6 could instead use the ip route 10.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 serial0 global 
conﬁguration command instead of the ﬁrst ip route command.
Unfortunately, adding the two static routes in Example 4-6 to Albuquerque does not solve 
all the network’s routing problems. The static routes help Albuquerque deliver packets to 
these two subnets, but the other two routers don’t have enough routing information to 
forward packets back toward Albuquerque. For example, PC Bugs cannot ping PC Sam in 
this network, even after the addition of the commands in Example 4-6. The problem is that 
although Albuquerque has a route to subnet 10.1.2.0, where Sam resides, Yosemite does not 
have a route to 10.1.1.0, where Bugs resides. The ping request packet goes from Bugs to 
Sam correctly, but Sam’s ping response packet cannot be routed by the Yosemite router 
back through Albuquerque to Bugs, so the ping fails.
The Extended ping Command
In real life, you might not be able to ﬁnd a user, like Bugs, to ask to test your network by 
pinging. Instead, you can use the extended ping command on a router to test routing in the 
same way that a ping from Bugs to Sam tests routing. Example 4-7 shows Albuquerque with 
the working ping 10.1.2.252 command, but with an extended ping 10.1.2.252 command 
Example 4-6

that works similarly to a ping from Bugs to Sam—a ping that fails in this case (only the two 
static routes from Example 4-6 have been added at this point).

Static Routes     185
The simple ping 10.1.2.252 command works for one obvious reason and one not-so-
obvious reason. First, Albuquerque can forward a packet to subnet 10.1.2.0 because of the 
static route. The return packet, sent by Yosemite, is sent to address 10.1.128.251—
Albuquerque’s Serial0 IP address—and Yosemite has a connected route to reach subnet 
10.2.128.0. But why does Yosemite send the Echo Reply to Albuquerque’s S0 IP address of 
10.1.128.251? Well, the following points are true about the ping command on a Cisco 
router:
■
The Cisco ping command uses, by default, the output interface’s IP address as the  
packet’s source address, unless otherwise speciﬁed in an extended ping. The ﬁrst ping 
in Example 4-7 uses a source of 10.1.128.251, because the route used to send the 
packet to 10.1.2.252 sends packets out Albuquerque’s Serial0 interface, whose IP 
address is 10.1.128.251.
■
Ping response packets (ICMP Echo Replies) reverse the IP addresses used in the 
received ping request to which they are responding. So, in this example, Yosemite’s 
Echo Reply, in response to the ﬁrst ping in Example 4-7, uses 10.1.128.251 as the 
destination address and 10.1.2.252 as the source IP address.
Because the ping 10.1.2.252 command on Albuquerque uses 10.1.128.251 as the packet’s 
source address, Yosemite can send back a response to 10.1.128.251, because Yosemite 
happens to have a (connected) route to 10.1.128.0.
The danger when troubleshooting with the standard ping command is that routing problems 
can still exist, but the ping 10.1.2.252 command, which worked, gives you a false sense of 
security. A more thorough alternative is to use the extended ping command to act like you 
issued a ping from a computer on that subnet, without having to call a user and ask to enter 
a ping command for you on the PC. The extended version of the ping command can be used 
to reﬁne the problem’s underlying cause by changing several details of what the ping 
command sends in its request. In fact, when a ping from a router works, but a ping from a 
host does not, the extended ping could help you re-create the problem without needing to 
work with the end user on the phone.
For example, in Example 4-7, the extended ping command on Albuquerque sends a packet 
from source IP address 10.1.1.251 (Albuquerque’s Ethernet) to 10.1.2.252 (Yosemite’s 
Ethernet). According to the output, Albuquerque did not receive a response. Normally, the 
ping command would be sourced from the IP address of the outgoing interface. With the 
use of the extended ping source address option, the source IP address of the echo packet is 
set to Albuquerque’s Ethernet IP address, 10.1.1.251. Because the ICMP echo generated by 
the extended ping is sourced from an address in subnet 10.1.1.0, the packet looks more like 
a packet from an end user in that subnet. Yosemite builds an Echo Reply, with destination 

186     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
10.1.1.251, but it does not have a route to that subnet. So Yosemite cannot send the ping 
reply packet back to Albuquerque.
To solve this problem, all routers could be conﬁgured to use a routing protocol. 
Alternatively, you could simply deﬁne static routes on all the routers in the network.
Static Default Routes
A default route is a special route that matches all packet destinations. Default routes can be 
particularly useful when only one physical path exists from one part of the network to 
another, and in cases for which one enterprise router provides connectivity to the Internet 
for that enterprise. For example, in Figure 4-8, R1, R2, and R3 are connected to the rest of 
the network only through R1’s LAN interface. All three routers can forward packets to the 
rest of the network as long as the packets get to R1, which in turn forwards packets to router 
Dist1.
Figure 4-8
Sample Network Using a Default Route
The following sections show two options for conﬁguring static default routes: one using the 
ip route command and another using the ip default-network command.
Default Routes Using the ip route Command
By conﬁguring a default route on R1, with next-hop router Dist1, and by having R1 
advertise the default to R2 and R3, default routing can be accomplished. By using such a 
default route, R1, R2, and R3 should not need speciﬁc routes to the subnets to the right of

router Dist1. Example 4-8 begins an examination of this design by showing the deﬁnition 
of a static default route on R1 and the resulting information in R1’s IP routing table.
R1 deﬁnes the default route with a static ip route command, with destination 0.0.0.0, mask 
0.0.0.0. As a result, R1’s show ip route command lists a static route to 0.0.0.0, mask 
0.0.0.0, with next hop 168.13.1.101—essentially, the same information in the ip route 
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 168.13.1.101 global conﬁguration command. A destination of 0.0.0.0, with 
mask 0.0.0.0, represents all destinations by convention. With just that conﬁguration, R1 has 
a static route that matches any and all IP packet destinations.
Note also in Example 4-8 that R1’s show ip route command output lists a “Gateway of last 
resort” as 168.13.1.101. When a router knows about at least one default route, the router 
notes that route with an asterisk in the routing table. If a router learns about multiple default 
routes—either through static conﬁguration or from routing protocols—the router notes 
each default route with an asterisk in the routing table. Then, the router chooses the best 
default route, noting that choice as the gateway of last resort. (The administrative distance 
of the source of the routing information, as deﬁned by the administrative distance setting, 
has some impact on this choice. Administrative distance is covered in Chapter 8, “Routing 
Protocol Theory,” in the section “Administrative Distance.”)

188     Chapter 4: IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes
While the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) conﬁguration is not shown, R1 also 
advertises this default route to R2 and R3, as shown in the output of the show ip route 
command on R3 in Example 4-9.
Different routing protocols advertise default routes in a couple of different ways. As an 
example, when R3 learns a default route from R1 using RIP, R3 lists the destination of the 
default route (0.0.0.0) and the next-hop router, which is R1 in this case (168.13.100.1), as 
highlighted in Example 4-9. So, when R3 needs to use its default route, it forwards packets 
to R1 (168.13.100.1)
Default Routes Using the ip default-network Command
Another style of conﬁguration for the default route uses the ip default-network command. 
This command lists a classful IP network as its parameter, telling the router to use the 
routing details of the route for that classful network as the forwarding details for a default 
route.
This command is most useful when the engineer wants to use the default route to reach 
networks besides the networks used inside that enterprise. For example, in Figure 4-8, 
imagine that all subnets of the enterprise’s 168.13.0.0 Class B network are known; they 
exist only near routers R1, R2, and R3; and these routes are all in the routing tables of R1, 
R2, and R3. Also, none of the subnets of 168.1.0.0 are to the right of Router Dist1. If the 
engineer wants to use a default route for forwarding packets to destinations to the right of 
Dist1, the ip default-network command works well.

Static Routes     189
To use the ip default-network command to conﬁgure a default route, the engineer relies 
on her knowledge that Dist1 is already advertising a route for classful network 10.0.0.0 to 
R1. R1’s route to network 10.0.0.0 points to Dist1’s 168.13.1.101 address as the next-hop 
address. Knowing that, the engineer can conﬁgure the ip default-network 10.0.0.0 
command on R1, which tells R1 to build its default route based on its learned route for 
network 10.0.0.0/8. Example 4-10 shows several details about this scenario on R1.
R1 shows both the result of having normally learned a route to network 10.0.0.0 through 
RIP, plus the additional results of the ip default-network 10.0.0.0 global command. R1’s 
RIP route for 10.0.0.0/8 lists a next-hop IP address of 168.13.1.101, Dist1’s IP address on 
their common LAN, as normal. Because of the ip default-network 10.0.0.0 command, R1 
decides to use the details in the route to network 10.0.0.0 as its default route. The last part 
of the line about the gateway of last resort lists the default network, 10.0.0.0. Also, R1 lists 
an asterisk beside the route referenced in the ip default-network command.

Default Route Summary
Remembering the details of conﬁguring default routes, and in particular the resulting 
details in the output of the show ip route command, can be a challenge. However, make it 
a point to remember these key points regarding default routes:
■
Default static routes can be statically conﬁgured using the ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-
hop-address or the ip default-network net-number command.
■
When a router only matches a packet with the default route, that router uses the 
forwarding details listed in the gateway of last resort line.
Regardless of how the default route shows up—whether it’s a gateway of last resort, a route 
to 0.0.0.0, or a route to some other network with an * beside it in the routing table—it is 
used according to the rules of classless or classful routing, as is explained in the next 
section.
Classful and Classless Routing
Cisco routers have two conﬁgurable options for how a router uses an existing default route: 
classless routing and classful routing. Classless routing causes a router to use its default 
routes for any packet that does not match some other route. Classful routing places one 
restriction on when a router can use its default route, resulting in cases in which a router 
has a default route but the router chooses to discard a packet rather than forwarding the 
packet based on the default route.
The terms classless and classful also characterize both IP addressing and IP routing 
protocols, so a fair amount of confusion exists as to the meaning of the terms. Before 
explaining the details of classful routing and classless routing, the next section summarizes 
the other use of these terms.
Summary of the Use of the Terms Classless and Classful
The terms classless addressing and classful addressing refer to two different ways to think 
about IP addresses. Both terms refer to a perspective on the structure of a subnetted IP 
address. Classless addressing uses a two-part view of IP addresses, and classful addressing 
has a three-part view. With classful addressing, the address always has an 8-, 16-, or 24-bit 
network ﬁeld, based on the Class A, B, and C addressing rules. The end of the address has 
a host part that uniquely identiﬁes each host inside a subnet. The bits in between the 
network and host part comprise the third part, namely the subnet part of the address. With 
classless addressing, the network and subnet parts from the classful view are combined into 
a single part, often called the subnet or preﬁx, with the address ending in the host part.
The terms classless routing protocol and classful routing protocol refer to features of 
different IP routing protocols. These features cannot be enabled or disabled; a routing 

Static Routes     191
protocol is, by its very nature, either classless or classful. In particular, classless routing 
protocols advertise mask information for each subnet, giving classless protocols the ability 
to support both VLSM and route summarization. Classful routing protocols do not advertise 
mask information, so they do not support VLSM or route summarization.
The third use of the terms classless and classful—the terms classful routing and classless 
routing—have to do with how the IP routing process makes use of the default route. 
Interestingly, this is the only one of the three uses of the terms that can be changed based 
on router conﬁguration. Table 4-2 lists the three uses of the classless and classful terms, 
with a brief explanation. A more complete explanation of classless and classful routing 
follows the table. Chapter 5 explains more background information about the terms 
classless routing protocol and classful routing protocol.
Classless and Classful Routing Compared
Classless IP routing works just like most people think IP routing would work when a router 
knows a default route. Compared to classful routing, classless routing’s core concepts are 
straightforward. Classful routing restricts the use of the default route. The following two 
statements give a general description of each, with an example following the deﬁnitions:
■
Classless routing: When a packet’s destination only matches a router’s default route,  
and does not match any other routes, forward the packet using that default route.
■
Classful routing: When a packet’s destination only matches a router’s default route, 
and does not match any other routes, only use the default route if this router does not 
know any routes in the classful network in which the destination IP address resides.
The use of the term classful refers to the fact that the logic includes some consideration of 
classful IP addressing rules—namely, the classful (Class A, B, or C) network of the packet’s 
destination address. To make sense of this concept, Example 4-11 shows a router with a 
default route, but classful routing allows the use of the default route in one case, but not

Addresses
Addresses have three parts: 
network, subnet, and host.
Addresses have two parts: subnet or 
preﬁx, and host.

Routing protocol does advertise masks 
and support VLSM; RIP-2, EIGRP,

Routing (forwarding)

another. The example uses the same default routes examples from earlier in this chapter, 
based on Figure 4-8. Both R3 and R1 have a default route that could forward packets to 
Router Dist1. However, as seen in Example 4-11, on R3, the ping 10.1.1.1 works, but the 
ping 168.13.200.1 fails.
First, consider R3’s attempt to match both destinations (10.1.1.1 and 168.13.200.1) against 
the routes in the routing table. R3’s routing table does not have any routes that match either 
destination IP address, other than the default route. So, R3’s only option is to use its default 
route.
NOTE
This example uses the default route on R1 as deﬁned with the ip route 
command and as explained in Examples 4-8 and 4-9, but it would have worked the same 
regardless of how the default route was learned.

R3 is conﬁgured to use classful routing. With classful routing, the router ﬁrst matches the 
Class A, B, or C network number in which a destination resides. If the Class A, B, or C 
network is found, Cisco IOS Software then looks for the speciﬁc subnet number. If it isn’t 
found, the packet is discarded, as is the case with the ICMP echoes sent with the ping 
168.13.200.1 command. However, with classful routing, if the packet does not match a 
Class A, B, or C network in the routing table, and a default route exists, the default route is 
indeed used—which is why R3 can forward the ICMP echoes sent by the successful ping 
10.1.1.1 command.
In short, with classful routing, the only time the default route is used is when the router does 
not know about any subnets of the packet’s destination Class A, B, or C network.
You can toggle between classless and classful routing with the ip classless and no ip 
classless global conﬁguration commands, respectively. With classless routing, Cisco IOS 
Software looks for the best match, ignoring class rules. If a default route exists, with 
classless routing, the packet always at least matches the default route. If a more speciﬁc 
route matches the packet’s destination, that route is used. Example 4-12 shows R3 changed 
to use classless routing, and the successful ping of 168.13.200.1.

VLSM and Route Summarization
While Chapter 4, “IP Routing: Static and Connected Routes,” focuses on topics related to 
IP routing, this chapter focuses on topics related to IP addressing: variable-length subnet 
masking (VLSM), manual route summarization, and automatic route summarization. These 
features relate to IP addressing in that they all require some thought about the range of IP 
addresses implied by a given address and mask, or by a subnet that is part of a summarized 
route. So, this chapter requires a full understanding of IP addressing for a full understanding 
of the examples in this chapter.
This chapter mainly focuses on concepts and show commands, with only a few 
conﬁguration commands of interest.

202     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
Foundation Topics
This chapter discusses three related topics: VLSM, manual route summarization, and 
automatic route summarization. These topics mainly relate to each other because of the 
underlying math, which requires that the engineer be able to look at a subnet number and 
mask to quickly determine the implied range of addresses. This chapter begins with VLSM, 
moving on to manual route summarization, and ﬁnally autosummarization.
VLSM
VLSM occurs when an internetwork uses more than one mask in different subnets of a 
single Class A, B, or C network. VLSM allows engineers to reduce the number of wasted 
IP addresses in each subnet, allowing more subnets and avoiding having to obtain another 
registered IP network number from regional IP address assignment authorities. Also, even 
when using private IP networks (as deﬁned in RFC 1918), large corporations might still 
need to conserve the address space, again creating a need to use VLSM.
Figure 5-1 shows an example of VLSM used in class A network 10.0.0.0.
Figure 5-1
VLSM in Network 10.0.0.0: Masks 255.255.255.0 and 255.255.255.252
Figure 5-1 shows a typical choice of using a /30 preﬁx (mask 255.255.255.252) on point-
to-point serial links, with some other mask (255.255.255.0, in this example) on the LAN 
subnets. All subnets are of class A network 10.0.0.0, with two masks being used, therefore 
meeting the deﬁnition of VLSM.
Oddly enough, a common mistake occurs when people think that VLSM means “using 
more than one mask,” rather than “using more than one mask in a single classful network.” 
For example, if in one internetwork diagram, all subnets of network 10.0.0.0 use a 
255.255.240.0 mask and all subnets of network 11.0.0.0 use a 255.255.255.0 mask, two 
different masks are used. However, only one mask is inside each respective classful 
network, so this particular design would not be using VLSM.

masks inside network 10.0.0.0, as noted in the highlighted line in the example.
Classless and Classful Routing Protocols
For a routing protocol to support VLSM, the routing protocol must advertise not only the 
subnet number but also the subnet mask when advertising routes. Additionally, a routing 
protocol must include subnet masks in its routing updates to support manual route 
summarization.
Each IP routing protocol is considered to be either classless or classful, based on whether 
the routing protocol does (classless) or does not (classful) send the mask in routing updates. 
Each routing protocol is either classless or classful by its very nature; no commands exist 
to enable or disable whether a particular routing protocol is a classless or classful routing 
protocol. Table 5-2 lists the routing protocols, shows whether each is classless or classful, 
and offers reminders of the two features (VLSM and route summarization) enabled by the 
inclusion of masks in the routing updates.

Overlapping VLSM Subnets
The subnets chosen to be used in any IP internetwork design must not overlap their address 
ranges. With a single subnet mask in a network, the overlaps are somewhat obvious; 
however, with VLSM, the overlapping subnets might not be as obvious. When multiple 
subnets overlap, a router’s routing table entries overlap. As a result, routing becomes 
unpredictable, and some hosts can be reached from only particular parts of the 
internetwork. In short, a design that uses overlapping subnets is considered to be an 
incorrect design, and should not be used.
Two general types of problems exist that relate to overlapping VLSM subnets, both in real 
jobs and for the exams: analyzing an existing design to ﬁnd overlaps and choosing new 
VLSM subnets so that you do not create an overlapped subnet. To appreciate what the exam 
might cover for VLSM and overlapping subnets, consider Figure 5-2, which shows a single 
Class B network (172.16.0.0), using a VLSM design that includes three different masks, /
23, /24, and /30.

VLSM Design with Possible Overlap
Now imagine that an exam question shows you the ﬁgure, and either directly or indirectly 
asks whether overlapping subnets exist. This type of question might simply tell you that 
some hosts cannot ping each other, or it might not even mention that the root cause could 
be that some of the subnets overlap. To answer such a question, you could follow this 
simple but possibly laborious task:
Step 1 Calculate the subnet number and subnet broadcast address of each subnet; this  
gives you the range of addresses in that subnet.
Step 2 Compare the ranges of addresses in each subnet and look for cases in 
which the address ranges overlap.
For example, in Figure 5-2, you would look at the ﬁve subnets, and using Step 1, calculate 
the subnet numbers, broadcast addresses, and range of addresses, with the answers listed in 
Table 5-3.
Step 2 states the somewhat obvious step of comparing the address ranges to see whether 
any overlaps occur. Note that none of the subnet numbers are identical; however, a closer 
look at the R2 LAN and R3 LAN subnets shows that these two subnets overlap. In this case,

the design is invalid because of the overlap, and one of the two subnets would need to be 
changed.
Designing a Subnetting Scheme Using VLSM
CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide explains how to design the IP 
addressing scheme for a new internetwork by choosing IP subnets when using a single 
subnet mask throughout a classful network. To do so, the process ﬁrst analyzes the design 
requirements to determine the number of subnets and the number of hosts in the largest 
subnet. Then, a subnet mask is chosen. Finally, all possible subnets of the network, using 
that mask, are identiﬁed, and then the actual subnets used in the design are picked from that 
list. For example, in Class B network 172.16.0.0, a design might call for ten subnets, with 
a largest subnet of 200 hosts. Mask 255.255.255.0 meets the requirements, with 8 subnet 
bits and 8 host bits, supporting 256 subnets and 254 hosts per subnet. The subnet numbers 
would be 172.16.0.0, 172.16.1.0, 172.16.2.0, and so on.
When using VLSM in a design, the design process starts by deciding how many subnets of 
each size are required. For example, most installations use subnets with a /30 preﬁx for 
serial links because these subnets support exactly two IP addresses, which are all the 
addresses needed on a point-to-point link. The LAN-based subnets often have different 
requirements, with shorter preﬁx lengths (meaning more host bits) for larger numbers of 
hosts/subnet, and longer preﬁx lengths (meaning fewer host bits) for smaller numbers of 
hosts/subnet.
After the number of subnets with each mask has been determined, the next step is to ﬁnd 
subnet numbers that match those requirements. This task is not particularly difﬁcult if you 
already understand how to ﬁnd subnet numbers when using static-length masks. However, 
a more formal process can help, which is outlined as follows:
Step 1 Determine the number of subnets needed for each mask/preﬁx based on the design 
requirements.
Step 2 Using the shortest preﬁx length (largest number of host bits), identify the 
subnets of the classful network when using that mask, until the required 
number of such subnets has been identiﬁed.
NOTE
To review subnetting design when using static-length subnet masks (SLSM), 
refer to CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Chapter 12, or the CD-
only version of that chapter in this book’s CD (Appendix H). (The CD-only Appendix D, 
“Subnetting Practice,” of this book also includes some related practice problems.)

VLSM     207
Step 3 Identify the next numeric subnet number using the same mask as in the 
previous step.
Step 4 Starting with the subnet number identiﬁed at the previous step, identify 
smaller subnets based on the next-longest preﬁx length required for the 
design, until the required number of subnets of that size have been 
identiﬁed.
Step 5 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until all subnets of all sizes have been found.
Frankly, using the above process, as written, can be a little difﬁcult, but an example can 
certainly help make sense of the process. So, imagine a network design for which the 
following design requirements were determined, per Step 1 of the previous process. The 
design calls for the use of Class B network 172.16.0.0:
■
Three subnets with mask /24 (255.255.255.0)
■
Three subnets with mask /26 (255.255.255.192)
■
Four subnets with mask /30 (255.255.255.252)
Step 2 in this case means that the ﬁrst three subnets of network 172.16.0.0 should be 
identiﬁed, with mask /24, because /24 is the shortest preﬁx length of the three preﬁx lengths 
listed in the design requirements. Using the same math covered in detail in the ICND1 
book, the ﬁrst three subnets would be 172.16.0.0/24, 172.16.1.0/24, and 172.16.2.0/24:
■
172.16.0.0/24: Range 172.16.0.1–172.16.0.254
■
172.16.1.0/24: Range 172.16.1.1–172.16.1.254
■
172.16.2.0/24: Range 172.16.2.1–172.16.2.254
Step 3 in this case says to identify one more subnet using the /24 mask, so the next numeric 
subnet would be 172.16.3.0/24.
Before moving on to Step 4, take a few minutes to review Figure 5-3. The ﬁgure shows the 
results of Step 2 on the top part of the ﬁgure, listing the three subnets identiﬁed at this step 
as “allocated” because they will be used for subnets in this design. It also lists the next 
subnet, as found at Step 3, listing it as unallocated, because it has not yet been chosen to be 
used for a particular part of the design.

208     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
Figure 5-3
Designing to Use VLSM Subnets
To ﬁnd the subnets at Step 4, start with the unallocated subnet number found at Step 3 
(172.16.3.0), but with Step 4 applying the next longer preﬁx length, or /26 in this example. 
The process always results in the ﬁrst subnet number being the subnet number found at the 
previous step, or 172.16.3.0 in this case. The three subnets are as follows: 
■
172.16.3.0/26: Range 172.16.3.1–172.16.3.62
■
172.16.3.64/26: Range 172.16.3.65–172.16.3.126
■
172.16.3.128/26: Range 172.16.3.129–172.16.3.190
Finally, Step 5 says to repeat Steps 3 and 4 until all subnets have been found. In this case, 
repeating Step 3, the next subnet is found, using the /26 preﬁx length—namely subnet 
172.16.3.192/26. This subnet is considered unallocated for the time being. To repeat Step 4 
for the next longest preﬁx length, Step 4 uses the /30 preﬁx, starting with subnet number 
172.16.3.192. The ﬁrst subnet will be 172.16.3.192, with mask /30, plus the next three 
subnets with that same mask, as follows:
■
172.16.3.192/30: Range 172.16.3.193–172.16.3.194
■
172.16.3.196/30: Range 172.16.3.197–172.16.3.198
■
172.16.3.200/30: Range 172.16.3.201–172.16.3.202

The wording in the formalized process might seem to be a bit laborious, but it does result 
in a set of VLSM subnets that do not overlap. By using a structured approach of essentially 
allocating the larger subnets ﬁrst, then the smaller subnets, you can generally choose 
subnets so that the address ranges do not overlap.
Adding a New Subnet to an Existing Design
Another task required when working with VLSM-based internetworks is to choose a new 
subnet number for an existing internetwork. In particular, extra care must be taken when 
choosing new subnet numbers to avoid causing an overlap between the new subnet and any 
existing subnets. For example, consider the internetwork in Figure 5-2, with classful 
network 172.16.0.0. An exam question might suggest that a new subnet, with a /23 preﬁx 
length, needs to be added to the design. The question might also say “Pick the smallest 
subnet number that can be used for the new subnet.” So, the subnets must be identiﬁed, and 
a nonoverlapping subnet must be chosen.
To attack such a problem, you would essentially need to ﬁnd all the subnet numbers that 
could be created in that classful network, using the stated or implied mask. Then, you would 
have to ensure that the new subnet did not overlap with any existing subnets. Speciﬁcally, 
you could use the following steps:
Step 1 If not already listed as part of the question, pick the subnet mask (preﬁx length) 
based on the design requirements, typically based on the number of hosts needed 
in the subnet.
Step 2 Calculate all possible subnet numbers of the classful network, using the 
mask determined at Step 1. (If the exam question asks for the numerically 
largest or smallest subnet number, you might choose to only do this math 
for the ﬁrst few or last few subnets.)
Step 3 For the subnets found at Step 2, calculate the subnet broadcast address 
and range of addresses for each assumed subnet.
Step 4 Compare the lists of potential subnets and address ranges to the existing 
subnets and address ranges. Rule out any of the potential subnets that 
overlap with an existing subnet.
Step 5 Pick a subnet number from the list found at Step 2 that does not overlap 
with any existing subnets, noting whether the question asks for the 
smallest or largest subnet number.
Using this ﬁve-step process with the example started just before the step list with Figure 5-2, 
the question supplied the preﬁx length of /23 (Step 1). Table 5-4 lists the results for Steps 

210     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
2 and 3, listing the subnet numbers, broadcast addresses, and range of addresses for the ﬁrst 
ﬁve of the possible /23 subnets.
Step 4 compares the information in the table with the existing subnets. In this case, the 
second, third, and fourth subnets in Table 5-4 overlap with existing subnets in Figure 5-2.
Step 5 has more to do with the exam than with real networks. Multiple-choice questions 
sometimes need to force the question to have only a single answer, so asking for the 
numerically smallest or largest subnet solves the problem. This particular example problem 
asks for the smallest subnet number, and the zero subnet is still available (172.16.0.0/23, 
with broadcast address 172.16.1.255). If the question allowed the use of the zero subnet, 
the zero subnet (172.16.0.0/23) would be the correct answer. However, if the zero subnet 
was prohibited from use, the ﬁrst four subnets listed in Table 5-4 would not be available, 
making the ﬁfth subnet (172.16.8.0/23) the correct answer. Note that Scenario 5 in the CD-
only Appendix F, “Additional Scenarios,” gives you an opportunity to practice using this 
particular process.
VLSM Configuration
Routers do not enable or disable VLSM as a conﬁguration feature. From a conﬁguration 
perspective, VLSM is simply a side effect of the ip address interface subcommand. Routers 
conﬁgure VLSM by virtue of having at least two router interfaces, on the same router or 
among all routers in the internetwork, with IP addresses in the same classful network but 
with different masks. Example 5-2 shows a simple example on Router R3 from Figure 5-2, 
with interface Fa0/0 being assigned IP address 172.16.5.1/24, and interface S0/0/1 being

use of classful routing protocols or (b) the routers are conﬁgured with the no ip subnet-
zero global conﬁguration command. Otherwise, assume that the zero subnet can be used.

Manual Route Summarization     211
assigned IP address 172.16.9.6/30, thereby using at least two different masks in network 
172.16.0.0.
Classless routing protocols, which support VLSM, do not have to be conﬁgured to enable 
VLSM. Support for VLSM is simply a feature inherent to those routing protocols.
Next, the text moves on to the second major section of this chapter, the topic of manual 
route summarization.
Manual Route Summarization
Small networks might have only a few dozen routes in their routers’ routing tables. The 
larger the network, the larger the number of routes. In fact, Internet routers have more than 
100,000 routes in some cases.
The routing table might become too large in large IP networks. As routing tables grow, they 
consume more memory in a router. Also, each router can take more time to route a packet, 
because the router has to match a route in the routing table, and searching a larger table 
generally takes more time. And with a large routing table, it takes more time to troubleshoot 
problems, because the engineers working on the network need to sift through more 
information.
Route summarization reduces the size of routing tables while maintaining routes to all the 
destinations in the network. As a result, routing performance can be improved and memory 
can be saved inside each router. Summarization also improves convergence time, because 
the router that summarizes the route no longer has to announce any changes to the status of 
the individual subnets. By advertising only that the entire summary route is either up or 
down, the routers that have the summary route do not have to reconverge every time one of 
the component subnets goes up or down.
This chapter refers to route summarization as manual route summarization, in contrast to 
the last major topic in this chapter, autosummarization. The term manual refers to the fact 
that manual route summarization only occurs when an engineer conﬁgures one or more 
commands. Autosummarization occurs automatically without a speciﬁc conﬁguration 
command.

212     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
The following sections ﬁrst examine the concepts behind route summarization, followed by 
some suggestions of how to determine good summary routes. Note that while the concepts 
are covered, the conﬁguration of manually summarized routes is not covered as an end to 
itself in this book.
Route Summarization Concepts
Engineers use route summarization to reduce the size of the routing tables in the network. 
Route summarization causes some number of more-speciﬁc routes to be replaced with a 
single route that includes all the IP addresses covered by the subnets in the original routes.
Summary routes, which replace multiple routes, must be conﬁgured by a network engineer. 
Although the conﬁguration command does not look exactly like a static route command, 
the same basic information is conﬁgured. Now the routing protocol advertises just the 
summary route, as opposed to the original routes.
Route summarization works much better when the network was designed with route 
summarization in mind. For example, Figure 5-1, earlier in this chapter, shows the results 
of good planning for summarization. In this network, the engineer planned his choices of 
subnet numbers relative to his goal of using route summarization. All subnets off the main 
site (Albuquerque), including WAN links, start with 10.1. All LAN subnets off Yosemite 
start with 10.2, and likewise, all LAN subnets off Seville start with 10.3.
Earlier, Example 5-1 showed a copy of Albuquerque’s routing table without 
summarization. That example shows Albuquerque’s four routes to subnets that begin with 
10.2, all pointing out its serial 0/0 interface to Yosemite. Similarly, Albuquerque shows four 
routes to subnets that begin with 10.3, all pointing out its serial 0/1 interface to Seville. This 
design allows the Yosemite and Seville routers to advertise a single summary route instead 
of the four routes they currently advertise to Albuquerque, respectively.
Example 5-3 shows the results of the conﬁguration of manual route summarization on both 
Yosemite and Seville. In this case, Yosemite is advertising a summary route for 10.2.0.0/16, 
which represents address range 10.2.0.0–10.2.255.255 (all addresses that begin with 10.2). 
Seville advertises a summary route for 10.3.0.0/16, which represents the address range 
10.3.0.0–10.3.255.255 (all addresses that begin 10.3).

Manual Route Summarization     213
The resulting routing table on Albuquerque still routes packets correctly, but with more 
efﬁciency and less memory. Frankly, improving from 11 routes to 5 routes does not help 
much, but the same concept, applied to larger networks, does help.
The effects of route summarization can also be seen on the other two routers in the ﬁgure. 
Example 5-4 shows Yosemite, including both the route summarization conﬁguration and 
Yosemite’s routing table. Example 5-5 shows the same kind of information on Seville.

214     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
Route summarization conﬁguration differs with different routing protocols; Enhanced 
IGRP (EIGRP) is used in this example. The summary routes for EIGRP are created by the 
ip summary-address interface subcommands on Yosemite and Seville in this case. Each 
command deﬁnes a new summarized route and tells EIGRP to only advertise the summary 
out this interface and not to advertise any routes contained in the larger summary. For 
example, Yosemite deﬁnes a summary route to 10.2.0.0, mask 255.255.0.0, which deﬁnes 
a route to all hosts whose IP addresses begin with 10.2. In effect, this command causes 
Yosemite and Seville to advertise routes 10.2.0.0 255.255.0.0 and 10.3.0.0 255.255.0.0, 
respectively, and not to advertise their original four LAN subnets.

Example 5-4
Yosemite Conﬁguration and Routing Table After Route Summarization (Continued)

Manual Route Summarization     215
Note that back in Example 5-3, Albuquerque’s routing table now contains a route to 
10.2.0.0 255.255.0.0 (the mask is listed in preﬁx notation as /16), but none of the original 
four subnets that begin with 10.2. The same thing occurs for route 10.3.0.0/16.
The routing tables on Yosemite and Seville look a little different from Albuquerque. 
Focusing on Yosemite (Example 5-4), notice that the four routes to subnets that begin with 
10.2 show up because they are directly connected subnets. Yosemite does not see the four 
10.3 routes. Instead, it sees a summary route, because Albuquerque now advertises the 
10.3.0.0/16 summarized route only. The opposite is true on Seville (Example 5-5), which 
lists all four connected routes that begin with 10.3 and a summary route for 10.2.0.0/16.
The most interesting part of Yosemite’s routing tables is the route to 10.2.0.0/16, with the 
outgoing interface set to null0. Routes referring to an outgoing interface of the null0 
interface mean that packets matching this route are discarded. EIGRP added this route, with 
interface null0, as a result of the ip summary-address command. The logic works like this:
Yosemite needs this odd-looking route because now it might receive packets destined for 
other 10.2 addresses besides the four existing 10.2 subnets. If a packet destined for one of 
the four existing 10.2.x subnets arrives, Yosemite has a correct, more speciﬁc route to match 
the packet. If a packet whose destination starts with 10.2 arrives, but it is not in one of those 
four subnets, the null route matches the packet, causing Yosemite to discard the packet—as 
it should.
The routing table on Seville is similar to Yosemite’s in terms of the table entries and why 
they are in the table.
Route Summarization Strategies
As mentioned earlier, manual route summarization works best when the network engineer 
plans his choice of subnet numbers anticipating route summarization. For example, the 
earlier examples assumed a well-thought-out plan, with the engineers only using subnets 
beginning with 10.2 for subnets off the Yosemite router. That convention allowed the 
creation of a summary route for all addresses beginning with 10.2 by having Yosemite 
advertise a route describing subnet 10.2.0.0, mask 255.255.0.0.
Some summarized routes combine many routes into one route, but that might not be the 
“best” summarization. The word best, when applied to choosing what summary route to 
conﬁgure, means that the summary should include all the subnets speciﬁed in the question 
but as few other addresses as is possible. For example, in the earlier summarization 
example, Yosemite summarized four subnets (10.2.1.0, 10.2.2.0, 10.2.3.0, and 10.2.4.0, all 
with mask 255.255.255.0) into the 10.2.0.0/16 summary route. However, this summary 
includes a lot of IP addresses that are not in those four subnets. Does the summary work 

216     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
given that network’s design goals? Sure. However, instead of just deﬁning a summary that 
encompasses lots of additional addresses that do not yet exist in a network, the engineer 
might instead want to conﬁgure the tightest, or most concise, or best summary: the 
summary that includes all the subnets but as few extra subnets (the ones that have not been 
assigned yet) as possible. This section describes a strategy for ﬁnding those concise best 
summary routes.
The following list describes a generalized binary process by which you can ﬁnd a best 
summary route for a group of subnets:
Step 1 List all to-be-summarized subnet numbers in binary. 
Step 2 Find the ﬁrst N bits of the subnet numbers for which every subnet has the 
same value, moving from left to right. (For our purposes, consider this 
ﬁrst part the “in-common” part.)
Step 3 To ﬁnd the summary router’s subnet number, write down the in-common 
bits from Step 2 and binary 0s for the remaining bits. Convert back to 
decimal, 8 bits at a time, when ﬁnished.
Step 4 To ﬁnd the summary route’s subnet mask, write down N binary 1s, with 
N being the number of in-common bits found at Step 2. Complete the 
subnet mask with all binary 0s. Convert back to decimal, 8 bits at a time, 
when ﬁnished.
Step 5 Check your work by calculating the range of valid IP addresses implied 
by the new summary route, comparing the range to the summarized 
subnets. The new summary should encompass all IP addresses in the 
summarized subnets.
By looking at the subnet numbers in binary, you can more easily discover the bits in 
common among all the subnet numbers. By using the longest number of bits in common, 
you can ﬁnd the best summary. The next two sections show two examples using this process 
to ﬁnd the best, most concise, tightest summary routes for the network shown in Figure 5-1.
Sample “Best” Summary on Seville
Seville has subnets 10.3.4.0, 10.3.5.0, 10.3.6.0, and 10.3.7.0, all with mask 255.255.255.0. 
You start the process by writing down all the subnet numbers in binary:
0000  1010  0000  0011  0000  01  00  0000  0000  -  10.3.4.0
0000  1010  0000  0011  0000  01  01  0000  0000  -  10.3.5.0
0000  1010  0000  0011  0000  01  10  0000  0000  -  10.3.6.0
0000  1010  0000  0011  0000  01  11  0000  0000  -  10.3.7.0

Manual Route Summarization     217
Step 2 requires that you ﬁnd all in-common bits at the beginning of all the subnets. Even 
before looking at the numbers in binary, you can guess that the ﬁrst two octets are identical 
in all four subnets. So, a quick look at the ﬁrst 16 bits of all four subnet numbers conﬁrms 
that all have the same value. This means that the in-common part (Step 2) is at least 16 bits 
long. Further examination shows that the ﬁrst 6 bits of the third octet are also identical, but 
the seventh bit in the third octet has some different values among the different subnets. So 
the in-common part of these four subnets is the ﬁrst 22 bits.
Step 3 says to create a subnet number for the summary by taking the same bits in the in-
common part, and write down binary 0s for the rest. In this case:
Step 4 creates the mask by using binary 1s for the same bits as the in-common part, which 
is the ﬁrst 22 bits in this case, and then binary 0s for the remaining bits, as follows:
So, the summary route uses subnet 10.3.4.0, mask 255.255.252.0.
Step 5 suggests a method to check your work. The summary route should include all the IP 
addresses in the summarized routes. In this case, the range of addresses for the summary 
route starts with 10.3.4.0. The ﬁrst valid IP address is 10.3.4.1, the ﬁnal valid IP address is 
10.3.7.254, and the broadcast address is 10.3.7.255. In this case, the summary route 
includes all the IP addresses in the four routes it summarizes and no extraneous IP 
addresses.
Sample “Best” Summary on Yosemite
The four subnets on Yosemite cannot be summarized quite as efﬁciently as those on Seville. 
On Seville, the summary route itself covers the same set of IP addresses as the four subnets 
with no extra addresses. As you will see, the best summary route at Yosemite includes twice 
as many addresses in the summary as exist in the original four subnets.
Yosemite has subnets 10.2.1.0, 10.2.2.0, 10.2.3.0, and 10.2.4.0, all with mask 
255.255.255.0. The process starts at Step 1 by writing down all the subnet numbers in 
binary:
0000  1010  0000  0011  0000  01  00  0000  0000  -  10.3.4.0
1111  1111  1111  1111  1111  11  00  0000  0000  -  255.255.252.0
0000  1010  0000  0010  0000  0  001  0000  0000  -  10.2.1.0
0000  1010  0000  0010  0000  0  010  0000  0000  -  10.2.2.0
0000  1010  0000  0010  0000  0  011  0000  0000  -  10.2.3.0
0000  1010  0000  0010  0000  0  100  0000  0000  -  10.2.4.0

218     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
At Step 2, it appears that the ﬁrst two octets are identical in all four subnets, plus the ﬁrst 5 
bits of the third octet. So, the ﬁrst 21 bits of the four subnet numbers are in common.
Step 3 says to create a subnet number for the summary route by taking the same value for 
the in-common part and binary 0s for the rest. In this case:
Step 4 creates the mask used for the summary route by using binary 1s for the in-common 
part and binary 0s for the rest. The in-common part in this example is the ﬁrst 21 bits:
So, the best summary is 10.2.0.0, mask 255.255.248.0.
Step 5 suggests a method to check your work. The summary route should deﬁne a superset 
of the IP addresses in the summarized routes. In this case, the range of addresses starts with 
10.2.0.0. The ﬁrst valid IP address is 10.2.0.1, the ﬁnal valid IP address is 10.2.7.254, and 
the broadcast address is 10.2.7.255. In this case, the summary route summarizes a larger set 
of addresses than just the four subnets, but it does include all addresses in all four subnets.
Autosummarization and Discontiguous Classful 
Networks
As covered in the previous sections, manual route summarization can improve routing 
efﬁciency, reduce memory consumption, and improve convergence by reducing the length 
of routing tables. The ﬁnal sections of this chapter examine the automatic summarization 
of routes at the boundaries of classful networks, using a feature called autosummarization.
Because classful routing protocols do not advertise subnet mask information, the routing 
updates simply list subnet numbers but no accompanying mask. A router receiving a 
routing update with a classful routing protocol looks at the subnet number in the update, but 
the router must make some assumptions about what mask is associated with the subnet. For 
example, with Cisco routers, if R1 and R2 have connected networks of the same single 
Class A, B, or C network, and if R2 receives an update from R1, R2 assumes that the routes 
described in R1’s update use the same mask that R2 uses. In other words, the classful 
routing protocols require a static-length subnet mask (SLSM) throughout each classful 
network so that each router can then reasonably assume that the mask conﬁgured for its own 
interfaces is the same mask used throughout that classful network.
0000  1010  0000  0010  0000  0  000  0000  0000  -  10.2.0.0
1111  1111  1111  1111  1111  1  000  0000  0000  -  255.255.248.0

Autosummarization and Discontiguous Classful Networks     219
When a router has interfaces in more than one Class A, B, or C network, it can advertise a 
single route for an entire Class A, B, or C network into the other classful network. This 
feature is called autosummarization. It can be characterized as follows:
When advertised on an interface whose IP address is not in network X, routes 
related to subnets in network X are summarized and advertised as one route. 
That route is for the entire Class A, B, or C network X.
In other words, if R3 has interfaces in networks 10.0.0.0 and 11.0.0.0, when R3 advertises 
routing updates out interfaces with IP addresses that start with 11, the updates advertise a 
single route for network 10.0.0.0. Similarly, R3 advertises a single route to 11.0.0.0 out its 
interfaces whose IP addresses start with 10.
An Example of Autosummarization
As usual, an example makes the concept much clearer. Consider Figure 5-4, which shows 
two networks in use: 10.0.0.0 and 172.16.0.0. Seville has four (connected) routes to subnets 
of network 10.0.0.0. Example 5-6 shows the output of the show ip route command on 
Albuquerque, as well as RIP-1 debug ip rip output.

220     Chapter 5: VLSM and Route Summarization
As shown in Example 5-6, Albuquerque’s received update on Serial0/1 from Seville 
advertises only the entire Class A network 10.0.0.0 because autosummarization is enabled 
on Seville (by default). As a result, the Albuquerque IP routing table lists just one route to 
network 10.0.0.0.
This example also points out another feature of how classful routing protocols make 
assumptions. Albuquerque does not have any interfaces in network 10.0.0.0. So, when 
Albuquerque receives the routing update, it assumes that the mask used with 10.0.0.0 is 
255.0.0.0, the default mask for a Class A network. In other words, classful routing protocols 
expect autosummarization to occur.
Discontiguous Classful Networks
Autosummarization does not cause any problems as long as the summarized network is 
contiguous rather than discontiguous. U.S. residents can appreciate the concept of a 
discontiguous network based on the common term contiguous 48, referring to the 48 U.S. 
states besides Alaska and Hawaii. To drive to Alaska from the contiguous 48, for example, 
you must drive through another country (Canada, for the geographically impaired!), so 
Alaska is not contiguous with the 48 states. In other words, it is discontiguous.
To better understand what the terms contiguous and discontiguous mean in networking, 
refer to the following two formal deﬁnitions when reviewing the example of a 
discontiguous classful network that follows:
■
Contiguous network: A classful network in which packets sent between every pair of 
subnets can pass only through subnets of that same classful network, without having 
to pass through subnets of any other classful network.
■
Discontiguous network: A classful network in which packets sent between at least 
one pair of subnets must pass through subnets of a different classful network.

Figure 5-5 shows an example of a discontiguous network 10.0.0.0. In this case, packets sent 
from the subnets of network 10.0.0.0 on the left, near Yosemite, to the subnets of network 
10.0.0.0 on the right, near Seville, have to pass through subnets of network 172.16.0.0.

Autosummarization prevents an internetwork with a discontiguous network from working 
properly. Example 5-7 shows the results of using autosummarization in the internetwork 
shown in Figure 5-5, in this case using the classful RIP-1 routing protocol.
As shown in Example 5-7, Albuquerque now has two routes to network 10.0.0.0/8: one 
pointing left toward Yosemite and one pointing right toward Seville. Instead of sending 
packets destined for Yosemite’s subnets out Serial 0/0, Albuquerque sends some packets out

S0/1 to Seville! Albuquerque simply balances the packets across the two routes, because as 
far as Albuquerque can tell, the two routes are simply equal-cost routes to the same 
destination: the entire network 10.0.0.0. So, applications would cease to function correctly 
in this network.
The solution to this problem is to disable the use of autosummarization. Because classful 
routing protocols must use autosummarization, the solution requires migration to a 
classless routing protocol and disabling the autosummarization feature. Example 5-8 shows 
the same internetwork from Figure 5-5 and Example 5-7, but this time with (classless) 
EIGRP, with autosummarization disabled.
With autosummarization disabled on both Yosemite and Seville, neither router advertises 
an automatic summary of network 10.0.0.0/8 to Albuquerque. Instead, each router 
advertises the known subnets, so now Albuquerque knows the four LAN subnets off 
Yosemite as well as the four LAN subnets off Seville.

Autosummarization and Discontiguous Classful Networks     223
Autosummarization Support and Configuration
Classful routing protocols must use autosummarization. Some classless routing protocols 
support autosummarization, defaulting to use it, but with the ability to disable it with the 
no autosummary router subcommand. Other classless routing protocols, notably Open 
Shortest Path First (OSPF), simply do not support autosummarization. Table 5-5 
summarizes the facts about autosummarization on Cisco routers.
1 As of IOS 12.4 mainline.
Also note that the autosummary feature impacts routers that directly connect to parts of 
more than one classful network, but it has no impact on routers whose interfaces all connect 
to the same single classful network. For example, in Figure 5-5, the solution (as shown in 
Example 5-8) required the no auto-summary EIGRP subcommand on both Yosemite and 
Seville. However, Albuquerque, whose interfaces all sit inside a single network (Class B 
network 172.16.0.0), would not change its behavior with either the auto-summary or no 
auto-summary command conﬁgured in this case.

IP Access Control Lists
Network security is one of the hottest topics in networking today. Although security has 
always been important, the explosion of the size and scope of the Internet has created more 
security exposures. In years past, most companies were not permanently connected to a 
global network—a network through which others could attempt to illegally access their 
networks. Today, because most companies connect to the Internet, many companies receive 
signiﬁcant income through their network-based facilities—facts that increase the exposure 
and increase the impact when security is breached.
Cisco routers can be used as part of a good overall security strategy. One of the most 
important tools in Cisco IOS software used as part of that strategy are access control lists 
(ACL). ACLs deﬁne rules that can be used to prevent some packets from ﬂowing through 
the network. Whether you simply want to restrict access to the payroll server to only people 
in the payroll department, or whether you are trying to stop Internet hackers from bringing 
your e-commerce web server to its knees, IOS ACLs can be a key security tool that is part 
of a larger security strategy.
This chapter is in Part II of this book, which is oriented toward IP routing topics. The reason 
that it is in Part II is that the most typical use of ACLs on the CCNA exams is to ﬁlter 
packets. So, whereas Chapters 4 and 5 discuss various features that impact the IP routing 
process to allow packets to ﬂow, this chapter examines ACLs that then prevent selected 
packets from ﬂowing.

Standard IP Access Control Lists     231
Foundation Topics
Cisco IOS has supported IP ACLs almost since the original commercial Cisco routers were 
introduced in the late 1980s. IOS identiﬁed these ACLs with a number. Years later, as part 
of the introduction of IOS 11.2, Cisco added the ability to create named ACLs. These 
named ACLs provide some other minor beneﬁts as compared to numbered ACLs, but both 
could be used to ﬁlter the exact same packets with the exact same rules. Finally, with the 
introduction of IOS 12.3, Cisco improved ACL support again, particularly with how IOS 
allows engineers to edit existing ACLs. This latest major step in the progression of ACLs 
over the years makes numbered and named ACLs support the exact same features, other 
than the one obvious difference of using either a number or a name to identify the ACL.
Because of the historical progression of Cisco’s support for ACLs, the CCNA exams still 
cover a lot of the same information and conﬁguration commands that have been used with 
Cisco routers for almost 20 years. To support all that history, this chapter spends most of its 
time explaining IP ACLs—numbered IP ACLs—using the same commands and syntax 
available in IOS for a long time. In particular, this chapter begins with a description of the 
simplest types of numbered IP ACLs—standard IP ACLs. The second major section then 
examines the more-complex extended IP ACLs, which can be used to examine many more 
ﬁelds inside an IP packet. Following that, the next section of the chapter describes the 
deepening support for ACLs in IOS—both the introduction of support for named ACLs 
with IOS version 11.2, and the later addition of support for ACL sequence numbers and 
enhanced ACL editing with IOS 12.3. The chapter concludes by covering miscellaneous 
ACL topics.
Standard IP Access Control Lists
IP ACLs cause a router to discard some packets based on criteria deﬁned by the network 
engineer. The goal of these ﬁlters is to prevent unwanted trafﬁc in the network—whether 
preventing hackers from penetrating the network or just preventing employees from using 
systems they shouldn’t. Access lists should simply be part of an organization’s security 
policy.
By the way, IP access lists can also be used to ﬁlter routing updates, to match packets for 
prioritization, to match packets for VPN tunneling, and to match packets for implementing 
quality-of-service features. You will also see ACLs used as part of conﬁguring Network 
Address Translation (NAT) in Chapter 16, “Network Address Translation.” So you will see 
ACLs in most of the other Cisco certiﬁcation exams as you move on in your career.

232     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
This chapter covers two main categories of IOS IP ACLs—standard and extended. Standard 
ACLs use simpler logic, and extended ACLs use more-complex logic. The ﬁrst section of 
this chapter covers standard IP ACLs, followed by a section on extended IP ACLs. Several 
sections related to both types of ACLs close the chapter.
IP Standard ACL Concepts
Engineers need to make two major choices for any ACL that will ﬁlter IP packets: which 
packets to ﬁlter, and where in the network to place the ACL. Figure 6-1 serves as an 
example. In this case, imagine that Bob is not allowed to access Server1, but Larry is.
Figure 6-1
Locations Where Access List Logic Can Be Applied in the Network
Filtering logic could be conﬁgured on any of the three routers and on any of their interfaces. 
The dotted arrowed lines in the ﬁgure show the most appropriate points at which to apply 
the ﬁltering logic in an ACL. Because Bob’s trafﬁc is the only trafﬁc that needs to be 
ﬁltered, and the goal is to stop access to Server1, the access list could be applied at either 
R1 or R3. And because Bob’s attempted trafﬁc to Server1 would not need to go through R2, 
R2 would not be a good place to put the access list logic. For the sake of discussion, assume 
that R1 should have the access list applied.
Cisco IOS software applies the ﬁltering logic of an ACL either as a packet enters an 
interface or as it exits the interface. In other words, IOS associates an ACL with an 
interface, and speciﬁcally for trafﬁc either entering or exiting the interface. After you have 
chosen the router on which you want to place the access list, you must choose the interface 
on which to apply the access logic, as well as whether to apply the logic for inbound or 
outbound packets.
For instance, imagine that you want to ﬁlter Bob’s packets sent to Server1. Figure 6-2 
shows the options for ﬁltering the packet.

Figure 6-2
Internal Processing in R1 in Relation to Where R1 Can Filter Packets
Filtering logic can be applied to packets entering S1 or to packets exiting E0 on R1 to match 
the packet sent by Bob to Server1. In general, you can ﬁlter packets by creating and 
enabling access lists for both incoming and outgoing packets on each interface. Here are 
some key features of Cisco access lists:
■
Packets can be ﬁltered as they enter an interface, before the routing decision.
■
Packets can be ﬁltered before they exit an interface, after the routing decision.
■
Deny is the term used in Cisco IOS software to imply that the packet will be ﬁltered.
■
Permit is the term used in Cisco IOS software to imply that the packet will not be 
ﬁltered.
■
The ﬁltering logic is conﬁgured in the access list.
■
At the end of every access list is an implied “deny all trafﬁc” statement. Therefore, if 
a packet does not match any of your access list statements, it is blocked.
For example, you might create an access list in R1 and enable it on R1’s S1 interface. The 
access list would look for packets that came from Bob. Therefore, the access list would need 
to be enabled for inbound packets, because in this network, packets from Bob enter S1, and 
packets to Bob exit S1.

234     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
Access lists have two major steps in their logic: matching and action. Matching logic 
examines each packet and determines whether it matches the access-list statement. For 
instance, Bob’s IP address would be used to match packets sent from Bob. IP ACLs tell the 
router to take one of two actions when a statement is matched: deny or permit. Deny means 
to discard the packet, and permit implies that the packet should continue on its way.
So the access list for preventing Bob’s trafﬁc to the server might go something like this:
Look for packets with Bob’s source IP address and Server1’s destination IP 
address. When you see them, discard them. If you see any other packets, do 
not discard them.
Not surprisingly, IP ACLs can get a lot more difﬁcult than those in real life. Even a short 
list of matching criteria can create complicated access lists on a variety of interfaces in a 
variety of routers. I’ve even heard of a couple of large networks with a few full-time people 
who do nothing but plan and implement access lists!
Cisco calls its packet-ﬁltering features “access control lists” in part because the logic is 
created with multiple conﬁguration commands that are considered to be in the same list. 
When an access list has multiple entries, IOS searches the list sequentially until the ﬁrst 
statement is matched. The matched statement determines the action to be taken. The two 
diamond shapes in Figure 6-2 represent the application of access list logic.
The logic that IOS uses with a multiple-entry ACL can be summarized as follows:
1.
The matching parameters of the access-list statement are compared to the packet.
2.
If a match is made, the action deﬁned in this access-list statement (permit or deny) is 
performed.
3.
If a match is not made in Step 2, repeat Steps 1 and 2 using each successive statement 
in the ACL until a match is made.
4.
If no match is made with an entry in the access list, the deny action is performed.
Wildcard Masks
IOS IP ACLs match packets by looking at the IP, TCP, and UDP headers in the packet. 
Extended access lists can check source and destination IP addresses, as well as source and 
destination port numbers, along with several other ﬁelds. However, standard IP access lists 
can examine only the source IP address.

Standard IP Access Control Lists     235
Regardless of whether you use standard or extended IP ACLs, you can tell the router to 
match based on the entire IP address or just a part of the IP address. For instance, if you 
wanted to stop Bob from sending packets to Server1, you would look at the entire IP 
address of Bob and Server1 in the access list. But what if the criteria were to stop all hosts 
in Bob’s subnet from getting to Server1? Because all hosts in Bob’s subnet have the same 
numbers in their ﬁrst 3 octets, the access list could just check the ﬁrst 3 octets of the address 
to match all packets with a single access-list command.
Cisco wildcard masks deﬁne the portion of the IP address that should be examined. When 
deﬁning the ACL statements, as you’ll see in the next section of this chapter, you can deﬁne 
a wildcard mask along with the IP address. The wildcard mask tells the router which part 
of the IP address in the conﬁguration statement must be compared with the packet header.
For example, suppose that one mask implies that the whole packet should be checked and 
another implies that only the ﬁrst 3 octets of the address need to be examined. (You might 
choose to do that to match all IP hosts in the same subnet when using a subnet mask of 
255.255.255.0.) To perform this matching, Cisco access lists use wildcard masks.
Wildcard masks look similar to subnet masks, but they are not the same. Wildcard masks 
represent a 32-bit number, as do subnet masks. However, the wildcard mask’s 0 bits tell the 
router that those corresponding bits in the address must be compared when performing the 
matching logic. The binary 1s in the wildcard mask tell the router that those bits do not need 
to be compared. In fact, many people call these bits the “don’t care” bits.
To get a sense of the idea behind a wildcard mask, Table 6-2 lists some of the more popular 
wildcard masks, along with their meanings.

236     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
The ﬁrst several examples show typical uses of the wildcard mask. As you can see, it is not 
a subnet mask. A wildcard of 0.0.0.0 means that the entire IP address must be examined, 
and be equal, to be considered a match. 0.0.0.255 means that the last octet automatically 
matches, but the ﬁrst 3 must be examined, and so on. More generally, the wildcard mask 
means the following:
Bit positions of binary 0 mean that the access list compares the corresponding 
bit position in the IP address and makes sure it is equal to the same bit position 
in the address conﬁgured in the access-list statement. Bit positions of binary 
1 are “don’t care” bits. Those bit positions are immediately considered to be 
a match.
The last two rows of Table 6-2 show two reasonable, but not obvious, wildcard masks. 
0.0.15.255 in binary is 20 binary 0s followed by 12 binary 1s. This means that the ﬁrst 20 
bits must match. Similarly, 0.0.3.255 means that the ﬁrst 22 bits must be examined to ﬁnd 
out if they match. Why are these useful? If the subnet mask is 255.255.240.0, and you want 
to match all hosts in the same subnet, the 0.0.15.255 wildcard means that all network and 
subnet bits must be matched, and all host bits are automatically considered to match. 
Likewise, if you want to ﬁlter all hosts in a subnet that uses subnet mask 255.255.252.0, the 
wildcard mask 0.0.3.255 matches the network and subnet bits. In general, if you want a 
wildcard mask that helps you match all hosts in a subnet, invert the subnet mask, and you 
have the correct wildcard mask.

Sample Access List Wildcard Masks (Continued)

Standard IP Access Control Lists     237
A Quicker Alternative for Interpreting Wildcard Masks
Both IP standard ACLs (source IP address only) and extended ACLs (both source and 
destination addresses) can be conﬁgured to examine all or part of an IP address based on 
the wildcard mask. However, particularly for the exams, working with the masks in binary 
may be slow and laborious unless you master binary-to-decimal and decimal-to-binary 
conversions. This section suggests an easier method of working with ACL wildcard masks 
that works well if you have already mastered subnetting math.
In many cases, an ACL needs to match all hosts in a particular subnet. To match a subnet 
with an ACL, you can use the following shortcut:
■
Use the subnet number as the address value in the access-list command.
■
Use a wildcard mask found by subtracting the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.
For example, for subnet 172.16.8.0 255.255.252.0, use the subnet number (172.16.8.0) as 
the address parameter, and then do the following math to ﬁnd the wildcard mask:
Some exam questions may not ask that you pick the ACL statement that needs to be 
conﬁgured, instead asking that you interpret some existing access-list commands. 
Typically, these questions list preconﬁgured ACL statements, or you need to display the 
contents of an ACL from a router simulator, and you need to decide which statement a 
particular packet matches. To do that, you need to determine the range of IP addresses 
matched by a particular address/wildcard mask combination in each ACL statement.
If you have mastered subnetting math using any of the decimal shortcuts, avoiding binary 
math, another shortcut can be used to analyze each existing address/wildcard pair in each 
ACL command. To do so:
Step 1 Use the address in the access-list command as if it were a subnet number.
Step 2 Use the number found by subtracting the wildcard mask from 
255.255.255.255 as a subnet mask.
Step 3 Treat the values from the ﬁrst two steps as a subnet number and subnet 
mask, and ﬁnd the broadcast address for the subnet. The ACL matches 
the range of addresses between the subnet number and broadcast address, 
inclusively.

0. 

238     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
The range of addresses identiﬁed by this process is the same range of addresses matched by 
the ACL. So, if you can already ﬁnd a subnet’s range of addresses quickly and easily, using 
this process to change an ACL’s math may help you ﬁnd the answer more quickly on the 
exams. For example, with the command access-list 1 permit 172.16.200.0 0.0.7.255, you 
would ﬁrst think of 172.16.200.0 as a subnet number. Then you could calculate the assumed 
subnet mask of 255.255.248.0, as follows:
From there, using any process you like, use subnetting math to determine that the broadcast 
address of this subnet would be 172.16.207.255. So, the range of addresses matched by this 
ACL statement would be 172.16.200.0 through 172.16.207.255.
Standard IP Access List Configuration
ACL conﬁguration tends to be simpler than the task of interpreting the meaning and actions 
taken by an ACL. To that end, this section presents a plan of attack for conﬁguring ACLs. 
Then it shows a couple of examples that review both the conﬁguration and the concepts 
implemented by those ACLs.
The generic syntax of the standard ACL conﬁguration command is
access-list access-list-number {deny | permit} source [source-wildcard]
A standard access list uses a series of access-list commands that have the same number. The 
access-list commands with the same number are considered to be in the same list, with the 
commands being listed in the same order in which they were added to the conﬁguration. 
Each access-list command can match a range of source IP addresses. If a match occurs, the 
ACL either allows the packet to keep going (permit action) or discards the packet (deny 
action). Each standard ACL can match all, or only part, of the packet’s source IP address. 
Note that for standard IP ACLs, the number range for ACLs is 1 to 99 and 1300 to 1999.
NOTE
CD-only Appendix F, Scenario 3, provides an opportunity to practice choosing 
a wildcard mask to match hosts in a particular subnet.

Standard IP Access Control Lists     239
The following list outlines a suggested conﬁguration process. You do not need to memorize 
the process itself for the exam; it is simply listed here as a convenient study review aid.
Step 1 Plan the location (router and interface) and direction (in or out) on that interface:
a. Standard ACLs should be placed near to the destination of the packets 
so that it does not unintentionally discard packets that should not be 
discarded.
b. Because standard ACLs can only match a packet’s source IP address, 
identify the source IP addresses of packets as they go in the direction 
that the ACL is examining.
Step 2 Conﬁgure one or more access-list global conﬁguration commands to 
create the ACL, keeping the following in mind:
a. The list is searched sequentially, using ﬁrst-match logic. In other 
words, when a packet matches one of the access-list statements, the 
search is over, even if the packet would match subsequent statements.
b. The default action, if a packet does not match any of the access-list 
commands, is to deny (discard) the packet.
Step 3 Enable the ACL on the chosen router interface, in the correct direction, 
using the ip access-group number {in | out} interface subcommand.
Next, two examples of standard ACLs are shown.
Standard IP ACL: Example 1
Example 6-1 attempts to stop Bob’s trafﬁc to Server1. As shown in Figure 6-1, Bob is not 
allowed to access Server1. In Example 6-1, the conﬁguration enables an ACL for all packets 
going out R1’s Ethernet0 interface. The ACL matches the source address in the packet—
Bob’s IP address. Note that the access-list commands are at the bottom of the example 

240     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
because the show running-conﬁg command also lists them near the bottom, after the 
interface conﬁguration commands.
First, focus on the basic syntax of the commands. Standard IP access lists use a number in 
the range of 1 to 99 or 1300 to 1999. This example uses ACL number 1 versus the other 
available numbers for no particular reason. (There is absolutely no difference in using one 
number or another, as long as it is in the correct range. In other words, list 1 is no better or 
worse than list 99.) The access-list commands, under which the matching and action logic 
are deﬁned, are global conﬁguration commands. To enable the ACL on an interface and 
deﬁne the direction of packets to which the ACL is applied, the ip access-group command 
is used. In this case, it enables the logic for ACL 1 on Ethernet0 for packets going out the 
interface.
ACL 1 keeps packets sent by Bob from exiting R1’s Ethernet interface, based on the 
matching logic of the access-list 1 deny 172.16.3.10 0.0.0.0 command. The wildcard mask 
of 0.0.0.0 means “match all 32 bits,” so only packets whose IP address exactly matches 
172.16.3.10 match this statement and are discarded. The access-list 1 permit 0.0.0.0 
255.255.255.255 command, the last statement in the list, matches all packets, because the 
wildcard mask of 255.255.255.255 means “don’t care” about all 32 bits. In other words, the 
statement matches all IP source addresses. These packets are permitted.
Finally, note that the engineer also added an access-list 1 remark command to the ACL. 
This command allows the addition of a text comment, or remark, so that you can track the 
purpose of the ACL. The remark only shows up in the conﬁguration; it is not listed in show 
command output.
Although it’s a seemingly simple example, in this case access list 1 also prevents Bob’s 
packets sent to Server2 from being delivered. With the topology shown in Figure 6-1, an 
outbound standard ACL on R1’s E0 interface cannot somehow deny Bob access to Server1 
while permitting access to Server2. To do that, an extended ACL is needed that can check 
both the source and destination IP addresses.

Interestingly, if the commands in Example 6-1 are entered in conﬁguration mode, IOS 
changes the conﬁguration syntax of a couple of commands. The output of the show 
running-conﬁg command in Example 6-2 shows what IOS actually places in the 
conﬁguration ﬁle.
The commands in Example 6-1 are changed based on three factors. Cisco IOS allows both 
an older style and newer style of conﬁguration for some parameters. Example 6-1 shows 
the older style, and the router changes to the equivalent newer-style conﬁguration in 
Example 6-2. First, the use of a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.0 does indeed mean that the router 
should match that speciﬁc host IP address. The newer-style conﬁguration uses the host 
keyword in front of the speciﬁc IP address. The other change to the newer-style 
conﬁguration involves the use of wildcard mask 255.255.255.255 to mean “match 
anything.” The newer-style conﬁguration uses the keyword any to replace both the IP 
address and 255.255.255.255 wildcard mask. any simply means that any IP address is 
matched.
Standard IP ACL: Example 2
The second standard IP ACL example exposes more ACL issues. Figure 6-3 and Examples 
6-3 and 6-4 show a basic use of standard IP access lists, with two typical oversights in the 
ﬁrst attempt at a complete solution. The criteria for the access lists are as follows:
■
Sam is not allowed access to Bugs or Daffy.
■
Hosts on the Seville Ethernet are not allowed access to hosts on the Yosemite Ethernet.
■
All other combinations are allowed.

Standard IP Access Control Lists     243
At ﬁrst glance, these two access lists seem to perform the desired function. ACL 3, enabled 
for packets exiting Yosemite’s S0 interface, takes care of criterion 1, because ACL 3 
matches Sam’s IP address exactly. ACL 4 in Seville, enabled for packets exiting its S1 
interface, takes care of criterion 2, because ACL 4 matches all packets coming from subnet 
10.1.3.0/24. Both routers meet criterion 3: A wildcard permit any is used at the end of each 
access list to override the default, which is to discard all other packets. So all the criteria 
appear to be met.
However, when one of the WAN links fails, some holes can appear in the ACLs. For 
example, if the link from Albuquerque to Yosemite fails, Yosemite learns a route to 10.1.1.0/
24 through Seville. Packets from Sam, forwarded by Yosemite and destined for hosts in 
Albuquerque, leave Yosemite’s serial 1 interface without being ﬁltered. So criterion 1 is no 
longer met. Similarly, if the link from Seville to Yosemite fails, Seville routes packets 
through Albuquerque, routing around the access list enabled on Seville, so criterion 2 is no 
longer met.
Example 6-5 illustrates an alternative solution, with all the conﬁguration on Yosemite—one 
that works even when some of the links fail.
The conﬁguration shown in Example 6-5 solves the problem from Examples 6-3 and 6-4. 
ACL 3 checks for Sam’s source IP address, and it is enabled on both serial links for 
outbound trafﬁc. So, of the trafﬁc that is rerouted because of a WAN link failure, the packets 
from Sam are still ﬁltered. To meet criterion 2, Yosemite ﬁlters packets as they exit its

Ethernet interface. Therefore, regardless of which of the two WAN links the packets enter, 
packets from Seville’s subnet are not forwarded to Yosemite’s Ethernet.
Extended IP Access Control Lists
Extended IP access lists have both similarities and differences compared to standard IP 
ACLs. Just like standard lists, you enable extended access lists on interfaces for packets 
either entering or exiting the interface. IOS searches the list sequentially. The ﬁrst statement 
matched stops the search through the list and deﬁnes the action to be taken. All these 
features are true of standard access lists as well.
The one key difference between the two is the variety of ﬁelds in the packet that can be 
compared for matching by extended access lists. A single extended ACL statement can 
examine multiple parts of the packet headers, requiring that all the parameters be matched 
correctly to match that one ACL statement. That matching logic is what makes extended 
access lists both much more useful and much more complex than standard IP ACLs.
This section starts with coverage of the extended IP ACL concepts that differ from standard 
ACLs—namely, the matching logic. Following that, the conﬁguration details are covered.
Extended IP ACL Concepts
Extended access lists create powerful matching logic by examining many parts of a packet. 
Figure 6-4 shows several of the ﬁelds in the packet headers that can be matched.

The top set of headers shows the IP protocol type, which identiﬁes what header follows the 
IP header. You can specify all IP packets, or those with TCP headers, UDP headers, ICMP, 
and so on, by checking the Protocol ﬁeld. You can also check both the source and 
destination IP addresses, as shown. The lower part of the ﬁgure shows an example with a 
TCP header following the IP header, pointing out the location of the TCP source and 
destination port numbers. These port numbers identify the application. For instance, the 
web uses port 80 by default. If you specify a protocol of TCP or UDP, you can also check 
the port numbers.
Table 6-3 summarizes the most commonly used ﬁelds that can be matched with an extended 
IP ACL, as compared with standard IP ACLs.
Knowing what to look for is just half the battle. IOS checks all the matching information 
conﬁgured in a single access-list command. Everything must match for that single 
command to be considered a match and for the deﬁned action to be taken. The options start 
with the protocol type (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and others), followed by the source IP address, 
source port, destination IP address, and destination port number. Table 6-4 lists several 
sample access-list commands, with several options conﬁgured and some explanations. 
Only the matching options are shaded.

Matching TCP and UDP Port Numbers
Extended IP ACLs allow for the matching of the IP header protocol ﬁeld, as well as 
matching the source and destination TCP or UDP port numbers. However, many people 
have difﬁcultly when ﬁrst conﬁguring ACLs that match port numbers, particularly when 
matching the source port number.
When considering any exam question that involves TCP or UDP ports, keep the following 
key points in mind:
■
The access-list command must use protocol keyword tcp to be able to match TCP ports 
and the udp keyword to be able to match UDP ports. The ip keyword does not allow 
for matching the port numbers.
■
The source port and destination port parameters on the access-list command are 
positional. In other words, their location in the command determines if the parameter 
examines the source or destination port.
Table 6-4
Extended access-list Commands and Logic Explanations

access-list 101 deny ip any host 10.1.1.1
Any IP packet, any source IP address, with a destination 
IP address of 10.1.1.1.
access-list 101 deny tcp any gt 1023 host 
10.1.1.1 eq 23
Packets with a TCP header, any source IP address, with a 
source port greater than (gt) 1023, a destination IP 
address of exactly 10.1.1.1, and a destination port equal 
to (eq) 23.
access-list 101 deny tcp any host 
10.1.1.1 eq 23
The same as the preceding example, but any source port 
matches, because that parameter is omitted in this case.
access-list 101 deny tcp any host 
10.1.1.1 eq telnet
The same as the preceding example. The telnet keyword 
is used instead of port 23.

0.255.255.255 lt 1023 any
A packet with a source in network 1.0.0.0, using UDP 
with a source port less than (lt) 1023, with any 
destination IP address.

Extended IP Access Control Lists     247
■
Remember that ACLs can match packets sent to a server by comparing the destination 
port to the well-known port number. However, ACLs need to match the source port for 
packets sent by the server.

It is useful to memorize the most popular TCP and UDP applications, and their well-
known ports, as listed in Table 6-5, as shown later in this chapter.
For example, consider the simple network shown in Figure 6-5. The FTP server sits on the 
right, with the client on the left. The ﬁgure shows the syntax of an ACL that matches
■
Packets that include a TCP header
■
Packets sent from the client subnet
■
Packets sent to the server subnet
■
Packets with TCP destination port 21
Figure 6-5
Filtering Packets Based on Destination Port
To fully appreciate the matching of the destination port with the eq 21 parameter, consider 
packets moving left to right, from PC1 to the server. If the server is using well-known port 
21 (FTP control port), the packet sent by PC1, in the TCP header, has a destination port 
value of 21. The ACL syntax includes the eq 21 parameter after the destination IP address, 
with this position in the command implying that this parameter matches the destination 
port. As a result, the ACL statement shown in the ﬁgure would match this packet, and the 
destination port of 21, if used in any of the four locations implied by the four thick arrowed 
lines in the ﬁgure.
Conversely, Figure 6-6 shows the reverse ﬂow, with a packet sent by the server back toward 
PC1. In this case, the packet’s TCP header has a source port of 21, so the ACL must check 
the source port value of 21, and the ACL must be located on different interfaces.

Filtering Packets Based on Source Port
For exam questions that require ACLs and matching of port numbers, ﬁrst consider whether 
the question requires that the ACL be placed in a certain location and direction. If so, you 
can then determine if that ACL would process packets either sent to the server or sent by 
the server. At that point, you can decide whether you need to check the source or destination 
port in the packet.
For reference, Table 6-5 lists many of the popular port numbers and their transport layer 
protocols and applications. Note that the syntax of the access-list commands accepts both 
the port numbers and a shorthand version of the application name.

Extended IP Access Control Lists     249
Extended IP ACL Configuration
Because extended ACLs can match so many different ﬁelds in the various headers in an IP 
packet, the command syntax cannot be easily summarized in a single generic command. 
For reference, Table 6-6 lists the syntax of the two most common generic commands.
The conﬁguration process for extended ACLs mostly matches the same process used for 
standard ACLs. The location and direction should be chosen ﬁrst so that the ACL’s 
parameters can be planned based on the information in the packets ﬂowing in that direction. 
The ACL should be conﬁgured with access-list commands. Then the ACL should be 
enabled with the same ip access-group command used with standard ACLs. All these steps 
remain the same as with standard ACLs. However, the differences in conﬁguration are 
summarized as follows:
■
Extended ACLs should be placed as close as possible to the source of the packets to be 
ﬁltered, because extended ACLs can be conﬁgured so that they do not discard packets 
that should not be discarded. So ﬁltering close to the source of the packets saves some 
bandwidth.
■
All ﬁelds in one access-list command must match a packet for the packet to be 
considered to match that access-list statement.
■
The extended access-list command uses numbers between 100–199 and 2000–2699, 
with no number being inherently better than another.
The extended version of the access-list command allows for matching of port numbers 
using several basic operations, such as equal-to and less-than. However, the commands use 
abbreviations, so Table 6-7 lists the abbreviations and a fuller explanation.

This example focuses on understanding the basic syntax. In this case, Bob is denied access 
to all FTP servers on R1’s Ethernet, and Larry is denied access to Server1’s web server. 
Figure 6-7 is a reminder of the network topology. Example 6-6 shows the conﬁguration on R1.

Extended IP Access Control Lists     251
In Example 6-6, the ﬁrst ACL statement prevents Bob’s access to FTP servers in subnet 
172.16.1.0. The second statement prevents Larry’s access to web services on Server1. The 
ﬁnal statement permits all other trafﬁc.
Focusing on the syntax for a moment, there are several new items to review. First, the access 
list number for extended access lists falls in the range of 100 to 199 or 2000 to 2699. 
Following the permit or deny action, the protocol parameter deﬁnes whether you want to 
check for all IP packets or just those with TCP or UDP headers. When you check for TCP 
or UDP port numbers, you must specify the TCP or UDP protocol.
This example uses the eq parameter, meaning “equals,” to check the destination port 
numbers for FTP control (keyword ftp) and HTTP trafﬁc (keyword www). You can use the 
numeric values—or, for the more popular options, a more obvious text version is valid. (If 
you were to enter eq 80, the conﬁg would show eq www.)
In this ﬁrst extended ACL example, the access lists could have been placed on R2 and R3 
instead of on R1. As you will read near the end of this chapter, Cisco makes some speciﬁc 
recommendations about where to locate IP ACLs. With extended IP ACLs, Cisco suggests 
that you locate them as close as possible to the source of the packet. Therefore, Example 6-
7 achieves the same goal as Example 6-6 of stopping Bob’s access to FTP servers at the 
main site, and it does so with an ACL on R3.
ACL 101 looks a lot like ACL 101 from Example 6-6, but this time, the ACL does not bother 
to check for the criteria to match Larry’s trafﬁc, because Larry’s trafﬁc will never enter R3’s 
Ethernet 0 interface. Because the ACL has been placed on R3, near Bob, it watches for 
packets Bob sends that enter its Ethernet0 interface. Because of the ACL, Bob’s FTP trafﬁc 
to 172.16.1.0/24 is denied, with all other trafﬁc entering R3’s E0 interface making it into 
the network. Example 6-7 does not show any logic for stopping Larry’s trafﬁc.

Advances in Managing ACL Configuration     253
This conﬁguration solves the problem with few statements while keeping to Cisco’s design 
guideline of placing extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the trafﬁc. The 
ACL ﬁlters packets that enter Yosemite’s E0 interface, which is the ﬁrst router interface that 
packets sent by Sam enter. The issue of having packets “routed around” access lists on serial 
interfaces is taken care of with the placement on Yosemite’s only Ethernet interface. Also, 
the ﬁltering mandated by the second requirement (to disallow Seville’s LAN hosts from 
accessing Yosemite’s) is met by the second access-list statement. Stopping packet ﬂow 
from Yosemite’s LAN subnet to Seville’s LAN subnet stops effective communication 
between the two subnets. Alternatively, the opposite logic could have been conﬁgured at 
Seville.
Advances in Managing ACL Configuration
Now that you have a good understanding of the core concepts in IOS IP ACLs, this next 
section examines a couple of enhancements to IOS support for ACLs: named ACLs and 
ACL sequence numbers. Although both features are useful and important, neither adds any 
function as to what a router can and cannot ﬁlter, as compared to the numbered ACLs 
already covered in this chapter. Instead, named ACLs and ACL sequence numbers provide 
the engineer with conﬁguration options that make it easier to remember ACL names and 
easier to edit existing ACLs when an ACL needs to change.
Named IP Access Lists
Named ACLs, introduced with IOS version 11.2, can be used to match the same packets, 
with the same parameters, that can be matched with standard and extended IP ACLs. 
Named IP ACLs do have some differences, however, some of which make them easier to 
work with. The most obvious difference is that IOS identiﬁes named ACLs using names you 
make up, as opposed to numbers—and you have a better chance of remembering names.
In addition to using more memorable names, the other major advantage of named ACLs 
over numbered ACLs, at the time they were introduced into IOS, was that you could delete 
individual lines in a named IP access list. Throughout the history of numbered IP ACLs and 
the ip access-list global command, until the introduction of IOS 12.3, a single line in a 
numbered ACL could not be deleted. For example, if you had earlier conﬁgured the ip 
access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 80 command, and then you entered the no ip access-
list 101 permit tcp any any eq 80 command, the whole ACL 101 would be deleted! The 

254     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
advantage of the introduction of named ACLs is that you can enter a command that removes 
individual lines in an ACL.
The conﬁguration syntax is very similar between named and numbered IP access lists. The 
items that can be matched with a numbered standard IP access list are identical to the items 
that can be matched with a named standard IP access list. Likewise, the items are identical 
with both numbered and named extended IP access lists.
Two important conﬁguration differences exist between old-style numbered ACLs and the 
newer named access lists. One key difference is that named access lists use a global 
command that places the user in a named IP access list submode, under which the matching 
and permit/deny logic is conﬁgured. The other key difference is that when a named 
matching statement is deleted, only that one statement is deleted.
Example 6-9 shows an example that uses named IP ACLs. It shows the changing command 
prompt in conﬁguration mode, showing that the user has been placed in ACL conﬁguration 
mode. It also lists the pertinent parts of the output of a show running-conﬁguration 
command. It ends with an example of how you can delete individual lines in a named ACL.
NOTE
With IOS 12.3, Cisco expanded IOS to be able to delete individual lines in 
numbered ACLs, making IOS support for editing both named and numbered ACLs 
equivalent. These details are explained in the next section.

Advances in Managing ACL Configuration     255
Example 6-9 begins with the creation of an ACL named barney. The ip access-list extended 
barney command creates the ACL, naming it barney and placing the user in ACL 
conﬁguration mode. This command also tells the IOS that barney is an extended ACL. Next, 
seven different permit and deny statements deﬁne the matching logic and action to be 
taken upon a match. The permit and deny commands use the exact same syntax that the 
numbered access-list commands use, starting with the deny and permit keywords. In this 
example, a comment is added just before the command that is deleted later in the example.
The show running-conﬁg command output lists the named ACL conﬁguration before the 
single entry is deleted. Next, the no deny ip... command deletes a single entry from the 
ACL. Notice that the output of the show running-conﬁg command still lists the ACL, with 
six permit and deny commands instead of seven.

Editing ACLs Using Sequence Numbers
Numbered ACLs have existed in IOS since the early days of Cisco routers. From their 
creation, up through IOS version 12.2, the only way to edit an existing numbered ACL—
for example, to simply delete a line from the ACL—was to delete the whole ACL and then 
reconﬁgure the entire ACL. Besides being an inconvenience to the engineer, this process 
also caused some unfortunate side effects. When deleting the ACL, it is important to disable 
the ACL from all interfaces, and then delete it, reconﬁgure it, and enable it on the interface. 
Otherwise, during the reconﬁguration process, before all the statements have been 
reconﬁgured, the ACL will not perform all the checks it should, sometimes causing 
problems, or exposing the network to various attacks.
As mentioned in the preceding section, the original IOS support for named ACLs, introduced in 
IOS 11.2, solved some of the editing problem. The original commands for named ACLs allowed 
the engineer to delete a line from an ACL, as shown in the preceding section in Example 6-9. 
However, the conﬁguration commands did not allow the user to insert a new permit or deny 
command into the list. All new commands were added to the end of the ACL.
With IOS 12.3, Cisco introduced several more conﬁguration options for ACLs—options 
that apply to both named and numbered IP ACLs. These options take advantage of an ACL 
sequence number that is added to each ACL permit or deny statement, with the numbers 
representing the sequence of statements in the ACL. ACL sequence numbers provide the 
following features for both numbered and named ACLs:
■
An individual ACL permit or deny statement can be deleted just by referencing the 
sequence number, without deleting the rest of the ACL.
■
Newly added permit and deny commands can be conﬁgured with a sequence number, 
dictating the location of the statement within the ACL.
■
Newly added permit and deny commands can be conﬁgured without a sequence number, 
with IOS creating a sequence number and placing the command at the end of the ACL.
To take advantage of the ability to delete and insert lines in an ACL, both numbered and 
named ACLs must use the same overall conﬁguration style and commands used for named 
ACLs. The only difference in syntax is whether a name or number is used. Example 6-10 
shows the conﬁguration of a standard numbered IP ACL, using this alternative 
conﬁguration style. The example shows the power of the ACL sequence number for editing. 
In this example, the following occurs:
Step 1 Numbered ACL 24 is conﬁgured, using this new-style conﬁguration, with three 
permit commands.
Step 2 The show ip access-list command shows the three permit commands, 
with sequence numbers 10, 20, and 30.

Advances in Managing ACL Configuration     257
Step 3 The engineer deletes only the second permit command, using the no 20 
ACL subcommand, which simply refers to sequence number 20.
Step 4 The show ip access-list command conﬁrms that the ACL now has only 
two lines (sequence numbers 10 and 30).
Step 5 The engineer adds a new permit command to the beginning of the ACL, 
using the 5 deny 10.1.1.1 ACL subcommand.
Step 6 The show ip access-list command again conﬁrms the changes, this time 
listing three permit commands, sequence numbers 5, 10, and 30.
NOTE
For this example, note that the user does not leave conﬁguration mode, instead 
using the do command to tell IOS to issue the show ip access-list EXEC command from 
conﬁguration mode.

258     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
Interestingly, numbered ACLs can be conﬁgured with the new-style conﬁguration, as 
shown in Example 6-10, or with the old-style conﬁguration, using access-list global 
conﬁguration commands, as shown in the ﬁrst several examples in this chapter. In fact, you 
can use both styles of conﬁguration on a single ACL. However, no matter which style of 
conﬁguration is used, the show running-conﬁg command output still shows the old-style 
conﬁguration commands. Example 6-11 demonstrates these facts, picking up where 
Example 6-10 ended, with the following additional steps:
Step 7 The engineer lists the conﬁguration (show running-conﬁg), which lists 
the old-style conﬁguration commands—even though the ACL was 
created with the new-style commands.
Step 8 The engineer adds a new statement to the end of the ACL, using the old-
style access-list 24 permit 10.1.4.0 0.0.0.255 global conﬁguration 
command.
Step 9 The show ip access-list command conﬁrms that the old-style access-list 
command from the previous step followed the rule of being added only 
to the end of the ACL.
Step 10 The engineer displays the conﬁguration to conﬁrm that the parts of ACL 
24 conﬁgured with both new-style commands and old-style commands 
are all listed in the same old-style ACL (show running-conﬁg).

Miscellaneous ACL Topics     259
Miscellaneous ACL Topics
This short section covers a couple of small topics: how to ﬁlter Telnet and SSH trafﬁc using 
ACLs, and some general implementation guidelines.
Controlling Telnet and SSH Access with ACLs
An engineer can control remote access to a router by using ACLs that look for the well-
known ports used by both Telnet (23) and SSH (22). However, to do the job by enabling 
ACLs on interfaces using the ip access-group interface subcommand, the ACL would need 
to check for all the router’s IP addresses, and both the Telnet and SSH port. As new 
interfaces are conﬁgured, the ACL would need to be updated.
IOS provides a much easier option for protecting access into and out of the virtual terminal 
line (vty) ports. Telnet and SSH users connect to vty lines on a router, so to protect that 
access, an IP ACL can be applied to the vty lines. You can use ACLs to limit the IP hosts 
that can telnet into the router, and you can also limit the hosts to which a user of the router 
can telnet.
For instance, imagine that only hosts in subnet 10.1.1.0/24 are supposed to be able to telnet 
into any of the Cisco routers in a network. In such a case, the conﬁguration shown in 
Example 6-12 could be used on each router to deny access from IP addresses not in that 
subnet.
! Step 10: The numbered ACL configuration remains in old-style configuration commands.

260     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
The access-class command refers to the matching logic in access-list 3. The keyword in 
refers to Telnet connections into this router—in other words, people telnetting into this 
router. As conﬁgured, ACL 3 checks the source IP address of packets for incoming Telnet 
connections.
If the command access-class 3 out had been used, it would have checked for not only 
outgoing Telnets, but also the packets’ destination IP address. When ﬁltering outbound Telnet 
and SSH connections, checking the source IP address, which by deﬁnition must be one of the 
interface IP addresses in that router, would not really make any sense. For ﬁltering outgoing 
Telnet sessions, it makes the most sense to ﬁlter based on the destination IP address. So, the 
use of the access-class 3 out command, particularly the out keyword, is one of those rare 
cases in which a standard IP ACL actually looks at the destination IP address and not the 
source.
ACL Implementation Considerations
In production IP networks, IP ACL creation, troubleshooting, and updates can consume a 
large amount of time and effort. The ICND2 exam does not have many questions about 
things to watch for when you implement IP ACLs in live networks, but it does cover a few 
small items, which are discussed in this section.
Cisco makes the following general recommendations in the courses on which the CCNA 
exams are based:
■
Create your ACLs using a text editor outside the router, and copy and paste the 
conﬁgurations into the router. (Even with the ability to delete and insert lines into an 
ACL, creating the commands in an editor will still likely be an easier process.)
■
Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packet to discard the 
packets quickly.
■
Place standard ACLs as close as possible to the packet’s destination, because standard 
ACLs often discard packets that you do not want discarded when they are placed close 
to the source.
■
Place more-speciﬁc statements early in the ACL.
■
Disable an ACL from its interface (using the no ip access-group command) before 
making changes to the ACL.
The ﬁrst suggestion states that you should create the ACLs outside the router using an 
editor. That way, if you make mistakes when typing, you can ﬁx them in the editor. This 
suggestion is not as important as it was before IOS version 12.3, because IOS 12.3 supports 

Miscellaneous ACL Topics     261
ACL line numbers and the deletion and insertion of single lines in an ACL, as described 
earlier, in the section “Editing ACLs Using Sequence Numbers.”
The second and third points deal with the concept of where to locate your ACLs. If you 
intend to ﬁlter a packet, ﬁltering closer to the packet’s source means that the packet takes 
up less bandwidth in the network, which seems to be more efﬁcient—and it is. Therefore, 
Cisco suggests locating extended ACLs as close to the source as possible.
However, Cisco also suggests, at least in the CCNA-related courses, to locate standard 
ACLs close to the destination. Why not close to the source of the packets? Well, because 
standard ACLs look only at the source IP address, they tend to ﬁlter more than you want 
ﬁltered when placed close to the source. For instance, imagine that Fred and Barney are 
separated by four routers. If you ﬁlter Barney’s trafﬁc sent to Fred on the ﬁrst router, Barney 
can’t reach any hosts near the other three routers. So the Cisco ICND2 course makes a 
blanket recommendation to locate standard ACLs closer to the destination to avoid ﬁltering 
trafﬁc you don’t mean to ﬁlter.
By placing more-speciﬁc matching parameters early in each list, you are less likely to make 
mistakes in the ACL. For instance, imagine that you have a statement that permits all trafﬁc 
from 10.1.1.1 to 10.2.2.2, destined for port 80 (the web), and another statement that denies 
all other packets sourced in subnet 10.1.1.0/24. Both statements would match packets sent 
by host 10.1.1.1 to a web server at 10.2.2.2, but you probably meant to match the more-
speciﬁc statement (permit) ﬁrst. In general, placing the more-speciﬁc statements ﬁrst tends 
to ensure that you don’t miss anything.
Finally, Cisco recommends that you disable the ACLs on the interfaces before you change 
the statements in the list. Thankfully, if you have an IP ACL enabled on an interface with 
the ip access-group command, and you delete the entire ACL, IOS does not ﬁlter any 
packets. (That was not always the case in earlier IOS versions!) Even so, as soon as you add 
a command to the ACL, the IOS starts ﬁltering packets. Suppose you have ACL 101 enabled 
on S0 for output packets. You delete list 101 so that all packets are allowed through. Then 
you enter a single access-list 101 command. As soon as you press Enter, the list exists, and 
the router ﬁlters all packets exiting S0 based on the one-line list. If you want to enter a long 
ACL, you might temporarily ﬁlter packets you don’t want to ﬁlter! Therefore, the better 
NOTE
If you create all your ACLs in a text editor, it may be useful to begin each ﬁle 
with the no access-list number command, followed by the conﬁguration commands in 
the ACL. Then, each time you edit the text ﬁle to change the ACL, all you have to do is 
copy/paste the entire ﬁle’s contents, with the ﬁrst line deleting the entire existing ACL, 
and the rest of the statements re-creating the new ACL.

262     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
way is to disable the list from the interface, make the changes to the list, and then reenable 
it on the interface.
Reflexive Access Lists
Reﬂexive ACLs, also called IP session ﬁltering, provide a way to prevent a class of security 
attacks by permitting each allowed TCP or UDP session on an individual basis. To do so, 
the router reacts when seeing the ﬁrst packet in a new session between two hosts. It reacts 
to the packet to add a permit statement to the ACL, allowing that session’s trafﬁc based on 
the source and destination IP address and TCP/UDP port.
Figure 6-9 shows a classic case in which traditional ACLs create a security hole, but 
reﬂexive ACLs could plug the hole. Most Enterprises want to allow users to use a web 
browser to connect to Internet-based web servers. A traditional extended ACL could permit 
the trafﬁc by allowing trafﬁc to and from any two IP addresses, but with the additional 
check on the TCP port used by HTTP (port 80). In this case, the ﬁgure shows an ACL that 
checks source port 80 for packets coming into the Enterprise, meaning that the packets 
came from a web server.
Figure 6-9
The Need for Reﬂexive ACLs
The ACL used on R2 ﬁlters all incoming trafﬁc except trafﬁc from web servers. This allows 
the Internet-based web server on the left to send packets to the user in the Enterprise on the 
right. However, it also allows the attacker to send packets, with source port 80, with the 
router allowing the packets through. Although these packets may not be part of an existing 
TCP connection, several known attacks can be made using these packets—from a simple 
DoS attack by ﬂooding packets into the Enterprise, to the leveraging of known bugs in the 
operating system.

Miscellaneous ACL Topics     263
Reﬂexive ACLs still allow legitimate users to send and receive packets through the router, 
while discarding the packets from other hosts, like packets from the attacker shown in 
Figure 6-9. With reﬂexive ACLs, when the Enterprise user ﬁrst creates a new session, the 
router notices the new session and records the source and destination IP addresses and ports 
used for that session. The reﬂexive ACL on R2 would not allow all port 80 trafﬁc in. Instead, 
it would allow only packets whose addresses and ports matched the original packet. For 
example, if the PC on the right started a session with the legitimate web server, source port 
1030, R2 would allow packets in from the Internet if they had the following characteristics: 
source IP address 64.100.2.2, destination IP address 128.107.1.1, source port 80, 
destination port 1030. As a result, only the packets from that legitimate session are allowed 
through the router, and the packets sent by the attacker are discarded.
Reﬂexive ACLs require some additional conﬁguration, as well as the use of named 
extended ACL conﬁguration.
Dynamic ACLs
Dynamic ACLs solve a different problem that also cannot be easily solved using traditional 
ACLs. Imagine a set of servers that need to be accessed by a small set of users. With ACLs, 
you can match the IP addresses of the hosts used by the users. However, if the user borrows 
another PC, or leases a new address using DHCP, or takes her laptop home, and so on, the 
legitimate user now has a different IP address. So a traditional ACL would have to be edited 
to support each new IP address. Over time, maintaining an ACL that checked for all these 
IP addresses would be painful. Additionally, it would introduce the possibility of security 
holes when other users’ hosts start using one of the old IP addresses.
Dynamic ACLs, also called Lock-and-Key Security, solve this problem by tying the ACL 
to a user authentication process. Instead of starting by trying to connect to the server, the 
users must be told to ﬁrst telnet to a router. The router asks for a username/password 
combination. If it is authentic, the router dynamically changes its ACL, permitting trafﬁc 
from the IP address of the host that just sent the authentication packets. After a period of 
inactivity, the router removes the dynamic entry in the ACL, closing the potential security 
hole. Figure 6-10 shows the idea.

264     Chapter 6: IP Access Control Lists
Figure 6-10
Dynamic ACLs
The process shown in the ﬁgure begins with the router denying all trafﬁc except Telnet. 
(Although the ﬁgure shows an ACL that allows telnetting to any IP address, in practice, the 
Telnet trafﬁc only needs to be allowed into a router IP address.) To trigger the process, the 
following steps occur:
Step 1 The user connects to the router using Telnet.
Step 2 The user supplies a username/password, which the router compares to a 
list, authenticating the user.
Step 3 After authentication, the router dynamically adds an entry to the 
beginning of the ACL, permitting trafﬁc sourced by the authenticated 
host.
Step 4 Packets sent by the permitted host go through the router to the server.
Time-Based ACLs
The term time-based ACL refers to a feature of normal IP ACLs (both numbered and 
named) in which a time constraint can be added to the conﬁguration commands. In some 
cases, it may be useful to match packets in an ACL, but only at certain times in the day, or 
even on particular days of the week. Time-based ACLs allow the addition of time 
constraints, with IOS keeping or removing the statements from the ACL during the 
appropriate times of day.

Troubleshooting IP Routing
This troubleshooting chapter has several goals. First, it explains several tools and functions 
not covered in Chapters 4 through 6—speciﬁcally, tools that can be very helpful when 
you’re analyzing problems. This chapter also reviews concepts from all three of the other 
chapters in Part II, “IP Routing.” It pulls together the concepts by showing a suggested 
process for troubleshooting routing problems, as well as examples of how to use the 
process. The second half of the chapter focuses on a series of troubleshooting tips for many 
of the speciﬁc topics covered in Chapters 4 through 6.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters, 
including some chapters in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. They 
also show you how to approach some of the more challenging questions on the CCNA 
exams. Therefore, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge 
level. For these reasons, the troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This 
Already?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly conﬁdent about troubleshooting IP 
routing features covered in this book and CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide, feel free to move to the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section near the end 
of this chapter to bypass the majority of the chapter.

270     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
Foundation Topics
This chapter focuses on troubleshooting the IP routing process. To that end, it begins with 
a section about two important troubleshooting tools: ping and traceroute. Following that, 
the chapter examines the IP routing process from a troubleshooting perspective, 
particularly focusing on how to isolate routing problems to identify the root cause of the 
problem. The ﬁnal section covers a wide variety of small topics, all of which can be useful 
when you’re troubleshooting IP routing problems.
The ping and traceroute Commands
This section examines a suggested process of troubleshooting IP routing—in other words, 
the data plane process of how hosts and routers forward IP packets. To that end, this section 
ﬁrst examines a set of useful tools and protocols—in particular, ICMP, ping, and 
traceroute. Following that, the text suggests a good general troubleshooting process for IP 
problems, with a few examples to show how to use the processes.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
TCP/IP includes ICMP, a protocol designed to help manage and control the operation of a 
TCP/IP network. The ICMP protocol provides a wide variety of information about a 
network’s health and operational status. Control Message is the most descriptive part of the 
name. ICMP helps control and manage IP’s work by deﬁning a set of messages and 
procedures about the operation of IP. Therefore, ICMP is considered part of TCP/IP’s 
network layer. Because ICMP helps control IP, it can provide useful troubleshooting 
information. In fact, the ICMP messages sit inside an IP packet, with no transport layer 
header, so ICMP is truly an extension of the TCP/IP network layer.
RFC 792 deﬁnes ICMP. The following excerpt from RFC 792 describes the protocol well:
Occasionally a gateway (router) or destination host will communicate with a 
source host, for example, to report an error in datagram processing. For such 
NOTE
This chapter, and Chapter 15 in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide, both explain details of how to troubleshoot the IP routing process. IP 
routing is vitally important on both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, as well as on the 
CCNA exam, so there is overlap between the exams, requiring some overlap in the books. 
However, this chapter covers many topics that go beyond the details required for the 
ICND1 exam. To be fully prepared, read this entire chapter, but feel free to skim portions 
if the chapter seems repetitive with the ICND1 book.

The ping and traceroute Commands     271
purposes, this protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), is 
used. ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher level protocol; 
however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP and must be implemented by 
every IP module.
ICMP deﬁnes several different types of messages to accomplish its varied tasks, as 
summarized in Table 7-1.
The ping Command and the ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply
The ping command uses the ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply messages. In fact, when 
people say they sent a ping packet, they really mean that they sent an ICMP Echo Request. 
These two messages are somewhat self-explanatory. The Echo Request simply means that 
the host to which it is addressed should reply to the packet. The Echo Reply is the ICMP 
message type that should be used in the reply. The Echo Request includes some data that 
can be speciﬁed by the ping command; whatever data is sent in the Echo Request is sent 
back in the Echo Reply.
The ping command itself supplies many creative ways to use Echo Requests and Replies. 
For instance, the ping command lets you specify the length as well as the source and 
destination addresses, and it also lets you set other ﬁelds in the IP header. Chapter 4, “IP 
Routing: Static and Connected Routes,” shows an example of the extended ping command 
that lists the various options.
The Destination Unreachable ICMP Message
This book focuses on IP. But if you take a broader view, the role of the entire set of TCP/IP 
protocols is to deliver data from the sending application to the receiving application. Hosts 
and routers send ICMP Destination Unreachable messages back to the sending host when 
that host or router cannot deliver the data completely to the application at the destination 
host.
Table 7-1
ICMP Message Types 
Message
Description
Destination Unreachable
Tells the source host that there is a problem delivering a packet.
Time Exceeded
The time that it takes a packet to be delivered has expired, so the 
packet has been discarded.
Redirect
The router sending this message has received a packet for which 
another router has a better route. The message tells the sender to use 
the better route.
Echo Request, Echo Reply
Used by the ping command to verify connectivity.

272     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
To aid in troubleshooting, the ICMP Unreachable message includes ﬁve separate 
unreachable functions (codes) that further identify the reason why the packet cannot be 
delivered. All ﬁve code types pertain directly to an IP, TCP, or UDP feature.
For example, the internetwork shown in Figure 7-1 can be used to better understand some 
of the Unreachable codes. Assume that Fred is trying to connect to the web server, called 
Web. (Web uses HTTP, which in turn uses TCP as the transport layer protocol.) Three of 
the ICMP unreachable codes can possibly be used by Routers A and B. The other two codes 
are used by the web server. These ICMP codes are sent to Fred as a result of the packet 
originally sent by Fred.
Figure 7-1
Sample Network for Discussing ICMP Unreachable Codes
Table 7-2 summarizes the more common ICMP unreachable codes. After the table, the text 
explains how each ICMP code might be needed for the network shown in Figure 7-1.

The ping and traceroute Commands     273
The following list explains each code in Table 7-2 in greater detail using the network in 
Figure 7-1 as an example:
■
Network unreachable: Router A uses this code if it does not have a route telling it 
where to forward the packet. In this case, Router A needs to route the packet to subnet 
10.1.2.0/24. If it cannot, Router A sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable 
message with the code “network unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 
10.1.2.14.
■
Host unreachable: This code implies that the single destination host is unavailable. If 
Router A has a route to 10.1.2.0/24, the packet is delivered to Router B. If Router B’s 
LAN interface is working, B also has a connected route to 10.1.2.0/24, so B tries to 
ARP and learn the web server’s MAC address. However, if the web server is down, 
Router B does not get an ARP reply from the web. Router B sends Fred the ICMP 
Destination Unreachable message with the code “host unreachable,” meaning that B 
has a route but cannot forward the packet directly to 10.1.2.14.
■
Can’t fragment: This code is the last of the three ICMP unreachable codes that a 
router might send. Fragmentation deﬁnes the process in which a router needs to 
forward a packet, but the outgoing interface allows only packets that are smaller than 
the packet. The router is allowed to fragment the packet into pieces, but the packet 
header can be set with the “Do Not Fragment” bit in the IP header. In this case, if 
Router A or B needs to fragment the packet, but the Do Not Fragment bit is set in the 
IP header, the router discards the packet and sends Fred an ICMP Destination 
Unreachable message with the code “can’t fragment.”
■
Protocol unreachable: If the packet successfully arrives at the web server, two other 
unreachable codes are possible. One implies that the protocol above IP, typically TCP 
or UDP, is not running on that host. This is highly unlikely, because most operating 
systems that use TCP/IP use a single software package that provides IP, TCP, and UDP 
functions. But if the host receives the IP packet and TCP or UDP is unavailable, the 
web server host sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable message with the code 
“protocol unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
■
Port unreachable: This ﬁnal code ﬁeld value is more likely today. If the server—the 
computer—is up and running, but the web server software is not running, the packet 
can get to the server but cannot be delivered to the web server software. In effect, the 
server is not listening on that application protocol’s well-known port. So, host 
10.1.2.14 sends Fred the ICMP Destination Unreachable message with the code “port 
unreachable” in response to Fred’s packet destined for 10.1.2.14.
NOTE
Most security policies today ﬁlter these various unreachable messages to help 
bolster the network’s security proﬁle.

274     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
The ping command lists various responses that in some cases imply that an unreachable 
message was received. Table 7-3 lists the various unreachable codes that may be displayed 
by the Cisco IOS Software ping command.
The Redirect ICMP Message
The ICMP Redirect message provides a means by which routers can tell hosts to use 
another router as default gateway for certain destination addresses. Most hosts use the 
concept of a default router IP address, sending packets destined for subnets to their default 
router. However, if multiple routers connect to the same subnet, a host’s default gateway 
may not be the best router on that subnet to which to forward packets sent to some 
destinations. The default gateway can recognize that a different router is a better option. 
Then it can send ICMP redirect messages to the host to tell it to send the packets for that 
destination address to this different router.
For example, in Figure 7-2, the PC uses Router B as its default router. However, Router A’s 
route to subnet 10.1.4.0 is a better route. (Assume the use of mask 255.255.255.0 in each 
subnet in Figure 7-2.) The PC sends a packet to Router B (Step 1 in Figure 7-2). Router B 
then forwards the packet based on its own routing table (Step 2); that route points through 
Router A, which has a better route. Finally, Router B sends the ICMP redirect message to 
the PC (Step 3), telling it to forward future packets destined for 10.1.4.0 to Router A 
instead. Ironically, the host can ignore the redirect and keep sending the packets to Router 
B, but in this example, the PC believes the redirect message, sending its next packet (Step 
4) directly to Router A.
The ICMP Time Exceeded Message
The ICMP Time Exceeded message notiﬁes a host when a packet it sent has been discarded 
because it was “out of time.” Packets are not actually timed, but to prevent them from being 
forwarded forever when there is a routing loop, each IP header uses a Time to Live (TTL) 
ﬁeld. Routers decrement the TTL by 1 every time they forward a packet; if a router

message can also help you when you troubleshoot a network. Hopefully, you do not get too 
many of these; otherwise, you have routing problems.
The traceroute Command
The ping command is a powerful troubleshooting tool that can be used to answer the 
question “Does the route from here to there work?” The traceroute command provides an 
arguably better troubleshooting tool because not only can it determine if the route works, 
but it can supply the IP address of each router in the route. If the route is not working, 
traceroute can identify the best places to start troubleshooting the problem.
The IOS traceroute command uses the Time Exceeded message and the IP TTL ﬁeld to 
identify each successive router in a route. The traceroute command sends a set of messages 
with increasing TTL values, starting with 1. The traceroute command expects these 
messages to be discarded when routers decrement the TTL to 0, returning Time Exceeded 
messages to the traceroute command. The source IP addresses of the Time Exceeded 
messages identify the routers that discarded the messages, which can then be displayed by 
the traceroute command.
To see how this command works, consider the ﬁrst set of packets (three packets by default) 
sent by the traceroute command. The packets are IP packets, with a UDP transport layer, 
and with the TTL set to 1. When the packets arrive at the next router, the router decrements 
the TTL to 0 in each packet, discards the packet, and sends a Time Exceeded message back 
to the host that sent the discarded packet. The traceroute command looks at the ﬁrst 
router’s source IP address in the received Time Exceeded packet.
Next, the traceroute command sends another set of three IP packets, this time with TTL = 
2. The ﬁrst router decrements TTL to 1 and forwards the packets, and the second router 
decrements the TTL to 0 and discards the packets. This second router sends Time Exceeded 
messages back to the router where the traceroute command was used, and the traceroute 
command now knows the second router in the route.
The traceroute command knows when the test packets arrive at the destination host 
because the host sends back an ICMP Port Unreachable message. The original packets sent 
by the IOS traceroute command use a destination UDP port number that is very unlikely 
to be used on the destination host, so as soon as the TTL is large enough to allow the packet 
to arrive at the destination host, the host notices that it does not have an application listening 
at that particular UDP port. So, the destination host returns a Port Unreachable message, 
which tells the traceroute command that the complete route has been found, and the 
command can stop.

The ping and traceroute Commands     277
Figure 7-4 shows an example, but with only one of the three messages at each TTL setting 
(to reduce clutter). Router A uses the traceroute command to try to ﬁnd the route to Barney. 
Example 7-1 shows this traceroute command on Router A, with debug messages from 
Router B, showing the three resulting Time Exceeded messages.

278     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
The traceroute command lists the IP address of Router B in the ﬁrst line and the IP address 
of the destination host in the second line. Note that it lists Router B’s left-side IP address. 
B replies with the Time Exceeded message, using B’s outgoing interface IP address as the 
source address in that packet. As a result, the traceroute command lists that IP address. If 
the address is known to a DNS server, or if it’s in Router A’s hostname table, the command 
can list the hostname instead of the IP address.
Similar to the extended ping command as described in the section titled, “The Extended 
ping Command” in Chapter 4, the extended version of the traceroute command does a 
much better job of simulating packets sent by end-user hosts, especially for testing reverse 
routes. For example, in Example 7-1, A’s traceroute command uses A’s 10.1.3.254 IP 
address as the source address of sent packets, because A uses the interface with address 
10.1.3.254 to send the packets generated by the traceroute command. So, the traceroute 
command in Example 7-1 tests the forward route toward 10.1.2.14 and the reverse route to 
10.1.3.254. By using the extended traceroute command, the command can be used to test 
a more appropriate reverse route, such as the route to the LAN subnet on the left side of 
Router A. Example 7-2, later in this chapter, shows an example of the extended traceroute 
command.
Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process
Troubleshooting the IP routing process is one of the more complex tasks faced by network 
engineers. As usual, using a structured approach can help. Chapter 4 in particular, as well 
as Chapters 5 and 6, have already explained a lot about the ﬁrst major part of the 
troubleshooting process—namely, what should happen in a network. This section focuses 
on the second major step: problem isolation. (For a more general reference on 
troubleshooting techniques, refer to Chapter 3, “Troubleshooting LAN Switching.”)
Isolating IP Routing Problems Related to Hosts
The troubleshooting process outlined in this chapter separates the troubleshooting steps—
one part for the hosts, and one part for the routers. Essentially, for any problem in which 
two hosts cannot communicate, the ﬁrst part of this troubleshooting process examines the 
NOTE
The tracert command on Microsoft operating systems works much like the IOS 
traceroute command. However, it is important to note that the Microsoft tracert 
command sends ICMP Echo Requests and does not use UDP. So, IP ACLs could cause 
the IOS traceroute to fail while the Microsoft tracert worked, and vice versa.
NOTE
This chapter defers any detailed troubleshooting of routing protocols until 
Chapter 11, “Troubleshooting Routing Protocols.”

Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process     279
issues that might impact each host’s ability to send packets to and from its respective default 
gateway. The second part isolates problems related to how routers forward packets.
The following list outlines the troubleshooting steps focused on testing the host’s 
connectivity to the ﬁrst router:
Step 1 Check the host’s ability to send packets inside its own subnet. Either ping the 
host’s default gateway IP address from the host, or ping the host’s IP address from 
the default gateway. If the ping fails, do the following:
a. Ensure that the router’s interface used at the default gateway is in an 
“up and up” state.
b. Check the source host’s IP address and mask setting as compared to 
the router’s interface used as the default gateway. Ensure that both 
agree as to the subnet number and mask, and therefore agree to the 
range of valid addresses in the subnet.
c. If the router uses VLAN trunking, solve any trunk conﬁguration 
issues, ensuring that the router is conﬁgured to support the same 
VLAN in which the host resides.
d. If the other steps do not lead to a solution, investigate Layer 1/2 
problems with the LAN, as covered in Chapter 3. For example, look 
for an undeﬁned VLAN.
Step 2 Verify the default gateway setting on the host by pinging one of the 
default router’s other interface IP addresses. Or, from the default router, 
use an extended ping of the host’s IP address with a source address from 
another of the router’s interfaces.
For example, in Figure 7-5, the problem symptoms may be that PC1 cannot browse the web 
server at PC4. To test PC1’s ability to send packets over its local subnet, PC1 could use the 
ping 10.1.1.1 command to test connectivity to the default router in its same subnet. Or the 
engineer could simply ping 10.1.1.10 from R1 (Step 1). Either location for the ping works 
ﬁne, because both ping locations require that a packet be sent in each direction. If the ping 
fails, further problem isolation should uncover the two speciﬁc problem areas listed in 
Steps 1A, 1B, and 1C. If not, the problem is likely to be some Layer 1 or 2 problem, as 
discussed in Chapter 3.

280     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
Figure 7-5
Sample Network for Troubleshooting Scenarios
Step 2 stresses an often-overlooked troubleshooting concept to verify that the default 
gateway setting is working. Neither ping option listed in Step 1 requires the host to use its 
default gateway setting, because the source and destination address in each packet are in the 
same subnet. Step 2 forces the host to send a packet to an IP address in another subnet, 
thereby testing the host’s default gateway setting. Also, by pinging an IP address on the 
default gateway (router), instead of some faraway host IP address, this step removes much 
of the IP routing complexity from the test. Instead, the focus is on whether the host’s default 
gateway setting works. For example, in Figure 7-5, a ping 10.1.13.1 command on PC1 
forces PC1 to use its default gateway setting because 10.1.13.1 is not in PC1’s subnet 
(10.1.1.0/24). But the IP address is on router R1, which removes most of the rest of the 
network as being a possible cause if the ping fails.
Isolating IP Routing Problems Related to Routers
When the host problem isolation process is complete, and the pings all work, on both the 
sending and receiving hosts, any remaining IP routing issues should be between the ﬁrst and 
last router in both the forward and reverse route between the two hosts. The following list 
picks up the troubleshooting process with the source host’s default gateway/router, relying 
on the traceroute command on the router. (Note that the host’s equivalent command, such 
as tracert on Microsoft operating systems, can also be used.)

Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process     281
Step 3 Test connectivity to the destination host by using the extended 
traceroute command on the host’s default gateway, using the router’s 
interface attached to the source host for the source IP address of the 
packets. If the command successfully completes:
a. No routing problems exist in the forward route or reverse route 
directions.
b. If the end-user trafﬁc still does not work (even though the traceroute 
worked), troubleshoot any ACLs on each interface on each router in 
the route, in both directions.
Step 4 If the traceroute command in Step 3 does not complete, test the forward 
route as follows:
a. telnet to the last traced router (the last router listed in the traceroute 
command).
b. Find that router’s route that matches the destination IP address that 
was used in the original traceroute command (show ip route, show 
ip route ip-address).
c. If no matching route is found, investigate why the expected route is 
missing. Typically it’s either a routing protocol issue or a static route 
misconﬁguration. It could also be related to a missing connected 
route.
d. If a matching route is found, and the route is a default route, conﬁrm 
that it will be used based on the setting for the ip classless/no ip 
classless commands.
e. If a matching route is found, ping the next-hop IP address listed in 
the route. Or, if the route is a connected route, ping the true 
destination IP address.
• If the ping fails, investigate Layer 2 problems between this router and the 
IP address that was pinged, and investigate possible ACL problems.
• If the ping works, investigate ACL issues.
NOTE
Although the following list may be useful for reference, it is rather long. Do not 
get bogged down in the details, but do read the examples of its use that follow this list; 
that should clarify many of the steps. As usual, you do not need to memorize any 
troubleshooting processes listed here. They are meant as learning tools to help you build 
your skills.

282     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
f.
If a matching route is found, and no other problems are found, 
conﬁrm that the route is not errantly pointing in the wrong direction.
Step 5 If Step 4 does not identify a problem in the forward route, test the reverse 
route:
a. If the forward route on the last traced router refers to another router 
as the next-hop router, repeat the substeps of Step 3 from that next-
hop router. Analyze the reverse route—the route to reach the source 
IP address used by the failed traceroute command.
b. If the forward route on the last traced router refers to a connected 
subnet, check the destination host’s IP settings. In particular, conﬁrm 
the settings for the IP address, mask, and default gateway.
For example, if PC1 cannot communicate with PC4 in Figure 7-5, and the hosts can both 
communicate through their respective default gateways, Step 3 of the router-oriented 
problem isolation process could start with a traceroute 172.16.2.7, using R1’s Fa0/0 IP 
address (10.1.1.1) as the source IP address. If that traceroute command lists 10.1.13.3 as 
the last IP address in the command output, rather than completing, you would then start 
Step 4, which examines R3’s forward route toward 172.16.2.7. If the analysis at Step 4 does 
not uncover the problem, Step 5 would then move on to the next-hop router, R4 in this case, 
and examine R4’s reverse route—its route back to the original source address of 10.1.1.1.
Next, two separate scenarios show how to use these troubleshooting steps to isolate some 
sample problems.
Troubleshooting Scenario 1: Forward Route Problem
This ﬁrst example of the router troubleshooting process uses the same internetwork shown 
in Figure 7-5. In this case, PC1 cannot use a web browser to connect to the web service 
running on PC4. After further investigation, PC1 cannot ping 172.16.2.7 (PC4). Example 
7-2 shows the commands used on R1 and R4 for the host-oriented Steps 1 and 2, as well as 
a beginning of the router-oriented Step 3.

Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process     283
The standard and extended pings on R1 at the beginning of the example essentially perform 
Steps 1 and 2, the host-oriented steps, to conﬁrm that PC1 seems to be working well. 
However, the example next shows that R4 cannot reach PC4 because R4’s LAN interface 
has been shut down, as shown at the end of the example. Although this scenario may seem 
a bit simple, it provides a good starting point for troubleshooting a problem.
To get a fuller view of the troubleshooting process, next consider this same scenario, with 
the same root problem, but now you do not have access to router R4. So, you can only 
perform Steps 1 and 2 for PC1, which work, but you cannot do those same steps for PC4 
from R4. So, Example 7-3 moves on to Steps 3 and 4. The beginning of the example shows 
Step 3, where R1 uses traceroute 172.16.2.7, with a source IP address of 10.1.1.1. This

by looking at how R3 then routes packets destined for 172.16.2.7.

identifying R3 (10.1.13.3) as the last listed device in the command output (Step 3). Step 4

Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process     285
then proceeds with an examination of the forward route on R3 toward IP address 
172.16.2.7. The show ip route 172.16.2.7 command gets right to the point. The message 
”subnet not in table“ means that R3 does not have a route matching destination address 
172.16.2.7. If the question does not supply access to a simulator, only the output of the 
show ip route command, you would need to examine the routes to determine that none of 
them refer to a range of addresses that includes 172.16.2.7.
Any time the problem isolation process points to a missing route, the next step is to 
determine how the router should have learned about the route. In this case, R3 should have 
used RIP-2 to learn the route. So, the next steps would be to troubleshoot any problems with 
the dynamic routing protocol.
The root cause of this problem has not changed—R4 has shut down its Fa0/0 interface—
but the symptoms are somewhat interesting. Because the interface is shut down, R4 does 
not advertise a route for subnet 172.16.2.0/24 to R3. However, R3 advertises an 
autosummarized route to network 172.16.0.0/16 to both R1 and R2, so both R1 and R2, 
because of RIP-2’s default autosummary setting, can forward packets destined for 
172.16.2.7 to R3. As a result, the traceroute command on R1 can forward packets to R3.
Troubleshooting Scenario 2: Reverse Route Problem
This next example uses the same network diagram as shown in Figure 7-5, with all the 
information shown in the ﬁgure still being true. However, the details mentioned in the 
previous section may have changed—particularly the problem that exists to make the 
example more interesting. So, approach this second problem only relying on the ﬁgure as 
being true.
In this scenario, PC1 again cannot ping 172.16.2.7 (PC4). The host default gateway checks 
suggested in Steps 1 and 2 again work for PC1, but the tests cannot be performed for the 
reverse direction, because the engineer cannot access PC4 or router R4. So, Example 7-4 
picks up the suggested troubleshooting process at Step 3, showing the result of the extended 
traceroute command on R1. Note that the command does not even list R3’s 10.1.13.3 IP 
address in this case. So, the rest of Example 7-4 shows the investigations into the speciﬁc 
substeps of Step 4.

The example starts by showing the Step 3 part of the process, with the traceroute command 
only listing lines of asterisks. This means that the command did not successfully identify 
even the very next router in the route.
Next, moving on to Step 4, the following list outlines the substeps of Step 4 as applied to 
this example:
Step 4a
The example had already begun with a Telnet into R1, so no extra work is 
required.
Step 4b
The next command, show ip route 172.16.2.7, shows that R1 has a 
nondefault route for network 172.16.0.0, pointing to R3 (10.1.13.3) as 
the next hop.
Step 4c
This step does not apply in this case, because a matching route was 
found in Step 4B.
Step 4d
This step does not apply in this case, because the matching route is not 
a route to 0.0.0.0/0 (the default route).
Step 4e
The next listed command, ping 10.1.13.3, tests R1’s ability to send 
packets over the link to the next-hop router identiﬁed in Step 4B. The 
ping works.

Troubleshooting Scenario 2: Steps 3 and 4 (Continued)

Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process     287
Step 4f
On both R1 and the next-hop router (R3), the show ip access-lists 
command conﬁrms that neither router has any IP ACLs conﬁgured.
Because all the steps to examine the forward route passed, the process then moves on to 
Step 5. The original traceroute command in Example 7-4 used R1’s Fa0/0 interface IP 
address, 10.1.1.1, as the source IP address. For Step 5, the process begins at R3 with an 
analysis of R3’s reverse route to reach 10.1.1.1. Examine the output in Example 7-5, and 
look for any problems before reading the explanations following the example.
R3 has an incorrectly conﬁgured static route for subnet 10.1.1.0/26. This subnet includes 
the address range 10.1.1.0–10.1.1.63, which includes IP address 10.1.1.1. When R3 
attempts to send a packet back to 10.1.1.1, R3 has two routes that match the destination 
address. But R3 picks the more speciﬁc (longer preﬁx) route for subnet 10.1.1.0/26. This 
route causes R3 to forward packets intended for 10.1.1.1 out R3’s link to R2, instead of to 
R1.

288     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
Although you cannot necessarily determine the true intent of this static route, this process 
has identiﬁed the root cause—the static route to 10.1.1.0/26 on R3. If the LAN off R1 
should include all addresses between 10.1.1.0 and 10.1.1.255, the static route should just 
be deleted.
An Alternative Problem Isolation Process for Steps 3, 4, and 5
The router-oriented steps of the IP routing problem isolation process depend on the 
traceroute command, relying on this command’s ability to identify on which router the 
router-oriented troubleshooting should begin. As an alternative, the ping and telnet 
commands can be used. However, because these commands cannot quickly identify the 
most likely routers on which the problem exists, using ping and telnet requires that you 
perform a set of tasks on the ﬁrst router (the host’s default gateway/router) in a route, and 
then the next router, and the next, and so on, until the problem is identiﬁed.
So, just to be complete, note that you can do the same speciﬁc subtasks as already explained 
in Steps 4 and 5, but when using ping, just repeat the steps at each successive router. For 
example, to apply this revised process to the ﬁrst of the two just-completed scenarios, the 
process would begin with router R1, PC1’s default router. In the ﬁrst scenario, R1 did not 
have any forward route issues for forwarding packets to 172.16.2.7 (PC4), and R1 had no 
reverse route issues and no ACLs. This new alternative process would then suggest moving 
on to the next router (R3). In this example, R3’s forward route problem—not having a route 
that matches destination address 172.16.2.7—would be found.
Troubleshooting Tools and Tips
The second half of this chapter covers a wide variety of troubleshooting tools and tips that 
can be helpful when you’re troubleshooting real networks. Some of the information in this 
section may apply directly to the CCNA exams. Other parts of this section will be indirectly 
useful for the exams. The information may help you learn as you work with networks in 
your job, making you better prepared for the unique scenarios on the exams.
Host Routing Tools and Perspectives
This section covers two short topics related to how hosts process IP packets. The ﬁrst topic 
lists several tips for troubleshooting hosts. The second topic reviews information covered 
in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide on how a LAN switch’s IP 
conﬁguration works like a host.
Host Troubleshooting Tips
When you’re trying to isolate the cause of networking problems, the tips in Table 7-4 may 
help you more quickly ﬁnd problems related to hosts. The tips are organized by typical 
symptoms, along with common root causes. Note that the table does not list all possible 
causes, just the more common ones.

Troubleshooting Tools and Tips     289
When troubleshooting networking problems in real life, it’s helpful to get used to thinking 
about the symptoms, because that’s where the problem isolation process typically begins. 
However, for the exams, most host communication problems are caused by just a handful 
of issues:
Step 1 Check all hosts and routers that should be in the same subnet to ensure that they 
all use the same mask and that their addresses are indeed all in the same subnet.
Step 2 Compare each host’s default gateway setting with the router’s 
conﬁguration to ensure that it is the right IP address.
Step 3 If the ﬁrst two items are correct, next look at Layer 1/2 issues, as covered 
in Chapters 1 through 3.
LAN Switch IP Support
Ethernet switches do not need to know anything about Layer 3 to perform their basic Layer 
2 function of forwarding Ethernet frames. However, to support several important features, 
such as the ability to telnet and SSH to the switch to troubleshoot problems, LAN switches 
need an IP address.
Switches act like hosts when it comes to IP conﬁguration. As compared to a PC, a Cisco 
switch does not use a NIC. Instead, it uses an internal virtual interface associated with 
VLAN 1 that essentially gives the switch itself an interface in VLAN 1. Then, the same 
kinds of items that can be conﬁgured on a host for IP can be conﬁgured on this VLAN 
interface: IP address, mask, and default gateway. DNS server IP addresses can also be 
conﬁgured.
Table 7-4
Common Host Problem Symptoms and Typical Reasons
Symptom
Common Root Cause
The host can send packets to hosts in 
the same subnet, but not to other 
subnets.
The host does not have a default gateway conﬁgured, or the 
default gateway IP address is incorrect.
The host can send packets to hosts in 
the same subnet, but not to other 
subnets.
The host’s default gateway is in a different subnet than the 
host’s IP address (according to the host’s perception of the 
subnet).
Some hosts in a subnet can 
communicate with hosts in other 
subnets, but others cannot.
This may be caused by the default gateway (router) using a 
different mask than the hosts. This may result in the router’s 
connected route not including some of the hosts on the LAN.
Some hosts on the same VLAN can 
send packets to each other, but 
others cannot.
The hosts may not be using the same mask.

290     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
The following list repeats the LAN switch IP conﬁguration checklist from CCENT/CCNA 
ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. Following the list, Example 7-6 shows the IP 
address conﬁguration for switch SW1 in Figure 7-5 from earlier in the chapter.
Step 1 Enter VLAN 1 conﬁguration mode using the interface vlan 1 global conﬁguration 
command (from any conﬁg mode).
Step 2 Assign an IP address and mask using the ip address ip-address mask 
interface subcommand.
Step 3 Enable the VLAN 1 interface using the no shutdown interface 
subcommand.
Step 4 Add the ip default-gateway ip-address global command to conﬁgure the 
default gateway.
A common oversight when conﬁguring or troubleshooting IP connectivity problems to 
LAN switches relates to VLAN trunking. Cisco generally suggests that you avoid putting 
end-user devices into VLAN 1, but the switch IP address may well be conﬁgured in VLAN 1. 
To support the ability for the switch to send and receive packets to hosts in different subnets, 
thereby supporting Telnet into the switch from those end-user subnets, the router’s trunking 
conﬁguration must include conﬁguration for VLAN 1 as well as the end-user VLANs.
show ip route Reference
The show ip route command plays a huge role in troubleshooting IP routing and IP routing 
protocol problems. Many chapters in this book and in the ICND1 book mention various 
facts about this command. This section pulls the concepts together in one place for easier 
reference and study.

NOTE
The VLAN interface on a switch stays in an administratively down state until 
the user issues the no shutdown command; the switch cannot send IP packets until the 
VLAN 1 interface is up.

The output of the command differs slightly when VLSM is used. The ﬁgure shows an 
example in which VLSM is not used in network 10.0.0.0, with mask /24 used for all subnets 
of that network. So, IOS lists the mask once, in the heading line (/24 in this case). If VLSM 
were in use, the heading line would simply note that the network is variably subnetted, and 
each route would list the mask. For an example, see Example 5-1 in Chapter 5, “VLSM and 
Route Summarization.”
Interface Status
One of the steps in the IP routing troubleshooting process described earlier, in the 
“Troubleshooting the Packet Forwarding Process” section, says to check the interface 
status, ensuring that the required interface is working. For a router interface to be working, 
the two interface status codes must both be listed as “up,” with engineers usually saying the 
interface is “up and up.”
This chapter does not explain the troubleshooting steps for router interfaces, simply 
assuming that each interface is indeed in an up/up state. Chapter 12’s section titled 
“Troubleshooting Serial Links” covers many of the details for troubleshooting router 
interfaces. For router LAN interfaces connected to a LAN switch, the main items to check 
on routers are that the router and switch match each other’s duplex and speed settings, and 
that if trunking is conﬁgured, both the router and switch have been manually conﬁgured for 
trunking, because routers do not dynamically negotiate LAN trunking.
VLSM Issues
This section examines several issues when using VLSM:
■
Recognizing whether VLSM is used and, if so, which routing protocols can be used
■
Understanding the conditions in which routers can allow the misconﬁguration of 
overlapping VLSM subnets
■
Understanding the outward symptoms that can occur when overlapping VLSM subnets 
exist
Recognizing When VLSM Is Used
One common oversight when troubleshooting a problem in an unfamiliar internetwork is 
failing to recognize whether VLSM is used. As deﬁned in Chapter 5, an internetwork uses 
VLSM when multiple subnet masks are used for different subnets of a single classful 
network. For example, if in one internetwork all subnets of network 10.0.0.0 use a 
255.255.240.0 mask, and all subnets of network 172.16.0.0 use a 255.255.255.0 mask, the 
design does not use VLSM. If multiple masks were used for subnets of network 10.0.0.0, 
VLSM would be in use.

Troubleshooting Tools and Tips     293
The follow-on concept is that only classless routing protocols (RIP-2, EIGRP, OSPF) can 
support VLSM; classful routing protocols (RIP-1, IGRP) cannot. So, a quick determination 
of whether VLSM is actually used can then tell you whether a classless routing protocol is 
required. Note that the routing protocol does not require any special conﬁguration to 
support VLSM. It is just a feature of the routing protocol.
Configuring Overlapping VLSM Subnets
IP subnetting rules require that the address ranges in the subnets used in an internetwork 
should not overlap. IOS can recognize when a new ip address command creates an 
overlapping subnet, but only in some cases. This section examines the conditions under 
which overlapping subnets can be conﬁgured, beginning with the following general 
statements about when the overlaps cannot and can be conﬁgured:
■
Preventing the overlap: IOS detects the overlap when the ip address command 
implies an overlap with another ip address command on the same router. If the 
interface being conﬁgured is up/up, IOS rejects the ip address command. If not, IOS 
accepts the ip address command, but IOS will never bring up the interface.
■
Allowing the overlap: IOS cannot detect an overlap when an ip address command 
overlaps with an ip address command on another router.
The router shown in Example 7-7 prevents the conﬁguration of an overlapping VLSM 
subnet. The example shows router R3 conﬁguring Fa0/0 with IP address 172.16.5.1/24, and 
Fa0/1 with 172.16.5.193/26. The ranges of addresses in each subnet are:
Subnet 172.16.5.0/24:
172.16.5.1–
172.16.5.254
Subnet 172.16.5.192/26:172.16.5.193–172.16.5.254

294     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
IOS knows that it is illegal to overlap the ranges of addresses implied by a subnet. In this 
case, because both subnets would be connected subnets, this single router knows that these 
two subnets should not coexist, because that would break subnetting rules, so IOS rejects 
the second command.
However, it is possible to conﬁgure overlapping subnets if they are connected to different 
routers. Figure 7-7 shows a ﬁgure very similar to Figure 5-2 in Chapter 5—used in that 
chapter to explain the problem of overlapping subnets. Example 7-8 shows the 
conﬁguration of the two overlapping subnets on R2 and R3, with the resulting routing table 
on R2.

Troubleshooting Tools and Tips     295
For the exams, keep in mind that overlapped subnets can be conﬁgured if the subnets do not 
connect to the same router. So, if a question asks you to pick a new subnet number and 
conﬁgure an interface to be in that subnet, the router’s acceptance of your ip address 
command does not necessarily tell you that you did the math correctly.
The next topic explains some of the problem symptoms you might see if such an overlap exists.
Symptoms with Overlapping Subnets
The outward problem symptoms differ depending on whether the address in question is in 
the overlapped portion of the subnets and if multiple hosts are attempting to use the exact 
same IP address. The addresses in the nonoverlapped parts of the subnet typically work ﬁne, 
whereas those in the overlapped area may or may not work at all. For example, continuing 
with the overlapped subnets shown in Figure 7-6, subnets 172.16.4.0/23 and 172.16.5.0/24 
overlap—speciﬁcally, addresses 172.16.5.0–172.16.5.255. Hosts in the nonoverlapped 
range of 172.16.4.0–172.16.4.255 probably work ﬁne.
For the addresses in the overlapped address range, in many cases, hosts in the smaller of the 
two overlapped subnets work ﬁne, but hosts in the larger of the two subnets do not. To see 
why, consider the case in which PC1 in Figure 7-7 tries to ping both 172.16.5.2 (PC2, off 
R2) and 172.16.5.3 (PC3, off R3). (For the sake of this example, assume that PC2’s and 
PC3’s IP addresses are not duplicated in the opposite overlapped subnet.) As you can see 
from the routing tables on R1 and R3 and the traceroute 172.16.5.2 command in Example 
7-9, the packet sent by PC1 to PC2 would actually be delivered from R1 to R3, and then 
onto R3’s LAN.
NOTE
Although this section is included for the sake of completeness, the types of 
problems described here may well be beyond the scope of the CCNA exams.

continues

296     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
The example shows that R1 forwards packets to hosts 172.16.5.2 (PC2) and 172.16.5.3 
(PC3) by sending them to R3 next. R3 then tries to send them onto R3’s LAN subnet, which 
works well for PC3 but not so well for PC2. So, PC3, in the smaller of the two overlapped 
subnets, works ﬁne, whereas PC2, in the larger of the two overlapped subnets, does not.
The symptoms can get even worse when addresses are duplicated. For example, imagine 
that PC22 has been added to R2’s LAN subnet, with IP address 172.16.5.3 duplicating 
PC3’s IP address. Now when the PC22 user calls to say that his PC cannot communicate 
with other devices, the network support person uses a ping 172.16.5.3 to test the problem—
and the ping works! The ping works to the wrong instance of 172.16.5.3, but it works. So, 
the symptoms may be particularly difﬁcult to track down.
Another difﬁcultly with overlapped VLSM subnets is that the problem may not show up for 
a while. In this same example, imagine that all addresses in both subnets were to be 
assigned by a DHCP server, beginning with the smallest IP addresses. For the ﬁrst six 
months, the server assigned only IP addresses that began with 172.16.4.x on the R2 LAN 
subnet. Finally, enough hosts were installed on the R2 LAN to require the use of addresses 
that begin with 172.16.5, like PC2’s address of 172.16.5.2 used in the preceding example.

Troubleshooting Tools and Tips     297
Unfortunately, no one can send packets to those hosts. At ﬁrst glance, the fact that the 
problem showed up long after the installation and conﬁguration were complete may 
actually cloud the issue.
VLSM Troubleshooting Summary
The following list summarizes the key troubleshooting points to consider when you’re 
troubleshooting potential VLSM problems on the exams:
■
Pay close attention to whether the design really uses VLSM. If it does, note whether a 
classless routing protocol is used.
■
Be aware that overlapping subnets can indeed be conﬁgured.
■
The outward problem symptoms may be that some hosts in a subnet work well, but 
others cannot send packets outside the local subnet.
■
Use the traceroute command to look for routes that direct packets to the wrong part 
of the network. This could be a result of the overlapped subnets.
■
On the exams, you might see a question you think is related to VLSM and IP addresses. 
In that case, the best plan of attack may well be to analyze the math for each subnet 
and ensure that no overlaps exist, rather than troubleshooting using ping and 
traceroute.
Discontiguous Networks and Autosummary
Chapter 5 explained the concept of discontiguous networks, along with the solution: using 
a classless routing protocol with autosummarization disabled. This section examines one 
particular case in which a discontiguous network exists only part of the time. Figure 7-8 
shows an internetwork with two classful networks: 10.0.0.0 and 172.16.0.0. The design 
shows two contiguous networks because a route consisting of only subnets of each network 
exists between all subnets of that network.

298     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
Figure 7-8
Internetwork with (Currently) Contiguous Networks
In this ﬁgure, with all links up and working, using a routing protocol with autosummary 
enabled by default, all hosts can ping all other hosts. In this design, packets for network 
172.16.0.0 ﬂow over the high route, and packets for network 10.0.0.0 ﬂow over the low route.
Unfortunately, a problem can occur later when one of the four links between routers fails. 
If any link between the routers fails, one of the two classful networks becomes 
discontiguous. For example, if the link between R3 and R4 fails, the route from R1 to R4 
passes through subnets of network 172.16.0.0, so network 10.0.0.0 is discontiguous. Even 
with a classless routing protocol, but with autosummarization enabled, both R1 and R4 
advertise a route for 10.0.0.0/8 to R2, and R2 sees two routes to all of network 10.0.0.0—
one through R1, and another through R4. The solution, as always, is to use a classless 
routing protocol with autosummary disabled.
Although the design in Figure 7-8 may seem a bit contrived, it happens more often than you 
might think—particularly as companies are bought and sold. Both for real life and the 
exams, keep the concept of discontiguous networks in mind for normal working cases and 
for cases in which redundant links fail.
Access List Troubleshooting Tips
Troubleshooting problems that are impacted by ACLs may well be one of the most difﬁcult 
tasks for real networking jobs. One of the major difﬁculties is that the traditional 
troubleshooting tools such as ping and traceroute do not send packets that look like the 
packets matched by the variety of ﬁelds in extended ACLs. So, although a ping may work, 
the end-user host may not be able to get to the right application, or vice versa.
This section summarizes some tips for attacking ACL-related problems in real life and on 
the exams:
Step 1 Determine on which interfaces ACLs are enabled, and in which direction (show 
running-conﬁg, show ip interfaces).
10.1.4.0/24
172.16.4.0/24
172.16.2.0/24

Troubleshooting Tools and Tips     299
Step 2 Determine which ACL statements are matched by test packets (show 
access-lists, show ip access-lists).
Step 3 Analyze the ACLs to predict which packets should match the ACL, 
focusing on the following points:
a. Remember that the ACL uses ﬁrst-match logic.
b. Consider using the (possibly) faster math described in Chapter 6, “IP 
Access Control Lists,” which converts ACL address/wildcard mask 
pairs into address/subnet mask pairs that allow the use of the same 
math as subnetting.
c. Note the direction of the packet in relation to the server (going to the 
server, coming from the server). Make sure that the packets have 
particular values as either the source IP address and port, or as the 
destination IP address and port, when processed by the ACL enabled 
for a particular direction (in or out).
d. Remember that the tcp and udp keywords must be used if the 
command needs to check the port numbers. (See Table 6-5 in Chapter 
6 for a list of popular TCP and UDP port numbers.)
e. Note that ICMP packets do not use UDP or TCP. ICMP is considered 
to be another protocol matchable with the icmp keyword (instead of 
ip, tcp, and udp).
f.
Instead of using the implicit deny any at the end of each ACL, use an 
explicit conﬁguration command to deny all trafﬁc at the end of the 
ACL so that the show command counters increment when that action 
is taken.
Chapter 6 covered the background information behind the tips listed in Step 3. The 
remainder of this section focuses on commands available for you to investigate problems 
in the ﬁrst two steps.
If a problem in forwarding IP packets is occurring, and existing ACLs may be impacting 
the problem, the ﬁrst problem isolation step is to ﬁnd the location and direction of the 
ACLs. The fastest way to do this is to look at the output of the show running-conﬁg 
command and to look for ip access-group commands under each interface. However, in 
some cases, enable mode access may not be allowed, and show commands are required. 
The only way to ﬁnd the interfaces and direction for any IP ACLs is the show ip interfaces 
command, as shown in Example 7-10.

300     Chapter 7: Troubleshooting IP Routing
Note that the command output lists whether an ACL is enabled, in both directions, and 
which ACL it is. The example shows an abbreviated version of the show ip interface 
S0/0/1 command, which lists messages for just this one interface. The show ip interface 
command would list the same messages for every interface in the router.
Step 2 then says that the contents of the ACL must be found. Again, the most expedient way 
to look at the ACL is to use the show running-conﬁg command. If enable mode is not 
allowed, the show access-lists and show ip access-lists commands give the same output. 
The only difference is that if other non-IP ACLs have been conﬁgured, the show access-
lists command lists the non-IP ACLs as well. The output provides the same details shown 
in the conﬁguration commands, as well as a counter for the number of packets matching 
each line in the ACL. Example 7-11 shows an example.
After the locations, directions, and conﬁguration details of the various ACLs have been 
discovered in Steps 1 and 2, the hard part begins—interpreting what the ACL really does. 
Of particular interest is the last item in the troubleshooting tips list, item 3E. In the ACL 
shown in Example 7-11, some packets (15 so far) have matched the single conﬁgured 
access-list statement in ACL 102. However, some packets have probably been denied 
because of the implied deny all packets logic at the end of an ACL. By conﬁguring the 
access-list 102 deny ip any any command at the end of the ACL, which explicitly matches 
all packets and discards them, the show ip access-lists command would then show the 
number of packets being denied at the end of the ACL. Cisco sometimes recommends 
adding the explicit deny all statement at the end of the ACL for easier troubleshooting.

Routing Protocol Theory
Part II, “IP Routing,” focused on the IP routing (packet forwarding) process, with some 
coverage of how routers ﬁll their routing tables. Part III, “Routing Protocols Conﬁguration 
and Troubleshooting,” which begins with this chapter, changes the focus to how routers ﬁll 
their routing tables by using dynamic routing protocols.
IP routing protocols work on a set of routers, sending messages to nearby routers to help 
those routers learn all the best routes to reach each subnet. Although this core goal is simple, 
the processes used by routing protocols tend to be some of the more complex and detailed 
topics on the CCNA exams. This chapter begins this book’s examination of IP routing 
protocols by explaining the fundamental concepts and theory behind how routing protocols 
work. Chapters 9 and 10 go on to provide much more detail about how OSPF and EIGRP 
work, respectively. Chapter 11 ends this part of the book by examining some 
troubleshooting processes and tips for OSPF and EIGRP.

Dynamic Routing Protocol Overview     309
Foundation Topics
Routing protocols deﬁne various ways that routers chat among themselves to determine the 
best routes to each destination. As networks grew more complex over time, routers gained 
both processing power and RAM. As a result, engineers designed newer routing protocols, 
taking advantage of faster links and faster routers, transforming routing protocols. This 
chapter follows that progression to some degree, starting with an introduction to routing 
protocols. Following that, the theory behind distance vector routing protocols, used with the 
earliest IP routing protocols, is explained. The ﬁnal section of this chapter examines the 
theory behind link-state routing protocols, which is used by some of the more recently 
deﬁned routing protocols.
Dynamic Routing Protocol Overview
Routers add IP routes to their routing tables using three methods: connected routes, static 
routes, and routes learned by using dynamic routing protocols. Before we get too far into 
the discussion, however, it is important to deﬁne a few related terms and clear up any 
misconceptions about the terms routing protocol, routed protocol, and routable protocol. 
The concepts behind these terms are not that difﬁcult, but because the terms are so similar, 
and because many documents pay poor attention to when each of these terms is used, they 
can be a bit confusing. These terms are generally deﬁned as follows:
■
Routing protocol: A set of messages, rules, and algorithms used by routers for the 
overall purpose of learning routes. This process includes the exchange and analysis of 
routing information. Each router chooses the best route to each subnet (path selection) 
and ﬁnally places those best routes in its IP routing table. Examples include RIP, 
EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.
■
Routed protocol and routable protocol: Both terms refer to a protocol that deﬁnes a 
packet structure and logical addressing, allowing routers to forward or route the 
packets. Routers forward, or route, packets deﬁned by routed and routable protocols. 
Examples include IP and IPX (a part of the Novell NetWare protocol model).
NOTE
If you are using the reading plan suggested in the Introduction, you should have 
already read about routing protocols in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. If so, you may want to skim the text from here to the heading ”IGP 
Comparisons: Summary,“ because the next several pages cover topics already covered in 
Chapter 14 of the ICND1 book.
NOTE
The term path selection sometimes refers to part of the job of a routing protocol, 
in which the routing protocol chooses the best route.

310     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
Even though routing protocols (such as RIP) are different from routed protocols (such as 
IP), they do work together very closely. The routing process forwards IP packets, but if a 
router does not have any routes in its IP routing table that match a packet’s destination 
address, the router discards the packet. Routers need routing protocols so that the routers 
can learn all the possible routes and add them to the routing table so that the routing process 
can forward (route) routable protocols such as IP.
Routing Protocol Functions
Cisco IOS software supports several IP routing protocols, performing the same general 
functions:
1.
Learn routing information about IP subnets from other neighboring routers.
2.
Advertise routing information about IP subnets to other neighboring routers.
3.
If more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based on 
a metric.
4.
If the network topology changes—for example, a link fails—react by advertising that 
some routes have failed, and pick a new currently best route. (This process is called 
convergence.)
Figure 8-1 shows an example of three of the four functions in the list. Both R1 and R3 learn 
about a route to subnet 172.16.3.0/24 from R2 (function 1). After R3 learns about the route 
to 172.16.3.0/24 from R2, R3 advertises that route to R1 (function 2). Then R1 must make 
a decision about the two routes it learned about for reaching subnet 172.16.3.0/24: one with 
metric 1 from R2, and one with metric 2 from R3. R1 chooses the lower metric route 
through R2 (function 3).
Convergence is the fourth routing protocol function listed here. The term convergence 
refers to a process that occurs when the topology changes—that is, when either a router or 
link fails or comes back up again. When something changes, the best routes available in the 
network may change. Convergence simply refers to the process by which all the routers 
collectively realize something has changed, advertise the information about the changes to 
all the other routers, and all the routers then choose the currently best routes for each subnet. 
The ability to converge quickly, without causing loops, is one of the most important 
considerations when choosing which IP routing protocol to use.
NOTE
A neighboring router connects to the same link (for example, the same WAN 
link or the same Ethernet LAN) as another router, with the two routers being neighbors.

Dynamic Routing Protocol Overview     311
Figure 8-1
Three of the Four Basic Functions of Routing Protocols
In Figure 8-1, convergence might occur if the link between R1 and R2 failed. In that case, 
R1 should stop using its old route for subnet 172.16.3.0/24 (directly through R2), instead 
sending packets to R3.
Interior and Exterior Routing Protocols
IP routing protocols fall into one of two major categories: Interior Gateway Protocols 
(IGP) or Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP). The deﬁnitions of each are as follows:
■
IGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use inside a single  
autonomous system (AS)
■
EGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use between different 
autonomous systems
These deﬁnitions use another new term: autonomous system (AS). An AS is an 
internetwork under the administrative control of a single organization. For instance, an 
internetwork created and paid for by a single company is probably a single AS, and an

The terms IGP and EGP include the word gateway because routers used to be 
called gateways.

internetwork created by a single school system is probably a single AS. Other examples 
include large divisions of a state or national government, where different government 
agencies may be able to build their own internetworks. Each ISP is also typically a single 
different AS.
Some routing protocols work best inside a single AS by design, so these routing protocols 
are called IGPs. Conversely, routing protocols designed to exchange routes between routers 
in different autonomous systems are called EGPs. (Currently, only one legitimate EGP 
exists: the Border Gateway Protocol [BGP]).
Each AS can be assigned a number called (unsurprisingly) an AS number (ASN). Like 
public IP addresses, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Network Numbers (ICANN, 
http://www.icann.org) controls the worldwide rights to assigning ASNs. It delegates that 
authority to other organizations around the world, typically to the same organizations that 
assign public IP addresses. For example, in North America, the American Registry for 
Internet Numbers (ARIN, http://www.arin.net/) assigns public IP address ranges and ASNs.
Figure 8-2 shows a small view of the worldwide Internet. The ﬁgure shows two Enterprises 
and three ISPs using IGPs (OSPF and EIGRP) inside their own networks, and with BGP 
being used between the ASNs.

Comparing IGPs
Today, there is no real choice of what EGP to use: you simply use BGP. However, when 
choosing an IGP to use inside a single organization, you have several choices. The most 
reasonable choices today are RIP-2, EIGRP, and OSPF. Of these three IGPs, RIP-2 has 
already been covered to some depth in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide, and this book covers OSPF and EIGRP in more depth in Chapters 9 and 10, 
respectively. This section introduces a few key comparison points between the various IP 
IGPs.
IGP Routing Protocol Algorithms
A routing protocol’s underlying algorithm determines how the routing protocol does its job. 
The term routing protocol algorithm simply refers to the logic and processes used by 
different routing protocols to solve the problem of learning all routes, choosing the best 
route to each subnet, and converging in reaction to changes in the internetwork. Three main 
branches of routing protocol algorithms exist for IGP routing protocols:
■
Distance vector (sometimes called Bellman-Ford after its creators)
■
Link-state
■
Balanced hybrid (sometimes called enhanced distance vector)
Historically speaking, distance vector protocols were invented ﬁrst, mainly in the early 
1980s. RIP was the ﬁrst popularly used IP distance vector protocol, with the Cisco-
proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later. By the 
early 1990s, distance vector protocols’ somewhat slow convergence and potential for 
routing loops drove the development of new alternative routing protocols that used new 
algorithms. Link-state protocols—in particular, OSPF and Integrated IS-IS—solved the 
main issues with distance vector protocols, but they required a fair amount more planning 
in medium- to larger-sized networks.
Around the same time as the introduction of OSPF, Cisco created a proprietary routing 
protocol called Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), which used some 
features of the earlier IGRP protocol. EIGRP solved the same problems as did link-state 
routing protocols, but less planning was required when implementing the network. As time 
went on, EIGRP was classiﬁed as a unique type of routing protocol—neither distance 
vector nor link state—so EIGRP is called either a balanced hybrid protocol or an advanced 
distance vector protocol.
The second and third major sections of this chapter examine distance vector and link-state 
algorithms in more detail. Chapter 10 explains balanced hybrid concepts in the context of 
the discussion of EIGRP.

314     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
Metrics
Routing protocols choose the best route to reach a subnet by choosing the route with the 
lowest metric. For example, RIP uses a counter of the number of routers (hops) between a 
router and the destination subnet. Table 8-2 lists the most important IP routing protocols for 
the CCNA exams and some details about the metric in each case.
Unlike RIP-1 and RIP-2, both the OSPF and EIGRP metrics are impacted by the various 
interface bandwidth settings. Figure 8-3 compares the impact of the metrics used by RIP 
and EIGRP.

As shown at the top of the ﬁgure, Router B’s RIP route to 10.1.1.0 points through Router A 
because that route has a lower hop count (1) than the route through Router C (2). However, 
in the lower half of the ﬁgure, Router B chooses the two-hop route through Router C when 
using EIGRP because the bandwidths of the two links in the route are much faster (better) 
than that of the single-hop route. Note that so that EIGRP would make the right choice, the 
engineer correctly conﬁgured the interface bandwidth to match the actual link speeds, 
thereby allowing EIGRP to choose the faster route. (The bandwidth interface 
subcommand does not change the actual physical speed of the interface. It just tells the IOS 
what speed to assume the interface is using.)

For convenient comparison and study, Table 8-3 summarizes many of the features 
supported by various IGPs. The table includes items speciﬁcally mentioned in this chapter 
or in earlier chapters in this book.

In addition to Table 8-3, Table 8-4 lists several other items about RIP-2, OSPF, and EIGRP. 
The items in Table 8-4 are explained more fully in Chapters 9 and 10, but they are included 
here for your reference when studying.
1This table specifically refers to features of RIP-2, but the only difference with RIP-1 in this table is that RIP-1 
broadcasts updates to IP address 255.255.255.255.
Administrative Distance
Many companies and organizations use a single routing protocol. However, in some cases, 
a company needs to use multiple routing protocols. For instance, if two companies connect 
their networks so that they can exchange information, they need to exchange some routing 
information. If one company uses RIP, and the other uses EIGRP, on at least one router, both 
RIP and EIGRP must be used. Then, that router can take routes learned by RIP and 
advertise them into EIGRP, and vice versa, through a process called route redistribution.
Depending on the network topology, the two routing protocols might learn routes to the 
same subnets. When a single routing protocol learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the 
metric tells it which route is best. However, when two different routing protocols learn 
routes to the same subnet, because each routing protocol’s metric is based on different 
information, IOS cannot compare the metrics. For instance, RIP might learn a route to 
subnet 10.1.1.0 with metric 1, and EIGRP might learn a route to 10.1.1.0 with metric 
2,195,416, but the EIGRP may be the better route—or it may not. There is simply no basis 
for comparison between the two metrics.
When IOS must choose between routes learned using different routing protocols, IOS uses 
a concept called administrative distance. Administrative distance is a number that denotes 
how believable an entire routing protocol is on a single router. The lower the number, the

better, or more believable, the routing protocol. For instance, RIP has a default 
administrative distance of 120, and EIGRP defaults to 90, making EIGRP more believable 
than RIP. So, when both routing protocols learn routes to the same subnet, the router adds 
only the EIGRP route to the routing table.
The administrative distance values are conﬁgured on a single router and are not exchanged 
with other routers. Table 8-5 lists the various sources of routing information, along with the 
default administrative distances.
The table shows the default administrative distance values, but IOS can be conﬁgured to 
change the administrative distance of a particular routing protocol, a particular route, or 
even a static route. For instance, the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 
10.1.130.253 deﬁnes a static route with a default administrative distance of 1, but the 
command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 210 deﬁnes the same static route 
with an administrative distance of 210.

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features
This section explains the basics of distance vector routing protocols, using RIP as an 
example. This section begins by examining the basic normal operations of distance vector 
protocols, followed by a thorough explanation of the many distance vector loop-avoidance 
features.
The Concept of a Distance and a Vector
The term distance vector describes what a router knows about each route. At the end of the 
process, when a router learns about a route to a subnet, all the router knows is some 
measurement of distance (the metric) and the next-hop router and outgoing interface to use 
for that route (a vector, or direction). To show you more exactly what a distance vector 
protocol does, Figure 8-4 shows a view of what a router learns with a distance vector 
routing protocol. The ﬁgure shows an internetwork in which R1 learns about three routes 
to reach subnet X:
■
The four-hop route through R2
■
The three-hop route through R5
■
The two-hop route through R7
Figure 8-4
Information Learned Using Distance Vector Protocols
R1 learns about the subnet, and a metric associated with that subnet, and nothing more. R1 
must then pick the best route to reach subnet X. In this case, it picks the two-hop route 
through R7, because that route has the lowest metric. To further appreciate the meaning of 
the term distance vector, consider Figure 8-5, which shows what R1 really knows about 
subnet X in Figure 8-4.

Figure 8-5
Graphical Representation of the Distance Vector Concept 
Effectively, all R1 knows about subnet X is three vectors. The length of the vectors 
represents the metric, which describes how good (or bad) each route is. The direction of the 
vector represents the next-hop router. So, with distance vector logic, routing protocols do 
not learn much about the network when they receive routing updates. All the routing 
protocols know is some concept of a vector: a vector’s length is the distance (metric) to 
reach a subnet, and a vector’s direction is through the neighbor that advertised the route.
Distance Vector Operation in a Stable Network
Distance vector routing protocols send periodic full routing updates. Figure 8-6 illustrates 
this concept in a simple internetwork with two routers, three LAN subnets, and one WAN 
subnet. The ﬁgure shows both routers’ full routing tables, listing all four routes, and the 
periodic full updates sent by each router.

320     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
To more fully understand distance vector operations in this ﬁgure, focus on some of the 
more important facts about what router R1 learns for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, which is the 
subnet connected to R2’s Fa0/1 interface:
1.
R2 considers itself to have a 0 hop route for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, so in the routing 
update sent by R2 (shown below the R2 router icon), R2 advertises a metric 1 (hop 
count 1) route.
2.
R1 receives the RIP update from R2, and because R1 has learned of no other possible 
routes to 172.30.22.0/24, this route must be R1’s best route to the subnet.
3.
R1 adds the subnet to its routing table, listing it as a RIP learned route.
4.
For the learned route, R1 uses an outgoing interface of S0/0, because R1 received R2’s 
routing update on R1’s S0/0 interface.
5.
For the learned route, R1 uses a next-hop router of 172.30.1.2, because R1 learned the 
route from a RIP update whose source IP address was 172.30.1.2.
At the end of this process, R1 has learned a new route. The rest of the RIP learned routes 
in this example follow the same process.
Besides the process of advertising and learning routes, Figure 8-6 also highlights a few 
other particularly important facts about distance vector protocols:
■
Periodic: The hourglass icons represent the fact that the updates repeat on a regular  
cycle. RIP uses a 30-second update interval by default.
■
Full updates: The routers send full updates every time instead of just sending new or 
changed routing information.
■
Full updates limited by split-horizon rules: The routing protocol omits some routes 
from the periodic full updates because of split-horizon rules. Split horizon is a loop-
avoidance feature that is covered in the next few pages.
Distance Vector Loop Prevention
As you can see, the actual distance vector process is pretty simple. Unfortunately, the 
simplicity of distance vector protocols introduced the possibility of routing loops. Routing 
loops occur when the routers forward packets such that the same single packet ends up back 
at the same routers repeatedly, wasting bandwidth and never delivering the packet. In 
production networks, the number of looping packets could congest the network to the point 
that the network becomes unusable, so routing loops must be avoided as much as possible. 
The rest of this chapter’s coverage of distance vector protocols is devoted to describing a 
variety of distance vector features that help prevent loops.

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features     321
Route Poisoning
When a route fails, distance vector routing protocols risk causing routing loops until every 
router in the internetwork believes and knows that the original route has failed. As a result, 
distance vector protocols need a way to speciﬁcally identify which routes have failed.
Distance vector protocols spread the bad news about a route failure by poisoning the route. 
Route poisoning refers to the practice of advertising a route, but with a special metric value 
called inﬁnity. Simply put, routers consider routes advertised with an inﬁnite metric to have 
failed. Note that each distance vector routing protocol uses the concept of an actual metric 
value that represents inﬁnity. RIP deﬁnes inﬁnity as 16.
Figure 8-7 shows an example of route poisoning with RIP, with R2’s Fa0/1 interface failing, 
meaning that R2’s route for 172.30.22.0/24 has failed.
Figure 8-7
Route Poisoning 
Figure 8-7 shows the following process:
1.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails.
2.
R2 removes its connected route for 172.30.22.0/24 from its routing table.
3.
R2 advertises 172.30.22.0 with an inﬁnite metric, which for RIP is metric 16.
4.
R1 keeps the route in its routing table, with an inﬁnite metric, until it removes the route 
from the routing table.
NOTE
Even though routes poisoned by RIP have a metric of 16, the show ip route 
command does not list the metric’s value. Instead, it lists the phrase “possibly down.”

322     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
Any metric value below inﬁnity can be used as a valid metric for a valid route. With RIP, 
that means that a 15-hop route would be a valid route. Some of the largest enterprise 
networks in the world have at most four or ﬁve routers in the longest route between any two 
subnets, so a valid maximum metric of 15 hops is enough.
Problem: Counting to Infinity over a Single Link
Distance vector routing protocols risk causing routing loops during the time between when 
the ﬁrst router realizes a route has failed until all the routers know that the route has failed. 
Without the loop-prevention mechanisms explained in this chapter, distance vector 
protocols can experience a problem called counting to inﬁnity. Certainly, routers could 
never literally count to inﬁnity, but they can count to their version of inﬁnity—for example, 
to 16 with RIP.
Counting to inﬁnity causes two related problems. Several of the distance vector loop-
prevention features focus on preventing these problems:
■
Packets may loop around the internetwork while the routers count to inﬁnity, with the 
bandwidth consumed by the looping packets crippling an internetwork.
■
The counting-to-inﬁnity process may take several minutes, meaning that the looping 
could cause users to believe that the network has failed.
When routers count to inﬁnity, they collectively keep changing their minds about the metric 
of a failed route. The metric grows slowly until it reaches inﬁnity, at which point the routers 
ﬁnally believe that the route has failed. The best way to understand this concept is to see an 
example; Figure 8-8 shows the beginnings of the counting-to-inﬁnity problem.

Poisoned Route

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features     323
The key to this example is to know that R1’s periodic update to R2 (left-to-right in Figure 8-8) 
occurs at almost the same instant as R2’s poison route advertisement to R1. Figure 8-8 shows 
the following process:
1.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails, so R2 removes its connected route for 172.30.22.0/24 from 
its routing table.
2.
R2 sends a poisoned route advertisement (metric 16 for RIP) to R1, but at about the 
same time, R1’s periodic update timer expires, so R1 sends its regular update, 
including an advertisement about 172.30.22.0, metric 2.
3.
R2 hears about the metric 2 route to reach 172.30.22.0 from R1. Because R2 no longer 
has a route for subnet 172.30.22.0, it adds the two-hop route to its routing table, next-
hop router R1.
4.
At about the same time as Step 3, R1 receives the update from R2, telling R1 that its 
former route to 172.30.22.0, through R2, has failed. As a result, R1 changes its routing 
table to list a metric of 16 for the route to 172.30.22.0.
At this point, R1 and R2 forward packets destined for 172.30.22.0/24 back and forth to each 
other. R2 has a route for 172.30.22.0/24, pointing to R1, and R1 has the reverse. The 
looping occurs until R1 and R2 both count to inﬁnity. Figure 8-9 shows the next step in their 
cooperative march toward inﬁnity.

1.
Both R1’s and R2’s update timers expire at about the same time. R1 advertises a poison 
(metric 16) route, and R2 advertises a metric 3 route. (Remember, RIP routers add 1 to 
the metric before advertising the route.)
2.
R2 receives R1’s update, so R2 changes its route for 172.30.22.0 to use a metric of 16.
3.
At about the same time as Step 2, R1 receives R2’s update, so R1 changes its route for 
172.30.22.0 to use a metric of 3.
The process continues through each periodic update cycle, with both routers eventually 
reaching metric 16. At that point, the routers could time out the routes and remove them 
from their routing tables.
Split Horizon
In the simple internetwork used in Figures 8-8 and 8-9, router R2 has a connected route to 
172.30.22.0, and R1 learns the route because of a routing update sent by R2. However, there 
is little need for R1 to advertise that same route back to R2, because R1 learned that route 
from R2 in the ﬁrst place. So, one way to prevent the counting-to-inﬁnity problem shown 
in these ﬁgures is to have R1 simply not advertise subnet 172.30.22.0, using a feature called 
split horizon. Split horizon is deﬁned as follows:
In routing updates sent out interface X, do not include routing information 
about routes that refer to interface X as the outgoing interface.
Distance vector protocols work a lot like how people in a neighborhood spread rumors. 
People tell their neighbors, who tell other neighbors, until eventually everyone in the 
neighborhood learns the latest gossip. Following that analogy, if you heard a rumor from 
your neighbor Fred, you wouldn’t turn around and tell him the same rumor. Likewise, split 
horizon means that when router R1 learns a route from router R2, R1 has no need to 
advertise that same route back to router R2.
Figure 8-10 shows the effect of split horizon on routers R1 and R2 in the same familiar 
internetwork. R1’s routing table (at the top of the ﬁgure) lists four routes, three of which 
have R1’s S0/0 interface as the outgoing interface. So, split horizon prevents R1 from 
including those three routes in the update sent by R1 out its S0/0 interface.

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features     325
Figure 8-10
Effects of Split Horizon Without Poison Reverse
Figure 8-10 shows the following process:
1.
R1 sends its normal periodic full update, which, because of split-horizon rules, 
includes only one route.
2.
R2 sends its normal periodic full update, which, because of split-horizon rules, 
includes only two routes.
3.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails.
4.
R2 removes its connected route for 172.30.22.0/24 from its routing table.
5.
R2 advertises 172.30.22.0 with an inﬁnite metric, which for RIP is metric 16.
6.
R1 temporarily keeps the route for 172.30.22.0 in its routing table, later removing the 
route from the routing table.
7.
In its next regular update, R1, because of split horizon, still does not advertise the route 
for 172.30.22.0.
Split horizon prevents the counting-to-inﬁnity problem shown in Figures 8-8 and 8-9 
because R1 does not advertise 172.30.22.0 to R2 at all. As a result, R2 never hears about an

interfaces.
Poison Reverse and Triggered Updates
Distance vector protocols can attack the counting-to-inﬁnity problem by ensuring that 
every router learns that the route has failed, through every means possible, as quickly as 
possible. The next two loop-prevention features do just that and are deﬁned as follows:
■
Triggered update: When a route fails, do not wait for the next periodic update.  
Instead, send an immediate triggered update listing the poisoned route.
■
Poison reverse: When learning of a failed route, suspend split-horizon rules for that 
route, and advertise a poisoned route.
Figure 8-11 shows an example of each of these features, with R2’s interface Fa0/1 failing 
yet again. Note that the ﬁgure begins with all interfaces working, and all routes known.

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features     327
The process shown in Figure 8-11 runs as follows:
1.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails.
2.
R2 immediately sends a triggered partial update with only the changed information—
in this case, a poison route for 172.30.22.0.
3.
R1 responds by changing its routing table and sending back an immediate (triggered) 
partial update, listing only 172.30.22.0 with an inﬁnite metric (metric 16). This is a 
poison reverse route.
4.
On R2’s next regular periodic update, R2 advertises all the typical routes, including the 
poison route for 172.30.22.0, for a time.
5.
On R1’s next regular periodic update, R1 advertises all the typical routes, plus the 
poison reverse route for 172.30.22.0, for a time.
In this example, R2 reacts immediately by sending the triggered update. R1 also reacts 
immediately, suspending split-horizon rules for the failed route to send a poison reverse 
route. In fact, R2’s poison route is not considered to be a poison reverse route, because R2 
was already advertising a route for 172.30.22.0. However, R1’s poison route is a poison 
reverse route because it was advertised back to the router from which R1 learned about the 
failed route. In fact, some books also refer to poison reverse as split horizon with poison 
reverse, because the router suspends the split-horizon rule for the failed route.
Problem: Counting to Infinity in a Redundant Network
Split horizon prevents the counting-to-inﬁnity problem from occurring between two 
routers. However, with redundant paths in an internetwork, which is true of most 
internetworks today, split horizon alone does not prevent the counting-to-inﬁnity problem. 
To see the problem, Figure 8-12 shows the new working network in its normal, stable, 
everything-working state. Figures 8-13 and 8-14 show in a moment how the counting-to-
inﬁnity problem occurs, even when split horizon is enabled.

Figure 8-12
Periodic Updates in a Stable Triangle Internetwork
Besides showing the normal operation of another network, Figure 8-12 provides a good 
example of how split horizon works. Again using subnet 172.30.22.0 as an example, the 
following process occurs in this internetwork:
1.
R2 advertises a metric 1 route in its updates to both R1 and R3.
2.
R1 then advertises a metric 2 route for 172.30.22.0 to R3, and R3 advertises a metric 
2 route for 172.30.22.0 to R2.
3.
Both R1 and R3 add the metric 1 route, learned directly from R2, to their routing tables, 
and ignore the two-hop routes they learn from each other. For example, R1 places route 
172.30.22.0, using outgoing interface S0/0, next-hop router 172.30.1.2 (R2), in its 
routing table.
Split horizon prevents R1 and R3 from advertising subnet 172.30.22.0 back to R2. Note that 
Figure 8-12 shows all the route advertisements for 172.30.22.0 in bold text. R1 and R3 do

not list 172.30.22.0 in their updates sent back to R2. In fact, all the routing updates shown 
in Figure 8-12 show the effects of split horizon.
Now that you have a good understanding of the internetwork shown in Figure 8-12, Figure 
8-13 shows the same internetwork, but with the beginning of the counting-to-inﬁnity 
problem, even though split horizon is enabled. Again, R2’s fa0/1 begins the example by 
failing.
Figure 8-13
Counting to Inﬁnity in a Redundant Internetwork
The process shown in Figure 8-13 is as follows. As usual, this example relies on some 
unfortunate timing of periodic routing updates around the time that the route fails.
1.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails.
2.
R2 immediately sends a triggered partial update, poisoning the route for 172.30.22.0. 
R2 sends the updates out all still-working interfaces.
3.
R3 receives R2’s triggered update that poisons the route for 172.30.22.0, so R3 updates 
its routing table to list metric 16 for this route.

4.
Before the update described in Step 2 arrives at R1, R1 sends its normal periodic 
update to R3, listing 172.30.22.0, metric 2, as normal. (Note that Figure 8-13 omits 
some of what would be in R1’s periodic update to reduce clutter.)
5.
R1 receives R2’s triggered update (described in Step 2) that poisons the route for 
172.30.22.0, so R1 updates its routing table to list metric 16 for this route.
6.
R3 receives the periodic update sent by R1 (described in Step 4), listing a metric 2 route 
for 172.30.22.0. As a result, R3 updates its routing table to list a metric 2 route, through 
R1 as the next-hop router, with outgoing interface S0/0.
At this point, R3 has an incorrect metric 2 route for 172.30.22.0, pointing back to R1. 
Depending on the timing of when the entries enter and leave the routing table, the routers 
may end up forwarding the packets sent to subnet 172.30.22.0/24 through the network, 
possibly looping some packets around the network several times, while the counting-to-
inﬁnity process continues.
The Holddown Process and Holddown Timer
The last loop-prevention feature covered in this chapter, a process called holddown, 
prevents the looping and counting-to-inﬁnity problem shown in Figure 8-13. Distance 
vector protocols use holddown to speciﬁcally prevent the loops created by the counting-to-
inﬁnity problems that occur in redundant internetworks. The term holddown gives a hint as 
to its meaning:
As soon as the route is considered to be down, hold it down for a while to give 
the routers time to make sure every router knows that the route has failed.
The holddown process tells a router to ignore new information about the failed route, for a 
time period called the holddown time, as counted using the holddown timer. The holddown 
process can be summarized as follows:
After hearing a poisoned route, start a holddown timer for that one route.  
Until the timer expires, do not believe any other routing information about the 
failed route, because believing that information may cause a routing loop. 
However, information learned from the neighbor that originally advertised the 
working route can be believed before the holddown timer expires.
The holddown concept may be better understood with an example. Figure 8-14 repeats the 
example of Figure 8-13, but with R3’s holddown process preventing the counting-to-
inﬁnity problem. The ﬁgure shows how R3 ignores any new information about subnet 
172.30.22.0 because of holddown. As usual, the ﬁgure begins with all interfaces up and 
working, and all routes known, and with Step 1 being the failure of the same interface off 
router R2.

Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features     331
Figure 8-14
Using Holddown to Prevent Counting to Inﬁnity
The process shown in Figure 8-14 is as follows, with Steps 3 and 6 differing from Figure 
8-13’s steps:
1.
R2’s Fa0/1 interface fails.
2.
R2 immediately sends a triggered partial update, poisoning the route for 172.30.22.0. 
R2 sends the updates out all still-working interfaces.
3.
R3 receives R2’s triggered update that poisons the route for 172.30.22.0, so R3 updates 
its routing table to list metric 16 for this route. R3 also puts the route for 172.30.22.0 
in holddown and starts the holddown timer for the route (the default is 180 seconds 
with RIP).
4.
Before the update described in Step 2 arrives at R1, R1 sends its normal periodic 
update to R3, listing 172.30.22.0, metric 2, as normal. (Note that Figure 8-14 omits 
some details in R1’s periodic update to reduce clutter.)
5.
R1 receives R2’s triggered update (described in Step 2) that poisons the route for 
172.30.22.0, so R1 updates its routing table to list metric 16 for this route.

6.
R3 receives the update from R1 (described in Step 4), listing a metric 2 route for 
172.30.22.0. Because R3 has placed this route in a holddown state, and this new metric 
2 route was learned from a different router (R1) than the original route (R2), R3 ignores 
the new routing information.
As a result of R3’s holddown logic described in Step 6, all three routers have a metric 16 
route for 172.30.22.0. At this point, any future routing updates will list only metric 16 
routes for this subnet—at least until a real route to the subnet becomes available again.
The deﬁnition of holddown allows the routers to believe the same router that originally 
advertised the route, even before the holddown timer expires. For example, the entire 
process of Figure 8-14 may occur within just a few seconds because of all the triggered 
updates. If R2’s Fa0/1 interface comes up again, R2 then advertises a metric 1 route for 
172.30.22.0 again. If R1 and R3 would believe R2’s advertisement, they could avoid 
waiting almost 3 more minutes for their holddown timers to expire for subnet 172.30.22.0. 
As it turns out, believing the routing update from the same router that originally advertised 
the route does not risk causing a loop. Therefore, holddown allows the routers (in this case 
R1 and R3) to believe R2’s advertisement.
Distance Vector Summary
Before closing the coverage of distance vector loop avoidance, it is useful to review the 
concepts covered here. This section covered a lot of theory, some of which can be a little 
tricky, but the main features can be summarized easily:
■
During periods of stability, routers send periodic full routing updates based on a short 
update timer (the RIP default is 30 seconds). The updates list all known routes except 
the routes omitted because of split-horizon rules.
■
When changes occur that cause a route to fail, the router that notices the failure reacts 
by immediately sending triggered partial updates, listing only the newly poisoned 
(failed) routes, with an inﬁnite metric.
■
Other routers that hear the poisoned route also send triggered partial updates, 
poisoning the failed route.
■
Routers suspend split-horizon rules for the failed route by sending a poison reverse 
route back toward the router from which the poisoned route was learned.
■
All routers place the route in holddown state and start a holddown timer for that route 
after learning that the route has failed. Each router ignores all new information about 
this route until the holddown timer expires, unless that information comes from the 
same router that originally advertised the good route to that subnet.

Link-State Routing Protocol Features     333
Link-State Routing Protocol Features
Like distance vector protocols, link-state protocols send routing updates to neighboring 
routers, which in turn send updates to their neighboring routers, and so on. At the end of the 
process, like distance vector protocols, routers that use link-state protocols add the best 
routes to their routing tables, based on metrics. However, beyond this level of explanation, 
these two types of routing protocol algorithms have little in common.
This section covers the most basic mechanics of how link-state protocols work, with the 
examples using Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), the ﬁrst link-state IP routing protocol, in 
the examples. The section begins by showing how link-state routing protocols ﬂood routing 
information throughout the internetwork. Then it describes how link-state protocols 
process the routing information to choose the best routes.
Building the Same LSDB on Every Router
Routers using link-state routing protocols need to collectively advertise practically every 
detail about the internetwork to all the other routers. At the end of the process, called 
ﬂooding, every router in the internetwork has the exact same information about the 
internetwork. Routers use this information, stored in RAM inside a data structure called the 
link-state database (LSDB), to perform the other major link-state process to calculate the 
currently best routes to each subnet. Flooding a lot of detailed information to every router 
sounds like a lot of work, and relative to distance vector routing protocols, it is.
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), the most popular link-state IP routing protocol, advertises 
information in routing update messages of various types, with the updates containing 
information called link-state advertisements (LSA). LSAs come in many forms, including 
the following two main types:
■
Router LSA: Includes a number to identify the router (router ID), the router’s 
interface IP addresses and masks, the state (up or down) of each interface, and the cost 
(metric) associated with the interface.
■
Link LSA: Identiﬁes each link (subnet) and the routers that are attached to that link. 
It also identiﬁes the link’s state (up or down).
Some routers must ﬁrst create the router and link LSAs, and then ﬂood the LSAs to all other 
routers. Each router creates a router LSA for itself and then ﬂoods that LSA to other routers 
in routing update messages. To ﬂood an LSA, a router sends the LSA to its neighbors. 
Those neighbors in turn forward the LSA to their neighbors, and so on, until all the routers 
have learned about the LSA. For the link LSAs, one router attached to a subnet also creates 
and ﬂoods a link LSA for each subnet. (Note that in some cases, a link LSA is not required, 

334     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
typically when only one router connects to the subnet.) At the end of the process, every 
router has every other router’s router LSA and a copy of all the link LSAs as well.
Figure 8-15 shows the general idea of the ﬂooding process, with R8 creating and ﬂooding 
its router LSA. Note that Figure 8-15 actually shows only a subset of the information in 
R8’s router LSA.
Figure 8-15
Flooding LSAs Using a Link-State Routing Protocol
Figure 8-15 shows the rather basic ﬂooding process, with R8 sending the original LSA for 
itself, and the other routers ﬂooding the LSA by forwarding it until every router has a copy. 
To prevent looping LSA advertisements, a router that knows about the LSA ﬁrst asks its 
neighbor if that neighbor already knows about this LSA. For example, R8 would begin by 
separately asking R4, R6, and R7 if they know about the router LSA for R8. Those three 
routers would reply, stating that they do not know about the R8 router LSA. Only at that 
point does R8 send the LSA to each of those neighboring routers. The process repeats with 
every neighbor. If a router has already learned the LSA—no matter over what path—it 
could politely say that it already has the LSA, thereby preventing the LSA from being 
advertised in loops around the network.
The origins of the term link state can be explained by considering the (partial) contents of 
the router LSA shown in Figure 8-15. The ﬁgure shows one of the four interface IP 
addresses that would be listed in R8’s router LSA, along with the interface’s state. Link-
state protocols get their name from the fact that the LSAs advertise each interface (link) and

Link-State Routing Protocol Features     335
whether the interface is up or down (state). So, the LSDB contains information about not 
only the up and working routers and interfaces and links (subnets), but all routers and 
interfaces and links (subnets), even if the interfaces are down.
After the LSA has been ﬂooded, even if the LSAs do not change, link-state protocols do 
require periodic reﬂooding of the LSAs, similar to the periodic updates sent by distance 
vector protocols. However, distance vector protocols typically use a short timer; for 
example, RIP sends periodic updates every 30 seconds and RIP sends a full update listing 
all normally advertised routes. OSPF reﬂoods each LSA based on each LSA’s separate 
aging timer (default 30 minutes). As a result, in a stable internetwork, link-state protocols 
actually use less network bandwidth to send routing information than do distance vector 
protocols. If an LSA changes, the router immediately ﬂoods the changed LSA. For 
example, if Figure 8-15’s Router R8’s LAN interface failed, R8 would need to reﬂood the 
R8 LSA, stating that the interface is now down.
Applying Dijkstra SPF Math to Find the Best Routes
The link-state ﬂooding process results in every router having an identical copy of the LSDB 
in memory, but the ﬂooding process alone does not cause a router to learn what routes to 
add to the IP routing table. Although incredibly detailed and useful, the information in the 
LSDB does not explicitly state each router’s best route to reach a destination. Link-state 
protocols must use another major part of the link-state algorithm to ﬁnd and add routes to 
the IP routing table—routes that list a subnet number and mask, an outgoing interface, and 
a next-hop router IP address. This process uses something called the Dijkstra Shortest Path 
First (SPF) algorithm.
The SPF algorithm can be compared to how humans think when taking a trip using a road 
map. Anyone can buy the same road map, so anyone can know all the information about the 
roads. However, when you look at the map, you ﬁrst ﬁnd your starting and ending locations, 
and then you analyze the map to ﬁnd the possible routes. If several routes look similar in 
length, you may decide to take a longer route if the roads are highways rather than country 
roads. Someone else may own the same map, but they might be starting from a different 
location, and going to a different location, so they may choose a totally different route.
In the analogy, the LSDB works like the map, and the SPF algorithm works like the person 
reading the map. The LSDB holds all the information about all the possible routers and 
links. The SPF algorithm deﬁnes how a router should process the LSDB, with each router 
considering itself to be the starting point for the route. Each router uses itself as the starting 
point because each router needs to put routes in its own routing table. The SPF algorithm 
calculates all the possible routes to reach a subnet, and the cumulative metric for each entire 
route, for each possible destination subnet. In short, each router must view itself as the 

336     Chapter 8: Routing Protocol Theory
starting point, and each subnet as the destination, and use the SPF algorithm to look at the 
LSDB road map to ﬁnd and pick the best route to each subnet.
Figure 8-16 shows a graphical view of the results of the SPF algorithm run by router R1 
when trying to ﬁnd the best route to reach subnet 172.16.3.0/24 (based on Figure 8-15). 
Figure 8-16 shows R1 at the top of the ﬁgure rather than on the left because SPF creates a 
mathematical tree. These trees are typically drawn with the base or root of the tree at the 
top of the ﬁgure, and the leaves (subnets) at the bottom.
Figure 8-16
SPF Tree to Find R1’s Route to 172.16.3.0/24 
Figure 8-16 does not show the SPF algorithm’s math (frankly, almost no one bothers 
looking at the math), but it does show a drawing of the kind of analysis done by the SPF 
algorithm on R1. Generally, each router runs the SPF process to ﬁnd all routes to each 
subnet, and then the SPF algorithm can pick the best route. To pick the best route, a router’s 
SPF algorithm adds the cost associated with each link between itself and the destination 
subnet, over each possible route. Figure 8-16 shows the costs associated with each route 
beside the links, with the dashed lines showing the three routes R1 ﬁnds between itself and 
subnet X (172.16.3.0/24).

Table 8-6 lists the three routes shown in Figure 8-16, with their cumulative costs, showing 
that R1’s best route to 172.16.3.0/24 starts by going through R5.
As a result of the SPF algorithm’s analysis of the LSDB, R1 adds a route to subnet 
172.16.3.0/24 to its routing table, with the next-hop router of R5.
Convergence with Link-State Protocols
As soon as the internetwork is stable, link-state protocols reﬂood each LSA on a regular 
basis. (OSPF defaults to 30 minutes.) However, when an LSA changes, link-state protocols 
react swiftly, converging the network and using the currently best routes as quickly as 
possible. For example, imagine that the link between R5 and R6 fails in the internetwork of 
Figures 8-15 and 8-16. The following list explains the process R1 uses to switch to a 
different route. (Similar steps would occur for changes to other routers and routes.)
1.
R5 and R6 ﬂood LSAs that state that their interfaces are now in a “down” state. (In a 
network of this size, the ﬂooding typically takes maybe a second or two.)
2.
All routers run the SPF algorithm again to see if any routes have changed. (This 
process may take another second in a network this size.)
3.
All routers replace routes, as needed, based on the results of SPF. (This takes 
practically no additional time after SPF has completed.) For example, R1 changes its 
route for subnet X (172.16.3.0/24) to use R2 as the next-hop router.
These steps allow the link-state routing protocol to converge quickly—much more quickly 
than distance vector routing protocols.
Summary and Comparisons to Distance Vector Protocols
Link-state routing protocols provide fast convergence, which is probably the most 
important feature of a routing protocol, with built-in loop avoidance. Link-state routing 
protocols do not need to use the large variety of loop-avoidance features used by distance 
vector protocols, which in itself greatly reduces the convergence time. The main features of 
a link-state routing protocol are as follows:

■
All routers learn the same detailed information about all routers and subnets in the  
internetwork.
■
The individual pieces of topology information are called LSAs. All LSAs are stored in 
RAM in a data structure called the link-state database (LSDB).
■
Routers ﬂood LSAs when 1) they are created, 2) on a regular (but long) time interval 
if the LSAs do not change over time, and 3) immediately when an LSA changes.
■
The LSDB does not contain routes, but it does contain information that can be 
processed by the Dijkstra SPF algorithm to ﬁnd a router’s best route to reach each 
subnet.
■
Each router runs the SPF algorithm, with the LSDB as input, resulting in the best 
(lowest-cost/lowest-metric) routes being added to the IP routing table.
■
Link-state protocols converge quickly by immediately reﬂooding changed LSAs and 
rerunning the SPF algorithm on each router.
One of the most important comparison points between different routing protocols is how 
fast the routing protocol converges. Certainly, link-state protocols converge much more 
quickly than distance vector protocols. The following list summarizes some of the key 
comparison points for different routing protocols, comparing the strengths of the 
underlying algorithms:
■
Convergence: Link-state protocols converge much more quickly.
■
CPU and RAM: Link-state protocols consume much more CPU and memory than 
distance vector protocols, although with proper design, this disadvantage can be 
reduced.
■
Avoiding routing loops: Link-state protocols inherently avoid loops, whereas distance 
vector protocols require many additional features (for example, split horizon).
■
Design effort: Distance vector protocols do not require much planning, whereas link-
state protocols require much more planning and design effort, particularly in larger 
networks.
■
Conﬁguration: Distance vector protocols typically require less conﬁguration, 
particularly when the link-state protocol requires the use of more-advanced features.

OSPF
Link-state routing protocols were originally developed mainly in the early to mid-1990s. 
The protocol designers assumed that link speeds, router CPUs, and router memory would 
continue to improve over time, so the protocols were designed to provide much more 
powerful features by taking advantage of these improvements. By sending more 
information, and requiring the routers to perform more processing, link-state protocols gain 
some important advantages over distance vector protocols—in particular, much faster 
convergence. The goal remains the same—adding the currently best routes to the routing 
table—but these protocols use different methods to ﬁnd and add those routes.
This chapter explains the most commonly used IP link-state routing protocol—Open 
Shortest Path First (OSPF). The other link-state protocol for IP, Integrated IS-IS, is mainly 
ignored on the CCNA exams.

OSPF Protocols and Operation     347
Foundation Topics
This chapter examines Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) concepts and conﬁguration, 
picking up where the link-state coverage in Chapter 8 ended. In particular, the ﬁrst half of 
this chapter explains a variety of the basics related to how OSPF works. The second half 
examines how to conﬁgure OSPF on Cisco routers.
OSPF Protocols and Operation
The OSPF protocol has a wide variety of sometimes-complex features. To aid the learning 
process, OSPF features can be broken into three major categories: neighbors, database 
exchange, and route calculation. OSPF routers ﬁrst form a neighbor relationship that 
provides a foundation for all continuing OSPF communications. After routers become 
neighbors, they exchange the contents of their respective LSDBs, through a process called 
database exchange. Finally, as soon as a router has topology information in its link-state 
database (LSDB), it uses the Dijkstra Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm to calculate the 
now-best routes and add those to the IP routing table.
Interestingly, the IOS show commands also support this same structure. IOS has an OSPF 
neighbor table (show ip ospf neighbor), an OSPF LSDB (show ip ospf database), and of 
course an IP routing table (show ip route). The processes explained in the ﬁrst half of this 
chapter can then be seen in action on routers by displaying the contents of these three tables.
OSPF Neighbors
Although some variations exist, a general deﬁnition of an OSPF neighbor is, from one 
router's perspective, another router that connects to the same data link with which the ﬁrst 
router can and should exchange routing information using OSPF. Although this deﬁnition 
is correct, you can better understand the true meaning of the OSPF neighbor concept by 
thinking about the purpose of OSPF neighbor relationships. First, neighbors check and 
verify basic OSPF settings before exchanging routing information—settings that must 
match for OSPF to work correctly. Second, the ongoing process of one router knowing 
when the neighbor is healthy, and when the connection to a neighbor has been lost, tells the 
router when it must recalculate the entries in the routing table to reconverge to a new set of 
routes. Additionally, the OSPF Hello process deﬁnes how neighbors can be dynamically 
discovered, which means that new routers can be added to a network without requiring 
every router to be reconﬁgured.
The OSPF Hello process by which new neighbor relationships are formed works somewhat 
like when you move to a new house and meet your various neighbors. When you see each 
other outside, you might walk over, say hello, and learn each others' names. After talking a 

348     Chapter 9: OSPF
bit, you form a ﬁrst impression, particularly as to whether you think you'll enjoy chatting 
with this neighbor occasionally, or whether you may just wave and not take the time to talk 
the next time you see him outside. Similarly, with OSPF, the process starts with messages 
called OSPF Hello messages. The Hellos in turn list each router's Router ID (RID), which 
serves as each router's unique name or identiﬁer for OSPF. Finally, OSPF does several 
checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers should 
become neighbors.
Identifying OSPF Routers with a Router ID
OSPF needs to uniquely identify each router for many reasons. First, neighbors need a way 
to know which router sent a particular OSPF message. Additionally, the OSPF LSDB lists 
a set of Link State Advertisements (LSA), some of which describe each router in the 
internetwork, so the LSDB needs a unique identiﬁer for each router. To that end, OSPF uses 
a concept called the OSPF router ID (RID).
OSPF RIDs are 32-bit numbers written in dotted decimal, so using an IP address is a 
convenient way to ﬁnd a default RID. Alternatively, the OSPF RID can be directly 
conﬁgured, as covered in the later section “Conﬁguring the OSPF Router ID.”
Meeting Neighbors by Saying Hello
As soon as a router has chosen its OSPF RID, and some interfaces come up, the router is 
ready to meet its OSPF neighbors. OSPF routers can become neighbors if they are 
connected to the same subnet (and in some other special cases not covered on the CCNA 
exams). To discover other OSPF-speaking routers, a router sends multicast OSPF Hello 
packets to each interface and hopes to receive OSPF Hello packets from other routers 
connected to those interfaces. Figure 9-1 outlines the basic concept.
Figure 9-1
Link-State Hello Packets
Routers A and B both send Hello messages onto the LAN. They continue to send Hellos 
based on their Hello Timer settings. Soon afterward, the two routers can begin exchanging 
topology information with each other. Then they run the Dijkstra algorithm to ﬁll the

routing table with the best routes. The Hello messages themselves have the following 
features:
■
The Hello message follows the IP packet header, with IP packet protocol type 89.
■
Hello packets are sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.5, a multicast IP address 
intended for all OSPF-speaking routers.
■
OSPF routers listen for packets sent to IP multicast address 224.0.0.5, in part hoping 
to receive Hello packets and learn about new neighbors.
Routers learn several important pieces of information from looking at the received Hello 
packets. The Hello message includes the sending router's RID, Area ID, Hello interval, dead 
interval, router priority, the RID of the designated router, the RID of the backup designated 
router, and a list of neighbors that the sending router already knows about on the subnet. 
(There's more to come on most of these items.)
The list of neighbors is particularly important to the Hello process. For example, when 
Router A receives a Hello from Router B, Router A needs to somehow tell Router B that 
Router A got the Hello. To do so, Router A adds Router B's RID to the list of OSPF 
neighbors inside the next (and future) Hello that Router A multicasts onto the network. 
Likewise, when Router B receives Router A's Hello, Router B's next (and ongoing) Hellos 
include Router A's RID in the list of neighbors.
As soon as a router sees its own RID in a received Hello, the router believes that two-way 
communication has been established with that neighbor. The two-way state for a neighbor 
is important, because at that point, more detailed information, such as LSAs, can be 
exchanged. Also, in some cases on LANs, neighbors might reach the two-way state and stop 
there. You'll read more about that in the section “Choosing a Designated Router.”
Potential Problems in Becoming a Neighbor
Interestingly, receiving a Hello from a router on the same subnet does not always result in 
two routers becoming neighbors. It's like meeting a new neighbor in real life. If you 
disagree about a lot of things, and you don't get along, you might not talk all that much. 
Similarly, with OSPF, routers on the same subnet must agree about several of the 
parameters exchanged in the Hello; otherwise, the routers simply do not become neighbors. 
Speciﬁcally, the following must match before a pair of routers become neighbors:
■
Subnet mask used on the subnet
■
Subnet number (as derived using the subnet mask and each router's interface IP 
address)
■
Hello interval

350     Chapter 9: OSPF
■
Dead interval
■
OSPF area ID
■
Must pass authentication checks (if used)
■
Value of the stub area ﬂag
If any one of these parameters differs, the routers do not become neighbors. In short, if 
you're troubleshooting OSPF when routers should be neighbors, and they are not, check this 
list!
A couple of the items in the list need further explanation. First, a potential neighbor 
conﬁrms that it is in the same subnet by comparing the neighboring router's IP address and 
subnet mask, as listed in the Hello message, with its own address and mask. If they are in 
the exact same subnet, with the same range of addresses, this check passes.
Next, two timer settings, the Hello Interval and Dead Interval, must match. OSPF routers 
send Hello messages every Hello Interval. When a router no longer hears a Hello from a 
neighbor for the time deﬁned by the Dead Interval, the router believes the neighbor is no 
longer reachable, and the router reacts and reconverges the network. For instance, on 
Ethernet interfaces, Cisco routers default to a Hello interval of 10 seconds and a dead 
interval of 4 times the Hello interval, or 40 seconds. If a router does not hear any Hello 
messages from that neighbor for 40 seconds, it marks the now-silent router as “down” in its 
neighbor table. At that point, the routers can react and converge to use the now-currently 
best routes.
Neighbor States
OSPF deﬁnes a large set of potential actions that two neighbors use to communicate with 
each other. To keep track of the process, OSPF routers set each neighbor to one of many 
OSPF neighbor states. An OSPF neighbor state is the router's perception of how much work 
has been completed in the normal processes done by two neighboring routers. For example, 
if Routers R1 and R2 connect to the same LAN and become neighbors, R1 lists a neighbor 
state for R2, which is R1's perception of what has happened between the two routers so far. 
Likewise, R2 lists a neighbor state for R1, representing R2's view of what has happened 
between R2 and R1 so far. (The most common command to list the neighbors and states is 
show ip ospf neighbor.)
NOTE
The stub area ﬂag relates to concepts outside the scope of the CCNA exams, but 
it is listed as a requirement for two routers to become neighbors just so the list will be 
complete.

OSPF Protocols and Operation     351
Because the neighbor states reﬂect various points in the normal OSPF processes used 
between two routers, it is useful to discuss neighbor states along with these processes and 
OSPF messages. Also, by understanding the OSPF neighbor states and their meanings, an 
engineer can more easily determine if an OSPF neighbor is working normally, or if a 
problem exists.
Figure 9-2 shows several of the neighbor states used by the early formation of a neighbor 
relationship. The ﬁgure shows the Hello messages and the resulting neighbor states.
Figure 9-2
Early Neighbor States
The ﬁrst two states, the Down state and the Init state, are relatively simple. In cases when 
a router previously knew about a neighbor, but the interface failed, the neighbor is listed as 
a Down state. As soon as the interface comes up, the two routers can send Hellos, 
transitioning that neighbor to an Init state. Init means that the neighbor relationship is being 
initialized.
A router changes from Init to a two-way state when two major facts are true: a received 
Hello lists that router's RID as having been seen, and that router has checked all parameters 
for the neighbor and they look good. These two facts mean that the router is willing to 
communicate with this neighbor. To make the process work, when each router receives a 
Hello from a new neighbor, the router checks the neighbor's conﬁguration details, as 
described earlier. If all looks good, the router's next Hello lists the neighbor's RID in the list 
of “seen” routers. After both routers have checked the parameters and sent a Hello listing 
the other router's RID as “seen,” both routers should have reached the two-way state.
For example, in Figure 9-2, R2 receives the ﬁrst Hello, which lists “Seen [null].” This 
notation means that R1 has not yet seen any approved potential neighbors. When R2 sends 
its Hello, R2 lists R1's RID, implying that R2 has seen R1's Hello and has veriﬁed that all 
parameters look good. R1 returns the favor in the third Hello, sent one Hello-interval later 
than R1's ﬁrst Hello.

352     Chapter 9: OSPF
After they are in a two-way state, the two routers are ready to exchange topology 
information, as covered in the next section.
OSPF Topology Database Exchange
OSPF routers exchange the contents of their LSDBs so that both neighbors have an exact 
copy of the same LSDB at the end of the database exchange process—a fundamental 
principle of how link-state routing protocols work. The process has many steps, with much 
more detail than is described here. This section begins by explaining an overview of the 
entire process, followed by a deeper look at each of the steps.
Overview of the OSPF Database Exchange Process
Interestingly, after two OSPF routers become neighbors and reach a two-way state, the next 
step may not be to exchange topology information. First, based on several factors, the 
routers must ﬁrst decide if they should directly exchange topology information, or if the two 
neighbors should learn each other's topology information, in the form of LSAs, indirectly. 
As soon as a pair of OSPF neighbors knows that they should share topology information 
directly, they exchange the topology data (LSAs). After this is completed, the process 
moves to a relatively quiet maintenance state in which the routers occasionally reﬂood the 
LSAs and watch for changes to the network.
The overall process ﬂows as follows, with each step explained in the following pages:
Step 1 Based on the OSPF interface type, the routers may or may not collectively elect a 
Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR).
Step 2 For each pair of routers that need to become fully adjacent, mutually 
exchange the contents of their respective LSDBs.
Step 3 When completed, the neighbors monitor for changes and periodically 
reﬂood LSAs while in the Full (fully adjacent) neighbor state.
Choosing a Designated Router
OSPF dictates that a subnet either should or should not use a Designated Router (DR) and 
Backup Designated Router (BDR) based on the OSPF interface type (also sometimes called 
the OSPF network type). Several OSPF interface types exist, but for the CCNA exams you 
should be aware of two main types: point-to-point and broadcast. (These types can be 
conﬁgured with the ip ospf network type command.) These OSPF interface types make a 
general reference to the type of data-link protocol used. As you might guess from the 
names, the point-to-point type is intended for use on point-to-point links, and the broadcast 
type is for use on data links that support broadcast frames, such as LANs.
Figure 9-3 shows a classic example of two sets of neighbors—one using the default OSPF 
interface type of point-to-point on a serial link, and the other using the default OSPF 

OSPF Protocols and Operation     353
interface type of broadcast on a LAN. The end result of the DR election is that topology 
information is exchanged only between neighbors shown with arrowed lines in the ﬁgure. 
Focus on the lower-right part of the ﬁgure.
Figure 9-3
No DR on a Point-to-Point Link, with a DR on the LAN
When a DR is not required, neighboring routers can go ahead and start the topology 
exchange process, as shown on the left side of the ﬁgure. In OSPF terminology, the two 
routers on the left should continue working to exchange topology information and become 
fully adjacent. On the right side of the ﬁgure, the top part shows a LAN topology where a 
DR election has been held, with Router A winning the election. With a DR, the topology 
exchange process happens between the DR and every other router, but not between every 
pair of routers. As a result, all routing updates ﬂow to and from Router A, with Router A 
essentially distributing the topology information to the other routers. All routers learn all 
topology information from all other routers, but the process only causes a direct exchange 
of routing information between the DR and each of the non-DR routers.
The DR concept prevents overloading a subnet with too much OSPF trafﬁc when many 
routers are on a subnet. Of course, lots of routers could be attached to one LAN, which is 
why a DR is required for routers attached to a LAN. For instance, if ten routers were 
attached to the same LAN subnet, and they were allowed to forward OSPF updates to each 
of the other nine routers, topology updates would ﬂow between 45 different pairs of 
neighbors—with almost all the information being redundant. With the DR concept, as 
shown on the right side of Figure 9-3, that same LAN would require routing updates only 
between the DR and the nine other routers, signiﬁcantly reducing the ﬂooding of OSPF 
information across the LAN.

354     Chapter 9: OSPF
Because the DR is so important to the exchange of routing information, the loss of the 
elected DR could cause delays in convergence. OSPF includes the concept of a Backup DR 
(BDR) on each subnet, so when the DR fails or loses connectivity to the subnet, the BDR 
can take over as the DR. (All routers except the DR and BDR are typically called 
“DROther” in IOS show command output.)
When a DR is required, the neighboring routers hold an election. To elect a DR, the 
neighboring routers look at two ﬁelds inside the Hello packets they receive and choose the 
DR based on the following criteria:
■
The router sending the Hello with the highest OSPF priority setting becomes the DR.
■
If two or more routers tie with the highest priority setting, the router sending the Hello 
with the highest RID wins.
■
It's not always the case, but typically the router with the second-highest priority 
becomes the BDR.
■
A priority setting of 0 means that the router does not participate in the election and can 
never become the DR or BDR.
■
The range of priority values that allow a router to be a candidate are 1 through 255.
■
If a new, better candidate comes along after the DR and BDR have been elected, the 
new candidate does not preempt the existing DR and BDR.
Database Exchange
The database exchange process can be quite involved with several OSPF messages. The 
details of the process can be ignored for the purposes of this book, but a brief overview can 
help give some perspective on the overall process.
After two routers decide to exchange databases, they do not simply send the contents of the 
entire database. First, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not 
all the details of the LSAs, just a list. Each router then compares the other router's list to its 
own LSDB. For any LSAs that a router does not have a copy of, the router asks the neighbor 
for a copy of the LSA, and the neighbor sends the full LSA.
When two neighbors complete this process, they are considered to have fully completed the 
database exchange process. So OSPF uses the Full neighbor state to mean that the database 
exchange process has been completed.
NOTE
All non-DR and non-BDR routers attempt to become fully adjacent with both 
the DR and BDR, but Figure 9-3 shows only the relationships with the DR to reduce 
clutter.

OSPF Protocols and Operation     355
Maintaining the LSDB While Being Fully Adjacent
Neighbors in a Full state still do some maintenance work. They keep sending Hellos every 
Hello interval. The absence of Hellos for a time equal to the Dead Interval means that the 
connection to the neighbor has failed. Also, if any topology changes occur, the neighbors 
send new copies of the changed LSAs to each neighbor so that the neighbor can change its 
LSDBs. For example, if a subnet fails, a router updates the LSA for that subnet to reﬂect its 
state as being down. That router then sends the LSA to its neighbors, and they in turn send 
it to their neighbors, until all routers again have an identical copy of the LSDB. Each router 
can then also use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed subnet.
The router that creates each LSA also has the responsibility to reﬂood the LSA every 30 
minutes (the default), even if no changes occur. This process is quite different than the 
distance vector concept of periodic updates. Distance vector protocols send full updates 
over a short time interval, listing all routes (except those omitted due to loop-avoidance 
tools such as split horizon). OSPF does not send all routes every 30 minutes. Instead, each 
LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created. So, there is no single 
moment when OSPF sends a lot of messages to reﬂood all LSAs. Instead, each LSA is 
reﬂooded by the router that created the LSA, every 30 minutes.
As a reminder, some routers do not attempt to become fully adjacent. In particular, on 
interfaces on which a DR is elected, routers that are neither DR nor BDR become 
neighbors, but they do not become fully adjacent. These non-fully adjacent routers do not 
directly exchange LSAs. Also, the show ip ospf neighbor command on such a router lists 
these neighbors in a two-way state as the normal stable neighbor state, and Full as the 
normal stable state for the DR and BDR.

A known neighbor is no longer reachable, often because of an underlying 
interface failure.
Init
An interim state in which a Hello has been heard from the neighbor, but that 
Hello does not list the router's RID as having been seen yet.
Two-way
The neighbor has sent a Hello that lists the local router's RID in the list of seen 
routers, also implying that neighbor veriﬁcation checks all passed.
Full
Both routers know the exact same LSDB details and are fully adjacent.

356     Chapter 9: OSPF
Building the IP Routing Table
OSPF routers send messages to learn about neighbors, listing those neighbors in the OSPF 
neighbor table. OSPF routers then send messages to exchange topology data with these 
same neighbors, storing the information in the OSPF topology table, more commonly 
called the LSDB or the OSPF database. To ﬁll the third major table used by OSPF, the IP 
routing table, OSPF does not send any messages. Each router runs the Dijkstra SPF 
algorithm against the OSPF topology database, choosing the best routes based on that 
process.
The OSPF topology database consists of lists of subnet numbers (called links, hence the 
name link-state database). It also contains lists of routers, along with the links (subnets) to 
which each router is connected. Armed with the knowledge of links and routers, a router 
can run the SPF algorithm to compute the best routes to all the subnets. The concept is very 
much like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. The color and shape of each piece help you 
identify what pieces might ﬁt next to it. Similarly, the detailed information in each LSA—
things such as a link LSA listing the routers attached to the subnet, and a router LSA listing 
its IP addresses and masks—gives the SPF algorithm enough information to ﬁgure out 
which routers connect to each subnet and create the mathematical equivalent of a network 
diagram.
Each router independently uses the Dijkstra SPF algorithm, as applied to the OSPF LSDB, 
to ﬁnd the best route from that router to each subnet. The algorithm ﬁnds the shortest path 
from that router to each subnet in the LSDB. Then the router places the best route to each 
subnet in the IP routing table. It sounds simple, and it is with a drawing of an internetwork 
that lists all the information. Fortunately, although the underlying math of the SPF 
algorithm can be a bit daunting, you do not need to know SPF math for the exams or for 
real networking jobs. However, you do need to be able to predict the routes SPF will choose 
using network diagrams and documentation.
OSPF chooses the least-cost route between the router and a subnet by adding up the 
outgoing interfaces' OSPF costs. Each interface has an OSPF cost associated with it. The 
router looks at each possible route, adds up the costs on the interfaces out which packets 
would be forwarded on that route, and then picks the least-cost route. For example, Figure 
9-4 shows a simple internetwork with the OSPF cost values listed beside each interface. In 
this ﬁgure, router R4 has two possible paths with which to reach subnet 10.1.5.0/24. The 
two routes are as follows, listing each router and its outgoing interface:
R4 Fa0/0—R1 S0/1—R5 Fa0/0
R4 Fa0/0—R2 S0/1—R5 Fa0/0

OSPF Protocols and Operation     357
Figure 9-4
Sample OSPF Network with Costs Shown
If you add up the cost associated with each interface, the ﬁrst of the two routes totals a cost 
of 111, and the second totals 75. So, R4 adds the route through R1 as the best route and lists 
R1's IP address as the next-hop IP address.
Now that you have seen how OSPF routers perform the most fundamental functions of 
OSPF, the next section takes a broader look at OSPF, particularly some important design 
points.
Scaling OSPF Through Hierarchical Design
OSPF can be used in some networks with very little thought about design issues. You just 
turn on OSPF in all the routers, and it works! However, in large networks, engineers need 
to think about and plan how to use several OSPF features that allow it to scale well in larger 
networks. To appreciate the issues behind OSPF scalability, and the need for good design 
to allow scalability, examine Figure 9-5.

358     Chapter 9: OSPF
In the network shown in Figure 9-5, the topology database on all nine routers is the same 
full topology that matches the ﬁgure. With a network that size, you can just enable OSPF, 
and it works ﬁne. But imagine a network with 900 routers instead of only nine, and several 
thousand subnets. In that size of network, the sheer amount of processing required to run 
the complex SPF algorithm might cause convergence time to be slow, and the routers might 
experience memory shortages. The problems can be summarized as follows:
■
A larger topology database requires more memory on each router.
■
Processing the larger-topology database with the SPF algorithm requires processing 
power that grows exponentially with the size of the topology database.
■
A single interface status change (up to down or down to up) forces every router to run 
SPF again!
Although there is no exact deﬁnition of “large” in this context, in networks with at least 50 
routers and at least a few hundred subnets, engineers should use OSPF scalability features 
to reduce the problems just described. These numbers are gross generalizations. They 
depend largely on the network design, the power of the router CPU, the amount of RAM, 
and so on.
OSPF Areas
Using OSPF areas solves many, but not all, of the most common problems with running 
OSPF in larger networks. OSPF areas break up the network so that routers in one area know 
less topology information about the subnets in the other area—and they do not know about 
the routers in the other area at all. With smaller-topology databases, routers consume less 
memory and take less processing time to run SPF. Figure 9-6 shows the same network as 
Figure 9-5, but with two OSPF areas, labeled Area 1 and Area 0.
The same topology is shown in the upper part of the ﬁgure, but the lower part of the ﬁgure 
shows the topology database on Routers 1, 2, and 4. By placing part of the network in 
another area, the routers inside Area 1 are shielded from some of the details. Router 3 is 
known as an OSPF Area Border Router (ABR), because it is on the border between two 
different areas. Router 3 does not advertise full topology information about the part of the 
network in Area 0 to Routers 1, 2, and 4. Instead, Router 3 advertises summary information 
about the subnets in Area 0, effectively making Routers 1, 2, and 4 think the topology looks 
like the lower part of Figure 9-6. Therefore, Routers 1, 2, and 4 view the world as if it has 
fewer routers. As a result, the SPF algorithm takes less time, and the topology database 
takes less memory.

360     Chapter 9: OSPF
It is very important to note the difference between the summarized information shown in 
Figure 9-6 versus summarized routes as covered in Chapter 5, “VLSM and Route 
Summarization.” In this case, the term “summary” just means that a router inside one area 
receives briefer information in the LSA for a subnet, thereby decreasing the amount of 
memory needed to store the information. For example, in Figure 9-6, router R1 (in Area 1) 
learns only a very brief LSA about subnets in Area 0. This process reduces the size and 
complexity of the SPF algorithm. In addition, the term “summary” can refer to a summary 
route conﬁgured in OSPF, with the general concepts covered in Chapter 5. OSPF manual 
route summarization reduces the number of subnets, which in turn also reduces the size and 
effort of the SPF calculation.
Notice that the dividing line between areas is not a link, but a router. In Figure 9-6, Router 
3 is in both Area 1 and Area 0. OSPF uses the term Area Border Router (ABR) to describe 
a router that sits in both areas. An ABR has the topology database for both areas and runs 
SPF when links change status in either area. So, although using areas helps scale OSPF by 
reducing the size of the LSDB and the time to compute a routing table, the amount of RAM 
and CPU consumed on ABRs can actually increase. As a result, the routers acting as ABRs 
should be faster routers with relatively more memory.
OSPF Area Design Advantages
Using areas improves OSPF operations in many ways, particularly in larger internetworks:
■
The smaller per-area LSDB requires less memory.
■
The router requires fewer CPU cycles to process the smaller per-area LSDB with the 
SPF algorithm, reducing CPU overhead and improving convergence time.
Term
Description
External route
A route learned from outside the OSPF domain and then advertised 
into the OSPF domain.
Intra-area route
A route to a subnet inside the same area as the router.
Interarea route
A route to a subnet in an area of which the router is not a part.
Autonomous system
In OSPF, a reference to a set of routers that use OSPF.
NOTE
Although the perspectives of the routers in Area 1 are shown in Figure 9-6, the 
same thing happens in reverse—routers in Area 0 do not know the details of Area 1's 
topology.

OSPF Design Terminology (Continued)

OSPF Configuration     361
■
The SPF algorithm has to be run on internal routers only when an LSA inside the area 
changes, so routers have to run SPF less often.
■
Less information must be advertised between areas, reducing the bandwidth required 
to send LSAs.
■
Manual summarization can only be conﬁgured on ABRs and ASBRs, so areas allow 
for smaller IP routing tables by allowing for the conﬁguration of manual route 
summarization.
OSPF Configuration
OSPF conﬁguration includes only a few required steps, but it has many optional steps. After 
an OSPF design has been chosen—a task that may be complex in larger IP internetworks—
the conﬁguration may be as simple as enabling OSPF on each router interface and placing 
that interface in the correct OSPF area.
This section shows several conﬁguration examples, starting with a single-area OSPF 
internetwork and then a multiarea OSPF internetwork. Following those examples, the text 
goes on to cover several of the additional optional conﬁguration settings. For reference, the 
following list outlines the conﬁguration steps covered in this chapter, as well as a brief 
reference to the required commands:
Step 1 Enter OSPF conﬁguration mode for a particular OSPF process using the router 
ospf process-id global command.
Step 2 (Optional) Conﬁgure the OSPF router ID by:
a. Conﬁguring the router-id id-value router subcommand.
b. Conﬁguring an IP address on a loopback interface.
Step 3 Conﬁgure one or more network ip-address wildcard-mask area area-id 
router subcommands, with any matched interfaces being added to the 
listed area.
Step 4 (Optional) Change the interface Hello and Dead intervals using the ip 
ospf hello-interval time and ip ospf dead-interval time interface 
subcommands.
Step 5 (Optional) Impact routing choices by tuning interface costs as follows:
a. Conﬁgure costs directly using the ip ospf cost value interface 
subcommand.
b. Change interface bandwidths using the bandwidth value interface 
subcommand.

362     Chapter 9: OSPF
c. Change the numerator in the formula to calculate the cost based on 
the interface bandwidth, using the auto-cost reference-bandwidth 
value router subcommand.
Step 6 (Optional) Conﬁgure OSPF authentication:
a. On a per-interface basis using the ip ospf authentication interface 
subcommand.
b. For all interfaces in an area using the area authentication router 
subcommand.
Step 7 (Optional) Conﬁgure support for multiple equal-cost routes using the 
maximum-paths number router subcommand.
OSPF Single-Area Configuration
OSPF conﬁguration differs only slightly from RIP conﬁguration when a single OSPF area 
is used. The best way to describe the conﬁguration, and the differences with the 
conﬁguration of the other routing protocols, is to use an example. Figure 9-7 shows a 
sample network, and Example 9-1 shows the conﬁguration on Albuquerque.

OSPF Configuration     363
The conﬁguration correctly enables OSPF on all three interfaces on Albuquerque. First, the 
router ospf 1 global command puts the user in OSPF conﬁguration mode. The router ospf 
command has a parameter called the OSPF process-id. In some instances, you might want 
to run multiple OSPF processes in a single router, so the router command uses the process-
id to distinguish between the processes. The process-id does not have to match on each 
router, and it can be any integer between 1 and 65,535.
The network command tells a router to enable OSPF on each matched interface, discover 
neighbors on that interface, assign the interface to that area, and advertise the subnet 
connected to each interface. In this case, the network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0 
command matches all three of Albuquerque's interfaces because the OSPF network 
command matches interfaces using an address and a wildcard-style mask like those used 
with IP ACLs. The wildcard mask shown in Example 9-1 is 0.255.255.255, with address 
10.0.0.0. From the details included in Chapter 6, “IP Access Control Lists,” this 
combination matches all addresses that begin with 10 in the ﬁrst octet. So, this one network 
command matches all three of Albuquerque's interfaces, puts them in Area 0, and causes 
Albuquerque to try to discover neighbors on those interfaces. It also causes Albuquerque to 
advertise the three connected subnets.
The wildcard mask in the OSPF network command works like an ACL wildcard mask, but 
there is one restriction on the values used. The OSPF wildcard mask must have only one 
string of consecutive binary 1s and one string of consecutive binary 0s. For example, a mask 
of 0.0.255.255 represents 16 binary 0s and 16 binary 1s and would be allowed. Likewise, a 
mask of 255.255.255.0 would be allowed, because it has a string of 24 binary 1s followed 
by eight binary 0s. However, a value of 0.255.255.0 would not be allowed, because it has 
two sets of eight binary 0s, separated by a string of 16 binary 1s.
Example 9-2 shows an alternative conﬁguration for Albuquerque that also enables OSPF 
on every interface. In this case, the IP address for each interface is matched with a different 
network command. The wildcard mask of 0.0.0.0 means that all 32 bits must be compared, 
and they must match—so the network commands include the speciﬁc IP address of each 
interface, respectively. Many people prefer this style of conﬁguration in production 
networks, because it removes any ambiguity about the interfaces on which OSPF is 
running.

OSPF Configuration with Multiple Areas
Conﬁguring OSPF with multiple areas is simple when you understand OSPF conﬁguration 
in a single area. Designing the OSPF network by making good choices about which subnets 
should be placed in which areas is the hard part! After the area design is complete, the 
conﬁguration is easy. For instance, consider Figure 9-8, which shows some subnets in Area 
0 and some in Area 1.

366     Chapter 9: OSPF
The conﬁguration needs to set the correct area number on the appropriate interfaces. For 
instance, the network 10.1.4.1 0.0.0.0 area 1 command at the beginning of Example 9-3 
matches Albuquerque's Serial 0/0 interface IP address, placing that interface in Area 1. The 
network 10.1.6.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 and network 10.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 commands place 
Serial 0/1 and Ethernet 0/0, respectively, in Area 0. Unlike Example 9-1, Albuquerque 
cannot be conﬁgured to match all three interfaces with a single network command, because 
one interface (Serial 0/0) is in a different area than the other two interfaces.
Continuing with Example 9-3, the show ip route ospf command just lists OSPF-learned 
routes, as opposed to the entire IP routing table. The show ip route command lists all three 
connected routes, as well as the three OSPF learned routes. Note that Albuquerque's route 
to 10.1.2.0 has the O designation beside it, meaning intra-area, because that subnet resides 
in Area 1, and Albuquerque is part of Area 1 and Area 0.
In Example 9-4, notice that the OSPF conﬁguration in Yosemite requires only a single 
network command because all interfaces in Yosemite are in Area 1. Also note that the 
routes learned by Yosemite from the other two routers show up as interarea (IA) routes, 
because those subnets are in Area 0, and Yosemite is in Area 1.
Configuring the OSPF Router ID
OSPF-speaking routers must have a Router ID (RID) for proper operation. To ﬁnd its RID, 
a Cisco router uses the following process when the router reloads and brings up the OSPF 
process. Note that when one of these steps identiﬁes the RID, the process stops.
1.
If the router-id rid OSPF subcommand is conﬁgured, this value is used as the RID.

2.
If any loopback interfaces have an IP address conﬁgured and the interface has a line 
and protocol status of up/up, the router picks the highest numeric IP address among the 
up/up loopback interfaces.
3.
The router picks the highest numeric IP address from all other working (up/up) 
interfaces.
The ﬁrst and third criteria should make some sense right away: the RID is either conﬁgured 
or is taken from a working interface's IP address. However, this book has not yet explained 
the concept of a loopback interface, as mentioned in Step 2. A loopback interface is a virtual 
interface that can be conﬁgured with the interface loopback interface-number command, 
where interface-number is an integer. Loopback interfaces are always in an “up and up” 
state unless administratively placed in a shutdown state. For instance, a simple 
conﬁguration of the command interface loopback 0, followed by ip address 
192.168.200.1 255.255.255.0, would create a loopback interface and assign it an IP 
address. Because loopback interfaces do not rely on any hardware, these interfaces can be 
up/up whenever IOS is running, making them good interfaces on which to base an OSPF 
RID.
Each router chooses its OSPF RID when OSPF is initialized. Initialization happens during 
the initial load of IOS. So, if OSPF comes up, and later other interfaces come up that happen 
to have higher IP addresses, the OSPF RID does not change until the OSPF process is 
restarted. OSPF can be restarted with the clear ip ospf process command as well, but 
depending on circumstances, IOS still may not change its OSPF RID until the next IOS 
reload.
Many commands list the OSPF RID of various routers. For instance, in Example 9-5, the 
ﬁrst neighbor in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command lists Router ID 10.1.5.2, 
which is Yosemite's RID. Following that, show ip ospf lists Albuquerque's own RID.
OSPF Hello and Dead Timers
The default settings for the OSPF Hello and dead timers typically work just ﬁne. However, 
it is important to note that a mismatch on either setting causes two potential neighbors to

Note also that the show ip ospf interface command lists more detailed information about 
OSPF operation on each interface. For instance, this command lists the area number, OSPF 
cost, and any neighbors known on each interface. The timers used on the interface, 
including the Hello and dead timer, are also listed.
To conﬁgure the Hello and Dead intervals, you can use the ip ospf hello-interval value and 
ip ospf dead-interval value interface subcommands. Interestingly, if the Hello interval is 
conﬁgured, IOS automatically reconﬁgures the interface's dead interval to be 4 times the 
Hello interval.
OSPF Metrics (Cost)
OSPF calculates the metric for each possible route by adding up the outgoing interfaces' 
OSPF costs. The OSPF cost for an interface can be conﬁgured, or a router can calculate the 
cost based on the interface's bandwidth setting.
As a reminder, the bandwidth setting on an interface can be conﬁgured using the 
bandwidth interface subcommand. This command sets the router's perception of interface 
speed, with a unit of Kbps. Note that the interface's bandwidth setting does not have to 
match the physical interface speed, but it usually makes sense to set the bandwidth to match 
the physical interface speed. On Ethernet interfaces, the bandwidth reﬂects the current 
negotiated speed—10,000 (meaning 10,000 Kbps or 10 Mbps) for 10 Mbps Ethernet, and 
100,000 (meaning 100,000 Kbps or 100 Mbps) for 100 Mbps. For serial interfaces, the 
bandwidth defaults to 1544 (meaning 1544 Kbps, or T1 speed), but IOS cannot adjust this 
setting dynamically.
IOS chooses an interface's cost based on the following rules:
1.
The cost can be explicitly set using the ip ospf cost x interface subcommand, to a value 
between 1 and 65,535, inclusive.
2.
IOS can calculate a value based on the generic formula Ref-BW / Int-BW, where Ref-
BW is a reference bandwidth that defaults to 100 Mbps, and Int-BW is the interface's 
bandwidth setting.
3.
The reference bandwidth can be conﬁgured from its default setting of 100 (100 Mbps) 
using the router OSPF subcommand auto-cost reference-bandwidth ref-bw, which in 
turn affects the calculation of the default interface cost.
The simple formula to calculate the default OSPF cost has one potentially confusing part. 
The calculation requires that the numerator and denominator use the same units, whereas 
the bandwidth and auto-cost reference-bandwidth commands use different units. For 
instance, Cisco IOS software defaults Ethernet interfaces to use a bandwidth of 10,000, 
meaning 10,000 Kbps, or 10 Mbps. The reference bandwidth defaults to a value of 100, 

370     Chapter 9: OSPF
meaning 100 Mbps. So, the default OSPF cost on an Ethernet interface would be 100 Mbps 
/ 10 Mbps, after making both values use a unit of Mbps. Higher-speed serial interfaces 
default to a bandwidth of 1544, giving a default cost of 108 bps / 1,544,000 bps, which is 
rounded down to a value of 64, as shown for interface S0/1 in Example 9-6. If the reference 
bandwidth had been changed to 1000, using the router OSPF subcommand auto-cost 
reference-bandwidth 1000, the calculated metric would be 647.
The main motivation for changing the reference bandwidth is so that routers can have 
different cost values for interfaces running at speeds of 100 Mbps and higher. With the 
default setting, an interface with a 100 Mbps bandwidth setting (for example, an FE 
interface) and an interface with a 1000 Mbps bandwidth (for example, a GE interface) 
would both have a default cost of 1. By changing the reference bandwidth to 1000, meaning 
1000 Mbps, the default cost on a 100-Mbps bandwidth interface would be 10, versus a 
default cost of 1 on an interface with a bandwidth of 1000 Mbps.
OSPF Authentication
Authentication is arguably the most important of the optional conﬁguration features for 
OSPF. The lack of authentication opens the network to attacks in which an attacker 
connects a router to the network, with the legitimate routers believing the OSPF data from 
the rogue router. As a result, the attacker can easily cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack 
by making all routers remove the legitimate routes to all subnets, instead installing routes 
that forward packets to the attacking router. The attacker can also perform a reconnaissance 
attack, learning information about the network by listening for and interpreting the OSPF 
messages.
OSPF supports three types of authentication—one called null authentication (meaning no 
authentication), one that uses a simple text password and therefore is easy to break, and one 
that uses MD5. Frankly, if you bother to conﬁgure an option in real life, the MD5 option is 
the only reasonable option. As soon as a router has conﬁgured OSPF authentication on an 
interface, that router must pass the authentication process for every OSPF message, with 
every neighboring router on that interface. This means that each neighboring router on that 
interface must also have the same authentication type and the same authentication password 
conﬁgured.
The conﬁguration can use two interface subcommands on each interface—one to enable the 
particular type of authentication, and one to set the password used for the authentication. 
NOTE
Cisco recommends making the OSPF reference bandwidth setting the same on 
all OSPF routers in a network.

OSPF Configuration     371
Example 9-7 shows a sample conﬁguration in which simple password authentication is 
conﬁgured on interface Fa0/0, and MD5 authentication is conﬁgured on Fa0/1.
The trickiest part of the conﬁguration is to remember the command syntax used on two 
interface subcommands. Note the interface subcommands used to conﬁgure the 
authentication keys, with the syntax differing depending on the type of authentication. For 
reference, Table 9-4 lists the three OSPF authentication types and the corresponding 
commands.

372     Chapter 9: OSPF
Note that the passwords, or authentication keys, are kept in clear text in the conﬁguration, 
unless you add the service password-encryption global command to the conﬁguration. (If 
you have a copy of CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, you might 
want to refer to Chapter 9 of that book for more information on the service password-
encryption command.)
The default setting to use type 0 authentication—which really means no authentication—
can be overridden on an area-by-area basis by using the area authentication router 
command. For example, Router R1 in Example 9-7 could be conﬁgured with the area 1 
authentication message-digest router subcommand, which makes that router default to 
use MD5 authentication on all its interfaces in Area 1. Similarly, the area 1 authentication 
router subcommand enables simple password authentication for all interfaces in Area 1, 
making the ip ospf authentication interface subcommand unnecessary. Note that the 
authentication keys (passwords) must still be conﬁgured with the interface subcommands 
listed in Table 9-4.
OSPF Load Balancing
When OSPF uses SPF to calculate the metric for each of several routes to reach one subnet, 
one route may have the lowest metric, so OSPF puts that route in the routing table. 
However, when the metric is a tie, the router can put up to 16 different equal-cost routes in 
the routing table (the default is four different routes) based on the setting of the maximum-
paths number router subcommand. For example, if an internetwork had six possible paths 
between some parts of the network, and the engineer wanted all routes to be used, the 
routers could be conﬁgured with the maximum-paths 6 subcommand under router ospf.
The more challenging concept relates to how the routers use those multiple routes. A router 
could load-balance the packets on a per-packet basis. For example, if the router had three 
equal-cost OSPF routes for the same subnet in the routing table, the router could send the 
next packet over the ﬁrst route, the next packet over the second route, the next packet over 
the third route, and then start over with the ﬁrst route for the next packet. Alternatively, the 
load balancing could be on a per-destination IP address basis.

EIGRP
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) provides an impressive set of 
features and attributes for its main purpose of learning IP routes. EIGRP converges very 
quickly, on par with or even faster than OSPF, but without some of the negatives of OSPF. 
In particular, EIGRP requires much less processing time, much less memory, and much less 
design effort than OSPF. The only signiﬁcant negative is that EIGRP is Cisco-proprietary, 
so if an internetwork uses some non-Cisco routers, EIGRP cannot be used on those routers.
EIGRP does not ﬁt neatly into the general categories of distance vector and link-state 
routing protocols. Sometimes Cisco refers to EIGRP as simply an advanced distance vector 
protocol, but in other cases, Cisco refers to EIGRP as a new type: a balanced hybrid routing 
protocol. Regardless of the category, the underlying concepts and processes used by EIGRP 
may have some similarities with other routing protocols, but EIGRP has far more 
differences, making EIGRP a unique routing protocol unto itself.
This chapter begins by examining some of the key concepts behind how EIGRP does its 
work. The second half of this chapter explains EIGRP conﬁguration and veriﬁcation.

EIGRP Concepts and Operation
Like OSPF, EIGRP follows three general steps to be able to add routes to the IP routing 
table:
1.
Neighbor discovery: EIGRP routers send Hello messages to discover potential 
neighboring EIGRP routers and perform basic parameter checks to determine which 
routers should become neighbors.
2.
Topology exchange: Neighbors exchange full topology updates when the neighbor 
relationship comes up, and then only partial updates as needed based on changes to the 
network topology.
3.
Choosing routes: Each router analyzes its respective EIGRP topology tables, 
choosing the lowest-metric route to reach each subnet.
As a result of these three steps, IOS maintains three important EIGRP tables. The EIGRP 
neighbor table lists the neighboring routers and is viewed with the show ip eigrp neighbor 
command. The EIGRP topology table holds all the topology information learned from 
EIGRP neighbors and is displayed with the show ip eigrp topology command. Finally, the 
IP routing table holds all the best routes and is displayed with the show ip route command.
The next few sections describe some details about how EIGRP forms neighbor 
relationships, exchanges routes, and adds entries to the IP routing table. In addition to these 
three steps, this section explains some unique logic EIGRP uses when converging and 
reacting to changes in an internetwork—logic that is not seen with the other types of routing 
protocols.
EIGRP Neighbors
An EIGRP neighbor is another EIGRP-speaking router, connected to a common subnet, 
with which the router is willing to exchange EIGRP topology information. EIGRP uses 
EIGRP Hello messages, sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.10, to dynamically discover 
potential neighbors. A router learns of potential neighbors by receiving a Hello.
Routers perform some basic checking of each potential neighbor before that router 
becomes an EIGRP neighbor. A potential neighbor is a router from which an EIGRP Hello 

EIGRP Concepts and Operation     381
has been received. Then the router checks the following settings to determine if the router 
should be allowed to be a neighbor:
■
It must pass the authentication process.
■
It must use the same conﬁgured AS number.
■
The source IP address used by the neighbor’s Hello must be in the same subnet.
The veriﬁcation checks are relatively straightforward. If authentication is conﬁgured, the 
two routers must be using the same type of authentication and the same authentication key. 
EIGRP conﬁguration includes a parameter called an autonomous system number (ASN), 
which must be the same on two neighboring routers. Finally, the IP addresses used to send 
the EIGRP Hello messages—the routers’ respective interface IP addresses—must be in the 
range of addresses on the other routers’ respective connected subnet.
The EIGRP neighbor relationship is much simpler than OSPF. EIGRP does not have an 
additional concept of being fully adjacent like OSPF, and there are no neighbor states like 
OSPF. As soon as an EIGRP neighbor is discovered and passes the basic veriﬁcation 
checks, the router becomes a neighbor. At that point, the two routers can begin exchanging 
topology information. The neighbors send Hellos every EIGRP Hello interval. A router 
considers its EIGRP neighbor to no longer be reachable after the neighbor’s Hellos cease 
to occur for the number of seconds deﬁned by the EIGRP Hold Timer—the rough 
equivalent of the OSPF Dead Interval.
Exchanging EIGRP Topology Information
EIGRP uses EIGRP Update messages to send topology information to neighbors. These 
Update messages can be sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.10 if the sending router needs 
to update multiple routers on the same subnet; otherwise, the updates are sent to the unicast 
IP address of the particular neighbor. (Hello messages are always sent to the 224.0.0.10 
multicast address.) Unlike OSPF, there is no concept of a Designated Router (DR) or 
Backup Designated Router (BDR), but the use of multicast packets on LANs allows EIGRP 
to exchange routing information with all neighbors on the LAN efﬁciently.
The update messages are sent using Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP). The signiﬁcance of 
RTP is that, like OSPF, EIGRP resends routing updates that are lost in transit. By using 
RTP, EIGRP can better avoid loops.
NOTE
The router’s EIGRP K values must also match, but this topic is outside the 
scope of this book.

382     Chapter 10: EIGRP
Neighbors use both full routing updates and partial updates, as shown in Figure 10-1. A full 
update means that a router sends information about all known routes, whereas a partial 
update includes only information about recently changed routes. Full updates occur when 
neighbors ﬁrst come up. After that, the neighbors send only partial updates in reaction to 
changes to a route. From top to bottom, Figure 10-1 shows neighbor discovery with Hellos, 
the sending of full updates, the maintenance of the neighbor relationship with ongoing 
Hellos, and partial updates.
Figure 10-1
Full and Partial EIGRP Updates
Calculating the Best Routes for the Routing Table
Metric calculation is one of the more interesting features of EIGRP. EIGRP uses a 
composite metric, calculated as a function of bandwidth and delay by default. The 
calculation can also include interface load and interface reliability, although Cisco 
recommends against using either. EIGRP calculates the metric for each possible route by 
inserting the values of the composite metric into a formula.
NOTE
The acronym RTP also refers to a different protocol, Real-time Transport 
Protocol (RTP), which is used to transmit voice and video IP packets.
NOTE
Past documents and books often stated that EIGRP, and its predecessor, IGRP, 
also could use MTU as a part of the metric, but MTU cannot be used and was never 
considered as part of the calculation.

EIGRP Concepts and Operation     383
EIGRP’s metric calculation formula actually helps describe some of the key points about 
the metric. The formula, assuming that the default settings use just bandwidth and delay, is 
as follows:
In this formula, the term least-bandwidth represents the lowest-bandwidth link in the route, 
using a unit of kilobits per second. For instance, if the slowest link in a route is a 10-Mbps 
Ethernet link, the ﬁrst part of the formula is 107 / 104, which equals 1000. You use 104 in 
the formula because 10 Mbps is equal to 10,000 kbps (104 kbps). The cumulative-delay 
value used in the formula is the sum of all the delay values for all links in the route, with a 
unit of “tens of microseconds.” You can set both bandwidth and delay for each link, using 
the cleverly named bandwidth and delay interface subcommands.
EIGRP updates list the subnet number and mask, along with the cumulative delay, 
minimum bandwidth, along with the other typically unused portions of the composite 
metric. The router then considers the bandwidth and delay settings on the interface on 
which the update was received and calculates a new metric. For example, Figure 10-2 
shows Albuquerque learning about subnet 10.1.3.0/24 from Seville. The update lists a 
minimum bandwidth of 100,000 kbps, and a cumulative delay of 100 microseconds. R1 has 
an interface bandwidth set to 1544 kbps—the default bandwidth on a serial link—and a 
delay of 20,000 microseconds.

NOTE
Most show commands, including show ip eigrp topology and show interfaces, 
list delay settings as the number of microseconds of delay. The metric formula uses a unit 
of tens of microseconds.

384     Chapter 10: EIGRP
In this case, Albuquerque discovers that its S0/1 interface bandwidth (1544) is less than the 
advertised minimum bandwidth of 100,000, so Albuquerque uses this new, slower 
bandwidth in the metric calculation. (If Albuquerque’s S0/1 interface had a bandwidth of 
100,000 or more in this case, Albuquerque would instead use the minimum bandwidth 
listed in the EIGRP Update from Seville.) Albuquerque also adds the interface S0/1 delay 
(20,000 microseconds, converted to 2000 tens-of-microseconds for the formula)  to the 
cumulative delay received from Seville in the update (100 microseconds, converted to 10 
tens-of-microseconds). This results in the following metric calculation:
If multiple possible routes to subnet 10.1.3.0/24 existed, Albuquerque would also calculate 
the metric for those routes and would choose the route with the best (lowest) metric to be 
added to the routing table. If the metric is a tie, by default a router would place up to four 
equal-metric routes into the routing table, sending some trafﬁc over each route. The later 
section “EIGRP Maximum Paths and Variance” explains a few more details about how 
EIGRP can add multiple equal-metric routes, and multiple unequal-metric routes, to the 
routing table.
Feasible Distance and Reported Distance
The example described for Figure 10-2 provides a convenient backdrop to deﬁne a couple 
of EIGRP terms:
■
Feasible Distance (FD): The metric of the best route to reach a subnet, as calculated 
on a router
■
Reported Distance (RD): The metric as calculated on a neighboring router and then 
reported and learned in an EIGRP Update
For example, in Figure 10-2, Albuquerque calculates an FD of 2,195,631 to reach subnet 
10.1.3.0/24 through Seville. Seville also calculates its own metric to reach subnet 10.1.3.0/24. 
Seville also lists that metric in its EIGRP update sent to Albuquerque. In fact, based on the 
information in Figure 10-2, Seville’s FD to reach subnet 10.1.3.0/24, which is then known 
by Albuquerque as Seville’s RD to reach 10.1.3.0/24, could be easily calculated:
NOTE
IOS rounds down the division in this formula to the nearest integer before 
performing the rest of the formula. In this case, 107 / 1544 is rounded down to 6476.

when a change occurs in an internetwork.
Caveats with Bandwidth on Serial Links
EIGRP’s robust metric gives it the ability to choose routes that include more router hops 
but with faster links. However, to ensure that the right routes are chosen, engineers must 
take care to conﬁgure meaningful bandwidth and delay settings. In particular, serial links 
default to a bandwidth of 1544 and a delay of 20,000 microseconds, as used in the example 
shown in Figure 10-2. However, IOS cannot automatically change the bandwidth and delay 
settings based on the Layer 1 speed of a serial link. So, using default bandwidth settings on 
serial links can lead to problems.
Figure 10-3 shows the problem with using default bandwidth settings and how EIGRP uses 
the better (faster) route when the bandwidth is set correctly. The ﬁgure focuses on router 
B’s route to subnet 10.1.1.0/24 in each case. In the top part of the ﬁgure, all serial interfaces 
use defaults, even though the top serial link is a slow 64 kbps. The bottom ﬁgure shows the 
results when the slow serial link’s bandwidth command is changed to reﬂect the correct 
(slow) speed.
Figure 10-3
Impact of the Bandwidth on EIGRP’s Metric Calculation
EIGRP Convergence
Loop avoidance poses one of the most difﬁcult problems with any dynamic routing 
protocol. Distance vector protocols overcome this problem with a variety of tools, some of 
which create a large portion of the minutes-long convergence time after a link failure. Link-
state protocols overcome this problem by having each router keep a full topology of the 
network, so by running a rather involved mathematical model, a router can avoid any loops.

386     Chapter 10: EIGRP
EIGRP avoids loops by keeping some basic topological information, but it avoids spending 
too much CPU and memory by keeping the information brief. When a router learns multiple 
routes to the same subnet, it puts the best route in the IP routing table. EIGRP keeps some 
topological information for the same reason as OSPF—so that it can very quickly converge 
and use a new route without causing a loop. Essentially, EIGRP keeps a record of each 
possible next-hop router, and some details related to those routes, but no information about 
the topology beyond the next-hop routers. This sparser topology information does not 
require the sophisticated SPF algorithm, resulting in quick convergence and less overhead, 
with no loops.
The EIGRP convergence process uses one of two branches in its logic, based on whether 
the failed route does or does not have a feasible successor route. If a feasible successor 
route exists, the router can immediately use that route. If not, the router must use a query 
and response process to ﬁnd a loop-free alternative route. Both processes result in fast 
convergence, typically quicker than 10 seconds, but the query and response process takes 
slightly longer.
EIGRP Successors and Feasible Successors
EIGRP calculates the metric for each route to reach each subnet. For a particular subnet, 
the route with the best metric is called the successor, with the router ﬁlling the IP routing 
table with this route. (This route’s metric is called the feasible distance, as introduced earlier.)
Of the other routes to reach that same subnet—routes whose metrics were larger than the 
FD for the route—EIGRP needs to determine which can be used immediately if the 
currently best route fails, without causing a routing loop. EIGRP runs a simple algorithm 
to identify which routes could be used, keeping these loop-free backup routes in its 
topology table and using them if the currently best route fails. These alternative, 
immediately usable routes are called feasible successor routes, because they can feasibly 
be used when the successor route fails. A router determines if a route is a feasible successor 
based on the feasibility condition:
If a nonsuccessor route’s RD is less than the FD, the route is a feasible 
successor route.
Although it is technically correct, this deﬁnition is much more understandable with the 
example shown in Figure 10-4. The ﬁgure illustrates how EIGRP ﬁgures out which routes 
are feasible successors for subnet 1. In the ﬁgure, Router E learns three routes to Subnet 1, 
from Routers B, C, and D. After calculating each route’s metric, based on bandwidth and 
delay information received in the routing update and on E’s corresponding outgoing 

EIGRP Concepts and Operation     387
interfaces, Router E ﬁnds that the route through Router D has the lowest metric, so Router 
E adds that route to its routing table, as shown. The FD is the metric calculated for this 
route, a value of 14,000 in this case.
Figure 10-4
Successors and Feasible Successors with EIGRP
EIGRP decides if a route can be a feasible successor if the reported distance for that route 
(the metric as calculated on that neighbor) is less than its own best computed metric (the 
FD). When that neighbor has a lower metric for its route to the subnet in question, that route 
is said to have met the feasibility condition. For example, Router E computes a metric (FD) 
of 14,000 on its best route (through Router D). Router C’s computed metric—its reported 
distance for this route—is lower than 14,000 (it’s 13,000). As a result, E knows that C’s best 
route for this subnet could not possibly point toward router E, so Router E believes that it 
could start using the route through Router C and not cause a loop. As a result, Router E adds 
a route through Router C to the topology table as a feasible successor route. Conversely, 
Router B’s reported distance is 15,000, which is larger than Router E’s FD of 14,000, so 
Router E does not consider the route through Router B a feasible successor.
If the route to Subnet 1 through Router D fails, Router E can immediately put the route 
through Router C into the routing table without fear of creating a loop. Convergence occurs 
almost instantly in this case.
The Query and Reply Process
When a route fails and has no feasible successor, EIGRP uses a distributed algorithm called 
Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL). DUAL sends queries looking for a loop-free route to 
the subnet in question. When the new route is found, DUAL adds it to the routing table.

(C’s RD is 13,000, which Is Less than E’s Metric)

388     Chapter 10: EIGRP
The EIGRP DUAL process simply uses messages to conﬁrm that a route exists, and would 
not create a loop, before deciding to replace a failed route with an alternative route. For 
instance, in Figure 10-4, imagine that both Routers C and D fail. Router E does not have a 
feasible successor route for subnet 1, but there is an obvious physically available path 
through Router B. To use the route, Router E sends EIGRP query messages to its working 
neighbors (in this case, Router B). Router B’s route to subnet 1 is still working ﬁne, so 
Router B replies to Router E with an EIGRP reply message, simply stating the details of the 
working route to subnet 1 and conﬁrming that it is still viable. Router E can then add a new 
route to subnet 1 to its routing table, without fear of a loop.
Replacing a failed route with a feasible successor takes a very short amount of time, 
typically less than a second or two. When queries and replies are required, convergence can 
take slightly longer, but in most networks, convergence can still occur in less than 10 
seconds.
EIGRP Summary and Comparisons with OSPF
EIGRP is a popular IGP for many reasons. It works well, converging quickly while 
avoiding loops as a side effect of its underlying balanced hybrid/advanced distance vector 
algorithms. It does not require a lot of conﬁguration or a lot of planning, even when scaling 
to support larger internetworks.
EIGRP also has another advantage that is not as important today as in years past: the 
support of Novell’s IPX and Apple’s AppleTalk Layer 3 protocols. Routers can run EIGRP 
to learn IP routes, IPX routes, and AppleTalk routes, with the same wonderful performance 
features. However, like many other Layer 3 protocols, IP has mostly usurped IPX and 
AppleTalk, making support for these Layer 3 protocols a minor advantage.

EIGRP Configuration and Verification
Basic EIGRP conﬁguration closely resembles RIP and OSPF conﬁguration. The router 
eigrp command enables EIGRP and puts the user in EIGRP conﬁguration mode, in which 
one or more network commands are conﬁgured. For each interface matched by a network 
command, EIGRP tries to discover neighbors on that interface, and EIGRP advertises the 
subnet connected to the interface.
This section examines EIGRP conﬁguration, including several optional features. It also 
explains the meaning of the output of many show commands to help connect the theory 
covered in the ﬁrst part of this chapter with the reality of the EIGRP implementation in IOS. 
The following conﬁguration checklist outlines the main conﬁguration tasks covered in this 
chapter:
Step 1 Enter EIGRP conﬁguration mode, and deﬁne the EIGRP ASN by using the router 
eigrp as-number global command.
Step 2 Conﬁgure one or more network ip-address [wildcard-mask] router 
subcommands. This enables EIGRP on any matched interface and causes 
EIGRP to advertise the connected subnet.
Step 3 (Optional) Change the interface Hello and hold timers using the ip hello-
interval eigrp asn time and ip hold-time eigrp asn time interface 
subcommands.
Step 4 (Optional) Impact metric calculations by tuning bandwidth and delay 
using the bandwidth value and delay value interface subcommands.
Step 5 (Optional) Conﬁgure EIGRP authentication.

For EIGRP conﬁguration, all three routers must use the same AS number in the router 
eigrp command. For instance, they all use router eigrp 1 in this example. The actual 
number used doesn’t really matter, as long as it is the same on all three routers. (The range 
of valid AS numbers is 1 through 65,535, as is the range of valid Process IDs with the 
router ospf command.) The network 10.0.0.0 command enables EIGRP on all interfaces 
whose IP addresses are in network 10.0.0.0, which includes all three interfaces on 
Albuquerque. With the identical two EIGRP conﬁguration statements on the other two 
routers, EIGRP is enabled on all three interfaces on those routers as well, because those 
interfaces are also in network 10.0.0.0.

Sample Router Conﬁguration with EIGRP Enabled (Continued)

392     Chapter 10: EIGRP
The show ip route and show ip route eigrp commands both list the EIGRP-learned routes 
with a “D” beside them. “D” signiﬁes EIGRP. The letter E was already being used for 
Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) when Cisco created EIGRP, so Cisco chose the next-
closest unused letter, D, to denote EIGRP-learned routes.
You can see information about EIGRP neighbors with the show ip eigrp neighbors 
command and information about the number of active neighbors (called peers in the 
command output) with the show ip eigrp interfaces command, as shown in the last part of 
the example. These commands also provide some insight into EIGRP’s underlying 
processes, such as the use of RTP for reliable transmission. For instance, the show ip eigrp 
neighbors command shows a “Q Cnt” (Queue Count) column, listing either the number of 
packets waiting to be sent to a neighbor or packets that have been sent but for which no 
acknowledgment has been received. The show ip eigrp interfaces command lists similar 
information in the “Xmit Queue Un/Reliable” column, which separates statistics for 
EIGRP messages that are sent with RTP (reliable) or without it (unreliable).
Finally, the end of the example displays Albuquerque’s RID. EIGRP allocates its RID just 
like OSPF—based on the conﬁgured value, or the highest IP address of an up/up loopback 
interface, or the highest IP address of a nonloopback interface, in that order of precedence. 
The only difference compared to OSPF is that the EIGRP RID is conﬁgured with the eigrp 
router-id value router subcommand.
The EIGRP network command can be conﬁgured without a wildcard mask, as shown in 
Example 10-1. Without a wildcard mask, the network command must use a classful 
network as the lone parameter, and all interfaces in the classful network are matched. 
Example 10-2 shows an alternative conﬁguration that uses a network command with an 
address and wildcard mask. In this case, the command matches an interface IP address that 
would be matched if the address and mask in the network command were part of an ACL. 
The example shows three network commands on Albuquerque, one matching each of the 
three interfaces.
EIGRP Metrics, Successors, and Feasible Successors
As deﬁned earlier in this chapter, an EIGRP successor route is a route that has the best 
metric for reaching a subnet, and a Feasible Successor (FS) route is a route that could be 
used if the successor route failed. This section examines how to see successor and FS routes

Albuquerque’s single best route to reach subnet 10.1.3.0/24, both in the routing table and 
as the successor route in the EIGRP topology table. It also lists the two equal-metric 
successor routes for subnet 10.1.5.0/24, with both of these successor routes being 
highlighted in the EIGRP topology table. Some of the explanations are listed in the

The comments in the example explain the main key points, most of which are relatively 
straightforward. However, a closer look at the show ip eigrp topology command can 
provide a few insights. First, focus on the EIGRP topology table’s listing of the number of 
successor routes. The entry for 10.1.3.0/24 states that there is one successor, so the IP 
routing table lists one EIGRP-learned route for subnet 10.1.3.0/24. In comparison, the 
EIGRP topology table entry for subnet 10.1.5.0/24 states that two successors exist, so the 
IP routing table shows two EIGRP-learned routes for that subnet.
Next, focus on the numbers in brackets for the EIGRP topology table entry for 10.1.3.0/24. 
The ﬁrst number is the metric calculated by Albuquerque for each route. The second 
number is the RD—the metric as calculated on neighboring router 10.1.6.3 (Seville) and as 
reported to Albuquerque. Because these routers have defaulted all bandwidth and delay 
settings, the metric values match the sample metric calculations shown in the earlier section 
“Calculating the Best Routes for the Routing Table.”
Creating and Viewing a Feasible Successor Route
With all default settings in this internetwork, none of Albuquerque’s routes meet the 
feasibility condition, in which an alternative route’s RD is less than or equal to the FD (the 
metric of the best route). Example 10-4 changes the bandwidth on one of Yosemite’s 
interfaces, lowering Yosemite’s FD to reach subnet 10.1.3.0/24. In turn, Yosemite’s RD for 
this same route, as reported to Albuquerque, will now be lower, meeting the feasibility 
condition, so Albuquerque will now have an FS route.
P 10.1.5.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 2681856
         via 10.1.4.2 (2681856/2169856), Serial0/0

To see the feasible successor route, and why it is a feasible successor, look at the two 
numbers in parentheses in the second highlighted line from the show ip eigrp topology 
command on Albuquerque. The ﬁrst of these is Albuquerque’s router’s calculated metric for 
the route, and the second number is the neighbor’s RD. Of the two possible routes—one 
through 10.1.6.3 (Seville) and one through 10.1.4.2 (Yosemite)—the route through Seville 
has the lowest metric (2,172,416), making it the successor route, and making the FD also 
be 2,172,416. Albuquerque puts this route into the IP routing table. However, note the RD 
on the second of the two routes (the route through Yosemite), with an RD value of 
1,794,560. The feasibility condition is that the route’s RD must be smaller than that router’s 
best calculated metric—its FD—for that same destination subnet. So, the route through 
Yosemite meets this condition, making it a feasible successor route. The following points 
summarize the key information about the successor and feasible successor routes in this 
example:
■
The route to 10.1.3.0 through 10.1.6.3 (Seville) is the successor route, because the 
calculated metric (2,172,416), shown as the ﬁrst of the two numbers in parentheses, is 
the best calculated metric.
■
The route to 10.1.3.0 through 10.1.4.2 (Yosemite) is a feasible successor route, because 
the neighbor’s Reported Distance (1,794,560, shown as the second number in 
parentheses) is lower than Albuquerque’s FD.
■
Although both the successor and feasible successor routes are in the EIGRP topology 
table, only the successor route is added to the IP routing table.

Convergence Using the Feasible Successor Route
One of the advantages of EIGRP is that it converges very quickly. Example 10-5 shows one 
such example, using debug messages to show the process. Some of the debug messages 
may not make a lot of sense, but the example does highlight a few interesting and 
understandable debug messages.
For this example, the link between Albuquerque and Seville is shut down, but this is not 
shown in the example. The debug messages on Albuquerque show commentary about 
EIGRP’s logic in changing from the original route for 10.1.3.0/24 to the new route through 
Yosemite. Pay particular attention to the time stamps, which show that the convergence 
process takes less than 1 second.

EIGRP Authentication
EIGRP supports one type of authentication: MD5. Conﬁguring MD5 authentication 
requires several steps:
Step 1 Create an (authentication) key chain:
a. Create the chain and give it a name with the key chain name global 
command (this also puts the user into key chain conﬁg mode).
b. Create one or more key numbers using the key number command in 
key chain conﬁguration mode.
c. Deﬁne the authentication key’s value using the key-string value 
command in key conﬁguration mode.
d. (Optional) Deﬁne the lifetime (time period) for both sending and 
accepting this particular key.
Step 2 Enable EIGRP MD5 authentication on an interface, for a particular 
EIGRP ASN, using the ip authentication mode eigrp asn md5 interface 
subcommand.
Step 3 Refer to the correct key chain to be used on an interface using the ip 
authentication key-chain eigrp asn name-of-chain interface 
subcommand.
The conﬁguration in Step 1 is fairly detailed, but Steps 2 and 3 are relatively simple. 
Essentially, IOS conﬁgures the key values separately, then requires an interface 
subcommand to refer to the key values. To support the ability to have multiple keys, and 
even multiple sets of keys, the conﬁguration includes the concept of a key chain and 
multiple keys on each key chain.

398     Chapter 10: EIGRP
The IOS key chain concept resembles key chains and keys used in everyday life. Most 
people have at least one key chain, with the keys they typically use every day. If you have 
a lot of keys for work and home, you might have two key chains to make it a little easier to 
ﬁnd the right key. You might even have a key chain with seldom-used keys that you keep on 
a shelf somewhere. Similarly, IOS allows lets you conﬁgure multiple key chains so that 
different key chains can be used on different interfaces. Each key chain can include multiple 
keys. Having multiple keys in one key chain allows neighbors to still be up and working 
while the keys are being changed. (As with all passwords and authentication keys, changing 
the keys occasionally enhances security.) To conﬁgure these main details, follow Steps 1A, 
1B, and 1C to create the key chain, create one or more keys, and assign the text key 
(password).
The last and optional item that can be conﬁgured for EIGRP authentication is the useful 
lifetime of each key. If this isn’t conﬁgured, the key is valid forever. However, if it is 
conﬁgured, the router uses the key only during the listed times. This feature allows the key 
chain to include several keys, each with different successive lifetimes. For example, 12 keys 
could be deﬁned, one for each month of the year. The routers then automatically use the 
lowest-numbered key whose time range is valid, changing keys automatically every month 
in this example. This feature allows an engineer to conﬁgure the keys once and have the 
routers use new keys occasionally, improving security.
To support the useful lifetime concept, a router must know the time and date. Routers can 
set the time and date with the clock set EXEC command. Routers can also use Network 
Time Protocol (NTP), a protocol that allows routers to synchronize their time-of-day 
clocks.
The best way to appreciate the conﬁguration is to see an example. Example 10-6 shows a 
sample conﬁguration that uses two key chains. Key chain “fred” has two keys, each with 
different lifetimes, so that the router will use new keys automatically over time. It also 
shows the two key chains being referenced on two different interfaces.
Example 10-6
EIGRP Authentication 
! Chain “carkeys” will be used on R1’s Fa0/0 interface. R1 will use key “fred”
! for about a month and then start using “wilma.”

EIGRP Configuration and Verification     399
For authentication to work, neighboring routers must both have EIGRP MD5 
authentication enabled, and the key strings they currently use must match. Note that the key 
chain name does not need to match. The most common problems relate to when the useful 
lifetime settings do not match, or one of the router’s clocks has the wrong time. For real-
life implementations, NTP should be enabled and used before restricting keys to a 
particular time frame.
To verify that the authentication worked, use the show ip eigrp neighbors command. If the 
authentication fails, the neighbor relationship will not form. Also, if you see routes learned 
from a neighbor on that interface, it also proves that authentication worked. You can see 
more details about the authentication process using the debug eigrp packets command, 
particularly if the authentication fails.
EIGRP Maximum Paths and Variance
Like OSPF, EIGRP supports the ability to put multiple equal-metric routes in the routing 
table. Like OSPF, EIGRP defaults to support four such routes for each subnet, and it can be 
conﬁgured to support up to 16 using the maximum-paths number EIGRP subcommand. 
However, EIGRP’s metric calculation often prevents competing routes from having the 
exact same metric. The formula may result in similar metrics, but given that the metric 
values can easily be in the millions, calculating the exact same metric is statistically 
unlikely.
! Next, key chain “anothersetofkeys” defines the key to be used on

EIGRP Authentication (Continued)

400     Chapter 10: EIGRP
IOS includes the concept of EIGRP variance to overcome this problem. Variance allows 
routes whose metrics are relatively close in value to be considered equal, allowing multiple 
unequal-metric routes to the same subnet to be added to the routing table.
The variance multiplier EIGRP router subcommand deﬁnes an integer between 1 and 128. 
The router then multiplies the variance times a route’s FD—the best metric with which to 
reach that subnet. Any FS routes whose metric is less than the product of the variance times 
the FD are considered to be equal routes and may be placed in the routing table, depending 
on the setting of the maximum-paths command.
An example of variance can make this concept clear. To keep the numbers more obvious, 
Table 10-3 lists an example with small metric values. The table lists the metric for three 
routes to the same subnet, as calculated on router R4. The table also lists the neighboring 
routers’ RD, and the decision to add routes to the routing table based on various variance 
settings.
Before considering the variance, note that in this case, the route through R1 is the successor 
route because it has the lowest metric. This also means that the metric for the route through 
R1, 50, is the FD. The route through R2 is an FS route because its RD of 40 is less than the 
FD of 50. The route through R3 is not an FS route, because R3’s RD of 60 is more than the 
FD of 50.
At a default variance setting of 1, the metrics must be exactly equal to be considered equal, 
so only the successor route is added to the routing table. With variance 2, the FD (50) is 
multiplied by the variance (2) for a product of 100. The route through R2, with FD 90, is 
less than 100, so R4 adds the route through R2 to the routing table as well. The router can 
then load-balance trafﬁc across these two routes.
In the third case, with variance 3, the product of the FD (50) times 3 results in a product of 
150, and all three routes’ calculated metrics are less than 150. However, the route through 
R3 is not an FS route, so it cannot be added to the routing table for fear of causing a routing 
loop.

EIGRP Configuration and Verification     401
The following list summarizes the key points about variance:
■
The variance is multiplied by the current FD (the metric of the best route to reach the 
subnet).
■
Any FS routes whose calculated metric is less than or equal to the product of variance 
times the FD are added to the IP routing table, assuming that the maximum-paths 
setting allows more routes.
■
Routes that are neither successor nor feasible successor can never be added to the IP 
routing table, regardless of the variance setting.
As soon as the routes have been added to the routing table, the router supports a variety of 
options for how to load-balance trafﬁc across the routes. The router can balance the trafﬁc 
proportionally with the metrics, meaning that lower metric routes send more packets. The 
router can send all trafﬁc over the lowest-metric route, with the other routes just being in 
the routing table for faster convergence in case the best route fails. However, the details of 
the load-balancing process require a much deeper discussion of the internals of the 
forwarding process in IOS, and this topic is outside the scope of this book.
Tuning the EIGRP Metric Calculation
By default, EIGRP calculates an integer metric based on the composite metric of bandwidth 
and delay. Both settings can be changed on any interface using the bandwidth value and 
the delay value interface subcommands.
Cisco recommends setting each interface’s bandwidth to an accurate value, rather than 
setting the bandwidth to change EIGRP’s metric calculation. Although LAN interfaces 
default to accurate bandwidth settings, router serial links should be conﬁgured with the 
bandwidth speed command, with a speed value in kbps, matching the interface’s actual 
speed.
Because fewer features rely on the interface delay setting, Cisco recommends that if you 
want to tune EIGRP metric, change the interface delay settings. To change an interface’s 
delay setting, use the delay value command, where the value is the delay setting with an 
unusual unit: tens-of-microseconds. Interestingly, the EIGRP metric formula also uses the 
unit of tens-of-microseconds; however, show commands list the delay with a unit of 
microseconds. Example 10-7 shows an example, with the following details:
1.
The router’s Fa0/0 has a default delay setting of 100 microseconds (usec).
2.
The delay 123 command is conﬁgured on the interface, meaning 123 tens-of-
microseconds.

402     Chapter 10: EIGRP
3.
The show interfaces fa0/0 command now lists a delay of 1230 microseconds.

Troubleshooting 
Routing Protocols
Chapters 3 and 7, the other two chapters of this book that are dedicated to troubleshooting, 
focus on the process of forwarding data. In particular, Chapter 7, “Troubleshooting IP 
Routing,” mostly ignores how routes are added to the routing table, focusing entirely on the 
data plane process of IP packet forwarding and how to troubleshoot that process. Chapter 
7 assumes that the control plane processes related to ﬁlling the routing table will be covered 
elsewhere—mainly in Part III of this book.
This chapter wraps up the coverage of the IPv4 control plane—the process of ﬁlling 
routers’ routing tables with good routes—by examining how to troubleshoot problems with 
OSPF and EIGRP. The troubleshooting process itself is relatively straightforward, at least 
to the depth required for the CCNA exams. However, as usual, you need to think about 
many different details while troubleshooting, so the process can help ensure that you verify 
each component before moving on to the next function.
This chapter concludes Part III of this book. If you are preparing speciﬁcally for the CCNA 
exam by using the reading plan mentioned in the Introduction, note that after this chapter, 
you should go back to CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, Part IV.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
The troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters, 
including some chapters in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide. They 
also show you how to approach some of the more challenging questions on the CCNA 
exams. Therefore, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge 
level. For these reasons, the troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This 
Already?“ quiz. However, if you feel particularly conﬁdent about troubleshooting OSPF 
and EIGRP, feel free to move to the “Exam Preparation Tasks” section near the end of this 
chapter to bypass the majority of the chapter.

408     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
Foundation Topics
The best ﬁrst step when troubleshooting a routing protocol is to examine the conﬁguration 
on the various routers. Comparing the routing protocol conﬁguration, particularly the 
network subcommands, to the interface IP addresses can quickly conﬁrm whether the 
routing protocol has been enabled on all the intended interfaces. If it is enabled on all the 
correct interfaces on all the routers, further examination of interface conﬁguration and 
authentication conﬁguration can verify whether some conﬁguration settings might prevent 
two routers on the same subnet from becoming neighbors. A failure to pass all the 
requirements to become neighbors will prevent two routers from exchanging routing 
information.
Chapter 9, “OSPF,” and Chapter 10, “EIGRP,” cover routing protocol conﬁguration in 
depth, so this chapter makes no attempt to explain how to troubleshoot a problem by 
looking for conﬁguration mistakes. However, the conﬁguration may not always be available 
for the exams or in real life. This chapter focuses on how to troubleshoot routing protocol 
problems using only show and debug commands. First, this chapter discusses some options 
for troubleshooting routing protocol problems, including a suggested process that has two 
major steps. The other two major sections of this chapter examine how to perform each of 
the major troubleshooting steps, for both EIGRP and OSPF.
Perspectives on Troubleshooting Routing Protocol 
Problems
Because a routing protocol’s job is to ﬁll a router’s routing table with the currently best 
routes, it makes sense that troubleshooting potential problems with routing protocols could 
begin with the IP routing table. Given basic information about an internetwork, including 
the routers, their IP addresses and masks, and the routing protocol, you could calculate the 
subnet numbers that should be in the router’s routing table and list the likely next-hop 
router(s) for each route. For example, Figure 11-1 shows an internetwork with six subnets. 
Router R1’s routing table should list all six subnets, with three connected routes, two routes 
learned from R2 (172.16.4.0/24 and 172.16.5.0/24), and one route learned from R3 
(172.16.6.0/24).
So, one possible troubleshooting process would be to analyze the internetwork, look at the 
routing table, and look for missing routes. If one or more expected routes are missing, the 
next step would be to determine if that router has learned any routes from the expected next-
hop (neighbor) router. The next steps to isolate the problem differ greatly if a router is 
having problems forming a neighbor relationship with another router, versus having a 
working neighbor relationship but not being able to learn all routes.

Perspectives on Troubleshooting Routing Protocol Problems     409
Figure 11-1
Internetwork with Six Subnets
For example, imagine that R1 in Figure 11-1 has learned a route for subnet 172.16.4.0/24 
in Figure 11-1 but not for subnet 172.16.5.0/24. In this case, it is clear that R1 has a working 
neighbor relationship with R2. In these cases, the root cause of this problem may still be 
related to the routing protocol, or it might be unrelated to the routing protocol. For example, 
the problem may be that R2’s lower LAN interface is down. However, if R1 did not have a 
route for either 172.16.4.0/24 or 172.16.5.0/24, R1’s neighbor relationship with R2 could 
be the problem.
Troubleshooting routing protocol problems in real internetworks can be very complex—
much more complex than even the more difﬁcult CCNA exam questions. Deﬁning a generic 
troubleshooting process with which to attack both simple and complex routing protocol 
problems would require a lot of space, and be counter-productive for preparing for the 
CCNA exams. This chapter offers a straightforward process for attacking routing protocol 
problems—speciﬁcally, problems similar to the depth and complexity of the CCNA exams.
If an exam question appears to be related to a problem with a routing protocol, you can 
quickly identify some common conﬁguration errors with the following process—even 
without the conﬁguration or the ability to use the show running-conﬁg command. The 
process has three main branches:
Step 1 Examine the internetwork design to determine on which interfaces the routing 
protocol should be enabled and which routers are expected to become neighbors.
Step 2 Verify whether the routing protocol is enabled on each interface (as per 
Step 1). If it isn’t, determine the root cause and ﬁx the problem.

Step 3 Verify that each router has formed all expected neighbor relationships. If 
it hasn’t, ﬁnd the root cause and ﬁx the problem.
At this point, having completed chapters 9 and 10, Step 1 should not require any further 
explanation. The two remaining major sections of this chapter examine Steps 2 and 3. By 
completing these steps and ﬁxing any problems found throughout this process, you should 
have ﬁxed the CCNA-level routing protocol problems.
Interfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol
This section examines the second major troubleshooting step outlined in the previous 
section of the chapter: how to verify the interfaces on which the routing protocol has been 
enabled. Both EIGRP and OSPF conﬁguration enables the routing protocol on an interface 
by using the network router subcommand. For any interfaces matched by the network 
commands, the routing protocol tries the following two actions:
■
Attempt to ﬁnd potential neighbors on the subnet connected to the interface
■
Advertise the subnet connected to that interface
At the same time, the passive-interface router subcommand can be conﬁgured so that the 
router does not attempt to ﬁnd neighbors on the interface (the ﬁrst action just listed) but still 
advertises the connected subnet (the second action).
Three show commands are all that is needed to know exactly which interfaces have been 
enabled with EIGRP and OSPF and which interfaces are passive. In particular, the show ip 
eigrp interfaces command lists all EIGRP-enabled interfaces that are not passive 
interfaces. The show ip protocols command essentially lists the contents of the conﬁgured 
network commands for each routing protocol, as well as a separate list of the passive 
interfaces. Comparing these two commands identiﬁes all EIGRP-enabled interfaces and 
those that are passive. For OSPF, the command works slightly differently, with the show ip 
ospf interface brief command listing all OSPF-enabled interfaces (including passive 
interfaces). Table 11-1 summarizes these commands for easier reference.

Interfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol     411
So, for the major troubleshooting step covered in this section, the task is to use the 
commands in Table 11-1 and analyze the output. First an EIGRP example will be shown, 
followed by an OSPF example.
EIGRP Interface Troubleshooting Example
This section shows a few examples of the commands in the context of Figure 11-2, which 
is used in all the examples in this chapter.
Figure 11-2
Sample Internetwork for EIGRP/OSPF Troubleshooting Examples
This example includes four routers, with the following scenario in this case:
■
R1 and R2 are conﬁgured correctly on both LAN interfaces.
■
R3 is mistakenly not enabled with EIGRP on its Fa0/1 interface.
■
R4 meant to use a passive-interface fa0/1 command, because no other routers are off 
R4’s Fa0/1 LAN, but instead R4 has conﬁgured a passive-interface fa0/0 command.
Example 11-1 begins by showing the pertinent commands, with an example on either R1 
or on R2. It also shows the conﬁguration on R1 for the sake of comparison.
NOTE
All the commands in Table 11-1 list the interfaces regardless of interface status, 
in effect telling you the results of the network and passive-interface conﬁguration 
commands.

EIGRP Problems with Interfaces (Continued)

Interfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol     413
The show ip eigrp interfaces command output on both R1 and R2 shows how both R1 and 
R2 have conﬁgured EIGRP using process ID 99, and that EIGRP has been enabled on both 
Fa0/0 and Fa0/1 on R1 and R2. This command lists only interfaces on which EIGRP has 
been enabled, excluding passive interfaces.
The highlighted parts of the show ip protocols command output on each router are 
particularly interesting. These sections show the parameters of the conﬁgured network 
commands. For each network command, the show ip protocols command lists a separate 
line under the header “Routing for Networks,” with each line listing the contents of the 
various network router subcommands. For example, R1 uses the network 10.0.0.0 
conﬁguration command (shown at the beginning of the example), which matches the 
“10.0.0.0” line in the output of the show ip protocols command.
The end of the example gives brief insight into the current problem on R3 from R2’s 
perspective. The end of the show ip protocols command on R2 lists two routing 
information sources: 10.1.1.1 (R1) and 10.1.1.3 (R3). However, R2 has learned only one 
EIGRP route (10.1.11.0/24), as shown in the show ip route eigrp command output. When 
working properly, R2 should learn three EIGRP routes—one for each of the outer LAN 
subnets shown in Figure 11-2.
Next, Example 11-2 shows the problems on R3 and R4 that prevent R1 and R2 from 
learning about subnets 10.1.33.0/24 and 10.1.44.0/24. The example shows the pertinent 
conﬁguration on each router for perspective, as well as show commands that point out the 
problems.

Example 11-2
EIGRP Problems on R3 and R4 (Continued)

Interfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol     415
The root cause of R3’s problem is that R3 has a network 10.1.13.3 0.0.0.0 conﬁguration 
command, which does not match R3’s 10.1.33.3 Fa0/1 IP address. If the conﬁguration was 
not available in the exam question, the show ip protocols command could be used to 
essentially see the same conﬁguration details. In this case, the show ip protocols command 
on R3 lists the text “10.1.13.3/32” as a reference to the contents of the incorrect network 
command’s parameters. As a result, R3 does not try to ﬁnd neighbors on its Fa0/1 interface, 
which is not a big deal in this case, but R3 also does not advertise subnet 10.1.33.0/24, the 
connected subnet off its Fa0/1 interface. Also note that R3’s show ip eigrp interfaces 
command omits interface Fa0/1, which does not by itself determine the root cause, but it 
can help you isolate the problem.
On R4, the engineer could have correctly used a passive-interface fastethernet0/1 router 
subcommand, because no other routers should exist off R4’s Fa0/1 interface. However, the 
engineer mistakenly referred to R4’s Fa0/0 interface instead of Fa0/1. R4’s show ip eigrp 
interfaces command purposefully omits the (Fa0/0) passive interface, and the highlighted 
part of R4’s show ip protocols command output lists Fa0/0 as a passive interface. Because 
R4’s Fa0/0 is passive, R4 does not even attempt to become neighbors with other routers on 
the same LAN.
OSPF Interface Troubleshooting Example
OSPF has the same basic requirements as EIGRP for interfaces, with a few exceptions. 
First, EIGRP routers need to use the same ASN or process ID as their neighboring routers, 
as conﬁgured in the router global conﬁguration command. OSPF routers can use any

process ID, with no need to match their neighbors. Second, OSPF requires that the 
interfaces connected to the same subnet be assigned to the same OSPF area, whereas 
EIGRP has no concept of areas.
Example 11-3 shows a mostly working OSPF internetwork, again based on Figure 11-2. 
The following problems exist:
R2 has been conﬁgured to put both interfaces in area 1. R1, R3, and R4 have 
been conﬁgured to put their common LAN interfaces (Fa0/0 in each case) in 
area 0, breaking OSPF design rules.
Example 11-3 shows how to isolate the root cause of the problem. It also shows the normal 
working output, with the show ip ospf interface brief and show ip protocols commands.

For OSPF, the show ip ospf interface brief command lists output similar to the show ip 
eigrp interface command, with one line for each enabled interface. (The show ip ospf 
interface command, not shown in the example, lists detailed OSPF information for each 
interface.) In this example, both R1 and R2 have OSPF enabled on both LAN interfaces, 
but this command also lists the area number for each interface, with R2 having both LAN 
interfaces in area 1. As a result, R2’s Fa0/0 interface is in a different area than the other three 
routers’ interfaces on the same LAN.
A closer look at R2’s show ip protocols command output, particularly the highlighted 
portion, points out the conﬁguration error. The highlighted phrase “10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 
area 1” is actually the exact syntax of the one network command on router R2, minus the 
word “network.” Reconﬁguring R2 so that its Fa0/0 interface matches the other three 
routers would solve this particular problem.
The end of the example shows an unsolicited log message generated by router R2, notifying 
the console user that this router has received a Hello from a router in a different area.
As you check the interfaces, you could also check several other details mentioned in 
Chapter 7’s IP troubleshooting coverage. It makes sense to go ahead and check the interface 
IP addresses, masks, and interface status, using the show interfaces and show ip interface 
brief commands. In particular, it is helpful to note which interfaces are up/up, because a 
routing protocol will not attempt to ﬁnd neighbors or advertise connected subnets for an 
interface that is not in an up/up state. These veriﬁcation checks were discussed in detail in 
Chapter 7, so they are not repeated here.

OSPF Problems on R2 (Continued)

418     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
Neighbor Relationships
As mentioned near the beginning of this chapter, when a routing protocol has been enabled 
on an interface, and the interface is not conﬁgured as a passive interface, the routing 
protocol attempts to discover neighbors and form a neighbor relationship with each 
neighbor that shares the common subnet. This section examines the large number of facts 
that each router must check with each potential neighbor before the two routers become 
neighbors.
OSPF and EIGRP both use Hello messages to learn about new neighbors and to exchange 
information used to perform some basic veriﬁcation checks. For example, as just shown in 
Example 11-3, an OSPF router should not become neighbors with another router in another 
area, because all routers on a common subnet should be in the same area by design. (The 
border between areas is a router, not a link.)
After an EIGRP or OSPF router hears a Hello from a new neighbor, the routing protocol 
examines the information in the Hello, along with some local settings, to decide if the two 
neighbors should even attempt to become neighbors. Because there is no formal term for 
all these items that a routing protocol considers, this book just calls them neighbor 
requirements. Table 11-2 lists the neighbor requirements for both EIGRP and OSPF. 
Following the table, the next few pages examine some of these settings for both EIGRP and 
OSPF, again using examples based on Figure 11-2.
1Having duplicate EIGRP RIDs does not prevent routers from becoming neighbors, but it can cause problems when 
external EIGRP routes are added to the routing table.

Neighbor Relationships     419
Unlike the rest of the neighbor requirements listed in Table 11-2, the ﬁrst requirement has 
very little to do with the routing protocols themselves. The two routers must be able to send 
packets to each other over the physical network to which they are both connected. To do 
that, the router interfaces must be up/up. In practice, before examining the rest of the details 
of why two routers do not become neighbors, conﬁrm that the two routers can ping each 
other on the local subnet. If the ping fails, investigate all the Layer 1, 2, and 3 issues that 
could prevent the ping from working (such as an interface not being up/up), as covered in 
various chapters of this book and in CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation 
Guide.
Because the details differ slightly between the two routing protocols, this section ﬁrst 
examines EIGRP, followed by OSPF.
EIGRP Neighbor Requirements
Any two EIGRP routers that connect to the same data link, and whose interfaces have been 
enabled for EIGRP and are not passive, will at least consider becoming neighbors. To 
quickly and deﬁnitively know which potential neighbors have passed all the neighbor 
requirements for EIGRP, just look at the output of the show ip eigrp neighbors command. 
This command lists only neighbors that have passed all the neighbor veriﬁcation checks. 
Example 11-4 shows an example, with the four routers from Figure 11-2 again, but with all 
earlier EIGRP conﬁguration problems having been ﬁxed.
NOTE
Even though it is important to study and remember the items in this table, it may 
be best not to study this table right now. Instead, read the rest of the chapter ﬁrst, because 
the items in the table will be mentioned and reviewed throughout the rest of this chapter.
NOTE
This section assumes that the routing protocol has actually been enabled on 
each required interface, as covered earlier in this chapter in the section titled “Interfaces 
Enabled with a Routing Protocol.”

420     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
If the show ip eigrp neighbors command does not list one or more expected neighbors, and 
the two routers can ping each other’s IP address on their common subnet, the problem is 
probably related to one of the neighbor requirements listed in Tables 11-2 and 11-3. Table 
11-3 summarizes the EIGRP neighbor requirements and notes the best commands with 
which to determine which requirement is the root cause of the problem.
All the requirements listed in Table 11-3, except the last one, were explained in Chapter 10. 
EIGRP K-values refer to the parameters that can be conﬁgured to change what EIGRP uses 
in its metric calculation. Cisco recommends leaving these values at their default settings, 
using only bandwidth and delay in the metric calculation. Because Cisco recommends that 
you not change these values, this particular problem is not very common. However, you can 
check the K-values on both routers with the show ip protocols command.
Example 11-5 shows three problems that can cause two routers that should become EIGRP 
neighbors to fail to do so. For this example, the following problems have been introduced:
■
R2 has been conﬁgured with IP address 10.1.2.2/24, in a different subnet than R1, R3, 
and R4.
■
R3 has been conﬁgured to use ASN 199 with the router eigrp 199 command, instead 
of ASN 99, as used on the other three routers.
■
R4 has been conﬁgured to use MD5 authentication, like the other routers, but R4 has a 
key value of “FRED” instead of the value “fred,” used by the other three routers.
R1 can actually detect two of the problems without having to use commands on the other 
routers. R1 generates an unsolicited log message for the mismatched subnet problem, and 
a debug command on R1 can reveal the authentication failure. A quick examination of a 
few show commands on R3 can identify that the wrong ASN has been used in the router 
conﬁguration command. Example 11-5 shows the details.

Neighbor Relationships     421
OSPF Neighbor Requirements
Similar to EIGRP, a router’s show ip ospf neighbor command lists all the neighboring 
routers that have met all the requirements to become an OSPF neighbor as listed in Table 
11-2—with one minor exception (mismatched MTU). (If the MTU is mismatched, the two 
routers are listed in the show ip ospf neighbor command. This particular problem is 
discussed later, in the section “The MTU Matching Requirement.”) So, the ﬁrst step in 
troubleshooting OSPF neighbors is to look at the list of neighbors.
Example 11-5

422     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
Example 11-6 lists the output of a show ip ospf neighbor command on router R2, from 
Figure 11-2, with the conﬁguration correct on each of the four routers in the ﬁgure.
A brief review of OSPF neighbor states (as explained in Chapter 9) can help you understand 
a few of the subtleties of the output in the example. A router’s listed status for each of its 
OSPF neighbors—the neighbor’s state—should settle into either a two-way or Full state 
under normal operation. For neighbors that do not need to directly exchange their 
databases, typically two non-DR routers on a LAN, the routers should settle into a two-way 
neighbor state. In most cases, two neighboring routers need to directly exchange their 
complete full LSDBs with each other. As soon as that process has been completed, the two 
routers settle into a Full neighbor state. In Example 11-6, router R4 is the DR, and R1 is the 
BDR, so R2 and R3 (as non-DRs) do not need to directly exchange routes. Therefore, R2’s 
neighbor state for R3 (RID 3.3.3.3) in Example 11-6 is listed as two-way.
If the show ip ospf neighbor command does not list one or more expected neighbors, 
before moving on to look at OSPF neighbor requirements, you should conﬁrm that the two 
routers can ping each other on the local subnet. As soon as the two neighboring routers can 
ping each other, if the two routers still do not become OSPF neighbors, the next step is to 
examine each of the OSPF neighbor requirements. Table 11-4 summarizes the 
requirements, listing the most useful commands with which to ﬁnd the answers.

NOTE
Notably, OSPF neighbors do not have to use the same process ID on the router 
ospf process-id command to become neighbors. In Example 11-6, all four routers use 
different process IDs.

The rest of this section looks at a couple of examples in which two OSPF routers could 
become neighbors but do not because of some of the reasons in the table. This is followed 
by information on the MTU matching requirement.
OSPF Neighbor Example 1
In this ﬁrst example of OSPF neighbor problems, the usual four-router network from Figure 
11-2 is used. This internetwork is designed to use a single area, area 0. In this case, the 
following problems have been introduced into the design:
■
R2 has been conﬁgured with both LAN interfaces in area 1, whereas the other three 
routers’ Fa0/0 interfaces are assigned to area 0.
■
R3 is using the same RID (1.1.1.1) as R1.
■
R4 is using MD5 authentication like the other three routers, but R4 has misconﬁgured 
its authentication key value (FRED instead of fred).
Example 11-7 shows the evidence of the problems, with comments following the example.

424     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
As noted in Table 11-4, the debug ip ospf adj command helps troubleshoot mismatched 
OSPF area problems as well as authentication problems. The highlighted messages in the 
ﬁrst few lines of the example point out that the router with address 10.1.1.2 (R2) has a 
mismatched area ID 0.0.0.1, meaning area 1. Indeed, R2 was misconﬁgured to put its 
Fa0/0 interface in area 1. Immediately following is a reference to a “mismatched 
authentication key,” meaning that the correct authentication type was used, but the 
conﬁgured keys have different values, speciﬁcally for router 10.1.1.4 (R4).
The next part of the example shows the show ip ospf interface brief command on both R1 
and R2, pointing out how each router’s Fa0/0 interface is in a different OSPF area.
The end of the example lists the information that shows R1 and R3 both trying to use RID 
1.1.1.1. Interestingly, both routers automatically generate a log message for the duplicate 
OSPF RID problem between R1 and R3. A duplicate RID causes signiﬁcant problems with 
OSPF, far beyond just whether two routers can become neighbors. The end of Example 
11-7 shows the (highlighted) log message. The show ip ospf commands on both R3 and R1

by default. To see these messages from a Telnet or SSH connection, use the terminal 
monitor command. To disable the display of these messages, use the terminal no 
monitor command.

also show how you can easily list the RID on each router, noting that they both use the same 
value.
OSPF Neighbor Example 2
In this next example, the same network from Figure 11-2 is used again. The problems on 
R2, R3, and R4 from the previous example have been ﬁxed, but new problems have been 
introduced on R2 and R4 to show the symptoms. In this case, the following problems have 
been introduced into the design:
■
R2 has been conﬁgured with a Hello/Dead timer of 5/20 on its Fa0/0 interface, instead 
of the 10/40 used (by default) on R1, R3, and R4.
■
R3’s problems have been solved; no problems related to OSPF neighbors exist.
■
R4 is now using the correct key string (fred), but with clear-text authentication instead 
of the MD5 authentication used by the other three routers.
Example 11-8 shows the evidence of the problems, with comments following the example. 
As usual, the debug ip ospf adj command helps discover authentication problems. Also, 
the debug ip ospf hello command helps uncover mismatches discovered in the Hello 
message, including mismatched IP addresses/masks and timers.

426     Chapter 11: Troubleshooting Routing Protocols
The example begins with the debug messages related to the authentication problem 
between R1, which uses MD5 authentication, and R4, which now uses clear-text 
authentication. As listed in Chapter 9’s Table 9-4, IOS considers OSPF clear-text 
authentication to be type 1 authentication and MD5 to be type 2. The highlighted debug 
message conﬁrms that thinking, stating that R1 received a packet from 10.1.1.4 (R4), with 
type 1 authentication, but with R1 expecting type 2 authentication.
Next, the example shows the messages generated by the debug ip ospf hello command—
speciﬁcally, those related to the Hello/Dead timer mismatch. The highlighted message uses 
a “C” to mean “conﬁgured value”—in other words, the value on the local router, or R1 in 
this case. The “R” in the message means “Received value,” or the value listed in the 
received Hello. In this case, the phrase “Dead R 20 C 40” means that the router that 
generated this message, R1, received a Hello with a Dead timer set to 20, but R1’s 
conﬁgured value on the interface is 40, so the values don’t match. Similarly, the message 
shows the mismatch in the Hello timers as well. Note that any IP subnet mismatch problems 
could also be found with this same debug, based on the received and conﬁgured subnet 
masks.
The majority of the space in the example shows the output of the show ip ospf interface 
command on both R1 and R2, which lists the Hello and Dead timers on each interface, 
conﬁrming the details listed in the debug messages.

Neighbor Relationships     427
The MTU Matching Requirement
Of all the potential problems between two potential OSPF neighbors listed in Table 11-2, 
only one problem, the mismatched MTU problem, allows the neighbor to be listed in the 
other router’s show ip ospf neighbor command output. When two routers connect to the 
same subnet, with different interface IP MTU settings, the two routers can become 
neighbors and reach the two-way state. However, when the two routers attempt to exchange 
LSDBs, the database exchange process fails because of the MTU mismatch.
When the MTU mismatch occurs, the routers typically move between a few neighbor states 
while trying to overcome the problem. The most common state is the Exchange state, as 
shown in Example 11-9. In this case, R1 and R3 have no other problems that prevent them 
from becoming OSPF neighbors, except that R3 has been conﬁgured with an IP MTU of 
1200 bytes on its Fa0/0 interface, instead of the default 1500 used by R1.
The state typically cycles from Exchange state, back to Init state, and then back to 
Exchange state.

Foundation Topics
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) deﬁnes a data-link protocol with many features besides just 
helping two devices send data over the link. This chapter starts by explaining the many PPP 
features available on routers, followed by PPP conﬁguration, including the conﬁguration of 
PPP authentication. The chapter ends with a section on troubleshooting serial links, 
covering a wide variety of topics, including PPP.
PPP Concepts
PPP provides several basic but important functions that are useful on a leased line that 
connects two devices, as reviewed in the following list:
■
Deﬁnition of a header and trailer that allows delivery of a data frame over the link
■
Support for both synchronous and asynchronous links
■
A protocol type ﬁeld in the header, allowing multiple Layer 3 protocols to pass over 
the same link

The next several pages take a closer look at the protocol ﬁeld, authentication, and the 
control protocols.
The PPP Protocol Field
One of the more important features included in the PPP standard, but not in the HDLC 
standard, is the protocol ﬁeld. The protocol ﬁeld identiﬁes the type of packet inside the

frame. When PPP was created, this ﬁeld allowed packets from the many different Layer 3 
protocols to pass over a single link. Today, the protocol type ﬁeld still provides the same 
function, even for the support of two different versions of IP (IPv4 and IPv6). Figure 12-1 
compares the framing details of HDLC and PPP, showing the proprietary HDLC Protocol 
ﬁeld and the standardized PPP Protocol ﬁeld.
Figure 12-1
PPP and HDLC Framing
PPP deﬁnes a set of Layer 2 control messages that perform various link control functions. 
These control functions fall into two main categories:
■
Those needed regardless of the Layer 3 protocol sent across the link
■
Those speciﬁc to each Layer 3 protocol
The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) implements the control functions that work the same 
regardless of the Layer 3 protocol. For features related to any higher-layer protocols, 
typically Layer 3 protocols, PPP uses a series of PPP control protocols (CP), such as IP 
Control Protocol (IPCP). PPP uses one instance of LCP per link, and one CP for each Layer 
3 protocol deﬁned on the link. For example, on a PPP link using IPv4, IPv6, and Cisco 
Discovery Protocol (CDP), the link uses one instance of LCP, plus IPCP (for IPv4), IPv6CP 
(for IPv6), and CDPCP (for CDP).
The next section ﬁrst summarizes the functions of LCP and then explains one of those 
functions, authentication, in more detail.
PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP)
LCP provides four notable features, which are covered in this chapter. Table 12-2 
summarizes the functions, gives the LCP feature names, and describes the features brieﬂy. 
Following the table, the text explains each feature in more detail. Note that the features

Looped Link Detection
Error detection and looped link detection are two key features of PPP. Looped link detection 
allows for faster convergence when a link fails because it is looped. What does “looped” 
mean? Well, to test a circuit, the phone company might loop the circuit. The telco technician 
can sit at his desk and, using commands, cause the phone company’s switch to loop the 
circuit. This means that the phone company takes the electrical signal sent by the CPE 
device and sends the same electrical current right back to the same device.
The routers cannot send bits to each other while the link is looped, of course. However, the 
router might not notice that the link is looped, because the router is still receiving something 
over the link! PPP helps the router recognize a looped link quickly so that it can bring down 
the interface and possibly use an alternative route.
In some cases, routing protocol convergence can be sped up by LCP’s recognition of the 
loop. If the router can immediately notice that the link is looped, it can put the interface in 
a “down and down” status, and the routing protocols can change their routing updates based 
on the fact that the link is down. If a router does not notice that the link has been looped, 
the routing protocol must wait for timeouts—things such as not hearing from the router on 
the other end of the link for some period of time.
LCP notices looped links quickly using a feature called magic numbers. When using PPP, 
the router sends PPP LCP messages instead of Cisco-proprietary keepalives across the link; 
these messages include a magic number, which is different on each router. If a line is 
looped, the router receives an LCP message with its own magic number instead of getting 
a message with the other router’s magic number. When a router receives its own magic 
number, that router knows that the frame it sent has been looped back, so the router can take 
down the interface, which speeds convergence.

PPP Concepts     439
Enhanced Error Detection
Similar to many other data-link protocols, PPP uses an FCS ﬁeld in the PPP trailer to 
determine if an individual frame has an error. If a frame is received in error, it is discarded. 
However, PPP can monitor the frequency with which frames are received in error so that it 
can take down an interface if too many errors occur.
PPP LCP analyzes the error rates on a link using a PPP feature called Link Quality 
Monitoring (LQM). LCP at each end of the link sends messages describing the number of 
correctly received packets and bytes. The router that sent the packets compares this number 
of in-error frames to the number of frames and bytes it sent, and it calculates percentage 
loss. The router can take down the link after a conﬁgured error rate has been exceeded.
The only time LQM helps is when you have redundant routes in the network. By taking 
down a link that has many errors, you can cause packets to use an alternative path that might 
not have as many errors.
PPP Multilink
When multiple PPP links exist between the same two routers—referred to as parallel 
links—the routers must then determine how to use those links. With HDLC links, and with 
PPP links using the simplest conﬁguration, the routers must use Layer 3 load balancing. 
This means that the routers have multiple routes for the same destination subnets. For 
example, the upper part of Figure 12-2 shows the load-balancing effect on R1 when 
forwarding packets to subnet 192.168.3.0/24.
Figure 12-2
Load Balancing Without Multilink PPP
The ﬁgure shows two packets, one large and one small. Using Layer 3 logic, the router may 
choose to send one packet over one link, and the next packet over another. However, 
because the packets might be of different sizes, the router may not balance the trafﬁc 
equally over each link. In some cases, particularly when most packets are sent to just a few 
destination hosts, the numbers of packets sent over each link might not even be balanced, 
which may overload one of the links and leave another link idle.

Multilink PPP load-balances the trafﬁc equally over the links while allowing the Layer 3 
logic in each router to treat the parallel links as a single link. When encapsulating a packet, 
PPP fragments the packet into smaller frames, sending one fragment over each link. For 
example, for the network shown in Figure 12-2, with two links, R1 would create two frames 
for each Layer 3 packet, with each frame holding roughly half the original packet. Then, 
PPP sends one fragment of each original packet over each of the two links. By sending 
about half of each packet over each link, multilink PPP can more evenly load-balance the 
trafﬁc. As an added beneﬁt, multilink PPP allows the Layer 3 routing tables to use a single 
route that refers to the combined links, keeping the routing table smaller. For example, in 
Figure 12-2, R1 would instead use one route for subnet 192.168.3.0/24, referring to the 
group of interfaces as a concept called a multilink group.
PPP Authentication
The term authentication refers to a set of security functions that help one device conﬁrm 
that the other device should be allowed to communicate and is not some imposter. For 
instance, if R1 and R2 are supposed to be communicating over a serial link, R1 might want 
R2 to somehow prove that it really is R2. Authentication provides a way to prove one’s 
identity.
WAN authentication is most often needed when dial lines are used. However, the 
conﬁguration of the authentication features remains the same whether a leased line or dial 
line is used.
PAP and CHAP authenticate the endpoints on either end of a point-to-point serial link. 
CHAP is the preferred method today because the identiﬁcation process uses values hidden 
with a Message Digest 5 (MD5) one-way hash, which is more secure than the clear-text 
passwords sent by PAP.
Both PAP and CHAP require the exchange of messages between devices. When a dialed 
line is used, the dialed-to router expects to receive a username and password from the 
dialing router with both PAP and CHAP. With a leased line, typically both routers mutually 
authenticate the other router. Whether leased line or dial, with PAP, the username and 
password are sent in the ﬁrst message. With CHAP, the protocol begins with a message 
called a challenge, which asks the other router to send its username and password. Figure 
12-3 outlines the different processes in the case where the links are dialed. The process 
works the same when the link uses a leased line.

PPP Concepts     441
Figure 12-3
PAP and CHAP Authentication Process
PAP ﬂows are much less secure than CHAP because PAP sends the hostname and password 
in clear text in the message. These can be read easily if someone places a tracing tool in the 
circuit. CHAP instead uses a one-way hash algorithm, with input to the algorithm being a 
password that never crosses the link, plus a shared random number. The CHAP challenge 
states the random number; both routers are preconﬁgured with the password. The 
challenged router runs the hash algorithm using the just-learned random number and the 
secret password and sends the results back to the router that sent the challenge. The router 
that sent the challenge runs the same algorithm using the random number (sent across the 
link) and the password (not sent across the link). If the results match, the passwords must 
match.
The most interesting part of the CHAP process is that at no time does the password itself 
ever cross the link. With the random number, the hash value is different every time. So even 
if someone sees the calculated hash value using a trace tool, the value is meaningless as a 
way to break in next time. CHAP authentication is difﬁcult to break, even with a tracing 
tool on the WAN link.

PPP Configuration
This section examines how to conﬁgure PPP and then how to add CHAP conﬁguration. At 
the same time, this section also examines a couple of commands that help verify if PPP is 
up and working.
Basic PPP Configuration
Conﬁguring PPP requires only the encapsulation ppp command on both ends of the link. 
To change back to use the default of HDLC, the engineer just needs to use the 
encapsulation hdlc command on both ends of the link as well. However, besides this basic 
conﬁguration, the physical serial link needs to be ordered and installed. This section 
assumes that the physical link has been installed and is working. If you want to read more 
details about the physical link, refer to Chapter 17 of CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide, or to the copy of that chapter included as this book’s CD-only 
Appendix I.
Example 12-1 shows a simple conﬁguration using the two routers shown in Figure 12-4. 
The example includes the IP address conﬁguration, but the IP addresses do not have to be 
conﬁgured for PPP to work. Because most installations will use IP, the conﬁguration is 
added for some perspectives in the show commands in the second part of the example.

PPP Configuration     443
This example shows the simple conﬁguration, with both routers needing to use PPP 
encapsulation. If either router defaulted to use HDLC, and the other conﬁgured PPP as 
shown, the link would not come up, staying in an “up and down” interface state.
The show interfaces command at the bottom of the example shows the normal output when 
the link is up and working. The second interface status code typically refers to the data-link 
status, with the “up” value meaning that the data link is working. Additionally, a few lines 
into the output, the highlighted phrases show that PPP is indeed conﬁgured, and that LCP 
has completed its work successfully, as noted with the “LCP Open” phrase. Additionally, 
the output lists the fact that two CPs, CDPCP and IPCP, have also successfully been 
enabled—all good indications that PPP is working properly.
CHAP Configuration and Verification
The simplest version of CHAP conﬁguration requires only a few commands. The 
conﬁguration uses a password conﬁgured on each router. As an alternative, the password 
could be conﬁgured on an external Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) 
server outside the router. The conﬁguration steps are as follows:
Step 1 Conﬁgure the routers’ hostnames using the hostname name global conﬁguration 
command.
Step 2 Conﬁgure the name of the other router, and the shared secret password, 
using the username name password password global conﬁguration 
command.
Step 3 Enable CHAP on the interface on each router using the ppp 
authentication chap interface subcommand.
Example 12-2 shows a sample conﬁguration, using the same two routers as the previous 
example (see Figure 12-4).

Basic PPP Conﬁguration (Continued)

444     Chapter 12: Point-to-Point WANs
The commands themselves are not complicated, but it is easy to misconﬁgure the 
hostnames and passwords. Notice that each router refers to the other router’s hostname in 
the username command, but both routers must conﬁgure the same password value. Also, 
not only are the passwords (mypass in this case) case-sensitive, but the hostnames, as 
referenced in the username command, also are also case-sensitive.
Because CHAP is a function of LCP, if the authentication process fails, LCP does not 
complete, and the interface falls to an “up and down” interface state.
PAP Configuration
PAP uses the exact same conﬁguration commands as CHAP, except that the ppp 
authentication pap command is used instead of ppp authentication chap. The rest of the 
veriﬁcation commands work the same, regardless of which of the two types of 
authentication are used. For example, if PAP authentication fails, LCP fails, and the link 
settles into an “up and down” state.
Cisco IOS Software also supports the capability to conﬁgure the router to ﬁrst try one 
authentication method and, if the other side does not respond, try the other option. For 
example, the ppp authentication chap pap interface subcommand tells the router to send 
CHAP messages, and if no reply is received, to try PAP. Note that the second option is not 
tried if the CHAP messages ﬂow between the two devices, and the result is that 
authentication failed. It uses the other option only if the other device does not send back 
any messages.

more details about troubleshooting CHAP issues.

Troubleshooting Serial Links     445
attempt to repeat the IP troubleshooting coverage in Parts II and III of this book, but it does 
point out some of the possible symptoms on a serial link when a Layer 3 subnet mismatch 
occurs on opposite ends of a serial link, which prevents the routers from routing packets 
over the serial link.
A simple ping command can determine whether a serial link can or cannot forward IP 
packets. A ping of the other router’s serial IP address—for example, a working ping 
192.168.2.2 command on R1 in Figure 12-4—proves that the link either works or does not.
If the ping does not work, the problem could be related to functions at OSI Layer 1, 2, or 
3. The best way to isolate which layer is the most likely cause is to examine the interface 
status codes described in Table 12-3. (As a reminder, router interfaces have two status 
codes—line status and protocol status.)
The serial link veriﬁcation and troubleshooting process should begin with a simple three-
step process:
Step 1 From one router, ping the other router’s serial IP address.
Step 2 If the ping fails, examine the interface status on both routers, and 
investigate problems related to the likely problem areas listed in Table 
12-4 (shown later in this chapter).
Step 3 If the ping works, also verify that any routing protocols are exchanging 
routes over the link.
The rest of this chapter explores the speciﬁc items to be examined when the ping fails, 
based on the combinations of interface status codes listed in Table 12-3.

Troubleshooting Layer 1 Problems
The interface status codes, or interface state, play a key role in isolating the root cause of 
problems on serial links. In fact, the status on both ends of the link may differ, so it is 
important to examine the status on both ends of the link to help determine the problem.
One simple and easy-to-ﬁnd Layer 1 problem occurs when either one of the two routers has 
administratively disabled its serial interface with the shutdown interface subcommand. If 
a router’s serial interface is in an administratively down line status, the solution is simple—
just conﬁgure a no shutdown interface conﬁguration command on the interface. Also, if 
one router’s interface has a line status of down, the other router may be shut down, so check 
both sides of the link.
The combination of a down line status on both ends of the serial link typically points to a 
Layer 1 problem. The following list describes the most likely reasons:
■
The leased line is down (a telco problem).
■
The line from the telco is not plugged in to either or both CSU/DSUs.
■
A CSU/DSU has failed or is misconﬁgured.
■
A serial cable from a router to its CSU/DSU is disconnected or faulty.
The details of how to further isolate these four problems is beyond the scope of this book.
Interestingly, one other common physical layer problem can occur that results in both 
routers’ interfaces being in an up/down state. On a back-to-back serial link, if the required 
clock rate command is missing on the router with a DCE cable installed, both routers’ 
serial interfaces will fail and end up with a line status of up but a line protocol status of 
down. Example 12-3 shows just such an example, pointing out a couple of ways to check 
to see if a missing clock rate command is the problem. The two best ways to ﬁnd this 
problem are to notice the absence of the clock rate command on the router with the DCE 
cable, and to note the “no clock” phrase in the output of the show controllers serial 
command. (This example shows R1 from Figure 12-4, with the clock rate command 
removed.)

Troubleshooting Layer 2 Problems
When both routers’ serial line status is up, but at least one of the routers’ line protocol status 
(the second interface status code) either is down or continually switches between up and 
down, the interface probably has one of two types of data link layer problems. This section 
explains both problems, which are summarized in Table 12-4.
The ﬁrst of these two problems—a mismatch between the conﬁgured data-link protocols—
is easy to identify and ﬁx. The show interfaces command lists the encapsulation type in the 
seventh line of the output, so using this command on both routers can quickly identify the 
problem. Alternatively, a quick look at the conﬁguration, plus remembering that HDLC is

NOTE
Some recent IOS releases actually prevent the user from removing the clock 
rate command on the interface if a DCE cable or no cable is installed, in an effort to 
prevent the unintentional omission of the clock rate command. Also, IOS sometimes 
spells the clock rate command as the clockrate command; both are acceptable.

The other two root causes require a little more discussion to understand the issue and 
determine if they are the real root cause. The next two headings take a closer look at each.
Keepalive Failure
The second item relates to a feature called keepalive. The keepalive feature helps a router 
recognize when a link is no longer functioning so that the router can bring down the 
interface, hoping to then use an alternative IP route.
The keepalive function (by default) causes routers to send keepalive messages to each other 
every 10 seconds (the default setting). (Cisco deﬁnes a proprietary HDLC keepalive 
message, with PPP deﬁning a keepalive message as part of LCP.) This 10-second timer is 
the keepalive interval. If a router does not receive any keepalive messages from the other 
router for a number of keepalive intervals (three or ﬁve intervals by default, depending on 
the IOS version), the router brings down the interface, thinking that the interface is no 
longer working.
For real networks, it is useful to just leave keepalives enabled. However, you can make a 
mistake and turn off keepalives on one end of a serial link, leave them enabled on the other, 
and cause the link to fail. For example, if R1 were conﬁgured with the no keepalive 
interface subcommand, disabling keepalives, R1 would no longer send the keepalive 
messages. If R2 continued to default to use keepalives, R2 would keep sending keepalive 
messages, plus R2 would expect to receive keepalive messages from R1. After several 
keepalive intervals pass, R2, having not received any keepalive messages from R1, would 
change the interface to an “up and down” state. Then, R2 would continually bring the link 
back up, still not get any keepalives from R1, and then fall back to an “up and down” state 
again, and ﬂapping up and down repeatedly. R1, not caring about keepalives, would leave 
the interface in an “up and up” state the whole time. Example 12-4 shows this exact 
example, again with the routers in Figure 12-4.

PAP and CHAP Authentication Failure
As mentioned earlier, a failure in the PAP/CHAP authentication process results in both 
routers falling to an “up and down” state. To discover whether a PAP/CHAP failure is really 
the root cause, you can use the debug ppp authentication command. For perspective, 
Example 12-5 shows the output of this command when CHAP has been conﬁgured as in 
earlier Example 12-2, with CHAP working correctly in this case.

NOTE
It is a conﬁguration mistake to enable keepalives on only one end of a point-to-
point serial link. It appears that some very recent IOS versions notice when the keepalives 
are mistakenly disabled on one end of a link and prevent the problem described here from 
happening. For the CCNA exams, just be aware that keepalives should be enabled on both 
ends of the link, or disabled on both ends.

CHAP uses a three-message exchange, as shown back in Figure 12-3, with a set of 
messages ﬂowing for authentication in each direction by default. The three highlighted 
lines show the authentication process by which R1 authenticates R2; it begins with R1 
sending a challenge message. The ﬁrst highlighted message in Example 12-5 lists an “O,” 
meaning “output.” This indicates that the message is a challenge message and that it was 
sent from R1. The next highlighted message is the received response message (noted with 
an “I” for input), from R2. The last highlighted line is the third message, sent by R1, stating 
that the authentication was successful. You can see the same three messages for R2’s 
authentication of R1 in the output as well, but those messages are not highlighted in the 
example.
When CHAP authentication fails, the debug output shows a couple of fairly obvious 
messages. Example 12-6 shows the results using the same two-router internetwork shown 
in Figure 12-4, this time with the passwords misconﬁgured, so CHAP fails.
Troubleshooting Layer 3 Problems
This chapter suggests that the best starting place to troubleshoot serial links is to ping the 
IP address of the router on the other end of the link—speciﬁcally, the IP address on the 
serial link. Interestingly, the serial link can be in an “up and up” state but the ping can still 
fail because of Layer 3 misconﬁguration. In some cases, the ping may work, but the routing 
protocols may not be able to exchange routes. This short section examines the symptoms, 
which are slightly different depending on whether HDLC or PPP is used, and the root cause.
First, consider an HDLC link on which the physical and data-link details are working ﬁne. 
In this case, both routers’ interfaces are in an “up and up” state. However, if the IP addresses

Troubleshooting Serial Links     451
conﬁgured on the serial interfaces on the two routers are in different subnets, a ping to the 
IP address on the other end of the link will fail, because the routers do not have a matching 
route. For example, in Figure 12-4, if R1’s serial IP address remained 192.168.2.1, and R2’s 
was changed to 192.168.3.2 (instead of 192.168.2.2), still with a mask of /24, the two 
routers would have connected routes to different subnets. They not have a route matching 
the opposite router’s serial IP address.
Finding and ﬁxing a mismatched subnet problem with HDLC links is relatively simple. You 
can ﬁnd the problem by doing the usual ﬁrst step of pinging the IP address on the other end 
of the link, and failing. If both interface status codes on both routers’ interfaces are up, the 
problem is likely this mismatched IP subnet.
For PPP links, with the same IP address/mask misconﬁguration, both routers’ interfaces 
also are in an “up and up” state, but the ping to the other router’s IP address actually works. 
As it turns out, a router using PPP advertises its serial interface IP address to the other 
router, with a /32 preﬁx, which is a route to reach just that one host. So, both routers have 
a route with which to route packets to the other end of the link, even though two routers on 
opposite ends of a serial link have mismatched their IP addresses. For example, in Figure 
12-4 again, if R2’s IP address were 192.168.4.2/24, while R1’s remained 192.168.2.1/24, 
the two addresses would be in different subnets, but the pings would work because of PPP’s 
advertisement of the host routes. Example 12-7 shows this exact scenario.
NOTE
A route with a /32 preﬁx, representing a single host, is called a host route.

452     Chapter 12: Point-to-Point WANs
The ﬁrst highlighted line in the example shows the normal connected route on the serial 
link, for network 192.168.2.0/24. R1 thinks this subnet is the subnet connected to S0/0/1 
because of R1’s conﬁgured IP address (192.168.2.1/24). The second highlighted line shows 
the host route created by PPP, speciﬁcally for R2’s new serial IP address (192.168.4.2). (R2 
will have a similar route for 192.168.2.1/32, R1’s serial IP address.) So, both routers have 
a route to allow them to forward packets to the IP address on the other end of the link, which 
allows the ping to the other side of the serial link to work in spite of the addresses on each 
end being in different subnets.
Although the ping to the other end of the link works, the routing protocols still do not 
advertise routes because of the IP subnet mismatch on the opposite ends of the link. So, 
when troubleshooting a network problem, do not assume that a serial interface in an up/up 
state is fully working, or even that a serial interface over which a ping works is fully 
working. Also make sure the routing protocol is exchanging routes and that the IP addresses 
are in the same subnet. Table 12-5 summarizes the behavior on HDLC and PPP links when 
the IP addresses on each end do not reside in the same subnet but no other problems exist.

Frame Relay Concepts
Frame Relay remains the most popular WAN technology used today. However, its 
popularity is waning. It is being replaced mainly by virtual private network (VPN) 
technology of two main types: Internet VPNs, which use the Internet to transport packets, 
and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPNs, which follow the same basic service 
model as Frame Relay, typically offered by the same Frame Relay providers, but with 
signiﬁcant technical advantages. However, Frame Relay is still used by many companies 
today, and it can also be used to connect to MPLS and Internet VPNs, so Frame Relay will 
be an important networking topic for some time.
Frame Relay most closely compares to the OSI data link layer (Layer 2). If you remember 
that the word “frame” describes the data link layer protocol data unit (PDU), it will be easy 
to remember that Frame Relay relates to OSI Layer 2. Like other data-link protocols, Frame 
Relay can be used to deliver packets (Layer 3 PDUs) between routers. Frame Relay 
protocol headers and trailers are simply used to let a packet traverse the Frame Relay 
network, just like Ethernet headers and trailers are used to help a packet traverse an Ethernet 
segment.
This chapter describes Frame Relay protocol details. Chapter 14, “Frame Relay 
Conﬁguration and Troubleshooting,” examines the conﬁguration, veriﬁcation, and 
troubleshooting of Frame Relay networks.

Frame Relay Overview     461
Foundation Topics
With point-to-point serial links, a company orders a leased line, or circuit, between two 
points. The telco creates the circuit, installing a two-pair (four-wire) cable into the buildings 
on either end of the circuit. The telco creates the circuit so that it will run at the preset speed 
requested by the customer, typically some multiple of 64 kbps. As soon as the Telcos’ cable 
has been connected to a CSU/DSU, and a router, on each end of the circuit, the routers have 
a dedicated physical link, with the ability to send data in both directions simultaneously.
Frame Relay is a set of WAN standards that create a more efﬁcient WAN service as 
compared to point-to-point links, while still allowing pairs of routers to send data directly 
to each other. With leased lines, each leased line requires a serial interface on each router 
and a separate (and expensive) physical circuit built by the telco. Frame Relay supports the 
ability to send data to multiple remote routers over a single physical WAN circuit. For 
example, a company with one central site and ten remote sites would require ten leased 
lines to communicate with the main site and ten serial interfaces on the central site router. 
With Frame Relay, the main site could have a single leased line connecting it to the Frame 
Relay service, and a single serial interface on the router at the central site, and still be able 
to communicate with each of the ten remote-site routers.
The ﬁrst section of this chapter focuses on the basics of Frame Relay, including a lot of new 
terminology. The second section examines Frame Relay data-link addressing. This topic 
requires some attention because Frame Relay addresses are needed for both router 
conﬁguration and troubleshooting. The last two major sections of this chapter examine 
some network layer concerns when using Frame Relay, along with a few features that 
impact the speed and frame discard rates inside the Frame Relay cloud.
Frame Relay Overview
Frame Relay networks provide more features and beneﬁts than simple point-to-point WAN 
links, but to do that, Frame Relay protocols are more detailed. For example, Frame Relay 
networks are multiaccess networks, which means that more than two devices can attach to 
the network, similar to LANs. Unlike with LANs, you cannot send a data link layer 
broadcast over Frame Relay. Therefore, Frame Relay networks are called nonbroadcast 
multiaccess (NBMA) networks. Also, because Frame Relay is multiaccess, it requires the 
use of an address that identiﬁes to which remote router each frame is addressed.
Figure 13-1 outlines the basic physical topology and related terminology in a Frame Relay 
network.

462     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
Figure 13-1
Frame Relay Components
Figure 13-1 shows the most basic components of a Frame Relay network. A leased line is 
installed between the router and a nearby Frame Relay switch; this link is called the access 
link. To ensure that the link is working, the device outside the Frame Relay network, called 
the data terminal equipment (DTE), exchanges regular messages with the Frame Relay 
switch. These keepalive messages, along with other messages, are deﬁned by the Frame 
Relay Local Management Interface (LMI) protocol. The routers are considered DTE, and 
the Frame Relay switches are data communications equipment (DCE).
Whereas Figure 13-1 shows the physical connectivity at each connection to the Frame 
Relay network, Figure 13-2 shows the logical, or virtual, end-to-end connectivity 
associated with a virtual circuit (VC).
Figure 13-2
Frame Relay PVC Concepts
The logical communications path between each pair of DTEs is a VC. The trio of parallel 
lines in the ﬁgure represents a single VC; this book uses a thick dashed line style to make 
sure you notice the line easily. Typically, the service provider preconﬁgures all the required 
details of a VC; predeﬁned VCs are called permanent virtual circuits (PVC).
Routers use the data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI) as the Frame Relay address; it 
identiﬁes the VC over which the frame should travel. So, in Figure 13-2, when R1 needs to 
forward a packet to R2, R1 encapsulates the Layer 3 packet into a Frame Relay header and 
trailer and then sends the frame. The Frame Relay header includes the correct DLCI so that 
the provider’s Frame Relay switches correctly forward the frame to R2.

Frame Relay Terms and Concepts
Term
Description
Virtual circuit (VC)
A logical concept that represents the path that frames travel between DTEs. 
VCs are particularly useful when you compare Frame Relay to leased 
physical circuits.
Permanent virtual 
circuit (PVC)
A predeﬁned VC. A PVC can be equated to a leased line in concept.
Switched virtual 
circuit (SVC)
A VC that is set up dynamically when needed. An SVC can be equated to a 
dial connection in concept.
Data terminal 
equipment (DTE)
DTEs are connected to a Frame Relay service from a telecommunications 
company. They typically reside at sites used by the company buying the 
Frame Relay service.
Data communications 
equipment (DCE)
Frame Relay switches are DCE devices. DCEs are also known as data 
circuit-terminating equipment. DCEs are typically in the service provider’s 
network.
Access link
The leased line between the DTE and DCE.
Access rate (AR)
The speed at which the access link is clocked. This choice affects the 
connection’s price.
Committed 
Information Rate 
(CIR)
The speed at which bits can be sent over a VC, according to the business 
contract between the customer and provider.
Data-link connection 
identiﬁer (DLCI)
A Frame Relay address used in Frame Relay headers to identify the VC.
Nonbroadcast 
multiaccess (NBMA)
A network in which broadcasts are not supported, but more than two 
devices can be connected.
Local Management 
Interface (LMI)
The protocol used between a DCE and DTE to manage the connection. 
Signaling messages for SVCs, PVC status messages, and keepalives are all 
LMI messages.

Frame Relay Standards
The deﬁnitions for Frame Relay are contained in documents from the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 
The Frame Relay Forum (http://www.frforum.com), a vendor consortium, also deﬁnes 
several Frame Relay speciﬁcations, many of which predate the original ITU and ANSI 
speciﬁcations, with the ITU and ANSI picking up many of the forum’s standards. Table 13-
3 lists the most important of these speciﬁcations.
Virtual Circuits
Frame Relay provides signiﬁcant advantages over simply using point-to-point leased lines. 
The primary advantage has to do with virtual circuits. Consider Figure 13-3, which shows 
a typical Frame Relay network with three sites.

Frame Relay Overview     465
A virtual circuit deﬁnes a logical path between two Frame Relay DTEs. The term virtual 
circuit describes the concept well. It acts like a point-to-point circuit, providing the ability 
to send data between two endpoints over a WAN. There is no physical circuit directly 
between the two endpoints, so it’s virtual. For example, R1 terminates two VCs—one 
whose other endpoint is R2, and one whose other endpoint is R3. R1 can send trafﬁc 
directly to either of the other two routers by sending it over the appropriate VC.
VCs share the access link and the Frame Relay network. For example, both VCs 
terminating at R1 use the same access link. In fact, many customers share the same Frame 
Relay network. Originally, people with leased-line networks were reluctant to migrate to 
Frame Relay, because they would be competing with other customers for the provider’s 
capacity inside the cloud. To address these fears, Frame Relay is designed with the concept 
of a committed information rate (CIR). Each VC has a CIR, which is a guarantee by the 
provider that a particular VC gets at least that much bandwidth. So you can migrate from a 
leased line to Frame Relay, getting a CIR of at least as much bandwidth as you previously 
had with your leased line.
Interestingly, even with a three-site network, it’s probably less expensive to use Frame 
Relay than to use point-to-point links. Imagine an organization with 100 sites that needs 
any-to-any connectivity. How many leased lines are required? 4950! And besides that, the 
organization would need 99 serial interfaces per router if it used point-to-point leased lines. 
With Frame Relay, an organization could have 100 access links to local Frame Relay 
switches, one per router, and have 4950 VCs running over them. That requires a lot fewer 
actual physical links, and you would need only one serial interface on each router!
Service providers can build their Frame Relay networks more cost-effectively than for 
leased lines. As you would expect, that makes it less expensive for the Frame Relay 
customer as well. For connecting many WAN sites, Frame Relay is simply more cost-
effective than leased lines.
Two types of VCs are allowed—permanent (PVC) and switched (SVC). PVCs are 
predeﬁned by the provider; SVCs are created dynamically. PVCs are by far the more 
popular of the two. Frame Relay providers seldom offer SVCs as a service. (The rest of this 
chapter and Chapter 14 ignore SVCs.)
When the Frame Relay network is engineered, the design might not include a VC between 
each pair of sites. Figure 13-3 includes PVCs between each pair of sites; this is called a full-
mesh Frame Relay network. When not all pairs have a direct PVC, it is called a partial-mesh 
network. Figure 13-4 shows the same network as Figure 13-3, but this time with a partial 
mesh and only two PVCs. This is typical when R1 is at the main site and R2 and R3 are at 
remote ofﬁces that rarely need to communicate directly.

466     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
Figure 13-4
Typical Partial-Mesh Frame Relay Network
The partial mesh has some advantages and disadvantages compared to a full mesh. The 
primary advantage is that partial mesh is cheaper, because the provider charges per VC. The 
downside is that trafﬁc from R2’s site to R3’s site must go to R1 ﬁrst and then be forwarded. 
If that’s a small amount of trafﬁc, it’s a small price to pay. If it’s a lot of trafﬁc, a full mesh 
is probably worth the extra money, because trafﬁc going between two remote sites would 
have to cross R1’s access link twice.
One conceptual hurdle with PVCs is that there is typically a single access link across which 
multiple PVCs ﬂow. For example, consider Figure 13-4 from R1’s perspective. Server1 
sends a packet to Larry. It comes across the Ethernet. R1 gets it and matches Larry’s routing 
table, which tells him to send the packet out Serial0, which is R1’s access link. He 
encapsulates the packet in a Frame Relay header and trailer and then sends it. Which PVC 
does it use? The Frame Relay switch should forward it to R2, but why does it?
To solve this problem, Frame Relay uses an address to differentiate one PVC from another. 
This address is called a data-link connection identiﬁer (DLCI). The name is descriptive: 
The address is for an OSI Layer 2 (data-link) protocol, and it identiﬁes a VC, which is 
sometimes called a virtual connection. So, in this example, R1 uses the DLCI that identiﬁes 
the PVC to R2, so the provider forwards the frame correctly over the PVC to R2. To send 
frames to R3, R1 uses the DLCI that identiﬁes the VC for R3. DLCIs and how they work 
are covered in more detail later in this chapter.

LMI and Encapsulation Types
When you’re ﬁrst learning about Frame Relay, it’s often easy to confuse the LMI and the 
encapsulation used with Frame Relay. The LMI is a deﬁnition of the messages used 
between the DTE (for example, a router) and the DCE (for example, the Frame Relay 
switch owned by the service provider). The encapsulation deﬁnes the headers used by a 
DTE to communicate some information to the DTE on the other end of a VC. The switch 
and its connected router care about using the same LMI; the switch does not care about the 
encapsulation. The endpoint routers (DTE) do care about the encapsulation.
The most important LMI message relating to topics on the exam is the LMI status inquiry 
message. Status messages perform two key functions:
■
They perform a keepalive function between the DTE and DCE. If the access link has a 
problem, the absence of keepalive messages implies that the link is down.
■
They signal whether a PVC is active or inactive. Even though each PVC is predeﬁned, 
its status can change. An access link might be up, but one or more VCs could be down. 
The router needs to know which VCs are up and which are down. It learns that 
information from the switch using LMI status messages.
Three LMI protocol options are available in Cisco IOS software: Cisco, ITU, and ANSI. 
Each LMI option is slightly different and therefore is incompatible with the other two. As 
long as both the DTE and DCE on each end of an access link use the same LMI standard, 
LMI works ﬁne.
The differences between LMI types are subtle. For example, the Cisco LMI calls for the use 
of DLCI 1023, whereas ANSI T1.617-D and ITU Q.933-A specify DLCI 0. Some of the 
messages have different ﬁelds in their headers. The DTE simply needs to know which of 
the three LMIs to use so that it can use the same one as the local switch.
Conﬁguring the LMI type is easy. Today’s most popular option is to use the default LMI 
setting. This setting uses the LMI autosense feature, in which the router simply ﬁgures out 
which LMI type the switch is using. So you can simply let the router autosense the LMI and 
never bother coding the LMI type. If you choose to conﬁgure the LMI type, the router 
disables the autosense feature.
Table 13-4 outlines the three LMI types, their origin, and the keyword used in the Cisco IOS 
software frame-relay lmi-type interface subcommand.

468     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
A Frame Relay-connected router encapsulates each Layer 3 packet inside a Frame Relay 
header and trailer before it is sent out an access link. The header and trailer are deﬁned by 
the Link Access Procedure Frame Bearer Services (LAPF) speciﬁcation, ITU Q.922-A. The 
sparse LAPF framing provides error detection with an FCS in the trailer, as well as the 
DLCI, DE, FECN, and BECN ﬁelds in the header (which are discussed later). Figure 13-5 
diagrams the frame.
Figure 13-5
LAPF Header
However, the LAPF header and trailer do not provide all the ﬁelds typically needed by 
routers. In particular, Figure 13-5 does not show a Protocol Type ﬁeld. Each data-link 
header needs a ﬁeld to deﬁne the type of packet that follows the data-link header. If Frame 
Relay is using only the LAPF header, DTEs (including routers) cannot support 
multiprotocol trafﬁc, because there is no way to identify the type of protocol in the 
Information ﬁeld.
Two solutions were created to compensate for the lack of a Protocol Type ﬁeld in the 
standard Frame Relay header:
■
Cisco and three other companies created an additional header, which comes between 
the LAPF header and the Layer 3 packet shown in Figure 13-5. It includes a 2-byte 
Protocol Type ﬁeld, with values matching the same ﬁeld Cisco uses for HDLC.
■
RFC 1490 (which was later superceded by RFC 2427; you should know both 
numbers), Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay, deﬁned the second solution. 
RFC 1490 was written to ensure multivendor interoperability between Frame Relay 
DTEs. This RFC deﬁnes a similar header, also placed between the LAPF header and

Layer 3 packet, and includes a Protocol Type ﬁeld as well as many other options. ITU 
and ANSI later incorporated RFC 1490 headers into their Q.933 Annex E and T1.617 
Annex F speciﬁcations, respectively.
Figure 13-6 outlines these two alternatives.
Figure 13-6
Cisco and RFC 1490/2427 Encapsulation
DTEs use and react to the ﬁelds speciﬁed by these two types of encapsulation, but Frame 
Relay switches ignore these ﬁelds. Because the frames ﬂow from DTE to DTE, both DTEs 
should agree on the encapsulation used. The switches don’t care. However, each VC can 
use a different encapsulation. In the conﬁguration, the encapsulation created by Cisco is 
called cisco, and the other one is called ietf.
Now that you have a broad understanding of Frame Relay concepts and terminology, the 
next section takes a much closer look at Frame Relay DLCIs.
Frame Relay Addressing
Frame Relay deﬁnes the rules by which devices deliver Frame Relay frames across a Frame 
Relay network. Because a router uses a single access link that has many VCs connecting it 
to many routers, there must be something to identify each of the remote routers—in other 
words, an address. The DLCI is the Frame Relay address.
DLCIs work slightly differently from the other data-link addresses covered on the CCNA 
exams. This difference is mainly because of the use of the DLCI and the fact that the header 
has a single DLCI ﬁeld, not both Source and Destination DLCI ﬁelds.
Frame Relay Local Addressing
You should understand a few characteristics of DLCIs before we get into their use. Frame 
Relay DLCIs are locally signiﬁcant; this means that the addresses need to be unique only 
on the local access link. A popular analogy that explains local addressing is that there can 
be only a single street address of 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, but there

can be a 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue in every town in the United States. Likewise, DLCIs 
must be unique on each access link, but the same DLCI numbers can be used on every 
access link in your network. For example, in Figure 13-7, notice that DLCI 40 is used on 
two access links to describe two different PVCs. No conﬂict exists, because DLCI 40 is 
used on two different access links.
Figure 13-7
Frame Relay Addressing with Router A Sending to Routers B and C
Local addressing, which is the common term for the fact that DLCIs are locally signiﬁcant, 
is a fact. It is how Frame Relay works. Simply put, a single access link cannot use the same 
DLCI to represent multiple VCs on the same access link. Otherwise, the Frame Relay 
switch would not know how to forward frames correctly. For instance, in Figure 13-7, 
Router A must use different DLCI values for the PVCs on its local access link (41 and 42 
in this instance).
Frame Relay Global Addressing
Most people get confused about DLCIs the ﬁrst time they think about the local signiﬁcance 
of DLCIs and the existence of only a single DLCI ﬁeld in the Frame Relay header. Global 
addressing solves this problem by making DLCI addressing look like LAN addressing in 
concept. Global addressing is simply a way of choosing DLCI numbers when planning a 
Frame Relay network so that working with DLCIs is much easier. Because local addressing 
is a fact, global addressing does not change these rules. Global addressing just makes DLCI 
assignment more obvious—as soon as you get used to it.
Here’s how global addressing works: The service provider hands out a planning 
spreadsheet and a diagram. Figure 13-8 is an example of such a diagram, with the global 
DLCIs shown.

Figure 13-8
Frame Relay Global DLCIs
Global addressing is planned as shown in Figure 13-8, with the DLCIs placed in Frame 
Relay frames as shown in Figure 13-9. For example, Router A uses DLCI 41 when sending 
a frame to Router B, because Router B’s global DLCI is 41. Likewise, Router A uses DLCI 
42 when sending frames over the VC to Router C. The nice thing is that global addressing 
is much more logical to most people, because it works like a LAN, with a single MAC 
address for each device. On a LAN, if the MAC addresses are MAC-A, MAC-B, and MAC-
C for the three routers, Router A uses destination address MAC-B when sending frames to 
Router B and uses MAC-C as the destination to reach Router C. Likewise, with global 
DLCIs 40, 41, and 42 used for Routers A, B, and C, respectively, the same concept applies. 
Because DLCIs address VCs, the logic is something like this when Router A sends a frame 
to Router B: “Hey, local switch! When you get this frame, send it over the VC that we 
agreed to number with DLCI 41.” Figure 13-9 outlines this example.

472     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
Router A sends frames with DLCI 41, and they reach the local switch. The local switch sees 
the DLCI ﬁeld and forwards the frame through the Frame Relay network until it reaches the 
switch connected to Router B. Then Router B’s local switch forwards the frame out the 
access link to Router B. The same process happens between Router A and Router C when 
Router A uses DLCI 42. The beauty of global addressing is that you think of each router as 
having an address, like LAN addressing. If you want to send a frame to someone, you put 
his or her DLCI in the header, and the network delivers the frame to the correct DTE.
The ﬁnal key to global addressing is that the Frame Relay switches actually change the 
DLCI value before delivering the frame. Did you notice that Figure 13-9 shows a different 
DLCI value as the frames are received by Routers B and C? For example, Router A sends 
a frame to Router B, and Router A puts DLCI 41 in the frame. The last switch changes the 
ﬁeld to DLCI 40 before forwarding it to Router B. The result is that when Routers B and C 
receive their frames, the DLCI value is actually the sender’s DLCI. Why? Well, when 
Router B receives the frame, because the DLCI is 40, it knows that the frame came in on 
the PVC between itself and Router A. In general, the following are true:
■
The sender treats the DLCI ﬁeld as a destination address, using the destination’s global 
DLCI in the header.
■
The receiver thinks of the DLCI ﬁeld as the source address, because it contains the 
global DLCI of the frame’s sender.
Figure 13-9 describes what happens in a typical Frame Relay network. Service providers 
supply a planning spreadsheet and diagrams with global DLCIs listed. Table 13-5 gives you 
an organized view of what DLCIs are used in Figure 13-9.
Global addressing makes DLCI addressing more intuitive for most people. It also makes 
router conﬁguration more straightforward and lets you add new sites more conveniently. 
For instance, examine Figure 13-10, which adds Routers D and E to the network shown in 
Figure 13-9. The service provider simply states that global DLCIs 43 and 44 are used for 
these two routers. If these two routers also have only one PVC to Router A, all the DLCI

planning is complete. You know that Router D and Router E use DLCI 40 to reach Router 
A and that Router A uses DLCI 43 to reach Router D and DLCI 44 to reach Router E.
Figure 13-10
Adding Frame Relay Sites: Global Addressing
The remaining examples in this chapter use global addressing in any planning diagrams 
unless otherwise stated. One practical way to determine whether the diagram lists the local 
DLCIs or the global DLCI convention is this: If two VCs terminate at the same DTE, and 
a single DLCI is shown, it probably represents the global DLCI convention. If one DLCI is 
shown per VC, local DLCI addressing is depicted.
Now that you have a better understanding of how Frame Relay uses DLCIs to address each 
VC, causing the correct delivery of frames over a Frame Relay cloud, the next section 
moves up to Layer 3, examining the IP addressing conventions that can be used over Frame 
Relay.
Network Layer Concerns with Frame Relay
Frame Relay networks have both similarities and differences as compared to LAN and 
point-to-point WAN links. These differences introduce some additional considerations for 
passing Layer 3 packets across a Frame Relay network. You need to concern yourself with 
a couple of key issues relating to Layer 3 ﬂows over Frame Relay:

In particular, the Frame Relay implementation in Cisco deﬁnes three different options for 
assigning subnets and IP addresses on Frame Relay interfaces:
■
One subnet containing all Frame Relay DTEs
■
One subnet per VC
■
A hybrid of the ﬁrst two options
This section examines the three main options for IP addressing over Frame Relay, as well 
as broadcast handling, which impacts how routing protocols work over Frame Relay.
Frame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: One Subnet Containing All Frame 
Relay DTEs
Figure 13-11 shows the ﬁrst alternative, which is to use a single subnet for the Frame Relay 
network. This ﬁgure shows a fully meshed Frame Relay network because the single-subnet 
option is typically used when a full mesh of VCs exists. In a full mesh, each router has a 
VC to every other router, meaning that each router can send frames directly to every other 
router. This more closely resembles how a LAN works. So, a single subnet can be used for 
all the routers’ Frame Relay interfaces, as conﬁgured on the routers’ serial interfaces. Table 
13-6 summarizes the addresses used in Figure 13-11.

The single-subnet alternative is straightforward, and it conserves your IP address space. It 
also looks like what you are used to with LANs, which makes it easier to conceptualize. 
Unfortunately, most companies build partial-mesh Frame Relay networks, and the single-
subnet option has some deﬁciencies when the network is a partial mesh.
Frame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: One Subnet Per VC
The second IP addressing alternative, having a single subnet for each VC, works better with 
a partially meshed Frame Relay network, as shown in Figure 13-12. Boston cannot forward 
frames directly to Charlotte, because no VC is deﬁned between the two. This is a more 
typical Frame Relay network, because most organizations with many sites tend to group 
applications on servers at a few centralized locations, and most of the trafﬁc is between each 
remote site and those servers.
Figure 13-12
Partial Mesh with IP Addresses
The single-subnet-per-VC alternative matches the logic behind a set of point-to-point links. 
Using multiple subnets instead of one larger subnet wastes some IP addresses, but it 
overcomes some issues with distance vector routing protocols.

476     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
Table 13-7 shows the IP addresses for the partially meshed Frame Relay network shown in 
Figure 13-12.
Cisco IOS Software has a conﬁguration feature called subinterfaces that creates a logical 
subdivision of a physical interface. Subinterfaces allow the Atlanta router to have three IP 
addresses associated with its Serial0 physical interface by conﬁguring three separate 
subinterfaces. A router can treat each subinterface, and the VC associated with it, as if it 
were a point-to-point serial link. Each of the three subinterfaces of Serial0 on Atlanta would 
be assigned a different IP address from Table 13-7 (Chapter 14 shows several sample 
conﬁgurations).
Frame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: Hybrid Approach
The third alternative for Layer 3 addressing is a hybrid of the ﬁrst two alternatives. Consider 
Figure 13-13, which shows a trio of routers with VCs between each of them, as well as two 
other VCs to remote sites.
Two options exist for Layer 3 addressing in this case. The ﬁrst is to treat each VC as a 
separate Layer 3 group. In this case, ﬁve subnets are needed for the Frame Relay network. 
However, Routers A, B, and C create a smaller full mesh between each other. This allows 
Routers A, B, and C to use one subnet. The other two VCs—one between Routers A and D 
and one between Routers A and E—are treated as two separate Layer 3 groups. The result 
is a total of three subnets.

NOTE
The example uses IP address preﬁxes of /24 to keep the math simple. In 
production networks, point-to-point subinterfaces typically use a preﬁx of /30 (mask 
255.255.255.252), because that allows for only two valid IP addresses—the exact 
number needed on a point-to-point subinterface. Of course, using different masks in the 
same network means your routing protocol must also support VLSM.

Figure 13-13
Hybrid of Full and Partial Mesh
To accomplish either style of Layer 3 addressing in this third and ﬁnal case, subinterfaces 
are used. Point-to-point subinterfaces are used when a single VC is considered to be all that 
is in the group—for instance, between Routers A and D and between Routers A and E. 
Multipoint subinterfaces are used when more than two routers are considered to be in the 
same group—for instance, with Routers A, B, and C.
Multipoint subinterfaces logically terminate more than one VC. In fact, the name 
“multipoint” implies the function, because more than one remote site can be reached via a 
VC associated with a multipoint subinterface.
Table 13-8 summarizes the addresses and subinterfaces that are used in Figure 13-13.

What will you see in a real network? Most of the time, point-to-point subinterfaces are used, 
with a single subnet per PVC. However, you should understand all options for the CCNA 
exams. 
Layer 3 Broadcast Handling
After contending with Layer 3 addressing over Frame Relay, the next consideration is how 
to deal with Layer 3 broadcasts. Frame Relay can send copies of a broadcast over all VCs, 
but there is no equivalent to LAN broadcasts. In other words, no capability exists for a 
Frame Relay DTE to send a single frame into the Frame Relay network and have that frame 
replicated and delivered across multiple VCs to multiple destinations. However, routers 
need to send broadcasts for several features to work. In particular, routing protocol updates 
are either broadcasts or multicasts.
The solution to the Frame Relay broadcast dilemma has two parts. First, Cisco IOS 
software sends copies of the broadcasts across each VC, assuming that you have conﬁgured 
the router to forward these necessary broadcasts. If there are only a few VCs, this is not a 
big problem. However, if hundreds of VCs terminate in one router, for each broadcast, 
hundreds of copies could be sent.
As the second part of the solution, the router tries to minimize the impact of the ﬁrst part of 
the solution. The router places the copies of the broadcasts in a different output queue than 
the one for user trafﬁc so that the user does not experience a large spike in delay each time 
a broadcast is replicated and sent over every VC. Cisco IOS software can also be conﬁgured 
to limit the amount of bandwidth that is used for these replicated broadcasts.
Although such scalability issues are more likely to appear on the CCNP Routing exam, a 
short example shows the signiﬁcance of broadcast overhead. If a router knows 1000 routes, 
uses RIP, and has 50 VCs, 1.072 MB of RIP updates is sent every 30 seconds. That averages 
out to 285 kbps. (The math is as follows: 536-byte RIP packets, with 25 routes in each 
packet, for 40 packets per update, with copies sent over 50 VCs. 536 * 40 * 50 = 1.072 MB 
per update interval. 1.072 * 8 / 30 seconds = 285 kbps.) That’s a lot of overhead!
Knowing how to tell the router to forward these broadcasts to each VC is covered in the 
section “Frame Relay Conﬁguration and Veriﬁcation” in Chapter 14. The issues that relate 
to dealing with the volume of these updates are more likely a topic for the CCNP and CCIE 
exams.

13-11, 13-12, and 13-13.

Controlling Speed and Discards in the Frame Relay Cloud     479
Controlling Speed and Discards in the Frame Relay 
Cloud
This chapter has already examined the most important topics in Frame Relay relative to 
how Frame Relay delivers frames over the network. This ﬁnal short section examines a few 
strategies you can use to ﬁne-tune the operation of a Frame Relay network.
The Frame Relay header includes three single-bit ﬂags that Frame Relay can use to help 
control what occurs inside the Frame Relay cloud. These bits can be particularly useful 
when one or more sites use an access rate—the clock rate of the access link—that far 
exceeds the CIR of a VC. For example, if a router has a T1 Frame Relay access link, but 
only a 128-kbps committed information rate (CIR) on a VC that goes over that link, the 
router can send a lot more data into the Frame Relay network than the business contract 
with the Frame Relay provider allows. This section examines 3 bits that impact how the 
switches might help control the network when the network gets congested because of these 
speed mismatches—namely, the Forward Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (FECN), 
Backward Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (BECN), and Discard Eligibility (DE) bits.
FECN and BECN
To deal with instances in which a router can send more data than the VC allows, IOS 
includes a feature called Trafﬁc Shaping, which enables a router to send some packets, wait, 
send more, wait again, and so on. Trafﬁc Shaping allows the router to decrease the overall 
rate of sending bits to a speed slower than the access rate, and maybe even as low as the 
CIR of a VC. For instance, with a T1 access link and a 128-kbps CIR, Trafﬁc Shaping could 
be deﬁned to send an average of only 256 kbps over that VC. The idea is that the Frame 
Relay provider will probably discard a lot of trafﬁc if the router averages sending data over 
that VC at close to T1 speed, which is 12 times the CIR in this case. However, the Frame 
Relay provider may not discard trafﬁc if the average rate is only 256 kbps—twice the CIR 
in this case.
You can set Trafﬁc Shaping to use a single speed, or to adapt to range between two speed 
settings. When it’s conﬁgured to adapt between two speeds, if the network is not congested, 
the higher speed is used; when the network is congested, the router adapts so that it shapes 
using the lower rate.
To adapt the shaping rates, the routers need a way to know whether congestion is 
occurring—and that’s where FECN and BECN are used. Figure 13-14 shows the basic use 
of the FECN and BECN bits.

480     Chapter 13: Frame Relay Concepts
Figure 13-14
Basic Operation of FECN and BECN
FECN and BECN are bits in the Frame Relay header. At any point—either in a router or 
inside the Frame Relay cloud—a device can set the FECN bit, meaning that this frame itself 
has experienced congestion. In other words, congestion exists in the forward direction of 
that frame. In Figure 13-14, in Step 1, the router sends a frame, with FECN=0. The Frame 
Relay switch notices congestion and sets FECN=1 in Step 2.
The goal of the whole process, however, is to get the sending router—R1 in this ﬁgure—to 
slow down. So, knowing that it set FECN in a frame in Step 2 in the ﬁgure, the Frame Relay 
switch can set the BECN bit in the next frame going back to R1 on that VC, shown as Step 
3 in the ﬁgure. The BECN tells R1 that congestion occurred in the direction opposite, or 
backward, of the direction of the frame. In other words, it says that congestion occurred for 
the frame sent by R1 to R2. R1 can then choose to slow down (or not), depending on how 
Trafﬁc Shaping is conﬁgured.
The Discard Eligibility (DE) Bit
When the provider’s network becomes congested, it seems reasonable for the provider to 
try to discard the frames sent by customers that are causing the congestion. The providers 
typically build their networks to handle trafﬁc loads far in excess of the collective CIRs for 
all VCs. However, if one or more customers abuse the right to send data at speeds far in 
advance of their contracted CIR speeds, the provider rightfully could discard only trafﬁc 
sent by those customers.
Frame Relay protocols deﬁne a means to lessen the blow when the customer sends more 
than CIR bits per second over a VC, causing the provider to discard some frames. The 
customer can set the DE bit in some frames. If the provider’s switches need to discard 
frames because of congestion, the switches can discard the frames with the DE bit set. If 
the customer sets the DE bit in the right frames, such as for less important trafﬁc, the 
customer can ensure that the important trafﬁc gets through the Frame Relay network, even 
when the provider has to discard trafﬁc. When the provider’s network is not so congested, 
the customer can send lots of extra data through the Frame Relay network without its being 
discarded.

Frame Relay Configuration and Verification     487
Foundation Topics
This chapter has two main sections. The ﬁrst section examines Frame Relay conﬁguration, 
along with explanations of several show commands. The second section discusses how to 
approach and troubleshoot Frame Relay problems.
Frame Relay Configuration and Verification
Frame Relay conﬁguration can be very basic or somewhat detailed, depending on how 
many default settings can be used. By default, Cisco IOS automatically senses the LMI type 
and automatically discovers the mapping between DLCI and next-hop IP addresses (using 
Inverse ARP). If you use all Cisco routers, the default to use Cisco encapsulation works 
without any additional conﬁguration. If you also design the Frame Relay network to use a 
single subnet, you can conﬁgure the routers to use their physical interfaces without any 
subinterfaces—making the conﬁguration shorter still. In fact, using as many default 
settings as possible, the only new conﬁguration command for Frame Relay, as compared to 
point-to-point WANs, is the encapsulation frame-relay command.
The CCNA exams’ Frame Relay questions can be difﬁcult for a couple of reasons. First, 
Frame Relay includes a variety of optional settings that can be conﬁgured. Second, for 
network engineers who already have some experience with Frame Relay, that experience 
may be with one of the three main options for Frame Relay conﬁguration (physical, 
multipoint, or point-to-point), but the exams cover all options. So, it is important for the 
exams that you take the time to look at samples of all the options, which are covered here.
Planning a Frame Relay Configuration
Engineers must do a fair amount of planning before knowing where to start with the 
conﬁguration. Although most modern Enterprises already have some Frame Relay 
connections, when planning for new sites, you must consider the following items and 
communicate them to the Frame Relay provider, which in turn has some impact on the 
routers’ Frame Relay conﬁgurations:
■
Deﬁne which physical sites need a Frame Relay access link installed, and deﬁne the 
clock rate (access rate) used on each link
■
Deﬁne each VC by identifying the endpoints and setting the CIR
■
Agree to an LMI type (usually dictated by the provider)

488     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
Additionally, the engineer must choose the particular style of conﬁguration based on the 
following. For these items, the enterprise engineer does not need to consult the Frame Relay 
provider:
■
Choose the IP subnetting scheme: one subnet for all VCs, one subnet for each VC, or 
a subnet for each fully meshed subset.
■
Pick whether to assign the IP addresses to physical, multipoint, or point-to-point 
subinterfaces.
■
Choose which VCs need to use IETF encapsulation instead of the default value of 
“cisco.” IETF encapsulation is typically used when one router is not a Cisco router.
After the planning has been completed, the conﬁguration steps ﬂow directly from the 
choices made when planning the network. The following list summarizes the conﬁguration 
steps, mainly as a tool to help remind you of all the steps when you’re doing your ﬁnal exam 
preparation. Feel free to refer to this list as the upcoming examples show you how to 
conﬁgure the various options. (There is no need to memorize the steps; the list is just a tool 
to help organize your thinking about the conﬁguration.)
Step 1 Conﬁgure the physical interface to use Frame Relay encapsulation 
(encapsulation frame-relay interface subcommand).
Step 2 Conﬁgure an IP address on the interface or subinterface (ip address 
subcommand).
Step 3 (Optional) Manually set the LMI type on each physical serial interface 
(frame-relay lmi-type interface subcommand).
Step 4 (Optional) Change from the default encapsulation of cisco to ietf by 
doing the following:
a. For all VCs on the interface, add the ietf keyword to the 
encapsulation frame-relay interface subcommand.
b. For a single VC, add the ietf keyword to the frame-relay interface-
dlci interface subcommand (point-to-point subinterfaces only) or to 
the frame-relay map command.
Step 5 (Optional) If you aren’t using the (default) Inverse ARP to map the DLCI 
to the next-hop router’s IP address, deﬁne static mapping using the 
frame-relay map ip dlci ip-address broadcast subinterface 
subcommand.

Frame Relay Configuration and Verification     489
Step 6 On subinterfaces, associate one (point-to-point) or more (multipoint) 
DLCIs with the subinterface in one of two ways:
a. Using the frame-relay interface-dlci dlci subinterface subcommand
b. As a side effect of static mapping using the frame-relay map ip dlci 
ip-address broadcast subinterface subcommand
The rest of this section shows examples of all these conﬁguration steps, along with some 
discussion about how to verify that the Frame Relay network is working correctly.
A Fully Meshed Network with One IP Subnet
The ﬁrst example shows the briefest possible Frame Relay conﬁguration, one that uses just 
the ﬁrst two steps of the conﬁguration checklist in this chapter. The design for the ﬁrst 
example includes the following choices:
■
Install an access link into three routers.
■
Create a full mesh of PVCs.
■
Use a single subnet (Class C network 199.1.1.0) in the Frame Relay network.
■
Conﬁgure the routers using their physical interfaces.
Take the default settings for LMI, Inverse ARP, and encapsulation. Examples 14-1, 14-2, 
and 14-3 show the conﬁguration for the network shown in Figure 14-1.

The conﬁguration is simple in comparison with the protocol concepts. The encapsulation 
frame-relay command tells the routers to use Frame Relay data-link protocols instead of 
the default, which is HDLC. Note that the IP addresses on the three routers’ serial interfaces 
are all in the same Class C network. Also, this simple conﬁguration takes advantage of the 
following IOS default settings:
■
The LMI type is automatically sensed.
■
The (default) encapsulation is Cisco instead of IETF.

PVC DLCIs are learned via LMI status messages.
■
Inverse ARP is enabled (by default) and is triggered when the status message declaring 
that the VCs are up is received.
Configuring the Encapsulation and LMI
In some cases, the default values are inappropriate. For example, you must use IETF 
encapsulation if one router is not a Cisco router. For the purpose of showing an alternative 
conﬁguration, suppose that the following requirements were added:
■
The Raleigh router requires IETF encapsulation on both VCs.
■
Mayberry’s LMI type should be ANSI, and LMI autosense should not be used.
To change these defaults, the steps outlined as optional conﬁguration Steps 3 and 4 in the 
conﬁguration checklist should be used. Examples 14-4 and 14-5 show the changes that 
would be made to Mayberry and Raleigh.
These conﬁgurations differ from the previous ones (in Examples 14-1 and 14-2) in two 
ways. First, Raleigh changed its encapsulation for both its PVCs with the ietf keyword on 
the encapsulation command. This keyword applies to all VCs on the interface. However, 
Mayberry cannot change its encapsulation in the same way, because only one of the two 
VCs terminating in Mayberry needs to use IETF encapsulation, and the other needs to use 
Cisco encapsulation. So Mayberry is forced to code the frame-relay interface-dlci 
command, referencing the DLCI for the VC to Raleigh, with the ietf keyword. With that 
command, you can change the encapsulation setting per VC, as opposed to the 
conﬁguration on Raleigh, which changes the encapsulation for all VCs.
Example 14-4

 ip address  199.1.1.3  255.255.255.0
! rest of configuration unchanged from Example 14-3.

492     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
The second major change is the LMI conﬁguration. The LMI conﬁguration in Mayberry 
would be ﬁne without any changes, because the default use of LMI autosense would 
recognize ANSI as the LMI type. However, by coding the frame-relay lmi-type ansi 
interface subcommand, Mayberry must use ANSI, because this command not only sets the 
LMI type, it also disables autonegotiation of the LMI type.
Mount Pilot needs to conﬁgure a frame-relay interface-dlci command with the ietf 
keyword for its VC to Raleigh, just like Mayberry. This change is not shown in the 
examples.
Frame Relay Address Mapping
Figure 14-1 does not even bother listing the DLCIs used for the VCs. The conﬁgurations 
work as stated, and frankly, if you never knew the DLCIs, this network would work! 
However, for the exams, and for real networking jobs, you need to understand an important 
concept related to Frame Relay—Frame Relay address mapping. Figure 14-2 shows the 
same network, this time with global DLCI values shown.
Figure 14-2
Full Mesh with Global DLCIs Shown
Frame Relay “mapping” creates a correlation between a Layer 3 address and its 
corresponding Layer 2 address. The concept is similar to the ARP cache for LAN 
interfaces. For example, the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache used on LANs is 
an example of Layer 3-to-Layer 2 address mapping. With IP ARP, you know the IP address 
NOTE
The LMI setting is a per-physical-interface setting, even if subinterfaces are 
used, so the frame-relay lmi-type command is always a subcommand under the physical 
interface.

of another device on the same LAN, but not the MAC address; when the ARP completes, 
you know another device’s LAN (Layer 2) address. Similarly, routers that use Frame Relay 
need a mapping between a router’s Layer 3 address and the DLCI used to reach that other 
router.
This section discusses the basics of why mapping is needed for LAN connections and 
Frame Relay, with a focus on Frame Relay. Here’s a more general deﬁnition of mapping:
The information that correlates to the next-hop router’s Layer 3 address, and 
the Layer 2 address used to reach it, is called mapping. Mapping is needed on 
multiaccess networks.
Thinking about routing helps make the need for mapping more apparent. Imagine that a 
host on the Mayberry Ethernet sends an IP packet to a host on the Mount Pilot Ethernet. 
The packet arrives at the Mayberry router over the LAN, and Mayberry discards the 
Ethernet header and trailer. Mayberry looks at the routing table, which lists a route to 
199.1.11.0, outgoing interface Serial 0/0/0, and next-hop router 199.1.1.2, which is Mount 
Pilot’s Frame Relay IP address.
The next decision that the router must make to complete the process points out the need for 
mapping: What DLCI should Mayberry put in the Frame Relay header? We conﬁgured no 
DLCIs. However, it would work as conﬁgured! To see the answer, consider Example 14-6, 
which shows some important commands that can be used to see how Mayberry makes the 
right choice for the DLCI.

The example highlights all the related information on Mayberry for sending packets to 
network 199.1.11.0/24 off Mount Pilot. Mayberry’s route to 199.1.11.0 refers to outgoing 
interface Serial 0/0/0 and to 199.1.1.2 as the next-hop address. The show frame-relay pvc 
command lists two DLCIs, 52 and 53, and both are active. How does Mayberry know the 
DLCIs? Well, the LMI status messages tell Mayberry about the VCs, the associated DLCIs, 
and the status (active).
Which DLCI should Mayberry use to forward the packet? The show frame-relay map 
command output holds the answer. Notice the highlighted phrase “ip 199.1.1.2 dlci 52” in 
the output. Somehow, Mayberry has mapped 199.1.1.2, which is the next-hop address in 
the route, to the correct DLCI, which is 52. So, Mayberry knows to use DLCI 52 to reach 
next-hop IP address 199.1.1.2.

Frame Relay Configuration and Verification     495
Mayberry can use two methods to build the mapping shown in Example 14-6. One uses a 
statically conﬁgured mapping, and the other uses a dynamic process called Inverse ARP. 
The next two small sections explain the details of each of these options.
Inverse ARP
Inverse ARP dynamically creates a mapping between the Layer 3 address (for example, the 
IP address) and the Layer 2 address (the DLCI). The end result of Inverse ARP is the same 
as IP ARP on a LAN: The router builds a mapping between a neighboring Layer 3 address 
and the corresponding Layer 2 address. However, the process used by Inverse ARP differs 
for ARP on a LAN. After the VC is up, each router announces its network layer address by 
sending an Inverse ARP message over that VC. This works as shown in Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3
Inverse ARP Process
As shown in Figure 14-3, Inverse ARP announces its Layer 3 addresses as soon as the LMI 
signals that the PVCs are up. Inverse ARP starts by learning the DLCI data link layer 
address (via LMI messages), and then it announces its own Layer 3 addresses that use that 
VC. Inverse ARP is enabled by default.
In Example 14-6, Mayberry shows two different entries in the show frame-relay map 
command output. Mayberry uses Inverse ARP to learn that DLCI 52 is mapped to next-hop 
IP address 199.1.1.2 and that DLCI 53 is mapped to next-hop IP address 199.1.1.3. 
Interestingly, Mayberry learns this information by receiving an Inverse ARP from Mount 
Pilot and Raleigh, respectively.

496     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
Table 14-2 summarizes what occurs with Inverse ARP in the network shown in Figure 14-2.
To understand Inverse ARP, focus on the last two columns of Table 14-2. Each router 
receives some Inverse ARP “announcements.” The Inverse ARP message contains the 
sender’s Layer 3 address, and the Frame Relay header, of course, has a DLCI in it. These 
two values are placed in the Inverse ARP cache on the receiving router. For example, in the 
third row, Mayberry receives an Inverse ARP. The DLCI is 52 when the frame arrives at 
Mayberry, and the IP address is 199.1.1.2. This is added to the Frame Relay map table in 
Mayberry, which is shown in the highlighted part of the show frame-relay map command 
in Example 14-6.
Static Frame Relay Mapping
You can statically conﬁgure the same mapping information instead of using Inverse ARP. 
In a production network, you probably would just go ahead and use Inverse ARP. For the 
exams, you need to know how to conﬁgure the static map command statements. Example 
14-7 lists the static Frame Relay map for the three routers shown in Figure 14-2, along with 
the conﬁguration used to disable Inverse ARP.

Frame Relay Configuration and Verification     497
The frame-relay map command entry for Mayberry, referencing 199.1.1.2, is used for 
packets in Mayberry going to Mount Pilot. When Mayberry creates a Frame Relay header, 
expecting it to be delivered to Mount Pilot, Mayberry must use DLCI 52. Mayberry’s 
frame-relay map statement correlates Mount Pilot’s IP address, 199.1.1.2, to the DLCI 
used to reach Mount Pilot—namely, DLCI 52. Likewise, a packet sent back from Mount 
Pilot to Mayberry causes Mount Pilot to use its map statement to refer to Mayberry’s IP 
address of 199.1.1.1. Mapping is needed for each next-hop Layer 3 address for each Layer 
3 protocol being routed. Even with a network this small, the conﬁguration process can be 
laborious.
A Partially Meshed Network with One IP Subnet Per VC
The second sample network, based on the environment shown in Figure 14-4, uses point-
to-point subinterfaces. Examples 14-8 through 14-11 show the conﬁguration for this 
network. The command prompts are included in the ﬁrst example because they change 
when you conﬁgure subinterfaces.

messages such as Hellos.

Frame Relay Configuration and Verification     499
Again, defaults abound in this conﬁguration, but some defaults are different than when 
you’re conﬁguring on the physical interface. The LMI type is autosensed, and Cisco 
encapsulation is used, which is just like the fully meshed examples. Inverse ARP is not 
really needed on point-to-point subinterfaces, but it is enabled by default in case the router 
on the other end of the VC needs to use Inverse ARP, as explained later in this section.
Two new commands create the conﬁguration required with point-to-point subinterfaces. 
First, the interface serial 0/0/0.1 point-to-point command creates logical subinterface 
number 1 under physical interface Serial 0/0/0. The frame-relay interface-dlci 
subinterface subcommand then tells the router which single DLCI is associated with that 
subinterface.
An example of how the frame-relay interface-dlci command works can help. Consider 
router Atlanta in Figure 14-4. Atlanta receives LMI messages on Serial0/0/0 stating that 
three PVCs, with DLCIs 52, 53, and 54, are up. Which PVC goes with which subinterface? 
Cisco IOS software needs to associate the correct PVC with the correct subinterface. This 
is accomplished with the frame-relay interface-dlci command.
The subinterface numbers do not have to match on the router on the other end of the PVC, 
nor does the DLCI number. In this example, I just numbered the subinterfaces to be easier 
to remember. In real life, it is useful to encode some information about your network 
numbering scheme into the subinterface number. For example, a company might encode 
part of the carrier’s circuit ID in the subinterface number so that the operations staff could 
ﬁnd the correct information to tell the telco when troubleshooting the link. Many sites use 
the DLCI as the subinterface number. Of course, useful troubleshooting information, such 
as the DLCI, the name of the router on the other end of the VC, and so on, could be 
conﬁgured as text with the description command as well. In any case, there are no 
requirements for matching subinterface numbers. This example just matches the 
subinterface number to the third octet of the IP address.
Example 14-11

ip address 140.1.14.4  255.255.255.0

500     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
Assigning a DLCI to a Particular Subinterface
As mentioned in the conﬁguration checklist at the beginning of the “Frame Relay 
Conﬁguration and Veriﬁcation” section, when conﬁguring subinterfaces, the DLCIs must 
be associated with each subinterface in one of two ways. Examples 14-8 through 14-11 
showed how to associate the DLCIs using the frame-relay interface-dlci subinterface 
subcommand. The alternative conﬁguration would be to use the frame-relay map 
command as a subinterface subcommand. This command would both associate a DLCI 
with the subinterface and statically conﬁgure a mapping of Layer 3 next-hop IP address to 
that DLCI. For example, on Atlanta, the frame-relay map ip 140.1.1.2 52 broadcast 
command under interface S0/0/0.1 could be used, replacing the frame-relay interface-dlci 
52 command in Example 14-8.
The router disables Inverse ARP on a subinterface when the frame-relay map command is 
conﬁgured. So, when using static maps on the router on one end of the VC, keep in mind 
that the router on the other end of the VC will not receive any Inverse ARP messages and 
may also then need to be conﬁgured with the frame-relay map command.
Comments About Global and Local Addressing
When you take the Cisco CCNA exams, if a ﬁgure for a question shows three or more 
routers, you should be able to easily decide whether the ﬁgure implies local or global DLCI 
values. For instance, Figure 14-4 shows a main site with three PVCs, one to each remote 
site. However, only one DLCI is shown beside the main site router, implying the use of 
global addressing. If local DLCIs were used, the ﬁgure would need to show a DLCI for each 
PVC beside the main site router.
In cases where a ﬁgure for a question shows only two routers, the ﬁgure might not imply 
whether local or global DLCI addressing is used. In those cases, look for clues in the 
question, answers, and any conﬁguration. The best clues relate to the following fact:
On any given router, only local DLCI values are in the conﬁguration or show 
commands.
Again, consider Figure 14-4 along with Examples 14-8 through 14-11. The ﬁgure shows 
global DLCIs, with DLCI 51 beside the Atlanta router. However, the frame-relay 
interface-dlci commands on the Atlanta router (Example 14-8) and the Atlanta show 
commands in upcoming Example 14-12 list DLCIs 52, 53, and 54. Although Figure 14-4 
makes it obvious that global addressing is used, even if only two routers had been shown, 
the show commands and conﬁguration commands could have helped identify the correct 
DLCIs to use.

502     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
The show frame-relay pvc command lists useful management information. For instance, 
the packet counters for each VC, plus the counters for FECN and BECN, can be particularly 
useful. Likewise, comparing the packets/bytes sent on one router versus the counters of 
what is received on the router on the other end of the VC is also quite useful. This reﬂects 
the number of packets/bytes lost inside the Frame Relay cloud. Also, the PVC status is a 
great place to start when troubleshooting.
The show frame-relay map command lists mapping information. With the earlier example 
of a fully meshed network, in which the conﬁguration did not use any subinterfaces, a Layer 
3 address was listed with each DLCI. In this example, a DLCI is listed in each entry, but no 
mention of corresponding Layer 3 addresses is made. The whole point of mapping is to 
correlate a Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address, but there is no Layer 3 address in the show 
frame-relay map command output! The reason is that the information is stored somewhere 
else. Subinterfaces require the use of the frame-relay interface-dlci conﬁguration 
command. Because these subinterfaces are point-to-point, when a route points out a single 
subinterface, the DLCI to use to send frames is implied by the conﬁguration. Mapping via 
Inverse ARP or static frame-relay map statements is needed only when more than two VCs 
terminate on the interface or subinterface, because those are the only instances in which 
confusion about which DLCI to use might occur.
The debug frame-relay lmi output lists information for the sending and receiving LMI 
inquiries. The switch sends the status message, and the DTE (router) sends the status 
inquiry. The default setting with Cisco IOS software is to send, and to expect to receive, 
these status messages. The Cisco IOS software no keepalive command is used to disable 
the use of LMI status messages. Unlike other interfaces, Cisco keepalive messages do not 
ﬂow from router to router over Frame Relay. Instead, they are simply used to detect whether 
the router has connectivity to its local Frame Relay switch.

A Partially Meshed Network with Some Fully Meshed Parts
You can also choose to use multipoint subinterfaces for a Frame Relay conﬁguration. This 
last sample network, based on the network shown in Figure 14-5, uses both multipoint and 
point-to-point subinterfaces. Examples 14-13 through 14-17 show the conﬁguration for this 
network. Table 14-3 summarizes the addresses and subinterfaces used.

Multipoint subinterfaces work best when you have a full mesh between a set of routers. On 
Routers A, B, and C, a multipoint subinterface is used for the conﬁguration referencing the 
other two routers, because you can think of these three routers as forming a fully meshed 
subset of the network.
The term multipoint simply means that there is more than one VC, so you can send and 
receive to and from more than one VC on the subinterface. Like point-to-point 
subinterfaces, multipoint subinterfaces use the frame-relay interface-dlci command. 
Notice that there are two commands for each multipoint subinterface in this case, because 
each of the two PVCs associated with this subinterface must be identiﬁed as being used 
with that subinterface.
Router A is the only router using both multipoint and point-to-point subinterfaces. On 
Router A’s multipoint Serial0/0/0.1 interface, DLCIs for Router B and Router C are listed. 
On Router A’s other two subinterfaces, which are point-to-point, only a single DLCI needs 
to be listed. In fact, only one frame-relay interface-dlci command is allowed on a point-
to-point subinterface, because only one VC is allowed. Otherwise, the conﬁgurations 
between the two types are similar.
No mapping statements are required for the conﬁgurations shown in Examples 14-13 
through 14-17, because Inverse ARP is enabled on the multipoint subinterfaces by default. 
No mapping is ever needed for the point-to-point subinterface, because the only DLCI 
associated with the interface is statically conﬁgured with the frame-relay interface-dlci 
command.
Example 14-18 lists another show frame-relay map command, showing the mapping 
information learned by Inverse ARP for the multipoint subinterface. Notice that the output 
now includes the Layer 3 addresses, whereas the same command when using point-to-point 
subinterfaces (in Example 14-12) did not. The reason is that the routes might refer to a next-
hop IP address reachable out a multipoint interface, but because more than one DLCI is

associated with the interface, the router needs mapping information to match the next-hop 
IP address to the correct DLCI.
The messages about Inverse ARP in the debug frame-relay events output are not so 
obvious. One easy exercise is to search for the hex version of the IP addresses in the output. 
These addresses are highlighted in Example 14-18. For example, the ﬁrst 4 bytes of 
140.1.1.1 are 8C 01 01 01in hexadecimal. This ﬁeld starts on the left side of the output, so 
it is easy to recognize.

Frame Relay Troubleshooting     507
Frame Relay Troubleshooting
Frame Relay has many features and options that can be conﬁgured. For both real life and 
the exams, troubleshooting Frame Relay problems often means that you need to look at all 
the routers’ conﬁgurations and make sure that the conﬁgurations meet the requirements. 
The LMI types must match or be autosensed, the Layer 3 mapping information has been 
learned or statically mapped, the right DLCI values have been associated with each 
subinterface, and so on. So, to be well prepared for the CCNA exams, you should review 
and memorize the many Frame Relay conﬁguration options and what each option means.
However, the exams may have Frame Relay questions that require you to determine a 
problem without looking at the conﬁguration. This second major section of this chapter 
examines Frame Relay troubleshooting, with emphasis on how to use show commands, 
along with the symptoms of a problem, to isolate the root cause of the problem.
A Suggested Frame Relay Troubleshooting Process
To isolate a Frame Relay problem, the process should start with some pings. Optimally, 
pings from an end-user host on a LAN, to another host on a remote LAN, can quickly 
determine if the network currently can meet the true end goal of delivering packets between 
computers. If that ping fails, a ping from one router to the other router’s Frame Relay IP 
address is the next step. If that ping works, but the end user’s ping failed, the problem 
probably has something to do with Layer 3 issues, and troubleshooting those issues was 
well covered in Chapters 7 and 11. However, if a ping from one router to another router’s 
Frame Relay IP address fails, the problem is most likely related to the Frame Relay 
network.
This section focuses on troubleshooting problems when a Frame Relay router cannot ping 
another router’s Frame Relay IP address. At that point, the engineer should ping the Frame 
Relay IP addresses of all the other routers on the other end of each VC to determine the 
following:
Do the pings fail for all remote routers’ Frame Relay IP addresses, or do some 
pings fail and some pings work?
For example, Figure 14-6 shows a sample Frame Relay network that will be used with the 
remaining examples in this chapter. If R1 tried to ping R2’s Frame Relay IP address 
(10.1.2.2 in this case) and failed, the next question is whether R1’s pings to R3 (10.1.34.3) 
and R4 (10.1.34.4) work.

508     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
Figure 14-6
Sample Frame Relay Network for the Troubleshooting Examples
This chapter organizes its explanations of how to troubleshoot Frame Relay based on this 
ﬁrst problem isolation step. The following list summarizes the major actions, with each step 
in the following list being examined in order following the list.
If a Frame Relay router’s pings fail for all remote routers whose VCs share a single access 
link, do the following:
Step 1 Check for Layer 1 problems on the access link between the router and the local 
Frame Relay switch (all routers).
Step 2 Check for Layer 2 problems on the access link, particularly 
encapsulation and LMI.
After resolving any problems in the ﬁrst two steps, or if the original ping tests showed that 
the Frame Relay router can ping some, but not all, of the other Frame Relay routers whose 
VCs share a single access link, follow these steps:
Step 3 Check for PVC problems based on the PVC status and subinterface 
status.
Step 4 Check for Layer 2/3 problems with both static and dynamic (Inverse 
ARP) mapping.
Step 5 Check for Layer 2/3 problems related to a mismatch of end-to-end 
encapsulation (cisco or ietf).
Step 6 Check for other Layer 3 issues, including mismatched subnets.

Frame Relay Troubleshooting     509
The rest of this chapter explains some of the details of each step of this suggested 
troubleshooting process.
Layer 1 Issues on the Access Link (Step 1)
If a router’s physical interface used for the Frame Relay access link is not in an “up and up” 
state, the router cannot send any frames over the link. If the interface has a line status (the 
ﬁrst interface status code) of down, the interface most likely has a Layer 1 issue.
From a Layer 1 perspective, a Frame Relay access link is merely a leased line between a 
router and a Frame Relay switch. As such, the exact same Layer 1 issues exist for this link 
as for a point-to-point leased line. Because the possible root causes and suggested 
troubleshooting steps mirror what should be done on a leased line, refer to the section 
“Troubleshooting Layer 1 Problems” in Chapter 12, “Point-to-Point WANs,” for more 
information about this step.
Layer 2 Issues on the Access Link (Step 2)
If a router’s physical interface line status is up, but the line protocol status (second status 
code) is down, the link typically has a Layer 2 problem between the router and the local 
Frame Relay switch. With Frame Relay interfaces, the problem is typically related to either 
the encapsulation command or the Frame Relay LMI.
The potential problem related to the encapsulation command is very simple to check. If a 
router’s serial interface conﬁguration omits the encapsulation frame-relay interface 
subcommand, but the physical access link is working, the physical interface settles into an 
up/down state. If the conﬁguration is unavailable, the show interfaces command can be 
used to see the conﬁgured encapsulation type, which is listed in the ﬁrst few lines of 
command output.
The other potential problem relates to the LMI. LMI status messages ﬂow in both directions 
between a router (DTE) and Frame Relay switch (DCE) for two main purposes:
■
For the DCE to inform the DTE about each VC’s DLCI and its status
■
To provide a keepalive function so that the DTE and DCE can easily tell when the 
access link can no longer pass trafﬁc
A router places the physical link in an up/down state when the link physically works but the 
router ceases to hear LMI messages from the switch. With the interface not in an up/up 
state, the router does not attempt to send any IP packets out the interface, so all pings should 
fail at this point.

510     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
A router might cease to receive LMI messages from the switch because of both legitimate 
reasons and mistakes. The normal legitimate purpose for the LMI keepalive function is that 
if the link really is having problems, and cannot pass any data, the router can notice the loss 
of keepalive messages and bring the link down. This allows the router to use an alternative 
route, assuming that an alternative route exists. However, a router might cease to receive 
LMI messages and bring down the interface because of the following mistakes:
■
Disabling LMI on the router (with the no keepalive physical interface subcommand), 
but leaving it enabled on the switch—or vice versa
■
Conﬁguring different LMI types on the router (with the frame-relay lmi-type type 
physical interface subcommand) and the switch
You can easily check for both encapsulation and LMI using the show frame-relay lmi 
command. This command lists only output for interfaces that have the encapsulation 
frame-relay command conﬁgured, so you can quickly conﬁrm whether the encapsulation 
frame-relay command is conﬁgured on the correct serial interfaces. This command also 
lists the LMI type used by the router, and it shows counters for the number of LMI messages 
sent and received. Example 14-19 shows an example from router R1 in Figure 14-6.
For this example, router R1 was statically conﬁgured with the frame-relay lmi-type ansi 
interface subcommand, with switch S1 still using LMI type cisco. When the LMI 
conﬁguration was changed, the router and switch had exchanged 34 LMI messages (of type 
cisco). After that change, R1’s counter of the number of status enquiry messages sent kept 
rising (122 when the show frame-relay lmi command output was captured), but the 
counter of the number of LMI status messages received from the switch remained at 34. 
Just below that counter is the number of timeouts, which counts the number of times the 
router expected to receive a periodic LMI message from the switch but did not. In this case, 
the router was actually still receiving LMI messages, but they were not ANSI LMI 
messages so the router did not understand or recognize them.

Frame Relay Troubleshooting     511
If repeated use of the show frame-relay lmi command shows that the number of status 
messages received remains the same, the likely cause, other than a truly nonworking link, 
is that the LMI types do not match. The best solution is to allow for LMI autosense by 
conﬁguring the no frame-relay lmi-type type physical interface subcommand, or 
alternatively, conﬁguring the same LMI type that is used by the switch.
If you troubleshoot and ﬁx any problems found in Steps 1 and 2, on all Frame Relay 
connected routers, all the routers’ access link physical interfaces should be in an up/up 
state. The last four steps examine issues that apply to individual PVCs and neighbors.
PVC Problems and Status (Step 3)
The goal at this step in the troubleshooting process is to discover the DLCI of the PVC used 
to reach a particular neighbor and then ﬁnd out if the PVC is working. To determine the 
correct PVC, particularly if little or no conﬁguration or documentation is available, you 
have to start with the failed ping command. The ping command identiﬁes the IP address of 
the neighboring router. Based on the neighbor’s IP address, a few show commands can link 
the neighbor’s IP address with the associated connected subnet, the connected subnet with 
the local router’s interface, and the local router’s interface with the possible DLCIs. Also, 
the Frame Relay mapping information can identify the speciﬁc PVC. Although this book 
has covered all the commands used to ﬁnd these pieces of information, the following list 
summarizes the steps that take you from the neighbor’s IP address to the correct local DLCI 
used to send frames to that neighbor:
Step 3a
Discover the IP address and mask of each Frame Relay interface/
subinterface (show interfaces, show ip interface brief), and calculate 
the connected subnets.
Step 3b
Compare the IP address in the failed ping command, and pick the 
interface/subinterface whose connected subnet is the same subnet.
Step 3c
Discover the PVC(s) assigned to that interface or subinterface (show 
frame-relay pvc).
Step 3d
If more than one PVC is assigned to the interface or subinterface, 
determine which PVC is used to reach a particular neighbor (show 
frame-relay map).
NOTE
As a reminder, lists like this one are meant for convenient reference when you 
read the chapter. It’s easy to ﬁnd the list when you study and want to remember a 
particular part of how to attack a given problem. You do not need to memorize the list, or 
practice it until you internalize the information.

512     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
Steps 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d discover the correct PVC to examine. After it is discovered, Step 3 
in the suggested troubleshooting process interprets the status of that PVC, and the 
associated interface or subinterface, to determine the cause of any problems.
This section takes a closer look at an example in which R1 cannot ping R2’s 10.1.2.2 Frame 
Relay IP address. Before focusing on the process to determine which VC is used, it is 
helpful to see the ﬁnal answer, so Figure 14-7 lists some of the details. For this example, 
R1’s ping 10.1.2.2 command fails in this case.
Figure 14-7
Conﬁguration Facts Related to R1’s Failed ping 10.1.2.2 Command
Find the Connected Subnet and Outgoing Interface (Steps 3a and 3b)
The ﬁrst two substeps to ﬁnd R1’s PVC (DLCI) connecting to R2 (Substeps 3a and 3b) 
should be relatively easy assuming that you have already ﬁnished Parts II and III of this 
book. Any time you ping the Frame Relay IP address of a neighboring router, that IP 
address should be in one of the subnets also connected to the local router. To ﬁnd the 
interface used on a local router when forwarding packets to the remote router, you just have 
to ﬁnd that common connected subnet.
In this example, with R1 pinging 10.1.2.2, Example 14-20 shows a few commands that 
conﬁrm that R1’s S0/0/0.2 subinterface is connected to subnet 10.1.2.0/24, which includes 
R2’s 10.1.2.2 IP address.

Find the PVCs Assigned to That Interface (Step 3c)
The show frame-relay pvc command directly answers the question of which PVCs have 
been assigned to which interfaces and subinterfaces. If the command is issued with no 
parameters, the command lists about ten lines of output for each VC, with the end of the 
ﬁrst line listing the associated interface or subinterface. Example 14-21 lists the beginning

To ﬁnd all the PVCs associated with an interface or subinterface, just scan the highlighted 
parts of the output in Example 14-21. In this case, S0/0/0.2 is listed with only one PVC, the 
one with DLCI 102, so only one PVC is associated with S0/0/0.2 in this case.
Determine Which PVC Is Used to Reach a Particular Neighbor (Step 3d)
If the router’s conﬁguration associates more than one PVC with one interface or 
subinterface, the next step is to ﬁgure out which of the PVCs is used to send trafﬁc to a 
particular neighbor. For instance, Example 14-21 shows R1 uses a multipoint subinterface 
S0/0/0.34 with DLCIs 103 and 104, with DLCI 103 used for the PVC to R3, and DLCI 104 
for the PVC connecting to R4. So, if you were troubleshooting a problem in which the ping 
10.1.34.3 command failed on R1, the next step would be to determine which of the two 
DLCIs (103 or 104) identiﬁes the VC connecting R1 to R3.
Unfortunately, you cannot always ﬁnd the answer without looking at other documentation. 
The only show command that can help is show frame-relay map, which can correlate the 
next-hop IP address and DLCI. Unfortunately, if the local router relies on Inverse ARP, the 
local router cannot learn the mapping information right now either, so the mapping table 
may not have any useful information in it. However, if static mapping is used, the correct 
PVC/DLCI can be identiﬁed.
In the example of R1 failing when pinging 10.1.2.2 (R2), because only one PVC is 
associated with the correct interface (S0/0/0.2), the PVC has already been identiﬁed, so you 
can ignore this step for now.

PVC Status
At this point in major troubleshooting Step 3, the correct outgoing interface/subinterface 
and correct PVC/DLCI have been identiﬁed. Finally, the PVC status can be examined to see 
if it means that the PVC has a problem.
Routers use four different PVC status codes. A router learns about two of the possible status 
values, active and inactive, via LMI messages from the Frame Relay switch. The switch’s 
LMI message lists all DLCIs for all conﬁgured PVCs on the access link, and whether the 
PVC is currently usable (active) or not (inactive).
The ﬁrst of the two PVC states that is not learned using LMI is called the static state. If the 
LMI is disabled, the router does not learn any information from the switch about PVC 
status. So, the router lists all its conﬁgured DLCIs in the static state, meaning statically 
conﬁgured. The router does not know if the PVCs will work, but it can at least send frames 
using those DLCIs and hope that the Frame Relay network can deliver them.
The other PVC state, deleted, is used when LMI is working but the switch’s LMI message 
does not mention anything about a particular DLCI value. If the router has conﬁguration for 
a DLCI (for example, in a frame-relay interface-dlci command), but the switch’s LMI 
message does not list that DLCI, the router lists that DLCI in a deleted state. This state 
means that the router has conﬁgured the DLCI, but the switch has not. In real life, the 
deleted state may mean that the router or switch has been misconﬁgured, or that the Frame 
Relay switch has not yet been conﬁgured with the correct DLCI. Table 14-4 summarizes 
the four Frame Relay PVC status codes.
As noted in the last row of the table, routers only send data over PVCs in an active or static 
state. Also, even if the PVC is in a static state, there is no guarantee that the Frame Relay 
network can actually send frames over that PVC, because the static state implies that LMI 
is turned off, and the router has not learned any status information.

516     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
The next step in the troubleshooting process is to ﬁnd the status of the PVC used to reach 
a particular neighbor. Continuing with the problem of R1 failing when pinging R2 
(10.1.2.2), Example 14-22 shows the status of the PVC with DLCI 102, as identiﬁed earlier.
In this case, R1 cannot ping R2 because the PVC with DLCI 102 is in an inactive state.
To further isolate the problem and ﬁnd the root cause, you need to look deeper into the 
reasons why a PVC can be in an inactive state. First, as always, repeat the same 
troubleshooting steps on the other router—in this case, R2. If no problems are found on R2, 
other than an inactive PVC, the problem may be a genuine problem in the Frame Relay 
provider’s network, so a call to the provider may be the next step. However, you may ﬁnd 
some other problem on the remote router. For example, to create the failure and show 
commands in this section, R2’s access link was shut down, so a quick examination of 
troubleshooting Step 1 on router R2 would have identiﬁed the problem. However, if further 
troubleshooting shows that both routers list their ends of the PVC in an inactive state, the 
root cause lies within the Frame Relay provider's network.
Finding the root cause of a problem related to a PVC in a deleted state is relatively easy. 
The deleted status means that the Frame Relay switch’s conﬁguration and the router’s 
conﬁguration do not match, with the router conﬁguring a DLCI that is not also conﬁgured 
on the switch. Either the provider said it would conﬁgure a PVC with a particular DLCI, 
and did not, or the router engineer conﬁgured the wrong DLCI value.
Subinterface Status
Subinterfaces have a line status and protocol status code, just like physical interfaces. 
However, because subinterfaces are virtual, the status codes and their meanings differ a bit

Frame Relay Troubleshooting     517
from physical interfaces. This section brieﬂy examines how Frame Relay subinterfaces 
work and how IOS decides if a Frame Relay subinterface should be in an up/up state or a 
down/down state.
Frame Relay conﬁguration associates one or more DLCIs with a subinterface using two 
commands: frame-relay interface-dlci and frame-relay map. Of all the DLCIs associated 
with a subinterface, IOS uses the following rules to determine the status of a subinterface:
■
down/down: All the DLCIs associated with the subinterface are inactive or deleted, or 
the underlying physical interface is not in an up/up state.
■
up/up: At least one of the DLCIs associated with the subinterface is active or static.
For example, to cause the problems shown in Example 14-22, R2 and R3 simply shut down 
their Frame Relay access links. Figure 14-8 shows the next LMI status message that switch 
S1 sends to R1.
Figure 14-8
Results of Shutting Down R2 and R3 Access Links
As shown in the ﬁgure, R1 uses a point-to-point subinterface (S0/0/0.2) for the VC 
connecting to R2, and a multipoint subinterface (S0/0/0.34) associated with the VCs to R3 
and R4 (103 and 104, respectively). The beginning of Example 14-20 shows that S0/0/0.2 
is in a down/down state, which is because the only DLCI associated with the subinterface 
(102) is inactive. However, S0/0/0.34 has two DLCIs, one of which is active, so IOS leaves 
S0/0/0.34 in an up/up state.

518     Chapter 14: Frame Relay Configuration and Troubleshooting
It is useful to look at subinterface status when troubleshooting, but keep in mind that just 
because a subinterface is up, if it is a multipoint subinterface, the up/up state does not 
necessarily mean that all DLCIs associated with the subinterface are working.
Frame Relay Mapping Issues (Step 4)
If you follow the ﬁrst three steps of the troubleshooting process suggested in this chapter 
and resolve the problems at each step, at this point each router’s access link interfaces 
should be in an up/up state, and the PVC between the two routers should be in an active (or 
static) state. If the routers still cannot ping each other’s Frame Relay IP addresses, the next 
thing to check is the Frame Relay address mapping information, which maps DLCIs to 
next-hop IP addresses.
This section does not repeat the detailed coverage of address mapping that appears in both 
Chapter 13 and this chapter. However, for perspective, the following list points out some 
tips and hints as reminders when you perform this troubleshooting step:
On point-to-point subinterfaces:
■
These subinterfaces do not need Inverse ARP or static mapping, because IOS simply 
thinks that the subnet deﬁned on the subinterface is reachable via the only DLCI on the 
subinterface.
■
The show frame-relay map command output still lists these subinterfaces, but with 
no next-hop IP address.
On physical interfaces and multipoint subinterfaces:
■
They need to use either Inverse ARP or static mapping.
■
The show frame-relay map command should list the remote router’s Frame Relay IP 
address and the local router’s local DLCI for each PVC associated with the interface 
or subinterface.
■
If you’re using static mapping, the broadcast keyword is needed to support a routing 
protocol.
For completeness, Example 14-23 shows the output of the show frame-relay map 
command on router R1 from Figure 14-6, with no problems with the mapping. (The earlier 
problems that were introduced have been ﬁxed.) In this case, interface S0/0/0.2 is a point-

Frame Relay Troubleshooting     519
to-point subinterface, and S0/0/0.34 is a multipoint, with one Inverse ARP-learned mapping 
and one statically conﬁgured mapping.
End-to-End Encapsulation (Step 5)
The end-to-end encapsulation on a PVC refers to the headers that follow the Frame Relay 
header, with two options: the Cisco-proprietary header and an IETF standard header. The 
conﬁguration details were covered earlier in this chapter, in the section “Conﬁguring the 
Encapsulation and LMI.”
As it turns out, a mismatched encapsulation setting on the routers on opposite ends of the 
link might cause a problem in one particular case. If one router is a Cisco router, using 
Cisco encapsulation, and the other router is a non-Cisco router, using IETF encapsulation, 
pings may fail because of the encapsulation mismatch. However, two Cisco routers can 
understand both types of encapsulation, so it should not be an issue in networks with only 
Cisco routers.
Mismatched Subnet Numbers (Step 6)
At this point, if the problems found in the ﬁrst ﬁve of the six troubleshooting steps have 
been resolved, all the Frame Relay problems should be resolved. However, if the two 
routers on either end of the PVC have mistakenly conﬁgured IP addresses in different 
subnets, the routers will not be able to ping one another, and the routing protocols will not 
become adjacent. So, as a last step, you should conﬁrm the IP addresses on each router, and 
the masks, and ensure that they connect to the same subnet. To do so, just use the show ip 
interface brief and show interfaces commands on the two routers.
Example 14-23
show frame-relay map Command on R1
R1#sssshhhhoooowwww    ffffrrrraaaammmmeeee----rrrreeeellllaaaayyyy    mmmmaaaapppp

Virtual Private Networks
A company with one main site and ten remote sites could buy ten T1 lines, one each from 
the central site to each remote ofﬁce. A more cost-effective solution would be to use Frame 
Relay. However, especially because the remote sites often need access to the Internet, it is 
even more cost effective to simply connect each ofﬁce to the Internet, and send trafﬁc 
between sites over the Internet, using the Internet as a WAN.
Unfortunately, the Internet is not nearly as secure as leased lines and Frame Relay. For 
example, for an attacker to steal a copy of data frames passing over a leased line, the 
attacker would have to physically tap into the cable, oftentimes inside a secure building, 
under the street, or at the telco central ofﬁce (CO); all of these actions can result in a jail 
sentence. With the Internet, an attacker can ﬁnd less intrusive ways to get copies of packets, 
without even having to leave his home computer, and with a much smaller risk of getting 
carted off to jail.
Virtual private networks (VPN) solve the security problems associated with using the 
Internet as a WAN service. This chapter explains the concepts and terminology related to 
VPNs.

528     Chapter 15: Virtual Private Networks
Foundation Topics
This chapter has three main sections. The ﬁrst section introduces the basic concept of a 
VPN. The second (and largest) section examines some of the details of building VPNs using 
the rules deﬁned in the IP Security (IPsec) RFCs. The last section explains the basics of an 
alternative VPN technology called SSL.
VPN Fundamentals
Leased lines have some wonderful security features. The router on one ends knows with 
conﬁdence the identity of the device on the other end of the link. The receiving router also 
has good reason to believe that no attackers saw the data in transit, or even changed the data 
to cause some harm.
Virtual private networks (VPN) try to provide these same secure features as a leased line. 
In particular, they provide the following:
■
Privacy: Preventing anyone in the middle of the Internet (man in the middle) who 
copies the packet in the Internet from being able to read the data
■
Authentication: Verifying that the sender of the VPN packet is a legitimate device and 
not a device used by an attacker
■
Data integrity: Verifying that the packet was not changed as the packet transited the 
Internet
■
Antireplay: Preventing a man in the middle from copying packets sent by a legitimate 
user, and then later resending the packets to appear to be a legitimate user
To accomplish these goals, two devices near the edge of the Internet create a VPN, 
sometimes called a VPN tunnel. These devices add headers to the original packet, with these 
headers including ﬁelds that allow the VPN devices to perform all the functions. The VPN 
devices also encrypt the original IP packet, meaning that the original packet’s contents are 
undecipherable to anyone who happens to see a copy of the packet as it traverses the 
Internet. 
Figure 15-1 shows the general idea of what typically occurs with a VPN tunnel. The ﬁgure 
shows a VPN created between a branch ofﬁce router and a Cisco Adaptive Security 
Appliance (ASA). In this case, the VPN is called a site-to-site VPN, because it connects two 
sites of a company, in particular. This VPN is also called site-to-site intranet VPN, because 
it connects sites that belong inside a single company.

would without a VPN.
2.
The router encrypts the packet, adds some VPN headers, adds another IP header (with 
public IP addresses), and forwards the packet.
3.
A man in the middle copies the packet but cannot change the packet without being 
noticed, and cannot read the contents of the packet.
4.
ASA-1 receives the packet, conﬁrms the authenticity of the sender, conﬁrms that the 
packet has not been changed, and then decrypts the original packet.
5.
Server S1 receives the unencrypted packet.
The beneﬁts of using an Internet-based VPN as shown in Figure 15-1 are many. The cost of 
a high-speed Internet connection is typically much less than that of either a leased line or a 
Frame Relay WAN. The Internet is seemingly everywhere, making this kind of solution 
available worldwide. And by using VPN technology and protocols, the communications are 
secure.
NOTE
The term tunnel generically refers to any protocol’s packet that is sent by 
encapsulating the packet inside another packet. The term VPN tunnel implies that the 
encapsulated packet has been encrypted, whereas the term tunnel does not imply whether 
the packet has been encrypted.

VPNs can be built with a variety of devices and for a variety of purposes. Figure 15-2 shows 
an example of three of the primary reasons for building an Internet VPN today.
Figure 15-2
Intranet, Extranet, and Access VPNs
In the top part of the ﬁgure, the central site and a remote branch ofﬁce of a ﬁctitious 
company (Fredsco) are connected with an intranet VPN. The middle of the ﬁgure shows 
Fredsco connecting to another company that supplies parts to Fredsco, making that VPN an 
extranet VPN. Finally, when Fred brings his laptop home at the end of the day and connects 
to the Internet, the secure VPN connection from the laptop back into the Fredsco network 
is called a remote access VPN, or simply an access VPN. In this case, the laptop itself is the 
end of the VPN tunnel, rather than the Internet access router. Table 15-2 summarizes the 
key points about these three types of VPNs.

IPsec VPNs     531
To build a VPN, one device at each site needs to have hardware and/or software that 
understand a chosen set of VPN security standards and protocols. The devices include the 
following:
■
Routers: In addition to packet forwarding, the router can provide VPN functions as 
well. The router can have specialized add-on cards that help the router perform the 
encryption more quickly.
■
Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA): The Cisco leading security appliance that can 
be conﬁgured for many security functions, including VPNs.
■
PIX ﬁrewalls: The older product line of Cisco ﬁrewall products that can perform VPN 
functions in addition to working as a ﬁrewall. New installations today would instead 
use an ASA.
■
VPN concentrators: An older product line from Cisco, these devices provide a 
hardware platform to speciﬁcally act as the endpoint of a VPN tunnel. New 
installations today would instead use an ASA.
■
VPN client: For access VPNs, the PC might need to do the VPN functions; the laptop 
needs software to do those functions, with that software being called a VPN client.
Next, the text examines the use of a set of protocols called IPsec to create VPNs.
IPsec VPNs
IPsec is an architecture or framework for security services for IP networks. The name itself 
is not an acronym, but rather a shortened version of the title of the RFC that deﬁnes it (RFC 
4301, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol), more generally called IP Security, or 
IPsec.
IPsec deﬁnes a set of functions, for example, authentication and encryption, and some rules 
regarding each of those functions. However, like the TCP/IP protocol architecture deﬁnes 
many protocols, some of which are alternatives to each other, IPsec allows the use of several 
different protocol options for each VPN feature. One of IPsec’s strengths is that its role as 
an architecture allows it to be added to and changed over time as improvements to security 
protocols are made.
The following sections examine the components of IPsec, beginning with encryption, 
followed by key exchange, message integrity, and authentication.

532     Chapter 15: Virtual Private Networks
IPsec Encryption
If you ignore the math—and thankfully, you can—IPsec encryption is not too difﬁcult to 
understand. IPsec encryption uses a pair of encryption algorithms, which are essentially 
math formulas, that meet a couple of requirements. First, the two math formulas are a 
matched set:
■
One to hide (encrypt) the data
■
Another to re-create (decrypt) the original data from the encrypted data
Besides those somewhat obvious functions, the two math formulas were chosen so that if 
you intercept the encrypted text, but do not have the secret password (called an encryption 
key), decrypting that one packet would be difﬁcult. Additionally, the formulas are also 
chosen so that if an attacker did happen to decrypt one packet, that information would not 
give the attacker any advantages in decrypting the other packets.
The process for encrypting data for an IPsec VPN works generally as shown in Figure 15-
3. Note that the encryption key is also known as the session key, shared key, or shared 
session key.
Figure 15-3
Basic IPsec Encryption Process
The four steps highlighted in the ﬁgure are as follows:
1.
The sending VPN device (like the remote ofﬁce router in Figure 15-1) feeds the 
original packet and the session key into the encryption formula, calculating the 
encrypted data.

2.
The sending device encapsulates the encrypted data into a packet, which includes the 
new IP header and VPN header.
3.
The sending device sends this new packet to the destination VPN device (ASA-1 back 
in Figure 15-1).
4.
The receiving VPN device runs the corresponding decryption formula, using the 
encrypted data and session key—the same value as was used on the sending VPN 
device—to decrypt the data.
IPsec supports several variations on the encryption algorithms, some of which are simply 
more recently developed and better, while some have other trade-offs. In particular, the 
length of the keys has some impact on both the difﬁculty for attackers to decrypt the data, 
with longer keys making it more difﬁcult, but with the negative result of generally requiring 
more processing power. Table 15-3 summarizes several of these options and the lengths of 
the keys.
IPsec Key Exchange
The use of a shared common key value (also called symmetric keys) for encryption causes 
a bit of chicken-and-egg problem: If both devices need to know the same key value before 
they can encrypt/decrypt the data, how can the two devices send the key values to each over 
the network without having to send the keys as clear text, open to being stolen by an 
attacker?
The problem related to key distribution has existed since the idea of encryption was ﬁrst 
created. One simple but problematic option is to use Pre-Shared Keys (PSK), a fancy term 
for the idea that you manually conﬁgure the values on both devices. With PSKs, you might 
just exchange keys by calling the engineer at the remote site, or sending a letter, or (don’t 
do this at home) sending an unsecure e-mail with the key value.

534     Chapter 15: Virtual Private Networks
The problem with PSKs is that even if no one steals the shared encryption key, it is only 
human nature that the PSKs will almost never change. It’s like changing your password on 
a website that never requires you to change your password: You might never think about it, 
no one makes you change it, and you do not want to have to remember a new password. 
However, for better security, the keys need to be changed occasionally because even though 
the encryption algorithms make it difﬁcult to decrypt the data, it is technically possible for 
an attacker to break a key, and then be able to decrypt the packet. Dynamic key exchange 
protocols allow frequent changes to encryption keys, signiﬁcantly reducing the amount of 
lost data if an attacker compromises an encryption key.
IPsec, as a security architecture, calls for the use of dynamic key exchange through a process 
deﬁned by RFC 4306 and called Internet Key Exchange (IKE). IKE (RFC 4306) calls for 
the use of a speciﬁc process called Difﬁe-Hellman (DH) key exchange, named after the 
inventors of the process. DH key exchange overcomes the chicken-and-egg problem with 
an algorithm that allows the devices to make up and exchange keys securely, preventing 
anyone who can see the messages from deriving the key value.
The primary conﬁguration option for DH key exchange is the length of the keys used by the 
DH key exchange process to encrypt the key exchange messages. The longer the encryption 
key that needs to be exchanged, the longer the DH key needs to be. Table 15-4 summarizes 
the main three options.
IPsec Authentication and Message Integrity
IPsec has several options for the authentication and message integrity process as well. 
Authentication generally refers to the process by which a receiving VPN device can conﬁrm 
that a received packet was really sent by a trusted VPN peer. Message integrity, sometimes 
referred to as message authentication, allows the receiver to conﬁrm that the message was 
not changed in transit.

IPsec VPNs     535
IPsec authentication and message integrity checks use some of the same general concepts 
as does the encryption and key exchange process, so this text does not go into a lot of detail. 
However, it is useful to understand the basics.
Message integrity checks can be performed by the IPsec Authentication Header (AH) 
protocol using a shared (symmetric) key concept, like the encryption process, but using a 
hash function rather than an encryption function. The hash works similarly to the frame 
check sequence (FCS) concept in the trailer of most data-link protocols, but in a much more 
secure manner. The hash (a type of math function), with the formal name of Hashed-based 
Message Authentication Code (HMAC), results in a small number that can then be stored 
in one of the VPN headers. The sender calculates the hash and sends the results in the VPN 
header. The receiver recomputes the hash, using a shared key (same key value on both 
ends), and compares the computed value with the value listed in the VPN header. If the two 
values match, it means that the data fed into the formula by the sender matches what was 
fed into the formula by the receiver, so the receiver knows that the message did not change 
in transit.
These integrity check functions with HMAC typically use a secret key that needs to be at 
least twice as long as the encryption key that encrypts the message. As a result, several 
HMAC options have been created over the years. For example, the long-supported message 
digest algorithm 5 (MD5) standard uses a 128-bit key, allowing it to support VPNs that use 
the 56-bit DES encryption key length.
The authentication process uses a public/private key concept similar to DH key exchange, 
relying on the idea that a value encrypted with the sender’s private key can be decrypted 
with the sender’s public key. Like the message integrity check, the sender calculates a value 
and puts it in the VPN header, but this time using the sender’s private key. The receiver uses 
the sender’s public key to decrypt the transmitted value, comparing it to the value listed in 
the header. If the values match, the receiver knows that the sender is authentic.
Table 15-5 summarizes a few of the speciﬁc protocols and tools available for IPsec 
authentication and message integrity.
NOTE
If the VPN uses ESP to encrypt the packets, the HMAC message integrity 
function is not needed, because the attacker would have had to break the encryption key 
before she could have possibly altered the contents of the message.

536     Chapter 15: Virtual Private Networks
The ESP and AH Security Protocols
To perform the VPN functions described in this chapter, IPsec deﬁnes two security 
protocols, with each protocol deﬁning a header. These headers are shown in generic form 
back in Figure 15-1 as the VPN header. These headers simply provide a place to store 
information that is needed for the various VPN functions. For example, the message 
integrity process requires that the sender place the results of the hash function into a header 
and transmit the header (as part of the entire message) to the receiving VPN device, which 
then uses the value stored in that header to complete the message integrity check.
Two of the protocols deﬁned by IPsec are the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and 
the IP Authentication Header (AH). ESP deﬁnes rules for performing the main four 
functions for VPNs, as mentioned throughout this chapter and as summarized in Table 15-
6. AH supports two features, namely, authentication and message integrity. A particular 
IPsec VPN might only use one of the two headers, or both. For example, AH could provide 
authentication and message integrity, with ESP providing data privacy (encryption).

header.

IPsec VPNs     537
IPsec Implementation Considerations
IPsec VPNs provide a secure connection through the unsecure Internet so that hosts can 
behave as if they are connected directly to the corporate network. For site-to-site VPNs, the 
end-user hosts have no idea that a VPN even exists, just as would be the case with a leased 
line or Frame Relay WAN. The user can use any application, just as if he were connected 
to the LAN at the main ofﬁce.
IPsec remote access VPN users enjoy the same functions as do site-to-site VPN users, 
providing the user access to any and all allowed applications. However, remote access 
VPNs do require some additional effort in that each host needs to use the Cisco VPN client 
software. This software implements the IPsec standards on the PC, rather than requiring 
VPN support on a separate device. The installation is not difﬁcult, but it is an additional bit 
of work for each host, whereas compared to a site-to-site VPN implemented with an already 
installed Cisco router, the only requirement might be an upgrade of the Cisco IOS.
To ease the installation and conﬁguration of VPNs, Cisco provides a framework and a set 
of functions called Easy VPN. The problem solved by Easy VPN can be easily understood 
by considering the following example. A company has 200 remote sites with which it wants 
to create an intranet VPN using the Internet. Additionally, this company wants extranet site-
to-site VPN connections to a dozen partners. Finally, 2000 employees own laptops, and 
they all at least occasionally bring home their laptops and connect to the enterprise network 
through the Internet. And, IPsec has many options for each function, requiring 
conﬁguration at each site.
Easy VPN helps solve the administration headaches in such an environment by allowing a 
Cisco Easy VPN server, typically the central site VPN device (for example, an ASA), to 
dynamically inform the remote site devices as to their IPsec VPN conﬁgurations. The 
remote devices—routers, ASAs, laptops with Cisco VPN client software, and so on—act as 
Easy VPN clients, connecting to the Easy VPN server and downloading the conﬁguration 
settings.

538     Chapter 15: Virtual Private Networks
Next, the ﬁnal section of this chapter brieﬂy examines an alternative VPN technology 
called SSL.
SSL VPNs
Today’s commonly used web browsers all support a protocol called Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL). These same browsers also typically support a follow-on but less-well-known 
standard called Transport Layer Security (TLS). This section explains how SSL can be used 
to create access VPNs.
Web browsers use HTTP to connect to web servers. However, when the communications 
with the web server need to be secure, the browser switches to use SSL. SSL uses well-
known port 443, encrypting data sent between the browser and the server, and 
authenticating the user. Then, the HTTP messages ﬂow over the SSL connection.
Most people have used SSL, oftentimes without knowing it. If you have ever used a website 
on the Internet, and needed to supply some credit card information or other personal 
information, the browser probably switched to using SSL. Most browsers show an icon that 
looks like a padlock, with the padlock open when not using SSL and the padlock closed 
(locked) when using SSL.
Web servers can choose when and how to implement SSL. Because SSL requires more work, 
many web servers just use HTTP for supplying general information, switching to use SSL only 
when the user needs to supply sensitive information, such as login credentials and ﬁnancial 
information. However, when an enterprise’s internal web servers need to send data to a home 
user on the other side of the Internet, rather than a user on the enterprise’s local LAN, the server 
might need to secure all communications to the client to prevent the loss of data.
Cisco solves some of the problems associated with internal web access for Internet-based 
users with a feature called Web VPN. Unlike IPsec VPNs, Web VPN typically only allows 
web trafﬁc, as opposed to all trafﬁc. However, a large majority of enterprise applications 
today happen to be web-enabled. For example, most end users need access to internal 
applications, which run from internal web servers and possibly to an e-mail server. If a user 
can check her e-mail from a web browser, most if not all the functions needed by that user 
can be performed from a web browser, and Web VPN can provide a reasonable solution.
NOTE
Rather than refer to both SSL and TLS throughout this section, the text uses the 
more popular SSL term alone. SSL and TLS are not truly equivalent protocols, but they 
perform the same functions, and they are equal to the level of depth described in this chapter.

SSL VPNs     539
Web VPN secures an enterprise home user’s connection to the enterprise network by using SSL 
between the end user and a special Web VPN server. Figure 15-4 shows the general idea.
Figure 15-4
Web VPN Using SSL
To use Web VPN, the Internet-based user opens any web browser and connects to a Cisco 
Web VPN server. The Web VPN server can be implemented by many devices, including an 
ASA. This connection uses SSL for all communications, using the built-in SSL capabilities 
in the web browser, so that all communications between the client and the Web VPN server 
are secure.
The Web VPN server acts as a web server, presenting a web page back to the client. The 
web page lists the enterprise applications available to the client. For example, it might list 
all the typical enterprise web-based applications, the e-mail server’s web-based server, and 
other web-based services. When the user selects an option, the Web VPN server connects 
to that service, using either HTTP or SSL, as required by the server. The Web VPN server 
then passes the HTTP/SSL trafﬁc to and from the real server over the SSL-only connection 
back to the Internet-based client. As a result, all communications over the Internet are 
secured with SSL.
The strength of this Web VPN solution is that it requires no software or special effort from 
the client. Employees can even use their home computer, someone else’s computer, or any 
Internet-connected computer, and connect to the host name of the Web VPN server.
The negative with Web VPN is that it only allows the use of a web browser. If you need to 
use an application that cannot be accessed using a browser, you have a couple of options. 
First, you could implement IPsec VPNs, as already discussed. Alternately, you could use a 
variation on Web VPN in which the client computer loads an SSL-based thin client, much 
in concept like the IPsec-based Cisco VPN client used with IPsec VPNs. The client 
computer could then connect to the Web VPN server using the thin client, and the Web VPN 
server would simply pass the trafﬁc from the PC through to the local LAN, allowing access 
as if the client were connected to the main enterprise network.

drove the requirement for NAT back in the 1990s.
Network Address Translation Concepts: This 
section explains how several different variations

Network Address Translation
This chapter begins Part V, “Scaling the IP Address Space.” The two chapters in this part of 
the book relate to each other in that they explain the two most important solutions to what 
was a huge obstacle for the growth of the Internet. The problem was that the IPv4 address 
space would have been completely consumed by the mid-1990s without some signiﬁcant 
solutions. One of the most signiﬁcant short-term solutions was Network Address 
Translation (NAT), which is the focus of this chapter. The most signiﬁcant long-term 
solution is IPv6, which attacks the problem by making the address space very large. IPv6 
is covered in the next chapter.
This chapter begins with brief coverage of Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR), which 
helps Internet service providers (ISP) manage the IP address space, and private IP 
addressing. The remaining majority of the chapter explains the concepts and conﬁgurations 
related to NAT.

Perspectives on IPv4 Address Scalability     549
Foundation Topics
This chapter covers the details of NAT using three major sections. The ﬁrst section explains 
the challenges to the IPv4 address space caused by the Internet revolution of the 1990s. The 
second section explains the basic concept behind NAT, how several variations of NAT work, 
and how the Port Address Translation (PAT) option conserves the IPv4 address space. The 
ﬁnal section shows how to conﬁgure NAT from the Cisco IOS Software command-line 
interface (CLI), and how to troubleshoot NAT.
For those of you following the optional reading plan for which you move back and forth 
between this book and CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, note that 
Chapter 17 of that book also covers NAT and PAT, with the conﬁguration performed from 
the Security Device Manager (SDM). This chapter necessarily covers some of the same 
underlying concepts, but with a much fuller description of the concepts and conﬁguration.
Perspectives on IPv4 Address Scalability
The original design for the Internet required every organization to ask for, and receive, one 
or more registered classful IP network numbers. The people administering the program 
ensured that none of the IP networks were reused. As long as every organization used only 
IP addresses inside its own registered network numbers, IP addresses would never be 
duplicated, and IP routing could work well.
Connecting to the Internet using only a registered network number, or several registered 
network numbers, worked well for a while. In the early to mid-1990s, it became apparent 
that the Internet was growing so fast that all IP network numbers would be assigned by the 
mid-1990s! Concern arose that the available networks would be completely assigned, and 
some organizations would not be able to connect to the Internet.
The main long-term solution to the IP address scalability problem was to increase the size 
of the IP address. This one fact was the most compelling reason for the advent of IP version 
6 (IPv6). (Version 5 was deﬁned much earlier, but was never deployed, so the next attempt 
was labeled as version 6.) IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, instead of the 32-bit address in IPv4. 
With the same or improved process of assigning unique address ranges to every organization 
connected to the Internet, IPv6 can easily support every organization and individual on the 
planet, with the number of IPv6 addresses theoretically reaching above 1038.
Many short-term solutions to the addressing problem were suggested, but three standards 
worked together to solve the problem. Two of the standards work closely together: Network 
Address Translation (NAT) and private addressing. These features together allow 
organizations to use unregistered IP network numbers internally and still communicate well 

550     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
with the Internet. The third standard, Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR), allows ISPs 
to reduce the wasting of IP addresses by assigning a company a subset of a network number 
rather than the entire network. CIDR also can allow ISPs to summarize routes such that 
multiple Class A, B, or C networks match a single route, which helps reduce the size of 
Internet routing tables.
CIDR
CIDR is a global address assignment convention, deﬁning how the Internet Assigned 
Numbers Authority (IANA), its member agencies, and ISPs should assign the globally 
unique IPv4 address space to individual organizations. CIDR, deﬁned in RFC 4632 
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4632.txt), has two main goals. First, its policies dictate that 
address assignment choices should aid the process of aggregating (summarizing) multiple 
network numbers into a single routing entity, reducing the size of Internet routers’ routing 
tables. The second goal is to allow ISPs to assign address ranges to their customers of sizes 
other than an entire Class A, B, or C network, reducing waste, and putting off the date at 
which no more IPv4 addresses are available to assign to new organizations and people 
wanting to connect to the Internet. The following sections explain a little more detail about 
each of CIDR’s two main goals.
Route Aggregation for Shorter Routing Tables
One of the main goals of CIDR is to allow easier route aggregation in the Internet. Imagine 
a router in the Internet with a route to every Class A, B, and C network on the planet! More 
than 2 million Class C networks exist! If Internet routers had to list every classful network 
in their routing tables, the routers would have to have a lot of memory, and routing table 
searches would require a lot of processing power. By aggregating the routes, fewer routes 
would need to exist in the routing table.
Figure 16-1 shows a typical case of how CIDR might be used to consolidate routes to 
multiple Class C networks into a single route. In the ﬁgure, imagine that ISP 1 owns Class 
C networks 198.0.0.0 through 198.255.255.0 (these might look funny, but they are valid 
Class C network numbers). Without CIDR, all other ISPs’ routing tables would have a 
separate route to each of the 216 Class C networks that begin with 198. With CIDR, as 
shown in the ﬁgure, the other ISPs’ routers have a single route to 198.0.0.0/8—in other 
words, a route to all hosts whose IP address begins with 198. More than 2 million Class C 
networks alone exist, but CIDR has helped Internet routers reduce their routing tables to a 
more manageable size—in the range of a little over 200,000 routes by early 2007.

Perspectives on IPv4 Address Scalability     551
Figure 16-1
Typical Use of CIDR
By using a routing protocol that exchanges the mask as well as the subnet/network number, 
a classless view of the number can be attained. In other words, treat the grouping as a math 
problem, ignoring the Class A, B, and C rules. For example, 198.0.0.0/8 (198.0.0.0, mask 
255.0.0.0) deﬁnes a set of addresses whose ﬁrst 8 bits are equal to decimal 198. ISP 1 
advertises this route to the other ISPs, which need a route only to 198.0.0.0/8. In its routers, 
ISP 1 knows which Class C networks are at which customer sites. This is how CIDR gives 
Internet routers a much more scalable routing table—by reducing the number of entries in 
the tables.
For CIDR to work as shown in Figure 16-1, ISPs need to be in control of consecutive 
network numbers. Today, IP networks are allocated by administrative authorities for 
various regions of the world. The regions in turn allocate consecutive ranges of network 
numbers to particular ISPs in those regions. This allows summarization of multiple 
networks into a single route, as shown in Figure 16-1.
IPv4 Address Conservation
CIDR also helps reduce the chance of our running out of IPv4 addresses for new companies 
connecting to the Internet. Furthermore, CIDR allows an ISP to allocate a subset of a Class 
A, B, or C network to a single customer. For example, imagine that ISP 1’s customer 1 
needs only ten IP addresses and that customer 3 needs 25 IP addresses. ISP 1 does 
something like this: It assigns IP subnet 198.8.3.16/28, with assignable addresses 
198.8.3.17 to 198.8.3.30, to customer 1. For customer 3, ISP 1 suggests 198.8.3.32/27, with 
30 assignable addresses (198.8.3.33 to 198.8.3.62). The ISP has met the customers’ needs 
and still not used all of Class C network 198.8.3.0.

198.255.255.0

255.0.0.0 Points to ISP #1

255.0.0.0 Points to ISP #1

552     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
CIDR helps prevent the wasting of IP addresses, thereby reducing the need for registered 
IP network numbers. Instead of two customers consuming two entire Class C networks, 
each consumes a small portion of a single Class C network. At the same time, CIDR, along 
with the intelligent administration of consecutive network numbers to each ISP, allows the 
Internet routing table to support a much smaller routing table in Internet routers than would 
otherwise be required.
Private Addressing
Some computers might never be connected to the Internet. These computers’ IP addresses 
could be duplicates of registered IP addresses in the Internet. When designing the IP 
addressing convention for such a network, an organization could pick and use any network 
number(s) it wanted, and all would be well. For example, you can buy a few routers, 
connect them in your ofﬁce, and conﬁgure IP addresses in network 1.0.0.0, and it would 
work. The IP addresses you use might be duplicates of real IP addresses in the Internet, but 
if all you want to do is learn on the lab in your ofﬁce, everything will be ﬁne.
When building a private network that will have no Internet connectivity, you can use IP 
network numbers called private internets, as deﬁned in RFC 1918, Address Allocation for 
Private Internets (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt). This RFC deﬁnes a set of networks 
that will never be assigned to any organization as a registered network number. Instead of 
using someone else’s registered network numbers, you can use numbers in a range that are 
not used by anyone else in the public Internet. Table 16-2 shows the private address space 
deﬁned by RFC 1918.
In other words, any organization can use these network numbers. However, no organization 
is allowed to advertise these networks using a routing protocol on the Internet.
You might be wondering why you would bother to reserve special private network numbers 
when it doesn’t matter whether the addresses are duplicates. Well, as it turns out, you can 
use private addressing in an internetwork, and connect to the Internet at the same time, as 
long as you use Network Address Translation (NAT). The rest of the chapter examines and 
explains NAT.

Network Address Translation Concepts     553
Network Address Translation Concepts
NAT, deﬁned in RFC 3022, allows a host that does not have a valid, registered, globally 
unique IP address to communicate with other hosts through the Internet. The hosts might 
be using private addresses or addresses assigned to another organization. In either case, 
NAT allows these addresses that are not Internet-ready to continue to be used and still 
allows communication with hosts across the Internet.
NAT achieves its goal by using a valid registered IP address to represent the private address 
to the rest of the Internet. The NAT function changes the private IP addresses to publicly 
registered IP addresses inside each IP packet, as shown in Figure 16-2.
Figure 16-2
NAT IP Address Swapping: Private Addressing
Notice that the router, performing NAT, changes the packet’s source IP address when the 
packet leaves the private organization. The router performing NAT also changes the 
destination address in each packet that is forwarded back into the private network. 
(Network 200.1.1.0 is a registered network in Figure 16-2.) The NAT feature, conﬁgured in 
the router labeled NAT, performs the translation.
Cisco IOS Software supports several variations of NAT. The next few pages cover the 
concepts behind several of these variations. The section after that covers the conﬁguration 
related to each option.
Static NAT
Static NAT works just like the example shown in Figure 16-2, but with the IP addresses 
statically mapped to each other. To help you understand the implications of static NAT, and 
to explain several key terms, Figure 16-3 shows a similar example with more information.

Figure 16-3
Static NAT Showing Inside Local and Global Addresses
First, the concepts: The company’s ISP has assigned it registered network 200.1.1.0. 
Therefore, the NAT router must make the private IP addresses look like they are in network 
200.1.1.0. To do so, the NAT router changes the source IP addresses in the packets going 
from left to right in the ﬁgure.
In this example, the NAT router changes the source address (“SA” in the ﬁgure) of 10.1.1.1 
to 200.1.1.1. With static NAT, the NAT router simply conﬁgures a one-to-one mapping 
between the private address and the registered address that is used on its behalf. The NAT 
router has statically conﬁgured a mapping between private address 10.1.1.1 and public, 
registered address 200.1.1.1.
Supporting two IP hosts in the private network requires a second static one-to-one mapping 
using a second IP address in the public address range. For example, to support 10.1.1.2, the 
router statically maps 10.1.1.2 to 200.1.1.2. Because the enterprise has a single registered 
Class C network, it can support at most 254 private IP addresses with NAT, with the usual 
two reserved numbers (the network number and network broadcast address).
The terminology used with NAT, particularly with conﬁguration, can be a little confusing. 
Notice in Figure 16-3 that the NAT table lists the private IP addresses as “private” and the 
public, registered addresses from network 200.1.1.0 as “public.” Cisco uses the term inside 
local for the private IP addresses in this example and inside global for the public IP 
addresses.

Network Address Translation Concepts     555
In Cisco terminology, the enterprise network that uses private addresses, and therefore 
needs NAT, is the “inside” part of the network. The Internet side of the NAT function is the 
“outside” part of the network. A host that needs NAT (such as 10.1.1.1 in the example) has 
the IP address it uses inside the network, and it needs an IP address to represent it in the 
outside network. So, because the host essentially needs two different addresses to represent 
it, you need two terms. Cisco calls the private IP address used in the inside network the 
inside local address and the address used to represent the host to the rest of the Internet the 
inside global address. Figure 16-4 repeats the same example, with some of the terminology 
shown.
Figure 16-4
Static NAT Terminology
Most typical NAT conﬁgurations change only the IP address of inside hosts. Therefore, the 
current NAT table shown in Figure 16-4 shows the inside local and corresponding inside 
global registered addresses. However, the outside host IP address can also be changed with 
NAT. When that occurs, the terms outside local and outside global denote the IP address 
used to represent that host in the inside network and the outside network, respectively. Table 
16-3 summarizes the terminology and meanings.

Dynamic NAT
Dynamic NAT has some similarities and differences compared to static NAT. Like static 
NAT, the NAT router creates a one-to-one mapping between an inside local and inside 
global address and changes the IP addresses in packets as they exit and enter the inside 
network. However, the mapping of an inside local address to an inside global address 
happens dynamically.
Dynamic NAT sets up a pool of possible inside global addresses and deﬁnes matching 
criteria to determine which inside local IP addresses should be translated with NAT. For 
example, in Figure 16-5, a pool of ﬁve inside global IP addresses has been established: 
200.1.1.1 through 200.1.1.5. NAT has also been conﬁgured to translate any inside local 
addresses that start with 10.1.1.
Table 16-3
NAT Addressing Terms
Term
Meaning
Inside local
In a typical NAT design, the term inside refers to an address used for a host inside an 
enterprise. An inside local is the actual IP address assigned to a host in the private 
enterprise network. A more descriptive term might be inside private.
Inside global
In a typical NAT design, the term inside refers to an address used for a host inside an 
enterprise. NAT uses an inside global address to represent the inside host as the 
packet is sent through the outside network, typically the Internet. A NAT router 
changes the source IP address of a packet sent by an inside host from an inside local 
address to an inside global address as the packet goes from the inside to the outside 
network.
A more descriptive term might be inside public, because when using RFC 1918 
addresses in an enterprise, the inside global address represents the inside host with a 
public IP address that can be used for routing in the public Internet.
Outside 
global
In a typical NAT design, the term outside refers to an address used for a host outside 
an enterprise—in other words, in the Internet. An outside global address is the actual 
IP address assigned to a host that resides in the outside network, typically the Internet. 
A more descriptive term might be outside public, because the outside global address 
represents the outside host with a public IP address that can be used for routing in the 
public Internet.
Outside local
NAT can translate the outside IP address—the IP address that represents the host 
outside the enterprise network—although this is not a popular option. When a NAT 
router forwards a packet from the inside network to the outside, when using NAT to 
change the outside address, the IP address that represents the outside host as the 
destination IP address in the packet header is called the outside local IP address. A 
more descriptive term might be outside private, because when using RFC 1918 
addresses in an enterprise, the outside local address represents the outside host with a 
private IP address from RFC 1918.

Network Address Translation Concepts     557
Figure 16-5
Dynamic NAT
The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the ﬁgure refer to the following sequence of events:
1.
Host 10.1.1.1 sends its ﬁrst packet to the server at 170.1.1.1.
2.
As the packet enters the NAT router, the router applies some matching logic to decide 
whether the packet should have NAT applied. Because the logic has been conﬁgured 
to match source IP addresses that begin with 10.1.1, the router adds an entry in the NAT 
table for 10.1.1.1 as an inside local address.
3.
The NAT router needs to allocate an IP address from the pool of valid inside global 
addresses. It picks the ﬁrst one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT 
table to complete the entry.
4.
The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.
The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as trafﬁc ﬂows occasionally. You can conﬁgure 
a timeout value that deﬁnes how long the router should wait, having not translated any 
packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry. You can also manually clear 
the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation * command.
NAT can be conﬁgured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the 
inside global address pool. The router allocates addresses from the pool until all are 
allocated. If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but 
all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet. The user must 
try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next

host that sends a packet. Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large 
as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time—
unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.
Overloading NAT with Port Address Translation (PAT)
Some networks need to have most, if not all, IP hosts reach the Internet. If that network uses 
private IP addresses, the NAT router needs a very large set of registered IP addresses. With 
static NAT, for each private IP host that needs Internet access, you need a publicly 
registered IP address, completely defeating the goal of reducing the number of public IPv4 
addresses needed for that organization. Dynamic NAT lessens the problem to some degree, 
because every single host in an internetwork should seldom need to communicate with the 
Internet at the same time. However, if a large percentage of the IP hosts in a network will 
need Internet access throughout that company’s normal business hours, NAT still requires 
a large number of registered IP addresses, again failing to reduce IPv4 address consumption.
The NAT Overload feature, also called Port Address Translation (PAT), solves this problem. 
Overloading allows NAT to scale to support many clients with only a few public IP 
addresses. The key to understanding how overloading works is to recall how hosts use TCP 
and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports. Figure 16-6 details an example that helps make 
the logic behind overloading more obvious.
The top part of the ﬁgure shows a network with three different hosts connecting to a web 
server using TCP. The bottom half of the ﬁgure shows the same network later in the day, 
with three TCP connections from the same client. All six connections connect to the server 
IP address (170.1.1.1) and port (80, the well-known port for web services). In each case, 
the server differentiates between the various connections because their combined IP 
address and port numbers are unique.
NAT takes advantage of the fact that the server doesn’t care whether it has one connection 
each to three different hosts or three connections to a single host IP address. So, to support 
lots of inside local IP addresses with only a few inside global, publicly registered IP 
addresses, NAT overload (PAT) translates both the address and possibly the port numbers 
as well. Figure 16-7 outlines the logic.

Network Address Translation Concepts     559

Three TCP Connections: From Three Different Hosts and from One Host
Figure 16-7
NAT Overload (PAT)
When PAT creates the dynamic mapping, it selects not only an inside global IP address but 
also a unique port number to use with that address. The NAT router keeps a NAT table entry 
for every unique combination of inside local IP address and port, with translation to the 
inside global address and a unique port number associated with the inside global address. 
And because the port number ﬁeld has 16 bits, NAT overload can use more than 65,000 port

numbers, allowing it to scale well without needing many registered IP addresses—in many 
cases, needing only one outside global IP address.
Of the three types of NAT covered in this chapter so far, PAT is by far the most poplar 
option. Static NAT and Dynamic NAT both require a one-to-one mapping from the inside 
local to the inside global address. PAT signiﬁcantly reduces the number of required 
registered IP addresses compared to these other NAT alternatives.
Translating Overlapping Addresses
The ﬁrst three NAT options explained in the previous sections are the most likely to be used 
in most networks. However, yet another variation of NAT exists, one that allows translation 
of both the source and destination IP address. This option is particularly helpful when two 
internetworks use overlapping IP address ranges, for example, when one organization is not 
using private addressing but instead is using a network number registered to another 
company. If one company inappropriately uses a network number that is registered 
appropriately to a different company, and they both connect to the Internet, NAT can be 
used to allow both companies to communicate to hosts in the Internet and to each other. To 
do so, NAT translates both the source and the destination IP addresses in this case. For 
example, consider Figure 16-8, in which company A uses a network that is registered to 
Cisco (170.1.0.0).

Network Address Translation Concepts     561
With an overlapping address space, a client in company A cannot send a packet to the 
legitimate IP host 170.1.1.1—or, if it did, the packet would never get to the real 170.1.1.1. 
Why? The routing tables inside the company (on the left) probably have a route matching 
170.1.1.1 in its routing table. For host 170.1.1.10 in the ﬁgure, it is in the subnet in which 
the “private“ 170.1.1.1 would reside, so host 170.1.1.10 would not even try to forward 
packets destined for 170.1.1.1 to a router. Instead, it would forward them directly to host 
170.1.1.1, assuming that it was on the same LAN! NAT can solve this problem, but both the 
source and the destination addresses must be changed as the packet passes through the NAT 
router. In Figure 16-8, notice that the original packet sent by the client has a destination 
address of 192.168.1.1. That address, called the outside local address, represents the server 
outside the company. Outside means that the address represents the host that physically sits 
in the “outside“ part of the network. Local means that this address represents the host on 
the private side of the network.
As the packet passes through the NAT router (from left to right), the source address is 
changed, just like in the previous examples. However, the destination address is also 
changed, in this case, to 170.1.1.1. The destination address is also called the outside global 
address at this point, because it represents a host that is always physically on the outside 
network, and the address is the global, publicly registered IP address that can be routed 
through the Internet.
The NAT conﬁguration includes a static mapping between the real IP address (outside 
global), 170.1.1.1, and the private IP address (outside local) used to represent it inside the 
private network—192.168.1.1.
Because the client initiates a connection to the server on the right, the NAT router not only 
must translate addresses, but it also must modify Domain Name System (DNS) responses. 
The client, for example, performs a DNS request for www.cisco.com. When the DNS reply 
comes back (from right to left) past the NAT router, NAT changes the DNS reply so that the 
client in the company thinks that www.cisco.com’s IP address is 192.168.1.1.
Today, given a choice, companies tend to simply use private addressing to avoid the need 
to translate both IP addresses in each packet. Also, the NAT router needs a static entry for 
every server in the overlapped network number—a potentially painstaking task. By using 
private addresses, you can use NAT to connect the network to the Internet and reduce the 
number of registered IP addresses needed, and have to perform only the NAT function for 
the private address in each packet.

562     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
Table 16-4 summarizes the use of NAT terminology in Figure 16-8.
NAT Configuration and Troubleshooting
In the following sections, you read about how to conﬁgure the three most common 
variations of NAT: static NAT, dynamic NAT, and PAT, along with the show and debug 
commands used to troubleshoot NAT.
Static NAT Configuration
Static NAT conﬁguration, as compared to the other variations of NAT, requires the fewest 
conﬁguration steps. Each static mapping between a local (private) address and a global 
(public) address must be conﬁgured. Additionally, the router must be told on which 
interfaces it should use NAT, because NAT does not have to be enabled on every interface. 
In particular, the router needs to know each interface and whether the interface is an inside 
or outside interface. The speciﬁc steps are as follows:
Step 1 Conﬁgure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design using the ip nat 
inside interface subcommand.
Step 2 Conﬁgure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design using the 
ip nat outside interface subcommand.
Step 3 Conﬁgure the static mappings with the ip nat inside source static inside-
local inside-global global conﬁguration command.
Figure 16-9 shows the familiar network used in the description of static NAT earlier in this 
chapter, which is also used for the ﬁrst several conﬁguration examples. In Figure 16-9, you 
can see that FredsCo has obtained Class C network 200.1.1.0 as a registered network 
number. That entire network, with mask 255.255.255.0, is conﬁgured on the serial link 
between FredsCo and the Internet. With a point-to-point serial link, only two of the 254 
valid IP addresses in that network are consumed, leaving 252 addresses.

NAT IP Address Swapping: Private Networks
When planning a NAT conﬁguration, you must ﬁnd some IP addresses to use as inside 
global IP addresses. Because these addresses must be part of some registered IP address 
range, it is common to use the extra addresses in the subnet connecting the enterprise to the 
Internet—for example, the extra 252 IP addresses in network 200.1.1.0 in this case. The 
router can also be conﬁgured with a loopback interface and assigned an IP address that is 
part of a globally unique range of registered IP addresses.
Example 16-1 lists the NAT conﬁguration, using 200.1.1.1 and 200.1.1.2 for the two static 
NAT mappings.

564     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
The static mappings are created using the ip nat inside source static command. The inside 
keyword means that NAT translates addresses for hosts on the inside part of the network. 
The source keyword means that NAT translates the source IP address of packets coming 
into its inside interfaces. The static keyword means that the parameters deﬁne a static entry, 
which should never be removed from the NAT table because of timeout. Because the design 
calls for two hosts, 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, to have Internet access, two ip nat inside 
commands are needed.
After creating the static NAT entries, the router needs to know which interfaces are “inside” 
and which are “outside.” The ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface subcommands 
identify each interface appropriately.
A couple of show commands list the most important information about NAT. The show ip 
nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the conﬁguration. The 
show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of 
currently active translation table entries. The statistics also include the number of hits, 
which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.
Dynamic NAT Configuration
As you might imagine, dynamic NAT conﬁguration differs in some ways from static NAT, 
but it has some similarities as well. Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be 
identiﬁed as either an inside or outside interface, and of course static mapping is no longer 
required. Dynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local

NAT Configuration and Troubleshooting     565
(private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it deﬁnes a pool of 
registered public IP addresses to allocate. The speciﬁc steps are as follows:
Step 1 As with static NAT, conﬁgure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design 
using the ip nat inside interface subcommand.
Step 2 As with static NAT, conﬁgure interfaces to be in the outside part of the 
NAT design using the ip nat outside interface subcommand.
Step 3 Conﬁgure an ACL that matches the packets coming in inside interfaces 
for which NAT should be performed.
Step 4 Conﬁgure the pool of public registered IP addresses using the ip nat pool 
name ﬁrst-address last-address mask subnet-mask global conﬁguration 
command.
Step 5 Enable dynamic NAT by referencing the ACL (Step 3) and pool (Step 4) 
with the ip nat source list acl-number pool pool-name global 
conﬁguration command.
The next example uses the same network topology as the previous example (see Figure 16-
9). In this case, the same two inside local addresses, 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, need translation. 
The same inside global addresses used in the static mappings in the previous example, 
200.1.1.1 and 200.1.1.2, are instead placed in a pool of dynamically assignable inside 
global addresses. Example 16-2 shows the conﬁguration as well as some show commands.

566     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
The conﬁguration for dynamic NAT includes a pool of inside global addresses as well as an 
IP access list to deﬁne the inside local addresses for which NAT is performed. The ip nat 
pool command lists the ﬁrst and last numbers in a range of inside global addresses. For 
example, if the pool needed ten addresses, the command might have listed 200.1.1.1 and 
200.1.1.10. The required netmask parameter performs a kind of veriﬁcation check on the 
range of addresses. If the address range would not be in the same subnet assuming the 
conﬁgured netmask was used, then IOS will reject the ip nat pool command. In this case, 
subnet 200.1.1.0, mask 255.255.255.252 (the conﬁgured netmask) would include 
200.1.1.1 and 200.1.1.2 in the range of valid addresses, so IOS accepts this command.
Like static NAT, dynamic NAT uses the ip nat inside source command. Unlike static NAT, 
the dynamic NAT version of this command refers to the name of the NAT pool it wants to 
use for inside global addresses—in this case, fred. It also refers to an IP ACL, which deﬁnes 
the matching logic for inside local IP addresses. The ip nat inside source list 1 pool fred 
command maps between hosts matched by ACL 1 and the pool called fred, which was 
created by the ip nat pool fred command.
Example 16-2 ends with a couple of show commands that conﬁrm that the router does not 
yet have any NAT translation table entries. At ﬁrst, the show ip nat translations and show 
ip nat statistics commands display either nothing or minimal conﬁguration information. 
At this point, neither host 10.1.1.1 nor 10.1.1.2 has sent any packets, and NAT has not 
created any dynamic entries in the NAT table or translated addresses in any packets.
The show ip nat statistics command at the end of the example lists some particularly 
interesting troubleshooting information with two different counters labeled “misses,” as 
highlighted in the example. The ﬁrst occurrence of this counter counts the number of times 
a new packet comes along, needing a NAT entry, and not ﬁnding one. At that point, dynamic 
NAT reacts and builds an entry. The second misses counter at the end of the command 
NAT# sssshhhhoooowwww    iiiipppp    nnnnaaaatttt    ssssttttaaaattttiiiissssttttiiiiccccssss

output lists the number of misses in the pool. This counter only increments when dynamic 
NAT tries to allocate a new NAT table entry and ﬁnds no available addresses, so the packet 
cannot be translated—probably resulting in an end user not getting to the application.
To see the misses counter and several other interesting facts, Example 16-3 continues the 
example started in Example 16-2. This example shows the results when hosts 10.1.1.1 and 
10.1.1.2 start creating TCP connections, in this case with Telnet. This example picks up

568     Chapter 16: Network Address Translation
The example begins with host 10.1.1.1 telnetting to 170.1.1.1 (not shown), with the NAT 
router creating a NAT entry. The NAT table shows a single entry, mapping 10.1.1.1 to 
200.1.1.1. Note that the ﬁrst misses counter in the show ip nat statistics command lists 1 
miss, meaning that the ﬁrst packet in host 10.1.1.1’s TCP connection to 170.1.1.1 occurred 
and caused the router to not ﬁnd a NAT table entry, incrementing the counter. The misses 
counter at the end of the output did not increment, because the router was able to allocate 
a pool member and add a NAT table entry. Also note that the last line lists statistics on the 
number of pool members allocated (1) and the percentage of the pool currently in use 
(50%).
The NAT table entry times out after a period of inactivity. However, to force the entry out 
of the table, the clear ip nat translation * command can be used. As shown in Table 16-7 
at the end of the chapter, this command has several variations. Example 16-3 uses the brute 
force option—clear ip nat translation *—which removes all dynamic NAT table entries. 
The command can also delete individual entries by referencing the IP addresses.
After clearing the NAT entry, host 10.1.1.2 telnets to 170.1.1.1. The show ip nat 
translations command now shows a mapping between 10.1.1.2 and 200.1.1.1. Because 
200.1.1.1 is no longer allocated in the NAT table, the NAT router can allocate it for the next 
NAT request. (Cisco IOS tends to pick the lowest available IP address when choosing the 
next IP address from the pool.)
Finally, at the end of Example 16-3, you see that host 10.1.1.1 has telnetted to another host 
in the Internet, plus the output from the debug ip nat command. This debug command 
causes the router to issue a message every time a packet has its address translated for NAT. 
You generate the output results by entering a few lines from the Telnet connection from 
10.1.1.1 to 170.1.1.1. Notice that the output implies a translation from 10.1.1.1 to 200.1.1.2, 
but it does not imply any translation of the outside address.
NAT Overload (PAT) Configuration
NAT overload, as mentioned earlier, allows NAT to support many inside local IP addresses 
with only one or a few inside global IP addresses. By essentially translating the private IP 
address and port number to a single inside global address, but with a unique port number, 
NAT can support many (over 65,000) private hosts with only a single public, global address.
Two variations of PAT conﬁguration exist in IOS. If PAT uses a pool of inside global 
addresses, the conﬁguration looks exactly like dynamic NAT, except the ip nat inside 
source list global command has an overload keyword added to the end. If PAT just needs 
to use one inside global IP address, PAT can use one of its interface IP addresses. Because 
NAT can support over 65,000 concurrent ﬂows with a single inside global address, a single 
public IP address can support an entire organization’s NAT needs.

NAT Configuration and Troubleshooting     569
The following checklist details the conﬁguration when using a NAT pool:
Use the same steps for conﬁguring dynamic NAT, as outlined in the previous 
section, but include the overload keyword at the end of the ip nat inside 
source list global command.
The following checklist details the conﬁguration when using an interface IP address as the 
sole inside global IP address:
Step 1 As with dynamic and static NAT, conﬁgure inside interfaces with the ip nat inside 
interface subcommand.
Step 2 As with dynamic and static NAT, conﬁgure outside interfaces with the ip 
nat outside interface subcommand.
Step 3 As with dynamic NAT, conﬁgure an ACL that matches the packets 
coming in inside interfaces.
Step 4 Conﬁgure the ip nat source list acl-number interface interface name/
number overload global conﬁguration command, referring to the ACL 
created in Step 3 and to the interface whose IP address will be used for 
translations.
Example 16-2 shows a dynamic NAT conﬁguration. To convert it to a PAT conﬁguration, 
the ip nat inside source list pool fred overload command would be used instead, simply 
adding the overload keyword.
The next example shows PAT conﬁguration using a single interface IP address. Figure 16-10 
shows the same familiar network, with a few changes. In this case, the ISP has given 
FredsCo a subset of network 200.1.1.0: CIDR subnet 200.1.1.248/30. In other words, this 
subnet has two usable addresses: 200.1.1.249 and 200.1.1.250. These addresses are used on 
either end of the serial link between FredsCo and its ISP. The NAT feature on FredsCo’s 
router translates all NAT addresses to its serial IP address, 200.1.1.249.
In Example 16-4, which shows the NAT overload conﬁguration, NAT translates using 
inside global address 200.1.1.249 only, so the NAT pool is not required. In the example, as 
implied in Figure 16-10, host 10.1.1.1 creates two Telnet connections, and host 10.1.1.2 
creates one Telnet connection, causing three dynamic NAT entries, each using inside global 
address 200.1.1.249, but each with a unique port number.

NAT Configuration and Troubleshooting     571
The ip nat inside source list 1 interface serial 0/0 overload command has several 
parameters, but if you understand the dynamic NAT conﬁguration, the new parameters 
shouldn’t be too hard to grasp. The list 1 parameter means the same thing as it does for 
dynamic NAT: Inside local IP addresses matching ACL 1 have their addresses translated. 
The interface serial 0/0 parameter means that the only inside global IP address available 
is the IP address of the NAT router’s interface serial 0/0. Finally, the overload parameter 
means that overload is enabled. Without this parameter, the router does not perform 
overload, just dynamic NAT.
As you can see in the output of the show ip nat translations command, three translations 
have been added to the NAT table. Before this command, host 10.1.1.1 creates two Telnet 
connections to 170.1.1.1, and host 10.1.1.2 creates a single Telnet connection. Three entries 
are created, one for each unique combination of inside local IP address and port.
NAT Troubleshooting
The ﬁrst three major parts of this book devote an entire chapter to troubleshooting. In each 
of those parts, the chapters cover a wide variety of topics that are related in regard to the 
technical topics covered in each chapter. The troubleshooting chapters (3, 7, and 11) explain 
the details of troubleshooting each technology area, but they also help pull some of the 
related concepts together.
The majority of NAT troubleshooting issues relate to getting the conﬁguration correct. The 
following list summarizes some hints and tips about how to ﬁnd the most common NAT 
conﬁguration problems. Following the list, the text explains one common routing problem 
that can prevent NAT from working, which relates mainly to ensuring that the conﬁguration 
is correct.
■
Ensure that the conﬁguration includes the ip nat inside or ip nat outside interface 
subcommand. These commands enable NAT on the interfaces, and the inside/outside 
designation is important.
Total active translations: 3 (0 static, 3 dynamic; 3 extended)
Outside interfaces:
  Serial0/0
Inside interfaces:
  Ethernet0/0
Hits: 103  Misses: 3
Expired translations: 0
Dynamic mappings:

■
For static NAT, ensure that the ip nat source static command lists the inside local 
address ﬁrst and the inside global IP address second.
■
For dynamic NAT, ensure that the ACL conﬁgured to match packets sent by the inside 
host match that host’s packets, before any NAT translation has occurred. For example, 
if an inside local address of 10.1.1.1 should be translated to 200.1.1.1, ensure that the 
ACL matches source address 10.1.1.1, not 200.1.1.1.
■
For dynamic NAT without PAT, ensure that the pool has enough IP addresses. 
Symptoms of not having enough addresses include a growing value in the second 
misses counter in the show ip nat statistics command output, as well as seeing all the 
addresses in the range deﬁned in the NAT pool in the list of dynamic translations.
■
For PAT, it is easy to forget to add the overload option on the ip nat inside source list 
command. Without it, NAT works, but PAT does not, often resulting in users’ packets 
not being translated and hosts not being able to get to the Internet.
■
Perhaps NAT has been conﬁgured correctly, but an ACL exists on one of the interfaces, 
discarding the packets. Note that IOS processes ACLs before NAT for packets entering 
an interface, and after translating the addresses for packets exiting an interface.
Finally, the NAT function on one router can be impacted by a routing problem that occurs 
on another router. The routers in the outside part of the network, oftentimes the Internet, 
need to be able to route packets to the inside global IP addresses conﬁgured on the NAT 
router. For example, Figure 16-4, earlier in this chapter, shows the ﬂow of packets from 
inside to outside, and outside to inside. Focusing on the outside-to-inside ﬂow, the routers 
in the Internet needed to know how to route packets to public registered IP address 
200.1.1.1. Typically, this address range would be advertised by a dynamic routing protocol. 
So, if a review of the NAT conﬁguration shows that the conﬁguration looks correct, look at 
the routes in both the NAT router and other routers to ensure that the routers can forward 
the packets, based on the addresses used on both sides of the router performing the NAT 
function.

IP Version 6
IP version 6 (IPv6), the replacement protocol for IPv4, is well known for a couple of 
reasons. IPv6 provides the ultimate solution for the problem of running out of IPv4 
addresses in the global Internet by using a 128-bit address—approximately 1038 total 
addresses, versus the mere (approximate) 4*109 total addresses in IPv4. However, IPv6 has 
been the ultimate long-term solution for over ten years, in part because the interim 
solutions, including Network Address Translation/Port Address Translation (NAT/PAT), 
have thankfully delayed the day in which we truly run out of public unicast IP addresses.
This chapter focuses on IPv6 addressing and routing, in part because the primary 
motivation for the eventual migration to IPv6 is to relieve the address constraints of IPv4. 
This chapter also brieﬂy introduces some of the other features of IPv6, as well as explains 
some of the reasons for the need for IPv6.

580     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
Foundation Topics
The world has changed tremendously over the last 10–20 years as a result of the growth and 
maturation of the Internet and networking technologies in general. Twenty years ago, no 
global network existed to which the general populace could easily connect. Ten years ago, 
the public Internet had grown to the point where people in most parts of the world could 
connect to the Internet, but with most Internet users being the more computer-savvy people. 
Today, practically everyone seems to have access, through their PCs, handheld devices, 
phones, or even the refrigerator.
The eventual migration to IPv6 will likely be driven by the need for more addresses. 
Practically every mobile phone supports Internet trafﬁc, requiring the use of an IP address. 
Most new cars have the ability to acquire and use an IP address, along with wireless 
communications, allowing the car dealer to contact the customer when the car’s diagnostics 
detect a problem with the car. Some manufacturers have embraced the idea that all their 
appliances need to be IP enabled.
Besides the sheer growth in the need for IPv4 addresses, edicts from governmental agencies 
could drive demand for IPv6. As of this writing, the U.S. government had set a date in 2008 
by which all government agencies should be running IPv6 in their core IP networks. Such 
initiatives can help drive adoption of IPv6.
While the two biggest reasons why networks might migrate to IPv6 are the need for more 
addresses and mandates from government organizations, at least IPv6 includes some 
attractive features and migration tools. Some of those advantages are as follows:
■
Address assignment features: IPv6 address assignment allows easier renumbering, 
dynamic allocation, and recovery of addresses, with nice features for mobile devices 
to move around and keep their IP address (thereby avoiding having to close and reopen 
an application).
■
Aggregation: IPv6’s huge address space makes for much easier aggregation of blocks 
of addresses in the Internet.
■
No need for NAT/PAT: Using publicly registered unique addresses on all devices 
removes the need for NAT/PAT, which also avoids some of the application layer and 
VPN-tunneling issues caused by NAT.
■
IPsec: IPsec works with both IPv4 and IPv6, but it is required on IPv6 hosts, so you 
can rely on support for IPsec as needed for VPN tunneling.

Global Unicast Addressing, Routing, and Subnetting     581
■
Header improvements: While it might seem like a small issue, the IPv6 header 
improves several things compared to IPv4. In particular, routers do not need to 
recalculate a header checksum for every packet, reducing per-packet overhead. 
Additionally, the header includes a ﬂow label that allows easy identiﬁcation of packets 
sent over the same single TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connection.
■
Transition tools: As is covered in the last major section of this chapter, IPv6 has many 
tools to help with the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.
The worldwide migration from IPv4 to IPv6 will not be an event, or even a year on the 
calendar. Rather, it will be a long process, a process that has already begun. Network 
engineers have a growing need to learn more about IPv6. This chapter covers the basics of 
IPv6, ending with some discussions about the issues of living in a world in which both IPv4 
and IPv6 will likely coexist for quite a long time.
Global Unicast Addressing, Routing, and Subnetting
One of the original design goals for the Internet was that all organizations would register 
and be assigned one or more public IP networks (Class A, B, or C). By registering to use a 
particular public network number, the company or organization using that network was 
assured by the numbering authorities that no other company or organization in the world 
would be using the addresses in that network. As a result, all hosts in the world would have 
globally unique IP addresses.
From the perspective of the Internet infrastructure, in particular the goal of keeping Internet 
routers’ routing tables from getting too large, assigning an entire network to each 
organization helped to some degree. The Internet routers could ignore all subnets, instead 
having a route for each classful network. For example, if a company registered and was 
assigned Class B network 128.107.0.0/16, the Internet routers just needed one route for that 
entire network.
Over time, the Internet grew tremendously. It became clear by the early 1990s that 
something had to be done, or the growth of the Internet would grind to a halt when all the 
public IP networks were assigned, and no more existed. Additionally, the IP routing tables 
in Internet routers were becoming too large for the router technology of that day. So, the 
Internet community worked together to come up with both some short-term and long-term 
solutions to two problems: the shortage of public addresses and the size of the routing 
tables.
NOTE
Information Week (http://www.informationweek.com) published an interesting 
article about the need to migrate to IPv6, around the time this book was being completed. 
To see the article, search the website for the article “The Impending Internet Address 
Shortage.”

582     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
The short-term solutions included a much smarter public address assignment policy, where 
public addresses were not assigned as only Class A, B, and C networks, but as smaller 
subdivisions (preﬁxes), reducing waste. Additionally, the growth of the Internet routing 
tables was reduced by smarter assignment of the address ranges. For example, assigning the 
Class C networks that begin with 198 to only a particular Internet service provider (ISP) in 
a particular part of the world allowed other ISPs to use one route for 198.0.0.0/8—in other 
words, all addresses that begin with 198—rather than a route for each of the 65,536 
different Class C networks that begin with 198. Finally, NAT/PAT achieved amazing results 
by allowing a typical home or small ofﬁce to consume only one public IPv4 address, greatly 
reducing the need for public IPv4 addresses.
The ultimate solution to both problems is IPv6. The sheer number of IPv6 addresses takes 
care of the issue of running out of addresses. The address assignment policies already used 
with IPv4 have been reﬁned and applied to IPv6, with good results for keeping the size of 
IPv6 routing tables smaller in Internet routers. The following sections provide a general 
discussion of both issues, in particular how global unicast addresses, along with good 
administrative choices for how to assign IPv6 address preﬁxes, aid in routing in the global 
Internet. These sections conclude with a discussion of subnetting in IPv6.
Global Route Aggregation for Efficient Routing
By the time IPv6 was being deﬁned in the early 1990s, it was clear that thoughtful choices 
about how to assign the public IPv4 address space could help with the efﬁciency of Internet 
routers by keeping their routing tables much smaller. By following those same well-earned 
lessons, IPv6 public IP address assignment can make for even more efﬁcient routing as the 
Internet migrates to IPv6.
The address assignment strategy for IPv6 is elegant, but simple, and can be roughly 
summarized as follows:
■
Public IPv6 addresses are grouped (numerically) by major geographic region.
■
Inside each region, the address space is further subdivided by ISP inside that region.
■
Inside each ISP in a region, the address space is further subdivided for each customer.
The same organizations handle this address assignment for IPv6 as for IPv4. The Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Network Numbers (ICANN, http://www.icann.org) owns the 
process. ICANN assigns one or more IPv6 address ranges to each Regional Internet 
Registry (RIR), of which ﬁve exist at the time of publication, roughly covering North 
America, Central/South America, Europe, Asia/Paciﬁc, and Africa. These RIRs then 
subdivide their assigned address space into smaller portions, assigning preﬁxes to different 

Global Unicast Addressing, Routing, and Subnetting     583
ISPs and other smaller registries, with the ISPs then assigning even smaller ranges of 
addresses to their customers.
The IPv6 global address assignment plan results in more efﬁcient routing, as shown in 
Figure 17-1. The ﬁgure shows a ﬁctitious company (Company1) that has been assigned an 
IPv6 preﬁx by a ﬁctitious ISP, NA-ISP1 (standing for North American ISP number 1). The 
ﬁgure lists the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), which is the RIR for North 
America.
Figure 17-1
Conceptual View of IPv6 Global Routes 
As shown in the ﬁgure, the routers installed by ISPs in other major geographies of the world 
can have a single route that matches all IPv6 addresses in North America. While hundreds 
of ISPs might be operating in north America, and hundreds of thousands of enterprise 
customers of those ISPs, and tens of millions of individual customers of those ISPs, all the 
public IPv6 addresses can be from one (or a few) very large address blocks—requiring only 
one (or a few) routes on the Internet routers in other parts of the world. Similarly, routers

inside other ISPs in North America (for example, NA-ISP2, indicating North American ISP 
number 2 in the ﬁgure) can have one route that matches all address ranges assigned to NA-
ISP2. And the routers inside NA-ISP1 just need to have one route that matches the entire 
address range assigned to Company1, rather than needing to know about all the subnets 
inside Company1.
Besides keeping the routers’ routing table much smaller, this process also results in fewer 
changes to Internet routing tables. For example, if NA-ISP1 signed a service contract with 
another enterprise customer, NA-ISP1 could assign another preﬁx inside the range of 
addresses already assigned to NA-ISP1 by ARIN. The routers outside NA-ISP1’s 
network—the majority of the Internet—do not need to know any new routes, because their 
existing routes already match the address range assigned to the new customer. The NA-
ISP2 routers (another ISP) already have a route that matches the entire address range 
assigned to NA-ISP1, so they do not need any more routes. Likewise, the routers in ISPs in 
Europe and South America already have a route that works as well.
While the general concept might not be too difﬁcult, a speciﬁc example can help. Before 
seeing a speciﬁc example, however, it helps to know a bit about how IPv6 addresses and 
preﬁxes are written.
Conventions for Representing IPv6 Addresses
IPv6 conventions use 32 hexadecimal numbers, organized into 8 quartets of 4 hex digits 
separated by a colon, to represent a 128-bit IPv6 address. For example:
2340:1111:AAAA:0001:1234:5678:9ABC
Each hex digit represents 4 bits, so if you want to examine the address in binary, the 
conversion is relatively easy if you memorize the values shown in Table 17-2.

Global Unicast Addressing, Routing, and Subnetting     585
Writing or typing 32 hexadecimal digits, while more convenient than doing the same with 
128 binary digits, can still be a pain. To make things a little easier, two conventions allow 
you to shorten what must be typed for an IPv6 address:
■
Omit the leading 0s in any given quartet.
■
Represent 1 or more consecutive quartets of all hex 0s with a double colon (::), but only 
for one such occurrence in a given address.
For example, consider the following address. The bold digits represent digits in which the 
address could be abbreviated.
FE00:0000:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0056
This address has two different locations in which one or more quartets have 4 hex 0s, so 
two main options exist for abbreviating this address, using the :: abbreviation in one or the 
other location. The following two options show the two briefest valid abbreviations:
■
FE00::1:0:0:0:56
■
FE00:0:0:1::56
In particular, note that the :: abbreviation, meaning “one or more quartets of all 0s,” cannot 
be used twice, because that would be ambiguous. So, the abbreviation FE00::1::56 would 
not be valid.
Conventions for Writing IPv6 Prefixes
IPv6 preﬁxes represent a range or block of consecutive IPv6 addresses. The number that 
represents the range of addresses, called a preﬁx, is usually seen in IP routing tables, just 
like you see IP subnet numbers in IPv4 routing tables.
Before examining IPv6 preﬁxes in more detail, it is helpful to review a few terms used with 
IPv4. IPv4 addresses can be analyzed and understood using either classful addressing rules 
or classless addressing rules. (This book and CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide both use classful terminology for the most part.) Classful addressing 
means that the analysis of an IP address or subnet includes the idea of a classful network 
number, with a separate network part of the address. The top part of Figure 17-2 reviews 
these concepts.
NOTE
For IPv6, a quartet is one set of 4 hex digits in an IPv6 address. Eight quartets 
are in each IPv6 address.

586     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
Figure 17-2
IPv4 Classless and Classful Addressing, and IPv6 Addressing
Thinking about IPv4 addressing as classful addresses helps to fully understand some issues 
in networking. With classful addressing, for example, the written value 128.107.3.0/24 
means 16 network bits (because the address is in a Class B network) and 8 host bits 
(because the mask has 8 binary 0s), leaving 8 subnet bits. The same value, interpreted with 
classless rules, means preﬁx 128.107.3.0, preﬁx length 24. Same subnet/preﬁx, same 
meaning, same router operation, same conﬁguration—it’s just two different ways to think 
about the meaning of the numbers.
IPv6 uses a classless view of addressing, with no concept of classful addressing. Like IPv4, 
IPv6 preﬁxes list some value, a slash, and then a numeric preﬁx length. Like IPv4 preﬁxes, 
the last part of the number, beyond the length of the preﬁx, is represented by binary 0s. And 
ﬁnally, IPv6 preﬁx numbers can be abbreviated with the same rules as IPv4 addresses. For 
example, consider the following IPv6 address that is assigned to a host on a LAN:
2000:1234:5678:9ABC:1234:5678:9ABC:1111/64
This value represents the full 128-bit IP address; in fact, you have no opportunities to abbreviate 
this address. However, the /64 means that the preﬁx (subnet) in which this address resides is the 
subnet that includes all addresses that begin with the same ﬁrst 64 bits as the address. 
Conceptually, it is the same logic as an IPv4 address. For example, address 128.107.3.1/24 is in 
the preﬁx (subnet) whose ﬁrst 24 bits are the same values as address 128.107.3.1.
Like with IPv4, when writing or typing a preﬁx, the bits past the end of the preﬁx length 
are all binary 0s. In the IPv6 address shown previously, the preﬁx in which the address 
resides would be as follows:
2000:1234:5678:9ABC:0000:0000:0000:0000/64

When abbreviated, this would be:

Next, one last fact about the rules for writing preﬁxes before seeing some examples and 
moving on. If the preﬁx length is not a multiple of 16, the boundary between the preﬁx and 
the host part of the address is inside a quartet. In such cases, the preﬁx value should list all 
the values in the last octet in the preﬁx part of the value. For example, if the address just 
shown with a /64 preﬁx length instead had a /56 preﬁx length, the preﬁx would include all 
the ﬁrst 3 quartets (a total of 48 bits), plus the ﬁrst 8 bits of the fourth octet. The last 8 bits 
(last 2 hex digits) of the fourth octet should now be binary 0s. So, by convention, the rest 
of the fourth octet should be written, after being set to binary 0s, as follows:
2000:1234:5678:9A00::/56
The following list summarizes some key points about how to write IPv6 preﬁxes:
■
The preﬁx has the same value as the IP addresses in the group for the ﬁrst number of 
bits, as deﬁned by the preﬁx length.
■
Any bits after the preﬁx-length number of bits are binary 0s.
■
The preﬁx can be abbreviated with the same rules as IPv6 addresses.
■
If the preﬁx length is not on a quartet boundary, write down the value for the entire 
quartet.
Examples can certainly help a lot in this case. Table 17-3 shows several sample preﬁxes, 
their format, and a brief explanation.
Almost as important to this convention is to note which options are not allowed. For 
example, 2::/3 is not allowed instead of 2000::/3, because it omits the rest of the octet, and

a device could not tell whether 2::/3 means “hex 0002” or “hex 2000.” Only leading 0s in 
a quartet, and not trailing 0s, can be omitted when abbreviating an IPv6 address or preﬁx.
Now that you understand a few of the conventions about how to represent IPv6 addresses 
and preﬁxes, a speciﬁc example can show how ICANN’s IPv6 global unicast IP address 
assignment strategy can allow the easy and efﬁcient routing shown back in Figure 17-1.
Global Unicast Prefix Assignment Example
IPv6 standards reserve the 2000::/3 preﬁx—which, when interpreted more fully, means all 
addresses that begin with binary 001 or either a hex 2 or 3—as global unicast addresses. 
Global unicast addresses are addresses that have been assigned as public and globally 
unique IPv6 addresses, allowing hosts using those addresses to communicate through the 
Internet without the need for NAT. In other words, these addresses ﬁt the purest design for 
how to implement IPv6 for the global Internet.
Figure 17-3 shows an example set of preﬁxes that could result in a company (Company1) 
being assigned a preﬁx of 2340:1111:AAAA::/48.

The process starts with ICANN, which owns the entire IPv6 address space, and assigns the 
rights to registry preﬁx 2340::/12 to one of the RIRs, ARIN in this case (North America). 
This means that ARIN has the rights to assign any IPv6 addresses that begin with the ﬁrst 
12 bits of hex 2340 (binary value 0010 0011 0100). For perspective, that’s a large group of 
addresses—2116 to be exact.
Next, NA-ISP1 asks ARIN for a preﬁx assignment. After ARIN ensures that NA-ISP1 
meets some requirements, ARIN might assign ISP preﬁx 2340:1111::/32 to NA-ISP1. This 
too is a large group—296 addresses to be exact. For perspective, this one address block 
might well be enough public IPv6 addresses for even the largest ISP, without that ISP ever 
needing another IPv6 preﬁx.
Finally, Company1 asks its ISP, NA-ISP1, for the assignment of an IPv6 preﬁx. NA-ISP1 
assigns Company1 the site preﬁx 2340:1111:AAAA::/48, which is again a large range of 
addresses—280 in this case. In the next paragraph, the text shows what Company1 could do 
with that preﬁx, but ﬁrst, examine Figure 17-4, which presents the same concepts as shown 
in Figure 17-1, but now with the preﬁxes shown.

The ﬁgure shows the perspectives of routers outside North America, routers from another 
ISP in North America, and other routers in the same ISP. Routers outside North America 
can use a route for preﬁx 2340::/12, knowing that ICANN assigned this preﬁx to be used 
only by ARIN. This one route could match all IPv6 addresses assigned in North America. 
Routers in NA-ISP2, an example alternative ISP in North America, need one route for 
2340:1111::/32, the preﬁx assigned to NA-ISP1. This one route could match all packets 
destined for all customers of NA-ISP1. Inside NA-ISP1, its routers need to know to which 
NA-ISP1 router to forward packets to for that particular customer (the router named ISP-1 
in this case), so the routes inside NA-ISP1’s routers lists a preﬁx of 2340:1111:AAAA/48.
Subnetting Global Unicast IPv6 Addresses Inside an Enterprise
The original IPv4 Internet design called for each organization to be assigned a classful 
network number, with the enterprise subdividing the network into smaller address ranges 
by subnetting the classful network. This same concept of subnetting carries over from IPv4 
to IPv6, with the enterprise subnetting the preﬁx assigned by its ISP into smaller preﬁxes. 
When thinking about the IPv6 subnetting concept, you could make the following general 
analogies with classful IPv4 subnetting to help understand the process:
■
The preﬁx assigned to the enterprise by the ISP, which must be the same for all IPv6 
addresses in one enterprise, is like the IPv4 network part of an address.
■
The enterprise engineer extends the length of the preﬁx, borrowing host bits, to create 
a subnet part of the address.
■
The last/third major part is the host part of the address, called the interface ID in IPv6, 
and is meant to uniquely identify a host inside a subnet.
For example, Figure 17-5 shows a more detailed view of the Company1 enterprise network 
shown in several of the earlier ﬁgures in this chapter. The design concepts behind how many 
subnets are needed with IPv6 are identical to those for IPv4: A subnet is needed for each 
VLAN and for each serial link, with the same options for subnets with Frame Relay. In this 
case, two LANs and two serial links exist, so Company1 needs four subnets.
The ﬁgure also shows how the enterprise engineer extended the length of the preﬁx as 
assigned by the ISP (/48) to /64, thereby creating a 16-bit subnet part of the address 
structure. The /48 preﬁx is generally called the site preﬁx, and the longer preﬁx used on each 
link is called a subnet preﬁx. To create this extra 16-bit subnet ﬁeld, the engineer uses the 
same concept as with IPv4 when choosing a subnet mask by borrowing bits from the host 
ﬁeld of an IPv4 address. In this case, think of the host ﬁeld as having 80 bits (because the 
preﬁx assigned by the ISP is 48 bits long, leaving 80 bits), and the design in Figure 17-5 
borrows 16 bits for the subnet ﬁeld, leaving a measly 64 bits for the host ﬁeld.

Global Unicast Addressing, Routing, and Subnetting     591
Figure 17-5
Company1 Needs Four Subnets
A bit of math about the design choices can help provide some perspective on the scale of 
IPv6. The 16-bit subnet ﬁeld allows 216, or 65,536, subnets—overkill for all but the very 
largest organizations or companies. (There are also no worries about a zero or broadcast 
subnet in IPv6!) The host ﬁeld is seemingly even more overkill: 264 hosts per subnet, which 
is more than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses per subnet. However, a good reason 
exists for this large host or interface ID part of the address, because it allows one of the 
automatic IPv6 address assignment features to work well, as is covered in the section “IPv6 
Host Address Assignment,” later in this chapter.
Figure 17-6 takes the concept to the ﬁnal conclusion, assigning the speciﬁc four subnets to 
be used inside Company1. Note that the ﬁgure shows the subnet ﬁelds and preﬁx lengths 
(64 in this case) in bold.

Figure 17-6 just shows one option for subnetting the preﬁx assigned to Company1. 
However, any number of subnet bits could be chosen, as long as the host ﬁeld retained 
enough bits to number all hosts in a subnet. For example, a /112 preﬁx length could be used, 
extending the /48 preﬁx by 64 bits (4 hex quartets). Then, for the design in Figure 17-6, you 
could choose the following four subnets:
■
2340:1111:AAAA::0001:0000/112
■
2340:1111:AAAA::0002:0000/112

By using global unicast IPv6 addresses, Internet routing can be very efﬁcient and 
enterprises can have plenty of IP addresses and plenty of subnets, with no requirement for 
NAT functions to conserve the address space.
Prefix Terminology
Before wrapping up this topic, a few new terms need to be introduced. The process of global 
unicast IPv6 address assignment examines many different preﬁxes, with many different 
preﬁx lengths. The text scatters a couple of more speciﬁc terms, but for easier study, 
Table 17-4 summarizes the four key terms, with some reminders of what each means.
1While an RIR can assign a prefix to an ISP, an RIR can also assign a prefix to other Internet registries, which can 
subdivide and assign additional prefixes, until eventually an ISP and then its customers are assigned some unique prefix.
The next sections of this chapter broaden the discussion of IPv6 to include additional types 
of IPv6 addresses, along with the protocols that control and manage several common 
functions for IPv6.
NOTE
The subnet numbers in the ﬁgure could be abbreviated slightly, removing the 
three leading 0s from the last shown quartets.

IPv6 Protocols and Addressing     593
IPv6 Protocols and Addressing
IPv4 hosts need to know several basic facts before they can succeed in simple tasks like 
opening a web browser to view a web page. IPv4 hosts typically need to know the IP 
address of one or more Domain Name System (DNS) servers so that they can use DNS 
protocol messages to ask a DNS server to resolve that name into an IPv4 address. They need 
to know an IP address of a router to use as a default gateway (default router), with the host 
sending packets destined to a host in a different subnet to that default router. The host, of 
course, needs to know its unicast IPv4 IP address and mask—or, as stated with classless 
terminology, its IPv4 address and preﬁx length—from which the host can calculate the 
preﬁx (subnet) on that link.
IPv6 hosts need the same information—DNS IP addresses, default router IP address, and 
their own address/preﬁx length—for the same reasons. IPv6 hosts still use host names, and 
they need to have the host name resolved into an IPv6 address. IPv6 hosts still send packets 
directly to hosts on the same subnet, but they send packets to the default router for off-
subnet destinations.
While IPv6 hosts need to know the same information, IPv6 changes the mechanisms for 
learning some of these facts compared to IPv4. The following sections examine the options 
and protocols through which a host can learn these key pieces of information. At the same 
time, these sections introduce several other types of IPv6 addresses that are used by the new 
IPv6 protocols. The end of these sections summarizes the details and terminology for the 
various types of IPv6 addresses.
DHCP for IPv6
IPv6 hosts can use Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) to learn and lease an IP 
address and corresponding preﬁx length (mask), the IP address of the default router, and the 
DNS IP address(es). The concept works basically like DHCP for IPv4: The host sends a 
(multicast) IPv6 packet searching for the DHCP server. When a server replies, the DHCP 
client sends a message asking for a lease of an IP address, and the server replies, listing an 
IPv6 address, preﬁx length, default router, and DNS IP addresses. The names and formats 
of the actual DHCP messages have changed quite a bit from IPv4 to IPv6, so DHCPv4 and 
DHCPv6 differ in detail, but the basic process remains the same. (DHCPv4 refers to the 
version of DHCP used for IPv4, and DHCPv6 refers to the version of DHCP used for IPv6.)
DHCPv4 servers retain information about each client, like the IP address leased to that 
client and the length of time for which the lease is valid. This type of information is called 
state information, because it tracks the state or status of each client. DHCPv6 servers 
happen to have two operational modes: stateful, in which the server tracks state 
information, and stateless, in which the server does not track state information. Stateful 
DHCPv6 servers ﬁll the same role as the older DHCPv4 servers, while stateless DHCPv6 

594     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
servers ﬁll one role in an IPv6 alternative to stateful DHCP. (Stateless DHCP, and its 
purpose, is covered in the upcoming section “IPv6 Host Address Assignment.”)
One difference between DHCPv4 and stateful DHCPv6 is that IPv4 hosts send IP 
broadcasts to ﬁnd DHCP servers, while IPv6 hosts send IPv6 multicasts. IPv6 multicast 
addresses have a preﬁx of FF00::/8, meaning that the ﬁrst 8 bits of an address are binary 
11111111, or FF in hex. The multicast address FF02::1:2 (longhand 
FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001:0002) has been reserved in IPv6 to be used by 
hosts to send packets to an unknown DHCP server, with the routers working to forward 
these packets to the appropriate DHCP server.
IPv6 Host Address Assignment
When using IPv4 in enterprise networks, engineers typically conﬁgure static IPv4 
addresses on each router interface with the ip address interface subcommand. At the same 
time, most end-user hosts use DHCP to dynamically learn their IP address and mask. For 
Internet access, the router can use DHCP to learn its own public IPv4 address from the ISP.
IPv6 follows the same general model, but with routers using one of two options for static 
IPv6 address assignment, and with end-user hosts using one of two options for dynamic 
IPv6 address assignment. The following sections examine all four options. But ﬁrst, to 
appreciate the conﬁguration options, you need a little more information about the low-order 
64 bits of the IPv6 address format: the interface ID.
The IPv6 Interface ID and EUI-64 Format
Earlier in this chapter, Figure 17-5 shows the format of an IPv6 global unicast address, with 
the second half of the address called the host or interface ID. The value of the interface ID 
portion of a global unicast address can be set to any value, as long as no other host in the 
same subnet attempts to use the same value. (IPv6 includes a dynamic method for hosts to 
ﬁnd out whether a duplicate address exists on the subnet before starting to use the address.) 
However, the size of the interface ID was purposefully chosen to allow easy 
autoconﬁguration of IP addresses by plugging the MAC address of a network card into the 
interface ID ﬁeld in an IPv6 address.
MAC addresses are 6 bytes (48 bits) in length, so for a host to automatically decide on a 
value to use in the 8-byte (64-bit) interface ID ﬁeld, IPv6 cannot simply copy just the MAC 
address. To complete the 64-bit interface ID, IPv6 ﬁlls in 2 more bytes. Interestingly, to do 
so, IPv6 separates the MAC address into two 3-byte halves, and inserts hex FFFE in 
between the halves, to form the interface ID ﬁeld, as well as setting 1 special bit to binary 
1. This format, called the EUI-64 format, is shown in Figure 17-7.

IPv6 Protocols and Addressing     595
Figure 17-7
IPv6 Address Format with Interface ID and EUI-64
Although it might seem a bit convoluted, it works. Also, with a little practice, you can look 
at an IPv6 address and quickly notice the FFFE late in the address, and then easily ﬁnd the 
two halves of the corresponding interface’s MAC address.
To be complete, the ﬁgure points out one other small detail regarding the EUI-64 interface 
ID value. Splitting the MAC address into two halves, and injecting FFFE, is easy. However, 
the EUI-64 format requires setting the seventh bit in the ﬁrst byte of the value to binary 1. 
The underlying reason is that Ethernet MAC addresses are listed with the low-order bits of 
each byte on the left, and the high-order bits on the right. So, the eighth bit in a byte (reading 
from left to right) is the highest-order bit in the address, and the seventh bit (reading from 
left to right) is the second highest-order bit. This second highest-order bit in the ﬁrst byte—
the seventh bit reading from left to right—is called the universal/local (U/L) bit. Set to 
binary 0, it means that the MAC address is a burned-in MAC address. Set to 1, it means that 
the MAC address has been conﬁgured locally. EUI-64 says that the U/L bit should be set to 
1, meaning local.
For example, the following two lines list a host’s MAC address and corresponding EUI-64 
format interface ID, assuming the use of an address conﬁguration option that uses the EUI-
64 format:
■
0034:5678:9ABC
■
0234:56FF:FE78:9ABC
NOTE
To change the seventh bit (reading left-to-right) in the example, convert hex 00 
to binary 00000000, change the seventh bit to 1 (00000010), and then convert back to 
hex, for hex 02 as the ﬁrst two digits.

Static IPv6 Address Configuration
Two options for static IPv6 address conﬁguration are covered in this book, and both are 
available on both routers and hosts: static conﬁguration of the entire address, and static 
conﬁguration of a /64 preﬁx with the host calculating its EUI-64 interface ID to complete 
the IP address. This section shows the concept using routers.
To conﬁgure an IPv6 address on an interface, the router needs an ipv6 address address/
preﬁx-length [eui-64] interface subcommand on each interface. If the eui-64 keyword is not 
included, the address must represent the entire 128-bit address. If the eui-64 keyword is 
included, the address should represent the 64-bit preﬁx, with the router creating the 
interface ID using the EUI-64 format. The preﬁx-length parameter should be the length of 
the subnet preﬁx. For example, Example 17-1 lists the commands on Router R1 from 
Figure 17-6 earlier in this chapter, which is one of Company1’s enterprise routers. It uses 
the site preﬁx length of /64. The example shows both versions of the command (with and 
without the eui-64 keyword.)

IPv6 Protocols and Addressing     597
The end of the example lists the full global unicast IPv6 address as part of the show ipv6 
interface command. When using the EUI-64 option, this command is particularly useful, 
because the conﬁguration command does not list the entire IPv6 address. Note that if the 
EUI format is used, the show ipv6 interface command notes that fact (see interfaces 
Fa0/0 and S0/1/1, versus S0/0/1). Also, routers do not have MAC addresses associated with 
some interfaces, including serial interfaces, so to form the EUI-64–formatted interface ID 
on those interfaces, routers use the MAC address of a LAN interface. In this case, S0/1/1’s 
interface ID is based on Fa0/0’s MAC address.
Stateless Autoconfiguration and Router Advertisements
IPv6 supports two methods of dynamic conﬁguration of IPv6 addresses. One uses a stateful 
DHCPv6 server, which as mentioned earlier, works the same as DHCP in IPv4 in concept, 
although many details in the messages differ between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. IPv6 also 
supplies an alternative called stateless autoconﬁguration (not to be confused with stateless 
DHCP, which is covered in this section). With stateless autoconﬁguration, a host 
dynamically learns the /64 preﬁx used on the subnet, and then calculates the rest of its 
address by using an EUI-64 interface ID based on its network interface card (NIC) MAC 
address.
The stateless autoconﬁguration process uses one of many features of the IPv6 Neighbor 
Discovery Protocol (NDP) to discover the preﬁx used on the LAN. NDP performs many 
functions for IPv6, all related to something that occurs between two hosts in the same 
subnet. For example, one part of NDP replaces the IPv4 ARP protocol. IPv4 ARP allows 
devices on the same subnet—neighbors—to learn each other’s MAC address. Because this 
and many other activities occur only inside the local subnet between neighbors on the same 
link, IPv6 collected these basic functions into one protocol suite, called NDP.
Stateless autoconﬁguration uses two NDP messages, namely router solicitation (RS) and 
router advertisement (RA) messages, to discover the IPv6 preﬁx used on a LAN. The host 
sends the RS message as an IPv6 multicast message, asking all routers to respond to the 
questions “What IPv6 preﬁx(s) is used on this subnet?” and “What is the IPv6 address(s) 
of any default routers on this subnet?” Figure 17-8 shows the general idea, on subnet 1 from 
Figure 17-6, with PC1 sending an RS, and router R1 replying with the IPv6 preﬁx used on 
the LAN and R1’s own IPv6 address as a potential default router.

Example NDP RS/RA Process to Find the Default Routers
IPv6 does not use broadcasts. In fact, there is no such thing as a subnet broadcast address, 
a network-wide broadcast address, or an equivalent of the all-hosts 255.255.255.255 
broadcast IPv4 address. Instead, IPv6 uses multicast addresses. By using a different 
multicast IPv6 address for different functions, a computer that has no need to participate in 
a particular function can simply ignore those particular multicasts, reducing the impact to 
the host. For example, the RS message only needs to be received and processed by routers, 
so the RS message’s destination IP address is FF02::2, which is the address reserved in IPv6 
to be used only by IPv6 routers. RA messages are sent to a multicast address intended for 
use by all IPv6 hosts on the link (FF02::1), so not only will the host that sent the RS learn 
the information, but all other hosts on the link will also learn the details.
Table 17-5 summarizes some of the key details about the RS/RA messages.
IPv6 Address Configuration Summary
This chapter covers four methods for assigning IPv6 addresses to hosts or router interfaces. 
Two variations use static conﬁguration, while two dynamically learn the address. However, 
with both static and dynamic conﬁguration, two alternatives exist—one that supplies the 
entire IPv6 address and one that allows the host to calculate the EUI-64 interface ID. Table 
17-6 summarizes the conﬁguration methods.
NOTE
IPv6 allows multiple preﬁxes and multiple default routers to be listed in the RA 
message; the ﬁgure just shows one of each for simplicity’s sake.

IPv6 Protocols and Addressing     599
Discovering the Default Router with NDP
In IPv4, hosts discover their default router (default gateway) either through static 
conﬁguration on the host or, more typically, with DHCP. IPv6 can use both of these same 
options as well, plus the NDP RS/RA messages as explained in the previous section. The 
NDP router discovery process occurs by default on IPv6 hosts and routers, so while the 
stateful DHCPv6 server can supply the IP address(es) of the possible default routers, it is 
perfectly reasonable in IPv6 to simply not bother to conﬁgure these details in a stateful 
DHCP server, allowing the built-in NDP RS/RA messages to be used instead.
The default router discovery process is relatively simple. Routers automatically send RA 
messages on a periodic basis. These messages list not only the sending router’s IPv6 
address but also all the known routers on that subnet. A host can wait for the next periodic 
RA message or request that all local routers send an RA immediately by soliciting the 
routers using the RS message.
Learning the IP Address(es) of DNS Servers
Like IPv4 hosts, IPv6 hosts typically need to know the IP address of one or more DNS 
servers to resolve names into the corresponding IP address. Oftentimes, the host also needs 
to learn the DNS domain name to use. And like IPv4 hosts, IPv6 hosts can be told these IP 
addresses using (stateful) DHCP. When a host (or router for that matter) learns its IPv6 
address using stateful DHCP, the host can also learn the DNS server IP addresses and the 
domain name, taking care of this particular detail.
Stateless DHCP, which is most useful in conjunction with stateless autoconﬁguration, is an 
alternative method for ﬁnding the DNS server IP addresses and the domain name. A host 
that uses stateless autoconﬁguration can learn its IPv6 address and preﬁx automatically, as 
well as learn its default router IP address, in both cases using NDP RS/RA messages. 
However, the stateless autoconﬁguration process does not help a host learn the DNS IP 
addresses and domain name. So, stateless DHCP supplies that information using the same 
messages as stateful DHCP. However, to supply this information, the server does not need 
to track any state information about each client, so a stateless DHCP server can be used.

IPv6 Addresses
This chapter has already introduced the concepts behind the general format of IPv6 
addresses, the ideas behind global unicast IPv6 addresses, and some details about multicast 
IPv6 addresses. The following sections round out the coverage of addressing, speciﬁcally 
the three categories of IPv6 address:
■
Unicast: IP addresses assigned to a single interface for the purpose of allowing that 
one host to send and receive data.
■
Multicast: IP addresses that represent a dynamic group of hosts for the purpose of 
sending packets to all current members of the group. Some multicast addresses are 
used for special purposes, like with NDP messages, while most support end-user 
applications.
■
Anycast: A design choice by which servers that support the same function can use the 
same unicast IP address, with packets sent by clients being forwarded to the nearest 
server, allowing load balancing across different servers.
Unicast IPv6 Addresses
IPv6 supports three main classes of unicast addresses. One of these classes, global unicast 
IP addresses, closely matches the purpose of IPv4 public IP addresses. Global unicast 
addresses are assigned by ICANN and the RIRs for the purpose of allowing globally unique 
IPv6 addresses for all hosts. These addresses come from inside the 2000::/3 preﬁx, which 
includes all addresses that begin with 2 or 3 (hex).
The next class of IPv6 unicast addresses covered here, unique local unicast addresses, have 
the same function as IPv4 RFC 1918 private addresses. In IPv4, most every enterprise, and 
most every Internet-connected small or home ofﬁce, uses IPv4 private networks. Unique 
local unicast addresses begin with hex FD (FD00::/8), with the format shown in Figure 17-9.

Unique Local Address Format
To use these addresses, an enterprise engineer would choose a 40-bit global ID in a 
pseudorandom manner, with the goal that hopefully the addresses will be unique in the 
universe. In reality, pseudorandom is probably a number made up by the engineer. The 16-
bit subnet ﬁeld and 64-bit interface ID work just like with global unicast addresses, 
numbering different subnets and hosts and allowing EUI-64 assignment of the interface ID. 
As usual, the engineer could avoid using EUI-64, using easier-to-remember values like 
0000:0000:0000:0001 as the interface ID.
Link local addresses are the third class of unicast IPv6 addresses covered here. IPv4 has no 
concepts like the link local IP address. IPv6 uses these addresses when sending packets over 
the local subnet; routers never forward packets destined for link local addresses to other 
subnets.
Link local addresses can be useful for functions that do not need to leave the subnet, in 
particular because a host can automatically derive its own link local IP address without 
sending packets over the subnet. So, before sending the ﬁrst packets, the host can calculate 
its own link local address so that the host has an IPv6 address to use when doing its ﬁrst 
overhead messages. For example, before a host sends an NDP RS (router solicitation) 
message, the host will have already calculated its link local address. The host uses its link 
local address as the source IP address in the RS message.
Link local addresses come from the FE80::/10 range, meaning all addresses that begin with 
FE80, FE90, FEA0, and FEB0. No speciﬁc conﬁguration is required, because a host forms 
these addresses by using the ﬁrst 10 bits of hex FE80 (binary 1111111010), 54 more binary 
0s, and the last 64 bits being the host’s EUI-64 format interface ID. Figure 17-10 shows the 
format.
NOTE
The original IPv6 RFCs deﬁned a private address class called site local, 
meaning local within a site (organization). The original site local address class has been 
deprecated and replaced with unique local unicast addresses.

Link Local Address Format
Routers also use link local addresses on each interface enabled to support IPv6. Like hosts, 
routers automatically calculate their link local IP addresses. In fact, Example 17-1 earlier 
in this chapter listed the (R1) router’s link local IP addresses in the output of the show ipv6 
interface command output. Interestingly, routers normally use link local addresses as the 
next-hop IP address in IPv6 routes, rather than the neighboring router’s global unicast or 
unique local unicast address.
Multicast and Other Special IPv6 Addresses
Multicast addresses can be used to communicate to dynamic groupings of hosts, with the 
sender sending a single packet and with the network replicating that packet as needed so 
that all hosts listening for packets sent to that multicast address receive a copy of the packet. 
IPv6 can limit the scope of where routers forward multicasts based on the value in the ﬁrst 
quartet of the address. This book only examines multicasts that should stay on a local link; 
these addresses all begin with FF02::/16, so they are easily recognized.
For reference, Table 17-8 lists some of the more commonly seen IPv6 multicast addresses. 
Of particular interest are the addresses chosen for use by Routing Information Protocol 
(RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), and Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP), which somewhat 
mirror the multicast addresses each protocol uses for IPv4.
Before completing the discussion of IPv6 addressing, you should know about a couple of 
special IPv6 addresses. First, IPv6 supports the concept of a loopback IP address, as follows:
::1 (127 binary 0s and a 1)

IPv6 Protocols and Addressing     603
Just like the IPv4 127.0.0.1 loopback address, this address can be used to test a host’s 
software. A packet sent by a host to this address goes down the protocol stack, and then 
right back up the stack, with no communication with the underlying network card. This 
allows testing of the software on a host, particularly when testing new applications.
The other special address is the :: address (all binary 0s). This address represents the 
unknown address, which hosts can use when sending packets in an effort to discover their 
IP addresses.
 Summary of IP Protocols and Addressing
This chapter has covered a lot of concepts and details about IPv6 addresses, many of which 
require some work to remember or memorize. This short section pulls several concepts 
from throughout this major section on IPv6 protocols and addresses together before moving 
on to some details about routing protocols and router conﬁguration.
When an IPv6 host ﬁrst boots, it needs to do several tasks before it can send packets through 
a router to another host. When using one of the two methods of dynamically learning an 
IPv6 address that can be used to send packets past the local routers to the rest of a network, 
the ﬁrst few initialization steps are the same, with some differences in the later steps. The 
following list summarizes the steps a host takes when ﬁrst booting, at least for the functions 
covered in this chapter:
Step 1 The host calculates its IPv6 link local address (begins with FE80::/10).
Step 2 The host sends an NDP router solicitation (RS) message, with its link 
local address as the source address and the all-routers FF02::2 multicast 
destination address, to ask routers to supply a list of default routers and 
the preﬁx/length used on the LAN.
Step 3 The router(s) replies with an RA message, sourced from the router’s link 
local address, sent to the all-IPv6-hosts-on-the-link multicast address 
(FF02::1), supplying the default router and preﬁx information.
Step 4 If the type of dynamic address assignment is stateless autoconﬁguration, 
the following occur:
a. The host builds the unicast IP address it can use to send packets 
through the router by using the preﬁx learned in the RA message and 
calculating an EUI-64 interface ID based on the NIC MAC address.
b. The host uses DHCP messages to ask a stateless DHCP server for the 
DNS server IP addresses and domain name.

604     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
Step 4 If the type of dynamic address assignment is stateful DHCP, the host uses 
DHCP messages to ask a stateful DHCP server for a lease of an IP 
address/preﬁx length, as well as default router addresses, the DNS server 
IP addresses, and domain name.
IPv6 includes many different types of addresses, including unicast and multicast. By way 
of summary, Table 17-9 lists the types of IPv6 addresses mentioned by this chapter, with a 
few details, for easier reference when studying.
Configuring IPv6 Routing and Routing Protocols
To support IPv6, all the IPv4 routing protocols had to go through varying degrees of 
changes, with the most obvious being that each had to be changed to support longer 
addresses and preﬁxes. The following sections ﬁrst examine a few details about routing 
protocols and then show how to conﬁgure IPv6 routing and routing protocols on Cisco 
routers.
IPv6 Routing Protocols
As with IPv4, most IPv6 routing protocols are interior gateway protocols (IGP), with 
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) still being the only exterior gateway protocol (EGP) of 
note. All these current IGPs and BGP have been updated to support IPv6. Table 17-10 lists 
the routing protocols and their new RFCs (as appropriate).
NOTE
Other tasks occur when a host initializes as well, but they are beyond the scope 
of this book.

Configuring IPv6 Routing and Routing Protocols     605
Each of these routing protocols has to make several changes to support IPv6. The actual 
messages used to send and receive routing information have changed, using IPv6 headers 
instead of IPv4 headers and using IPv6 addresses in those headers. For example, RIPng 
sends routing updates to the IPv6 destination address FF02::9, instead of the old RIP-2 IPv4 
224.0.0.9 address. Also, the routing protocols typically advertise their link local IP address 
as the next hop in a route, as will be shown in the upcoming Example 17-2.
The routing protocols still retain many of the same internal features. For example, RIPng, 
being based on RIP-2, is still a distance vector protocol, with hop count as the metric and 
15 hops as the longest valid route (16 is inﬁnity). OSPFv3, created speciﬁcally to support 
IPv6, is still a link-state protocol, with cost as the metric but with many of the internals, 
including link-state advertisement (LSA) types, changed. As a result, OSPFv2, as covered 
in Chapter 9, “OSPF,” is not compatible with OSPFv3. However, the core operational 
concepts remain the same.
IPv6 Configuration
Cisco router IOS enables the routing (forwarding) of IPv4 packets by default, with IPv4 
being enabled on an interface when the interface has an IPv4 address conﬁgured. For IPv4 
routing protocols, the routing protocol must be conﬁgured, with the network command 
indirectly enabling the routing protocol on an interface.
IPv6 conﬁguration follows some of these same guidelines, with the largest difference being 
how to enable a routing protocol on an interface. Cisco router IOS does not enable IPv6 
routing by default, so a global command is required to enable IPv6 routing. The unicast IP 
addresses need to be conﬁgured on the interfaces, similar to IPv4. The routing protocol 
needs to be globally conﬁgured, similar to IPv4. Finally, the routing protocol has to be 
conﬁgured on each interface as needed, but with IPv6, the process does not use the network 
router subcommand.
This section shows an example conﬁguration, again showing Router R1 from the 
Company1 enterprise network shown in earlier ﬁgures in this chapter. The example uses

RIPng as the routing protocol. The following list outlines the four main steps to conﬁgure 
IPv6:
Step 1 Enable IPv6 routing with the ipv6 unicast-routing global command.
Step 2 Enable the chosen routing protocol. For example, for RIPng, use the ipv6 
router rip name global conﬁguration command.
Step 3 Conﬁgure an IPv6 unicast address on each interface using the ipv6 
address address/preﬁx-length [eui-64] interface command.
Step 4 Enable the routing protocol on the interface, for example, with the ipv6 
rip name enable interface subcommand (where the name matches the 
ipv6 router rip name global conﬁguration command).
Example 17-2 shows the conﬁguration, plus a few show commands. Note that the IP 
address conﬁguration matches the earlier Example 17-1. Because Example 17-1 showed 
the address conﬁguration, this example shows gray highlights on the new conﬁguration 
commands only.

Configuring IPv6 Routing and Routing Protocols     607
The conﬁguration itself does not require a lot of work beyond the IPv6 address 
conﬁguration shown previously in Example 17-1. The ipv6 router rip name command 
requires a name (formally called a tag) that is just a text name for the routing process. 
Example 17-2 shows the conﬁguration, using a RIP tag named “atag”. This tag does not 
have to match between the various routers. Otherwise, the conﬁguration itself is 
straightforward.

Conﬁguring IPv6 Routing and Routing Protocols on R1 (Continued)

in that command, and the new routing code “L”. For each interface with a unicast address, 
the router adds the usual connected route for the preﬁx connected to that interface. For 
example, the ﬁrst highlighted line inside this command lists 2340:1111:AAAA:1::/64, 
which is the subnet connected to R1’s Fa0/0 interface. The output also lists a host route—
a /128 preﬁx length route—as a local route. Each of these local routes, as noted with the 
code “L,” lists the speciﬁc address on each interface, respectively.
The next highlighted lines in that same show ipv6 route command list some interesting 
next-hop information in a RIP-learned route. The example highlights the route to subnet 3, 
listing outgoing interface S0/0/1, but the next-hop address is R2’s link local IP address of 
FE80::213:19FF:FE7B:5026. IPv6 routing protocols typically advertise the link local 
addresses as next-hop addresses.
Finally, the last part of the example shows the output of the show ipv6 interface brief 
command, which lists the unicast IP addresses on each interface. The highlighted lines ﬁrst 
show the link local address (each starts with FE8), and then the global unicast address, on 
R1’s Fa0/0 interface. Each of the three interfaces used in this example has both the link 
local address, which is automatically generated, and the global unicast addresses 
conﬁgured, as shown in the ﬁrst part of Example 17-2.
Conﬁguring host names and DNS servers on routers for IPv4 can be a small convenience, 
but for IPv6, it might well be a necessity. Because of the length of IPv6 addresses, even a 
simple ping command requires a fair amount of typing and referring to other command 
output or documentation. So, just as with IPv4, you might want to conﬁgure static host 
names on routers, or refer to a DNS server, with the following two commands. Note that 
the commands and syntax are the same as the commands for IPv4, just with IPv6 addresses 
used as parameters.
■
ip host name ipv6-address [second-address [third-address [fourth-address]]]
■
ip name-server server-address1 [server-address2...server-address6]
The ﬁrst command conﬁgures a host name only known to the local routers, while the second 
refers to a DNS server. Note that the router attempts to act as a DNS client by default, based 
on the default ip domain-lookup global conﬁguration command. However, if the no ip 
domain-lookup command has been conﬁgured, change the command back to ip domain-
lookup to begin using DNS services.
While the conﬁguration and show commands in Example 17-2 can be useful for learning 
the basics, much more is required before an internetwork can be ready for an IPv6 
deployment. (Deploying IPv6 Networks, by Ciprian Popoviciu et al., published by Cisco 
Press, is a great resource if you want to read more.) The next section takes a brief look at 

IPv6 Transition Options     609
one of the larger deployment issues, namely, how to support users during a worldwide 
migration from IPv4 to IPv6, which might take decades.
IPv6 Transition Options
While IPv6 solves a lot of problems, an overnight migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is ridiculous. 
The number of devices on Earth that use IPv4 number is well into the billions, and in some 
cases, even if you wanted to migrate to IPv6, the devices or their software might not even 
have IPv6 support, or at least well-tested IPv6 support. The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 
will at least take years, if not decades.
Thankfully, much time and effort have been spent thinking about the migration process and 
developing standards for how to approach the migration or transition issue. The following 
sections introduce the main options and explain the basics. In particular, these sections 
examine the idea of using dual stacks, tunneling, and translation between the two versions 
of IP. Note that no one solution is typically enough to solve all problems; in all likelihood, 
a combination of these tools will need to be used in most every network.
IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stacks
The term dual stacks means that the host or router uses both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. 
For hosts, this means that the host has both an IPv4 and IPv6 address associated with each 
NIC, that the host can send IPv4 packets to other IPv4 hosts, and that the host can send IPv6 
packets to other IPv6 hosts. For routers, it means that in addition to the usual IPv4 IP 
addresses and routing protocols covered in many of the other chapters of this book, the 
routers would also have IPv6 addresses and routing protocols conﬁgured, as shown in this 
chapter. To support both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, the router could then receive and forward 
both IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets.
The dual stack approach can be a reasonable plan of attack to migrate an enterprise to IPv6 
for communications inside the enterprise. The routers could be easily migrated to use dual 
stacks, and most desktop operating systems (OS) support IPv6 today. In some cases, the 
upgrade my require new software or hardware, but this approach allows a slower migration, 
which is not necessarily a bad thing, because the support staff needs time to learn how IPv6 
works.
Tunneling
Another tool to support the IPv4-to-IPv6 transition is tunneling. Many types of tunneling 
exist, but in this case, the tunnel function typically takes an IPv6 packet sent by a host and 
encapsulates it inside an IPv4 packet. The IPv4 packet can then be forwarded over an 
existing IPv4 internetwork, with another device removing the IPv4 header, revealing the 

610     Chapter 17: IP Version 6
original IPv6 packet. The concept is very much like a VPN tunnel, as explained in Chapter 
15, “Virtual Private Networks.”
Figure 17-11 shows a typical example with a type of tunnel generically called an IPv6-to-
IPv4 tunnel, meaning IPv6 inside IPv4. The ﬁgure shows a sample enterprise internetwork 
in which hosts on some of the LANs have migrated to IPv6, but the core of the network still 
runs IPv4. This might be the case during an initial testing phase inside an enterprise, or it 
could be commonly done with an IPv4-based ISP that has customers wanting to migrate to 
IPv6.
Figure 17-11
Example IPv6-to-IPv4 Tunnel, Physical and Logical View
In the ﬁgure, the IPv6-based PC1 sends an IPv6 packet. Router R1 then encapsulates or 
tunnels the IPv6 packet into a new IPv4 header, with a destination IPv4 address of an 
address on Router R4. Routers R2 and R3 happily forward the packet, because it has a 
normal IPv4 header, while R4 de-encapsulates the original IPv6 packet, forwarding it to 
IPv6-based PC2. It’s called a tunnel in part because the IPv6 packets inside the tunnel can’t 
be seen while traversing the tunnel; the routers in the middle of the network, R2 and R3 in 
this case, perceive the packets as IPv4 packets.
Several types of IPv6-to-IPv4 tunnels exist. To perform the tunneling shown by the routers 
in Figure 17-11, the ﬁrst three of the following types of tunnels could be used, with the 
fourth type (Teredo tunnels) being used by hosts:
IPv6 Only

IPv6 Transition Options     611
■
Manually conﬁgured tunnels (MCT): A simple conﬁguration in which tunnel 
interfaces, a type of virtual router interface, are created, with the conﬁguration 
referencing the IPv4 addresses used in the IPv4 header that encapsulates the IPv6 
packet.
■
Dynamic 6to4 tunnels: This term refers to a speciﬁc type of dynamically created 
tunnel, typically done on the IPv4 Internet, in which the IPv4 addresses of the tunnel 
endpoints can be dynamically found based on the destination IPv6 address.
■
Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP): Another dynamic 
tunneling method, typically used inside an enterprise. Unlike 6to4 tunnels, ISATAP 
tunnels do not work if IPv4 NAT is used between the tunnel endpoints.
■
Teredo tunneling: This method allows dual-stack hosts to create a tunnel to another 
host, with the host itself both creating the IPv6 packet and encapsulating the packet 
inside an IPv4 header.
Figure 17-12 shows the basic idea behind the Teredo tunnel.
Figure 17-12
Example Encapsulation for a Teredo Host-Host Tunnel
Translating Between IPv4 and IPv6 with NAT-PT
Both classes of IPv6 transition features mentioned so far in this chapter, dual stack and 
tunnels, rely on the end hosts to at least support IPv6, if not both IPv4 and IPv6. However, 
in some cases, an IPv4-only host needs to communicate with an IPv6-only host. A third 
class of transition features needs to be used in this case: a tool that translates the headers of 
an IPv6 packet to look like an IPv4 packet, and vice versa.
In Cisco routers, Network Address Translation–Protocol Translation (NAT-PT), deﬁned in 
RFC 2766, can be used to perform the translation. To do its work, a router conﬁgured with 
NAT-PT must know what IPv6 address to translate to which IPv4 address and vice versa, 
the same kind of information held in the traditional NAT translation table. And like 
traditional NAT, NAT-PT allows static deﬁnition, dynamic NAT, and dynamic PAT, which 
can be used to conserve IPv4 addresses.

Final Preparation
Chapter 18
Final Preparation


C H A P T E R 18
Final Preparation
The ﬁrst 17 chapters of this book cover the technologies, protocols, commands, and 
features you need to understand to pass the ICND2 exam. Although these chapters supply 
the detailed information, most people need more preparation than simply reading the ﬁrst 
17 chapters. This chapter details a set of tools and a study plan to help you complete your 
preparation for the exams. 
If you’re preparing for the CCNA exam by reading both this book and the CCENT/CCNA 
ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, you know that both books have a ﬁnal 
preparation chapter. However, you can refer to just this chapter to read about the suggested 
study plan, because this chapter refers to the tools in both this book and the ICND1 book. 
Just look for the text highlighted in gray, like this sentence, for suggestions that apply to 
CCNA (640-802) exam preparation, but not to ICND2 (640-816) exam preparation.
This short chapter has two main sections. The ﬁrst section lists the exam preparation tools 
that can be useful at this point in your study process. The second section lists a suggested 
study plan now that you have completed all the earlier chapters.
Tools for Final Preparation
This section lists some information about the available tools and how to access them.
Exam Engine and Questions on the CD
The CD includes an exam engine—software that displays and then grades a set of exam-
realistic questions. These include simulation (sim) questions, drag-and-drop, and many 
scenario-based questions that require the same level of analysis as the questions on the 
ICND2 and CCNA exams. Using the exam engine, you can either practice using the 
questions in Study Mode or take a simulated (timed) ICND2 or CCNA exam.
NOTE
This chapter references many of the book’s chapters and appendixes, as well as 
tools available on the CD. Some of the appendixes, beginning with Appendix D, are 
included only on the CD that comes with this book. To access those, just insert the CD 
and make the appropriate selection from the opening interface.

620     Chapter 18: Final Preparation
The installation process has two major steps. The CD includes a recent copy of the exam 
engine software, supplied by Boson Software (http://www.boson.com). The practice 
exam—the database of ICND2 exam questions—is not on the CD. Instead, the practice 
exam resides on the http://www.boson.com web server, so the second major step is to 
activate and download the practice exam.
Install the Software from the CD
The software installation process is pretty routine compared with other software installation 
processes. The following steps outline the process:
Step 1 Insert the CD into your PC.
Step 2 The software that automatically runs is the Cisco Press software to access 
and use all CD-based features, including the exam engine, viewing a PDF 
of this book, and viewing the CD-only appendices. From the main menu, 
click the option to Install the Exam Engine.
Step 3 Respond to prompt windows, as you would with any typical software 
installation process.
The installation process might give you the option to register the software. This process 
requires that you establish a login at the http://www.boson.com website. You will need this 
login to activate the exam, so feel free to register when prompted. If you already have a 
login at the http://www.boson.com site, you don’t need to register again. Just use your 
existing login.
Activate and Download the Practice Exam
After the exam engine is installed, you should activate the exam associated with this book:
Step 1 Start the Boson Exam Environment (BEE) software from the Start menu. It should 
be installed in a Cisco Press folder on your computer.
Step 2 The ﬁrst time you start the software, it should ask you to either log in, or 
register an account. If you do not already have an account with Boson, 
select the option to register a new account. (You must register to 
download and use the exam.)
NOTE
The cardboard CD case in the back of this book includes the CD and a piece of 
paper. The paper lists the activation key for the practice exam associated with this book. 
DO NOT LOSE THE ACTIVATION KEY.

Tools for Final Preparation     621
Step 3 After you are registered, the software might prompt you to download the 
latest version of the software, which you should do. Note that this process 
updates the exam engine software (formally called the Boson Exam 
Environment). It does not activate the practice exam. 
Step 4 To activate and download the exam associated with this book, from the 
exam engine main window, click the Exam Wizard button.
Step 5 From the Exam Wizard pop-up window, select Activate a purchased 
exam and click the Next button. (Although you did not purchase the 
exam directly, you purchased it indirectly when you purchased this 
book.)
Step 6 On the next screen, enter the Activation Key from the paper inside the 
cardboard CD holder in the back of the book, and click the Next button.
Step 7 The activation process downloads the practice exam. When this is done, 
the main exam engine menu should list a new exam, with a name such as 
“ExSim for Cisco Press ICND2 ECG.” If you do not see the exam, be 
sure you have selected the My Exams tab on the menu. You may need to 
click the plus sign icon (+) to expand the menu to see the exam. 
At this point, the software and practice exam are ready to use.
Activating Other Exams
You need to go through the exam software installation process and the registration process 
only once. After that, for each new exam, only a few steps are required. For example, if you 
bought both this book and the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam Certiﬁcation Guide, 
you could follow the steps listed here to install the software and activate the exam 
associated with this book. Then, for the practice exam associated with the ICND1 book, 
which has about 150 exam-realistic ICND1 questions, you need to follow only a few more 
steps. All you have to do is start the exam engine (if it is not still up and running) and follow 
Steps 4 through 6 from the preceding list. In fact, if you purchase other Cisco Press books, 
or purchase a practice exam from Boson, you just need to activate each new exam as 
described in Steps 4 through 6.
You can also purchase additional practice exams from Boson directly from its website. 
When you purchase an exam, you receive an activation key, and then you can activate and 
download the exam—again without requiring any additional software installation.
The Cisco CCNA Prep Center
Cisco provides a wide variety of CCNA preparation tools at a Cisco Systems website called 
the CCNA Prep Center. The CCNA Prep Center includes demonstrations of the exam’s user 
interface, sample questions, informational videos, discussion forums, and other tools. 

622     Chapter 18: Final Preparation
To use the CCNA Prep Center, you need a registered login at http://www.cisco.com. To 
register, simply go to http://www.cisco.com, click Register at the top of the page, and 
supply some information. (You do not need to work for Cisco or one of its partners to get a 
login.)
After you have registered, proceed to http://www.cisco.com/go/prepcenter, and look for the 
link to the CCNA Prep Center. There, you can log in and explore the many features.
Subnetting Videos, Reference Pages, and Practice Problems
Being able to analyze the IP addressing and subnetting used in any IPv4 network may be 
the single most important skill for all the CCNA exams. The CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial 
Exam Certiﬁcation Guide’s Chapter 12, “IP Addressing and Subnetting,” covers most of 
those details, with this book’s Chapter 5, “VLSM and Route Summarization,” adding to the 
puzzle by explaining VLSM. (In case you do not have the ICND1 book, ICND1’s Chapter 
12 is included with this book as CD-only Appendix H, “ICND1 Chapter 12: IP Addressing 
and Subnetting.”) 
This book includes several tools to help you practice and reﬁne your subnetting skills:
■
Subnetting Reference Pages: CD-only Appendix E, “Subnetting Reference Pages,” 
summarizes the binary and decimal shortcut processes explained in both ICND1’s 
Chapter 12 and this book’s Chapter 5. Each reference page lists a single process related 
to subnetting, along with reference information useful for that process. These 
summarized processes may be a more convenient tool when you’re practicing 
subnetting, as compared to ﬂipping pages in the subnetting chapters, looking for the 
correct process.
■
Subnetting Videos: The DVD included with this book has a series of subnetting 
videos. These videos show you how to use the shortcut processes to ﬁnd the answers 
to popular subnetting questions. You can select and play the videos from a simple menu 
that starts when you insert the DVD into a DVD drive.
■
Subnetting Practice: CD-only Appendix D, “Subnetting Practice,” contains a variety 
of subnetting practice problems, including 25 problems for which you need to ﬁnd the 
subnet number, subnet broadcast address, and range of valid IP addresses. This 
appendix shows you how to use both binary and shortcut processes to ﬁnd the answers. 
Scenarios
As mentioned in the introduction to this book, some of the exam questions require you to 
use the same skills commonly used to troubleshoot problems in real networks. The 

Study Plan     623
troubleshooting sections and chapters of both the ICND1 and ICND2 books help prepare 
you for those kinds of questions. 
Another way to prepare for troubleshooting questions on the exams is to think through 
many different network scenarios, predicting what should occur, and investigating whether 
the network is performing as it should. Appendix F, “Additional Scenarios,” in both this 
book and the ICND1 book, includes several scenarios that include some tasks you should 
attempt before reading the suggested solution listed later in the appendix. By reading these 
scenarios and doing the exercises, you can practice some of the skills required when 
analyzing and troubleshooting networks. 
Study Plan
You could simply study using all the available tools, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. 
However, this section suggests a particular study plan, with a sequence of tasks that may 
work better than just using the tools randomly. However, feel free to use the tools in any 
way and at any time that helps you fully prepare for the exam. 
If you are only preparing for the ICND2 exam, you can ignore the gray highlighted portions 
of this study plan. If you are studying for the CCNA exam by using the ICND1 book as 
well, include the tasks highlighted in gray. 
The suggested study plan separates the tasks into four categories:
■
Recall the Facts: Activities that help you remember all the details from the ﬁrst 17 
chapters of this book.
■
Practice Subnetting: You must master subnetting to succeed on the ICND1, ICND2, 
and CCNA exams. This category lists the items you can use to practice subnetting 
skills.
■
Build Troubleshooting Skills Using Scenarios: To answer some exam questions that 
present a scenario, you may need to recall facts, do subnetting math quickly and 
accurately, and use a hands-on simulator—all to answer a single question. This plan 
section suggests activities that help you pull together these different skills.
■
Use the Exam Engine to Practice Realistic Questions: You can use the exam engine 
on the CD to study using a bank of unique exam-realistic questions available only with 
this book.

624     Chapter 18: Final Preparation
Recall the Facts
As with most exams, you must recall many facts, concepts, and deﬁnitions to do well on 
the test. This section suggests a couple of tasks that should help you remember all the 
details:
Step 1 Review and repeat, as needed, the activities in the “Exam Preparation Tasks” 
section at the end of each chapter. Most of these activities help you reﬁne your 
knowledge of a topic while also helping you memorize the facts. For CCNA exam 
preparation, do this for Chapters 2 through 17 in the ICND1 book, as well as 
Chapters 1 through 17 in this book. 
Step 2 Review all the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz questions at the 
beginning of the chapters. Although the questions might be familiar, 
reading through them again will help improve your recall of the topics 
covered in the questions. Also, the DIKTA questions tend to cover the 
most important topics from the chapter, and it never hurts to drill on those 
topics. 
Practice Subnetting 
Without question, absolutely the most important skill you need to succeed in passing the 
ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA exams is to be able to accurately, conﬁdently, and quickly 
answer subnetting questions. The CCNA exams all have some element of time pressure; the 
most stressful questions are the sim, simlet, and subnetting questions. So, you should 
practice subnetting math and processes until you can consistently ﬁnd the correct answer 
in a reasonable amount of time.
Before I suggest how you should prepare for subnetting questions, please note that there are 
many alternative methods for ﬁnding the answers to subnetting questions. For example, you 
can use binary math for all 32 bits of the addresses and subnet numbers. Alternatively, you 
could recognize that 3 of the 4 octets in most subnetting problems are easily predicted 
without binary math, and then use binary math in the ﬁnal interesting octet. Another option 
would be to use decimal shortcuts. (This topic is covered in ICND1’s Chapter 12 and this 
book’s Appendix H.) Shortcuts require no binary math, but they do require you to practice 
a process until you’ve memorized it. You can even use variations on these processes as 
taught in other books or classes.
Whichever process you prefer, you should practice it until you can use it accurately, 
conﬁdently, and quickly. 

Study Plan     625
The following list of suggested activities includes practice activities that you can use 
regardless of the process you choose. In some cases, this list includes items that help you 
learn the shortcuts included with this book:
Step 1 View or Print Appendix E, “Subnetting Reference Pages.” This short CD-only 
appendix includes a series of single-page summaries of the subnetting processes 
found in ICND1’s Chapter 12 (and this book’s Appendix H, which is a copy of 
ICND1’s Chapter 12.) Appendix E includes reference pages that summarize both 
the binary and decimal shortcut subnetting processes. 
Step 2 Watch the subnetting videos found on the CCNA video DVD found 
in the back of this book. These videos show examples of how to use 
some of the more detailed shortcut processes to help ensure that you 
know how to use the processes. CCNA exam candidates: The subnetting 
videos are on DVDs included with both books. They are identical, so you 
can watch the videos from either DVD.
Step 3 View or print Appendix D, “Subnetting Practice.” This CD-only 
appendix includes enough subnetting practice problems so that, through 
repetition, you can signiﬁcantly improve your speed and internalize the 
shortcut processes. Plan on working on these problems until you can 
consistently get the right answer, quickly, and you no longer have to sit 
back and think about the process for ﬁnding the answer. The goal is to 
make the process for ﬁnding the answers to such problems automatic. 
CCNA exam candidates: the ICND2 Appendix D contains all the 
problems from ICND1’s Appendix D, plus a few others, so use ICND2’s 
Appendix D.
Step 4 Practice Subnetting with Cisco’s Subnetting Game. Cisco has a 
subnetting game, available at the Cisco CCNA Prep Center. It prompts 
you with various subnetting scenarios, and makes practicing subnetting 
fun. Just go to the CCNA Prep Center (http://www.cisco.com/go/
prepcenter), log in with your Cisco.com User ID, select the Additional 
Information tab, and look for the link to download the game. (If you do 
not have a login, you can establish one from this web page.)
Step 5 Develop your own practice problems using a subnet calculator. You 
can download many free subnet calculators from the Internet, including 
one available from Cisco as part of the CCNA Prep Center. You can make 
up your own subnetting problems like those in Appendix D, do the 
problems, and then test your answers by using the subnet calculator.

626     Chapter 18: Final Preparation
Build Troubleshooting Skills Using Scenarios
Just as a real problem in a real network may be caused by a variety of issues—a routing 
protocol, a bad cable, Spanning Tree, an incorrect ACL, or even errors in your 
documentation about the internetwork—the exam makes you apply a wide range of 
knowledge to answer individual questions. The one activity for this section is as follows: 
■
Review the scenarios included in Appendix F of this book. These scenarios make 
you think about issues covered in multiple chapters of the book. They also require more 
abstract thought to solve the problem. CCNA exam candidates should review the 
scenarios in Appendix F of both books.
Use the Exam Engine
The exam engine includes two basic modes:
■
Study mode is most useful when you want to use the questions to learn and practice. 
In study mode, you can select options such as whether you want to randomize the order 
of the questions, randomize the order of the answers, automatically see the answers, 
refer to speciﬁc sections of the text that reside on the CD, and many other options.
■
Simulation mode presents questions in a timed environment, providing you with a 
more exam realistic experience. However, it restricts your ability to see your score as 
you progress through the exam, view the answers as you are taking the exam, and refer 
to sections of the text. These timed exams not only allow you to study for the actual 
ICND2 and CCNA exams, they also help you simulate the time pressure of the actual 
exam.
Choosing Study or Simulation Mode
Both study mode and simulation mode are useful for preparing for the exams. It’s easy to 
choose one of the modes from the exam engine’s user interface. The following steps show 
you how to move to the screen where you select study or simulation mode:
Step 1 Click the Choose Exam button. The exam should be listed under the title ExSim 
for Cisco Press ICND2 ECG.
Step 2 Click the exam’s name once, to highlight it. 
Step 3 Click the Load Exam button.
The engine should display a window. Here you can choose Simulation Mode or Study 
Mode using the radio buttons on the right side of the window.

Study Plan     627
Choosing the Right Exam Option
The exam engine has many options. You need to choose from one of the three listed exams 
on the left side of the window, and select either simulation or study mode. Additionally, 
depending on these two choices, you can potentially modify many other small settings. 
Although this is a useful tool, it can be difﬁcult to ﬁgure out which options to choose to 
perform the following four primary tasks:
■
Study for the ICND2 exam
■
Study for the CCNA exam
■
Simulate the ICND2 exam
■
Simulate the CCNA exam
To support the ability to study for and simulate both the ICND2 and CCNA exams, the 
practice test includes two separate hidden question banks. The ﬁrst bank includes about 150 
unique questions written speciﬁcally for the ICND2 exam. The second bank includes a 
subset of the ICND1 question bank written for the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 Ofﬁcial Exam 
Certiﬁcation Guide. 
When studying for or simulating the CCNA exam, you must choose an option that includes 
both the ICND2 and ICND1 questions. To study for or simulate the ICND2 exam, you must 
choose an exam option that includes only ICND2 questions. The following list outlines the 
three options from the menu, and the questions served by the exam engine for each choice:
■
Cisco ICND2 Exam: ICND2 questions only
■
Custom Exam: ICND2 questions only
■
Full CCNA Exam: Both ICND1 and ICND2 questions 
You might want to experiment with some of the options. After you have chosen to either 
study using these questions or simulate an exam, Table 18-1 lists the four main options, 
along with how to pick the right options from the user interface.

628     Chapter 18: Final Preparation
In addition to these main four study options, the custom exam option has a particularly 
useful feature for exam study. With this option, by clicking the Modify Settings button, you 
can select the questions to study by chapter. So, if you want to use the question bank for 
study, and you are studying by chapter or groups of chapters, you can select the questions 
associated with those chapters.
Summary
The tools and suggestions listed in this chapter were designed with one goal in mind: to help 
you develop the skills required to pass the ICND2 and CCNA exams. This book, and its 
companion ICND1 book, were developed not just to tell you the facts, but to help you learn 
how to apply the facts. No matter what your experience level when you take the exams, it 
is our hope that the broad range of preparation tools, and even the structure of the books 
and the focus on troubleshooting, will help you pass the exams with ease. I wish you well 
on the exams.

D. While a subnet and a VLAN are not equivalent concepts, the devices in one VLAN 
are typically in the same subnet, and vice versa.
3.
B
4.
C
5.
B and C
6.
A and C. The auto setting means that the switch can negotiate trunking, but it can only 
respond to negotiation messages, and it cannot initiate the negotiation process. So, the 
other switch must be conﬁgured to trunk or to initiate the negotiation process (based 
on being conﬁgured with the dynamic desirable option.)
7.
A. The default VTP setting of VTP server mode means that the switch can conﬁgure 
VLANs, so the VLAN is conﬁgured. However, being in server mode, the conﬁguration 
commands only show up in the show vlan brief command output, and are not listed as 
part of the running-conﬁg ﬁle.
8.
B and C
9.
C. VTP does not require a password, although if a password is used, the password must 
match. VTP sends VTP updates immediately after a VLAN database change. However, 
VTP only sends VTP messages over trunks, and 2960s default to using a trunking 
administrative mode of auto, which does not initiate the trunking negotiation process. 
So, none of the switches automatically form a trunk, and no VTP messages are sent.
10. C and D. The domain name and password must be equal, and the switches must 
connect using a trunk before VTP will work. It is normal to have some switches as 
servers and some as clients. A mismatched pruning conﬁguration setting does not 
prevent the synchronization of VLAN databases.

A and B. Listening and Learning are transitory port states, used only when moving 
from the Blocking to the Forwarding State. Discarding is not an 802.1d STP port state.
2.
C and D. Listening and Learning are transitory port states, used only when moving 
from the Blocking to the Forwarding state. Discarding is not an 802.1d STP port state. 
Forwarding and Blocking are stable states.
3.
C. The smallest numeric bridge ID wins the election.
4.
B. Nonroot switches forward Hellos received from the root; the root sends these Hellos 
based on the root’s conﬁgured Hello timer.
5.
E
6.
B and D. The IEEE 802.1w standard, called Rapid STP, provides much faster STP 
convergence.
7.
B and D. RSTP uses port states of Forwarding, Learning, and Discarding, with 
Forwarding and Learning States performing the same basic functions as the STP port 
states with the same name.
8.
B and C
9.
B. Cisco switches use the extended system ID format for bridge IDs by default, in 
which the priority ﬁeld is broken down into a base priority value (32,768 in this case) 
plus the VLAN ID. The priority of this switch allows it to be capable of being the root 
switch, but the command output does not supply enough information to know whether 
this switch is currently root.
10. B. The two interfaces default to a port cost of 19 (Fa0/13) and 4 (Gi0/1), making SW3’s 
cost to reach the root 10 + 19 = 29 out Fa0/13, and 20 + 4 = 24 over Gi0/1. SW3 
therefore chooses Gi0/1 as its root port. SW3 could then advertise a cost of 24 (cost to 
reach the root) Hello out Fa0/13, but it would be inferior to the Hello already being 
received on Fa0/13 (cost 10), so SW3 would not choose Fa0/13 as a designated port.
Chapter 4
1.
D. The host might need to use Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) to 
acquire an IP address, and it would likely use Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve 
www.ciscopress.com into an IP address. It would also use Address Resolution Protocol 
(ARP) to ﬁnd the default gateway’s MAC address, because the ARP cache would have 
been cleared as part of the boot process.

Chapter 5     635
2.
B. The ping 2.1.1.2 command does not use a host name, so no DNS server is required. 
A DHCP client does not need to know the DHCP server’s IP address to use DHCP. 
There’s no such thing as an ARP server. However, to send the packet to another subnet, 
the PC needs to know the IP address of its default gateway.
3.
A and F
4.
C. With the no ip subnet-zero command conﬁgured, the router will not allow any 
interfaces to be conﬁgured with an IP address in the zero subnet. Of the listed answers, 
subnet 10.0.0.0 255.254.0.0 is a zero subnet, with a range of addresses from 10.0.01 to 
10.1.255.254. The ip address 10.1.2.2 255.254.0.0 command would be rejected.
5.
C. The “S” code means that the route is a static route, which is deﬁned with the ip route 
global conﬁguration command.
6.
A. The correct syntax lists a subnet number, then a subnet mask in dotted decimal form, 
and then either an outgoing interface or a next-hop IP address.
7.
A
8.
B. With classless routing enabled, the router uses the default route if no other routes 
are matched. The line beginning “Gateway of last resort . . .” lists the IP address of the 
next-hop router, 168.13.1.101, which will be used as the default route.
Chapter 5
1.
B, C, and D
2.
A. Note that sometimes VLSM stands for variable-length subnet masking, which refers 
to the process of using different masks in the same classful network, whereas variable-
length subnet mask refers to the subnet masks themselves.
3.
C and D. Subnet 10.5.0.0 255.255.240.0 implies range 10.5.0.0–10.5.15.255, which 
does not overlap. 10.4.0.0 255.254.0.0 implies range 10.4.0.0–10.5.255.255, which 
does overlap. 10.5.32.0 255.255.224.0 implies range 10.5.32.0–10.5.63.255, which 
does overlap. 10.5.0.0 255.255.128.0 implies range 10.5.0.0– 10.5.127.255, which 
does overlap.
4.
C. All the listed answers include the range of all three subnets, except for 10.3.64.0 
255.255.224.0, which implies an address range of 10.3.64.0–10.3.95.255. Of the other 
three answers, 10.3.64.0 255.255.192.0 is the smallest range (10.3.64.0–
10.3.127.255). It also happens to be the smallest single summary route that includes all 
three subnets listed in the question.

636     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes
5.
C and D. 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 implies a range of all addresses that begin with 10, and 
10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 implies a range of all addresses that begin with 10.1, so both these 
answers include all the address ranges listed in the question. 10.1.32.0 255.255.224.0 
implies a range of 10.1.32.0–10.1.63.255, which includes all addresses listed in the 
question. 10.1.55.0 255.255.255.0 implies a range of only 10.1.55.0–10.1.55.255, 
which does not include all addresses. 10.1.48.0 255.255.248.0 implies a range of 
10.1.48.0–10.1.55.255, which omits two of the subnets listed in the question.

A, B, and C
8.
A. Discontiguous networks are allowed as long as autosummarization is disabled. 
OSPF does not even support autosummarization, so using OSPF would solve the 
problem. RIP-1 cannot disable autosummarization. EIGRP can disable 
autosummarization, but it is on by default.
Chapter 6
1.
A and C. Standard ACLs check the source IP address. The address range 10.1.1.1–
10.1.1.4 can be matched by an ACL, but it requires multiple access-list commands. 
Matching all hosts in Barney’s subnet can be accomplished with the access-list 1 
permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 command.
2.
D. 0.0.0.255 matches all packets that have the same ﬁrst 3 octets. This is useful when 
you want to match a subnet in which the subnet part comprises the ﬁrst 3 octets, as in 
this case.
3.
E. 0.0.15.255 matches all packets with the same ﬁrst 20 bits. This is useful when you 
want to match a subnet in which the subnet part comprises the ﬁrst 20 bits, as in this 
case.
4.
E and F. Extended ACLs can look at the Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) headers, 
and a few others, but not any application layer information. Named extended ACLs can 
look for the same ﬁelds as a numbered extended ACL.
5.
A and E. The correct range of ACL numbers for extended IP access lists is 100 to 199 
and 2000 to 2699. The answers that list the eq www parameter after 10.1.1.1 match the 
source port number, and the packets are going toward the web server, not away from it.
6.
E. Because the packet is going toward any web client, you need to check for the web 
server’s port number as a source port. The client IP address range is not speciﬁed in the 
question, but the servers are, so the source address beginning with 172.16.5 is the 
correct answer.

Chapter 8     637
7.
E. Named extended IP ACLs can match the exact same set of ﬁelds as can numbered 
extended IP ACLs.
8.
A and C. Before IOS 12.3, numbered ACLs must be removed and then reconﬁgured to 
remove a line from the ACL. As of IOS 12.3, you can also use ACL conﬁguration mode 
and sequence numbers to delete one ACL line at a time.
9.
C. The authorized Cisco curriculum makes the suggestion in answer C for extended IP 
ACLs, suggesting that standard ACLs be placed as close to the destination as possible.
10. C. Dynamic ACLs require the user to telnet to the router and authenticate using a 
username and password, which then causes the router to permit packets sent by the 
host.

B, C, D, and E
5.
B. Distance vector protocols rely on periodic full routing updates from their neighbors 
to conﬁrm that the neighbor is still working.
6.
D. Split horizon causes a router to not advertise routes out an interface if the route 
would cause packets to be sent out that same interface.
7.
D. Route poisoning means advertising the failed route with an “inﬁnite” metric, as 
opposed to simply ceasing to advertise the route. Poison reverse is route poisoning by 
advertising a route that previously was not advertised because of split horizon.
8.
A. The router should not immediately send a full update. Instead, distance vector 
protocols immediately send a partial routing update, listing just the poisoned route.
9.
B. Link-state protocols reﬂood each LSA on a periodic but longer timer. With RIP, the 
update timer is 30 seconds, and with OSPF, the timer is 30 minutes.
10. B. Link-state protocols collect information about the internetwork in the form of LSAs, 
which sit in memory in the link-state database. The router then runs the SPF algorithm 
to calculate that router’s best metric route to reach each subnet.

638     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes
Chapter 9
1.
A. OSPF calculates metrics based on the cost associated with each interface. OSPF, by 
default, calculates interface cost based on the bandwidth setting.
2.
A and D. OSPF uses the SPF algorithm, conceived by a mathematician named Dijkstra.
3.
A and D. Routers must use the same authentication type and, if so, the same 
authentication key. Additionally, the subnet number and range of addresses, as 
calculated from the interfaces’ IP addresses and masks, must be the same subnet.
4.
B. Neighboring OSPF routers that complete the database exchange are considered 
fully adjacent and rest in a Full neighbor state.
5.
D and E. The DR is elected based on the highest OSPF priority. If there is a tie, it is 
based on the highest OSPF RID. However, after the DR is elected, the DR role cannot 
be taken over by a better router until the DR and BDR have lost connectivity to the 
subnet. The DR attempts to be fully adjacent to all other routers on the subnet as part 
of the optimized database exchange process.
6.
B. The network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0 command works, because it matches 
all interfaces whose ﬁrst octet is 10. The network 10.0.0.1 0.255.255.0 area 0 
command uses matching logic that matches all interfaces whose ﬁrst octet is 10 and 
last octet is 1, which matches all three interface IP addresses. However, the wildcard 
mask used in OSPF network commands can have only one string of consecutive 
binary 1s, with all other digits as binary 0s, and this wildcard mask breaks that rule.
7.
A. The network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 command matches all IP addresses as 
a result of the 255.255.255.255 wildcard mask, so this command enables OSPF in Area 
0 on all interfaces. The answer with wildcard mask 0.255.255.0 is illegal, because it 
represents more than one string of binary 0s separated by binary 1s. The answer with 
x’s is syntactically incorrect. The answer with wildcard mask 255.0.0.0 means “Match 
all addresses whose last 3 octets are 0.0.0,” so none of the three interfaces are matched.
8.
A, B, and E
9.
B and D. For R2’s neighbor state for neighbor R3 to be Full, R2 and R3 must have 
passed the authentication process as required by R2’s conﬁguration. The 
authentication key must be conﬁgured with the ip ospf authentication message-
digest-key interface subcommand. However, the authentication type does not have to 
be conﬁgured with the ip ospf authentication message-digest-key interface 
subcommand. R1 is in an Init state because of one of several issues that can occur that 
prevent neighbors from communicating, so it cannot be determined if R1’s problem is 
an authentication problem.
10. D. The OSPF maximum-paths number router subcommand sets the number of equal-
cost routes added to the routing table. This command defaults to a setting of 4.

3.
B. The Feasible Distance (FD) is, for all known routes to reach a subnet, the metric for 
the best of those routes. The best route is called the successor route, and it is added to 
the IP routing table.
4.
C. A route’s reported distance (RD) is the metric used by the neighbor that advertised 
the route. A router uses it to determine which routes meet the feasibility condition for 
whether the route can be a feasible successor route.
5.
A and C. The EIGRP network command supports a parameter of a classful network, 
enabling EIGRP on all interfaces in that classful network, or an address and wildcard 
mask. In the latter case, interface IP addresses that match the conﬁgured address, when 
applying ACL-like logic with the wildcard mask, match the command.
6.
C and D. The EIGRP network 10.0.0.2 0.0.0.0 command exactly matches the interface 
with address 10.0.0.2 because of the wildcard mask, enabling EIGRP on that interface. 
The EIGRP ASN value must match on both routers. The network 10 command is 
syntactically incorrect; the entire classful network must be conﬁgured.
7.
C. The ﬁrst number in parentheses is the computed metric for a route, and the second 
number is the reported distance (RD) for the route. The route through 10.1.6.3 is the 
successor route, so it is not a feasible successor route. For the other two routes, only 
the third route’s RD is less than or equal to the feasible distance (the metric of the 
successor route).
8.
B and D. The MD5 key must be conﬁgured. It is not conﬁgured with an interface 
subcommand, but rather as part of a key chain. The useful lifetime of a key may be 
conﬁgured, but it is not required.
9.

Chapter 12
1.
C. Of the possible answers, only PAP and CHAP are PPP authentication protocols. 
PAP sends the password as clear text between the two devices.
2.
C. The PPP Link Control Protocol (LCP) controls functions that apply to the link 
regardless of the Layer 3 protocol, including looped link detection, link quality 
monitoring, and authentication.

640     Appendix A: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes
3.
A and D. Both routers need an encapsulation ppp command, and both also will need 
IP addresses, before the ping will work. R1 does not need a clock rate command, 
because R2 is connected to the DCE cable.
4.
D. The username command on one router should refer to the case-sensitive hostname 
of the other router.
5.
B and D. The output lists encapsulation PPP, meaning that it is conﬁgured to use PPP. 
The line and protocol status are both up, LCP is open, and both CDPCP and IPCP are 
open, meaning that IP and CDP packets can be sent over the link.
6.
C and D. Physical layer problems typically result in a line status (ﬁrst status code) 
value of “down.” A remote router IP address in a different subnet would not prevent a 
PPP-conﬁgured interface from reaching a protocol status (second line status) of “up.” 
If the other end of the link was misconﬁgured to use HDLC, or if it was conﬁgured for 
PPP but CHAP authentication failed, the interface could be in an “up and down” state, 
as shown.
7.
B. With PPP, two routers can use IP addresses in different subnets on opposite ends of 
the links, and a ping to the other router’s serial IP address works. However, this subnet 
mismatch causes routing protocols to fail when forming neighbor relationships to 
exchange routes, so neither router learns EIGRP routes from the other.
Chapter 13
1.
C. The LMI manages the link between the DTE and the switch, including noticing 
when a virtual circuit (VC) comes up or goes down.
2.
A and D. The DTE typically sits at the customer site, and the DCE sits at the service 
provider site. Frame Relay switches send LMI messages to DTEs (typically routers) to 
signal VC status. A Frame Relay frame does not have a source and destination DLCI, 
but a single DLCI ﬁeld.
3.
A
4.
C. The DLCI addresses a VC, not a router. The DLCI value in the frame as it crosses 
the local link represents that VC on that link. Because the question refers to a frame 
crossing the access link connected to R1, 222 is the local DLCI on R1 that identiﬁes 
that VC.
5.
B and C. The global DLCIs represent the DLCI the other routers use when sending 
frames over their local access links. So, when R1 sends a frame to R2, when the frame 
crosses R2’s access link, the network has changed the DLCI to R1’s global DLCI, 101. 
Similarly, when R3 sends a frame to R1, as the frame crosses R3’s access link, the 
frame has R1’s global DLCI in it, 101.

Chapter 14     641
6.
A. A single subnet can be used in any Frame Relay topology, but with a full mesh, a 
single subnet can be used with no tricky issues related to routing protocols.
7.
D. BarneyCo has a total of ten VCs. With all of them conﬁgured on point-to-point 
subinterfaces, you need ten subnets, because you need one subnet per VC.
8.
A. The frame that experienced the congestion was going from R1 to R2, so the frame 
with the Backward (opposite direction) Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (BECN) bit 
set would go in the opposite direction, from R2 back to R1.
Chapter 14
1.
C. The correct keywords are ansi and q933. However, the routers autodetect the LMI 
type by default, so not conﬁguring the LMI also works.
2.
C, D, and E. The LMI type is autosensed by default. Inverse ARP is on by default as 
well, meaning that it does not need to be enabled with the frame-relay inverse-arp 
command, nor do any static mapping statements need to be added.
3.
A and E. The IP address moves to the subinterface, so it needs to be removed from the 
serial interface ﬁrst (with the no ip address command). The encapsulation stays on the 
physical interface. The frame-relay interface-dlci command must be used on the 
subinterface so that the router knows which DLCI goes with which subinterface—even 
if only one DLCI exists.
4.
F. You can code only one DLCI on a frame-relay interface-dlci command, and you 
need one for each VC under the multipoint interface.
5.
F
6.
C and E. Up and down are not PVC status codes. Inactive means that the switch thinks 
a deﬁned PVC is not working, and deleted means that the DLCI is not deﬁned at the 
switch.
7.
D. For a Frame Relay subinterface to be in an up/up state, the underlying physical 
interface must be in an up/up state, and at least one of the PVCs associated with the 
subinterface must be in one of the two working PVC states (active or static).
8.
B and C. For a Frame Relay physical interface to have a line status of “up,” the same 
physical layer features as used on leased lines must be working. To also have a protocol 
status of “down,” either the router is missing the encapsulation frame-relay 
command, or the router and switch disagree about the LMI type.

A. Extranet VPNs connect sites in different but cooperating companies. Access VPNs 
provide access to individual users, typically from home or while traveling. The term 
“enterprise VPN” is not generally used to describe a type of VPN.
2.
C. Antivirus software is an important security function, but it is not a function provided 
by the VPN itself.
3.
A and C. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) headers support all four of the 
functions listed in the answers, whereas the Authentication Header (AH) only supports 
authentication and message integrity.
4.
A. Of these answers, only Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES (3DES), and 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are encryption tools for encrypting the entire 
packet. AES provides better encryption and less computation time among the three 
options.

A, D, and E. All the devices and software listed in the answers can be used to terminate 
a VPN tunnel. However, ASAs have replaced PIX ﬁrewalls and VPN concentrators in 
the Cisco product line.
6.
A and C. The client always uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to connect to the Web VPN 
server, so all Internet communications are encrypted. One major advantage of Web 
VPN is that the client does not need to have any client software, just using the built-in 
SSL capabilities of typical web browsers.

C. With static NAT, the entries are statically conﬁgured. Because the question mentions 
translation for inside addresses, the inside keyword is needed in the command.
5.
A. With dynamic NAT, the entries are created as a result of the ﬁrst packet ﬂow from 
the inside network.
6.
A. The list 1 parameter references an IP ACL, which matches packets, identifying the 
inside local addresses.

E. When translating inside addresses, the outside address is not translated, so the 
outside local address does not need to be identiﬁed in the conﬁguration.

B. The last line mentions that the pool has seven addresses, with all seven allocated, 
with the misses counter close to 1000—meaning that close to 1000 new ﬂows were 
rejected because of insufﬁcient space in the NAT pool.

1.
A. One method for IPv6 global unicast address assignment is that ICANN allocates 
large address blocks to RIRs, RIRs assign smaller address blocks to ISPs, and ISPs 
assign even smaller address blocks to their customers.
2.
D. Inside a quartet, any leading 0s can be omitted, and one sequence of 1 or more 
quartets of all 0s can be replaced with double colons (::). The correct answer replaces 
the longer 3-quartet sequence of 0s with ::.
3.
D. Global unicast addresses begin with 2000::/3, meaning that the ﬁrst 3 bits match the 
value in hex 2000. Similarly, unique local addresses match FD00::/8, and link local 
addresses match FE80::/10 (values that begin with FE8, FE9, FEA, and FED hex). 
Multicast IPv6 addresses begin with FF00::/8, meaning that the ﬁrst 2 hex digits are F.
4.
A and C. IPv6 supports stateful DHCP, which works similarly to IPv4’s DHCP 
protocol to dynamically assign the entire IP address. Stateless autoconﬁguration also 
allows the assignment by ﬁnding the preﬁx from some nearby router and calculating 
the interface ID using the EUI-64 format.
5.
A and D. Stateless autoconﬁguration only helps a host learn and form its own IP 
address, but it does not help the host learn a default gateway. Stateless RS is not a valid 
term or feature. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is used for several purposes, 
including the same purpose as ARP in IPv4, and for learning conﬁguration parameters 
like a default gateway IP address.
6.
A and D. OSPFv3, RIPng, EIGRP for IPv6, and MP-BGP4 all support IPv6.
7.
C and E. The conﬁguration explicitly assigns the 3456::1 IP address. The interface also 
forms the EUI-64 interface ID (6444:44FF:FE44:4444), adding it to FE80::/64, to 
form the link local IP address.
8.
E. RIPng conﬁguration does not use a network command; instead, the ipv6 rip 
command is conﬁgured on the interface, listing the same tag as on the ipv6 router rip 
command, and the enable keyword.
9.
D. Network Address Translation–Protocol Translation (NAT-PT) translates between 
IPv4 and IPv6, and vice versa. The two tunneling methods allow IPv6 hosts to 
communicate with other IPv6 hosts, sending the packets through an IPv4 network. 
Dual-stack allows a host or router to concurrently support both protocols.

Decimal to Binary 
Conversion Table
This appendix provides a handy reference for converting between decimal and binary 
formats for the decimal numbers 0 through 255. Feel free to refer to this table when 
practicing any of the subnetting problems found in this book and on the CD-ROM.
Although this appendix is useful as a reference tool, note that if you plan to convert values 
between decimal and binary when doing the various types of subnetting problems on the 
exams, instead of using the shortcut processes that mostly avoid binary math, you will 
likely want to practice converting between the two formats before the exam. For practice, 
just pick any decimal value between 0 and 255, convert it to 8-bit binary, and then use this 
table to ﬁnd out if you got the right answer. Also, pick any 8-bit binary number, convert it 
to decimal, and again use this table to check your work.

G L O S S A R Y
ABR
Area Border Router. A router using OSPF in which the router has interfaces in multiple 
OSPF areas.
access link
In Frame Relay, the physical serial link that connects a Frame Relay DTE, 
usually a router, to a Frame Relay switch. The access link uses the same physical layer 
standards as do point-to-point leased lines.
access rate
See AR.
ACL
Access control list. A list configured on a router to control packet flow through the 
router, such as to prevent packets with a certain IP address from leaving a particular interface 
on the router.
administrative distance
In Cisco routers, a means for one router to choose between multiple 
routes to reach the same subnet when those routes are learned by different routing protocols. 
The lower the administrative distance, the more preferred the source of the routing 
information.
administrative mode
See trunking administrative mode.
alternate port
In RSTP 802.1w, a port role used to denote an interface that is currently 
receiving an inferior Hello BPDU, making it a possible replacement for the root port. Also 
used in the Cisco 802.1d STP implementation.
AR
Access Rate. In Frame Relay, the speed at which bits are sent over an access link.
Area Border Router
See ABR.
ARP
Address Resolution Protocol. An Internet protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC 
address. Defined in RFC 826.
ASBR
Autonomous System Border Router. A router using OSPF in which the router learns 
routes via another source, typically another routing protocol, exchanging routes that are 
external to OSPF with the OSPF domain.

654     asynchronous
asynchronous
Describes a convention for sending data with digital signals. The sender and 
receiver operate at the same speeds, but no attempt is made to dynamically cause the sender 
and receiver to adjust their speeds based on the other device’s speed.
Autonomous System Border Router
See ASBR.
autosummarization
A routing protocol feature in which a router that connects to more than 
one classful network advertises summarized routes for each entire classful network when 
sending updates out interfaces connected to other classful networks.
B
backup designated router
An OSPF router connected to a multiaccess network that 
monitors the work of the designated router (DR) and takes over the work of the DR if the DR 
fails.
backup port
In RSTP 802.1w, a port role used when multiple interfaces on one switch 
connect to a single collision domain. This makes one interface the designated port (DP), and 
one or more others become available to replace the DP (backup role).
balanced hybrid
Refers to one of three general types of routing protocol algorithms. The 
other two are distance vector and link-state. EIGRP is the only routing protocol that Cisco 
classifies as using a balanced hybrid algorithm.
Bc
Committed burst. A Frame Relay term referring to the number of bits that can be sent 
during a defined time interval. This helps measure if/when the DTE has, on average, sent more 
data over a VC than the speed defined in the traffic contract.
BECN
Backward explicit congestion notification. The bit in the Frame Relay header that 
implies that congestion is occurring in the opposite (backward) direction from the frame. 
Switches and DTEs can react by slowing the rate at which data is sent in that direction.
Blocking State
In 802.1d STP, a port state in which no received frames are processed, and 
the switch forwards no frames out the interface, with the exception of STP messages.
Boolean AND
A math operation performed on a pair of one-digit binary numbers. The result 
is another one-digit binary number. 1 AND 1 yields 1; all other combinations yield 0.
BPDU
Bridge protocol data unit. The generic name for Spanning Tree Protocol messages.
BPDU Guard
A Cisco switch feature that listens for incoming STP BPDU messages, 
disabling the interface if any are received. The goal is to prevent loops when a switch connects 
to a port expected to only have a host connected to it.

classful addressing     655
BRI
Basic Rate Interface. An ISDN interface composed of two bearer  channels and one data 
(D) channel for circuit-switched communication of voice, video, and data.
bridge ID (BID)
An 8-byte identifier for bridges and switches used by STP and RSTP. It is 
composed of a 2-byte priority field followed by a 6-byte System ID field that is usually filled 
with a MAC address.
bridge protocol data unit
See BPDU.
broadcast address
See subnet broadcast address.
broadcast domain
A set of all devices that receive broadcast frames originating from any 
device in the set. Devices in the same VLAN are in the same broadcast domain.
broadcast subnet
When subnetting a Class A, B, or C network, the one subnet in each 
classful network for which all subnet bits have a value of binary 1. The subnet broadcast 
address in this subnet has the same numeric value as the classful network’s network-wide 
broadcast address.
C
CHAP
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol. A security feature defined by PPP 
that allows either or both endpoints on a link to authenticate the other device as a particular 
authorized device.
CIDR
An RFC-standard tool for global IP address range assignment. CIDR reduces the size 
of Internet routers’ IP routing tables, helping deal with the rapid growth of the Internet. The 
term classless refers to the fact that the summarized groups of networks represent a group of 
addresses that do not confirm to IPv4 classful (Class A, B, and C) grouping rules.
CIDR notation
See prefix notation.
CIR
Committed Information Rate. In Frame Relay and ATM, the average speed at which 
bits can be transferred over a virtual circuit according to the business contract between the 
customer and the service provider.
circuit switching
The switching system in which a dedicated physical circuit path must exist 
between the sender and the receiver for the duration of the “call.” Used heavily in the 
telephone company network.
classful addressing
A concept in IPv4 addressing that defines a subnetted IP address as 
having three parts: network, subnet, and host.

656     classful network
classful network
An IPv4 Class A, B, or C network. It is called a classful network because 
these networks are defined by the class rules for IPv4 addressing.
classful routing
A variation of the IPv4 forwarding (routing) process that defines the 
particulars of how the default route is used. The default route is used only if the classful 
network in which the packet’s destination address resides is missing from the router’s routing 
table.
classful routing protocol
An inherent characteristic of a routing protocol. Specifically, the 
routing protocol does not send subnet masks in its routing updates. This requires the protocol 
to make assumptions about classful networks and makes it unable to support VLSM and 
manual route summarization.
classless addressing
A concept in IPv4 addressing that defines a subnetted IP address as 
having two parts: a prefix (or subnet) and a host.
classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
See CIDR.
classless routing
A variation of the IPv4 forwarding (routing) process that defines the 
particulars of how the default route is used. The default route is always used for packets whose 
destination IP address does not match any other routes.
classless routing protocol
An inherent characteristic of a routing protocol. Specifically, the 
routing protocol sends subnet masks in its routing updates, thereby removing any need to make 
assumptions about the addresses in a particular subnet or network. This allows the protocol to 
support VLSM and manual route summarization.
Committed Information Rate (CIR)
See CIR.
contiguous network
In IPv4, a internetwork design in which packets being forwarded 
between any two subnets of a single classful network only pass through the subnets of that 
classful network.
convergence
The time required for routing protocols to react to changes in the network, 
removing bad routes and adding new, better routes so that the current best routes are in all the 
routers’ routing tables.
counting to infinity
An unfortunate side effect of distance vector routing protocols in which 
the routers slowly increase the metric for a failed route until the metric reaches that routing 
protocol’s finite definition of a maximum metric (called infinity).
CSU/DSU
Channel service unit/data service unit. A device that connects a physical circuit 
installed by the telco to some CPE device, adapting between the voltages, current, framing, 
and connectors used on the circuit to the physical interface supported by the DTE.

disabled port     657
D

OSPF LSDB.
data-link connection identifier (DLCI)
See DLCI.
DCE
Data communications equipment. From a physical layer perspective, the device 
providing the clocking on a WAN link, typically a CSU/DSU, is the DCE. From a packet-
switching perspective, the service provider’s switch, to which a router might connect, is 
considered the DCE.
DE
Discard eligible. The bit in the Frame Relay header that, if frames must be discarded, 
signals a switch to choose this frame to discard instead of another frame without the DE bit set.
Dead Timer
In OSPF, a timer used for each neighbor. A router considers the neighbor to 
have failed if no Hellos are received from that neighbor in the time defined by the timer.
deny
An action taken with an ACL that implies that the packet is discarded.
designated port
In both STP and RSTP, a port role used to determine which of multiple 
interfaces, each connected to the same segment or collision domain, should forward frames to 
the segment. The switch advertising the lowest-cost Hello BPDU onto the segment becomes 
the DP.

therefore responsible for managing a streamlined process for exchanging OSPF topology 
information between all routers attached to that network.

devices on either side of an unsecure network such as the Internet, can allow the devices to 
send data securely. VPNs provide privacy, device authentication, anti-replay services, and data 
integrity services.
VLAN
See virtual LAN.
VLAN configuration database
The name of the collective configuration of VLAN IDs and 
names on a Cisco switch.
vlan.dat
The default file used to store a Cisco switch’s VLAN configuration database.
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
A Cisco-proprietary messaging protocol used between 
Cisco switches to communicate configuration information about the existence of VLANs, 
including the VLAN ID and VLAN name.
VLSM
Variable-length subnet mask(ing). The ability to specify a different subnet mask for 
the same Class A, B, or C network number on different subnets. VLSM can help optimize 
available address space.
VoIP
Voice over IP. The transport of voice traffic inside IP packets over an IP network.
VPN
See virtual private network.
VPN client
Software that resides on a PC, often a laptop, so that the host can implement the 
protocols required to be an endpoint of a VPN.

zero subnet     673
VTP
See VLAN Trunking Protocol.
VTP client mode
One of three VTP operational modes for a switch with which switches 
learn about VLAN numbers and names from other switches, but which does not not allow the 
switch to be directly configured with VLAN information. 
VTP pruning
The VTP feature by which switches dynamically choose interfaces on which 
to prevent the flooding of frames in certain VLANs when the frames do not need to go to every 
switch in the network.
VTP server mode
One of three sets of operating characteristics (modes) in VTP. Switches 
in server mode can configure VLANs, tell other switches about the changes, and learn about 
VLAN changes from other switches.
VTP transparent mode
One of three sets of operating characteristics (modes) in VTP. 
Switches in transparent mode can configure VLANs, but they do not tell other switches about 
the changes, and they do not learn about VLAN changes from other switches.
W
web VPN
A tool offered by Cisco in which a user can use any common web browser to 
securely connect using SSL to a web VPN server, which then connects to the user’s Enterprise 
web-based applications—applications that may or may not support SSL.
wildcard mask
The mask used in Cisco IOS ACL commands and OSPF and EIGRP 
network commands.
Z
zero subnet
For every classful IPv4 network that is subnetted, the one subnet whose subnet 
number has all binary 0s in the subnet part of the number. In decimal, the 0 subnet can be 
easily identified because it is the same number as the classful network number.
