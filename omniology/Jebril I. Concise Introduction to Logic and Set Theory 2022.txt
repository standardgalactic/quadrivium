Preface
The book deals with two most important branches of mathematics, namely, logic
and set theory. Logic and set theory are two closely related branches of mathemat-
ics that play very crucial role in the foundations of mathematics, and together these
produced several beautiful results in all of mathematics. The book is designed for
various courses where mathematical logic and set theory are required either as com-
pulsory subjects or as parts of other subjects. The book consists of ﬁve chapters, and
they are organised as follows:
Chapter 1 deals with basics of mathematical logic. The chapter starts with the
concept of “set” brieﬂy with examples. Then several topics and notions, such as
propositions, connectives, tautology, contradiction, quantiﬁers, logical reasoning,
mathematical proof, direct and contrapositive proof, contradiction proof, and in-
duction principle, are discussed with examples. Exercises are also incorporated at
different places of the chapter.
Chapter 2 starts with the basic notions of set theory. Then several elementary
properties and operations on sets, such as union of sets, intersection of sets, com-
plement of set, and difference and symmetric difference of sets, are discussed with
examples and diagrammatic representations. Finally, the chapter discusses indexed
families of sets. Several exercises relevant to the topics discussed are also incorpo-
rated at different places within the chapter.
Chapter 3 deals with the notion of relations with lots of examples, diagram-
matic representations, and exercises. In particular, the chapter discusses notions
such as ordered pairs and Cartesian product, relations on sets, type of relations,
equivalence relations, equivalence classes, congruence, and partial and total ordered
relations.
Chapter 4 discusses the concept of functions, and basic ideas associated with this
notion with the help of several examples and diagrammatic representations. In par-
ticular, the chapter discusses concepts such as domain and range of a function, graph
of a function, functions that are onto and one-to-one, composite function, inverse
function, and direct images and inverse images under function. Relevant exercises
are also added at different locations of the chapter.
Chapter 5 deals with the cardinality of sets. Several notions and associated ideas
on ﬁnite and inﬁnite sets, equivalent sets, countable and uncountable sets, and car-
dinal arithmetic are also discussed. Finally, Cantor’s theorem, Schr¨oder–Bernstein
theorem and axiom of choice are presented. This chapter also contains several exam-
ples and exercises.
We would like to offer our sincere thanks to all the authors who have con-
tributed extensively in the ﬁeld of set theory and mathematical logic and our family

1 Mathematical Logic
Logic is the analysis of reasoning, and it concerns with the picture of thought not
with its subject. Mathematical logic, however, is one of the mathematical branches
that concerns with explaining types of reasoning used by mathematicians.
In this chapter, we present set concept brieﬂy. Set theory is the cornerstone in
the foundations of mathematical logic, and it is the device of deﬁning and analyzing
primary concepts. After that we deﬁne the proposition and explain the way to connect
simple propositions with one link or more to get a compound proposition. Then, we
talk about the qualiﬁed propositions and valid arguments. We conclude the chapter
with methods of mathematical proof.
1.1
SETS
In this section, we present a simple introduction of sets, which form a base of study-
ing logic. In chapter two, we will describe set theory in more detail, giving notations
and results, which we need later.
Although we will not formally deﬁne the word “set”, we will use it to refer to a
collection of objects of some sort. We indicate that an object x is in a set A by writing
x ∈A. If x is not in A, we write x ̸∈A. The objects in a set A are usually called the
elements of A.
Example 1.1.1
(1) 2 ∈{1,2,3,a,b},
(2) 3 ̸∈{−1,0,1}.
We say that sets A and B are equal and write A = B in case A and B contain exactly
the same elements.

R = the set of real numbers.
C = {a + bi : a,b ∈R,i2 = −1}, the set of complex numbers.
Z+ = {1,2,3,...}, the set of positive integers.
Z−= {−1,−2,−3,...}, the set of negative integers.
Ze = {0,±2,±4,...}, the set of even integers.
Zo = {±1,±3,±5,...}, the set of odd integers.
Let a,b ∈R such that a < b. Then,
the open interval (a,b) is the set of real numbers between a and b, but does not
include the endpoints a and b, that is
(a,b) = {x ∈R | a < x < b},

Whereas, the closed interval [a,b] is the set of real numbers between a and b, and
it includes the endpoints a and b, that is

1.2
PROPOSITIONS AND CONNECTIVES
In English language, some sentences are interrogatory (Where is my book?), others
exclamatory (Oh!), and others have a deﬁnite sense of truth to them.
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 A proposition (or statement) is a sentence that is either true or false.
Thus, a proposition has exactly one truth value: true, which we denote by T, or false,
which we denote by F.
Some examples of propositions are
(a) 3 + 4 = 7 (true proposition),
(b)
√
3 is a rational number (false proposition),
(c) Amman is the capital of Jordan (true proposition),
(d) If f(x) = sinx, then f ′(x) = cosx (true proposition),
(e) There exists a natural number n such that n < 0 (false proposition), and
(f) Al Riyadh is the capital of Saudi Arabia (true proposition).
The following sentences are not propositions:
(g) How are you?
(h) x+ 9 = 100.
(i) Give me your book.
Remark 1.2.2 Propositions will be denoted by capital letters like:
P,Q,R,S,...
Deﬁnition 1.2.3 Any two propositions can be combined by the word “and” to form
a composite proposition, which is called conjunction of the original propositions.
Symbolically, the conjunction of two propositions P and Q is denoted by P∧Q.

4
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 1.2.4 Let P be “it is raining” and let Q be “the sun is shining”. Then P∧Q
denotes the proposition “it is raining and the sun is shining”.
Example 1.2.5 Let P be “3 + 2 ̸= 7”, and let Q be “Paris is in France”. Then P∧Q
denotes the proposition “3 + 2 ̸= 7 and Paris is in France”.
The truth value of the composite proposition P∧Q satisﬁes the following property:
Property 1.2.6 If P is true and Q is true, then P∧Q is true; otherwise P∧Q is false.
In other words, the conjunction P∧Q of two propositions P and Q is true if and only
if both components P and Q are true.
Examples 1.2.7 Consider the following four propositions:
(a) Damascus is in Syria and 4+ 5 = 10,
(b) Damascus is in Syria and 4+ 5 = 9,
(c) Damascus is in Syria and 4+ 5 = 0,
(d) Damascus is in Syria and 4+ 5 = −9.
By the property 1.2.6, only (b) is true.
A convenient way to state the above property is by means of a truth table as
follows:
P
Q
P∧Q
T
T
T
T
F
F
F
T
F
F
F
F
Note that the ﬁrst line is a short way of saying that if P is true and Q is true, then
P∧Q is true. The other lines have analogous meaning.
Deﬁnition 1.2.8 Any two propositions can be combined by the word “or” to form a
new proposition, which is called disjunction of the original two propositions. Sym-
bolically, the disjunction of propositions P and Q is denoted by P∨Q.
Any two propositions can be combined by the word “or” to form a new proposition,
which is called the disjunction of the original two propositions. Symbolically, the
disjunction of propositions P and Q is denoted by P∨Q.
Example 1.2.9 Let P be “1 ̸= 5” and let Q be “
√
2 is irrational”. Then P∨Q is the
proposition “1 ̸= 5 or
√
2 is irrational”.
The truth value of the composite proposition P∨Q satisﬁes the following property:
Property 1.2.10 If P is true or Q is true or both P and Q are true, then P∨Q is true;
otherwise, P∨Q is false. In other words, the disjunction of two propositions is false
only if each component is false.

P

P∨Q

Deﬁnition 1.2.11 Given any proposition P, another proposition, called negation of
P, can be formed by writing “it is false that ...” before P, or, if possible, by adding
the word “not” to P. Symbolically, the negation of P is denoted by ∼P.
Example 1.2.12 Consider the following propositions:
(a) Amman is in Jordan,
(b) It is false that Amman is in Jordan,
(c) Amman is not in Jordan.
Then (b) and (c) are each the negation of (a).
Example 1.2.13 Consider the following propositions:
(a) 3 + 4 = 9,
(b) It is false that 3 + 4 = 9,
(c) 3 + 4 ̸= 9.
Then both (b) and (c) are the negation of (a).
The truth value of the negation of a proposition satisﬁes the following property:
Property 1.2.14 If P is true, then ∼P is false, and if P is false, then ∼P is true. In
other words, the truth value of the negation of a proposition is always the opposite of
the truth value of the original proposition.
Property 1.2.14 can also be written in the form of a table as follows:
P
∼P
T
F
F
T
Example 1.2.15 Consider the propositions in Example 1.2.12 above. Notice that (a)
is true, and (b) and (c), its negations, are false.
Example 1.2.16 Consider the propositions in Example 1.2.13 above. Notice that (a)
is false, and (b) and (c), its negations, are true.
Deﬁnition 1.2.17 Many propositions, especially in mathematics, are of the form “if
P, then Q”. Such propositions are called conditional propositions and are denoted by
P ⇒Q.

6
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
The conditional P ⇒Q can also be read:
(1) P implies Q,
(2) P only if Q,
(3) P is sufﬁcient for Q,
(4) Q is necessary for P.
The truth value of the conditional proposition P ⇒Q satisﬁes the following property:
Property 1.2.18 The conditional P ⇒Q is true unless P is true and Q is false.
In other words, property 1.2.18 states that a true proposition cannot imply a false
proposition.
Property 1.2.18 can be written in the form of a table as follows:
P
Q
P ⇒Q

Example 1.2.19 Consider the following propositions:
(a) If Al Riyadh is in Saudi Arabia, then 7+ 2 = 13,
(b) If Al Riyadh is in Saudi Arabia, then 7+ 2 = 9,
(c) If Al Riyadh is in Jordan, then 7+ 2 = 9,
(d) If Al Riyadh is in Jordan, then 7+ 2 = 13.
By the property 1.2.18, only (a) is a false proposition. The others are true.
Deﬁnition 1.2.20 Another composite proposition is of the form “P if and only if Q”
or (shortly) “P iff Q”. Such propositions are called bi-conditional propositions and
are denoted by P ⇔Q.
The truth value of the bi-conditional proposition P ⇔Q satisﬁes the following:
Property 1.2.21 If P and Q have the same truth value, then P ⇔Q is true; if P and
Q have opposite truth values, then P ⇔Q is false.
Property 1.2.21 can be written in the form of a table as follows:

Example 1.2.22 Consider the following propositions:
(a) 2 < 4 ⇔−1 < 0,
(b) 2 + 3 = 5 ⇔Amman is in Iraq,
(c)
√
2 is a rational number ⇔Amman is in Jordan,
(d) −3 is a natural number ⇔Baghdad is in Jordan.
According to property 1.2.21, (a) and (d) are true; however; (b) and (c) are false.
Remark 1.2.23 The following expressions give the same meaning:
(a) P ⇔Q,
(b) P is necessary and sufﬁcient for Q,
(c) Q is necessary and sufﬁcient for P,
(d) P if and only if Q.
Deﬁnition 1.2.24 Two propositions P and Q are said to be logically equivalent if
their truth tables are identical. We denote the logical equivalence of P and Q by
P ≡Q.
Example 1.2.25 The truth tables of (P ⇔Q)∧(Q ⇒P) and P ⇔Q are as follows:
P

P ⇒Q
Q ⇒P
(P ⇔Q)∧(Q ⇒P)

propositions. In other words, a tautology will contain only T in the last column of its
truth table.
Example 1.3.2 The proposition “P or not P”, i.e. P∨∼P, is a tautology. This fact
is veriﬁed by constructing a truth table.

QUANTIFIERS
Let A be a set. An open sentence on A is an expression, denoted by P(x), which has
the property that P(a) is true or false for each a ∈A.
Example 1.4.1 Let P(x) be “x+ 3 > 8”. Then P(x) is an open sentence on N.
Example 1.4.2 Let P(x) be “x + 3 > 8”. Then P(x) is not an open sentence on C
since inequalities are not deﬁned for all complex numbers.
If P(x) is an open sentence on a set A, then the set of elements a ∈A with the
property that P(a) is true, is called truth set Tp of P(x). In other words,
Tp = {x : x ∈A,P(x) is true },
or, simply,
Tp = {x : P(x)}.
Example 1.4.3 Let P(x) be “x+ 3 > 8” deﬁned on N. Then the truth set of P(x) on
N is
Tp = {x : x ∈N,x+ 3 > 8} = {6,7,8,9,...}.
Example 1.4.4 Let P(x) be “x+ 2 < 1”, deﬁned on N. Then
Tp = {x;x ∈N,x+ 2 < 1} = φ.
Example 1.4.5 Let P(x) be “x+ 3 ≥4”, deﬁned on N. Then
Tp = {x : x ∈N,x+ 3 ≥4} = {1,2,3,...} = N.

Mathematical Logic

Deﬁnition 1.4.6 Let P(x) be an open sentence on a set A. Then the proposition
(∀x ∈A) or ∀x P(x) can be read as “For every element x in A, P(x) holds” or
simply, “For all x, P(x)”.
The symbol ∀, which reads “for all” or “for every”, is called the universal quan-
tiﬁer.
Example 1.4.7 The proposition for all natural number n, n + 3 ≥4 is true since
{n : n + 3 ≥4} = {1,2,3,...} = N.
Example 1.4.8 The proposition for all natural number n, n + 2 > 5 is false since
{n : n + 2 > 5} = {4,5,6,...} ̸= N.
Deﬁnition 1.4.9 Let P(x) be an open sentence on a set A. Then the proposition
“∃x ∈A) P(x)” or “∃x, P(x)” reads “There exists x ∈A such that P(x) holds” or
simply, “For some x, P(x)”.
The symbol ∃, which reads “there exists” or “for some” or “for at least”, is called
the existential quantiﬁer.
Example 1.4.10 The proposition exists n ∈N, n + 4 < 7 is true since
{n ∈N : n + 4 < 7} = {1,2} ̸= φ.
Example 1.4.11 The proposition exists n ∈N, n + 6 < 5 is false since
{n ∈N : n + 6 < 5} = φ.
Deﬁnition 1.4.12 For an open sentence P(x), the proposition “(∃!x), P(x)” is read
“There exists a unique x, such that P(x)”. The sentence “(∃!x), P(x)” is true, when
the truth set for P(x) contains exactly one element from the universe; hence ∃! is
called the unique existence quantiﬁer.
Deﬁnition 1.4.13 Now we deﬁne the negation of propositions, which contain quan-
tiﬁers. The negation of the proposition “All the integers are positive” reads “It is not
true that all integers are positive”; in other words, there exists at least one integer,
which is not positive.
Symbolically, if Z denotes the set of integer, then the above can be written as
∼(∀x ∈Z)(x is positive) ≡(∃x ∈Z)(x is not positive).
Furthermore, if P(x) denotes “x is positive”, then the above can be written as
∼(∀x ∈Z)P(x) ≡(∃x ∈Z) ∼P(x).
Theorem 1.4.14 (De Morgan) If P(x) is an open sentence, then
(a) ∼(∀x)P(x) ≡(∃x) ∼P(x),
(b) ∼(∃x)P(x) ≡(∀x) ∼P(x).

14
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof (a) The sentence ∼(∀x)P(x) is true
iff (∀x)P(x) is false,
iff the truth set of P(x) is not the universe,
iff the truth set of ∼P(x) is not empty,
iff (∃x) ∼P(x) is true.
Thus, ∼(∀x)P(x) is true if and only if (∃x) ∼P(x) is true. So the proposition is
true.
(b) See Exercise 1.
Example 1.4.15 The negation of the proposition
“For all natural numbers n,n + 3 > 7”
is equivalent to the proposition
“There exists an n such that n + 3 ≤7”.
In other words,
∼(∀n ∈N)(n + 3 > 7) ≡(∃n ∈N)(n + 3 ≤7).
Example 1.4.16 The negation of the proposition “All prime numbers are odd” is
equivalent to the proposition “there exists a number that is prime and not odd”.
In other words, if A is the set of prime numbers, then
∼(∀x ∈A)(x is odd) ≡(∃x ∈A)(x is not odd).

LOGICAL REASONING
Deﬁnition 1.5.1 An argument is an assertion that a given set of propositions
S1,S2,...,Sn, called premises, yields another proposition S, called the conclusion.
Such an argument will be denoted by S1,S2,...,Sn ⊢S.
Note that an argument is a proposition and therefore has a truth value. If an
argument is true, it is called a valid argument; if not, it is called a fallacy.
Example 1.5.2
1. Consider the following propositions:
S1 : Some mathematicians are philosophers,
S2 : Ahmad is a mathematician,
S : Then Ahmad is a philosopher.
The argument S1, S2 ⊢S does not valid, because not all mathematicians are
philosophers.
2. Consider the following propositions:
S1 : All poets are interesting people,
S2 : Ahmad is an interesting person,
S : Ahmad is a poet.
The argument S1, S2 ⊢S is fallacy.
3. Consider the following propositions:
S1 : No college professor is wealthy,
S2 : Some poets are wealthy,
S : Some poets are not college professors.
The argument S1, S2 ⊢S is valid.

Mathematical Logic

4. Consider the following propositions:
S1 : If it rains, Nazar will be sick,
S2 : Nazar was not sick,
S : It did not rain.
The argument S1, S2 ⊢S is valid.
Remark 1.5.3
1. Note that the truth value of an argument
S1,S2,...,Sn ⊢S
does not depend upon the particular truth value of each of the propositions in
the argument.
2. Note that the argument
S1,S2,...,Sn ⊢S
is valid if and only if the proposition
(S1 ∧S2 ∧···∧Sn) ⇒S is a tautology.
3. Note that Venn diagrams are very often used to determine the validity of an
argument.
Example 1.5.4 Let the propositions be:
S1 : Some students are lazy,
S2 : All males are lazy,
S : Some students are males.
Show that the argument S1,S2 ⊢S does not valid by constructing a Venn diagram, in
which the premises S1 and S2 hold, but the conclusion S does not hold.
Solution: Consider the following diagram:
Students
Lazy People
Males
Notice that both premises hold, but the conclusion does not hold.
Example 1.5.5 Let the propositions be:
S1 : All students are lazy.
S2 : Nobody who is wealthy is a student.
S : Lazy people are not wealthy.
Show that the argument S1,S2 ⊢S does not valid by constructing a Venn diagram, in
which the premises S1 and S2 hold, but the conclusion S does not hold.

18
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Solution: Consider the following Venn diagram:
Students
Lazy People
Wealthy People
Notice that the premises hold, but the conclusion does not hold. Hence the argu-
ment is not valid.

P ⇒Q,∼P ⊢∼Q.

MATHEMATICAL PROOF
1.6.1
DIRECT AND CONTRAPOSITIVE PROOF
Deﬁnition 1.6.1 Let S1,S2,...,Sn be a set of propositions yielding another proposi-
tion S. If the argument
S1,S2,...,Sn ⊢S
is valid, then it is called a proof.
The ﬁrst method of proof, which we will examine, is the direct proof of a conditional
sentence. How do we prove a statement in the form P ⇒Q?
This implication is false only when P is true and Q is false. A direct proof of
P ⇒Q will have the following form:

Mathematical Logic
19
Proof.
Assume P
:
:
Therefore Q
Thus P ⇒Q.
Example 1.6.2 Prove that if x is even integer, then x2 is even.
Proof Suppose x is an even integer
Then x = 2k for some integer k.
Thus x2 = 4k2
= 2(2k2)
= 2t for some integer t.
Since x2 is twice the integer t, x2 is even.
Remark 1.6.3 In the above proof, we used the tautology
[(P ⇒S1)∧(S1 ⇒S2)∧...(Sn ⇒R)] ⇒(P ⇒R),
where
P : x is even,
S1 : x = 2k,
S2 : x2 = 4k2,
R : x2 is even.
A second form of proof for a conditional sentence is a proof by contrapositive.
The idea here is that since P ⇒Q ≡∼Q ⇒∼P, we ﬁrst give a direct proof of
∼Q ⇒∼P and then conclude P ⇒Q. That is, instead of proving P ⇒Q, we prove
its equivalent statement ∼Q ⇒∼P. Such a form of proof by contrapositive is as
follows:
Proof Suppose ∼Q.
:
:
Therefore ∼P (Via a direct proof).
Thus ∼Q ⇒∼P.
Therefore P ⇒Q.
Example 1.6.4 Prove that a2 is even ⇒a is even.
Proof Consider the contrapositive
∼(a is even) ⇒∼(a2 is even).
That is,
a is odd ⇒a2 is odd.

20
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Since a is odd, then
a = 2k + 1, for some integer k.
Then
a2 = (2k + 1)2
= 4k2 + 4k + 1
= 2(2k2 + 2k)+ 1
= 2r + 1, where r is an integer.
Thus a2 is odd.
So, by contrapositive, if a2 is even, then a is even.
1.6.2
CONTRADICTION PROOF
A third form of proof is by contradiction, making use of the tautology
P ⇔[∼P ⇒(Q∧∼Q)].
To prove a proposition P, it is sufﬁcient to prove that
∼P ⇒(Q∧∼Q).
A proof by contradiction has the following form:
Proof Suppose ∼P.
:
:
Therefore Q.
:
:
Therefore ∼Q.
Hence Q∧∼Q, a contradiction.
Thus P.
Example 1.6.5 Prove that x ̸= 0 ⇒x−1 ̸= 0 as rational numbers.
Proof Consider P : x ̸= 0,
Q : x−1 ̸= 0.
We need to show that P ⇒Q.
Suppose ∼(P ⇒Q) is true.
Since ∼(P ⇒Q) ≡P∧∼Q,
then P∧∼Q is true, that is x ̸= 0 ∧x−1 = 0 is true.
Since x·x−1 = 1 and x−1 = 0 ⇒x·x−1 = x·0 = 0,
then 1 = 0.
So, one has (1 = 0) and (1 ̸= 0).
It contradicts the number equality. Consequently ∼(P ⇒Q) is false.
Thus P ⇒Q is true.
Hence x ̸= 0 ⇒x−1 ̸= 0.

Mathematical Logic
21
Example 1.6.6 Prove that
√
2 is an irrational number.
Proof Suppose that
√
2 is a rational number.
Then
√
2 = a
b, where a,b are positive integers with gcd(a,b) = 1.
Hence we obtain
√
2 = a
b ⇒a2 = 2b2
⇒a2 is even
⇒a is even
⇒a = 2k, for some integer k.
Then
a2 = 2b2 ⇒(2k)2 = 2b2
⇒4k2 = 2b2
⇒2k2 = b2
⇒b2 is even
⇒b is even
⇒b = 2t, for some integer t.
Thus 2 divides gcd(a,b) and hence gcd(a,b) ≥2.
The contradiction is gcd(a,b) = 1 and gcd(a,b) = 2.
We conclude that
√
2 is an irrational number.

INDUCTION
1.7.1
INTRODUCTION
Proof by induction involves propositions, which depend on the natural numbers, n =
1,2,3,.... It often uses summation notation, which we now brieﬂy review before
discussing induction itself.
We use the symbol∑to denote a sum over its argument for each natural number
i from the lowest value for i (appears below) to the maximum value for i (appears
above).
For example, we write the sum of natural numbers up to a value n as:
1 + 2 + 3 + ···+ (n −1)+ n =
i
∑
i=1
.

INDUCTION PRINCIPLE
In Section 1.6, we have studied some types of mathematical proofs. Here we discuss
another proof technique, called mathematical induction. This technique will be used
to prove a variety of mathematical propositions.
We illustrate the induction principle by the following:
Let P(n) be a proposition, which involves a natural numbers n, i.e., n = 1,2,3,....
Then P(n) is true for all n if and only if
(a) P(1) is true, and
(b) P(k) ⇒P(k + 1) for all natural number k.

Solution:
Step (a) Let us check whether the formula is true for n = 1. Indeed
•

∑
i=1
i = 1,
•
1(1+1)
2
= 1(2)
2
= 2
2 = 1,
i.e., the formula is true for n = 1.
Step (b) Now suppose that the formula is true for n = k and prove that it remains true
for n = k + 1. In other words, the question is:
k
∑
i=1
i = k(k + 1)
2
?
−→
k+1
∑
i=1
i = (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
.
The sum for n = k + 1 may be written as
k+1
∑
i=1
i =
k
∑
i=1
i+ (k + 1)
= k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1)
= k(k + 1)+ 2(k + 1)
2
= (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
.
So, we have shown that if p(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true.
Example 1.7.3 Prove that for all positive integers n, the following results hold.

(2i−1) = n2,

Solution:
1. Step (a) For n = 1 the formula is true, since
• ∑1
i=1(2i−1) = 2 ·1 −1 = 2 −1 = 1,
• (1)2 = 1.
Step (b) Assume that the result is true for n = k, i.e
k
∑
i=1
(2i−1) = k2.

As for n = k + 1 the sum may be written as
k+1
∑
i=1
(2i−1) =
k
∑
i=1
(2i−1)+ (2(k + 1)−1)
= k2 + 2k + 1
= (k + 1)2,
then we have shown that if p(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true.
2. Step (a) For n = 1 the formula is true, since
•

2k = 2k −1

As for n = k + 1 the sum may be written as

then we have shown that if p(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is true.
Example 1.7.4 For a natural number n prove the following propositions:
(1) If n ≥2, then n3 −n is divisible by 3.
(2) n < 2n.
Solution:
1. Step (a) for n = 2,
2 ≥2.
n3 −n = (2)3 −2 = 6 = 3 × 2, so divisible by 3.
An integer n is divisible by 3 if and only if there
exists an integer r such that n = 3r.

Mathematical Logic
27
Step (b) Assume the result is true for n = k, i.e. is
(k3 −k = 3r)
?
−→(k + 1)3 −(k + 1) = 3r,
we have
(k + 1)3 −(k + 1) = k3 + 3k2 + 3k + 1 −(k + 1)
= (k3 −k)+ 3k2 + 3k
= 3r + 3k2 + 3k
= 3(r + k2 + k)
The principle of induction thus implies that n3 −n is indeed divisible by 3 for
all n ≥2.
2. 1. Step (a) For n = 1,
n = 1.
2n = 21. (1 < 2)
2. Step (b) Assume the result is true for n = k, i.e. is
k < 2k
?
−→k + 1 < 2k+1.
We have
k < 2k ⇒k + 1 < 2k + 1
⇒k + 1 < 2k + 2k, (1 < 2k)
⇒k + 1 < 2x2k = 2k+1
Hence k + 1 > 2k+1.
From the principle of induction thus implies that n < 2n natural number n.

2 Set Theory
In this chapter, we shall discuss a basic language that is useful in describing all the
branches of mathematics, namely the language of sets. We will use the word “set”
to refer to any speciﬁed collection of objects. The objects in a given set are called
elements (or members) of the set.
2.1
BASIC NOTIONS OF SET THEORY
In general, sets will be denoted by capital letters
A,B,C,D,E,....
The elements in our sets will be represented by lowercase letters
a,b,c,d,e....
If the object a is an element of set B (a an element belongs to a set B), we write a ∈B,
if not—that is, if
∼(a ∈B)−we write a ̸∈B.
For example, if Z is the set of integers, we write 8 ∈Z and 5/6 ̸∈Z.
One way to describe a set is simply to list its elements between curly braces. For
example, we can deﬁne the set A having exactly the four numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 as
elements by A = {2,4,6,8}.
We call this the tabular form of a set. But if we deﬁne a particular set by stat-
ing properties that its elements must satisfy, for example let B be the set of all odd
numbers, then we use a letter, usually x, to represent an arbitrary element and we
write:
B = {x : x is odd},
which reads “B is the set of numbers x such that x is odd”. We call this the builder
form of a set.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1
Let φ = {x : x ̸= x}. Then φ is a set with no elements and is called an empty set.
Example 2.1.2
{x ∈R : x = x+ 1} = φ = {x ∈N : x < 0}.
Deﬁnition 2.1.3
Let A and B be sets. We say that A is a subset of B iff every element of A is also an
element of B. In symbols this is
A ⊆B ⇔(∀x)(x ∈A ⇐x ∈B).

Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 2.1.4
Let A = {1,3,4}, B = {−1,0,1,3,4}. Then A ⊂B.
Example 2.1.5
N ⊂R, Z ⊂Q.
Theorem 2.1.6
(a) For any set A, φ is a subset of A.
(b) For any set A, A ⊆A.
Proof
(a) Let A be any set. We need to show that
∀x(x ∈φ ⇒x ∈A).
Which is equivalent to
x ̸∈A ⇐x ̸∈φ (contrapositive condition).
It is clear that x ̸∈φ (since φ is a set with no elements).
Then x ̸∈A ⇒x ̸∈φ.
That is, x ∈φ ⇒x ∈A.
Therefore φ ⊆A.
(b) The proof is left as Exercise 1.
Theorem 2.1.7
If A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then A is a subset of C. That is
(A ⊆B∧B ⊆C) ⇒A ⊆C.
Proof
To prove that A ⊆C, we must show that
∀x(x ∈A ⇒x ∈C).
Since A ⊆B, then
∀x(x ∈A ⇒x ∈B),
and since B ⊆C, then
∀x(x ∈B ⇒x ∈C).
Hence ∀x(x ∈A ⇒x ∈C).
Therefore A ⊆C.
Remark 2.1.8
For a given set A, the subsets φ and A are called improper subsets of A, while any
subset of A other than φ or A is called a proper subset.

Set Theory
31
Deﬁnition 2.1.9
For an arbitrary set A, the set of all the subsets of A is called the power set of A. We
denote the power set of A by P(A). Thus
P(A) = {B : B ⊆A}.
Example 2.1.10
Let A = {4,7}. Then
P(A) = {φ,{4},{7},A}.
Example 2.1.11
Let M = {a,b,c}. Then
P(M) = {φ,{a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},M}.
Theorem 2.1.12
If A is a set with n elements, the power set P(A) has 2n elements.
Proof
Suppose A has n elements. We may write A as A = {x1,x2,...,xn}. To describe a
subset B of A, we need to know for each xi ∈A whether the element is in B. For
each xi, there are two possibilities (xi ∈B or xi ̸∈B), so there are 2·2·2···...···2 (n
factors) different ways of i making a subset of A. Therefore, P(A) has 2n elements.
Deﬁnition 2.1.13
Let A and B be sets. Then A = B iff A ⊆B and B ⊆A.
Example 2.1.14
Let A = {x : x is a solution to x2 −4 = 0} and B = {2,−2}. Prove that A = B.
Proof
We must show that A ⊆B and B ⊆A.
Let
t ∈A ⇒t2 −4 = 0
⇒(t −2)(t + 2) = 0
⇒t = 2 or t = −2,
so t ∈B. This proves the inclusion
A ⊆B.
(2.1)
By substitution we see that both 2 and −2 are solutions to
x2 −4 = 0.
Thus
B ⊆A.
(2.2)
It follows from Equations (2.1) and (2.2) that A = B.

32
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Deﬁnition 2.1.15
All the sets under investigation will likely be subsets of a ﬁxed set. We call this set
the universal set or universe of discourse. We denote this set by U.
2.2
ELEMENTARY PROPERTIES OF SETS
2.2.1
UNION OF SETS
Deﬁnition 2.2.1
If A and B are sets. The union of A and B, denoted by A∪B, is the set deﬁned by
A∪B = {x : x ∈A or x ∈B}.
That is, x ∈A∪B ⇔x ∈A∨x ∈B.
Example 2.2.2
In the Venn diagram, we have shaded A∪B, that is the area of A and the area of B
B
A
A ∪ B is shaded
B
A
A ∪ B is shaded
B
A
A ∪ B is shaded
Example 2.2.3
Let X = {a,b,c,d}, Y = {e,b,a,r}. Then
X ∪Y = {a,b,c,d,e,r}.
Example 2.2.4
Let A = {x ∈N : 3 < x < 10} and B = {x ∈N : 1 ≤x ≤3}.
Then A∪B = {x ∈N : 1 ≤x < 10}.
Example 2.2.5
Let Ne = {x ∈N : x is an even number}
= {2,4,6,8,...},
No = {x ∈N : x is an odd number}
= {1,3,5,7,...}.
Then
Ne ∪No = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...} = N.
Theorem 2.2.6
Let A and B be sets. Then
(a) A ⊆A∪B and B ⊆A∪B,
(b) A ⊆B ⇔A∪B = B.

Set Theory
33
Proof
(a) Let x ∈A,
then
x ∈A ⇒x ∈A∨x ∈B
⇒x ∈A∪B.
Thus A ⊆A∪B.
By the same manner, we prove that B ⊆A∪B.
(b) Suppose A ⊆B and x ∈A∪B.
Then
x ∈A∪B ⇒x ∈A∨x ∈B
⇒x ∈B∨x ∈B (since A ⊆B)
⇒x ∈B.
Thus A∪B ⊆B.
Since B ⊆A∪B (by part (a)), then A∪B = B.
Conversely, suppose that A∪B = B.
Since A ⊆A∪B (by part (a)), then A ⊆B.
Theorem 2.2.7
Let A,B, and C be sets. Then
(a) A∪A = A (Idempotent law),
(b) A∪B = B∪A (Commutative law),
(c) A∪(B∪C) = (A∪B)∪C (Associative law).
Proof
We prove (b) and leave (a), (c) as Exercise 2. Suppose x ∈A∪B,
then
x ∈A∪B ⇔x ∈A∨x ∈B
⇔x ∈B∨x ∈A.
Thus A∪B = B∪A.
Theorem 2.2.8
Let A be a set. Then
(a) A∪φ = A,
(b) A∪U = U, where U is the universal set.

34
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof
(a) Since φ ⊆A, then
A∪φ = A( by Theorem 2.2.6).
(b) Since A ⊆U, then
A∪U = U( by Theorem 2.2.6).
2.2.2
INTERSECTION OF SETS
Deﬁnition 2.2.9
If A and B are sets. The intersection of A and B, denoted by A∩B, is deﬁned by
A∩B = {x : x ∈A and x ∈B}.
That is,
x ∈A∩B ⇔x ∈A∧x ∈B.
Example 2.2.10
In the Venn diagram, we have shaded A∩B.
B
A
A ∩ B is shaded
A
B
A ∩ B is shaded
A
B
A ∩ B is shaded
Example 2.2.11
Let A = {1,2,x,y}, B = {2,3,x,4}. Then
A∩B = {2,x}.
Example 2.2.12
Let A = {x ∈N : x ≤6}, B = {x : x is a prime number and ≤6}.
Then
A∩B = {1,2,3,4,5,6} ∩{2,3,5}
= {2,3,5}.
Example 2.2.13
Let A = {x ∈R : 0 ≤x ≤5} and B = {x ∈R : 1/3 ≤x ≤7}.
Then
A∩B = {x ∈R : 1/3 ≤x ≤5}.

Set Theory
35
Deﬁnition 2.2.14
Let A,B be sets. We say that A and B are disjoint iff
A∩B = φ.
Example 2.2.15
Let A = {x ∈N : x is an odd number} and B = {x ∈N : x is an even number}.
Since A∩B = φ, then A and B are disjoint. But A∩N ̸= φ, thus A and N are not
disjoint.
Theorem 2.2.16
Let A and B be sets. Then
(a) A∩B ⊆A and A∩B ⊆B,
(b) A ⊆B ⇔A∩B = A.
Proof
(a) To prove A∩B ⊆A, let x ∈A∩B. Then
x ∈A∩B ⇒x ∈A∧x ∈B
⇒x ∈A.
So, A∩B ⊆A
By the same manner, we prove that A∩B ⊆B.
(b) Assume that A ⊆B and let x ∈A. Then
x ∈A ⇒x ∈B.
Then x ∈A∧x ∈B.
That is
x ∈A ⇒x ∈A∧x ∈B
⇒x ∈A∩B.
Then A ⊆A∩B.
Since A∩B ⊆A (by part (a)), then A∩B = A.
Conversely, assume that A∩B = A. As A∩B ⊆B (by part (a)), then A ⊆B.
Theorem 2.2.17
Let A,B, and C be sets. Then
(a) A∩A = A (Idempotent law),
(b) A∩B = B∩A (Commutative law),
(c) A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C (Associative law).

36
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof
We prove (c) only, and leave (a), (c) as Exercise 3. Let x ∈A∩(B∩C).
Then
x ∈A∩(B∩C) ⇔x ∈A∧x ∈(B∩C)
⇔x ∈A∧(x ∈B∧x ∈C)
⇔(x ∈A∧x ∈B)∧x ∈C
⇔x ∈(A∩B)∧x ∈C
⇔x ∈(A∩B)∩C.
Thus A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C.
Theorem 2.2.18
Let A be a set. Then
(a) A∩φ = φ,
(b) A∩U = A, where U is the universal set.
Proof
(a) Since φ ⊆A, then φ ∩A = φ (by Theorem 2.2.16).
(b) Since A ⊆U, then A∩U = A (by Theorem 2.2.16).
Theorem 2.2.19 (Distributive law)
Let A,B, and C be sets. Then
(a) A∩(B∪C) = (A∩B)∪(A∩C),
(b) A∪(B∩C) = (A∪B)∩(A∪C).
Proof
(a) Let x ∈A∩(B∪C). Then
x ∈A∩(B∪C) ⇔x ∈A∧x ∈(B∪C)
⇔x ∈A∧(x ∈B∨x ∈C)
⇔(x ∈A∧x ∈B)∨(x ∈A∧x ∈C)
⇔x ∈(A∩B)∨x ∈(A∩C)
⇔x ∈(A∩B)∪(A∩C).
Therefore A∩(B∪C) = (A∩B)∪(A∩C).
(b) The proof is left as Exercise 4.

Set Theory
37
Theorem 2.2.20
Let A and B be sets. Then
(a) A ⊆B ⇔P(A) ⊆P(B),
(b) P(A)∩P(B) = P(A∩B),
(c) P(A)∪P(B) ⊇P(A∪B).
Proof
(a) Suppose A ⊆B and let X ∈P(A). Then
X ∈P(A) ⇒X ⊆A
⇒X ⊆B (since A ⊆B)
⇒X ∈P(B).
Thus P(A) ⊆P(B).
Conversely, suppose that P(A) ⊆P(B) and let x ∈A.
Then
x ∈A ⇒{x} ⊆A
⇒{x} ∈P(A)
⇒{x} ∈P(B) (since P(A) ⊆P(B))
⇒x ∈B.
Thus A ⊆B.
(b) Let X ∈P(A)∩P(B). Then
X ∈P(A)∩P(B) ⇒X ∈P(A)∧X ∈P(B)
⇒X ⊆A∧X ⊆B
⇒X ⊆A∩B
⇒X ∈P(A∩B).
Thus
P(A)∩P(B) ⊆P(A∩B).
(2.3)
Now, let X ∈P(A∩B). Then
X ∈P(A∩B) ⇒X ⊆A∩B
⇒X ⊆A∧X ⊆B
⇒X ∈P(A)∧X ∈P(B)
⇒X ∈P(A)∩P(B).
Thus
P(A∩B) ⊆P(A)∩P(B).
(2.4)
From (2.3) and (2.4), we conclude that P(A)∩P(B) = P(A∩B).
(c) The proof is left as Exercise 5.

COMPLEMENT OF SET
Deﬁnition 2.2.21
Let U be the universal set and A ⊆U. The set
AC = {x : x ∈U,x ∈A}
is said to be the complement of A.
Example 2.2.22
In the Venn diagram, we have shaded the complement of A;
that is the area outside of A.

40
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 2.2.23
Let the universal set U be Z and let A = {x : x ≤3}. Then
AC = {4,5,6,7,...}.
Example 2.2.24
Let the universal set U be N and let
A = {2,4,6,8,...}.
Then
AC = {1,3,5,7,...}.
Theorem 2.2.25
Let A and B be sets. Then
A ⊆B ⇒BC ⊆AC.
Proof
Since A ⊆B, then x ∈A ⇒x ∈B.
Thus x ̸∈B ⇒x ̸∈A.
That is, x ∈BC ⇒x ∈AC.
Hence BC ⊆AC.
Theorem 2.2.26
Let A be a set. Then
(AC)C = A.
Proof
It is clear that
x ∈(AC)C ⇔x ̸∈AC
⇔x ∈A.
Thus (AC)C = A.

Let A = N and let B = No. Then
A−B = Ne.

A−B = BC −AC.

(a) UC = φ,

Theorem 2.2.32 (De Morgan’s laws)
Let A and B be sets. Then
(a) (A∪B)C = AC ∩BC,
(b) (A∩B)C = AC ∪BC.
Proof
(a) We have
x ∈(A∪B)C ⇔x ̸∈A∪B
⇔x ̸∈A∧x ̸∈B
⇔x ∈AC ∧x ∈BC
⇔x ∈AC ∩BC.
Thus (A∪B)C = AC ∩BC.

Theorem 2.2.35
Let A and B be sets. Then
1. A∆φ = A,
2. A∆B = φ ⇔A = B.
Proof
(a)
A∆φ = (A−φ)∪(φ −A)
= A∪φ
= A.
(b) Suppose A∆B = φ.
Then
A∆B = φ ⇔(A−B)∪(B−A) = φ
⇔A−B = φ ∧B−A = φ
⇔A = B.
Remark 2.2.36
By using the laws of sets algebra, we can prove the properties of the sets without
using the deﬁnitions of ⊆,∩, and ∪.
Example 2.2.37
Prove that A∪(A∩B) = A.
Proof
A∩B ⊆A (by Theorem 2.2.16). Thus
A∪(A∩B) = A.
Example 2.2.38
Prove that A∩(A∪B) = A.
Proof
We have always A ⊆A∪B. Thus
A∩(A∪B) = A (by Theorem 2.2.16).
Example 2.2.39
Prove that A∩(AC ∪B) = A∩B.
Proof
A∩(AC ∪B) = (A∩AC)∪(A∩B)
= φ ∪(A∩B)
= A∩B.

Let I be a non-empty set. Suppose for each i ∈I there is a corresponding set Ai. Then
the family of sets
A = {Ai : i ∈I}
is an indexed family of sets. Each i ∈I is called an index, and I is called an indexing
set.
Example 2.3.2
Let I = N. For all k ∈N, let
Ak = {1,2,3,...,k}.
Then A1 = {1}, A2 = {1,2}, A3 = {1,2,3}, and so forth.
The set with index 12 is
A12 = {1,2,3,4,...,12}.

{3,6,9}, A4 = {4,8}, A5 = {5,6,10}. Then A = {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5} is an indexed
family of sets. Furthermore, such an indexed family of sets is denoted by

3 Relations
If x and y are integers, we might say that x is related to y when x is less than y. In this
chapter, we will study the idea of “is related to” by making the notion of a relation
precise.
3.1
ORDERED PAIRS AND CARTESIAN PRODUCT
The study of relations begins with the concept of an ordered pair.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1
An ordered pair consists of two elements, say a and b, in which one of them, say a, is
designated as the ﬁrst element and the other as the second element. An ordered pair
is denoted by (a,b).
Example 3.1.2
The ordered pairs (5, 6) and (6, 5) are different,
that is (5, 6) ̸= (6, 5).
Example 3.1.3
The set {5,6} is not an ordered pair since the elements 5 and 6 are not designated.
Remark 3.1.4
An ordered pair (a,b) can be deﬁned rigorously by
(a,b) ≡{a,{a,b}},
from this deﬁnition, the fundamental property of ordered pairs can be proven:
(a,b) = (c,d) ⇔a = c∧b = d.
Deﬁnition 3.1.5
Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B consists of all ordered pairs
(a,b), where a ∈A and b ∈B. It is denoted by
A× B,
which reads “A cross B”. More concisely,
A× B = {(a,b) : a ∈A,b ∈B}.
Example 3.1.6
Let A = {a,b} and B = {1,2,3}. Then
A× B = {(a,1),(a,2),(a,3),(b,1),(b,2),(b,3)}.

Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 3.1.7
Let C = {x,y}. Then
C ×C = {(x,x),(x,y),(y,x),(y,y)}.
Example 3.1.8
Let A = R the set of real numbers. Then
R× R = {(x,y) : x,y ∈R}.
The elements of R× R are the points of the xy-plane (Cartesian plane).
Remark 3.1.9
1. If the set A has n elements and the set B has m elements, then A × B has nm
elements.
2. The Cartesian product of two sets is not commutative, that is A× B ̸= B× A.
3. If A or B is empty set, then A× B = φ.
4. If either A or B is inﬁnite and the other is not empty, then A× B is inﬁnite.
The concept of the Cartesian product can be extended to more than two sets in a
natural way.
The Cartesian product of sets A,B, and C, denoted by
A× B×C,
consists of all ordered triples (a,b,c), where a ∈A, b ∈B, and c ∈C;
that is, A× B×C = {(a,b,c) : a ∈A,b ∈B, and c ∈C}.
Analogously, the Cartesian product of n sets
A1,A2,...,An
denoted by
A1 × A2 × ···× An,
consists of all ordered n-tuples (a1,a2,...,an), where
a1 ∈A1,a2 ∈A2,...,an ∈An,
that is, A1 × A2 × ···× An = {(a1,a2,...,an) : ai ∈Ai ∀i = 1,2,...,n}.
Example 3.1.10
Let A = {x,y}, B = {1,2,3}, and C = {a,b}. Then
A× B×C = {(x,1,a),(x,1,b),(x,2,a),(x,2,b),(x,3,a),(x,3,b),
(y,1,a),(y,1,b),(y,2,a),(y,2,b),(y,3,a),(y,3,b)}.

Relations

Example 3.1.11
If Ai = R, 1 ≤i ≤n. Then
A1 × A2 × ···× An = {(a1,a2,...,an) : ai ∈R,1 ≤i ≤n}
and is denoted by Rn.
Theorem 3.1.12
Let A and B be nonempty sets. Then
A× B = B× A iff A = B
Proof
Suppose A× B = B× A.
Let a ∈A, then
∀b ∈B, (a,b) ∈A× B
⇒(a,b) ∈B× A
⇒a ∈B∧b ∈A.
Hence a ∈A ⇒a ∈B, and
therefore, A ⊆B
Similarly we prove that B ⊆A.
Thus A = B.
Conversely, suppose that A = B.
It is clear that A× A = A× A.
Thus A× B = B× A.
Theorem 3.1.13
Let A,B, and C be sets. Then
(a) A× (B∩C) = (A× B)∩(A×C),
(b) A× (B∪C) = (A× B∪(A×C),
(c) (A× B)∩(C× D) = (A∩C)× (B∩D).
Proof
(a) Suppose (x,y) ∈A× (B∩C). Then
(x,y) ∈A× (B∩C) ⇔x ∈A∧y ∈(B∩C)
⇔x ∈A∧[y ∈B∧y ∈C]
⇔(x ∈A∧y ∈B)∧(x ∈A∧y ∈C)
⇔(x,y) ∈A× B∧(x,y) ∈A×C
⇔(x,y) ∈(A× B)∩(A×C).
(b) See Exercise 1.

(c) It is obvious that
(x,y) ∈(A× B)∩(C× D) ⇒(x,y) ∈A× B∧(x,y) ∈C × D
⇒(x ∈A∧y ∈B)∧(x ∈C ∧y ∈D)
⇒(x ∈A∧x ∈C)∧(y ∈B∧y ∈D)
⇒x ∈(A∩C)∧y ∈(B∩D)
⇒(x,y) ∈(A∩C)× (B∩D).
Thus
(A× B)∩(C× D) ⊆(A∩C)× (B∩D)
(3.1)
Conversely,
(x,y) ∈(A∩C)× (B∩D) ⇒x ∈(A∩C)∧y ∈(B∩D)
⇒(x ∈A∧x ∈C)∧(y ∈B∧y ∈D)
⇒(x ∈A∧y ∈B)∧(x ∈C ∧y ∈D)
⇒(x,y) ∈A× B∧(x,y) ∈C × D
⇒(x,y) ∈(A× B)∩(C× D).
Thus
(A∩C)× (B∩D) ⊆(A× B)∩(C× D)

From Equations (3.1) and (3.2) we conclude that
(A× B)∩(C× D) = (A∩C)× (B∩D).

RELATIONS ON SETS
Deﬁnition 3.2.1
Let A and B be sets. Then any subset of A× B is called a relation from A to B.
If R is a relation from A to B, then
R ⊆A× B.
Subsets of A× A are called relations on A.
If R is a relation from A to B and (a,b) ∈R, we write aRb and we read “a is related
to b”. a ̸R b means that (a,b) ̸∈R.
Example 3.2.2
Let A = {1,5}, B = {2,4,6}, then
R = {(1,2),(1,6),(5,6)} is a relation from A to B.
We have 1R2,5R6. Also the following sets
S = {(2,1),(2,5),(6,1),(6,5)}
T = {(4,1)} are relations from B to A.
Example 3.2.3
Let X = {a,b,c,3}, Y = {1,2,5}, then
R = {(a,1),(b,1),(c,2),(3,2),(3,5)}
is a relation from X to Y. We have aR1,3R2, and 3R5. However, 3 ̸R 1 and b ̸R 2. The
sets
S = {(1,a),(2,3),(5,a)}
T = {(2,c)}
are relations from Y to X.
Example 3.2.4
Let R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x ≤y}. Then
(1,1) ∈R and (3,7) ∈R. But (3,2) ̸∈R, and (10,6) ̸∈R.
Example 3.2.5
Let X be a set. Then the set
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}
is a relation on the set P(X).
Example 3.2.6
Let A be the set of the lines in the xy-plane. The set
R = {(a,b) ∈A× A : a//b}
is a relation on A.

Relations
57
Example 3.2.7
Consider the relation R on the set N× N given by
R = {((a,b),(c,d)) ∈(N× N)× (N× N) : a + b = c+ d}.
Then (1,5)R(2,4) but (6,7) ̸R (4,10).
Remark 3.2.8
Since the relation is a set, then we can deﬁne union, intersection, and difference of
two relations.
For example, if R and S are relations from A to B, that is
R ⊆A× B and S ⊆A× B, then R∪S ⊆A× B,R∩S ⊆A× B,
and R−S ⊆A× B. Also R∪S, R∩S, and R−S are relations from A to B.
In symbols,
R∪S = {(x,y) ∈A× B : (x,y) ∈R∨(x,y) ∈S},
R∩S = {(x,y) ∈A× B : (x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈S},
R−S = {(x,y) ∈A× B : (x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ̸∈S}.
Example 3.2.9
Let
R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x+ y = 5},
S = {(x,y) ∈R× R : 2x−y = 4}.
Then
R∩S = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x+ y = 5 ∧2x−y = 4}
= {(3,2)}.
Deﬁnition 3.2.10
Let R be a relation from A to B, the domain of R, denoted by Dom(R), is
Dom(R) = {a ∈A : ∃b ∈B, such that (a,b) ∈R}.
The range of R, denoted by Rng(R), is
Rng(R) = {b ∈B : ∃a ∈A, such that (a,b) ∈R}.
Thus, the domain of R is the set of all ﬁrst coordinates of ordered pairs in R, and
the range of R is the set of all second coordinates. By deﬁnition, Dom(R) ⊆A and
Rng(R) ⊆B.

Example 3.2.11
Let A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {x,y,z}, and
R = {(1,x),(2,x),(2,z),(4,z)}.
Then
Dom(R) = {1,2,4},
and
Rng(R) = {x,z}.
Example 3.2.12
Let R be a relation on R deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x2}.
Then
Dom(R) = {x ∈R : ∃y ∈R, such that (x,y) ∈R}
= {x ∈R : ∃y ∈R, such that y = x2}.
Then Dom(R) = R and
Rng(R) = {y ∈R : ∃x ∈R, such that (x,y) ∈R}
= {y ∈R : ∃x ∈R, such that y = x2}.
Then,
Rng(R) = {y ∈R : y ≥0}.
Deﬁnition 3.2.13
Let R be a relation from A to B, then the inverse of R is
R−1 = {(y,x) : (x,y) ∈R}.
Example 3.2.14
Let R = {(1,b),(1,c),(3,c)}. Then
R−1 = {(b,1),(c,1),(c,3)}.
Example 3.2.15
Let R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x ≤y}. Then
R−1 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x ≥y}.
Example 3.2.16
Let S be a relation on A = N∪{0}, deﬁned by
S = {(a,b) ∈A× A : a = 0}
= {(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),...}.

Relations
59
Then
S−1 = {(x,y) ∈A× A : y = 0}
= {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),...}.
Example 3.2.17
Let T be a relation on R, deﬁned by
T = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x2}.
Then
T −1 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x = y2}.
Theorem 3.2.18
Let R be a relation on A. Then
(R−1)−1 = R.
Proof
Let (x,y) ∈(R−1)−1, then
(x,y) ∈(R−1)−1 ⇒(y,x) ∈R−1
⇒(x,y) ∈R.
Thus
(R−1)−1 ⊆R
(3.3)
Now, let (x,y) ∈R. Then
(x,y) ∈R ⇒(y,x) ∈R−1
⇒(x,y) ∈(R−1)−1.
Hence
R ⊆(R−1)−1
(3.4)
From Equations (3.3) and (3.4), we conclude that
(R−1)−1 = R.
Theorem 3.2.19
If R is a relation from A to B, then
(a) Dom(R) = Rng(R−1),
(b) Rng(R) = Dom(R−1).

60
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof
(a) We have
x ∈Dom(R) ⇒∃y ∈B such that (x,y) ∈R
⇒∃y ∈B such that (y,x) ∈R−1
⇒x ∈Rng(R−1).
Then
Dom(R) ⊆Rng(R−1)
(3.5)
Now, let x ∈Rng(R−1). Then
x ∈Rng(R−1) ⇒∃y ∈B, such that (y,x) ∈R−1
⇒y ∈B, such that (x,y) ∈R
⇒x ∈Dom(R).
Thus,
Rng(R−1) ⊆Dom(R)
(3.6)
From Equations (3.5) and (3.6), we deduce that
Dom(R) = Rng(R−1).
(b) See Exercise 1.
Deﬁnition 3.2.20
Let R be a relation from A to B and let
C ⊆A,D ⊆B. Then the set R∩(C × D) is
called restriction of relation R from C to D.
Remark 3.2.21
If R is a relation on A and C = D, then
R∩(C ×C) is called restriction of R on C,
denoted by R|C.
Example 3.2.22
Let A = {x ∈N : x is even},
B = {x ∈N : x is odd},
C = {2,4,6},
and
D = {1,3,5}.

Relations
61
If R is a relation from A to B, deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) : x ∈A∧y ∈B, such that y|x},
then the restriction of R from C to D is the set
R∩(C × D) = {(2,1),(4,1),(6,1),(6,3)}.
Example 3.2.23
Let
A = {x ∈Z : −16 ≤x ≤16},
B = {x ∈N : x ≤16}.
If R is a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : y = x2 + 1},
then R|B = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,5),(3,10)}.
Deﬁnition 3.2.24
If R is a relation from A to B and S is a relation from B to C, then the composite of R
and S, denoted by S ◦R, is deﬁned by
S ◦R = {(x,z) : ∃y ∈B, such that (x,y) ∈R and (y,z) ∈S}.
Since S ◦R ⊆A×C, then S ◦R is a relation from A to C.
Example 3.2.25 Let A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {x,y,z,w}, and C = {a,b,c}.
Let R be a relation from A to B, deﬁned by
R = {(1,x),(1,y),(2,y),(3,z),(4,w)},
and S a relation from B to C, deﬁned by
S = {(x,a),(y,a),(y,b),(w,c)}.

Example 3.2.26 Let
R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x+ 1},
S = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x2}.
Then
R◦S = {(x,y) : ∃z ∈R, such that (x,z) ∈S ∧(z,y) ∈R}
= {(x,y) : z = x2 ∧y = z+ 1}
= {(x,y) : y = x2 + 1},
and
S ◦R = {(x,y) : ∃z ∈R, such that (x,z) ∈R∧(z,y) ∈S}
= {(x,y) : z = x+ 1 ∧y = z2}
= {(x,y) : y = (x+ 1)2}.
Clearly, S ◦R ̸= R◦S.
Theorem 3.2.27 Let R be a relation on A. Then
IA ◦R = R◦IA = R,
where IA is the identity relation on A, that is
IA = {(x,x) : x ∈A}.
Proof We have
(x,y) ∈IA ◦R ⇒∃z ∈A, such that (x,z) ∈R∧(z,y) ∈IA.
Since (z,y) ∈IA, then z = y. Thus (x,z) ∈R ⇒(x,y) ∈R.
Hence
IA ◦R ⊆R
(3.7)
Now, let (x,y) ∈R. Since
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,y) ∈IA,
then (x,y) ∈IA ◦R. Thus
R ⊆IA ◦R
(3.8)
From Equations (3.7) and (3.8), we conclude that IA ◦R = R.
Analogously, we prove that R◦IA = R.

Relations
63
Theorem 3.2.28 Let R,S, and T be relations on a set A. Then
(a) (T ◦S)◦R = T ◦(S ◦R),
(b) (S ∪T)◦R = (S ◦R)∪(T ◦R),
(c) (S ∩T)◦R = (S ◦R)∪(T ◦R),
(d) If R ⊆S, then T ◦R ⊆T ◦S and
R◦T ⊆S ◦T,
(e) (S ◦R)∩T = φ ⇒(T ◦R−1)∩S = φ,
(f) (S ◦R)−1 = R−1 ◦S−1.
Proof (a) Suppose that (x,w) ∈(T ◦S)◦R.
Then ∃y, such that (x,y) ∈R∧(y,w) ∈T ◦S
and ∃z, such that (y,z) ∈S ∧(z,w) ∈T.
Since
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈S,
then (x,z) ∈S ◦R.
As (x,z) ∈S ◦R and (z,w) ∈T, then (x,w) ∈T ◦(S ◦R). Thus
(T ◦S)◦R ⊆T ◦(S ◦R).
(3.9)
By the same manner, we show that
T ◦(S ◦R) ⊆(T ◦S)◦R.
(3.10)
From Equations (3.9) and (3.10), we get
T ◦(S ◦R) = (T ◦S)◦R.
(b) See Exercise 2.
(c) See Exercise 2.
(d) See Exercise 2.
(e) Suppose that (S ◦R) ∩T ̸= φ. Then ∃(x,y) such that (x,y) ∈(S ◦R) ∩T; i.e.
(x,y) ∈S ◦R∧(x,y) ∈T.
Since (x,y) ∈S◦R, then ∃z such that (x,z) ∈R∧(z,y) ∈S. (x,z) ∈R ⇒(z,x) ∈R−1.
Then ((z,x) ∈R−1 ∧(x,y) ∈T) ⇒(z,y) ∈T ◦R−1. As (z,y) ∈S, then (z,y) ∈(T ◦
R−1)∩S, i.e., (T ◦R−1)∩S ̸= φ.
Analogously we prove that
(T ◦R−1)∩S ̸= φ ⇒(S ◦R)∩T ̸= φ.
Thus
(S ◦R)∩T = φ ⇔(T ◦R−1)∩S = φ.

3.3
TYPE OF RELATIONS
Deﬁnition 3.3.1 Let R be a relation on a set A. R is called reﬂexive relation if
(x,x) ∈R,∀x ∈A.
Example 3.3.2 Let A = {a,b,c,d} and let R be a relation on A, deﬁned by
R = {(a,a),(a,c),(b,b),(b,d),(c,c),(c,d),(d,d)}.
Then R is reﬂexive relation, since (a,a),(b,b),(c,c),(d,d) ∈R.
If T = {(a,a),(a,c),(b,d),(c,c),(d,d)} is a relation on A,
then T is not reﬂexive, since (b,b) ̸∈T.
Example 3.3.3 Let R1, R2, R3, and R4 be relations on N deﬁned as follows:
R1 = {(x,y) ∈N× N : x < y},
R2 = {(x,y) ∈N× N : x ≤y},
R3 = {(x,y) ∈N× N : y ̸= 0,y | x},
R4 = {(x,y) ∈N× N : x+ y = 5}.
The relations R2 and R3 are reﬂexive but R1 and R4 are not reﬂexive. Why?

Relations
67
Example 3.3.4 Let X be arbitrary set and let R1,R2 be two relations on P(X) deﬁned
as follows:
R1 = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B},
R2 = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A∩B = φ}.
R1 is reﬂexive, since A ⊆A, ∀A ∈P(X). But R2 is not reﬂexive, since A∩A = A ̸= φ.
Remark 3.3.5 If R is a reﬂexive relation on a set A, then the identity relation IA is a
subset of R. i.e.,
IA ⊆R.
Deﬁnition 3.3.6 Let R be a relation on a set A. R is called symmetric relation if
∀x,y ∈A,(x,y) ∈R ⇒(y,x) ∈R.
Example 3.3.7 Let A = {1,2,3,4} and let R be a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(1,3),(4,2),(2,4),(3,1)}.
Then R is symmetric.
Example 3.3.8 Let A = N−{0} and let R1, R2, and R3 be relations on A deﬁned by
R1 = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y},
R2 = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x+ y = 10},
R3 = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x+ 3y = 10}.
Then R2 is symmetric but R1 and R3 are not symmetric. Why?
Example 3.3.9 Let X be a nonempty set and let R1 and R2 be relations on P(X)
deﬁned by
R1 = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊂B},
R2 = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A = X −B}.
R1 is not but R2 is symmetric.
Theorem 3.3.10 Let R be a relation on a set A. Then R is symmetric iff
R = R−1.
Proof Suppose R is symmetric, then
(x,y) ∈R ⇒(y,x) ∈R ⇔(x,y) ∈R−1.
Thus R = R−1.
Conversely, suppose R = R−1, then
(x,y) ∈R ⇒(x,y) ∈R−1
⇒(y,x) ∈R.
Hence, R is symmetric.

Deﬁnition 3.3.11 Let R be a relation on a set A. R is called transitive relation if
∀x,y,z ∈A,[(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R] ⇒(x,z) ∈R.
Example 3.3.12 Let R be a relation on N deﬁned by
R = {(x,y)inN× N : x < y}.
R is transitive, since
x < y∧y < z ⇒x < z.
That is
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R ⇒(x,z) ∈R.
Example 3.3.13 Let A = {1,2,3}. Let R1,R2, and R3 be relations on A deﬁned by
R1 = {(1,2),(2,2)},
R2 = {(1,1)},
R3 = {(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(2,1),(1,1)}.
R1 and R2 are transitive. Why? But R3 is not transitive. Why?
Deﬁnition 3.3.14 Let R be a relation on a set A. R is called antisymmetric relation if
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,x) ∈R ⇒x = y.
Remark 3.3.15 The statement: “R is not symmetric” does not mean that R is anti-
symmetric.
Example 3.3.16 Let X be an arbitrary set and let R be a relation on P(X) deﬁned by
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}.
R is antisymmetric, since
A ⊆B∧B ⊆A ⇒A = B.
Example 3.3.17 Let T be a relation on N deﬁned by
T = {(x,y) ∈N× N : x ≤y}.
T is antisymmetric, since
x ≤y∧y ≤x ⇒x = y.
Example 3.3.18 Let A = {1,2,3,4}, and let R be a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(1,3),(3,1),(3,3),(3,2)}.
R is not antisymmetric, since (1, 3), (3, 1) ∈R, but 1 ̸= 3.

Relations
69
Theorem 3.3.19 Let R be a relation on a set A. Then R is antisymmetric iff
R∩R−1 = IA.
Proof Suppose that R is antisymmetric and let (x,y) ∈R∩R−1. Then
(x,y) ∈R∩R−1 ⇔(x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈R−1
⇔(x,y) ∈R∧(y,x) ∈R
⇔x = y(since R is antisymmetric)
⇔(x,y) ∈IA.
Thus R∩R−1 = IA.
Conversely, suppose that R∩R−1 = IA, and let
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,x) ∈R.
Then (x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈R−1. Hence (x,y) ∈R∩R−1. Therefore (x,y) ∈IA and thus
x = y. This proves that R is antisymmetric.

3.4
EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS AND EQUIVALENCE CLASSES
Deﬁnition 3.4.1 Let R be a relation on a set A. Then R is called an equivalence
relation iff R is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive.
Example 3.4.2 Let R1 and R2 be relations on R deﬁned by
R1 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x = y},
R2 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x < y}.
R1 is an equivalence relation on R, since
1. x = x, ∀x ∈R, that is (x,x) ∈R1, ∀x ∈R,
2. x = y ⇒y = x, that is (x,y) ∈R1 ⇒(y,x) ∈R1,
3. [x = y∧y = z] ⇒x = z, that is
[(x,y) ∈R1 ∧(y,z) ∈R1] ⇒(x,z) ∈R1.
Therefore R1 is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive on R.
Thus R1 is an equivalence relation on R.
But R2 is not an equivalence relation, since it is neither reﬂexive nor symmetric.
Example 3.4.3 Let X be a nonempty set and let S and T be relations on P(X) deﬁned
by
S = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A = B}
T = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}
S is an equivalence relation. Why? But T is not an equivalence relation. Why?
Example 3.4.4 Let A be the set of all the lines on a plane and let R and S be relations
on A deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x//y},
S = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x⌊y}.
R is an equivalence relation, but S is not. Why?

1. If (a,b) ∈A, then a + b = a + b. Therefore ((a,b),(a,b)) ∈R, ∀(a,b) ∈A.
Thus R is a reﬂexive relation.
2. If ((a,b),(c,d)) ∈R, then a + b = c+ d. But
a + b = c+ d ⇒c+ d = a + b.
Therefore ((c,d),(a,b)) ∈R. Thus R is a symmetric relation.
3. If ((a,b),(c,d)) ∈R∧((c,d),(e, f)) ∈R, then
a + b = c+ d ∧c+ d = e+ f;i.e.,a + b = e+ f.
Hence ((a,b),(e, f)) ∈R. Thus R is transitive relation.
Theorem 3.4.6 If R and S are equivalence relations on a set A. Then R ∩S is an
equivalence relation.
Proof
1. Since R and S are reﬂexive, then
∀x ∈A,(x,x) ∈R∧(x,x) ∈S.
Thus (x,x) ∈R∩S, ∀x ∈A. Hence R∩S is a reﬂexive relation on A.
2. Suppose (x,y) ∈R∩S, then
(x,y) ∈R∩S ⇒(x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈S
⇒(y,x) ∈R∧(y,x) ∈S (since R and S are symmetric)
⇒(y,x) ∈R∩S.
Thus R∩S is symmetric.
3. Suppose (x,y) ∈R∩S ∧(y,z) ∈R∩S, then
[(x,y) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈S]∧[(y,z) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈S].
That is [(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R]∧[(x,y) ∈S ∧(y,z) ∈S].
This implies (x,z) ∈R∧(x,z) ∈S, since R and S are transitive.
Hence, (x,z) ∈R ∩S. Thus, R ∩S is transitive relation. Therefore, R ∩S is an
equivalence relation.

Theorem 3.4.7 If R is an equivalence relation on a set A. Then
R◦R = R.
Proof Suppose that (x,z) ∈R◦R, then ∃y ∈A, such that
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R.
Since R is a transitive relation, then
(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R ⇒(x,z) ∈R.
Thus
R◦R ⊆R.
(3.11)
Now, suppose that (x,y) ∈R. Then (x,x) ∈R, since R is reﬂexive. Thus,
∃x ∈A, such that
(x,x) ∈R∧(x,y) ∈R.
This implies (x,y) ∈R◦R and hence
R ⊆R◦R.
(3.12)
From Equations (3.11) and (3.12), we conclude
R◦R = R.
Deﬁnition 3.4.8 Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and let a ∈A.
The equivalence class of a, determined by R, is the set
[a] = a/R = {b ∈A : (a,b) ∈R}.
Example 3.4.9 Let A = {1,2,3,4} and let R be a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1)}.
It is clear that R is an equivalence relation on A and the equivalence classes are
[1] = {x ∈A : (x,1) ∈R} = {1,3},
[2] = {x ∈A : (x,2) ∈R} = {2},
[3] = {x ∈A : (x,3) ∈R} = {1,3} = [1],
[4] = {x ∈A : (x,4) ∈R} = {4}.
Since [1] = [3], then the equivalence classes are
[1],[2],[4].

Theorem 3.4.10 (Properties of equivalence classes) Let R be an equivalence relation
on a set A and let (a,b) ∈A. Then
(a) a ∈[a],
(b) if b ∈[a], then [a] = [b],
(c) [a] = [b] iff (a,b) ∈R,
(d) if [a]∩[b] ̸= φ, then [a] = [b].
Proof (a) By deﬁnition of [a], we have
[a] = {x ∈A : (x,a) ∈R}.
Since R is a reﬂexive relation, then
(a,a) ∈R,∀a ∈A.
Thus a ∈[a].
(b) Suppose that b ∈[a] and let x ∈[b]. Then x ∈[b] ⇒(x,b) ∈R.
Since b ∈[a], then (b,a) ∈R. Hence
(x,b) ∈R∧(b,a) ∈R ⇒(x,a) ∈R (since R is transitive),
⇒x ∈[a].
Thus
[b] ⊆[a].
(3.13)
Now, suppose that y ∈[a]. Then
y ∈[a] ⇒(y,a) ∈R.
Hence
b ∈[a] ⇒(b,a) ∈R
⇒(a,b) ∈R,
since R is symmetric. Consequently
(y,a) ∈R∧(a,b) ∈R ⇒(y,b) ∈R
⇒y ∈[b],
since R is transitive. Therefore
[a] ⊆[b].
(3.14)
Thus, it follows from Equations (3.13) and (3.14) that
[a] = [b].
(c) Firstly, suppose that [a] = [b]. Then by part (a), we have
a ∈[a].

74
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Since [a] = [b], then
a ∈[a] ⇒a ∈[b]
⇒(a,b) ∈R.
Conversely, suppose that x ∈[a]. Then,
x ∈[a] ⇒(x,a) ∈R.
This implies (x,a) ∈R∧(a,b) ∈R. Hence,
(x,a) ∈R∧(a,b) ∈R ⇒(x,b) ∈R
⇒x ∈[b].
Thus,
[a] ⊆[b].
(3.15)
By the same manner, we prove that
[b] ⊆[a].
(3.16)
From Equations (3.15) and (3.16), we conclude
[a] = [b].
(d) Suppose that [a]∩[b] ̸= φ, and let x ∈[a]∩[b]. Then
x ∈[a]∩[b] ⇒x ∈[a]∧x ∈[b]
⇒(x,a) ∈R∧(x,b) ∈R
⇒(x,b) ∈R∧(x,a) ∈R
⇒(b,x) ∈R∧(x,a) ∈R(since R is symmetric)
⇒(b,a) ∈R(since R is transitive)
⇒(a,b) ∈R(since R is symmetric)
⇒[a] = [b](see part (c))
Deﬁnition 3.4.11 Let {Ai}i∈I be a family of nonempty subsets of A. Then {Ai}i∈I is
called partition of A iff
1. ∀i, j ∈I,Ai ∩A j = φ ∧Ai = A j.
2. A =
[
i∈I
Ai.
Example 3.4.12 Let A = Z and let X = Ze and Y = Zo. It is clear that X and Y are
nonempty subsets of A and X ∩Y = φ, also A = X ∪Y. Therefore, the set {X,Y} is a
partition of A.
Theorem 3.4.13 Let R be an equivalence relation on a set A and let {[a]}a∈A be the
family of all the equivalence classes of R in A. Then {[a]}a∈A is a partition of A.

Relations
75
Proof It is clear that [a] ⊆A, ∀a ∈A. Since R is a reﬂexive relation, then (a,a) ∈R
and a ∈[a] (by Theorem 3.4.10 part (a)). Thus [a] ̸= φ, ∀a ∈A.
Now, suppose that ∃a,b ∈A, such that [a]∩[b] ̸= φ. Then [a] = [b] (by Theorem
3.4.10 part (d)).
Finally, we must show that A =
[
a∈A
[a].
Suppose that x ∈A, then x ∈[x] (by Theorem 3.4.10 part (a)). Thus,
x ∈
[
a∈A
[a], that is A ⊆
[
a∈A
[a] and it is clear that
[
a∈A
[a] ⊆A.
Thus, A =
[
a∈A
[a]. Hence, {[a]}a∈A is a partition of A.
Theorem 3.4.14 If A is a nonempty set and {Ai}i∈I is a partition of A, then there
exists an equivalence relation R on A, such that {Ai}i∈I are the equivalence classes
of R.
Proof Let R be a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : ∃Ai, such that x,y ∈Ai}.
Below we show that R is an equivalence relation.
1. Let x ∈A. Since {Ai}i∈I is a partition of A, then
A =
[
i∈I
Ai.
So, ∃Ai, such that x ∈Ai. Then
x ∈Ai ∧x ∈Ai ⇒(x,x) ∈R.
Thus R is a reﬂexive relation.
2. Suppose that (x,y) ∈R. Then ∃Ai, such that x,y ∈Ai. That is ∃Ai, y ∈Ai ∧x ∈
Ai. Hence (y,x) ∈R. Hence R is symmetric.
3. Suppose that (x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R. Then ∃Ai,A j, such that x,y ∈Ai ∧y, z ∈A j.
Thus y ∈Ai ∩A j. Hence Ai ∩A j ̸= φ, and {Ai}i∈I is a partition of the set A.
Consequently Ai = A j.
So, ∃Ai, such that x ∈Ai ∧z ∈Ai and from the deﬁnition of R, we have (x,z) ∈
R. Therefore, R is a transitive relation.
Thus R is an equivalence relation.
Now, we show that every subset Ai in {Ai}i∈I is an equivalence class for R. As Ai ̸= φ,
∀i ∈I, then Ai has at least one element x, so [x] is an equivalence class for R.
We claim that Ai = [x]. Suppose that y ∈[x]. Then (y,x) ∈R, and since x ∈Ai,
then by deﬁnition of R, y ∈Ai. That is
y ∈[x] ⇒y ∈Ai.

76
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Then
z ∈Ai ∧x ∈Ai
⇒(z,x) ∈R
⇒z ∈[x].
Consequently,
z ∈Ai ⇒z ∈[x],
that is Ai ⊆[x]. Hence Ai = [x].
Example 3.4.15 Let A = {1,3,5,7,9}, X = {1,3}, Y = {5,7}, and Z = {9}. Then
by Theorem 4.2.47, there exists an equivalence relation R, such that the equivalence
classes of R form the partition {X,Y,Z}.
The relation R is
R = IA ∪{(1,3),(3,1),(5,7),(7,5)}.
It is easy to prove the following properties:
1. The set {X,Y,Z} is a partition of the set A.
2. R is an equivalence relation on A.
The equivalence classes of R are
[1] = [3],[5] = [7],[9].
We note that
X = [1] = [3],
Y = [5] = [7],
Z = [9].
Example 3.4.16 Let A = Z, X = Ze, and Y = Zo. The set {X,Y} is a partition of A.
Consider
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : (x−y) is an even integer}.
The relation R is an equivalence relation on A and the equivalence classes of R in A
are
[0] and [1], where X = [0],Y = [1].

CONGRUENCE
Deﬁnition 3.5.1 Let n be a positive integer. If a and b are integers, we say that a is
congruent to b modulo n, and we write
a ≡b (mod n) ⇔n divides (a −b).
Thus “≡” deﬁnes a relation on Z.
For example,
21 ≡1 (mod 5)

Relations
77
because 5 | (21 −1). Likewise,
35 ≡−7 (mod 6)
19 ≡82 (mod 9).
On the other hand, 67 ≡5 (mod 11) is false, since
11 | (67 −5).
If a ≡b (mod n) is false, then we write
a ≡b (mod n).
Thus 67 ≡5 (mod 11) and −17 ≡2 (mod 4).
Theorem 3.5.2 For a ﬁxed positive integer n, the relation of congruence modulo n
is an equivalence relation on Z.
Proof
1. As
n | 0 ⇒n | (a −a)
⇒a ≡a (mod n),
then ≡is a reﬂexive relation on Z.
2. As
a ≡b (mod n) ⇔n | (a −b)
⇔n | −(b −a)
⇔n | (b −a).
then b ≡a (mod n). Thus ≡is a symmetric relation on Z.
3. We show that ≡is transitive. Suppose
a ≡b (mod n)∧b ≡c (mod n).
Then n | (a −b)∧n | (b −c).
Therefore, there exists integers r,s, such that
a −b = rn ∧b −c = sn.
Then a −c = (r + s)n, where r + s is an integer. Thus n | (a −c), so a ≡
c (mod n). Therefore ≡is a transitive relation on Z. As ≡is reﬂexive, sym-
metric, and transitive relation on Z, then ≡is an equivalence relation on Z.

By the preceding theorem, congruence (modulo n) divides Z into equivalence classes
for any ﬁxed positive integer n. For example, if n = 3, then
[7] = {x ∈Z : x ≡7 (mod 3)}
= {x ∈Z : 3 | (x−7)}
= {x ∈Z : x−7 = 3k, k ∈Z}
= {x ∈Z : x = 7 + 3k, k ∈Z}
= {...,−2,1,4,7,10,13,16,19,...}.
By the same computation, we ﬁnd
[1] = {...,−2,1,4,7,10,13,16,19,...}.
Thus [1] = [7]. Likewise
[0] = [3] = [6] = [9] = ...
We see that the equivalence relation congruence (modulo 3) divides Z into exactly 3
distinct equivalence classes, namely [0],[1], and [2]. A similar result is true in general.
Theorem 3.5.3 If n is a positive integer, then congruence (modulo n) divides Z into
exactly n distinct equivalence classes, namely
[0],[1],[2],...,[n −1].
In fact, if r is an integer with 0 ≤r < n, then x ∈[r] iff r is the remainder when x is
divided by n using the division algorithm.
Proof Let x = nq + r, 0 ≤r < n. Then
x−r = nq, and so n | (x−r).
Thus
x ≡r (mod n), and so x ∈[r].
Conversely, let x ∈[r], where 0 ≤r < n. Then
x ≡r (mod n) and so n | (x−r).
Let x−r = nk, k ∈Z. Then
x = nk + r, 0 ≤r < n.
By the uniqueness of the quotient and the remainder in the division algorithm, r must
be the remainder, when x is divided by n.
Theorem 3.5.4 Suppose that a,b,c,d, and n, are integers with n > 1. If
a ≡b (mod n) and c ≡d (mod n),
then
(a) a + c ≡b + d (mod n),
(b) ac ≡bd (mod n).

Relations
79
Proof
(a) As
a ≡b (mod n) ⇔a = b + sn, s ∈Z
and
c ≡d (mod n) ⇔c = d +tn, t ∈Z
⇔a + c = b + d + (s+t)n
⇔a + c = b + d + kn, k ∈Z,
then a + c ≡b + d (mod n).
(b) By hypothesis, we have
a ≡b (mod n) ⇒n | (a −b)
and
c ≡d (mod n) ⇒n | (c−d).
Then
n | (a −b)c+ (c−d)b;i.e.,n | ac−bd.
This means that ac ≡bd (mod n).
Example 3.5.5 Suppose that a ≡2 (mod 7) and b ≡5 (mod 7). We will determine
the remainder, when 45a + b is divided by 7.
For this purpose, we write
45 = 7.6 + 3; i.e.,45 ≡3 (mod 7),
and
a ≡2 (mod 7).
Multiplying these congruence’s, we obtain
45a ≡6(mod 7).
Adding b ≡5 (mod 7) to the latter congruence, we get
45a + b ≡11 (mod 7).
Hence
45a + b ∈[11] = [4].

PARTIAL AND TOTAL ORDERED RELATIONS
Deﬁnition 3.6.1 Let R be a relation on a set A. Then R is called a partial order (or
partial ordering) relation for A if R is reﬂexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. The set
A is called a partially ordered set, or poset.

Example 3.6.2 Let R be a relation on Z deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈Z× Z : x ≤y},
R is a partial order relation on Z. Why ?
Example 3.6.3 Let S be a relation on Z deﬁned by
S = {(x,y) ∈Z× Z : 3 | (x−y),
S is not a partial order relation on Z, because S is not antisymmetric. For example,
(8,2) ∈S ∧(2,8) ∈S, but 2 ̸= 8.
Example 3.6.4 Let X be a nonempty set and R be a relation on P(X) deﬁned by
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B},
R is a partial order relation on P(X).
Remark 3.6.5 Let < be the usual “strict” inequality on the natural numbers (or, in-
tegers, or rational numbers, or real numbers). Then it is not a partial ordering because
it is not reﬂexive.
Example 3.6.6 Let S be a relation on R deﬁned by
S = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x < y}.
Then this relation S is not a partial ordering on R.
Theorem 3.6.7 If R is a partial order relation on a set A, then R−1 is a partial order
relation on A.
Proof
1. Since R is reﬂexive; i.e., (x,x) ∈R, ∀x ∈A, then
∀x ∈A,(x,x) ∈R ⇒(x,x) ∈R−1.
Thus R−1 is reﬂexive.
2. Since R is antisymmetric; i.e.,
∀x,y ∈A,(x,y) ∈R∧(y,x) ∈R ⇒x = y,
then
∀x,y ∈A,(y,x) ∈R−1 ∧(x,y) ∈R−1 ⇒x = y.
Thus R−1 is antisymmetric.

Relations
85
3. Since R is transitive; i.e.,
∀x,y,z ∈A,(x,y) ∈R∧(y,z) ∈R ⇒(x,z) ∈R,
then
∀x,y,z ∈A,(y,x) ∈R−1 ∧(z,y) ∈R−1 ⇒(z,x) ∈R−1
Thus R−1 is transitive.
As R−1 is reﬂexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, then R−1 is a partial order
relation on A.
Theorem 3.6.8 Let R be a relation on a set A. Then R is a partial order relation on A
iff R∩R−1 = IA ∧R◦R = R.
Proof Suppose that R ∩R−1 = IA ∧R ◦R = R. We prove that R is a partial order
relation. First we see that
∀a ∈A,(a,a) ∈IA,
by deﬁnition of IA. Then
∀a ∈A,(a,a) ∈R∩R−1.
That is, ∀a ∈A, (a,a) ∈R.
Thus R is reﬂexive relation.
Now, suppose (a,b) ∈R∧(b,a) ∈R, but (a,b) ∈R ⇒(b,a) ∈R−1.
Then
(b,a) ∈R∩R−1 = IA;i.e.,(b,a) ∈IA.
Hence a = b. This implies that R is symmetric.
Finally, suppose (a,b) ∈R∧(b,c) ∈R. Since R◦R = R, then
(a,b) ∈R◦R∧(b,c) ∈R◦R ⇒∃x ∈A
such that
(a,x) ∈R∧(x,b) ∈R,
and ∃y ∈A such that
(b,y) ∈R∧(y,c) ∈R.
Then
(a,b) ∈R∧(b,y) ∈R ⇒(a,y) ∈R◦R
⇒(a,y) ∈R,
and
(a,y) ∈R∧(y,c) ∈R ⇒(a,c) ∈R◦R
⇒(a,c) ∈R.

That is,
(a,b) ∈R∧(b,c) ∈R ⇒(a,c) ∈R.
Then R is transitive.
As R is reﬂexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, then R is a partial order relation
on A.
Necessity (see Exercise 1).
Deﬁnition 3.6.9 Let A be a partially ordered set by the partial order relation R and
let (a,b) ∈A, such that aRb. We can express that by one of the following diagrams,
called Hasse diagram.
Example 3.6.10 Let A = {1,3,5,12} and R = {(x,y) ∈A×A : x ≤y}. It is clear that
R is a partial order relation on A. The Hasse diagram of the partial order relation R is
Example 3.6.11 Let A = {2,6,20,15} and let R = {(x,y) ∈A×A : x | y}. Then R is
a partial order relation on A. The Hasse diagram of R is
Example 3.6.12 Let A = {1,2,3}. Let R be a relation on P(A) deﬁned by

Deﬁnition 3.6.13 Let A be a partially ordered set by the relation R. The element
b ∈A is called the least element of A if and only if
bRx,∀x ∈A.
Example 3.6.14 Let A = {3,6,9,12,15} and let R,S, and T, be relations on A de-
ﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≤y},
S = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≥y},
T = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y}.
It is clear that R,S, and T are partial order relations.
The element 3 is the least element for A associated to R, since
3 ≤x,∀x ∈A.
The element 15 is the least element for A associated to S, since
15 ≥x,∀x ∈A.
The element 3 is the least element for A associated to T, since
3 | x,∀x ∈A.
Example 3.6.15 Let X be any set and let R be a relation on P(X) deﬁned by
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}.
It is clear that R is a partial order relation on P(X).
The empty set φ is the least element for P(X) associated to R, since
φ ⊆A,∀A ∈P(X).
Theorem 3.6.16 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. If A has a least element,
then it is unique.
Proof Suppose R has two least elements b and c. Then
bRc∧cRb,
by deﬁnition of least element. Since R is antisymmetric, then
bRc∧cRb ⇒b = c.
Thus the least element, if exist, is unique.
Deﬁnition 3.6.17 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. The element a ∈A is
called greatest element of A associated to R if and only if
xRa,∀x ∈A.

Example 3.6.18 Let A = {3,5,6,9,10,12,13}, and let G,H, and K be relations on
A deﬁned by
G = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≤y},
H = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≥y},
K = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y}.
The relations G,H, and K are partial order relations on A. The number 13 is the
greatest element for A associated to G, since
x ≤13,∀x ∈A.
The number 3 is the greatest element for A associated to H, since
x ≥3,∀x ∈A.
But there does not exist the greatest element associated to K, because there does not
exist an element a ∈A that divides by each element of A.
Example 3.6.19 Let X be an arbitrary set, and let R be a relation on P(X) deﬁned
by
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}.
R is a partial order relation on P(X). Since A ⊆X, ∀A ∈P(X), then X is the greatest
element for P(X) associated to R.
Theorem 3.6.20 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. If A has a greatest
element, then it is unique.
Proof Suppose that A has two greatest elements a and b. Then aRb ∧bRa, by deﬁ-
nition of the greatest element.
Hence
aRb ∧bRa ⇒a = b,
since R is antisymmetric.
Thus the greatest element, if exist, is unique.
Deﬁnition 3.6.21 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. The element m ∈A is
called maximal element of A associated to R if there does not exist x ∈A, such that
mRx and m ̸= x.
Example 3.6.22 Let A = {3,6,7,12,13,15,18} and let R,S, and T be relations on A
deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≥y},

The relations R,S, and T are partial order relations on A. The number 3 is maximal
element for A associated to R, since there does not exist x ∈A such that
3 ≥x and 3 ̸= x.
The number 18 is the maximal element for A associated to S, since there does not
exist x ∈A, such that
18 ≤x and 18 ̸= x.
The number 7 is a maximal element for A associated to T, since there does not exist
x ∈A, such that
7 | x and 7 ̸= x.
Also 12, 13, 15, and 18 are maximal elements associated to T.
Example 3.6.23 Let X = {1,3,5,6,7} and E = {{1,3},{5,7},{1,3,5},{1,3,7},
X}. Let G and H be relations on E deﬁned by
G = {(A,B) ∈E × E : A ⊆B},
H = {(A,B) ∈E × E : A ⊇B}.
The relations G and H are partial order relations on E. The set X is the maximal
element for E associated to G. The set {5,7} is a maximal element for E associated
to H, since there does not exist B ∈E, such that
{5,7} ⊇B and {5,7} ̸= B.
Deﬁnition 3.6.24 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. The element n ∈A is
called minimal element of A associated to R if there does not exist an element x ∈A,
such that xRn and x ̸= n.
Example 3.6.25 Let A = {3,5,9} and let R,S, and T be relations on A deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≥y},
S = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≤y},
T = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y}.
R,S, and T are partial order relations on A. The number 3 is the minimal element of
A associated to R. The number 9 is the minimal element of A associated to S. Both
the numbers 5 and 7 are minimal elements for A associated to T.
Example 3.6.26 Let
X = {a,b,c,d},

R and S are partial order relations on E. Both {a,b} and {b,d} are minimal elements
of E associated to R. X is the minimal element of E associated to S.
Deﬁnition 3.6.27 Let A be a partially ordered set with respect to the relation ≤, and
let B be a subset of A. An element a ∈A is called upper bound of B in A if
∀x ∈B,a ≥x(xRa,∀x ∈B).
In this case, we say that B is bounded above. An element a ∈A is called lower bound
of B in A if
∀x ∈B,a ≤x(aRx,∀x ∈B).
In this case, we say that B is bounded below.
Example 3.6.28 Let R be a relation on R deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x ≤y},
and let B = [2,3]. The number 5 ∈R is an upper bound of B. The number 1 ∈R is a
lower bound of B.
Example 3.6.29 Let A = {5,3,10,12,30} and let R be a relation on A deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y},
and let B = {5,10}. The number 30 ∈A is an upper bound of B. The number 5 ∈A
is a lower bound of B.
Deﬁnition 3.6.30 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A and let B be a subset of
A. The element x ∈A is called a least upper bound (or supremum) of B if
x is an upper bound of B and
xRy, for every upper bound y of B.
We write Sup(B) (or LUB(B)) to denote the supremum of B.
Deﬁnition 3.6.31 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A and let B be a subset of
A. The element x ∈A is called a greatest lower bound (or inﬁmum) of B if
x is a lower bound of B, and
yRx, for every lower bound y of B.
We write Inf(B) (or GLB(B)) to denote the inﬁmum of B.
Example 3.6.32 Let T be a relation on R deﬁned by
T = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x ≤y},
and let B = [−1,5]. It is clear that T is a partial order relation on R. Then Sup(B) = 5
and Inf(B) = −1.

Remark 3.6.33 Let ≤be a partial order relation on a set A, and let B be a subset of
A. Then the following assertion hold.
1. If Sup(B) exists, it is unique, and if Inf(B) exists, it is unique.
2. b is an upper bound of B associated to the relation ≤iff b is a lower bound of
B associated to the relation ≥.
3. b = Sup(B) associated to ≤iff b = Inf(B) associated to ≥.
Deﬁnition 3.6.34 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. A is said to be a lattice
if and only if for any elements (a,b) ∈A, In f{a,b}, and Sup{a,b} exist.
Deﬁnition 3.6.35 Let ≤be a partial order relation on a set A. If x,y ∈A, we say that
x,y are comparable if
x ≤y or y ≤x.
Otherwise x,y are incomparable.
Example 3.6.36 Let R be a relation on the set Z deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈Z× Z : x ≤y}.
It is clear that R is a partial order relation on Z. Any pair of numbers x,y ∈Z are
comparable because either
x ≤y or y ≤x.
Example 3.6.37 Let R be a relation on A = Z+ deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x | y}.
R is a partial order set on A. It is not necessary that any pair x,y ∈A are comparable.
For example 3,5 ∈A, but 3 ∤5 and 5 ∤3.
Example 3.6.38 Let X = {1,2,3} and let R be a relation on P(X) deﬁned by
R = {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(X) : A ⊆B}.
R is a partial order relation on P(X). It is not necessary that any pair of subsets A,B
are comparable. For example, if A = {1}, B = {5}, we see that A ̸⊆B, B ̸⊆A.
Deﬁnition 3.6.39 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A, and let B be a subset
of A.B is called a totally ordered subset (or B is a chain in A) if any pair of elements
(a,b) ∈B are comparable, i.e., aRb or bRa.
If any pair of elements (a,b) ∈A are comparable, A is called totally ordered set.
Example 3.6.40 The set Z is a totally ordered set with the relation ≤.

Example 3.6.41 Let
A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},
B = {2,4,8},
and
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : y | x}.
The set A is not totally ordered set, but B is a totally ordered set.
Example 3.6.42 Let A,B be totally ordered sets with the relations R and S, respec-
tively. Then the Cartesian product A × B can be totally ordered by the relation T as
follows:
(a,c)T(b,d) if and only if aRb, a,b ∈A,
or
a = b,cSd,c,d ∈B.
This order is called lexicographical order of A × B. For example, let A = {1,3,5},
B = {2,4} and let
R = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x ≤y},
S = {(x,y) ∈B× B : x | y}.
It is clear that R and S are total order relations on A and on B, respectively. Suppose
T is the lexicographical order of
A× B = {(1,2),(1,4),(3,4),(3,2),(5,2),(5,4)}.
See that (1,2)T(1,4), since 1 = 1 and 2 | 4. Also (1,2)T(3,2), since 1 < 3. The fol-
lowing graph explains (A× B,R× S):
Theorem 3.6.43 Let R be a total order relation on a set A. Then A has at most one
minimal element, which is the least element of A. Also A has at most one maximal
element, which is the greatest element of A.
Proof Assume that a1,a2 are maximal elements with a1 ̸= a2. Then there does not
exist x ∈A, such that
xRa1 and x ̸= a1.

Relations
93
Also there does not exist x ∈A, such that
xRa2 and x ̸= a2.
As A is the totally ordered set, then a1Ra2 or a2Ra1. This contradicts that a1 ̸= a2.
Thus a1 = a2.
Now, we prove that a1 is the least element of A, that is a1Rx, ∀x ∈A.
Suppose there exists x ∈A, such that a1R̸ x. Then xRa1, since A is the totally ordered
set. But this contradicts that a1 is the least element, thus a1 is the least element of A.
The proof of the second part is left as Exercise 2.
Deﬁnition 3.6.44 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A. Set A is said to be
well-ordered set if and only if arbitrary nonempty subset of A has a least element.
Theorem 3.6.45 Every well-ordered set is totally ordered.
Proof Let A be a well-ordered set and x,y ∈A. Let
B = {x,y} ⊆A.
Then B has a least element x or y. So, for any two elements x,y ∈A, we have that x,y
are comparable. Thus A is totally ordered.
Example 3.6.46 Let A = {2,3,4,5,6} and R = {(x,y) ∈A×A : x ≤y}. Thus the set
A is well-ordered.
Example 3.6.47 Let A = N and R = {(x,y) ∈N×N : x ≤y}. Thus N is well-ordered.
Example 3.6.48 The set of integers Z, with the total order relation ≤, is not well-
ordered, since the subset
A = {...,−2,−1,0} ⊂Z
has not a least element.
Theorem 3.6.49 If A is a well-ordered set, then ∀a ∈A (except the greatest element)
has an immediate successor.
Proof Let
T = {y ∈A : y > a}.
T is not empty subset of A, why?
Then T has a least element, say b. Thus b is the immediate successor of a.
Deﬁnition 3.6.50 Let R be a partial order relation on a set A, and let B ⊆A. B is
called a section of A if
∀x ∈A,(y ∈B,xRy) ⇒x ∈B.

Theorem 3.6.51 (Principal of transﬁnite induction) Let A be a well-ordered set and
P(x) is an open sentence on A.
Then
[P(y) is true ∀y < x ⇒P(x) is true] ⇒P(x) is true ∀x ∈A.
Proof Suppose P(x) is not true for all x ∈A. We deﬁne the set
T = {y ∈A : P(x) is false}.
As T is a subset of A, then T has a least element, say m. Since P(x) is true ∀x < m,
then P(m) is true. But P(m) is false, since m is the least element of T such that P(m)
is false. Thus P(x) is true ∀x ∈A.

4 Functions
The word “function” was ﬁrst used by G.W. Leibnitz in 1694. J. Bernoulli deﬁned a
function as “any expression including variables and constants” in 1698. The familiar
notation f(x) was ﬁrst used by L. Euler in 1734. We shall present in this chapter the
basic properties of functions and induced set functions.
4.1
FUNCTIONS
4.1.1
DOMAIN AND RANGE
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 Let A and B be sets and let f be a relation from A to B. f is said to
be a function if the following conditions hold:
1. ∀x ∈A, ∃y ∈B, such that (x,y) ∈f.
2. If (x,y) ∈f and (x,z) ∈f, then y = z.
By the above deﬁnition, a relation f is a function from A to B, if it is wholly deﬁned
on A, and it has a unique image in B for an arbitrarily ﬁxed element of A.
Example 4.1.2 Let
A = {1,3,5,7},
B = {2,4,6},
and let f be a relation deﬁned by
f = {(1,2),(3,4),(5,2),(7,6)}.
Then f is a function from A to B.
Example 4.1.3 Let
A = {1,3,5,9},
B = {3,7,11,16,19},
and let f be a relation from A to B deﬁned by
f = {(x,y) : y = 2x+ 1}.
It is clear that f is a function from A to B.
Example 4.1.4 Let
A = {1,3,5,9},
B = {3,7,11,16},

Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
and let
f = {(x,y) : y = 2x+ 1}.
Then f is not a function, since 9 ∈A, but there does not exist y ∈B, such that (9,y) ∈
f.
A function f from A to B is also called a mapping from A to B.
We write
f : A →B,
and this is read “f maps A to B” or “f is a function from A to B”. The set A is called
the domain of f, denoted by Dom(f). The set B is called the codomain of f, denoted
by codom(f).
Deﬁnition 4.1.5 Let f : A →B. If (x,y) ∈f, then we write y = f(x), and we say that
y is the value of f at x, or the image of x under f. In such a case, x is said to be the
pre mage of y under f.
Remark 4.1.6 One can use Venn diagram to clarify a function from A to B.
Example 4.1.7 Let
A = {a,b,c},
B = {2,1,−1},
We deﬁne the function f : A →B by
f = {(a,2),(b,2),(c,1)}.
The following diagram represents the function f:
A
a
b
c
B
–1
f
1
2
This diagram indeed indicates that the mapping f is wholly deﬁned on A, and each
element of A is uniquely assigned to be a single corresponding element of B, and
hence, it is a function.
Deﬁnition 4.1.8 For every functions f : A →B, we deﬁne the range Rng(f) of f by
the relation
Rng(f) = {y ∈B : ∃x ∈A, such that (x,y) ∈f}
= {y ∈B : ∃x ∈A, such that y = f(x)}.

Functions
99
By deﬁnition, the range Rng(f) is the set of all images of A under f. So, sometimes,
Rng(f) is also denoted by f(A).
Remark 4.1.9 If f : A →B is a function, then
Dom(f) = A and Rng(f) ⊆B.
Example 4.1.10 Let A = B = R and let
f = {(x,y) : y = x2}.
Then f is a function from A to B with
Rng(f) = {y ∈R : y ≥0}.
Example 4.1.11 Let
A = {0, 1
4, 1
2,1,2,3},
B = R,
and let f be a relation from A to B deﬁned by
f = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y =
(
x2,
if x is integer,
1/2,
if x is not integer.
Then f is a function from A to B and
Rng(f) = {0,1,4,9, 1
2},
Dom(f) = A.
4.1.2
GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
In this section, we study the graph of a function f : A →B, as a subset of the Cartesian
product set A× B of A and B.
Deﬁnition 4.1.12 Let f : A →B be a function from A to B. The set
G = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = f(x)}
is called the graph of the function f.
Remark 4.1.13 If f : A →B is a function having its graph G, then
G ⊆A× B, by the very deﬁnition, and
G = f, by regarding f as a relation.

Example 4.1.14 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = x2.
Then,
G = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x2}
= {(0,0),(1,1),(−1,1),(1
2, 1
4),(−1
2, 1
4),...}.
Example 4.1.15 Let
A = {1,3,4,5},
B = {3,7,9,11,13,15},
and let f : A →B be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = 2x+ 1.
The graph G of f is
G = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = 2x+ 1}
= {(1,3),(3,7),(4,9),(5,11)}.
Notion 4.1.16 Let A and B be sets. The set of all functions from A to B is denoted
by
BA.
Theorem 4.1.17 If A is a set containing m-many elements and B is a set containing
n-many elements, then BA has nm-many elements.
Proof Suppose
A = {x1,x2,...,xm} and
B = {y1,y2,...,yn}.
Any element of A is related to one element of B in n ways, that is
x1 is related to y1

or to yn.
So, every element of {x1,x2,...,xm} has n-different ways to be related to one element
of {y1,y2,...,yn}. Thus the number of the ways, making the m-many elements of A
related to n-many elements of B, is
n ·n ·n...n(m times) = nm.

ONE-TO-ONE FUNCTIONS AND ONTO FUNCTIONS
In this section, we study certain types of functions, categorized by ways of assign-
ments.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1 Let f : A →B be a function. We say that
“f is a function from A onto B”or “f maps A onto B”,
or “f is an onto function,”
if
Rng(f) = B.
In other words, “f is onto function” if and only if
∀y ∈B,∃x ∈A, such that y = f(x).
An onto function is also called a surjection.
Example 4.2.2 Let A = B = R and let
f = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = 5x+ 1}.
Then, the function f is onto. Indeed, for all y ∈B, there exists
x = y−1
5
, where x ∈A,
such that
f(x) = 5x+ 1 = 5. y−1
5
+ 1 = y.
Thus ∀y ∈B, ∃x ∈A, such that f(x) = y.

Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 4.2.3 Let A = {3,5,7,9,11}, B = {4,6,8,10}, and
f = {(3,4),(5,6),(7,8),(9,10),(11,4)}.
Since Rng(f) = {4,6,8,10}, then f is onto function.
Example 4.2.4 Let A = {x ∈R : x ≥0}, B = R, and
f = {(x,y) : y = x2 + 1}.
Since Rng(f) = {y ∈B : y ≥1} ̸= B, then f is not onto function.
Deﬁnition 4.2.5 Let f : A →B be a function. Then f is called a one-to-one function,
if
∀a,a′ ∈A,(a ̸= a′ ⇒f(a) ̸= f(a′)).
A one-to-one function is also called an injection.
Example 4.2.6 Let A = {3,5,8}, B = {1,2,4,6}, and let f,g be functions from A to
B deﬁned by
f = {(3,1),(5,4),(8,2)},
g = {(3,2),(5,2),(8,4)}.
Then f is one-to-one. Meanwhile, g is not one-to-one, since
3 ̸= 5, but g(3) = g(5) = 2.
Example 4.2.7 Let A = {x ∈R : −2 ≤x ≤5}, B = R, and let f,g be functions from
A to B deﬁned by
f = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = x3},
g = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = 3x2 + 1}.
The function f is one-to-one, since
x3
1 = x3
2 ⇒x1 = x2,
that is, f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒x1 = x2, which is equivalent to
x1 ̸= x2 ⇒f(x1) ̸= f(x2).
However, the function g is not one-to-one, since
−2 = x1 ̸= x2 = 2; however ,13 = f(x1) = f(x2) = 13.

Functions
103
Example 4.2.8 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) =
1
x2 + 1.
Is f one-to-one?
Assume that f(x1) = f(x2). Then
1
x2
1 + 1 =
1
x2
2 + 1.
Therefore, x2
1 + 1 = x2
2 + 1. So
x2
1 = x2
2.
It does not follow from this that x1 = x2. For example
f(2) = f(−2) = 5,
Therefore, f is not one-to-one.
Deﬁnition 4.2.9 A function f : A →B, which is both one-to-one and onto is called
a bijection, or an one–one correspondence.
Example 4.2.10 Let
A = {1,3,5,7,...} = {2n + 1|n is an integer},
B = {2,4,6,8...} = {2n|n is an integer},
and let
f = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = 2x},
g = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = x+ 1}.
The function f : A →B is not a bijection, because it is not onto, meanwhile, the
function g : A →B is a bijection, since it is both one-to-one and onto.
Example 4.2.11 Let A = B = R, and let
f = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = 2x3 −7}.
Then f is a bijection from A to B.
Deﬁnition 4.2.12 Let f : A →B and g : C →D be functions. The two functions f
and g are equal, denoted by
f = g,

104
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
if
1. A = C,
2. B = D,
3. f(x) = g(x), ∀x ∈A.
Example 4.2.13 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = |x|,
and let g : R →R be a function deﬁned by
g(x) =
√
x2.
The two functions are equal.
Example 4.2.14 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = x2,
and let g : C →C be a function deﬁned by
g(x) = x2.
The functions are not equal, since Dom(f) ̸= Dom(g).
Deﬁnition 4.2.15 The function f : A →A is called the identity function, if
f(x) = x, ∀x ∈A.
Example 4.2.16 Let A = {1,2,3}, and let
f = {(x,y) ∈A× A : x = y}
= {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)}.
Then f : A →A is the identity function.
Remark 4.2.17 The identity function is one-to-one and onto, and hence, it is a bi-
jection.
Deﬁnition 4.2.18 The function f : A →B is called a constant function, if there exists
a ﬁxed element c ∈B, such that
f(x) = c, ∀x ∈A.
Example 4.2.19 Let f : R →R be deﬁned by
f(x) = 3, ∀x ∈R.
Then f is a constant function.

Functions
105
Remark 4.2.20 If f : A →B is a constant function. Then the following assertions
are true:
1. If A contains more than one element, then f is not one-to-one.
2. If B contains more than one element, then f is not onto.
Deﬁnition 4.2.21 Let A be a nonempty subset of B. Then the function
f : A →B
is called an inclusion function (or, an embedding), if
f(x) = x, ∀x ∈A.
Example 4.2.22 Let A = N, B = Z, and let
f = {(x,y) ∈N× Z : y = x}.
Since N ⊆Z and f(x) = x, ∀x ∈N, it follows that f : N →Z is an inclusion function.
Example 4.2.23 Let A = {x ∈R : −2 ≤x ≤2}, B = R, and let
f = {(x,y) ∈A× B : y = x}.
Since A ⊂R and f(x) = x, then f : A →B is an inclusion function.
Remark 4.2.24 Let f : A →B be an inclusion function. Then the following asser-
tions are true:
1. If A = B, then f = IA.
2. The function f is one-to-one.
3. If A ⊂B, then f is not onto.
Deﬁnition 4.2.25 Let B be a subset of A and C = {0,1}, and let f be the relation
from A to C deﬁned by
f(x) =
(
0
if x ∈B,
1
if x ∈A−B.
The function f : A →C is called the characteristic function of B in A.
By deﬁnition, characteristic functions are onto {0,1}, if and only if B is a non
empty proper subset of A. It is not hard to check that a characteristic function of a
non empty subset B in A is not onto {0,1}, if and only if B = A.
Deﬁnition 4.2.26 Let f : A →B be a function, and let C be a subset of A. Then the
function,
g : C →B,
which is deﬁned by g(x) = f(x), ∀x ∈C, is called the restriction of f to C. We denote
this restriction g by
f|C.

106
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Example 4.2.27 Let f be a function on R deﬁned by
f = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = f(x) = x2},
and let g be a function from N to R deﬁned by
g = {(x,y) ∈N× R : y = g(x) = x2}.
Since N ⊂R and f(x) = g(x), ∀x ∈N, then g : N →R is the restriction of f to N.
One can check that if a function is one-to-one, then its restrictions are one-to-one,
however, even though a function is onto, the corresponding restrictions are not onto,
in general. By deﬁnitions, every inclusion function is understood to be a restriction.
Deﬁnition 4.2.28 Let f : A →B be a function, and let A ⊆D. Then the function,
g : D →B,
is called an extension of f from A to D, if
g(x) = f(x), ∀x ∈A,
that is g|A = f.
Example 4.2.29 In Example 4.2.27, the function
f : R →R
is an extension of the function
g : N →R.
It can be veriﬁed that, even though f is onto (or, one-to-one), its extensions are
not onto (respectively, one-to-one), in general. That is, the one-to-one-ness, and the
onto-ness of functions do not affect those of extensions in general.
Deﬁnition 4.2.30 A function f : A →B is called a numerical function, if B is a set
of numbers.
Majority of the exercises and examples above are numerical functions.
Deﬁnition 4.2.31 Let A = B = R, and let
f = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = |x|},
where
|x| =
(
x
if x ≥0,
−x
if x < 0.
This function is called the absolute value function.

Functions
107
By deﬁnition, the absolute value function is neither one-to-one nor onto on R.
Deﬁnition 4.2.32 Let A be an arbitrary set. A function,
f : N →A,
is called a sequence in A. By denoting the images of f by
{ fn} or f1, f2,..., where fn = f(n) for all n ∈N,
one can obtain a sequence in A.
Remark 4.2.33 If A = R, the sequence is called sequence of real numbers.
Example 4.2.34
 1
2n
	
, {(−1)n} are sequences of real numbers.
Depending on sequences, they can be either one-to-one or onto case-by-case. How-
ever, in general, sequences are neither one-to-one nor onto.
Deﬁnition 4.2.35 Let A be a nonempty ﬁnite set. Every bijection f from A to A
is called a permutation of A. That is, all bijections on “ﬁnite” sets are said to be
permutations.
Example 4.2.36 Let A = {1,3,5}, and let f : A →A be deﬁned by
f(1) = 3,
f(3) = 5,
f(5) = 1.
Since f : A →A is a bijection on a ﬁnite set A, it is a permutation of A.
Deﬁnition 4.2.37 Let A be a set, and R be an equivalence relation on A. The function
f : A →A/R, deﬁned by
f(x) = [x],
is called a canonical function (or, a quotient map).
By the very deﬁnition, every canonical function is onto the quotient set A/R, but it
is not one-to-one, because if two distinct elements x and y of A are related under an
equivalence relation R, then they induce the same equivalence class, that is, [x] = [y],
implying f(x) = f(y).
Example 4.2.38 Let A = Z, and let R be the relation on Z deﬁned by
R = {(x,y) ∈Z× Z : y−x is even}.
It is clear that R is an equivalence relation on Z and
Z/R = {[0],[1]}.

108
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
The function f : Z →Z/R, deﬁned by f(n) = [n], is a canonical function. For exam-
ple,
f(2) = [2] = [0],
f(5) = [5] = [1].
We remark that f : Z →Z/R is onto but not one–one.
Deﬁnition 4.2.39 Let A and B be sets. If f is a function with
Dom(f) = A× B,
then f is called a function of several (or, multi) variables.
Example 4.2.40 Let f : R× R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x,y) = 1
3πx2y, ∀(x,y) ∈R× R.
Then f is a function of two variables x and y, its domain is R× R.
One can generalize this concept with Dom(f). In addition, codom(f) are the Carte-
sian product of more than two sets. For example,
f : R4 →R2,
deﬁned by
f(x,y,z,w) = (3x+ y,4z+ w),
is a function in four variables.
Deﬁnition 4.2.41 Let A be a set, and let
R+ = {x ∈R : x ≥0}.
The function d : A×A →R+ is called the distance function (or a metric, or a metric
function) on A, if the following conditions hold for ∀a,b,c ∈A:
1. 0 ≤d(a,b),
2. d(a,b) = 0 ⇔a = b,
3. d(a,b) = d(b,a),
4. d(a,b) ≤d(a,c)+ d(c,b).
In general, a distance function is neither one-to-one nor onto.
Example 4.2.42 Let d be a relation from R× R to R+ deﬁned by
d(a,b) = |a −b|, ∀(a,b) ∈R× R.
Then d : R× R →R+ is a distance function. In this case, it is onto.

Functions
109
Example 4.2.43 Let A be a set, and let d be a relation from A× A to R+ deﬁned by
d(a,b) =
(
1
if a ̸= b,
0
if a = b.
Then, d : A×A →R+ is a distance function, called the discrete distance (or, the Dirac
measure). In this case, if A contains more than one element, then d is onto {0,1}.
Deﬁnition 4.2.44 Let A1, A2 be sets. Functions,
Pi : A1 × A2 →Ai (i = 1,2),
which are deﬁned by
Pi(a1,a2) = ai (i = 1,2),
are called the projection functions (or, projections).
Remark 4.2.45 The function Pi : A1 × A2 →Ai is onto, but not one-to-one. It is
possible to generalize this concept to n sets A1,A2,...,An.
The functions
Pi : A1 × A2 × ...An →Ai (i = 1,2,...,n)
deﬁned by
Pi(a1,a2,...,an) = ai (i = 1,2,...,n),
are called the projections of the Cartesian product A1 × A2 × ...An on Ai.
Example 4.2.46 The function
Pi : R2 →R, deﬁned by Pi(x1,x2) = xi, (i = 1,2),
is the projection of R2 on R.
As we have seen, projection functions are onto, but not one-to-one.
Theorem 4.2.47 Let
f1 : B →A,
f2 : C →A,
be functions, such that B∩C = φ. If f = f1 ∪f2, then
1. f : B∪C →A is a function,
2. f1 = f|B and f2 = f|C.
Proof First we prove that
(a) (x,y) ∈f ∧x ∈B ⇔(x,y) ∈f1,
(b) (x,y) ∈f ∧x ∈C ⇔(x,y) ∈f2.

110
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
(a) Suppose that (x,y) ∈f ∧x ∈B. Then
(x,y) ∈f ⇒(x,y) ∈f1 ∧(x,y) ∈f2.
If (x,y) ∈f2, then x ∈C, and since x ∈B, then it follows that x ∈B ∩C, a
contradiction.
Hence, (x,y) ̸∈f2, and therefore (x,y) ∈f1.
Conversely, suppose that (x,y) ∈f1. Then x ∈B.
Since f = f1 ∪f2, then (x,y) ∈f. Thus
(x,y) ∈f1 ⇒(x,y) ∈f ∧x ∈B.
So, we get (x,y) ∈f ∧x ∈B ⇔(x,y) ∈f1.
(b) We leave the proof, to the reader, as exercise.
Now, we prove the theorem.
1. Suppose that x ∈B∪C, then x ∈B∧x ∈C.
Assume that x ∈B. Since f1 : B →A is a function, then ∃y ∈A, such that
(x,y) ∈f1.
Since f1 ⊆f, then (x,y) ∈f, that is ∃y ∈A, such that
(x,y) ∈f
(4.1)
Now, assume that x ∈C. Since
f2 : C →A is a function, then ∃w ∈A, such that (x,w) ∈f2.
As f2 ⊆f, then (x,y) ∈f, that is
∃w ∈A, such that (x,w) ∈f.
(4.2)
Thus, one has
∃x ∈B∪C, ∃z ∈A, such that (x,z) ∈f, where z = y, or z = w.
Suppose (x,y1) ∈f ∧(x,y2) ∈f. Then x ∈B∪C by deﬁnition of the function.
Thus x ∈B∨x ∈C. Assume x ∈B, from (a), that we ﬁnd
(x,y1) ∈f ∧x ∈B ⇒(x,y1) ∈f1
also,
(x,y2) ∈f ∧x ∈B ⇒(x,y2) ∈f1.
Since f1 : B →A is a function, then y1 = y2.
Now, assume x ∈C. From (b), we have
(x,y1) ∈f ∧x ∈C ⇒(x,y1) ∈f2,
(x,y2) ∈f ∧x ∈C ⇒(x,y2) ∈f2.
Since f2 : C →A is a function, then y1 = y2.
Thus in both cases, we have y1 = y2. Hence f : B∪C →A is a function.
2. We leave the proof of 2, as an exercise for readers.

COMPOSITE FUNCTIONS AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS
In this section, we consider a certain transitivity on functions, called the composition.
Note that such a property holds well since every function is deﬁned wholly from its
domain, and assigns each element of its domain to a unique image in its range.
Theorem 4.3.1 Let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. Then
g ◦f : A →C is a function.
Proof Let x ∈A. Since f : A →B is a function, then ∃y ∈B, such that (x,y) ∈f.
Similarly, since g : B →C is a function, then ∃z ∈C, such that (y,z) ∈g. Then
(x,z) ∈g ◦f, by deﬁnition of composite relations. That is,
∀x ∈A, ∃z ∈C, such that
(x,z) ∈g ◦f.
(4.3)
Now, suppose that
(x,z1) ∈g ◦f ∧(x,z2) ∈g ◦f.
Then
(x,z1) ∈g ◦f ⇒∃y1 ∈B,
such that
(x,y1) ∈f ∧(y1,z1) ∈g
and
(x,z2) ∈g ◦f ⇒∃y2 ∈B,
such that
(x,y2) ∈f ∧(y2,z2) ∈g.
As f : A →B is a function, then
(x,y1) ∈f ∧(x,y2) ∈f ⇒y1 = y2.
y1
y2
z1
z2
x1
x2
Thus (y1,z2) ∈g.
Since g : B →C is a function, then
(y1,z1) ∈g ∧(y1,z2) ∈g ⇒z1 = z2,
so, if
(x,z1) ∈g ◦f ∧(x,z2) ∈g ◦f,

Functions
115
then
z1 = z2.
(4.4)
By Equations (4.3) and (4.4), one can conclude that
g ◦f : A →C
is a function.
The above theorem can be re-stated as follows:
Corollary 4.3.2 Let f : A →B, g : B →C be functions. Then
∀x ∈A,(g ◦f)(x) = g(f(x)).
Proof Suppose that z = (g ◦f)(x). Then (x,z) ∈g ◦f. Therefore ∃y ∈B, such that
(x,y) ∈f ∧(y,z) ∈g, but
(x,y) ∈f ⇔y = f(x) and (y,z) ∈g ⇔z = g(y).
Hence z = g(y) = g(f(x)), so (g ◦f)(x) = g(f(x)).
Deﬁnition 4.3.3 Let f : A →B, g : B →C be functions. The function g ◦f : A →C,
which is deﬁned by g ◦f := g(f(x)), ∀x ∈A, is called the composite function of f
and g. And the construction of composite functions, or the operation (◦) is called the
composition.
One can illustrate the composition diagramatically as follows:
A
f
g˚f
g
B
C
Example 4.3.4 Let f : A →B, g : B →C be functions deﬁned by the diagram,
a
b
c
x
y
z
r
s
t
Then the composite function g ◦f : A →C is deﬁned to be a function satisfying,
(g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(y) = t,
(g ◦f)(b) = g(f(b)) = g(z) = r,
(g ◦f)(c) = g(f(c)) = g(y) = t,

having its domain A, and its range contained in C. That is, it satisﬁes the following
diagram:

Example 4.3.5 Let f : R →R be the function deﬁned by f(x) = 4x2, and g : R →R
be the function deﬁned by g(x) = 3x+ 1. Then g ◦f : R →R is the function deﬁned
by
(g ◦f)(x) = g(f(x))
= g(4x2)
= 3(4x2)+ 1
= 12x2 + 1,
and f ◦g : R →R is the function deﬁned by
(f ◦g)(x) = f(g(x))
= f(3x+ 1)
= 4(3x+ 1)2
= 36x2 + 24x+ 4.
Note that f ◦g and g ◦f are not the same functions.
The above example demonstrates that the composite functions f ◦g and g ◦f are
not identical, in general, and hence, the composition (◦) is not commutative (as an
operation on functions).
Theorem 4.3.6 Let f : A →B, g : B →C be functions.
1. If f and g are one-to-one, then g ◦f : A →C is one-to-one.
2. If f and g are onto, then g ◦f : A →C is onto.
3. If f and g are bijective, then g ◦f : A →C is bijective.
Proof By Theorem 4.3.1, the composite function f ◦g is indeed a well-deﬁned
function. So, it sufﬁces to check the one-to-one-ness, onto-ness, and bijectivity, re-
spectively.

Functions
117
1. Suppose x1,x2 ∈A, such that (g ◦f)(x1) = (g ◦f)(x2).
Then
g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2)).
Since g is one-to-one,
g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2) ⇒f(x1) = f(x2),
and since f is one-to-one,
f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒x1 = x2.
Thus, the composition function g ◦f : A →C is an one–one function.
2. Let z ∈C. Since g is an onto function,
∃y ∈B, such that z = g(y),
and since f is onto,
∃x ∈A, such that y = f(x).
Therefore, ∃x ∈A, such that z = g(f(x)) = (g ◦f)(x).
Thus, the composite function g ◦f : A →C is onto.
3. Since the composite function g ◦f is one-to-one whenever f and g are, and
since g ◦f is onto whenever f and g are, it is not hard to verify that g ◦f is
bijective, if f and g are bijective. We leave the detailed proof to the readers.
Now, let’s consider the converse of Theorem 4.3.6. The converse does not hold true
in general, however, we obtain the following results.
Theorem 4.3.7 Let f : A →B and g : B →C be function.
1. If g ◦f : A →C is one-to-one, then f is one-to-one,
2. If g ◦f : A →C is onto, then g is onto.
Proof By deﬁnition, if the composition g◦f is well-deﬁned as a function, then both
f and g are well-deﬁned functions.
1. Let x1,x2 ∈A, such that
f(x1) = f(x2).
Then g(f(x1)) = g(f(x2)). So (g◦f)(x1) = (g◦f)(x2). As g◦f is one-to-one,
then it follows that
(g ◦f)(x1) = (g ◦f)(x2) ⇒x1 = x2.
Thus f is one-to-one.

118
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
2. Let z ∈C. Since g ◦f is onto, then ∃x ∈A such that
(g ◦f)(x) = z,
that is, ∃x ∈A, such that g(f(x)) = z. Moreover, f(x) ∈B. Hence g is onto.
By the above theorem, we obtain the following result, too.
Theorem 4.3.8 Let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. If g◦f is a bijection, then
f is one-to-one and g is onto.
We leave the proof of Theorem 4.3.8 to the readers.
Remark 4.3.9 Note that the converse of Theorem 4.3.8 does not hold true. Even
though f is one-to-one, and g is onto, the composite function g◦f is not necessarily
a bijection. See Example 4.3.10 below.
Example 4.3.10 Let f : R →R be the function deﬁned by
f(x) = x,
and let g : R →R+ be the function deﬁned by
g(x) = x2.
Then g ◦f : R →R+ is deﬁned by
(g ◦f)(x) = x2.
We see that f is one-one and g is onto, but g ◦f is not bijective.
Deﬁnition 4.3.11 If f : A →B is a function, then the inverse of f is the “relation”,
f −1 = {(x,y) : (y,x) ∈f}.
Remark 4.3.12 By Deﬁnition 4.3.11, it is not necessary that f −1 is a function from
B to A, in general. Also if
f −1 : B →A
is a function, it is not necessary that f : A →B is a function.
Example 4.3.13 Let
A = {5,7,9},
B = {−2,4},
and let f = {(5,−2),(7,−2),(9,4)}. Then the corresponding inverse f −1 is deter-
mined to be
f −1 = {(−2,5),(−2,7),(4,9)},
as a relation. It is clear that f : A →B is a function, but f −1 : B →A is not a function.

Functions
119
Example 4.3.14 Let A = {3}, B = {2,4,6}, and let
f = {(3,2),(3,4),(3,6)},
f −1 = {(2,3),(4,3),(6,3)}.
It is clear that f : A →B is a relation, which is not a function, but f −1 : B →A is a
function.
Deﬁnition 4.3.15 A function f : A →B is said to be invertible, if the inverse f −1 :
B →A is a function. In this case, the function f −1 is called the inverse function of f.
Remark 4.3.16 If f : A →B is a function, then
(x,y) ∈f if and only if (y,x) ∈f −1.
In other words, y = f(x), if and only if x = f −1(y). Therefore, (f −1)−1 = f.
Example 4.3.17 Let f : R →R be a function, such that
f = {(x,y) ∈R× R : y = x3} ⇒f −1 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x = y3}.
It is clear that f −1 : R →R is a function. And hence, f is invertible with its inverse
function f −1.
Example 4.3.18 Let g : R →R be a function deﬁned by
g = {(x,y) : y = x2}.
Then,
g−1 = {(x,y) ∈R× R : x = y2}.
So, the relation g−1 is not a function, equivalently, the function f : R →R is not
invertible.
The following theorem gives us a characterization for a function to be invertible.
Theorem 4.3.19 The function f : A →B is invertible, if and only if it is bijective.
Proof Suppose f : A →B is invertible, then the inverse f −1 : B →A of f is a function.
So, it sufﬁces to prove that f : A →B is both one-to-one and onto.
Suppose x1,x2 ∈A, such that f(x1) = f(x2) = y.
Then,
(x1,y) ∈f ∧(x2,y) ∈f ⇒(y,x1) ∈f −1 ∧(y,x2) ∈f −1
⇒x1 = x2.
since the inverse f −1 is a function. Thus f : A →B is one-to-one.
Now, let y ∈B. Since f −1 : B →A is a function, then ∃x ∈A, such that (y,x) ∈f −1.
So, ∃x ∈A, such that (x,y) ∈f; that is, ∃x ∈A, such that y = f(x). Thus f : A →B
is onto.

120
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Therefore, f : A →B is a bijective function.
Conversely, suppose f : A →B is a bijective function. Show that f : A →B is invert-
ible, that is, the inverse f −1 : A →B is a function.
First, we assume y ∈B. Since f : A →B is onto, then ∃x ∈A such that f(x) = y; that
is, ∃x ∈A, such that (x,y) ∈f. But
(x,y) ∈f ⇒(y,x) ∈f −1.
Thus ∃x ∈A, such that (y,x) ∈f −1; i.e.,
Dom(f −1) = B
(4.5)
Now, suppose (y,x1) ∈f −1 ∧(y,x2) ∈f −1. Then,
(x1,y) ∈f ∧(x2,y) ∈f; i.e., f(x1) = y∧f(x2) = y,
implying that, f(x1) = f(x2).
Since f is one-to-one, then f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒x1 = x2. Thus (y,x1) ∈f −1 ∧(y,x2) ∈
f −1 ⇒
x1 = x2.
(4.6)
Therefore, from Equations (4.5) and (4.6), the inverse
f −1 : B →A
is a function.
By Theorem 4.3.19 and by the invertibility (f −1)−1 = f, we obtain the following
result.
Corollary 4.3.20 If f : A →B is an invertible function, then
f −1 : B →A
is a bijective function.
Proof Suppose f is invertible, then the inverse f −1 of f is a function.
1. Let y1,y2 ∈B, such that
f −1(y1) = f −1(y2) = x.
Then
(y1,x) ∈f −1 ∧(y2,x) ∈f −1.
So,
(x,y1) ∈f ∧(x,y2) ∈f.
That is
y1 = f(x)∧y2 = f(x).
This implies y1 = y2. Thus, f −1 : B →A is one-to-one.

Functions
121
2. Let x ∈A. Since f : A →B is a function, then
∃y ∈B such that (x,y) ∈f,
showing that ∃y ∈B, such that (y,x) ∈f −1. In other words, ∃y ∈B, such that
f −1(y) = x. Thus, f −1 : B →A is onto.
Therefore, the inverse function f −1 : B →A of f is a bijection.
Thus, one can ﬁnd connections between the composition (◦) and the invertibility.
Theorem 4.3.21 If f : A →B is invertible function, then
1. f −1 ◦f = IA,
2. f ◦f −1 = IB,
where IA and IB are the identity functions on A, respectively, on B.
Proof We here prove part 1, and leave the proof of part 2, for readers, as exercise.
1. Since f : A →B is invertible, then
f −1 : B →A
is a function, and f −1 ◦f : A →A is a function. Suppose x ∈A and f(x) = y.
Then
(f −1 ◦f)(x) = f −1(f(x)) = f −1(y) = x.
Since IA : A →A is deﬁned by
IA(x) = x, ∀x ∈A,
i.e., ∀x ∈A, (f −1 ◦f)(x) = x = IA(x). i.e., f −1 ◦f = IA.

DIRECT IMAGES AND INVERSE IMAGES UNDER A FUNCTION
Deﬁnition 4.4.1 Let f : A →B be a function and let C ⊆A. The set
f(C) = {y ∈B : y = f(x) for some x ∈C}
is called the direct image of C under f.
By deﬁnition, if f : A →B is a function, then the direct image f(A) of A under f is
nothing but the range Rng(f) of f. Also, direct images of all subsets of A become
subsets of B, under an additional axiomatization: the direct image of the empty set
becomes the empty set.
Example 4.4.2 Let f : Z →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = x2 + 2.
Let C = {−3,−1,0,1,3}, then f(C) = {11,3,2}.
Example 4.4.3 Let f : R−{0} →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = 1
x .
Let C = (0,1], then f(C) = {y ∈R : 1 ≤y < ∞}.
Theorem 4.4.4 Let f : X →Y be a function and let A,B be subsets of X. If A = B,
then f(A) = f(B).

126
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof Suppose A = B, and let y ∈f(A). Then ∃x ∈A, such that y = f(x). Since
A = B, then x ∈B. Thus y = f(x) ∈f(B). Hence
f(A) ⊆f(B).
(4.7)
Similarly, we have
f(B) ⊆f(A).
(4.8)
From Equations (4.7) and (4.8), one has f(A) = f(B).
Remark 4.4.5 Even though f(A) = f(B), it is not necessary that A = B. See Example
4.4.6 below.
Example 4.4.6 Let X = Z, Y = R and let
f : X →Y
be a function deﬁned by f(x) = x2. Let A = {−2,1,3}, B = {2,1,−3}, then
f(A) = {4,1,9} and f(B) = {4,1,9}.
Notice that f(A) = f(B), but A ̸= B.
Theorem 4.4.7 Let f : X →Y be a function and f ∗be a relation from P(X) to P(Y)
deﬁned by
f ∗= {(A,B) ∈P(X)× P(Y) : f(A) = B}.
Then f ∗is a function from P(X) to P(Y), where P(Z) is the power set of a set Z.
Proof First, suppose A ∈P(X), then A ⊆X. Thus, f(A) ⊆Y from which we get
f(A) ∈P(Y). Suppose f(A) = B, then
∀A ∈P(X), ∃B ∈P(Y), such that (A,B) ∈f ∗.
Now, supposing (A,B1) ∈f ∗∧(A,B2) ∈f ∗, we obtain
B1 = f ∗(A)∧B2 = f ∗(A),
and hence, B1 = B2. Therefore, f ∗: P(X) →P(Y) is a well-deﬁned function.
One can have the following relations on direct images.
Theorem 4.4.8 If f : A →B is a mapping and C,D are subsets of A, then
(a) f(C ∪D) = f(C)∪f(D),
(b) f(C ∩D) ⊆f(C)∩f(D),
(c) f(C −D) ⊇f(C)−f(D).

Functions
127
Proof We here prove parts (a) and (c), and leave the proof of part (b) to the readers
as exercise.
(a) Suppose y ∈f(C ∪D). Then y ∈f(C ∪D) ⇔∃x ∈C ∪D, such that y = f(x)
⇔∃x ∈C ∧x ∈D, such that y = f(x)
⇔(∃x ∈C, such that y = f(x))∧(∃x ∈D, such that y = f(x))
⇔f(x) ∈f(C)∧f(X) ∈f(D)
⇔y ∈f(C)∧y ∈f(D)
⇔y ∈(f(C)∪f(D)).
Consequently, f(C ∪D) = f(C)∪f(D).
(c) Suppose y ∈f(C)−f(D). Then y ∈f(C)∧y ̸∈f(D). Since y ∈f(C), ∃x ∈C,
such that y = f(x). This implies
y = f(x) ̸∈f(D), since y ̸∈f(D).
Therefore, x ̸∈D; i.e.,
∃x ∈C ∧x ̸∈D
such that
y = f(x).
So, ∃x ∈C −D such that y = f(x). This implies that y ∈f(C −D). In con-
clusion,
y ∈f(C)−f(D) ⇒y ∈f(C −D).
Thus, f(C)−f(D) ⊆f(C −D).
Remark 4.4.9 The following example shows that
f(C)∩f(D) ̸⊆f(C ∩D).
Let A = {3,5}, B = {2}, and let
f : A →B
be constant function. Suppose C = {3}, D = {5}. Then
f(C ∩D) = f(φ) = φ,
and
f(C) = f({3}) = {2}, f(D) = f({5}) = {2}.
Thus,
f(C)∩f(D) = {2},
from which we obtain that
f(C)∩f(D) ̸⊆f(C ∩D).

Deﬁnition 4.4.10 Let f : A →B be a function, and let D ⊆B. The set
f −1(D) = {x ∈A : f(x) ∈D}
is called the inverse image (or, the pre image) of D under f.
Note that, even though the inverse images are expressed under the symbol f −1,
this symbol does not mean the inverse function of f. It is simply used pure symboli-
cally. Even if f is not invertible, one can deﬁne and write the corresponding inverse
images as above.
Example 4.4.11 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = x2 + 1,
then
f −1(17) = {x ∈R : f(x) = 17}
= {x ∈R : x2 + 1 = 17}
= {x ∈R : x2 = 16}
= {−4,4}.
Also
f −1({5,10}) = {x ∈A : f(x) ∈{5,10}
= {x ∈A : x2 + 1 = 5 ∨x2 + 1 = 10}
= {−2,2,−3,3}.
Theorem 4.4.12 Let f : X →Y be a function and C,D be subsets of Y. If C = D,
then f −1(C) = f −1(D).
Proof Suppose C = D and let x ∈f −1(C). Then
x ∈f −1(C) ⇔f(x) ∈C
⇔f(x) ∈D(since C = D)
⇔x ∈f −1(D).
Hence, f −1(C) = f −1(D).
Remark 4.4.13 Even though f −1(C) = f −1(D), it is not necessary that C = D. See

and let C = (0,1), D = (−2,1). Then
f −1((0,1)) = (−1,1),
f −1((−2,1)) = (−1,1).
Notice that f −1((−2,1)) = f −1((−1,1)), but (−2,1) ̸= (−1,1).
Theorem 4.4.15 Let f : A →B be a function and C,D be subsets of B. Then
(a) f −1(C ∪D) = f −1(C)∪f −1(D),
(b) f −1(C ∩D) = f −1(C)∩f −1(D),
(c) f −1(C −D) = f −1(C)−f −1(D).
Proof We show part (b) and leave the proof of parts (a) and (c) to the readers as
exercise.
(b) Suppose x ∈f −1(C ∩D). Then
x ∈f −1(C ∩D) ⇔f(x) ∈C ∩D
⇔f(x) ∈C ∧f(x) ∈(D)
⇔x ∈f −1(C)∧x ∈f −1(D)
⇔x ∈f −1(C)∩f −1(D).
Thus f −1(C ∩D) = f −1(C)∩f −1(D).
Notion 4.4.16 For a set A, by 2A, we denote the set of all the functions from A to
{a,b}.
Theorem 4.4.17 For every set A, then there exists a bijection between 2A and the
power set P(A) of A.
Proof Suppose we let 2 = {0,1}, notationally. We deﬁne a relation R from P(A) to
2A by
R = {(B,F) ∈P(A)× 2A : f = λB},
where λB is the characteristic function, i.e.,
λB(x) =
(
0,
x ∈B,
1,
x ∈A−B,
First, we prove that R is a function from P(A) to 2A. Assuming that B ∈P(A), we
obtain ∃λB ∈2A. Thus,
∀B ∈P(A), ∃λB ∈2A, so that
(B,λB) ∈R.

Let (B, f1) ∈R, (B, f2) ∈R. Then f1 = λB ∧f2 = λB. Hence f1 = f2.
Therefore, by Equation (4.9),
R : P(A) →2A
is a function.
Now, we show that R is one-to-one. To do that, we let B1,B2 ∈P(A), satisfying
R(B1) = R(B2). Since R(B1) = λB1, R(B2) = λB2, then λB1 = λB2. Thus,
B1 = {x ∈A : λB1(x) = 0} = {x ∈A : λB2(x) = 0} = B2.
So, R : P(A) →2A is one-one function.
Finally, we prove that R is onto function. Suppose f ∈2A, then f : A →2 = {0,1}.
Assuming B = f −1(0), we obtain that B ∈P(A), but R(B) = λB. Since
f(x) =
(
0,
x ∈B,
1,
x ∈A−B,
then R(B) = λB = f. So, R : P(A) →2A is onto.
As R is both one-to-one and onto, it is a bijection from P(A) to 2A.

5 Cardinality of Sets
Let A and B be sets. It is natural to ask whether or not A and B have the same number
of elements. In this chapter, we concentrate on studying when the given two sets A
and B have the same number of elements.
If both A and B are ﬁnite sets, it is relatively easy to check these sets have the
same number of elements, by directly counting the number of elements of the sets.
But this counting technique cannot be used for inﬁnite sets. In such a case, we then
try to ﬁnd a function,
f : A →B,
which is both one-to-one and onto. That is, if there exists at least one one-to-one
correspondence, or a bijection f from A onto B, then one can verify that the two sets
A and B have the same number of elements.

CARDINAL NUMBER
5.1.1
EQUIPOTENT SETS
We here concentrate on considering given two sets have the same number of elements
by the existence of at least one bijection between them.
Deﬁnition 5.1.1 Two sets A and B are said to be equipotent, denoted by A ≈B, if
there exists at least one bijection (or one one-to-one correspondence),
f : A →B, or f : B →A,
which is both one-to-one and onto. If there are no bijections between two sets, then
A and B are said to be not equipotent, and we write A ̸≈B.
As we considered in Chapter 4, if a function f : A →B is a bijection, then its inverse
function naturally exists,
f −1 : B →A.
So, the above deﬁnition can be simply re-deﬁned by that: A ≈B, if there exists a
bijection,
f : A →B.
Example 5.1.2 Let A = {a,b,c,d} and B = {1,4,7,10}, and let
f : A →B
be the function deﬁned by
f(a) = 1, f(b) = 4, f(c) = 7, f(d) = 10.
It is clear that f is a bijection, hence A ≈B.

Example 5.1.3 Let X = {x,y,z} and Y = {a,b}. It is impossible to ﬁnd a bijection
between X and Y. Hence X and Y are not equivalent; that is, X ̸≈Y.
Example 5.1.4 Let A and B be the open intervals (0, 1) and (2, 5), respectively. Let
f : A →B be a function deﬁned by
f(x) = 3x+ 2.
Since f is a bijection, A ≈B.
Example 5.1.5 Let N be the set of all natural numbers, and M be the set of all even
numbers, and let f : N →M be a function deﬁned by
f(n) = 2n.
Note that f is a bijection. Consequently, N ≈M.
In the very above example, we note that M ⊂N, and N ≈M, showing that set N of
natural numbers is equipotent to a proper subset M of all even numbers. It provides
a difference between ﬁniteness and inﬁniteness of sets.
Deﬁnition 5.1.6 A set A is an inﬁnite set, if it is equipotent to a proper subset of
itself.
By Example 5.1.5 and Deﬁnition 5.1.6, one can conclude that, indeed, set N of nat-
ural numbers is inﬁnite.
Theorem 5.1.7 The relation ≈is an equivalence relation.
Proof Let A be a set. Then there exists a well-deﬁned function,
idA : A →A,
deﬁned by
idA (a) = a, for all a ∈A.
It is not hard to check this function idA is a bijection.
Suppose now two sets A and B are equipotent. Since A ≈B, there exists a bijec-
tion,
f : A →B,
implying the existence of a bijection,
f −1 : B →A,
where f −1 is the inverse of f. It shows that B ≈A.
Now, assume that sets A and B are equipotent, and the sets B and C are equipotent,
that is,
A ≈B, and B ≈C.

Cardinality of Sets
135
Then there exists bijections,
g : A →B, and h : B →C.
So, one can deﬁne the composition,
h ◦g : A →C,
of h and g. Note and recall that this function h ◦g is not only invertible, but also,
(h ◦g)−1 = g−1 ◦h−1 : C →A,
implying the bijectivity of h ◦g. Thus,
A ≈C.
Therefore, the relation ≈is an equivalence relation.
The equipotent property, or the equipotence, also satisﬁes the following result as
an equivalence relation.
Theorem 5.1.8 Let A,B,C, and D be sets with A ≈C and B ≈D. If A and B are
disjoint, and if C and D are disjoint, then A∪B ≈C ∪D.
Proof Since A ≈C, then there is a bijection f : A →C, and since B ≈D, then there
is a bijection g : B →D. Then one can deﬁne a bijection,
f ∪g : A∪B →C ∪D,
deﬁned by
f ∪g(x) =



f(x)
if x ∈A
g(x)
if x ∈B,
for all x ∈A∪B. Note that, by deﬁnition, the function,
f ∪g,
is surjective; and by the disjoint conditions, it is injective, and hence, it is a bijection.
Therefore, A∪B ≈C ∪D.
Similarly, one can get the following result.
Theorem 5.1.9 Let A,B,C, and D be sets with A ≈C and B ≈D. Then A×B≈C×D.
Proof One can deﬁne a bijection,
f × g : A× B →C × D,
by
f × g((a,b)) = ( f(a), g(b)),
for all (a,b) ∈A× B. We leave the detailed proof to the readers.

Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Deﬁnition 5.1.10 The number of elements of a set A is called the cardinality of A.
The cardinality of A is denoted by #(A).
Notion 5.1.11 The cardinal number of φ is 0, denoted by #(φ) = 0.
The cardinality of {1} is 1, denoted by #({1}) = 1.
The cardinality of {1,2} is 2, denoted by #({1,2}) = 2.
...
The cardinality of {1,2,3,...,k} is k, denoted by
#({1,2,3,...,k}) = k.
From below, we use symbol Nk to write the set {1,2,3,...,k}.
Theorem 5.1.12 The fundamental property of the cardinalities is that:
A ≈B ⇐⇒#(A) = #(B).
Proof Indeed, if A ≈B, then there exists a bijection f : A →B, which is both one-
to-one and onto. By the one-to-one-ness and the onto-ness of f,
#(A) = #(B).
Conversely, if #(A) = #(B), then one can construct a bijection between A and B
because of the one-to-one-ness and the onto-ness of bijections, and hence, A ≈B.
We will consider it more precisely below.
By this equivalence, one may/can understand the cardinality, say α, which is a
quantity, as a family of all sets having the same cardinalities α. For instance,
{a,b}, {1,2}, {0,−2}, {x,y} ∈2, etc.,
by regarding 2 as a family of all sets having their cardinalities 2. That is, the quantity
2 represents the cardinalities of all sets having two elements.
Deﬁnition 5.1.13 A cardinal number α is the quantity, representing the cardinalities
of all equipotent sets having α-many elements.
Remark 5.1.14
1. The cardinal numbers induced by ﬁnite sets are nothing but the cardinalities of
the sets.
2. The set A is ﬁnite if there does not exist a proper subset B of A, such that B ≈A.
So, the ﬁnite cardinal numbers are determined uniquely up to cardinalities.
3. The cardinal number α is a ﬁnite number if it is the cardinality of a ﬁnite
set. Otherwise it is called an inﬁnite cardinal number. In such a sense, a ﬁnite
cardinal number is also called a natural number. An inﬁnite cardinal number
is called a transﬁnite number.

Cardinality of Sets
137
4. A set S is ﬁnite, if and only if
#(S) ̸= #(S)+ 1,
so, if α = #(S) and S is a ﬁnite set, then
α ̸= α + 1.
Theorem 5.1.15 Let A and B be ﬁnite sets. Then
#(A∪B) = #(A)+ #(B)−#(A∩B).
Meanwhile, the equality
#(A∪B) = #(A)+ #(B)
holds true, if and only if A and B are disjoint in the sense that
A∩B = φ.
Proof Suppose two sets A and B are ﬁnite sets, and hence,
#(A), #(B) ∈N.
We let
n = #(A), and k = #(B),
for n,k ∈N. Then the union X = A∪B,
X = {x | x ∈A, or x ∈B},
and the intersection Y = A∩B,
Y = {y | y ∈A, and y ∈B},
are well-deﬁned as new ﬁnite sets.
Observe that
#(X) ≤n + k,
since the quantity n + k double-counts the cardinality #(Y). Therefore,
#(X)+ #(Y) = n + k,
if and only if
#(X) = n + k −#(Y).
Meanwhile, if the intersection Y is empty, that is, Y = φ, then the above general
formula satisﬁes that
#(X) = n + k −0 = n + k,
since #(φ) = 0. Conversely, if Y is not empty, that is, Y ̸= φ, then
#(X) = n + k −#(Y) ̸= n + k,
because #(Y) ̸= 0 = #(φ).

Now, let’s consider the cases where cardinal numbers are not ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 5.1.16 The cardinal number ℵis deﬁned to be the cardinality #(N) of N,
that is,
ℵ= #(N).
Sometimes, ℵis called the countable inﬁnity.
Deﬁnition 5.1.17 The cardinal number c is deﬁned to be the cardinality #((0,1)) of
the subset (0,1), the open interval,
(0,1) = {r ∈R | 0 < r < 1},
of the set R of all real numbers. This cardinal number c is called the continuum (or,
the uncountable inﬁnity).
Example 5.1.18 Let (a,b) be any open interval in R, and let
f : (0,1) →(a,b)
be a function deﬁned by f(x) = a + (b −a)x. Then this function f is a bijection.
Thus, (a,b) has cardinality c.
Example 5.1.19 The function f : (−π
2 , π
2 ) →R deﬁned by
f(x) = tanx,
is a bijection. Hence the set R of real numbers has its cardinality, the continuum c,
that is,
#(R) = c.
So, without loss of generality, one can re-deﬁne the cardinal number c, the contin-
uum, by the cardinality of R.
Theorem 5.1.20 The transﬁnite number ℵis strictly less than c. That is,
ℵ< c,
as cardinal numbers. And there are no cardinal numbers between ℵand c.
Proof One can ﬁnd a one-to-one function (or, an injection),
f : N →R,
by
f (n) = n in R, for all n ∈N.
i.e., this embedding function f is clearly one-to-one. It means that the range of f is a
proper subset of R, and hence,
#(N) = ℵ≤c = #(R).

Cardinality of Sets
139
Moreover, there are no one-to-one functions from R to N (See Section 5.1.2 further:
one can ﬁnd a bijection from subset Q of all rational numbers to N). It shows that
c ̸= ℵ.
Therefore,
ℵ< c,
as transﬁnite cardinal numbers.
Logically, there is no cardinal number between ℵand c. Indeed, if there were a
cardinal number β such that
ℵ≤β < c,
then
β = ℵ+ k, for some k ∈{0}∪N∪{ℵ},
implying that
β = #(A) = #(N) = ℵ,
by the equipotent property of A and N:
A ≈N∪Nk ≈N.
Also, if there were a cardinal number γ satisfying
ℵ< γ ≤c,
then
γ = c−k, for some l ∈{0}∪N∪{ℵ},
implying that
γ = #(B) = #(R) = c,
by the equipotent property of B and R:
B ≈R−Nk ≈R.
Therefore, there are no cardinal numbers between ℵand c.
The above theorem shows that there are only two transﬁnite (or inﬁnite) cardinal
numbers ℵand c. By discussions, if we deﬁne set C of all cardinal numbers, then
C = {0}∪N∪{ℵ}∪{c}.
In particular, all ﬁnite cardinal numbers are from subset {0}∪N of C , and the trans-
ﬁnite cardinal numbers are {ℵ, c} in C .

COUNTABLE SETS
In the previous section, we consider the equipotent property on sets, and the cardi-
nality of sets, and show that two sets are equipotent, if and only if they have the same
cardinality. Based on the cardinalities of sets, we deﬁne and study cardinal numbers,
{0}∪N∪{ℵ}∪{c}.
In this section, we study a transﬁnite cardinal number, ℵ, more in detail. Recall that
ℵ= #(N).
Deﬁnition 5.1.21 A set A is said to be countable (or, denumerable), if
#(A) ≤ℵ.
In particular, if a set A is a ﬁnite set, then it is said to be ﬁnitely countable, meanwhile,
if it is equipotent to set N of natural numbers, then A is said to be inﬁnitely countable.
By deﬁnition, the empty set φ whose cardinality is 0, and all nonempty ﬁnite sets
whose cardinalities are in N, and the sets equipotent to N whose cardinalities are ℵ
are countable.
Deﬁnition 5.1.22 A set is said to be uncountable (or, not denumerable), if it is not
countable.
By deﬁnition, every set equipotent to R, equivalently, whose cardinality is the con-
tinuum c, is uncountable.
Also, by the above deﬁnitions, one can realize that there are two kinds of inﬁn-
ity, denoted usually by ∞; the countable inﬁnity ℵ, and the uncountable inﬁnity c,
satisfying
ℵ< c,
in terms of transﬁnite numbers.
Theorem 5.1.23 Set Z of all integers is countable.
Proof There exists a bijection f : N →Z deﬁned by
f(x) =
(
x
2,
if x is even,
1−x
2 ,
if x is odd.
We leave the detailed proof to the readers.
Theorem 5.1.24 The Cartesian product N× N is countable.
Proof There is a bijection f : N× N →N by
f(m,n) = 2m−1(2n −1).
We leave the detailed proof to the readers.

Cardinality of Sets
141
Example 5.1.25 Any inﬁnite sequence,
(a1,a2,a3,...)
of mutually distinct elements is countable (as a set), since there is a bijection,
f(n) = an,
whose domain is N. Note here that the mutual distinctness of entries is crucial.
Theorem 5.1.26 Set Q+ = {q ∈Q | q > 0} of positive rational numbers is count-
able.
Proof Deﬁne a bijection f : Q+ →N× N by
f( p
q ) = (p,q), for all p
q ∈Q+,
where p and q are positive integers that are relatively prime in the sense that:
gcd(p,q) = 1, where gcd means the greatest common divisor. That is,
Q+ ≈N× N.
We leave the detailed proof for the readers as an exercise.
Since N× N ≈N by the very above theorem, we have
Q+ ≈N× N ≈N.
Therefore, Q+ is countable.
Theorem 5.1.27 If a set A is countable, then A ∪{x} is countable, where x is an
arbitrary element.
Proof Suppose f : N →A is a bijection, making N and A are equipotent. If x ∈A, then
A∪{x} = A, which is countable. If x ̸∈A, one can deﬁne a bijection g : N →A∪{x}
by
g(n) =
(
x,
if n = 1,
f(n −1),
if n ̸= 1.
We leave the detailed proof for the readers. The existence of this bijection g guaran-
tees that
N ≈A∪{x},
implying the countability of A∪{x}.
By above results, one obtains the following result.
Theorem 5.1.28 The set Q of all rational numbers is countable.

142
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Proof It is shown that subset Q+ of Q is countable. Now, deﬁne a subset Q−1 of Q
by
Q−= {y ∈Q | y < 0}.
Then there exists a bijection h : Q+ →Q−, deﬁned by
h(x) = −x, for all x ∈Q+.
It shows that subset Q−is countable.
Also, by the very above theorem, a subset
Q+
0 = Q+ ∪{0}
of Q is countable.
Note-and-recall that N ≈E, where E is the proper subset of N consisting of all
even numbers, by the existence of a bijection ge : N →E deﬁned by
ge (n) = 2n, for all n ∈N.
And, similarly, one can check that N ≈O, where O is the proper subset of N consist-
ing of all odd numbers, by the existence of a bijection go : N →O deﬁned by
go(n) = 2n −1, for all n ∈N.
Thus, one can have the equipotent properties,
Q+
0 ≈E ≈N, and Q−≈O ≈N.
So, one obtains that
Q = Q+
0 ∪Q−≈E ∪O = N.
Therefore, set Q is countable.
The above theorem shows that
#(Q) = ℵ.
Theorem 5.1.29 Every subset of a countable set is countable.
Proof Suppose a set A is countable. Assume ﬁrst that A is ﬁnite. If A = φ, then it has
only one subset φ, itself, satisfying #(φ) = 0. If A ≈Nk, for some k ∈N, then
#(B) ≤k < ℵ,
for all subsets B of A. So, if A is ﬁnitely countable, then all subsets of A are (ﬁnitely)
countable.
Now, assume that A is inﬁnitely countable, i.e., A ≈N, equivalently, #(A) = ℵ.
Note that a subset X of N satisﬁes
X = φ,

Cardinality of Sets
143
or
X ≈Nk, for some k ∈N,
or
X = N,
implying that
#(X) ∈{0}∪N∪{ℵ}.
Since A ≈N, if B is an arbitrary subset of A, then
#(B) ∈{0}∪N∪{ℵ},
too. Therefore, all subsets of a countable set A are countable.

CARDINAL ARITHMETIC
We have showed that if A and B are ﬁnite sets, then
#(A∪B) = #(A)+ #(B)−#(A∩B),
in N∪{0}. In this section, we consider such arithmetical operations on the set
C = {0}∪N∪{ℵ}∪{c}
of all cardinal numbers.
First, the addition (+) on C is formally deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.1.30 Let α and β be cardinals numbers, and let A and B be disjoint sets
such that α = #(A), β = #(B). Then
α + β = #(A∪B).
Remark 5.1.31 The addition (+) on C is well-deﬁned. Indeed, let A∗≈A and B∗≈
B, such that
A∩B = φ and A∗∩B∗= φ.
Then A∗∪B∗≈A∪B. Hence
#(A∗∪B∗) = #(A∪B).
Therefore, the sum α + β is well-deﬁned, where α = #(A), β = #(B).
Example 5.1.32 Let A = {2,4,6}, B = {1,3,5,7,9}. Then
α = #(A) = 3, and β = #(B) = 5,
and hence,
3 + 5 = α + β = #{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9} = 8,
since A and B are disjoint.
Example 5.1.33 Let
A = {1,3,5,...},
B = {2,4,6,...}.
Note that #(A) = #(B) = ℵand A∩B = φ. Then
ℵ+ ℵ= #(A∪B)
= #(N)
= ℵ,
implying that
ℵ+ ℵ= ℵ.

Example 5.1.34 Let
S = (0,1) ⊂R,
T = [1,2) ⊂R.
Note that #(S) = #(T) = c and S ∩T = φ. Then
c+ c = #(S ∪T)
= #((0,2))
= c.
Therefore,
c+ c = c.
Theorem 5.1.35 Let α,β, and γ be cardinal numbers. Then
1. (α + β)+ γ = α + (β + γ),
2. α + β = β + α.
Proof
1. Let A,B, and C be mutually disjoint sets, such that
α = #(A),β = #(B) and γ = #(C),
Then
(α + β)+ γ = #(A∪B)+ #(C)
= #((A∪B)∪C)
= #((A∪(B∪C))
= #(A)+ #(B∪C)
= α + (β + γ).
2. If A and B are disjoint sets satisfying
α = #(A) and β = #(B),
then we have
α + β = #(A∪B)
= #(B∪A)
= β + α.
Remark 5.1.36 The cancellation law does not hold on C . For example
ℵ+ ℵ= ℵ= 1 + ℵ,
but ℵ̸= 1 in C .

Now, let’s consider the multiplication (·) on C .
Deﬁnition 5.1.37 Let α and β be cardinal numbers, and let A and B be such that
α = #(A), and β = #(B). Then the product αβ of α and β is deﬁned by
αβ = #(A× B).
Remark 5.1.38 The multiplication is well-deﬁned. Indeed, suppose that A∗≈A and
B∗≈B. Then A∗× B∗≈A× B. So,
#(A∗× B∗) = #(A× B).
This implies that αβ is well-deﬁned.
Note that, different from the addition (+), the multiplication (·) does not need the
disjoint condition by the very deﬁnition of the Cartesian product.
Example 5.1.39 Let A = {2,3,4}, B = {q, p,r,s,t}. Then
α = #(A) = 3,β = #(B) = 5,
and
(3)(5) = αβ = #({2,3,4} × {q, p,r,s,t}) = 15.
Theorem 5.1.40 Let α,β, and γ be cardinal numbers. Then
1. α(βγ) = (αβ)γ,
2. αβ = βα,
3. α(β + γ) = αβ + αγ.
Proof Let A, B, and C be sets satisfying
α = #(A), β = #(B), and γ = #(C).
Then
α (βγ) = #(A× (B×C))
= #(A× B×C)
= #((A× B)×C) = (αβ)γ.
Thus, the ﬁrst formula holds.
Since
A× B ≈B× A,
we have
#(A× B) = αβ = βα = #(B× A),
and hence, the second formula holds.

Cardinality of Sets
147
Let A,B, and C be sets, satisfying
α = #(A),β = #(B), and γ = #(C),
and assume further that the two sets B and C are disjoint. Then
α(β + γ) = #(A)#(B∪C)
= #(A× (B∪C))
= #[(A× B)∪(A×C).
Since B∩C = φ, we have
(A× B)∩(A×C) = φ.
Thus,
α(β + γ) = #(A× B)+ #(A×C)
= αβ + αγ,
implying the third formula.
Recall that a set of all functions from set B to set A is denoted by AB.
Deﬁnition 5.1.41 Let α and β be cardinal numbers, and let A and B be sets satisfying
that α = #(A), and β = #(B). Then the power αβ is deﬁned by
αβ = #
 AB
.
Remark 5.1.42 The power is well-deﬁned on C . Indeed, if A1 ≈A2 and B1 ≈B2,
then AB1
1 ≈AB2
2 . Hence
#

AB1
1

= #(AB2
2 ),
implying that αβ is well-deﬁned in C .
Theorem 5.1.43 Let α,β, and γ be cardinal numbers of C . Then
1. αβαγ = αβ+γ,
2. (αβ)γ = αβγ,
3. αγβ γ = (αβ)γ.
Proof Let A,B, and C be sets, such that
B∩C = φ,
and
α = #(A),β = #(B),γ = #(C).

148
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
Note that
αβ+γ = #(AB∪C), αβαγ = #(AB × AC),
and AB∪C consists of all the functions with domain B∪C and codomain A. Also AB
and AC have the similar meaning. So, it sufﬁces to show
AB∪C ≈AB × AC.
Let f ∈AB∪C corresponds to the ordered pair of functions,
(f|B, f|C).
Note that (f|B, f|C) belongs to AB × AC. The function
F : AB∪C →AB × AC
deﬁned by
F(f) = (f|B, f|C),
is a bijection, because B∩C = φ. Thus,
AB∪C ≈AB × AC.
Therefore, the ﬁrst formula holds.
We leave the proof of the second and third formulas as exercise for the readers.
Recall that if A is a set, the corresponding power set P(A) is deﬁned to be the set
of all subsets of A.
Theorem 5.1.44 If α = #(A) ∈C , then
#(P(A)) = 2α.
Proof We already proved that there exists a bijection between P(A) and 2A. That is,
P(A) ≈2A. Therefore,
#(P(A)) = #(2A) = 2α.
Remark 5.1.45
1. The above theorem can be re-stated by that: #(P(A)) = 2#(A),
for all sets A.
2. Cantor’s theorem tell us that, for any cardinal number α,
α < 2α.
3. ℵ< 2ℵ.
4. 2ℵ= c.

Cardinality of Sets
149
Theorem 5.1.46 On the set C of cardinal numbers, we have
1. ℵℵ= ℵ,
2. ℵc = c,
3. cc = c.
Proof
1. Since N× N is countable,
N× N ≈N.
Therefore, ℵℵ= ℵ.
2. Let f : N× (0,1) →(0,∞) be a function deﬁned by
f(x,y) = x+ y.
It is not difﬁcult to show that f is a bijection. So,
N× (0,1) ≈(0,∞).
Hence, #(N× (0,1)) = #(0,∞). Therefore, ℵc = c.
3. We have cc = #({(x,y) : x,y ∈(0,1)}) and x,y can be written in the digit form
of inﬁnite decimals as follows:
x = 0.x1x2x3 ...,
y = 0.y1y2y3 ....
Note that z = 0.x1y1x2y2 ... is an element in (0,1), too. So we have deﬁned a
one-to-one function,
f : (0,1)× (0,1) →(0,1).
Conversely, one can deﬁne a one-to-one function,
g : (0,1) →(0,1)× (0,1).
So,
(0,1)× (0,1) ≈(0,1).
i.e., we have
#((0,1)× (0,1) = #(0,1).
Therefore, cc = c.

5.1.4
ORDER TYPES
The set C of all cardinal numbers is ordered in the following manner.
Deﬁnition 5.1.47 Let α and β be cardinal numbers. We say that α ≤β, (which is
read α is less than or equal to β), if there exists a one-to-one function f : A →B,
where α = #(A) and β = #(B).
Example 5.1.48 Since N is a proper subset of R,
#(N) = ℵ≤c = #(R).
Furthermore, since N is countable, and R is uncountable,
ℵ< c.
Example 5.1.49 Let A,B, and C be sets, such that
α = #(A),β = #(B),γ = #(C).
If f : A →B is one-to-one, and g : B →C is one-to-one, then g◦f : A →C is one-to-
one. Therefore
if α ≤β, and β ≤γ, then α ≤γ.
Example 5.1.50 For every cardinal number α ∈C ,
α ≤α,
since every set is a subset of itself.
In view of the preceding examples, the following theorem holds true.
Theorem 5.1.51 For cardinal numbers α,β, and γ, the following properties hold:
1. α ≤α (Reﬂexiveness).
2. If α ≤β and β ≤α, then α = β (Anti-symmetry).
3. If α ≤β and β ≤γ, then α ≤γ (Transitivity).
Proof By deﬁnition, for all α ∈C ,
α ≤α in C .
Suppose α,β ∈C , and assume that
α ≤β, and β ≤α.
If α = #(A), and β = #(B), for sets A and B, then the above order relations (or,
inequalities) mean that
f (A) ⊆B, and f −1(B) ⊆A,

Cardinality of Sets
151
where f : A →B is an one-to-one function, and
f −1(B) = {a ∈A | f(a) ∈B}
is the pre image of f. By the one-to-one-ness of f and the second set inclusion, one
can realize that the pre image f −1 (B) is identiﬁed with the range of the inverse
f −1 : B →A, implying that this one-to-one function f is actually a bijection. In other
words,
A ≈B, if and only if #(A) = #(B).
Therefore, two cardinal numbers α and β are identically same in C .
Now, assume that
α ≤β and β ≤γ,
in C . If α = #(A), β = #(B), and γ = #(C) for sets A, B, and C, respectively, then
the above inequalities implies that
f(A) ⊆B and g(B) ⊆C,
for one-to-one functions f : A →B and g : B →C. So, there exists a one-to-one func-
tion,
g ◦f : A →C,
implying that
g ◦f (A) ⊆C.
By the one-to-one-ness of g ◦f, we have
#(A) ≤#(C), if and only if α ≤γ.
5.1.5
MORE ABOUT CARDINAL NUMBERS
In this section, we study more relations between cardinal numbers and cardinalities.
Theorem 5.1.52 (Cantor’s theorem) If A is a set, then
#(A) < #(P(A)).
Proof Let g : A →P(A) be a function deﬁned by
g(a) = {a}.
It is clear that g is one-to-one. Hence
#(A) ≤#(P(A)).
Thus, it is sufﬁcient to show that #(A) ̸= #(P(A)). Suppose #(A) = #(P(A)), that is,
A ≈P(A). Then there exists a function g : A →P(A), which is a bijection. Let
B = {x ∈A : x ̸∈g(x)}.

152
Concise Introduction to Logic and Set Theory
It is clear that B ⊆A, B ∈P(A). Since g is onto P(A), there exists a ∈A such that
g(a) = B. So, if a ∈B, then a ̸∈g(a) = B, meanwhile, if a ̸∈B, then a ∈g(a), which
implies a ∈B. Thus, we obtain contradictions in both possible cases.
It means that there does not exist a bijection between A and P(A), equivalently,
#(A) ̸= #(P(A)). Therefore,
#(A) < #(P(A)).
It is not difﬁcult to check that if a set A is ﬁnite, then
#(A) < 2#(A) = #(P(A)).
Also, by the above theorem, one can have
#(N) = ℵ< c = #(R),
and hence,
#(P(N)) = c = #(R),
implying that the cardinalities of the power sets of inﬁnitely countable sets are identi-
ﬁed with continuum c, and they are understood to be the cardinalities of uncountable
sets. Equivalently, that
2ℵ= c,
in set C of all cardinal numbers.
Lemma 5.1.53 Let A be a subset of a set B, and let f : B →A be one-to-one function.
Then, for each X ⊆(B−A), there exists a bijection,
f0 : B →A∪X.
Proof Let f1 : X →X be a function satisfying
f1(X) = X,
and let f2 : X →A be a function satisfying
f2(X) = f(f1(X)).
Deﬁne fi+1 : X →A by functions satisfying the recurrence relation,
fi+1(X) = f(fi(X)), i = 1,2,...,n.
Let
C =
∞
[
i=1
fi(X).
It is clear that C = f(C)∪X. Now, deﬁne the function
f0 : B →A∪X by

Cardinality of Sets
153
f0(b) =
(
b,
if b ∈C,
f(b),
if b ∈B−C.
The function f0 is onto, since
f0(B) = f0(C ∪(B−C))
= f0(C)∪f0(B−C)
= C ∪f(B−C)
= X ∪F(C)∪f(B−C)
= X ∪f(B)
= X ∪A.
Also f0 is one-to-one, because f0|C and f0|B−C are one-to-one functions.
In addition,
f0(C)∩f0(B−C) = φ.
Therefore, the function f0 : B →A∪X is a bijection.
Theorem 5.1.54 (Schr¨oder–Bernstein) Let A and B be sets. If A is equipotent to a
subset of B, and B is equipotent to a subset of A, then
A ≈B.
Proof Let g : A →B1 be a bijection, where B1 ⊆B, and h : B →A1 a bijection, where
A1 ⊆A. Then the function
(g ◦h) : B →(g ◦h)(B)
is a bijection.
Let S = B1 −(g ◦h)(B). Then, by the above lemma, there exists a bijection be-
tween B and B1, where
B1 = (g ◦h)(B)∪S.
Hence
B ≈B1,
but B1 ≈A. Consequently A ≈B.
Corollary 5.1.55 If α, β∈C are cardinal numbers, then
if α ≤β and β ≤α, then α = β.
Proof The proof is done by the very above theorem.

AXIOM OF CHOICE
In 1954, Zermelo clariﬁes that there is an axiom that is used implicitly in mathemat-
ics. This axiom, called the axiom of choice, is not derived from any previous axioms
in mathematics. We here emphasize that there are “many” “equivalent” forms, or
statements, of the axiom of choice in various different mathematics ﬁelds. The read-
ers can ﬁnd different expressions of this axiom in many different texts. All of those
equivalent forms of “the” axiom of choice say the same meaning:
we can choose certain elements in sets.
Here, we introduce the following form of the axiom of choice.
The Axiom of Choice. If {Ai}i∈I is a family of nonempty sets, then there exists a
function,
f : I →
[
i∈I
Ai,
such that f(i) ∈Ai, ∀i ∈I.
It is clear that, if the index set I≈Nk is a ﬁnite set for some k ∈N, then one can
choose a1 ∈A1, a2 ∈A2, ..., ak ∈Ak. While, if I is an inﬁnite set, then the axiom
will be opaque.
Deﬁnition 5.2.1 Let A be a set and let
P′(A) = P(A)−{φ}.
The function f : P′(A) →A, given by
f(B) ∈B,∀B ∈P′(A),
is called a choice function. Sometimes, we write fB instead of f(B).
Such a choice function f is well-deﬁned by the axiom of choice. That is, one can
choose f(b) as an element of B, for b ∈B, and for all B ∈P(A).
Example 5.2.2 Let A = {a,b}. As an example of the choice function on A, we
present a function,
f : P′(A) →A,
where
f({a,b}) = a,
f({a}) = a,
f({b}) = b.
