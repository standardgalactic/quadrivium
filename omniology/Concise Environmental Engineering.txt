Environmental engineering is the application of science and engineering principles to protect and 
utilise natural resources, control environmental pollution, improve environmental quality to enable 
healthy ecosystems and comfortable habitation of humans. It is based on multiple disciplines including 
geology, hydrology, biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, engineering, management, economics, law, etc. 
Environmental engineering involves water supply, pollution control, recycling, waste (solid and liquid) 
disposal, radiation protection, industrial hygiene, environmental sustainability, and public health. This 
is an introductory book on environmental engineering and written for undergraduate students in civil 
and environmental engineering, chemical engineering, environmental science and geography. The aim of 
this book is to provide a concise and comprehensive coverage on environmental engineering. The book 
content covers the fundamental concepts/theories and their applications in environmental engineering. 
The key subjects include environment (natural and built environments), ecosystems (energy flow, nutrient 
cycles, biodiversity and ecosystem services), sustainability (key issues and activities), remote sensing of 
environment (electromagnetic radiation, sensors, data process and applications), environmental risk 
(hazards, risk perception, risk assessment, risk management, and environmental impact assessment),

Introduction
1	 Introduction
1.1	
Environment
The ‘Environment’ has different meanings in different disciplines. In environmental engineering, the 
environment is where we live. It is divided into two types: natural environment and built environment. 
The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally in the area 
(Figure 1.1). The built environment refers to the human-made surroundings that provide the setting 
for human activity (e.g., buildings, parks, cities and supporting infrastructure such as transport, water 
supply and energy supply) as shown in Figure 1.2. Modern remote sensing technology has made it easy 
for us to explore the natural and built environment in our surrounding areas and online mapping tools 
such as Google Earth are convenient facilities for us to view anywhere on the Earth (even to view many 
challenging places by foot such as the Everest). It should be noted that nowadays it is difficult to find 
absolutely natural environments (i.e., the wilderness, that has not been modified by human activity), 
and it is common that the naturalness varies in a scale, from ideally 100% natural in one extreme to 0% 
natural in the other (e.g., intensive farmland).

Introduction
Figure 1.2 Built environment, Bristol, England (Google Earth)
There are four spheres on the Earth that are of interest to environmental engineering, which are referred 
to as the lithosphere (the rigid outermost shell of the earth), the hydrosphere (water on, under, and over 
the surface of the Earth), the atmosphere (a layer of gases surrounding the Earth), and the biosphere (sum 
of living organisms on the Earth). They are combined to become the ecosphere and can be remembered 
easily as corresponding to rocks, water, air, and life.
1.2	
Human and Environment
Human society and the environment interact with each other. Human impacts (i.e., anthropogenic 
impacts) on the environment refer to the impacts of human activities on biophysical environments, 
biodiversity and other resources. Those activities include agricultural practices (deforestation, genetically 
modified food, agricultural chemicals, soil degradation, agricultural plastics), fishing (overfishing, 
ecological disruption, by-catch), irrigation (soil salination, reduced river discharge, evaporation, withdraw 
of groundwater, drainage), livestock production (pollution, fossil fuels, water and land consumption), 
energy industry (climate change, biofuel use, fossil fuel use, electricity generation, renewable energy), 
manufacturing (cleaning agents, nanotechnology, paint, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care 
products), mining (erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, contamination of soil, contamination of 
groundwater and surface water), transport (use of fossil fuels, air pollution, emission of carbon dioxide, 
traffic congestion, invasion of natural habitat and agricultural lands).

Introduction
On the other hand, the natural environment and built environment can also affect human health. The 
World Health Organization defines environmental health as those aspects of the human health and disease 
that are determined by factors in the environment. The impacts of environment on human health include 
both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the indirect 
effects on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment 
(e.g., housing, urban development, land use and transport).

Environmental Engineering
Environmental engineering is the application of science and engineering principles to protect and 
utilise natural resources, control environmental pollution, improve environmental quality to enable 
healthy ecosystems and comfortable habitation of humans. It is based on multiple disciplines including 
geology, hydrology, biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, engineering, management, economics, 
law, etc. Environmental engineering activities involve water supply, waste water management, solid 
waste management, air pollution control, noise pollution control, radiation protection, environmental 
sustainability, public health issues, environmental impact assessment, hazardous-waste management, 
treatment of contaminated land, hazard prevention and mitigation, climate change adaptation and 
mitigation, renewable energy, etc. At many universities, environmental engineering programs follow 
either civil engineering or chemical engineering in engineering faculties with a diverse subject such as 
hydrology, water resources management, bioremediation, water treatment plant design, environmental 
chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies and separation processes.

Ecosystems
2	 Ecosystems
An ecosystem is a community of living (biotic) organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in conjunction 
with the nonliving components (abiotic) of their environment (air, water and mineral soil), interacting 
as a system. Ecosystems are a biological community and its physical environment, and come in various 
sizes from limited spaces to the entire planet. Ecosystems are dynamic with networks of interactions 
among organisms, between organisms and their environment. They are linked together through nutrient 
cycle and energy flow. Ecosystems are controlled both by external factors (climate, the parent material 
which forms the soil and topography) and internal factors (decomposition, root competition or shading, 
disturbance, succession and types of species). 
Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services to human society. It is important for environmental 
engineers to recognise and understand a wide range of ecosystem services in environmental engineering 
activities (e.g., in order to meet the drinking water standard, it may be more cost-effective for a water 
utility to invest in natural capital to improve the ecosystems of water sources than building an expensive 
new water filtration plant).
2.1	
Energy Flow
Living organisms require two things from the environment: energy to provide power and nutrients to 
provide substance. Energy flow, also called the calorific flow, refers to the flow of energy through a food 
chain. The Sun is responsible for virtually all of the Earth’ energy, which constantly gives the planet 
energy in the form of light while it is eventually used and lost in the form of heat throughout the trophic 
levels of a food web. The flow of energy in an ecosystem is an open system (i.e., it does not cycle and is 
converted to heat and lost for useful purposes forever).
The trophic (derived from the Greek referring to food) level of an organism is the position it occupies 
in a food chain. Based on the way to get food, organisms are classified as producers, consumers and 
decomposers. Producers (autotrophs) are typically plants or algae that do not usually eat other organisms, 
but pull nutrients from the soil or the ocean and manufacture their own food using photosynthesis 
powered by solar energy. An exception occurs in deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems with no sunlight 
and chemosynthesis is used by organisms to make food. Since they are at the lowest trophic level, they 
are called primary producers. Higher up on the food chain, consumers (heterotrophs) are animals which 
cannot manufacture their own food and need to consume other organisms. Animals that eat primary 
producers (like plants) are called herbivores and animals that eat other animals are called carnivores, and 
animals that eat both plant and other animals are called omnivores. Decomposers (detritivores, such as 
bacteria and fungi) break down dead plants and animals and their wastes as energy and nutrients into 
the ecosystem for recycling.

Ecosystems
There are five trophic levels. Decomposers are often left off food webs and trophic levels, but if included, 
they mark the end of a food chain.
Level 1: Plants and algae are primary producers
Level 2: Herbivores are primary consumers
Level 3: Carnivores are secondary consumers if they eat herbivores
Level 4: Carnivores are tertiary consumers if they eat other carnivores
Level 5: Apex predators are at the top of the food chain if they have no predators
A general energy flow in ecosystems starts with fixation of solar energy by photoautotrophs (i.e., primary 
producers). Primary consumers (i.e., herbivores) absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through 
digestion, and transform it into the form of energy they need through respiration. The received energy 
is stored as body mass with some converted to body heat radiated away and some lost by the expulsion 
of undigested food via excretion or regurgitation. Secondary consumers (carnivores) then consume the 
primary consumers and absorb the energy embodied in the primary consumers through the process of 
digestion. As with primary consumers, some energy is lost from the system. There may be higher level 
consumers to repeat the processes further on. A final link in the food chain is decomposers which break 
down the organic matter of the dead consumers (at all levels) and the undigested food excreted by the 
consumers, and release nutrients into the environment.

Ecosystems
Energy transfer between trophic levels is generally inefficient with about 90% energy lost for each transfer. 
Generally, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary 
consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a food chain 
receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain’s energy has been lost to the environment instead 
of being absorbed between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to 
only four to six links.
2.2	
Nutrient Cycles
Nutrient cycle is the movement and exchange of organic and inorganic matter back into the production 
of living matter. It is a part of larger biogeochemical cycles involving macros nutrients (such as carbon, 
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur, etc.) and micros nutrients (iron, copper, sodium, etc.) —the 
important chemicals used as nutrients in ecosystems by living organisms. In contrast to the energy flow, 
the nutrient flow is a part of a closed system and these chemicals are recycled and replenished constantly 
instead of being lost. The chemicals are sometimes held for long periods of time in one place called a 
reservoir (e.g., coal deposits with carbon), or are held for only short periods of time in exchange pools 
(e.g., plants and animals). In this section, only some key macros nutrients are described because they 
play an essentials role in ecosystems.
2.2.1	
Oxygen Cycle
The Oxygen cycle describes the movement of oxygen within its three main reservoirs: biosphere (the 
smallest of the three reservoirs with an average residence time of 50 years), atmosphere (it is 100 times 
of the oxygen mass in the biosphere with an average residence time of 4500 years), and lithosphere (it 
is 200 times of the oxygen mass in the atmosphere, the largest reservoir with an average residence time 
of 500 million years). Therefore, 99.5% of oxygen is stored in the lithosphere, 0.5% in the atmosphere 
and only 0.005% in the biosphere.
The gain of oxygen in the atmosphere is driven mainly by the Sun through photosynthesis (55% by 
land plants and 45% by ocean phytoplankton). The losses of atmospheric oxygen are mainly by aerobic 
respiration at 77% (consumed by animals and bacteria), microbial oxidation 17%, fossil fuel combustion 
4%, and photochemical oxidation 2%.

2.2.2	
Carbon Cycle
The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon within its main reservoirs: atmosphere, hydrosphere 
(oceans), lithosphere and biosphere. The lithosphere has the largest store of carbon (it collects its carbon 
from the atmosphere by the accumulated dead life form and releases its carbon by either slow geological 
movement or fast combustion as fuel by humans). Oceans are the 2nd largest reservoir for carbon (mainly 
in inorganic form). The biosphere on land has a much smaller carbon store (a small fraction of that in 
oceans) and the atmosphere has the smallest carbon store (about 1/3 of the biosphere). The ocean plays 
a vital role in the Earth’s carbon cycle, but it is the increasing carbon in the atmosphere that is of major 
concern in modern times due to the burning of fossil fuels (Figure 2.1). 
Figure 2.1 Carbon Cycle (NASA, http://science.nasa.gov)
In the past two centuries, human activities have seriously altered the global carbon cycle, most significantly 
in the atmosphere. Carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere exists in two main forms: carbon dioxide and 
methane. Both of these gases are partially responsible for the greenhouse effect. Methane produces a large 
greenhouse effect per volume as compared to carbon dioxide, but it exists in much lower concentrations 
and is more short-lived than carbon dioxide, making carbon dioxide the more important greenhouse gas 
of the two. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is approximately 392 ppmv 
(parts per million by volume) as of 2011 and rose by 2.0 ppmv/yr (Figure 2.2). The current concentration 
is substantially higher than the 280 ppmv concentration in preindustrial times, with the increase largely 
attributed to anthropogenic sources. There is an annual fluctuation of about 3–9 ppmv which roughly 
follows the Northern Hemisphere’s growing season.

Ecosystems
In the biosphere, carbon is mainly absorbed in the form of carbon dioxide by plants. Carbon is also 
released from the biosphere into the atmosphere in the course of biological processes. Aerobic respiration 
converts organic carbon into carbon dioxide and anaerobic respiration converts it into methane. After 
respiration, both carbon dioxide and methane are typically emitted into the atmosphere. Organic carbon 
is also released into the atmosphere via burning. While organic matter in animals generally decays 
quickly, releasing much of its carbon into the atmosphere through respiration, carbon stored as dead 
plant matter can stay in the biosphere for as much as a decade or more. Different plant types of plant 
matter decay at different rates (for example, woody substances retain their carbon longer than soft, leafy 
material). Active carbon in soils can stay sequestered for up to a thousand years, while inert carbon in 
soils can stay sequestered for more than a millennium.
2.2.3	
Nitrogen Cycle
The nitrogen cycle is the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various chemical forms 
(Figure 2.3). Nitrogen is required to biosynthesise basic building blocks of plants, animals and other life 
forms (e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA and amino acids for proteins). Important processes in the 
nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. 
Figure 2.3 Nitrogen cycle (Wikipedia ‘Nitrogen cycle’)

Concise Environmental Engineering
19 
Ecosystems
Although 78% of the air is nitrogen, atmospheric nitrogen (N2) must be processed or “fixed” into ammonia 
(NH3) to be used by plants. Some fixation occurs in lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-
living or symbiotic bacteria. When a plant or animal dies, or an animal expels waste, the initial form of 
nitrogen is organic. Bacteria (or fungi in some cases) convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back 
into ammonium (NH4+), a process called ammonification or mineralisation. Nitrification is a two-step 
process with the biological oxidation of ammonia (with oxygen) into nitrite followed by the oxidation 
of these nitrites into nitrates (by two types of organisms that exist in most environment). Nitrification 
is important in agricultural systems, where fertiliser is often applied as ammonia. Denitrification is 
the reduction of nitrates back into the largely inert nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. 
Nitrification (together denitrification) also plays an important role in the removal of nitrogen from 
municipal wastewater. 
Human impact on the nitrogen cycle is diverse. Agricultural and industrial nitrogen inputs to the 
environment currently exceed inputs from natural nitrogen fixation and the global nitrogen cycle has 
been significantly altered over the past century. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of 
artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global 
nitrogen cycle.
2.2.4	
Phosphorus Cycle
The phosphorus cycle describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, 
and biosphere. Unlike many other biogeochemical cycles, the atmosphere does not play a significant 
role in the movement of phosphorus, because phosphorus does not enter the atmosphere and remains 
mostly as solid salts on land (in rock and soil minerals). Weathering of rocks carries these phosphates 
to terrestrial habitats. Plants absorb phosphates from the soil and then are consumed by herbivores that 
in turn may be consumed by carnivores. After death, the animal or plant decays to return phosphates 
to the soil. Runoff may carry them back to the ocean to be reincorporated into rock. The processes that 
move them through the soil or ocean are very slow, making the phosphorus cycle overall one of the 
slowest biogeochemical cycles.
 Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals in the form of ions and is a limiting nutrient 
for aquatic organisms. Human interference in the phosphorus cycle occurs by overuse or careless use of 
phosphorus fertilisers, which results in phosphorus as pollutants in bodies of water with eutrophication 
consequences.

2.2.5	
Sulphur Cycle
The sulphur cycle is similar to the nitrogen cycle in that microbial processes control which form of 
sulphur appears in the natural environment. The most oxidised form of sulphur is sulphate which is the 
form most readily assimilated by plants to be reduced into organic sulphur. Sulphur is a key component 
in proteins, amino acids and B vitamins of plants and animals. Once plants and animals die, bacteria 
turn organic sulphur into reduced sulphide (H2S) and then into sulphate to complete the cycle.
2.3	
Eutrophication
Eutrophication (Greek: eutrophia—adequate nutrition) is the ecosystem response to excess nutrients that 
stimulate excessive plant growth. The nutrients are mainly nitrates and phosphates which are human-
caused (e.g., fertiliser, untreated sewage effluent) or natural (depositional environments). Excessive plant 
growth and decay favour simple algae and plankton over other more complicated plants and cause a 
severe reduction in water quality Enhanced growth of aquatic vegetation or phytoplankton and algal 
blooms disrupts normal functioning of the ecosystem, causing a variety of problems such as a lack of 
oxygen needed for fish and shellfish to survive. The water becomes cloudy, typically coloured in a shade 
of green, yellow, brown, or red (Figure 2.4). Some algal blooms are toxic to plants and animals, and 
interfere with drinking water treatment.

Ecosystems
The nutrients come from two types of sources: point source (a single identifiable source) and nonpoint 
source (diffuse sources varying spatially). Point sources are relatively easy to regulate compared with 
nonpoint sources. Nutrients from human activities tend to travel from land to either surface water or 
ground water. Nitrogen in particular moves through storm drains, sewage pipes, and other forms of 
surface runoff. Modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to 
maximise production. However, farmers frequently apply more nutrients than the amount taken up by 
crops or pastures. Nutrients tend to accumulate in soils and remain there for years. Phosphorus lost to 
surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil. Nitrogen, similarly, has a 
turnover time of decades or more. Ploughing in agriculture and other developments are activities that 
contribute most to nutrient loading. In addition, nitrogen is released into the air because of ammonia 
volatilisation and nitrous oxide production. The combustion of fossil fuels is a large human-initiated 
contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution. Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of acid rain) 
can also affect nutrient concentration in water. In modeling eutrophication, the rate of water renewal 
plays a critical role because stagnant water is able to collect more nutrients. The drying of wetlands could 
also cause an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms.

Biodiversity
Biodiversity is the degree of variation of life forms at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, 
organismic, population, species and ecosystem) and is used to measure the health of ecosystems. 
Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution. The fossil record suggests that the last few 
million years feature the greatest biodiversity in history based on fossil record analysis (Figure 2.5). 
Since life began on the Earth, five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large 
and sudden drops in biodiversity. It is found that biodiversity appears to increase continually in the 
recent Earth history. However, most biologists agree that the period since human emergence is part of 
a new mass extinction, named the Holocene extinction event, caused primarily by the impact humans 
on the environment via the acronym HIPPO (Habitat destruction, Invasive species, Pollution, human 
over Population, and Over-harvesting). 
Figure 2.5 Apparent marine fossil diversity in the last 540 million years 
(Wikipedia ‘Biodiversity’)
Biological diversity can be quantified in many different ways. The two main factors taken into account 
when measuring diversity are richness and evenness. Richness is a measure of the number of different 
kinds of organisms in a particular area. The more species present in a sample, the ‘richer’ the sample 
is. Evenness is a measure of the relative abundance of the different species making up the richness of 
an area. In practice, several diversity indices have been used to measure biodiversity, such as Shannon 
index, Simpson index, etc. Accurately measuring biodiversity can be difficult. 
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed because of variations in temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, 
geography and the presence of other species. Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles 
to the tropics (i.e., latitudinal gradient in species diversity) mainly due to the greater mean temperature 
at the equator compared with that of the poles. There are also biodiversity hotspots around the world 
which are regions with a high level of endemic species (the majority are forest areas and most are located 
in the tropics).

Ecosystems
Human society benefits from healthy biodiversity which supports ecosystem services including air quality, 
climate (e.g., CO2 sequestration), water purification, pollination, and prevention of erosion. There are 
many measures that could be used to protect and restore rich biodiversity, such as removal of exotic 
species, reintroduction of the lost species, biodiversity banking, reduction of pesticide usage, wildlife 
corridors, resource allocation, etc. 
2.5	
Ecosystem Services
Ecosystem services are the benefits to human society from a multitude of resources (e.g., food, water) 
and processes (e.g., decomposition of wastes) supplied by natural ecosystems. Ecosystem services are 
divided into four categories: 1) provisioning services: food, water, timber, minerals, pharmaceuticals, 
biochemicals, industrial products, energy (hydropower, biomass fuels); 2) regulating services: control of 
climate by carbon sequestration, waste decomposition and detoxification, purification of water and air, 
pest and disease control, erosion prevention; 3) supporting services: nutrient dispersal and cycling, seed 
dispersal, crop pollination, primary production; 4) cultural services: cultural, intellectual and spiritual 
inspiration, recreation, scientific discovery.

Ecosystems
Society is increasingly dependent on ecosystem services which are not only limited but also threatened 
by human activities. Understanding of ecosystem services requires a sound understanding on underlying 
principles, and interactions of organisms and the environment. Since the scales at which these entities 
interact can vary from microbes to landscapes, milliseconds to millions of years, it is a major challenge 
to describe and predict energy and material flow in the ecosystems. The research steps involved include 
1) identification of ecosystem service providers (ESPs) – species or populations that provide specific 
ecosystem services – and characterisation of their functional roles and relationships; 2) determination of 
community structure aspects that influence how ESPs function in their natural landscape; 3) assessment 
of key environmental (abiotic) factors influencing the provision of services; and 4) measurement of the 
spatial and temporal scales ESPs and their services operate on.
Many efforts to inform decision-makers of current versus future costs and benefits involve organising 
and translating scientific knowledge to economics, which articulate the consequences of different choices 
in comparable units of impacts on human well-being. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem 
services in monetary terms are: 1) avoided cost: services allow society to avoid costs that would have 
been incurred in the absence of those services (e.g. wastewater treatment by wetland); 2) replacement 
cost: services could be replaced with man-made systems (e.g. restoration of a catchment costs less than 
the construction of a water purification plant); 3) factor income: services provide for the enhancement 
of incomes (e.g. improved water quality increases the commercial take of a fishery and improves the 
income of fishers); 4) travel cost: service demand may require travel, whose costs can reflect the implied 
value of the service (e.g. value of ecotourism experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get 
there); 5) hedonic pricing: service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated 
goods (e.g. coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes); 6) contingent valuation: service demand 
may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios involving some valuation of alternatives (e.g. visitors 
willing to pay for increased access to national parks). 
Several newly developed tools and methodologies may help evaluate and assess ecosystem services. 
These include ‘Our Ecosystem’, the Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (ESR), Artificial Intelligence 
for Ecosystem Services (ARIES), the Natural Value Initiative (NVI) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation 
of Ecosystem Services & Tradeoffs). The valuation of ecosystem services helps policy implementation 
and management. Human society suffers from the so-called ‘tragedy of the commons’ and effective 
administration of common pool resources is crucial to prevent further degradation of the ecosystems. 
Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently 
work from valid but incomplete information. Payment and trading of services is an emerging solution 
where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration 
sources or the restoration of ecosystem service providers.

3.1	
What is Sustainability?
Sustainability is the capacity to endure. For human society, “sustainable development is development that 
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs”. It requires the reconciliation of environmental, social equity and economic demands - the “three 
pillars” of sustainability or (the 3 E’s) as shown in Figure 3.1. The three pillars are the “triple bottom 
line” served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in 
recent years.
Figure 3.1 Sustainability and its three pillars (Wikipedia ‘Sustainability’)
Sustainability measurement is the metrics used as the quantitative basis for the informed management 
of sustainability. Measurement of sustainability is very diverse and still evolving, including resource 
use like life cycle assessment, consumption like the ecological footprint and quality of environmental 
governance like the Environmental Performance Index. 
A life-cycle assessment (LCA, also known as life-cycle analysis) is a technique to assess environmental 
impacts associated with all the stages of a product’s life from-cradle-to-grave (i.e., from raw material 
extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and 
disposal or recycling). LCA can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental concerns by compiling 
an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases, evaluating the potential 
impacts associated with identified inputs and releases and interpreting the results to help more informed 
decision makings.

The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth’s ecosystems. Ecological footprint 
analysis compares human demand on the nature with the biosphere’s ability to regenerate resources and 
provide services. It does this by assessing the biologically productive land and marine area required to 
produce the resources a population consumes and absorb the corresponding waste, using prevailing 
technology. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than 
is available within its territory. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying 
capacity and over-consumption, with the aim of altering personal behaviour. Carry capacity is linked 
to resources limitations and is the upper limit to population or community size imposed through 
environmental resistance. As described in the book ‘The Limits to Growth’, society in the past has ‘evolved 
around the principle of fighting against limits rather than learning to live with them’. The ecological 
footprint helps people realise there is a limit to resources. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that 
many current lifestyles are not sustainable. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities 
of resource use on this planet (Figure 3.2).
The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is a method of quantifying and numerically benchmarking 
the environmental performance of a country’s policies. This index was developed from the Pilot 
Environmental Performance Index, first published in 2002, and designed to supplement the environmental 
targets set forth in the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. It considers water, air, productive natural 
resources, forestry, fisheries, agriculture, biodiversity, habitat and climate change.

Issues Relevant to Sustainability 
3.2.1	
Population Growth
The current global population of 7 billion (2012) is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 (Figure 3.3). 
The population growth is one of the grand challenges for sustainable development since an increasing 
population places additional strain on natural resources. Currently, most population growth occurs in 
the developing world and population is more or less stagnant in the industrialised world. The economic 
development is linked with the quality of life. As the pattern of population growth shows, the rate of 
population growth has a negative correlation to the economic development. Therefore, population 
growth could be stabilised by improving quality of life. However, improvement in quality of life and 
economic development has closely linked with enhanced consumption and associated depletion and 
environmental degradation.

Urbanisation
Urbanisation is the physical growth of urban areas as a result of rural migration. Currently, there are 
more people living in urban areas than in rural areas. The trend of urbanisation will continue in the 
foreseeable future (Figure 3.4). Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement 
of Homo erectus out of Africa across Eurasia about a million years ago. Homo sapiens appear to have 
occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread 
across Australia, Asia and Europe by 40,000 years BC. Early humans migrated due to many factors 
such as changing climate and landscape and inadequate food supply. While the pace of migration had 
accelerated since the 18th century (including the involuntary slave trade), it increased further in the 
19th century. Nowadays, urbanisation is the major type of human migration.

Cities are known to be places where money, services (e.g., hospitals, universities, theatres) and wealth 
are centralised. Businesses, which provide jobs and services, are more concentrated in urban areas. 
Many rural inhabitants come to the city for reasons of seeking jobs, fortunes and social mobility. In 
rural areas, it has traditionally been difficult to access modern facilities and farm living has always been 
susceptible to unpredictable environmental conditions (drought, flood or pestilence). Village culture in 
rural areas is characterised by common bloodlines, intimate relationships, and communal behaviour 
whereas urban culture is characterised by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations, and competitive 
behaviour. Pollution and lack of vegetation, especially trees, can cause urban areas to suffer from poor 
environment. Historically, many large European cities are divided into a ‘good’ west and a ‘poor’ east due 
to the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, 
making the western edges of cities preferable to the eastern ones.
3.2.3	
Water
Water resources are useful or potentially useful sources of water. Uses of water include agricultural, 
industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. Virtually all of these human uses require 
fresh water. 97% of the water on the Earth is salt water and only three percent is fresh water. Slightly over 
two thirds of fresh water is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen fresh water is 
found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air (Figure 3.5).

The term “water footprint” is often used to refer to the amount of water used by an individual, community, 
business, or nation. It is defined as the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services 
consumed by the individual or community or produced by the business. Water use is measured in water 
volume consumed (evaporated) and/or polluted per unit of time. A water footprint can be calculated for 
any well-defined group of consumers (e.g., an individual, family, village, city, province, state or nation) 
or producers (e.g., a public organisation, private enterprise or economic sector). The water footprint is 
a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the 
locations. A water footprint consists of three components: blue, green, and grey. The blue water footprint 
is the volume of fresh water that evaporated from the global blue water resources (surface water and 
ground water) to produce the goods and services consumed by the individual or community. The green 
water footprint is the volume of water evaporated from the global green water resources (rainwater stored 
in the soil as soil moisture). The grey water footprint is the volume of polluted water that associates with 
the production of all goods and services for the individual or community. The latter can be estimated as 
the volume of water that is required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water 
remains at or above agreed water quality standards.
However, the water footprint does not provide information on how the embedded water negatively 
or positively affects local water resources, ecosystems and livelihoods. Virtual water (also known as 
embedded water, embodied water, or hidden water) refers, in the context of trade, to the water used in 
the production of a good or service.

Fresh water is a renewable resource, yet the world’s supply of clean, fresh water is steadily decreasing. 
Water demand already exceeds supply in many parts of the world and as the world population continues 
to rise, so too does the water demand. Water scarcity is a situation where there is insufficient water to 
satisfy normal human requirements, which are defined by the World Health Organisation as a water 
source with 20L/person/day within 1km distance. A country is defined as experiencing water stress when 
its annual water supplies drop below 1700m3/person. If the annual water supplies drop below 1000 m3/
person, the country is defined as water scarce. Water is expected to be a source of both tension and 
cooperation in the future. There are more than 215 major rivers and 300 groundwater aquifers shared 
by two or more countries. Finding sustainable solutions to water infrastructure problems is a huge 
challenge for engineers.
3.2.4	
Energy
In the context of human society, the word energy is used as a synonym of energy resources, and most 
often refers to substances like fuels, petroleum products and electricity in general. The use of energy 
has been a key in the development of the human society by helping it to control and adapt to the 
environment. Managing the use of energy is inevitable in any functional society. In the industrialised 
world the development of energy resources has become essential for agriculture, transportation, waste 
collection, information technology, communications that have become prerequisites of a developed 
society. The increasing use of energy since the Industrial Revolution has also brought with it a number 
of serious problems, some of which, such as global warming, present potentially grave risks to the world.
Primary energy is an energy form found in nature that has not been subjected to any conversion or 
transformation process. It is energy contained in raw fuels, and other forms of energy received as 
input to a system. Primary energy can be non-renewable or renewable. Examples of sources include 
nonrenewables (fossil fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and mineral fuels such as natural uranium) and 
renewable (solar, wind, water, biomass, geothermal). Primary energy sources are transformed in energy 
conversion processes to more convenient forms of energy (that can directly be used by society), such as 
electrical energy, refined fuels, or synthetic fuels such as hydrogen fuel. In the field of energetics, these 
forms are called energy carriers and correspond to the concept of “secondary energy” in energy statistics. 
Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy 
sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind.

Green Engineering
For engineers, sustainable engineering is the design of man-made systems to ensure the current uses of 
natural resources do not lead to diminished quality of life of future generations. For engineers, ‘design’ is 
the key word’ here. Green engineering is to design, discover and implement engineering solutions with 
an awareness of potential benefits and problems in terms of environment, economy and society (three 
pillars of sustainability) throughout the design lifetime. The goal is to minimise adverse impacts (e.g., 
water use inefficiency, depletion of finite materials and energy resources, urban congestion, water and 
air pollution, degradation of environment) while simultaneously maximising benefits to the economy, 
society and environment.
The principles of green engineering as outlined by Anastas and Zimmerman) include
1.	 Inherent Rather Than Circumstantial (Designers need to strive to ensure that all materials 
and energy inputs and outputs are as inherently nonhazardous as possible);
2.	 Prevention Instead of Treatment (It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste 
after it is formed);
3.	 Design for Separation (Separation and purification operations should be designed to 
minimise energy consumption and materials use);
4.	 Maximise Efficiency (Products, processes, and systems should be designed to maximise 
mass, energy, space, and time efficiency);
5.	 Output-Pulled Versus Input-Pushed (Products, processes, and systems should be “output 
pulled” rather than “input pushed” through the use of energy and materials);
6.	 Conserve Complexity (Embedded entropy and complexity must be viewed as an investment 
when making design choices on recycle, reuse, or beneficial disposition);
7.	 Durability Rather Than Immortality (Targeted durability, not immortality, should be a 
design goal);
8.	 Meet Need, Minimise Excess (Design for unnecessary capacity or capability (e.g., “one size 
fits all”) solutions should be considered a design flaw);
9.	 Minimise Material Diversity (Material diversity in multicomponent products should be 
minimised to promote disassembly and value retention);
10.	Integrate Material and Energy Flows (Design of products, processes, and systems must 
include integration and interconnectivity with available energy and materials flows);
11.	Design for Commercial “Afterlife” (Products, processes, and systems should be designed for 
performance in a commercial “afterlife”);
12.	Renewable Rather Than Depleting (Material and energy inputs should be renewable rather 
than depleting).

Climate change concerns, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, and increasing government support, are 
driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialisation. The incentive to use 
100% renewable energy is gaining momentum among many countries. The first country to propose 100% 
renewable energy was Iceland, in 1998. Proposals have been made for Japan in 2003, and for Australia 
in 2011. Norway and some other countries have already obtained all of their electricity from renewable 
sources. A predicted growth for wind and solar energy is illustrated in Figure 3.6.

Figure 3.6 Growth of wind and solar power (Wikipedia ‘Renewable energy’)
In contrast to energy production, energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy 
consumption. Energy conservation can be achieved through increased efficient energy use, in conjunction 
with decreased energy consumption and/or reduced consumption from conventional energy sources. 
In building designs, windows, walls, and floors are made to collect, store, and distribute solar energy 
in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design 
or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn’t involve the use of mechanical 
and electrical devices. The key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local 
climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, 
thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, 
but existing buildings can be adapted or “retrofitted”.
A zero-energy building (also known as a zero net energy (ZNE) building, Net-Zero Energy Building 
(NZEB), or Net Zero Building) is a popular term to describe a building with zero net energy consumption 
and zero carbon emissions annually. Zero energy buildings can be independent from the energy 
grid supply. Energy can be harvested on-site—usually through a combination of energy producing 
technologies like Solar and Wind—while reducing the overall use of energy with extremely efficient 
HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and Lighting technologies. The zero-energy design 
principle is becoming more practical to adopt due to the increasing costs of traditional fossil fuels and 
their negative impact on the planet’s climate and ecological balance. A building approaching zero net 
energy use may be called a “near-zero energy building” or “ultra-low energy house”. Buildings that produce 
a surplus of energy during a portion of the year may be known as “energy-plus buildings”.

The built environment (buildings, roads, bridges and other infrastructures) requires a tremendous 
amount of energy, as well as water and other natural resources. Embodied Energy is the sum of all the 
energy required to produce goods or services, considered as if that energy is incorporated or ‘embodied’ 
in the product itself. The concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or 
energy-saving devices. The embedded energy in concrete has a significant impact on construction energy 
flows. The transport of aggregates and cement to construction site accounts for more than 10 percent of 
the total embedded energy. In addition, production of 1 kg of Portland cement generates 1 kg of CO2.
3.3.3	
Resources Management
Human society development depends on natural resources (air, water, forest, minerals, etc.) because 
human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live. Sustainability implies that rather 
than competing for endless growth on a finite planet, development should improve quality of human 
life without necessarily having to consume more resources. Environmental resources management 
aims to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and maintained for equitable use by future human 
generations, and ecosystem integrity should be maintained as an end in itself by considering ethical, 
economic, and scientific (ecological) variables. Environmental resource management should identify the 
conflicting factors that may rise between meeting the needs and protecting the resources. Environmental 
resource management involves the management of all components of the biophysical environment, both 
living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic). This is due to the interconnection and interdependence amongst 
all living species and their habitats. The essential aspects of environmental resource management are 
ethical, economical, social and technological which provide for formulation of principles in making 
decisions. To achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management, sustainability 
principles should be adopted to include social and environmental accountability, long-term planning, 
a strong and shared vision a holistic focus, broad stakeholder engagement and justice, transparency, 
trust, and flexibility, etc. A good example on resources management is Integrated Water Resources 
Management (IWRM) which is a coordinated, goal-directed process for controlling the development 
and use of river, lake, ocean, wetland, and other water assets. Operationally, IWRM approaches involve 
applying knowledge from various disciplines as well as the insights from diverse stakeholders to devise and 
implement efficient, equitable and sustainable solutions to water and development problems. Water has 
many different uses (agriculture, industry, ecosystems, people and livelihoods) and demands coordinated 
action. An IWRM approach is an open, flexible process, bringing together decision-makers and all 
stakeholders to the table to set policy and make sound, balanced decisions in response to specific water 
challenges faced.

Technically, mathematical optimisation is a powerful tool for environmental engineers to manage 
resources problems. In mathematics, an optimisation problem is a search for the best solution from 
all feasible options. An objective function (either a cost function for minimisation or a utility function 
for maximisation) is set up to be optimised. There are many optimisation methods available for 
different optimisation problems. They include linear programming, integer programming, nonlinear 
programming, evolution algorithms, etc. For complex problems, multi-objective optimisation (also 
known as multi-criteria or multi-attribute optimisation) may be used to simultaneously optimise two or 
more conflicting objectives subject to certain constraints. For multi-modal optimisation problems, there 
could be several globally good solutions (the same cost function value). Obtaining all (or at least some 
of) the multiple solutions is the goal of a multi-modal optimiser. Both multi-objective and multi-modal 
problems are difficult to solve by traditional optimisation techniques and evolutionary algorithms are 
gaining popularity in dealing with those problems. This is because evolutionary algorithms optimise a 
set of solutions simultaneously, allowing computation of an approximation of the entire Pareto front 
in a single algorithm run. Although evolutionary algorithms are computationally intensive, modern 
computers have made those computation issues less a problem.

Pollution Control
Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment with adverse changes (air 
pollution, water pollution, land pollution, etc). Pollutants can be either foreign substances or naturally 
occurring contaminants. Pollution control means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water 
or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from consumption, heating, agriculture, mining, 
manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will 
degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimisation are 
more desirable than other mitigating measures. In the field of land development, low impact development 
is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff. Pollution control activities include recycling, 
reusing, reducing, mitigating, preventing, compost, etc. Further details on pollutions are described in 
various chapters of this book.
3.3.5	
Sustainable Agriculture
Sustainable agriculture is an integrated system of plant and animal production practices that will last 
over the long term. It is based on the study of relationships between organisms and their environment 
using principles of ecology. The benefits in sustainable agriculture include meeting human food and fibre 
needs, enhancing environmental quality and the natural resource base, making the most efficient use 
of non-renewable resources and on-farm resources, integrating natural biological cycles and controls, 
sustaining the economic viability of farm operations, and enhancing the quality of life for farmers and 
society as a whole.
When farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some of nutrients from the soil. Without 
replenishment, land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced 
yields. In practice, farmers tend to over-apply synthetic fertiliser or animal manures, which can improve 
productivity but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters (eutrophication). Many farming practices 
can cause long-term damage to soil including excessive tillage (leading to erosion). Soil erosion is fast 
becoming one of the world’s greatest problems. The phenomenon is being called Peak Soil as present 
large scale factory farming techniques are jeopardising humanity’s ability to grow food in the present 
and in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of arable soil 
will become increasingly problematic. Availability of water is crucial for sustainable agriculture. In some 
areas, sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth, but many other areas require irrigation. However, 
improper irrigation without adequate drainage can lead to salinisation.

Sustainability
Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimising the use of non-renewable 
resources, such as natural gas (used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertiliser), or 
mineral ores (e.g., phosphate). For irrigation systems to be sustainable they require proper management 
(to avoid salinisation) and must not use more water from its source than is naturally replenished. Useful 
measures include:1) modern irrigation systems such as drip irrigation with high water use efficiency; 2) 
improving water conservation and storage measures; 3) drought-tolerant crop species, 4) deficit irrigation; 
and 5) managing crops to reduce water loss. To conserve soil, useful soil management techniques include 
no-till farming, Keyline design, growing wind breaks to hold the soil, incorporating organic matter back 
into fields, stopping or minimising chemical fertilisers, protecting soil from water runoff erosion. The 
conventional monoculture (one crop) farming should be replaced by polyculture (a mixture of crops) 
to reduce disease or pest problems. 
3.3.6	
Population Control
In ancient times, people considered population as a source of political, economic, and military strength. 
However, it was gradually realised that the population should be controlled. In ancient Greece, Plato 
(427-347 BCE) and Aristotle (384-322 BCE) discussed the best population size for Greek city states and 
concluded that cities should be small enough for efficient administration and direct citizen participation 
in public affairs, but at the same time needed to be large enough to defend themselves against hostile 
neighbouring city states. In the 20th century, population control proponents have drawn from the 
insights of Thomas Malthus who argued that “Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical 
ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio.” Malthus advocated for the education of the 
lower class about the use of “moral restraint,” or voluntary abstinence, which he believed would slow 
the growth rate. Paul Ehrlich, a US biologist and environmentalist, published ‘The Population Bomb’ in 
1968, advocating stringent population control policies. 
It is estimated based on the European standard of living that the Earth can only support a population 
of two billion individuals (Pimentel and colleagues, 2010). For other estimates with different living 
standards, carrying capacity of the Earth is between 4 billion and 16 billion (Wikipedia ‘Over population’). 
Depending on which estimate is used, human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred. 
Nevertheless, the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern for the environment 
to cope with. Overpopulation will increase demand for resources such as fresh water and food, consume 
natural resources faster than the rate of regeneration (such as fossil fuels), and decrease living conditions.
The methods for population control include contraception, abstinence, reducing infant mortality (so 
that parents do not increase their family size to ensure at least some survive to adulthood), abortion, 
sterilisation, education and empowerment of women. The method(s) chosen can be strongly influenced 
by the religious and cultural beliefs of community members.

Sustainable City (eco-city)
Urbanisation can be planned and the engineering community should collaborate with other professions 
to design more eco friendly urban environment, such as eco-cities. A sustainable city (or eco-city) is 
a city designed with minimum environmental impact. A sustainable city should be able to feed itself 
with the food produced on the surrounding countryside, minimise the imported food from further 
afield, power itself with renewable sources of energy, create the smallest possible ecological footprint, 
produce the lowest quantity of pollution possible, use land efficiently, compost used materials, recycle 
waste or convert waste-to-energy. In contrast to rural or suburban areas, urban systems can be more 
environmentally sustainable because people and resource are located so close to one another to save 
transportation energy and use resources more efficiently.
The approaches for sustainable cities include: urban agricultural systems by either small scale farming 
plots or larger scale agriculture (e.g. farmscrapers), renewable energy sources (wind turbines, solar panels, 
or bio-gas created from sewage), various methods to reduce the need for air conditioning (planting trees 
and lightening surface colours, natural ventilation systems, increase in water features, and green spaces), 
improved public transport and increase in pedestrianisation to make driving more difficult to reduce car 
emissions, integration of business, industrial, and residential zones to shorten travel distances (people 
to live closer to the workspace), green roofs, zero-emission transport, zero-energy building, sustainable 
drainage systems (SuDS), energy conservation systems/devices, Xeriscaping (garden and landscape 
design for water conservation).
3.3.8	
Sustainable Drainage System
Conventional drainage systems are designed to collect and convey storm water quickly which tend to 
cause downstream flooding and environmental pollution (e.g., combined sewage overflow). Sustainable 
drainage systems (SuDS) are designed to reduce the potential impact of new and existing developments 
with respect to surface water drainage discharges. They are intended to replicate natural systems with 
low environmental impact to drain away dirty and surface water run-off through collection, storage, 
and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment (e.g., water courses). 
SuDS should be easy to manage, require little or no energy input, resilient to use, environmentally and 
aesthetically attractive.
SuDS uses the following techniques: source control, permeable paving such as pervious concrete, storm 
water detention, storm water infiltration (e.g., reed beds, wetland), evapotranspiration (e.g. from a green 
roof), etc. Originally the term SUDS was used in the UK to refer to sustainable urban drainage systems. 
These developments may not necessarily be in “urban” areas, and nowadays the “urban” part of SUDS 
is usually dropped to reduce confusion. SuDS is called differently in many other countries (e.g., best 
management practice (BMP) and low-impact development in the United States, and water-sensitive 
urban design in Australia).

Remote Sensing of Environment
4	 Remote Sensing of Environment
4.1	
Introduction
Remote sensing is the acquisition of information at a distance about physical objects on the Earth in 
order to detect and classify objects by means of reflected or emitted electromagnetic energy. There are 
two types: 1) passive remote sensing and 2) active remote sensing. A passive sensor detects radiation that 
is emitted from the target object or reflected by the object from a natural radiation source (e.g., sun). 
An active device emits energy to the target object and uses a sensor to detect and measure the reflected 
or backscattered energy (e.g., radar and lidar). The time delay between emission and return can be used 
to measure the location and speed of an object.
4.2	
Electromagnetic Radiation
All objects emit and reflect electromagnetic radiations (except the idealised cases such as no emission for 
absolute zero and no reflection for black body). Remote sensing uses sensors to record electromagnetic 
radiation emitted or reflected from the target object which goes through the atmosphere. Electromagnetic 
radiation is expressed by three properties: wavelength (in length, such as mm), frequency (in hertz) and 
amplitude (spectral irradiance in watts per square meter per micrometer). The relationship between 
frequency and wavelength is expressed as

Figure 4.1 Electromagnetic Spectrum
The total radiation power is measured by radiant flux in W. The irradiance measures radiant flux per 
unit area landing on a surface (W/m2) and radiant emittance is radiant flux per unit area emitted from 
a surface (W/m2). If each frequency is considered separately, ‘spectral’ is added in front of them such 
as spectral irradiance (W/m2/nm).
The radiation from an object depends on its temperature and emissivity (written in ε ) . Emissivity 
represents the relative ability of a material surface to emit radiation related to a black body at the same 
temperature, which varies on factors such as temperature, emission angle and wavelength. A black body 
is an idealised physical body that absorbs all incident radiation with no reflection, hence its emissivity 
is 1. A perfect reflector’s emissivity (a white body) is 0. In the nature, all objects are gray bodies whose 
emissivities lie between 0 and 1.
There are three important laws in radiation: 
1.	 Kirchhoff’s law: at thermal equilibrium, the emissivity of a body (or surface) equals to its 
absorptivity. It could be described as ‘a poor reflector is a good emitter, and a good reflector 
is a poor emitter’; 
2.	 Stefan-Boltzmann law: the total emitted radiation is linked with the temperature (absolute 
temperature)

3.	 Wien’s displacement law: the wavelength at which a black body’s maximum emitted 
radiation is related to its temperature as 
2897.8 /T
λ =
. As a black body becomes hotter, 
the wavelength of its maximum emitted radiation shifts to a shorter wavelength, and vice 
versa. A black body appears black at the Earth ambient temperatures because it mainly emits 
longer wavelength infrared radiation and does not emit any detectable visible light.

Interactions with the Atmosphere and Earth Surface 
4.3.1	
With the Atmosphere
The electromagnetic radiation interacts with the atmosphere in three ways:
1.	 scattering: redirection of electromagnetic radiation by particles or large molecules in the 
atmosphere. Rayleigh scattering occurs when atmospheric particles (mainly large molecules 
of nitrogen and oxygen gases) are very small relative to the radiation wavelength and it is 
in proportion to the inverse of the fourth power of the wavelength. Blue light is scattered 
4 times as much as red light which explains the blue sky during clear day and reddish 
colour at sunset. Due to Rayleigh scattering, radiation in the blue and ultraviolet spectrum 
is significantly scattered and is usually not used in remote sensing. On the other hand, Mie 
scattering is caused by large atmospheric particles (dust, pollen, smoke, tiny water droplet) 
that are equivalent in size to the radiation wavelength. Mie scattering is also wavelength 
dependent, but the relationship is more complicated. If particles are much larger than the 
radiation wavelength (e.g., water droplets or large dust particle), non-selective scattering will 
occur which is not wavelength-dependent. All visible wavelengths are scattered equally so 
that they are observed as a whitish or greyish haze.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

2.	 absorption: gradual loss of radiation intensity through a medium (also called attenuation). 
The radiation energy is taken up by the medium and transformed to other forms such as 
heat. The Earth atmosphere is an important barrier to radiation transmission by attenuation. 
The attenuation spectrum is referred to as atmospheric window (Figure 4.2). The wavelength 
severely attenuated by the atmosphere is usually not effective for remote sensing. 
 Figure 4.2 Earth’s atmospheric window (Adopted from Wikipedia ‘Absorption’, 2012)
3.	 refraction: change of radiation direction at the contact area between two different media. 
It happens in the atmosphere as radiation passes through atmospheric layers of varied 
humidity, temperature, and density. The bending of microwave radar beam is the main 
reason for Anaprop (Anomalous propagation).
4.3.2	
With the Surface
The electromagnetic radiation interacts with the Earth surface in three ways:
1.	 reflection: the change of radiation direction at the Earth surface. It depends on surface 
irregularities (i.e., roughness) in relationship to the radiation wavelength. If a surface is 
smooth relative to wavelength, specular reflection occurs and almost all incident radiation 
is reflected in a single direction (i.e., mirror-like). Specular reflection usually occurs with 
mirror, smooth metal, calm water, etc. If a surface is rough relative to wavelength, diffuse 
reflection occurs and incident radiation is reflected in many directions (scattered). Diffuse 
reflection usually occurs with non-shiny surfaces such as ground, wall, paper, etc. An ideal 
diffuse reflector is known as a Lambertian surface which reflects incident radiation equally 
in all directions. A Lambertian surface is usually used as an approximation to the target 
object in remote sensing. However, many actual surfaces have complex reflection patterns 
influenced by surface geometry (e.g., shape, size, orientation, etc).
2.	 transmission: the passing of radiation through a material such as vegetation leaves. It varies 
greatly with wavelength (e.g., vegetation leaves are generally opaque to visible light, but 
transmit significant amounts of radiation in infrared and microwave bands). Transmission is 
opposite to absorption.
3.	 absorption: loss of radiation energy in the Earth surface which is transformed into other 
energy forms such as heat.

4.3.3	
Spectral Signature
Different objects on the Earth surface may have different emitted/reflected radiation features in a range 
of wavelengths, which are called spectral signatures (Figure 4.3 A). With cameras and other remote 
sensing instruments, it is possible to observe the brightness of an object across several spectral bands 
(Figure 4.3B). The spectral signature would help the identification of different land covers/land surfaces 
(vegetated and non-vegetated areas, diseased or stressed vegetation, certain types of plants and soil 
characteristics, urban areas, and water body). It should be noted that spectral signatures change both 
over time (e.g., different growth seasons) and space (e.g., different proportions of tree species in a forest), 
so it is important to use the normalised index in object classifications. From Figure 4.3, it is clear that 
vegetation gives very strong reflection to infrared channel over red channel. This characteristic can be 
used to identify vegetation cover over the globe based on NDVI (the Normalised Difference Vegetation 
Index). NDVI is usually calculated as follows,
near infrared - red
near infrared + red
NDVI =

The spectral information collected by remote sensing is broadly in two categories: multispectral and 
hyperspectral images (Figure 4.4). Multispectral images are captured at discrete bands with gaps between 
them. Hyperspectral images have narrow spectral bands over a continuous spectral range, which are 
memory demanding and less widely used in comparison with multispectral images.

Sensors
Remote sensing takes three forms: 1) reflection of solar radiation from the Earth. The spectrum mainly 
includes the visible light and near infrared; 2) radiation emitted from the Earth. Since the Earth has 
a much lower temperature than the Sun, the radiation from the Earth is mainly at longer wavelength; 
3) reflection of the emitted radiation from the sensor (the sensor illuminates the object with its own 
radiation instead of the Sun). Various sensors are available to capture the information of those forms.

Aerial Camera
Aerial photography is a basic form of capturing remote sensed images using an aerial camera in visible 
light and near infrared spectrum. Aerial cameras have the following components: 1) a lens to focus light 
on the film; 2) a film to record images and 3) a shutter to control exposure. There are three types of 
cameras used in aerial photography: 1) metric cameras (i.e., cartographic cameras) are used to capture 
high quality images with a minimum optical and geometric error; 2) strip cameras capture images by 
moving film past a fixed slit. The speed of film movement is synchronised with the speed and altitude 
of the aircraft to provide suitable exposure; 3) panoramic cameras use a lens with a narrow field of view 
to scan across a wide strip of land. Panoramic photographs have serious geometric distortions because 
of the forward motion of the aircraft during the side-to-side scan of the lens. 
4.4.2	
Radiometer
It is used to collect reflected or emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common 
are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave. Examples include the Moderate-resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 
and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Radiometers may collect images in panchromatic, 
multispectral, hyperspectral and full spectral modes. Panchromatic images record the total radiation 
across a wide range of spectrum (e.g., visible light). Multispectral images are captured at several specific 
wavelengths (i.e., bands). Hyperspectral deals with imaging narrow spectral bands over a continuous 
spectral range so that an entire spectrum is acquired. Full Spectral Imaging (FSI) acquires data as 
spectral curves (not at different wave bands). FSI information is contained in the shape of the spectral 
curves. As a result, a significant reduction in data rate and volume could be achieved in comparison 
with hyperspectral images.
4.4.3	
Microwave Radiometer
A microwave radiometer measures energy emitted at sub-millimetre-to-centimetre wavelengths (at 
frequencies of 1-1000 GHz). Examples of microwave radiometers include the Special Sensor Microwave/
Imager (SSM/I), Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Advanced Microwave 
Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) and the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis 
(MIRAS).
4.4.4	
Radar Altimeter
A radar altimeter measures the altitude using the time for a microwave pulse to reflect from the Earth 
surface to the instrument. Coupled with GPS, a radar altimeter can be used to determine the terrain.

Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR)
A SAR uses a single physical antenna gathering signals at different positions at different times. The phase 
shifts from those signals enables the radar to achieve finer spatial resolutions than the conventional 
beam scanning radars. For the Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR or IfSAR), two or more 
SAR images taken at different times can be used to generate maps of surface deformation based on the 
differences in the phase between them. It can potentially measure centimetre-scale changes in deformation 
over time spans of days to years.
4.4.6 	
LIDAR
LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is an instrument for measuring the distance to or other properties 
of a target. A pulsed laser beam in ultraviolet, visible or near infrared bands is used to illuminate the 
target. The LADAR components include laser, scanner, photodetector and position systems.
4.5	
Remote Sensing Platforms
There are various platforms to mount remote sensors, such as balloons, kites, rockets, helicopters, aircrafts, 
satellites, etc. Only satellites are covered here since they are the most commonly used means for data 
acquisition. A satellite moves along its orbit around the Earth. A normal orbit forms an ellipse with one 
focus at the Earth centre with key parameters: apogee A (the point farthest from the Earth), perigee P 
(the point closest to the Earth), ascending node AN (the point where the satellite crosses the equator 
from south to north), descending node DN (as AN except the opposite direction), inclination i (the angle 
between satellite moving direction at DN with respect to the equator). An inclination of zero degrees 
means the satellite orbits the Earth in its equatorial plane, in the same direction as the Earth rotates. 
The orbit altitude controls the time required for a satellite to circle the Earth (it increases with altitude). 
There are three main orbit options based on inclination: geostationary, polar and inclined. With an 
inclination of zero degrees and altitude of 35,790 km, a satellite has the same rotational period (i.e., 23 
hrs 56 mins, 4.09 secs) as the Earth and remains stationary above the Earth surface (i.e., geostationary). 
Geostationary satellites are suitable for communications and weather monitoring due to its continuous 
availability in time, but it has a poor spatial resolution in the polar regions. The polar orbit has an 
inclination of 90 degrees, which means the satellite passes the poles on each orbital revolution and covers 
the whole globe. An inclined orbit falls between/beyond 0 degrees (geostationary orbit) and 90 degrees 
(polar orbit). Such an orbit may be more suitable for a specific region. A special case of the inclined orbit 
is sun-synchronous which is useful in reducing variation in illuminations caused by differences in time 
of day so that a satellite passes over the same Earth point at the same solar time at altitudes of 600 to 
800 km (with a period around 100 minutes). It has an inclination of 98 degrees (close to a polar orbit).

Data Processing
Remote sensing usually measures the interested features of the target object indirectly (e.g., precipitation). 
A data based mathematical model (e.g., regression model, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector 
Machines) is needed to derive the features to be measured (an inverse problem).
Some key properties of the remote sensing data include: 1) spatial resolution: the size of a pixel (e.g., 
Landsat 7’s spatial resolution ranges from 15 to 60m); 2) temporal resolution: the repeated coverage of 
the scanned images (e.g., Landsat 7 has a temporal resolution of 16 days). This is useful for detecting 
temporal changes of the scanned object; 3) spectral resolution: the wavelength width of the different 
frequency bands (e.g., Landsat 7’s spectral resolutions are from 0.07 to 2.1 mm to cover seven bands 
including visible and infra-red spectrums); 4) radiometric resolution: the number of distinguishable 
different radiation intensities (e.g., 8 bits are equal to 256 levels). Normally, the instrument noise would 
limit the achievable resolution.
The data processing includes the follow actions:
1.	 Georeference: to correct the distorted images by matching with the known points on the 
ground (typically 30 or more points per image aided by computer software) to warp the 
image so that the distortion is minimised. In recent years (since 1990s), most satellite images 
are fully georeferenced by data providers;

2.	 Radiometric conversion: to convert the digitised pixel values (e.g., raw digital number in 8 
bits) to actual analogue values (e.g., radiance);
3.	 Atmospheric correction: to correct the effect of the atmosphere based on the wavelength, 
sensor height and the purpose (NCAVEO, 2011). Although the uncorrected raw digital 
number is acceptable for a one-off image classification, it is more useful to convert the 
raw digital number to ‘at sensor’ radiance and derive ground leaving radiance from the 
‘at sensor’ (or ‘top-of-atmosphere’) radiance so that the results may be more reliable and 
compared with different sensors. The atmospheric conditions can be based on the generic 
prevailing weather conditions coincided with the scanned image or from the downscaled 
reanalysis weather data using WRF or MM5.
Data processing levels include (based on NASA and WMO):
Level 0: raw instrument data (usually not available to users);
Level 1: time referenced Level 0 data with the Earth-location and instrument calibration information;
Level 2: derived geophysical values (e.g., temperature, soil moisture) at instrumental pixel resolution;
Level 3: geophysical values on uniform space-time grids (interpolated from Level 2), which are easy to 
handle by GIS software;
Level 4: output from the analysis models.
Some commonly used image processing systems include
ENVI (ITT Corporation, http://www.ittvis.com/language/en-US/ProductsServices/ENVI.aspx)
GRASS GIS (GRASS Development Team, a free software system, http://grass.osgeo.org/)
IDRISI (Clark Labs at Clark University, http://www.clarklabs.org/)
4.7	
Field Observation
Field observations are carried out at or near ground level acting as ‘ground truth’ in support of remote 
sensing analysis. They are used for 1) to verify the remote sensing results; 2) to provide training data for 
image classification; and 3) to provide the spectral properties of the object (e.g., different plants, soils, 
water bodies). The field observation should contain three key elements: attribute (vegetation type, soil 
moisture, etc.), location and time. 
Nominal data are qualitative designations of delineated regions, such as forest, water, grassland, etc. In 
the field, nominal data can be collected at points or for small areas. To cover a large area, it is convenient 
to bring maps or aerial photographs to annotate the nominal labels. Documentations usually include 
notes, sketches, ground/sky photographs, videos, etc.

Remote Sensing of Environment
Biophysical data represent physical features of vegetation cover (e.g., type, size, form, spacing, leaf area 
index- LAI) and soil (e.g., texture, mineralogy, soil moisture). They tend to vary with time so it is important 
that their measurements should be linked with remote sensing images. Their record should also include 
time, location and weather. Biophysical data are collected at point and should be extrapolated to large 
areas by a suitable algorithm (e.g., simple average, Kriging). They complement nominal data with more 
precise meaning of the individual nominal labels. 
Radiometric data are collected by field spectroradiometers to measure brightness near the ground surface 
which can be used to analyse the corresponding brightness recorded by the remote sensing device. A 
spectroradiometer is designed to measure the spectral power distribution of illuminants and equipped 
with a handhold probe connected to the measuring unit by a fibre optic cable. The device is able to 
separate radiation into different spectral regions by filters or diffraction gratings. A hand-held 2or 3 band 
spectroradiometer has a typical spectral bandwidth of 300nm to 1000nm (cover the channels of green, 
red, and near-IR). Brightness can be presented as radiance (absolute brightness to represent the radiation 
seen from the target) or reflectance (relative brightness as a ratio of the radiation from the target and the 
radiation to the target, e.g., albedo). Reflectances are convenient in comparing with other data because 
they are less influenced by the variations in illumination and field practice. A reference panel is needed 
to provide a uniform reflective brightness as a reference target. It is made from a pure white surface with 
well known reflectance properties (such as barium sulphate and Spectralon). Some instruments have 
the ability to match the spectral ranges and resolutions to specific satellite sensors such as SPOT TM.
The field of view to the features to be observed has an important influence on data quality. A foreoptic 
(a removable attachment) should be fitted to the probe to restrict its view from 1 to 10 degrees. The 
indirect radiation from the operator’s clothing and irrelevant objects should be avoided. The probe may 
be immersed in liquids (e.g., to measure radiation from water bodies), around the ground surface by 
hand-holding or situated on truck-mounted booms with overhead views to better represent the viewing 
perspective of remote sensing devices in the sky.

Applications
Remote sensing has a wide range of applications such as vegetation cover, erosion, pollution, forestry, 
weather, and land use which can be imaged, mapped and tracked. 
4.8.1	
Vegetation
Vegetation plays an important role in the environment. There are several types of vegetation classifications 
such as floristic (botanical), physiognomy and structure (life form), ecological (function in ecosystems), 
etc. For environmental applications, ecological, physiognomy and structure classifications are more 
relevant. Timing of vegetation remote sensing may be very important. In a forested area, mapping of 
the understory should be carried out in early spring when the forest canopy is not fully developed to 
cover the small plants underneath.

Chlorophyll in plants absorbs sunlight in photosynthesis with preference in blue and red spectrums as 
shown in Figure 4.5 (as much as 70-90%). As a result, green and near-infrared (NIR) lights are reflected 
(especially NIR) and vegetations appear as green to human eyes (as shown in Figure 4.3). Different 
vegetations are more apparent in NIR than in visible light spectrum (e.g., with increasing NIR reflectances 
in coniferous forest, broadleaf and grass), so NIR could be used to distinguish vegetation types. For the 
same vegetation, NIR reflects its vegetative vigour (i.e., stronger vegetation with more reflective NIR). 
At mid infrared spectrum, vegetation water content plays an important role and could be used to check 
the water content in vegetation (e.g., drought condition, maturity of plant) as shown in Figure 4.6.

Vegetation index can be derived based on the vegetation reflectance (e.g., NDVI). The green spectrum 
may be used instead of NIR albeit it is less effective. It should be noted that vegetation index is influenced 
by viewing angle, leaf orientation, soil background, atmosphere (some bands are affected more than 
others), etc., which may cause difficulties in analysing vegetation changes with time. It may help to convert 
sensor digital values to radiance before vegetation index is calculated. Vegetation index may be used 
to monitor leaf area index, to map vegetated areas from non-vegetated areas, to distinguish vegetation 
types and densities and to check vegetation change with time.

It is possible to investigate foliar chemistry using hyperspectral images such as foliar nitrogen content 
(e.g., in bands 1265-1555 nm). Lidar data are able to provide information on vegetation height, a useful 
feature for forest management.
4.8.2	
Landform
Land form remote sensing covers geology, topography, etc. Aerial photos are useful in identifying 
geological structure and terrain. Various drainage patterns can be derived from remote sensed images. 
It is possible to spot linear features such as fault lines (Figure 4.7).

In the area with vegetation coverage, geobotany may be used to derive the underneath geochemical 
information. Geological materials influence the supply of nutrients (e.g., micronutrients such as barium, 
magnesium and calcium) or toxic elements (e.g., heavy metals), which may be reflected in vegetation 
growth. Spectral emittance and reflectance of rocks and minerals are closely related to their physical 
and chemical properties.

Water 
The deep pure water appears blue to blue-green. The sediment concentration influences the spectral

its peak reflectance from blue to green with a broader shape (Figure 4.8).

The roughness of water surface is linked with the reflectance. Wave-roughed surfaces are brighter than 
smoother ones (similar to reflectors in bicycles). With an active radar system on a satellite, the sea wave 
height and velocity can be derived from the received signal based on the radar wavelength and bean 
geometry.
If water is clear and the water body bed reflectance is uniform, it is possible to derive the depth of water 
using multispectral images. This is because different bands of visible lights have different reflectance from 
various depths of water (up to 20m). 
Evapotranspiration over land may be estimated from satellite sensed vegetation, land temperature and 
total radiation (e.g., using the Penman Monteith formula). Passive and active microwave sensors are able 
to provide soil moisture information.
Sea surface temperature (SST) represents the average temperature of the ocean surface within the upper 
meter. Remote sensing is only able to detect the surface temperature within the upper 1mm, which is still 
useful since there is a good correlation between STT and remote sensed temperature. The wavelength 
used is around the peak of the blackbody radiation from the Earth (10 
m
m
).
Since phytoplankton (microscopic plants in water) contains chlorophyll (as land vegetation), multispectral 
remote sensors are able to detect its concentration in water. Other materials such as bacteria, fungi, algae, 
silts and clays may also be detected.

Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)
Land use refers to use of the land surface by humans in an economic sense (agricultural, industrial, 
commercial, residential) and land cover shows the physical Earth surface features (lake, forest, urban). 
In practice, land use and land cover are considered together. In 1970s, USGS specified Level I (urban, 
agricultural, rangeland, forest, water, wetland, barren, tundra, perennial snow or ice) and Level II 
categories (with more details). Data analysts may add further detailed Level III (or more) for particular 
applications.
LULC identification is based on image interpretation. Crop land usually has regular shapes. Forests may 
have rough textures and medium dark tones with irregular edges. Transportation is featured with linear 
patterns. Usually predominant category is used to identify each LULC parcel.
To map the changes of LULC, maps taken at two different dates should have the same classification 
system, scale, geometry and details.

Rainfall
Rainfall may be estimated by visible, infrared or microwave bands. Infrared and visible light instruments 
are capable of studying the cloud upper layer only and thus they can provide indirect information of 
rain. In contrast, passive microwave sensor can observe rain drop distributions above the Earth surface. 
Satellite rainfall is valuable in ungauged catchments. In Infrared and visible bands, GOES (USA), 
METEOSAT (Europe, Africa, and western Asia) and MTSAT (eastern Asia) have been used to provide 
rainfall data at continental scales. In passive microwave, the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) 
mission (scheduled to fly in the year of 2013) and its predecessor Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 
(TRMM) are able to measure the Earth’s precipitation structure.

Environmental Risk
5	 Environmental Risk
Environmental risk due to various environmental hazards is an important topic for environmental 
engineers to recognise and understand in order to protect human society and ecosystems from harms 
or damages at local, regional or global scales. For example, to deal with contaminated soil and ground 
water at a brown field, risk and exposure assessment help engineers choose an optimal solution to either 
treat the hazard (e.g., to remove the contaminants from the soil and water) or reduce the exposure (e.g., 
to cover up the land with a barrier). 
5.1	
Hazards
A hazard is a threat to life, health, property, or ecosystems, i.e., it involves something that could 
potentially be harmful. Therefore, when a dormant hazard comes to fruition, it will cause physical damage 
or destruction, loss of life, or drastic change to the environment, and result in an incident, accident, 
emergency event, or disaster. Hazards may be broadly classified into two groups:
Man-made hazards (also called anthropogenic hazards): created by humans due to human intent, 
negligence, or error, such as crime, terrorism, war (sociological hazards), industrial hazards, power 
outage, hazardous materials (technological hazards), etc.
Natural hazards: caused by a natural process with a negative effect on people or the environment, 
such as volcanoes, floods, earthquakes, etc. Many natural and man-made hazards are interrelated (e.g. 
earthquakes may cause tsunamis which in turn damage nuclear power plants to release radioactive waste).
5.2	
Environmental Hazards
Environmental hazards include hazardous material pollution and natural hazards. 
5.2.1	
Hazardous Wastes
Hazardous wastes are classified into several categories such as explosive, flammable, irritant, carcinogenic, 
corrosive, etc. Nowadays, landfill of hazardous wastes is banned in the EU and incineration should be 
used to dispose them. Assessment of waste sources is quite a difficult task as waste producers do not 
always retain inventories of their waste streams because hazardous waste is a liability and a cost burden. 
Therefore, waste assessment is a highly expensive exercise requiring time, patient, training and money. 
Among various effects of hazardous wastes, toxicity is of direct concern by the public. Environmental 
toxicology is an interdisciplinary science field dealing with the effects of chemicals on living organisms.

Environmental Risk
Toxic effects are divided into two types: carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic. A carcinogen promotes or 
induces tumours with uncontrolled abnormal growth and division of cells. Noncarcinogenic matters 
cause toxicological responses without carcinogenic effects, such as organ damage, neurological damage, 
learning difficulties, etc. A common method of expressing toxicity is the median lethal dose (LD50), 
which is the dose causing the death of 50 percent of a test organism population. The median lethal dose 
is represented as the mass of chemical dose per body mass of the test organism using the unit of mg/
kg. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared and normalised 
for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with 
body mass). It should be noted that LD50 measures acute toxicity only (as opposed to chronic toxicity 
at lower doses). The species-specific nature of toxicity presents a shortcoming in extrapolating animal 
test results to humans. When animal studies are used to determine standards for human exposure, a 
philosophy of ‘safe than sorry’ is adopted to apply a significant safety factor to set a conservative level 
by several orders of magnitude (the safety factor is usually between 10 to 1000). 
5.2.2	
Natural Hazards 
Natural hazards can be further divided into geological hazards and hydrometeorological hazards.
Geological hazard examples include 
1.	 earthquake: a result of sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust that creates seismic 
waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by ruptures of geological faults, but also by other 
events such as volcanic activities, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. At the Earth’s 
surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacement of the 
ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be 
displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Major earthquakes can cause losses of human lives 
and huge damages to buildings as illustrated by Figure 5.1;

2.	 landslide: an event when the stability of a slope changes from a stable condition to an 
unstable condition due to natural causes (groundwater, erosion, earthquake, volcanic 
eruptions) or human activities (deforestation, blasting, earthwork). Landslides include debris 
flows (Figure 5.2), earth flow, shallow landslide, deep-seated landslide, etc.

3.	 avalanche: a sudden, drastic flow of snow down a slope, occurring when either natural 
triggers (such as loading from new snow or rain) or artificial triggers (such as snowmobilers, 
explosives or backcountry skiers) overload the snowpack. Avalanches are most common 
during winter or spring, which can cause loss of life and destroy settlements, roads, railways 
and forests. The size of an avalanche, its mass and its destructive potential are rated on a 
logarithmic scale, typically of 5 categories;
4.	 volcanic eruption: the release of power from a volcano. The eruptions come in many forms 
ranging from daily small eruptions, to megacolossal eruptions, or supervolcanoes. Volcanic 
eruptions arise through three main mechanisms: a) gas release under decompression causing 
magmatic eruptions, b) thermal contraction from chilling on contact with water causing 
phreatomagmatic eruptions, and c) ejection of entrained particles during steam eruptions 
causing phreatic eruptions.
Hydrometeorological hazards examples include
1.	 flood: an overflow of water that submerges the land that is normally dry. There are various 
types of floods such as urban flood, fluvial flood, pluvial floods, flash floods, coastal flood 
and groundwater flood, etc. Floods tend to cause damages to buildings and threaten human 
lives;
2.	 drought: an extended period of months or years with consistently below average 
precipitation resulting in a deficiency in a region’s water supply. A severe drought can have 
significant environmental, agricultural, health, economic and social consequences;

3.	 hurricane: it is also called cyclonic storm, tropical cyclone, and typhoon. Hurricanes forms 
over the oceans caused by evaporated water from the ocean and becomes a storm. The 
Coriolis Effect causes the storms to spin, and a hurricane is declared when this spinning 
mass of storms attains a wind speed greater than 74 mph (119 km/h). While tropical 
cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain, they are also able to 
produce high waves and damaging storm surge as well as spawning tornadoes;
4.	 heat wave: a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by 
high humidity. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths 
from hyperthermia, and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning.
5.3	
Environmental Risks
‘Hazard’ and ‘Risk’ are different terms. In environmental engineering, risk is defined as the expected 
outcome of an environmental hazard (human injury, disease, death, economic losses or ecosystem 
damages). Generally, the risk is a function of hazard and its exposure
Risk= (Hazard, Exposure)
f

(5.1)
The meaning and unit of the formula vary depending on the specific hazards. Risk can be reduced by 
lowering either hazard or exposure, or both.
The risk to the health of human due to harmful carcinogenic chemicals is expressed as.
Risk=Risk per unit dose 
Exposed dose 
×

(5.2)
where risk is the probability of a person suffers from the adverse effect of the hazards (e.g., to develop 
cancer due to exposure to carcinogens), risk per unit dose is the harm caused by a unit exposure of a 
hazardous material (i.e., how strong the chemical is harmful), exposed dose is the contact of a human and 
the chemical (expressed as dosage and duration). In humans, there are three major exposure pathways: 
ingestion (eating/drinking), inhalation (breathing) and dermal (skin) contact. The default exposure 
duration is 70 years and if a person’s exposure is shorter than 70 year, the risk calculated should be scaled 
by the ratio of the actual duration to 70 year. For carcinogens, there is no threshold for chemicals to 
take effects (i.e., linear dose-response relationship). If the risk is higher than the specified probability, it 
is considered not acceptable (e.g., greater than 10-6).
For noncarcinogens, a threshold is needed for them to have effects and a dose below the limit is assumed 
safe. This threshold is called reference dose. The risk is expressed as a ratio between the exposed dose 
to reference dose.
Exposed dose
Risk (called Hazard quotient)= Reference dose 

The risk is considered as safe if it is equal or less than 1.
For the risk linked with natural hazards (e.g., floods), it is defined as
Risk=Probability
Expected adverse consequences
×

(5.4)
where risk is the expected losses from the hazard event (note, it is not a probability anymore), probability 
is the likelihood of the hazard event, expected adverse consequences are the result of the event (in 
economic loss or deaths). For example, a 50% chance of flood causing £1000 worth of damage has the 
same risk as a 0.1% chance of flood causing losses of £0.5M (both have the expected risk values of £500). 
In reality, natural hazards tend to occur with a range of magnitudes at varied probabilities (e.g., a larger 
flood occurs less frequently than a smaller flood). The total risk for a hazard should be the sum (or the 
definite integral for continuous variables) of the risks from different magnitudes with their corresponding 
probabilities.

Environmental Risk
This formula can also be used to integrate risks from different independent hazards. For dependent 
hazards, more detailed probability on joint and union occurrences should be considered.
5.4	
Risk Perception
Risk perception is a subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk. 
It has been found that people use a number of heuristics to evaluate information which usually leads 
to inaccurate judgments in some situations (cognitive biases). There are several factors that influence 
human’s risk perception. One important factor is the familiarity to a hazard (if people are often exposed 
to a hazard and know a lot more on it, there is a tendency to underestimate the risk). A second factor 
is whether or not the risk is voluntary. When a person voluntarily takes on a risk, he or she also usually 
underestimates the risk (e.g., smoking, driving a fast car). People tend to feel it is more acceptable to 
choose a risk than to be put at risk by other people (e.g., contamination from factories). A third factor 
is people are more concerned with current risks (with immediate effect on everyday life) than long term 
risks (e.g., climate change, population growth). Another factor is that risk events interact with individual 
psychological, social and other cultural factors in ways that either increase or decrease public perceptions 
of risk. These ripple effects caused by the amplification of risk include enduring mental perceptions, 
impacts on business sales, and change in residential property values, changes in training and education, 
or social disorder.
5.5	
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is an important component in risk management. Risk assessment is the determination 
of risk related to a hazard. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between sectors and whether it 
pertains to environmental or public health risk assessment.
In the context of public health, risk assessment is the process of quantifying the probability of a harmful 
effect to individuals or populations from hazard or exposed dosage above a specific threshold. It involves 
1) hazard identification: to determine the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences of the 
contaminant and the strength of the evidence it can have that effect. This is done by drawing from the 
results of the sciences of toxicology and epidemiology; 2) Dose-Response Analysis: to determine the 
relationship between dose and the probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). This is 
based on extrapolating results from experimental animals to humans. In addition, the differences between 
individuals due to genetics or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, 
called susceptible populations; 3) exposure quantification: to determine the amount of a contaminant 
(dose) that individuals and populations will receive. This is done by examining the exposure. As different 
locations, lifestyles and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant received, particular 
care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s). Finally, the results of the three 
steps above are then combined to produce an estimate of risk.

Environmental Risk
For natural hazards, risk assessment involves 1) hazard identification: to identify the potential hazards in 
the investigation site. Some hazards are conjoint or causal (e.g., an earthquake may trigger landslides); 2) 
hazard probability: to derive the probabilities of the hazard magnitudes based on instrumental records, 
historical records or palaeo records. If insufficient information is available on site, regionalisation 
techniques could be used to extrapolate information from other sites; 3) consequence analysis: to work 
out expected losses from the realisation of the hazards. There are significant uncertainties with both the 
probabilities and potential losses. The chance of error in measuring these two variables is large. Risk 
with a large potential loss and a low probability of occurring is often treated differently from one with 
a low potential loss and a high likelihood of occurring. In theory, both are of nearly equal priority, but 
in practice it can be very difficult to manage.
5.6	
Risk Management
Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritisation of risks followed by coordinated 
and economical application of resources to minimise, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact 
of unfortunate events or to maximise the realisation of opportunities (defined in ISO 31000 as the effect 
of uncertainty on objectives, whether positive or negative). Once risks have been identified and assessed, 
all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:
Avoidance: this includes not performing an activity that could carry risk (e.g., to avoid development in 
hazard prone areas such as flood plains or contaminated land). Avoidance may seem the answer to all 
risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk 
may have allowed (e.g., to build more homes).
Reduction: this involves reducing (or eliminating) the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss 
from occurring. There are two main measures on risk reduction: soft engineering measures (forecasting, 
land planning, policies) and hard engineering measures (e.g., structures). In engineering, the concept of 
return period is usually used to represent hazard probability. Return period is the average time interval 
between occurrences of a hazardous event of a given or greater magnitude, usually expressed in years. 
The optimum design return period for risk reduction can be determined by economic analysis if the 
probabilistic nature of a loading event (e.g., flood level) and the damage that will result if it occurs are 
both known over the feasible range of the loading event. As the design return period increases, the cost 
of the event mitigation measure increases, but the expected damage decreases because of the better 
protection provided. By summing up the project cost and the expected damage cost on an annual basis, 
a design return period having a minimum total cost can be found (Figure 5.3). A check dam is shown 
in Figure 5.4 to illustrate hard engineering measures for risk reduction.

Environmental Risk
 Figure 5.4 Check dam for debris flows 
Sharing: the burden of loss from a risk can be shared with another party, such as insurance firms.
Retention: the risk loss is accepted. This may be acceptable if the chance of a significant loss is rare and 
the cost to mitigate for the hazard is great (e.g., the hazard of collision of the Earth with a large asteroid).

Risk Communication
Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field. Problems for risk communicators 
involve how to reach the intended audience, to make the risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, 
how to pay appropriate respect to the audience’s values related to the risk, how to predict the audience’s 
response to the communication, etc. A main goal of risk communication is to improve collective and 
individual decision making. A flood warning system used in the UK is used here to illustrate flooding 
risk communication to the public. The type of flood warning service available varies greatly from country 
to country, and a location may receive warnings from more than one service. In the UK, the Met Office 
issues warnings of flooding likely to occur if their meteorological forecasts of rainfall indicate that heavy 
rainfall will occur - such forecasts might be available 6 to 24 hours or more before the predicted rainfall, 
but are not fully reliable as to whether or precisely where such rainfall will occur. In conjunction with this 
service, more location-specific flood warnings are the role of the Environment Agency (covering England 
and Wales) who undertake flood forecasting tasks over shorter lead-times. In the UK, the dissemination 
of flood warnings is moving or has moved towards a service whereby those potentially at risk of river 
flooding can pre-register to receive warnings by phone from an automatic system. Both warnings and 
updates about current conditions are also carried by local radio stations. In addition, internet sites have 
pages showing what locations have flood warnings in place and the severity of these warnings (Figure 5.5) 
(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/flood/floodwarning/). A telephone is also available for 
the general public to call.

Environmental Impact Assessment
Rachel Carson’s book ‘Silent Spring’ (1962) awakened the world by showing the agricultural pesticides 
found in environments outside their target areas and the dire ecological consequences of introducing 
toxic chemicals into the natural food chains. As a result, government authorities were obliged to exert 
some control over the release of toxic chemicals into the environment and environmental assessment was 
accepted in principle at the United Nations Conference on the human environment in 1972. Nowadays, 
environmental impact assessment is widely practiced around the world to ensure that decision makers 
consider the ensuing environmental impacts when deciding whether to proceed with a project.
An environmental impact assessment is an assessment of the possible positive or negative impact that 
a proposed project (e.g., reservoir, wastewater treatment plant, highway) may have on the environment 
considering the environmental, social and economic aspects. The International Association for Impact 
Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as “the process of identifying, predicting, 
evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals 
prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made.”
Environmental impact assessment is divided into four steps: acquisition of information, analysis 
of information, communication of conclusions and selection of appropriate actions. The report of 
environmental impact assessment should have a logical structure and avoid repetition. The content 
should include the following information:
Project description: overview of the project, land use, emissions, etc.
Identification of stakeholder: to identify who are likely interested in or affected by the project.
Environment: to identify what components of the environment will be affected (human beings, flora, 
fauna, soil, surface water, groundwater, air, climate, noise, vibration, landscape, cultural heritage). The 
information from similar projects in the past should be consulted.
Impact prediction: prediction of impacts should be based on the collected data. Where possible, the 
prediction should be quantitative, albeit in many cases only qualitative predictions are possible.

Environmental Risk
Impact assessment: the significance of various impacts should be assessed. Relevant environmental 
standards may be used to judge the impact significance (e.g., noise standard, air quality standard).
Mitigation: approaches should be identified to minimise or avoid adverse environmental impacts as 
a result of the proposed project (e.g., monitoring, landscaping, site management, alternative hours of 
operation). The remaining or residual impacts should be assessed and dealt with if possible.
Public participation plays an important role in environmental impact assessment, which has several 
benefits: 1) it provides a chance to collect questions and concerns from the local people or organisations; 
2) it allows the project team to explain the project details to the people concerned; and 3) it allows 
contentious issues to be discussed in an open forum.

Water Supply
6	 Water Supply
Water supply is the provision of water for customers (e.g., domestic, trade, public, etc.) via a system of 
facilities (wells, pumps, aqueducts, reservoirs and water treatment plants, etc.). A water supply system 
involves water demand, water sources, water treatment and water distribution.
6.1	
Water Demand
Human body is mainly made of water and will suffer from dehydration with inadequate water intake. The 
minimum water requirements for human water demand (to prevent dehydration) is defined by WHO 
(the World Health Organisation) as 3.7 litres/day for adult men and 2.7 litres/day for adult women (less 
needed for children). However, humans also need water for teeth brushing, toilet flushing and bathing, 
so normally a minimum 20 litres/day is needed for an adult person. For developed countries, the water 
demand is usually much higher than the minimum figure (e.g., car washing, garden irrigation). Some 
examples of total consumption figures (litres per person per day) are listed below
1. Highly industrialised cities (San Francisco, Philadelphia, ..)
600 - 700
2. Major cities (Glasgow, London,..)
400 - 500
3. Mixed cities with moderate industries (Liverpool, Plymouth, ..)
200-350
4. Mixed urban and rural areas with low proportion of industry ( Brussels, ..)
150- 200
5. Small towns with little industrial demand
90-150
The water usage in Europe is generally less than North America. In the UK, the average daily household 
water consumption is 150 litres/person. Globally, 3800 km3 of water are withdrawn per year with 
2100km3 consumed (evaporated or incorporated in products) and 1700km3 return to local water bodies 
(as wastewater). 
Estimation of water demand is needed for a new supply system or an upgrade to an existing system. 
A model is usually used to simulate the real system, which is either a macroscale model or microscale 
model. The macroscale model is used to estimate overall water demand and microscale model is used 
to plan the detailed pipe network system with pipe diameters and pumping system. Some factors on 
considering water demand are
Domestic (In-house use, out-of-house use)
Trade (Industrial, commercial, institutional, ...)
Agricultural 
Public (public park, fire fighting, ...)
ecosystems
Losses(leakage)

Water Supply
The data to be collected include: climate data (rainfall and temperature which could influence water 
usage), historical water use (with different customer types), daily and seasonal water use patterns, 
predicted changes (land use, climate, demography), other factors (water price, water saving measures). 
For residential areas, population is the most important factor in water demand estimation. To calculate 
the water demand in such areas (if the water source is from a water supply reservoir by damming a river),
Water demand = Safety factor × (Abstraction rate + Compensation flow)
(6.1)
where
Abstraction rate (water abstracted from the river) = population´ water consumption
Population = the design population of the city to be supplied with water 
Water consumption = water usage litres per capita per day 
Compensation flow = the minimum flow to be released from the reservoir. Compensation water is the 
flow that must be discharged below a direct supply reservoir to compensate for the downstream water 
demand (people and ecosystems).
In addition to the average water demand estimation, daily and seasonal variations should also be 
considered so that the system is able to cope with a range of expected flows (from the minimum flow to 
the maximum flow). Daily variations are much easier to handle than seasonal variations.

Water Supply

Water Availability
The combination of water demand and water availability influences water supply. Water scarcity occurs 
where there is insufficient water to satisfy normal human requirements. The availability of water depends 
on the sources of water. The four commonly considered water sources are 
Surface water: from streams, rivers, lakes, canals, reservoirs. Surface water is easy to abstract, but easy 
to contaminate, high in suspended solid (TSS) and pathogens.
Groundwater: from aquifers accessible by wells. Groundwater is low in suspended solid (TSS) due to 
soil filtering, high in dissolved solid (TDS), not easy to recharge, and difficult to clean up if polluted. 
Seawater: obtained through desalination. There are many ways in desalinating seawater and the four 
popular ones are: distillation, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis and ion exchange. The most widely adopted 
systems are distillation and reverse osmosis using membrane (more energy efficient than distillation and 
becoming more popular). Desalinating seawater is high in cost, energy demanding and problematic in 
disposing brine wastewater. It may be suitable for areas near the coast.
Reclaimed and reused water: from former wastewater treated to remove solids and certain impurities. 
Instead of being discharged into surface water bodies such as rivers and oceans, it is used in irrigation, 
landscaping, groundwater recharge, indirect portable water, etc. 
Hydrology is the study of water movement and distribution. Assessment of water resources at a region is 
based on hydrological analysis of various components of the hydrological cycle, which is a huge subject 
in itself. Due to the space limit in this book, a case on water availability for water supply reservoir design 
is briefly introduced here. 
To evaluate the hydrological feasibility of a potential dam site for a water supply reservoir, a comparison 
between the water demand and catchment yield is necessary to check if sufficient water is available at 
the chosen site. A yield is the portion of the precipitation on a catchment that can be collected for use.

Water Supply
Safe yield is the minimum yield recorded for a given past period. Abstraction is the intended or actual 
quantity of water withdrawn for use. Unless the minimum flow of a stream is well above the minimum 
abstraction which must be satisfied in a water supply project, the minimum flow must be supplemented 
by water impounded in a reservoir. The firm yield is the mean annual rate of release of water through 
the reservoir that can be guaranteed. Naturally, the larger the reservoir storage, the greater is the firm 
yield, with the limit that the firm yield can never be greater than the mean inflow to the reservoir (Figure 
6.1). Since the firm yield can never be determined with certainty, it is better to treat yield in probabilistic 
terms. If the flow were absolutely constant, no reservoir would be required; but, as variability of the flow 
increases, the required reservoir capacity increases. This is another way of saying that a reservoir does 
not make water but merely permits its redistribution with respect to time.
A reservoir is used to retain excess water from periods of high flow for use during periods of low flow 
(Figure 6.2). The impounding reservoirs have two functions: a) to impound water for beneficial use and 
b) to attenuate flood flows. An impounding reservoir presents a water surface for evaporation, and this 
loss should be considered for yield estimation. In addition, the possibility of large seepage losses should 
also be considered. People and ecosystem downstream should be entitled to have a certain amount of 
water that they may make their accustomed use of (as compensation flow). Therefore, the compensation 
flow must be added to the abstraction or subtracted from the stream flow in calculating reservoir storage 
capacities.

 Figure 6.2 Reservoir storage required
There are three approaches that could be used to estimate the required reservoir storage.
a) Mass curve method (Rippl Diagram)
This method was developed by an Australian engineer in the 1890’s to provide an answer to the question 
“… how big a reservoir is required for a given demand given an historic inflow sequence?”
A mass curve of supply is a curve showing the total (cumulative) volume entering a reservoir site over a 
certain time period (usually years) as shown in Figure 6.3. Records are examined for critical dry periods 
and the mass curve may be constructed for multiple years. Flow data at monthly increments are usually 
sufficient.

b) Water balance method
This method is similar to the Mass Curve method which is also based on the past flow records. Instead 
of using a graph to derive reservoir storage information, water balance is applied with a table to solve the 
reservoir storage and spillage problem. Table 6.1 is for illustration only and there are many alternative 
ways to construct a water balance table.

Table 6.1 Water balance table
c) Synthetic minimum flow method
This method is based on probability analysis and synthetic flow data instead of the real flow data are 
used in the storage estimation. The procedure is formed as follows: 1) locate a long monthly flow record; 
2) select the lowest monthly flows in each year; 3) rank the minimum monthly values starting with the 
driest; 4) convert flow in m3/s to m3 (i.e., flow rate into runoff volume); 5) calculate the return period 
by T = (n+1)/m (In n year record, a record has been equal to or exceeded for m times); 6) the return 
periods should be plotted on a logarithmic paper; 7) draw a line that can best fit the data points; 8) read 
the value of 100 year return period (or any other return periods depending the required reliability) from 
the fitted line. If 100 year return period is chosen, the reservoir has to satisfy the water demand in a 
dry month with 100 year return period. In addition, the following month(s) might be very dry as well 
and the designers have to consider longer periods than just one dry month, so 2, or 3 or more months 
should be considered in the design (up to 11 months in most projects). By repeating the procedures 
described above, it is possible to obtain a diagram as shown in Figure 6.4 and the flow values in 1, 2 , 
3, 4, , …, 10, 11 months.

A synthetic mass curve can then be constructed from the cumulative minimum runoff data as shown 
in Figure 6.5. Each point is read from the logarithmic plots. If water demand is known, strike a tangent 
line (with the slope of the water demand) to the curve and the required storage can be found on the 
negative ordinate.

6.3	
Water Treatment
Water treatment is a system to make water acceptable for a desired usage, such as drinking water, industrial 
utilisation, etc. The water treatment process is to remove or reduce contaminates in the water to meet the 
required levels. In the case of drinking water, it should be potable and palatable. ‘Potable’ means water 
is healthy for human consumption (i.e., safe) without harmful microorganisms and organic/inorganic 
compounds that could cause adverse physiological effects. ‘Palatable’ refers to water that is free from 
turbidity, colour, odour and objectionable taste. Natural water usually contains various chemical and 
biological constituents.
6.3.1	
Characteristics of Water
Physical characteristics: used to characterise the water appearance. Turbidity measures water clarity (in 
NTU, nephelometric unit) and 5 NTU is the upper limit recommended by WHO. Colour is measured by 
apparent colour (unfiltered) or true colour (filtered by a 40
m
m
 screen so that the colour is mainly from 
dissolved constituents). Particles are measured by quantity and sizes (1 to 60
m
m
). They are generally 
not visible by eyes and may adsorb toxic metals or synthetic organic chemicals. Particles are called 
suspended solids if their sizes are >1
m
m
, colloidal particles if sizes are in 0.001-1

 and dissolved 
particles if sizes are <0.001

. Taste and odour come from dissolved organic/inorganic constituents 
and biological sources (e.g., decayed algae). Water temperature is very important and changes with 
seasons, which affects water physical, chemical and biological properties.

Chemical characteristics: used to describe various chemical constituents in water. Calcium is abundant 
in water and is a major constituent of water hardness (with magnesium). Chloride concentration can 
be high if water source is contaminated by brine water. Fluoride may exist in natural water or may be 
added artificially in some areas. Iron is frequently found in water and can create a brownish colour to 
bathroom fixtures. Nitrate (and other forms of nitrogen) may be found in surface and groundwater 
from urban and agricultural runoff (e.g., from ammonia fertilisers). Sulphur may occur as sulphates 
and reduced sulphides (in groundwater with low dissolved oxygen). Arsenic is widespread in the world, 
and is most serious in Bangladesh and India with hand-pimped wells. For organic constituents, natural 
organic matter (NOM) is derived from degraded vegetation and measured as total organic carbon 
(TOC). Synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) are due to industrial activities, urban runoff, etc. 
Biological characteristics: used to describe pathogenic microorganisms. Pathogens include many classes 
of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and helminths, which cause sickness or disease in 
their hosts. Since there are many different pathogens, it is not practical to monitor all of them. In reality, 
indicator organisms are identified and used in checking biological water quality. The commonly used 
ones are total coliforms, fecal coliform and E. coli. Clearly, although indicator organisms can usually 
provide a good indication of water biological quality, they cannot prove the water is safe and other 
methods must be used to confirm the absence of various pathogens if in doubts.

Water Quality Standards
The ideal drinking water quality standards should be based on health and risk assessment information 
(i.e., how much of the contaminant may be present with no adverse health effects). However, costs and 
availability of technology are usually considered for legally enforced standards (cost benefit analysis and 
available technology). Therefore there are no universally accepted standard in the world. Currently, USA, 
EU and WHO have set three leading standards. 
In the USA, the ideal drinking water standard under the Safe Drinking Water act is called MCLGs 
(maximum contaminant level goals) and the enforceable standard is called MCLs (maximum contaminant 
levels). MCLs should be as close as possible to MCLGs. The levels are normally expressed as a concentration 
in milligrams or micrograms per litre. For some contaminants, a treatment technique (TT) is set instead 
of an MCL. MCLs and TTs are the primary standards. More details can be found at the web site of the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (2012). Some contaminants may have unpleasant tastes 
or odours without causing health problems and they are regulated by the secondary standards.
In the EU, the Drinking Water Directive specifies the quality of water intended for human consumption 
and is part of the regulation of water supply and sanitation in the EU. For the contaminant parameters, 
the EU directive applies the precautionary principle and many of them are more stringent than the USA 
and WHO standards, because the EU directive not only aims at protecting human health but also the 
environment.
The WHO standard is useful for those counties without their own legislative standards. It can be found 
by typing ‘WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality’ in a search engine. A comparison among the 
standards from USA, EU and WHO can be found at Wikipedia ‘Drinking water quality standards’ (2012).
6.3.3	
Treatment Processes
The water treatment processes include the following 
Screen: coarse screens are firstly used to remove large solids such as tree branches and rubbish (about 
100mm spacing). Finer screens are then used to remove fine solids or algae before other treatments.
Storage reservoir: for surface water sources during high flows with heavy silt load, it is useful to store 
raw water in a storage reservoir to improve water quality before further treatment.

Water Supply
Adsorption: this is a physical process to remove soluble molecules by the attachment to the absorbent 
surface. Adsorbents have very large surface areas available for adsorption. The most widely used adsorbent 
is activated carbon and others (activated alumina, clay colloids, hydroxides, etc.) Adsorption is used to 
remove algae, reduce colour, odour and organic matters. Carbon (from peat, coal, etc.) is activated by 
high temperature or chemicals (acid, strong base or a salt). Activated carbon is used either as a powder 
added to water or as granules packed as a filter.
Coagulation and flocculation: this is used to remove particles and a portion of dissolved organic matter. 
A coagulant is a chemical to reduce the repulsive forces among particles so that the attractive forces are 
able to gather particles together. The most commonly used coagulant is alum. Selection of coagulants 
is influenced by coagulant type, particle type and concentration, water temperature and pH, cost and 
availability, etc. Too little coagulant is insufficient to neutralise the negative charge in the particles and 
too much coagulant would turn negatively charged particles to positive, which are unable to destabilise 
the particles. Jar Test is used to work out the correct coagulant and its proper dosage for the tested raw 
water. Coagulant is dispersed into the water stream by rapid mixing systems (pumped, stirred tank or 
in-line static mixer). After the coagulation, flocculation is used to aggregate the destabilised particles 
in order to form larger particles (i.e., floc), and is carried out via a flocculation system (vertical shaft 
turbine, horizontal shaft paddle wheel or hydraulic system).
Hardness removal: water with high mineral content is called hard water. Water hardness is usually 
measured by the total concentration of calcium and magnesium. Hard water is generally not harmful 
to human health (in contrary, hard water may provide dietary calcium and magnesium and reduce the 
solubility of potentially toxic metal ions such as lead and copper). With hard water, soap solutions form a 
white precipitate instead of lather, which makes the solution less effective in washing dishes and clothes. 
Hard water can be softened by ion exchange and precipitation methods.
Sedimentation and filtration: large particles from coagulation and flocculation are removed by 
sedimentation and filtration. Sedimentation is the process in which the majority of the particles (include 
flocs) settle by gravity and are then removed. Filtration is used to remove small particles and pathogens. 
Two types of filtration include granular filtration and membrane filtration. Backwashing is regularly used 
to flush captured particles away from the filter.

Disinfection: disinfection is used to control the numbers of pathogens in water (bacteria and viruses) to 
reduce the risk of infection to an acceptable level instead of sterilisation (to kill all forms of microbial 
life). There are two activities which include primary disinfection (inactivation of microorganisms) and 
secondary disinfection (keeping a disinfectant residual in the treated water). Generally disinfectants are 
classified as oxidising agents (e.g., chlorine and ozone) and physical agents (heat or UV radiation). Ozone 
is powerful and expensive but with no residual action for secondary disinfection to protect the water 
during distribution. Chlorination is less powerful but cheaper with a lasting residual effect (the most 
commonly used approach). UV radiation is widely used for small water treatment plants and individual 
households. It has no residual action so it must be used close to the point of use.
6.4	
Water Distribution
Treated water is sent to consumers by a water distribution system. The system uses a network of pipes 
(i.e., water mains) which include trunk mains and distribution mains. Trunk mains are large pipes for 
transporting water from its source to a treatment plant and then to a service reservoir or tower. No 
branch or service pipes are connected to trunk mains. In contrast, distribution mains are the highly 
branched network with connections to individual houses. Underground pipes are usually coloured for 
easy identification (e.g., water is blue, gas is yellow, electricity is black and telephone is grey).

Water Supply
Water demand changes with time during day and night. It is costly to design the treatment plant to 
meet the maximum demand. Service reservoirs and water towers are used to smooth the outflow to 
the average flow from the treatment plant. They are also a useful reserve if the treatment plant or trunk 
main fails. A service reservoir may serve up to 50,000 people and provide a storage for at least one day’s 
supply during the peak season. Individual households may have their own tanks to smooth the demand 
from the service reservoir.
Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system. Water tanks or towers may be used to 
maintain a suitable pressure range. Very high pressure is detrimental to plumbing fixtures and increases 
leakage. Low pressure results in a trickle of water at the tap and is insufficient for hydrant operations 
(required for fire fighting). Normally, water pressure should be between 30 - 75 meters of water head. 
A pressure regulator (or pressure reducer) may be used to allow high water pressure to be reduced to a 
safe value at each point where the water enters a building or a house.

Wastewater
The used water from water customers needs to be collected for safe disposal, as a part of human sanitation 
systems. In a narrow sense, sanitation refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal 
of human urine and faeces. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving 
sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on human health. In a broad sense, sanitation 
is the hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of 
wastes, which can be physical, microbiological, biological or chemical agents, including human and 
animal urine and faeces, solid wastes, domestic wastewater, industrial wastes and agricultural wastes. 
Hygienic means of prevention could be engineering solutions (e.g. sewerage and wastewater treatment) 
or simple technologies (e.g. latrines, septic tanks).
Sewage includes household waste liquid from toilets, baths, showers, kitchens, sinks and so forth that is 
disposed of via sewers. The separation and draining of household waste into greywater and blackwater 
is becoming more common in the developed world, with greywater being permitted to be used for 
watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets. A sanitary sewer (also called a foul sewer) is a system 
specifically for transporting sewage from houses and commercial buildings to wastewater treatment 
plants. A separate drainage system is constructed to carry the stormwater runoff. Sewers carrying both 
sewage and stormwater together are called combined sewers and they were common in old urban sewage 
systems. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary 
sewers because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing wastewater treatment plant efficiency. 
In extreme cases, heavy volumes of stormwater runoff may overwhelm the wastewater treatment system, 
causing a spill (called Combined Sewer Overflows, i.e., CSO). Solutions to such a problem include 
CSO storage, wastewater treatment plant expansion, SuDS, and construction of a separate stormwater 
drainage system.
For stormwater drainage systems, as rainfall travels over roofs and the ground, it may pick up various 
contaminants including soil particles and other sediment, heavy metals, organic compounds, animal 
waste, and oil and grease. Fertiliser use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a significant source 
of nitrates and phosphorus in urban runoff, resulting in possible eutrophication in receiving water bodies. 
Most municipal storm sewer systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers or seas. Possible 
solution to such urban runoff problems include SuDS (Sustainable drainage systems) or/and some basic 
treatments before being discharged directly into receiving water bodies such as retention basins, wetlands, 
buried vaults with media filters, and vortex separators (to remove coarse solids).

Water Pollution
7	 Water Pollution
Water pollution refers to the introduction of a substance to the environment at levels leading to lost 
beneficial use of a resource or degradation of the health of humans, wild life or ecosystems. Pollution 
may be caused by point sources at stationary locations such as an effluent pipe or nonpoint sources (also 
called diffuse sources) such as land runoff and the atmosphere. The mass flux of a pollutant is expressed 
as a load in mass per unit time.
7.1	
Main Pollutants
Organic waste: Organic matters in water are composed of organic compounds. Generally, most carbon-
containing compounds are organic (excluding steel and simple oxides of carbon). Organic compounds 
include natural compounds (e.g., living organism) which are capable of decay and synthetic compounds 
(e.g., plastics) which may not be biodegradable. Certain organic matters in water are a source of food for 
aquatic microorganisms that use dissolved oxygen to convert the organic matters into energy for growth 
and carbon dioxide & water. The microorganism population increases in proportion to the amount of 
organic matters. If microbial metabolism consumes dissolved oxygen faster than atmospheric oxygen 
can dissolve into the water, oxygen deficit will occur and aquatic life may die when oxygen is depleted 
by microbial metabolism. In rivers, oxygen depletion follows a special form as illustrated in Figure 7.1 
named the dissolved oxygen sag curve. The oxygen concentration in the river drops rapidly following 
organic waste pollution. Later, as the organic matter is decomposed, the oxygen resources of the river 
are replenished. Not all organic matters can be decomposed by microorganisms and in contrast, nearly 
all organic matters can be fully oxidised to carbon dioxide with a strong oxidising agent under acidic 
conditions.

Water Pollution
Many organic matters are synthetic and not biodegradable (termed refractory organic matters). They 
include pesticides, detergents and petroleum hydrocarbons. Some pesticides and other refractory organics 
are the principal agents responsible for the decline of certain ecosystem species and are the threats to 
human health.
Suspended solids: solids in water may come from mining activities, river dredging, construction (e.g., 
road and bridge) and soil erosion. The increased turbidity reduces light penetration and depresses 
photosynthesis of ecosystems. Species diversity and abundance are affected.
Nutrients: nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur,…) in water encourages plant growth (usually in 
the form of algae). Those nutrients come from domestic, industrial and agricultural waste. Effluent 
from wastewater treatment plants may still contain large concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus 
albeit sufficient treatment processes have been carried out. Diffuse pollution from agricultural waste is a 
major source of nutrients, especially nitrogen. Nutrient enriched water is more productive with excessive 
biological activities and water quality is usually significantly degraded (e.g., eutrophication).
Thermal pollution: industrial cooling processes (e.g., fossil and nuclear power plants) discharge heated 
water into water bodies with effects on reduced solubility of O2 and altered speed of chemical reactions. 
Thermal pollution changes the natural temperature regime of a water system and the affected ecosystem 
could be stressed. Some aquatic species may die or are forced to relocate.

Water Pollution
Toxic metals: they are metals that form poisonous soluble compounds. Toxicity is linked with solubility 
and is directly proportional to its ability to cause environmental damage. Metals, particularly heavy 
metals are toxic (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic). Lighter metals may also have toxicity, such as 
beryllium and on the other hand, not all heavy metals are toxic (e.g., iron, which is essential for life). 
Toxic metal pollutions have many sources, but most commonly arise from purification of metals, mining, 
irrigation with wastewater, vehicle exhaust emissions. 
Pathogens and carcinogens: those are disease-causing microorganisms or cancer-causing substances 
including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, dioxins, etc. Domestic wastewater is responsible for many of the 
pathogens, and industrial and agricultural wastes are the usual sources for carcinogens.
Radioactive contamination: in the natural world, there is always radiation being emitted from 
radionuclides. Radioactive contamination refers to unintended or undesirable presence of radiative 
substances in water, usually from the leakage of stored radioactive materials or release from nuclear 
power plant accidents, etc.
7.2	
Water Pollution Indicators
The indicators on water pollution are in three categories: physical (temperature, turbidity, total suspended/
dissolved solids), chemical (pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, COD, BOD, pesticides, metals) and biological 
(EPT index, Trent biotic index) indicators. Most of them have been explained already in the book and 
only a few indicators are further explained here.
Oxygen saturation: the maximum amount of oxygen dissolved in water at a given temperature is called 
the saturation concentration. It is determined by Henry’s law and varies from 14.6mg O2/L at 0oC to 7.6 
mg O2/L at 30oC. As a result, fish with high oxygen demand prefer cold waters. The oxygen demanding 
wastes have greater impacts on water quality in the summer as well as during dry seasons since lower river 
flow has less capacity to dilute the waste. Under rare occasions, actual oxygen concentration may exceed 
the saturation value when algae and macrophytes are photosynthesising and producing dissolved oxygen. 
Such oversaturation is not stable and is eliminated when sufficient turbulence occurs. Dissolved oxygen 
(DO) can be measured by oxygen sensors (such as zirconia sensor, Clark-type electrode and Optodes).
Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is the amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to break 
down in organic matters. It is used as an indicator of organic pollution of water. BOD is expressed in 
mg O2/L and can be measured in different ways. The most common method is carried out by mixing 
water sample with a small amount of microorganism seed (e.g., analogous to adding yeast to flour 
dough). The sample is tested to measure its dissolved oxygen (DO) before it is sealed in the dark to 
prevent further oxygen to be dissolved or generated by photosynthesis. After 5 day’s incubation at 200C, 
the dissolved oxygen is measured again and the difference between those two DO measurements is the 
BOD (initial DO - final DO). Dilution of the sample with oxygen saturated water may be used if organic

Water Pollution
matters in the sample are highly concentrated and the dilution ration should be included in the BOD 
calculation. Incubation durations other than 5 days have been tested before such as 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 
days and BOD5 is commonly adopted which represents about 68% of the total BOD (in contrast, 90% 
of the BOD in 10 days and 99% of the total BOD in 20 days). BOD biosensor and software sensor are 
alternative measurement methods which are much faster (e.g., 30 minutes), but they are less reliable 
than the BOD5 method. The BOD test results are normally with 10 or twenty percent uncertainties. If 
the water contains toxic chemicals capable of suppressing microbiological growth (e.g., industrial wastes, 
antibiotics in medical waste, commercial cleaning agent, chlorination disinfectant residuals), the BOD 
test results would be much lower. The amount and types of enzymes would also influence the BOD test 
results. In addition, some biodegradable organic matters can only degrade anaerobically such as cellulose 
and BOD test (depending on aerobic microorganisms) will not include those.
Typical BOD5 values: pristine water: up to 1mg/L; moderately polluted water: 2 to 8 mg/L; treated 
sewage (by three stages): up to 20 mg/L; untreated sewage: 600 mg/L in Europe and 200 mg/L in USA 
(due to the dilution from more water consumption).
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) measures organic matters which are both biodegradable and non-
biodegradable, hence it covers a more broad spectrum of organic matters. As a result, the COD in a water 
sample is always higher the BOD. The ratio of COD/BOD provides a good indication to the proportion 
of organic matters that are biodegradable (COD/BOD usually varies from 1.25 to 2.50). In rivers, BOD 
gives a more useful estimate of the possible oxygen demand than COD and is more widely used as a 
measure of organic strength in the polluted water.
Biological indicators are useful to get a general reading of water quality without the high cost of lab 
scale analysis. Various indices are used to represent the states of macro-invertebrates. They are in two 
types: 1) pollution indices (existence or absence of indicator species); 2) diversity indices (to indicate 
the overall effect of all pollutants). However, biological indices are not always reliable. Factors other than 
pollution can affect the biological indices. Absence of some species may reflect its normal life cycle and 
quantitative sampling of biodiversity is difficult.
7.3	
Wastewater Treatment
Wastewater treatment plants receive inflows from domestic, commercial, agricultural and industrial users, 
storm water runoff and infiltration. Industrial wastes may contain heavy metals, radioactive materials 
refractory organics, which may be treated on site following specific guidelines. Domestic wastewater is 
commonly treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants. A main purpose for wastewater treatment 
is to control pollution of a receiving water body (river, lake, groundwater, sea). Raw wastewater is highly 
polluted with about 0.5kg pollutants/m3. The most common wastewater constituents include organic 
matters (measured by BOD and COD), suspended solids, pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms), 
nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), toxic chemicals (heavy metals, pesticides), and others (emerging 
chemicals such as perfumes, pharmaceuticals).

To design an effective treatment system, it is important to 1) identify the characteristics of raw wastewater; 
2) set treatment objectives; 3) integrate unit treatment operations; 4) assess the system in view of green 
engineering, life cycle thinking and sustainability. From Google Maps, it is quite convenient to locate a 
wastewater treatment plant around cities (Figure 7.2).
 Figure 7.2 Aerial view of wastewater treatment plant, Davyhulme, Manchester, UK (Google maps, 2012)
The treatment units include: pre-treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, tertiary treatment, 
disinfection and sludge treatment.
Pre-treatment: to remove coarse solids using screening, to remove grits using grit chambers, to remove 
fats and greases using flotation and to maintain a stable flow using an equalisation basin.
Primary treatment: to remove solids through gravity settling using settling (sedimentation) tanks (the 
removal rates are 60% suspended solids, 30% BOD, 20% phosphorus). Coagulants can be added at this 
stage to improve its effectiveness.

Water Pollution
Secondary treatment: to remove dissolved organic matters using microorganisms (biological treatment). 
The most common biological treatment system is the activated sludge process. Effluent from primary 
treatment is sent to an aeration tank to be mixed with a diverse mass of microorganisms of bacteria, fungi, 
rotifers and protozoa. Oxygen is added to maintain the dissolved oxygen at 2mg/L by forcing air into the 
system (further higher level of oxygen would demand more energy to force the air without significant 
improvement to the system efficiency). After the process is finished, effluent is sent to the next stage and 
the settled sludge with microorganisms is removed from the system (with a small portion pumped to 
the aeration tank as microorganism seeds). At the end of this treatment, biologically degradable organic 
matters are decomposed and microorganisms are nutrient starved (or activated) as activated sludge. This 
process was first invented at Davyhulme sewage works in 1913 (Figure 7.1).
Tertiary treatment: mainly to remove nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). It has been 
found that 90% of total nitrogen and 75% of the total phosphorus from household effluent are found in 
urine and a dual sewer system to hand separate urine and faeces would help to reduce the cost in removing 
them in the combined wastewater. In a wastewater treatment plant, nitrogen is removed by nitrification 
(ammonia->nitrite ->nitrate) and denitrification (nitrate -> nitrogen gas) reactions. Phosphorus can 
be removed either biologically or chemically. In the enhanced biological phosphorus removal, specific 
bacteria (polyphosphate) are used to accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells and 
these bacteria are separated from the treated water as a fertiliser. Alternatively, phosphorus can also be 
removed by chemical precipitation (such as alum). Chemical phosphorus removal is easier to operate 
and often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal.

Water Pollution
Disinfection: to remove pathogenic microorganisms using ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium 
hypochlorite. Unlike drinking water, any disinfectant residual is not desirable in the effluent of a 
wastewater treatment plant. In the UK, ultraviolet light is widely used because of the concerns about 
the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics 
in the receiving water.
Sludge treatment: to treat and store the sludge from the treatment processes. To reduce sludge unpleasing 
odour and pathogens, sludge stabilisation is carried out by either aerobic digestion (more energy 
demanding due to mechanical aeration) or anaerobic digestion (more popular due to its low energy cost 
and methane production). Dewatering is adopted to reduce the water in the sludge before disposal. A 
drying bed (with an underneath drainage system) is the simplest and cost-effective dewatering method. 
Mechanical devices can also be used to produce a sludge cake using belt squeezing or centrifugal force. 
Disposal: dewatered sludge may be buried in a landfill (carbon sequestration), incinerated (with a 
potential problem in air pollution), applied to agricultural land (as fertiliser). Tight control of hazardous 
waste from industries and households is needed to prevent harmful contamination of the sludge. 
Pathogens in the sludge should be controlled by heating or chemical treatment if it is applied to areas 
open to the public (e.g., city parks).
Natural treatment system: wetlands are an alternative wastewater treatment method. A wetland uses 
soil-water-air-vegetation environment to treat wastewater. Wastewater should be treated by a primary 
system to remove the influent solids (by settling) before it is treated in a wetland. ‘Living Machine’ is a 
trademark and brand name for a ecological wastewater treatment system designed to mimic the cleansing 
functions of wetlands. Aquatic and wetland plants, bacteria, algae, protozoa, plankton, snails and other 
organisms are used in the system to provide specific cleansing or trophic functions.
Septic tank: A septic tank is a small-scale sewage treatment system in areas with no connection to 
main sewage pipes, usually in suburbs and small towns as well as rural areas. The term “septic” refers 
to the anaerobic bacterial environment that develops in the tank to decompose or mineralise the waste 
discharged into the tank. A septic tank generally consists of a tank connected to an inlet wastewater pipe 
at one end and a septic drain field at the other. Septic tank requires no power. A properly designed and 
normally operated septic system is odour-free. Waste left by the anaerobic digestion has to be removed 
from the septic tank by pumping, which is taken every a few years (some are up to 20 years). In areas 
with high population density, groundwater pollution from septic tanks may be a problem.

Water Quality Modelling
Water quality models are used to analyse environmental systems and predict water quality changes due 
to modifications in catchments and wastewater treatment plants. The prediction provides a basis for 
engineers to carry out economic analysis to evaluate various options to improve the environment.

Water quality models are based on 1) the law of conservation of mass (material transport into and out 
of the control volume as a physical process) and 2) the change of substances in the control volume 
(transformation of the substances due to biological and/or chemical processes). Material transport refers 
to the movement of the substances from one point to another, which involves advection (movement with 
the fluid) and diffusion or dispersion (spread in the fluid due to differences in concentration). 
The following water quality models are widely used:

subcatchment areas on which rainfall-runoff is generated. The routing portion of SWMM transports this 
runoff through a conveyance system of pipes, channels, storage/treatment devices, pumps, and regulators. 
SWMM tracks the quantity and quality of runoff generated within each subcatchment, and the flow 
rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period comprised 
of multiple time steps. It can be downloaded at

Water Quality Standards for Pollution Management
Water pollution is usually managed by following water quality standards. Water quality standards are 
established by legal authority to define the level of pollutants allowed in a water system. There are three 
types of standards: receiving water standards and effluent standards. Receiving water standards refer 
to water quality standards for receiving water bodies (rivers, lakes, sea waters) and effluent standards 
refer to the quality of effluents discharged to receiving waters. The aim of both types of standards is 
to achieve the desired quality of a water system. The receiving water standards consider the use of the 
water system (swimming, irrigation, drinking, industry). Effluent standards set the required maximum 
pollutant concentration to be achieved or degrees of treatment required before discharge. Both standards 
are regulated and should be met. Water quality standards must be reasonable so that dischargers should 
be able to achieve the standards through the available technology.
The European Community Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) (WFD) provides an integrated 
approach to the protection, improvement and sustainable use of Europe’s rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal 
waters and groundwater. WFD uses a holistic approach to managing the water cycle. The Directive defines 
‘surface water status’ as the general expression of the status of a body of surface water, determined by the 
poorer of its ecological status and its chemical status. Thus, to achieve ‘good surface water status’ both 
the ecological status and the chemical status of a surface water body need to be at least ‘good’. Ecological 
status refers to the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems of the surface waters. 
Good ecological status is defined locally as being lower than a theoretical reference point of pristine 
conditions, i.e. in the absence of anthropogenic influence. However, there are criticisms on WFD with 
the assumption that any anthropogenic influence is bad for an environment and a body of water polluted 
by natural occurring algae would be regarded as “good”. This would prevent an anthropogenic clean-up 
operation. Another point is ‘the theoretical reference point’ doesn’t take weather variations into account.
In the United States, water quality standards are created by state agencies for different types of water 
bodies and their desired uses. The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law in the United States 
governing water pollution. The act establishes the goals of eliminating releases of high amounts of toxic 
substances into water, eliminating additional water pollution, and ensuring that surface waters would 
meet standards necessary for human sports and recreation. The Clean Water Act does not directly address 
groundwater contamination and groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking 
Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act.
Water quality regulated by ISO is covered in the section of ICS 13.060, ranging from water sampling, 
drinking water, industrial class water, sewage water, and examination of water for chemical, physical or 
biological properties. ICS 91.140.60 covers the standards of water supply systems.

Solid Waste Management
8	 Solid Waste Management
Solid wastes are defined as unwanted materials that are no longer of values to their owners (albeit they 
may be still of values to other parties). They are generated from various human and animal activities. 
Each year, billions of tones of solid wastes are generated which are in need of proper treatment. Improper 
management of solid wastes has direct adverse effects on human health and the environment (e.g., 
polluting rivers and groundwater sources and generating foul air).
8.1	
Sources and Composition
The information on waste composition and generation rate is important for proper planning, treatment 
and disposal of solid wastes, which depends on their sources and types (Table 8.1). Some solid wastes 
(e.g., industrial, agricultural and mining) are managed by the waste producers. In this chapter, the focus 
is on the municipal solid wastes (MSW) which include residential, commercial, institutional, construction 
and demolition.

 solid wastes (coal, metal, oil/gas, …)
Another way to classify wastes is to divide them into: biodegradable (spoiled food, green waste), 
recyclable (paper, glass bottles, cans), inert (construction and demolition waste), electrical and electronic 
(TVs, computers, screens, etc.), composite wastes (waste clothing, Tetra Packs, waste plastics such as 
toys), hazardous (paints, chemicals, fluorescent tubes, spray cans, fertiliser), toxic (pesticide, herbicides, 
fungicides), medical (pharmaceutical drugs).
As a rough rule of thumb, the residential waste generation in industrial countries is about 1 kg per person 
per day and the total MSW is about 1 tonne per person per year. The composition and quantities of solid 
wastes change with time and vary between different countries (and regions).

Solid Waste Management
There several ways to collect solid waste information: 1) literature review (the information is collected 
from the past data in the literature); 2) input-output analysis (this is based on the consumption data to 
estimate wastes); 3) sampling survey (collection of actual data by sampling survey. It needs one or two 
years of survey to smooth out seasonal changes. A large number of samples are needed to reduce the 
uncertainty).
8.2	
Waste Properties
Solid waste management options depend on physical and chemical characteristics of the waste. Waste 
generation rates are expressed in mass unit (e.g., kg/m3) instead of volume unit. This is because waste 
densities vary greatly among the wastes with different compaction at different stages in the waste system 
(collection, storage and disposal). For example, the density for mixed loose MSW wastes is 90-180 kg/m3, 
300-420 kg/m3 in compactor truck, 480-770 kg/m3 in initial landfill and 700-1100 kg/m3 in overburden 
landfill. Further details can be found in Diaz et al. 2003.

and the dry mass weight can be found as
dry mass=total mass of waste (1 - moisture content) 
(8.2)
The information on waste moisture content is used to derive dry mass of the received waste. In addition, 
for energy recovery design, it is important to know the energy content in wastes. Plastic and paper have 
high energy content and low moisture content. In contrast, garden wastes are less productive in energy 
release due to their high moisture content. The physical and chemical characteristics for some common 
solid wastes are listed in Table 8.2. It should be noted that the values in the table may vary significantly 
with local factors such as weather and season (e.g., garden waste’s moisture content can change from 
20% in dry autumn to 80% in wet summer after a rainfall event).

Solid Waste System
8.3.1	
Storage, Collection and Transport
This part of the waste system typically accounts for 40 to 80 percent of the total cost. For residential 
wastes, the most common collection method is kerbside. The wastes are usually segregated into different 
containers according to waste types (food, garden waste, recyclable) as shown in Figure 8.1. Different 
trucks may be used to collect those containers. Commercial and institutional wastes generally need 
larger storage containers and use a separate system for waste collection. Drop-off stations for recyclables 
are also a valuable part of a waste collection system where people can drop their wastes. They are more 
efficient for trucks to pick up at a few key points instead of travelling along all the streets to pick up 
individual household containers (Figure 8.2). For old cities with narrow roads or high density urban 
areas, the Automated Vacuum Collection (AVAC) system is able to transport waste at high speed through 
underground tunnels to a collection station where it is compacted and sealed in containers. When the 
container is full, it is transported away and emptied by trucks. The system cannot carry large items such as 
furniture, construction wastes or glass which may break apart and sends shards flying through the tubes. 
For large cities and towns, transfer stations are often used as places where local waste collection vehicles 
will deposit their waste cargo prior to loading into larger vehicles. These larger vehicles (specialised with 
higher efficiency for heavy load) will transport the waste to the end point of disposal in an incinerator, 
landfill, hazardous waste facility, or for recycling.

8.3.2	
 Recycling 
Recycling is to convert wastes into new products. It can reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, 
energy usage, air pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfill). Recyclable materials 
include glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics. Plastics recycling is very challenging due to 
a diverse range of plastic types. To help with plastics recycling, an international resin code is marked 
on most plastic products with numbers 1 to 7 (1: PET for soft drink and water bottles; 2: HDPE for 
milk bottles; 3: PVC for shampoo bottle, windows, and piping; 4: LDPE for shopping bags, squeezable 
bottles; 5: PP for syrup bottles and straws; 6: PS for egg cartons, compact disc cases; 7: all other plastics). 
Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled. Wastepaper is of higher value when the paper fibres are 
longer and less contaminated by impurities (e.g., office papers are of higher value than glossy magazines). 
Aluminium is of high value due to the high energy required to process aluminium ore. Ferrous metals 
(iron, steel) have been traditionally recovered by scrap metal processors. Although the system to process 
waste glass into new glass is well developed, the large cost of transportation to a glass smelter could make it 
impractical. Some debris from construction and demolition could be reused (such as tiles, bricks)/recycled 
(metal, stone, concrete). Sometimes there is a limit on the times of recycling circles (e.g., materials such 
as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling).
Separation of recyclable wastes can be done either by machines or human. Magnets can separate ferrous 
metals. Papers and plastics may be separated by their differences in density and sizes using screens, shaking 
tables, burst of air and rotating sieves. Glass materials with different colours and aluminium materials 
can also be separated by machines. In many situations, people are still needed to aid the separation of 
waste materials (e.g., to pick up specific wastes from a conveyor). Materials to be recycled are either 
brought to a collection centre or picked up from the kerbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed 
into new materials bound for manufacturing. Successful recycling requires careful consideration of the 
processing capacity and the markets for the recycled goods (e.g., a potential demand for the recycled 
products). If neither of them exists, recycling is incomplete and in fact only “collection”.

Solid Waste Management
The cost-benefit of recycling is complex. Economically, a major benefit is the reduced landfill costs. Other 
benefits can be worked out by comparing the market cost of recyclable material to the cost of new raw 
materials. What is difficult to estimate is externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue 
to individuals outside of market transactions, such as decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases 
from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, reduced energy consumption, and 
reduced waste and resource consumption, etc. For example, creating a new piece of plastic may cause 
more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not 
be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities 
and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavourable market costs. Alternatively, 
legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market 
cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.
8.3.3	
Composting
Composting is a microbial process used to treat biodegradable wastes. This is similar to aerobic wastewater 
treatment. Composting has several purposes: 1) to reduce waste mass; 2) to reduce pollution potential; 
3) to destroy pathogens; and 4) to produce compost as nutrients for gardens, landscaping and agriculture 
(organic farming). 
This processing is suitable for garden waste, food waste, paperboard, etc. Composting organisms require 
four equally important things to work effectively: carbon (to produce heat by the microbial oxidation 
of carbon), nitrogen (to grow and reproduce more organisms), oxygen (for oxidising the carbon as part 
of the decomposition process) and water (to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions). 
The most efficient composting occurs with a carbon: nitrogen mix of about 30 to 1. Nearly all plant 
and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely. When one waste is not 
compostable on its own, its mixing with other materials may help to build a proper carbon : nitrogen 
mix, air porosity and pH.
Composting requires making a heap of wetted organic matter and waiting for the materials to break down 
into humus after a period of weeks or months. Modern composting is a multi-step, closely monitored 
process with measured inputs of water, air and well mixed organic materials. The decomposition process 
is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the 
mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the material. Aerobic bacteria manage the chemical process 
by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted 
by bacteria into plant-nourishing nitrites and nitrates through the process of nitrification. In addition 
to the traditional compost pile, various approaches have been developed to handle different composting 
processes, ingredients, locations, and applications for the composted product (Grub composting, 
Bokashi composting, Compost tea, Hügelkultur, Humanure and Vermicompost). Nowadays, industrial 
composting systems are increasingly being installed as a waste management alternative to landfills.

8.3.4	
Incineration
Incineration (waste-to-energy, energy recovery) is a process to liberate the energy in waste by combustion. 
This is suitable for wastes with high energy content, low moisture content and low ash content, which 
include paper, plastics, textiles, rubber, leather and wood. Incineration produces two solid by-products: 
bottom ash (unburnt waste) and fly ash (suspended particulate matter). Both of them contain hazardous 
matters in need of careful management. Incinerators reduce the solid mass of the original waste by 80–85% 
and the volume by 95-96 %, therefore the requirement for landfill is significantly reduced.
Air pollution control is required to limit emissions of particulates, volatile metals, nitrous oxides and 
incomplete combustion products. It has been found that modern incineration plants emit fewer particles, 
hydrocarbons and less SO2, CO and NOx than coal-fired power plants, but still more than natural gas 
fired power plants. An aerial photo in Figure 8.4 illustrates the visible air pollution at the Edmonton 
Solid Waste Incineration Plant in London. Odour pollution can be a problem with old-style incinerators, 
but odours and dust are extremely well controlled in newer incineration plants. An issue that affects 
community relationships is the increased road traffic of waste collection vehicles to transport waste to 
the incinerator. This problem can be avoided to an extent through the transport of waste by rail from 
transfer stations and locating incinerators in industrial areas.
Incineration systems have high initial cost, but its operational cost can be offset by savings in waste 
transport, landfill and recovered energy. They are suitable for regions where land values, energy costs 
and transport costs are high. In the USA and EU, incineration is playing an increasing role in solid waste 
management. There are six commonly used incineration systems: 1) Mass-burn (for unsegregated solid 
wastes); 2) Modular (small incinerators for specific wastes such as medical wastes); 3) Refused-derived 
fuel (energy rich wastes as fuel to power plants); 4) Co-incineration (to combine with production waste); 
5) Hazardous waste (pathogens and toxins destroyed by high temperature); and 6) Cement kilns (as fuel 
for cement production).

Solid Waste Management
8.3.5	
Landfill
A landfill site is a site for the disposal of solid wastes by burial (Figure 8.5). This is the oldest form of 
waste treatment and the most common method for waste disposal in many places of the world. In a 
landfill, wastes are packed into solid forms and covered to insulate them from water and air (usually 
everyday with layers of soil). Leachate is a liquid drained from the landfill as a contaminated wastewater. 
In a new landfill with oxygen still available, organic matters decompose and carbon dioxide is produced. 
As time goes by, the remaining oxygen is consumed and an anaerobic condition leads to the production 
of methane gas. 
Landfill involves siting, engineering design, construction, operation, monitoring and closure. Landfills 
should be located with a minimum risk to the environment and society (e.g., to avoid floodplains, 
active geological faults, drinking-water catchments, etc.). Geographical Information System (GIS) is a 
useful tool in helping design engineers in site selection. The landfill gas is a source of energy to produce 
electricity. The amount of methane produced from the landfill is about 100 L/kg. Half-lives for methane 
production vary widely depending on waste compositions (from 1 to 35 years). Although landfill is 
covered, small quantity of water may still be able to get through to produce leachate. Concentration 
of leachate constituents changes with time and is usually much higher than those in untreated urban 
sewage. Hydraulic barriers to cover and underlie the landfill should be constructed with compacted clay 
and geomembranes to limit the rainfall infiltration and leachate leaking. A collection system based on 
gravity is used to convey leachate to a sump within the landfill and then to be pumped out to a storage 
location. Landfill leachate is similar to urban sewage and the collected leachate should be sent to a 
wastewater treatment plant by pipe or truck. A landfill requires careful management over its lifetime 
aided by a sound monitoring system. In recent years, some countries, such as Germany, Austria, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, and Switzerland, have banned the disposal of untreated waste in landfills, and only 
the ashes from incineration or the stabilised output of mechanical biological treatment plants may still 
be deposited.

Alternative Technologies
In addition to the aforementioned traditional technologies, many new approaches are undergoing 
development. They include anaerobic digestion, alcohol/ethanol production, biodrying, gasification, 
in-vessel composting, mechanical biological treatment, mechanical heat treatment, plasma arc waste 
disposal, pyrolysis, tunnel composting, UASB (applied to solid wastes), and waste autoclave. Further 
details on them can be found in Wikipedia ‘List of solid waste treatment technologies’.
8.4	
Solid Waste Management
Solid waste management is a complex task and requires a systems approach. The combination of 
different components should be considered as a whole in a holistic way to serve the need of the current 
and future generations. Although economy of scale means larger landfills, incinerators and composting 
plants are more economically efficient, they would increase transport cost and are more likely to face 
public opposition. Consultation with stakeholders is an important step for any successful solid waste 
management. Stakeholders with direct and indirect interests in solid waste management may include 
neighbours, local communities, wider communities, media, government agencies and various social 
interest groups. Good policy should be developed by analysing policy options with assessment in costs 
and benefits, risks and unintended effects. The priority in a waste management policy is to reduce the 
wastes and followed by ‘reuse’ and ‘recycle’ (the 3 Rs). The three Rs are expanded in Europe into a 
waste hierarchy as shown in Figure 8.6 which classifies waste management strategies according to their 
desirability (reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery, and disposal).

Air Pollution
9	 Air Pollution
The Earth is surrounded by gases called air which forms the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a complex 
dynamic natural system essential to support life on the Earth. The air interacts with water and land. 
Acid rain falling on the ground is a result of air pollution. Many pollutants such as particulate matters, 
heavy metal, and ozone are able to influence water quality and ecosystem functions. On the other hand, 
polluted rivers/lakes and sewage systems can cause air pollution in their surrounding areas. Therefore, 
it is important for a water engineer to understand the air and its related quality issues, and vice versa 
for an air quality engineer to understand water pollutions.
9.1	
Composition of Air
The composition of dry air is listed in Table 9.1. This table changes with time (e.g., CO2 concentration 
has been in increase with time). Air also normally contains water vapour (variable, about 1% - 4% at 
surface), dust, pollen, spores, sea spray, volcanic ash, and various industrial pollutants. The greenhouse 
gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone (bold formulas in Table 
9.1). The air density at sea level is 1.2kg/m3 and it decreases with the increasing height.

Structure of the Atmosphere
The earth atmosphere has distinctive layers with a total mass of 5×1018 kg, three quarters of which is 
within the bottom 11 km. The atmosphere becomes progressively thinner with altitude without abrupt 
boundary. However, the Kármán line at an altitude of 100 kilometres above the Earth’s sea level is 
commonly used as the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. Beyond this altitude, the 
atmosphere becomes too thin to provide sufficient aerodynamic lift to support any aeronautical vehicles 
within the orbital speed of the earth.
The atmospheric is divided into several layers based on temperature profiles as shown in Figure 9.1.
Troposphere: it ranges from 9km at the poles to 17 km at the equators (it varies with seasons as well). 
This layer is heated by energy transfer from the ground surface and temperature decreases with altitude. 
It contains 80% of the atmospheric mass and 99% of its water vapour (supplied from the surface by 
evaporation and transpiration). Since saturation water vapour pressure decreases as temperature drops, 
the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere decreases with height. 
In the lowest part of the troposphere, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is directly influenced by its 
contact with the ground surface. Within PBL, the wind is affected by surface drag (hence turbulent) and 
moves across the isobars (while above PBL, the wind is along the isobars). The wind speed increases with 
the altitude in a power law form with a zero value at the ground surface due to the non-slip condition.

Air Pollution
The turbulence causes vertical mixing in the air, which plays an important role in pollutant dispersion. 
PBL’s depth varies widely between 50m (e.g., in a calm night) to 2000m (e.g., in a hot afternoon) with 
a typical value of 300m in mid-latitudes.
Stratosphere: it extends from the tropopause (the top of the troposphere) to about 50 km. In contrast to 
the troposphere, the temperature here increases with height due to increased absorption of ultraviolet 
radiation by the ozone layer. It has restricted turbulence and mixing due to its temperature profile 
(warmer air above colder air), hence it is dynamically stable (i.e., no regular convection and turbulence). 
Airliners usually fly at the bottom of the stratosphere to take advantage of the thin air for reduced drag 
and to avoid extreme turbulence in the troposphere.
 Figure 9.1 The US standard atmosphere (Wikipedia, 2012)
Mesosphere: this is from 50km to 80km with its temperature decreasing in height. Atmospheric tide, 
gravity wave and planetary wave are featured here. Millions of meteors collided with the earth are mostly 
melted or vaporised in this layer.
Thermosphere: it ranges from 80km to 350~800km (it varies with solar activity). The air is very thin 
here and stable with increasing temperature (up to 1500 oC).

Transport of Air
The movement of air is divided in two categories: the outdoor environment (ambient air) and indoor 
environment. 
Global transport: among the layers of the atmosphere, the two layers near the Earth surface are more 
relevant to air pollution. The troposphere is the primary place to receive the pollution emissions from 
human and nature. The processes of transport and transformation influence the fate of the pollutant. 
Due to its stable temperature profile, there is little mixing in the stratosphere. The strong solar radiation 
(especially ultraviolet) in this layer converts oxygen (O2) into ozone (O3) by photochemical reaction to 
create the well known ozone layer. Over the globe, there exist large scale air movements as shown in 
Figure 9.2 due to uneven solar radiation distribution and rotation of the Earth. It can be seen that air 
does not obey geopolitical boundaries and air pollution can be trans-boundary. 
 Figure 9.2 Global air circulation (Wikipedia, 2012)
Regional transport: high and low air pressures dominate regional air transport. Low pressure is created 
when air is warmed to rise by surface heating. High pressure is created when air descends to the ground. 
Air tends to move from a high pressure area to a low pressure area. In a low pressure region, air quality 
may improve due to dispersion and precipitation cleansing.
Local transport: due to the different temperatures between land and sea in the coastal area, the wind 
direction changes during the morning and evening as shown in Figure 9.3. In the morning, cleaner air 
moves to the land and is then polluted by human activities. Pollutant concentration increases as the air 
moves further inland. In the evening, the opposite wind movement occurs with the polluted air moves 
to the sea (and with its impact on the sea aquatic ecosystem). Understanding such a diurnal movement 
is important for coastal residents to cope with air pollution problems in the area.

Indoor air: indoor air quality has a significant impact on human health. Design of ventilation system in 
a building influences temperature, humidity and pollutant movement. Natural ventilation systems use 
outdoor wind and differences of indoor/outdoor temperature. They are based on the pressure creased by 
outdoor air striking a building (positive on the windward and negative on the leeside), and the pressure 
caused by temperature differences in different parts of the building (warmer air is lighter than cold air). 
Such systems are usually suitable for mild or moderate climates with minimum ambient air pollution. In 
contrast, mechanical ventilation systems provide controlled ventilation to the building, usually coupled 
with heating, cooling and air pollution control. Such systems are called HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air 
Conditioning). If possible, natural ventilation should be preferred over mechanical ventilation.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Air Pollution

Air Pollutants
Air pollution is the introduction of a substance (i.e., pollutant) in the air harmful to human and the 
environment, which may be natural (e.g., volcano eruption) or man-made. Pollutants can be solid, 
liquid or gaseous. The human health impact caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, 
wheezing, coughing and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions, which are reflected 
in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and 
premature death. In the United Kingdom the Great Smog of 1952 formed over London killed 4000 people 
in six days and 8,000 more died within the following months.
Major pollutants include
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): this is a reddish-brown toxic gas with a characteristic sharp, biting odour. It 
is produced from fuel combustion that converts oxygen and nitrogen (78% of the air) to NO and then 
quickly to NO2. Their combined presence is described as NOx. They may cause breathing problems in 
sensitive people and react with water vapour to form nitric acid and fall as acid rain. NO2 is also produced 
naturally during thunderstorms by electrical discharge. The WHO air quality standard for NO2 is 200mg/
m3
 (1 hour average) and 40mg/m3
 (annual average). The two thresholds represent both short term and 
long term effects of the pollutant on human health.
Sulphur dioxide (SO2): since coal and petroleum often contain sulphur, their combustion generates 
sulphur dioxide. Many raw materials such as aluminium, copper and iron ores contain sulphur, and their 
extractions produce SO2. Naturally, SO2 is also produced by volcanoes. Like NO2, SO2 can be converted 
to sulphuric acid and fall as acid rain. SO2 can accelerate the decay of building materials and cause 
respiratory disease and death. The WHO air quality standard for SO2 is 20mg/m3
 (24 hour average) and 
500mg/m3
 (10 minute average).
Particulate matter (PM): It refers to fine particles (solid or liquid) with diameter of 10 micrometres 
or less, which can be either man made or natural. Natural particulates include those from volcanoes, 
dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Man-made particulates are 
produced by the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants, construction and various industrial 
processes. They are not a uniform combination of compounds (acids, organic chemicals, metals, soils, 
etc). All particles with 10 mm or less in diameter are denoted as PM10 and those with 2.5mm or less in 
diameter are denoted as PM2.5. Large particles are problematic for the respiratory system because they 
are trapped in the upper respiratory system, producing clogged nose and scratchy throat. Fine particles 
make their way deeper into the lung to cause breathing problems and are absorbed into the bloodstream 
to affect many organs. The WHO air quality standard for PM10 is 50mg/m3 (24 hr average) and 20 mg/
m3 (annual average), and for PM2.5 is 25mg/m3 (24 hr average) and 10 mg/m3 (annual average). It is not 
clear about the health risk posed by particles with diameters less than 0.1mm and no standard is set for 
PM1 at the moment.

Air Pollution
Ground level ozone (O3): it is produced by complex chemical reactions driven by sunlight. Reactive 
hydrocarbons (benzene, propane, components of gasoline) and nitrogen oxides (notably NO and NO2) 
react under sunlight. The concentration of ozone builds up during the day with its peak in early afternoon 
(along with the air temperature). In the night, the ozone concentration drops when photochemical actions 
stops and ozone removing processes dominate. Ozone is a powerful oxidising agent readily reacting with 
other chemical compounds to make many possibly toxic oxides. Ozone is detrimental to ecosystems by 
damaging sensitive plants (and some crops) and reducing biodiversity. It is a strong respiratory irritant 
causing lung inflammation, breathing difficulties, aggravated asthma and permanent lung damage from 
repeated exposures. The WHO air quality standard for O3 is 100mg/m3
 (8 hr average).
Carbon monoxide (CO): it is produced from incomplete combustion of fuels and vehicular exhaust is 
a major source of carbon monoxide. CO is colourless, odourless, non-irritating but very poisonous. It 
can be easily absorbed into blood and may impair victim’s ability to function and lead to cardiovascular 
problems. At high levels, asphyxiation can occur in indoor environment due to poor heating system 
and inadequate ventilation. The WHO air quality standard for CO is 30mg/m3(1 hr average) and 10mg/
m3(8 hr average).
Others: there are also many other pollutants in the air such as odours, radioactive pollutants, volatile 
organic compounds, carbon dioxide (CO2), Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ammonia (NH3), peroxyacetyl 
nitrate (PAN), persistent organic pollutants (POPs), toxic metals (lead, cadmium, copper), etc.
All major pollutants are routinely measured by the relevant government agencies. Figure 9.4 shows the 
real-time air quality monitoring sites in the UK and the general public can access the measured air quality 
data by clicking the interested sites on the screen. An overview of the current state of air pollution health 
bandings is displayed for a quick scan.

Emission Estimation and Control
Emission is the amount of pollutant a source releases into the air. Emission rate is expressed as mass 
per time, such as g/s, kg/day or tonnes/year. Emission rate and pollution composition can change with 
time. Air pollutants are sources from four main types: 1) point source (a single, identifiable source of 
air pollutant emissions such as a single furnace); 2) line source (one-dimensional source of air pollutant 
emissions such as a line of vehicles on a road); 3) area source (a two-dimensional source of diffuse air 
pollutant emissions such as forest fire and land fill); and 4) volume source (a three-dimensional source 
of diffuse air pollutant emissions usually found in oil refineries). They may also be divided as stationary 
and mobile (e.g., cars).
There are five methods to quantify air pollutant emissions: 1) direct measurement (either stationary 
sensors or mobile sensors); 2) mass balance (an indirect way by the conservation of mass from the 
difference between the measured inflow and outflow in a system); 3) process modelling (by mathematical 
modelling of physical and chemical processes); 4) emission factor modelling (emission factor is the 
ratio of emission and pollutant source intensity and can be found in the published manual. The source 
intensity such as kg/day times its relevant emission factor to derive the estimated emission rate); 5) expert 
judgement (subjective estimation by experience and knowledge). The reliability and cost are ranked from 
high to low with the method 1 to 5 (i.e., Method 1 is the most reliable and most costly and Method 5 is 
the least costly and least reliable).
There five options to control air pollution: 1) prevention (green chemistry, green engineering); 2) 
regulatory solutions (permit for allowable emissions, monitoring); 3) market solutions (a total allowable 
emission cap is set and emission allowances can be traded in the market); 4) voluntary solutions (voluntary 
emission reduction by individuals, communities and firms encouraged by easy access of air quality 
information); and 5) emission control technologies (thermal oxidiser to oxidise pollutants using high 
temperature in a similar way to incinerators, absorption by passing polluted air through water soaked 
media in a similar way to a smoking waterpipe, biofilter filled with a biological medium for the polluted 
air to be passed through to interact with the attached microorganisms, and particulate emission control 
technologies such as cyclone, scrubber, baghouse and electrostatic precipitator).
For easy public understanding, air quality may be indicated by Air Quality Index (AQI) or Air Pollution 
Index (API). In the USA, AQI is based on O3, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO (EPA, www.airnow.gov). 
AQI is classified into 6 bands: Good (0), Moderate (100), Unhealthy for sensitive groups (150), Unhealthy 
(200), Very Unhealthy (300), Hazardous (500). In the UK, air pollution is described on a scale of 1-10 
where 1 corresponds to ‘Low’ pollution and 10 corresponds to ‘Very High’ pollution (http://uk-air.
defra.gov.uk/air-pollution/ ). The overall air pollution index for a site or region is determined by the 
highest concentration of five pollutants: O3, PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2. Table 9.2 illustrates the air quality 
information for the public.

Air Quality Modelling and Forecasting
Air quality is modelled by air dispersion models (also called atmospheric diffusion model, air quality 
model, or air pollution dispersion model). A set of mathematical equations describing physical and 
chemical processes of air and its pollutants is solved by numerical methods on modern computers. The 
dispersion model is used to estimate or predict the downwind concentration of air pollutants emitted 
from various sources. Air dispersion models can be used by government agencies to determine whether 
an existing or new industrial plant will be in compliance with the relevant air quality standards. They are 
also used by public safety organisations for air quality forecasting (or scenario setting), which is important 
especially for emergency planning and operation of accidental chemical releases (e.g., evacuation or 
sheltering for persons in the downwind direction).
A typical air dispersion model requires information on 1) meteorological conditions: wind speed and 
direction, atmospheric turbulence, ambient air temperature, the height to the bottom of any inversion 
aloft that may be present, cloud cover and solar radiation; 2) pollutant source: the concentration or 
quantity of pollutants in emission or accidental release, temperature of the material, source location 
and height, type of source; 3) terrain: elevations at the source location and at the receptor location(s), 
land use/land cover information.

Dispersion models vary depending on the mathematics used to develop the model and a long list of those 
models can be found at Wikipedia ‘list_of_atmospheric_dispersion_models’. In the UK and Europe, air 
quality forecast is carried out by coupling a numerical weather model and an air quality model (Defra, 
2012). The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a next-generation mesoscale numerical 
weather prediction system designed to serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research 
needs (WRF, 2012). WRF is suitable for a broad spectrum of applications across scales ranging from 
meters to thousands of kilometres. For air quality forecasting across the UK and EUROPE WRF is 
initiated using NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) real-time data updated every 3 hrs. It is then 
run to provide 48-hour forecasts at 50km resolution for Europe and 10km resolution across the UK. 
The WRF model outputs are used as inputs to the CMAQ air quality forecasting model, and presented 
as a series of animated maps which the forecasting team use to review the expected weather situation. 
The Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) modelling system has been designed to approach air 
quality as a whole by including state-of-the-science capabilities for modelling multiple air quality issues, 
including tropospheric ozone, fine particles, air toxics, acid deposition, and visibility degradation. An 
example of air quality forecast map is shown in Figure 9.5.
WRF also has its own air quality model called WRF-CHEM (WRF-CHEM, 2012), which is the WRF 
model coupled with Chemistry. The model simulates the emission, transport, mixing, and chemical 
transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with the meteorology. The model is used for 
investigation of regional-scale air quality, field program analysis, and cloud-scale interactions between 
clouds and chemistry.

Noise Pollution
10	 Noise Pollution
Noise is defined as unwanted sound in environmental engineering. This is in contrast to noise definitions 
in other fields where noise usually means unwanted information or data that is not relevant to the 
hypothesis or theory being investigated. For example, in telecommunication, noise is the unwanted 
random addition to a signal. In relation to sound, noise is not necessarily random (e.g., loud music from 
neighbours). Noise’s effects include moderate annoyance to permanent hearing loss and may be rated 
differently by different observers. Nowadays, noise is pervasive and is almost impossible to escape from 
it. It is important for environmental engineers to understand noise so that its effect could be mitigated 
at design and operation of various buildings and machines.
10.1	
Sources of Noise
Noise can be from a point source (e.g., a loudspeaker), a line source (e.g., power line under strong 
wind) or an area source (e.g., wind noise from a forest). They include sources from road traffic, aircraft, 
industrial plant, construction activities, sport and crowd activities, loud music from neighbours, etc. Poor 
urban planning may give rise to noise pollution, since side-by-side industrial and residential buildings 
can result in noise pollution in the residential area. Inadequate sound proof of buildings also contributes 
to noise problems.
In time, noise sounds can be classified as 1) continuous: an uninterrupted sound during the period of 
observation; 2) intermittent: a continuous sound with interruptive gaps, such as dentist drill; 3) impulsive: 
a sound of short duration, usually less than a second, such as gunfire. 
In contrast to water and air pollutions, noise pollution has some unique characteristics: 1) the unwanted 
sound can be subjective so it may mean the wrong sound in the wrong place at the wrong time. Therefore, 
any sound could be noise; 2) noise pollution is usually local. Sound intensity follows an inverse square 
law with distance from the source; doubling the distance from a noise source reduces its intensity by a 
factor of four; and 3) there is no residual pollution after the noise source is removed.
10.2	
Physical Properties of Noise
The ‘noise’ sound is a wave described by: wavelength (l), frequency (f) and speed (c) which are related by

 The speed of sound in air at sea level at 20oC is about 340m/s. It travels faster in water (about 1500m/s) 
and solids (e.g., 5000m/s in iron). The human hearing frequency range is from 20 to 20,000 Hz.

Sound is a compression wave and it causes pressure changes in the air. Sound pressure (also called 
acoustic pressure) is the local pressure deviation from the ambient atmospheric pressure caused by a 
sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a microphone in air and hydrophone in water. The 
SI unit for sound pressure is Pascal (Pa). The effective sound pressure is the root mean square of the 
instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time as expressed in Eq (10.2)

There is a huge range of audible sound pressures and in practice, it is more useful to convert sound 
pressure values (in Pa) to sound pressure level (SPL) which is a logarithmic measure of the effective 
sound pressure relative to a reference value. Since the sound power is proportional to the square of the 
sound pressure, the sound pressure level in decibels is defined as

which is usually considered the threshold of 
human hearing (at 1 kHz). The decibel (dB) is used in a wide range of measurements in science and 
engineering. A change of the value ratio by a factor of 10 is a 10dB change and a change by a factor of 
2 is approximately a 3dB change. The name decibel is linked with the Bell Telephone Lab who initiated 
this unit.

Human Perception of Noise
Human ears respond differently to different frequencies. Human voice contains frequency between 80 to 
8000 Hz, but is mainly in 500 to 2000 Hz. In practice, sounds with a frequency above 8000 Hz are usually 
ignored in environmental noise monitoring because they are rarely encountered. For noise analysis, 
the whole audible frequency range is divided into a set of frequencies called bands. Each band covers a 
specific range of frequencies. An octave band is the frequency interval between a given frequency and 
twice that frequency: 1) 0.022-0.044 kHz; 2) 0.044-0.088 kHz; 3) 0.088-0.176 kHz; 4) 0.176-0.353 kHz; 
5) 0.353-0.707 kHz; 6) 0.707-1.414 kHz; 7) 1.141-2.825 kHz; 8) 2.825-5.650 kHz; 9) 5.650-11.300 kHz; 
10) 11.300-22.500 kHz.
Within the audible frequency range, the human ear is most sensitive between 2 and 5 kHz, largely due 
to the resonance of the ear system. An equal-loudness contour is a measure of sound pressure level, 
over the frequency spectrum, for which a listener perceives a constant loudness when presented with 
pure steady tones. The unit of measurement for loudness levels is phon, and is arrived at by reference 
to equal-loudness contours (Figure 10.1). By definition, two sine waves of differing frequencies are said 
to have the equal-loudness level measured in phons if they are perceived as equally loud by the average 
young person without significant hearing impairment. The value of phon is indicated by the sound 
pressure levels at 1000 Hz. From this figure, it can be seen that 92 dB at 100 Hz, 80 dB at 1000 Hz and 
77 dB at 2000 Hz are perceived of the same loudness (i.e., 80 phons) by human ears. The measurement 
for those curves is subjective and different researchers may produce different curves. The blue line in 
Figure 10.1 is an updated curve set in 2003’s international standard ISO 226:2003.

Noise Measurement
Noise is measured by sound level meters. Microphone is one of the key components in a sound level 
meter system. During measurements, it should be protected from mechanical damage, moisture and 
turbulence noise from wind. A special windshield and rain cover fitted to the microphone should be 
used if possible. Sound level meters should be calibrated by a pistonphone or a sound level calibrator 
both before and after its use. When measuring the noise level of a specific point source, the distance 
should always be stated. A distance of one metre from the source is commonly used. If the distance of 
the microphone to a sound source is omitted when measurements are quoted, it would make the data 
useless. In the case of ambient environmental measurements of “background” noise, distance needs not 
be quoted as no single source is present.

 Figure 10.2 Weighting curves (Wikipedia ‘A-weighting’)
From the equal-loudness contours as shown in Figure 10.1, it is clear that two sounds with the same 
sound pressure level will be heard as different loudness levels at different frequencies. Therefore, sounds 
at different frequencies should be rated differently. To compensate for the frequency dependent sensitivity 
of human ears, sound level meters use a weight curve to combine sounds at different frequencies (Figure 
10.2).

The curves are originally defined for use at different average sound levels. In order to distinguish the 
different sound measures, a suffix is used: A-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dBA or 
LA and B-weighted sound pressure level is written either as dBB or LB, etc. The A-weighting, though 
originally intended only for the measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phons), is now commonly 
used for the measurement of environmental noise and industrial noise. The weighting is employed by 
arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound 
pressure levels in dB. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) 
to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound.

Health Effects
Noise can damage human’s physiological and psychological health, causing annoyance and aggression, 
hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects. 
Chronic exposure to noise may cause noise-induced hearing loss. 
In animals, noise can have a detrimental effect on their behaviours, increasing the risk of death by 
changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering the use of 
the sounds in communication especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. Noise pollution 
has caused the death of certain species of whales that beached themselves after being exposed to the 
loud sound of military sonar.
10.6	
Noise Control
There are three elements to consider in noise control: Source -> Transmission path -> Receiver. 1) Source: 
the noise generation could be stopped or limited to certain times of the day; 2) Transmission path: this 
could be modified by putting the source inside a sound proof enclosure, constructing a noise barrier or 
using sound absorbing materials along the path; 3) Receiver: wearing ear protection or altering work 
schedule. 
Generally, to reduce noise pollution, a set of strategies are needed to include transportation noise control, 
architectural design, and occupational noise control. For noise from roadways, highway noise is little 
affected by automobile type, since those effects are aerodynamic and tyre noise related. The most effective 
areas for roadway noise mitigation include urban planning, roadway design, noise barrier, speed control, 
surface pavement and truck restrictions. Speed control is effective since the lowest sound emissions arise 
from vehicles moving smoothly at 30 to 60 kilometres per hour. Above that range, sound emissions 
double with each five miles per hour of speed. At the lowest speeds, braking and (engine) acceleration 
noise dominates. Selection of surface pavement can make a difference of a factor of two in sound levels. 
Quieter pavements are porous with a negative surface texture and use medium to small aggregates. Noise 
barriers can be applicable for existing or planned surface transportation projects. They are probably the 
single most effective weapon in retrofitting an existing roadway, and commonly can reduce adjacent 
land use sound levels by up to ten decibels (Figure 10.3).

Because of its velocity and volume, the noise from jet turbine engine exhausts defies reduction by any 
simple means. The most promising forms of aircraft noise abatement are through land planning, flight 
operations restrictions and residential soundproofing. Flight restrictions can take the form of preferred 
runway use, departure flight path and slope, and time-of-day restrictions.

Noise Pollution
To design quieter buildings, many countries have stringent building codes with requirements of acoustical 
analysis, in order to protect building occupants. With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require 
measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard 
required for exterior building skin design. The most important elements in designing a building skin are 
usually: glazing (glass thickness, double pane design etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney 
baffles, exterior door design, etc. Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal 
types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies, 
which emanates from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within 
the building systems. Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or animal noise. 
Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems. Since many of 
these sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to 
meet certain performance standards, which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching 
occupants. The second type of interior sound arises from transmission of sound through the building 
itself, such as from footfall of occupants in living spaces above. This type of noise is more difficult to 
abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling 
on resilient channel.
Industrial noise is usually considered mainly for environmental health and safety, rather than nuisance, 
as sustained exposure can cause permanent hearing damage. This situation usually involves primarily 
manufacturing settings where industrial machinery produces intense sound levels. While this circumstance 
is the most dramatic, there are many other office type environments where sound levels may lie in the 
range of 70 to 75 decibels, entirely composed of office equipment, music, public address systems, and 
even exterior noise intrusion. The latter environments can also produce noise health effects if exposures 
are long term. In the case of industrial equipment, the most common techniques for noise protection of 
workers consist of shock mounting source equipment, creation of acrylic glass or other solid barriers, 
and provision of ear protection equipment. In certain cases the machinery itself can be re-designed to 
operate in a manner less prone to produce grating, grinding, frictional or other motions that induce 
sound emissions.

11	 Climate Change - Impact, 
Mitigation and Adaptation
Climate is the statistics of long term (the standard period is 30 years) meteorological variables (e.g., 
temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and others). The statistics include average, variance, 
skewness, and others. The climate of a location is affected by its land use/land cover, latitude, terrain, 
altitude, etc. Climate change has great implications for future environmental risk assessment and 
sustainability. It is important for environmental engineers to understand how climate could be altered 
by human actions either intentionally or inadvertently, and what mitigation and adaptation approaches 
should be adopted.
11.1	
Climate Observation
Details of the modern climate records are known through the taking of measurements from weather 
instruments such as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers during the past few centuries. Figure 
11.1 shows the instrumental global surface temperature record since the late 19th century due to the 
widespread reliable measurements. Satellites may also be used to retrieve surface temperatures in cloud-
free conditions, generally via measurement of thermal infrared images. Weather satellites have been 
available to infer sea surface temperature (SST) information since 1967, with the first global composites 
made during 1970.
Figure 11.1 Instrumental temperature record (Wikipedia ‘Instrumental temperature record’)
Paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the Earth’s history. It uses evidence 
from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past climate. The reconstructed 
past climate demonstrates the variations of climate in different periods of the Earth history (Figure 11.2).

Climate Change Mechanisms
At the planetary scale, the global climate is regulated by how much energy the Earth receives from the 
Sun. However, the global climate is also affected by other flows of energy which take place within the 
climate system itself. This global climate system is made up of the atmosphere, the oceans, the ice sheets 
(cryosphere), living organisms (biosphere) and the soils, sediments and rocks (geosphere), which all 
affect, to a greater or less extent, the movement of heat around the Earth’s surface.
Research has shown that human activity can have significant impacts on weather and climate over a 
broad range of space and timescales. The question is whether the human disturbance of the regional 
and global climate can be extracted from the large natural variability that occurs on these scales. The 
main and imminent effect of human on the global climate system, as it impacts society, is not from a 
globally averaged increase in surface temperature. The more important effect is if humans have altered 
atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns, such as the position of the polar jet stream, and how the 
troughs and ridges of pressure are established, and if ocean conveyor belts are modified. Pielke et al. 
(2002) and Feddema et al. (2005) illustrated how land-use change could accomplish large circulation 
change, but without a change in the globally averaged surface temperature.
11.2.1	 Climate Forcing
A climate forcing is defined as ‘an energy imbalance imposed on the climate system either externally 
or by human activities’ (National Research Council, 2005). The principal source of energy driving the 
atmospheric/ocean system comes from the Sun. The Sun emits most of its radiant energy over wavelengths 
ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 mm, with a peak intensity at 0.47mm. On the other hand, the spectrum of energy 
emitted by the Earth is most around 6 – 25 mm. The energy emitted by the Sun is shortwave radiation 
and the energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere is longwave radiation. There is very little overlap 
between them in spectrum.

The solar energy is significantly attenuated by the time it reaches the Earth’s surface at sea level. It is not 
attenuated uniformly across the spectrum, but instead major energy losses occur over rather narrow 
bands, called absorption bands. In a cloud-free clean atmosphere, the primary absorbers of shortwave 
radiation are water vapour and ozone. Airborne particles, or aerosols, in typical non-polluted air 
contribute less to absorption. Absorption of longwave radiation occurs in a series of bands. The principal 
natural absorbers of longwave radiation are water vapour and carbon dioxide (and some minor players 
such as ozone, methane, CFC and nitrous oxide which are much less influential). They are the principal 
‘greenhouse’ gases. The basic greenhouse concept was proposed by Fourier (1827). Later, Arrhenius 
(1896) calculated the effects of varying carbon dioxide concentrations on surface temperature and even 
included the impact of water vapour absorption in his calculations (Cotton and Pielke, 2007, pp155). 
The most important greenhouse gas is water vapour which varies naturally in space and time due to the 
Earth’s hydrological cycle. The 2nd most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. In contrast to water 
vapour, carbon dioxide is rather uniformly distributed throughout the troposphere.
The radiative properties of aerosol particles are a complicated function of their chemistry, shape, and 
size spectra. Moreover, if the aerosol particles are hygroscopic, their radiative properties change with 
the relative humidity of the air. Dry aerosol particle in high concentrations such as over major polluted 
urban areas and over deserts can cause substantial absorption and scattering of solar radiation.

Like aerosol particles, cloud droplets, rain drops, and ice particles interact with radiation in complex 
ways. Numerous small, liquid cloud droplets are strong reflectors of solar radiation, while raindrops, 
though much fewer in number, are strong absorbers of solar radiation, but are small contributors to 
scattering. Likewise, numerous small ice crystals can be strong reflectors of solar radiation while being 
weak absorbers. Except for very deep, wet clouds, absorption of solar radiation by cloud droplets and 
ice crystals is small. By contrast, absorption of longwave radiation by clouds is quite large, while they 
reflect longwave radiating rather poorly.
The climate of the Earth will remain constant as long as the apportionment of energy contributions to the 
global budget remains the same. A systematic change in one or more components can lead to a radiative 
imbalance in the global budget and lead to warming or cooling of globally averaged heat content. If all 
existing greenhouse gases were removed from the atmosphere, the amount of longwave energy emitted 
to space would be greatly enhanced. This would result in an average surface temperature of the Earth 
about 30oC cooler than it is today (Pielke, 2003). 
The total energy output from the Sun cannot be viewed as being a constant. There is evidence suggesting 
that early in the Earth’s history, the Sun’s output was 25% less than it is today. In recent history, solar 
luminosity has been observed to decline from 1980 to 1986 and to increase since 1986. Solar luminosity 
is positively correlated to sunspot number with 11-year cycle with an amplitude change of 0.1Wm-2 at the 
top of the atmosphere. The geometry of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun also changes with time. There is 
a 41,000-year oscillation in the Earth’s tilt and a 22,000-year precession cycle. The Milankovitch theory 
predicts that the Earth will gradually be moving into an ice age over the next 5000 years. It remains to 
be seen if the impact of anthropogenic activities on climate can alter the effect of the orbital forcing on 
climate trends. 
Volcanoes are the major source of natural aerosol particles which can significantly attenuate solar 
radiation. A major volcanic eruption such as Tambora in 1815 and Pinatubo in 1991 can spew large 
quantities of aerosols and gases into the lower stratosphere where they can reside for months to several 
years. The high-level aerosol particles reflect some of the incoming radiation, thus increasing planetary 
albedo, and absorb solar radiation in the stratosphere, thus reducing the amount of energy reaching the 
Earth’s surface. Therefore, a single large volcanic eruption can reduce surface temperatures by several 
tenths of a degree for several years (Hansen et al., 1988). Because large volcanic eruptions cannot be 
predicted, they represent a major source of uncertainty in predicting climate trends. A collision between 
the Earth and a large meteor or comet is another potentially major source of dust and aerosol. Since the 
frequency of such events is so low, they are generally thought to be a minor factor in climate change 
over the next several hundred years.

The surface properties have an important role in the Earth’s radiation balance. The albedo of the surface 
of the Earth is determined by the percent coverage of ocean versus land, the amount of glacial coverage, 
and properties of the land surface such as the amount of desert versus forested lands. Dust ejected into 
the atmosphere by wind from deserts also results in a major influence on the radiative balance.
11.2.2	
Climate Feedback
Climate feedback is amplification or dampening of the climate response to a specific forcing due to 
changes in the atmosphere, oceans, land, or continental glaciers. 
Water vapour is a principal greenhouse gas and any changes in water vapour concentration in response 
to greenhouse gases would substantially alter the net greenhouse heating. As the atmosphere and ocean 
warm in response to enhanced greenhouse warming, more water vapour evaporates from the ocean and 
land surfaces. The higher water vapour content of the atmosphere causes further greenhouse warming, 
which then causes more evaporation (positive feedback). 
There are other possible feedbacks associated with higher moisture contents, which complicate this 
feedback process. Clouds can lead to both warming and cooling of the atmosphere through their 
interactions with radiation. Simulation of the moisture feedback in climate models requires realistic 
models of hydrological budget (rainfall, physical evaporation and transpiration of water vapour from 
land and ocean surfaces) and of the response of the ocean to heating of the atmosphere. Unfortunately, 
the responses of the various climate models to simulated surface energy budge are diverse.
Changes in surface snow and ice coverage respond positively to greenhouse warming. Snow and ice reflect 
more solar radiation than open water, bare soil, or soil covered by vegetation. As a result, a warming high 
latitude troposphere is expected to reduce sea ice cover accordingly, and to cause earlier seasonal melting 
of snow and a retreat in glaciers. It is estimated that these effects would positively amplify greenhouse 
warming by 10% to 20% globally (Hansen, 1986). The ice albedo and snow albedo feedbacks are difficult 
to model accurately and the existing climate models failed to predict and match the observed sea ice 
coverage changes in the polar regions.
An even more complicated feedback in surface albedo and surface fluxes is associated with changes 
in vegetation coverage. If the tundra-boreal forest boundary should shift poleward in response to a 
warming planet, this would cause a decrease in albedo and represent a positive feedback. If, on the other 
hand, desert increases in semi-topical areas due to reductions in rainfall, this could create a negative 
effect. Likewise, it is possible that enhanced carbon dioxide concentration will serve as a fertiliser and 
result in increased biomass coverage causing a decrease in albedo and positive feedback. The increase of 
biomass, however, would provide an enhanced atmospheric sink of carbon, at least until new biomass 
decays (Cotton and Pielke, 2007).

Ocean is able to store a large amount of heat. As a result, the time that it takes the atmosphere-ocean 
system to respond to greenhouse warming is largely controlled by the ocean response. If exchanges of 
heat with the deep ocean are small, the upper mixed layer of the ocean, which is commonly about 7 to 
100m deep, will respond to a warming atmosphere on the timescale of decades. If, on the other hand, 
the rate of exchange of heat with deep ocean layers, it may require time scales on the order of a century 
or more for the upper levels of the ocean to respond appreciably to greenhouse warming. Ocean is also 
a large reservoir of carbon dioxide. The ocean contains as much as 50 times the amount of carbon as 
resides in the atmosphere. The simplest feedback is that as the ocean warms, the solubility of the carbon 
dioxide decreases and more carbon dioxide is released from the ocean to the atmosphere creating a 
positive feedback. However, cold, upwelling regions of the ocean (which require high spatial resolution 
models to simulate) may provide a region for carbon sinks from the atmosphere even if the ocean surface 
were to warm overall (Pielke, 1991).
11.3	
Modelling of Climate Change
Despite the difficulty and uncertainty with climate modelling, many research organisations have developed 
climate models to help the assessment of different forcing and feedback components. There is still a long 
way to go before these models could provide accurate forecasts. Climate models use quantitative methods 
to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. They are used for a variety 
of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future climate. The most 
talked-about use of climate models in recent years has been to project temperature changes resulting

from increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. All climate models take account of 
incoming energy from the Sun as short wave electromagnetic radiation, chiefly visible and short-wave 
(near) infrared, as well as outgoing energy as long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic radiation from 
the Earth. Any imbalance results in a change in temperature.
GCMs (global climate models or general circulation models) discretise the equations for fluid motion and 
energy transfer and integrate these over time. However, they are still under development and uncertainties 
remain (Figure 11.3). They may be coupled with the models of other processes, such as the carbon 
cycle, so as to better model feedback effects. Most recent simulations show “plausible” agreement with 
the measured temperature anomalies over the past 150 years when forced by natural forcings alone, but 
better agreement is achieved when observed changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols are also included.

(Wikipedia ‘Climateprediction.net’)
11.4	
Importance of Natural Variability
Ice cores have shown that a switch from an ice age climate to a non-ice age environment can occur over 
only a few decades (La Brecque, 1989). No climate model has been able to predict or even adequately 
explain these rapid transitions. Short term variations of weather and climate are clearly within the natural 
variability of climate to the extent that we can realistically assess it. Moreover, the models are not really 
‘forecast’ models (Pielke, 2002). They are simply research models designed to simulate the responses of 
hypothesised anthropogenic changes to weather and climate, other things being the same. These model 
simulations should more appropriately be referred to as process studies, not predictions. With their many 
limitations in their description of climate forcing and feedbacks, they are not capable of predicting climatic 
change with a high confidence. We simply do not know enough about all the processes of importance to 
climate change to include them in any quantitative forecasting system (National Research Council, 2005). 
Many people are grossly underestimating the complexity of interactions among the Earth’s atmosphere, 
ocean, geosphere, and biosphere, and overstating the accuracy of the climate models to predict the future

climates. These problems are so complex that it may take many decades, or even centuries, before we 
have matured enough as a scientific community to make credible predictions of long term climate trends 
and their corresponding impacts (Cotton and Pielke, 2007). Widmann and Tett (2003) conclude that 
‘even a perfect model with all forcing included will simulate only one of many possible climate scenarios 
consistent with the forcing’. Volcanic eruptions and influences outside of the Earth could be so large to 
render the forecasts unusable. 
11.5	
Impact
The impacts of climate change are reflected in the changes in various aspects of concern to human 
beings and ecosystems. On the physical world, climate change triggers changes in global and regional 
weather. Generally, projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as a high 
level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale. The temperature changes are more 
visible over land and the polar regions than oceans, and more in high latitude regions than low latitude 
ones. Precipitation over the globe is expected to increase, but with substantial shifts in where and how 
precipitation falls, intensity, frequency, and types (with decreasing precipitation in some areas). Also, 
increased extremes of summer dryness and winter wetness are projected for much of the globe, meaning 
a generally greater risk of droughts and floods. There are widespread melting of snow and ice with visible 
decrease in glaciers (reductions in glacier extent and thickness) and ice caps, and rising global average sea 
level. For volcanoes and earthquakes, the retreat of glaciers and ice caps can cause increased volcanism 
and seismicity due to reduced confining pressure exerted on the Earth crust. The oceans serve as a sink 
for carbon dioxide and increased levels of CO2 have led to ocean acidification, albeit this is alleviated 
to a certain degree by the ocean temperature increase with a less ability to absorb excess CO2 (The 
amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans would decline as well due to increased temperature). Oceans 
are expected to have increased temperature stratification and large-scale changes in ocean circulation.
On the social world, the sensitivity of human society to climate change varies. Sectors sensitive to 
climate change include water resources, coastal zones, human settlements, and human health. Industries 
sensitive to climate change include agriculture, fisheries, forestry, energy, construction, insurance, 
financial services, tourism, and recreation. Generally, adverse impacts of climate change are expected 
to fall disproportionately upon developing countries. In agriculture, crop yields are affected due to the 
effects of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere, higher temperatures, altered precipitation and transpiration 
regimes, increased frequency of extreme events, and modified weed, pest, and pathogen pressure, with 
low-latitude areas at most risk (while on the other hand, productivity may increase in high latitudes with 
moderate temperature increase). More studies are needed to consider the effects of changes in extreme 
events, the spread of pests and diseases. The effect of climate change on human health is reflected by 
exposure through changing weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise and more frequent 
extreme events) and indirectly through changes in water, air and food quality and changes in ecosystems, 
agriculture, industry, settlements and the economy. On the other hand, climate change would bring some 
benefits in temperate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some mixed effects such as

changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in Africa. On extreme events, climate change 
is expected to increase the number of people suffering from death, disease and injury from heatwaves, 
floods, storms, fires and droughts. On water resources, impacts of climate change on freshwater systems 
and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature, sea level and precipitation variability. 
Sea level rise will extend areas of salinisation of groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in 
freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas. More than one-sixth of the world’s 
population are supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges. Changes in glaciers and snow cover 
are expected to reduce water availability for these populations.
On the biological world, impacts of climate change include earlier leafing of trees and plants over 
many regions, movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in search of cooler temperatures, 
changes in bird migrations, and shifting of the oceans’ plankton and fish from cold to warm adapted 
communities. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans may decline, with adverse consequences 
for ocean life. Ocean acidification on the marine biosphere may have some beneficial effects for a few 
species, with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of species. The stresses 
caused by climate change, added to other stresses on ecological systems (e.g., land conversion, land 
degradation, harvesting, and pollution), may cause substantial damage to some unique ecosystems, and 
extinction of some critically endangered species. Climate change has been estimated to be a major driver 
of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests, savannas, Mediterranean-climate systems, tropical forests, the 
Arctic tundra, and coral reefs.

Climat e Change  -  Impact,  Mitigatio n a nd Adaptatio
Physical, ecological and social systems may respond in an abrupt, non-linear or irregular way to climate 
change, as opposed to a smooth or regular response. Irregular behaviour in the Earth systems may give 
rise to certain thresholds (tipping points), which, when crossed, may lead to a large change in the system. 
Human-induced climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical, biological, and social 
systems (e.g., extinction of species, lost of unique human cultures due to displacement of communities 
by sea level rise). It is possible that human-induced climate change could trigger large-scale singularities, 
but the probabilities of triggering such events are still poorly understood.

Mitigation
Mitigation on climate change is a human intervention to reduce the potential effects of climate change by 
reducing the sources or enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases. It should be noted that stabilising GHG 
emissions is not sufficient for stabilising GHG concentrations. This is only possible when GHG emissions 
are significantly reduced to the removal rate by natural processes (Figure 11.4). Mitigation examples 
include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to 
renewable energy (solar power, tidal and ocean energy, geothermal power, and wind power) and more 
controversially nuclear power, improving the insulation of buildings, and expanding forests and other 
“sinks” to remove greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, changing individual-lifestyles 
and business practices. The ever-increasing global population and the planned growth of national GDPs 
based on current technologies are counter-productive to most of these proposals.

There are some emerging mitigating measures that could play important roles in the future. Carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing carbon dioxide from 
large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely (in deep geological 
formations, in deep ocean masses, or in the form of mineral carbonates) instead of releasing it into the 
atmosphere. However, capturing and compressing CO2 may increase the fuel needs of a coal-fired CCS 
plant by 25%-40%. A general problem is that long term predictions about submarine or underground 
storage security are very difficult and uncertain, and there is still the risk that CO2 might leak from the 
storage into the atmosphere.
Urban planning also has an effect on energy use by reducing sprawl to decrease Vehicle Miles Travelled 
(VMT), lowering emissions from transportation. Increased use of public transport can also reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer. Emissions from housing are substantial and 
government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference. New buildings can be 
constructed using passive solar building design, low-energy building, or zero-energy building techniques 
using renewable heat sources. Existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation, 
high-efficiency appliances (particularly hot water heaters and furnaces), double- or triple-glazed gas-
filled windows, external window shades, and building orientation and siting. Renewable heat sources 
such as shallow geothermal and passive solar energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted. 
Geoengineering refers to the deliberate large-scale engineering and manipulation of the planetary 
environment in order to counteract the effects of climate change. It mainly includes solar radiation 
management and carbon dioxide removal. Solar radiation management (SRM) projects seek to reduce the 
net incoming short-wave (ultra-violet and visible) solar radiation received, by deflecting sunlight, or by 
increasing the reflectivity (albedo) of the atmosphere. They do not reduce greenhouse gas concentrations 
in the atmosphere, and thus do not address problems such as ocean acidification caused by these gases. 
Solar radiation management projects often have the advantage of speed. On the other hand, carbon dioxide 
removal projects seek to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (e.g., fertilising the world’s oceans 
with iron), and thus tackle the root cause of global warming. They either directly remove greenhouse 
gases, or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly. These 
projects offer a comprehensive solution to the problem of excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but 
they will take many years to work fully. It is generally agreed that engineered countermeasures need to 
be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the 
potential side effects, the ethical issues, and the risks. It is recognised that geoengineering technologies 
do not now offer a viable response to global climate change

Adaptation
Climate change adaptation is to take actions to cope with the effects of climate change. Adaption is 
necessary because climate change and its effects are unlikely to be mitigated within a short period. 
Adaptation will be more difficult for larger magnitudes and higher rates of climate change. Climate 
change adaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to 
bear the brunt of the climate change effects. Adaptive capacity is closely linked to social and economic 
development, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt. 
Adaptation can be defined as adjustments of a system to reduce vulnerability and to increase the 
resilience of system to change. Adaptation occurs at a range of inter-linking scales, and can either 
occur in anticipation of change (anticipatory adaptation), or be a response to those changes (reactive 
adaptation). Most adaptation being implemented at present is responding to current climate trends and 
variability (e.g., increased use of artificial snow-making in the European Alps) and some adaptation 
measures, however, are anticipating future climate change (e.g., to design a bridge high enough with 
the expected water level rises).
Planning represents an important avenue for adaptation by allocating land use for ecosystem protections. 
In cities, it may be appropriate to change to heat tolerant tree varieties and water permeable pavements to 
absorb higher rainfalls. Sustainable drainage systems could help urban areas adapt to increasingly severe 
storms by increasing rainwater storage and increasing the capacity of storm water systems. Gardens may 
use plants which require less water and provide habitats for the most threatened species. For agriculture, 
it is important to develop crop varieties with greater drought tolerance and increase investment in 
irrigation (e.g., modern efficient irrigation systems, small-scale water storage ponds). Weather control 
techniques could be explored (e.g., cloud seeding) to try to produce rain when and where it is needed. 
Glacial lakes in danger of bursting can have their moraines replaced with concrete dams (which may 
also provide hydroelectric power). Migration could also be considered when other mitigation measures 
have proven unsuccessful.
