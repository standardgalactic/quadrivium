Functions
●
Core topic in Python and in any other programming language. Functions are everywhere;
●
Functions are used to organize our code in blocks, that can be later reused;
●
Advantages: better readability for our code, modularity and also time saving when 
designing and running code;  
●
Functions keep our code DRY  - Don’t Repeat Yourself
 
 
def my_function():
    """
    This is my first function. It prints a string.
    """
    print('Hello Python World!')
#calling the function
my_function()
●
Accessing the function’s help (docstring)
 
help(my_function)
 
 
print(function.__doc__)

Functions
●
Functions can take in parameters
def my_function(name):
    """
    This is my first function. It prints a string.
    """
    print('Hello Python World!' + ' My name is ' + name)
#calling the function
my_function('Andrei')
●
Parameters vs. Arguments  
def my_function(a, b)
#function implementation here
-
In this context, a and b are called function’s parameters. They are variables local to the function.
-
When we call the function, x and y are called function’s arguments:
x = 5
y = ‘a_string’
my_function(x, y)
