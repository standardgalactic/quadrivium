e Synthesis Lectures on Digital Circuits and Systems series is comprised of 50- to 100-page books
targeted for audience members with a wide-ranging background. e Lectures include topics that
are of interest to students, professionals, and researchers in the area of design and analysis of digital
circuits and systems. Each Lecture is self-contained and focuses on the background information
required to understand the subject matter and practical case studies that illustrate applications. e
format of a Lecture is structured such that each will be devoted to a speciﬁc topic in digital circuits
and systems rather than a larger overview of several topics such as that found in a comprehensive
handbook. e Lectures cover both well-established areas as well as newly developed or emerging
material in digital circuits and systems design and analysis.

ABSTRACT
is book, Ampliﬁers: Analysis and Design, is the second of four books of a larger work, Funda-
mentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters that describe the fundamentals of ampliﬁer
performance. Beginning with a review of two-port analysis, the ﬁrst chapter introduces the mod-
eling of the response of transistors to AC signals. Basic one-transistor ampliﬁers are extensively
discussed. e next chapter expands the discussion to multiple transistor ampliﬁers. e coverage
of simple ampliﬁers is concluded with a chapter that examines power ampliﬁers. is discussion
deﬁnes the limits of small-signal analysis and explores the realm where these simplifying assump-
tions are no longer valid and distortion becomes present. e ﬁnal chapter concludes the book
with the ﬁrst of two chapters in Fundamental of Electronics on the signiﬁcant topic of feedback
ampliﬁers.
Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course
in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic
years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Ampliﬁers: Analysis and Design, and
two other books, Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications, and Active Filters and Ampliﬁer Fre-
quency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary applications
include the use with Electronic Devices and Circuit Applications in a one-semester electronics course
for engineers or as a reference for practicing engineers.

Preface
e basic principles of the operation of the four basic active elements, as described in Book 1,
provide a good foundation for further study of electronic circuitry. Analog ampliﬁers constitute
a major class of electronic circuitry and are a primary component in many applications. While
it has been shown that electronic devices are basically non-linear, ampliﬁers typically operate
within a region of incremental linearity. at is, a region where small variation in the input pro-
duces linearly ampliﬁed variation in the output. Analysis of such systems uses the principle of
superposition: DC (or bias) conditions are separated from the AC (or variational) components
of the input and output of an ampliﬁer. e term ”small-signal analysis” refers the use of linear
models. ”Large-signal analysis” implies operation near the transition between operational regions
of an active device: such large-signal operation is typically non-linear and leads to distorted am-
pliﬁcation.
is book begins with a review of two-port analysis. is review provides a basis for model-
ing transistors: they are most commonly modeled as two-port networks for small-signal analysis.
At low frequencies the BJT is modeled by an h-parameter two-port and the FET as a modi-
ﬁed hybrid- two-port. Simple ampliﬁers are approached by observing the previously observed
region of operation that appeared between the two logic states of an inverter. All single-transistor
ampliﬁer conﬁgurations are analyzed and performance characteristics compared.
Multiple transistor ampliﬁer circuitry is initially approached through cascading single tran-
sistor ampliﬁers using capacitive coupling. Only after the basic concepts are mastered, are the more
complex circuits studied. Compound transistor conﬁgurations, such as the Darlington circuit, and
direct-coupled ampliﬁer stages are studied. As with single-transistor ampliﬁers, the previously
observed linear region in ECL logic circuits leads to the study of emitter-coupled and source-
coupled ampliﬁers. Common integrated circuit practices such as current source biasing and active
loads are discussed.
Power ampliﬁers provide a good counterexample to the use of small-signal analysis. By
necessity, the output of a power ampliﬁer is not small and consequently may contain distorted
components. Both harmonic and intermodulation distortion analysis techniques are introduced
and compared. Ampliﬁer conversion eﬃciency is discussed for class A, B, and AB power ampli-
ﬁers. ermal considerations are presented using simple heat transfer models and are related to
power ampliﬁer design criteria and limitations.
Feedback principles are introduced initially as a technique to stabilize ampliﬁer gain, re-
duce distortion, and control impedance. e various conﬁgurations are introduced and analyzed

Single Transistor Ampliﬁers
Circuits containing single Bipolar Junction and Field Eﬀect Transistors are capable of providing
ampliﬁcation in six basic conﬁgurations: three conﬁgurations for each type of transistor. In the
common-emitter and common-collector conﬁgurations for BJTs, the input signal is injected at
the base of the transistor: in the common-base conﬁguration it is injected at the emitter. Similarly,
FET conﬁgurations have the input injected in the gate for common-source and common-drain
conﬁgurations, and at the source for the common-gate conﬁguration. ese six single-transistor
conﬁgurations are basic building blocks of ampliﬁer design.
e focus of attention in this chapter is on the signiﬁcant performance characteristics of
each ampliﬁer conﬁguration: the voltage gain, current gain, input resistance and output resistance.
Each conﬁguration has a unique set of performance characteristics that are dependent on the
transistor characteristics as well as the conﬁguration and value of surrounding circuit elements.
is chapter primarily investigates discrete ampliﬁers where biasing is accomplished with voltage
sources and resistances: later chapters will highlight BJT biasing with current sources as developed
in Section 3.6 (Book 1). e performance of transistor ampliﬁers with current source biasing can
be directly derived from the results presented in this chapter. e frequency range of interest is the
socalled midband region: that range of frequencies below where the transistor characteristics begin
to change with increasing frequency and above where any capacitive elements (many circuits have
no capacitors and therefore the midband frequency range begins at DC) have signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the circuit performance
Although ampliﬁers are usually comprised of more than one ampliﬁcation stage, at least
one of these six conﬁgurations is contained as an ampliﬁcation stage in nearly every ampliﬁer.
e properties derived here form a solid foundation for the analysis and design of multistage
ampliﬁers presented in later chapters.

REVIEW OF TWO-PORT NETWORK BASICS
Electronic ampliﬁers are a subset of the system class commonly identiﬁed as two-port networks. In
a two-port electronic network, signals are fed into a pair of terminals, ampliﬁed and/or modiﬁed
by the system, and ﬁnally extracted at another pair of terminals. Each pair of terminals is identiﬁed
as a port: signals are fed into an input port and extracted from an output port. e modeling and
analysis of transistor-based ampliﬁers as well as feedback systems¹ is greatly simpliﬁed through
the use of two-port network principles.
¹e interconnection of two-port networks as used in the analysis of feedback ampliﬁers will be discussed in Chapter 8 (Book 2).

5. SINGLE TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
e items of interest in an electronic two-port network are the relationships between input
port and output port voltages and currents. ere are a few restrictions, upon which two-port
analysis techniques are based, that must be identiﬁed:
• e network must be linear and time invariant.
• External connections may be made only to port terminals: no external connections can be
made to any node internal to the port.
• All current entering one terminal of a port must exit the other terminal of that port.
• Sources and loads must be connected directly across the two terminals of a port.
Given the highly non-linear behavior of transistors, it may seem unusual to attempt to
use two-port network analysis to describe transistor systems. It is possible, under small-signal
conditions, however, to adequately model non-linear systems as incrementally linear. Electronic
circuits previously discussed in this text have shown, along with non-linear operation, regions
of linear operation. It is within these regions of linear operation that two-port analysis proves a
particularly useful technique for the modeling of electronic systems.
As with all electronic systems, it is important to deﬁne sign conventions: Figure 5.1 is a
representation of a two-port network with appropriate voltage and current polarity deﬁnitions.
As is standard in electronic systems, the voltage and current at each port obey the passive sign
convention. Typically, the input port is identiﬁed as port #1 and the output port as port #2.²
ree-terminal devices, such as transistors, can also be modeled using two-port techniques.
One terminal is selected as a common terminal: that terminal is extended to both of the ports and
becomes the reference (negative) terminal to each port.

ere are six basic sets of equivalent descriptive parameters for every two-port network:
1. Impedance parameters (z-parameters)—port voltages in terms of port currents.
²e numbering of ports is not universal in acceptance. It does, however, allow for simple notation in the description of
the parameters relating currents and voltages. In some electronic two-port descriptions of systems, the numbering system
is replaced by a more descriptive identiﬁcation of parameters. One common example of descriptive notation occurs in h-
parameter modeling of Bipolar Junction Transistors as presented in Section 5.2.

2. Admittance parameters (y-parameters)—port currents in terms of port voltages.
3. Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)—input voltage and output current in terms of input cur-
rent and output voltage.
4. Hybrid parameters (g-parameters)—input current and output voltage in terms of input volt-
age and output current.
5. Transmission parameters (ABCD-parameters)—input current and voltage in terms of out-
put current and voltage.
6. Transmission parameters (ABCD-parameters)—output current and voltage in terms of in-
put current and voltage.
e ﬁrst four of these sets are of particular interest in the study of electronic feedback
systems, set numbers three and four (hybrid parameters) are often used in the description of
transistor properties, and the last two sets of parameters are particularly useful in the study of
communication transmission systems. A short description of the ﬁrst four two-port parameter
set descriptions follows.
Impedance parameters (z-parameters)
e independent variables for this set of parameters are
the port currents and the dependent variables are the port voltages: voltage as a function of current
is an impedance. It is most common to write the equations in matrix form:

e parameters fzijg are called the impedance (or z-) parameters of the network. For a linear,
time-invariant network, the z-parameters can be obtained by performing simple tests on the
network:

For a non-linear system that is operating in a region of linearity, a similar deﬁnition holds:

where the constant value of Ik is taken near the midpoint of the region of linearity. If a quiescent
(zero-input) point exists, the constant value of Ik is chosen as its quiescent value.

CIRCUIT REPRESENTATION OF A TWO-PORT NETWORK
It is often important to create a simple equivalent circuit for a two-port network where the network
parameters are known. While there are several techniques for the creation of these equivalent net-
works, the most useful in electronic applications involves évenin and Norton input and output
realizations. In general, network parameters are replaced by simple circuit elements as shown in
Table 5.1. Relationships between currents and voltages at the same port are treated as impedances
or admittances, while relationships at diﬀerent ports are treated as dependent sources.

e matrix equation for the g-parameter representation of a two-port network can be writ-
ten as two separate equations:
I1 D g11V1 C g21I2
and
V2 D g21V1 C g22I2:
e equation for I1 reveals that two currents must be added together to make the input port
current. Referring to Table 5.1, one ﬁnds that the currents emanate from an admittance and a
current-controlled current source: they must be connected as a Norton source. e equation for V2
implies that two voltages must be added together. Table 5.1 shows the elements are an impedance
and a voltage-controlled voltage source: they are connected in évenin fashion. e equivalent
circuit representation is shown in Figure 5.2 (Note: for clarity, g11 is shown as a resistance rather
than a conductance).

BJT LOW-FREQUENCY MODELS
In previous sections it has been shown that the Ebers-Moll model is an eﬀective model in all
regions of Bipolar Junction Transistor operation. It has also been shown that for large-signal
behavior, a simpliﬁed set of models can bring additional insight into the operation of an electronic
circuit. ese models are ﬁrst-order approximations to BJT operation, and exhibit some degree
of error. When a BJT is operating in the forward-active region, it is appropriate to improve the
modeling of its operation with a second-order approximation. As in most series approximations to
behavior, second-order eﬀects are a linearization, about the ﬁrst-order (in this case, the quiescent)
behavior, and are therefore added to the ﬁrst-order behavior.
In the case of BJT operation, small-signal (often called AC) variations are linearized ap-
proximates to the operation of a transistor about its large-signal (often called DC or quiescent)
behavior. Previous discussions of Bipolar Junction Transistors³ have shown that the forward-
active region (and, similarly, the inverse-active region) of BJT operation are approximately linear
³See Section 3.5 (Book 1)—Digital Applications. In particular, discussions of the transfer relationship for the logic inverter
and ECL logic OR gate showed a linear transition region between the two logic levels. ese transition regions occurred when
the BJT was operating in the forward-active region in transition between the cut-oﬀand saturation regions.

in nature. It is therefore quite reasonable to assume that small-signal approximations have great
validity in the modeling of BJT operation. e small-signal approximations are made in the form
of approximate models that take the form of two-port networks. Two-port network characteri-
zations are valid for non-linear systems that have regions of linearity: the BJT operating in either
of its active regions is such a system.
e ﬁrst obvious problem in modeling a BJT as a two-port is that there are only three ter-
minals rather than the four that seem to be necessary. is obstacle is overcome by assigning one
BJT terminal common to both ports. Practice has made two possibilities for this common terminal
standard: either the emitter or the base are chosen to be the common terminal. In Figure 5.3, an
npn BJT is shown as a two-port network with the emitter terminal chosen as common. In Chap-
ter 3 (Book 1), it was shown that the major controlling port of a BJT is the base-emitter junction.
us, the port containing the base-emitter junction is considered the input port and the remain-
ing port (which contains the collector terminal and the common terminal), the output port. Since
the terminal voltages and currents for BJTs have previously been identiﬁed with subscripts that
are descriptive rather than the general numerical form of Section 5.1, the descriptive subscripts
will be continued in the BJT two-port representation.

e modeling process for transistor circuit performance is:
1. Model the BJT with an appropriate DC model.
2. Determine the circuit quiescent (DC) conditions—verify BJT active region.
3. Determine the BJT AC model parameters from the quiescent conditions.
4. Create an AC equivalent circuit.
5. Determine the circuit AC performance by:
(a) replacing the BJT by its AC model, or
(b) using previously derived results for the circuit topology.
6. Add the results of the DC and AC analysis to obtain total circuit performance.

Techniques for the DC modeling of BJTs and the determination of quiescent conditions
have been discussed thoroughly in Chapter 3 (Book 1): discussions of AC modeling follow. e
steps relating to circuit performance are discussed in later sections of this chapter.
e choice of which set of two-port parameters will be most helpful in the modeling of a
BJT is important. One good starting point is the Ebers-Moll model. e Ebers-Moll model for
an npn BJT is shown in Figure 5.4.

In the forward-active region of operation, the base-emitter junction is forward-biased and
the base-collector junction is reverse biased. Approximate models⁴ for forward-biased and reverse-
biased diodes lead to the base-collector junction diode taking on the appearance of a very large
resistance, while the base-emitter junction diode can be linearized about the quiescent point to a
much smaller resistance. e forward current source (described by ˛F ) remains signiﬁcant while
the reverse current source supplies very little current. is small-signal model is shown in Fig-
ure 5.5, with the two junction dynamic resistances deﬁned as:

e presence of that DC voltage source only aﬀects quiescent behavior and not small signal (AC) behavior. For that reason it
is eliminated in these discussions.

of this small-signal model was based on the Ebers-Moll model of an npn BJT, the small-signal
model itself is valid for both npn and pnp BJTs. Reversing the direction of the junctions only
changes quiescent conditions, it does not change the expressions for dynamic resistance.

5. SINGLE TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
e early voltage for a BJT is usually determined experimentally by observing the slope of the IC

and is deﬁned as:

is output resistance is often large compared to the resistances connected to the collector-emitter
port of the BJT and hoe can, in that case, be assumed approximately equal to zero. When the
external resistances are not small compared to the output resistance it is necessary to include hoe
in the model for the BJT.
e h-parameters for a BJT are summarized in Table 5.2. Only one parameter, hfe, is es-
sentially independent of quiescent conditions, while the other three parameters depend to varying
degrees on the bias conditions, speciﬁcally on the quiescent collector current, IC.

COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIERS
A description of the general performance of a common-emitter ampliﬁer can be derived directly
from the voltage transfer relationship of a BJT logic inverter. e BJT logic inverter, discussed in
Section 3.5 (Book 1), has two distinct regions where the voltage output is relatively constant: when
the BJT is in either the saturation or in cut-oﬀregion. Between these two regions lies a linear
region where the variation in the output voltage about the quiescent point is directly proportional
to the variation in the input voltage. is linear-region proportionality constant for the logic
inverter was seen in Example 3.5-1 to be negative and greater than 1 in magnitude: the input
signal variations were ampliﬁed and inverted. e discussions of Section 3.5 (Book 1) were based
on coarse, ﬁrst-order approximations of the operation of a BJT in each of its regions of operation.
is section develops the characteristics of this type of ampliﬁer (and its close relatives) using the
second-order h-parameter approximations developed earlier in this chapter.
Common-emitter ampliﬁers have the same general circuit topology as the logic inverter:
• the input signal enters the BJT at the base,
• the output signal exits the BJT at the collector, and
• the emitter is connected to a constant voltage, often the ground (common) terminal, some-
times with an intervening resistor.
A simple common-emitter ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 5.8. It is necessary that the qui-
escent point of the BJT be set with the circuitry external to the transistor so that it is in the
forward-active region. e values of the resistors, Rc and Rs, and the DC voltage sources, VCC

and VBB, have therefore been chosen so that the BJT is in the forward-active region and the circuit
will operate as an ampliﬁer. e voltage source, vs, is a small-signal AC source.
Once the circuit quiescent (vs D 0) conditions have been calculated and it has been deter-
mined that the BJT is in the forward-active region of operation, the signiﬁcant h-parameters can
be calculated to form the small-signal model of the transistor:

ˇˇˇˇ :
(5.36)
e small-signal (often called AC) circuit performance can now be calculated. Total circuit per-
formance is the sum of quiescent and small-signal performance: the process is basically a su-
perposition of the zero-frequency solution with the low-frequency AC solution.⁹ In each case,
solutions are formed by setting the independent sources at all other frequencies to zero. AC cir-
cuit performance is obtained through analysis of a circuit obtained by setting the original circuit
DC sources to zero, and then replacing the BJT with its h-parameter two-port model. is circuit
reconﬁguration process, applied to Figure 5.8, is shown in Figure 5.9.
e small-signal performance characteristics¹⁰ that are of interest in any ampliﬁer are: the
current gain, the input resistance, the voltage gain, and the output resistance. For the simple common-
emitter ampliﬁer under consideration, these characteristics can be obtained from analysis of the
circuit of Figure 5.9b. Deﬁnitions for these quantities often vary due to diﬀering deﬁnition of the
exact location of the point of measurement. Care must always be taken to ensure that measurement
points are clearly understood before any analysis begins.
⁹At high frequencies the BJT performance characteristics change. See Book 3.
¹⁰It should be remembered that the quantities discussed in this section and following sections are small-signal (or AC) quantities.
e ratios considered here are the ratios of AC quantities not the ratios of total currents and/or voltages.

For this simple transistor ampliﬁer, the current gain is deﬁned as the ratio of load current to input
current, that is:

From the circuit of Figure 5.9b, it can easily be determined that the collector and base currents are
related through the dependent current source by the constant hfe. e current gain is dependent
only on the BJT characteristics and independent of any other circuit element values. Its value is
given by:
AI D  hfe;
(5.38)
where the negative sign implies that the small-signal current input is inverted as well as ampliﬁed.
If the resistor Rc is large then the output resistance of the BJT must be considered in calculating
the current gain. Including hoe in the BJT h-parameter model divides the output current between
the output resistance, ro D 1=hoe and the collector resistance:

Input Resistance
Input resistance is measure of the AC input current as a function of the input voltage. If the AC
input voltage, vb, is taken at the input terminal of the BJT (the base), the input resistance (shown
if Figure 5.9b with the bold arrow and labeled as Ri) is given by:

to be the voltage at the input to the transistor, vb, the voltage gain is deﬁned as:

Again, the small-signal output voltage is an inverted, ampliﬁed replica of the input voltage.
e voltage gain can be very large in magnitude. Equation (5.43) indicates it is limited only by
the BJT parameter hfe and the external resistance Rc. at conclusion is based, however, on the
assumption that Rc is small with respect to ro. If Rc approaches the magnitude of ro, the gain
becomes limited by the output resistance of the ampliﬁer, and Rc must be replaced by Rc==ro in
Equation (5.43).
Often the voltage gain from the source to the load is of interest as well. is overall voltage
gain can be deﬁned as:

e output resistance is deﬁned as the évenin resistance at the output of the ampliﬁer (in this

While the output resistance is certainly large, a more revealing result could be obtained with a
better model of the BJT. A more accurate h-parameter model of a BJT includes hoe (as derived in

COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIERS WITH NON-ZERO EMITTER
RESISTANCE
Several of the characteristics of a common-emitter ampliﬁer can be altered through the addition
of a resistor connected between the emitter and ground.
It has previously been shown in Section 3.7 (Book 1) that the addition of such a resistor
greatly improves bias stability due to BJT variations. e addition of an emitter resistor has the
following eﬀects on common-emitter ampliﬁers:
• increased input resistance,
• increased output resistance,
• decreased voltage gain, and
• unchanged current gain.
Derivation of these eﬀects follows the process described in Section 5.2.
In order to determine the AC performance of this ampliﬁer, the quiescent conditions must
ﬁrst be obtained. If the BJT is operating in the forward-active region, an AC equivalent model
of the circuit can be obtained (Figure 5.12a) and the BJT can be replaced by its h-parameter
model¹¹ (based on the quiescent conditions) in the AC equivalent circuit (Figure 5.12b). Circuit
performance parameters can now be obtained from this equivalent circuit.
¹¹e initial calculations assume that hoe is small and can be ignored. Calculations to determine the eﬀect of non-zero hoe
follow in Subsection 5.3.2.

THE EFFECT OF NON-ZERO hoe ON COMMON-EMITTER
AMPLIFIERS WITH AN EMITTER RESISTOR
As with simple common-emitter ampliﬁers, the eﬀects of non-zero hoe can only be seen when the
collector resistance becomes large: when Rc approaches or exceeds ro in magnitude. With simple
common-emitter ampliﬁers, the most noticeable eﬀect of non-zero hoe is on the output resistance
of the ampliﬁer. Input resistance is unaﬀected, while the current and voltage gain are limited if
the external collector resistance, Rc, is large. Non-zero hoe in the presence of an emitter resistor
eﬀects all the common-emitter ampliﬁer characteristics in a complex fashion.

5.3. COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIERS

Expressions for the input resistance, voltage gain, and current gain are obtained using the
AC equivalent circuits of Figure 5.13. Figure 5.13b is obtained from the more-traditional Fig-
ure 5.13a through a source transformation on the dependent current source and ro. Symbolic
manipulations of Kirchhoﬀ’s Laws are facilitated through this well-known transformation.

e voltage gain can be calculated as follows by continuing with the circuit of Figure 5.13 and

a greater range of load resistance, Rc, than in the simple common-emitter ampliﬁer.

COUPLING AND BYPASS CAPACITORS
Often the demands of properly biasing a BJT into the forward-active region and applying an AC
signal to the input create conﬂicting circuit topology requirements. It is not always possible to put
the AC input in series with a DC biasing voltage as has been previously described. In addition,
the need for high voltage gain and good bias stability creates a design requirement conﬂict in
the magnitude of the emitter resistor, Re. One possible design alternative that can resolve these
conﬂicts involves the use of capacitors to couple the AC signal into the ampliﬁer and/or to bypass
the emitter resistor.
If an AC signal is imposed upon a capacitor, the complex impedance of the capacitor is
given by:
zC D
1
j!C ;
where
C D the capacitance of the capacitor in farads (F)
! D the frequency of the sinusoidal signal in rad/sec.
At DC .! D 0/, the capacitor has inﬁnite impedance: a capacitor blocks DC signals. If
either the frequency or the capacitance is large, the impedance approaches zero or becomes rela-
tively small compared to adjacent circuit resistances. For purposes of demonstration, assume that
a band of frequencies exist for which the impedance of all discrete capacitors in a circuit will be
essentially zero. is band of frequencies is called the midband frequency region¹² of a circuit. If
the AC input signals to a circuit are within the midband frequency region of the circuit, each
discrete capacitor will appear to be the equivalent of a short circuit. Each capacitor will, however,
appear to be the equivalent of an open circuit to the bias (DC) circuitry.¹³
In the presence of coupling and/or bypass capacitors, the modeling of ampliﬁer circuit
performance is slightly altered. In determining quiescent conditions, each capacitor is replaced by
an open circuit in addition to replacing the BJT with an appropriate model. e AC equivalent
circuit is drawn with each capacitors replaced by a short.

ˇF D 150

COMMON-COLLECTOR AMPLIFIERS
Common-collector ampliﬁers have the following general circuit topology:
• the input signal enters the BJT at the base,
• the output signal exits the BJT at the emitter, and
• the collector is connected to a constant voltage, often the ground (common) terminal, some-
times with an intervening resistor.
A simple common-collector ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 5.15. e collector resistor, Rc,
is unnecessary in many applications, it is shown here for generality. e quiescent point of the
BJT must be set with the circuitry external to the transistor so that it is in the forward-active
region. e values of the resistors, Rc and Rb, and the DC voltage sources, VCC and VBB, have
therefore been chosen so that the BJT is in the forward-active region and the circuit will operate
as an ampliﬁer.
Once the circuit quiescent conditions have been calculated and it has been determined that
the BJT is in the forward-active region of operation, the signiﬁcant h-parameters are calculated
to form the small-signal model of the transistor:

Deﬁnitions for these quantities often vary due to diﬀering deﬁnition of the exact location of the
point of measurement. Care must always be taken to ensure that measurement points are clearly
understood before any analysis begins. Many similarities exist between the circuit topologies of a

e basic circuit topology of a common-collector ampliﬁer is essentially the same as a common-
emitter ampliﬁer with an emitter resistor. e only signiﬁcant diﬀerence is the location of the
output. Many of the calculations necessary to obtain ampliﬁer performance characteristics can

e small-signal circuit performance can now be calculated. Total circuit performance is, as usual,
the sum of quiescent and small-signal performance. e process of AC modeling of the circuit and
replacing the BJT with an appropriate AC model, applied to Figure 5.20, is shown in Figure 5.21.
In order to simplify calculations, the base resistors have been combined as a parallel combination:

e small-signal performance can be obtained from analysis of the circuit of Figure 5.21b.
Deﬁnitions for these quantities often vary due to diﬀering deﬁnition of the exact location of the
point of measurement. Care must always be taken to ensure that measurement points are clearly
understood before any analysis begins. A few similarities exist between the circuit topologies of a
common-base ampliﬁer and the other ampliﬁer types previously discussed: those similarities will
be utilized in calculating performance characteristics.

Non-zero hoe is modeled by altering the circuit of Figure 5.21b to include the output resistance,

COMPARISON OF BJT AMPLIFIER TYPES
Single-BJT ampliﬁers have been shown to fall into three general categories: Common-Emitter
(both with and without an emitter resistor), Common-Collector, and Common-Base. e per-
formance characteristics for each type of ampliﬁer are summarized in Table 5.6.

e common-emitter conﬁguration appears the most useful of the three types: it provides
both signiﬁcant current and voltage gain (in each case with an inversion).
e common-emitter ampliﬁer input and output impedances are high. In fact, this con-
ﬁguration is the most versatile of the three types and will often form the major gain portion of
multiple-transistor ampliﬁers.
e common-collector and common-base conﬁgurations amplify either current or volt-
age, but not both. Neither inverts either the voltage or current signal. ese conﬁgurations ﬁnd
greatest utility as impedance-matching (or buﬀer) stages of multi-stage ampliﬁers. Common-
collector ampliﬁer stages are capable of easily driving low-impedance loads. Common-base stages
can impedance-match a very low-impedance source.
Quantitative expressions for the ampliﬁer performance characteristics are found in Ta-
ble 5.7. ese expressions are based on the often realistic assumption concerning the relative
size of the external resistors (connected to the collector and emitter terminals) and the BJT out-
put resistance: hoe.Re C Rc/  1. High resistance loads require the more exact expressions for
ampliﬁer performance that do not depend on that assumption. ese expressions can be found in
previous subsections concerning the eﬀects of non-zero hoe.

FET LOW-FREQUENCY MODELS
e FET saturation region with small-signal input variations about the DC quiescent operating
point (Q-point) is considered approximately linear in nature. erefore, like the BJT, small-signal
approximations, in the form of approximate circuit networks, are commonly used to model FET
operation in the saturation region. e model is used to approximate all FET types.
Figure 5.23a shows a “generic” FET biased in the saturation region by a gate-source volt-
age VGSQ, with a drain-source voltage VDSQ and drain current IDQ. e eﬀect of small changes
of the bias voltages on ID can be found by independently varying VGSQ and VDSQ as shown in
Figure 5.23b and c, respectively.

variation in the output voltage about the quiescent point is directly proportional to the variation
in the input voltage. is section develops the characteristics of the common-source ampliﬁer
using the small-signal parameters developed in Section 5.7.
Common-source ampliﬁers have the following general circuit topology:
• the input signal enters the FET at the gate,
• the output signal exits the FET at the drain, and
• the source terminal is connected to a constant voltage, often the ground (common) terminal,
sometimes with an intervening resistor.
A simple common-source ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 5.27. Although a enhancement
NMOSFET ampliﬁer is shown, the small-signal analysis of the ampliﬁer is valid for all types
of FETs. As in BJT ampliﬁers, the quiescent point of the FET must be set with circuitry external
to the transistor so that it is in the FET saturation region. e values of the resistors, RD and
RG, and the DC voltage sources, VGG and VDD, have therefore been chosen so that the FET is in
the saturation region and the circuit will operate as an ampliﬁer. Since the gate current is zero,
VGG D VG and the gate to source voltage, VGS, must have a value that places the operation of the
FET in the saturation region. e voltage source, vS, is a small-signal AC source with source
resistance RS.
One the quiescent conditions (vs D 0) have been calculated, and it has been determined
that the FET is in the saturation region, the signiﬁcant small-signal conductances can be calcu-
lated by referring to Table 5.8.

e small-signal circuit performance can now be calculated. Total circuit performance is the
sum of the quiescent and small-signal performance. e process of AC modeling of the circuit and
replacing the FET with an appropriate AC model, applied to Figure 5.27, is shown in Figure 5.28.
e small-signal performance can be obtained from analysis of the circuit of Figure 5.28b.
e small-signal characteristics that are of interest are: the input resistance, the voltage gain, and the
output resistance. Deﬁnitions of these quantities may vary due to diﬀering deﬁnition of the exact
location of the point of measurement.

COMMON-SOURCE AMPLIFIERS WITH NON-ZERO SOURCE
RESISTANCE
Several characteristics of the common-source ampliﬁer (Figure 5.30) can be altered through the
addition of a resistor connected between the source and common (ground). e source resistor
has the following eﬀects on common-source ampliﬁers:
• increased output resistance
• decreased voltage gain
Derivation of these eﬀects follows the process described in Section 5.7.
In order to determine the AC performance of this ampliﬁer, the quiescent conditions must
ﬁrst be obtained. If the FET is operating in the saturation region, an AC equivalent model of
the circuit can be obtained (Figure 5.31a) and the FET can be replaced by its small-signal model
(based on the quiescent conditions) in the AC equivalent circuit (Figure 5.31b). Circuit perfor-
mance can then be obtained from this equivalent circuit.
Input Resistance
e input resistance (shown in Figure 5.31b) is the same as the input resistance for a common-
source ampliﬁer without a source resistor,
Ri D 1:
(5.146)
e addition of a source resistor has not changed the input resistance of the ampliﬁer.

COMMON-DRAIN AMPLIFIERS
Common-drain ampliﬁers have the following general circuit topology:
• the input signal enters the FET at the gate,
• the output signal exits the FET at the source, and
• the drain terminal is connected to a constant voltage, often the ground (common) terminal,
sometimes with an intervening resistor.
A simple common-drain ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 5.34. Although Figure 5.34 shows a
common-drain n-JFET ampliﬁer, the small-signal analysis of the ampliﬁer is valid for all types of
FETs. As in BJT ampliﬁers, the quiescent point of the FET must be set with circuitry external to
the transistor insuring linear operation which for the FET is the saturation region. e values of
the resistors, RD and RG, and the DC voltage sources, VGG and VDD, have therefore been chosen
so that the FET is in the saturation region and the circuit will operate as an ampliﬁer. Since the
gate current is zero, VGG D VG and the gate to source voltage, VGS, must have a value that places
the operation of the FET in the saturation region. e voltage source, vS, is a small-signal AC
source with source resistance RS.
Once the quiescent conditions (vs D 0) have been calculated, and it has been determined
that the FET is in the saturation region, the signiﬁcant small-signal conductances can be calcu-
lated by referring to Table 5.8.

COMMON-GATE AMPLIFIERS
Common-gate ampliﬁers have the following general circuit topology:
• the input signal enters the FET at the source,
• the output signal exits the FET at the drain, and
• the gate terminal is connected to a constant voltage, often the ground (common) terminal,
sometimes with an intervening resistor.
A simple common-gate ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 5.38. Although Figure 5.38 shows a
common-gate depletion NMOSFET ampliﬁer, the small-signal analysis of the ampliﬁer is valid
for all types of FETs. As in BJT ampliﬁers, the quiescent point of the FET must be set with
circuitry external to the transistor so that it is in the FET saturation region. e values of the
resistors, RD and RG, and the DC voltage sources, VGG and VDD, have therefore been chosen so
that the FET is in the saturation region and the circuit will operate as an ampliﬁer. Since the
gate current is zero, VGG D VG and the gate to source voltage, VGS, must have a value that places
the operation of the FET in the saturation region. e voltage source, vS, is a small-signal AC
source with source resistance RS. Once the quiescent conditions (vs D 0) have been calculated,
and it has been determined that the FET is in the saturation region, the signiﬁcant small-signal
conductances can be calculated by referring to Table 5.8.

COMPARISON OF FET AMPLIFIER TYPES

e common-source conﬁguration appears the most useful of the three types: it provides
signiﬁcant voltage gain with inversion. e common-source ampliﬁer input and output resistances
are high. In fact, this conﬁguration is the most versatile of the three types and will often form the
major voltage gain stage portion of multiple-transistor ampliﬁers.
e common-drain conﬁguration is, for all practical purposes, a unity gain, non-inverting
buﬀer ampliﬁer for impedance matching between electronic circuit stages. Common-drain am-
pliﬁers are capable of easily driving low resistance loads. Common-gate ampliﬁers can act as an
impedance matching stage from low to high resistance electronic circuit stages.
Quantitative expressions for the ampliﬁer performance are found in Table 5.13.

5.12. BIASING TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM SYMMETRICAL SWING
393
5.12
BIASING TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM SYMMETRICAL
SWING
Ampliﬁcation can be restricted by the size and positioning of the available undistorted output
swing. Ampliﬁers consisting strictly of a transistor and resistors can be biased so that the transistor
quiescent point lies in the middle of the linear output voltage range provided by the power supply.
is location of the Q-point allows symmetrical excursion of signal voltages about a central value:
distortion (ampliﬁer saturation) will occur for equal magnitude excursions in the positive and
negative directions.
Ampliﬁers that have capacitively coupled loads or resistors that are shunted by capacitors in
the output voltage/current relationship do not have the entire range of the power supply for output
voltage swing. Placing the Q-point in the middle of the power supply rails will not provide equal
output voltage swing and will greatly limit the utility of the ampliﬁer. It is therefore important
to be able to easily choose a Q-point that will provide the maximum symmetrical swing for the
ampliﬁer given the various design constraints.
A technique that analytically determines the Q-point for maximum symmetrical swing is
based on transistor output load lines. e output curve for a transistor (either BJT or FET) is
typically given as a current vs. voltage curve. On this curve DC and AC load lines can be drawn
as shown in Figure 5.43.

Figure 5.43: Typical ampliﬁer AC and DC load lines.
e two load lines always intersect at the quiescent point: if there is zero AC, the output
must be on the Q-point of the DC load line. It is also true that the magnitude of the midband AC
load line for all practical ampliﬁer circuits is greater than that of the DC load line. e increased
magnitude AC load line slope decreases the available oscillatory swing along the abscissa to a value
often signiﬁcantly less than the power supply limits. e maximum supply limit {S} is typically

394
5. SINGLE TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
the magnitude of the power supply: the minimum supply limit {C} is determined by the edge of

For maximum symmetrical swing it is necessary to choose a Q-point that allows equal
oscillatory space in both the positive and negative directions. A choice either to the right or
left of this optimum value will decrease the symmetrical output voltage swing capability of the
ampliﬁer. In Figure 5.43, the Q-point is chosen so that:

Without any restrictions on the input resistance of the ampliﬁer, a wide variety of resistor pair

the base bias resistors should be at least ten times the BJT base current. Using that rule, the

397
A SPICE simulation of the maximum symmetrical swing properties of both VCE and vo
for this circuit follows. e rounding of resistor values and the fact that the simulation value of
VCE.sat/ D 0:05 V rather than 0.2 V as used in calculations has introduced a slight deviation in both
the Q-point and the swing. Distortion is the cause of dissimilar shaped limiting of the signal at
the two ends.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e small-signal model of the BJT was developed in this chapter using two-port network analy-
sis and the Ebers-Moll transistor model. ree conﬁgurations of BJT ampliﬁers were described:
common-emitter, common-collector, and common-base. e current gain, input resistance, out-
put resistance, and voltage gain o feach of the conﬁgurations were found.
e FET small-signal model was also developed three conﬁgurations of FET ampliﬁers
were described: common-source, common-drain, and common-gate. e input resistance, voltage
gain, and output resistance were found for each conﬁguration.
e modeling process for transistor circuit performance contains the following steps:
1. Determine the quiescent (DC) conditions. Verify that the BJT is in the forward-active
region or the FET is in the saturation region.
2. Determine the transistor small-signal parameters from the quiescent conditions.
3. Create the AC equivalent circuit.
4. Determine the AC performance by replacing the transistor by its small-signal model.
5. Add the results of the CD and AC analysis to obtain total circuit performance.

5. SINGLE TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
Restrictions on ampliﬁcation were shown to be dependent on transistor quiescent condi-
tions. A technique that analytically determines the Q point for maximum symmetrical swing
based on load lines was introduced.
Summary Design Example
Whenever the physical distance between a signal source and the load are more than a very small
fraction of a wavelength, the wires connecting the source and load appear to act as a transmission
line. e voltage and current waveforms traveling on a transmission have amplitudes related by the
characteristic impedance of the transmission line, Zo. is characteristic impedance is a function
of the geometry of the transmission line and the dielectric material surrounding the line.
e interfaces between the source, transmission line, and the load must be carefully con-
trolled in order to avoid signal reﬂections: signal reﬂections produce an “echo” eﬀect. In order to
ensure that there are no signal reﬂections at the source end or the load end of the transmission
line, the output resistance of the source and the input resistance of the load must be equal to the
characteristic impedance of the transmission line.
Design an ampliﬁer that will accept an input signal from a matched 50  transmission line
system. e ampliﬁer will have a voltage gain of ˙10.
Solution:
In order to have no reﬂections at the load, the input resistance of the ampliﬁer must be
50 . e only ampliﬁer topologies that have small input resistance while maintaining a voltage
gain are the common-base and common-gate conﬁgurations. Of these two, the common-base
conﬁguration is much more common: the common-base conﬁguration is chosen for this design.
Assume typical transistor parameters:
ˇF D 150;
VA D 160:
e basic topology of the common-base receiving circuit is shown below. Note that the source is an
AC source with an output resistance matched to the characteristic impedance of the transmission
line.

Multiple-Transistor Ampliﬁers
Previous discussions of transistor ampliﬁers have shown that single transistor ampliﬁers have a
wide range of possible design characteristics described by the principal performance characteris-
tics: voltage and current gain; input and output resistance. ere are, however, many circumstances
when the desired overall performance characteristics for an ampliﬁer cannot be met by a single
transistor ampliﬁer. at is, the required combination of ampliﬁcation, input resistance, and out-
put resistance may be beyond the capability of a single transistor ampliﬁer. In these circumstances
it is necessary to employ ampliﬁers that use more than a single transistor.
e obvious approach to changing ampliﬁer performance characteristics is to cascade (con-
nect the output of a given stage directly into the input of the following stage) single transistor am-
pliﬁers. In this manner, additional gain or the modiﬁcation of input/output resistance can be easily
accomplished. is simple approach to multiple transistor ampliﬁers is discussed in Section 6.1. A
major drawback to this approach is the relatively high number of electronic components necessary
to accomplish a design. In addition, if the simple stage are coupled with capacitors (a common
practice to decouple the DC bias conditions of each stage), the low frequency performance of the
ampliﬁer can be severely degraded.
Several transistor cascades are commonly packaged as a single unit. Most common among
these cascade types are the Darlington conﬁgurations. ese cascade conﬁgurations have the ad-
vantage of simple external bias circuitry, high performance, and DC coupling of stages. Analysis
of these types is discussed in Section 6.2.
Diﬀerential ampliﬁers are another type of high-performance multiple transistor ampliﬁer.
ey commonly are based on the high gain of emitter-coupled and source-coupled transistor
ampliﬁers. Operational ampliﬁers are a common form of diﬀerential ampliﬁer that typically have
emitter-coupled or source-coupled ampliﬁers as input stages.
In addition, the practice of biasing transistor ampliﬁers with transistor current sources will
be explored in this Chapter. is bias technique is particularly suited to integrated ampliﬁers con-
tained on a single semiconductor chip where transistors are more practical and economic devices
than resistors.
Active (as opposed to resistive) loads will be explored as a means of increasing gain and
modifying output resistance without the use of extremely large resistors and power supplies.

CASCADED
Among the many multistage connections possible in large ampliﬁers, the cascade connection is
the most simple. In a cascade connection, the output voltage and current of an ampliﬁer stage are
passed directly to the input of the next ampliﬁer stage. A two-stage cascade-connected ampliﬁer
is represented by Figure 6.1. In this ampliﬁer, the outputs, vo1 and io1, of the ﬁrst ampliﬁer stage
become the inputs, vi2 and ii2, to the second stage without any modiﬁcation. For the discussions
in this section, it is assumed that each of the ampliﬁer stages consists of one of the simple single-
transistor ampliﬁers described in Chapter 5.¹

e total voltage gain of a cascade-connected ampliﬁer can be expressed as a product of the gains
of the individual stages and simple voltage divisions. e beauty of cascade-connected ampliﬁers
comes in the second of the multiplicative terms of Equation (6.2): it is an expression of identity,
and consequently can be eliminated from consideration. e expressions for the gains of the
individual stages were developed in Chapter 5 and may be used directly in calculating the overall
¹More complicated individual stages may be cascade-connected. e restriction of individual stages to simple single-transistor

gain. It is, however, important to note that each stage presents a load to the previous stage: its input
resistance is part of the total load that is apparent to a previous stage. In a similar fashion the
current gain of a cascade-connected ampliﬁer is the product of the current gains of the individual
stages and simple current divisions. Again the individual stages interact, and the expressions for
current gain must include the eﬀects of that interaction. Total input resistance, Ri, or total output
resistance, Ro, may also be modiﬁed by the interaction of individual stages.

2 Determine the circuit quiescent (DC) conditions - verify active region for BJTs or saturation

3 Determine the transistor AC model parameters from the quiescent conditions.
4 Create an AC equivalent circuit.
5 Determine the AC performance of each ampliﬁer stage by:
(a) replacing the transistors by their respective AC models, or
(b) using previously derived results for the circuit topology.
5a Combine the stage performance quantities to obtain total ampliﬁer performance.

All required ampliﬁer performance characteristics have been calculated: the problem statement
in this example does not require that AC and DC performance be added.
While the capacitive coupling of ampliﬁer stages has its primary advantage in the decou-
pling of the individual stage quiescent conditions, there are disadvantages that must be considered.
e addition of capacitors may seriously degrade the low-frequency response of an ampliﬁer. In
addition, the decoupling of quiescent conditions necessitates the individual biasing of each tran-
sistor into the forward-active (for BJTs) or saturation (for FETs) regions. Individual biasing can
signiﬁcantly increase the numbers of bias elements (in discrete ampliﬁers these elements are usu-
ally resistors) which will increase the size, cost, and power consumption of an ampliﬁer. It is
therefore advantageous, whenever possible, to directly couple ampliﬁer stages. Capacitive cou-
pling of the input source and the load is often unavoidable due to the DC oﬀsets often necessary
in these simple ampliﬁer stages.
An example of a two-stage cascade-connected ampliﬁer with directly-coupled stages is
shown in Figure 6.2. e bias for the second transistor stage (the BJT for this ampliﬁer) is depen-
dent on the quiescent conditions of the ﬁrst transistor stage. e choice to use dependent biasing

6.1. MULTISTAGE AMPS USING SIMPLE STAGES CASCADED
429
rather than capacitively couple independent stages has eliminated, in this case, two bias resistors
and a capacitor from the design.
Under certain circumstances, is might be possible to eliminate other elements from this
ampliﬁer. e purpose of Rg is to ensure that the quiescent voltage at the gate of Q1 is at zero
potential. If the designer is absolutely sure the input source, vs, has no DC bias, the resistor Rg
and its associated input capacitor could also be eliminated from this design.

DESIGN CHOICES FOR TRANSISTOR CONFIGURATION IN A
CASCADE-CONNECTED AMPLIFIER
e previous example derivations and calculate on of voltage and current gain and input and out-
put resistance apply to any conﬁguration of cascade-connected ampliﬁer. As each stage is added,
the gain expression is increased by only one additional term. e individual stages may be any
of the three BJT or three FET conﬁgurations and any number of these stages may be connected
in any order. ere are, however, design choices that are better engineering practice than other
choices.
e basic reason for choosing a multiple-stage ampliﬁer over a single-stage ampliﬁer are
one or more of the following performance characteristics:
• increased ampliﬁcation
• input impedance modiﬁcation
• output impedance modiﬁcation
Common-emitter and common-source ampliﬁer stages are ideal for increased ampliﬁcation pur-
poses. Each type exhibits signiﬁcant voltage gain and signiﬁcant current gain. In addition, when

6.2. DARLINGTON AND OTHER SIMILAR CONFIGURATIONS
433
cascade-connected, the relatively high input resistance of these stage conﬁgurations does not sig-
niﬁcantly load previous ampliﬁcation stages (voltage gain is a function of the load). Common-base
and common-gate ampliﬁers exhibit good voltage gain but no current gain. e relatively low in-
put resistance of these stages also produces a gain-reducing load to previous stages. Consequently,
these stages are most useful as low input resistance ﬁrst stages. Common-collector and common-
drain ampliﬁers have good current gain but no voltage gain. eir relatively high input resistance
allows them to follow a ampliﬁcation stage without seriously decreasing the voltage gain. ese
two conﬁgurations are most useful for low output resistance ﬁnal stages. In summary, the design
choices for a cascade-connected ampliﬁer are usually are based on the following principles:
• First stage should not be common-collector or common-drain
(a) Low input resistance cases: common-base or common-gate
(b) Other cases: common-emitter or common-source
• Intermediate stages should be common-emitter or common-source
• Final stage should not be common-base or common-gate
(a) Low output resistance cases: common-collector or common-drain
(b) Other cases: common-emitter or common-source
Special purpose ampliﬁers may violate these design principles as seen in Section 6.2.
6.2
DARLINGTON AND OTHER SIMILAR
CONFIGURATIONS
In addition to cascade-connected single-transistor ampliﬁers, there exist several two-transistor
conﬁgurations that are commonly analyzed and often packaged as signal stages. ese particular
combinations are unusual in that they seem to violate to conﬁguration principles of good ampliﬁer
design as itemized in the last section. e conﬁgurations do, however, produce ampliﬁers with
speciﬁc, signiﬁcantly-enhanced properties.
Most common among these conﬁgurations are the two Darlington BJT conﬁgurations and
the Cascode conﬁguration. Mixed BJT and FET combinations are currently not as common
as the single-type conﬁgurations. e BiFET (BiCMOS) Darlington seems most promising of
these newer technology combinations.
6.2.1
THE DARLINGTON CONFIGURATIONS
e Darlington two-transistor ampliﬁer conﬁgurations consist of a pair of BJTs connected so that
the emitter of the input transistor couples directly, in an AC sense, into the base of the output
transistor. A DC biasing current source is also commonly present at this transistor interconnection
node. e output is taken at either the collector or the emitter of the second transistor. us,

434
6. MULTIPLE-TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
in a Darlington connected BJT pair, the ﬁrst transistor stage is a common-collector while the
second stage can be either common-collector or common-emitter. Figure 6.3 shows the two basic
Darlington conﬁgurations.³
e Darlington Conﬁgurations incorporate an additional transistor so that overall circuit
performance is altered signiﬁcantly:
• Current Gain is Increased, and
• Input Resistance is Increased.
ese increases in current gain and input resistance are by a factor of approximately ˇF . e exact
change in circuit performance requires careful analysis.

It is common practice to analyze these two-transistor pairs as a single subcircuit. is sub-
circuit takes on many of the characteristic properties of a single BJT, modiﬁed due to the presence
of two transistors. e subcircuit nodes that correspond to the so called “composite transistor” are
labeled in Figure 6.4 as BC; C C and EC.
e fourth terminal in Darlington subcircuits exists solely for DC biasing. Commercially pack-
aged Darlingtons allow for the fourth terminal in several diﬀerent ways:
• by providing a separate external connection (a four terminal package),
• internally providing for the bias current or voltage source with additional circuitry within
the package (a three terminal package), or,
• in the case of the bias current source, occasionally eliminating it entirely (a three terminal
package). is case is equivalent to setting the bias current source, IBias, to zero value.
³Other slight variations occur. ese variations are due a variety of possible connections for the voltage and current biasing
sources, VCC and IBias.

THE DUAL COMMON-COLLECTOR DARLINGTON
CONFIGURATION
e Dual Common-Collector Darlington Conﬁguration (Figure 6.4) is the most common of the
two Darlington Conﬁgurations: a wide variety of commercial packages of this conﬁguration of
transistors is available. In this conﬁguration, the base of the composite transistor is the base of the
ﬁrst BJT (Q1), the two BJT collectors are connected together to form the composite collector,
and the emitter of the second BJT (Q2) forms the composite emitter. As one might expect, the
composite transistor can operate in all four regions that are usually associated with BJTs: the cut-
oﬀ, saturation, forward-active, and inverse-active regions. Simpliﬁed models, and their equivalent
circuits, of composite transistor operation in each region are of the same form as those developed
for BJTs in Section 3.4 (Book 1). However, the composite transistor will have characteristic pa-
rameters in each of these regions that vary from typical BJT values.
In the cut-oﬀregion, the composite transistor operates as three terminals with open circuits
between. In order to turn the subcircuit on, both BJT base-emitter junctions must become forward
biased. Since the composite base-emitter consists of two BJT base-emitter junctions, the typical
turn-on base-emitter voltage for this composite transistor⁴ is approximately double that of a single
BJT:
VBE.on/  1:2 V:
(6.3)
e saturation region is modeled by two voltage sources: one modeling the base-emitter terminal
pair and the other modeling the collector-emitter terminal pair. e composite base-emitter is
modeled by two ON BJTs. us, in the saturation region,
VBE.sat/  1:6 V:
(6.4)
⁴For simplicity of discussion, all values given in this section will be typical for conﬁgurations using Silicon npn transistors. Dar-
lington pairs constructed with pnp transistors will have similar values with appropriate sign diﬀerences. ese sign diﬀerences
are discussed in Chapter 3 (Book 1).

436
6. MULTIPLE-TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS
e transition from the saturation region into the forward-active region occurs when the
collector-emitter voltage of Q1 becomes too large. At this collector-emitter voltage, Q2 is in the
forward-active region (VCE > 0:2 V). us, the composite collector-emitter voltage is the sum of
the saturation collector-emitter voltage of Q1 and the forward-active base-emitter voltage of Q2:
VCE.sat/  0:9 V:
(6.5)
e forward-active region is modeled by the ratio of collector current to base current and the base-
emitter voltage. e current ratio can be derived by observing that the composite collector current
is the sum of the individual collector currents:
IC D IC1 C IC2
(6.6)
D ˇF1IB1 C ˇF 2IB2
D ˇF1IB1 C ˇF 2 Œ.ˇF1 C 1/IB1   IBias :
(6.7)
For large values of ˇF , this expression is commonly approximated as:
IC  ˇF1ˇF 2IB1   ˇF 2IBias:
(6.8)
Incremental changes in the composite collector current are proportional to the product of the BJT
current gains: consequently it can be very large. e composite base-emitter voltage is the sum of
the forward active base-emitter voltages for the two BJTs:
V  1:4 V:
(6.9)
e emitter current is calculated to be:
 IE D .ˇF1 C 1/.ˇF 2 C 1/IB   .ˇF 2 C 1/IBias:
(6.10)
Due to the addition, in the composite transistor, of a fourth terminal with non-zero current, the
current ﬂowing out the emitter terminal is, in general, not equal to the sum of the base and emitter
currents.
e inverse-active region is similar to the forward-active region. Darlington circuits rarely
enter into this region since the multiple transistor design brings no beneﬁts over single transistors
operating in this region.
Small-Signal h-Parameters
When a Darlington pair in the forward-active region is used in an ampliﬁer, it is appropriate to
model the composite transistor with an h-parameter model. e composite h-parameters can be
obtained from the h-parameter models of the individual BJTs as is shown in Figure 6.5.

be noted that the composite transistor input resistance parameter, hie, can not be obtained from
the composite collector current in the same manner as with a BJT: the value obtained by that
process will be much too small. However, similar operations can be performed. e exact value
of hie depends on the collector current IC as well an on IBias, but a good approximation can be
made that is independent of IBias. Two common bias schemes are:
• IBias D 0
• IBias set so that the two BJT collector currents are identical.

In that the output impedance is the reciprocal of output admittance, the output impedance of a
cascode conﬁguration has been shown to be larger than that of a single common-emitter stage by
a factor of 1 C hfe.
A FET variation of the cascode conﬁguration is often found in analog design. e FET
cascode consists of a Common-Source—Common Gate connection. As one might expect, the
only major change over a single common-source stage is increased output impedance. Since the
ampliﬁcation of a common-source stage is highly dependent on the output impedance, rd, of the
FET, the FET cascode will have greatly improved voltage gain. One drawback is that maximum
symmetrical swing may be degraded with the FET cascode.

THE BIFET DARLINGTON CONFIGURATION
No useful all-FET Darlington circuits exist: the potential for increased input impedance and
current gain have little signiﬁcance in FET circuitry. ere is, however, a useful Darlington circuit
connection that combines the properties of FETs and BJTs. In this conﬁguration the input BJT
of a Darlington pair is replaced by a FET (Figure 6.10). e connection retains the near-inﬁnite
input impedance of the FET and, with the addition of the BJT, attains a larger eﬀective composite
transconductance, gm and a lower output resistance, rd. Common technologies currently in use

Similarly, a small-signal analysis of the composite transistor can be performed in a similar manner

EMITTER-COUPLED AND SOURCE-COUPLED PAIRS
Emitter-coupled and source-coupled pairs of transistors are widely used to form the basic el-
ement of diﬀerential ampliﬁers with the most common application being the input stage of an
Operational Ampliﬁer. e output of such ampliﬁer stages is proportional to the diﬀerence in the
input voltages and has a high Common-Mode Rejection Ratio. High CMRR allows the input
to be diﬀerential or single (one input at a ﬁxed voltage). e output can be similarly diﬀerential
or single (as in the OpAmp).
Another useful property of emitter-coupled and source-coupled ampliﬁer stages is that they
can be cascaded without interstage coupling capacitors: any common-mode DC oﬀset that may
be present has a negligible eﬀect on the performance of any stage. Input impedance is typically
high for FET pairs and moderate for BJT pairs: output impedance is moderate for all types.
6.3.1
EMITTER-COUPLED PAIRS
e basic topology for an emitter-coupled pair is shown in Figure 6.11. In order to form a good
diﬀerential ampliﬁer, the circuit must by a symmetric network: the transistors must have similar
properties and corresponding collector resistances should have identical values (Rc1 D Rc2 D
Rc). ese collector resistances are often discrete resistors; in integrated circuit applications, they
are more often active loads.⁹ In integrated circuit realizations of an emitter-coupled pair, the
biasing network is typically in the form of a transistor current source; in other realizations it can
be as simple as a single resistor. For generality, the biasing network is shown in its most general
form as a Norton equivalent source.
e topology of this ampliﬁer is very similar to that of the input section of an Emitter-
Coupled Logic gate. Previous explorations of that logic gate family¹⁰ found that a linear region
of ampliﬁcation exists in the transition region between the two logic levels. is region extends
over a very small range of input voltage diﬀerences: the diﬀerence between the voltages at the two
BJT base terminals can not exceed a few tenths of a volt before one of the transistors enters the
cut-oﬀregion and the ampliﬁer saturates. Still, as has been seen in the case of the OpAmp, it is
not necessary for the input voltage diﬀerence to be large in order to create a highly useful device.
⁹Active loads are discussed in Section 6.5.
¹⁰Emitter-Coupled Logic gates are discussed in Section 3.5 (Book 1).

e most signiﬁcant performance parameter for a diﬀerential ampliﬁer is the diﬀerential mode
gain. Also of signiﬁcance is the common-mode rejection ratio: the ratio of diﬀerential mode
gain to common-mode gain¹³ e best path to ﬁnd these performance parameters is through
AC analysis and the use of superposition. e AC equivalent circuit for zero vi2 is shown in

DC Analysis of the Source-Coupled Pair
DC analysis of FET circuits is inherently more complicated than BJT circuits due to the highly
non-linear large-signal behavior of FETs. us, a closed-form expression for the quiescent FET
drain current is not easily derived. If, however, the circuit is truly symmetric, the DC analysis can
be accomplished through the use of a “half-circuit” as shown in Figure 6.14.
Half-circuit analysis uses the property that the drain currents for the two FETs are identical:
thus the eﬀect of the Norton source on one of the FETs appears to be modiﬁed. is modiﬁcation
changes the apparent Norton source: the value of the Norton current is halved and the Norton
resistance appears to be doubled. e drain current and gate-source voltage for this single FET
quiescent equivalent circuit can be obtained using the half-circuit quiescent equivalent and the
techniques outlined in Chapter 4 (Book 1). ese derived quiescent conditions and the FET

VARIATIONS ON THE THEME
In an eﬀort to improve the various performance characteristics of emitter-coupled and source-
coupled ampliﬁers, designers often change the circuit topology while keeping its basic character-
istics. Two common techniques for altering circuit performance are:
• Including a resistor between the emitter or source terminal and the common terminal
• Using a compound transistor (Darlington, etc.) instead of a single transistor
Additional resistors have the eﬀect of increasing the range of input voltages over which the am-
pliﬁer is linear and increases the input resistance of emitter-coupled ampliﬁers. Compound tran-
sistors can have a variety of eﬀects. Figure 6.16 shows a simpliﬁed schematic of the input stage
of an OpAmp that uses compound Darlington transistors and additional emitter resistors to alter
performance characteristics.
While the circuit of Figure 6.16 indicates a multiple BJT diﬀerential ampliﬁer, the com-
pound transistors are not limited to BJTs. BiFET and BiCMOS technologies allow for the mix-
ing of transistor types in the diﬀerential pair as long as the circuit remains symmetric. Analysis of
such ampliﬁers follows the same basic techniques as have been demonstrated in this section. e
compound transistor parameters rather than single transistor parameters are used and appropri-
ate resistances (R1 and/or R2 in the previous derivations) are modiﬁed to reﬂect any additional
emitter or source resistors.

TRANSISTOR CURRENT SOURCES
Current sources may be used to bias the transistor circuit in the forward active region for a small-
signal ampliﬁer. e biasing schemes explored thus far apply a voltage across the base-emitter
junction of the BJT or the gate-source of the FET. Current source biasing may be used in lieu
of a base or gate resistor bias network to set the quiescent collector or drain current, and is the
preferred method for biasing diﬀerential ampliﬁers. Bias networks in integrated circuits most
often depend on current sources.
6.4.1
SIMPLE BIPOLAR CURRENT SOURCE
A simple BJT current source that delivers an approximately constant collector current IC is shown
in Figure 6.17. For this current source to be operational, the collector voltage of the BJT must be
suﬃciently more positive than the emitter voltage such that the transistor operates in the forward
active region. e constant current is supplied by the collector of the transistor.
e transistor collector current can be obtained, by applying the node voltage method at
VB; that is, by summing the currents at the base of Q,

An additional beneﬁt of using diodes this and similar biasing networks is the reduction
of collector current dependence on base-emitter temperature. e reduction of collector current
dependence on the BJT junction temperature increases the stability of the operating point.
6.4.2
CURRENT MIRROR
e simple current source in Figure 6.17 is useful but requires two diodes, one transistor, and three
resistors to conﬁgure. A two transistor current source, which use fewer components (in particular,
resistors) is shown in Figure 6.18. is conﬁguration is commonly called a current mirror,
e constant current is supplied from the collector of Q2. e base-collector voltage of Q1
is equal to zero ensuring that the BJT is operating in the forward-active region. is connection

IC2 is also dependent on VCE2. For a constant base current, the collector current will increase
slowly as the collector-emitter voltage increases. In the current mirror of Figure 6.18, VCE2  VCE1
since VCE1 D VBE1. e value of VCE2 depends on the bias voltage at the collector of Q2. Typically,
VCE2  VCE1. Depending on the quiescent conditions of Q2, IC2 may be up to 10% larger than
IC1.
Stability is an important parameter of constant current sources. Variations in parame-
ter values will cause an undesirable ﬂuctuation in IC2. e stability factors deﬁned in Sec-

By increasing R, better stability against variations in base-emitter voltage and quiescent
point shifts due to varying ˇF can be obtained. e advantage of the current mirror in Figure 6.18
is the reduction in the number of resistors that makes the circuit more applicable to integrated
circuits.
6.4.3
CURRENT MIRROR WITH ADDITIONAL STABILITY
A third transistor can be added to gain more stability in the quiescent point. Using three identical
transistors, Q3 in a common collector conﬁguration at the base of Q1 and Q2 is used to provide
additional stability. e three transistor current source is shown in Figure 6.19.

Recall that in the two transistor current mirror in Section 6.4.2, the ˇ stability factor was
approximately proportional to ˇ 2
F . For the three transistor current mirror, the ˇ stability factor is
approximately proportional to ˇ 3
F . erefore, the stability of the three transistor current mirror
has greater stability than the two transistor current mirror by a factor of ˇF . is indicates that
the collector current is tightly bound to the desired value caused by operating temperature swings
or through parameter changes as a result of interchanging individual transistors with slightly
diﬀerent characteristics, which is commonly encountered when mass producing BJT circuits.
6.4.4
WILSON CURRENT SOURCE
e Wilson current source is used when low sensitivity to transistor base currents is desired and
is shown in Figure 6.20. e transistors are again assumed to be identical for this analysis.
Applying Kirchhoﬀ’s Current Law to the collector of Q3 yields and expression for the emitter

From Equation (6.109) it is apparent that the output current diﬀers from the reference current
by a small amount corresponding to approximately 2=ˇ2
F .
6.4.5
WIDLAR CURRENT SOURCE
In the two and three transistor current mirrors, the load current IC2 is approximately equal to
the reference current for large ˇF . To supply a load current of milliamperes with power supply
voltages in the order of 10 V, the reference resistor must be in the several thousands of Ohms. is
poses little problem for the designer. However, if the load current is small (in the order of 5 A),
the required reference resistor approaches or exceeds 1 M. In Operational ampliﬁer integrated
circuits, the low input current requirement mandates a low bias current for the input emitter-
coupled diﬀerential ampliﬁer. A resistor of this magnitude is prohibitive in terms of the area that
it would require on the chip. It is also diﬃcult to fabricate accurate resistance values on integrated
circuit chips.
e load and reference currents can be made to be substantially diﬀerent by forcing the base-
emitter voltages of Q1 and Q2 to be unequal in the two transistor current mirror of Figure 6.18.
One way to achieve this goal of substantially diﬀerent load and reference currents is the addition
of an emitter resistor to Q2 as is done in the Widlar current source shown in Figure 6.21.

MOSFET constant current source. A simple enhancement mode NMOSFET current mirror is
shown in Figure 6.24. FETs M1 and M2 are connected as saturated devices. e reference current
IREF and the load current ID3 are determined by using the expression for the drain current.
e NMOSFET M3 is assumed to be in saturation.

ACTIVE LOADS
In integrated circuit ampliﬁers, transistor current source conﬁgurations are often used as active
loads. Since small-signal gain in ampliﬁers is directly proportional to the load resistance, large
loads are desired to achieve large gain. However, increasing the load requires that a large power
supply voltage must be used in order to keep to transistor in the proper region of operation. e
quiescent point will be also be altered. Both of these consequences to the use of a large resistor
for a load are undesirable.
Active loads using current source conﬁgurations are commonly used to provide the high
load required for increasing small-signal gain. e small-signal output resistance of the current
source conﬁguration is used as the load to the amplifying circuit. A Norton and évenin equiv-
alent model of a transistor current source is shown in Figure 6.25.
For the Norton equivalent model, the analysis and design of current sources, discussed in
Section 6.4 using the Ebers-Moll model, is used to determine IO. e output resistance RO is
found by determining the performing small-signal analysis on the current source. Since a tran-
sistor is used in place of a resistor, the load is dependent on both the inherent transistor char-
acteristics and the quiescent point of the circuit. In particular, the Early voltage, VA, is of great
importance when determining the active load of a small-signal transistor ampliﬁer.

COMMON-EMITTER AMPLIFIER WITH ACTIVE LOAD

of a simple pnp current mirror. e pnp current mirror provides the load for the npn BJT common-

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e range of transistor ampliﬁers available for use was expanded in this chapter to include the use
of multiple transistor applications. is extension to allows the designer to create ampliﬁers that
have a combination of ampliﬁcation, input resistance, and output resistance that is not within the
capabilities of single transistor ampliﬁers.
Cascaded-stage designs, consisting of several simple stages in series, are the dominant form
of multiple transistor ampliﬁers. Closely related to cascaded-stage designs are the Darlington and
similar grouped-transistor ampliﬁcation stages.
Other common multiple transistor ampliﬁcation stages are based on diﬀerential inputs
rather than inputs solely referenced to a common terminal. Emitter coupled and source coupled

6.6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

transistor pairs form the basis for diﬀerential ampliﬁers. Among the many needs for diﬀerential
inputs are many OpAmp applications.
While the addition of additional ampliﬁcation stages complicates the process, the modeling
and analysis techniques for multiple transistor ampliﬁers follow the same basic procedure that has
been previously described:
1. Determine the quiescent (DC) conditions—verify all transistors are in the proper operating
region
2. Determine the small-signal parameters for each transistor from the quiescent conditions
3. Create an AC equivalent circuit
4. Determine the AC performance for the circuit
5. Add the results of the DC and AC analysis to obtain total circuit performance.
Although each step of the procedure may be more complicated, simple steps taken together
provide the desired results.
Integrated circuit ampliﬁer designs are an area where the use of multiple transistors prevails.
In discrete applications resistors are cost eﬀective and reliable; in IC applications they create a
multitude of design obstacles. e use of multiple-transistor current sources as ampliﬁer bias
networks solves many of the problems. Current sources can also provide high resistance active
loads for many of the single and multiple transistor ampliﬁer types. Active loads provide high
gain without the use of large resistors or high-voltage sources.
While the interconnection of many transistors in simple ampliﬁers can satisfy many design
goals, it does not always provide the optimum design. e sensitivity of these designs to transistor
parameter variation is, on occasion, a concern. High power applications also put constraints on
ampliﬁer designs. ese design concerns and several solutions are explored in Chapters 7 and 8.
Summary Design Example
A particular electronic application requires the ampliﬁcation of the diﬀerence of two voltages by a
factor of 200 ˙ 20. Each input source has an output resistance of 50 . e output of the ampliﬁer
must also be diﬀerential with each output having an output resistance of 2:7 k. Available voltages
sources are at ground potential and 10 V. It is expected that this design may eventually realized
in a bipolar IC application where the individual BJTs are described by:
ˇF D 200
VA D 160:
Solution:
e design requirements suggest a emitter-coupled diﬀerential ampliﬁer. e possibility
of eventual IC realization implies that the diﬀerential pair should be biased with a BJT current

It is usually not a good design choice to cascade two simple common-collector ampliﬁer
stages. Investigate this cascade by performing the following design:
(a) Using a Silicon BJT with ˇF D 150, design a simple one transistor, common-
collector ampliﬁer to meet the following design goals:
Emitter Resistor,
Re D 1 k
Power Supply,
VCC D 10 V
Q-point
VCEQ D 5 V
Stage Input Resistance,
Rin D 20 k
(includes bias resistors):
(b) Determine the voltage gain, current gain, and output resistance of this simple stage
(c) Capacitively cascade two stages of the design from part a—compare performance
characteristics (including input resistance) of this two-stage ampliﬁer with the
single-stage ampliﬁer of part b). Comment on results.
6.5.
In most multistage ampliﬁer designs, common-base ampliﬁer stages are best used as input
stages to an ampliﬁer cascade: they have little value when used as intermediate or ﬁnal
stages. Investigate this simple design principle by comparing the voltage and current gain
of two-stage, capacitively-coupled cascades consisting of the two given ampliﬁers in the
two conﬁgurations: CB-CE and CE-CB.

Power Ampliﬁers and Output
Stages
In general, analog ampliﬁers discussed in the previous chapters are described as small-signal cir-
cuits whose purpose is to increase the amplitude of the input signal or act as an impedance buﬀer
between other ampliﬁer stages. In reality, these ampliﬁers accept signals over a broad range of am-
plitudes. is chapter describes ampliﬁers (or ampliﬁcation stages) that are capable of delivering
high power levels at the output.
Power ampliﬁers must be capable of delivering a speciﬁc amount of power to a load, such as a
stereo ampliﬁer to a pair of speakers or a radio frequency ampliﬁer to a broadcasting antenna. ey
are also used as output stages in integrated circuits. Because high output powers may be involved,
the eﬃciency of the ampliﬁer to convert a low-power signal to high power becomes increasingly
important. Ineﬃciency causes unwanted increases in transistor operating temperature and may
lead to accelerated device failure. Because power ampliﬁer stages may deliver high output power to
low impedance loads, they are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the low- power small-signal ampliﬁers.
e large signal nature of power ampliﬁers warrants special design considerations that may
not be signiﬁcant for small-signal ampliﬁers. erefore, small-signal approximations and models
either are not appropriate or must be used with care. In large-signal operation, signals transverse
the extremes of the forward-active region of the transistor causing distortion at the output. at
is, when a pure sinusoid is introduced to a power ampliﬁer, the output may no longer be a pure
sinusoid, but a signal composed of the original sinusoid (at some amplitude determined by the
ampliﬁcation) and its Fourier (harmonic) components. e relative amplitude of the fundamental
component decreases with respect to the Fourier components as distortion increases.
Distortion is deﬁned in one of several ways depending on the particular application of the
circuit. Measures of distortion include:
• Total harmonic distortion (THD) commonly used for audio circuits,
• Intermodulation distortion (IMD) using the two-tone ratio method for radio and mi-
crowave frequency circuits,
• Second- and third-order intercept points also used for radio and microwave circuits,
• Composite second-order (CSO) and composite third-order beat ratio (CTBR) used for
cable television transmission circuits.

e design and analysis concepts introduced in this chapter are:
• Analysis of distortion
• Design of large-signal (power) ampliﬁers with particular interest in reduction of distortion
• ermal consideration that must be taken into account when designing power ampliﬁers.
7.1
POWER AMPLIFIER CLASSIFICATION
In previous chapters, ampliﬁers were classiﬁed in terms of their circuit conﬁgurations (common-
emitter, common-collector, common-base, common-drain, common-source, and common-gate).
Another classiﬁcation scheme is used when classifying power ampliﬁers. is scheme labels cir-
cuits according to the portion of the period of the output waveform during which the transistors
conduct. e measure of designation is the conduction angle of each transistor in the circuit,
assuming a sinusoidal input.
Regardless of the classiﬁcation of the power ampliﬁer, it must be capable of handling large
signal amplitudes where the current and voltages swings may be a signiﬁcantly large fraction of
the bias values. In such cases, small-signal analysis and models may not be appropriate and large
signal (DC) transfer characteristics must be used. e limitation on small-signal operation is
discussed in this section.
7.1.1
CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
e ampliﬁer classiﬁcations by conduction angle for sinusoidal inputs are shown in Table 7.1. e
output (collector or drain) current through a transistor for class A, B, AB, and C power ampliﬁers
are shown in Figure 7.1. In Figure 7.1a, the current ﬂows through the transistor over the whole
period: this is classiﬁed as Class A operation. In Class B operation, shown in Figure 7.1b, each
transistor only conducts over half the period of the input sinusoidal waveform. Class AB opera-
tion, shown in Figure 7.1c, illustrates current ﬂow through each transistor for greater than a half
cycle but less than the full cycle of the input sinusoid. Figure 7.1d shows Class C operation where
the each transistor conducts over less than half cycle of the input sinusoid. Class D operation is
not shown since the conduction angle could vary with time over the entire cycle.
Initially, it may seem as if Class A operation is the only conﬁguration that will yield low
distortion signals. Class B and class AB power ampliﬁers assure signal continuity by making
use of arrangements of two transistors that allow each transistor to share portions of the input
signal conduction angle. Class C ampliﬁers provide single-frequency sinusoidal output by driving
resonant circuits over a small portion of the cycle; the continuity of the sinusoidal output is assured
by the tuned circuit.¹ In Class D operation, there are two inputs, the input signal and a sampling
¹Class C ampliﬁers are used for narrow-band signal applications. e focus of this section is on broad-band ampliﬁers.

square wave or pulse width modulated signal. In essence, the sampling signal forces the transistors
to either turn on or oﬀover the interval of the sampling wave, yielding a sampled version of the
input signal. is sampled signal is then ﬁltered to yield the desired waveform.
Class A, B, and AB are studied in some detail in this Sections 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4, respectively.
Class C and D ampliﬁers are not discussed since their analysis is beyond the scope of this book.

LIMITS ON DISTORTIONLESS “SMALL-SIGNAL” OPERATION
To investigate the limitations of analyses using small-signal models, the limiting mechanisms
must be understood. Graphical method load-line analysis demonstrates the large-signal nature of

which may be a signiﬁcant fraction of its quiescent current and voltage.

in the input characteristics. e result is an asymmetric base-emitter voltage excursion about the
operating point of  0:035 V and C0:015 V. e output characteristics shows a corresponding
swing in collector currents of 5 mA to 24 mA; resulting in an asymmetric current excursion about
the operating point of  11 mA and C8 mA.
e voltage and current waveforms can be obtained from the dynamic operating curves
of Figure 7.3 and is shown in Figures 7.4 and 7.5. For a pure sinusoidal input base current, the
base-emitter voltage, collector current, and collector-emitter voltage waveforms are shown to be

516
7. POWER AMPLIFIERS AND OUTPUT STAGES
suﬀering from varying degrees of distortion. From the output characteristics, the collector-emitter
voltage waveform has a quiescent value of 6.8 V and has a voltage swing from 5.2 V to 9.0 V. e
output excursions about the operating point is  1:6 V and C3:8 V which is clearly asymmetrical.
For small-signal operation, the input signal is small which yields negligible distortion of
the output waveform. In power ampliﬁers, however, the output signals are large and potentially
distorted. erefore, simple linear small-signal analysis cannot necessarily be used eﬀectively. In-
stead, large-signal transfer characteristics are best used to determine the operating characteristics
of the power ampliﬁer.
e limit of distortionless “small-signal” analysis is diﬃcult to deﬁne since it is dependent
on ampliﬁer distortion speciﬁcations. However, some sense of the limitation of small-signal anal-
ysis can be found by determining the relationship between the base-emitter voltage swing and the
output current.
Assume that the base-emitter voltage is

(7.1)
where
VBEQ D quiescent base-emitter voltage (DC),

It is apparent from Equation (7.4) that the emitter current and, in turn, the collector current
of the transistor in Figure 7.1 are proportional to the normalized ratio of ex cos !t=ex for any ﬁxed
value of x. Figure 7.6 shows the normalized emitter current (proportional to the collector current)
as a function of time over two cycles of the variation in the base-emitter voltage. e plot clearly
shows that by the time x D 10, the emitter current is clearly distorted. Small-signal analysis can
still be used under these circumstances, but will not identify the distortion contained in the output
signal.

e power ampliﬁer in Figure 7.7 is re-drawn using the equivalent models for the cutoﬀ,

e transistor Q1 is cutoﬀwhen VBE < VBE.on/. No current ﬂows through Q1, eﬀectively
creating an open circuit at the emitter, base, and collector nodes as shown in Figure 7.8a. ere-
fore, VO D 0 until the transistor turns on with Vi > VBE.on/. Recall that a typical value of VBE.on/
for silicon transistors is 0.6 V.
When Q1 turns on, the transistor operates in the forward-active region and the ampliﬁer

A typical transfer characteristic of the circuit in Figure 7.7 is shown in Figure 7.10.
e transfer characteristic in Figure 7.10 indicates that when the input voltage exceeds
Vi.f  a=sat/ then the output voltage of the common-collector power ampliﬁer will begin to “clip”
and distort the output. e output will also “clip” when the input voltage is less than VBE.
If the common-collector ampliﬁer is operating in the “linear” region of the large signal
transfer characteristic, it may be assumed that there is little nonlinear distortion. In this case, the
power and eﬃciency calculations are straightforward.

As expected, the eﬃciency for the common-collector power ampliﬁer of Figure 7.7 with the circuit
values of this example is less than the ideal maximum eﬃciency of 25%.
Integrated circuits also use power output stages for their low distortion and low output re-
sistance characteristic. Consider the common-collector circuit biased by a current mirror shown
in Figure 7.12. Like its discrete counterpart, when this circuit is to be used as the output ampli-
ﬁer stage in an integrated circuit, it must be capable of handling large signal amplitudes where
the current and voltages swings may be a signiﬁcantly large fraction of the bias values. In such
cases, small signal analysis and models may not be appropriate and large signal (DC) transfer
characteristics must be used.
In the circuit of Figure 7.12, Q2; Q3, and RB forms a current mirror to bias the common-
collector circuit formed by Q1. e large signal transfer characteristic is

Referring to the transfer characteristic shown in Figure 7.13, consider the case when the
load resistor is large (designated RL large). When the load resistor is large, the natural logarithm
in Equation (7.28) remains relatively constant with changing VO. Physically, this means that for
large load resistors, the current in the load is small and that IE1  IQ. is also implies that VBE1
is approximately constant. erefore, when both Q1 and Q2 are in the forward active region,
the transfer characteristic for RL large is nearly a straight line oﬀset by the quiescent base-emitter
voltage VBEQ1 on the Vi axis.

into cutoﬀ. en VO no longer increases with Vi.
For a large positive input voltage with RL small, the transfer characteristic is similar to the

COMMON-EMITTER
Common-emitter power ampliﬁer stages are frequently used as output stage drivers of multi-
transistor ampliﬁers. However, common-emitter output stages are not often used in integrated
circuit design because of the superior characteristics of the common-collector stages (low output
resistance and low distortion).
Consider a common-collector power ampliﬁer driven by a voltage Vi, shown in Fig-
ure 7.13. As in the common-collector power ampliﬁer analysis, the linear BJT models of Fig-
ure 3.8 (Book 1)for the cutoﬀ, forward-active, and saturation regions are used to ﬁnd the large
signal transfer function for the common-collector power ampliﬁer.
e common-emitter power ampliﬁer in Figure 7.14 is analyzed in the same way as the
common-collector conﬁguration using the equivalent models for the cutoﬀ, forward-active, and
saturation regions.

From Equation (7.48), the transfer function is an exponential. erefore, the transfer char-
acteristics shows a curvature. between the extreme output voltages. is causes distortion of the
output signal that is signiﬁcantly more pronounced than that of the common-collector ampliﬁer
of Figure 7.12. As in the common-collector power ampliﬁer in Figure 7.12, the upper limit of the
transfer function depends on the size of RL.
e maximum eﬃciency of the current source biased common-emitter output stage is also
25%.
7.2.3
TRANSFORMER-COUPLED CLASS A POWER AMPLIFIER
If a load is connected directly to the transistor as in the common-emitter power ampliﬁer in
Figure 7.14, the quiescent current must pass through the load. e load increases the required DC
power and reduces eﬃciency since the quiescent current through the load does not contribute to
the AC signal component. To circumvent this problem, the load is commonly transformer coupled
to the transistor as shown in Figure 7.18.
e transformer is used as an impedance matching element. To transfer a signiﬁcant
amount of power to a low impedance load, such as a the voice coil of a loudspeaker which is
typically between 4 and 15 , it is necessary to use an output matching transformer.

CLASS B POWER AMPLIFIERS
Class B ampliﬁers are widely used because of the low standby DC current requirements, unlike
Class A ampliﬁers that require an operating point characterized by a large collector current. e
reduction in the standby or DC current requirement in Class B operation is achieved by biasing
each of the two transistors at cut-oﬀ. is in turn reduces the quiescent collector power dissipation
in the transistors.
Since Class B power ampliﬁer operation has transistors conducting in only one half of the
period of the input signal, two transistors are necessary in a push-pull arrangement to add the two
halves of the cycle for the reconstruction of the entire ampliﬁed sinusoid, shown in Figure 7.20.
e transformer load coupling shown in the Figure 7.7 is widely used. e collector supply is fed
into the center tap of the output transformer primary. e base bias current is fed into the center
tap of the input transformer secondary.

e input characteristics and the resulting output in Figure 7.21 clearly shows the load current
distortion. is distortion is referred to as the crossover distortion. Crossover distortion is best
understood by studying Figure 7.22. e nonlinear input/output characteristic of the push-pull
conﬁguration is shown. e exponential nature of the curve indicates high input resistance at low
signal levels. Little base current ﬂows until the base-emitter voltage exceeds V. e resulting col-
lector current will also be small until the input voltage is suﬃciently high since the IC is essentially
proportional to the base current. e resulting output from a push-pull Class B conﬁguration is
a sinusoid that exhibits crossover distortion.
It is customary to treat only one transistor when analyzing the push-pull conﬁguration since
each is operating at identical currents and voltages into an identical load, under the assumption
that the transistors have identical characteristics. e output characteristic with load line of one
of the transistors in the Class B ampliﬁer of Figure 7.20 is shown in Figure 7.23.
e DC load line per transistor is one-half of the resistance of the output transformer pri-
mary. If high-quality output transformers are used, the resistance of the primary can be assumed
to be negligible. erefore, the DC load line has an inﬁnite negative slope. e AC load line has

To analyze the Class B push-pull conﬁguration, it is assumed that each transistor is op-
erating at identical levels driving identical loads. e DC load per stage consists of one-half of
the total primary DC resistance which, for good transformers, can be considered to be negligi-

COMPLEMENTARY CLASS B (PUSH-PULL) OUTPUT STAGE
A simpliﬁed version of a complementary Class B ampliﬁer arrangement that is often used as an
integrated circuit output stage is shown in Figure 7.24. is arrangement uses complementary
transistors (one pnp and one npn) in common-collector conﬁguration. By using complementary
transistors, the need for input and output transformers is eliminated. e transfer characteristic
is identical to that of the transformer coupled Class B power ampliﬁer.
e principle of operation of the simpliﬁed complementary Class B output stage is as fol-
lows. For jVij < VBE.on/, both Q1 and Q2 are cutoﬀ. When Vi > VBE.on/; Q1 turns on and enters
the forward saturation region. Q2 remains in cutoﬀ. e upper limit on Vo occurs when Q1
saturates at Vi D VCC   VCE1.sat/. For negative values of Vi, the same situation holds true with
when the roles of Q1 and Q2 are reversed. e lower limit on Vo occurs when Q2 saturates at
Vi D  .VCC   VCE2.sat//.
CMOS power buﬀers in the inverter conﬁguration, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Book 1), are
commonly used to interface CMOS logic to saturated logic (e.g., TTL). is practice is common
in instances where a conventional CMOS gate may not be able to supply the required input power,
while at the same time provide suﬃciently low output voltages for the TTL gates.

Equation (7.68) indicates that for a very small input at V2 D Vi, the output voltage from the push-
pull stage is zero. erefore, the crossover region in the transfer characteristic has been reduced
from ˙VBE.on/ to less than 5 V. So essentially, there is no crossover distortion to speak of when
using the conﬁguration in Figure 7.25.

CLASS AB POWER AMPLIFIERS
In Section 7.3, Class B power ampliﬁers were shown to have a maximum eﬃciency of approxi-
mately 78.5%. Unfortunately, feedback was required to eliminate the nonlinear transfer charac-
teristic caused by crossover distortion.
An alternate method to feedback for reducing or nearly eliminating crossover distortion
is to bias each transistor in the push-pull conﬁguration so that they are barely in the forward
active region with Vi D 0. One possible conﬁguration to achieve this bias condition to eliminate
crossover distortion is shown in Figure 7.26. is class of ampliﬁer is called a Class AB power
ampliﬁer/output stage since the transistors are always biased as in Class A operation, but is biased
at a fraction of the peak load current as in Class B operation.

on and is in the forward active region. e output voltage due to Q1 saturates at VCC   VCE1.sat/.

e Class AB output stage shown is used in the  A741 OpAmp. A simpliﬁed version of the

In analyzing Figure 7.28b, Q13 A acts as a constant current source of 0.22 mA. Q23 is the
input transistor to the Class AB output stage. With Vi D 0, the output complementary transistor
pair Q14 and Q20 are biased at a collector current of about 0.17 mA by the diodes Q19 and Q18.
e current through Q19 and Q18 produces a voltage,

It is interesting to compare the eﬃciency of well-designed ampliﬁers as a function of output
signal strength (Figure 7.29). e output power of all ampliﬁers is proportional to the square of
output signal strength. Class A ampliﬁers are characterized by constant DC power: this results in
a parabolic eﬃciency curve. Class B ampliﬁers are characterized by DC power that is proportional
to signal strength: a linear eﬃciency curve results. Class AB ampliﬁers lie between the two other
classes with Class B as an upper limit.

In order to increase the gain of output stages in integrated circuits while reducing base

(see Section 6.2.1). Compound pnp Darlington conﬁgurations are also used. Since in good quality
pnp BJTs are diﬃcult to fabricate in integrated circuits, an alternate compound conﬁguration
shown in Figure 7.30 is often used. is compound transistor has a current gain of ˇ  ˇ1ˇ2.

7.5. DISTORTION

DISTORTION
When the output signal waveform of an ampliﬁer diﬀers in general shape from the input signal
waveform, the output is said to be distorted. In particular, if a single-frequency input to an am-
pliﬁer results in an output composed of the input frequency and other frequencies, the ampliﬁer
has distorted the signal. e creation of additional frequencies is typically the result of non-linear
distortion.
Earlier, it was shown that large input signals to ampliﬁers caused the ampliﬁer under test to
yield distorted output signals. In this section, a systematic description of distortion is developed.
With this description, two common industry deﬁnitions of distortion are developed and related
to each other.
An incrementally linear power ampliﬁer⁴ has a transfer characteristic described by
vO D VDC C a1vi;
(7.74)
where
vO  the output voltage,
vi  the input voltage (AC and DC components possible),
a1  the voltage gain,
VDC  the DC oﬀset voltage at the output.
e principle of superposition applies to incrementally linear systems in a unique manner. at
is, if
vO1 D VDC C a1vi1
and
vO2 D VDC C a1vi2;
(7.75)
then the total output of a incrementally linear system is,
vO D VDC C a1.vi1 C vi2/:
(7.76)
In electronic ampliﬁers, the DC component, VDC, consists of the bias or quiescent point of the
circuit.
Superposition no longer applies when the transfer characteristic is non-linear. Figure 7.31
shows a transfer characteristic of a power ampliﬁer.
e region in Figure 7.31 that is not clipped is described by the power series,

where the fourth and higher harmonics may be ignored with negligible error.⁵ Inspection of
Equation (7.79) shows that harmonics are generated by the non-linear transfer characteristic.
Harmonics are sinusoidal terms that are multiples of the fundamental frequency, !, that is the
same frequency as the input signal. For linear power ampliﬁers, the presence of harmonics is
undesirable and are the direct result of non-linear distortion.
Additionally, there is a shift in the DC or quiescent point by the addition of a term con-
taining the constant for the squared term in the power series. e fundamental .cos !t/ term
also has increased beyond the ampliﬁcation constant associated with the fundamental by a term
proportional to the constant for the cubed term in the power series.
Equation (7.79) can be represented by a Fourier Series,
vO D VDC C A0 C A1 cos !t C A2 cos 2!t C A3 cos 3!t C    ;
(7.80)
where A0; A1; A2, and A3 are the Fourier coeﬃcients. One method that may be used to determine
the Fourier coeﬃcients is a method due to Espley.⁶ A pure sinusoidal signal voltage is applied to
the input of the power ampliﬁer. e input and output waveforms are sampled at several times
intervals to obtain the Fourier coeﬃcients of Equation (7.80). To evaluate the four coeﬃcients
⁵is approximation is valid in typical ampliﬁers where distortion is relatively small. In cases of extremely large distortion,
higher-order terms must be considered.

output power levels.⁷ In cable television applications, the radio frequency (RF) power ampliﬁers
also require very low distortion levels to deliver acceptable picture quality.
Because the distortion levels are so low, the method of Espley using the direct measure of
the transfer characteristic yields inaccurate distortion data due to noise and other spurious factors.
Instead, it is common practice to test ampliﬁer non-linearlity directly by using a pure sinusoidal
input. At the output, the harmonics are measured directly using a spectrum analyzer which dis-
plays the rms magnitude (or power) of the frequency components of the output signal. e fun-
damental and harmonics appear on the CRT of the spectrum analyzer as spikes. Measurement
of the peak of the harmonic spikes relative to the fundamental spike yields the ampliﬁer THD.
Other analyzers (e.g., audio analyzers) perform the above operation automatically and display the
THD on its front panel.
Another method, commonly used in RF and microwave electronics, for ﬁnding the amount
of distortion of an ampliﬁer is the two-tone ratio (TTR) method for determining harmonic and
intermodulation distortion (IMD) products. In the TTR method, two signals with identical am-
plitudes that are separated by some frequency are combined and used as the input to the ampliﬁer.
e output frequency components are then analyzed for distortion.

3rd-order IMD products:
(7.90)
In the TTR method, new sum and diﬀerence frequencies of the two input frequencies are created
and are called intermodulation (IMD) products or sometimes “beat” frequencies. e new sum
and diﬀerence frequencies are not harmonically related to either of the two fundamental input
frequencies.
ere are several reasons for using the TTR method over single frequency harmonic mea-
surement methods. ey include:
• Diﬃculty in generating a pure sinusoid. All real signal generators have some harmonic
content.
• In single octave⁸ systems (those systems that only operate in one octave) with multiple
sinusoids closely spaced in frequency within the single octave, third order IMD products
are of interest.
e relationship between the results of the TTR results and the harmonic coeﬃcients for the
Fourier series in Equation (7.80) can be found. e combination of the equal amplitude TTR
input signals are adjusted to equal the total input power of a single sinusoid for the harmonic
measurement. is relationship implies that the rms power of the two combined sinusoids for the
TTR is equal to the rms value of the single input for the harmonic measurement,

erefore, given TTR measure results, the Fourier coeﬃcients in Equation (7.80) and the con-
stants in the power series in Equation (7.77) can be found by applying Equation (7.93).
In Figure 7.31, as the output voltage starts to clip, another form of distortion takes place.
is type of distortion is called gain compression and is due to a gradual decrease in the voltage gain
of the ampliﬁer which, in simple terms, reduces the gain coeﬃcient to the fundamental signal in
the Fourier series in Equation (7.77). is has the eﬀect of increasing the ratio of the non-linear
distortion products to the fundamental.
e push-pull arrangement of the Class B power ampliﬁer (shown again in Figure 7.33)
not only increases eﬃciency, but despite the eﬀects of crossover distortion, has unique distortion
canceling properties.

(7.95)
e corresponding base current in Q2 is,

(7.96)

(7.97)
erefore, the Q2 collector current is,
iC2 D ICQ2 C A0 C A1 cos .!t C / C A2 cos 2 .!t C / C A3 cos 3 .!t C / C    : (7.98)

(7.99)
Since the collector currents of Q1 and Q2 are in opposite directions through the output trans-
former primary, the total output current is proportional to the diﬀerence in collector currents,

(7.100)
where k is a proportionality factor.
Equation (7.100) shows that there are only odd harmonics in the output signal when
matched transistors are used. Even harmonics have been canceled out.
Because no even harmonics are present in the output of a push-pull ampliﬁer, such a circuit
will give more output per active device for a given amount of THD.
SPICE performs Fourier analysis on any waveform in a transient analysis using the Fourier
command,
.FOUR <frequency value> <output variable>
e .FOUR command computes the amplitude and phase of any waveform with respect to fre-
quency. e Fourier components may then be plotted.
SPICE can also calculated the intermodulation distortion components of a waveform using
the command,
.DISTO <RLname> <number of points> <fstart> <fstop> <reference power>

THERMAL CONSIDERATIONS
e removal of heat from the BJT collector-base junction or the FET channel warrants consider-
able attention in power transistors due to the high power delivered to the load. For power BJTs,⁹
metallic heat sinks are often necessary to remove the heat to the surrounding air. When possible,
the metallic portion of the transistor case should make contact with the heat sink. However, it is
common practice to use a mica washer as electrical insulation between the case and the heat sink.
e washer is used to electrically isolate the heat sink from the case because in some power BJT
packages, the collector is directly attached to the case.
A speciﬁcation for the maximum allowable collector-junction temperature is found in the
manufacturer’s transistor speciﬁcations. is temperature is usually 150ıC for silicon devices. Ex-
ceeding this temperature may cause irreparable damage to the transistor. e operating junction
temperature, Tj, is dependent on the ambient temperature, Ta (typically 25ıC), the thermal resis-
tance, T , of the heat transfer path from the junction to the surrounding and the power dissipated,
PD. is relationship is expressed as:
Tj D Ta C T PD
in ıC:
(7.101)
e total thermal resistance, T has the units of Celsius/Watt.
e power dissipated by the transistor is almost entirely at the collector junction. erefore,
the power dissipated is,
PD D VCEIC:
(7.102)
e maximum power dissipation is described by the maximum dissipation hyperbola and is,
PD.max/ D .VCEIC/max D
 Tj.max/   Ta

T
:
(7.103)
e total thermal resistance is found by solving the heat transfer network analogous to an electrical
network shown in Figure 7.34.
e current source represents the heat generated (or power dissipated by the BJT), and the
three resistances represent the thermal resistances of the junction to case (jc), case to heat sink
(cs), and heat sink to the ambient environment (sa ). e total thermal resistance is,
T D jc C cs C sa D ja:
(7.104)
For power transistors, the values of jc is typically about 10ıC/W. If the transistor case and the
heat sink are insulated by a mica washer, cs has values of around 0:5ıC/W. e primary mode of
heat removal from a power transistor is conduction by the heat sink and convection from the heat
sink to the ambient surroundings. By blowing air over the heat sink, more heat may be removed.
⁹e discussion that follows is equally applicable to FETs.

Figure 7.34: Heat transfer model.
Casual inspection of Equation (7.104) indicates that by removing the heat sink in the ther-
mal path, the limitation on the power handling capacity is eliminated. However, by doing so,
the case to ambient convection and radiation has signiﬁcantly higher thermal resistance thereby
reducing the ability of the device to dissipate heat: power handling capacity is actually diminished
for this case.
Not shown in Figure 7.34 are associated thermal capacitances in parallel with each resis-
tance. e capacitance is used to model transient thermal behaviour. e thermal time constant
(resistance times capacitance) is long for the external components of the thermal model, but short
for the transistor itself.
ermal runaway can result if the rate of increase in the power dissipation with junction
temperature exceeds the ability of the heat transfer network to remove the heat. e dissipated
heat energy removed by the networks is found by diﬀerentiating Equation (7.101) with respect
to Tj. e necessary condition for thermal stability is,

Variations in the current ampliﬁcation factor and in the leakage current of the transistor causes the
change in collector current with temperature, and is ultimately dependent on the bias circuitry.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Diﬀerent classes of ampliﬁers designed for the transfer of high power to loads were analyzed. e
analysis of the ampliﬁers required the use of large-signal analysis methods. Because of the large
signal excursions, the output waveforms experience distortion.
e most commonly used power ampliﬁer/output stage classiﬁcations are the Class A, B,
and AB. In Class A operation, the transistor conducts over the whole period (360ı) of the input
signal. In Class B operation, each of the two transistors conducts over half the period (180ı). In
Class AB operation, each transistor conducts over a time greater than half the period.
Since high powers may be delivered by these circuits, the conversion of DC power to signal
power must be eﬃcient. e theoretical maximum eﬃciencies for the diﬀerent Classes of am-
pliﬁers are: 25% for Class A, 50% for Class A output transformer coupled ampliﬁers, 78.5% for
Class B, and less than 78.5% for Class AB operation.
Distortion analysis was presented with a comparison between the Total Harmonic Distor-
tion and Two-Tone Ratio methods of measurement.
Since power ampliﬁers deliver high power to their loads, the transistor may dissipate large
amounts of power in the form of heat. erefore, a heat transfer model was analyzed and related
to the stability factor.
Summary Design Example: Public Address (PA) System Ampliﬁer
In most audio electronic systems, the object is to drive one or more speakers. Typically, these
speakers can be modelled as 8  devices. erefore, the output stage of audio electronic systems
require the ability to provide maximum power transfer to a very low resistance device. One com-
mon method to drive low resistance devices is through the use of an output transformer. e
purpose of the output transformer is to provide for impedance matching between the active de-
vices and the speaker.
e output stage of a PA system will require the application of an electronic signal to an
8  speaker. Although PA systems generally do not require high audio ﬁdelity, a low distortion
system is desired since some music may be ampliﬁed on the system. For a low to moderate power
PA system, the rated (or full) load power can be in the order of 25 W, with an overload capacity
of 10%. A single rail C24 V volt power supply is commonly used. e output resistance of the
circuit that drives the output stage is 600 .
Design an output power ampliﬁer stage to fulﬁll the requirements given.

• Class A

A transformer-coupled Class AB power ampliﬁer topology, shown below, is chosen because

Feedback Ampliﬁer Principles
Feedback is the process of combining a portion of the output of a system with the system input to
achieve modiﬁed performance characteristics. Negative feedback is especially import in ampliﬁer
design as it produces several signiﬁcant beneﬁts. e primary beneﬁts are:
• e gain of the ampliﬁer is stabilized against variation in the characteristic parameters of
the active devices due to voltage or current supply changes, temperature changes, or de-
vice degradation with age. Similarly, ampliﬁer performance is stabilized within a group of
ampliﬁers that have, by necessity, active devices with diﬀerent characteristic parameters.
• e input and output impedances of the ampliﬁer can be selectively increased or decreased.
• Non-linear signal distortion is reduced.
• e midband frequency range is increased. Discussion of this aspect is delayed until Chap-
ter 11 (Book 3).
It is a rare occurrence when beneﬁts come without a price. In the case of negative feedback, the
above listed beneﬁts are accompanied by two primary drawbacks:
• e gain of the circuit is reduced. In order to regain the losses due to feedback, additional
ampliﬁcation stages must be included in the system design. is adds complexity, size,
weight, and cost to the ﬁnal design.
• ere is a possibility for oscillation to occur. Oscillation will destroy the basic gain properties
of the ampliﬁer. Discussion of this aspect will also be delayed until Chapter 11 (Book 3).
In this chapter the beneﬁts of negative feedback are considered. Basic deﬁnitions are followed
by a general discussion of the properties of a feedback system. Ampliﬁers are divided into four
categories of feedback topology and the speciﬁc properties of each topological type are derived.
While the emphasis of discussions must focus on circuit analysis techniques, a clear understanding
of the of feedback in general, and eﬀects of circuit topology in particular, is a necessity for good
feedback ampliﬁer design.
e Summary Design Example explores the common design practice of modifying existing
circuitry to meet new, but similar, performance speciﬁcations. Minimal alteration of the existing
design is explored as a possible, discretionary design criterion.

8.1
BASIC FEEDBACK CONCEPTS
e basic topology of a feedback ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 8.1. is ﬁgure shows a feedback
system in its most general form: each signal symbolized with fX. /g can take the form of either
a voltage or a current, and travels only in the direction of the indicated arrows. e triangular
symbol is a linear ampliﬁer of gain, A, as has been described in several of the preceding Chapters.
e rectangle indicates a feedback network that samples the output signal, scales it by a factor, f ,
and passes it forward to the input of the system. e circular symbol is a summing (or mixing)
junction that subtracts the feedback signal, Xf , from the inputs. Subtraction of the two inputs at
the summing junction is a key factor in negative feedback systems.

e system can be mathematically modeled in the following fashion. e output of the
ampliﬁer, Xo, is related to its input signal Xı by a linear ampliﬁcation factor (gain), A, often
called the forward or open-loop gain:
Xo D A.Xı/:
(8.1)
Since the quantities Xo and Xı can be either voltage or current signals, the forward gain, A, can
be a voltage gain, a current gain, a transconductance, or a transresistance.¹ e feedback signal,
Xf (a fraction of the output signal, Xo) is then subtracted
Xı D .Xi   Xf / D .Xi   fXo/;
(8.2)
where f is the feedback ratio deﬁning the relationship between Xf and Xo:
Xf D fXo:
(8.3)
e feedback ratio, f , can also be a ratio of voltages, currents, transconductance, or transresis-
tance. In order to have stable negative feedback, it is necessary that the mathematical sign of f be the
same as that of A.² us, the product, Af , called the loop gain, is a positive, dimensionless quantity.
¹Gain quantities are ratios of an output quantity to an input quantity. Transresistance implies the ratio of an output voltage to
an input current: transconductance is the ratio of an output current to an input voltage.
²is mathematical sign identity is necessary in the midband frequency region: Chapter 11 (Book 3) explores frequency-
dependent phase shifts in the gain and feedback quantities and their consequences.

e input-output relationship for the overall system is derived from Equations (8.1) and (8.2):

(8.4)
e overall gain of the system including the eﬀects of feedback is then written as:
Af D Xo
Xi

1 C A f :
(8.5)
Notice that Af does not need to be either a voltage or current gain: it will have the same di-
mensions as the forward gain, A. Equation (8.5) has special signiﬁcance in the study of feedback
systems and is called the basic feedback equation. e denominator of the basic feedback equation
is identiﬁed as the return diﬀerence, D, also referred to as the amount of feedback:
D D 1 C Af:
(8.6)
e return diﬀerence, for negative feedback systems, has magnitude larger than unity (in the
midband frequency region) and is often speciﬁed in decibels:
DdB D 20 log10 j1 C Af j:
(8.7)
e return diﬀerence quantiﬁes the degradation in gain due to the addition of feedback to the
system. It also plays a signiﬁcant role in quantifying changes in input and output impedance and
frequency bandwidth.
e derivation of the basic feedback equation is based on two basic idealized assumptions:
• e reverse transmission through the ampliﬁer is zero (applying a signal at the output pro-
duces no signal at the input).
• e forward transmission (left to right in Figure 8.1) through the feedback network is zero.
While these assumptions are impossible to meet in practice, a reasonable approximation is ob-
tained with the following realistic requirements:
• e reverse transmission through the ampliﬁer is negligible compared to the reverse trans-
mission through the feedback network.
• e forward transmission through the feedback network is negligible compared to the for-
ward transmission through the ampliﬁer.
In most feedback ampliﬁers the ampliﬁer is an active device with signiﬁcant forward gain and
near-zero reverse gain; the feedback network is almost always a passive network. us, in the
forward direction, the large active gain will exceed the passive attenuation signiﬁcantly. Similarly,
in the reverse direction, the gain of the feedback network, albeit typically small, is signiﬁcantly

584
8. FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER PRINCIPLES
greater than the near-zero reverse gain of the ampliﬁer. In almost every electronic application, the
above stated requirements for the use of the basic feedback equation are easily met by the typical
feedback ampliﬁer.
Some of the drawbacks and beneﬁts of feedback systems can be investigated on a simple
level by looking at the properties of the basic feedback equation (Equation (8.5)):³
1. e gain of the circuit is reduced. It has been already shown that the overall gain is the gain
of the simple ampliﬁer without feedback divided the return diﬀerence, which is larger in
magnitude than one.
2. ere is a possibility for oscillation to occur. It will be shown in Chapters 10 and 11 (Book 3)
that the gain decreases and the phase of the gain of an ampliﬁer changes as frequency in-
creases. is change in phase may cause the loop gain, Af , to change sign from positive to
negative. If this change in sign occurs at the same frequency that the magnitude of the loop
gain approaches unity, the return diﬀerence approaches zero at that frequency. Division by
zero indicates an instability: that instability is realized as an oscillation. Linear oscillators
are discussed in Chapter 12 (Book 4).
3. e gain of the ampliﬁer is stabilized against variation in the characteristic parameters of the
active devices. It has been shown in previous chapters, that the gain, A, of an ampliﬁer
is highly dependent on the parameters of the active devices. ese parameters are highly
dependent on temperature, bias conditions, and manufacturing tolerances. It is therefore
desirable to design ampliﬁers that are reasonably insensitive to the variation of the device
parameters.
e relationship between the diﬀerential change in gain due to device parameter variation
with and without feedback is obtained by diﬀerentiating Equation (8.5):

(8.9)
Stable negative feedback ampliﬁers require that the return diﬀerence have magnitude greater than
unity:
.1 C Af / > 1I
(8.10)
³e change in the input and output impedances can not be investigated at this level: it is necessary to specify the nature (voltage
or current) of the input and output quantities. Discussion of these properties of feedback systems is found in Section 8.3.

8.1. BASIC FEEDBACK CONCEPTS
585
thus the variation of the overall ampliﬁer gain, Af , is reduced by a factor of the return ratio.
Example 8.1
A feedback ampliﬁer is constructed with an ampliﬁer that is subject to a 3% variation in gain as its
fundamental forward-gain element. It is desired that the feedback ampliﬁer have no more than
0.1% variation in its overall gain due to the variation in this element. Determine the necessary
return diﬀerence to achieve this design goal.

A feedback ampliﬁer is constructed with an ampliﬁer with nominal gain, A D 100, that is subject

ampliﬁer have no more than 1% variation in its overall gain due to the variation in this element.
Determine the necessary return diﬀerence to achieve this design goal.
Solution:
is problem statement is a duplicate of Example 8.1 with the variation increased by a
factor of 10. Use of Equation (8.9) will produce the same results (D D 30). e large variation,
however, requires the use of Equation (8.13)

or

Good design practice indicates that both inequalities should be satisﬁed. us,
D D .1 C A1f / D .1 C 100f0:4143g/ D 42:43;
and
DdB D 20 log10 D D 32:55 dB:
is result is about 3 dB more than predicted using the methods in Example 8.1.
4. Non-linear signal distortion is reduced. Stabilization of gain with parameter variation suggests
that the gain will be stabilized with respect to other gain-changing eﬀects. One such eﬀect
is non-linear distortion: this type of distortion is a variation of the gain with respect to
input signal amplitude. A simple example of non-linear distortion is shown in Figure 8.2.
Here the transfer characteristic of a simple ampliﬁer is approximated by two regions, each of
which is characterized by diﬀerent ampliﬁcation, A1 and A2. To this transfer characteristic,
a small amount of feedback is applied so that A1f D 1, and the resultant feedback transfer
characteristic is also shown.
As can be easily seen, the overall feedback transfer characteristic also consists of two regions
with overall ampliﬁcation A1f and A2f . In this demonstration, the ampliﬁcation ratios are:
A1

and
A1f

Feedback has signiﬁcantly improved the linearity of the system and reduced non-linear
distortion. Larger amounts of feedback (increasing the feedback ratio, f ) will continue to

improve the linearity. For this example, increasing the feedback ratio by a factor of 5 will
result in a ratio of overall gain in the two regions of 1.067 (as compared to 1.5, above).
It should be noted that the saturation level of an ampliﬁer is not signiﬁcantly altered by the
introduction of negative feedback. Since the incremental gain in saturation is essentially
zero, the feedback diﬀerence is also zero. No signiﬁcant change to the input occurs and the
output remains saturated.
Another possible viewpoint on gain stabilization comes from another form of the basic
feedback equation:

For large return diﬀerence .D D 1 C Af / the overall gain with feedback is dominated by
the feedback ratio, f .
5. e midband frequency range is increased. While this property is discussed extensively in
Chapter 11 (Book 3), it can be considered a special case of the reduction in gain variation.
As frequencies increase, the performance parameters of an ampliﬁer degrade. Similarly,
coupling and bypass capacitors will degrade low-frequency performance. Feedback reduces
the eﬀects of these frequency-dependent degradations and thereby increases the frequency
band over which the ampliﬁer has stable gain.

FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER TOPOLOGIES
As has been seen in the previous section, general discussions provide great insight into many of the
properties of feedback systems. In order to consider the design of electronic feedback ampliﬁers,
it is necessary, however, to specify the details of the feedback sampling and mixing processes
and the circuits necessary to accomplish these operations. e sampling and mixing processes
have a profound eﬀect on the input impedance, the output impedance, and the deﬁnition of the
forward gain quantity that undergoes quantiﬁed change due to the application of feedback.⁴ is
section will analyze the various idealized feedback conﬁgurations: Section 8.3 will look at practical
feedback conﬁgurations.
As has been previously stated, both the mixing and the sampling process for a feedback
ampliﬁer can utilize either voltages or currents. Voltage mixing (subtraction) implies a series con-
nection of voltages at the input of the ampliﬁer: current mixing implies a shunt connection. Volt-
age sampling implies a shunt connection of the sampling probes across the output voltage: current
sampling implies a series connection so that the output current ﬂows into the sampling network.
Either type of mixing can be combined with either type of sampling. us, a feedback ampli-
ﬁer may have one of four possible combinations of the mixing and sampling processes. ese
four combinations are commonly identiﬁed by a hyphenated term: (mixing topology)-(sampling
topology). e four types are:
• shunt-shunt feedback (current mixing & voltage sampling)
• shunt-series feedback (current mixing & current sampling)
• series-shunt feedback (voltage mixing & voltage sampling)
• series-series feedback (voltage mixing & current sampling)
e four basic feedback ampliﬁer topologies are shown schematically in Figure 8.3. A source
and a load resistance have been attached to model complete operation. In each diagram the input,
feedback and output quantities are shown properly as voltages or currents. Forward gain, A, must
be deﬁned as the ratio of the output sampled quantity divided by the input quantity that under-
goes mixing. As such it is a transresistance, current gain, voltage gain, or transconductance. e
feedback network, as described by the feedback ratio .f /, must sample the output quantity and
present a quantity to the mixer that is of the same type (current or voltage) as the input quantity.
As such it is a transconductance, current gain, voltage gain, or transresistance. Table 8.1 is listing
of the appropriate quantities mixed at the input, the output sampled quantity, the forward gain,
and the feedback ratio for each of the four feedback ampliﬁer topologies. It is important to re-
member that the product, Af , must be dimensionless and, in the midband region of operation,
positive.
⁴For any gain topology, all forward gain quantities may undergo change: the gain quantity listed in Table 8.1 is the single
quantity that is altered as described by the basic feedback equation (Equation (8.5)).

using the techniques outlined in this, and following, chapters. Examples of such resistors
will be found in the next section of this chapter.

e sampling process alters the output impedance of the feedback ampliﬁer. Here shunt sam-
pling decreases the output resistance and series sampling increases the output resistance.
1. Shunt sampling decreases the output resistance. For the shunt-shunt feedback ampliﬁer of Fig-
ure 8.4, the output resistance is measured by applying a voltage source of value, v, to the
output terminals with the input, ii, set to zero value. A simpliﬁed schematic representation
of that measurement is shown in Figure 8.6. In this ﬁgure, the forward-gain ampliﬁer has

PRACTICAL FEEDBACK CONFIGURATIONS
Previous discussions of feedback and feedback conﬁgurations have been limited to idealized sys-
tems and ampliﬁers. e four idealized feedback schematic diagrams of Figure 8.3 identify the
forward-gain ampliﬁer and the feedback network as two-port networks with a very speciﬁc prop-
erty: each is a device with one-way gain. Realistic electronic feedback ampliﬁers can only approx-
imate that idealized behavior. In addition, in practical feedback ampliﬁers there is always some
interaction between the forward-gain ampliﬁer and the feedback network. is interaction most
often takes the form of input and output resistive loading of the forward-gain ampliﬁer. e di-
vision of the practical feedback ampliﬁer into its forward-gain ampliﬁer and feedback network
is also not always obvious. ese apparent obstacles to using idealized feedback analysis can be
resolved through the use of two-port network relationships in the derivation of practical feed-
back ampliﬁer properties. Once ampliﬁer gain and impedance relationships have been derived,
the utility of the two-port representations becomes minimal and is typically discarded.
Feedback topology is determined through careful observation of the interconnection of the
feedback network and forward-gain ampliﬁer. Shunt mixing occurs at the input terminal of the
ampliﬁer. us, shunt mixing is identiﬁed by a connection of feedback network and the forward-
gain ampliﬁer at the input terminal of ﬁrst active device within the ampliﬁer, that is:
⁵Series mixing feedback ampliﬁers that have resistors shunting the input require special care in the application of these formulas.
Also, feedback ampliﬁers with series sampling and loads that shunt the output require similar care. See Section 8.3 for examples
of proper calculations.

8.3. PRACTICAL FEEDBACK CONFIGURATIONS

• at the base of a BJT for a common-emitter or common-collector ﬁrst stage,
• at the emitter of a BJT for a common-base ﬁrst stage,
• at the gate of a FET for a common-source or common-drain ﬁrst stage, or
• at the source of a FET for a common-gate ﬁrst stage.
Series mixing occurs in a loop that contains the input terminal of the forward-gain ampliﬁer
and the controlling port of the ﬁrst active device. e controlling port of a BJT in the forward-
active region is the base-emitter junction: a FET in the saturation region is controlled by the
voltage across the gate-source input port. Series mixing is characterized by a circuit element which
is both connected to the output and in series with the input voltage and the input port of the ﬁrst
active device.
Identiﬁcation of the sampling is derived from direct observation of the connection of the
output of the basic forward ampliﬁer and the feedback network. Shunt sampling is typically char-
acterized by a direct connection of the feedback network to the output node: series sampling im-
plies a series connection of the ampliﬁer output, the feedback network, and the load. Two tests
performed at the feedback ampliﬁer output can aid in the determination of sampling topology:
• If the feedback quantity vanishes for a short-circuit load, the output voltage must be the
sampled quantity. us, zero feedback for a short-circuit load implies shunt sampling.
• If the feedback quantity vanishes for an open-circuit load, the output current must be the
sampled quantity. us, zero feedback for a open-circuit load implies series sampling.
After the topological type has been identiﬁed, each ampliﬁer must be transformed into a
form that allows for the use of the idealized feedback formulations. is transformation includes
modeling the ampliﬁer and the feedback network with a particular two-port representation that
facilitates combination of elements. Once the transformations are accomplished, the ampliﬁer
performance parameters are easily obtained using the methods previously outlined in this Chap-
ter. e particular operations necessary to transform each of the four feedback ampliﬁer topo-
logical types require separate discussion. e examples in this section demonstrate the typical
interconnection of a basic forward ampliﬁer and a feedback network for each feedback topol-
ogy. While BJT ampliﬁers form the examples of this section, the general approach applies to all
feedback ampliﬁers regardless of active device type.
8.3.1
SHUNT-SHUNT FEEDBACK
Figure 8.8 shows the small-signal model of a typical shunt-shunt feedback ampliﬁer. In this rep-
resentation, the forward-gain ampliﬁer and the feedback network have been replaced by their
equivalent y-parameter two-port network representations so that parallel parameters can be easily
combined. A resistive load has been applied to the output port; and, since shunt-shunt feedback

ampliﬁers are transresistance ampliﬁers, a Norton equivalent source has been shown as the input.
It should also be noted that the forward-gain parameter of each two-port, y21, is the transadmit-
tance.

e basic feedback equation for a transresistance ampliﬁer takes the form:
RMf D
RM
1 C RM f :
(8.35)
e application of the basic feedback equation to this circuit in its current form is not immediately
clear. It is necessary to transform the feedback ampliﬁer circuit into a form that allows for easy
application of the basic feedback equation, Equation (8.35). Such a transformation must meet
the previously stated feedback requirements:
• e forward-gain ampliﬁer is to be a forward transmission system only—its reverse trans-
mission must be negligible.
• e feedback network is to be a reverse transmission system that presents a feedback current,
dependent on the output voltage, to the ampliﬁer input port.
While a mathematically rigorous derivation of the transformation is possible, greater insight to
the process comes with a heuristic approach.
e two-port y-parameter representation, in conjunction with the shunt-shunt connection,
is used to describe the two main elements of this feedback ampliﬁer so that all the input port
elements of both two-port networks are in parallel. Similarly, all output port elements are in
parallel. It is well known that circuit elements in parallel may be rearranged and, so long as they
remain in parallel, the circuit continues to function in an identical fashion. Hence, it is possible,
for analysis purposes only, to conceptually move elements from one section of the circuit into another

8.3. PRACTICAL FEEDBACK CONFIGURATIONS
597
(from the feedback circuit to the ampliﬁer circuit or the reverse). e necessary conceptual changes
made for the transformation are:
• e source resistance, the load resistance, and all input and output admittances, y11 and
y22, are placed in the modiﬁed ampliﬁer circuit,⁶
• All forward transadmittances, y21, (represented by current sources dependent on the input
voltage, v1) are placed in the modiﬁed ampliﬁer circuit, and
• All reverse transadmittances, y12, (represented by current sources dependent on the output
voltage, vo) are placed in the modiﬁed feedback circuit.
e dependent current source can be easily combined:

and
yt

(8.37)
In virtually every practical feedback ampliﬁer the reverse transadmittance of the forward-gain
ampliﬁer is much smaller than that of the feedback network (ya
12  yf
12) and the forward
transadmittance of the feedback network is much smaller than that of the forward-gain ampliﬁer
(yf
21  ya
21). us, approximate simpliﬁcations of the ampliﬁer representation can be made:

and

(8.39)
e shunt-shunt feedback ampliﬁer circuit of Figure 8.8 is, with these changes and approxima-
tions, thereby transformed into the circuit shown in Figure 8.9.
is transformed circuit is composed of two simple elements:
• e original ampliﬁer with its input shunted by the source resistance and the feedback
network short-circuit input admittance, yf
11, and its output shunted by the load resistance
and the feedback network short-circuit output admittance, yf
22.
• A feedback network composed solely of the feedback network reverse transadmittance, yf
12.
⁶Inclusion of the source and load resistance in the ampliﬁer seems, at ﬁrst, counterproductive. It is necessary, however, to
include these resistances so that the use of the feedback properties produces correct results for input and output resistance
(after appropriate transformations).

Solution::
is ampliﬁer has typical shunt-shunt topology with a simple resistor as the feedback net-
work. is resistor is directly connected to the base of the input of a common-emitter ampliﬁer:
this connection signiﬁes shunt mixing. Similarly, the direct connection to the output node sig-
niﬁes shunt sampling (if the load is replaced by a short circuit, the feedback goes to zero). As
outlined above, analysis of feedback ampliﬁers follows a distinct procedure:
DC Analysis:
As in all ampliﬁer designs, the DC quiescent conditions must be determined so that the BJT
h-parameters can be determined. e primary equation of interest for this ampliﬁer is a loop
equation passing through the DC source and the BJT base-emitter junction:

Partition the Circuit into its Functional Modules:
e AC equivalent ampliﬁer circuit must be partitioned into its basic functional modules so that
analysis can proceed. In addition a Norton equivalent of the source must be made so that the
source resistance shunts the input. e functional modules necessary are: the basic forward am-
pliﬁer, the feedback network, and the source. e load resistance and the output resistance of the
source must be included in the basic forward ampliﬁer module.

It is helpful to reiterate the procedure for ﬁnding the performance parameters of a feedback
ampliﬁer. In order to ﬁnd the feedback ampliﬁer performance parameters, the following procedure
is followed:
• Perform a DC analysis to obtain active device performance parameters
• Draw an AC equivalent circuit of the entire circuit
• Partition the circuit into its functional modules
• Load the Basic Forward Ampliﬁer
• Determine the Performance of the Loaded Forward Ampliﬁer.
• Apply the Feedback Relationships to Obtain Total Circuit Performance
• If necessary, transform these performance parameters into equivalent performance param-
eters as speciﬁed.
is procedure can be followed with all four feedback topologies in the same manner as
has been shown in Example 8.3. e speciﬁcs of loading the basic forward ampliﬁer and the
application of the feedback formulas will vary according to the topology.
8.3.2
SHUNT-SERIES FEEDBACK
Figure 8.10 shows the small-signal model of a typical shunt-series feedback ampliﬁer. In this
representation, the forward-gain ampliﬁer and the feedback network have been replaced by their
equivalent g-parameter two-port network representations so that input and output parameters
can be easily combined. A resistive load has been applied to the output port; and, since shunt-
series feedback ampliﬁers are current ampliﬁers, a Norton equivalent source has been shown as
the input. e forward-gain parameter of each two-port, g21, is the voltage gain.
e basic feedback equation for a current ampliﬁer takes the form:

Once again, it is necessary to transform the feedback ampliﬁer circuit into a form that allows
for easy application of the basic feedback equation, Equation (8.43). Such a transformation must
meet the previously stated feedback requirements:
• e forward-gain ampliﬁer is to be a forward transmission system only—its reverse trans-
mission must be negligible.
• e feedback network is to be a reverse transmission system that presents a feedback current,
dependent on the output voltage, to the ampliﬁer input port.
e two-port g-parameter representation, in conjunction with the shunt-series connection,
is used to describe the two main elements of this feedback ampliﬁer so that all the input port
elements of both two-port networks are in parallel. In contrast, all output port elements are in
series. For analysis purposes only, elements are conceptually moved elements from one section of
the circuit into another (from the feedback circuit to the ampliﬁer circuit or the reverse). e
necessary conceptual changes made for the transformation are:
• e source resistance; all input admittances .g11/, and output impedances .g22/, are placed
in the modiﬁed ampliﬁer circuit. e load resistance is kept separate.
• All forward voltage gains .g21/ (represented by voltage sources dependent on the input
voltage, v1) are placed in the modiﬁed ampliﬁer circuit, and

• All reverse current gains .g12/ (represented by current sources dependent on the output
current, io) are placed in the modiﬁed feedback circuit.

e shunt-series feedback ampliﬁer circuit of Figure 8.10 is, with these changes and approxima-
tions, thereby transformed into the circuit shown in Figure 8.11.
is transformed circuit is composed of two simple elements:
• e original ampliﬁer with its input shunted by the source resistance and the feedback net-
work open-circuit input admittance, gf
11, and its output in series with the feedback network
short-circuit output admittance, gf
22 and the load resistance.
• A feedback network composed solely of the feedback network reverse transadmittance, gf
12.
As in the other case of shunt mixing, it is important to notice that the input resistance, Rif, of
this circuit includes the source resistance, Rs: as such it is not the same as the input resistance of the
true ampliﬁer, Rin. e input resistance of the true ampliﬁer can be obtained as:

when the input port of the feedback network, vi, is set to zero value.

As in Example 8.3, the direct connection of the feedback network to the base of the input

the output BJT, whereas the output is at the collector. Simple shorting of the output voltage has
no eﬀect on the feedback, while opening the collector of the output BJT eliminates all feedback:
the sampling topology must be series sampling.
DC Analysis:
As in all ampliﬁer designs, the DC quiescent conditions must be determined so that the BJT

Solution::
In this circuit the feedback network is connected at the emitter of the input BJT. Feedback
in the form of a voltage will appear here in series with a évenin source and the base-emitter
junction of the BJT: this is series mixing. e direct connection of the feedback network to the
output node implies shunt sampling (replacing the load with a short eliminates all feedback).
DC Analysis:
e DC portion of this circuit is identical to that of Example 8.4. e only changes have been in
the feedback (which is capacitively coupled) and the resistors bypassed by capacitors. us, the
DC quiescent conditions of the BJTs remain unchanged. e h-parameters are also the same as
in Example 8.4:

Partition the Circuit into its Functional Modules:
e AC equivalent ampliﬁer circuit must be partitioned into its basic functional modules so that
analysis can proceed. e functional modules necessary are: the basic forward ampliﬁer, the feed-
back network, and the source. Of particular interest is that the bias resistors at the input of the
ﬁrst BJT must be partitioned within the source. is partitioning is due to the requirement of
series mixing that items at the input must be in series. e load resistance is included in the basic
forward ampliﬁer module.

the determination of these two-port parameters, the circuit has been transformed into a form
that is compatible with all previous discussions. e forward-gain parameter (in this case, GM)

• rout D zf
22 is found by setting the input current to zero value, i1 D 0 and determining the

the input current of the feedback network, i1, is set to zero value.

Solution::
In this circuit, the feedback network is connected to the base of the input BJT, but the
input is at the emitter. Again, feedback will appear in series with the input and the base-emitter
junction of the BJT: this is series mixing. e connection of the feedback network at the out-
put characterizes series sampling (opening both load resistors at the collector of the output BJT
eliminated all feedback).
DC Analysis:
As in all ampliﬁer designs, the DC quiescent conditions must be determined so that the BJT
h-parameters can be determined. After setting all capacitors to open circuits, the usual analysis
techniques lead to:

e ampliﬁer is partitioned into its two functional modules. Series mixing implies the need for a
évenin source. Since there is series mixing at both input and output port, the source and load
resistances are excluded from the basic forward ampliﬁer.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e fundamental advantages of the use of feedback in electronic ampliﬁers have been described in
this chapter. Reduction in non-linear distortion, variation in ampliﬁer performance parameters,
and control of input and out impedance are all signiﬁcant beneﬁts available through the use of
feedback.
e analysis of feedback ampliﬁers can be a complex process complicated by the interaction
of the basic forward ampliﬁer and the feedback network. It is, however, possible to simplify this
analysis process through the use of a few basic feedback relationships and a systematic analysis
method. is analysis method consists of a seven step process:
• Identify the Feedback Topology
• Perform a DC Analysis to Obtain Active Device Performance Parameters
• Partition the AC Equivalent Circuit into its Functional Modules
• Load the Basic Forward Ampliﬁer
• Determine the Performance of the Loaded Forward Ampliﬁer
• Apply the Feedback Relationships to Obtain Total Circuit Performance
• If Necessary, Transform these Performance Parameters into Equivalent Performance Pa-
rameters as Speciﬁed.
Vital to the analysis method are the partitioning of the circuit into its functional modules
and loading the basic forward ampliﬁer. Table 8.3 serves as an aid in that process, itemizing the
process variation due to feedback topology.
Another signiﬁcant beneﬁt of feedback, the increase in the midband frequency range, will
be extensively discussed in Chapter 11 (Book 3).
Summary Design Example
e design process often involves the modiﬁcation of an existing design to meet new, but similar,
performance speciﬁcations. As an example, the feedback ampliﬁer shown below constructed with
enhancement-mode FETs with the following properties:
K D 1 mA=V
VT D 1:5 V

eﬀects of loading due to the feedback network.
Resistance: Resistance: the resistance modiﬁed at shunted ports will include all shunting resistances that were
included in the basic forward ampliﬁer. e resistance modiﬁed at series ports will only include the resistances
included in the basic forward ampliﬁer. e true ampliﬁer input and output impedance must be modiﬁed to

e quiescent conditions for the transistors are known to be:

ID2 D 2:47 mA:
It is desired to design an ampliﬁer with similar input and output resistance and a midband voltage
gain of 15. Redesign the ampliﬁer to meet the new design goals.
Solution:
If at all possible, a redesign process should minimize the number of changes. For the given
ampliﬁer, the FET AC parameters will remain the same if the quiescent drain currents are not
changed. us, it seems advantageous to retain the same Q-poing. is proposed redesign con-
straint limits changes to the feedback resistor .10 k/ and the load resistor .4:7 k/. While vari-
ation in either will alter the maximum symmetrical output swing, voltage gain is more strongly
dependent on the feedback resistor: less variation in quiescent output voltage will result in chang-
ing the feedback resistor. It is therefore decided to alter only the feedback resistor to accomplish the
new design goals.
is ampliﬁer is a series-shunt feedback ampliﬁer: the gain parameter that is stabilized is the
voltage gain from the input port to the output port. In order to meet the new design goals the gain
with feedback must be (the input resistance of this ampliﬁer simply is the parallel combination of
the bias resistors and does not change with variation in feedback):

curacy of the result. A mathematical search provides Rf D 7:882 k. One reasonable set of ap-
proximations are shown below.
In the expression for Av, the parallel combination of Rf with 470  is unlikely to change
