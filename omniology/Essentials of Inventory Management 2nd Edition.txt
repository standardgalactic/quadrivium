When I wrote the first edition of Essentials of Inventory Man-
agement my objective was to present, in accessible language sup-
ported by copious illustrations and examples, timeless inventory
management concepts and techniques.  My purpose was to give the
reader a fundamental understanding of inventory as it exists in the
physical world (shelf count), and as an intangible item (record
count)  existing in a computer database  and/or on paper. 
The basic principles covered in that edition are as relevant today,
even with the explosion of Internet-based e-commerce solutions to
many inventory and materials management issues, as when they
were first written.
I am pleased to note that the book was successful.  It has been
translated into Spanish, with distribution in a number of Spanish-
speaking countries, and, an English-language soft cover edition is
being distributed in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and
Bangladesh. AMACOM Books and I have received excellent re-
sponses to the first edition from individuals just beginning their ca-
reers in fields related to inventory management, as well as from
experienced materials managers who reported that the book re-
minded them of effective techniques they had known but had for-
gotten over the years.
Over the past several years, as I have continued to lecture and
consult, it became apparent that the book could be enhanced by
adding chapters and sections on subjects such as cycle counting,
enterprise resource planning, and supply chain management.  And
so, this second edition was born.
The second edition retains the timeless, essential inventory
management basics that are the hallmarks of the first edition, with
new and expanded information that includes:
Introduction to the Second Edition

  An expansion of Chapter 2, “Inventory as Money,” to
include a section dealing with profit margins and
merchandising metrics and containing both examples
and formulae related to merchandising.
  A renamed Chapter 4, “Automated Inventory
Identification Systems,” with new material on Radio
Frequency Identification Systems (RFID) that discusses
the strengths and challenges associated with this
technology.
  New coverage in Chapter 5, “Planning and
Replenishment Concepts,” of the benefits of enterprise
resource planning (ERP), including the five main reasons
why an enterprise should consider incorporating this
concept into its organization.
  A revised and expanded Chapter 6, “Why Inventory
Systems Fail and How to Fix Them,” which includes new
material regarding how to distinguish A-B-C cycle
counting analysis using a single factor from approaches
combining multiple factors (e.g., dollar value and usage
rate). The chapter now explains in detail how to
undertake an A-B-C cycle counting analysis by
combining multiple factors. 
  A new Chapter 7, “Basics of Supply Chain Risk
Management,” reveals how the very techniques that have
allowed American businesses to slash operating costs and
inventories by embracing just-in-time and lean
manufacturing techniques have made them vulnerable to
a number of serious supply chain risks. It offers
suggestions regarding steps organizations should take in
trying to balance the risks and rewards of SCM, and
xii
Introduction to the Second Edition

provides a starting point to any supply chain risk
management effort. 
And, of course, as it has since the first edition, the book intro-
duces the new stockroom/warehouse manager, the nonfinancial
inventory control individual, and the small business owner to the
fundamental nature of inventory from financial, physical, forecast-
ing, and operational standpoints. In addition, it explains in easily
understandable terms the concepts underlying automated identi-
fication of product through both bar coding and RFID.
The ultimate goal of this book is to present immediately usable
information in the areas of forecasting, physical control and layout,
problem recognition, and resolution, as well as how to begin to bet-
ter manage a supply chain.
Ultimately, Essentials of Inventory Management will enable you
to:
  Understand that modern practice discourages holding
large quantities of inventory and encourages only having
amounts on hand required for current needs.
  Grasp the signific ance of controlling actual, on-hand
inventory as both a physical object (shelf count) and as
an intangible object (record count and monetary worth).
  Appreciate the fundamental differences between finished
goods inventories in the retail/distribution sectors and
raw materials and work-in-process inventories found in
the manufacturing environment.
  Apply basic formulae to calculating inventory quantities.
  Utilize basic formulae to compute breakeven points,
profit margins, markups and markdowns, as well as
selling price and margin percentages. 
xiii
Introduction to the Second Edition

  Select the cycle counting inventory method that is right
for you.
  Undertake an A-B-C cycle counting analysis by
combining multiple factors.
  Recognize and analyze dysfunctions within your own
operation.
  Employ basic problem-solving techniques to issue
resolution.
  Control the physical location of inventory in a more
efficient manner.
  Analyze whether or not RFID is right for your
organization.
  Be aware of supply chain management risks and possible
solutions.

INVENTORY AS BOTH A TANGIBLE
AND AN INTANGIBLE OBJECT
T
he objective of this chapter is to provide you with a basic un-
derstanding of the nature of inventory as both a tangible,
physical item actually kept within the facility (“real life” or “shelf
count”) and as an intangible item existing within the company’s
records (“paper life” or “record count”). Since you frequently make
purchasing, sales, customer service, production planning, and
other decisions based on whether an item is shown as being in-
house as per your records, an item’s paper life can be just as impor-
tant as its real life.
Inventory—Who Needs It?
All organizations keep inventory. “Inventory” includes a company’s
raw materials, work in process, supplies used in operations, and
finished goods.
Inventory can be as simple as a bottle of glass cleaner used as
part of a building’s custodial program or as complex as a mix of
raw materials and subassemblies used as part of a manufacturing
process.

INVENTORY COSTS
Inventory brings with it a number of costs, including:
  Dollars
  Space
  Labor to receive, check quality, put away, retrieve, select,
pack, ship, and account for the item(s) 
  Deterioration, damage, and obsolescence
  Theft
Inventory costs generally fall into ordering costs and holding
costs. Ordering, or acquisition, costs come about regardless of the
actual value of the goods. These costs include the salaries of those
purchasing the product, costs of expediting the inventory, and so
on. For a complete discussion of ordering costs, see Chapter 5,
Planning and Replenishment Concepts. For a complete discussion
of carrying costs, see Chapter 2, Inventory as Money.
As discussed in Chapter 2, holding costs include the cost of
capital tied up in inventory (the opportunity cost of money1); stor-
age costs such as rent; and costs of handling the product such as
equipment, warehouse and stock-keeping staff, stock losses/
wastage, taxes, and so on.
As discussed in Chapter 5, acquisition/ordering costs come
about regardless of the actual value of the goods. These costs in-
clude the salaries of those purchasing the product, costs of expe-
diting the inventory, and so on.
THE PURPOSE OF INVENTORY
So why do you need inventory? In a just-in-time manufacturing
environment, inventory is considered waste. However, in environ-
ments where an organization suffers from poor cash flow or lacks
strong control over (1) electronic information transfer among all
2
Essentials of Inventory Management

departments and all significant suppliers, (2) lead times, and (3)
quality of materials received, inventory plays important roles.
Some of the more important reasons for obtaining and holding
inventory are:
  Predictability: To engage in capacity planning and produc-
tion scheduling, you need to control how much raw ma-
terial and how many parts and subassemblies you process
at a given time. Inventory buffers what you need from
what you process.
  Fluctuations in demand: A supply of inventory on hand is
protection. You don’t always know how much you are
likely to need at any given time, but you still need to sat-
isfy customer or production demand on time. If you can
see how customers are acting in the supply chain, sur-
prises in fluctuations in demand are held to a minimum.
  Unreliability of supply: Inventory protects you from unre-
liable suppliers or when an item is scarce and a steady
supply is difficult to ensure. Whenever possible, unreli-
able suppliers should be rehabilitated through discus-
sions or replaced. Rehabilitation can be accomplished
through master purchase orders with timed product re-
leases, price or term penalties for nonperformance, better
verbal and electronic communications between the par-
ties, and so on. This will lower your on-hand inventory
needs.
  Price protection: Buying quantities of inventory at appro-
priate times helps avoid the impact of cost inflation. Note
that contracting to assure a price does not require actu-
ally taking delivery at the time of purchase. Many sup-
pliers prefer to deliver periodically rather than to ship an
3

entire year’s supply of a particular stock keeping unit
(SKU) at one time. (Note: The acronym “SKU” is a com-
mon term in the inventory world. It generally stands for
a specific numeric or alpha-numeric identifier for a spe-
cific item.)
  Quantity discounts: Often bulk discounts are available if
you buy in large rather than in small quantities.
  Lower ordering costs: If you buy a larger quantity of an item
less frequently, the ordering costs are less than buying
smaller quantities over and over again. (The costs of
holding the item for a longer period of time, however,
will be greater.) See Chapter 5, Planning and Replenish-
ment Concepts. To hold down ordering costs and to lock
in favorable pricing, many organizations issue blanket
purchase orders coupled with periodic release and receiv-
ing dates of the SKUs.
TYPES OF STOCK
Inventory is basically divided into raw materials, finished goods,
and work-in-process. Remember:
  Raw materials: Used to produce partial products or com-
pleted goods.
  Finished product: This is product ready for current cus-
tomer sales. It can also be used to buffer manufacturing
from predictable or unpredictable market demand. In
other words, a manufacturing company can make up a
supply of toys during the year for predictably higher sales
during the holiday season.
  Work-in-process (WIP): Items are considered to be WIP
during the time raw material is being converted into par-
4
Essentials of Inventory Management

tial product, subassemblies, and finished product. WIP
should be kept to a minimum. WIP occurs because of
such things as work delays, long movement times be-
tween operations, and queuing bottlenecks.
Other categories of inventory should be considered from a
functional standpoint:
  Consumables: Light bulbs, hand towels, computer and
photocopying paper, brochures, tape, envelopes, cleaning
materials, lubricants, fertilizer, paint, dunnage (packing
materials), and so on are used in many operations. These
are often treated like raw materials.
  Service, repair, replacement, and spare items (S&R items):
These are after-market items used to “keep things going.”
As long as a machine or device of some type is being used
(in the market) and will need service and repair in the
future, it will never be obsolete. S&R items should not be
treated like finished goods for purposes of forecasting the
quantity level of your normal stock.
  Quantity levels of S&R items will be based on such con-
siderations as preventive maintenance schedules, pre-
dicted failure rates, and dates of various items of
equipment. For example, if an organization replaced its
fluorescent tubes on an as-needed, on-failure basis, it
would need a larger supply of these lights on hand at all
times. However, if the same company relamped all of its
ballasts once a year, it would buy a large quantity of tubes
at one time and only keep a small supply on hand on an
ongoing basis.
  Because S&R items are never “obsolete” or “dead” until
the equipment or device they are to be used for is no
5
Inventory as Both a Tangible and an Intangible Object

longer in service, these items should not be included in
calculating dead stock levels. See Chapter 2.
  Buffer/safety inventory: This type of inventory can serve
various purposes, such as:
 Compensating for demand and supply uncertainties.
 “Decoupling” and separating different parts of your
operation so that they can function independently from
one another. See Exhibit 1–1.
  Anticipation Stock: This is inventory produced in anticipa-
tion of an upcoming season, such as fancy chocolates for
Mother’s Day or Valentine’s Day. Failure to sell in the an-
ticipated period could be disastrous, because you may be
left with considerable amounts of stock past its perceived
shelf life.
  Transit inventory: This is inventory en route from one place
to another. It could be argued that product moving within
a facility is transit inventory, but the common meaning
refers to items moving within the distribution channel to-
ward you, items outside of your facility, or items en route
from your facility to the customer.
Transit stock highlights the need to understand not only how
inventory physically moves through your system, but also how and
when it shows up in your records. If, for example, 500 widgets ap-
peared as part of existing stock while they were still en route to
you, your record count would include them, but your shelf count
would be 500 widgets short.
How could stock show up as part of inventory before it actually
arrives? The answer depends on when title to the widgets trans-
ferred to you. Did title transfer when the product left the shipper’s
dock, or did it transfer only after the items arrived at your site and

were signed for? If title transferred when the product left the ship-
per’s dock, it was then counted as part of your total inventory. As
a result, your total record count would not match your shelf count.
For example, if (a) a stockkeeper did not understand that an item’s
paper life had floated ahead of its real life and (b) the stockkeeper
did not have a breakdown of items on hand, on order, in transit,
and immediately available, (c) the stockkeeper would find a mis-
match between the shelf and record counts. Inappropriate adjust-
ments might then be made.
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs the transfer
of title to product. The UCC has been adopted by most states. Ar-
ticle 2 of the UCC covers the sale of goods.
Tracking the Paper Life
To gain an understanding of the relationship between an item’s
real life and its paper life, follow a single item on its path through
your system. In other words, track an item’s physical movement
through your facility while noting what is happening to its paper
life during that same time period. You will be able to discover when
one of these lives moves ahead of the other and when there are sys-
tem errors, such as an item is moved but no paperwork exists au-
thorizing that action.
Exhibit 1–2 provides an example of what could happen if an
item’s paper life and real life begin to leapfrog ahead or behind one
another without the stockkeeper understanding the process.
As can be seen in Exhibit 1–2, an item’s real life and paper life
can leapfrog around one another. It is important to understand
that these lives can exist independently of one another. To com-
prehend your own system, you must trace how both product and
information move through the system. See Exhibit 1–3 for a simple

Inventory as Both a Tangible and an Intangible Object
Exhibit 1–2 Real Life and Paper Life Leap Frog
Carr Enterprises operates six days per week, Monday
through Saturday. It has an inventory system that is up-
dated at 4:45 P.M. every day. In spite of the daily updating,
the record count and the shelf count in Small Stock Room
#1 are often out of balance.
Carr’s warehouse manager, Nate, has decided to count
everything in Small Stock Room #1 every Friday. He does so
for two months. At the end of that time he is angry—the
numbers still don’t match. 
Carr hires Shawn, an ace inventory detective, to help track
down the source of the problem. Nate is flabbergasted. He
believes he is counting very carefully, and if there is a prob-
lem, it is with the computer. Nate declares to anyone who will
listen that “the computer is always wrong.”
On Monday at 5:15 P.M., Shawn suggests that they exam-
ine an item that seems to be out of balance from the previous
week’s count.
Nate declares, “I’ll show you one.” Thrusting a brand new
inventory Stock Status Report in front of Shawn’s nose, Nate
states, “Look at these widgets. It says there are 12 of them in
stock. When we counted them last week there were 12 of them.
I looked at this report this morning, and it said there were 13
of them. Now it says there are 12 of them, but I just looked in
the stock room and there are actually 15 of them. See, I told
you—the computer’s always wrong.”
Shawn asks if he can see Nate’s count sheet with the widg-
ets on it from the previous week. The sheet looks like this:
(continues)

Essentials of Inventory Management
Shawn asks what the notations mean.
Nate replies that when the wrong quantity was on the
count sheet, he would “X” it out, write in the correct quantity,
and turn the sheet into data entry. 
Shawn asked when Nate turned his sheets in. Nate replied,
“Friday—why?” 
Shawn said, “I understand that you turn the sheets in on
Friday. I’m asking, what time do you turn them in?” Nate says
he does it at about 5 P.M. Thinking Shawn is criticizing him,
Nate defensively states, “Hey, they’re busy in data entry from
4:30 or so. They’re doing cutoff and updates and stuff like
that. So I wait until they’re done.” 
Shawn asks when Nate’s count sheets are keyed into the sys-
tem. Nate says he doesn’t know. Shawn asks Hillary, the data
entry clerk, when Nate’s sheets are keyed in. Hillary replies that
she doesn’t put Nate’s work on the front burner, “if you know
what I mean.” Shawn persists. He asks again, “Who keys Nate’s
count sheets in and when are they done?” Hillary replies that she
works on Saturday but leaves the sheets for Carolyn, the other
data entry clerk, to input on Monday. 
Shawn asks Hillary if she entered any widgets into the system
on Saturday. She says she entered three of them into the system
on Saturday. Shawn asks Carolyn how she handles inputting

Nate’s information. She replies that she pulls up the item on her
computer screen, checks to see if the total in the computer
matches Nate’s handwritten amount, and if it doesn’t, she
changes the amount in the system to match Nate’s number. 
Shawn charts-out the flow of real life and paper life for
the widgets, and he comes up with the following:
At the start of business on Friday, the 
system believes there are 10 widgets. 
There are actually 12. Nate does not 
note a plus or minus amount on his 
count sheet. He X’s through the 10 
and writes in 12. He does not turn in 
his count sheets until after the system 
has been updated for that day. At the 
close of business on Friday, the system 
still believes there are 10 widgets. 
There are actually 12.
No one enters Nate’s information on 
Saturday. Nate does not know this—he 
hasn’t checked. Three widgets are 
added into the system on Saturday. At 
the close of business on Saturday, the 
system believes there are 13 widgets in 
stock. There are actually 15.
Monday morning’s Stock Status Report
reflects Saturday’s numbers. During
the day on Monday, Carolyn wipes out
the record of 13 and enters the quantity
of 12 from Nate’s sheets.
When the system is updated at 4:45 P.M. 
on Monday, the stock record and new 
Stock Status Report reflects that there 
are 12 widgets.There are actually 15. 
When Nate began counting on Friday 
the system was off by 2, and when all 
was said and done, it was off by 3! 2

Exhibit 1–3 Tracking the Paper Life
Instructions: At each stage of the flow chart below note:
1. Where is the item physically?
2. What pieces of paper(s) authorize that? 
3. When is information entered into your computer system?
4. Who is supposed to write something down? What are
they supposed to write down? When were they supposed to
write it down? Who are they supposed to give the piece of
paper to? What is that person supposed to do with it? When
are they supposed to pass the piece of paper along? 
5. Does any item change its unit of measure within the
system even though it retains the same physical form. For ex-
ample: Item X is purchased by the master case. When it is en-
tered into the database, a conversion table converts each case

method of breaking down a portion of your system to gain an un-
derstanding of your physical item and database float times.
Electronic Data Interchange
Stockkeepers who do not understand how and when an item’s
paper life is first created within a system become even more con-
fused if there is no hard paper copy audit trail they can follow. How
could:
  An order be placed?
  An order be accepted?
  Confirmation of the order be given?
  Shipping instructions be given?
  Notice of shipping arrangements be given?
  A paper life be created for an item in advance of it
entering the facility?
All occur without any hard paper copies of these transactions.
All of these events and others can occur in a paperless environment
through electronic data interchange.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) is where routine business
transactions are sent over standard communication lines (such as
telephone lines) between computers within a company or between
your computer and that of a vendor.

into the four cartons within the master case. However, for
ease of handling, the cartons remain in the master case for
storage. Visually this item appears as a single unit while it will
be sold or used as four separate items.
6. After the paper chase, where is the item physically?

An example of EDI within a company occurs at the time of
order entry, when information about that order is electronically
transmitted to shipping or operations for order selection and ship-
ping, to accounting for billing purposes, to sales for order verifi-
cation, and so on.
An example of EDI with a vendor occurs when you electroni-
cally place an order directly from your computer into the vendor’s
computer. The vendor’s computer then electronically confirms the
order and transmits information about the order to the vendor’s
shipping and accounting departments. The vendor’s computer also
electronically notifies a carrier of the upcoming shipment. The car-
rier’s computer electronically confirms the pickup and provides the
vendor with pickup and delivery information. The vendor’s com-
puter then notifies your computer of the date, time, etc., of the up-
coming delivery. All of this is accomplished without any human
intervention other than the original placement of the order.
For EDI to work, all of the system participants must agree to
strict rules regarding message content, format, and structure.
Recap
The objective of this chapter was to point out that inventory exists
within your system as both a physical item and as an item in your
records.
There are many reasons for obtaining and holding inventory,
and inventory can play a variety of roles within the life of any or-
ganization.
To control and manage the items coming into, through, and
out of your facility, it is important to understand not only where
an item is physically located at any given time, but also how that
existence is being acknowledged within the system.

Answers
1. (d), 2. (a), 3. (b), 4. (b), 5. (c)
Notes
1. If you have $2 million tied up in inventory, you cannot earn
money (interest) on that money. If you could earn 10 percent
interest on that $2 million, you could earn $200,000. Not being
able to earn this money is an opportunity cost.
2. If you are going to note stock quantity changes but the informa-
tion will not be input before there are intervening inventory
events, you must use a “plus/minus” notation system (e.g., +3;
−4; ±0). By using a plus/minus notation system, the data entry
clerk will add or subtract from the then current amount, which
will already include any intervening events.

INVENTORY AS MONEY
W
hy should you care about the financial aspects of inventory?
Because inventory is money.
Even if you do not have a financial background, it is important
to understand and appreciate that inventory information in finan-
cial statements can be useful in the operation of your business. A
basic understanding of how inventory appears on the balance sheet
and its impact on the income statement and cash flow statement
will improve your ability to have the right item in the right quan-
tity in the right place at the right time.
Accounting for Inventories
The three basic types of inventory are:
1. Raw Materials—raw materials inventory is made up of
goods that will be used in the production of finished
products (e.g., nuts, bolts, flour, sugar).
2. Work in Process—work in process inventory, or WIP, con-
sists of materials entered into the production process but
not yet completed (e.g., subassemblies).

3. Finished Goods—finished goods inventory includes com-
pleted products waiting to be sold (e.g., bar stools, bread,
cookies).
Most inventory fits into one of these general buckets, yet the
amount of each category varies greatly depending on the specifics
of your industry and business. For example, the types of inventory
found in distribution environments are fundamentally different
from those found in manufacturing environments. Distribution
businesses tend to carry mostly finished goods for resale, while
manufacturing companies tend to have less finished goods and
more raw materials and work in progress. Given these differences,
it is natural that the accounting choices vary between distribution
and manufacturing settings. 
How Inventory Is Valued
To assign a cost value to inventory, you must make some assump-
tions about the inventory on hand. Under federal income tax laws,
a company can only make these assumptions once per fiscal year.
Tax treatment is often an organization’s chief concern regarding
inventory valuation. The five common inventory valuation meth-
ods are as follows: 
1. First-in, First-out (FIFO) inventory valuation assumes that the
first goods purchased are the first to be used or sold regardless
of the actual timing of their use or sale. This method is most
closely tied to actual physical flow of goods in inventory. See
Exhibit 2–1.
2. Last-in, First-out (LIFO) inventory valuation assumes that the
most recently purchased/acquired goods are the first to be used
or sold regardless of the actual timing of their use or sale. Since
items you have just bought often cost more than those pur-
18
Essentials of Inventory Management

chased in the past, this method best matches current costs with
current revenues. See Exhibit 2–1.
3. Average Cost Method of inventory valuation identifies the value
of inventory and cost of goods sold by calculating an average
unit cost for all goods available for sale during a given period
of time. This valuation method assumes that ending inventory
consists of all goods available for sale. See Exhibit 2–2.
4. Specific Cost Method (also Actual Cost Method) of inventory val-
uation assumes that the organization can track the actual cost
of an item into, through, and out of the facility. That ability al-
lows you to charge the actual cost of a given item to production
or sales. Specific costing is generally used only by companies
with sophisticated computer systems or reserved for high-value
items, such as artwork or custom-made items.
5. Standard Cost Method of inventory valuation is often used by
manufacturing companies to give all of their departments a
uniform value for an item throughout a given year. This
method is a “best guess” approach based on known costs and
expenses, such as historical costs and any anticipated changes
coming up in the foreseeable future. It is not used to calculate
actual net profit or for income tax purposes. Rather, it is a
working tool more than a formal accounting approach.
Inventory on the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet shows the financial position of a company on a
specific date. It provides details for the basic accounting equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity. In other words, assets are a company’s
Average Cost = Total Cost of Goods ÷ Total Quantity of Goods

resources, while liabilities and equity are how those resources are
paid for.
  Assets represent a company’s resources. Assets can be in the
form of cash or other items that have monetary value, in-
cluding inventory. Assets are made up of (a) current assets
(cash assets or assets easily convertible to cash within one
year, such as accounts receivable, securities, and inventory),
(b) longer term assets such as investments and fixed assets
(property/plant/equipment), or (c) intangible assets
(patents, copyrights, and goodwill).
  Liabilities represent amounts owed to creditors (debt, ac-
counts payable, and lease-term obligations).
  Equity represents ownership or rights to the assets of the
company (common stock, additional paid-in capital, and
retained earnings).
Inventory is typically counted among a company’s current assets
because it can be sold within one year. This information is used to
calculate financial ratios that help assess the financial health of the
company. Note, however, that the balance sheet is not the only
place that inventory plays a role in the financial analysis of the
company. In fact, inventory shows up on the income statement in
the form of cost of goods sold.
Inventory on the Income Statement
The income statement is a report that identifies a company’s rev-
enues (sales), expenses, and resulting profits. While the balance
sheet can be described as a snapshot of a company on a specific date
(June 30, for example), the income statement covers a given period
of time (June 1 through June 30). The cost of goods sold is the item
22
Essentials of Inventory Management

on the income statement that reflects the cost of inventory flowing
out of a business.
The old saying, “it costs money to make money,” explains the
cost of goods sold. You make money by using or selling inventory.
That inventory costs you something. Cost of goods sold (on the in-
come statement) represents the value of goods (inventory) sold
during the accounting period. See Exhibit 2–3.
The value of goods that are not sold is represented by the end-
ing inventory amount on the balance sheet calculated as:
Ending Inventory = 
Beginning Inventory + Purchases – Cost of Goods Sold
This information is also useful because it can be used to show
how a company “officially” accounts for inventory. With it, you can
back into the cost of purchases without knowing the actual costs
by turning around the equation as follows:
Purchases = 
Ending Inventory – Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold
Or, you can figure out the cost of goods sold if you know what
your purchases are by making the following calculation:
Cost of Goods Sold = 
Beginning Inventory + Purchases – Ending Inventory
Finally, as you sell/use inventory and take in revenue for it, you
subtract the cost of the items from the income. The result is your
gross profit.
Ratio Analyses and What They Mean
Is something good or is it bad? To answer this question we often
compare one thing to another. That is the definition of a “ratio”;
it is an expression of how many of one item is contained within
another.

CONCLUSIONS
1. By valuing its inventory under the FIFO method of inventory valuation, this company
would have earned an extra $536 or $398 in after-tax income than under the LIFO
or Average Cost methods of inventory valuation, respectively.
2. By valuing its inventory under the LIFO method of inventory valuation, this company
would pay $357 or $92 less in federal income taxes than under the FIFO or Average
Cost methods of inventory valuation, respectively.

Ratios can be used in the business world by selecting parts of
an organization’s financial statements and comparing one set of
financial conditions to another. A company’s financial statements
contain key aspects of the business. By reviewing these aspects, you
can determine an organization’s economic well-being. One way of
reviewing these financial conditions is to compare one to another
dividing one by the other. For example, if you had $200 in cash
and $100 worth of debts, you could divide the cash (assets) by the
debt (liabilities), which would result in a ratio of 2 to 1. In other
words, you have twice as many assets as you do liabilities.
Ratios are useful tools to explain trends and summarize busi-
ness results. Often third parties, such as banks, use ratios to deter-
mine a company’s credit worthiness. By itself, a ratio holds little
meaning. However, when compared to other industry and/or com-
pany-specific figures or standards, ratios can be powerful in help-
ing to analyze your company’s current and historical results.
Companies in the same industry often have similar liquidity ratios
or benchmarks, as they often have similar cost structures. Your
company’s ratios can be compared to:
1. Prior period(s)
2. Company goals or budget projections
3. Companies in your industry
4. Companies in other industries
5. Companies in different geographic regions
In particular, the following three ratios are useful when assess-
ing inventory. 
CURRENT RATIO 
The current ratio assesses the organization’s overall liquidity and
indicates a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. In
25
Inventory as Money

other words, it measures whether or not a company will be able to
pay its bills. Technically speaking, the current ratio indicates how
many dollars of assets we have for each dollar of liabilities that we
owe. The current ratio is calculated as follows:
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities
Current Assets refers to assets that are in the form of cash or
that are easily convertible to cash within one year, such as accounts
receivable, securities, and inventory. Current Liabilities refers to li-
abilities that are due and payable within twelve months, such as
accounts payable, notes payable, and short-term portion of long-
term debt. 
Standards for the current ratio vary from industry to industry.
Companies in the service industry that carry little or no inventory
typically have current ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.3—that is, $1.10
to $1.30 in current assets for each dollar of current liabilities. Com-
panies that carry inventory have higher current ratios. Manufactur-
ing companies are included in this latter group and often have
current ratios ranging from 1.6 to 2.0; not only do they have inven-
tory in the form of finished goods ready for sale, but they also carry
inventory of goods that are not yet ready for sale. Generally speaking,
the longer it takes a company to manufacture the inventory and the
more inventory it must keep on hand, the higher the current ratio.
What the Current Ratio Might Mean
A low current ratio may signal that a company has liquidity prob-
lems or has trouble meeting its short- and long-term obligations.
In other words, the organization might be suffering from a lack of
cash flow to cover operating and other expenses. As a result, ac-
counts payable may be building at a faster rate than receivables.
Note, however, that this is only an indicator and must be used in
26
Essentials of Inventory Management

conjunction with other factors to determine the overall financial
health of an organization. In fact, some companies can sustain
lower-than-average current ratios because they move their inven-
tory quickly and/or are quick to collect from their customers.
Therefore, these companies have good cash flow.
A high current ratio is not necessarily desirable. It might indi-
cate that the company is holding high-risk inventory or may be
doing a bad job of managing its assets. For example, fashion re-
tailers may have costly inventory, but they might also have signif-
icant trouble getting rid of the inventory, for example, if the wrong
clothing line was selected. This makes it a high-risk company, forc-
ing creditors to require a bigger financial cushion.
Further, if a high current ratio is a result of a very large cash
account, it may be an indication that the company is not reinvest-
ing its cash appropriately. Even if the current ratio looks fine, other
factors must be taken into consideration, as liquidity problems
might still exist. Since ratios look at quantity, not quality, it is im-
portant to look at what the current assets consist of to determine
if they are made up of slow-moving inventory. To assess inventory’s
impact on liquidity, another test of liquidity should be taken into
account, such as the Quick Ratio (or Acid Test).
QUICK RATIO OR ACID TEST 
The quick ratio compares the organization’s most liquid current as-
sets to its current liabilities. The quick ratio is calculated as follows:
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets – Inventories) ÷ Current Liabilities
Assume that an industry that sells on credit has a quick ratio
of at least 0.8. In other words, the company has at least 80¢ in liq-
uid assets (likely in the form of accounts receivable) for every $1
of liabilities. Industries that have significant cash sales (such as gro-
27
Inventory as Money

cery stores) tend to be even lower. As with the current ratio, a low
quick ratio is an indicator of cash flow problems, while a high ratio
may indicate poor asset management, as cash may be properly
reinvested or accounts receivable levels are out of control. An or-
ganization’s ability to promptly collect its accounts receivable has
a significant impact on this ratio. The quicker the collection the
more liquidity it has.
INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO
The inventory turnover ratio measures, on average, how many
times inventory is replaced over a period of time. In its simplest
sense, an inventory turn occurs every time an item is received, is
used or sold, and then is replaced. If an SKU came in twice during
the year, was used/sold, and then replenished, that would be two
turns per year. If this happened once per month, it would be twelve
turns per year, and so forth.
Inventory turnover is an important measure since the ability
to move inventory quickly directly impacts the company’s liquidity.
Inventory turnover is calculated as follows:
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold ÷Average Inventory
Essentially, when a product is sold, it is subtracted from inven-
tory and transferred to cost of goods sold. Therefore, this ratio in-
dicates how quickly inventory is moving for accounting purposes.
It does not necessarily reflect how many times actual physical items
were handled within the facility itself. This is true because the cost
of goods sold number may include items you sold but never phys-
ically handled. For example, items that we purchase and then have
drop shipped directly at our customer’s site are never handled
within our facility. A more accurate measure of how many times
actual physical inventory turned within the site would be:
28
Essentials of Inventory Management

Actual Physical Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold from
Inventory Only ÷ Average Inventory
Note that if the inventory has increased or decreased significantly
during the year, the average inventory for the year may be skewed
and not accurately reflect your turnover ratio going forward. In ad-
dition, if the company uses the LIFO method of accounting, the ratio
may be inflated because LIFO may undervalue the inventory.
Unlike the current ratio and quick ratio, the inventory turnover
ratio does not adhere to a standard range. Organizations with
highly perishable products can have inventory turns 30 times a
year or more. Companies that retain large amounts of inventory
or that require a long time to build their inventory might have
turns only two or three times a year. In general, the overall trend
in business today is to reduce carrying costs by limiting the amount
of inventory in stock at any given time. As a result, both individual
inventory turnovers and industry averages in this area have in-
creased in recent years.
It is important to understand, however, that many factors can
cause a low inventory turnover ratio. The company may be holding
the wrong type of inventory, its quality may be lacking, or it may
have sales/marketing issues.
Profit Margins
Another set of ratios a stockkeeper must understand, especially one
in a for-profit environment, are those relating to profit margins. 
Profit margins are ratios of profitability that measure how much
out of every dollar of sales a company actually keeps in earnings.
If a company’s expenses increase more quickly than sales, then even
though sales might be higher than sales during the same time pe-
riod last year, its profit margins will go down. Basically, business
owners use gross profit margins to:
29
Inventory as Money

  Set prices at levels that ensure a strong profit, or 
  Measure and reduce costs for better profitability, or
  Determine what to charge for a new item to make it
profitable.
CALCULATING GROSS PROFIT 
Gross profit is the amount you have after you subtract all costs asso-
ciated with a sale. To understand gross profit, it is important to know
the distinction between variable and fixed costs. See Exhibit 2–4.
30
Essentials of Inventory Management
Variable costs are those that change
based on the amount of product
being made and are incurred as a
direct result of producing the
product.  Variable costs include:
• Materials used
• Direct labor
• Packaging
• Freight
• Plant supervisors’ salaries
• Utilities for a plant or warehouse
• Depreciation expense on production
equipment and machinery
Fixed costs generally are more static
in nature. They include:
• Office expenses, such as supplies,
utilities, telephones, and computers
• Salaries and wages of office staff,
salespeople, and officers and owners
• Payroll taxes and employee benefits
• Advertising, promotional, and other
sales expenses
• Insurance
• Auto expenses for salespeople
• Professional fees
• Rent
Variable expenses are recorded as cost of goods sold. Fixed expenses are
counted as operating expenses (sometimes called selling and general and
administrative expenses)
Exhibit 2–4 Variable and Fixed Costs

To figure out your gross profit margin, you first need to calcu-
late your gross profit. The formula for gross profit is:
Gross Profit = Sales – Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold (COGS) includes only the direct cost incurred
to manufacture or sell a product. 
COGS includes items:
  purchased for resale or 
  used to manufacture a product (as well as the direct labor
cost to produce the product).
COGS does not include operating expenses such as office rent,
office utilities, and indirect labor. 
By itself, gross profit doesn’t mean much. However, by using it
to calculate the gross profit margin, you can use it to spot profitabil-
ity trends over time. The formula for gross profit margin is: 
Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit ÷ Sales x 100%
Example
Company X has gross sales for 2009 equaling $5 million.
The cost of goods sold amounts to $1.2 million. What is
the gross profit margin?
Gross Profit Margin = (5,000,000 – 1,200,000) ÷ 5,000,000
Gross Profit Margin = 3,800,000 ÷ 5,000,000 
Gross Profit Margin = 76%
Company X has gross sales for 2010 equaling $5.5 mil-
lion. The cost of goods sold amounts to $1.4 million. What
is the gross profit margin?
31
Inventory as Money

Gross Profit Margin = (5,500,000 – 1,400,000) ÷ 5,500,000
Gross Profit Margin = 4,100,000 ÷ 5,500,000 
Gross Profit Margin = 74%
So what: Companies that have a high gross profit margin have
greater cash flow; and, those with stable or increasing gross profit
margins are more profitable than those whose gross profit margins
fluctuate wildly or decrease over time. In the example, although
Company X had greater sales from one year to the next, its gross
profit margin fell, indicating an increase in costs. If this trend con-
tinues, the company will be in trouble. 
You should calculate gross profit margin when you review your
monthly and quarterly financial statements because even if all costs
are covered and net income is strong and growing, changes in gross
profit margin can serve as early signs that an increase in COGS is
eroding your profitability. 
Gross profit margins for a given business can also be compared
to the gross profit margins common in that industry to determine
how the enterprise is doing. Don’t compare one industry to an-
other. Why? Because it is common in some industries to sell large
quantities of goods at a low gross profit margin, while in others
smaller quantities at larger gross profit margins are more normal.
You can use a combination of approaches to increase your
business’s gross profit margins, including:
  Increase the number of units sold (sales volume). 
  Reduce elements of COGS, for example, by substituting
less expensive materials and automating to use less labor.
  Raise prices. Try different pricing strategies until your
gross profit margin reaches the desired level. See Exhibit
2–5.

Merchandising Metrics
Stockkeepers, especially those in for-profit enterprises, often must
be concerned with setting the right price for an item or a grouping
of items. Or, they must determine the cost of an item.
33
Inventory as Money
Skimming
• A short-term profit strategy.  Skimming means charging a
relatively high price for a short time when a new,
innovative, or much-improved product is brought to
market. 
• The idea is to “skim off” customers who are willing to
pay a premium price to obtain the item right away.
• This strategy works well for “conspicuous” or “prestige
items,” such as a new type of electronic device.  
• Prices are lowered later when demand from the early
buyers falls.
Market
Penetration
Pricing
• Short-term profit strategy—selling at the lowest possible
price for a short-term period.
• Often used to introduce a new product or business with
an expected long-term life cycle.
Loss Leader
Pricing
• Purposely pricing some products at a level that
eliminates profit. 
• Done to increase customer traffic.
Price Lining
• Grouping products at certain price points (e.g., all items
for $9.99).
• Makes shopping easy for the consumer and averages out
desired markup.
Price Bundling
• Selling a product in multiple units (e.g., “Two for the price
of one” or “Buy three and receive one free”).
Status Quo
Pricing
• Price levels are firmly established and remain relatively
fixed until something happens in the marketplace that
requires a change or adjustment.
Exhibit 2–5 Pricing Strategies

PRICING GENERALLY
Price setting begins with determining the breakeven point.
  The breakeven point is reached when the cost of
producing/purchasing and/or selling a product or service
is covered.
  The contributing margin is the gross profit derived from
the sale of the product, that is, the selling price less the
cost of the goods or materials.
Selling Price – Cost of Goods = Contributing Margin
$10          $6              $4
Breakeven Formula
At the breakeven point, the revenue and the total cost are equal.
Fixed Costs ÷ Contributing Margin = Breakeven Point
$100,000  ÷
$4        =  25,000 Units
SELLING PRICE
Price determination, the selling price, for many consumer products
is often a function of the cost of production and a desired level of
markup.
Margins, Markups, and Markdowns
A profit margin is different than a markup. The margin is the per-
centage of the final selling price that is profit. A markup is what
percentage of the cost price you add to the cost price to get the sell-
ing price. A markdown is the difference between the original selling
price and the price at which an item is actually sold.
A selling price with a margin of 25% results in more profit than
a selling price with a markup of 25%. For example, if you buy an
34
Essentials of Inventory Management

item for $100 and mark it up 25%, it would sell for $125. However,
if you want to make a 25% (profit) margin it would sell for $133.33.
Determining the Selling Price
To calculate the selling price at a percent margin when the cost is
known, divide the cost by 100 percent minus the desired margin
percent.
Cost ÷ (100% – Markup Percent) = Selling Price
Examples:
Cost + (100% – Markup Percent) = Selling Price
$5  +      (100% – 50%)     =   $10
$5  +      (100% – 40%)     =   $8.33
$5  +      (100% – 20%)     =   $6.25
A quicker way to work it out is to divide the cost by the profit mar-
gin you want to make. For example:
For a 5% margin, divide the cost price by 0.95
For a 10% margin, divide the cost price by 0.9
For a 15% margin, divide the cost price by 0.85
For a 20% margin, divide the cost price by 0.8
For a 25% margin, divide the cost price by 0.75
For a 30% margin, divide the cost price by 0.7
Examples: 
For a 50% profit: $5 + .5 = $10 
For a 40% profit: $5 + .6 = $8.33
For a 20% profit: $5 + .8 = $6.25
Determining the Cost
To calculate the cost when the selling price and the markup percent
35
Inventory as Money

are known, multiply the selling price by the markup percent and
subtract the answer from the selling price.
(Selling Price × Markup Percent) – Selling Price = Cost
Example
($10 Selling Price x 40% Markup Percent) = $4 Markup
$10 Selling Price –
$4 Markup     = $6 Cost
Determining the Margin Percent
To determine the margin percent when the cost and the selling price
are known, subtract the cost from the selling price. Divide the dif-
ference by the selling price.
(Selling Price – Cost) + Selling Price = Margin Percent
Example
$10 Selling Price – $6 Cost = $4 Profit
$4 + $10 = 0.4 or 40% Margin
Determining Markdowns (on Sale Price)
Sometimes an item does not sell at the desired price. You must then
sell it at a markdown. In other words, you’re going to put the item
“on sale.” 
To determine the marked-down (on-sale) price where the original
price and the markdown percent are known, multiply the original
price by the markdown percent. Subtract the answer from the orig-
inal price.
Original Price – (Original Price x Percent Markdown) = 
On-Sale Price
36
Essentials of Inventory Management

Example
$10 Original Price x 15% Markdown) = $1.50 Markdown
$10 Original Price – $1.50 Markdown = $8.50 Sale Price
Determining Net Operating Profit Before Taxes
A measure of a company’s profitability is its net operating profit.
Net operating profit is the profitability of a company after account-
ing for cost of goods sold and operating expenses.  Operating profit
does not include expenses such as interest and taxes. See Exhibit
2–6. It also doesn’t depend on capital structure or one-time ex-
penses. So, it really does measure how well an enterprise is doing. 
Obsolete Stock
Any stockkeeper who has had to repeatedly move really slow mov-
ing or outright dead stock out of the way or finds herself hurting
for space because obsolete product eats up square foot after square
foot knows that these items “just gotta go.”
Exhibit 2–6 Calculating Net Operating Profit Before Taxes
The profit and expense for each dollar sold is calculated as
follows:
Sales price                                   $1.00
Cost of Product                          – 0.50
Freight Cost                               – 0.02
Gross Profit                                  0.48
Operating Expenses                    – 0.34
Net Operating Profit Before Taxes  0.14

WHY YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD NOT TO DISPOSE OF OBSOLETE
STOCK
Why is the dead stock still here? The three reasons most often given
as to why the product can’t be disposed of are:
1. It’s already paid for. 
2. We might use it someday.
3. We might sell it someday.
These explanations seem logical, and the idea of throwing away
dead stock may be counterintuitive. However, there are some very
real practical problems with simply hauling it off to the dumpster.
PROBLEMS WITH CONVINCING DECISION MAKERS THAT “ITS
GOTTA GO”
Decision makers often have difficulty with disposing of dead in-
ventory because it will adversely impact the balance sheet and de-
plete resources considered to be valuable for lending purposes.
Impact of Write-Off 
Anything that appears as an asset on the balance sheet has an ac-
counting value. This value, consisting of an item’s original cost
minus depreciation, is called the “book value.” It is irrelevant that
the item may actually be worthless to either a customer or as part
of a manufacturing process. If it has a one-dollar value on the
books, then disposing of dead inventory has an accounting conse-
quence to our organization. 
If we sell dead inventory that has a monetary value at a deep
discount, throw it away, or give it away to a charity, we will have to
immediately write off the book value of those items, which will,
of course, have a negative impact on the financial statements.
If your organization is sensitive to making extraordinary ad-
38
Essentials of Inventory Management

justments to the balance sheet and never or seldom writes off dead
inventory, you may have a difficult time ever convincing any deci-
sion maker to dispose of these items. The decision maker will sim-
ply not be willing to “take the hit on the books.”
Organization’s Capital Structure 
Almost everyone has heard the expression, “cash is king.” The
problem for many organizations is that cash flow doesn’t always
keep up with needs.
Often organizations raise operating capital by borrowing
against (a) their accounts receivable and (b) the book value of the
inventory they are carrying.
“Accounts receivable” are the amounts due from customers re-
sulting from normal sales activities. Depending on the industry,
banks will generally lend up to 75 percent of the value of accounts
receivable due in 90 days or less.
Bankers will also lend against the book value of inventory. The
willingness to lend against this asset is not as straightforward as
with accounts receivable. The more complex nature of these trans-
actions comes from the fact that in accordance with accepted ac-
counting practices, we should value inventory at the lower of cost
or fair market value. Therefore, dead stock should logically be val-
ued at a fair market value of zero dollars no matter what it origi-
nally cost.
In spite of generally accepted accounting practices and even
though parts of your inventory have no real market value (and
should be valued at zero dollars), bankers will often loan your or-
ganization 50 to 60 percent of the value of the inventory as that
value is shown on the books. So, companies will sometimes con-
tinue to carry dead stock so as to retain this artificial value on the
books. This is an area most stockkeepers will not have any direct
39
Inventory as Money

control over. However, the arguments below may overcome the
need to keep inventory values artificially high.
ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF DISPOSING OF DEAD STOCK
Strong arguments can be made in favor of disposing of nonpro-
ductive stock, including recapture of space, better use of labor and
equipment, and a reduction in the costs associated with having in-
ventory sitting around.
Recapture of Space 
In terms of space utilization, there are some simple mathematical
facts to keep in mind:
  Multiplying an item’s length by its width tells you the
amount of square feet the item is occupying.
  Multiplying an item’s length by its width by its height tells
you the amount of cubic space it is occupying.
If you were to actually figure out the cubic space taken up by
dead product, you would gain a powerful argument in favor of dis-
posing of this inventory. To bolster the argument, you may want
to ask your organization’s financial officer how much the company
is paying per square foot for rent. Multiplying the square footage
being consumed by dead product by the rent per square foot often
results in a truly eye-opening dollar amount. Providing actual
numbers to a decision maker is far more effective than speaking
in generalities, such as “dead stock is taking up a lot of space.”
Pointing out that obsolete stock is “taking up 4,000 square feet” or
“represents $2,000 per month in per square foot costs” should help
you convince your decision maker that “its gotta go.”
40
Essentials of Inventory Management

Efficient Utilization of Labor and Machine Resources
Not only does obsolete inventory take up a lot of space, it can also
get in the way of workers. Repeatedly moving obsolete product out
of the way hurts efficient use of both labor and machine time.
Too often, in trying to argue against keeping obsolete stock,
stockkeepers will state generalities, such as “it takes us a lot of time
to move that stuff around.” How long is “a lot of time”? Is it an
hour a day, four hours per week? Without specific numbers, your
arguments will sound hollow.
As many business writers have noted, “You cannot control what
you do not measure.” There are two things you need to do to get
specific time and dollar amounts:
  During each week for one month, every time you or your
staff move dead product out of the way, measure the
amount of direct labor that goes into that effort. Remem-
ber, if two workers are working together to move the items
and they work for fifteen minutes, that represents fifteen
minutes times two, or thirty minutes of direct labor.
  At the end of the month, divide the total amount of labor
hours by four to determine a weekly average. To determine
the amount of yearly labor involved in moving dead stock,
multiply the weekly average times the number of weeks in
a year your company operates.
Once again, obtain base information from your financial offi-
cer and multiply the average hourly wage you pay your workers,
including benefits, by the annual labor number. The result will
make a rather impressive argument as to how the organization can
save thousands of dollars per year by disposing of its dead stock.
41
Inventory as Money

Reduction of Carrying Costs (K Factor)
The K Factor represents the number of pennies per inventory dol-
lar per year a company is spending to house its inventory. It is gen-
erally expressed as a percentage. In other words, a K Factor of 25
percent means that you are spending 25¢ per inventory dollar per
year to house your inventory. A $1 dead item that sits on your shelf
for a year would cost you 25¢ that year, a total of 50¢ at the end of
the second year, a total of 75¢ at the end of the third year, and so
on.
There are two ways of computing the K Factor—a traditional
method in which you add together various expenses directly re-
lated to carrying inventory and a rough rule-of-thumb method.
See Exhibit 2–7.
Since it always costs something to carry inventory, it is obvious
that the longer dead stock remains in your facility, the more it will
cost. Two approaches can be used to effectively argue this point:
1. Demonstrate the impact of carrying costs on your exist-
ing dead stock. This addresses the “We’ve already paid
for it,” argument in favor of retaining dead stock. See Ex-
hibit 2–8 and Exhibit 2–9.
2. Demonstrate that if the product remains long enough,
even selling it at a profit will not Recapture your original
cost. This addresses the “We might need it someday” and
“We might sell it someday” arguments in favor of retain-
ing dead stock. See Exhibit 2–10.
In Exhibit 2–8 a percentage is used to indicate the amount of
dead stock in the facility. Note, however, it is always more convinc-
ing to a decision maker if you use actual lists and dollar amounts
to demonstrate those items that are dead rather than using a gen-
erality like a rough percentage. See Exhibit 2–9.

METHODS OF DISPOSAL
Various approaches to disposing of dead stock exist:
  Sell at net price
  Temporarily raise commissions for salespeople
  Discount the price
  Return to vendor
  Donate it
  Write it off
  Auction
It is important to remember something about convincing de-
cision makers of anything. Ordinarily, when reports or other in-
formation flow up a chain of command, the level of detail at each
level decreases. Generally, each higher level of management wants
to see less and less information with which to make decisions. You
should resist providing only minimal data in making arguments
regarding dead stock. This is a time to let the details do the talk-
ing.

Carrying Cost and Purchasing
Although you should only have the minimum amount of inven-
tory on hand required for either production or distribution, be
careful not to purchase small quantities over and over again. Buy-
ing small amounts frequently will lead to an excessive cost of re-
plenishment (the “R Factor”).
A simple example of how an excessive R Factor can be created
would be the following:
Example
Assumptions:
It costs a certain amount of money per line item, per pur-
chase order to buy something. Assume $2.59 per line item,
per purchase order for this example.
You Purchase 1 million widgets per year.
If you bought all 1 million widgets at one time, the R Factor
would be $2.59, since there was only one purchase order
with one line item on it.
If you bought 250,000 widgets at a time, the R Factor would
be $10.36. That is because you would have four purchase
orders with one line item each at a cost of $2.59 each.
If you bought 1 million widgets one at a time at an R Factor
of $2.59 each the replenishment cost would be $2,590,000!
Because of the R Factor, modern purchasing dictates that you
buy larger quantities on fewer purchase orders, but with suppliers
releasing items on a prearranged schedule or on demand.
Ultimately, the point at which your cost of carrying inventory
matches the cost of purchasing it is the proper economic order
quantity of that item. See “Replenishment Costs” in Chapter 5,
Planning and Replenishment Concepts.

Recap
The objective of this chapter was to provide you with highlights
of the most basic accounting concepts you, as a stockkeeper, must
understand to successfully discuss and plan inventory values with
your colleagues.
Although you may never participate in the preparation of
month- or year-end financial statements, it is in your own self-
interest to review these statements and think about how the inven-
tory values reflected impact your operation.
Also, regular, detailed examination of your gross profit margin
and how its components change over time can assist you in high-
lighting opportunities for improvement in operations and prof-
itability. 
And finally, whenever discussing either buying more stock or
getting rid of dead stock, it is always more persuasive to use actual
numbers than to deal in generalities. Remember, “if you can meas-
ure it, you can control it.”

PHYSICAL LOCATION AND
CONTROL OF INVENTORY
I
f you can’t find an item, you can’t count it, fill an order with it,
or build a widget with it. If you cannot control the location of
your product or raw materials from both physical and recordkeep-
ing standpoints, then your inventory accuracy will suffer.
To sustain inventory accuracy on an ongoing basis you must:
  Formalize the overall locator system used throughout the
facility
  Track the storage and movement of product from
 Receipt to storage
 Order filling to shipping, or to staging at a point-of-use
  Maintain timely records of all item storage and
movement
The objective of this chapter is to give you guidance in setting
up a system that allows you to put items where they will do the most
good for your organization. It will provide you with a working
knowledge of (1) three key stock locator systems (which relate to the
overall organization of SKUs within a facility and their impact on
space planning); (2) item placement theories dealing with the spe-

cific arrangement of products within an area of the warehouse
(should the box be over here or over there?); and (3) some practical
methods of attaching addresses to stock items and how to tie an item
number to its location address.
Common Locator Systems
The purpose of a material locator system is to create procedures
that allow you to track product movement throughout the facility.
Although going by many names, the most common “pure” systems
are memory, fixed, and random. A type of fixed system is the zone
system. The combination approach is a common mixture of the
fixed and random systems.
In considering which locator system will work best, you should
attempt to maximize:
  Use of space
  Use of equipment
  Use of labor
  Accessibility to all items
  Protection from damage
  Ability to locate an item
  Flexibility
  The reduction of administrative costs
Maximizing all of these considerations at the same time is dif-
ficult, if not impossible. Often, each of these concerns creates con-
flicts with one or more of the others. For example, you may wish
to store all cylinders together to utilize the same equipment to han-
dle them or locate them together for ease of reach and retrieval.
However, if the chemical nature of the contents of these cylinders
prohibits them from being stored in the same area, safety and pro-
50
Essentials of Inventory Management

tection of property concerns take precedence over other consider-
ations. Exhibit 3–1 provides scenarios in which several valid con-
siderations are in conflict.
The stockkeeper should select a locator system that provides
the best solution given the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives.
No one system is “right.” What is best will depend on considera-
tions such as:
  Space available
  Location system (See the “Impact on Physical Space”
sections in this chapter.)
  Dimensions of product or raw materials stored
  Shape of items
  Weight of items
  Product characteristics, such as stackable, toxic, liquid,
crushable
  Storage methods, such as floor stacked, racks, carousels,
shelving
  Labor availability
  Equipment, including special attachments available
  Information systems support
Every company has a limited amount of space available for
stock storage. Some locator systems use space more effectively than
do others. When choosing your locator system, think carefully
about how much space it will use. The following pages discuss sev-
eral types of locator systems and evaluate the strengths and weak-
nesses of each.
MEMORY SYSTEMS
The most fundamental of all locator systems is the “memory” system.
51
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

52
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 3–1 Examples of Valid Storage Considerations in Conflict
 Scenario One—Accessibility versus Space: Charmax, Inc.
wishes to have its entire product as easy to get to as possible
for order filling purposes. It therefore attempted to have a
“picking face” (a front-line, visible position from which the
product can easily be selected) for each item. In order to ac-
tually create a picking face for each SKU, Charmax would
have to assign a specific location for every product appearing
on all of its pick tickets, with no two items being placed one
on top of another, and no item being placed behind another.
Charmax quickly realized that it lacked sufficient space in its
facility to have a specific position for every item it carried.
 Scenario Two—Use of Labor versus Protection from Dam-
age: Alana Banana Enterprises wishes to reduce labor hours
by putting into place efficient product handling procedures.
Its intent is to develop standard operating procedures so that
workers will only handle SKUs four times: once when it is
received, once when stored, once when picked, and once
when loaded. However, in order to protect SKUs from bruis-
ing, items must be placed into protective cartons for storage.
SKUs are not picked in full carton quantities so workers have
to remove various quantities at different times from the car-
tons. Empty cartons must then be stacked, cleaned, restacked,
and taken back to the receiving area for reuse. These protec-
tive measures add a number of labor-intensive steps to the
process.
 Scenario Three—Ability to Locate an Item versus Space
Utilization: Racquetballers America wants to assign a specific
home to each of its products for inventory control purposes.

Basic Concept
Memory systems are solely dependent on human recall. Often, they
are little more than someone saying, “I think it’s over there.”
The foundations of this locator system are simplicity, relative
freedom from paperwork or data entry, and maximum utilization
of all available space. Memory systems depend directly on people
and only work if several or all of the conditions listed in Exhibit
3–2 exist at the same time.
Impact on Physical Space
The most complete space utilization is available through this sys-
tem. Why? Because no item has a dedicated location that would
prevent other SKUs from occupying that same stock location po-
sition if it were empty (either side-to-side or up-and-down).
Pros
As with all locator systems, the memory system has a number of
strengths and weaknesses. Some of the pros are:
53
Physical Location and Control of Inventory
However, it has a small stockroom. Racquetballers realizes that
if it uses a fixed storage location approach it must assign suffi-
cient space to store the maximum amount of any one of its
SKUs that will ever be on hand at one time in that location. If
it uses a random location approach where items can be placed
one on top of another or behind one another, then it will max-
imize its use of space. Racquetballers decides using its limited
space is more important than putting in the extra labor and
administration necessary to keep track of where everything is
as it moves around the floor.

54
Essentials of Inventory Management
  Simple to understand
  Little or no ongoing paper-based or computer-based
tracking required
  Full utilization of space
  No requirement for tying a particular stocking location,
identifier, bin, slot, drawer, rack, bay, or spot to a specific
SKU
  Requirements of single item facilities (such as a grain
silo) can be met
Cons
Some negative aspects of a memory system are:
Exhibit 3–2 Conditions Under Which Memory Systems Will
Work
 Storage locations are limited in number.
 Storage locations are limited in size.
 The variety of items stored in a location is limited.
 The size, shape, or unitization (e.g., palletization, strapping
together, banding, etc.) of items allows for easy visual iden-
tification and separation of one SKU from another.
 Only one or a very limited number of individuals work
within the storage areas.
 Workers within the storage area do not have duties that re-
quire them to be away from those locations.
 The basic types of items making up the inventory does not
radically change within short time periods.
 There is not a lot of stock movement.

  The organization’s ability to function must strongly rely
on the memory, health, availability, and attitude of a
single individual (or a small group of people)
  Significant and immediate decreases in accuracy result
from changes in the conditions set out in Exhibit 3–2
  Once an item is lost to recall, it is lost to the system
Despite its limitations, a memory system may be as efficient as
any other, particularly if there are only a limited number of differ-
ent SKUs within a small area.
FIXED LOCATION SYSTEMS
Memory systems, in which nothing has a home and everything can
be put wherever there’s room,  are at one extreme of locator sys-
tems. Fixed locator systems are at the other extreme. 
Basic Concept
In pure fixed location systems, every item has a home and nothing
else can live there. Some (not pure) fixed systems allow two or
more items to be assigned to the same location, with only those
items being stored there.
Impact on Physical Space
If quantities of any given SKU are large, then its  “home” may con-
sist of two or more storage positions. However, collectively all of
these positions are the only places where this item may exist within
the facility, and no other items may reside there. Basically, every-
thing has a home and nothing else can live there.
Fixed location systems require large amounts of space for two
reasons :
  Honeycombing
55
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

  Planning around the largest quantity of an item that will
be in the facility at one time
Honeycombing is the warehousing situation where available stor-
age space is not being fully utilized.  Honeycombing is unavoidable
given location system tradeoffs, product shape, and so on. The goal
of a careful layout is to minimize how often and to what extent this
happens.
Honeycombing occurs both horizontally (side-to-side) and
vertically (up-and-down), robbing us of both square feet and cubic
space. See Exhibit 3–3.
56
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 3–3 Honeycombing

Two simple methods can determine the level of honeycombing
within your own facility. One deals with a simple ratio analysis,
the other with cubic space. See Exhibits 3–4 and 3–5.
The second reason the fixed system requires significant space
is the necessity of planning around the largest quantity of an item
that will be in the facility at one time. Each SKU will have an as-
signed location or locations. This “home” must be large enough to
contain the total cubic space the item will fill up at the time that
the largest quantity of that item will be in the facility. In other
words, if a thousand cases of widgets are in the warehouse at the
same time, the home of the widgets has to be large enough to hold
them all. Therefore, the total space required for all items in a fixed
system will be the total cubic space of one hundred percent of all
SKUs, as though the maximum quantity of each of them was in
the facility at one time. Space planning for an entire inventory in
a dedicated location environment is planned around a one-year
Cause
Description
• Product shape
Physical characteristics cut down on
stackability and prevent use of cubic space or
placing one item against another.
• Product put away
Product not stacked or placed in a uniform
manner, causing loss of vertical and horizontal
space.
• Location system rules
A location is empty because no other item
may be placed there as it is not the second
item’s assigned home.
• Poor housekeeping
Trash, poorly placed desks, etc., force empty
space around it.

Physical Location and Control of Inventory

time period. Stated differently, all of the space needed for all of the
widgets has to be added to all of the space needed for the gidgits
and that space has to be added to all of the room needed for the
doodads, and so on.
58
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 3–4 Determining Impact of Honeycombing—Ratio
Method
Determine the impact of honeycombing on your present
facility.
1. Count the number of locations you currently have set
up to store items—both horizontally and vertically. Include
all locations whether full, partially full, or empty.
2. Count the number of empty positions.
3. Divide the number of empty locations by the total stor-
age positions you have. The result will be your honeycombing
ratio.
That ratio represents the percentage of empty space within
the storage portion of your stockroom(s). Determining this
ratio provides you with a baseline. If you decide to change
your storage philosophy, change your storage mechanisms
(for example, from racks to floor stacking, or from racks to
shelving). You can then determine the new ratio and measure
improvement in space utilization.

Pros
Fixed locator systems have the following definite advantages:  
 Immediate knowledge of where all items are located. (This
system feature dramatically reduces confusion as to “where
to put it”  and “where to find it,” which increases efficiency
and productivity, while reducing errors in both stocking
and order fulfillment.)
 Training time for new hires and temporary workers is re-
duced.
 Simplifies and expedites both receiving and stock replen-
ishment because predetermined put-away instructions can
be generated.
 Allows for controlled routing of order fillers. 
 Allows product to be aligned sequentially (for example,
SKU001, SKU002, SKU003).
 Allows for strong control of individual lots, facilitating first
in first out (“FIFO”) control, if that is desired. Lot control
can also be accomplished under a random location system.
However simpler, more definitive control is possible using
the dedicated location concept.
 Allows product to be positioned close to its ultimate point-
60
Essentials of Inventory Management
The ratio method is a relatively simple approach to de-
termining a rough estimate of honeycombing. However, the
ratio method doesn’t account for the fact that storage spaces
within a given facility come in various sizes. A more precise
method to determine honeycombing is to calculate the
amount of unused cubic feet.
(Exhibit 3-5 Continued.)

of-use. Product positioning is discussed in the “Item Place-
ment Theories” section of this chapter.
 Allows product to be placed in a location most suitable to
an SKU’s size, weight, toxic nature, flammability, or other
similar characteristics.
Cons
Are there disadvantages to fixed locator systems? Of course. Chief
among the cons are:
 Contributes to honeycombing within storage areas.
 Space planning must allow for the total cubic volume of all
products likely to be in a facility within a defined period of
time.
 Dedicated systems are somewhat inflexible. If you have
aligned product by sequential numbering and then add a
subpart or delete a numbered SKU, then you must move
all products to allow for the add-in or collapse out locations
to fill in the gap.
 Basically, fixed or dedicated location systems allow for
strong control over items without the need to constantly
update location records. That control must be counterbal-
anced by the amount of physical space required by this sys-
tem.
ZONING SYSTEMS
A variation of pure fixed locator systems are those that place sim-
ilar items in “zones.”
Basic Concept
Zoning is centered around an item’s characteristics. Like a fixed
61
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

system, only items with certain characteristics can live in a partic-
ular area. Items with different attributes can’t live there.
An SKU’s characteristics would cause the item to be placed
within a certain area of the stockroom or at a particular level
within a section of shelving or rack section. See Exhibit 3–6. For
example, irregular-shaped SKUs might be placed in lower levels to
ease handling, or all items requiring the use of a forklift for put
away or retrieval might be located in a specific area and on pallets.

Impact on Physical Space
As with dedicated systems  the more tightly you control where a
particular item will be stored, the more you will contribute to hon-
eycombing or to the need to plan around maximum quantities.
Pros
Some of the pros of using zoning systems are:
  Allows for the isolation of SKUs according to such charac-
teristics as size, variety, flammability, toxicity, weight, lot
control, private labeling, and so on.
  Allows for flexibility moving items from one zone to an-
other quickly or in creating different zones efficiently.
  Allows for the addition of SKUs within a zone (unlike a
fixed system) without having to move significant amounts
of product to create room within an assigned location or
within a sequentially numbered group of items. It also does
not require the collapsing of space if an item is deleted.
  Allows for flexibility in planning: Although items are as-
signed to a general zone, because they do not have a specific
position they must reside in, there is no need to plan
around one hundred percent of any given item’s cubic re-
quirements.
Cons
As with any locator system, zoning systems also have a number of
negative features, including:
  Zoning is not always required for efficient product
handling. You may be adding needless administrative
complexity by utilizing zoning.
63
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

  Zoning may contribute to honeycombing.
  Zoning requires updating of stock movement
information.
Basically, zoning allows for control of item placement based on
whatever characteristics the stockkeeper feels are important.
RANDOM LOCATOR SYSTEMS
Random locator systems allow for good space utilization but re-
quire more administration.
Basic Concept
In a random system nothing has a home, but you know where
everything is. Pure random locator systems allow for the maxi-
mization of space since no item has a fixed home and may be
placed wherever there is space. This allows SKUs to be placed above
or in front of one another and for multiple items to occupy a single
bin/slot/position/rack. The primary characteristic of a random lo-
cator system that makes it different from a memory system is that
each SKU identifier is tied to whatever location address it is in
while it is there. In other words, memory systems tie nothing to-
gether, except in the mind of the stockkeeper. Random systems
have the flexibility of a memory system coupled with the control
of a fixed or zone system. Essentially an item can be placed any-
where so long as its location is accurately noted in a computer
database or a manually maintained paper-based card file system.
When the item moves, it is deleted from that location. Therefore,
an SKU’s address is the location it is in while it is there.
Impact on Physical Space
Because items may be placed wherever there is space for them,
64
Essentials of Inventory Management

random locator systems provide us with the best use of space and
maximum flexibility while still allowing control over where an
item can be found.
Planning space around a random locator system is generally
based on the cubic space required for the average number of SKUs
on hand at any one time. Therefore, in planning space require-
ments around a random locator system, you need to discern from
our inventory records what our average inventory levels are and
what products are generally present within that average. By mul-
tiplying the cubic footage of each of those items by the quantity
of each usually on hand, you can determine our space required.
See Exhibit 3–7.
Pros
The major reasons to consider using a random locator system are:
Maximization of space.
Control of where all items are at any given time.
Cons
Major concerns regarding the use of random locator systems
are: 
Constant updating of information is necessary to track where
each item is at any given time. Updating must be accomplished
through manual paper-based recording, bar code scanning, or in-
tensive data entry updating. 
May be unnecessarily complicated if your organization has a
small number of SKUs.
Basically, random locator systems force a tradeoff between
maximization of space and minimization of administration.

Planning a Storage Area Around a Fixed or a Random Locator System
Hammer Company manufactures widgits. It has broken down its bill-of-materials, the listing
of all of the pieces and parts required to build a widgit, and has come up with the following list:
If Hammer Co was going to store product in ﬁxed positions, it would have to plan around a
minimum of 7,600 cubic feet of actual storage space. Although each of these items is required to
produce Hammer Company’s products, they are not all needed at the same time. On average Ham-
mer only has on hand 30 percent of any of the above items at any one time. If it used a random lo-
cator system it would plan for approximately 2,280 cubic feet of actual storage area.

COMBINATION SYSTEMS
A system that blends many of the best features of fixed and random
locator systems are combination systems.
Basic Concept
Combination systems enable you to assign specific locations to
those items requiring special consideration, while the bulk of the
product mix will be randomly located. Very few systems are purely
fixed or purely random.
Conceptually, you are trying to enjoy the best features of the
fixed and random systems. You achieve this by assigning only se-
lected items to fixed homes—but not all items. Therefore, you only
have to plan around the maximum space required by the selected
items instead of that required by all items. For the items not in
fixed homes, you can plan around the average quantities you ex-
pect to have on a daily, ongoing basis. So, the fixed system is used
for the selected items and the random system for everything else.
A common application of the combination system approach is
where certain items are an organization’s primary product or raw
materials line and must be placed as close as possible to a
packing/shipping area or to a manufacturing workstation. Those
items are assigned a fixed position, while the remainder of the prod-
uct line is randomly positioned elsewhere. See Exhibit 3–8 for typical
scenarios for utilizing a combination locator system.
Common Item Placement Theories
Locator systems provide a broad overview of where SKUs will be
found within a facility. Physical control of inventory is enhanced
by narrowing the focus of how product should be laid out within
any particular location system. As with locator systems, item place-

Exhibit 3–8 Typical Scenarios Involving Combination Location
Systems
Scenario One: Barash Foods decided to speed up its order
filling efforts by changing where product was located in rela-
tionship to the shipping dock. First it determined which 15–
20 percent of its product lines showed up on 80 percent of
its orders. These items would be assigned to fixed positions
close to the point-of-use (shipping dock), while those items
found in only 20 percent of the orders would be randomly
stored. 
Barash had to decide if these fixed homes would be large
enough to hold 100 percent of the cubic space necessary to
house a product if the maximum quantity of it was in the fa-
cility at one time during the year. The company decided it
could not devote that much space per product in the limited
area closest to the point-of-use. It therefore decided to allow
for 100 percent of the space needed for one week’s worth of
product movement for the fixed location SKUs. In other
words, while still having to follow the fixed location system
rule that space must exist for 100 percent of the cubic space
required for the maximum quantity of an item expected dur-
ing a given time period, it controlled the space and quantity
by shortening the timeframe. 
Random items were stored in accordance with the general
rule that random space is planned around the average quan-
tity expected in an area during a defined time period. In this
case the time period was one year. 
Scenario Two: Charmax Manufacturing is a “job shop”
electronics manufacturer. It manufactures special-order items
and often will only produce one, never-to-be-repeated run

ment theories (where should a particular item or category of items
be physically positioned) go by many different names in trade lit-
erature. By whatever name, most approaches fall into one of three
concepts: inventory stratification, family grouping, and special con-
siderations.
69
Physical Location and Control of Inventory
of an item. Therefore, some specific raw materials inventories
required for any given production run may never be needed
in the future. However, the company uses many common
electronics components such as resisters, transistors, and sol-
der in most of the final assemblies it produces. Its physical
plant is very small. 
Charmax carefully reviews its master production schedule
to determine when various subassemblies and final assemblies
will be produced. It then analyzes the bill-of-materials (the
recipe of components) for the sub- or final assemblies, and
orders as much specific purpose items as possible on a to-be-
delivered just-in-time basis. This holds down the quantity of
nonstandard inventory it will have in-house at any one time. 
Charmax then establishes fixed positions for working
stock, both special-order and standard stock items, during a
production cycle around the appropriate workstations.
Where working stock would consume too much space
around a work area, working reserve stock is placed in zone
locations close to the workstations. Regular, general-use
product, such as resisters and transistors, is stored in random
order. This combination location system—which is com-
prised of fixed, zone, and random storage for working, work-
ing reserve, and general stock—allows Charmax to maximize
its use of space at any given time.

INVENTORY STRATIFICATION
Inventory stratification consists of two parts:
1.   A-B-C categorization of SKUs
2.   Utilizing an SKU’s unloading/loading ratio
A-B-C Categorization of SKUs
This item placement approach is based on  “Pareto’s Law.” In 1907,
an Italian sociologist and economist by the name of Vilfredo Pareto
(1848–1923) expressed his belief that 80 to 85 percent of Italy’s
money was held by only 15 to 20 percent of the country’s popula-
tion. He called the small, wealthy group the “vital few” and every-
one else the “trivial many.” This ultimately came to be known as
the “80–20 Rule,” or Pareto’s Law. The concept stands for the
proposition that within any given population of things, approxi-
mately 20 percent of them have 80 percent of the  “value” of all of
the items concentrated within them, and that the other 80 percent
only have 20 percent of the value concentrated within them.
“Value” can be defined in various ways. For example, if the crite-
rion is money, then 20 percent of all items represent 80 percent of
the dollar value of all items. If the criterion is usage rate, then 20
percent of all items represent the 80 percent of the items most
often used/sold.
Accordingly, for efficient physical inventory control, using pop-
ularity (speed of movement into and through the facility) as the
criterion, the most productive overall location for an item is a stor-
age position closest to that item’s point-of-use. SKUs are separated
into A-B-C categories, with “A” representing the most popular,
fastest moving items (the “vital few”),  “B” representing the next
most active, and  “C” the slow movers.
Providing product to outside customers is often the chief ob-
jective of a distribution environment. Therefore, in a distribution
70
Essentials of Inventory Management

environment, the point-of-use would be the shipping dock.  In a
manufacturing environment, a workstation would become the
point-of-use, with the most active, most often required raw mate-
rials positioned in near proximity to it.
To separate an inventory into A-B-C categories, create a sorted
matrix that presents all SKUs in descending order of importance
and allows for the calculation of those items representing the great-
est concentration of value. Exhibit 3–9 represents selected rows of
a complete listing of SKUs. 
What the Matrix Shows
Before attempting to understand how the matrix is mathemat-
ically constructed, you first have to explore what information the
matrix is presenting. Unless otherwise stated, all references are to
Exhibit 3–9.
  Column A is merely a sequential listing of the number of
SKUs in the total population. The example shows 300
items. If an organization had 2,300 SKUs, Column A of its
matrix would end with Row 2,300.
  Recall that Pareto’s Law has two components. The first
refers to the percentage of all items that a certain number
of items represent, and the second to the percentage value
that the same grouping of items has when compared to the
value of all other items combined.
  Column G reflects the first aspect. For example, 30 items
represent 10 percent of 300. Therefore, Column G, Row 30
shows 10 percent of all 300 items.
  Column F reflects the second aspect. For example, the first
three items (Rows 1, 2, and 3) of Column A have a com-
bined value (usage rate) of 15.5 percent. That 15.5 percent

is shown at Row 3 of Column F. (How the 15.5 percent is
arrived at is explained below in “Creating the Matrix.”)
  After creating the matrix, a review of Column F leads to
decisions as to where the cutoff should be for each (A-B-
C) category. There is no rule of thumb. The decision is a
common sense, intuitive one. In Exhibit 3–9, since 19 of all
items represented almost 50 percent of the value of all items
(see Row 19, Column F), it seems appropriate to cut off the
A category at that number. It would have been just as ap-
propriate to cut it off at Row 20, Column F, which shows
50.9 percent.
Creating the Matrix
Here is how to create the matrix:
  Most application software programs include a report gen-
erator module that allows various fields of information,
such as SKU identifiers, descriptions, and quantities, to be
extracted from the general database and saved in a generi-
cally formatted (ASCII) file.1 This information may then
be exported into one of the commonly available spread-
sheet software programs such as Excel.  Rather than under-
taking the data entry required to input the information
found in Columns B, C, and D, you should obtain this in-
formation from your report generator and then export it
into a spreadsheet program.
  Column A—reflects the number of SKUs being analyzed.
It is organized in ascending numeric sequence (1, 2, 3 . . .).
  Column B—SKU number/identifier.
  Column C—SKU description.
  Column D—Annual usage quantity of the SKU.
73
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

In a retail/distribution environment, where the inventory is com-
prised of finished goods, Column D will contain the immediately
preceding 12 months’ usage quantities. This is based on the rule
of thumb that the product lines will remain relatively unchanged
during the upcoming 12-month period. The immediately preced-
ing 12 months’ usage rates will reflect any product trends and is
more timely than using the immediate past calendar year’s rates.
In a manufacturing environment, raw materials, components,
and subassemblies used during the past 12 months may not be re-
quired during the upcoming 12 months. Therefore, the data for
Column D must be derived from the master production schedule
(the projection of what is to be built and in what quantities). After
determining what will be built and in what quantities, examine the
bill-of-materials (BOM), the recipe of what pieces and parts will
actually go into the items to be manufactured. The data necessary
for Column D is ascertained by multiplying the appropriate items
in the BOM times the quantity of items to be built.
Column D is sorted in descending order, with the highest use
item appearing at the top and the most inactive item at the bottom.
Column D is the sort field. However, if only Column D was
sorted, the information in it would become disassociated from the
SKUs the data represents, which information is reflected in
Columns B and C. Therefore, the sort range includes columns B,
C, and D so that all related information is sorted together.
  E—Cumulative total of Column D.
To derive the percentage value that a number of items have
compared to the value of all items, it is necessary to establish that
overall value as well as the value that any given number of items
added together may possess. This is what Column E does.
Note that the first row of Column E is the same as the first row
of Column D. Note that adding together the first two rows of Col-
74
Essentials of Inventory Management

umn D results in the second row of Column E. The sum of the first
three rows of Column D equals the third row of Column E. The
sum of the first 17 rows of Column D results in the data in Row
17 of Column E, and so forth.
The data shown in Row 300 of Column E reflects the usage
value of all 300 items added together. The information on any
given Row of Column E reflects the value of all of the preceding
SKUs added to the value of that specific row’s value.
  F—This is the second aspect of Pareto’s Law. It reflects the
percentage value that a grouping of items has when com-
pared to the value of all other items.
Column F is derived by dividing every row of Column E by the
last value of Column E. In other words, the first value in Column
F (6.3 percent) results from dividing the first row of Column E
(8,673) by the last row of Column E (138,134). The value found
in Row 2 of Column F is derived from dividing the amount shown
in Row 2 of Column E (15,643) by the last row of Column E
(138,134), and so forth. Using arithmetic terminology, each row
of Column E acts as a numerator, the last row of Column E is the
denominator, and the quotient is found in Column F.
  G—This is the first aspect of Pareto’s Law. It reflects the
percentage of all items compared with all other items. In
other words, 3 is 1 percent of 300.
  Column G is derived by dividing every row of Column A
by the last number in Column A. In other words, the first
value in Column G (0.3 percent) results from dividing the
first row of Column A (1) by the last row of Column A
(300). The value found in Row 2 of Column G is derived
from dividing the amount shown in Row 2 of Column A
(2) by the last row of Column A (300), and so forth.
75
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

  After creating the chart, you look down Columns F and G
and decide where you want to place the cutoff for categories
A, B, and C. Product would then be arranged according to
its category.
  Appendix B sets out the formulae necessary to create the
matrix for 300 SKUs in Microsoft Excel®.
Utilizing an SKU’s Unloading/Loading Ratio
Even more efficiency in physical inventory control can be achieved
through placing items within the A-B-C zones according to that
SKU’s unloading-to-loading (“unloading/loading”) ratio. The un-
loading/loading ratio reflects the number of trips necessary to
bring an item to a storage location compared with the number of
trips required to transport it from a storage point to a point-of-
use. If one trip was required to bring in and store a case of product,
but 10 trips were required to actually take its contents to a point-
of-use, the unloading/loading ratio would be 1 to 10 (1:10). Sub-
stantial reductions in handling times can be achieved through
application of this principle. See Exhibit 3–10.
The closer the unloading/loading ratio is to 1:1, the less it mat-
ters where an item is stored within an A-B-C zone because the
travel time is the same on either side of the storage location. The
more the ratio increases, the more critical it is to place an item
closer to its point-of-use. Assuming 7 productive hours of labor
within an 8-hour work shift, a reduction of even 30 seconds in
travel time every 5 minutes will result in a time savings of 42 min-
utes. See Exhibit 3–11.
FAMILY GROUPING
An alternative to the A-B-C approach is the family grouping/like prod-
uct approach. This approach to item placement positions items with
76
Essentials of Inventory Management

similar characteristics together. Theoretically, similar characteristics
will lead to a natural grouping of items, which will be
received/stored/picked/shipped together.
Groupings can be based on:
  Like characteristics—widgets with widgets, gidgits with
gidgits, gadgets with gadgets.
  Items that are regularly sold together—parts needed to
tune up a car.

Assumptions:
 One case of photocopying machine paper brought in and

 Case holds 10 reams
 Only using one ream of paper at a time

Pros
There are a number of advantages to using family groups, includ-
ing:
  Ease of storage and retrieval using similar techniques and
equipment.
  Ease of recognition of product groupings.
  Ease of using zoning location systems.
Cons
Before using the family grouping approach you should carefully
consider some of its negatives, as follows:
  Some items are so similar they become substituted one for
the other, such as electronics parts.
78
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 3–11 Practical Effect of Inventory Layout Changes
If a change in procedure, layout, product design, paper-
work, or any other factor saved 30 seconds every 5 minutes,
how much time would you save each day?
 Assume 7 actual work hours per day
 60 minutes × 7 hours = 420 minutes
 420 minutes ÷ 5 minutes = 84 segments
 84 × 30 seconds = 2,560 seconds
 2,560 seconds ÷ 60 seconds = 42 minutes
Saving 30 seconds every 5 minutes saves 42 minutes per day!

  Danger of properly positioning an active item close to its
point-of-use, but consuming valuable space close to that
area by housing far less active “family member” items with
their popular relative.
  Danger of housing an active product with its inactive rela-
tives far from the popular SKU’s point-of-use, all for the
sake of keeping like items together.
  An item can be used in more than one family.
  Using inventory stratification and family grouping together
Effective item placement can often be achieved through tying
both the inventory stratification and family grouping approaches
together. For example, assume order-filling personnel travel up
and down a main travel aisle, moving into picking aisles to select
items, and then back out to the main aisle to proceed further. Fur-
ther, assume 12 brands of Gidgits are all stored in the same area
for purposes of family grouping. Pareto’s Law indicates that not
all brands of Gidgits will be equally popular. Consequently, using
both the inventory stratification and family grouping concepts to-
gether, the most popular Gidgit brands are positioned closer to the
main travel aisle and the least popular furthest from it. The end
result is a more efficient overall layout.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
A product’s characteristics may force us to receive/store/pick/ship
it in a particular manner. The product may be extremely heavy or
light, toxic or flammable, frozen, odd in shape, and so on.
Even with items requiring special handling or storage, such as
frozen food stored in a freezer, the inventory stratification and
family grouping concepts can and should be employed to ensure
efficient inventory layout.
79
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

Location Addresses and 
SKU Identifiers
You simply cannot control what you can’t find. Therefore, it is im-
perative that you create and maintain a system of location ad-
dresses and SKU identifiers. Those two elements are essential to
tracking an item no matter where it goes.
SIGNIFICANCE 
Major contributing factors to the success of inventory systems are:
  Adequate, appropriate identification markings on SKUs,
including both SKU number and stock keeping unit of
measure. These markings allow a worker to quickly and
easily identify an item without having to read and translate
product descriptions and confusing pack size designations.
This ease of recognition reduces errors and the time re-
quired for either stock selection or put-away.
  Adequate, appropriate identification markings on
bin/slot/floor/rack/drawer/shelf locations. Just like the ad-
dress on a house, the address of a specific location in the
stockroom lets you quickly find the “tenant” or “home-
owner” SKU you are looking for.
  Procedures tying any given SKU to the location it is in at any
given time. How does the post office know where to send
mail to someone who has moved? Obviously, the relocated
person fills out a change of address form. In much the same
manner, you must set up a procedure that tells your system
where a product lives, and if it moves—where to.
  Procedures tying a single SKU to multiple locations in
which it is stored. If you have two homes, you let your
80
Essentials of Inventory Management

friends know the addresses. Your friends then put that in-
formation together in their address books. You must do the
same thing for products residing in two or more locations
within the building.
  A system for tracking items, on a timely basis, as they
change locations. Whatever form your “change of address”
form takes, it has to be filled out and processed quickly.
  Package advertising that does not obscure SKU identifier
codes.
  Use of simple marking systems that are easy to read and un-
derstand. You should avoid complicated marking systems
that are difficult to read, understand, recall, or are conducive
to numerical transposition. For example, markings such as
“2/24 oz” and “24/12 oz” are quantity-oriented coding em-
ploying numbers describing the quantity and size of the
inner packages. However, such numbers are easily reversed
or transposed, and are not intuitively understood.
If you incorporate these elements into your inventory systems,
you can expect:
  Decreased labor costs related to search time for product.
These search-time savings manifest themselves not only
when you search for an individual item, but most definitely
when product is located in multiple unspecified locations.
  Decreased labor costs associated with searching for appro-
priate storage locations.
  Elimination of the unnecessary purchase of items that are
already in the facility but are undiscovered when needed.
  Correct selection of SKUs during order filling.
  Correct selection of pack size(s) during order fulfillment.
81
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

All of the above lead to more accurate inventory tracking, less
wasted time to correct errors, and an increase in customer satis-
faction.
KEYS TO EFFECTIVELY TYING TOGETHER SKUs AND LOCATION
ADDRESSES
To keep track of where SKUs are at any given time, it is necessary
to:
  Clearly mark items with an SKU identifier.
  Clearly mark items with a unit of measure such as pack
size.
  Clearly mark location addresses on bins/slots/shelves/
racks/floor locations/drawers/and so on.
  Tie SKU numbers and location addresses together either in
a manual card file system or within a computerized database.
  Update product moves on a real-time basis with bar coding
coupled with radio frequency scanners (see Chapter 4, “Au-
tomatic Identification”).
Clearly Mark Items with an SKU Identifier; Clearly Mark Items
with a Unit of Measure
Too often, managers believe that workers can read and understand
a product’s markings and packaging. The end result of this belief
is error after error. To eliminate many of these identification mis-
cues, you need to clearly mark items with an identifying number
and a unit of measure. Workers will make far fewer errors match-
ing a number on a box to the same number on a piece of paper
than they will trying to match words or abbreviated descriptions.
The SKU identifier is generally an organization’s own internal
identifying code for the item, rather than a manufacturer’s or cus-
82
Essentials of Inventory Management

tomer’s number for that SKU. Although the SKU number itself is
often adequate for identification purposes, in manufacturing it may
be necessary to also include lot and serial numbers to aid in quality
control. Lot and serial numbers make it possible to track manufac-
turing batch, date, location, and inspector. Exhibit 3–12 reflects var-
ious methods of getting items actually labeled or marked.
Markings related to unit of measure (such as each/pair/
dozen/barrel/ounce/pound/cylinder/barrel/case) also serve to
greatly reduce error in picking and shipping.
83

Exhibit 3–12 Marking SKUs
By manufacturer
 Manufacturer prints or affixes plain, human readable
label on the item and/or a bar code label with coding on the
items. Manufacturer obtains labels or you provide them.

 Vendor from whom you obtain the product prints or
affixes your plain, human readable label on the item and/or
a bar code label with coding on the items. Manufacturer ob-
tains labels or you provide them.

 Everything comes through receiving—it is a natural
node. That convergence allows you the opportunity to affix
plain, human readable label on the item and/or a bar code
label with coding on the items.
 You can have all product that turns even once during
the year marked in this manner, with faster moving items (12
turns a year) all marked within a few weeks.

Clearly Mark Location Addresses on Bins/Slots/Shelves/Racks/Floor
Locations/Drawers
Just as you could not find a house in a city if its address was not
clearly identified, you cannot find a storage location unless its ad-
dress is clearly marked or easily discerned in some other manner.
The addressing or location system you choose should have an un-
derlying logic that is easy to understand. Addresses should be as
short as possible, yet they should convey all needed information.
You should first consider whether the system will be all nu-
meric, all alphabetic (alpha), or alpha-numeric. In deciding which
system to adopt, consider the following:
  All numeric systems require sufficient digit positions to
allow for future growth. Because each numeric position
only allows for 10 variations (0–9), numeric systems
sometimes become too lengthy. In other words, since a
single numeric position only allows 10 variations, if you
required 100 different variations (for 100 different SKUs),
you would need two digit positions, representing 00
through 99 (10 × 10). One thousand variations would
require three numeric positions, 000 through 999, and so
on. See Exhibit 3–13, Alpha-Numeric Variations.
84
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 3–13 Alpha-Numeric Variations
0  9 = 10
00  99 = 100
10 x 10 = 100
000  999 = 1,000
10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000
A  Z = 26
AA  ZZ = 676
26 x 26 = 676
AAA  ZZZ = 17,576
26 x 26 x 26 = 17,576

  Systems that are completely alphabetic allow for 26
variations per position, A through Z (assuming only
capital letters). Two alphas together, AA through ZZ 
(26 × 26), allow for 676 variations. Three alphas, AAA
through ZZZ, allow for 17,576 variations. See Exhibit
3–13, Alpha-Numeric Variations. Although alphas
provide numerous variations in a short address, systems
that are completely alphabetic are visually confusing
(HFZP).
  Alpha-numeric systems often provide for visual
differentiation while allowing sufficient variations in a
short address.
  Caution: While alpha systems require fewer characters to
hold the same number of variations, they are more error
prone. For example: Is that the number zero or the letter
O? A one or the letter l? A two or the letter Z? A P or an
R? A Q or an O? If you are only dealing with a computer
system, then characters are “cheap,” and you could use
only numerics to avoid confusion. However, if part of
your system will involve human-readable labels, placards,
or markings where a long string of numbers might
present a problem or where you are trying to keep a bar
code label short, you might have to balance out the merits
of shorter alpha-numeric systems against longer pure
numeric systems.
Exhibit 3–14 presents some common location addressing sys-
tems for racks or shelving. Exhibit 3–15 presents common location
addressing systems for bulk storage.
85
Physical Location and Control of Inventory

Tie SKU Numbers and Location Addresses Together
The placement of identifiers on both product and physical loca-
tions creates an infrastructure by which you can track product as
it moves. The next step is marrying together an SKU number and

complished by using a simple 3 × 5 card file system (which should
be computerized as soon as possible). See Exhibit 3–16.

Cards are marked with all SKU numbers. Cards will be
indexed in ascending number sequence—lowest SKU num-
ber in the front of the file box and the highest SKU number
appearing last. All locations and quantities for that specific
item are noted. As SKUs are added-to or moved, card file in-
formation is updated as often as possible. Updates should
occur at least twice daily, for example, during the lunch hour
and at the end of the workday.

Update Product Moves
A final step in managing inventory is tracking it as it is added to,
deleted, or moved. This challenge exists for any organization
whether or not the company uses manual tracking, computerized
approaches, or bar coding.
The best generally available approach for real-time tracking of
items as they move is using bar coding mobile scanners with radio
frequency (RF) capability. See Chapter 4, “Automatic Identification.”
If RF-capable bar coding is not available, then updating can be
accomplished as follows:
  Portable bar code scanners that capture the information
within the scanner mechanism or on a disk in the
scanner. The information is then uploaded into the
computerized database either through the
communications ports on the scanner and computer, or
by loading the scanner disk into the computer.
  Manually captured, paper-based information (see Exhibit
3-17) is entered into the database through keying (data
entry by a human being).
  Manually captured, paper-based information is manually
written onto file cards.

  No matter what method is used, it is imperative that
information relative to inventory additions, deletions, or
movement be inputted into the system as soon as
possible. To the greatest extent possible, the shelf count
(what is actually in the facility and where it is) should
match the record count (the amount reflected in the
main database records). The longer the time lag between
inventory movement and information capture and
updating of the record count, the greater the chance for
error, lost product, and increased costs.
Recap
Organizations should carefully consider specific item placement
within an overall location system to maximize each SKU’s accessi-
bility while being mindful of that item’s point-of-use,
unloading/loading ratio, relationship to similar items, or charac-
teristics requiring special handling.
Organizations lacking procedures that identify the location of
each SKU within the facility suffer from excessive labor costs,
“lost” product causing additional items to be purchased to cover
for those on-site but unavailable when required, poor customer
service, and general confusion. Controlling product location and
movement centers around establishing an overall locator system
that effectively reflects the organization’s basic inventory nature
such as finished goods in a retail/distribution environment or raw
materials and subassemblies in a manufacturing facility. Often le-
gitimate operational and storage objectives are in conflict with one
another, resulting in final location system decisions made on the
basis of a series of tradeoffs.
And finally, each item’s present location must be identified with
90

that SKU’s identifier, with address and quantity changes being up-
dated on an ongoing, timely basis.

AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION
E
rrors and time increase dramatically the more often a human
being is involved in identifying an object, inputting that infor-
mation into a database, and then modifying the knowledge to keep
track of changes in location, pack size, quantity, and so on.
The less you rely on human intervention to identify items,
input information, and track data, the more timely and accurate
your records will be. 
Automatic Identification (Auto ID) refers to a broad range of tech-
nologies that are used to help machines identify objects without the
need for a human being to key in the information. Auto ID is often
coupled with automatic data capture. These technologies include
bar codes, smart cards, voice recognition, some biometric technolo-
gies (retinal scans, for instance), optical character recognition, and
radio-frequency identification (RFID). One-dimensional, linear bar
coding is the most common method of automated inventory iden-
tification. In recent years, stacked symbologies, often called “2D sym-
bologies” consisting of a given linear symbology repeated vertically
in multiple and presented in various shapes, have evolved. Given the
large number of 2D symbologies and their rapidly changing prop-
erties, this chapter will only deal with one-dimensional, linear bar
coding—and with RFID.  

The Basics of Bar Coding
Bar coding, an optical method of achieving automatic identifica-
tion, is a major tool in capturing critical data quickly and accu-
rately. It relies on visible or invisible light being reflected off of a
printed pattern. The dark bars or dark areas within the pattern ab-
sorb light, and the intervening spaces or areas reflect light. The
contrasting absorption and reflection is sensed by a device that
“reads” this reflected pattern and decodes the information.
The time and dollar savings that would be realized if your or-
ganization could eliminate the time and errors noted above will
often pay for a bar coding system. The speed of information cap-
ture and the accuracy of bar coding are often sufficient reasons to
cost-justify installing bar coding within your operation.
Bar coding is not the only automated method of identifying
inventory. For example, there is also optical character reading, ma-
chine vision, magnetic stripe, surface acoustic wave, and radio-
frequency tags. See Exhibit 4–1.
Bar code systems generally consist of three components: the
code itself, the reading device(s), and the printer(s). The objective
of this chapter is to provide you with a working knowledge of (1)
elements of a bar code symbol; (2) the fundamentals of the more
commonly used linear bar code languages/symbologies in the in-
ventory control world; (3) printing and scanning (reading) basics;
and (4) some practical bar code applications.
Elements of a Bar Code Symbol
Why can you easily read the sentence, “Inventory control is fun?”
You can read that sentence because you recognize the alphabet and
understand the rules of grammar and sentence construction. A bar

How It Works
Numbers, letters, and
characters are printed in a
predetermined, standard
character style or font. Like a
bar code, the image is
illuminated and the reflection
is sensed and decoded. 
Cameras take pictures of
objects, encode, and send
them to a computer for
interpretation. 
A magnetic stripe, like those
on credit cards, is encoded
with information.
Data is encoded on a chip that
is encased in a tag. In response
to a radar pulse from a reader
with a special antenna, the tag
converts the pulse to an
ultrasonic acoustic wave. Each
tag is uniquely programmed so
that the resulting acoustic wave
has an amplitude matching the
chip’s code.The wave is
converted back to an
electromagnetic signal sent
back to the reader. 
Data is encoded on a chip that
is encased in a tag. In response
to a radar pulse from a reader
with a special antenna, a
transponder in the tag sends a
signal to the reader.

Structure of a 
Generic Bar Code Symbol
The entire pattern is called the “symbol.” Each bar or space is called
an “element.”
96
Essentials of Inventory Management

QUIET ZONE
Symbols can be read from left to right or right to left. A bar code
scanner (reader) must make a number of measurements to decode
the symbol accurately. The quiet zones on each side of the symbol
gives the scanner a starting point from which to start its measure-
ment.
START AND STOP CHARACTERS
For codes to be read from either direction or top to bottom or bot-
tom to top in a vertically oriented symbol, start and stop characters
tell the scanner where the message begins. It is customary for the
character on the left or at the top of the symbol to be the start char-
acter, and the one on the right or bottom to be the stop character.
DATA CHARACTERS
The data characters are the actual message within the code. These
can be letters of the alphabet, numbers, symbols (+, −, /, =), or a
combination of all three.
“X” DIMENSION
The narrowest bar or space in a bar code is called the “X” dimen-
sion. This width can run from 5 mils to 50 mils. A mil is one-thou-
sandth of an inch.
This width is very important because it determines how wide
97
Automatic Identification

98
Essentials of Inventory Management
each narrow and wide bar or space will be. The narrow bars/spaces
are a single “X” in width, while the wide bars/spaces can be two,
three, or four “Xs” wide. Therefore, an element (a bar or space) can
be a single “X” or several “Xs.”
The larger the “X” dimension of a symbol, the easier it is to read.
Symbologies: Bar Coding 
Structural Rules
Just as there are rules for how an English sentence is structured,
for the relationship of upper-case to lower-case letters, and for
punctuation, similar rules govern bar codes. These rules are set out
in a “symbology.” A symbology controls how information will be
encoded in a bar code symbol.
Just as there are different languages, such as French, English,
Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese, there are different
symbologies. Common symbologies found in the inventory world
are Code 39, Code 128, Interleaved 2 of 5, and UPC.
Symbologies are like typefaces with different character sets and
separate printing characteristics. Some symbologies only present
numbers. Some have numbers, upper-case alphabetics (A–Z), and
limited special characters. Others have both upper- and lower-case
alphabetics (A–Z, a–z), numbers, and a wide range of special char-
acters. Some symbologies only allow for a set number of characters
in a pattern, while others allow for variable-length messages.
DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYMBOLOGIES
Bar codes can either be discrete or continuous. Characters in a dis-
crete code start with a bar and end with a bar, and they have a space
between each character. Characters in a continuous code start with
a bar, end with a space, and have no gap between one character

and another. The primary significance of the difference is that a
discrete code is easier to print and read, but you can get more char-
acters per inch with a continuous code.
Which of the following is easier to read?
Symbologies Symbologies Symbologies Symbologies
The word on the far left is the most difficult to read but has the
greatest amount of information in the smallest amount of space,
which is a good thing on a bar code label with limited space avail-
able. The word on the far right is the easiest to read, would allows
for a more forgiving print job (for example, if the ink spread on
the label surface between each letter, we would still be able to read
it), but it takes up more space. Discrete symbologies are easier to
print and read, but they take up more space.
SYMBOLOGY SUMMARY
The rules of a particular symbology control are:
  Character set—which alphabetics, numbers, and special
characters are in the symbology?
  Symbology type—discrete or continuous? See Exhibit 4–2.
  Number of element widths—how many different “Xs” are
there in the wide bars/spaces?
  Fixed or variable lengths of characters in a pattern?
  Density—how many characters can appear per inch?
POPULAR SYMBOLOGIES FOUND IN THE
INVENTORY WORLD
Dozens of bar code symbologies exist. Many have failed in the mar-
ketplace because a large number of printer and scanner suppliers
will not support them. Others are owned by individual companies

that control and limit their use. Others have specialized uses, such
as Postnet, which is used by the U.S. Postal Service. Some are
widely supported and accepted in the inventory control world.

is the Universal Product Code (UPC). A very similar code, which
will eventually be interchangeable with UPC, is the European Ar-
ticle Numbering System (EAN).
The UPC symbology is highly structured and controlled, and
it is only used in general merchandise retailing. It is an all numeric,
fixed-length (11 characters) symbology. The UPC symbol is phys-
ically arranged into two halves. The left half has six numbers that
identify the manufacturer or packager. The right half identifies the
product. See Exhibit 4–3. You have to license the right to use the
UPC from the Uniform Code Council (UCC), an organization cre-
ated by the grocery industry.

Code 39
This symbology is the most widely used bar code in nonretail ap-
plications. It was first introduced in 1975.
Most stockkeepers will be able to find a Code 39 software to
interface with their existing application software systems. In other
words, you should be able to find a Code 39 bar code package that
will allow you to continue to use your existing in-house software,
numbering systems, and internal procedures.
Code 39 is sometimes referred to as “3 of 9 Code” because three
of the nine elements (bars or spaces) making up a Code 39 char-
acter are wide and the other six are narrow.
Code 39 was the first alpha-numeric symbology developed.
Among its most important features are:
  Entire alphabet in upper-case letters
  All numerics (e.g., 0 through 9)
  Seven special characters: −, ., *, $, /, +, %, and a character
representing a blank space
  Discrete symbology
  Allows variable-length symbols
  Allows two messages to be decoded and transmitted as
one (“concatenation”)
  Can be printed in a wide variety of technologies
  Although there are only 43 data characters in the basic
Code 39 set, by using certain characters as internal codes,
it is possible to encode all 128 ASCII (American Code of
102
Essentials of Inventory Management

Information Interchange) characters used by computers.
This feature is cumbersome and is not widely used.
  Self checking, which means a single printing defect
cannot cause an error where one character is mistaken for
another.
Code 128
This code, introduced in 1981, has many desirable features, such as:
  It uses three start codes to allow the encoding of all 128
ASCII characters without cumbersome procedures.
Therefore, you can use the entire alphabet in both upper-
and lower-case, all 10 numerics, and all special characters.
Each printed character can have one of three meanings.
  There is high data density and continuous symbology
that uses the least amount of label space for messages of
six or more characters.
  Tests have shown this to be a highly readable code with
high message integrity.
  Code 128 has become one of the two standard bar code
symbologies used to identify the contents of corrugated
boxes. (The other standard for corrugated shipping boxes
is Interleaved 2 of 5 symbology.)
  Code 128 allows for concatenation.
Which Symbology Is Right for Your Organization?
Each symbology has its strengths and weaknesses. There is no one
“right” bar code language that will fit every organization’s needs.
A starting point in reviewing appropriate symbologies actually
begins with your own industry. Has your industry selected a par-
ticular type of symbology? For example, the automotive industry
103
Automatic Identification

has been using Code 39 since 1980. You can obtain guidance from
trade associations in your industry segment.
The reason to start with a symbology accepted by your industry
is that direct application software and hardware will have been
written or created for the specific requirements of your business.
It is the old question, “Why recreate the wheel?”
If no symbology dominates your industry, then the real ques-
tions become, What do you want the system to do for you? and
How large is your budget?
Scanning Basics
Something has to read a bar code. That something is a scanner.
These electrooptical devices include a means of illuminating the
symbol and measuring reflected light.
A scanner projects a tiny spot of light that crosses the bar code
symbol and then measures the exact width of the bars and spaces.
The measurement is determined by the amount of reflectance off
of the dark and light bars and spaces. Software in either the scanner
or in a separate plug-in device then translates the visual (analog)
signal into a digital one that a computer can understand and then
decodes what symbology (language) it is reading and the message
contained in the pattern.
Light reflected is converted from an analog voltage (visual) for-
mat to a digital waveform for decoding.
The spot of light must not be larger than the “X” dimension
Spot of light

Essentials of Inventory Management

being used for that label or you will get misreads.
Scanners must be purchased so that they match the “X” dimen-
sion that will be used for printing labels or for printing directly
onto a surface.
Scanners can either be manual (where the user supplies the
scanning motion) or automatic (where the device provides the
scanning motion). See Exhibit 4–4.
PRINTING BASICS
Bar code printing can be done by the user on-site or by an off-site
third-party vendor.
On-site printing generally occurs close to where product is ei-
ther being received or shipped—its point-of-use.
Five basic on-site bar code print technologies are available: di-
rect thermal, thermal transfer, dot matrix impact, ink jet, and laser
(Xerographic). See Exhibit 4–5.
Off-site, commercial printers use a wide variety of printing
techniques.
See Chapter 3, Exhibit 3–13, for a discussion of methods to
affix bar code labels.
Scanner might believe that both
narrow bars are a single wide
element and that the space is
merely an ink void printing error.

It is far more important that you understand what you want to ac-
complish with bar codes than for you to understand all of the tech-
nical aspects of them.

All of the above can be given a bar code identifier.
Bar code labels and markings can be printed directly on forms,
boxes, the product itself, or on labels that are then affixed to forms,
boxes, items themselves, individual parts of items, and so on.
A quick and easy way to begin using bar codes is through the
use of scan boards or menu cards. A scan board or menu card is
merely a sheet of paper or heavier card stock that contains on it
information in both machine readable (bar code) and human
readable (plain alpha-numeric text) formats. See Exhibit 4–6 for
examples of common scan boards/menu cards.

Automatic Identification

people). It is a still emerging overall set of technologies with no, as
yet, universally accepted set of standards for label or tag layout,
software or hardware design. 
Although several methods of identification are available, the
most common is to store a serial number that identifies an object
and other information on a microchip. The microchip is attached
to an antenna (the chip and the antenna together are called an
RFID transponder, or an RFID tag). The antenna enables the chip
to transmit the identification information to a reader. The reader
converts the radio waves reflected back or sent from the RFID tag
into digital information that can then be passed on to computers
that can make use of it. See Exhibit 4–7. 
114
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 4–7 RFID Components
  Bar coding is seeing; RFID is hearing.
RFID TAG TYPES AND CLASSES
There are two basic types and five basic classes of RFID tags.
The basic types are:
  Passive Tags — operate without an internal battery
source. Electromagnetic waves sent from the reader
starts a current in the tag’s antenna, and the tag uses
that energy to respond to the reader. 
  Active Tags — powered by an internal battery and are
typically read/write devices.
The tag classes include:
  CLASS 0 (Read-Only Tags) — Very basic tag with a
minimum of data. Data is usually a simple Tag ID
stored only once into the tag during manufacture.

115
Automatic Identification
1. Bar code markings in both machine-readable and human-readable
form are placed on both the storage locations (shelves, racks, drawers,
bins) and on the product itself.
2. A counter equipped with a portable scanner:
a. Scans in the identity of
the SKU.
b. Enters the quantity
through a keypad on
the scanner. The record
count and shelf count
can be compared in a
variety of ways:
(1) The shelf count as
captured by the
scanner 
and
counter can be
transmitted 
into
the system by way
of radio frequency
at the time of information capture, or
it can be uploaded from the scanner at
a later time. The computer system
would then generate an exception re-
port of those items where the record
and shelf counts did not match.
(2) Scanners are small computers. Because of that they can con-
tain software allowing them to have the record count stored
within them. As the scanner reads the bar code and the
counter enters the quantity information, the scanner could
immediately compare the record count and shelf count. If
there was a discrepancy, the scanner could alert the counter
either through audible tones, flashing lights, or LED displays.
The counter could then immediately initiate a recount.

  CLASS 1 (Write Once Read Only [WORM]) — These types
of tags can be programmed by either the tag manufacturer
or by the user only once.
  CLASS 2 (Read Write) — With these tags data can be read
as well as written into the tag’s memory.
  CLASS 3 (Read Write with on-board sensors) — These are
active tags that contain sensors for recording parameters
like temperature, pressure, etc., and can record the readings
in tag memory.
  CLASS 4 (Read Write with integrated transmitters) — This
class of tag can communicate with each other without any
help from a reader.
The type of tag you use is dependent on how and why you’re
using RFID and the environment you’re going to be operating it
in. See Exhibit 4–8.
Bar Code versus RFID
Neither of these two technologies is necessarily better or worse than
the other. They have different applications, which sometimes over-
lap. You must look at your application and your financial and tech-
nological resources when deciding which technology will work best
for you — and, which you can afford both short and long term.
Only your imagination limits what you can use RFID for. Com-
mon uses include, but aren’t limited to:
  Asset tracking — tracking of assets in offices, labs, ware-
houses, pallets and containers in the supply chain, books
in libraries 
  Manufacturing — tracking of parts during manufacture,
tracking of assembled items

  People tracking — security tracking for entrance manage-
ment or security, baby tags in hospitals to manage access

  Retail — tracking grocery carts in supermarkets 
  Animal tracking — implanted RFID tags in animals for
tracking and linking the animal to food, location
  Time tracking — sports event timing to track athletes as
they start a race and pass the finish line, pickup and delivery

Exhibit 4–8 Tag Selection Considerations
 Data requirements — memory requirements, programma-
bility, etc., will be dependent on use (e.g., item, box, case, pal-
let, returns).
 Type of reader — readers available to support the tag in
question.
 Read speed — read speed will impact how long the tag has
to be within range of the reader.
 Read redundancy — the number of times a tag must be read
while in the reading area.
 Harsh environments — survivability and durability become
factors in environments with high moisture (steam), corro-
sive chemicals, and high heat or extreme cold.
 Recordation — use may require tags to contain sensors that
measure and record temperature, etc.
 Security — use may require tags to be capable of encryption.

RFID Item Identification
One of the characteristics of RFID is that specific items in the sup-
ply chain can be individually identified. This is accomplished
through a unique serial number. The dominant RFID code is the
Electronic Product Code™ (EPC). The unique serial number allows
inquiries to be made about an item wherever it is within the supply
chain. The most prevailing version of the EPC contains informa-
tion about the manufacturer, the type of object, and a specific serial
number that relates to the specific object being monitored. 
The EPC and all protocols and standards relating to it are over-
seen by EPCglobal, a not-for-profit joint venture set up by the Uni-
form Code Council, which licensed the EPC technologies
developed by the Auto-ID Center, and EAN International, the bar
code standards body in Europe. 
The Advantages of RFID
There are a number of advantages to RFID. See Exhibit 4–9. 
Basically, bar codes are line-of-sight technology. A scanner has
to “see” the bar code to read it. With RFID, tags can be read as long
as they are within range of a reader. Bar codes can’t see through
objects or other barriers between the scanner and the reader. Radio
waves, however, do travel through most barriers and are therefore
far more versatile. (Caution: Radio waves bounce off metal and are
absorbed by water at ultrahigh frequencies. Therefore, it’s harder
to RFID track metal objects or those with high water content.
RFID designers and manufacturers continue to work on overcom-
ing these issues.)

The Problems Associated with RFID
Although RFID providers continue to improve RFID delivery
mechanisms, configurations, and hardware and software, there are
a number of challenges associated with RFI.
119
Automatic Identification
BAR CODES
RFID
• Require a direct line of sight to the
printed barcode
Do not require a direct line of sight
to the printed barcode. Can be read
through most objects.
• Reading range generally up to 15
feet (depending on equipment)
Reading range up to approximately
300 feet (depending on equipment)
• Approximately a half second or
more to successfully complete a
read
Read rates up to 40 or more tags per
second
• Bar code labels are more
vulnerable. If a label is dirty, torn,
falls off, etc., it can’t be read.
RFID tags are more rugged because
they are in a plastic cover and can
even be embedded in a product
(further protecting it from external
forces)
• Barcodes have no read/write
capability. Once printed no new
information can be added. 
RFID tags can be read/write devices.
A RFID reader can communicate
with the tag and alter as much of the
information as the tag design will
allow. 
• Standard bar codes identify only the
manufacturer and product, not the
unique item (e.g., each widget is
identified the same as every other
identical widget — not that specific
widget).
RFID tags identify the specific object.
Exhibit 4–9 RFID Advantages 

LACK OF RFID STANDARDS
Because global standards are still being developed, different man-
ufacturers have implemented RFID in a variety of ways, Many of
these installations are “closed-loop” systems. In a nutshell, this
means that a company has implemented a system to track items
that never leave its own control using a certain proprietary tech-
nology. Therefore, a different organization that has implanted
RFID using a different RFID technology can’t read the tags that
were placed by the first company, and vice versa.
Many of the supply chain benefits of RFID are derived from
being able to track items as they move from one organization to
the next or, even, internationally. The lack of standardization frus-
trates those benefits.
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY
Cost continues to be a major consideration.
RFID readers typically cost hundreds of dollars. You must cal-
culate how many readers you would need to cover all of your lo-
cations.  Some companies would need hundreds, if not thousands,
of readers to cover all their factories, warehouses, and stores. 
RFID tags can also become expensive to the point of being cost
prohibitive. Even if a tag only cost 10 to 20 cents, imagine the ex-
pense of placing hundreds of thousands of them on an item that
only costs a few dollars.
SYSTEM DISRUPTION VULNERABILITY
Because RFID systems use the electromagnetic spectrum, they are
relatively easy to jam using energy at the right frequency. 
In addition, active RFID tags that use a battery to increase the
range of the system can be repeatedly interrogated to wear the bat-
tery down, resulting in system disruption. 
120
Essentials of Inventory Management

RFID READER COLLISION
When the signals from two or more readers overlap, reader colli-
sion occurs. The tag is unable to respond to simultaneous queries. 
Many systems use an anticollision protocol (also called a singulation
protocol) that enable tags to take turns in transmitting to a reader. 
RFID TAG COLLISION
Tag collision occurs when many tags are present in a small area
and are trying to send information simultaneously to the reader. 
RFID providers are developing systems that ensure that tags
respond one at a time.
SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND ETHICS PROBLEMS WITH RFID
  The contents of an RFID tag can be read in a pocket or
purse. Since RFID tags cannot tell the difference between
one reader and another and scanners are portable, RFID
tags in your pocket or purse can be read from a distance,
from a few inches to a few yards.  
  RFID tags are difficult to remove. RFID tags are difficult to
for consumers to remove, irritating them.
  RFID tags with unique serial numbers could be linked to
an individual credit card number
The Universal Product Code (UPC) implemented with bar
codes only allows each product type sold in a store to have a unique
number that identifies that product. However, all of that product
would have the same number — not a unique number for each
individual item. In an RFID system each individual item can have
its own number. With that type of a system in place, if an item is
scanned for purchase and is paid for, the RFID tag number for a
particular item could be associated with a credit card number.

Automatic Identification

Recap
The objective of this chapter was to provide you with an overview
of automated identification approaches including bar coding, var-
ious popular symbologies, basic bar code applications, and radio-
frequency identification.
The set of rules for how the bars and spaces of a bar code lan-
guage, its symbology, are arranged dictates how much and what
type of data can be displayed within a particular symbol. The lan-
guage that is most appropriate to your industry will be determined
by how much data and in what form that information must be dis-
played on your goods, inventory, or other materials.
RFID is a technology that has a wide array of potential uses.
Although there are real challenges in implementing an RFID sys-
tem, with proper implementation, RFID is a technology that can
improve your supply chain process—and your bottom line.
In applying automated identification to your system, you are
only limited by your imagination—and your wallet. Applications
can be simple ones involving bar code scan boards or can be com-
plex, utilizing laser scanners, radio frequency, and sophisticated
sharing of information throughout the system at the time of in-
formation capture.

PLANNING AND REPLENISHMENT
CONCEPTS
T
he objective of this chapter is to provide basic approaches to
forecasting inventory levels and to undertaking stock replen-
ishment. With the proper techniques, you will have the right item,
in the right quantity, at the right time, and in the right place.
Replenishment Costs
As discussed in Chapter 2, every day that an item remains in your
stockroom costs you money in the form of a carrying cost (K Fac-
tor). If you take that concept to its extreme, it would make sense
to only buy items exactly when you need them. Multiple smaller
quantity purchases of the same item certainly hold down your car-
rying costs. However, it hurts your cost of replenishment—the ex-
penses associated with buying things.
It costs money to buy things. That sounds absurdly simple when
you first read it. However, the cost of purchasing product exceeds
the actual price paid for it. Expenses related to purchasing include
the salaries of the purchasing staff, rent, and other overhead ex-
penses attributable to the purchasing department. See Exhibit 5–1.

In fact, the more often you buy, the greater your internal costs.
For example, if you purchased one million widgets all at the same
time, your purchasing or replenishment cost (R Factor) would be
126
Essentials of Inventory Management
Exhibit 5–1 Calculating the R Factor
The cost of replenishment is calculated on a per item, per
order basis. This is because it takes the same amount of internal
effort to determine how much of each item you desire, from
which supplier, at what pricing, terms, and so on, no matter
which item is being considered and no matter how many items
there are on any given PO. Therefore, if the R Factor is $5.00
per item, per order, and there is a single line item on an order,
the replenishment cost is $5.00. If there are two items, it’s
$10.00. If there are three items, it’s $15.00, and so on.1
To calculate the cost of replenishment, include:
Annual cost of purchasing department labor 
$220,000
Annual cost of purchasing department overhead 
(rent, utilities, equipment allocation, etc.) 
$179,000
Annual cost of expediting stock items 
$25,000
Total annual costs 
$424,000
Number of purchase orders created per year

per order (assume):

the cost per line item per purchase order (PO). See Exhibit 5–1.
  If the per line, per PO cost is $5.00, then your cost to buy
all one million widgets at one time would be $5.00.
  If you were to buy the same one million widgets 250,000 at
a time, then your R Factor would be $5.00 times four (four
POs with one line item each) or $20.00.
  If you purchased the widgets one at a time, the cost would
be one million times $5.00 or $5 million.
Order size versus frequency of purchase shifts the cost burden
from the K Factor to the R Factor and vice versa. In other words:
  If you buy smaller quantities more often, your purchasing
costs go up, which means your R Factor increases.
  If you buy larger quantities less often, you have a higher in-
ventory level for a longer period of time, so your carrying
costs go up, which means your K Factor increases.
  In a perfect world the K Factor and the R Factor would be
equal. Although this is difficult to achieve, an organization
attempting to have the correct amount of product at the
overall lowest cost will strive for that balance.
Types of Inventory Management
In the worlds of distribution, retailing, and replacement parts, an
organization deals with finished goods. In the manufacturing
world, an organization deals with raw materials and subassemblies.
Considerations of what to buy, when to buy it, in what quantities,
and so on are dramatically different in these two worlds.
In distribution, you are concerned with having the right item
in the right quantity. Issues relating to having the item at the right
time and place are often dealt with by simply increasing safety

Essentials of Inventory Management
Case Study: Balancing Carrying and
Replenishment Costs
A dispute has arisen at the Charmax Co. between the pur-
chasing and warehouse managers. 
Charmax’s receiving ends at 5:00 PM. At 4:45 PM, a 40-foot
trailer is backed up to the dock. The doors are opened to re-
veal three levels of floor-stacked boxes extending from floor
to ceiling, back to front.
Joe, the warehouse manager, realizes that it will take four
workers at least two hours to hand unload the trailer. Virtu-
ally all of that time will be on an overtime basis. 
Joe reviews the truck’s manifest and determines what
items on the trailer are needed for delivery tomorrow morn-
ing. He discovers that there are only three boxes on the trailer
that are truly required for tomorrow’s business. He asks Tracy,
the truck driver, if he helped to load the trailer. Tracy replies
that he did. Joe asks if Tracy remembers where those three
boxes are. With a smile, Tracy replies that they are located in
the nose of the trailer. 
Joe decides not to incur the overtime. He will have the
trailer unloaded in the morning. 
Betty, the sales manager, hears that the three items will not
be shipped to Acme, a large and important customer. She storms
into the warehouse and demands that the trailer be unloaded.
Joe explains the overtime situation. Betty replies that Joe
should have scheduled the trailer to arrive earlier in the day.
Joe replies that the buyer, Bill, handles traffic management as
part of the purchase of the product. Betty angrily says she
doesn’t much care. Joe had told her that the product would
be here today for delivery tomorrow. “You promised me,”
Betty says, “so that’s what I promised the customer. Now un-

129
Planning and Replenishment Concepts
load the trailer.” Joe reluctantly does so.
Later, Joe confronts Bill and demands that product be
brought in palletized or unitized or in some other manner so
it can be unloaded quickly. Joe argues that since internal han-
dling is a major component in computing the cost of carrying
inventory, unitization will help cut Charmax’s costs.
Bill responds that he has to buy the product as he is buying
it now. He argues that to palletize the product would increase
the costs per unit of product. He also points out that since the
product already extends to the top of the trailer, that the added
height of three levels of pallets at approximately four inches each,
would force him to buy less per order so that it will all fit on a
trailer. Therefore, he will have to buy less and buy it more often,
driving up his replenishment costs. Ill-will and stalemate result.
Suggested Solutions:
1. Joe and Bill should coordinate traffic management so that
loads match the labor, equipment, time resources, and con-
straints of the organization. By lowering handling costs the
company will reduce overall carrying costs. 
2.  Both Joe and Bill need to specifically determine their re-
spective costs.
(a) Joe can determine the handling portion of the K Fac-
tor by:
(1) Determining the average time it takes to hand
unload a trailer.
(2) Multiplying the average hand unloading time
times the number of trailers during the year.
(3) Multiplying the total hand unloading time times
the average hourly labor rate being paid the ware-
house personnel.

stock on hand. That is not a good solution because it leads to
wasted money and space. However, traditional formulae used to
compute inventory requirements in a distribution environment
focus on item and quantity rather than place and time. In manu-
facturing, you are concerned with having the right item, in the
right quantity, at the right time, in the right place.

times the number of trailers during the year.
(6) Multiplying the total unitized unloading time
times the average hourly labor rate being paid the
warehouse personnel.
(7) Comparing the annual labor costs involved for
hand unloading to the annual labor costs of unit-
ized unloading to determine the total dollar sav-
ings.

sociated with smaller loads purchased more often.
(c) A fair comparison can then be made as to which
route is the most advantageous for the overall organ-
ization.
3. Alternatives meeting the needs of both parties might be de-
veloped. For example, if slip-sheets (thin cardboard or ply-
wood sheets the same length and width as a pallet) were used,
Bill might be able to overcome the size of load and volume
problem, while Joe could automate the unloading process.

are said to be “independent,” while demand for items in the man-
ufacturing world are said to be “dependent.” Understanding these
distinctions will assist you in forecasting your procurement needs. 
Independent demand is influenced by market conditions outside
the control of your organization’s operations. The demand for the
widgets your organization sells will be independent of the demand
for your gadgets, doodads, and whatchamacallits. Your products
are independent of one another. In this environment, you must
have the right item in the right quantity.
Dependent demand is related to another item. The demand for
products built up or created from raw materials, parts, and assem-
blies is dependent on the demand for the final product. You would
not need one item if you did not also require another, both of
which would go into an assembly or finished product. In this en-
vironment, you must have the right items in the right quantities
at the time to complete a finished product.
A chair can be used as an example. The demand for the num-
ber of chairs you need is independent from the number of tables
that you need because quantity required is influenced by the de-
mand in the market for each item. The demand for chair legs or
seats or rails is mathematically dependent on the demand for fin-
ished chairs. Four legs and one seat are required for each chair.
Dependent and independent demands demonstrate very dif-
ferent use and demand patterns.
Independent demand calls for a replenishment approach to in-
ventory management. This approach assumes that market forces
will exhibit a somewhat fixed pattern. Therefore, stock is replen-
ished as it is used in order to have items on hand for customers.
Dependent demand calls for a requirements approach. When
an assembly or finished item is needed, then the materials needed
to create it are ordered. There is no fixed pattern because an as-
131
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

sembly created in the past may never be produced again.
The nature of demand, therefore, leads to different concepts,
formulae, and methods of inventory management.
INDEPENDENT DEMAND INVENTORY
Since items in an independent demand inventory system “stand
alone,” the appropriate reorder point for each item must be calcu-
lated using order-point formulae.
Order-Point Formulae
Order-point formulae are used to determine how much of a given
item needs to be ordered where there is independent demand. In
these formulae, a reorder point (ROP) is set for each item. The
ROP is the lowest amount of an item you will have on hand and
on order before you reorder.
A Simple Min-Max Inventory System
Order-point formulae are based on some relatively simple con-
cepts.
Imagine that all of a particular SKU are kept in a single bin. If
no reorder point was set, then the entire batch would be used up
without any order being placed. The organization would then be
unable to sell or use that item during whatever timeframe—was
required to order and bring the SKU in the lead time. It would
therefore make sense to adopt a two-bin system, with Bin 1 con-
taining working stock and Bin 2 containing working reserve. The
amount of product in Bin 2 would be equal to your usage rate dur-
ing that item’s lead time.
In a two-bin system, if all goes as it should, then immediately
on using the first item from Bin 2, you would reorder a quantity
equal to both Bins 1 and 2. As you use the last item in Bin 2, the
132
Essentials of Inventory Management

order arrives and you refill both bins. This assumes that lead time
is exact, there are no vendor stockouts or backorders, and that there
are never any defects. That assumption is, of course, often false.
Therefore, a true order-point system is a three-bin system, with
Bin 3 containing safety stock.
Bin 3, safety stock, relates to Bin 2 since Bin 3 is to make up for
uncertainties in lead time and defects. Mathematically safety stock
is 50 percent of working reserve. (The average between having
nothing in Bin 2 and having it at 100 percent full is 50 percent.)
However, companies adjust safety stock levels to coincide with
their actual experience.
Bins can be mathematically created or can reflect actual phys-
ical separation of items in the stockroom.
A simple formula for determining the ROP reflects the above
concepts.
(Usage x Lead Time) + Safety Stock = ROP
In the above formula lead time is shown as a percentage of a
month, as follows:
1 week    = 0.25  = 25%                    4 weeks  = 1.00   = 100%
2 weeks   = 0.50   = 50%                    5 weeks  = 1.25   = 125%
3 weeks   = 0.75   = 75%                    6 weeks  = 1.50   = 150%
Example 1
Assumptions:

 Lead time of 3 weeks
Step-by-Step Calculation:

Essentials of Inventory Management

The ROP is the “minimum” (min) in a “minimum-maximum”
(min-max) inventory control system. In these systems there is a
minimum below which you will not let your stock level fall, and
there is a maximum above which you will not have items on hand
or on order.
To compute the maximum in these systems, you must first de-
termine how often you will place orders. This time period is called
the review cycle.
The review cycle is the length of time between reviews of when
you wish to order product. The formula to determine the review
cycle is:
Total Purchases from
Vendor for a Year   
= Review Cycle
_______________
Discount Quantity
The unit of measure reflecting total purchases from a vendor
can be dollars, pieces, pounds, units, or whatever your organization
uses. The discount quantity is the minimum amount you have to
order of that unit of measure in order to be granted a discount.
Review Cycle Example
200,000
= Review Cycle
________
5,000
And, dividing 40 reviews by 52 weeks equals a review
roughly every 1.3 weeks. When the review actually occurs

will also depend on factors such as seasonality.
The maximum in these systems is also represented by a simple
formula.
ROP + Usage During the Review Cycle = Maximum
By setting a min-max for each item in your inventory, you can
create a simple method of ordering products having independent
demand.
ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY FORMULA
In 1915, F. W. Harris of General Electric developed the Economic
Order Quantity (EOQ) formula to help stockkeepers in determin-
ing how much product to buy.
To calculate EOQ, assume:
A = Total Value of SKU Per Year
K = Carrying Cost (the K Factor)
R = Replenishment Cost (the R Factor)
Maximum Point Example 1:
Assume:
s Usage rate of 1,200 items per
month
s Review cycle every 1.3 weeks
s ROP equals 1,350 items
300 items x 1.3 weeks 
= 390 items used during 
review cycle
1,350 items + 390 items 
= 1,740 items max
Maximum Point Example 2:
Assume:
s Usage rate of 1,200 items per
month
s Review cycle every 1.3 weeks
s ROP equals 450 items
300 items x 1.3 weeks 
= 390 items used during 
review cycle
450 items + 390 items 
= 840 items max

P = Price Per Unit
Basic Formula
This formula and its variations allow you to determine the fol-
lowing:
  Optimal quantity to order
  When it should be ordered
  Total cost
  Average inventory level
  How much should be ordered each time
  Maximum inventory level
The EOQ model is based on several assumptions:
  The demand rate is constant (no variations), recurring,
and known.
  The carrying cost and ordering cost are independent of
the quantity ordered (no discounts).
  The lead time is constant and known. Therefore, the
ordering times given result in new orders arriving exactly
when the inventory level reaches zero.
  The formula can handle only one type of item at a time.
  Orders arrive in a single batch (no vendor stockouts or
backorders).
A simple example of the basic formula is:
A = $36,000
K = 15%

DEPENDENT DEMAND INVENTORY
Materials Requirements Planning
Controlling not only what item is purchased and in what quanti-
ties, but also the timing of its arrival through computerized sys-
tems is called materials requirements planning (MRP). This concept
of the right item, in the right quantity, and at the right time was
first introduced by Joseph Orlicky in the early 1960s.
Independent demand inventory management is customer ori-
ented. The objective of ROP rules and formulae is high customer
service levels and low operating costs. Dependent demand systems,
however, are manufacturing oriented. The objective of dependent
demand inventory control is to support the master production
schedule. Even if you have a low stock level of an item, it won’t be
ordered unless and until it is needed to produce something for the
master schedule—a true requirements philosophy of inventory
control. MRP-dependent demand inventory control is directed in-
ward rather than outward like ROP inventory control. See Exhibit
5–3.
139
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

MRP Elements. Key concepts in understanding MRP are the
master production schedule and the bill of materials.
The master production schedule sets out what will be built,
when, and in what quantities. It can either cover short or long time
horizons.
Short horizon—planning of initial requirements sets out:
  Final product requirements
  Schedule for production of components
  Purchase order priorities
  Short-term capacity requirements

Long horizon—estimating long-term requirements sets out:

  Long-term staffing required
  Long-term money required
The bill of materials (BOM) is the recipe of raw materials, parts,
subassemblies, and so on required to build or make something.
Each BOM has levels. See Exhibit 5–4 and Exhibit 6–1 on page
175 for a discussion of how inventory is relieved from stock after
each level of the BOM is completed. This is a technique called
“backflushing.”
MRP’s chief advantage over the ROP approach is that it lets
you customize your ordering strategy for raw materials, parts, and

so on with different demand characteristics, such as lead times.
The ROP approach answers the questions of what and how much:
On Hand            60     or      60
On Order           100              50

Available             30               -20
ROP does not answer the question of when:
On Hand          60                      or   60
On Order         100 due in          50 due on

Available                         10 on Nov. 5th
when needed  –70          –20 on Nov. 15th
MRP allows purchases to be made as and when needed to en-
sure that items will arrive when needed. It accomplishes this by
setting up time phasing charts within the computer system. See
Exhibit 5–5.
An example of MRP would be a decision to build one bar stool
in your garage on Saturday.
The decision to build a single unit of something on a given day
is the master schedule.
Included in your thinking was the fact that if you had all of the
pieces, parts, and tools necessary, you could actually accomplish
the task. That is rough-cut capacity planning. See Exhibit 5–6.
You then draw-up and define what parts are required for the
task. See Exhibit 5–4. This is your bill of materials.

production will bring our balance of inventory on hand to
zero.

The above charts demonstrate that by timing the release of
the PO for a specific item, that item can be brought in only
when needed. This holds our inventory levels down.

Essentials of Inventory Management
The next step is a parts explosion, during which you review
your on-hand inventory levels to initially determine if any POs
must be prepared and released.
You then engage in detailed capacity planning to decide if you
can proceed or if the master schedule, capacity, or the planned re-
lease of POs must be changed.
Ultimately, all parts, equipment, and so on come together and
the stool is built.
MRP works well because it is a forward-looking system. The
predictability of events allows for careful planning and a reduction

in unnecessary inventory.
A major drawback of MRP and JIT systems is that they are
highly data dependent. Not only do you have to have all of the data
easily available on an ongoing basis, but, in addition, the informa-
tion must be accurate and timely. Organizations lacking a strong
software/hardware infrastructure will have difficulty in fully im-
plementing an MRP system.
Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory Systems
JIT was first developed within Toyota’s manufacturing operations
by Taiichi Ohno in the 1970s as a means of meeting customer de-
mands with minimum delay. In its original form, it referred to the
production of goods, assemblies, and subassemblies to meet ex-
actly the customer’s demand in terms of time, quality, and quan-
tity. With a JIT system, the “buyer” can be the actual end user or
another process along the production line.
JIT goes further than MRP, because you control not only the
right item, in the right quantity, at the right time, but you also
bring that SKU to the right place. Under this time-based concept,
an item appears exactly when it is needed—not before, not after.
The American Production and Inventory Control Society
(APICS) has the following definition of JIT:
. . . a philosophy of manufacturing based on planned elimination of all
waste and continuous improvement of productivity. It encompasses the
successful execution of all manufacturing activities required to produce
a final product, from design engineering to delivery and including all stages
of conversion from raw material onward. The primary elements include
having only the required inventory when needed; to improve quality to
zero defects; to reduce lead time by reducing setup times, queue lengths
and lot sizes; to incrementally revise the operations themselves; and to
accomplish these things at minimum cost.
145
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

The many benefits of a JIT system include:
  Reduction of stockouts
  Reduction of inventory levels
  Reduction of need for material handling equipment
  Reduction of timeframes between delivery and
production
  Significant quality improvement
  Employee inclusion in continuous quality improvement
JIT is a management philosophy rather than a technique.
The fact that certain words and acronyms have come to be used
somewhat interchangeably can be confusing to anyone not in the
manufacturing world. Do those terms/acronyms have individual,
stand-alone characteristics differentiating one from the other?
Most certainly they do, but grappling with the details of what sep-
arates one particular type of manufacturing philosophy from an-
other closely related theory won’t further your understanding of
the basic concepts of inventory management and control.
The terms/acronyms MRP III, Computer-Integrated Manufac-
turing, Lean Manufacturing, Short-Cycle Manufacturing, Just-in-
Time, JIT, Enterprise Resource Planning, ERP, and so on all relate
to the fundamental notions that:
  Manufacturing activities should be integrated.
  The actions and decisions of each department should
complement all other departments.
  Information should flow both internally throughout the
organization and externally to/from suppliers/customers
electronically rather than through:
 The movement of hard paper copies, or
 Individual software (accounting) modules whose data
146
Essentials of Inventory Management

do not flow into one another both automatically and in
real time.
  Suppliers are reliable and raw materials are without
defect.
  All employees follow the philosophy of continuous
quality improvement in all aspects of the operation.
Let’s concentrate on how these concepts—by whatever name—
relate to inventory. They all regard inventory as waste.
Today JIT has come to mean producing with a minimum of
waste. “Waste” is used in the broadest sense and includes any non-
value-adding activities. For example, storing, inspecting, and
counting materials doesn’t change the items; therefore, those ac-
tions add no value. There are seven types of waste JIT systems
strive to eliminate:
1. Overproduction—producing more than needed. Wasted
money, effort, space, etc.
2. Waiting time—decreases productivity and efficiency.
3. Transportation-double and even triple handling of an
item from one storage position to another.
4. Processing—what are the interfaces between parties, de-
partments, you, and your suppliers? The fewer and faster
the better.
5. Inventory—stock simply sitting around does no one any
good.
6. Motion—reduce motions such as those involved in look-
ing for materials.
7. Defects—defective goods not only cost money directly,
but they also cause stops and delays.
147
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

Implementing JIT. Take the following steps to introduce a JIT-
type system into your manufacturing facility:
1. Stabilize and level the production schedule.
 All work centers should have a uniform load through
constant daily production.
 Prevent changes in the production plan for some pe-
riod of time.
 Produce roughly the same mix of products each day,
using a repeating sequence if several products are pro-
duced on the same line. This is often called “mixed
model assembly.”
 Change the quantity of end-item inventory to meet
demand fluctuations rather than through fluctuations
in production levels.
2. Reduce or eliminate setup times.
 Strive to create single-digit setup times (less than 10
minutes).
3. Reduce lot sizes (manufacturing and purchase).
 Reducing setup times allows economical production
of smaller lots.
 Close cooperation with suppliers is necessary to
achieve reductions in order lot sizes since more fre-
quent deliveries will be called for. In JIT systems, the
old, adversarial methods of purchasing will not work.
In traditional approaches, buyers buy an item here and
another item there through a series of disconnected
negotiations over price, delivery quality, and terms. In
JIT systems, larger quantities and types of items are
purchased from fewer vendors. The larger purchases
148
Essentials of Inventory Management

give the buyer more economic leverage while provid-
ing the supplier with enough financial incentive to be-
come the buyer’s business partner. Both parties
recognize the critical needs, costing, pricing, quality
concerns, and so on of the other.
4. Reduce lead times (production and delivery).
 Production lead times can be reduced by:
– Moving workstations closer together.
– Applying group technology and cellular manufac-
turing concepts.
– Reducing the number of jobs waiting to be
processed at a given machine (“queue” length).
– Improving the coordination and cooperation be-
tween successive processes, such as reducing deliv-
ery times by inducing suppliers to have distribution
centers/warehouses closer to your operation.
5. Engage in strong preventive maintenance.
 Machine and worker idle time should be used to
maintain equipment and prevent breakdowns.
6. Cross-train to create a flexible workforce.
 Workers should be trained to:
– Operate several machines.
– Perform maintenance tasks.
– Perform quality inspections.
7. Require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero-
defects quality program.
 Since there are no buffers of safety stock, errors lead-
ing to defective items must be eliminated.
149
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

8. Use a control system such as a kanban (card) system to con-
vey parts between workstations in small quantities (ideally,
one unit at a time).
INVENTORY OBJECTIVES
Inventory in and of itself is not waste. Unnecessary inventory is
waste. A key question is: What is unnecessary in the context of your
organization?
In manufacturing operations, inventory in excess of that
needed to support current operations or research and development
efforts would certainly be waste. However, is the inventory of a dis-
tributor that uses immediate availability of a large cross-section of
items as an effective, profitable marketing tool “unnecessary?”
Your company should have a “zero-tolerance” inventory policy.
That is, it will not accept any inventory over a stated target. But
what is the target? Is it zero-tolerance from a days’ supply of in-
ventory on hand? Is it a zero-tolerance from a dollars-invested
standpoint (turns per year)? Is it zero-tolerance from an order fill
rate of 97 percent?
For an organization to actually have useful inventory, it must
understand its own objectives for the product it will have on hand,
on-order, or in-transit at any one time. What inventory level is re-
quired for your organization to profitably and effectively operate?
Until the answers to these questions are determined, it will be
difficult to get everyone within the organization to work toward
the common, shared goal of eliminating inventory waste.

A significant way for any organization to pull together all of the
diverse elements of information it needs to more effectively acquire
150
Essentials of Inventory Management

and control inventory is to use enterprise resource planning. En-
terprise resource planning (ERP) is an integrated computer-based
information system that is used to manage both internal and ex-
ternal resources serving all departments within an enterprise, as
shown in Exhibit 5–7. 
Because different departments within a company have different
functions and needs—for instance, the particular interests and
needs of a company’s finance department are certainly different
than those of its human resources, production planning and op-
erations, warehousing, sales, and other departments—it’s typical
for each department to have software systems, information flows,
and operations optimized for the ways that department works.
In addition, because information generally moves through the
system at different speeds than the physical movement of inven-
tory, there are often significant disconnects in who knows what,
when they know it, and what they do with it. (See Chapter 1 for a
discussion of inventory as both a tangible and intangible item.)
ERP involves the use of packaged software rather than propri-
etary software written by or for one customer. With this software,
which integrates all departments and functions of a company into
a single, integrated computer system that runs off a single database,
one department is able to “see” the information contained in an-
other department. This allows all departments within a company
to share information more easily and to communicate with each
other more effectively. 
Integrated ERP software is divided into software modules that
roughly approximate the old stand-alone systems, such as manu-
facturing, order entry, accounts receivable and payable, general
ledger, purchasing, warehousing, transportation, and human re-
sources. Departments get the equivalent of their former stand-
alone system, however, now the modules are linked so that
151
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

someone in accounting can see if an order has been shipped, and
the sales department can determine when an item will be available
for sale or use.
Most ERP vendors’ systems are flexible enough to allow, with
varying degrees of effort, modules to interface with an organiza-
tion’s own software and, depending on the software, ERP modules
may be alterable by the enterprise itself. Many companies only in-
stall one or two ERP modules at a time rather than trying to install

everything at once.
The benefits of installing ERP can be tremendous. Imagine the
efficiencies gained if a salesperson can immediately know the credit
limits of a customer from the finance module as well as if the ware-
house has in stock the items that customer wants from the ware-
house module, and so on.
The five main reasons organizations implement ERP are:
1. Integration of financial information—all business units
use the same set of metrics.
2. Integration of customer order information—customer
information is available to all business units on a real-
time basis.
3. Standardization of manufacturing processes—standard-
ization of processes leads to operating efficiencies.
4. Reduction of inventory—excess inventory is held to a
minimum.
5. Standardization of human resources information—uni-
formity of information and access leads to better admin-
istration.
Actually implementing an ERP system can be expensive, time
consuming, and difficult. 
One of the greatest challenges to ERP implementation isn’t so
much the installation of the software itself, it’s getting employees
to actually change the way they perform their jobs in order to con-
form to standardized procedures. Unless you are willing to under-
take a focused training program together with sustained managerial
vigilance, you may not want to attempt the effort at all.
Unless your organization is relatively small, you should count
on the installation and implementation of an ERP program to in-
volve at least one year of effort. This minimum timeframe reflects
153
Planning and Replenishment Concepts

the reality of factors such as installation, data conversion, data analy-
sis, training, integration and testing, customization, add-ons, etc. 
Recap
Organizations establish techniques for forecasting their product-
level needs based on the nature of the demand characteristics of
those items.
Formulae for ensuring that you have the right item, in the right
quantity, in the right place, at the right time can range from rela-
tively simple min-max models to highly sophisticated computer-
dependent systems.
For individuals not directly involved in purchasing, successful
inventory control doesn’t so much flow from actually using the
various formulae, but rather from understanding what outcomes
are supposed to result from their use.
ERP systems allow more efficient and effective operations
throughout an enterprise by allowing all departments to have ac-
cess to one another’s data and information on a real-time basis.

WHY INVENTORY SYSTEMS FAIL
AND HOW TO FIX THEM
T
he objective of this chapter is to provide you with an under-
standing of the nature of inventory accuracy and the working
tools to “fix” your inventory system. If all items are moving
through a properly operating system, then it doesn’t matter what
the characteristics of an SKU are—expensive item, inexpensive
item, fast mover, slow mover, long lead time, critical—the shelf
count of the item (actual balance on-hand stock levels) and record
count (how many your records say are supposed to be here) will
match.
The traditional method of determining if actual balance on-
hand stock levels match book/record levels is to take an annual
physical inventory. As a method of correcting inventory accuracy
problems, this costly and time-consuming effort is riddled with de-
ficiencies. Why? Consider the following:
  Accuracy is often defined in dollars rather than in actual
physical units. As discussed in Chapter 1, the dollar value of
product does not reflect exactly what items are in-house.
For example, imagine you sent out a thousand cases of
peaches to a customer rather than the thousand cases of

pears actually requested. An annual inventory would reflect
an overall dollar value roughly equal to whatever it would
have been even if the correct item had been shipped. There-
fore, our shelf count is off a thousand over for one SKU and
a thousand under for another with no discrepancy in accu-
racy—if accuracy is measured in dollars.
  Misidentification of product. As discussed in Chapter 3,
product within a facility is misidentified for a variety of rea-
sons. During annual inventories, misidentification often oc-
curs because inexperienced counters assisting with the effort
do not recognize items, misunderstand package descrip-
tions, and so on.
  Misidentification of units of measure. Incorrect quantities
are often written down during annual inventories because
counters simply do not understand an SKU’s pack size, pack
size descriptions, or abbreviations on packaging.
  Discrepancies “adjusted away.” Perhaps the greatest problem
with using the annual inventory as a method for establishing
accuracy is that it provides no method for backtracking
through physical and paper transactions to determine why
an item’s shelf count and its record count do not agree—a
12-month time period is simply too long of an audit trail.
Consequently, if the reason for a discrepancy cannot be im-
mediately found during the inventory, an adjustment is
made with the underlying cause of the error never being
corrected.
At the end of an annual inventory, after all of the adjustments
have been made and after the lights have been turned off, you have
an inventory shelf and record count that agree. At least they agree
until the next morning when the same system that spawned the
158
Essentials of Inventory Management

discrepancies found during the effort reasserts itself and a new
group of errors is born.
Albert Einstein, the famous physicist, once said, “A problem
stated is a problem half-solved.” Modern business writers like Peter
Drucker have expressed a similar view, “A problem analyzed is a
problem half-solved.” The sentiment expressed in these sayings, that
reviewing the nature of inventory problems is a key step in solving
them, provides you with a good starting point in resolving your
own inventory-related issues. 
Inventory System Failure: 
A Case Example
The following events in this inventory system failure case example
have been numbered for ease of reference. The events described in
the case example characterize common misunderstandings be-
tween different operating units within an organization, as well as
timing and sequencing disconnects in inventory movement and
information capture that cause inventory systems to fail. The case
example is followed by a discussion and explanation of each of the
events described.
1. Big Hammer, Inc., manufactures and distributes widgets. Man-
ufacturing occurs at its Los Angeles, CA, plant. It distributes
from two separate locations. One of these locations is in Kansas
City, MO, and has been part of Big Hammer for many years.
The other location is in New York, NY, and is the surviving por-
tion of Paulex Co., a distribution company just purchased by
Big Hammer.
2. Marc, Big Hammer’s president, has just reviewed operating re-
ports from all three locations and is upset. It seems that the in-
ventory accuracy level at all three locations is off. The end result
159
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

is delayed production, too much inventory, and poor customer
service. In addition, various department heads in all three lo-
cations clash with one another. To straighten everything out,
he hires the consulting firm of Alana, Eric, and Shawn.
3. Alana goes to KC. Eric goes to NY. Shawn goes to LA.
4. The trio immediately discovers that NY is using a different soft-
ware system than LA and KC. In addition, the LA/KC software
was designed for distribution, not manufacturing. However,
some modifications have been made to the LA/KC software to
help with manufacturing applications.
5. The NY system allocates inventory on a real-time basis. In other
words, as a pick ticket is generated for an item, the quantity in
question is allocated to a specific order and is not available for
any other customer—its paper life ceases.
6. The LA/KC system is a batch system. Items are relieved from
stock at the time the system is updated. This usually occurs once
per day when billing is done. A modification to the system back-
flushes1 some items out of stock during the manufacturing cycle.
7. Eric wanders around the NY location and observes the following:
7A. Salespeople, customer service personnel, clerical staff,
and others freely roam through all stockrooms. Eric no-
tices that some nonstockroom personnel fill their own
orders, grab samples for customers, and put things back
into the facility that they have previously removed.
7B. Eric observes that some of these individuals document
their actions immediately, while others document noth-
ing, and others turn in necessary paperwork—later.
7C. Eric observes Sally, a salesperson, peering intently at her
computer screen. He hears her utter an oath and declare
out loud, “I just saw a whole bunch of SKU #1234 out
160
Essentials of Inventory Management

there a little while ago.” She then creates a manual invoice
within the software system, prints it, walks out into the
stockroom, fills the order she has just created, delivers it
to customer Acme Widgets of the World, and later drops
the signed delivery copy on the desk of her accounts re-
ceivables clerk.
7D. Eric observes an angry exchange between the warehouse
manager and the accounting manager of the NY loca-
tion. They were arguing over a negative stock balance for
SKU #1234.
7E. Eric also observes Sally angrily telling the warehouse
manager that one of her customers, Widgets, Gidgets,
Gadgets and Such, was shorted 10 widgets on an order
it received “just a little while ago.”
8. Alana has also observed some interesting things in KC.
8A. Alana has observed two different order fillers attempting
to fill orders for the same item—from the same empty
shelf.
8B. At 5 PM one evening, Alana was standing behind Car-
men, the company’s billing clerk. Carmen’s inbox con-
tained several inches of delivery slips ready for
processing. Carmen got up and began to make prepara-
tions to go home. Alana asked her what she was doing.
Carmen replied, “It’s 5 PM, I’m going home.”
Alana said, “But you still have a lot of work in your
inbox.”
“So what? I’ll work on it tomorrow,” Carmen indig-
nantly responded.
“But you’ll mess up the warehouse if you don’t get
those slips processed tonight,” Alana stated.
161

162
Essentials of Inventory Management
Angrily, Carmen stated, “I work in accounting. I don’t
work in the warehouse.”
Alana asked, “How long would it take you to do
those?”
Carmen glanced at her inbox and replied, “About 30
minutes.”
“Please stay and get them done,” Alana cajoled.
“I can’t even if I wanted to,” Carmen said. “I’m not al-
lowed any overtime.”
Bill, one of Carmen’s coworkers, chimes in and says,
“Why can’t you get your work done during the day?”
Furious, Carmen turns on Bill and says, “Hey, you sort
and distribute the mail every morning, run photocopies
of all incoming checks while fighting with people over
our one copy machine, and prepare and go out to make
the daily deposit like I do; and then let’s see if you can
get your stuff done.”
8C. Hanging around the warehouse, Alana observed that re-
ceiving was done on a manual basis, and there wasn’t al-
ways a copy of a PO in the warehouse to support
incoming loads.
Alana noticed on several occasions that when receiv-
ing staff members did not have all appropriate paper-
work for an item, they would simply put it away or move
it off to the side. Then later, or the next day, they would
hunt down all of the appropriate documentation and
turn everything in to the data entry people for entry into
the system.
Like Eric, Alana also observed nonstockroom individ-
uals filling their own orders.
8D. Alana also observed a curious exchange between

Franklin, the accounting manager, and Carmen, the
billing clerk.
While attempting to create an invoice for an item, Car-
men’s computer screen flashed an error message indicat-
ing that she was trying to bill for something that had a
zero stock balance in the system. The software would not
let her bill for an item it did not reflect as being available
for the subject sale.
Carmen called Franklin over. She showed him the
signed delivery slip indicating that the item had, in fact,
been delivered.
Franklin stated, “Those people in the warehouse can’t
get anything right.” He then proceeded to manually over-
ride the system and entered the SKU (SKU #4567) and
quantity in question (10). Franklin then directed Car-
men to try again. The invoice was created without any
further problems.
Mid-morning of the next day, the stock records began
to show that there were 10 of SKU #4567 in the facility.
A telemarketing salesperson sold 10 SKU #4567s that af-
ternoon. A pick ticket was generated for the order. The
order filler could not find any of SKU #4567 in the ware-
house. A stock adjustment form is processed to take these
10 items out of stock.
8E. Alana overhears a telephone conversation between Car-
men and a customer. The customer wants to return five
SKU #9876s and wants to ensure that it is not charged
for them. Carmen notes the information, prepares a
pickup slip, and issues a credit to the customer’s account.
Later that day, a salesperson sells five SKU #9876’s. A
pick ticket was generated for the order. The order filler
163
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

could not find any of SKU #9876s in the warehouse. A
stock adjustment form is processed to take these five
items out of stock.
9. Meanwhile, Shawn has been talking to Ichiro, the inventory
control clerk in LA. Ichiro is frustrated. He works hard at his
job but can’t seem to track work in process.2 Consequently, he
is never sure how much of any particular item the company
has available for production purposes.
10. Shawn observes a worker disassembling a subassembly. He
asks the worker what he is doing. The worker replies that there
is a rush order for which they lack all of the raw materials, so
they are disassembling some less important assemblies to can-
nibalize the required parts.
Shawn asks if the products being disassembled are from
other orders. The worker replies that they are. Shawn asks
about any paperwork that was generated to support whatever
it is the worker is doing. The worker replies that he doesn’t
know.
Set out below is a discussion and explanation of each of the
events described above. For ease of reference, each event is restated
and then followed by its debrief. 
Discussion of Example Case
Event #1. Big Hammer, Inc., manufactures and distributes widgets.
Manufacturing occurs at its Los Angeles, CA, plant. It distributes
from two separate locations. One of these locations is in Kansas City,
MO, and has been part of Big Hammer for many years. The other
location is in New York, NY, and is the surviving portion of Paulex
Co., a distribution company just purchased by Big Hammer.
Any organization that has several locations must clearly an-
164
Essentials of Inventory Management

swer the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” questions:
Who is doing what? When are they doing it? Where are they
doing it? Why are they doing it? and How are they doing it? If
these questions are not answered, materials and information
will not flow smoothly between and among the organization’s
separate departments. 
Event #2. Marc, Big Hammer’s president, has just reviewed operating
reports from all three locations and is upset. It seems that the in-
ventory accuracy level at all three locations is off. The end result is
delayed production, too much inventory, and poor customer service.
In addition, various department heads in all three locations clash
with one another. To straighten everything out, he hires the con-
sulting firm of Alana, Eric, and Shawn.
Although consultants are helpful in most instances, by ap-
plying the concepts contained within this chapter, you should
be able to resolve many system problems your organization
may be currently experiencing.
Event #3. Alana goes to KC. Eric goes to NY. Shawn goes to LA.
Event #4. The trio immediately discovers that NY is using a different
software system than LA and KC. In addition, the LA/KC software
was designed for distribution, not manufacturing. However, some
modifications have been made to the LA/KC software to help with
manufacturing applications.
Trying to integrate different software systems is always dif-
ficult. Once again, any organization hoping to achieve that re-
sult must clearly lay out the timing and sequencing of the
information flow within the system.
In addition, the demand patterns for items in a distribution
world and those in a manufacturing environment are radically
different. Purchasing patterns for finished goods and spare
parts in a distribution are based on past usage patterns. Pur-
165
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

chasing patterns for the raw materials and subassemblies used
in manufacturing are based on the master production sched-
ule. Different concepts and formulae are used for each type of
inventory and, therefore, software designed for one or the other
or specifically written for a combination environment should
be used whenever possible.
Event #5. The NY system allocates inventory on a real-time basis. In
other words, as a pick ticket is generated for an item, the quantity
in question is allocated to a specific order and is not available for
any other customer—its paper life ceases.
The central problem often encountered in real-time systems
is that there is often a time lapse between the creation of a pick
ticket and the actual removal of the product from the shelves.
Since the items on the pick ticket were immediately allo-
cated3 to that order, with their paper life ceasing, those SKUs
will actually be sitting on the shelves but won’t appear in the
then current record count.
Somewhere in the software files is the information: total
items on hand, items allocated, and items actually available for
sale or use. The problem is that not everyone in the organiza-
tion has access to this information! If (a) staff members are al-
lowed to fill their own orders and (b) do not understand how
it is possible to check the then current stock records and see a
lower number of items than are actually sitting in plain view,
then (c) they will stop believing in the record count, will only
believe their eyes, and will raid product allocated for other or-
ders.
Event #6. The LA/KC system is a batch system. Items are relieved from
stock at the time the system is updated. This usually occurs once per
day when billing is done. A modification to the system backflushes1
some items out of stock during the manufacturing cycle.
166
Essentials of Inventory Management

The most significant issue created by batch software systems
is that items are physically gone from the shelves/building but
still appear in the record count until the system is updated. The
longer the length of time between updates, the more out of bal-
ance the shelf count and the record count are. Backflushing
works well if the backflush occurs at each level of the bill of
materials. See the discussion of Event #9.
Event #7. Eric wanders around the NY location and observes what fol-
lows in Event #8.
Event #8. Salespeople, customer service personnel, clerical staff, and
others freely roam through all stockrooms. Eric notices that some
nonstockroom personnel fill their own orders, grab samples for cus-
tomers, and put things back into the facility that they have previ-
ously removed.
Any organization hoping to always have its shelf count
match its record count simply must stop all unauthorized per-
sonnel from touching anything in a stockroom or warehouse.
In addition, authorized personnel must have a paper- or com-
puter-based document before placing anything into or remov-
ing anything from storage areas. These points cannot be
overstated. They are imperative to inventory accuracy.
Event #9. Eric observes that some of these individuals document their
actions immediately, while others document nothing, and others
turn in necessary paperwork—later.
Documentation created after something has been placed
into or removed from a facility creates all sorts of problems.
For example:
a. If an item is physically removed without a document
deleting it from inventory, then salespeople, production sched-
ulers, and others will believe that the item is still available for
sale or use. They will then generate pick tickets for its selection.
167
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

Order fillers will then waste their time looking for items that
do not exist. The order fillers will generate adjustment forms
leading to the items being deleted from inventory. Eventually,
when the original documentation goes through the system, it
causes these same items to be deleted from inventory—again.
Your shelf count and record count are now almost hopelessly
out of balance.
b. If an item is placed into the stockroom without accompa-
nying paperwork, then the subject SKU is unavailable for sale
or use—since no one knows it’s there.
Event #10. Eric observes Sally, a salesperson, peering intently at her
computer screen. He hears her utter an oath and declare out loud,
“I just saw a whole bunch of SKU #1234 out there a little while
ago.” She then creates a manual invoice within the software system,
prints it, walks out into the stockroom, fills the order she has just
created, delivers it to customer Acme Widgets of the World, and later
drops the signed delivery copy on the desk of her accounts receivables
clerk.
Event #10 is an example of someone in a real-time software
scenario who does not understand how it is possible to have a
stock record (in the computer or on hard paper copy) that re-
flects a stock balance lower than the actual number of items
on the shelves. Recall that the discrepancy is due to the time
period between the creation of a pick ticket with its allocation
of product to an order and the physical removal of the SKUs
from the stockroom.
Event #11. Eric observes an angry exchange between the warehouse
manager and the accounting manager of the NY location. They
were arguing over a negative stock balance for SKU #1234.
Since this is a real-time system, when Sally created a manual
pick ticket she caused the system to allocate and delete the sub-
168
Essentials of Inventory Management

ject SKU. If the stock balance was zero when Sally did this, her
actions have caused the balance to go into a negative.
As discussed in Event #7 of this section, Sally’s actions have
also created the potential for a much different problem in an
entirely different department of the organization. By forcing a
manual invoice through the system and dropping off a delivery
slip for billing, Sally has created the potential for a billing clerk
to try to create an invoice for product that the system has never
received into itself. Many accounting programs will not let an
invoice be created for product that has never been received.
Event #12. Eric also observes Sally angrily telling the warehouse man-
ager that one of her customers, Widgets, Gidgets, Gadgets and Such,
was shorted 10 widgets on an order it received “just a little while
ago.”
In Event #7C it should be obvious that the product Sally took
had already been allocated to a different customer (Customer
#1) than the one she was taking care of at that time (Customer
#2). Sally’s actions caused her to raid Customer #1’s order, caus-
ing a stockout for one of her own customers—Customer #1.
Event #13. Alana has also observed some interesting things in KC.
Event #14. Alana has observed two different order fillers attempting
to fill orders for the same item—from the same empty shelf.
It is common in batch systems that are only updated once
per day and in which there is no way to easily check (without
going to look) the availability of an item for multiple orders to
be written against the same “phantom” items. This also creates
the danger of multiple adjustments adding to the overall con-
fusion.
Event #15. At 5 PM one evening, Alana was standing behind Carmen,
the company’s billing clerk. Carmen’s inbox contained several inches
of delivery slips ready for processing. Carmen got up and began to
169
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

make preparations to go home. Alana asked her what she was doing.
Carmen replied, “It’s 5 PM, I’m going home.”
Alana said, “But you still have a lot of work in your inbox.”
“So what? I’ll work on it tomorrow,” Carmen indignantly re-
sponded.
“But you’ll mess up the warehouse if you don’t get those slips
processed tonight,” Alana stated.
Angrily, Carmen stated, “I work in accounting. I don’t work in
the warehouse.”
Alana asked, “How long would it take you to do those?”
Carmen glanced at her inbox and replied, “About 30 minutes.”
“Please stay and get them done,” Alana cajoled.
“I can’t even if I wanted to,” Carmen said. “I’m not allowed any
overtime.”
Bill, one of Carmen’s coworkers, chimes in and says, “Why can’t
you get your work done during the day?”
Furious, Carmen turns on Bill and says, “Hey, you sort and dis-
tribute the mail every morning, run photocopies of all incoming
checks while fighting with people over our one copy machine, and
prepare and go out to make the daily deposit like I do; and then
let’s see if you can get your stuff done.”
A number of issues are raised by the Event #15 scenario, in-
cluding:
a. The morning following an incident like the one described
will find everyone who deals with inventory—sales, account-
ing, production scheduling, customer service, and purchas-
ing—making decisions on information they believe is as
current as of the night before when the system was updated.
The reality is that the information is no more current than the
last time Carmen made it to the bottom of the inbox. If she
hasn’t made it to the bottom of her basket in several days, then
170
Essentials of Inventory Management

the records and operations are really suffering.
The problem is compounded by the fact that roughly 20 per-
cent of our inventory will represent 80 percent of our most im-
portant items. Therefore, not only does our shelf count not
match our record count, but they don’t match regarding some
of our most important items.
b. Another problem revealed by the incident is that the or-
ganization does not recognize the importance of getting all re-
ceiving and shipping into and out of the building on both a
real-life and paper-life basis every day. This is indicated by
those duties assigned to Carmen that cause her not to complete
her inventory-related tasks on a daily basis. Although these du-
ties are important, they should be performed by someone
whose actions do not have the ripple effect that Carmen’s ac-
tions have throughout the entire organization.
Event #16. Hanging around the warehouse, Alana observed that re-
ceiving was done on a manual basis, and there wasn’t always a copy
of a PO in the warehouse to support incoming loads.
Alana noticed on several occasions that when the receiving staff
members did not have all appropriate paperwork for an item, they
would simply put it away or move it off to the side. Then later, or
the next day, they would hunt down all of the appropriate docu-
mentation and turn everything in to the data entry people for entry
into the system.
Like Eric, Alana also observed nonstockroom individuals
filling their own orders.
Virtually every organization has a purchase order system.
And, in virtually every organization, anyone with the authority
to buy something is repeatedly told to have a PO for every-
thing. In spite of those facts, in many organizations product
comes in daily without any supporting documentation. This
171
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

causes confusion, inefficient receiving operations, and sepa-
rates an item’s real life from its paper life. (See also Chapter 1.)
There should be either a hard copy or a record of the PO in the
computer system available to receiving for all items that arrive
at the stockroom.
When an item’s real life becomes separated from its paper
life, people begin to ship or use product that has not been re-
ceived; to put away product that has not been received so that
no one knows it is available for sale or use creates an environ-
ment where inventory clerks and accounting personnel are
making adjustment after adjustment to the record count.
Event #17. Alana also observed a curious exchange between Franklin,
the accounting manager, and Carmen, the billing clerk.
While attempting to create an invoice for an item, Carmen’s
computer screen flashed an error message indicating that she was
trying to bill for something that had a zero stock balance in the sys-
tem. The software would not let her bill for an item it did not reflect
as being available for the subject sale.
Carmen called Franklin over. She showed him the signed delivery
slip indicating that the item had, in fact, been delivered.
Franklin stated, “Those people in the warehouse can’t get any-
thing right.” He then proceeded to manually override the system
and entered the SKU (SKU #4567) and quantity in question (10).
Franklin then directed Carmen to try again. The invoice was cre-
ated without any further problems.
Mid-morning of the next day, the stock records began to show
that there were 10 of SKU #4567 in the facility. A telemarketing
salesperson sold 10 SKU #4567s that afternoon. A pick ticket was
generated for the order. The order filler could not find any of SKU
#4567 in the warehouse. A stock adjustment form is processed to
take these 10 items out of stock.
172
Essentials of Inventory Management

From Event #16, it appears here that someone delivered an
item that had not yet gone through the paperwork receiving
cycle. Then when Carmen tried to bill for it, the software would
not let her.
Instead of researching what had actually happened, Franklin
overrode the system and put in a quantity of 10. Carmen’s
billing then deleted the 10 items.
When the receiving paperwork finally made it through the
system it created a quantity of 10 items that were no longer in
the building. These 10 phantom items were then sold—maybe
more than once.
When the 10 items could not be found, additional paper-
work had to be initiated to delete the SKUs from the system.
All of the above issues are caused, in part, by a lack of un-
derstanding on the part of various staff members of how the
timing and sequencing of the system works.
Event #18. Alana overhears a telephone conversation between Carmen
and a customer. The customer wants to return five SKU #9876s and
wants to ensure that it is not charged for them. Carmen notes the
information, prepares a pickup slip, and issues a credit to the cus-
tomer’s account.
Later that day, a salesperson sells five SKU #9876’s. A pick ticket
was generated for the order. The order filler could not find any of
SKU #9876s in the warehouse. A stock adjustment form is processed
to take these five items out of stock.
Although application software systems vary widely in how
items are accounted for, many systems place an item back into
stock (in the database) when a credit is issued against that item.
By issuing a credit, Carmen caused the software system to place
the five SKUs back into stock—even though they had not yet
been returned to the building.
173
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

Again, a lack of understanding regarding timing and se-
quencing of software and events causes terrible dysfunctions
to stockroom operations.
Event #19. Meanwhile, Shawn has been talking to Ichiro, the inventory
control clerk in LA. Ichiro is frustrated. He works hard at his job
but can’t seem to track work in process.2 Consequently, he is never
sure how much of any particular item the company has available
for production purposes.
As indicated in Event #4, a key problem Ichiro faces is that
the company is using two separate methods of relieving items
from stock. One method is batch, while the other is a backflush
of some items. Recall that backflushing refers to a software
technique where raw materials and other components going
into a particular subassembly or final product are relieved from
stock when that subassembly/product is completed.
As indicated in the discussion of Event #6, if a batch system
is not updated with some degree of frequency, it is difficult to
understand what is available without actually looking. This
problem can be overcome through software modules that ad-
vise the stockkeeper of those SKUs that have gone into com-
pleted orders. This report shows a running total for each SKU
that has been drawn down that day. Once the system is up-
dated, then a new report begins.
The key issue regarding backflushing is whether the back-
flush occurs at every level of the bill of materials. See Exhibit
6–1. (A similar example is also used in Exhibit 5–4.) If the
backflush only goes down one level, but no backflush occurred
at that next lower level, then all materials below that level will
still appear to be in stock. In reality they have been used up.
Event #20. Shawn observes a worker disassembling a subassembly. He
asks the worker what he is doing. The worker replies that there is a
174
Essentials of Inventory Management

175
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them
rush order for which they lack all of the raw materials, so they are
disassembling some less important assemblies to cannibalize the re-
quired parts.
Shawn asks if the products being disassembled are from other or-
ders. The worker replies that they are. Shawn asks about any pa-
perwork that was generated to support whatever it is the worker is
doing. The worker replies that he doesn’t know.

If the backflush occurs both at Level 2 and

will be deleted after the first backflush
(Level 2); and SKUs 0021 and 9876 will be
taken out after Level 1 is completed. Our
records would then properly reflect what
actually occurred.

Although perpetual computer systems
backflush more than one level down on the bill
of materials, for the purposes of this example,
assume a backflush of only a single level down.
If the backflush does not occur until Level 1 is
completed, then only SKUs 0021 and 9876 are
deleted from the stock record. SKUs 3435,
3436, and 3474 would still remain “in stock”
even though they were consumed in producing
SKU 1234.

Metrics
“You can’t control what you don’t measure.”
—Peter Drucker
Before doing anything toward establishing methods to discover, an-
alyze, and fix any discrepancies between actual on-hand stock lev-
els and database record levels, you should take a snapshot of where
you are now. There are two sets of numbers you should develop
that relate to (a) inventory record accuracy (IRA) and (b) fill rate.
IRA is a reflection of how well your shelf count and record
count match. In other words, do your stock records accurately re-
flect what is actually in the stockroom?
Fill rate is a reflection of how effective your inventory is. Did
you have what you needed when you needed it?
INVENTORY RECORD ACCURACY
An excellent way to establish a benchmark of how accurate your
inventory records are “right now” is to take a test count. 
Test Counting
A quick, accurate method of establishing your current IRA is to
perform a test count:
  Select 100 SKUs that represent a cross-section of all items.
In other words, select all sorts of items—fast movers, slow
movers, expensive items, inexpensive items, and those with
both long and short lead times to acquire.
  Count all 100 in all locations where they are located. Meas-
ure accuracy by considering actual units on the floor—not
dollar value.
  Divide the number of accurate counts by the total number
of counts. Accurate counts mean where the record count
176
Essentials of Inventory Management

and the shelf count exactly match.
  Quotient is your inventory record accuracy. See Exhibit 6–2.
Tolerances
How accurate does accuracy have to be? You may think, at first,
that accurate means that 100 percent of the time your stock records
match your shelf counts. Consider, however, your feelings about
counting a large container of nails.
In counting a large container of nails, would you actually count
each nail individually? It is more probable that you will (a) weigh
out one pound of nails, (b) count the number of nails in a pound,
(c) weigh all of the nails, and (d) then compute the total number of
nails by comparing the number of nails in a pound to the number
of pounds of nails in the container. Will your computation capture
the exact number of nails in the container? Probably not. Do you
really care? Probably not. Why? Because of the nature of the SKU in
question, in this case nails, is low cost, easy to acquire, and hard to
count individually (if there is a large quantity of them). Therefore,
you would probably be willing to accept some percentage of toler-
ance in your numbers. If you were within ±5 percent of a perfect
match between the record count and the shelf count, would you be
satisfied? Probably so. Would you be equally satisfied applying the
same approach to a large container of diamonds? Of course not.

Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

Many organizations allow a variance or tolerance in considering
IRA. That is, they allow a plus-minus percentage of accuracy they
find acceptable. These tolerances can be set using dollars, actual
units, or some combination of the two. Most accountants use dol-
lars. Stockkeepers should use actual units: It’s either here or it isn’t.
Few organizations accept a tolerance of greater than ±5 percent
on any item. In other words, a 95 percent tolerance should be the
lowest variance from a 100 percent accuracy level you will accept
for any item no matter what its characteristics.
If you will accept tolerances, they must be set for each item or
category of item with great care. Consider the following factors:
  Dollar value: The higher the dollar value, the more accuracy
you will demand.
  Usage rate: Usage rate can actually be argued in two ways:
 The Higher-the-Usage-Rate-the-Lower-the-Tolerance-
Level Argument: If you are using a large quantity of an
item, you will want to always know how much is
available so there is never a stockout.
 The Lower-the-Usage-Rate-Lower-the-Tolerance-Level
Argument: If an item is not moving very quickly, then
why should there be any discrepancy between shelf and
record count? A low variance percentage for a slow-
moving item will alert everyone to a problem quickly, as
opposed to waiting for a crisis. This argument assumes
that if there are stockouts on higher-moving products,
then the situation will alert everyone anyway.
  Lead time: The longer the lead time, the lower the tolerance
level. A long lead time requires more working reserve and
safety stock. See also Chapter 5.
178
Essentials of Inventory Management

  Level on bill of materials: The higher something is on the bill
of materials, the more overall value it has. Therefore, the higher
on the bill of materials an SKU is, the lower the tolerance.
  Criticality: Some items are critical for reasons other than dol-
lar value, usage rate, or lead time. A safety equipment com-
pany may only sell a few biohazard cleanup suits per year,
but when they are needed they are needed immediately.
  Combination of the above
In the following scenario, you’ll find an example of considering
tolerances.
Melvin, President of Megawatts, Inc., doesn’t believe in allowing
any tolerances in his inventory levels. His friend, Sarah, President
of Bright Lights Co., does.
A cross-section of 100 items was counted in each of these com-
panies’ facilities.
The actual stock count on 87 SKUs in each facility matched the
respective companies’ stock records.
Bright Lights allowed a variance of ±2 percent on 5 of the 13
items that were not 100 percent accurate. The count of these 5 fell
within their respective tolerances.
Melvin argues that Sarah’s higher IRA level is artificial and does-
n’t really reflect accuracy.
Sarah’s approach does reflect an acceptable level of accuracy if
87

Megawatts:

Bright
Lights:
179
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

the tolerances were carefully set. As in the container of nails exam-
ple, if we (1) weighed a large container of nails and determined
there were 14,003 nails, (2) entered that total into our records, (3)
reweighed the nails and determined there were 14,010 nails, would
we change our records? Probably not. The second total would fall
within an acceptable tolerance.
Once you have set tolerances, you should not make adjustments
to your records when a discrepancy between shelf and record
counts falls within the variance allowed. If an item does fall outside
of the tolerance range, you would hunt down the reason for the dis-
crepancy and adjust the record if necessary. See Exhibit 6–3.
FILL RATES
Although matching shelf count to record count is one way of
measuring inventory, it does not indicate if you have the items you
need when you need them. Simple fill rate calculations achieve that
objective. The fill rate looks at the qualitative nature of your in-
ventory efforts.
Fill Rate Formulae
The above indicates that you had 93 percent of the items you
needed on the day they were required.
The fill rate can reflect the availability of a single item or a
grouping of items.
Simple Fill Rate:
Items Shipped 
on a Given Day
Items Ordered
for Shipment 
on a Given Day
417 Items 
Shipped
447 Items 
Ordered
= 0.93 = 93% Fill Rate

Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them
Tolerances and Adjustments
Assume that a count was made of 10 SKUs, with the results 
being as follows:
SKU  RECORD COUNT ACTUAL COUNT % DEVIATION % TOLERANCE  HIT/MISS
SKUs 1, 4, and 8 fell outside of their tolerances. For 
example, if the count for SKU 1 would have fallen within the 
range of 1,176 to 1,224, ±2 percent of the record count, then 
it would have been a hit. It was not. Therefore, you would 
research why the discrepancies exist and adjust your records if 
necessary.
All of the other SKUs fell within their tolerances. How-
ever, only SKU 7 was exactly correct. You would still not make 
any adjustments to any SKUs where there was a hit. The 
variance percentages you set should allow you a comfortable 
range in which you can tolerate some up or down differences. 
Often pluses and minuses cancel one another out over time.

This indicates that you were unable to send all orders out com-

Tools with Which to Uncover
System Dysfunctions
To solve problems you need to engage in:
  Fact finding—what is happening now?
  Problem finding—what is wrong with what is going on?
  Solution finding—how can we fix what is wrong?
So far this chapter has focused on (a) beginning to analyze in-
ventory problems in an intellectual, intuitive, “gut feel” manner,
and (b) developing some measurements with which to understand
your current level of inventory accuracy and availability. This is
part of fact finding.
Another way of determining what is actually happening at your
facility is to create a number of charts.
Charts, by their very nature, allow you to analyze things. How-
ever, you need to guard against “paralysis by analysis.” If everything
is equally important, then nothing is important. In other words,
you should only chart things that are really important to controlling
inventory items, trends, operational undertakings, and so on.

RUN CHARTS
Run charts allow you to measure a variable that changes over time.
A run chart is an x–y axis chart with the unit of measure appear-
ing on the vertical y-axis, and the timeframe running along the hor-
izontal x-axis. The unit of measure can be anything you wish to track
such as stockouts, errors, labor hours, pieces, pounds, or gallons. The
timeframe can also be whatever you desire it to be such as seconds,
minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. See Exhibit 6–4.

FLOW CHARTS
Flow charts allow you to analyze the sequence of a set of events. A
flow chart does not necessarily show the interdependence of events
or which events are going on at the same time as others.
Flow charts are easier to understand than written procedures.
Caution:
  You do not have to use traditional flow chart symbols. Be
consistent, however, with the symbols you do use or you
will confuse yourself and others. Provide a key to symbols.
  Have version control. If flow charts are not revised as
procedures change, they are worthless.
LOGIC CHARTS
Logic charts are flow charts that show the interrelationships of events.

VARIANCE REPORTS
Variance reports compare an expectation with what actually oc-
curred.
Variance reports can be based on any factor necessary for track-
ing an expectation. Some factors are dollars, labor, consumption
rates, lines/pieces per hour, or trucks per day.
Cycle Counting
After becoming familiar with your system through utilization of
the techniques described in this chapter, you should be ready to
systematically approach “fixing” whatever might be causing dis-
crepancies between your shelf and record counts.
The most systematic method of solving inventory problems and
enjoying a consistently high IRA is cycle counting. Cycle counting
is simply counting a statistically significant cross-section of your
inventory frequently.
This continuous counting leads to the discovery of discrepan-
cies soon after they arise. By catching an error quickly, you can
backtrack through both the paperwork and the stock movement of
the item(s) to determine why that SKU’s paper life became sepa-
rated from its real life. Once the cause of the error is identified, it
can be eliminated.
Since this is a continuous process, as one cause of error after
another is eliminated the system begins to operate more and more

smoothly. Eventually all items move through a series of procedures
that work.
Cycle counting is different than an annual inventory in several
ways.
ANNUAL INVENTORIES
In a nutshell, the objective of an annual physical inventory is to satisfy
an accounting need.
Objectives:
  The objective of the annual physical inventory is to
produce a financial valuation of the inventory on a given
day.
  Every item must be counted as part of the annual
inventory.
The 12-month-long audit trail of the annual physical is too
long for any serious effort made at uncovering why an error oc-
curred or even when—did it happen yesterday, last month, 10
months ago?
CYCLE COUNTING
In a nutshell, the objective of cycle counting is to identify and correct
system failures that result in inaccurate inventory records.
Objectives:
  Discover discrepancies soon after they occur
  Identify causes of errors
  Correct conditions causing errors
  Continuous process improvement
  Minimum of 95 percent accuracy on ALL items
  Correct statement of inventory assets
Eliminate annual inventory. Most accounting firms will allow
186
Essentials of Inventory Management

an organization to stop taking annual physical inventories once
the company has established a mature cycle counting program.
Generally, a company will cycle-count for at least 12 months. Then,
an annual physical inventory is taken and the numbers from the
annual are compared with the cycle count figures. If they match,
then in the future the accounting firm will merely test-count once
per year for valuation purposes.
Not every item in the building has to be counted as part of a
cycle count, only a statistically significant cross-section of all items.
CYCLE COUNT METHODOLOGIES
There are a number of cycle count methodologies.
  Control Group
  Location Audit
  Random Selection
  Diminishing Population
  Product Categories
  A-B-C Categorization
A key point to remember is that no matter what cycle count
methodology you eventually choose to follow, when you first begin
and your inventory record accuracy is low, you will not count a
large number of items per day. This is because it will take time to
recount, review paperwork, talk to people, and do all of the other
things necessary to determine why an item’s record count and shelf
count do not match. Why count 50 items a day if you can only
count and reconcile 10 of them? As your record accuracy increases,
and more and more items match their record counts, you can com-
fortably count more items each day.
Any cycle count methodology will assist you in achieving high
levels of IRA. However, not every method works in every company
187
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

setting. For example:
Assumptions:
  You wish to cycle-count each item four times per year
  Cycle-count 200 days per year (4 days/wk × 50 wks = 200
count days)4 10,000 SKUs
  Three cycle counters working 7 hours per day
  Company A has 10,000 items that are unitized and in
single locations within the stockroom
  It takes Company A an average of 2 minutes to count an item
Company B has 10,000 items that are not unitized, would have
to be counted in “onesy-twosy,” and each item is found in multiple
locations throughout the facility
It takes Company B an average of 5 minutes to count an item
Treating all items equally and counting them four times per year
may work for Company A, but it seems an unreasonable burden for
Company B.
You should select a method that fits your own organization’s
Company A
10,000 SKUs x 4 counts/yr =
40,000 counts
40,000 counts ÷ 200 days = 
200 counts/day
200 counts/day x 2 minutes =

400 minutes ÷ 60 minutes =

Company B

resources and inventory types.
CONTROL GROUP CYCLE COUNTING METHOD
No matter which method you eventually decide to use, always start
with a small-scale counting test run. By using a control group ap-
proach you will be able to:
  Immediately identify significant system problems, such as
unrestricted access to the stockroom, major timing
problems related to when product is moved, and when
records of the move are updated.
  Develop an understanding of the who, what, when, where,
why, and how of the way your system actually works.
  When you first begin cycle counting you will probably
make adjustments only to find that you made a mistake. It
is much simpler to correct errors related to only a few
SKUs rather than hundreds of them.
Control Group Procedure
Set out below is a step-by-step procedure for using a control group
to teach yourself basic cycle counting techniques.
  Select 100 items as a control group. IMPORTANT: The
SKUs selected must be a true cross-section of the entire pop-
ulation of items they represent, such as some expensive
items, some inexpensive, some fast movers, some slow, or
some with a long lead time, etc.
  Count only 10 items per day. Use a Control Group Count
Tracking Sheet. See Exhibit 6–5.
  Count for 100 days.
  Stats: 10 × 100 = 1,000 counts
189
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

  “Cycle” is 10 days
  Each item counted 10 times during test
Because you have tracked the same items over and over again,
at the conclusion of your control group cycle count you should be
able to eliminate major systems problems and have a good under-
standing of how your overall inventory system is working.
The control group approach should only be used as a starting
point and not as an ongoing cycle count method. The reason for
this is that the control group is not statistically large enough to ac-
tually represent your entire inventory.
Now you are ready to select a cycle count method that best suits
your own organization’s needs.
LOCATION AUDIT CYCLE COUNTING METHOD 
In this approach, you divide the stockroom(s) up in some logical
method—rooms, racks, bins, and so on. See Exhibit 6–6. Then on
each counting day you count the SKUs found in those areas.

All items are treated equally. In other words, selection of those
items included on that day’s count is based solely on the item being
located in the area counted. No other characteristics, such as cost,
usage rate, and so on, are considered.
The length of the cycle depends on how many areas are to be
counted. For example, if you were counting by rack, one rack per
day, and there were 45 racks, then the entire cycle would be 45 days.
You would then start over again.
The location audit approach has two significant benefits:
1. This approach does not require detailed recordkeeping of
whether or not you have counted a specific item or the exact
number of times you have counted it. It is administratively sim-
ple to follow.
2. This approach serves as a double audit because you are checking
the quantity of an item at the same time that you are checking

to make sure it is in the right location in your facility. Product
that has been misplaced can be “discovered” sooner than the an-
nual inventory through the use of this method.
Two separate approaches are possible regarding how much of
any selected SKU gets counted:
1. Only count the SKU in the location being cycle-counted that
day.
Example: Count only the quantity of SKU xyz in Rack 1. See
Exhibit 6–6. Item xyz located in Rack 10 and in both bulk stor-
age areas are ignored.
This first approach requires a higher level of sophistication
within your own inventory control system. Your system must
allow you to identify not only how much of an item you have,
but also each location it is located in and how much of it is in
each location. See also Chapter 3, Physical Location and Control
of Inventory.
This first approach forces you to keep your shelf count and
record count accurate on an ongoing basis.
2. Count the selected SKU in all locations where it may be located
throughout the facility.
Example: Quantities of SKU xyz counted in Racks 1 and 10
and in both bulk areas.
With either locational audit approach, the warehouse
will be counted wall to wall during the cycle. However, this
does not mean that all items in the stockroom during that
cycle will actually be counted.
Not all items in the stockroom during the cycle will be
counted because items will arrive into and leave from areas
already counted or to be counted during the cycle. In other
words, SKUs will be coming in behind you and moving
192
Essentials of Inventory Management

away from in front of you as you go through the count.
Does it matter if every item in the stockroom is counted
during a location audit cycle? It does not matter that all
items are not counted during any particular cycle because
of the large number of items that are counted during that
cycle. Remember that in cycle counting, you are interested
in looking at the system, not individual SKUs within the
system. Whether or not a SKU’s shelf and record counts
match is merely a way of determining if the system is actu-
ally working. Therefore, as long as you count a statistically
significant number of the total items in the stockroom, you
will accomplish the cycle count objective.
RANDOM SELECTION CYCLE COUNTING METHOD
This is probably the easiest form of cycle counting. The items se-
lected for counting are totally random. However, the SKUs selected
must be a true cross-section of the entire population of items they
represent: some expensive items, some inexpensive, some fast
movers, some slow movers, some with a long lead time.
The cycle is generally one year with a statistically significant
number of SKUs being counted during that timeframe. For exam-
ple,
  10,000 total SKUs
  200 counting days
  Therefore, 50 items/day counted (10,000 ÷ 200 = 50)
  10,000 total counts during the year—a statistically
significant number!
All items are treated equally. Product characteristics like dollar
value and usage rate are ignored.
193

DIMINISHING POPULATION CYCLE COUNTING METHOD
This is a versatile approach. It can be used as a stand-alone proce-
dure or used as part of the product category approach or the A-B-
C approach, which are both explained later in this chapter.
The basic concept is to:
1. Count each item in a defined population before counting any
item over again.
2. Then you begin the count all over again.
The diminishing population technique ensures all items in the
population are counted at least once per cycle.
The number of times the total population is counted during a
year depends on the size of the total number of items there are and
how many days you are willing to count. See Exhibit 6–7.
The larger the number of items counted per day the more cycles
can be completed during the year.
PRODUCT CATEGORIES CYCLE COUNTING METHOD
To this point in our cycle count discussion, we have ignored an
item’s characteristics. In the product categories approach, the or-
ganization decides on what categories it wishes to place SKUs into
UNCOUNTED
POPULATION
COUNTED POPULATION
COUNTED POPULATION
UNCOUNTED
POPULATION
194
Essentials of Inventory Management

based on some characteristics, such as by manufacturer or by type
of use (the “criteria”).
Items matching the criteria are counted either on the basis of:
(a) a single even (e.g., only items whose balance-on-hand
equals zero), or
(b) using the diminishing population technique for each
separate category: all of the widgets this week, all of the
gadgets next week, all of the gidgets the week after, and
so on.
The number of items to be counted can vary or be set by the
number of items in the group divided by the number of days in
the cycle. See Exhibit 6–7.
Cycle can be a single day or a defined number of times per year.

• 4 cycles per

• 900 ÷ 50 
= 18 items/day
• 3,600 total

Exhibit 6–7 Diminishing Population Cycle Counting

Single Criteria
You should be careful of using single event characteristics in
defining categories. For example:
Criteria: Only cycle-count items on that day’s purchase orders.
Benefits:
1. Ensures that correct quantity is being ordered.
2. Allows for count when stock level is at a low point. Makes
it easier to count.
Problems:
a. Only the fastest moving items receive attention. Expensive
but slower use items might be ignored until there is a cri-
sis.
b. A true cross-section of all types of SKUs won’t be repre-
sented until a large part of the year will have past and
when POs for most items will have been written and re-
leased.
c. Ignores completely items that are not ordered during a
given year such as where the quantity on hand exceeds
your use for that entire year.
Criteria: Only cycle-count items at zero or negative balance
Benefits:
1. Negative balances should always trigger a count.
2. Items at zero should be easy to verify.
Problems:
a. Neither of these is statistically significant and both fail
to represent a cross-section of all items.
196
Essentials of Inventory Management

Using the Diminishing Population Technique with Product
Categories
  Define the criteria by which each SKU will be placed into
a category.
  Decide sequence in which categories will be counted: all
manufacturer X’s products this week, all of manufacturer
Y’s products next week.
  Divide the number of SKUs in the category by the number
of days to determine how many must be counted per day.
See Exhibit 6–7.
  Move to the next category.
The product categories method of cycle counting involves a
great deal of administration but provides you with more detailed
information and audit trails as to what you have actually done dur-
ing a cycle count.
A-B-C ANALYSIS CYCLE COUNTING METHOD
The most sophisticated method of cycle counting, and the one pre-
ferred by most accountants, is to break your inventory up into A-B-
C classifications. Items are not treated equally. Based on classification,
the A items will be counted more frequently than the B items, and
the B items will be counted more frequently than the C items.
The A-B-C method may not be appropriate to your particular
business. This approach is based on the items in a particular cate-
gory actually being part of the active inventory throughout an entire
12-month cycle count period. In other words, if you wish to count
the A Category items 12 times per year, they must actually be part
of the inventory throughout that year.
If your business is highly seasonal or by its nature features an
ever-changing product or item base, then the A-B-C method is not
197
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

appropriate. 
An example of a business where the A-B-C method is probably
not appropriate would be a “job shop” manufacturer. Job shops pro-
duce an item pursuant to a specific order. Therefore, although the
organization will certainly use a number of standard items it always
has on hand for that job, many of the things it uses will be obtained
for that order alone. These specific items will be purchased, used,
and not replaced. They will not be around long enough to be part
of an A-B-C count cycle. A method that analyzes items “in the
house” at a given point in time would be more appropriate in a job
shop environment. 
The classifications in the A-B-C method are based on “Pareto’s
Law”— the 80-20 Rule. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of Pareto’s
Law and of how to determine which SKUs go into which categories
using a single criterion for establishing value. 
For cycle counting purposes, classifications are determined by
“value.” Value could be based on money, usage rate, acquisition lead
times, the critical nature of an item, or a combination of two or
more factors.
Because Chapter 3 deals with item placement, usage rate was
used as the value criterion. 
There are a number of problems with using a single criterion
to establish your A-B-C categories for cycle counting purposes, in-
cluding:
  The criterion used may not be reflective of the entire
inventory. For example, if you use dollar value alone, a
number of high-dollar items that are infrequently sold or
used would become A Category items, while low-dollar
items that are used or sold in large quantities would
become C Category items.
198
Essentials of Inventory Management

  Different departments in your organization have different
and sometimes conflicting interests. For example,
individuals charged with balance sheet responsibilities will
be concerned with dollar value, while stockkeepers and
production managers will be more interested in quantities
and usage rates. Purchasing agents will have the additional
concerns of acquisition lead times and the criticality (“Just
gotta have it when we need it”) of various items. By using
a single criterion you will almost certainly alienate
someone.
Because of the problems associated with using a single criterion
to establish A-B-C categories for cycle counting purposes, this au-
thor strongly recommends that you use at least two criteria. The
technique for blending two (or more) criteria into a single blended
value for your analysis is explained below. 
Step-By-Step Implementation of the A-B-C Cycle Count
Method
You can create a single value from two or more criteria by multi-
plying the values of one criterion by the values of another criterion.
Then you use the blended value for your analysis. Here’s how you
do it:
  Perform Pareto analysis of SKUs utilizing desired criteria.
See Chapter 3 and Exhibit 6–8. 
  Assign SKUs into A-B-C categories. See Exhibit 6–9.
  Decide count frequency of each category. See the section,
“Determining A-B-C Count Frequency,” below.
  Multiply respective number of SKUs per category by
desired frequency to establish total counts. Cycle is
assumed to be one year. See Exhibit 6–10. 
199
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

  Divide total counts by the number of count days (for
example, 200 days per year) to determine number of items
to be counted each day. See Exhibit 6–10. 
  Ask yourself, Is this a reasonable number of daily items? If
“Yes,” proceed. If “No,” then change the frequencies and
recalculate until a reasonable daily total is established.
  Determine how many items from each category will be
counted each day. See Exhibit 6–10.
 Divide the number of annual counts within each
category by the total (annual) number of counts. This
establishes the percentage of counts represented by the
respective categories when compared to the total
counts.
 Multiply the A, B, and C percent of total by the number
of items to be counted daily. This establishes the
quantity of each category to be counted each day.
  Count each category the desired number of times using
the diminishing population technique.

Determining A-B-C Count Frequency
Determine count frequency by:
  Deciding count frequency of each category. You can count
the respective categories the number of times you desire.
There is no rule-of-thumb. You may want to count “A”
items 12 times per year, “B” items 4 times per year, and “C”
items 2 times per year. See Exhibit 6–8.

Exhibit 6–10 Determining How Many Items from Each
Category Will Be Counted Each Day

  Multiplying the respective number of SKUs per category
by the desired frequency to establish total counts. Cycle is
assumed to be one year. See Exhibit 6–11.
  Dividing the total counts by the number of count days
(for example, 200 days per year) to determine the number
of items to be counted each day.
Determining How Many Items from Each Category Will Be
Counted Each Day 
It’s now time to compute how many items from each category
must be counted each counting day to achieve the number of
counts for each respective category you desire. 
  Divide the number of annual counts within each category
by the total (annual) number of counts. This establishes
the percentage of counts represented by the respective
categories when compared to the total counts. See Exhibit
6–10.
Multiply the A, B, and C percent of total by the number of
items to be counted daily. This establishes the quantity of each cat-
egory to be counted each day. See Exhibit 6–10.
WHEN TO COUNT
The ideal time during the day to cycle-count would be when there
is no movement of paper or product. You may, therefore, want to
count:
  At end of business day
  Prior to start of day
  Over the weekend
  During slowest shift
206
Essentials of Inventory Management

Another alternative is to creating a cycle counting cut off during
a regular business day by using time-of-day.
To use this approach you would:
1. Create a list of items to be cycle-counted the next day.
2. Distribute the list to Shipping, Receiving, the stock put-away
workers, order fillers, and data entry clerks.
3. Have Receiving, Shipping, the stock put-away workers, order
fillers, and data entry clerks all note the time of day they inter-
acted and actually dealt with any of the items on your list.

Ask yourself, Is this a reasonable number
of daily items? If “Yes,” proceed. If “No,”
change the frequencies and recalculate until
a reasonable daily total is established. 
Exhibit 6–11 Determining Count Frequency and Number of
Items to Count Per Day

4. You now have the ability to audit back into any timeframe dur-
ing the day. For example:
 You cycle-count widgets at 1:00 PM using a stock status
report generated by data entry at 11:30 AM.
 You find that there are 10 less widgets on the shelves
than the stock status shows.
 You review all of the paperwork from these different
departments.
 The receiving paperwork shows that 10 widgets were
received at 10:30 AM.
 There is no paperwork from the stock put-away
workers indicating that the widgets were ever moved
into stock.
 The missing widgets are sitting out in the dock area.
Your record count matches what you have in-house.
WHO SHOULD COUNT
If there are four hours of counting involved in cycle-counting all
items on any given day, should you have a single person count for
four hours and then begin any necessary reconciliations—or does
it make more sense to have four people count for one hour each
and then let the inventory control clerk have the rest of the day to
correct any problems? It makes sense to spread the raw counting
portion of the cycle count among a group of people. This will allow
the inventory control clerk to devote more hours of each day to
actually fixing the system as opposed to spending each day count-
ing boxes.
208
Essentials of Inventory Management

Recap
The objective of this chapter was to provide you with insights as
to why many inventory control systems fail.
Often failure is due to individuals in different departments sim-
ply not understanding the unintended consequences of their own
actions.
A review of who is supposed to write something down, what
they are supposed to write down, who they are to give the informa-
tion to, what that person is supposed to do with the information,
and the sequencing and overall timing of these events often reveals
that respective departments are using different units of measure to
define inventory. Some use dollars, while others use actual physical
units. In addition, seemingly simple issues like the timing of when
an item is entered into the computer system or who is allowed to
actually see various items of information can cause severe misun-
derstandings and inventory inaccuracies.
In analyzing “what is going on,” metrics should be used, with
the old management phrase, “You can’t control what you don’t
measure,” being a constant guiding principle.
By documenting the who, what, when, where, why, and how of
how the system is actually working you can demonstrate to yourself
and others where changes might be necessary.
REVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Cycle counting is:
(a) counting a statistically significant cross-section of your
inventory frequently.
(b) counting everything in your facility at least twice per cal-
209
Why Inventory Systems Fail and How to Fix Them

endar or fiscal year.
(c) determining a fair valuation of your inventory value at
least once per fiscal year.
(d) counting all of the bicycle parts in your facility.
2. Flow charts allow you to:
(a) analyze the sequential sequence of a set of events.
(b) determine trends.
(c) compare a projected value against an actual one.
(d) create a report that identifies the number of items per
level and number of tiers of product on a flow-through
rack.
3. Run charts allow you to:
(a) analyze the sequential sequence of a set of events.
(b) determine trends.
(c) compare a projected value against an actual one.
(d) create a report that identifies the number of items per
level and number of tiers of product on a flow-through
rack.
4. True or False
The diminishing population method of cycle counting involves
counting items when that SKU’s stock level reaches zero.
(a) True
(b) False
5. Fill rates indicate:
(a) how much of a particular SKU you have in stock at the
end of a calendar month.
(b) the quantitative nature of your inventory.
(c) if you had what you needed when you needed it.
(d) the ratio of accurate shelf counts to record counts.
210
Essentials of Inventory Management

Answers
1. (a), 2. (a), 3. (b), 4. (b), 5. (c)
Notes
1. Backflushing refers to a software technique where raw materi-
als and other components going into a particular subassembly
or final product are relieved from stock when that subassem-
bly/product is completed. If there were a seat and a leg assembly
that goes into making up a stool, then upon completion of the
stool these items would be deleted from inventory. Until the
backflush occurs the respective parts, subassemblies, and so on
remain in the record count. Contrast this to having each item
relieved from stock as it is removed from the shelf for produc-
tion purposes. Backflushing reduces the time and effort in-
volved in tracking individual inventory transactions.
2. Work in process is used to describe raw materials, parts, and
subassemblies as they are being used to produce the next higher
level component or finished item in a bill of materials (the
recipe of materials going into an assembly of some type).
3. Allocation refers to an item being tied to a specific order. “Re-
lieving” an item refers to it actually being removed from stock
in terms of both its paper life and its real life.
4. It is a rule of thumb that cycle counting should be done 4 days
per week, 50 weeks per year, 200 days per year.
